    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Agentialist Accounts\n3.8 Expressivist Accounts \n\nExpressivist views highlight similarities between utterances like\n\u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d and direct expressions of one\u2019s\nmental states, such as wincing or saying \u201couch!\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1953; Finkelstein 2003; Bar-On 2004; Campbell 2020). In\nparticular, these views center on the idea that utterances like\n\u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d\u2014avowals\u2014directly\nexpress the mental states they ascribe. The most radical version of\nexpressivism\u2014what Bar-On (2004) calls Simple Expressivism,\nsometimes attributed to Wittgenstein\u2014says that avowals, like\nnon-linguistic expressions of mental states such as wincing, are\nneither true nor false. On that view, avowals do not express\nknowledge any more than wincing does. Most contemporary\nexpressivists take avowals to express self-knowledge. Since our\nconcern is with self-knowledge, our discussion will be limited to\nthose views.\n\nAvowals include thoughts like I want some water as well as\nutterances like \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d. According to the expressivist,\nthe relation between an avowal and the mental state it expresses is\ndirect in two respects. First, no judgment to the effect that\nI\u2019m in pain or desire water intervenes between my pain or desire\nand my avowal. Just as a wince flows from my pain directly, a\nspontaneous avowal flows from my pain (or desire) directly, unmediated\nby any judgment. Second, the knowledge expressed in such avowals is\nepistemically \u201cgroundless\u201d in that it is not based on\nevidence that one is in pain or desires water. Obviously, the\nsubject can directly express only her own mental states.\n\nExpressivist approaches differ as to the feature of avowals that they\naim to explain. Finkelstein and Bar-On focus on the social-linguistic\naspect of avowals, known as first-person authority: we ordinarily\ndefer to others about their own mental states, so avowals are presumed\nto be true. Campbell focuses on the epistemic aspect of avowals, known\nas first-person privilege: our capacity to avow our mental states\nconstitutes a privileged epistemic position vis-a-vis those\nstates.\n\nFinkelstein allows that my avowal \u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d\nmay be caused by my happiness. But he denies that this is a matter of\nbrute causation, as hitting someone\u2019s knee with a hammer brutely\ncauses his leg to kick out. Rather, what differentiates these cases is\nthat my happiness and my spontaneous avowal \u201chave, we might say, a\nparticular kind of intelligibility\u201d (Finkelstein 2003: 126). This does\nnot mean that my happiness rationalizes the avowal. (A relevant\ncontrast here is with the reasons account.) Instead, he says, my\navowal, like my smiling, makes sense together with my happiness in\nsomething like the way that a dog\u2019s pain and its moaning make\nsense together, in \u201cthe logical space of animate life\u201d.\n\n\nSince dogs are not usually thought to possess self-knowledge, this\nanalogy raises the question: Does my avowal \u201cI\u2019m\nhappy\u201d express knowledge that I\u2019m happy? The\nanswer is complex, on Finkelstein\u2019s view. Whether the avowing\nsubject is to be credited with self-knowledge depends, he thinks, on\nhow one understands \u201cknowledge\u201d: in particular, avowals do\nnot express knowledge if knowledge requires an epistemic grounding in\nevidence.\n\nBar-On\u2019s account focuses on the fact that avowals enjoy a\npresumption of truth. To use one of her examples: if I say\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d, it would be inappropriate (in\nordinary circumstances) for you to question whether I am the\none who is happy, or whether what I\u2019m feeling is\nhappiness. This presumption of truth is explained, on\nBar-On\u2019s account, by the fact that my avowal flows directly from\nmy happy feeling. That is, my avowal is not based on evidence about\nhow I feel, and no judgment to the effect that I\u2019m happy\nmediates between my happiness and the avowal.\n\nBar-On maintains that avowals can represent \u201cgenuine and\nprivileged self-knowledge\u201d (Bar-On 2004: 405), although the\navowing subject typically has not \u201cformed the active judgment\n[that he is happy] on some basis\u201d, and cannot offer evidence\nbearing on his happiness (ibid.: 363). She is not committed to a\nparticular account of how avowals constitute knowledge, but\nshe presents a number of approaches compatible with her view, which\nshe calls Neo-Expressivism.\n\nOn one of these approaches, a conscious state can provide epistemic\nwarrant for a self-ascription directly, in the two senses of\ndirectness mentioned earlier: that is, without mediation by a judgment\nand without serving as evidence for the avowal. \n\n\n[A]vowing subjects enjoy a special epistemic warrant, since their\npronouncements, when true, are epistemically grounded in the very\nstates they ascribe to themselves, which states also serve as the\nreasons for their acts of avowing. (Bar-On 2004: 405)\n\n\n(By \u201cepistemically grounded\u201d, Bar-On simply means\nwarranted: such avowals are not based on evidence.)\n\nAlthough both Finkelstein and Bar-On maintain that avowals may qualify\nas knowledge, providing an epistemology of self-knowledge is, for\nthem, at most a peripheral goal. These views are concerned with\navowals that issue directly from the states they express, in something\nlike the way a dog's moaning issues directly from its pain. But to\nsome critics, this spontaneous, reflexive quality of\navowals\u2014that they are not informed by evidence or\nreasoning\u2014means that they cannot represent to the kind of\nepistemic achievement required for knowledge.\n\nCampbell (2020) draws on the idea at the core of\nexpressivism\u2014that only the subject can directly express their\nmental states\u2014to explain our special epistemic position relative\nto our own mental states. Her account contrasts with\nFinkelstein\u2019s and Bar-On\u2019s in taking the epistemic\ndimension of avowals (first-person privilege) to be the basis for\ntheir social-linguistic dimension (first-person authority).\n\nCampbell proposes that an avowal like \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d can express\nnot only pain but also knowledge that I\u2019m in\npain (2020: 15). This proposal draws on her Rational Response account\nof knowledge, which says that knowing that p is \u201cbeing able\nto rationally respond to or operate with, the fact\nthat p\u201d (ibid.: 12). On this account, to know that I want\nwater is to have the rational capacities to act on, express, and\nreason with my desire for water. I exercise these capacities when I\nrationally respond to my desire in any of a variety of ways: pouring\nmyself a glass of water, or altering my route so that I will pass a\ndrinking fountain, or saying \u201cI want some water\u201d. The utterance \u201cI\nwant some water\u201d expresses self-knowledge, of the uniquely\nfirst-personal kind, if it is a direct, rational response to my desire\nfor water. This response must be direct in the ways described\nearlier: not based on an intermediate judgment or on evidence about my\ndesire. The requirement that it be rational distinguishes\nexpressions of self-knowledge from brute reactions, e.g. a dog\u2019s\nresponding to his thirst by going to his water bowl.\n\nThis last point highlights an aspect of Campbell\u2019s account that\ndeserves further discussion. The account rests on distinguishing\nrational responses to the fact that p from non-rational (or\n\u201cbrute\u201d) reactions. If the account is to explain rather than\npresuppose first-person privilege, what makes a response\nrational must not be analyzed in epistemic terms. E.g., the\nrationality of a response must not lie in its being justified or\nwarranted. This is a fruitful area for future work on this new\ncontribution to the self-knowledge literature.\n",
