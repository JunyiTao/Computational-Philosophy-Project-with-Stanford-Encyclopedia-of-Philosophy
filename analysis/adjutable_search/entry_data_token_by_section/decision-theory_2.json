To be precise, let us say that \\(u\\) is a\nutility function with domain \\(S\\). We say that the function\n\\(u\\) represents the preference \\(\\preceq\\) between the\noptions in \\(S\\) just in case: \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\\text{For any}\\ A, B \\in S: u(A)\\leq u(B) \\Leftrightarrow A\\preceq B\\]\n\n\nAnother way to put this is that, when the above holds, the preference\nrelation can be represented as maximising utility, since it\nalways favours option with higher utility.\n\nThe only information contained in an ordinal utility representation is\nhow the agent whose preferences are being represented orders options,\nfrom least to most preferable. This means that if \\(u\\) is an ordinal\nutility function that represents the ordering \\(\\preceq\\), then any\nutility function \\(u'\\) that is an ordinal transformation of\n\\(u\\)\u2014that is, any transformation of \\(u\\) that also satisfies\nthe biconditional in (1)\u2014represents \\(\\preceq\\) just as well as\n\\(u\\) does. Hence, we say that an ordinal utility function is\nunique only up to ordinal transformations.\n\nThe result referred to above can be summarised as follows:\n\nTheorem 1 (Ordinal representation). Let \\(S\\) be a\nfinite set, and \\(\\preceq\\) a weak preference relation on \\(S\\). Then\nthere is an ordinal utility function that represents \\(\\preceq\\) just\nin case \\(\\preceq\\) is complete and transitive.\n\nThis theorem should not be too surprising. If \\(\\preceq\\) is complete\nand transitive over \\(S\\), then the options in \\(S\\) can be put in an\norder, from the most to the least preferred, where some options may\nfall in the same position (if they are deemed equally desirable) but\nwhere there are no cycles, loops, or gaps.\n Theorem 1\n just says that we can assign numbers to the options in \\(S\\) in a way\nthat represents this order. (For a simple proof of Theorem 1, except\nfor a strict rather than a weak preference relation, consult Peterson\n2009: 95.)\n\nNote that ordinal utilities are not very mathematically\n\u201cpowerful\u201d, so to speak. It does not make sense, for\ninstance, to compare the probabilistic expectations of different sets\nof ordinal utilities. For example, consider the following two pairs of\nprospects: the elements of the first pair are assigned ordinal\nutilities of 2 and 4, while those in the second pair are assigned\nordinal utilities of 0 and 5. Let us specify a \u201cflat\u201d\nprobability distribution in each case, such that each element in the\ntwo pairs corresponds to a probability of 0.5. Relative to this\nprobability assignment, the expectation of the first pair of ordinal\nutilities is 3, which is larger than 2.5, the expectation of the\nsecond pair. Yet when we transform the ordinal utilities in a\npermissible way\u2014for instance by increasing the highest utility\nin the second pair from 5 to 10\u2014the ordering of expectations\nreverses; now the comparison is between 3 and 5. The significance of\nthis point will become clearer in what follows, when we turn to the\ncomparative evaluation of lotteries and risky choices. An\ninterval-valued or cardinal utility function is necessary for\nevaluating lotteries/risky prospects in a consistent way. By the same\ntoken, in order to construct or conceptualise a cardinal utility\nfunction, one typically appeals to preferences over lotteries.\n(Although see Alt 1936 for a \u201crisk-free\u201d construction of\ncardinal utility, that is, one that does not appeal to lotteries.)\n",
