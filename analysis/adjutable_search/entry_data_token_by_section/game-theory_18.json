Looking Ahead: Areas of Current Innovation\n\nIn 2016 the Journal of Economic Perspectives published a\nsymposium on \u201cWhat is Happening in Game Theory?\u201d Each of\nthe participants noted independently that game theory has become so\ntightly entangled with microeconomic theory in general that the\nquestion becomes difficult to distinguish from inquiry into the moving\nfrontier of that entire sub-discipline, which is in turn the largest\npart of economics as a whole. Thus the boundary between the\nphilosophy of game theory and the philosophy of\nmicroeconomics is now similarly indistinct. Of course, as has been\nstressed, applications of game theory extend beyond the traditional\ndomain of economics, into all of the behavioral and social sciences.\nBut as the methods of game theory have fused with the methods of\nmicroeconomics, a commentator might equally view these extensions as\nbeing exported applications of microeconomics.\n\nFollowing decades of development (incompletely) surveyed in the\npresent article, the past few years have been relatively quiet ones\nwhere foundational innovations of the kind that invite contributions\nfrom philosophers are concerned. Some parts of the original\nfoundations are being newly revisited, however.\n\nvon Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s (1944)\n introduction of game theory divided the inquiry into two parts.\nNoncooperative game theory analyzes cases built on the\nassumption that each player maximizes her own utility function while\ntreating the expected strategic responses of other players as\nconstraints. As discussed above, the specific game to which von\nNeumann and Morgenstern applied their modeling was poker, which is a\nzero-sum game. Most of the present article has focused on the many\ntheoretical challenges and insights that arose from extending\nnoncooperative game theory beyond the zero-sum domain. But this in\nfact develops only half of von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\nclassic. The other half developed cooperative game theory,\nabout which nothing has so far been said here. The reason for this\nsilence is that for most game theorists cooperative game theory is a\ndistraction at best and at worst a technology that confuses\nthe point of game theory by bypassing the aspect of games that mainly\nmakes them potentially interesting and insightful in application,\nnamely, the requirement that equilibria be selected endogenously under\nthe restrictions imposed by\n Nash (1950a).\n This, after all, is what makes equilibria self-enforcing, just in the\nway that prices in competitive markets are, and thus renders them\nstable unless shocked from outside.\n Nash (1953)\n argued that solutions to cooperative games should always be verified\nby showing that they are also solutions to formally equivalent\nnoncooperative games. Nash\u2019s accomplishment in the paper wa the\nanalytical identification of the relevant equivalence. One way of\ninterpreting this was as demonstrating the ultimate redundancy of\ncooperative game theory. \n\nCooperative game theory begins from the assumption that players have\nalready, by some unspecified process, agreed on a vector of\nstrategies, and thus on an outcome. Then the analyst deploys the\ntheory to determine the minimal set of conditions under which the\nagreement remains stable. The idea is typically illustrated by the\nexample of a parliamentary coalition. Suppose that there is one\ndominant party that must be a member of any coalition if it is to\ncommand a majority of parliamentary votes on legislation and\nconfidence. There might then be a range of alternative possible\ngroupings of other parties that could sustain it. Imagine, to make the\nexample more structured and interesting, that some parties will not\nserve in a coalition that includes certain specific others; so the\nproblem faced by the coalition organizers is not simply a matter of\nsumming potential votes. The cooperative game theorist identifies the\nset of possible coalitions. There may be some other parties, in\naddition to the dominant party, that turn out to be needed in every\npossible coalition. Identifying these parties would, in this example,\nreveal the core of the game, the elements shared by all\nequilibria. The core is the key solution concept of cooperative game\ntheory, for which Shapley shared the Nobel prize.\n (Shapley (1953)\n is the great paper.)\n Nash (1953)\n defined the \u201cNash program\u201d as consisting of verifying a\nparticular cooperative equilibrium by showing that noncooperative\nplayers could arrive at it through the sequential bargaining\nprocess specified in\n Nash (1950b),\n and that all outcomes of such bargaining would include the\ncore.\n\nIn light of the example, it is no surprise that political scientists\nwere the primary users of cooperative theory during the years while\nnoncooperative game theory was still being fully developed. It has\nalso been applied usefully by labor economists studying settlement\nnegotiations between firms and unions, and by analysts of\ninternational trade negotiations. We might illustrate the value of\nsuch application by reference to the second example. Suppose that,\ngiven the weight of domestic lobbies in South Africa, the South\nAfrican government will never agree to any trade agreement that does\nnot allow it to protect its automative assembly sector. (This has in\nfact been the case so far.) Then allowance for such protection is part\nof the core of any trade treaty another country or bloc might conclude\nwith South Africa. Knowing this can help the parties during\nnegotiations avoid rhetoric or commitments to other lobbies, in any of\nthe negotiating countries, that would put the core out of reach and\nthus guarantee negotiation failure. This example also helps us\nillustrate the limitations of cooperative game theory. South Africa\nwill have to trade off the interests of some other lobbies to protect\nits automative industry. Which others will get traded off\nwill be a function of the extensive-form play of non-cooperative\nsequential proposals and counter-proposals, and the South African\nbargainers, if they have done their due diligence, must be attentive\nto which paths through the tree throw which specific domestic\ninterests under the proverbial bus. Thus carrying out the cooperative\nanalysis does not relieve them of the need to also conduct the\nnoncooperative analysis. Their game theory consultants might as well\nsimply code the non-cooperative parameters into their Gambit software,\nwhich will output the core if asked.\n\nBut cooperative game theory did not die, or become confined to\npolitical science applications. There has turned out to be a range of\npolicy problems, involving many players whose attributes vary but\nwhose ordinal utility functions are symmetrical, for which\nnoncooperative modeling, while possible in principle, is absurdly\ncumbersome and computationally demanding, but for which cooperative\nmodeling is beautifully suited. That we be dealing with ordinal\nutility functions is important, because in the relevant markets there\nare often no prices. The classic example\n (Gale and Shapley 1962)\n is a marriage market. Abstracting from the scale of individual\nromantic dramas and comedies, society features, as it were, a vast set\nof people who want to form into pairs, but care very much who they end\nup paired with. Suppose we have a finite set of such people. Imagine\nthat the match-maker, or app, first splits the set into two proper\nsubsets, and announces a rule that everyone in subset \\(A\\) will\npropose to someone in subset \\(B\\). Each of those in \\(B\\) who receive\na proposal knows that she is the first choice of someone in \\(A\\). She\nselects her first choice from the proposals she has received and\nthrows the rest back into the pool. Those in \\(A\\) whose initial\nproposals were not accepted now each propose to someone they did not\npropose to before, but possibly including people who are holding\nproposals from a previous round\u2014Nkosi knows that Barbara\npreferred Amalia in round 1, but Nkosi wasn\u2019t part of that\nchoice set and so might displace Amalia in round 2). Provably there\nexists a terminal round after which no further proposals will be made,\nand the matchmaking app will have found the core of the cooperative\ngame because no person \\(i\\) in set \\(B\\) will prefer to pair with\nsomeone from set \\(A\\) who prefers \\(i\\) to whoever is holding that\n\\(A\\)-set dreamboat\u2019s proposal. Everyone from set B will now\naccept the proposal they are holding, and, if the two sets had the\nsame cardinality and everyone would rather pair with someone than pair\nwith no one, then nobody will go off alone.\n\nThis is not a directly applicable model of a marriage market, so there\nis no money to be made in selling the simple matchmaking app described\nabove. The problem is that we have no guarantee that, in the example,\nNkosi and Amalia aren\u2019t one another\u2019s partners of destiny,\nbut cannot get paired because they both began in subset \\(A\\). In game\ntheory textbooks this problem is often finessed by assuming that Set\n\\(A\\) contains men and Set \\(B\\) contains women, and that everyone is\nso committed to heterosexuality that they\u2019d rather pair with\nanyone of the opposite sex than anyone of their own sex. On the other\nhand, the model provides some insight, in the way that models\ntypically do, if we don\u2019t insist on applying it too literally.\nAfter working through it, one sees the logic of facts about society\nthat someone designing a real matchmaking app had better understand:\nthat the app will have to log proposals under consideration but not\nyet accepted, leave people holding proposals under consideration on\nthe market, and remember who has previously rejected whom (without\ncreating a generalised emotional catastrophe by publicly posting this\ninformation). The real app will not be able to reliably find the core\nof the cooperative game, unless the set of people in the market is\nsmall, restricted, and has self-sorted into subsets to at least some\nextent by providing such information as \u201c\\(X\\)-type person seeks\n\\(Y\\)-type person\u201d for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) properties that everyone\nprioritizes. (Are there such properties, at least as an\napproximation?) But the real matchmaking apps seem to work well enough\nto be transforming the way in which most young people now find mates\nin countries with generally available internet access. Relationships\nbetween theoretically idealized and real marriage markets are\ncomprehensively reviewed in\n Chiappori (2017).\n \n\nThe revival of cooperative game theory as site of renewed interest has\noccurred because policy problems have been encountered that, unlike\nthe original toy illustration using the all-straights marriage market,\nsatisfy the model\u2019s crucial assumptions. Leading instances are\nmatching university applicants and universities, and matching people\nneeding organ transplants with donors (see\n Roth 2015).\n In these markets, there is no ambivalence about partitioning the sets\nto be matched. Ordinal preferences are the relevant ones: universities\ndon\u2019t auction off places to the highest bidder (or at least not\nin general), and organs are not for sale (or at least not legally).\nThe models are really applied, and they demonstrably have improved\nefficiency and saved lives.\n\nIt is common in science for models that are practically clumsy fits to\ntheir original problems to turn out to furnish highly efficient\nsolutions to new problems thrown up by technological change. The\ninternet has created an environment for applications of matching\nalgorithms\u2014travellers and flat renters, diners and restaurants,\nstudents and tutors, and (regrettably) socially alienated people and\npurveyors of propaganda and fanaticism\u2014that could have been\ndesigned by a theorist at any time since Shapley\u2019s original\ninnovations, but would previously have been practically impossible to\nimplement. These applications of cooperative game theory are often\napplied conjointly with the noncooperative game theory of auctions\n (Klemperer 2004)\n to drive market designs for goods and services so efficient as to be\nannihilating the once mighty shopping mall in even the suburban USA.\nWhy are hotels more profitable and easily available than was the case\nin all but the largest cities before about 2007? The answer is that\ndynamic pricing algorithms\n (Gershkov and Moldovanu 2014)\n blend matching theory and auction theory to allow hotels, combined\nwith online travel service aggregators, to find customers willing to\npay premium rates for their ideal locations and times, and then fill\nthe remaining rooms with bargain hunters whose preferences are more\nflexible. Airlines operate similar technology. Game theory thus\ncontinues to be one of the 20th-century inventions that is driving\nsocial revolutions in the 21st, and\n Samuelson (2016)\n predicts a coming surge of renewed interest in the deeper mathematics\nof cooperative games and their relationships to noncooperative games.\n\n\nA range of further applications of both classical and evolutionary\ngame theory have been developed, but we have hopefully now provided\nenough to convince the reader of the tremendous, and constantly\nexpanding, utility of this analytical tool. The reader whose appetite\nfor more has been aroused should find that she now has sufficient\ngrasp of fundamentals to be able to work through the large literature,\nof which some highlights are listed below.\n",
