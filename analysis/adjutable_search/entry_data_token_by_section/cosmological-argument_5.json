    "main_text": "Argument for a Non-contingent Cause || Objection 1: The Universe Just Is\n4.2 Objection 1: The Universe Just Is\n\nInterpreting the contingent being in\n premise 1\n as the universe, Bertrand Russell denies that the universe needs an\nexplanation\n (premise 2);\n it just is. Russell, following Hume (1779), contends that since we\nderive the concept of cause from our observation of particular things,\nwe cannot ask about the cause of something like the universe that we\ncannot experience. The universe needs no explanation; it is\n\u201cjust there, and that\u2019s all\u201d (Russell 1948 [1964]:\n175). This view was reiterated by Hawking (1987: 651).\n\nSwinburne replies that \n\n\nuniqueness is relative to description. Every physical object is unique\nunder some description,\u2026 yet all objects within the universe\nare characterized by certain properties, which are common to more than\none object.\u2026 The objection fails to make any crucial\ndistinction between the universe and other objects; and so it fails in\nits attempt to prevent at the outset a rational inquiry into the issue\nof whether the universe has some origin outside itself. (Swinburne\n2004: 134\u201335) \n\n\nWe do not need to experience every possible referent of the class of\ncontingent things to be able to conclude that a contingent thing needs\na cause. \u201cTo know that a rubber ball dropped on a Tuesday in\nWaggener Hall by a redheaded tuba player will fall to the\nground\u201d, I do not need a sample that includes tuba players\ndropping rubber balls at this location (Koons 1997: 202).\n\nMorriston (2002a: 235) responds that although it is true that we do\nnot need to experience every instance to derive a general principle,\nthe universe is a very different thing from what we experientially\nreference when we say that things cannot come into existence without a\ncause. Tuba players are not \u201canything remotely analogous to the\n\u2018initial singularity\u2019 that figures in the Big Bang theory\nof the origin of the universe\u201d.\n\nDefenders of the argument respond that there is a key similarity\nbetween the cosmos and its content, namely, both are contingent.\nHowever, why should we think that the cosmos is contingent? Defenders\nof the view contend that if the components of the universe are\ncontingent, the universe itself is contingent. Russell replies that\nthe move from the contingency of the components of the universe to the\ncontingency of the universe commits the Fallacy of Composition, which\nmistakenly concludes that since the parts have a certain property, the\nwhole likewise has that property. Hence, whereas we legitimately can\nask for the cause of particular things, to require a cause of the\nuniverse based on the contingency of its parts is mistaken.\n\nRussell correctly notes that arguments of the part-whole type can\ncommit the Fallacy of Composition. For example, the argument that\nsince all the bricks in the wall are small, the wall is small, is\nfallacious. Yet it is an informal fallacy of content, not a formal\nfallacy. Sometimes the totality has the same quality as the parts\nbecause of the nature of the parts invoked\u2014the wall is brick\n(composed of baked clay) because it is built of bricks (composed of\nbaked clay). The universe\u2019s contingency, theists argue,\nresembles the second case. If all the contingent things in the\nuniverse, including matter and energy, ceased to exist simultaneously,\nthe universe itself, as the totality of these things, would cease to\nexist. However, if the universe can cease to exist, it is contingent\nand requires an explanation for its existence (Reichenbach 1972: chap.\n5).\n\nIt is worth noting that on the one hand, \u201cuniverse\u201d can\nrefer to what is spatio-temporally connected to us. On the other hand,\n\u201cuniverse\u201d can refer to the totality of contingent beings\n(Oppy 1999: 384). This argument for the contingency of the universe\nfrom its component, contingent parts coalesces these two\nunderstandings in the cosmological argument. \n\nWhether this argument for the contingency of the universe is similar\nto that advanced by Aquinas in his Third Way depends on how one\ninterprets Aquinas\u2019s argument. Aquinas holds that \u201cif\neverything can not-be, then at one time there was nothing in\nexistence\u201d (ST I,q.2,a.3). William Rowe (1975:\n160\u201367) argues that what looks like a similar argument in Samuel\nClarke for the contingency of the universe is fallacious, for even if\nevery contingent being were to fail to exist in some possible world,\nit may be the case that there is no possible world that lacks a\ncontingent being (on Aquinas, see Plantinga 1967: 5\u20136; Kenny\n1969: 56\u201366). That is, although no being would exist in every\npossible world, every possible world could possess at least one\ncontingent being. In such a case, although each being is contingent,\nsomething must exist. Rowe gives the example of a horse race. \n\n\nWe know that although no horse in a given horse race necessarily will\nbe the winner, it is, nevertheless, necessary that some horse in the\nrace will be the winner. (1975: 164)\n\n\nRowe\u2019s example will work only if it is necessary that some horse\nwill finish the race, for otherwise it is possible that all the horses\nbreak a leg and none finishes the race\u2014a condition he notes in\nthat \u201cit is necessary that there exists at least one member of\nthe collection\u201d. So why should we think that something must\nexist, even if it is contingent? Rowe does not say why, but one\nargument given in defense of this thesis is that the existence of one\ncontingent being may be necessary for the nonexistence of some other\ncontingent being. However, although the fact that something\u2019s\nexistence is necessary for the non-existence of something else holds\nfor certain relational properties (for example, the existence of a\nspouse is necessary for a man not to be a bachelor), it is doubtful\nthat something\u2019s existence is necessary for the non-existence of\nsomething else per se, which is what is needed to support the\nargument that denies the contingency of the universe.\n\nHaldane (Smart and Haldane 1996: 132) defends the cogency of\nAquinas\u2019s reasoning on the grounds that Aquinas\u2019s argument\nis fallacious only on a temporal reading, but Aquinas\u2019s argument\nemploys an atemporal ordering of contingent beings. That is, Aquinas\ndoes not hold that over time there would be nothing, but that in the\nper se ordering of causes, if every contingent thing in that order did\nnot exist, there would be nothing.\n\nRowe (1975: 166) develops a different argument to support the thesis\nthat the universe must be contingent. He argues that it is necessary\nthat if God exists, then it is possible that no dependent beings\nexist. Since it is possible that God exists, it is possible that it is\npossible that no dependent beings exist. (This conclusion is licensed\nby the modal principle: If it is necessary that if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nthen if it is possible that \\(p\\), it is possible that \\(q\\).) Hence,\nit is possible that there are no dependent beings; that is, that the\nuniverse is contingent. Rowe takes the conditional as necessarily true\nin virtue of the classical concept of God, according to which God is\nfree to decide whether or not to create dependent beings.\n\nTo avoid any hint of the Fallacy of Composition and to avoid its\ncomplications, Koons (1997: 198\u201399) formulates the argument for\nthe contingency of the universe as a mereological argument. If\nsomething is contingent, it contains a contingent part. The whole and\npart overlap and, by virtue of overlapping, have a common part. Since\nthe part in virtue of which they overlap is wholly contingent, the\nwhole likewise must be contingent.\n\nOne might approach Russell\u2019s thesis regarding the brute fact of\nthe universe from a different direction. If theists are willing to\naccept the existence of God as the necessary being as a brute fact,\nwhy cannot nontheists accept the existence of the universe as a brute\nfact, as a necessary being? Bede Rundle, for example, argues that what\nhas necessary existence is causally independent. Matter has necessary\nexistence, for although it undergoes change as manifested in\nparticular bits of matter, the given volume of matter found in the\nuniverse persists, and as persisting matter/energy does not have or\nneed a cause. This accords with the Principle of Conservation of\nMass-Energy, according to which matter and energy are never lost but\nrather transmute into each other. As indestructible, matter/energy is\nthe necessary being. Consequently, although the material components of\nthe universe are contingent vis-\u00e0-vis their form, they\nare necessary vis-\u00e0-vis their existence. On this\nreading, there is not one but there are many necessary beings, all\ninternal to the universe. Their particular configurations are\ncontingent, but since matter/energy is conserved it cannot be created\nor lost.\n\nInterestingly enough, this approach was anticipated by Aquinas in his\nthird way in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3). Once Aquinas\nconcludes that necessary beings exist, he then goes on to ask whether\nthese beings have their existence from themselves or from another. If\nfrom another, then we have an unsatisfactory infinite regress of\nexplanations. Hence, there must be something whose necessity is\nuncaused. As Kenny points out, Aquinas understands this necessity in\nterms of being unable to cease to exist (Kenny 1969: 48). Although\nAquinas understands the uncaused necessary being to be God, Rundle\ntakes this to be matter/energy itself.\n\nOne question that arises with Rundle\u2019s view is whether there\ncould have been more or less matter/energy than there is. That is, if\nthere is \\(n\\) amount of matter/energy in the world, could there be a\npossible world with \\(+n\\) or \\(-n\\) amounts of matter/energy? We do\nnot know how much matter/energy existed in the first \\(10^{-35}\\)\nseconds of the universe. Even if the universe currently operates\naccording to the principle of the Conservation of Matter and Energy,\nRundle\u2019s thesis depends on the contention that during the very\nearly phase of rapid expansion, a period of time we know little about,\nthis principle held. A second significant problem concerns what\nfollows from the existence of necessary beings. If the matter/energy\nnexus constitutes the necessary being, what causally follows from that\nnexus is itself necessary, and contingency, even in the composing\nrelations within the universe, would disappear. Everything in the\nuniverse would be necessary, which is a disquieting position. Third,\nO\u2019Connor (2004) argues that since the necessary being provides\nthe ultimate explanation, there is no explanation of the\ndifferentiation of the kinds of matter or of contingencies that\nmatter/energy causally undergo, for example, in terms of space-time\nlocation. We will return to the question of the contingency of the\nuniverse below.\n",
