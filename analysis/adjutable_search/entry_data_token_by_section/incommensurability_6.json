According to Feyerabend, he\nfirst discussed his notion of incommensurable concepts with the Kraft\nCircle from 1949\u20131951, while working toward his doctoral thesis\non protocol statements (Feyerabend 1951). The Kraft Circle was a\nstudent group named after Feyerabend\u2019s Ph.D. supervisor Viktor\nKraft, which was modeled after the Vienna Circle of which Kraft had\nbeen a member. Prominent guests such as Elizabeth Anscombe and Ludwig\nWittgenstein attended some meetings (Feyerabend 1978, 108ff.,\n115\u2013116; 1993, 259\u2013260; 1995, 92). Feyerabend traced the\norigins of his conception of incommensurability to those ideas as\nrepresented by \u2018thesis I\u2019 in \u201cAn attempt at a\nrealistic interpretation of experience\u201d (1958a), which is a\ncondensed version of his 1951 doctoral thesis.\n\nIn his (1958a), Feyerabend criticized two conceptions of meaning. He\nargued against the logical positivist idea that the meaning of an\nobservational term is determined by immediate experiences, as well as\nagainst the Wittgensteinian idea that the meaning of an observational\nterm is determined by its use. Instead, Feyerabend argued that the\nmeaning of a term, even an observation term, is determined by its\ntheoretical context, or more precisely, by the theoretical principles\nthat govern its correct use according to our best theories. For\nexample, according to Feyerabend, the correct meaning of the term\n\u2018temperature\u2019 is not determined by its everyday use, but\nby the principles of statistical thermodynamics. On the basis of such\na conception, Feyerabend developed \u2018thesis I\u2019, according\nto which the interpretation of an observation language is determined\nby the theories that we use to explain what we observe, and it changes\nas soon as those theories change (1958a, 163). Feyerabend proceeded to\nargue that when older theories are replaced, the meanings of the\nobservational terms used to test those theories change. Just as in\n(1962), the result is incommensurability: The idea that successive\nscientific theories are conceptually incompatible and consequently\nlogically disjoint due to differences in the meanings of the\nobservation statements used to test them. Feyerabend\u2019s\n\u2018thesis I\u2019 is thus an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. In his (1958a), with this notion of\nincommensurability, Feyerabend challenged an implicit conceptual\nconservativism in logical positivism: The assumptions that theoretical\nterms derive their meaning solely through their connection with\nexperience and that experience itself is a stable (or unchanging)\nfoundation on which theoretical meaning can be based. Instead of such\na bottom-up version of the relation of experience and theoretical\nknowledge, according to which experience determines the meanings of\nour theoretical terms, Feyerabend argued for a top-down version,\naccording to which our best theories determine the meanings that we\nattach to our experiences. According to Feyerabend, experience cannot\nbe taken for granted as some kind of fixed, neutral basis for\ncomparing theories. Rather, it takes on its particular character in\nlight of the theories we bring to it. \n\nAt the time Feyerabend was developing these views, he was working very\nclosely with Karl Popper. There has been much controversy concerning\nFeyerabend\u2019s evolving relationship to Popper, especially given\nits tumultuous trajectory, the revisions Feyerabend made concerning\nhis debts to Popper in the reprints of his original papers (see\nPreston 1997), informal accusations of plagiarism by Popperians (see\nCollodel 2016), and Feyerabend\u2019s subsequent increasingly vocal\ndenials of his debts to Popper (Oberheim 2006, Ch. 3.4). It has\nhowever always been clear that Feyerabend developed his views on\nincommensurability while working as a vocal proponent of Karl\nPopper\u2019s critical rationalist philosophy (Preston 1997, Oberheim\n2006, Collodel 2016), and that there are many different\ninterpretations of the relationships between their ideas. Bschir\n(2015) recently emphasizes just how Popperian Feyerabend\u2019s\nphilosophy was at that time, and casts Feyerabend\u2019s idea of\nincommensurability as a positive extension of many of Popper\u2019s\nviews. Oberheim (2006) argues that incommensurability is exactly the\npoint at which Feyerabend breaks the Popperian framework. Many\n(including Popper) seem to interpret Feyerabend\u2019s conception of\nincommensurability as a rather misguided development (or even\nmisunderstanding) of Karl Popper\u2019s views (see Bschir 2015,\nCollodel 2016), which Feyerabend often repeated, sometimes seemingly\nas if they were his own. In any case, incommensurability marks the\npoint after which Feyerabend and Popper\u2019s philosophies\ndramatically part ways, as they lead to very different conceptions of\nprogress (see Tambolo 2017). \n\nFeyerabend\u2019s route to the idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories was heavily influenced by a number of prominent\nindividuals who had been discussing a wide range of related topics. An\ninvestigation of the source of these ideas reveals some of the\nfounding fathers of the notion of incommensurability in the\ncontemporary history and philosophy of science.\n3.2.1 Progress through meaning change: Pierre Duhem\n\nFeyerabend drew heavily from Duhem\u2019s The Aim and Structure\nof Physical Theory (1954 [1906]) in his development of the notion\nof incommensurability of scientific theories. Many of the main points\nFeyerabend emphasized by calling scientific theories incommensurable\nhad been developed already by Duhem, who had argued that logic is\ninsufficient for determining the outcome of theoretical disputes in\nthe natural sciences, and who documented the difficulties historians\nhave in understanding the development of the natural sciences due to\nmeaning change. Duhem also already highlighted the communication\ndifficulties between proponents of competing scientific theories\nbecause of these differences in meaning. For example, Duhem had\nclaimed that what a physicist states as the result of an experiment is\nnot simply the recital of some observed facts. Rather, it is the\ninterpretation of these facts on the basis of the theories the\nscientist regards as true (1954 [1906], 159). It follows, according to\nDuhem, that in order to understand the meanings that scientists\nascribe to their own statements, it is necessary to understand the\ntheories that they use in order to interpret what they observe. Thus,\nDuhem had stated an early version of Feyerabend\u2019s\nincommensurability thesis. Moreover, Duhem explicitly limited his\ndiscussion to non-instantial, physical theories, as opposed to mere\nexperimental laws. This is very similar to the criteria that marks the\nmost significant difference between Kuhn and Feyerabend\u2019s\ndevelopment of the idea of incommensurability (see Section 4), and\nthat also delimits Einstein\u2019s use of\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 while discussing the problems of theory\ncomparison (see Section 3.2.3).\n\nAfter explaining that the meaning of a term depends on the theory to\nwhich it belongs, and that a consequence of theoretical advance is\nmeaning change, Duhem continued: \u201cIf the theories admitted by\nthis physicist are those we accept, and if we agree to follow the same\nrules in the interpretation of the same phenomena, we speak the same\nlanguage and can understand each other. But that is not always the\ncase. It is not so when we discuss the experiments of a physicist who\ndoes not belong to our school; and it is especially not so when we\ndiscuss the experiments of a physicist separated from us by fifty\nyears, a century, or two centuries\u201d (1954 [1906], 159). Duhem\ncontinued: \u201cHow many scientific discussions there are in which\neach of the contenders claims to have crushed his adversary under the\noverwhelming testimony of the facts! \u2026 How many propositions\nare regarded as monstrous errors in the writings of those who have\npreceded us! We should perhaps commemorate them as great truths if we\nreally wished to enquire into the theories which gave their\npropositions their true meaning\u201d (Duhem 1954 [1906],\n160\u2013161). These passages make the same basic points that both\nFeyerabend and Kuhn made with their claims about incommensurability of\nscientific theories: Because older ideas are misunderstood, as a\nresult of taking them out of their theoretical context, proponents of\nincommensurable scientific theories misunderstand each other, both\nclaiming to have the facts on their side. Kuhn and Feyerabend both\nclaimed that in such a situation, even empirical arguments can become\ncircular (Feyerabend 1965b, 152; Kuhn 1962, 94).\n3.2.2 The square root of 2 and complementarity: Niels Bohr\n\nIn his autobiography, Feyerabend acknowledged Niels Bohr\u2019s\ndirect influence on the development of his notion of\nincommensurability in the 1950s. Feyerabend recalled a conversation in\nwhich Bohr had talked about the discovery that the square root of two\ncannot be an integer or a fraction. According to Feyerabend, Bohr\npresented the event as having led to the extension of a concept of\nnumber that retained some properties of integers and fractions, but\nchanged others; and claimed that the transition from classical to\nquantum mechanics was carried out in accordance with precisely this\nprinciple (1995, 78). Feyerabend also used the notion of\nincommensurability in a publication on Bohr\u2019s complementarity\nthesis, where Feyerabend argued that Bohr\u2019s complementarity\nthesis is an example of an unjustified conceptual conservativism,\ntaking issue with Bohr\u2019s contention that all quantum mechanical\nevidence will always necessarily be expressed in classical terms\n(Feyerabend 1958b). He presented Bohr\u2019s defence of the principle\nof complementarity as based on the conviction that every experience\nmust necessarily make its appearance within the frame of our customary\npoints of view, which is currently that of classical physics. However,\naccording to Feyerabend, even though classical concepts have been\nsuccessful in the past, and even though at the moment it may be\ndifficult, or even impossible, for us to imagine how to replace them,\nit does not follow that the classical framework could not one day be\nsuperseded by an incommensurable rival. Consequently, it does not\nfollow that all our future microscopic theories will have to take the\nnotion of complementarity as fundamental. Instead, according to\nFeyerabend, a theory may be found whose conceptual apparatus, when\napplied to the domain of validity of classical physics, would be just\nas comprehensive and useful as the classical apparatus, without\ncoinciding with it. He claimed that such a situation is by no means\nuncommon, and he used the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nphysics to bolster his point. According to Feyerabend, while the\nconcepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to state all of\nthe facts captured by Newtonian physics, the two sets of concepts are\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d and bear \u201cno logical\nrelations\u201d to each other (1958b, 83; 1961, 388; 1962,\n88\u201389). This is clearly an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. On Feyerabend\u2019s fallibilist view of\nempirical knowledge, no element of our knowledge can be held to be\nnecessary or absolutely certain. In our search for satisfactory\nexplanations, we are at liberty to change any parts of our existing\nknowledge, however fundamental they may seem, including the concepts\nof classical physics.\n3.2.3 \u2018Kant on wheels\u2019 and universal theories: Albert Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein used the term \u2018incommensurable\u2019 to apply\nspecifically to difficulties selecting and evaluating scientific\ntheories before Kuhn and Feyerabend, and there are strong reasons to\nbelieve that Feyerabend\u2019s development of incommensurability was\ndirectly inspired by Einstein\u2019s use of the term (Oberheim 2016).\nIn his \u2018Autobiographical notes\u2019 (1949), Einstein attempted\nto explain that assessing the relative merits of universal physical\ntheories involves making difficult judgments about their\n\u2018naturalness\u2019 that requires making judgments based on the\nreciprocal weighing of incommensurable qualities: \u201cThe second\npoint of view is not concerned with the relation to the material\nobservation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may\nbriefly but vaguely be characterized as the \u2018naturalness\u2019\nor \u2018logical simplicity\u2019 of the premises (of the basic\nconcepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a\nbasis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with\ngreat difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and\nevaluation of theories since time immemorial. The problem here is not\nsimply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent\npremises (if anything like this were at all unequivocally possible),\nbut that of a kind of reciprocal weighing of incommensurable\nqualities\u201d (1949a, 23).\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that these admittedly cryptic\nremarks directly inspired Feyerabend\u2019s use and development of\nthe idea of incommensurability. Although Feyerabend did not cite from\nEinstein (1949) in his (1962), he does cite from Bohr\u2019s paper in\nthat very same edited volume (Schilpp 1949). Moreover, there are\nstriking similarities between Feyerabend and Einstein\u2019s uses of\nthe term. First, both make a distinction between universal theories\nand theories that do not apply to the totality of all physical\nappearances, and then use this distinction to limit the application of\nincommensurability in the same way; i.e., the problem of weighing\nincommensurable qualities in selecting and evaluating theories is\nexplicitly only meant to apply to such universal physical\ntheories, and not just any pair of scientific theories (cf. Feyerabend\n1962a, 28 and Einstein 1949a, 23). Second, Einstein\u2019s\ntheoretical attitude is explicitly a form of neo-Kantianism very much\nlike that of Feyerabend and Kuhn\u2019s. According to Einstein, his\ntheoretical attitude \u201cis distinct from that of Kant only by the\nfact that we do not conceive of the \u2018categories\u2019 as\nunalterable (conditioned by the nature of the understanding) but as\n(in the logical sense) free conventions. They appear to be a\npriori only insofar as thinking without the positing of\ncategories and of concepts in general would be as impossible as is\nbreathing in a vacuum\u201d (Einstein 1949b, 374). This is the same\nbasic perspective that both Kuhn and Feyerabend delineated when they\ndeveloped their ideas of incommensurability. For example, Kuhn says,\n\u201cI go around explaining my own position saying I am a Kantian\nwith moveable categories\u201d (Kuhn 2000 [1995], 264), an idea\ndeveloped in detail by Hoyningen-Huene (1993). As for Feyerabend, he\nset out such a \u2018Kant on wheels\u2019 approach \u2013 to use\nPeter Lipton\u2019s apt expression (Lipton 2001) \u2013 at the\nbeginning of \u2018Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism\u2019\n(1962a). Feyerabend overtly adopted such a neo-Kantian metaphysical\nperspective with changing categories in order to pursue the question:\nIf universal theories determine all of our experiences of the world,\nhow can experience be used to test such theories? Third, the main\nexample Feyerabend used to illustrate that and how incommensurable\ntheories can indeed be compared on the basis of a \u2018crucial\nexperiment\u2019 was Einstein\u2019s quantitative prediction, and\nPerrin\u2019s subsequent confirmation, of Brownian motion, which\nserved as a crucial experiment between classical and statistical\nthermodynamics \u2013 one of only three examples of incommensurable\nscientific theories in Feyerabend (1962a) (cf. Oberheim 2006, 253ff.;\nSirtes and Oberheim 2006). Feyerabend argued that although Brownian\nmotion was already a well-known phenomenon, it became\nevidence for statistical thermodynamics and against classical\nthermodynamics only after the development of the kinetic\ntheory, which was needed to interpret it as such. Even though there\nwas a crucial experiment between these two universal theories, the\ntheories have no common measure as the observations of\nBrownian motion that confirmed statistical thermodynamics were not\ncouched in a neutral observation language. The observations\nonly became evidence after they were interpreted according to\nstatistical theory. Einstein discussed exactly this episode at length\nin his \u2018Autobiographical notes\u2019, where he used the term\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 to apply to difficulties in judging the\nmerits of universal physical theories. Fourth, later Feyerabend often\ndefended his view that there is no fixed scientific method\n(e.g. 1975, 10\u201311) by citing Einstein: \u201cThe external\nconditions which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of\nexperience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in\nthe construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an\nepistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic\nepistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist\u201d\n(Einstein1949b, 683ff.). Although Feyerabend\u2019s development of\nthe idea of incommensurability of scientific theories was received by\nthe philosophic and scientific communities as propagating radical,\nirrationalist ideas about science, he was actually trying to develop\nsomething he found in Einstein. In the preface to the German version\nof Against Method, Feyerabend wrote, \u201cI want to\nemphasize yet again that the views in this book are not new \u2013\nfor physicist like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr they were a\ntriviality. But the ideas of these great thinkers have been distorted\n[by positivist philosophers] beyond recognition\u201d (1983, 12, our\ntranslation).\n3.2.4 The mental and the material\n\nFeyerabend, like Kuhn, explicitly drew from Wolfgang\nK\u00f6hler\u2019s work in Gestalt psychology in the development of\nhis notion of incommensurability. Moreover, K\u00f6hler had already\napplied the notion of incommensurability to scientific theories (see\nSection 2.2.2). K\u00f6hler\u2019s use applies to different areas\nwithin natural science, not to successive scientific theories such as\nin early Kuhn (1962). K\u00f6hler\u2019s use of the term\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 to describe the relationship between the\nconcepts of psychology and physics was a main source of\nFeyerabend\u2019s development of the idea of the incommensurability\n(Oberheim 2005). Feyerabend\u2019s discussion of incommensurability\nin the formulation of the mind-body problem derives directly from\nK\u00f6hler\u2019s claims (Oberheim 2005). However,\nFeyerabend\u2019s (Wittgensteinian) strategy for overcoming the\nincommensurability in the dissolution of philosophical conundrums is\nnot K\u00f6hler\u2019s (Oberheim 2006, 43\u201345). Feyerabend\nsuggested that the insolubility is due to the unwillingness of\nphilosophers of different persuasions to change the deeply entrenched\nmeanings of their terms, and that in this case, the mental should be\nreinterpreted so that it is compatible with materialism (Feyerabend\n1963b).\n",
