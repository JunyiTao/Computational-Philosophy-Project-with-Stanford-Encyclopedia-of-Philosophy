    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Skolemite Skepticism\n3.2 Skolemite Skepticism\n\n\nOver the years, there has been a small but steady stream of\nphilosophers and logicians who have found what we've called the\ntraditional interpretation of Skolem's paper philosophically\ncompelling\u2014i.e., compelling as an independent philosophical\nargument and not just as an interpretation of Skolem's paper. Their\nview, which Michael Resnik has dubbed the \u201cSkolemite\u201d view,\nholds that the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems really do show that\nset-theoretic notions are relative. Indeed, Skolemites are often\nwilling to go a bit further than this and claim that, although a given\nset may be uncountable \u201crelative to the means of expression of an\naxiom system,\u201d every set is countable when considered\nfrom an \u201cabsolute\u201d perspective (Kneale and Kneale 1962;\nGoodstein 1963; Wang 1964; Fine 1968; Thomas 1968, 1971).\n\n\nIn this section, we isolate the key idea behind some classical developments of these\nSkolemite claims, and we then consider some of the responses to them which have\nappeared in the recent literature. (In section 3.3, \nwe consider an interesting new approach to the Skolemite position.) \nWe start with the Skolemite argument\nitself. Very roughly, this argument comes in three steps. First, it\nargues that the algebraic conception of set theory is the only\nrespectable conception for contemporary mathematicians and philosophers\nto adopt. Second, it follows Skolem in arguing that the algebraic\nconception of set theory leads to a relativity of set-theoretic\nnotions. Finally, it extends Skolem's argument to defend the strong\nform of relativity mentioned at the end of the last\nparagraph\u2014i.e., the one under which every set turns out to be\ncountable when it's considered from an \u201cabsolute\u201d\nperspective.\n\n\nFor our purposes, the second step in this argument has already been\nconsidered in enough detail in the context of our discussion of Skolem;\nso we'll simply recap the main points here. On the algebraic conception\nof set theory, basic set-theoretic notions are characterized by looking\nat the model theory of first-order axiomatizations of set theory.\nNotions which remain fixed as we move from model to model\u2014in the\nsense of \u201cfixed\u201d that we discussed in the last\nsection\u2014have an \u201cabsolute\u201d significance; notions\nwhich vary as we move from model to model have only a\n\u201crelative\u201d significance. Given this, the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems show that the notions of countability\nand uncountability will in fact vary as we move from model to model. On\nthe algebraic conception of set theory, therefore, these notions are\nonly\n \u201crelative.\u201d[36]\n\n\nThis brings us to steps 1 and 3 in the Skolemite argument. Step 1 is\nwhere different versions of this argument display the most variability.\nIn some cases, step 1 is simply presupposed, so it's hard to get a feel\nfor how the underlying argument is really supposed to go\n(Kneale and Kneale 1962; Goodstein 1963; Wang 1964). In other cases,\nit's suggested that any rejection of the algebraic\nconception\u2014and, in particular, any move to simply take\nexpressions like \u201call sets\u201d or \u201cis really\nuncountable\u201d at face value\u2014amounts to falling back on an\nunacceptably naive form of \u201cPlatonism\u201d (Fine 1968; Thomas\n1968, 1971; Klenk 1976). In still other cases, Skolemites follow\nSkolem's lead and appeal to the set-theoretic paradoxes to bolster\ntheir rejection of Platonism; they then suggest that the abandonment of\nPlatonism leaves the algebraic conception of axiomatization as the only\nviable alternative (Klenk 1976).\n\n\nThere's another strategy that's available here: some authors have\ndefended the Skolemite position by using other puzzles about\nthe interpretation of mathematical language\u2014i.e., puzzles other\nthan Skolem's Paradox\u2014to motivate the initial move from Platonism\nto the algebraic conception. So, for instance, Klenk has argued that we\ncan parley one of Benacerraf's classical puzzles\u2014that presented\nin Benacerraf 1965\u2014into this kind of an argument (Klenk\n 1976).[37]\nSimilarly, Wright has appealed to Wittgensteinian considerations\nconcerning the relationship between meaning and use to motivate a\nlimited Skolemite position (Wright 1985). Finally, several authors have\nsuggested that the whole development of twentieth-century set theory\ntells in favor of the algebraic approach\u2014after all, the entire\nhistory of the subject has been a move away from naive\napproaches to set theory and towards formal axiomatization\n(and especially first-order axiomatization). See, Klenk 1976 for this\nlast kind of analysis.\n\n\nTurn, now, to the third step in the Skolemite argument. The\nmathematical theorem which underlies this third step is clear. Let\n\u03c6(x) be a formula which is supposed to define a\nunique set\u2014e.g., \u201cx\u2009 is the power set of\n\u03c9\u201d or \u201cx\u2009 is the set of real\n numbers.\u201d[38]\n Then we can find a model M\n \u22a8\u00a0ZFC and an element m\n\u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03c6(m) and\n{m\u2032 \u2208 M\n\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\nm\u2032 \u2208 m\u2009} is only countable. So, if\nwe're willing to concede that all it takes to be, say, the\npower set of \u03c9 is to satisfy the relevant defining formula in\nsome model of set theory, then we can make sense of the claim that at\nleast one instance of the power set of \u03c9 is \u201creally\u201d\ncountable. If we are willing make the further assumption that it only\ntakes one bijection to one such instance of the power\nset of \u03c9 to render the power set itself \u201cabsolutely\u201d\ncountable, then we can understand the Skolemite's strong claim about\nabsolute countability. Of course, neither of these two final moves\nfollows in the strict sense from the algebraic conception of\naxiomatization; but they are both moves which a proponent of the\nalgebraic conception might well find congenial.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us the basic structure of the various Skolemite\narguments. Before turning to some responses to these arguments which\nhave appeared in the recent literature, it is important to be clear\nabout the role that Skolem's Paradox itself can and cannot play in\nthese arguments. At times, it appears as though some Skolemites think\nthat the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems by themselves show\nthat there's a problem with our ordinary conception of sets: so, the\ntheorems show that set-theoretic notions are relative, relativity is\nincompatible with our ordinary conception of sets, and so our ordinary\nconception of sets has to be abandoned (Kneale and Kneale 1962;\nGoodstein 1963). It should be clear from section 2, however, that this\nline of argument has no chance of succeeding. The analysis in section 2\nshows that those of us who are willing to take a naively realistic\nattitude towards set theory\u2014or, for that matter, those who take\nmore sophisticated stances which rest on the iterative conception of\nsets and/or some form of second-order structuralism\u2014will have no\nproblems with Skolem's Paradox. Hence, the paradox itself\ncannot force us to abandon our ordinary conception of sets.\n\n\nInstead, the successful Skolemite needs to follow the basic approach\nset out at the beginning of this section. He begins with an independent\nargument for the algebraic conception of set theory\u2014i.e., an\nargument which would lead us to abandon the ordinary conception of sets\nin favor of the algebraic conception, and (crucially) an argument which\ndoes not itself turn on issues relating to Skolem's Paradox. Once this\npreliminary argument is complete, the Skolemite can then proceed to\nuse the algebraic conception of sets (plus, of course, the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems) to defend the claims about\nset-theoretic relativity that are made in steps 2 and 3 of his\nargument.\n\n\nTwo further comments about this approach are in order. First, we\nshould note that this approach provides the Skolemite with a response\nto the kinds of arguments that we made in section 2. In particular, it\nallows him to challenge our all-too-naive use of expressions like\n\u201cthe ordinary English understanding of\n\u2018\u2208,\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201cthe real members of\n m\u02c6,\u201d\n \u201cquantifiers which range over the\nwhole set-theoretic universe,\u201d etc. Given an independent\nargument against the ordinary conception of sets, the Skolemite is not\ngoing to be too impressed with a \u201csolution\u201d to Skolem's\nParadox which turns on the naive employment of these kinds of\nexpressions. See Thomas 1968, 1971; Klenk 1976.\n\n\nSecond, we should note that, although this approach requires the\nSkolemite to start with an independent argument against our ordinary\nconception of sets, it need not render the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems themselves completely superfluous. After all, it's still a\ntheorem that set-theoretic notions like countability and\nuncountability come out relative on the algebraic conception. This\nisn't something which happens to all set-theoretic notions\u2014e.g.,\n\u201cx is the empty set\u201d or\n\u201cx has seventeen members\u201d\u2014and it's\nnot something which just drops out from the algebraic conception of\naxiomatization.\n\n\nThat being said, this is a place where the Skolemite has to be\nrather careful. Unless the considerations raised in step 1 of his\nargument are pretty closely tied to the details of the algebraic\nconception\u2014and tied in a way which makes that conception\ngenuinely attractive as a positive understanding of set\ntheory\u2014the Skolemite's larger argument is threatened with a\ncertain kind of rhetorical triviality. After all, once the Skolemite\nhas the resources to push us to the algebraic conception of set\ntheory\u2014as in step 1 of his argument\u2014then he also has the\nresources to directly undermine our ordinary conception of\nsets, and to do so without bringing Skolem's Paradox itself into the\ndiscussion. If this is right, then the Skolemite's larger argument\ncould well amount to criticizing ordinary set-theoretic notions for\nbeing \u201crelative\u201d in a rhetorical context in which the\nSkolemite has already presented far stronger criticisms of\nthese notions in the course of defending the initial step in his\nargument. That would be more than a little bit\n awkward.[39]\n\n\nTo avoid this kind of awkwardness, we think that the Skolemite\nshould frame his argument, less as a criticism of our ordinary\nset-theoretic notions, and more as a constructive analysis of the\nalgebraic conception of set theory. That is, he should focus primarily\non defending the algebraic conception of set theory as an\nindependently plausible conception of set theory (step 1), and\nhe should then present set-theoretic relativity as simply a new and\nsurprising consequence of this positive conception (steps 2\u20133).\nThis argumentative strategy leaves room for the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems to do some real philosophical work\u2014e.g., as described\ntwo paragraphs ago. It also gives step 1 a tighter\u2014and a more\nconstructive\u2014focus. On this reading, step 1 serves mainly to\nhighlight the positive virtues of the algebraic conception; criticizing\nordinary set-theoretic notions is (at best) a secondary\n concern.[40]\n(See section 3.3 for more on this kind of point.)\n\n\nThis brings us to the criticisms of the Skolemite argument which\nhave appeared in the recent literature. Three general forms of\ncriticism are worth mentioning. First, a number of authors have\nresponded to the Skolemite argument by simply slowly and carefully\nunpacking the mathematics surrounding the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems so as to show that these theorems themselves cause no problems\nfor even quite naive understandings of set theory (Resnik 1966;\nBenacerraf 1985; Bays 2007a). While this kind of response is effective\nagainst the simplistic version of the Skolemite argument that we\ndiscussed six paragraphs ago, it does very little against the more\nsophisticated arguments that we're currently considering\u2014i.e.,\narguments which start with an independent criticism of such\nnaive\n understandings.[41]\n Given this, and given that we've already\ndiscussed this kind of response in some detail in section 2, we'll say\nno more about it here.\n\n\nSecond, several authors have responded to the Skolemite argument by\ndirectly criticizing the algebraic conception of set theory and\ndefending more ordinary and intuitive understandings of set-theoretic\nlanguage (Myhill 1967; Resnik 1969; Hart 1970; Benacerraf 1985). There\nare three issues which we should highlight here. First, it's hard to\nsee how the algebraic conception could provide a general\naccount of mathematical language, given that the conception itself\nseems to presuppose an intuitive background theory in which to\nformulate and prove our model-theoretic results (e.g., the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems). This issue is exacerbated when we\nfocus on the third step in the Skolemite argument, since that step\nseems to require both an absolute account of the natural numbers and an\nabsolute account of enumeration in order to formulate its conception of\n\u201cabsolute countability\u201d (see Resnik 1969; Benacerraf 1985;\nand Shapiro 1991; see Thomas 1971; Klenk 1976; and Bellotti 2006 for\nsome concerns about this line of argument).\n\n\nNote, here, that these initial points seem to tell against using any\ncompletely general criticism of mathematical realism to push\npeople towards the algebraic conception of axioms. On the surface,\nafter all, any sufficiently general criticism of realism would apply to\nthe Skolemite's own model theory as much as it does to classical set\ntheory. It's doubtful, therefore, whether the Skolemite can really\nappeal to, say, simple worries about \u201cplatonism\u201d or about\nour epistemic access to mathematical objects to motivate a full-blown\nSkolemite position. In short: the very fact that Skolemite arguments\nturn on substantial mathematical theorems seems to force the\nSkolemite into accepting that some parts of mathematics are not subject\nto Skolemite relativity. (In addition to the references in the last\nparagraph, see Bays 2001; Bellotti 2005; and Bays 2007b for discussion\nof this kind of point in the context of Putnam's model-theoretic\nargument.)\n\n\nOf course, this first argument leaves open the possibility that set\ntheory is a special case\u2014that, even though some branches of\nmathematics, like number theory and analysis, should be understood\nabsolutely, set theory, like group theory and topology, should still be\nunderstood algebraically. Unfortunately, there are a number of obvious\ndifferences between the practice of set theory and that of more-clearly\nalgebraic subjects like group theory. So, for instance, mathematicians\ntend to treat the axioms of set theory as being less fixed\nthan those of group theory or topology. In set theory, mathematicians\nsometimes raise the question as to whether the ZFC axioms are\ncorrect\u2014i.e., they talk as though there is an intuitive notion of\nset against which the ZFC axioms might be checked and found wanting. In\ngroup theory and topology, by contrast, it simply makes no sense to\ntalk about \u201cintuitive notions\u201d which could diverge from the\nnotion specified by the relevant\n axioms.[42]\n In a similar vein, set theorists sometimes\ndebate whether we should add new axioms to the standard axioms of set\ntheory\u2014e.g., large cardinal axioms, or axioms like V=L, or even\njust axioms like Con(ZFC). In contrast, no one would dream of making\nadditions to the axioms of group theory or topology. In this sense,\nthen, an algebraic approach to set theory is revisionary of\nset-theoretic practice in a way that an algebraic approach to group\ntheory is not.\n\n\nFinally, even if we do accept an algebraic conception of set\ntheory\u2014perhaps because we have a larger commitment to some kind\nof structuralist philosophy of mathematics\u2014it's unclear why this\ncommitment requires us to limit ourselves to first-order\naxiomatizations of set theory. After all, many of the most successful\ninstances of the algebraic approach to axiomatization\u2014e.g., the\n19th-century results that arithmetic and analysis can be given\ncategorical axiomatizations\u2014turn on using a second-order\nbackground logic. And, as we noted in section 2, second-order versions\nof ZFC do not give rise to Skolem's Paradox. Hence, it's not enough for\nSkolemites to defend an algebraic approach to the\naxiomatization of set theory, they need to show that a\nfirst-order algebraic approach is the right way to go. See\nHart 1970 and Shapiro 1991 for developments of this line of\nargument.\n\n\nSo much, then, for general criticisms of the algebraic\nconception of axiomatization and its role in the Skolemite argument. We\nturn now to a more-focused objection to the third step in that\nargument. For the sake of argument, let's grant that the Skolemite has\nshown that our set-theoretic notions are relative and that, for every\nkind of set that we can define with a formula, there is an\ninstance of this kind of set which is only countable. So, there is\na countable instance of the power set of \u03c9, a\ncountable instance of the real numbers,\n etc.[43]\n Still, it's unclear why\nthis shows that every set is \u201cabsolutely\u201d\ncountable. After all, just as the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem shows\nthat we can find countable instances of all these sets, the\nUpward-L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem shows that we can also find\nuncountable instances.\n\n\nGiven this, a number of critics have suggested that Skolemites face\ntwo explanatory burdens and that, so far, no Skolemite has managed to\nmeet these burdens. First, the Skolemite needs to explain how we can\nidentify sets across different models\u2014i.e., why we should\nconsider the various different objects which satisfy\n\u201cx is the power set of \u03c9\u201d in\ndifferent models of set theory to be \u201cthe same set.\u201d Note\nthat some such identification is essential if the Skolemite is going to\nstart with a proof of the countability of one of these objects and then\nuse this proof to argue for the absolute countability of all the others\n(Resnik 1966). Second, the Skolemite needs to explain his preference\nfor countable sets. Even if the Skolemite can identify countable and\nuncountable \u201cinstances\u201d of a given set, he needs to explain\nwhy this identification leads to the conclusion that all sets are\n\u201cabsolutely countable\u201d rather than to the conclusion that\nall sets are \u201cabsolutely uncountable\u201d (Resnik 1966;\nBenacerraf 1985).\n\n\nThese, then, are the main criticisms of the Skolemite position which\nhave appeared in the literature. To treat them more thoroughly would,\nunfortunately, require us to dive pretty deeply into questions\nconcerning, e.g., the status of our informal understanding of\nset-theoretic language, the legitimacy of second-order quantification,\nand the identity conditions associated with mathematical objects in\nstructuralist philosophies of mathematics. Exploring these\nissues would take us pretty far away from Skolem's Paradox itself. For\na recent survey of some of the relevant literature here, see Bellotti\n2006.\n",
