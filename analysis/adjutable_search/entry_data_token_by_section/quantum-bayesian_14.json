    "main_text": "QBism and Pragmatism\n3. QBism and Pragmatism\n\nMost QBists are physicists rather than philosophers. But Fuchs locates\nQBism in the tradition of classical American pragmatism (see entry on\n pragmatism).\n While quoting Peirce and referring to Dewey, Fuchs (2011; 2016, Other\nInternet Resources) acknowledges especially the influence of William\nJames\u2019s ideas of pure experience and an open and pluralistic\nuniverse in which \u201cnew being comes in local spots and patches\nwhich add themselves or stay away at random, independently of the\nrest\u201d (2016, 9, Other Internet Resources). Mermin\u2019s CBist\nintroduction of the \u201cNow\u201d into physics and Fuchs\u2019s\nchoice of title for his 2014 (Other Internet Resources) both show\naffinity with James\u2019s reaction against what he called the\nblock-universe (see entry\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n Moreover, they both credit the influence on QBism of Niels Bohr. Bohr\nhimself never acknowledged pragmatist influences on his view of\nquantum theory. But in a late\n interview[5]\n he expressed enthusiasm for James\u2019s conception of\nconsciousness, and he was almost certainly acquainted with some of\nJames\u2019s ideas by the Danish philosopher H\u00f8ffding, a\nfriend and admirer of James.\n",
