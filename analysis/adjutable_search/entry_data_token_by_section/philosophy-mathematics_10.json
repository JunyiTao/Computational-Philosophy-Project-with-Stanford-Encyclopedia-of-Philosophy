    "main_text": "Platonism || Benacerraf\u2019s Epistemological Problem\n3.4 Benacerraf\u2019s Epistemological Problem\n\nBenacerraf formulated an epistemological problem for a variety of\nplatonistic positions in the philosophy of science (Benacerraf 1973).\nThe argument is specifically directed against accounts of mathematical\nintuition such as that of G\u00f6del. Benacerraf\u2019s argument\nstarts from the premise that our best theory of knowledge is the\ncausal theory of knowledge. It is then noted that according to\nplatonism, abstract objects are not spatially or temporally localized,\nwhereas flesh and blood mathematicians are spatially and temporally\nlocalized. Our best epistemological theory then tells us that\nknowledge of mathematical entities should result from causal\ninteraction with these entities. But it is difficult to imagine how\nthis could be the case.\n\nToday few epistemologists hold that the causal theory of knowledge is\nour best theory of knowledge. But it turns out that Benacerraf\u2019s\nproblem is remarkably robust under variation of epistemological\ntheory. For instance, let us assume for the sake of argument that\nreliabilism is our best theory of knowledge. Then the problem becomes\nto explain how we succeed in obtaining reliable beliefs about\nmathematical entities.\n\nHodes has formulated a semantical variant of Benacerraf\u2019s\nepistemological problem (Hodes 1984). According to our currently best\nsemantic theory, causal-historical connections between humans and the\nworld of concreta enable our words to refer to physical entities and\nproperties. According to platonism, mathematics refers to abstract\nentities. The platonist therefore owes us a plausible account of how\nwe (physically embodied humans) are able to refer to them. On the face\nof it, it appears that the causal theory of reference will be unable\nto supply us with the required account of the \u2018microstructure of\nreference\u2019 of mathematical discourse.\n",
