Introduction\n\n\u2018Natural deduction\u2019 designates a type of logical system\ndescribed initially in Gentzen (1934) and Ja\u015bkowski (1934). A\nfundamental part of natural deduction, and what (according to most\nwriters on the topic) sets it apart from other proof methods, is the\nnotion of a \u201csubproof\u201d \u2014 parts of a proof in which\nthe argumentation depends on temporary premises (hypotheses\n\u201cassumed for the sake of argument\u201d). In the\nFitch-Ja\u015bkowski presentation of natural deduction, subproofs are\nmarked off in a way that makes them immediately visible in a written\nproof; with other presentations it takes a bit more work to pick out\nthe formulas forming a subproof. That is, we are justified in\nconcluding without any assumption that \u201cif A then\nX\u201d, i.e., \\((A\\rightarrow X)\\), because we could create this\nsubproof. This assumption-making can occur also within some\npreviously-made assumption, so there needs to be some method that\nprevents mixing up of embedded conclusions. That example is but one of\na number of different types of \u201csubordinate proof\u201d types\nthat can be found in textbooks as well as in research contributions.\nIn the Suppes-Lemmon style of proof \u2014 which is often or even\nusually called a style of natural deduction \u2014 the proofs can and\nprobably should instead be seen as operating with sequents, and so (by\nour stipulative definition) is not really a system of natural\ndeduction, but (i) it resembles other forms of natural deduction (as\nin Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculi \\(\\mathcal{NJ}\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{NK}\\)) by having elimination rules, rather than the rules\nfor the introduction of formulas on the left side of sequence (in this\nit mirrors Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculi), and (ii) when one works\nwith it in practice it feels like natural deduction. (We discuss this\nstyle in Section 4.) Various of these different styles will be\nillustrated in this survey.\n\n\u2018Natural deduction\u2019 also designates the type of reasoning\nthat these logical systems embody, and it is the intuition of very\nmany writers on the notion of meaning\u2014meaning generally, but\nincluding in particular the meaning of the connectives behind active\nreasoning\u2014is based on the claim that meaning is defined\nby use. Much has been written in this area that categorizes\nsome important aspects of formal logic as manifesting this feature\nalso, and in particular that it is most clearly at the fore in natural\ndeduction.\n\nAlthough the first formal descriptions of natural deduction were in\n1934, its acceptance and popularity weren\u2019t manifested until the\n1950s and 1960s when a huge number of elementary logic textbooks were\npublished, different ones using variations on the central ideas of the\nfoundational works from\n 1934.[1]\n We shall only briefly touch on a few of the ways that the logical\nsystems of these elementary textbooks differ from the original works,\nbut it should be noted that some of these differences are thought (by\nsome scholars) to be so important as to distinguish \u201ctrue\nnatural deduction\u201d from some other types of formalisms that are\nsometimes also called natural deduction. (We describe such a\nsystem-wide difference in\n \u00a74.)\n\nAnd our mention of other types of logical systems brings to the fore\nthe topic of certain other classes of logical formalisms, some of\nwhich are already described in the original (Gentzen 1934), and\nanother in Gentzen (1936). We will use some space discussing various\nimportant distinctions among these related theories. Some modern\ntheorists call them all \u2018natural deduction\u2019 while others\n(including one of us) think of them as distinct theories of logic.\n\nOf course, most logicians and logic-oriented philosophers of language\nare not especially interested in the various formalisms of elementary\nlogic, but rather in some metatheoretic properties that different\nlogics manifest. We consider here a number of places where natural\ndeduction is thought to be superior to (or at least, different from)\nvarious other formalisms of the underlying logic. Some of these\ndifferences are purely formal in nature (such as Normalization and\nHarmony) while others concern issues of The One True\n Logic[2],\n Inferentialism, and various other philosophical positions. We will\nalso look at extensions of natural deduction beyond intuitionistic and\nclassical logics, such as modal and relevance logics. Some of these\nfeatures are discussed in the original Gentzen works, but much later\nresearch has shed further light on the intricacies involved.\n2. Natural Deduction Systems\n\nNatural deduction allows especially perspicuous comparison of\nclassical with intuitionistic logic, as formulations of the two logics\ncan be given with only small changes to the set of rules. Gentzen,\nJa\u015bkowski, and Fitch all noted this in their early\n publications.[3]\n\nIn this section we briefly describe both the original systems of\n Gentzen[4]\n and Ja\u015bkowski as well as a very few of the influential systems\nthat have been introduced in the more recent heyday of elementary\nlogic textbooks.\n2.1 Gentzen and Ja\u015bkowski\n\nGentzen\u2019s method for natural deduction\u2014his \\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\ncalculi\u2014were given in a tree format with occurrences of formulas\nappearing as nodes of the tree. The root of the tree is the formula to\nbe proved, and the \u201csuppositions\u201d are at the leaves of the\ntree. The following is such a proof tree for the theorem\n\n\\[(((p\\rightarrow q) \\land (\\neg r\\rightarrow \\neg q))\\rightarrow(p\\rightarrow r))\\]\n\n\nin Gentzen\u2019s \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) calculus. (As an aid in following\nthis proof, it should be mentioned that Gentzen\u2019s main rule for\nindirect proofs first generated \\(\\bot\\) (\u201cthe absurd\nproposition\u201d) from the two parts of a contradiction, and then\ngenerated the negation of the relevant\n assumption.[5]\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Gentzen style proof. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe lines indicate a transition from the upper formula(s) to the one\njust beneath the line, using the rule of inference indicated on the\nright edge of the line. (We might replace these horizontal lines with\nvertical or splitting lines to more clearly indicate tree-branches,\nand label these branches with the rule of inference responsible, and\nthe result would look even more tree-like). Gentzen uses the numerals\non the leaves as a way to keep track of subproofs. Here the antecedent\nof the conditional to be proved is entered (twice, since there are two\nseparate things to do with it) with the numeral \u20181\u2019, the\nantecedent of the consequent of the main theorem is entered with\nnumeral \u20182\u2019, and the formula \\(\\neg r\\) (to be used in the\nreductio part of the proof) is entered with numeral \u20183\u2019.\nWhen the relevant \u201cscope changing\u201d rule is applied\n(indicated by citing the numeral of that branch as part of the\ncitation of the rule of inference, in parentheses) this numeral gets\ncrossed out, indicating that this subproof is finished.\n\nCompletely independent from Gentzen, Ja\u015bkowski (1934) described\ntwo methods. Of interest to us in this article is the one found in a\nlengthy footnote, where he describes a pictorial method that he had\nannounced\n earlier.[6]\n The pictorial method involved the drawing of \u201cboxes\u201d\naround portions of a proof, to indicate that the enclosed formulas are\n\u201cconsidered as following only under a\nsupposition\u201d\u2014or as we might say, they are a subproof that\nfollows from an assumed\n premise.[7]\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Ja\u015bkowski style proof.\n[An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe fundamental notion of making a supposition (= assumption) and\nseeing where it leads is indicated in Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s by the\nintroduction of a box, the first line of which is the supposition and\nall the consequences of that assumption are retained inside that box.\nMoreover, further suppositions can be made within the\nprevious box by generating a subordinate box. The fundamental rule of\nConditionalization is that a conditional whose antecedent is the\nsupposition and whose consequent is the final line inside the box can\nbe entered as the next line outside the box. Once a box has\nbeen constructed, no formula within it can be used to justify any line\nof the proof outside of the box. A similar rule of supposition is the\nReductio, or Negation Introduction, rule, where two\ncontradictory lines inside the same box can trigger a completion\n(closing) of the box and the unnegated supposition as the next line\noutside the box. A theorem of the language is a formula that can be\ngenerated by these rules and is outside of all boxes. As with\nthe Gentzen proof, we see that Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s use of the rule\nReductio ad Absurdum deletes a negation sign from the\nassumption. This is Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s way to move from\nintuitionistic logic to classical logic. (Again, see\n note 23\n for methods of strengthening intuitionistic logic to classical\nlogic.)\n2.2 Modern Versions of Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s Method\n\nIn our future examples of natural deduction we will employ a more\nmodern version of Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s method: that of Fitch (1952).\nVariants of this method are followed by most modern elementary\ntextbooks, although there is one type of exception that is followed by\nseveral authors. We look at this exception shortly, in\n \u00a74.\n\nFitch\u2019s method, like Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s, is graphical and\ninvolves a method of indicating Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s boxes and\nsuppositions. The rules are of two types: those that refer to previous\nlines but have the new formula within the same box as the previous\nlines, and those that allow a box to be ended, with the new formula in\nthe next outer box. But rather than drawing an entire box, the Fitch\nmethod uses just the left side of the box, and rather than\nsuppositions being merely the first line of a new box, the Fitch\nmethod indicates them by entering them just above a short horizontal\nline.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fitch style proof. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe rules employed in this\n proof[8]\n illustrate an aspect of natural deduction that is thought (by some)\nto be very important in the metatheory of natural deduction: that each\nconnective of the language should have an introduction rule and an\nelimination rule\u2014or as this is sometimes put, the entire logic\nshould be organized into pairs of Introduction and Elimination\n(Int-Elim for short) rules for each logical operator. We discuss this\nfeature in\n \u00a75\n on normalization. We note here that Fitch\u2019s exact formulation\ndoes not meet this Int-Elim requirement because it has, in addition to\nthe usual rules, Int-Elim rules for certain combinations of\nconnectives, namely the negations of connectives. Thus there are\nInt-Elim rules for such formula types as \\(\\neg(\\phi\\land\\psi)\\),\n\\(\\neg(\\phi\\lor\\psi)\\) and \\(\\neg(\\phi\\rightarrow\\psi)\\):\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nFigure 4: Fitch-Style Negative\nElim-Rules: Negative-Int rules are the inverses of these. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis affects arguments about the semantic significance of natural\ndeduction, and slightly complicates some metatheoretic developments,\nbut Fitch\u2019s negative Int-Elim rules are paired in a way that\nsuffices for analogues of many standard results (as we discuss in\n \u00a75.3).\n It might be noted that Gentzen\u2019s presentation tends to be\npreferred by writers on technical proof theory, but Fitch\u2019s\npresentation by writers of elementary textbooks. People who have\nlearned one presentation of natural deduction often initially find\nothers opaque, but with experience the \u201ctranslation\u201d\nbecomes routine. The transformation of a proof in one style of natural\ndeduction into one in another is a simple matter of cutting and\npasting (or perhaps, since Gentzen\u2019s tree-form presentation\noften requires multiple copies of some formulas, cutting,\nphotocopying, and pasting). But however natural deduction systems are\npresented, they have rules of two types. There are rules of\ninference, by which a formula may be inferred from one or more\nprevious formulas. (Some systems also allow \u201czero-premiss\u201d\nrules, by which formulas of specified kinds can be written anywhere\ndesired: in effect, logical axiom schemes.) The typically rules of\ninference include these:\n\n\\(\\land\\)-Introduction: a conjunction may be inferred from its two\n conjuncts.[9]\n\\(\\land\\)-Elimination: a conjunct may be inferred from a\n conjunction.[10]\n\\(\\lor\\)-Introduction: a disjunction may be inferred from either\n disjunct.[11]\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-Elimination: \\(B\\) may be inferred from the two\npremises \\(A\\) and \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\)\n\\(\\neg\\)-Elimination: an arbitrary formula, \\(B\\), may be inferred\nfrom a pair of contradictory premises, \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\n A\\).[12]\n\n\nThere are also what Ja\u015bkowski calls rules of\nsupposition, in which conclusions are inferred, not from earlier\nformulas, but from the presence of one or more subproofs of a\nspecified kind. Typically (described in Fitch-style terminology) these\ninclude:\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-Introduction: \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) may be asserted\nafter a subproof having \\(A\\) as its hypothesis and and \\(B\\) as a\nline.\n\\(\\lor\\)-Elimination: an arbitrary formula \\(C\\) may be asserted\nafter three items: a disjunction, \\((A\\lor B)\\), a subproof, having\n\\(A\\) as its hypothesis, with \\(C\\) as a line, and a subproof, having\n\\(B\\) as its hypothesis, with \\(C\\) as a line.\n\\(\\neg\\)-Introduction: a negation, \\(\\neg A\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, with \\(A\\) as its hypothesis, containing a pair of\ncontradictory formulas, \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\), as\n lines.[13]\n\n\nJust as, in axiomatic formulations of logic (\u201cFrege\nsystems\u201d or \u201cHilbert-style\u201d systems), different\nchoices of axioms are possible for a particular logic, different sets\nof rules can be chosen in formulating a natural deduction system. In\nparticular, one or more rules of supposition can, in the presence of\nothers, be replaced by inference rules. Thus, for example, it is\npossible to have\n \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I[14]as\n the only rule of supposition, any others being replaced by inference\nrules having, among their premisses, conditionals summarizing the\nsubproofs of the original rules. (Elementary students may find it\neasier to learn inference rules than to learn suppositional rules, in\nwhich case this sort of system may be a rational choice for elementary\ntextbooks.) Alternatively, \\(\\neg\\)-I may be taken as the only rule of\nsupposition, \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I being replaced by a rule allowing\n\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) to be inferred from \\(\\neg(A\\land\\neg B)\\). Other\nchoices are also possible. D\u2019Agostino, Gabbay, and Modgil (2020)\npresent a very elegant system for Classical propositional logic in\nwhich the only rule of supposition is an \u201cexcluded middle\u201d\nrule: a formula may be asserted if it is derived in each of a pair of\nsubproofs, the hypothesis of one being the negation of the hypothesis\nof the other.\n3. Natural Deduction and Quantifiers\n\nRules for the quantifiers are necessarily more complicated, but those\nstandardly used can be seen as natural (although analogical)\nextensions of the rules for \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\).\n3.1 Quantifier Basics\n\nThinking of a universal quantification as (sort of) a conjunction with\none conjunct for each element in the domain quantified over, we\nnaturally get a rule of\n\n\\(\\forall\\)-E:\nan arbitrary instance, \\(A(t)\\), may be inferred from a universal\nquantification, \\(\\forall\n x(A(x))\\).[15]\n\n\nThe corresponding introduction rule is less obvious: the domain might\nbe infinite, and only finitely many conjuncts can occur in a formal\nproof! We proceed more circuitously. First, we assume an\n\u201calphabet\u201d of special terms (variously called free\nvariables, parameters, dummy constants,\u2026). Next, we define\na special sort of subproof, the subproof general with respect\nto a particular term from this alphabet: in Fitch\u2019s\nnotation, these subproofs are marked with an occurrence of the\nrelevant term beside the top of its vertical line. These subproofs are\nsubject to a restriction on reiteration: a formula containing a\nparticular one of the special terms cannot be reiterated into a\nsubproof general with respect to that term. Then we may state the\nrule\n\n\\(\\forall\\)-I:\na universal quantification, \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, general with respect to a special term, \\(a\\),\nhaving no hypothesis, containing the instance of the quantification\nfor that term,\n \\(A(a)\\).[16]\n\n\nThe soundness of such a rule is easy to see. The restriction on\nreiteration into general subproofs means that no special assumptions\non the term \\(a\\) can be smuggled into a subproof general with respect\nto \\(a\\). The subproof, therefore, can be seen as displaying a schema\nby which (pretending for the moment that every element in the domain\nhas a\n name[17])\n proofs could be constructed of an instance of the quantification for\neach element.\n\nThe standard rules for the existential quantifier are similar\nanalogical extensions of the disjunction rules. The introduction rule\nis easy:\n\n\\(\\exists\\)-I:\nan existential quantification, \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), may be\ninferred from any of its instances, \\(A(t)\\).\n\n\nThe rule of \\(\\lor\\)-E allows us to infer a conclusion from a\ndisjunction given subproofs showing how the conclusion can be deduced\non the assumption of any of the disjuncts. Using a general subproof,\nas before, to present a schema for the deduction of the conclusion\nfrom an arbitrary \u201cdisjunct\u201d, we have\n\n\\(\\exists\\)-E:\na conclusion, \\(C\\), may be asserted after an existential\nquantification, \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), and a subproof, general with\nrespect to a term, \\(a\\) (where \\(a\\) does not occur in \\(C\\)), having\nthe instance \\(A(a)\\) as its hypothesis and containing \\(C\\) as a\nline.\n\n\nAgain, pretending for the moment that every element of the domain has\na name, the soundness of these rules is evident. (An instructive\nexercise, given the negation rules for classical logic, is to show\nthat the rules for \\(\\exists\\) (for \\(\\forall\\)) are derivable from\nthe rules for \\(\\forall\\) (for \\(\\exists\\)) and the definition of\n\\(\\exists x(A(x))\\) as \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg(A(x))\\) (the definition of\n\\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg(A(x))\\)). The restriction\nthat the special term of the subproof not occur in the conclusion of\n\\(\\exists\\)-Elimination turns out to correspond exactly to the\nrestriction on reiteration into general subproofs.)\n\nA few remarks about these rules are in order. One is that, since only\nfinitely many terms can occur in the finite section of a proof\npreceding a given application of a rule, we could require that the\nspecial term, \\(a\\), used in an application of \\(\\forall\\)-I or\n\\(\\exists\\)-E should not occur in the hypothesis of any of the\nsubproofs containing the rule application (or in any premiss of the\nwhole proof): in the terminology used in discussing Gentzen\u2019s\ntree-like formulation of natural deduction, \\(a\\) cannot occur in a\nhypothesis above the rule application unless that hypothesis has\nalready been discharged by some earlier application of a rule of\nsupposition. This would slightly simplify the overall framework by\nrendering unnecessary the restriction on reiteration into general\nsubproofs. On the other hand, in constructing a very long formalized\nproof, it is convenient to allow ourselves to re-use special terms. If\nwe did do without the restriction on reiteration, we could reformulate\n\\(\\forall\\)-Introduction without mentioning a special subproof. We\ncould just say that \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) may be asserted after\n\\(A(a)\\), provided that \\(a\\) does not occur in earlier hypotheses\nthat have not been discharged (many popular undergraduate textbooks\nadopt this course). This would simplify the statement of the rules a\nbit (though not the process of constructing proofs: checking that\n\\(a\\) doesn\u2019t occur in \u201cprohibited\u201d hypotheses will\nbe time-consuming in constructing a long proof). On the other hand, it\nwould obscure the relationship between the \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\)\nrules.\n\nThere is another oddity about the \\(\\forall\\)-I rule. We initially\nintroduced the idea of a subproof as representing suppositional\nreasoning: a subproof is a deduction from a hypothesis. But in\n\\(\\forall\\)-I we use a subproof that doesn\u2019t have a hypothesis!\nIf this seems objectionably odd, we could say that the subproof of an\napplication of \\(\\forall\\)-I, does have a hypothesis, but an unstated,\nmetalinguistic, one: the supposition is that the (otherwise\nuninterpreted) term \\(a\\) stands for some element in the domain. This\nis not as arbitrary as it might seem: if we modify the rules to give\nuniversally free logic (see Nolt 2020)\u2014that is, quantificational\nlogic freed from the assumptions made in ordinary first order logic\nthat the domain is non-empty and that all singular terms denote\nelements of it\u2014this hypothesis comes into the object language\nand is explicitly stated. Free logic is most easily formulated with an\nexistence predicate, \\(E!\\), and the rule becomes\n\nFree \\(\\forall\\)-I:\na universal quantification, \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, general with respect to a special term, \\(a\\),\nhaving \\(E!(a)\\) as its hypothesis, containing the instance of the\nquantification, \\(A(a)\\) as a line.\n\n\nExistence hypotheses and premises get added to the other quantifier\nrules: \\(\\forall\\)-E and \\(\\exists\\)-I become two-premiss rules, with\n\\(E!(t)\\) as the second premiss, and the subproof for \\(\\exists\\)-E\nends up with two hypotheses, \\(A(a)\\) and \\(E!(a)\\). Formulations of\nmany-sorted quantificational logics (Hailperin 1957, 1960 for a\nclassic statement; Freund 2019 for a philosophical application) can\nfollow the same pattern, with the extra hypotheses and premisses\nsaying that the relevant term or parameter stands for something in the\nrange of a particular sort of variable.\n3.2 Issues with \\(\\forall\\)-Generalization and \\(\\exists\\)-Instantiation\n\nA number of textbooks (Quine 1950b, some editions of Copi 1954, and\nKalish & Montague 1964, are perhaps the best known) employ a\ndeviant set of quantifier rules. The simpler rules, \\(\\exists\\)-I and\n\\(\\forall\\)-E, are unchanged, but the two subproof-involving rules we\njust surveyed are replaced by rules which (following Quine) we will\nrefer to as Existential Instantiation (EI) and Universal\nGeneralization (UG):\n\nEI:\nfrom an existential quantification \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\), an\ninstance, \\(A(a)\\) may be inferred, where \\(a\\) is a \\(A\\) term from a\nspecial \u201calphabet\u201d of terms. (Instantial Constant\nor Instantial Term are often used for this constant instead\nof parameter, etc.)\nUG:\nfrom an instance \\(A(a)\\), where \\(a\\) is one of the special\nterms, a universal quantification \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) may be\ninferred.\n\n\nUsed without restriction, such rules are obviously unsound: they would\nallow one to reason from the premise \\(\\exists x(A(x))\\) to the\nconclusion \\(\\forall x(A(x))\\) in two steps! The rules are therefore\nhedged with restrictions on the particular instantial terms to be\nused. For a start, one cannot use the same instantial term in two\ndistinct quantifier instances in the same derivation, but by itself\nthis is not sufficient. Precise formulation of restrictions that will\nyield a sound and complete system of rules is not trivial:\nCopi\u2019s textbook ((1954)) went through several editions with\ndifferent incorrect systems, and Quine (1950a) changed the wording of\nthe restriction between editions of his textbook (though both versions\ngive correct systems). Several articles were published, both in\nspecialist logic journals and in general philosophical ones, noting\nerrors and offering analyses of the situation.\n\nThe ideas behind these rules seem to have no intrinsic connection with\nnatural deduction: they do not use subproofs (they replace the\nsubproof-involving quantifier rules of more standard systems), and\nthey could be used in conjunction with a purely axiomatic system of\npropositional logic. Their association with natural deduction is a\nmatter of historical accident: the textbooks introducing them\npresented systems with other features of natural deduction. Still,\nthey have some practical value: proofs employing (a correctly\nrestricted version of) them, in the context of a system for classical\nlogic, can be shorter and simpler than the proofs in systems with the\nstandard natural deduction rules. (The classically valid schemes\n\n\\[\\exists x(\\exists yF(y)\\rightarrow F(x))\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\exists x(F(x)\\rightarrow\\forall yF(y)),\\]\n\n\nfor example, have very short and obvious proofs using\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-I and the variant quantifier rules.) On the other\nhand, they cannot be used without change in systems for intuitionistic\nor modal logics, as we explain in\n \u00a76:\n the classical schemes mentioned above are not intuitionistically\nvalid, but their simple proofs go through in a system that adds the\nquantifier rules of Quine\u2019s textbook to a formalization of\nintuitionistic propositional logic, and natural attempts to use them\nin formulating systems of quantified modal logic lead to simple\nderivations of the Barcan principle and its converse. Lack of caution\nin using these (and related) rules in the context of non-classical\nlogics has led to errors in published philosophical articles.\n\nThe difficulty in formulating correct restrictions on these rules is\nconnected to the absence of any obvious semantic interpretation of the\ninstantial terms. Classically, the truth of \\(\\exists xF(x)\\) in a\nmodel implies that (if every element of the domain has a name) then\nthe quantification has a true instance, but not that we can identify\nwhich instance it is. Thus, when the rule of EI is used in a proof in\nan otherwise interpreted language, the person constructing the proof\nmay not be in a position to define the instantial term: it remains\nuninterpreted. A moderately complicated model theoretic account has,\nhowever, been developed by Fine (1985a,b), which allows proof of the\nsoundness of appropriately restricted EI and UG rules. (Those\ninterested in using these rules for practical purposes in giving short\nproofs should consult Fine\u2019s work: he gives streamlined\nstatements of the rules and restrictions, and provides a simple\nalgorithm, his dependency diagrams, for checking that the\ninstantial terms in a proof comply with the restrictions.) For those\nfamiliar with Hilbert\u2019s Epsilon Calculus (see Avigad & Zach\n2020), perhaps the easiest way of seeing the soundness of properly\nrestricted EI and UG is to think of the instantial terms as\nabbreviating \\(\\epsilon\\)-terms: the terms occurring in a proof that\ncomplies with the restrictions can be expanded to appropriate\n\\(\\epsilon\\)-terms, whereas such expansion is blocked when the\nrestrictions are violated (see Hazen 1987, for a more detailed\naccount). Cellucci (1995) gives an interesting discussion on a variety\nof rules related to EI and UG. Pelletier (1999) recounts the many\nre-formulations of the UG and EI rules in the early\n1950s\u20131960s.\n4. Sequent Calculi and Sequent Natural Deduction\n\nGentzen (1934) presented his natural deduction systems,\n\\(\\mathcal{NJ}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{NK}\\), for intuitionistic and\nclassical logic (respectively), but he was not satisfied with\n\\(\\mathcal{NK}\\): he didn\u2019t see how to extend the normalization\ntheorem (discussed below in\n \u00a75)\n from \\(\\mathcal{NJ}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{NK}\\). He therefore introduced\nanother pair of systems, \\(\\mathcal{LJ}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{LK}\\)\n(\\(\\mathcal{L}\\) for logistisch), for the two logics, for\nwhich he was able to give a uniform proof of a closely\nrelated metatheorem. As with his presentation of natural deduction, a\nproof in one of his -systems is a tree, but whereas the nodes of the\ntree in an \\(\\mathcal{N}\\)-system proof are occupied by single\nformulas, the nodes in an \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-system proof are occupied by\nsequents, where a sequent consists of a pair of (possibly\nnull!) lists of formulas, separated by a special symbol,\n \\(\\vdash\\).[18]\n (As a result, systems similar to Gentzen\u2019s\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-systems are usually called sequent calculi.)\nThe intuitive meaning of a sequent is that if all the formulas of the\nlist to the left of the \\(\\vdash\\) (the antecedent formulas)\nare true, then at least one of the formulas in the right-hand list\n(the succedent formulas) is true, or (to use a word hinting\nat the relation to natural deduction) the assumption that all\nthe antecedent formulas are true justifies the conclusion that at\nleast one of the succedent formulas is true. In line with standard\nusage of all and at least one of in modern\nmathematics, this is interpreted as covering the cases of sequents\nwith null lists: if there are no antecedent formulas in a sequent, it\nis interpreted as meaning that at least one of the succedent formulas\nis true, if there are no succedent formulas the sequent is interpreted\nas meaning that at least one of the antecedent formulas is false, and\nif both lists are null\u2014so the sequent is just a \\(\\vdash\\)\nstanding by itself\u2014it is interpreted as expressing a necessary\nfalsehood.\n\nThe initial sequents of an \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-proof (the leaves of the\ntree) are identity sequents of the form \\(\\phi \\vdash \\phi\\) (this\ncorresponds to the way arbitrary assumptions can be used as leaves in\n\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)-proofs), and sequents at lower nodes follow by rules\nof inference from the sequents at the one or two nodes immediately\nabove them. The rules are of two kinds. First, structural\nrules for managing lists: Interchange (embodying the idea\nthat the order of the formulas in a list is irrelevant),\nContraction (allowing the elimination of duplicate copies of\na formula from the list), and Thinning (in the sense of\nwatering down: extra formulas may be added to a list). Second,\nlogical rules associated with the different connectives (and\nquantifiers): two for each\n operator[19],\n dealing with the operator in antecedent formulas and in succedent\nformulas. The rules for succedent occurrences of the operators are\nanalogous to the Introduction rules of natural deduction: thus, for\nexample, the right-hand rule for \\(\\land\\) allows us to infer a\nsequent \n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, (\\phi\\land\\psi)\\]\n\n\nfrom the two sequents \n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, \\phi\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta, \\psi.\\]\n\n\nIntroduction rules in natural deduction add complexity: the\nconclusions of instances of an introduction rule are formed by adding\nan operator to earlier formulas. In contrast, elimination rules\nsimplify: the premisses of instances of elimination rules are formed\nby deleting operators to the conclusions (or, in \\(\\lor\\)-E, to the\nhypotheses of the subproofs used). The \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-systems have no\nsimplifying rules of this kind. Their place is taken by complexifying\nrules on the left-hand side. Thus, for example, the rule for \\(\\land\\)\nin the antecedent allows a sequent \n\\[(\\phi \\land \\psi), \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta\\]\n\n\nto be inferred from either of the sequents \n\\[\\phi, \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\psi, \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta.\\]\n\n\nThe notation of sequents (and, in particular, sequents with only one\nsuccedent formula) can, however, be used in a presentation of natural\ndeduction: Gentzen (1936) gives such a system. The notational\ncomplications of the different presentations of natural deduction\ndescribed above\u2014Gentzen\u2019s trees, Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s\nboxes\u2014are required in order to keep track of just which\nassumptions a given formula of the proof depends on. An\nalternative, allowing the use of standard Int-Elim rules, would be to\nreplace each formula in a natural deduction proof with a sequent: the\nreplaced formula standing as the sole succedent formula of the\nsequent, and the assumptions it depends on forming the antecedent. A\nsystem of this sort may be called a system of sequent natural\ndeduction.\n\nSequent natural deduction turns out to be very usable in practice.\nExplicit mention of the structural rules of Interchange and\nContraction can be avoided by stipulating that the list of antecedent\nformulas is simply a representation of a set of formulas. Natural\ndeduction rules with two premisses can be formulated to allow merging\nof antecedents: thus, for example, \\(\\rightarrow\\)-E should allow the\ninference of \n\\[\\Gamma, \\Delta \\vdash \\psi\\]\n\n\nfrom \n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash (\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\Delta \\vdash \\phi.\\]\n\n\nThinning is still useful to cover proofs in which the hypothesis of a\nsubproof is not used in deriving a later formula, as in the\nformalization of the inference from \\(\\psi\\) to \\((\\phi \\rightarrow\n\\psi)\\). Rules of supposition, which discharge assumptions, are\nformulated as deleting the assumption from the antecedent: thus\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-I allows the inference of \n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash (\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)\\]\n\n\nfrom \n\\[\\phi, \\Gamma \\vdash \\psi\\]\n\n\n(which, give or take the possibility of additional succedent formulas,\nis precisely the right-hand \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I rule in the\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-systems).\n\nThe main practical problem with using this as a presentation of\nnatural deduction is the tedium of writing and rewriting all the\nformulas which occur in the antecedents of multiple sequents. It was\napparently first noticed in the elementary text, Suppes 1957, that\nthere was an easy way to abbreviate and refer to these formulas:\nfirst, by identifying each sequent with a numeral (if there are\ncurrently \\(n\\) sequents in the proof up to this point, then the next\nsequent will be numbered \\(n+1\\)). And secondly by associating a label\nwith that numeral used in a proof. The label for a premise of an\nargument is the same as its numeral; the label for an assumption (or\n\u201csupposition\u201d) is also the same as its numeral; and\notherwise (when a new sequent is generated by appeal to previous\nsequents) there are two cases, depending on whether the rule is a\n\u201cdirect\u201d rule or a \u201csupposition-ending\u201d rule.\nIn the former case, as exemplified by \\(\\land\\)-Introduction and\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-Elimination, the new sequent\u2019s label is the set\ncontaining the labels of both formulas that are used in the rule. In\nthe latter case, as exemplified by \\(\\rightarrow\\)-Introduction, the\nnew labels are the label-set of the numeral of the\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019s consequent minus the label of the\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019s\n antecedent.[20]\n\nThe sequent natural deduction of the earlier argument that we\u2019ve\ndone in the Gentzen tree format, the Ja\u015bkowski-style format, and\nthe Fitch format would become, in the Suppes (1957)\n notation[21]:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{4}\n\\{1\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &1. \\hspace{.2cm}((p\\rightarrow q)\\land(\\neg r\\rightarrow\\neg q)) &&\\text{Assume} \\\\\n \\{2\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &2. \\hspace{.2cm}p &&\\text{Assume}\\\\\n \\{1\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &3. \\hspace{.2cm}(p\\rightarrow q) &1,\\ & {\\land}\\text{-Elim}\\\\\n \\{1,2\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &4. \\hspace{.2cm}q &2,3,\\ & {\\rightarrow}\\text{-Elim}\\\\\n \\{1\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &5. \\hspace{.2cm}(\\neg r\\rightarrow\\neg q) &1,\\ & {\\land}\\text{-Elim}\\\\\n \\{6\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &6. \\hspace{.2cm}\\neg r & &\\text{Assume}\\\\\n \\{1,6\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &7. \\hspace{.2cm}\\neg q &5,6,\\ & {\\rightarrow}\\text{-Elim} \\\\\n \\{1,2,6\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &8. \\hspace{.2cm}(q\\land\\neg q) &4,7,\\ & {\\land}\\text{-Intro}\\\\\n \\{1,2\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &9. \\hspace{.2cm}\\neg\\neg r & 6,8,\\ & {\\neg}\\text{-Intro} \\\\\n \\{1,2\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &10. \\hspace{.2cm}r &\\text{9},\\ & {\\neg\\neg}\\text{-Elim} \\\\\n \\{1\\}\\hspace{.2cm} &11. \\hspace{.2cm}(p\\rightarrow r) &2,10,\\ & {\\rightarrow}\\text{-Intro}\\\\\n \\emptyset\\hspace{.2cm} &12. \\hspace{.2cm}(((p\\rightarrow q)\\land(\\neg r\\rightarrow\\neg q))\\rightarrow (p\\rightarrow r)) & 1,11,\\ & {\\rightarrow}\\text{-Intro} \n\\end{alignat*}\\]\n\n\nFigure 5: Suppes Proof Example\n\n\nWe\u2019ve called this way of presenting proofs \u201csequent\nnatural deduction\u201d to honour the way it is developed from\nsequent calculus. However, many\u2026maybe even\nall\u2026elementary logic textbooks that use such a system as their\nobject to be taught call it simply \u201cnatural deduction\u201d. Of\nthese books, some even take the space (in an authorial introduction,\nusually) to argue that this is superior to other ways of doing natural\ndeduction, especially from a pedogogical point of view. However, they\ndon\u2019t remark on the relation of this method to that of\nGentzen\u2019s single-conclusion sequent calculus.\n\nAnother interesting variation uses (essentially) only the right-hand\nside of (classical) sequents: nodes in the proof tree are occupied by\nthe finite sequences of formulas, which can be thought of,\nintuitively, as interpreted\n disjunctively.[22]\n5. Normalization\n\nThe central metatheorem about natural deduction is the\nNormalization theorem, to the effect that proofs in a natural\ndeduction system can be transformed into a \u201cnormal form\u201d,\ninformally characterized by Gentzen as \u201cnot being\nroundabout\u201d. This theorem applies to the full systems for first\norder logic, though in what follows we will, in order to give a\n\u201cflavour\u201d of the result and the method of proving it,\ndescribe only the propositional fragment.\n5.1 Normalization of Intuitionistic Logic\n\nGentzen (1934) remarked that the introduction rules were like\ndefinitions of the logical operators, and that the elimination rules\nwere consequences of their definitions. Making this remark precise is\nnot easy, but it has an intuitive plausibility. In the\nparadigmatically simple case of conjunction, the premises needed for\nan application of \\(\\land\\)-I are simply the two conjuncts, so the\nrule can be seen as \u201cdefining\u201d a conjunction to be true in\nthe case that both of its conjuncts are. In an application of\n\\(\\land\\)-E, the conclusion is one of the conjuncts, and so something\nthat has to be true if the conjunction is, supposing conjunction to be\n\u201cdefined\u201d that way. For other operators it is a bit less\nstraightforward. The required subproof for \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I is one in\nwhich the consequent is derived from the antecedent: thought of as a\ndefinition, this says that \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) is true just in case\n\\(B\\) is (somehow) obtainable from \\(A\\). The rule of\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-E can be seen as a kind of consequence: to infer \\(B\\)\nfrom the (major) premiss \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and the (minor) premiss\n\\(A\\) is to treat \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) as licensing one to infer \\(B\\)\nwhen \\(A\\) is given. (The special rules needed for Classical logic are\nharder to fit into this framework, an issue we discuss further, in the\ncontext of harmony, which we introduce in\n \u00a77.)\n\nIgnoring, for now, the metaphor of defining a connective (we will come\nback to it in\n \u00a77),\n there is a formal point here. If, in constructing a derivation, one\nuses an introduction rule to get a formula with a certain main\noperator, and then applies the corresponding elimination rule with\nthat formula as (major) premiss, one has made an avoidable\n\u201cdetour\u201d in the argumentation. It is easy to see in many\ncases that the detour could have been avoided: to use \\(\\land\\)-E in\nthis way is just to obtain (a second copy of) a formula that was\nalready there to be used as a premiss of the \\(\\land\\)-I,. Similarly,\nusing \\(\\rightarrow\\)-E after \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I could be obtained more\ndirectly: the minor premise is an occurrence of the same formula as\nthe hypothesis of the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I subproof, so simply use the\nsteps of the subproof as lines of the main proof.\n\nGentzen saw that this could be generalized, at least for the system\nfor intuitionistic logic. Call the \u201croute straightening\u201d\nmodifications to a derivation described in the previous paragraphs\n(i.e., deleting the \u201cdetour\u201d conjunction or conditional\nand taking a premiss of the former introduction rule as the\nconclusion, or obtaining the conclusion by means of argumentation from\nthe subproof for the introduction rule), and analogous modifications\nfor the other operators, an immediate reduction. Then, roughly, his\nresult (now called the Normalization Theorem) is that any derivation\ncan be transformed by a sequence of immediate reductions into a\nderivation in normal form, in which no (occurrence of) a formula\nobtained by one of the introduction rules is used as the major premiss\nof an elimination rule. We give examples of immediate reductions in\n figure 6.\n This is rough because of an annoying complication in the cases of the\nelimination rules (\\(\\lor\\)-E, \\(\\exists\\)-E) which involve\nsubproofs.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 6: Examples of Immediate\nReductions. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThere are two variant forms of the complication. (1) A formula is\nobtained by an introduction rule and then reiterated into the\nsubproof, and then used as the major premiss of an elimination rule\nthere: the needed immediate reduction for this\nintroduction-elimination detour isn\u2019t possible because the\nmaterial (premiss, premises, subproof) needed isn\u2019t available in\nthe subproof of the \\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E. (Note that this\nproblem can\u2019t arise if we have a Gentzen-style presentation of\nnatural deduction: where a Fitch-style derivation uses reiteration to\nget a second copy of a formula, the Gentzen-style derivation just\nrepeats the whole argumentation leading to the formula above each of\nits occurrences.) The fix for this is conceptually simple (though in\nsome cases it can lead to an increase in total derivation size, since\nit can involve installing multiple copies of many formulas): instead\nof reiterating the formula into the subproof, reiterate whatever was\nneeded to derive it, derive it by the introduction rule within the\nsubproof, and proceed to the immediate reduction. (2) The conclusion\nof the \\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E inference, which is also the last\nline of the subproof(s), is obtained by an introduction rule inside\nthe subproof, and is then used as the (major) premiss of an\nelimination rule in the main derivation. Again, an immediate reduction\nof the detour is not possible: the conclusion is in the main\nderivation, but the materials needed for its direct derivation are\navailable only in the subproof(s). It is perhaps a little less obvious\nthat the fix for this works, but it is again conceptually simple: do\nthe second elimination inference inside the subproof(s), so its\nconclusion is the last line of the subproof(s), and then take its\nconclusion in place of the original as the conclusion of the main\n\\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E inference. Call modifications of this sort\nto a derivation permutative reductions. Then the less rough statement\nof Gentzen\u2019s theorem is that any derivation (in the natural\ndeduction system for intuitionistic logic) can be converted, by a\nsequence of immediate and permutative reductions, into the normal\nform, in which no occurrence of a formula is both the conclusion of an\nintroduction rule and the major premiss of an elimination rule.\nDerivations in normal form have interesting and useful properties.\nPerhaps the most noteworthy is the subformula property: every\nformula in a normal derivation is a subformula of (that is, either\nidentical to or a part of) either an undischarged hypothesis or the\nfinal conclusion.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Example of Permutative\nReduction. [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs an example of the applications of normalization theorems, the fact\nthat normal derivations have the subformula property has implications\nfor the decision problems. In propositional logic, there are only\nfinitely many subformulas of the (finitely many) initial premises and\nconclusion, so a normal derivation can contain occurrences only of\nfinitely many formulas. This (with a bit more work) implies that there\nis a finite upper bound on the size of possible normal derivations of\na given conclusion from given premisses, so the propositional logic is\n(in principle!) decidable by an exhaustive search of possible\nderivations (Gentzen 1934 proves the decidability of Intuitionistic\npropositional logic in essentially this way, appealing to his\nHauptsatz for the sequent calculus rather than normalization\nfor natural deduction.) Turning to First Order logic, normal\nderivations have only a looser subformula property: for every free\nvariable, the instance \\(F(a)\\) substituting that free variable for\nthe quantified variable counts as a subformula of \\(\\forall xF(x)\\)\nand \\(\\exists xF(x)\\). First order logic is, of course, undecidable:\nwhat this shows is that no upper bound can be computed for the number\nof distinct instances of a quantification that need to occur in\n\\(\\forall\\)-I or \\(\\exists\\)-E subproofs in the proof of a valid\nformula of a given length.\n5.2 Proofs of Normalization\n\nIt is clear from Gentzen (1934) that he was aware of the normalization\ntheorem, but he did not publish a proof, or even a precise\nformulation, of it. The reason would seem to be that he despaired of\nproving an analogous result for the system of natural deduction for\nclassical logic, and so developed his sequent calculus systems. For\nthese he was able to prove a result for both the classical\nand intuitionistic variants (his Hauptsatz) which is\nanalogous to the normalization theorem, and useful for some of the\nsame applications. A proof of the normalization theorem was finally\npublished by Prawitz (1965), but it turns out that Gentzen himself had\nwritten out a detailed proof in 1933, which is very similar to that\ngiven by Prawitz. Jan von Plato discovered Gentzen\u2019s manuscript\nand published it (von Plato 2008). (Gentzen\u2019s presentation of\nthe proof is very clear, and evidences a strong visual imagination: it\nis a pleasure to read.)\n5.3 A Variant Logic\n\nBefore going on to difficult things like classical logic, it may be\nworth while to give an example of how these ideas can be generalized.\nIn Nelson 1949, David Nelson presented a variant of intuitionistic\nlogic, agreeing with Heyting\u2019s on the positive connectives and\nquantifiers, but having a different negation operator. (Some\nsubsequent logicians, considering systems with both operators, call\nNelson\u2019s negation \u2018strong negation\u2019.) It is easy to\nformulate natural deduction rules for Nelson\u2019s logic if we allow\nnegative introduction and elimination rules in the style of Fitch.\nNegative negation introduction and elimination allow \\(\\neg\\neg A\\) to\nbe inferred from \\(A\\) and vice versa. Negative \\(\\rightarrow\\) rules\nallow \\(\\neg(A\\rightarrow B)\\) to be treated as if it were\n\\((A\\land\\neg B)\\). Negative (conjunction, disjunction, universal\nquantifier, existential quantifier) rules parallel the usual\n(disjunction, conjunction, existential quantifier, universal\nquantifier) rules: for example, \\(\\neg(A\\land B)\\) can be inferred by\n\\(\\neg\\land\\)-I from either \\(\\neg A\\) or \\(\\neg B\\), and a\nconclusion, \\(C\\), follows from \\(\\neg(A\\land B)\\) by \\(\\neg\\land\\)-E\nfrom three items: \\(\\neg(A\\land B)\\), a subproof in which \\(C\\) is\nderived from the hypothesis \\(\\neg A\\), and a subproof in which C is\nderived from the hypothesis \\(\\neg B\\). Since the pair of negative\nInt-Elim rules for any operator are related in a way parallel to the\nrelation between (ordinary) Int-Elim rules for some operator, detours\nin a formal proof can be reduced in ways analogous to Gentzen\u2019s\nreductions for standard intuitionistic logic. A normalization theorem\ncan therefore be proven in much the same way as that for the standard\nlogic. A normal derivation won\u2019t have quite the same subformula\nproperty as normal derivations in the standard logic (every formula of\na normal Nelson derivation will be a weak\nsubformula\u2014that is, either a subformula or the negation of\na subformula\u2014of the final conclusion or of some premiss), but\nclose enough for many technical applications.\n5.4 Normalization in Classical Logic\n\nTypically, natural deduction systems for classical logic are\nformulated by adding an extra, classicizing, rule to a natural\ndeduction system for intuitionistic logic: any of a variety of\npossible rules can be\n added.[23]\n The immediate and permutative reductions are possible in derivations\nin classical natural deduction, but there is another case to consider:\na logically complex formula might be concluded by the classicizing\nrule and then used as the major premiss of an elimination rule. This\nformula might be more complex than the final conclusion or any of the\npremises of the derivation, in which case its use would intuitively\nseem just as much a \u201cdetour\u201d as those eliminated by the\nnormalization of an intuitionistic derivation. Worse, if we allowed\nsuch detours, we would lose the \u201ccontrol\u201d over the\ncomplexity of derivations necessary for technical applications of the\nnormalization theorem. So a normal derivation, in natural deduction\nfor classical logic, should be defined as one in which no conclusion\nof an introduction rule is used as the major premiss of an elimination\nrule (as before) and in which no formula obtained by the classicizing\nrule is used as the major premiss of an elimination rule. Gentzen\nappears to have thought that no reduction process was possible which\nwould allow arbitrary derivations in the classical system to be\ntransformed into this kind of normal derivation. (It is possible that\nthe particular classicizing rule he envisaged (see\n note 23)\n makes this harder than other formulations would.)\n\nPrawitz (1965) proved a normalization theorem for a system of\nclassical natural deduction with a reduced set of logical operators.\n(The operators, \\(\\lor\\) and \\(\\exists\\), that he omitted can be\ndefined, in classical logic, in terms of the others, so\nPrawitz\u2019s result is strong enough for some applications.)\nSeveral later writers proved normalization results for classical logic\nwith all the usual operators, but under various restrictions. It thus\ncame as a surprise to the logical community when von Plato and Siders\n(2012) were able to give a very simple proof of a fully general\nnormalization theorem for a system of classical logic including all\nthe usual operators.\n\nFor the normalization result of von Plato and Siders, we will choose,\nas our classicizing rule, the principle of Indirect Proof: a formula,\n\\(A\\), may be asserted after a subproof, with hypothesis \\(\\neg A\\),\nhaving a pair of contradictory formulas, \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\), as\nitems. The possibility of normalization then depends on our being able\nto modify derivations to eliminate cases where a formula, \\(C\\), is\nobtained by Indirect Proof and is then used as the (major) premiss of\nan elimination rule to obtain another formula, \\(D\\): we might call\nmanoeuvres like this in a derivation \u201cclassicizing\ndetours\u201d. This is illustrated in\n figure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Example of Classical\nReduction. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\n(Depending on details, further reductions may be needed within the new\nsubproof.) To avoid such detours, we instead use indirect proof to\nobtain \\(D\\). This fix, a classicizing reduction, is analogous to the\npermutative reductions discussed above. The new indirect proof\nsubproof will have \\(\\neg D\\) as its hypothesis; since \\(D\\) is\nimmediately derivable (by an elimination rule!) from \\(C\\), we can use\n\\(\\neg\\)-Int to infer \\(\\neg C\\), after which the argumentation of the\noriginal subproof will yield a contradiction.\n\nIn normalizing an entire derivation, we can start by attacking the\nmost deeply embedded classicizing detours (those in whose (original)\nindirect proof subproofs no further classicizing detours occur) and\nworking outward. Combining this with applications of the earlier\nreductions, it is not hard to see that the entire derivation can be\nconverted into one in normal form. Normal derivations in classical\nlogic have only the weak (but still useful!) subformula property\nmentioned in\n \u00a75.3\n in connection with Nelson\u2019s variant of intuitionistic\nlogic.\n\nGiven the simplicity of von Plato and Siders\u2019s technique, it is\nsomewhat surprising that it took so long to discover a method of\nnormalizing natural deduction. Perhaps the barrier was psychological:\nthe intuitively obvious part of the Gentzen/Prawitz normalization of\nintuitionistic logic is in the immediate reductions, the permutative\nreductions in contrast being perceived as annoying technical details\nneeded for a few rules. So perhaps logicians didn\u2019t find it\nnatural to use permutative-style reductions more generally. In this\nconnection, it is perhaps significant that von Plato (2001) had worked\nwith systems having what are called general elimination\nrules. Here the other elimination rules are replaced by rules more in\nthe spirit of \\(\\lor\\)-E: the conclusion, which need not be an\nimmediate subformula of the (major) premise, is derived in a subproof\nhaving hypotheses sufficient for obtaining that premise by the\ncorresponding Introduction rule, and is taken to be established in the\nmain proof by the existence of the subproof. This was of course not a\nlogically necessary prerequisite\u2014normalization holds\nboth for classical natural deduction with general rules and, as we\nhave seen, for a more standard formulation of classical natural\ndeduction\u2014but psychologically it may have made it easy to see\nhow the problem could be solved.\n\nThe normalization proofs described, turning on applications of the\nvarious reductions in a certain order, are moderately complicated in\ndetail, but conceptually elementary: they (like Gentzen\u2019s 1934\nproof of the Hauptsatz for sequent calculi) are finitistic in\nthe sense of the Hilbert program. (The corollaries Gentzen derives\nfrom the Hauptsatz in the last section of Gentzen (1934),\nthough published after G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem, can\nthus be seen as among the successes of Hilbert\u2019s program.)\n\nThe theorems described, depending as they do on the order of\napplication of the reductions, are sometimes called weak normalization\ntheorems. There are also strong normalization theorems, to the effect\nthat any derivation can be converted into one in normal form by\napplication of the reductions in arbitrary order (Prawitz 1971). Their\nproof is necessarily less elementary. The theorems, and the methods\nused in their proof, are analogous to what is called\n\u201cnormalizability\u201d theorems in the context of the\nlambda-calculus (detailed discussions can be found in, e.g., Troelstra\n& Schwichtenberg 1996). There are also weaker theorems, called\nnormal form theorems, stating that for any derivation there\nis a derivation in normal form of the same conclusion from the same\npremises, without saying anything about a procedure for converting a\nnon-normal derivation into a normal one. Such theorems can be proven,\ne.g., semantically, by proving the completeness of a system restricted\nto normal derivations.\n6. Natural Deduction Systems for Modal and other Logics\n\nNatural deduction systems were originally described, by Gentzen and\nJa\u015bkowski, for intuitionistic and classical First order logic:\nthe logical framework needed in formalizing intuitionistic and\nclassical mathematical theories. The techniques can be generalized,\nhowever, to a broad range of other logics. We will note briefly a few\nof these extensions.\n\nThe historically first seem to be systems of natural deduction for\nmodal logics. The logical behavior of necessity and\npossibility operators in familiar modal logics has deep analogies to\nthe logical behavior of universal and existential quantifiers. (This,\nof course, is what makes the \u201cpossible worlds\u201d semantics\nfor modality\u2014on which the necessity of a proposition is\nconstrued as its holding in every member of some range of\n\u201cworlds\u201d, and its possibility as its holding in at least\none\u2014so natural.) Introduction and elimination rules for the\nmodal operators, then, can be formulated in ways analogous to those\nfor the quantifiers. The elimination rule for necessity and the\nintroduction rule for possibility (at least for alethic modal\nlogics\u2026) are easy: what is necessary is true, and what is true\nis possible. For Necessity Introduction, we can have the rule that\n\\(\\square A\\) may be asserted after a subproof (of a special kind: in\nFitch\u2019s nomenclature, a strict subproof) in which \\(A\\) occurs:\nthere will be some restriction, differing in formulations for\ndifferent modal logics, on reiteration into these special subproofs.\n(Intuitively, in terms of the possible worlds semantic interpretation,\nthe idea is that something asserted before the beginning of the\nsubproof can be reiterated into it only if its truth does not depend\non any special feature of the actual world.) Possibility Elimination\nwill similarly ape the form of \\(\\exists\\)-Elim: for at least some\nrange of formulas \\(B\\), \\(B\\) may be inferred from \\(\\diamondsuit A\\)\nin the presence of a strict subproof having \\(A\\) as a hypothesis and\ncontaining \\(B\\), with the complication that \\(B\\) must satisfy a\ncondition analogous to the condition permitting formulas to be\nreiterated into strict subproofs. (For many modal logics, the easiest\nway of formulating the condition is to make \\(B\\) suitable, as it\nwere, after the fact: if \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\diamondsuit C\\), it\nmay be asserted after \\(\\diamondsuit A\\) and a strict subproof with\n\\(A\\) as hypothesis in which \\(C\\) occurs.) Fitch (1952) defines\nsystems like this for the modal logics S\\(_4\\) and T. (He\ndoesn\u2019t name T in the book, describing the system only as\n\u201cresembling S\\(_2\\)\u201d.) Curry (1950) and, in greater\ndetail, Curry (1963) gives similar rules for S\\(_4\\), formulated in a\nGentzen-style rather than Fitch-style presentation of Natural\nDeduction. Fitch (1966) gives formulations of a variety of alethic and\ndeontic propositional modal logics; Fitting (1983) is a comprehensive\nstudy of a variety of modal natural deduction systems and their\nmetatheoretic properties.\n\nThese modal systems are easy to use, and they have been included in\nsome logic textbooks for philosophy undergraduates. They are, however,\noften less elegant than natural deduction systems for first order\nlogic. The natural deduction rules for classical logic support the\ninterdefinability of the two quantifiers: \\(\\forall xA(x)\\) and\n\\(\\exists xA(x)\\) are provably equivalent to \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\nA(x)\\) and \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg A(x)\\) by use of the quantifier and\nnegation rules; and the rules for either quantifier are derivable,\nwhen it is defined in terms of the other, by use of the negation rules\nand the rules for the other quantifier. For most modal natural\ndeduction systems, the analogous results do not hold, and the\nequivalences have to be postulated specially. Again, \\(\\exists\nxA(x)\\lor\\exists xB(x)\\) is derivable from \\(\\exists x(A(x)\\lor\nB(x))\\) by use of the rules for the existential quantifier and\ndisjunction, but the restrictions on \\(\\diamondsuit\\)-E usually block\nthe analogous derivation in modal natural deduction. Normalization\ntheorems are known for some systems of modal natural deduction, but\noften they are not as strong as the analogous results for first order\nlogic: sometimes the subformula property of normal derivations\nrequires that the result of prefixing a limited number of modal\noperators to a formula count as one of its \u201chonorary\u201d\nsubformulas.\n\nGoing further afield, very pretty natural deduction systems can be\ngiven for at least fragments of systems of relevant logics. Early in\nthe literature on these logics the naturalness of these systems was\npresented as evidence for the naturalness of the logics (see Anderson\n1960; Anderson & Belnap 1962b; with some rearrangement, Anderson\n& Belnap 1962b, is reprinted in chapter 1 of Anderson & Belnap\n1975). The key connectives of relevant logics are implicational:\nentailment or relevant implication. The natural deduction rules for\nthese connectives are modifications of the standard rules for\nconditionals: the usual modus ponens for the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-E rule;\nand for the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I, a variant of the standard rule with a\nrestriction (formulated in Anderson & Belnap 1962b, with the aid\nof a simple and elegant bit of notation) ensuring that the hypothesis\nof the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I subproof is actually used in deriving the\nconsequent. The pure implicational systems defined in Anderson and\nBelnap (1962b) are very elegant, and the conceptual arguments based on\nthem impressive! Another fragment of the standard relevant logics,\nhaving quantifiers and the \u201cBoolean\u201d operators \\(\\neg,\\\n\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\), but lacking the characteristic \\(\\rightarrow\\)\noperator, also has a nice natural deduction formulation: the positive\nand negative rules for the quantifiers and Booleans mentioned above in\n \u00a75.3,\n but omitting the ex falso quodlibet version of its \\(\\neg\\)-E rule.\n(The propositional part of this fragment of relevant logic is\ndiscussed in Anderson & Belnap 1962a, which is reproduced in\nchapter 3 of Anderson & Belnap 1975.) Unfortunately natural\ndeduction systems for full relevant logics, incorporating all the\nconnectives, require rules and restrictions that may strike many as ad\nhoc.\n\nSimilar techniques can be adapted for formulations of other\nsubstructural logics in the sense of Restall (2000). Relevant logics\nare examples of logics lacking the property of Thinning: that is,\nlacking the principle that if \\(\\Gamma\\vdash B\\) then \\(\\Gamma,A\\vdash\nB\\). Non-contractive logics\u2014logics in which the inference from\n\\((A\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B))\\) to \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is\nrejected\u2014can be captured by restrictions on the number of times\na hypothesis can be used. (Formulations of Contraction-free and\nThinning-free logics as sequent calculii analogous to Gentzen\u2019s\n\\(\\mathcal{LJ}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{LK}\\) omit or restrict the\n\u201cstructural\u201d rules of Contraction and Thinning: hence the\nname \u2018substructural logics\u2019. For background in\nsubstructural logic, see Restall 2018.)\n\nThen there are non-distributive logics, in which the inference from\n\\((A\\land(B\\lor C))\\) to \\(((A\\land B)\\lor(A\\land C))\\) is rejected:\nsuch logics have been proposed as quantum logics. A natural deduction\nsystem for such a logic (based on the form of sequent natural\ndeduction used in Lemmon (1965), though Fitch-style versions are also\npossible) is given in the textbook, Gibbins 1987.\n7. IntElim and some Possible Philosophical Consequences\n\nCertain features of natural deduction have been thought to be of a\nmore general philosophical interest than just to the realm of\norganizing and displaying derivations of logical systems in an\nefficient and perspicuous form. Here we discuss two areas where the\nidea of Introduction and Elimination rules for each connective\nreverberates into philosophical debate of other topics.\n7.1 IntElim as the Correct View of Logic\n\nAs we mentioned above, Gentzen saw his set of rules as being organized\ninto Introduction rules and Elimination rules. He also had remarked\nthat the Introduction rules were \u201clike\u201d introducing\nsomething (namely, a sentence with a given major connective) into a\nproof and the corresponding Elimination rule was \u201clike\u201d\nsimplifying the complex sentence into (at least one of) its component\nparts. This is the ideal of an Int-Elim organization of the rules of a\nlogic. To some, this is the ideal of what a logic should be, and gives\nan important clue, again according to some, as to what is The One True\nLogic. Gentzen (1934) showed that his formulation of intuitionistic\nLogic had this feature, but apparently thought that the extra rule(s)\nor axiom(s) required for classical Logic did not manifest this\nproperty. (Or at least, not straightforwardly.) This has led many\nphilosophers of logic, notably Michael Dummett (1977, 1975 [1978],\n1991; and others of his works), to claim that intuitionism is The One\nTrue Logic. (See Schroeder-Heister 2018; Steinberger 2011, and the\nfinal section of Shapiro & Kouri Kissel 2021, for further remarks\non this. See also Read 2006 for a lively defense of the claim.)\n\nHowever, the claim of the superiority of IntElim rules has seemed to\nsome to be either shaky or perhaps circular. Consider the case of a\nnew binary connective, TONK, proposed in\nPrior (1960), whose (complete) meaning was to be given by the\nintroduction rule: from \\(\\phi\\) infer \\((\\phi\\) TONK\n\\(\\psi)\\), and the elimination rule: from\n\\((\\phi\\) TONK \\(\\psi)\\) infer \\(\\psi\\). If\nlogic rules are to be given merely in terms of some Introduction and\nsome Elimination conditions, then TONK has\njust been given a proper Int-Elim definition. But as Prior notes,\nlogic becomes much more \u201cegalitarian\u201d with this new\nconnective\u2026too egalitarian, perhaps!\n\nPrior\u2019s article elicited a large volume of responses, many in\nthe early-mid-1960s in the pages of Analysis. Perhaps the\nbest of these is Belnap (1962), which responded by arguing that\n\u201cmeaning-in-a-language\u201d involved more than simply\nsupplying a connective with some introduction rule and\nsome elimination rule: the proposed connective needed also to\nbe able \u201cfit in\u201d with other aspects of the language.\nFurthermore, and importantly, the Int-Elim ideal required that the\nelimination rule was required only to \u201cundo\u201d the\neffect of the introduction rule. But the TONK-E\nrule obviously did very much more.\n\nAccording to this view, if the introduction and the elimination rules\nare to be \u201creverse images of one another\u201d, so that the\nelimination rule for connectives were merely \u201cconsequences of\nthe definition given for the introduction of the connective\u201d,\nthen the elimination rule for TONK would\nneed to be the following pair of rules, TONK-Elim-Left\nand TONK-Elim-Right:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 9 [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAfter all, the TONK-E rule is supposed to\nconclude \\(B\\) from \\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\), but\ngiven that the TONK-I rule introduced the\n\\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\) formula merely from the\nprevious formula \\(A\\), clearly\u2014if we are to honour the view\nthat the elimination operation only has the effect of\n\u201cundoing\u201d the introduction rule\u2014we need it to be the\ncase that \\(A\\) already entailed \\(B\\).\n\nIt is equally possible to keep the elimination rule as initially\nstated\u2014from \\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\) infer\n\\(B\\)\u2014but to change the introduction rule so as to guarantee\nthat no new information is added by an\n elimination[24]:\n\n\n\nFigure 10 [An\n extended description of figure 10\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe generalization of this feature is now called Harmony by\nmost of the concerned theorists (see Read 2004; Steinberger 2011,\namong many others, for discussion). As we have already remarked, many\nhave claimed that this is the \u201cproper\u201d form of rules of\nlogic: it is the key to describing what is \u201cmeant\u201d by a\nlogical connective and also what a restriction on The One True Logic\nis\u2014namely, that all its connectives must exemplify this\nproperty. And hence many theorists have claimed that Intuitionistic\nLogic is The One True Logic. (For examples of forcefully articulated\nopinions on the matter, see Read 2006, 2008, 2010.)\n\nA possibly serious challenge to the thought that Harmony is\nthe central feature of an adequate logic comes from\nconsiderations on identity. The introduction and elimination rules for\nidentity are usually seen as in\n figure 11.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 11: Traditional IntElim Rules for\nIdentity. [An\n extended description of figure 11\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIt is not at all obvious how this \\(=\\)-E rule just \u201creverses\nthe effect\u201d of the \\(=\\)-I rule here.\n\nAn early proposal to answer this was made in Read (2004), thinking of\ndefining identity by means of indiscernibility: \\(\\forall\nF((Fa\\leftrightarrow Fb)\\leftrightarrow a=b)\\). This can be put into\nthe form of an Intuitionistic rule-pair, as in\n figure 12.\n But of course, for the \\(=\\)-I rule to correctly mirror the\nsecond-order quantification of the indiscernibility principle, the\n\\(F\\) needs to be \u201ctruly arbitrary\u201d (perhaps: a unary\npredicate that does not occur in any assumption other than the present\none). The \\(F\\) in the \\(=\\)-E rule, on the other hand, is any unary\npredicate of the language. There is a burgeoning literature on this\ntopic, much of it focussing on whether it is legitimate to incorporate\nfeatures of second-order logic in the ways required.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 12: Read\u2019s (2004)\nIndiscernability IntElim Rules for Identity. [An\n extended description of figure 12\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBesides the works cited just above, see also Griffiths 2014; Klev\n2019; Kremer 2007; Read 2016.\n7.2 Logic\u2019s Relations with Language and Metaphysics\n\nThe general picture of harmonious Int-Elim rules has not only fuelled\na theory of The One True Logic (as in Read 2006) but also has been the\nbacking for a theory of \u201csemantics\u201d (both of formal logic\nand also of natural language usage) called Inferentialism. As Read\n(2010: 558) puts it,\n\n\nTraditionally, semantics has been denotational and representational,\nconsisting in a homomorphic valuation from expressions to some range\nof objects. This approach risks ontological explosion, first in\nhypostatizing denotations for empty names, predicates, conjunctions,\nprepositions and so on\u2026, then in seeking values for false\npropositions in the form of non actual states of affairs. It is also\nregressive, since a criterion is now needed to determine which\nnon-actual states of affairs are possible, which simply repeats the\ninitial problem. Talk of possible worlds is an attractive metaphor,\nbut does little useful philosophical work and much harm.\n\nInferentialism, in contrast, is ontologically neutral. Expressions are\nmeaningful if there are rules governing their use, in particular,\nlogical expressions are given meaning by the introduction-rules,\nspecifying the grounds for assertion of propositions containing them,\nand elimination-rules drawing inferences from those assertions.\n\n\nThe works mentioned above concerned themselves with introducing\nconnectives in logic, as is appropriate for an entry \u201cNatural\nDeduction in Logic\u201d. But as Read (2010) points out, the general\nviewpoint is consonant with \u201cuse theories of meaning\u201d that\nhave been prominent in philosophy of\n language.[25]\n The chain of inference here seems to be (something like):\n\nSystems of formal logic are best characterized by their natural\ndeduction formalizations.\nThe best sort of natural deduction formalism is by means of a set\nof Int-Elim rules, ones that will lead us to normalizability of proofs\nand will show a harmony in their formalizations.\nGiven the way that such Int-Elim rules operate in formal\nderivations, they should be organized into harmonious pairs. And it is\nclear that this specifies the entirety of the meaning of such\nconnectives.\nNot only is this true of a connective\u2019s meaning within\nlogical systems, but\u2014more widely\u2014it is true of the\nmeanings natural language terms that correspond to such logical\noperators: their meanings are also entirely given by these Int-Elim\nrules.\nHence, it is therefore plausible to suppose that a feature related\nto introduction and elimination should be the entire meaning of\nany (and all) natural language meaning.\n\n\nThis argument from logic to natural language meaning is reminiscent of\nslippery slope reasoning: it might be challenged at any of the sliding\npoints. For instance, one might argue that there is no real reason (=\nno reason other than to try to establish the overall conclusion about\nnatural language meaning) to prefer natural deduction formulations of\nlogic over Frege-Hilbert axiomatic ones. Or one might point to an\nalleged \u201cvast gulf\u201d between logical systems (and the\nreasoning employed in them) and natural language (and the variety of\nuses to which natural language lends itself). Still, the project has\nseemed not just possible but a straightforwardly correct path to\ninvestigate.\n\nSome work in the informal side of this idea is illustrated by Brandom\n(1994, 2000), under the title \u2018Inferentialism\u2019; and on the\nmore formal side by Francez (2015, 2021), under the title\n\u2018Proof-theoretic Semantics\u2019. Arguing both for the formal\nside and for the informal side of this viewpoint is Dummett (1973,\n1977, 1978, 1991), which has been much of the inspiration for the\ncurrent interest in the notion of harmony of inference rules in\nlogical systems as well as in natural language.\n\n\nDummett (1973: 453): Learning to use a statement of a given form\ninvolves learning two things: The conditions under which one is\njustified in making the statement; and what constitutes acceptance of\nit, i.e., the consequences of accepting it.\n\nBrandom (2000: 63): What corresponds to an introduction rule\nfor a propositional content is the set of sufficient\nconditions for asserting it, and what corresponds to an\nelimination rule is the set of necessary\nconsequences of asserting it, that is, what follows from doing so.\n\n\nFrancez (2021: 55\u20136) puts the aim of Proof-Theoretic Semantics\n(PTS) like this (italics and bold in the original):\n\n\nThe PTS programme as a theory of meaning can be described as follows:\n\u2026 Replace the received approach of taking sentential\nmeanings as truth-conditions \u2026 by taking them\nas canonical derivability conditions \u2026 within\na \u201cdedicated\u201d meaning-conferring natural-deduction\nproof-system in which the derivability conditions are formulated.\n\u2026 The proof system should reflect the \u201cuse\u201d of the\nsentences (their inferential roles) \u2026, and should allow\nrecovering pre-theoretic properties of the meanings of sentences, such\nas entailment and consequence drawing (inference).\n\u2026 Such a system has two kinds of rules: Introduction\nrules [and] Elimination rules.\n\n\nA feature of (logical) intuitionism is a denial of the law of\nbivalence, and its characteristic denial of the truth of formulas such\nas \\((p\\lor\\neg p)\\). The intuitionistic interpretation of theoremhood\nis said to be provability, and it may be that neither \\(p\\)\nnor \\(\\neg p\\) is provable, so hence \\((p\\lor\\neg p)\\) should not be\nprovable. In Dummett\u2019s version, the provability constraint is\nreplaced by warranted assertibility\u2026which in turn is\nbased on having rules for being justified in introducing some piece of\nlanguage into a conversation and rules that justify the exploitation\nof the piece (\u2018exploitation\u2019 being the standard term used\nin discussing natural language corresponding to the\n\u2018elimination\u2019 used when one exploits a logical operator).\nA rallying cry of such theorists might be that\n\n\nThe meaning of any term or phrase or linguistic item whatsoever is\ngiven by, and only by, the set of rules for the introduction of such\nan item into discourses and for exploiting them once they have been\nintroduced.\n\n\nOne can see ties from this rallying cry to other views concerning\nmeaning, such as \u201cDon\u2019t ask for the meaning, ask for the\nuse\u201d, or \u201cThe rules of the language game are what\ndetermine, and wholly describe, what is the meaning of linguistic\nitems\u201d.\n\nMichael Dummett has turned this discussion of \u201cuse\u201d into a\nmetaphysical position. (See especially Dummett 1991; but this builds\non Dummett 1977 [e.g., p. 682], and even Dummett 1973 [e.g., p. 377],\nas well as many of his other works.) The basic idea seems to be this:\nintuitionism as applied to logic urges meaning to be given by rules of\nhow to use the connectives. Classical logic, on the other hand,\nassumes that there is a pre-given notion of reference and designation,\nemploying notions like TRUE and FALSE.\nIt follows, he says, that classical logic\nis going to be committed to a pernicious form of \u201cmeaning\nholism\u201d that makes language learning impossible. (To some it\nseems counterintuitive that Dummett should think that classical logic\nwith a meaning-presupposition of reference and denotation is committed\nto \u201ctotal meaning holism\u201d, when that is a more usual\ncriticism of meaning-as-use theories. But that is indeed his view, as\nelaborated in Dummett (1975 [1978]), and elsewhere.) The doctrine that\nfollows from this is called anti-realism by Dummett, and\nentails that there are no \u201crealistic\u201d facts or items that\nground the correctness of logical operations. There is only the\n\u201clearning of how the community uses the relevant\nterms\u201d.\n\nThis is Dummett\u2019s argument from the Manifestation Criterion:\nthere must be some way for language learners to become able to use\nterms of language (in the first instance, learn the terms expressing\nthe logical notions)\u2014there must be some criterion that is\nmanifest in their (language-learning) experience. Dummett claims this\nis where classical semantic theories fail: there is no way, short of\nan all-embracing meaning holism for them to do so, since there is no\naccess to an independent semantic realm apart from language\nitself.\n\nThe literature on Dummett\u2019s version of anti-realism is huge. An\nearly and incisive critique Dummett\u2019s (and also of some of his\ncritics\u2019) thoughts on the Manifestation Criterion is by Michael\n(1999), who argues that classical logic is not actually committed to a\ntotal meaning holism, but only to an innocuous \u201cmolecular holism\nof meaning\u201d. Interested readers might consult Khlentzos (2021)\nfor a general discussion of realism and varieties of anti-realism and\nin particular its \u00a73 for the particular linguistic aspects that\nare relevant to the current subsection.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, Alan Ross, 1960, \u201cCompleteness Theorems for the\nSystems E of Entailment and EQ of Entailment with\nQuantification\u201d, <em>Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematische Logik\nund Grundlagen der Mathematik</em>, 6(7\u201314): 201\u2013216.\ndoi:10.1002/malq.19600060709", "Anderson, Alan Ross and Nuel D.
