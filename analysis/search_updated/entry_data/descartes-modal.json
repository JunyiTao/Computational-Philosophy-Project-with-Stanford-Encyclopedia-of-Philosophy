    "main_text": "\n1. Modality and Clear and Distinct Perception\n\nThere are a number of claims about possibilities and necessities that\nseem to be intuitive \u2013 for example that it is possible that\nthings be other than they are \u2013 but Descartes will not make his\naccount of modality sensitive to all of these. Famously he subscribes\nto the view that when doing metaphysics we ought not affirm what we do\nnot clearly and distinctly perceive. Descartes reveals his commitment\nto this view in a number of passages:\n\nI should like you to remember here that, in matters which may be\nembraced by the will, I made a very careful distinction between the\nconduct of life and the contemplation of the truth. As far as the\nconduct of life is concerned, I am very far from thinking that we\nshould assent only to what is clearly perceived. \u2026But when we\nare dealing solely with the contemplation of the truth, surely no one\nhas ever denied that we should refrain from giving assent to matters\nwhich we do not perceive with sufficient\n distinctness.[1]\n\n\nIf Descartes holds that when doing metaphysics we ought not speak of\nwhat we do not clearly and distinctly perceive, a general Cartesian\ntheory of modality should not be sensitive to claims about\npossibilities or necessities that Descartes himself would identify as\nconfused. There are modal claims that only seem intuitive and obvious,\nDescartes might say, and modal claims that actually are intuitive and\nobvious, and he would want his account of modality to accommodate only\nthe latter.\n\nIndeed, one reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that there are many modal claims that we might want to give a\nrigorous analysis but that Descartes would not. That is to say, the\naccount that he offers will not necessarily square with all of the\nmodal claims that we would advance pre-reflectively. For example, we\nmight observe a blue table in front of us and put forward the claim\nthat it is possible that the table not be blue and that it could have\nbeen black. Descartes himself is going to be careful about accepting\nsuch a claim at face-value. He subscribes to the view that strictly\nspeaking our senses \u201cprovide only very obscure\ninformation\u201d (The Sixth Meditation, AT 7:84, CSM 2:58) about the\nbodies located outside of us. Our \u201cknowledge of the truth of\nsuch things [located outside of us] seems to belong to the mind alone,\nnot to the combination of mind and body\u201d (ibid., AT\n7:82\u201383, CSM 2:57), and what the mind perceives clearly about\nbodies are non-sensory qualities like extendedness and flexibility\n(The Second Meditation, AT 7:30\u201331, CSM 2:20). Or as he says\nelsewhere, the certainty that we seek in metaphysical inquiry\n\u201coccurs in the clear perceptions of the intellect and nowhere\nelse\u201d (Second Replies, AT 7:145, CSM 2:104). He adds:\n\u201ccertainty does not lie in the senses but solely in the\nunderstanding, when it possesses evident perceptions\u201d (Preface\nto the French edition of Principles of Philosophy, AT 8A:7, CSM\n1:182); \u201cIntuition is the indubitable conception of a clear and\nattentive mind which proceeds solely from the light of reason\u201d\n(Rules for the Direction of the Mind, AT 10:368, CSM 1:14). Returning\nnow to the claim that it is possible that a given table not be blue\nand that it could have been black, we need to keep in mind that on\nDescartes\u2019 view colors are not in objects in the way that we\nnormally imagine them to be (Principles of Philosophy I.68,\nAT 8A:33, CSM 1:217). We might also advance the claim that it is\npossible that our blue table could occupy a different position in\nempty space, or the claim that it could begin to move without being\npushed into motion by a cause. The first claim supposes what Descartes\ndenies \u2013 that there is empty space (Principles\nII.10\u201312, AT 8A:45\u201347, CSM 1:226\u201328) \u2013 and the\nsecond contradicts a Cartesian law of motion that falls immediately\nout of our idea of God (Principles II.36\u201337, AT\n8A:61\u201363, CSM 1:240\u201341; Nadler 1987). No matter how the\ndebate is resolved on these important systematic issues, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that Descartes\u2019 theory of modality\nwill be somewhat\n circumscribed.[2]\n His theory of modality will do justice to truths about possibility\nand truths about necessity, but much of what he takes to be possible\nor necessary is not what we would take to be possible or necessary at\nfirst glance. If we suppose that we are being charitable by allowing\nhis theory of modality to accommodate a modal claim that we are\ncertain is true, we might be foisting upon him an interpretation that\nhe would prefer to resist. No doubt he might be mistaken in what he\ntakes to be the set of true modal claims, but his account would end up\nbeing mindful of those and not any others.\n\nA related reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that in what is perhaps his most important and influential\nphilosophical work \u2013 Meditations on First Philosophy\n\u2013 Descartes often advances a claim that in the final analysis he\nrejects. He advances modal claims that he takes to be false, and many\nother claims that he advances he takes to be false as well. For\nexample, he says that what we know best we know either from or through\nthe senses (First Meditation, AT 7:18, CSM 2:17); that it is possible\nthat God is an extreme deceiver (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that\nGod does not exist (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that God, the\nsupreme being on whom all entities depend for their existence, has\nallowed the existence of an evil demon that is constantly deceiving us\n(CSM 2:20); that we should use imagination to get to know our selves\nbetter (Second Meditation, AT 7:27, CSM 2:18); that general\nperceptions are apt to be more confused than particular ones\n(ibid., AT 7:30, CSM 2:20); that bodies literally possess\nqualities like color and taste and sound (ibid.) and heat\n(The Third Meditation, AT 7:41, 43\u201344, CSM 2:28, 30\u201331);\nand that the appropriate way to inquire into whether or not the works\nof God are perfect is to examine the universe in its entirety (The\nFourth Meditation, AT 7:55\u201356, CSM 2:38\u201339). Descartes\ndoes not subscribe to a single one of these views. He thinks that upon\nfurther reflection we recognize that God is a necessary existent and\nthat it is impossible for Him to be a radical deceiver or to allow the\nexistence of a radical deceiver; that what is known best is known by\npurely mental scrutiny (Second Meditation, AT 7:31, CSM 2:21); that\ngeneral perceptions are more clear than perceptions of particulars\n(ibid.); that color and taste and sound and heat are not in\nbodies in anything like the way that we imagine (Sixth Meditation, AT\n7:81\u201383, CSM 2:56\u201358; Principles IV.198, AT\n8A:322\u201323, CSM 1:285); and that things are good by virtue of the\nfact that God wills them (Sixth Replies, AT 7:431\u201336,\nCSM 2:291\u201394).\n\nDescartes advances a number of claims that are false in the\nMeditations, but he does this for good reason. He is writing\nin the voice of a meditator who at the start of inquiry is not yet a\nCartesian and who in the course of inquiry is expressing views that\nseem to him to be true from his first-person and non-Cartesian\npoint-of-view. The meditator will express and evaluate these views and\nsee for himself how they collapse on their own weight.\n\nIt might seem surprising that as a philosopher Descartes ever flirts\nwith confusions at all. When he does so he is just employing his\nanalytic method \u2013 what he calls the \u201cbest and\ntruest method of instruction\u2026\u201d (Second Replies,\nAT 7:156, CSM 2:111). Descartes does not hide that he sometimes makes\nclaims early in the Meditations that from a later and more\nsophisticated point of view he will retract. He says,\n\nThe analytic style of writing that I adopted there [in the\nMeditations] allows us from time to time to make certain\nassumptions that have not yet been thoroughly examined; and this comes\nout in the First Meditation where I made many assumptions which I\nproceeded to refute in subsequent\n Meditations.[3]\n\n\nDescartes advances such claims because he is trying to teach his\nmetaphysics and because he thinks that his readers will not be in a\nposition to grasp that metaphysics if he only makes claims that are\n true.[4]\n Reflecting the epistemic individualism that is common in 17th-Century\nPhilosophy, Descartes insists that we should not accept a view until\nwe see its truth for ourselves (Appendix to Fifth Replies, AT\n9A:208, CSM 2:272\u201373). But he also holds that at the start of\ninquiry our conceptions and commitments are way off. Most of us are\ninclined to affirm that what we know best we know through the senses,\nalong with the other falsities already mentioned, but in addition: our\nconceptions of mind and God represent mind and God as sensible when\nthey are not; we think and speak by way of terms that we do not\nunderstand or that may have no corresponding idea; and what we take to\nbe the paradigm of a distinct perception is hardly distinct at\n all.[5]\n We take in information against the background of our current\ncommitments and conceptions, and so are primed to reject what\nconflicts with\n them.[6]\n When we work through the Meditations from the first-person\npoint-of-view, we accept or reject things when we see for ourselves\nthat they are to be accepted or rejected, but until our intellects are\nemended we do not have the best perspective from which to see the\ntruth.\n\nDescartes sees little alternative to proceeding as he does. If he just\nasserts the claims that he is certain are true, other individuals who\nare in a position to see those claims as obvious will recognize their\ntruth, but these are not necessarily the individuals whom Descartes is\ntrying to reach. He is also trying to reach a much larger set of\nindividuals: those who disagree with him, and who disagree with him\ndeeply. He must say something to these people, but if they are not in\na position to see the true, he will have to meet them where they are\nor else they will not be prepared to engage. Accordingly, he writes\nthat in the Meditations \u201cI had confined myself to what\nI originally believed quite spontaneously and with nature as my guide,\nand to the commonly held views of others, irrespective of truth or\nfalsity; for my purpose in making the survey was not to adopt these\nbeliefs, but merely to examine them\u201d (Seventh Replies,\nAT 7:482, CSM 2:325). In the Meditations Descartes is working\nto \u201cappeal to a variety of different minds\u201d (First\nReplies, AT 7:120, CSM 2:85). About the many false claims that he\nputs forward therein, he writes\n\nA philosopher would be no more surprised at such suppositions of\nfalsity than he would be if, in order to straighten out a curved\nstick, we bent it round in the opposite direction. The philosopher\nknows that it is often useful to assume falsehoods instead of truths\nin this way in order to shed light on the truth, e.g. when astronomers\nimagine the equator, the zodiac, or other circles in the sky, or when\ngeometers add new lines to given figures. Philosophers frequently do\nthe same. If someone calls this \u2018having recourse to artifice,\nsleight of hand, or circumlocution\u2019 and says it is\n\u2018unworthy of philosophical honesty and the love of truth\u2019\nthen he certainly shows that he himself, so far from being\nphilosophically honest or being prepared to employ any argument at\nall, simply wants to indulge in rhetorical display. (Fifth\nReplies, CSM 2:242)\n\n\nIn Second Replies Descartes makes a distinction between the\nsimple and primary notions of metaphysics \u2013 which are not\nderivable from anything \u2013 and other truths that can be generated\nfrom these (CSM 2:104, 111). A dilemma that he highlights is that if a\nperson is so confused that they do not recognize the truth of primary\nnotions, it is not clear what to say to them. The primary notions are\nnot derived from other notions \u2013 that is what makes\nthem simple and fundamental \u2013 and so they cannot be demonstrated\nor argued for, but if the philosopher just repeats them, that\nwon\u2019t do much good either. A further dilemma, according to\nDescartes, is that primary notions often contradict the everyday\nworldview to which most of us subscribe uncritically (CSM\n2:111\u2013112). If so, we are primed to reject the primary notions\nof metaphysics and the further disorienting conclusions that they\nentail. A philosopher like Descartes needs to say something\nto his audience \u2013 to get them to see the force of his view\n\u2013 but ironically enough, the truth will not cut it, at least not\nat first. What Descartes does, then, is to employ a version of the\nanalytic method of ancient geometry, in which claims are made that\nstrictly speaking are false but that help a student to see\n(eventually) what is true. He will emulate the practice of geometers\nlike Archimedes \u2013 who articulates the nature of a sphere on\nanalogy with a rectilinear figure that is inscribed in a circle, even\nthough the notion of a rectilinear sphere is incoherent (Fourth\nReplies, AT 7:245, CSM 2:170\u2013171). In the First Meditation\nespecially, Descartes will advance claims that are false but that he\nanticipates his readers will find plausible: we will think through the\nimplications of these claims in a way that puts us on course to arrive\nat a clear and distinct grasp of the primary notions of metaphysics.\nOn the way Descartes will make claims \u2013 including modal claims\n\u2013 that range from false to incoherent, but later on we will be\nin a position to juxtapose these against the obvious truths at which\nwe have arrived, and our earlier claims will be seen for the\nconfusions that they are.\n2. The First Meditation and the Possibility of Radical Deception\n\nFor example, in the First Meditation Descartes entertains a number of\npossibilities to the effect that we might be mistaken about results\nthat are perfectly evident to us. One such possibility is that we have\nbeen created by a supremely good God but that, for reasons unbeknownst\nto us, our nature is such that we \u201cgo wrong every time [we] add\ntwo and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler\nmatter\u201d (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14). Another is that we have not been\ncreated by God but have \u201carrived at [our] present state by fate\nor chance or a continuous chain of events\u201d (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14).\nA third is that we are constantly deceived by a malicious demon (AT\n7:22, CSM 2:15). Descartes mentions all of these possibilities to set\nup his Third Meditation point that until we know what made our minds,\nwe are not in a position to trust them and so not in a position to\nknow anything at all (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25). None of these is an actual\npossibility, though Descartes allows that we may not appreciate this\nuntil later:\n\n[Voetius claims that in my philosophy] \u201cGod is thought of as a\ndeceiver.\u201d This is foolish. Although in my First Meditation I\ndid speak of a supremely powerful deceiver, the conception there was\nin no way of the true God, since, as he himself says, it is impossible\nthat the true God should be a deceiver. But if is asked how he knows\nthat this is impossible, he must answer that he knows it from the fact\nthat it implies a contradiction \u2013 that is, it cannot be\nconceived. (\u201cLetter to Voetius,\u201d May 1643, CSMK 222)\n\n\nDescartes allows that if we are careless or not paying attention, we\ncan entertain the supposition that \u201cGod\u201d does not exist or\nis a deceiver, but he holds that upon reflection the supreme being is\na necessary existent, and a necessary existent that cannot deceive\n(The Fifth Meditation, CSM 2:46\u201348). We might have thought\notherwise at the start of inquiry, before we had carefully unpacked\nand examined our concepts \u2013 at a moment when we were not yet\nputting forward a priori non-sensory claims, which are the only sort\nof claim that are suitable as premises in a metaphysical argument. As\noften happens in philosophy, we come to recognize that there are\nthings that seem clear to us before we think them through, and we\nrecognize that the reason why they seemed clear was that we\nhadn\u2019t thought them through yet. As Descartes himself\nwrites,\n\nIn order to philosophize seriously and search out the truth about the\nthings that are capable of being known, we must first of all lay aside\nall our preconceived opinions, or at least we must take the greatest\ncare not to put our trust in any of the opinions accepted by us in the\npast until we have first scrutinized them afresh and confirmed their\ntruth. Next, we must give our attention in an orderly way to the\nnotions that we have within us, and we must judge to be true all and\nonly those whose truth we clearly and distinctly recognize when we\nattend to them in this way. \u2026When we contrast all this\nknowledge with the confused thoughts we had before, we will acquire\nthe habit of forming clear and distinct concepts of all the things\nthat can be known. These few instructions seem to me to contain the\nmost important principles of human knowledge. (Principles\nI.75, AT 8A:38\u20139, CSM 1:221)\n\n\nWhen we construct arguments on the basis of basic a priori principles\nof metaphysics \u2013 what Descartes calls \u201cprimary\nnotions\u201d (Second Replies, AT 7:145\u201346, CSM 2:104;\nPrinciples I.50, AT 8A:23\u201324, CSM 1:209) \u2013 and\nnot the non a priori premises that constitute much of the early\nthinking of Descartes\u2019 meditator, we recognize that God is a\nnecessary existent who cannot deceive and also that He is the\nindependent and supreme creator of all reality, both possible and\nactual (\u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d AT 4:118\u201319,\nCSMK 235; \u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25;\nThird Meditation, AT 7:45, CSM 2:31). If so, we know on a priori\ngrounds that the possibilities introduced in the First Meditation are\nfictional and indeed are not possibilities at all. It turns out, upon\nreflection, that God did not create them. This is not just to say that\nthe possibilities exist but do not obtain. To say that a possibility\nexists but does not obtain would be to say that it exists as a\npossibility that is not actualized; it would be to say that in\naddition to actual reality there also exists possible reality and that\nsome possible reality is never actualized. If in Descartes\u2019s\nsystem God created only actual reality and not in addition any\npossible reality, then possibilities themselves are not real \u2013\nthey have no ontological status and so are not in fact possibilities,\nbecause they are not anything. According to Descartes, God did not\ncreate the possibility that we exist with minds that might be certain\nof things that are false; He did not create the possibility that we\nevolved from chance; He did not create the possibility of an evil\ndemon. None of these possibilities exists unless they are created, and\nthey do not exist just because the cognitive deliverances of the First\nMeditation meditator tell us that they do. When we (or the meditator)\npostulated their existence in the First Meditation, we were being\nhasty, and all that we had to go on at that early stage of inquiry was\nour confused pre-Meditations conceptions.\n\nWe might wonder though if Descartes would be happy to identify the\npossibilities of the First Meditation as epistemic\npossibilities, even if they are not real possibilities. After all, the\nmeditator is entertaining doubts in the First Meditation, and she is\nhonestly reporting that because she is not yet certain that God exists\nor is not a deceiver, for all she knows God might not exist exist or\nmight be a deceiver. She concludes that it is possible that God does\nnot exist and that it is possible that He is a deceiver, and indeed\nboth of those claims, in the sense in which they are uttered, would\nappear to be true at the moment that she utters them. It certainly\nseems as though the meditator is saying something true when she\nexpresses that for all she knows God is a deceiver (or does not\nexist), but a complication arises when we consider Descartes\u2019\nown view that a mind is not really thinking of God if they are\nimagining an extremely powerful being that is a deceiver\n(\u201cLetter to Voetius,\u201d May 1643, CSMK 222, cited above).\nNor are we thinking of God if we have an imagistic idea of a giant man\non a cloud (Fifth Replies, CSM 2:252), and we are not\nthinking of mind or self if we have an imagistic idea of air or fire\n(Fifth Replies, CSM 2:264). Regardless of how we might report\nor describe our own thinking in such cases, those just are not the\nthings that we have in mind. If so, a question arises about whether or\nnot Descartes would want to allow that the First Meditation\npossibility that (for example) God is a deceiver is in fact the\nepistemic possibility that (for all the First Meditation meditator\nknows) God might be a deceiver. He would be reluctant to allow this, I\nthink, because he is committed to saying that the First Meditation\nmeditator who thinks of God as a deceiver is not thinking of God. If\nthe meditator is just thinking the letters \u2018Deus\u2019 in\nLatin, he is not thinking of God (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:150, CSMK 25), or if the meditator is thinking a\nconfused compound idea of God and sensible bodies (Second\nReplies, AT 7:130\u2013131, CSM 2:94), he is thinking of a\nchimera. Descartes will not thumb his nose at pre-Meditations\nthinking if it is a fact on the ground, but that is in part to say\nthat he holds that the possibilities of the First Meditation are\nextremely confused. The pre-Meditations thinking of the\nmeditator is what it is, and Descartes will not pretend that it is not\noperative.\n\nDescartes is very explicit about the importance of employing (what\nsome might regard as a not completely honest) pedagogical method. In\norder to maneuver his readers into a position in which they\nare able to understand his metaphysics, he needs to help them\nto clear up their ideas. If he simply tells us his view, we will hear\nit against the background of confused ideas that (on his view) it is\nimperative we discard. The view that we would walk away with would not\nbe Descartes\u2019 view but something else. Descartes therefore opts\nfor a special strategy for presenting his metaphysics: he puts things\nin terms of the confusions that we understand, otherwise we will not\nunderstand him. If we object (as does Gassendi) to this kind of\nmaneuver, Descartes insists that under the circumstances it is only\nappropriate. He does not see anything objectionable in guiding us to\ntruth by way of conceptions that are false or incoherent. Instead, he\nis providing a service:\n\n[T]ake the case of someone who imagines a deceiving god \u2013 even\nthe true God, but not yet clearly enough known to himself or to the\nothers for whom he frames his hypothesis. Let us suppose that he does\nnot misuse this fiction for the evil purpose of persuading others to\nbelieve something false of the Godhead, but uses it only to enlighten\nthe intellect, and bring greater knowledge of God\u2019s nature to\nhimself and to others. Such a person is in no way sinning in order\nthat good may come. There is no malice at all in his action; he does\nsomething which is good in itself, and no one can rebuke him for it\nexcept slanderously. (\u201cTo Buitendijck 1643,\u201d AT 4:64, CSMK\n230)\n\n\nThe possibilities that Descartes mentions early in the\nMeditations are not a part of his ontology. When he talks\nabout these, he is not interested in truth but, rather, in helping his\nreader to move through and past\n confusion.[7]\n Unless we are going to saddle Descartes with the view that it really\nis possible that our minds are radically defective and that\nnonetheless we ought to go on reasoning anyway, we should\nconclude that Descartes holds that the possibilities of the First\nMeditation have no ontological status and hence that they are nothing\nat all.\n\nBut Descartes did worry that in the wrong hands his references to the\n(incoherent) possibility of radical deception might actually backfire.\nIn a letter to Mersenne, he acknowledges that his 1637 Discourse\non the Method argumentation for the existence of God would have\nbeen more rigorous had he introduced \u201cdoubts and scruples\u201d\nthat \u201cshow\u2026 which judgements depend only on the pure\nunderstanding\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 February 1637,\u201d AT\n1:350, CSMK 53). He says that he leaves those out of the\nDiscourse but that he might include them in his\n\u201ctreatise of metaphysics\u201d (ibid.). The doubts\nthat appear in the Meditations but not in the\nDiscourse are the hyperbolic First Meditation arguments to\nthe effect that we might be mistaken about matters that are utterly\nevident to us. Descartes writes that \u201cI left th[ese] out on\npurpose and after deliberation, mainly because I had written in the\nvernacular. I was afraid that weak minds might avidly embrace the\ndoubts and scruples which I would have had to propound, and afterwards\nbe unable to follow as fully the arguments by which I would have\nendeavoured to remove them. Thus I would have set them on a false path\nand been unable to bring them back\u201d (ibid.). That is to\nsay, Descartes omits the hyperbolic doubts from the Discourse\nbecause he is afraid that some minds might take them seriously and\nreason to a point from which there is no return Cunning (2023, chapter\nfour). For example, they might conclude at the end of the First\nMeditation that it is true that it is possible that we are\ndeceived about matters that are utterly evident to us, and we might\nthen assert that all of the reasoning that comes after the First\nMeditation is entirely up for grabs. Of course, as a matter of\nhistorical fact it is not just weak minds that take seriously the\nargumentation of the First Meditation. Descartes seems to be thinking\nthat an educated reader would see the First Meditation for what it is\n\u2013 perhaps a reader who is fluent in Latin and not just the\nFrench vernacular, and who would perhaps be familiar with the methods\nof a geometer like Archimedes. And it is easy to imagine why he would\nthink that. A philosophy instructor will often start a lesson with an\nanalogy that is incoherent but that highlights the intuitive force of\nan opposing view instead: for example we might begin a class in ethics\nby pointing to surveys and case studies that show that the vast\nmajority of Nazi soldiers believed that their treatment of Jewish\nprisoners during WWII was just, and we might ask if the conclusion to\ndraw is that morality is entirely a matter of opinion, or even that\nNazi ideology is to be accepted. Perhaps a student then approaches us\nafter class and says that they would like to become a Nazi. Descartes\nwould be right to say that the student has a weak mind, though we can\nalso understand why in certain instructional circumstances he might\nwant to use a different lesson plan instead. He was mistaken to think\nthat all readers of the Meditations would notice that the\nreasoning of the First Meditation is just meant to help us to see\n\u201cwhich judgements depend only on the pure understanding,\u201d\nfor example the judgments about the nature of wax at the end of the\nSecond Meditation and the primary notions that are central to the\nargumentation for the existence of God in the Third. Those are known\nby \u201can act of purely mental scrutiny\u201d (AT 7:31, CSM 2:21),\nand as such they leave the confused claims of the First Meditation in\nthe dust.\n3. The Eternal Truths\n\nDescartes is infamous for his doctrine of the creation of the eternal\ntruths:\n\nYou ask me by what kind of causality God established the eternal\ntruths. I reply: by the same kind of causality as he created all\nthings, that is to say, as their efficient and total cause. (\u201cTo\n[Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25)\n\n\nOn the surface the position is baffling, especially when considered in\nconjunction with Descartes\u2019 view that God is omnipotent. The\nauthor of Fifth Objections, Pierre Gassendi, complained that\nthe view is very difficult to conceive. Descartes\u2019 reply is\ninteresting:\n\nYou say that you think it is \u2018very hard\u2019 to propose that\nthere is anything immutable and eternal apart from God. You would be\nright to think this if I was talking about existing things, or if I\nwas proposing something as immutable in the sense that its\nimmutability was independent of God. But just as the poets suppose\nthat the Fates were originally established by Jupiter, but that after\nthey were established he bound himself to abide by them, so I do not\nthink that the essences of things, and the mathematical truths which\nwe can know concerning them, are independent of God. Nevertheless I do\nthink that they are immutable and eternal, since the will and decree\nof God willed and decreed that they should be so. Whether you think\nthis is hard or easy to accept, it is enough for me that it is true.\n(Fifth Replies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261)\n\n\nDescartes holds that each and every thing depends on God for its\nexistence and that, as things, eternal truths depend on God as well.\nOne of Gassendi\u2019s worries is that if God can do anything and\nthus can alter any item that He creates, nothing that He creates is\nimmutable.\n\nAnother reason that Descartes\u2019 view is difficult to conceive is\nthat he takes eternal truths to be necessary. That is, it is difficult\nto conceive how eternal truths could be necessary if they were created\nby a free act of God. Descartes is clear that the eternal truths are\nnecessary: he says that \u201cthe necessity of these truths does not\nsurpass our knowledge\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 6 May 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:150, CSMK 25). If eternal truths are necessary, however, it\nshould not be the case that they could have been otherwise. Yet\nDescartes\u2019 commitment to divine omnipotence appears to commit\nhim to this view:\n\nYou ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that\nhe was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are\nequal \u2013 just as free as he was not to create the world. And it\nis certain that these truths are no more necessarily attached to his\nessence than are other created things. (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25)\n\n\nIt appears that something in Descartes\u2019 comments about the\neternal truths has to give. It might be that, since Descartes is\nclearly not prepared to adjust his commitment to divine omnipotence,\nhe instead has to abandon his view that they are necessary (Frankfurt\n1977; Plantinga 1980, 110\u2013113). On this interpretation,\ndeveloped and defended by Harry Frankfurt, all eternal truths are\ninherently contingent because they could have been false, and they\ncould have been false because God could have made their\ncontradictories true. Frankfurt\u2019s interpretation is motivated\nnot only by Descartes\u2019 commitment to divine omnipotence; there\nare also some texts:\n\n\u2026 God cannot have been determined to make it true that\ncontradictories cannot be true together, and therefore\u2026 he\ncould have done the\n opposite.[8]\n\n\nI do not think that we should ever say of anything that it cannot be\nbrought about by God. For since every basis of truth and goodness\ndepends on his omnipotence, I would not dare to say that God cannot\nmake a mountain without a valley, or bring it about that 1 and 2 are\nnot\n 3.[9]\n\n\nIf Frankfurt is right, Cartesian eternal truths are not really\nnecessary; they \u201care inherently as contingent as any other\npropositions\u201d (42). They may appear to be necessary to our\nrational faculties, but this is just a function of the makeup of our\nrational faculties and not of the necessity of the truths themselves.\nFrankfurt then argues more generally that Descartes holds that for all\nwe know our rational faculties may be wrong about other things as\nwell. After all, we are mistaken about the necessity of the eternal\ntruths, which seems so very obvious, and so we might might be mistaken\nabout anything else that is similarly evident. If Frankfurt is\ncorrect, Descartes holds that there is a way that reality appears from\nthe viewpoint of the clearest of human reasoning, and the best that we\ncan do as rational agents is to take up that viewpoint. But we can\nnever get outside of it to see how things are\n absolutely.[10]\n\nIf Descartes holds that eternal truths are necessary in any robust\nsense, Frankfurt\u2019s view has an obvious drawback. It also suffers\nfrom the problem that it [Frankfurt\u2019s view] cannot be formulated\nwithout supposing that Descartes allows that there is a human\nperspective from which eternal truths can be seen to be non-necessary,\nbut an important component of Frankfurt\u2019s view is the thesis\nthat Descartes thinks that it is part of the structure of a human mind\nto regard eternal truths as wholly necessary.\n\nAnother drawback for Frankfurt\u2019s view is that it is\nself-contradictory in postulating that, according to Descartes, we\ncannot make claims about what reality is like absolutely. On\nFrankfurt\u2019s view, Descartes holds that God is omnipotent in the\nsense that He can do anything at all and has authority over even the\neternal truths. That is to say, Descartes holds that absolutely\nspeaking it is true that God can do anything at all and has\nauthority over the eternal truths. Frankfurt\u2019s Descartes is not\nentitled to say that. He is only entitled to say that from a finite\nhuman perspective it appears to be true that God can do anything and\nhas authority over the eternal truths. If Frankfurt is right, what is\nmaximally obvious to a finite mind is just that \u2013 what is\nmaximally obvious to a finite mind. It is not a guarantee of actual\ntruth.\n\nAn alternative view (developed and defended by Edwin Curley) is that\nDescartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, but that they are\nnot necessarily so. On this reading, Descartes\u2019 view involves\niterated modalities: a number of truths are possibly necessary, but\nGod chooses only some of these possibilities to be the actual\nnecessary truths (Curley 1984, 579\u2013603). One of the passages\nthat supports such a reading is from the already-cited letter to\nMesland:\n\nAnd even if God has willed that some truths should be necessary, this\ndoes not mean that he willed them necessarily; for it is one thing to\nwill that they be necessary, and quite another to will this\nnecessarily, or to be necessitated to will\n it.[11]\n\n\nOn Curley\u2019s reading, Descartes secures the necessity of eternal\ntruths by arguing that God willed them to be necessary, and hence it\ncan be said that it is false that they could have been otherwise. But\nDescartes also holds that God created the possibility that they not be\nnecessary, and that is why they are not necessarily necessary, as it\ncould have been the case that they could have been otherwise. Some\ncommentators have argued that a problem for Curley\u2019s view is\nthat it cannot allow Descartes to hold that eternal truths are\nabsolutely necessary \u2013 if it could have been the case that a\ngiven truth could have been otherwise, then it is not a necessary\n truth.[12]\n Curley indeed admits that, on his view, Descartes was confused about\nthe modal status of eternal truths (Curley 1984, 589). They might be\nhypothetically necessary, but nothing more than\n that.[13]\n Another problem is that Curley\u2019s view appears to put a severe\nconstraint on divine omnipotence: if God wants to make an eternal\ntruth false, He cannot make it false without first willing that it not\nbe necessary, for a necessary truth cannot be made false. If God\nalters the status of the truth so that it is no longer a necessary\ntruth, He can make it false, but He cannot make it false straightaway.\nA final problem is that Curley\u2019s reading supposes that there is\nsome point at which God\u2019s will could have been otherwise, but\nGod is eternal, and part of His essential perfection is to be wholly\nimmutable (Principles II.36, AT 8A:62).\n\nAn alternative reading of Descartes\u2019 comments on the eternal\ntruths suggests still another interpretation. Jonathan Bennett has\npointed out that in some of the key passages in question Descartes\ndoes not say that God can make contradictories true, but that we\nshould not say that God cannot make contradictories true (Bennett\n1994, 653\u201355). In such passages, for example in the\nalready-cited 1648 letter to Arnauld, Descartes is not saying anything\nabout God\u2019s power but about us and what we ought not say.\nPresumably, he is just invoking his Fourth Meditation rule for judging\nin these passages, as he is very explicit that when we do metaphysics\nwe ought not affirm what we do not clearly and distinctly\n understand.[14]\n Since we do not come close to understanding what it would be for one\nand two to add up to something other than three, and since we do not\nunderstand God\u2019s being unable to do something, the prospect that\nGod cannot make 1 and 2 not add to 3 is hopelessly confused.\nAccordingly, we ought not speak of it. The same analysis also applies\nto the important passage in the 1644 Mesland letter. Immediately after\nsaying that God can make contradictories true together, Descartes\ntakes it back: \u201c\u2026 even if this be true, we should not try\nto comprehend it, since our nature is incapable of doing so.\u201d\nDescartes\u2019 claim that God can make contradictories true is\nsomething that we ought not affirm when doing metaphysics and thus\nsomething that should have no bearing on our interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019 system. He tentatively flirts with the claim that God\ncould have made it possible for contradictories to be true together,\nbut then for systematic reasons he retracts it: he says that \u201cwe\nshould not put these thoughts before our minds\u201d and that in God\nthere is \u201conly a single activity, entirely simple and entirely\npure.\u201d Perhaps in a nod to divine omnipotence he says that God\ncould have made contradictories to be true together, but then he\nchecks himself and remembers that God wills by a single act that is\nimmutable and eternal. God is omnipotent, for Descartes, but as in any\nother case he understands omnipotence in way that squares with the\nother pillars of his system.\n\nBennett is right to emphasize the passages in which Descartes says of\na number of incoherent states of affairs that we ought not say that\nGod cannot bring them about. Bennett extends his view in ways that\nlead to some of the same problems that arise for Frankfurt, however.\nAccording to Bennett, Descartes does not take true modal claims to\napply or conform to real possibilities or necessities. In particular,\nthey do not apply to God. Instead, modality is just a function of how\nour minds have been constructed. Bennett thus arrives at a conclusion\nthat is similar to the one in Frankfurt, but from a different point of\ndeparture. Frankfurt supposes that for Descartes God is omnipotent in\nsuch a way that He can make eternal truths false, and thus that for\nany truth that we find to be necessary, its necessity is merely\napparent. But Bennett does not think that any modal truths\npertain to God. He grounds his interpretation on a text in which\nDescartes appears to offer the conceptualist account straightaway:\n\nIf by \u2018possible\u2019 you mean what everyone commonly means,\nnamely \u2018whatever does not conflict with our human\nconcepts\u2019, then it is manifest that the nature of God, as I have\ndescribed it, is possible in this sense, since I supposed it to\ncontain only what, according to our clear and distinct perceptions,\nmust belong to it; and hence it cannot conflict with our concepts.\nAlternatively, you may well be imagining some other kind of\npossibility which relates to the object itself; but unless this\nmatches the first sort of possibility it can never be known by the\nhuman intellect, and so it does not so much support a denial of\nGod\u2019s nature and existence as serve to undermine every other\nitem of human knowledge. (Second Replies, CSM 2:107; Bennett\n1994, 647\u2013648)\n\n\nLike Frankfurt, Bennett concludes that any claims that we make about\nGod and His necessary existence, or about the impossibility of His\nbeing a deceiver, are not a reflection of real possibilities and\nnecessities that pertain to God, but just a reflection of our minds\nand how we are compelled to think (Bennett 1994, 656\u2013658). A\nworry for Bennett (which as we have seen is also a worry for\nFrankfurt) is that Descartes appears to want to secure at least some\nresults that are true absolutely speaking \u2013 for example, that\nGod is supremely independent and that God has created finite minds in\na way that puts constraints on what we take to be possible. In\naddition, a textual concern for Bennett is that in the passage that he\ntakes to be the \u201cstrongest evidence for [his] reading\u201d\n(Bennett 1994, 647) Descartes does not say that possibility has no\nrelation to the \u201cobject itself.\u201d He says that any serious\naccount of possibility must coincide with what our concepts tell us is\npossible; otherwise, there would be no way for our minds to know\npossibility, and \u201cevery other item of human knowledge\u2026\n[would be] undermine[d]\u201d as a result. This is an evidential\nmisfire, and even worse \u2013 Bennett\u2019s interpretation\nsupposes that there is an unbridgeable gap between what we take to be\ntrue and what is actually true, and as such it would appear to\nundermine all human knowledge from the very start. It rules out all\nhuman knowledge from the start by supposing that for Descartes we can\nnever obtain any assurance that our clearest and most compelling\nperceptions of reality correspond to the way that reality is in fact.\nIf there is an interpretation of Descartes according to which there is\nno such gap, Cartesian knowledge would have at least some chance at\n vindication.[15]\n\nLilli Alanen has proposed an interpretation along these lines. She\nobjects to all of the views considered above: if they do not downplay\nthe necessity of Descartes\u2019 eternal truths by making them merely\nhypothetical, the interpretations eliminate their necessity altogether\nand at the same time commit Descartes to saying that best we can do\nepistemologically speaking is to arrive at results that seem to be\ntrue from human our point-of-view (Alanen 2008, 359\u2013364). Alanen\nherself concludes that in Descartes\u2019s system there are necessary\ntruths that are fully necessary and that have been authored by God.\nShe adds, however, that our understanding of divine activity is\nlimited in such a way that we have no understanding of how necessities\n(or possibilities) could be the product of His free will\n(ibid., 364\u2013367). A fulcrum point of Alanen\u2019s\nview is that there are no modal claims that apply to divine activity\nbecause God is always the author of any modal claims and hence they\nare always the subsequent product of that activity:\n\nThe idea that I take Descartes\u2019s controversial claims to express\nis, roughly, that it would be a mistake to assume some notion of\nmodality in terms of which Descartes\u2019s concept of divine power\ncould be explicated, and that we should not even try to do so. There\nis no modality prior to or independently of God\u2019s act of\nexercising his power\u2026. (ibid., 364)\n\n\nAlanen argues that for Descartes we are being hasty if we attempt to\npoint to considerations that we do not at all understand \u2013 for\nexample divine activity and any modalities that we think might apply\nto it \u2013 and if we then appeal to those considerations as a basis\nfor understanding the necessity of eternal truths. But that does not\nmean that we should conclude that truths about the necessary and the\npossible are merely subjective. Eternal truths like that two and two\nadd to four are in fact necessary, even if we do not understand the\nbackstory of God\u2019s production of them (ibid.,\n365\u2013367).\n\nAlanen\u2019s view is ingenious, but a serious worry that arises for\nit is that Descartes appears to hold (and without the slightest bit of\nequivocation) that there are modal claims that pertain to God and that\nare useful for explicating His behavior. For example, we conclude in\nthe Fourth Meditation that God cannot be a deceiver and therefore that\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. We would also\nappear to be entitled to include that because God is wholly immutable,\nthe laws of nature are utterly constant (Principles of\nPhilosophy II.36, CSM 1:240). Alanen is certainly right that none\nof the necessary truths that God wills would apply to His activity,\nbut that does not mean that no modal notions at all apply to His\nactivity \u2013 especially if Descartes himself makes so clear that\ndivine immutability and the impossibility of divine deception are data\nthat are to guide us in inquiry. And they are not simply guides in the\nsense of regulative principles or heuristics. We cannot once and for\nall lay down a result, for Descartes, unless we recognize that it is\ntrue that God exists and that it is impossible for Him to be\na deceiver. Descartes holds that there are modal claims that apply to\nGod, and he holds that God does not author these claims. Instead, they\napply to God by His nature. God is not the cause of any aspect of His\nessence or existence: His \u201cessence is so immense that he does\nnot need an efficient cause in order to exist\u201d (Fourth\nReplies, AT 7:241, CSM 2:168); \u201che has existed for eternity\nand will abide for eternity\u201d (The Fifth Meditation, AT 7:67, CSM\n2:46); \u201cHis essence is such that He possesses from\neternity\u201d all the divine attributes, and \u201cit is impossible\nfor such a being to have the power and will to give itself something\nnew\u201d (Fourth Replies, AT 7:241, CSM 2:168). For\nexample, God does not decide His own immutability, and He does not\ndecide any other attributes that apply to His nature, but as in all\ncases there are no truths about modality that are independent of\nHim.\n\nAnother attempt to preserve the necessity of eternal truths in\nDescartes\u2019 system is to run with such data and argue that if God\nwills a truth for eternity and His will is wholly immutable, the truth\nis eternal and necessary, and there does not exist the possibility\nthat it be otherwise. Such a possibility would not exist automatically\n\u2013 for it would only exist if God created it \u2013 and if\nDescartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, that is a signal\nthat he supposes that God never created that possibility at all.\n\nOne important passage is in the 1644 letter to Mesland (quoted above)\nin which Descartes says that \u201cGod cannot have been determined to\nmake it true that contradictories be true together, and therefore that\nhe could have done the opposite.\u201d As has already been noted,\nlater in the paragraph he takes it all back. In the larger passage, he\nwrites,\n\nBut if we would know the immensity of his power we should not put\nthese thoughts before our minds, nor should we conceive any precedence\nor priority between his intellect and will; for the idea which we have\nof God teaches us that there is in him only a single activity,\nentirely simple and entirely pure. This is well expressed by the\ndoctrine of St. Augustine: \u2018They are so because thou\nsee\u2019est them to be so\u2019; because in God seeing and willing\nare one and the same thing.\n\n\nThere are similar passages elsewhere in Descartes\u2019 corpus, where\nthe view that Descartes that takes himself to be able to express, and\nto express intelligibly, is that \u201cthere is always a single\nidentical and perfectly simple act by means of which he [God]\nsimultaneously understands, wills, and accomplishes everything.\u201d\nIf God is wholly immutable and wills the truths of mathematics and\ngeometry in a single act for eternity, it would appear that we are\nentitled to infer the result that those truths are necessary, just as\nwe can infer from the impossibility of divine deception that our clear\nand distinct perceptions are true. We must also consider the Third\nMeditation passage in which Descartes says that in God there is\nabsolutely nothing that is potential (AT 7:47, CSM 2:32). If there is\njust a single activity in God, and if it is simple and eternal, and\nalso immutable, then it makes no sense to talk of God as changing\ncourse and actualizing an alternative set of possibilities aside from\nthan the one that actually obtains (Cunning 2023, 192\u2013211). It\nmight be tempting to think that although God wills all of creaturely\nreality by a single immutable and eternal volition, God might have had\na different immutable and eternal volition. But in God there is\nabsolutely no potential being \u2013 a kind of being that Descartes\nsays \u201cstrictly speaking is nothing\u201d (ibid.). If\nso, there do not exist alternative possible eternal truths, and there\ndoes not exist the possibility of a change in God\u2019s eternal and\nimmutable will, and so (contra Frankfurt et al) eternal truths are\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nA final consideration to mention in favor of the view that Descartes\nholds that eternal truths are absolutely necessary is that it is\nsensitive to the important worry raised by Broughton (1987) and Nadler\n(1987) \u2013 that if Descartes holds that the eternal truths of\nmathematics, etc., could have been otherwise, then he is committed to\nthe conclusion that physical laws admit of more necessity than (for\nexample) the truth that two and two add to four. Descartes is clear\nthat physical laws follow from God\u2019s nature (for example\nPrinciples II.36\u201337, CSM 1:240\u2013241), and so they\nare absolutely necessary, but that would mean that he supposes that\nphysical laws are more necessary than eternal truths. If anything, we\nwould expect the story to go the other way around \u2013 that eternal\ntruths would be necessary and that physical laws would be wholly\ncontingent. In Descartes\u2019 system it would appear that laws of\nphysics are necessary and that eternal truths are necessary as\nwell.\n\nStill, we need to contend with the passage in which Descartes says\nthat God was free to make the radii of a circle unequal, and with the\npassages in which Descartes says more generally that God is free with\nrespect to each and every thing that He does. One way to read these\npassages is to make the assumption that Descartes has a libertarian\nconception of divine freedom and then conclude that if Descartes says\nthat God is free to do something, there exists the possibility that He\ndo it and also the possibility that He do something else (perhaps the\n opposite).[16]\n Descartes himself appears to understand divine freedom in very\ndifferent terms, however. He writes,\n\nAs for the freedom of the will, the way in which it exists in God is\nquite different from the way in which it exists in us. It is\nself-contradictory to suppose that the will of God was not indifferent\nfrom eternity with respect to everything that has happened or will\never happen; for it is impossible to imagine that anything is thought\nof in the divine intellect as good or true, or worthy of belief or\naction or omission, prior to the decision of the divine will to make\nit so. (Sixth Replies, AT 7:431\u201332, CSM 2:291)\n\n\nDescartes holds that God is free in creating the eternal truth that\nthe radii of a circle are equal. If God\u2019s freedom in this and\nother cases just consists in His complete indifference and\nindependence, then the Cartesian claim that God is free to do\nx does not entail that there exists the possibility that God\nnot do x or that there exists the possibility that God do\nsomething\n else.[17]\n\nDescartes makes a number of otherwise puzzling claims about\nGod\u2019s freedom to create the eternal truths, but if we interpret\nthese in the light of Descartes\u2019 stated conception of divine\nfreedom, they begin to look fairly mundane. A problem, however, is\nthat taken together the claims encourage the reading that Descartes is\na necessitarian. We consider for example the following comment that\nDescartes makes to Mersenne:\n\nIt will be said that if God had established these truths he could\nchange them as a king changes his laws. To this the answer is: Yes he\ncan, if his will can change. \u2018But I understand them to be\neternal and unchangeable.\u2019 \u2013 I make the same judgment\nabout God. \u2018But his will is free.\u2019 \u2013 Yes, but his\npower is beyond our grasp. (\u201cTo Mersenne, 15 April 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:145\u201346, CSMK 23).\n\n\nHere Descartes allows that there exists the possibility that God\ncreate alternate eternal truths only if God\u2019s will is mutable,\nbut of course Descartes holds that God\u2019s will is wholly\nimmutable, and immutable for eternity. God is still free of course,\nbut in a way that squares with His immutability: divine freedom is to\nbe understood in terms of indifference and independence. The worry\nthat is starting to arise is that if God is the immutable and eternal\nauthor of all reality \u2013 the eternal truths and everything else\nthat exists \u2013 then there does not exist the possibility that God\nwill an alternate series of creatures, and hence God does not author\nthat possibility, but instead everything that happens happens\nnecessarily. Descartes subscribes to a version of the Spinozistic view\nthat divine freedom is a matter of\n indifference,[18]\n and there is also some systematic evidence that Descartes accepts the\nSpinozistic doctrine of necessitarianism. As Descartes recognizes in\nthe 15 April 30 letter to Mersenne, we might encounter some cognitive\ndissonance in recognizing God\u2019s freedom as\n omnipotence.[19]\n He appears to subscribe to the view that the eternal truths are\nnecessary and that everything else that happens is necessary as\n well.[20]\n As he is reported to have said in Conversation with\nBurman:\n\nConcerning ethics and religion,\u2026 the opinion has prevailed that\nGod can be altered, because of the prayers of mankind; for no one\nwould have prayed to God if he knew, or had convinced himself, that\nGod was unalterable\u2026. From the metaphysical point of view,\nhowever, it is quite unintelligible that God should be anything but\ncompletely unalterable. It is irrelevant that the decrees could have\nbeen separated from God; indeed, this should not really be asserted.\nFor although God is completely indifferent with respect to all things,\nhe necessarily made the decrees he did, since he necessarily willed\nwhat was best, even though it was of his own will that he did what was\nbest. We should not make a separation here between the necessity and\nthe indifference that apply to God\u2019s decrees; although his\nactions were completely indifferent, they were also completely\nnecessary. Then again, although we may conceive that the decrees could\nhave been separated from God, this is merely a token procedure of our\nown reasoning: the distinction thus introduced between God himself and\nhis decrees is a mental, not a real one. In reality the decrees could\nnot have been separated from God: he is not prior to them or distinct\nfrom them, nor could he have existed without them. (AT 5:166, CSMK\n348)\n\n\nWe must repeat again, however, that this latter passage is from\nConversation with Burman, which was an interview in which\nDescartes reported his views, and not a primary text that Descartes\nwrote himself. The view that Descartes puts forward in the passage is\nvery much in line with the texts in which Descartes says that God is\nsimple and immutable, and creates by way of a single unchanging act\nfor all eternity, and indeed it pushes those texts to their logical\nconclusion. The passage is from an interview, however, and some might\nworry that it is not fully authoritative.\n\nIf Descartes holds in the final analysis that everything that happens\nhappens necessarily, it is easy to see how he can hold that eternal\ntruths are necessary and created by a God that is free (in the\nCartesian sense). However, Descartes will still have to contend with\nthe objection that there are texts in which he seems to be committed\nto the existence of unactualized possibilities and, in particular,\ntexts in which he appears to be committed to a non-compatibilist view\nof human\n freedom.[21]\n This objection will be discussed in sections four and six below.\n\nThus far we have considered the interpretive issue of whether or not\nDescartes\u2019 eternal truths could have been otherwise. A question\nthat still remains to be considered concerns the ontological status of\nDescartes\u2019 eternal truths, regardless of whether or not they\ncould have been otherwise.\n\nOne view is that since Descartes\u2019 eternal truths are neither\nfinite mental things, finite physical things, nor God, they must be\nsomething akin to Platonic forms (Kenny 1970, 692\u2013700). A\nproblem with this view, of course, is that it does violence to\nDescartes\u2019 parsimonious dualism. Another problem with the view\nis that Descartes says that eternal truths are beings which\n\u201chave no existence outside our thought\u201d\n(Principles I.48, AT 8A:23, CSM 1:208).\n\nA second view is that eternal truths are to be located in God\n(Schmaltz 1991, 135; Rozemond 2008, 41\u201363). One of the merits of\nthis view is that it provides for eternal truths to be eternal in a\nvery robust sense. God is eternal, and anything else is eternal if it\nis housed in His eternal mind. Still, the view conflicts with the fact\nthat Descartes holds that eternal truths are creatures and are housed\nin finite minds only.\n\nA third reading of Descartes on eternal truths is that they are ideas\nin finite minds. If truth is the conformity of thought with its object\n(\u201cTo Mersenne, 16 October 1639,\u201d AT 2:597, CSMK 139), then\neternal truths are ideas. But Descartes has also said that eternal\ntruths have no existence outside of our thought. They are true ideas,\nbut not true ideas in the mind of God because eternal truths are\ncreatures. A problem with this third reading, however, is that,\nalthough it allows eternal truths to be truths, it is not\nclear that it allows them to be eternal (Chappell 1997,\n123\u201327). In some passages Descartes does distance himself from\nthe appellation \u2018eternal truth\u2019: he refers to \u201cthose\ntruths which are called eternal\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 May\n1638,\u201d AT 2:138, CSMK 103) and to \u201c[t]he mathematical\ntruths which you call eternal\u201d (To Mersenne, 15 April 1630, AT\n1:145, CSMK 23). And he allows that things can be identified as\n\u2018eternal\u2019 so long as they \u201care always the\nsame\u201d (Fifth Replies, AT 7:381, CSM 2:262). So a\ndeflationary view of the eternality of Cartesian eternal truths might\nbe in order. However, Descartes says to Mersenne that \u201cfrom all\neternity [God] willed them [eternal truths] to be, and by that very\nfact he created them\u201d (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:152, CSMK 25). Descartes as a rule shies away from making claims\nabout theological matters, but it is not clear that we want to\nattribute to him the view that finite minds are co-eternal with\n God.[22]\n Perhaps he holds that human minds exist at every point in the series\nthat God wills, or perhaps his understanding of the eternality of\neternal truths is more deflationary: God wills a single series for all\neternity, and that series includes unchanging true ideas in finite\nminds.\n4. Unactualized Possibles\n\nDescartes is unambiguous that there are some things that we clearly\nand distinctly perceive to be possible. To Mersenne he speaks of\nbeings whose existence we clearly perceive to be possible (\u201cTo\nMersenne, March 1642,\u201d AT 3:544\u201345, CSMK 211); he also\nsays that God \u201ccan bring about everything that I clearly and\ndistinctly recognize as possible\u201d (Fourth Replies, AT\n7:219, CSM 2:154). In First Replies he says that\n\n\u2026we must distinguish between possible and necessary existence.\nIt must be noted that possible existence is contained in the concept\nor idea of everything that we clearly and distinctly understand; but\nin no case is necessary existence so contained except in the case of\nthe idea of\n God.[23]\n\n\nIn addition, he says to Mesland that \u201cour mind is finite and so\ncreated as to be able to perceive as possible things which God has\nwished to be in fact\n possible.\u201d[24]\n The interpretive issue here is what Descartes is talking about when\nhe speaks in such terms. One interpretation that immediately suggests\nitself is that Descartes holds that there are things or states of\naffairs that, though not actual, are counterfactually\n possible.[25]\n A number of considerations speak in favor of such a reading. One is\nthat Descartes\u2019 view that mind and body are really distinct\nappears to be the view that minds and bodies that are in fact united\ncan exist\n apart.[26]\n Another is that Descartes says that we have clear and distinct\nperceptions of possible existence and of what is possible, thus making\nit appear that he holds that God\u2019s creatures include not only\nactuals but also unactualized\n possibles.[27]\n Finally, a possibilist reading fits Descartes within a long tradition\nof figures like Scotus and Bradwardine who posit possible being to\nsecure the meaning and reference of claims about things that could be\nbut aren\u2019t (Normore 1991, 69\u201371; Normore 1986, 224,\n231\u201334). If Descartes wants to make claims about unactualized\npossibles and if he does not want those claims to be non-sensical,\nunactualized possibles need to have some kind of ontological status in\nhis system.\n\nDescartes may in fact be committed to attributing reality to\nunactualized possibles, but a few interpretive problems arise if he\ndoes. One is that as we have seen he says elsewhere that unactualized\nbeing is nothing. In the Third Meditation, he argues that the\nobjective reality of the idea of God cannot have been caused by\npotential perfections towards which a finite being might be evolving\nbecause potentialities are nothing and so have no causal power. He\nsays,\n\n\u2026 I perceive that the objective being of an idea cannot be\nproduced merely by potential being, which strictly speaking is\nnothing, but only by actual or formal being. (AT 7:47, CSM 2:32)\n\n\nIf Descartes holds that potential being is nothing, then it is\ndifficult to see how he can include unactualized possibles in his\nontology.\n\nAnother interpretive problem is that it is difficult to see exactly\nwhere possible reality would fit into Descartes\u2019 ontology. For\nDescartes, all reality depends for its existence on God \u2013 even\npossible reality (\u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d AT\n4:118\u20139, CSMK 235). A possible being is thus a creature with an\nontological status. Descartes holds that truth is the conformity of\nthought with its object, that \u201c[t]ruth consists in being\u201d\n(\u201cTo Clerselier, 23 April 1649,\u201d AT 5:356, CSMK 377), and\nthat true ideas are \u201cideas of real things\u201d (The Third\nMeditation, AT 7:43, CSM 2:30). Clear and distinct perceptions of\npossibilities conform to reality and are of real things; they have a\ntruth-maker. A clearly and distinctly perceived possibility has some\nontological status, and the question is what exactly that is. This is\na question on which the Descartes literature has been largely silent,\nbut the options would appear to be that possibilities are either\ncreatures or ideas in the mind of God.\n\nIf possible beings are creatures, there is some difficulty in making\nroom for them in Descartes\u2019 ontology. Descartes is fairly clear\nthat the only creatures that exist are finite minds and bodies and\ntheir modes:\n\nI recognize only two ultimate classes of things: first, intellectual\nof thinking things, i.e. those which pertain to mind or thinking\nsubstance; and secondly, material things, i.e. those which pertain to\nextended substance or body. Perception, volition and all the modes\nboth of perceiving and willing are referred to thinking substance;\nwhile to extended substance belong size (that is, extension in length,\nbreadth and depth), shape, motion, position, divisibility of component\nparts and the\n like.[28]\n\n\nOne category of being in Descartes\u2019 ontology is thinking\nsubstance (and its modes), and another is extended substance (and its\nmodes). If Descartes\u2019 possibles are just created thinking or\nextended substances, then presumably they are actuals and not\npossibles.\n\nOf course, one might suggest that Descartes\u2019 dualism entails\nthat there are two kinds of things \u2013 thinking things and\nmaterial things \u2013 but that in each of these classes there are\nsubstances with actual existence and also substances with possible\nexistence. On such a view, the class of thinking substances (for\nexample) includes thinking substances with actual existence and\nthinking substances with possible existence.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this view, however. One is that\nDescartes holds that it follows from God\u2019s essence that God is\neternal and that His will is wholly immutable (The Third Meditation,\nAT 7:45, CSM 2:31; Principles I.56, AT 8A:26, CSM 1:211;\n\u201cTo Mersenne, 15 April 1630,\u201d AT 1:145\u20136, CSMK 23;\nPrinciples II:36, AT 8A:61, CSM 1:24). If it is a necessary\ntruth that God is eternal and that His will is immutable, and if God\ncontains absolutely no potentiality, then there does not exist the\npossibility that God\u2019s eternal will could have been other than\nit is. So that possibility does not exist; and neither does it appear\nthat there exist any possible creatures. Descartes holds that there is\na single series that God preordains and that is (as would be expected)\nimmutable (Principles I.40\u201341, AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). If\nGod created things that were merely possible, it is unclear how He\nwould be able to actualize them instead of the things that are\nactualized in the series, if none of the requisite possibilities\nexist, and so it is unclear how they would constitute\npossibilities. These alleged possibilities (if they are\nanything) would be among all of the other creatures; they would be\nactuals.\n\nIt might of course be the case that Descartes just insists that there\nare possible existents in addition to actual existents. Alternately,\nit might be the case that like Spinoza (in Ethics Part IV,\ndefinitions three and four), Descartes uses the expression\n\u201cpossible existence\u201d to describe actually-existing\ncreatures, and in a way that is consistent with a denial of non-actual\nreality. For example, in some places Descartes identifies things as\nhaving possible existence to highlight that they are dependent\ncreatures, and creatures whose existence cannot be read straight from\ntheir concept. To describe the kind of existence had by finite\ncreatures generally, he uses \u2018possible existence\u2019 and\n\u2018contingent existence\u2019 interchangeably: he sometimes\nspeaks of the beings that depend on God for their existence as having\n\u201cpossible or contingent existence\u201d (Second\nReplies, AT 7:166, CSM 2:117; Notae, AT 8B:361, CSM\n1:306), and sometimes he speaks of them as having just\n\u201ccontingent existence\u201d (Principles I.15, AT\n8A:10, CSM 1:198). When he says that creatures have possible\nor contingent existence, he identifies the two kinds of\nexistence: \u201cpossible or [sive] contingent\nexistence\u201d (AT 7:166). If contingent existence is just the kind\nof existence had by beings that depend for their existence on\nGod\u2019s will and whose existence cannot be established by an\nanalysis of their concept alone (Fifth Meditation, AT 7:63\u201366,\nCSM 2:44\u201346; Rules for the Direction of the Mind, AT\n10:421\u201322, CSM 1:45\u201346), then the fact that a thing has\npossible existence in Descartes\u2019 ontology does not suggest that\nthe thing does not actually exist. Such a thing exists, but in a way\nthat has it wholly dependent on God. Descartes also suggests this\ndefinition of \u201cpossible existence\u201d when he contrasts\nnecessary existence with the kind of existence had by creatures in\nFirst Replies: unlike necessary existence, the existence had\nby a creature is marked by the fact that it \u201chas no power to\ncreate itself or maintain itself in existence\u201d (AT 7:118, CSM\n2:84). It might be that like some of his predecessors Descartes is\nusing \u2018possible existence\u2019 to describe a kind of being had\nby actually existing\n things.[29]\n\nIf possibilities are not creatures that exist in addition to thinking\nsubstances and extended substances, another interpretive option is to\nsay that they are ideas in the mind of God, but that God does not\nactualize. This interpretive option is precluded by Descartes\u2019\ncommitment to the identity of God\u2019s will, intellect, and\ncreative activity:\n\n\u2026in God, willing, understanding, and creating are all the same\nthing without one being prior to the other even conceptually.\n(\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25\u201326)\n\n\nIn God willing and knowing are a single thing in such a way that by\nthe very fact of willing something he knows it and it is only for this\nreason that such a thing is true. (\u201cTo Mersenne, 6 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:149, CSMK 24)\n\n\nA philosopher like Leibniz will insist on a distinction between\nGod\u2019s understanding and will so as to secure the existence of\nthings in God\u2019s understanding that God does not actually create.\nA philosopher like Spinoza will point out that a thinker who is\ncommitted to the identity of God\u2019s will and intellect is\ncommitted to the view that there is nothing that God understands that\nGod does not create. Spinoza will add that such a thinker is not\nrestricting God\u2019s omnipotence if God is the cause of all being\nand if alleged unactualized possibilities are outside the scope of\nGod\u2019s intellect and will. Descartes appears to be siding with\nSpinoza here: what is not the object of God\u2019s\nunderstanding is nothing at all, and what is the object of God\u2019s\nunderstanding is created and made\n actual.[30]\n If Descartes is seriously committed to the identity of God\u2019s\nintellect and will, it is difficult to see how he can also be\ncommitted to the existence of unactualized possibles.\n\nThere are a number of passages in which Descartes speaks of what is\npossible. To fix an interpretation of these passages, we can look to a\nnumber of different places. One is common-sense. We might argue that\nany view is crazy that does not admit that there are things that could\nhappen or exist but that do not. Since Descartes is not crazy, what he\nmust mean when he speaks of the possible is unactualized being. Or, we\nmight argue that Descartes is continuing in the tradition of thinkers\nwho clearly do posit unactualized possibles. If these figures\ninclude unactualized being within their ontologies, and if Descartes\nis building on their work, then his claims about the possible are\nabout unactualized being. Or, we might attempt to isolate parts of\nDescartes\u2019 system that have a bearing on what\n\u201cpossible\u201d might mean in his system. Parts of this system\nentail that \u2018possible existence\u2019 is just the actual\nexistence of dependent beings. If by \u201cpossible existence\u201d\nDescartes just means the dependent existence of actually existing\ncreatures, then passages in which Descartes speaks of a thing as being\npossible or having possible existence are not evidence that Descartes\nholds that there are things that could be but are not. Of course, it\nmight just be the case that Descartes has reason to help himself to\nentities that the rest of his system shuts out.\n\nIf Descartes does hold that there are things that could be but are\nnot, his view still demands the important qualification discussed in\nthe first section above. He of course realizes that in everyday\ndiscourse we speak of things that can happen but don\u2019t. However,\nif our understanding of these things is not clear and distinct, and if\nour understanding of them as possible is not clear and distinct, then\nDescartes will not introduce them as possibilities. Descartes\nappreciates that according to common ways of speaking, all kinds of\nthings are possible. As we have seen, he considers this concept of\n\u2018possible\u2019 after Mersenne introduces it in Second\nObjections:\n\nIf by \u2018possible\u2019 you mean what everyone commonly means,\nnamely \u2018whatever does not conflict with our human\nconcepts\u2019, then it is manifest that the nature of God, as I have\ndescribed it, is possible in this sense\u2026. (Second\nReplies, AT 7:150, CSM 2:107)\n\n\nHere Descartes might seem to be offering a theory of possibility\naccording to which what it means for something to be possible is just\nfor it to be conceivable (Bennett 1994, 647\u201349). However, this\ncannot be Descartes\u2019 view. Descartes holds that whatever we\nclearly and distinctly perceive is true and that truth is \u201cthe\nconformity of thought with its object\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 16\nOctober 1639,\u201d AT 2:597, CSMK 139). If a possibility that we are\nconsidering is clearly and distinctly perceived, then our clear and\ndistinct perception conforms to reality, and the possibility that we\nare conceiving is not merely conceptual. Instead, there is also an\nobject to which the clear and distinct perception conforms \u2013 the\nsort of thing posited by commentators who argue that Descartes holds\nthat God\u2019s creation consists not only of actuals but of\nunactualized possibles. Thus, for any possibility of which we have a\nconception, if there is no object to which that conception conforms\n\u2013 that is, if the possibility exists only in thought\n\u2013 the possibility is not clearly and distinctly perceived.\nPossibilities which exist only in thought are not part of\nDescartes\u2019 ontology and so on Descartes\u2019 view are not\npossibilities at all. Descartes\u2019 remarks to Mersenne actually\nbear this out. He is indeed considering the view of possibility as\nconceivability, but in doing so he is merely acknowledging what\n\u201ceveryone commonly means\u201d by \u2018possible\u2019.\nDescartes sometimes speaks of the possible as clearly and distinctly\nperceived. It is on these passages that any interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019 views on possibility must be built.\n5. Real Distinction\n\nAny interpretation of Descartes\u2019 views on modality needs to be\nsensitive to his view that mind and body are really distinct. The\nconclusion of his Sixth Meditation argument for substance dualism is\nthat \u201cI am really distinct from my body, and can exist without\nit\u201d (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). A natural reading of Descartes\u2019\nconclusion has him saying that, for any minds and bodies that are\nunited, it is counterfactually possible that they be\n separated.[31]\n His argument would be as follows:\n\nI clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body\napart from mind.\nGod can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly\nperceive.\nGod can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart\nfrom mind.\nIf God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is\napart from mind, then mind and body can exist apart.\nMind and body can exist apart.\n\n\nSuch a reading is sensitive not only to Descartes\u2019 Sixth\nMeditation comments but also to his further remarks on real\ndistinction in Fourth Replies. There Descartes says that for\n\u201cestablishing a real distinction it is sufficient that two\nthings can be understood as \u2018complete\u2019 and that each one\ncan be understood apart from the other\u201d (AT 7:221, CSM 2:156). A\nthing is complete, for Descartes, when it is a substance:\n\n\u2026 [B]y a \u2018complete thing\u2019 I simply mean a substance\nendowed with the forms or attributes which enable me to recognize that\nit is a substance. (AT 7:222, CSM 2:156)\n\n\nSince a Cartesian substance is a thing that is ontologically\nindependent (Principles I.51\u201352), a complete thing is\nan ontologically independent thing. When we clearly and distinctly\nperceive mind and body to be complete, we know that they are\nsubstances. When we still clearly and distinctly perceive them to be\nsubstances after clearly and distinctly perceiving them apart from\neach other, we know that they are not the same substance under\ndifferent descriptions. On this view, Descartes holds that mind and\nbody are ontologically independent substances, and their distinctness\nconsists in their ability to continue to exist even after God\nseparates them (Wilson 1978, 196\u201398).\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Descartes on the real distinction\nbetween mind and body reads the distinction as consisting in the fact\nthat they are non-identical substances, but not in the fact of their\nseparability (Rozemond 1998, 28\u201337). Descartes holds that a\nsufficient condition for establishing a real distinction between two\nthings is clearly and distinctly perceiving them to be non-identical\nsubstances (\u201cSynopsis of these following six Meditations,\u201d\nAT 7:13, CSM 2:9; Fourth Replies, AT 7:221\u2013223, CSM\n2:156\u201358). If so, he holds that the substantiality of two\nnon-identical substances does not consist in their being separable,\neven though in fact they are separable (Rozemond 1998, 3\u20138). On\nthis view, mind and body are separable for Descartes; it\u2019s just\nthat their separability is a consequence of the (different) fact that\nthey are really distinct (Rozemond 1998, 28\u201337).\n\nA third reading of the Cartesian real distinction stresses the\ndifficulty in making room for unactualized possibilities in\nDescartes\u2019 system. The reading also highlights that Descartes\nholds that our clear and distinct perceptions are veridical but says\n(in his proof of real distinction) that God can bring about\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive. Descartes is clear in\nother texts that the reason why he mentions God\u2019s power in the\nproof of real distinction is to remind us that no matter how unlikely\nwe think it is that our intimately united minds and bodies could also\nbe really distinct, God has enough power to have made all of\nour clear and distinct perceptions veridical:\n\nYou agree that thought is an attribute of a substance which contains\nno extension, and conversely that extension is an attribute of a\nsubstance that contains no thought. So you must also agree that a\nthinking substance is distinct from an extended substance. For the\nonly criterion we have enabling us to know that one substance differs\nfrom another is that we understand one apart from the other. And God\ncan surely bring about whatever we can clearly understand; the only\nthings that are said to be impossible for God to do are those which\ninvolve a conceptual contradiction, that is, which are not\nintelligible. But we can clearly understand a thinking substance that\nis not extended, and an extended substance that does not think, as you\n agree.[32]\n\n\nIn Fourth Replies Descartes say that his reason for\nmentioning God\u2019s power in the Sixth Meditation proof of real\ndistinction is to remind his reader that our clear and distinct\nperceptions are veridical (AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). In the Sixth\nMeditation itself he arrives at a clear and distinct perception of\nmind as an immaterial substance and body as a material non-thinking\nsubstance and is immediately struck by the union of his mind and body:\n\u201cIt is true that I may have\u2026 a body that is very closely\njoined to me\u201d (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). He says that\n\u201cnevertheless\u201d his mind and body are really distinct.\nDescartes appreciates that the facts of mind-body union and mind-body\nseparation are\n opposed.[33]\n In the context of demonstrating the real distinction between mind and\nbody he reminds us that God\u2019s power is such that there can be\ncreatures that have nothing in common but that are intimately\n united.[34]\n\nIf we take seriously the consideration that there is no room in\nDescartes\u2019 ontology for unactualized possibilities, the real\ndistinction between mind and body does not amount to their\ncounterfactual\n separation.[35]\n God has willed the series of creatures from eternity, and the claim\nthat mind and body can exist apart might amount to the claim that when\na given mind and body are separated in the series, each is\nontologically independent and so continues to\n exist.[36]\n That is, instead of reflecting that there is anything more in\nDescartes\u2019 ontology than what is contained in the series that\nGod wills and preordains, the claim that mind and body can exist apart\nmight amount to Descartes\u2019 note in \u201cSynopsis of these\nfollowing six Meditations\u201d that in the Sixth Meditation he is\nattempting to re-assure us that \u201cthe decay of the body does not\nimply the destruction of them mind\u201d (AT 7:13, CSM 1:10). Or as\nhe puts it elsewhere, he is attempting to \u201cprove the\nexistence\u2026 of our souls when they are separate from\nthe body\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 25 November 1630,\u201d AT\n1:182, CSMK 29, emphasis added). If so, the claim that mind and body\ncan exist apart does not posit the existence of possible reality any\nmore than the Principles III.47 claim that it is possible\n(over time) for bodies to exhibit all the configurations of which they\nare capable (AT 8A:103, CSM 1:258).\n\nIf Descartes holds that potential being is strictly speaking nothing,\nand if his ontology and his commitment to divine immutability, divine\npreordination, and (his particular conception of) omnipotence bar\npossibilities from his system, it is not exactly clear what to make of\nthe possibility of mind and body existing in separation. One view is\nthat Descartes is committed to the reality of this possibility and\nthat, with his commitment to other possibilities, this commitment is\npart of a pattern of Descartes\u2019 helping himself to entities that\nhis system does not allow. That is, it might be the case that\nDescartes wants his system to be rich enough to posit possibilities\nand that, when it isn\u2019t, he posits them anyway. Or, it might be\nthe case that because the Meditations does not attempt to\nanalyze (and then refine) the meditator\u2019s\npre-Meditations view of modality, the \u2018can\u2019 in\nDescartes\u2019 claim that mind and body can exist apart is the not\nfully analyzed \u2018can\u2019 of the\n vernacular.[37]\n6. Possibility and Human Freedom\n\nThe whole project of the Fourth Meditation would appear to suggest\nthat Descartes is committed to the view that human beings can do\nsomething other than what God preordains. The Fourth Meditation tells\nus that error is avoidable, that we err not as as a result of the way\nthat we are constructed but as a result of our mis-use of one of the\nfaculties that God has provided us, and that to avoid error we must\nrefrain from affirming what we do not perceive clearly and\ndistinctly.\n\nBut there are passages in Descartes\u2019 corpus that make a surface\nreading of the Fourth Meditation problematic. One is of course the\nPrinciples I.40\u201341 text in which Descartes says that\nGod pre-ordains everything from eternity. He does admit that \u201cwe\ncan easily get ourselves into great difficulties if we attempt to\nreconcile this divine preordination with the freedom of our will, or\nattempt to grasp both these things at once\u201d (AT 8A:20, CSM\n1:206). But this just means that he himself appreciates the\nproblem.\n\nThere are other difficult texts as well:\n\n\u2026[P]hilosophy by itself is able to discover that the slightest\nthought could not enter a person\u2019s mind without God\u2019s\nwilling, and having willed from all eternity, that it should so\nenter.\u2026 When Your Highness speaks of the particular providence\nof God as being the foundation of theology, I do not think that you\nhave in mind some change in God\u2019s decrees occasioned by actions\nthat depend on our free will. No such change is theologically tenable;\nand when we are told to pray to God, that is not so that we should\ninform him of our needs, or that we should try to get him to change\nanything in the order established from all eternity by his\nprovidence\u2026[,] but simply to obtain whatever he has from all\neternity, willed to be obtained by our prayers. (\u201cTo Princess\nElisabeth, 6 October 1645,\u201d AT 4:314\u20136, CSMK 272\u201373)\n\n\nThe greater we deem the works of God to be, the better we observe the\ninfinity of his power; and the better known this infinity is to us,\nthe more certain we are that it extends even to the most particular\nactions of human beings. (\u201cTo Princess Elizabeth, 6 October\n1645,\u201d AT 4:315, CSMK 273)\n\n\nAs for free will, I agree that if we think only of ourselves we cannot\nhelp regarding ourselves as independent; but when we think of the\ninfinite power of God, we cannot help believing that all things depend\non him, and hence that our free will is not exempt from this\ndependence. \u2026 The independence which we experience and feel in\nourselves, and which suffices to make our actions praiseworthy or\nblameworthy, is not incompatible with a dependence of quite another\nkind, whereby all things are subject to God. (\u201cTo Princess\nElisabeth, 3 November 1645,\u201d AT 4:332\u20133, CSMK 277)\n\n\nHenceforth, because he [the man who meditates upon God] knows that\nnothing can befall him which God has not decreed, he no longer fears\ndeath, pain or disgrace. He so loves this divine decree, deems it so\njust and so necessary, and knows that he must be so completely subject\nto it that even when he expects it to bring death or some other evil,\nhe would not will to change it even if, per impossible, he\ncould do so. (\u201cTo Chanut, 1 February 1647,\u201d AT 4:609, CSMK\n310)\n\n\nIn the Principles I.40\u201341 discussion, Descartes appeals\nto divine incomprehensibility to make sense of how human freedom and\ndivine preordination are to be reconciled. God is infinitely powerful,\nand He somehow made a universe in which it is true both that human\nbeings are free and that God has preordained everything from eternity\n(AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). Perhaps we should just assume that Descartes\nthinks that human freedom is inconsistent with divine pre-ordination\nand that we cannot make sense of human freedom (except by appeal to\ndivine incomprehensibility).\n\nAnother interpretive option is to emphasize that in\nPrinciples 1.40\u201341 Descartes is saying only that our\nexperience of freedom and independence is in tension with divine\npre-ordination (Cunning 2010, 138\u201342). There is a way in which\nour experience of freedom is perfectly consistent with divine\npre-ordination, of course, if God has immutably decreed all of our\nmental life for all eternity and if our mental life includes some\nexperiences and not others. But it might seem puzzling why we have an\nexperience of freedom at all. Still, if Descartes allows that human\nfreedom itself is consistent with divine pre-ordination, then he is\nnot a libertarian but a compatibilist.\n\nPassages outside of the Meditations might be easily read as\nconsistent with the view that for Descartes there does not exist any\nunactualized possible reality, but the view appears not to square with\nmany of the claims of the Fourth Meditation. The Meditation does\ncontain compatibilist-sounding claims \u2013 for example, that the\nwill is maximally free when it is compelled to affirm truth (AT 7:58,\nCSM 2:40); that it would be impossible for us to be in a state of\nindifference if we had distinct perceptions only (ibid.); and\nthat assent and dissent are a matter of the will being pulled and\ncompelled by reasons (AT 7:59; CSM 2:41). However, the whole point of\nthe Fourth Meditation would seem to be that God is imperfect if our\nerrors (and false affirmations) are inevitable, and thus that on any\ngiven occasion it is always possible for us to affirm or deny. In a\nrecent book, C.P. Ragland reasons along these lines \u2013 he argues\nthat the Fourth Meditation supposes a view of freedom according to\nwhich a finite mind has a two-way libertarian power to affirm or not\naffirm in cases where its perception is not clear and distinct.\nOtherwise, it is not clear what the sense is in which finite minds\nwould have the power to avoid error, or what the sense is in which\nerror would be on us and not on God (Ragland 2016,77\u201381, 234).\nRagland points to a number of other passages in defense of his\nlibertarian interpretation. One is Principles I.37, in which\nDescartes says that\n\nit is a supreme perfection in man that he acts voluntarily, that is,\nfreely; this makes him in a special way the author of his actions and\ndeserving of praise for what he does. We do not praise automatons for\naccurately producing all the movements they were designed to perform\n\u2026 when we embrace the truth, our doing so voluntarily is much\nmore to our credit than would be the case if we could not do\notherwise. (CSM 1:205)\n\n\nThis passage as quoted is strongly suggestive of the libertarian\nreading, especially the bit at the end, but there is actually an issue\nof translation that needs to be addressed. A more literal translation\nof the last clause \u2013 \u201c\u2026 quam si non possemus non\namplecti\u201d (AT 8A:18) \u2013 is \u201c\u2026 than if we were\nnot able to not embrace it.\u201d This latter language is in fact\nsimilar to the language in the Fourth Meditation, where Descartes\nsounds quite compatibilist. He says in the Fourth Meditation that\n\u201cthe will consists simply in our ability to do or not do\nsomething\u201d (CSM 2:40), but he also says in the same breath that\nour will is free in cases where it is irresistibly compelled to affirm\na clearly and distinctly perceived truth. The will does not possess a\ntwo-way power in such instances, but it still consists in an ability\nto do or not do. That is to say, the will has in its arsenal a\ncapacity to affirm and a capacity to deny, but not a two-way\ncontra-causal power. Ragland would presumably respond to the\ntranslational concerns about Principles I.37 by saying that\nthere is a larger and more pressing philosophical concern: that\nDescartes holds that volitions are praiseworthy, but volitions cannot\nbe said to be praiseworthy if they could not be otherwise (Ragland,\n61\u201362, 77\u201378). However, we might present the same concern\nback to the libertarian: if a volition is a modification of a mental\nsubstance, and it materializes in that substance without a prior\nmodification as its cause, volitions would seem to pop into existence\nfrom nowhere, and the will instead would be a loose cannon. Perhaps\nRagland might respond here by introducing the notion of agent\ncausation and saying that, for Descartes, a mental substance itself is\nable to generate a volition, and not as a result of the activity of\nany of its modes. However, there are tremendous difficulties in trying\nto make sense of how agent causation would work in a substance-mode\nontology. If we imagined a substance with no modes whatsoever \u2013\nin line with the thought experiment that Spinoza presents in Short\nTreatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being (84) \u2013 it is\ndifficult to make any sense at all of the process by which a volition\nwould form in that substance. If the substance has no modes, but then\nit all of a sudden had a volition, there would be no reason why it\nformed that particular volition rather than some other, and there\nwould be no reason why it formed the volition at that particular\nmoment and not at a different moment. If we do start positing reasons,\nin terms of some specific underlying mental activity that was brewing\nbeforehand and was a precursor to the volition, we could then think\nabout the case of two qualitatively identical substances that both\nhave that same underlying activity and a lot more activity besides. If\nboth substances are identical and have all of the same modes, we could\nask if a volition could occur in one that did not occur in the other.\nBut the same set of concerns would seem to arise. There would be no\nreason for the volition to appear, in which case it would again be\nrandom, and the notion of accountability for volitions would make\nlittle sense.\n\nA compatibilist reading of the Fourth Meditation resolution of the\nproblem of error would have to emphasize the following: that the\nMeditation provides reasons that push and compel the will to refrain\nfrom affirming perceptions that are not clear and distinct; that the\nMeditation speaks of the will as being pushed and pulled by reasons\nthat are presented to it (CSM 2:40\u201341); and that Descartes\ninsists that upon further reflection \u2013 reflection which occurs\npast the Meditations \u2013 it is clear that the entirety of\nour mental lives depends on God\u2019s eternal and immutable will and\nthat, as a result, nothing that happens (including pain and death, and\npresumably error) is bad; and that something (like error) can be the\noutcome of God\u2019s will if we just understand it in its full\ncontext. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes offers a similar theodicy\nto explain the occurrence of misleading sensations \u2013 for\nexample, the feeling of a pain in a part of the body that has been\namputated. Descartes argues there that if we are going to have a body,\nthings like that will sometimes happen; they are just part of the\nterritory for a mind that is embodied, and for reasons that are not\nentirely clear to us, it is better to be embodied than not (CSM\n2:57\u201361). The Fourth Meditation theodicy might be exactly\nparallel. If we had just a will or just an intellect, we would never\nerr, but there are advantages to having both. When the two are brought\ntogether, however, the intellect sometimes pushes and pulls the will\nto affirm or deny. A finite intellect has limited information, and\nsome of the affirmations that it compels the will to make will not\nconform exactly to reality, but it is better that we have both than\nthat we have just one. Furthermore, we can trust that \u201cinsofar\nas these acts depend on God, they are wholly true and good\u201d (CSM\n2:42), and so perhaps there is a perspective from which even our\nerroneous affirmation are getting at truth, in an incomplete manner,\nor just confusedly.\n\nA final problem for the view that Descartes subscribes to a\nlibertarian conception of freedom is that in the end it is required to\nappeal to a doctrine of divine incomprehensibility to explain how\ndivine providence and foreknowledge are consistent with libertarian\nfreedom. Ragland does this (Ragland 2016, 230\u2013235), as does Wee\n(in Wee 2014, 199\u2013200). We do not need to force Descartes to\nappeal to divine incomprehensibility if we interpret him as a\ncompatibilist, and as we have seen we could save him from additional\ntrouble as well. It is one thing for a philosopher to appeal to divine\nincomprehensibility in a case in which there are two truths that are\nin tension, or a case in which a truth is mysterious in the face of\nother truths, but it is an entirely different thing for a philosopher\nto appeal to divine incomprehensibility after positing a logical\ncontradiction. Descartes does not do that anywhere, and for good\nreason. He does appeal to divine incomprehensibility in the course of\ntrying to understand why we would have an experience of\nindependence if God has preordained everything from eternity, and that\nexperience is mysterious indeed, but Descartes does not say anywhere\nthat freedom itself is inconsistent with divine preordination. As we\nhave seen, however, in one passage he speaks of the\n\nindependence which we experience in ourselves, and which suffices to\nmake our actions praiseworthy or blameworthy, [and which] is not\nincompatible with a dependence of quite another kind, whereby all\nthings are subject to God. (CSMK 277; also Ragland, 212)\n\n\nA final issue to consider in the context of discussing\nDescartes\u2019 view on human freedom is the issue of the extent to\nwhich finite minds are compelled or drawn to affirm clear and distinct\nperceptions. There are a number of texts in which Descartes reflects\nthat view that finite minds are wholly unable to refrain from\naffirming a clear and distinct\n perception.[38]\n Indeed, we might think that the only way that we would be able to\nknow that God\u2019s non-deceiverhood secures the truth of clear and\ndistinct perceptions is if those perceptions are utterly compelled.\nThere are passages, however, in which Descartes appears to reflect the\nview that it is within the power of the will to refrain from affirming\na clear and distinct perception. One is Principles I.37, in\nwhich Descartes says that \u201cwhen we embrace the truth, our doing\nso voluntarily is much more to our credit than would be the case if we\ncould not do otherwise\u201d (AT 8A:19, CSM 1:205). But this passage\nis especially odd given that only a few lines later in\nPrinciples I.43 Descartes offers one of his statements of the\nview that we are unable to doubt clear and distinct perceptions (in\nwhich we are embracing the\n truth\u2026).[39]\n\nAnother passage in which Descartes appears to reflect the view that it\nis within the power of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear\nand distinct perception is in \u201cTo [Mesland], 9 February\n1645.\u201d There Descartes writes that\n\nabsolutely speaking\u2026 it is always open to us to hold back from\npursuing a clearly known good, or from admitting a clearly perceived\ntruth, provided we consider it a good thing to demonstrate the freedom\nof our will by so doing. (AT 4:173, CSMK 245)\n\n\nAn examination of the larger context of this passage in the shows that\nit is not in fact evidence that Descartes holds that it is within the\npower of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear and distinct\nperception. In the previous letter to Mesland Descartes had said\nthat\n\nI agree with you when you say that we can suspend our judgment; but I\ntried to explain in what manner this can be done. For it seems to me\ncertain that a great light in the intellect is followed by a great\ninclination in the will; so that if we see very clearly that a thing\nis good for us, it is very difficult \u2013 and on my view\nimpossible, as long as one continues in the same thought \u2013 to\nstop the course of our desire. \u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d\nAT 4:115\u20136, CSMK 233)\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 view that clear and distinct perceptions are\nwill-compelling is the view that so long as the intellect has a clear\nand distinct idea, it is impossible for the will to refrain from\naffirming it. What it is for a finite mind to clearly and distinctly\nperceive X is for its intellect to have a clear and distinct\nidea of X and for its will to affirm X, but while the\nintellect is presenting this clear and distinct idea, the will cannot\nstop affirming it to turn its attention to something else. Instead,\nanother idea must be put in place of the clear and distinct idea, and\nby something other than the\n will.[40]\n As Descartes says by way of qualification in the February 1645\nletter, we suspend judgment when something else distracts the will\nfrom a clear and distinct idea (AT 4:173, CSMK 245) \u2013 for\nexample the desire to exhibit our freedom (Nelson 1997,\n163\u201364).\n\nIt is tempting to assume that Descartes accepts the Spinozistic view\nthat the will is at the mercy of the clarity with which the intellect\nhas ideas. (Of course, in Spinoza\u2019s language the view is that\nthere is no distinction between will and intellect and that to the\nextent that we understand something our will is drawn to affirm it.)\nDescartes appears to accept this view in the case of clear and\ndistinct ideas at least, and it would make sense for him to think that\nthe compellingness of truth and goodness does not disappear when our\ngrasp of it is slightly weakened. But such a reading is speculative at\nbest.\n\nA final passage to consider is in The Passions of the Soul\nI.41. There Descartes says that \u201cthe will is by its nature so\nfree that it can never be constrained\u201d (AT 11:359, CSM 1:343).\nThis passage might appear to reflect a libertarian view of freedom,\nbut there is a multitude of passages in which Descartes says that the\neternal and immutable divine decree reaches down to \u201cthe most\nparticular actions of human beings\u201d (AT 4:315, CSMK 273) and to\n\u201canything\u2026 we could ever do\u201d (Principles\nI.40, AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). On a natural reading of the\nPassions I.41 passage, Descartes is highlighting that a will\nby its nature is free and unconstrained, but that it is not free and\nunconstrained when its nature is adulterated \u2013 for example when\nit is attached to a body. In the same vein we might say that a diamond\nis by its nature beautiful, but that it is not beautiful when it is\nencrusted in dirt (Cunning 2023, 229\u2013230, 250\u2013257). As per\nthe Fourth Meditation, a will is free not when it is indifferent but\nwhen it affirms utterly compelling clear and distinct perceptions, and\na mind that is unencumbered by a body has clear and distinct\nperceptions only (Fifth Replies, AT 7:375, CSM 2:258;\nSecond Replies, AT 7:130\u2013131, CSM 2:94).\n7. The System and its Pillars\n\nIt is presumably an adequacy condition on the interpretation of the\nwork of any systematic philosopher that the work be interpreted in\nlight of the central tenets of that philosopher\u2019s system. The\ninterpretive problem of course is that for almost any such philosopher\nthere are controversies about what these central tenets are. It is\nuncontroversial that Descartes sometimes speaks of possibility and\nnecessity. What is not so uncontroversial is what he is talking about\nwhen he talks about these. In particular, if Descartes is committed to\nthe view that there is unactualized possible being, then either (1)\nthe alleged parts of his system that seem to disallow such being are\nnot parts of his system, (2) the parts of his system that seem to\ndisallow such being do not really disallow it, or (3) he is not a\nwholly systematic philosopher. There is no chance that (3) is right,\nbut much work remains to be done in debates over (1) and (2).\n",
