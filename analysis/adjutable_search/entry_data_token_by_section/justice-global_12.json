In general, poverty makes the lives of women and girls\nharder than their male counterparts, as cultural expectations often\ndictate that women and girls do more care and domestic work or go\nwithout (or much less) when resources are scarce. This can\nsignificantly thwart women and girls\u2019 well-being, as education,\nhealth care, and food are routinely withheld in favor of distribution\nto men and boys.\n\nCultural perceptions of gender roles can often lead to practices\nhighly damaging to the most fundamental interests of women and girls.\nThese include \u201chonor killings\u201d (where it is believed\nculturally permissible to kill a girl or woman who is perceived to\nhave brought shame to the family), genital mutilation, infanticide,\nforced prostitution, arranged marriage, and legal recognition of\nproperty and inheritance rights that significantly disadvantage women\nand girls. Poverty can exacerbate such vulnerabilities so we have\nfurther reasons to address it as a matter of urgency (Jaggar 2009,\n2013, 2014). Martha Nussbaum has argued for a list of ten capabilities\nthat all human persons, no matter what their gender, ought to be\npositioned to exercise. She argues that this approach offers a\npowerful tool for persuasion in cases where girls and women are denied\nthese opportunities by local actors in different cultures.\n\nAlison Jaggar prominently argues that various structures create and\nrecreate transnational gendered vulnerabilities and she illustrates\nwith practices common in domestic work and the sex industry (Jaggar\n2009, 2014). Anca Gheaus has argued that patterns of international\nimmigration \u2013 where women typically provide an international\nmarket for care work \u2013 constitute a kind of care drain. This\nwork is not fully voluntary occurring against a background of unjust\noptions, and amounts to a major issue for women and their families as\nwell as countries and global justice more broadly (Gheaus 2013;\nEckenwiler 2009). Others focus on how universal values can inform\nfeminist approaches and discuss how concrete issues like globalization\naffect women (Khader 2014, 2018; Parekh and Wilcox 2018). (For more\nsee also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization).\n\nSome important policies have influenced international discourse in\ncombating gender injustice. The Millennium Development Goals (MGDs)\nincludes as a third goal the promotion of gender equality and the\nempowerment of women (for discussion of the MGDs, see: Pogge and\nSengupta 2020). The 1995 Beijing Platform for Action set the stage for\nseveral International Covenants and before that the United Nations\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen afforded some important protection for women\u2019s human\nrights. Some theorists are suspicious of human rights language and are\ninclined to reject what they perceive as a masculine or neocolonial\ndiscourse that trumpets individual autonomy in a way that fails to\nacknowledge, adequately, our fundamental human interdependence and\nhistory of oppression (Jaggar 2020). While there certainly is a place\nfor discussion of these important themes, others argue that we should\nnot lose sight of the important victories human rights have also been\nable to secure, despite still having a long way to go (United Nations\nn.d.). The rhetoric of human rights has enabled substantial gains for\npromoting gender equality and protection of women\u2019s fundamental\ninterests, so it has at least strategic value.\n\nFor a good survey of recent work on global gender justice, see Jaggar\n2020. For more on solutions to often discussed problems, such as\nadaptive preferences, see Khader 2011, 2018. For more see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on globalization\n and\n feminist perspectives on power.\n",
