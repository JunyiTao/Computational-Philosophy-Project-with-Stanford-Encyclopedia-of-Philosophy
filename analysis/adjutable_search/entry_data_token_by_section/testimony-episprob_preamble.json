    "main_text": "\n\nSo much of what we know about the world, e.g., history, science,\npolitics, one another, etc., comes from the testimony of others. But\nwhile testimony is clearly an indispensable source of knowledge,\nspecifying exactly how it is that we are able to learn from a\nspeaker\u2019s say-so has proven to be a difficult task.\n\nTo this end, a lot (but certainly not all) of the interest in the\nepistemology of testimony has centered on the following questions:\n\nIs testimony a basic source of justification, or can testimonial\njustification be reduced to a combination of other epistemic sources,\ne.g., perception, memory, and inference?\nCan testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit\nit?\nWhen one acquires testimonial justification, is one\u2019s belief\njustified by evidence, or by something else, e.g., non-evidential\nassurances?\nShould testimonial justification be understood individualistically\n(in the sense that one\u2019s testimonial justification depends\nentirely on factors having to do with one\u2019s self), or should it\nbe understood anti-individualistically (in the sense that one\u2019s\ntestimonial justification depends at least in part on factors having\nto do with the speaker)?\nHow should we understand the difference between expert and novice\ntestimony?\nDo groups testify? And if so, how can we learn from a\ngroup\u2019s say-so?\nWhat is testimony itself?\n\n\nThe aim of this article is to provide an overview of the major debates\nsurrounding these issues.\n\nBefore moving on, it is important to note that these are certainly not\nthe only important questions about testimony. For instance, there is a\ngrowing literature about how failing to give a testifier the credit\nthey deserve gives rise to a form of epistemic injustice\n(e.g., M. Fricker\n 2007).[1]\n Moreover, there are many interesting questions about eyewitness\ntestimony and the law (e.g., Wells & Olson 2003 and Burroughs\n& Tollefsen 2016), as well as important questions about the\nrelationship between testimony and assertion (e.g., Pagin 2007\n[2016]). And there are also growing literatures about moral\n testimony[2]\n and aesthetic\n testimony,[3]\n e.g., while it is uncontroversial that you can acquire justification\nfor believing that the taco truck is open by relying on your\nfriend\u2019s say-so, it is far less clear that you can acquire\njustification for believing that eating carne asada is morally wrong\nor that the mural on the taco truck is beautiful, solely on the basis\nof what your friend tells you. For reasons only having to do with\nspace, though, this article will focus exclusively on the seven\nquestions above.\n",
