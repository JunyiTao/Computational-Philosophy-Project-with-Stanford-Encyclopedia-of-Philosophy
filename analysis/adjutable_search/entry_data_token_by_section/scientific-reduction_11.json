Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind\n\nReductionist positions have gained attention within the philosophy of\nmind in four main respects. Firstly, type-identity theory was proposed\nas a reductionist position about the mind. Secondly, token-identity\ntheories are sometimes conceived of as being reductionist in spirit as\nwell. Thirdly, models of functional reduction have been intensively\ndiscussed. And, finally and corresponding to the previous\ndistinctions, there are different conceptions of reduction that are\ndiscussed and rejected by non-reductive physicalism.\n",
