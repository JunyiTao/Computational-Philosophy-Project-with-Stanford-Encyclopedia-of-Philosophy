    "main_text": "The structure of loyalty || Is loyalty inherently exclusionary?\n3.2 Is loyalty inherently exclusionary?\n\nIt has sometimes been suggested that \u201cA can be loyal to\nB only if there is a third party C \u2026 who\nstands as a potential competitor to B\u201d (Fletcher, 1993,\n8). It is true that many, if not most, expressions of loyalty occur\nagainst the background of some challenge to B\u2019s\ninterests whose protection by A will be at some cost to\nA. Failures of loyalty often result in betrayal (of\nB, sometimes to C). Thus, defending\none\u2019s spouse in the face of criticism may also subject oneself\nto vilification (by C); refusing to leave one\u2019s\nuniversity for another (C) may involve a sacrifice of pay and\nother opportunities; and patriotic loyalty may involve volunteering\nfor military service when one\u2019s country is attacked (by\nC). Sometimes, however, the loyal friend will simply manifest\nthe loyalty by being responsive to B\u2019s need at some\ninconvenience. The loyal A will get up at 2.00am to fetch\nB when B\u2019s car has broken down or will agree\nto be best man at B\u2019s wedding even though it will\ninvolve a long flight and great expense. No third party is involved,\nbut there will be a cost to A. The incentive to disloyalty is\nmore likely to be found in the blandishments of self-interest or\nself-maximization than in external temptations to side with a\ncompetitor\u2019s interests (Kleinig, forthcoming).\n\nSome defenders as well as critics of loyalty take the frequent\npresence of C as a reason for seeing loyalty as inherently\nunfriendly. To put it in the words of the political consultant, James\nCarville, \u201csticking with\u201d B requires\n\u201csticking it to\u201d C (Carville, 2000). No doubt\nsome loyalties\u2014especially political ones\u2014frequently\nexpress themselves in such terms. But jingoism is not necessary to\npatriotic loyalty (pace Tolstoy, 1894), and in most contexts\nthe privileging of an object of loyalty (B) does not require\ntreating others (C) badly. Loyalty to one\u2019s own\nchildren need not involve the disparagement of others\u2019\nchildren.\n",
