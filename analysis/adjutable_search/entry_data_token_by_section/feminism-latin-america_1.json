    "main_text": "History: A Genealogy of Latin American Feminism || Latin American Feminist Ideas of the Early 20th Century\n1.2 Latin American Feminist Ideas of the Early 20th Century\n\nFeminist ideas from the early 20th century are\ntransnational. Ideas move with pushes for social change. Hence, a key\nissue for contemporary Latin American feminist writers is the\nimportance of tracking the movement of ideas and reminding us that\nideas migrate and reconfigure depending on their contexts. The\nintersection between women\u2019s ideas about resistance and the\nideas that could lead to social transformation was not necessarily\nunderstood as feminist in its time. More often than not, women\u2019s\nideas in regards to justice, equality, and political change converged\nwith other political projects that focused on improving the poor\nworking class\u2019s conditions and not specifically women\u2019s\nconditions. Their ideas for social change were molded into general\nclaims about access to education and transformation of laboring\nmaterial conditions. Ideas that are now coded as feminist are\nidentified as such in retrospect, but in order to do them justice,\nthey need to be accounted for in their historicity.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920) had a profound impact on the\ndevelopment of feminist ideas (Gargallo 2004: 82). Most notably, the\nrevolution focused on education, and in this political landscape,\nfeminist ideas had the historical impact of influencing the thoughts\nand actions of women in Mexican society (Gargallo 2004: 82). In 1915,\nSalvador Alvarado became governor of the Yucat\u00e1n and functioned\nas a vehicle for social and political change until 1918 when he was\ncalled to return to military duty. He supported a feminist movement in\nthe region initiated by Rita Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez in 1870, noted\nearlier as one of Mexico\u2019s earliest feminists and founder of La\nSiempreviva. Moreover, his tenure in office gave room and support for\nwomen\u2019s political activism in the region. The first two feminist\ncongresses in the history of Mexico were held in M\u00e9rida in\nJanuary and November of 1916, giving floor to discussions on the right\nto vote and political participation, abortion and contraception, as\nwell as education (Gargallo 2004: 83). By 1923, the socialist party of\nthe Yucat\u00e1n had three women deputies and one alternate\n(Gargallo 2004: 84).\n\nGiven the impact of the Mexican Revolution, it is no surprise that\nsome of the first feminist ideas to reach historical identification\nare found in its wake. Nevertheless, feminist ideas stretched beyond\nMexico and across Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1880, women\nabolitionists in Brazil published a newspaper titled A\nfamilia and argued for changes in dress norms. In 1910, Argentina\nwitnessed the first Feminist International Congress which fought for\npeace, education, and social participation (Gargallo 2004: 85). In\n1912, women in Colombia declared the defense of civil rights of\nmarried women. In 1916, women in Panam\u00e1 founded Club Ariel and\nCentro de Cultural Feminina, which supported intellectual and physical\neducation as well as the political life of women, and whose motto\ncentered on virtue and nationhood. In 1924, Visitaci\u00f3n Padilla\ndenounced the presence of U.S. marine military infantry in Honduras\nand Central America in the Bolet\u00edn de la Defensa\nNacional. She founded the C\u00edrculo de Cultura Femenina\nwhich supported the education of women and resisted North American\nmilitary intervention during the Second Honduran Civil War (1924). In\n1928, women of Ecuador sued the state, demanding the right to vote,\nand received it one year later (Gargallo 2004: 86).\n\nLuisa Capetillo (1879\u20131922) exemplifies the convergence of\nfeminist ideas and ideas concerning broader social transformation.\nBorn in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, Capetillo was home schooled and secured\na job as a reader in cigar-making factories, reading to workers and\ntransferring ideas to workers as they rolled cigars. Capetillo\u2019s\nemployment as a reader served as an important locale from which\nworkers developed a consciousness of trade unions, socialism,\nanarchism, and women\u2019s rights (Ruiz 2016: 6). Although readers\nwere typically men, it was not uncommon to find women in cigar\nfactories as the cigar-making industry modernized and became the\nsecond national industry in the first decades of the 20th\ncentury (Ramos 1992: 29). Hence, it is not accidental that some of the\nfirst feminist ideas of Puerto Rico emerged in cigar factories and in\nthe proletariat presses significantly before the suffrage movement\nlater in the century (Ramos 1992: 30). Capetillo\u2019s feminist\nideas are grounded in her class politics that saw emancipation\noccurring at the nexus between labor empowerment and gender equality\n(Ruiz 2016: 13). Although often heralded as the first feminist writer\nof Puerto Rico and the first woman to ever publish a book about women\nin Puerto Rico, Capetillo\u2019s work most importantly shows how\nearly 20th century Latin American feminist ideas and\nwriters were very much grounded in the lived material conditions of\ntheir times. In the case of Capetillo, her feminist anarchism brewed\nat the core of her understanding of workers\u2019 emancipation as a\nwoman who herself labored in the trenches of modernity.\n\nEarly 20th century Latin American feminist history\nconcludes with women\u2019s suffrage. The years spanning\n1870\u20131947 are generally considered the pivotal years for\nwomen\u2019s suffrage (Gargallo 2004: 94). However, to view this\nslice of history as merely centered on suffrage misrepresents the\nmultiplicity of feminist ideas and activities developed during the\ntime. These years also witnessed the push for social transformation\noriented around ideas of equality and justice that included, but was\nnot limited to, the right to vote. The push for equality framed\nwomen\u2019s insistence on public access to education, which impacted\nnot just women but the impoverished as well. The call for a more just\nsocial order framed how women were thinking about their locale in\nresistance to military intervention as well as labor movements. Hence,\nthe ideas that emanate from this period are multidimensional. The era\nis identified as closing out with the accomplishment of suffrage.\nHowever, the right to vote emerged at different times throughout the\nregion, owing to the diversity of local politics. For instance,\nEcuador was the first country in South America to enfranchise women in\n1929. That same year, Puerto Rico enfranchised literate women and in\n1935, gave the vote to all women. Uruguay followed shortly after in\n1932, Cuba in 1933, and El Salvador in 1939. However, the suffrage\nmovement stagnated in other countries: women were enfranchised in\nNicaragua and Per\u00fa in 1955, and only in 1961 did Paraguay give\nwomen the vote.\n\nIn the context of suffrage it is important to mention Uruguayan\nphilosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreira (1872-1958) and his treatise Sobre\nfemenismo (Vaz Ferreira 1933). Prior to the 1980's, Vaz Ferreria\nwas one of the only well known Latin American philosopher to discuss\nfeminism as part of the central corpus of his work (Schutte 1993:\n208). Sobre femenismo is a collection of  lectures\nVaz Ferreira delivered from 1914 to 1918, a pivotal time in the\nhistory of women\u2019s suffrage in Uruguay. The first printing of\nthe text in 1933 coincides with Uruguayan enfranchisement coinciding\nwith the climate of feminist social mobilization that began in\nthe early 1900\u2019s among socialists and sympathizers of feminism\namong the supporters of Batllismo (named after the then President Jose\nBatlle y Ordonez (Schutte 2003: 209). The Batllist\nmoment was favorable for intellectuals. They were public and esteemed\nroles with impact on social mores, and Vaz Ferreira was among these\n(Oliver 2007: 33). Sobre feminismo (1933) outlines a\nsocial theory of cooperation between men and women that privileged\nmonogamy, the family, and equitable division of household tasks\n(Oliver 2007: 34). Vaz Ferreira adopts a position he terms\nfeminism of compensation or compensatory feminism, which he\ndistinguishes from feminism of equality. Compensatory feminism held\nthat women are biologically disenfranchised in relation to men, but\nsociety can compensate for the disadvantage by adjusting institutional\nstructures (Schutte 2003: 209). Consequently, he was an takes up\nthe topics of women\u2019s suffrage, education, right to divorce\nas part of his political philosophy. \n",
