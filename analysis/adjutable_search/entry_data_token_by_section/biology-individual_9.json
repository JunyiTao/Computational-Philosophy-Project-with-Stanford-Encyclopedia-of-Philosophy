    "main_text": "From Physiological to Evolutionary Individuals: Life, Reproduction, and Agency || Physiological Individuals as Living Agents\n6.1 Physiological Individuals as Living Agents\n\nOne approach here would be to attempt to define life, or living agent,\nor to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these (Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 17\u201318; Cleland 2012). A\nrecurrent property in such definitions is that of having a\nmetabolism, which involves both an anabolic dimension in\nthe breakdown of chemical molecules to produce energy and a\ncatabolic dimension in intracellular synthesis of those\ncompounds (Pradeu 2016b: 801). But there are other properties that\nliving agents have, some presupposed by that of having a metabolism,\nothers existing independently. These include what might be thought of\nas structural properties\u2014such as having heterogeneous\nand specialized parts, including a variety of internal mechanisms, and\ncontaining diverse organic molecules, including nucleic acids and\nproteins\u2014as well as functional or\ndispositional properties\u2014such as the capacity for\ngrowth or development, reproduction, and self-repair.\n\nCells, organs, and perhaps bodily systems, such as the respiratory\nsystem or the digestive system, are physiological individuals that\nhave most if not all of these properties that characterize living\nagents. As physiological individuals, organisms also share these\nproperties, but are distinguished by one or more further\ncharacteristics, such as possessing an immune system (as Pradeu\nemphasizes) or having a life cycle, one that is typically\ndemarcated through reproduction, which is the focus of\n section 6.2\n below.\n\nConceiving of physiological individuals as living agents, and\nsupposing that all organisms are living agents but that there may be\nboth parts and groups of organisms that are not, allows us to extend\nthe visual summary introduced in\n Figure 2.\n Figure 3 depicts organisms as living agents but also contains\nregions for organs such as hearts and other constituent parts of\norganisms as living agents, as well as groups that may be living\nagents but not organisms (e.g., perhaps a coral reef).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Living Things as Biological\nIndividuals.
