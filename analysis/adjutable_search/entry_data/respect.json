    "preamble": "\n\nRespect has great importance in everyday life. As children we are\ntaught (one hopes) to respect our parents and teachers, school rules\nand traffic laws, family and cultural traditions, other people\u2019s\nfeelings and rights, our country\u2019s flag and leaders, the truth\nand people\u2019s differing opinions. And we come to value respect\nfor such things; when we\u2019re older, we may shake our heads (or\nfists) at people who seem not to have learned to respect them. We\ndevelop great respect for people we consider exemplary and lose\nrespect for those we discover to be clay-footed; we may also come to\nbelieve that, at some level, all people are worthy of respect. We may\nlearn that jobs and relationships become unbearable if we receive no\nrespect in them; in certain social milieus we may learn the price of\ndisrespect if we violate the street law: \u201cDiss me, and you\ndie.\u201d Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of\npublic life: environmentalists exhort us to respect nature, foes of\nabortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life,\nmembers of racial and ethnic minorities and those discriminated\nagainst because of their gender, sexual orientation, age, religious\nbeliefs, or economic status demand respect both as social and moral\nequals and for their cultural differences. And it is widely\nacknowledged that public debates about such demands should take place\nunder terms of mutual respect. We may learn both that our lives\ntogether go better when we respect the things that deserve to be\nrespected and that we should respect some things independently of\nconsiderations of how our lives would go.\n\nWe may also learn that how our lives go depends every bit as much on\nwhether we respect ourselves. The value of self-respect may be\nsomething we can take for granted, or we may discover how very\nimportant it is when our self-respect is threatened, or we lose it and\nhave to work to regain it, or we have to struggle to develop or\nmaintain it in a hostile environment. Some people find that finally\nbeing able to respect themselves is what matters most about finally\nstanding on their own two feet, kicking a disgusting habit, or\ndefending something they value; others, sadly, discover that life is\nno longer worth living if self-respect is irretrievably lost. It is\npart of everyday wisdom that respect and self-respect are deeply\nconnected, that it is difficult both to respect others if we\ndon\u2019t respect ourselves and to respect ourselves if others\ndon\u2019t respect us. It is increasingly part of political wisdom\nboth that unjust social institutions can devastatingly damage\nself-respect and that robust and resilient self-respect can be a\npotent force in struggles against injustice.\n\nThe ubiquity and significance of respect and self-respect in everyday\nlife largely explains why philosophers, particularly in moral and\npolitical philosophy, have been interested in these two concepts. They\nturn up in a multiplicity of philosophical contexts, including\ndiscussions of justice and equality, injustice and oppression,\nautonomy and agency, moral and political rights and duties, moral\nmotivation and moral development, cultural diversity and toleration,\npunishment and political violence, and a host of applied ethics\ncontexts. Although a wide variety of things are said to deserve\nrespect, contemporary philosophical interest in respect has\noverwhelmingly been focused on respect for persons, the idea that all\npersons should be treated with respect simply because they are\npersons. This focus owes much to the 18th century German\nphilosopher, Immanuel Kant, who argued that all and only persons and\nthe moral law they autonomously legislate are appropriate objects of\nthe morally most significant attitude of respect. Although honor,\nesteem, and prudential regard played important roles in moral and\npolitical theories before him, Kant was the first major Western\nphilosopher to put respect for persons, including oneself, at the very\ncenter of moral theory, and his insistence that persons are ends in\nthemselves with an absolute dignity who must always be respected has\nbecome a core ideal of modern humanism and political liberalism. In\nrecent years many people have argued that moral respect ought also to\nbe extended to things other than persons, such as nonhuman living\nbeings and the natural environment.\n\nDespite the widespread acknowledgment of the importance of respect and\nself-respect in moral and political life and theory, there is no\nsettled agreement in either everyday thinking or philosophical\ndiscussion about such issues as how to understand the concepts, what\nthe appropriate objects of respect are, what is involved in respecting\nvarious objects, and what the scope is of any moral requirements\nregarding respect and self-respect. This entry will survey these and\nrelated issues.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Concept of Respect\n\nPhilosophers have approached the concept of respect with a variety of\nquestions. (1) One set concerns the nature of respect, including (a)\nWhat sort of thing is respect? Philosophers have variously identified\nit as a mode of behavior, a form of treatment, a kind of valuing, a\ntype of attention, a motive, an attitude, a feeling, a tribute, a\nprinciple, a duty, an entitlement, a moral virtue, an epistemic\nvirtue: are any of these categories more central than others? (b) Are\nthere different kinds of respect? If so, is any more basic than\nothers? (c) Are there different levels or degrees of respect? (d) What\nare the distinctive elements of respect, or a specific kind of\nrespect? What beliefs, attitudes, emotions, and motives does (a\nspecific kind of) respect involve, and what ways of acting and\nforbearing to act express or constitute or are regulated by it? (e) To\nwhat other attitudes, actions, valuings, duties, etc., is respect (or\na specific kind) similar, and with what does it contrast? In\nparticular, how is respect similar to, different from, or connected\nwith esteem, honor, love, awe, reverence, recognition, toleration,\ndignity, contempt, indifference, discounting, denigration, and so\non? (2) A second set of questions concerns objects of respect,\nincluding (a)What sorts of things can be reasonably be said to warrant\nrespect? (b) What are the bases or grounds for respect, i.e., the\nfeatures of or facts about objects in virtue of which it is reasonable\nand perhaps obligatory to respect them? (c) Must every appropriate\nobject always be respected? Can respect be forfeited, can lost respect\nbe regained? (3) A third set of questions focuses on moral dimensions\nof respect, including (a) Are there moral requirements to respect\ncertain types of objects, and, if so, what are the scope and grounds\nof such requirements? (b) Why is respect morally important? What, if\nanything, does it add to morality over and above the conduct,\nattitudes, and character traits required or encouraged by various\nmoral principles or virtues? (c) What does respect entail morally for\nhow we should treat one another in everyday interactions, for issues\nin specific contexts such as health care and the workplace, and for\nfraught issues such as abortion, racial and gender justice, and global\ninequality?\n1.1 Elements of respect\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that there are different forms or kinds of\nrespect. This complicates the answering of these questions, since\nanswers concerning one form or kind of respect can diverge\nsignificantly from those about another. Much philosophical work has\ngone into explicating differences and links among the various\nkinds.\n\nOne general distinction concerns respect simply as behavior and\nrespect as an attitude or feeling that may or may not be expressed in\nor signified by behavior. When we speak of drivers respecting the\nspeed limit, hostile forces respecting a cease fire agreement, or the\nCovid-19 virus not respecting national borders, we can be referring\nsimply to behavior which avoids violation of or interference with some\nboundary, limit, or rule, without any reference to attitudes,\nfeelings, intentions, or dispositions, and even, as in the case of\nviruses, without imputing agency (Bird 2004). In such cases the\nbehavior is regarded as constitutive of respecting. Where respect is\nconceived of as a duty or an entitlement, a certain kind of behavior\nor treatment may be all that is owed. Similarly, respect as a tribute\ncould be just a certain mode of behavior, such as bowing or standing\nin silence. In other cases, however, we take respect to be or to\nexpress or signify an attitude or feeling, as when we speak of having\nrespect for someone or of certain behaviors as showing respect or\ndisrespect. Here, actions and modes of treatment count as respect\ninsofar as they either manifest an attitude of respect or are of the\nsort through which the attitude is characteristically expressed; a\nprinciple of respect is one that necessarily must be adopted by\nsomeone with the attitude of respect or that prescribes the attitude\nor actions that express it (Frankena 1986; Downie and Telfer 1969); a\nmoral virtue of respect involves having the attitude as a settled\naspect of one\u2019s way of being toward appropriate objects. Most\ndiscussions of respect for persons take attitude to be central. In\nwhat follows, I will focus chiefly on respect as attitude. There are,\nagain, several different attitudes to which the term\n\u201crespect\u201d refers. Before looking at differences, however,\nit is useful first to note some elements common among varieties.\n\nAn attitude of respect is, most generally, a relation between a\nsubject and an object in which the subject responds to the object from\na certain perspective in some appropriate way. Respect necessarily has\nan object: respect is always directed toward, paid to, felt about,\nshown for some object. While a very wide variety of things can be\nappropriate objects of one kind of respect or another, the subject of\nrespect (the respecter) is typically a person, that is, a conscious\nrational being capable of recognizing objects, intentionally\nresponding to them, having and expressing values with regard to them,\nand being accountable for disrespecting or failing to respect them.\nRespect and disrespect can also be expressed or instantiated by or\nthrough things that are not persons, such as guidelines, rules, laws,\nand principles, systems, and institutional organizations and\noperations. So, we can say that laws that prohibit torture express\nrespect for persons while the institution of slavery is profoundly\ndisrespectful of human beings.\n\nOrdinary discourse about respect as a responsive relation identifies\nseveral key elements, including attention, deference, judgment,\nvaluing, and behavior. First, as its derivation from the Latin\nrespicere, (to look back at, look again) suggests, respect is\na form of regard: a mode of attention to and acknowledgment of an\nobject as something to be taken seriously. Respecting something\ncontrasts with being oblivious or indifferent to it, ignoring or\nquickly dismissing it, neglecting or disregarding it, or carelessly or\nintentionally misidentifying it. Respect is also perspectival: we can\nrespect something from a moral perspective, or from prudential,\nevaluative, social, or institutional perspectives. From different\nperspectives, we might attend to different aspects of the object in\nrespecting it or respect it in different ways. For example, one might\nregard another human individual as a rights-bearer, a judge, a\nsuperlative singer, a trustworthy person, or a threat to one\u2019s\nsecurity, and the respect one accords her in each case will be\ndifferent. It is in virtue of this aspect of careful attention that\nrespect is sometimes thought of as an epistemic virtue.\n\nAs responsive, respect is as much object-based as subject-generated;\ncertain objects call for, claim, elicit, deserve, are owed respect. We\nrespect something not because we want to but because we recognize that\nwe have to respect it (Wood 1999); respect involves \u201ca deontic\nexperience\u201d\u2014the experience that one must pay\nattention and respond appropriately (Birch 1993). It thus is\nmotivational: it is the recognition of something \u201cas directly\ndetermining our will without reference to what is wanted by our\ninclinations\u201d (Rawls 2000, 153). In this way respect differs\nfrom, for example, liking and fearing, which have their sources in the\nsubject\u2019s interests or desires. When we respect something, we\nheed its call, accord it its due, acknowledge its claim. Thus, respect\ninvolves deference, in the most basic sense of yielding to the\nobject\u2019s demands.\n\nThe idea that the object \u201cdrives\u201d respect, as it were, is\ninvolved in the view that respect is an unmediated emotional response\n(Buss 1999b). But respect is typically treated as also an expression\nof the agency of the respecter: respect is deliberate, a matter of\ndirected rather than grabbed attention, of reflective consideration\nand judgment. On this view, respect is reason-governed: we cannot\nrespect a particular object for just any old reason or no reason at\nall. Rather, we respect something for the reason that it has, in our\njudgment, some respect-warranting characteristic, that makes it the\nkind of object that calls for that kind of response (Cranor 1975;\nPettit 2021). And these reasons are both objective, in the sense that\ntheir weight or stringency does not depend on the respecter\u2019s\ninterests, goals, or desires, and categorical, in the sense that\nacting against these reasons, other things equal, is wrong (Raz 2001).\nRespect is thus both subjective and objective. It is subjective in\nthat the subject\u2019s response is constructed from her\nunderstanding of the object and its characteristics and her judgments\nabout the legitimacy of its call and how fittingly to address the\ncall. The objectivity of respect means that an individual\u2019s\nrespect for an object can be inappropriate or unwarranted, for the\nobject may not have the features she takes it to have, or the features\nshe takes to be respect-warranting might not be, or her idea of how\nproperly to treat the object might be mistaken. Moreover, the logic of\nrespect is the logic of objectivity and universality, in several ways.\nIn respecting an object, we respond to it as something whose\nsignificance is independent of us, not determined by our feelings or\ninterests. Our reasons for respecting something are, logically,\nreasons for other people to respect it (or at least to endorse our\nrespect for it from a common point of view). Respect is thus, unlike\nerotic or filial love, an impersonal response to the object. And if F\nis a respect-warranting feature of object O, then respecting O on\naccount of F commits us, other things equal, to respecting other\nthings with feature F.\n\nThere are many different kinds of objects that can reasonably be\nrespected and many different reasons why they warrant respect. Thus,\nwarranted responses can take different forms. Some things are\ndangerous or powerful; respecting them can involve fear, awe,\nself-protection, or submission. Other things have authority over us\nand the respect they are due includes acknowledgment of their\nauthority and perhaps obedience to their authoritative commands. Other\nforms of respect are modes of valuing, appreciating the object as\nhaving worth or importance that is independent of, perhaps even at\nvariance with, our desires or commitments. Thus, we can respect things\nwe don\u2019t like or agree with, such as our enemies or someone\nelse\u2019s opinion. Valuing respect is kin to esteem, admiration,\nveneration, reverence, and honor, while regarding something as utterly\nworthless or insignificant or disdaining or having contempt for it is\nincompatible with respecting it. Respect also aims to value its object\nappropriately, so it contrasts with degradation and discounting. The\nkinds of valuing that respect involves also contrast with other forms\nof valuing such as promoting or using (Anderson 1993, Pettit 1989).\nIndeed, regarding a person merely as useful (treating her as just a\nsexual object, an ATM machine, a research subject) is commonly\nidentified as a central form of disrespect for persons, and many\npeople decry the killing of endangered wild animals for their tusks or\nhides as disrespectful of nature.\n\nFinally, attitudes of respect typically have a behavioral component.\nIn respecting an object, we often consider it to be making legitimate\nclaims on our conduct as well as our thoughts and feelings and so we\nare disposed to behave appropriately. Appropriate behavior includes\nrefraining from certain treatment of the object or acting only in\nparticular ways in connection with it, ways that are regarded as\nfitting, deserved by, or owed to the object. And there are very many\nways to respect things: keeping our distance from them, helping them,\npraising or emulating them, obeying or abiding by them, not violating\nor interfering with them, destroying them only in some ways,\nprotecting or being careful with them, talking about them in ways that\nreflect their worth or status, mourning them, nurturing them. One can\nbehave in respectful ways, however, without having respect for the\nobject, as when a teen who disdains adults behaves respectfully toward\nher friend\u2019s parents in a scheme to get the car, manipulating\nrather than respecting them. To be a form or expression of respect,\nbehavior has to be motivated by one\u2019s acknowledgment of the\nobject as rightly calling for that behavior. On the other hand,\ncertain kinds of feelings would not count as respect if they did not\nfind expression in behavior or involved no dispositions to behave in\nappropriate ways, and if they did not spring from perceptions or\njudgments that the object is worthy of or calls for such behavior.\n\nThe attitudes of respect, then, have cognitive dimensions (beliefs,\nacknowledgments, judgments, commitments), affective dimensions\n(emotions, feelings, ways of experiencing things), and conative\ndimensions (motivations, dispositions to act and forbear from acting);\nsome forms also have valuational dimensions. One last dimension is\nnormative: the attitudes and actions of respect are governed by norms\nthat set standards of success or failure in responding to\nrespect-worthy-objects. Some norms are moral, grounded in moral\nprinciples or morally important characteristics of respect-worthy\nobjects and both endorsable by and authoritative for all moral agents.\nOther norms are social, arising from dimensions of social life,\ngrounded in socially significant characteristics of objectives, and\nauthoritative or applicable (only) for participants in that form of\nsociality.\n1.2 Kinds of Respect\n\nThat it is the nature of the object that determines its\nrespect-worthiness, and that there are different kinds of objects\ncalling for correspondingly different responses, have led many\nphilosophers to argue that there are different kinds of respect. In\nwhat follows, three sets of distinctions will be discussed.\n\nSpeculating on the historical development of the idea that all persons\nas such deserve respect, and using terms found in Kant\u2019s\nwritings on Achtung (the German word usually translated as\n\u201crespect\u201d), Feinberg (1975) identifies three concepts for\nwhich \u201crespect\u201d has been the name. (1) Respekt,\nis the \u201cuneasy and watchful attitude that has \u2018the element\nof fear\u2019 in it\u201d (1975, 1). Its objects are dangerous or\npowerful things. It is respekt that woodworkers are\nencouraged to have for power tools, a new sailor might be admonished\nto have for the sea, and a child might have for an abusive parent.\nRespekt contrasts with contemptuous disregard; it is shown in\nconduct that is cautious, self-protective, other-placating. (2) The\nsecond concept, observantia, is the moralized analogue of\nrespekt. It involves regarding the object as making a\nrightful claim on our conduct, as deserving moral consideration in its\nown right, independently of considerations of personal well-being. It\nis observantia, Feinberg maintains, that historically was\nextended first to classes of non-dangerous but otherwise worthy people\nand then to all persons as such, regardless of merit or ability.\nObservantia encompasses both the respect said to be owed to\nall humans equally and the forms of polite respect and deference that\nacknowledge different social positions. On Kant\u2019s account,\nobservantia is the kind of respect we have an inviolable\nmoral duty to give every person, both by acknowledging their claim to\nmoral equality with us and by never treating persons as if they have\nlittle or no worth compared with ourselves (Kant 1797, 6:499). (3)\nReverentia, the third concept, is the special feeling of\nprofound awe and respect we involuntarily experience in the presence\nof something extraordinary or sublime, a feeling that both humbles and\nuplifts us. On Kant\u2019s account, the moral law and people who\nexemplify it in morally worthy actions elicit reverentia from\nus, for we experience the law or its exemplification as\n\u201csomething that always trumps our inclinations in determining\nour wills\u201d (Feinberg 1975, 2). Feinberg sees different forms of\npower as underlying the three kinds of respect; in each case, respect\nis the acknowledgment of the power of something other than ourselves\nto demand, command, or make claims on our attention, consideration,\nand deference. (See further discussion of Kant\u2019s account in\nsection 2.2.)\n\nHudson (1980) draws a four-fold distinction among kinds of respect,\naccording to the bases in the objects. Consider the following\nexamples: (a) respecting a colleague highly as a scholar and having a\nlot of respect for someone with \u201cguts\u201d; (b) a mountain\nclimber\u2019s respect for the elements and a tennis player\u2019s\nrespect for her opponent\u2019s strong backhand; (c) respecting the\nterms of an agreement and respecting a person\u2019s rights; and (d)\nshowing respect for a judge by rising when she enters the courtroom\nand respecting a worn-out flag by burning it rather than tossing it in\nthe trash. The respect in (a), evaluative respect, is similar\nto other favorable attitudes such as esteem and admiration; it is\nearned or deserved (or not) depending on whether and to the degree\nthat the object is judged to meet certain standards. Obstacle\nrespect, in (b), is a matter of regarding the object as something\nthat, if not taken proper account of in one\u2019s decisions about\nhow to act, could prevent one from achieving one\u2019s ends. The\nobjects of (c) directive respect are directives: things such\nas requests, rules, advice, laws, or rights claims that may be taken\nas guides to action. One respects a directive when one\u2019s actions\nintentionally comply with it. The objects of (d) institutional\nrespect are social institutions or practices, positions or roles\nin an institution or practice, and persons or things that occupy\npositions in or represent the institution. Institutional respect is\nconstituted by behavior that conforms to rules that prescribe certain\nconduct as respectful. These four forms of respect differ in several\nways. Each identifies a quite different kind of feature of objects as\nthe basis of respect. Each is expressed in action in quite different\nways, although evaluative respect need not be expressed at all.\nEvaluative respect centrally involves having a favorable attitude\ntoward the object, while the other forms do not. Directive respect\ndoes not admit of degrees (one either obeys the rule or\ndoesn\u2019t), but the others do (we can have more evaluative respect\nfor one person than another). Hudson uses this distinction to argue\nthat respect for persons is not a unique kind of respect but should be\nconceived rather as involving some combination or other of these\nfour.\n\nTo Hudson\u2019s four-fold classification, Dillon (1992a) adds a\nfifth form, care respect, which draws on feminist ethics of\ncare. Care respect, which is exemplified in an\nenvironmentalist\u2019s deep respect for nature, involves both\nregarding the object as having profound and perhaps unique value and\nso cherishing it, and perceiving it as fragile or calling for special\ncare and so acting or forbearing to act out of felt benevolent concern\nfor it.\n\nDarwall (1977) distinguishes two kinds of respect: recognition\nrespect and appraisal respect. Recognition respect is\nthe disposition to give appropriate weight or consideration in\none\u2019s practical deliberations to some fact about the object and\nto regulate one\u2019s conduct by constraints derived from that fact.\n(Frankena 1986 and Cranor 1982, 1983 refer to this as\n\u201cconsideration respect.\u201d) A wide variety of objects can be\nobjects of recognition respect, including laws, dangerous things,\nsomeone\u2019s feelings, social institutions, nature, the selves\nindividuals present in different contexts, people occupying certain\nsocial roles or positions, and persons as such. Appraisal respect, by\ncontrast, is an attitude of positive appraisal, the \u201cthinking highly\nof\u201d kind of respect that we might have a great deal of for some\nindividuals, little of for others, or lose for those whose clay feet\nor dirty laundry becomes apparent. Appraisal respect involves a\ngrading assessment of a person in light of some qualitative standards\nthat they can meet or not to greater and lesser degrees. It differs\nfrom the more widely grounded esteem and admiration in that it is\nconcerned specifically with the moral quality of people\u2019s\ncharacter or conduct, or with other characteristics that are relevant\nto their moral quality as agents. \n\nThe recognition/appraisal distinction has been quite influential and\nis widely regarded as the fundamental distinction. Indeed, evaluative\nrespect is similar to appraisal respect, while respekt,\nobstacle respect, observantia, directive respect,\ninstitutional respect, and care respect could be analyzed as forms of\nrecognition respect. Some philosophers, however, have found the\nrecognition/appraisal distinction to be inadequate, inasmuch as it\nseems to have no room for reverentia, especially in the form\nof the felt experience of the sublimity of the moral law and of\npersons as such (e.g., Buss 1999b), and it seems to obscure the\nvariety of valuings that different modes of respect can involve. Much\nphilosophical work has involved refining the recognition/appraisal\ndistinction.\n\nIn the rest of this article, I will discuss respect and self-respect\nusing Darwall\u2019s term \u201crecognition respect,\u201d\nHudson\u2019s term \u201cevaluative respect,\u201d and\nFeinberg\u2019s \u201creverential respect\u201d (the last for the\nvaluing feeling that is involuntary motivational without being\ndeliberative), specifying the valuing dimensions as necessary.\n\nIn everyday discourse, respect most commonly refers to one of two\nattitudes or modes of conduct. The first is the kind of respect\nindividuals show (or should show) others because of the latter\u2019s\nsocial role or position. For example, children should respect their\nparents by listening and courtroom spectators should respect the\njudge. by rising upon her entrance. This is a social form of\nrecognition respect that is, typically, structured by social\ninstitutions whose norms are authoritative for participants in the\ninstitutions and that need not involve any positive valuing of the\nobject. \u201cRespect\u201d is also commonly used, second, in a\nvaluing sense, to mean thinking highly of someone: having a lot of\nrespect for someone who has overcome adversity or losing all respect\nfor a betrayer. This is evaluative respect. However, philosophical\nattention to respect has tended to focus on recognition respect that\nacknowledges or values the object from a moral point of view, which we\ncan call \u201cmoral recognition respect.\u201d These discussions tend to relate\nsuch respect to the concepts of moral standing or moral worth. Moral\nstanding, or moral considerability, is the idea that certain things\nmatter morally in their own right and so are appropriate objects of\ndirect fundamental moral consideration or concern (Birch 1993; P.\nTaylor 1986). Alternatively, it is argued that certain things\nhave a distinctive kind of intrinsic moral worth, often called\n\u201cdignity,\u201d in virtue of which evoke reverential respect or\nought to be accorded some valuing form of moral recognition respect.\nIn modern philosophical discussions, humans are universally regarded\nas the paradigm objects of moral respect. Although some theorists\nargue that nature (or, all living beings, species, ecosystems) or\nsocieties (or, cultures, traditions) also warrant the moral\nconsideration and valuing of moral recognition respect, most\nphilosophical discussion of respect has focused on moral recognition\nrespect for persons.\n2. Respect for Persons\n\nPeople can be the objects or recipients of different forms of respect.\nWe can (directive) respect a person\u2019s legal rights, show\n(institutional) respect for the president by calling her \u201cMs.\nPresident,\u201d have a healthy (obstacle) respect (respekt)\nfor an easily angered person, (care) respect someone by cherishing her\nin her concrete particularity, (evaluatively) respect an individual\nfor her commitment to a worthy project, and accord one person the same\nbasic moral respect we think any person deserves. Thus, the idea of\nrespect for persons is ambiguous. Because both institutional respect\nand evaluative respect can be for persons in roles or position, the\nphrase \u201crespecting someone as an R\u201d might mean either\nhaving high regard for a person\u2019s excellent performance in the\nrole or behaving in ways that express due consideration or deference\nto an individual qua holder of that position. Similarly, the phrase\n\u201crespecting someone as a person\u201d might refer to appraising\nher as overall a morally good person, or acknowledging her standing as\nan equal in the moral community, or attending to her as the particular\nperson she is as opposed to treating her like any other human being.\nIn the literature of moral and political philosophy, the notion of\nrespect for persons commonly means a kind of respect that all people\nare owed morally just because they are persons, regardless of social\nposition, individual characteristics or achievements, or moral\nmerit.\n\nIn times past, it was taken for granted that respect for human beings\nwas a hierarchical notion; some humans, it was thought, have a higher\nmoral standing and a greater moral worth than others and so are\nmorally entitled to greater recognition respect. (Not just in times\npast \u2013 this is still the core of racism, sexism, and other forms\nof bigotry.) However, the modern understanding of respect for persons\nrests on the idea that all persons as such have a distinctive moral\nstatus in virtue of which we have unconditional obligations to regard\nand treat them in ways that are constrained by certain inviolable\nlimits. This is sometimes expressed in terms of rights: all persons,\nit is said, have a fundamental moral right to respect simply because\nthey are persons. Connected with this is the idea that all persons are\nfundamentally equal, despite the very many things that distinguish one\nindividual from another. All persons, that is, have the moral standing\nof equality in the moral community and are equally worthy of and owed\nrespect. Respect acknowledges the moral standing of equal persons as\nsuch and is also the key mode of valuing persons as persons.\n\nBut which kind of respect are all persons owed? It is obvious that we\ncould not owe every individual evaluative respect, let alone equal\nevaluative respect, since not everyone acts morally correctly or has\nan equally morally good character. Moreover, since reverential respect\nis an involuntary emotional response to something that is\n\u201cawesome,\u201d but we can\u2019t have a moral obligation to\nexperience an emotion, reverential respect can\u2019t be the kind we\nowe all persons. So, if it is true that all persons are owed or have a\nmoral right to respect just as persons, then the concept of respect\nfor person has to be analyzed as some form or combination of forms of\nmoral recognition respect. One analysis takes moral recognition\nrespect for a person as a person to involve recognizing that this\nbeing is a person, appreciating that persons as such have a\ndistinctive moral standing and worth, understanding this standing and\nworth as the source of moral constraints on one\u2019s attitudes, desires,\nand conduct, and viewing, valuing, and treating this person only in\nways that are appropriate to and due persons (Dillon 1997, 2010).\n2.1 Some important issues\n\nIt is controversial, however, whether we do indeed have a moral\nobligation to respect all persons regardless of merit, and if so, why.\nThere are disagreements, for example, about the scope of the claim,\nthe grounds of respect, and the justification for the obligation.\nThere is also a divergence of views about the kinds of treatment that\nare respectful of persons.\n\nOne source of controversy concerns the scope of the concept of a\nperson. Although in everyday discourse the word \u201cperson\u201d\nis synonymous with \u201chuman being,\u201d some philosophical\ndiscussions treat it as a technical term whose range of application\nmight not be coextensive with the class of human beings (just as, for\nlegal purposes, business corporations are regarded as persons). This\nis because some of the reasons that have been given for respecting\npersons entail both that some non-human things warrant the same\nrespect on the very same grounds as humans and that not all humans do.\nConsequently, one question an account of respect for persons has to\naddress is: Who or what are persons that are owed respect? Different\nanswers have been offered, including all human beings; all and only\nthose humans who are themselves capable of respecting persons; all\nbeings capable of rational activity, or of sympathy and empathy, or of\nvaluing, whether human or not; all beings capable of functioning as\nmoral agents, whether human or not; all beings capable of\nparticipating in certain kinds of social relations, whether human or\nnot. The second, third, and fourth answers would seem to exclude\ndeceased humans and humans who lack sufficient mental capacity, such\nas the profoundly mentally disabled, the severely mentally ill and\nsenile, those in persistent vegetative states, the pre-born, and\nperhaps very young children. The third, fourth, and fifth answers\nmight include humans with diminished capacities, artificial beings\n(androids, sophisticated robots), spiritual beings (gods, angels),\nextraterrestrial beings, and certain animals (apes, dolphins).\n\nIn trying to clarify who or what we are obligated to respect, we are\nnaturally led to a question about the ground or basis of respect: What\nis it about persons that makes them matter morally in such a way as to\nmake them worthy of respect? One common way of answer this question is\nto look for some morally valuable natural qualities or capacities that\nare common to all beings that are noncontroversially owed respect (for\nexample, all normal adult humans). Even regarding humans, there is a\nquestion of scope: Are all humans owed respect? If respect is\nsomething to which all human beings have an equal claim, then, it has\nbeen argued, the basis has to be something that all humans possess\nequally or in virtue of which humans are naturally equal, or a\nthreshold quality that all humans possess, with variations above the\nthreshold ignored. Some philosophers have argued that certain\ncapacities fit the bill; others argue that there is no quality\nactually possessed by all humans that could be a plausible ground for\na moral obligation of equal respect. Some draw from this the\nconclusion that respect is owed not to all but only to some human\nbeings, for example, only morally good persons (Dean 2014). Another\nview is that the search for valuable qualities possessed by all humans\nthat could ground universally owed moral recognition respect gets\nthings backwards: rather than being grounded in some fact about\nhumans, respect confers moral standing and worth on them (Sensen 2017;\nBird forthcoming). But the last view still leaves the questions: why\nshould this morally powerful standing and worth be conferred on\nhumans? And is it conferred on all humans? Yet another question of\nscope is: Must persons always be respected? One view is that\nindividuals forfeit their claim to respect by, for example, committing\nheinous crimes of disrespect against other persons, such as murder in\nthe course of terrorism or genocide. Another view is that there are no\ncircumstances under which it is morally justifiable to not respect a\nperson, and that even torturers and child-rapists, though they may\ndeserve the most severe condemnation and punishment and may have\nforfeited their rights to freedom and perhaps to life, still remain\npersons to whom we have obligations of respect, since the grounds of\nrespect are independent of moral merit or demerit (Hill 2000b).\n\nThere is a further question of justification to be addressed, for it\nis one thing to say that persons have a certain valuable quality, but\nquite another thing to say that there is a moral obligation to respect\npersons (Hill 1997). So, we must ask: What reasons do we have for\nbelieving that the fact that persons possess quality X entails that we\nare morally obligated to respect persons by, for example, treating\nthem in certain ways? Another way of asking a justification question\nseeks not a normative connection between qualities of persons and\nmoral obligation, but an explanation for our belief that humans (and\nperhaps other beings) are owed respect, for example: What in our\nexperience of other humans or in our evolutionary history explains the\ndevelopment and power of this belief? On some accounts, our actual\nfelt experiences of reverential respect play a significant role (Buss\n1999b). In other accounts, what justifies accepting our experience of\nrespect for humans (or other beings) as grounds for an obligation is\nits coherence with our other moral beliefs (Hill 2000b; Margalit 1996;\nGibbard 1990).\n\nOther questions concern what respecting persons requires of us. Some\nphilosophers argue that the obligation to respect person functions as\na negative constraint: respect involves refraining from regarding or\ntreating persons in certain ways. For example, we ought not to treat\nthem as if they were worthless or had value only insofar as we find\nthem useful or interesting, or as if they were mere objects or\nspecimens, or as if they were vermin or dirt; we ought not to violate\ntheir basic moral rights, or interfere with their efforts to make\ntheir own decisions and govern their own conduct, or humiliate them,\nor treat them in ways that flout their nature and worth as persons.\nOther theorists maintain that we also have positive duties of respect:\nwe ought, for example, to try to see each of them and the world from\ntheir own points of view, or help them to promote their morally\nacceptable ends, or protect them from their own self-harming\ndecisions. And some philosophers note that it may be more respectful\nto judge someone\u2019s actions or character negatively or to punish\nsomeone for wrongdoing than to treat them as if they were not\nresponsible for what they did, although requirements of respect would\nimpose limits on how such judgments may be expressed and how persons\nmay be punished. Another question concerns equality of respect. While\nmost theorists agree that moral recognition respect is owed equally to\nall persons and that it requires treating persons as equals (as all\nhaving the same basic moral worth and status), there is disagreement\nabout whether respect requires that persons be treated equally\n(whatever is done or not done for or to one person must be done or not\ndone for or to everyone). One view is that equal treatment would fail\nto respect important differences between individuals (Frankfurt\n1999). Perhaps, however, as regards respect as a negative\nconstraint, it is appropriate to treat all persons the same: no one\nshould be treated like worthless garbage (just as no U.S. citizen\nshould be compelled to incriminate themselves), while as regards\nrespect as a positive duty, it may be more respectful of each person\nto treat individuals with different needs, aims, and circumstances\ndifferently (as a loving parent might allow her older children but not\nthe younger ones to have social media accounts).\n2.2 Kant\u2019s Account of Respect for Persons\n\nThe most influential account of respect for persons is found in the\nmoral philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1785, 1788, 1793, 1797). Indeed,\nmost contemporary discussions of respect for persons explicitly claim\nto rely on, develop, or challenge some aspect of Kant\u2019s ethics.\nCentral to Kant\u2019s ethical theory is the claim that all persons,\nregardless of personal qualities or achievements, social position, or\nmoral track-record, are owed respect just because they are persons,\nthat is, beings with rational and autonomous wills. To be a person is\nto have a status and worth unlike that of any other kind of\nbeing: it is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the only\nappropriate response to such a being is respect. Moreover, respect for\npersons is not only appropriate but also unconditionally required:\npersons must always be respected. Because we are all too often\ninclined not to respect each other, one formulation of the Categorical\nImperative, which is the supreme principle of morality, commands that\nour actions express due respect for persons: \u201cAct in such a way\nthat you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of\nany other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an\nend\u201d (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\n(Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) (1785, 4:429).\nAlthough commentators disagree about how precisely to understand this\nimperative, one common view is that it defines our fundamental moral\nobligation as respect all persons, including ourselves, and thus\ndefines morally right actions as those that express respect for\npersons as ends in themselves and morally wrong actions as those that\nexpress disrespect or contempt for persons (Wood 1999). (On other\nreadings, respect is one of our fundamental duties, but there are\nothers, such as love, justice, and moral self-improvement.) In\naddition to this general commandment, Kant argues that there are also\nmore specific duties of respect for other persons and self-respect, to\nwhich we\u2019ll return. For now, we must address the question, What\nis it to be an end in itself and to possess dignity?\n\nAn end, for Kant, is anything for the sake of which we act. Kant\nidentifies two kinds of ends. The first are subjective ends, which are\nthings we want, which we pursue or promote through means we think will\nhelp us to get or advance them. The value of subjective ends is\nconditional on or relative to the desire or interests of the\nindividual who values them. The other kind of end is objective. These\nare ends in themselves, ends whose value is not dependent on any\ninterests or desires but is absolute and unconditional, grounded\nsolely in what they are. Kant maintains that all and only rational\nbeings are ends in themselves. The technical term\n\u201cpersons\u201d delineates the category of beings whose rational\nnature \u201calready marks them out as ends in themselves\u2026and\nan object of respect\u201d (Groundwork 4: 428).\n\nTo act for the sake of persons as ends in themselves, to respect them,\nis not to pursue or promote them, but to value them as the\nunconditionally valuable beings they are. It is also to acknowledge\nthat there are constraints on our treatment of persons, for to be an\nend in itself is also to be a limit--just as the end of the road puts\na limit on our travels, so an end in itself puts an absolute limit on\nthe subjective ends we may set, the means we may use to pursue them,\nand, very importantly, on how we may treat ends in themselves. Such\nbeings must never be used as if they were merely means, as if they\nwere nothing more than tools that we may use however we want to\nadvance our ends. Note, however, that it is not wrong to treat persons\nas means to our ends; indeed, we could not get along in life if we\ncould not make use of the talents, abilities, service, and labor of\nother people. What we must never do is treat persons as mere\nmeans to our ends, to treat them as if the only value they have is\nwhat derives from their usefulness to us. Rather, we must always treat\nthem \u201cas the same time as an end.\u201d\n\nKant holds that persons, as ends in themselves, have dignity (Die\nMetaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of Morals)\n(1797), 6: 435). But what is dignity? Until the last century or so,\n\u201cdignity\u201d (from the Latin dignitas, worthiness)\nreferred to a high social status associated with the aristocracy,\noffices of power, and high church positions. Dignity thus\ndistinguished socially important people from the hoi polloi,\nwho had no dignity (Debes 2017). Kant\u2019s view that every person\nhas dignity thus marks a revolution in valuation (but see Dean 2014\nand Hay 2012 for the view that only morally good people have dignity).\nCommentators disagree about how to understand what Kant means by\ndignity (cf. Sensen 2017, 2011; Cureton 2013; Darwall 2008). But the\nmost common interpretation is that dignity is a distinctive kind\nobjective worth that is absolute (not conditional on anyone\u2019s needs,\ndesires, or interests, and a value that everyone has an overriding\nreason to acknowledge); intrinsic or inherent (not bestowed or\nearned and not subject to being lost or forfeited); incomparable and\nthe highest form of worth (a being with dignity cannot rationally be\nexchanged for or replaced by any other valued object, and is\ninfinitely valuable, we might say, rather than worth $5 or $5\nmillion).\n\nIn arguing for respect for the dignity of persons, Kant explicitly\nrejects two other conceptions of human value: the aristocratic idea of\nhonor that individuals differentially deserve according to their\nsocial rank, individual accomplishments, or moral virtue (on the\naristocratic dimensions of honor, see Darwall 2013; Berger 1983), and\nthe view, baldly expressed by Hobbes, that:\n\n\u2026 the value or worth of a man is, as of all other things, his\nprice\u2014that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of\nhis power\u2014and therefore is not absolute but a thing dependent on\nthe need and judgment of another. (Hobbes 1651, 79)\n\n\nIn The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant agrees with Hobbes that if\nwe think of humans as merely one kind of animal among others \u201cin\nthe system of nature,\u201d we can ascribe a price to them, an\nextrinsic value that depends on their usefulness. But, he argues,\n\na human being regarded as a person, that is, as the subject of morally\npractical reason, is exalted above all price\u2026as an end in\nhimself he possesses a dignity by which he exacts\nrespect for himself from all other beings in the world.\n(MM, 6: 434\u2013435)\n\n\nAgainst the aristocratic view Kant argues that although individuals as\nmembers of some social community or other may have or lack meritorious\naccomplishment or status or may deserve honor or evaluative respect to\ndifferent degrees or not at all, and some people deserve social\nrecognition respect based on their socially significant features or\npositions, all persons as members of the moral community, i.e., the\ncommunity of all and only ends in themselves, are owed the same moral\nrecognition respect, for the dignity that they possesses as rational\nis unconditional and independent of all distinguishing facts about or\nfeatures of them.\n\nAs the Categorical Imperative indicates, in virtue of the humanity in\nthem that persons are, and so ought to be treated as, ends in\nthemselves. Commentators generally identify humanity (that which makes\nus distinctively human beings and sets us apart from all other animal\nspecies) with two closely related aspects of rationality: the capacity\nto set ends and the capacity to be autonomous, both of which are\ncapacities to be a moral agent (for example, Wood 1999; Hill 1997;\nKorsgaard 1996). The capacity to set ends, which is the power of\nrational choice, is the capacity to value things through rational\njudgment: to determine, under the influence of reason independently of\nantecedent instincts or desires, that something is valuable or\nimportant, that it is worth seeking or valuing. It is also, thereby,\nthe capacity to value ends in themselves, and so it includes the\ncapacity for respect (Velleman 1999). The capacity to be autonomous is\nthe capacity to be self-legislating and self-governing, that is, (a)\nthe capacity to legislate moral laws that are valid for all rational\nbeings through one\u2019s rational willing by recognizing, using\nreason alone, what counts as a moral obligation, and (b) the capacity\nthen to freely resolve to act in accordance with moral laws because\nthey are self-imposed by one\u2019s own reason and not because one is\ncompelled to act by any forces external to one\u2019s reason and\nwill, including one\u2019s own desires and inclinations. The capacity\nto be autonomous is thus also the capacity to freely direct, shape,\nand determine the meaning of one\u2019s own life, and it is the\ncondition for moral responsibility. It is then, not as members of the\nbiological species homo sapiens that human beings have\ndignity and so are owed moral recognition respect, but as rational\nbeings who are capable of moral agency.\n\nThere are several important consequences of the Kantian view of the\nscope of moral recognition respect for persons as persons. First,\nwhile all normally functioning human beings possess the rational\ncapacities that ground recognition respect, there can be humans in\nwhom these capacities are altogether absent and who therefore, on this\nview, are not persons and are not owed respect. Second, these\ncapacities could, in principle, be possessed by beings who are not\nbiologically human, and such beings would also be persons with dignity\nwhom we are morally obligated to respect. Third, because dignity does\nnot depend on how well or badly the capacities for moral agency are\nexercised, on whether a person acts morally or has a morally good\ncharacter or not, dignity is not a matter of degree and cannot be\ndiminished or lost through vice or morally bad action or increased\nthrough virtue or morally correct action. Thus, the morally\nworst person has the same dignity as the morally best, although the\nformer, we might say, fail to live up to their dignity. Likewise,\nmoral recognition respect is not something individuals have to earn or\nmight fail to earn, so even the morally worst individuals must still\nbe regarded as ends in themselves and treated with respect. Of course,\nwrongdoing may call for punishment and may be grounds for forfeiting\ncertain rights, but it is not grounds for losing dignity, for being\nregarded as worthless scum, or denied all respect (Hill 2000b). What\ngrounds dignity is something that all persons have in common, not\nsomething that distinguishes one individual from another. Thus, each\nperson is to be respected as an equal among equals, without\nconsideration of individual achievements or failures, social rank,\nmoral merit or demerit. However, the equality of all rational beings\ndoes not entail that persons cannot also be differentially evaluated\nand valued in other ways for their particular qualities,\naccomplishments, merit, or usefulness, although such valuing and\ntreatment must always be constrained by the moral requirement to\naccord recognition respect to persons as ends in themselves.\n\nIn The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant develops the implications\nof this view of persons as ends in themselves. His doctrine of justice\nholds that the fundamental freedom and equality of persons is the\nbasis of the legitimate state, that freedom of choice must be\nrespected and promoted, that persons are bearers of fundamental rights\nand that the moral status of persons imposes limits on permissible\nlegal punishment. In his doctrine of virtue, Kant discusses specific\nmoral duties of recognition respect for other persons, as well as\nduties of recognition self-respect, to which we\u2019ll return below.\nHere, Kant explicitly invokes the notion of respect as\nobservantia. We have no moral duty to feel respect for\nothers; rather, the respect we owe others is \u201cto be understood\nas the maxim of limiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in\nanother person, and so as respect in the practical sense\u201d\n(MM, 6:449). This duty of recognition respect owed to others\nrequires two things: first, that we adopt as a regulating policy a\ncommitment to control our own desire to think well of ourselves (this\ndesire being the main cause of disrespect), and, second, that we\nrefrain from treating others in the following ways: treating them\nmerely as means (valuing them as less than ends in themselves),\nshowing contempt for them (denying that they have any worth), treating\nthem arrogantly (demanding that they value us more highly than they\nvalue themselves), making them look like worthless beings by defaming\nthem by publicly exposing their faults, and ridiculing or mocking\nthem.\n\nSubsequent work in a Kantian vein on the duty of respect for others\nhas expanded the list of ways that we are morally required by respect\nto treat persons. In particular, although Kant says that the duties of\nrecognition respect are strictly negative, consisting in not engaging\nin certain conduct or having certain attitudes, many philosophers have\nargued that respecting others involves positive actions and attitudes\nas well. The importance of autonomy and agency in Kant\u2019s moral\nphilosophy has led many philosophers to highlight respect for\nautonomy. Thus, we respect others as persons (negatively) by doing\nnothing to impair or destroy their capacity for autonomy, by not\ninterfering with their autonomous decisions and their pursuit of the\n(morally acceptable) ends they value, and by not coercing or deceiving\nthem or treating them paternalistically. We also respect them\n(positively) by protecting them from threats to their autonomy (which\nmay require intervention when someone\u2019s current decisions seem\nto put their autonomy at risk) and by promoting autonomy and the\nconditions for it (for example, by allowing and encouraging\nindividuals to make their own decisions, take responsibility for their\nactions, and control their own lives). Some philosophers have\nhighlighted Kant\u2019s claim that rationality is the ground for\nrecognition respect, arguing that to respect others is to engage with\nthem not as instruments or obstacles but as persons who are to be\nreasoned with. The importance of the capacity to set ends and value\nthings has been taken by some philosophers to entail that respect also\ninvolves helping others to promote and protect what they value and to\npursue their ends, provided these are compatible with due respect for\nother persons, and making an effort to appreciate values that are\ndifferent from our own. Kant\u2019s emphasis in the doctrine of\njustice on the fundamental rights that persons have has led still\nothers to view the duty of recognition respect for persons as the duty\nto respect the moral rights they have as persons; some have claimed\nthat the duty to respect is nothing more than the duty to refrain from\nviolating these rights (Benn 1988; Feinberg 1970).\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that on Kant\u2019s account, both the moral law\nand morally good people--those who do what is right out of respect for\nthe moral law--are also objects of respect. The respect here is\nreverentia, the inescapable felt consciousness of the\nunconditional authority of the law and compelling examples of\nobedience to it, a consciousness of one\u2019s mind \u201cbowing,\u201d as it were,\nin submission. Reverentia can give rise both to recognition\nrespect of the law and persons as such and to evaluative respect for\ngood people. (See discussions in kant\u2019s Groundwork (4:401n);\nMetaphysics of Morals (6:399\u2013418); Kritik der praktischen\nVernunft (Critique of Practical Reason) (1788)\n(5:72\u201376); and Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blo\u00dfen\nVernunft (Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason)\n(1793) (6:21\u201323); and in Stratton-Lake 200; Grenberg 1999; Wood 1999;\nHill 1998; McCarty 1994).\n2.3 Further issues, developments, and applications\n\nPhilosophical discussions of respect since Kant have tended, on the\none hand, to develop or apply various aspects of it, or on the other,\nto take issue with it or develop alternative accounts of respect. Some\nof the discussions have focused on more theoretical issues. For\nexample, Kant gives the notion of respect for persons a central and\nvital role in moral theory. One issue that has since concerned\nphilosophers is whether respect for persons is the definitive focus of\nmorality, either in the sense that moral rightness and goodness and\nhence all specific moral duties, rights, and virtues are explainable\nin terms of respect or in the sense that the supreme moral principle\nfrom which all other principles are derived is a principle of respect\nfor persons. Some philosophers have developed ethical theories in\nwhich a principle of respect for persons is identified as the\nfundamental and comprehensive moral requirement (for example, Donagan\n1977; Downie and Telfer 1969). Others (for example, Hill 1993;\nFrankena 1986; Cranor 1975) argue that while respect for persons is\nsurely a very important moral consideration, it cannot be the\nprinciple from which the rest of morality is deduced. They maintain\nthat there are moral contexts in which respect for persons is not an\nissue and that there are other dimensions of our moral relations with\nothers that seem not to reduce to respect. Moreover, they argue, such\na principle would seem not to provide moral grounds for believing that\nwe ought to treat mentally incapacitated humans or nonhuman animals\ndecently, or would (as Kant argues) make a duty to respect such beings\nonly an indirect duty\u2014one we have only because it is a way of\nrespecting persons who value such beings or because our duty to\nrespect ourselves requires that we not engage in activities that would\ndull our ability to treat persons decently\u2014rather than a direct\nduty to such beings (Metaphysics of Morals, 6:443).\n\nSome theorists maintain that utilitarianism, a moral theory generally\nthought to be a rival to Kant\u2019s theory, is superior with regard\nto this last point. A utilitarian might argue that it is sentience\nrather than the capacity for rational autonomy that is the ground of\nmoral recognition respect, and so would regard mentally incapacitated\nhumans and nonhuman animals as having moral standing and so as worthy\nof at least some moral respect in themselves. Another issue, then, is\nwhether utilitarianism (or more generally, consequentialism) can\nindeed accommodate a principle of respect for persons. In opposition\nto the utilitarian claim, some Kantians argue that Kant\u2019s ethics\nis distinguishable from consequentialist ethics precisely in\nmaintaining that the fundamental demand of morality is not that we\npromote some value, such as the happiness of sentient beings, but that\nwe respect the worth of humanity regardless of the consequences of\ndoing so (Wood 1999; Korsgaard 1996). Thus, some philosophers argue\nthat utilitarianism is inconsistent with respect for persons, inasmuch\nas utilitarianism, in requiring that all actions, principles, or\nmotives promote the greatest good, requires treating persons as mere\nmeans on those occasions when doing so maximizes utility, whereas the\nvery point of a principle of respect for persons is to rule out such\ntrading of persons and their dignity for some other value (Benn 1988,\nBrody 1982). In opposition, other theorists maintain not only that a\nconsequentialist theory can accommodate the idea of respect for\npersons (Cummiskey 2008, 1990; Pettit 1989; Gruzalski 1982; Landesman\n1982; Downie and Telfer 1969), but also that utilitarianism is\nderivable from a principle of respect for persons (Downie and Telfer\n1969) and that consequentialist theories provide a better grounding\nfor duties to respect persons (Pettit 1989).\n\nIn addition to the debate between Kantian theory and utilitarianism,\ntheoretical work has also been done in developing the role of respect\nfor persons in Habermasian communicative ethics (Young 1997; Benhabib\n1991) and in exploring respect in the ethics of other philosophers,\nincluding ancient Greek poets (Giorgini 2017), Plato (Rowe 2017),\nAristotle (Thompson 2017; Weber 2017; Rabb\u00e5s 2015; Jacobs 1995;\nPreus 1991), Hobbes (2017), Hegel (Laitinen 2017; Moland 2002), and\nMill (Loizides 2017). Cross-cultural explorations include discussions\nof similarities and differences between western (Kantian) views of\nrespect for persons and Indian (Ghosh-Dastidar 1987), Confucian (Liu\n2019; Lu 2017; Chan 2006; Wawrytko 1982), and Taoist views (Wong\n1984). Several theorists have developed distinctively feminist account\nof respect for persons (Farley 1993; Dillon 1992a).\n\nOther philosophical discussions have been concerned with clarifying\nthe nature of the respect that is owed to persons and of the persons\nthat are owed respect. Some of these discussions aim to refine and\ndevelop Kant\u2019s account, while others criticize it, or offer\nalternatives. One significant non-Kantian account is Pettit\u2019s\nconversive theory of respect for persons (Pettit 2021, 2015). An\ninfluential development of the Kantian account is Darwall\u2019s\nsecond-personal account (2021, 2015, 2008, 2006, 2004), according to\nwhich the regulation of conduct that moral recognition respect\ninvolves arises from our directly acknowledging each other as equal\npersons who have the moral authority to address moral demands to one\nanother that each of us is morally obligated to accept. The reciprocal\nrelations of persons as authoritative claims-makers and mutually\naccountable claims-responders is, in Darwall\u2019s view, one way of\nunderstanding what Kant calls in the Groundwork a\n\u201ckingdom of ends.\u201d\n\nAnother area of interest has been the connections between respect and\nother attitudes and emotions, especially love and between respect and\nvirtues such as trust. For example, Kant argues that we have duties of\nlove to others just as we have duties of respect. However, neither the\nlove nor the respect we owe is a matter of feeling (or, is\npathological, as Kant says), but is, rather, a duty to adopt a certain\nkind of maxim, or policy of action: the duty of love is the duty to\nmake the ends of others my own, the duty of respect is the duty to not\ndegrade others to the status of mere means to my ends (Metaphysics\nof Morals, 6: 449\u2013450). Love and respect, in Kant\u2019s\nview, are intimately united in friendship; nevertheless, they are in\ntension with one another and respect seems to be the morally more\nimportant of the two. Critics object to what they see here as\nKant\u2019s devaluing of emotions, maintaining that emotions are\nmorally significant dimensions of persons both as subjects and as\nobjects of both respect and love. In response, some philosophers\ncontend that respect and love are more similar and closely connected\nin Kant\u2019s theory than is generally recognized (Bagnoli 2003;\nVelleman 1999; Baron 1997; R. Johnson 1997). Others have developed\naccounts of respect that is or incorporates a form of love (agape) or\ncare (Dillon 1992a; Downie and Telfer 1969; Maclagan 1960), and some\nhave argued that emotions are included among the bases of dignity and\nthat a complex emotional repertoire is necessary for Kantian respect\n(Wood 1999; Sherman 1998a; Farley 1993). In a related vein, some\nphilosophers maintain that it is possible to acknowledge that another\nbeing is a person, i.e., a rational moral agent, and yet not have or\ngive respect to that being. What is required for respecting a person\nis not simply recognizing what they are but emotionally experiencing\ntheir value as a person (Thomas 2001a; Buss 1999b; Dillon 1997). Other\nattitudes, emotions, and virtues whose connections with respect have\nbeen discussed are toleration (for example, Carter 2013; Deveaux 1998;\nAddis 2004), forgiveness (for example, Holmgren 1993), good manners\n(Stohr 2012; Buss 1999a), esteem (for example, Brennan and Pettit\n1997), reverence (Woodruff 2003, 2001), honor (Darwall 2015), and\nappreciation (Hill 2021). Work has also been done on attitudes and\nemotions that are (usually taken to be) opposed to respect, such as\narrogance (Dillon 2003) and contempt (Miceli and Castelfranci 2018;\nMason 2017; Bell 2013).\n\nAnother source of dissatisfaction with Kant\u2019s account has been\nwith his characterization of persons and the quality in virtue of\nwhich they must be respected. In particular, Kant\u2019s view that\nthe rational will which is common to all persons is the ground of\nrespect is thought to ignore the moral importance of the concrete\nparticularity of each individual, and his emphasis on autonomy, which\nis often understood to involve the independence of one person from all\nothers, is thought to ignore the essential relationality of human\nbeings (for example, Noggle 1999; Farley 1993; Dillon 1992a; E.\nJohnson 1982). Rather than ignoring what distinguishes one person from\nanother, it is argued, respect should involve attending to each person\nas a distinctive individual and to the concrete realities of human\nlives, and it should involve valuing difference as well as sameness\nand interdependence as well as independence. Other critics respond\nthat respecting differences and particular identities inevitably\nreintroduces hierarchical discrimination that is antithetical to the\nequality among persons that the idea of respect for persons is\nsupposed to express (for example, Bird 2004). Identity and difference\nmay, however, be appropriate objects of other forms of consideration\nand appreciation.\n\nThe ideas of mutual respect or disrespect and respect for\nparticularity and relationality has also become an important topic in\nmoral and political philosophy. Helm has argued that a\n\u201ccommunity of respect\u201d is essential to understanding what\na person is (Helm 2017). Margalit argues that humiliation, both\ndisrespect and the result of being disrespected, is a form of\nexclusion of individuals from the good of community (Margalit 1996).\nOne issue is how persons ought to be respected in multicultural\nliberal democratic societies (for example, Balint 2006; Tomasi 1995;\nC. Taylor 1992; Kymlicka 1989). Respect for persons is one of the\nbasic tenets of liberal democratic societies, which are founded on the\nideal of the equal dignity of all citizens and which realize this\nideal in the equalization of rights and entitlements among all\ncitizens and so the rejection of discrimination and differential\ntreatment. Some writers argue that respecting persons requires\nrespecting the traditions and cultures that permeate and shape their\nindividual identities (Addis 1997). But as the citizenry of such\nsocieties becomes increasingly more diverse and as many groups come to\nregard their identities or very existence as threatened by a\nhomogenizing equality, liberal societies face the question of whether\nthey should or could respond to demands to respect the unique identity\nof individuals or groups by differential treatment, such as extending\npolitical rights or opportunities to some cultural groups (for\nexample, Native Americans, French Canadians, African-Americans) and\nnot others. Some of these discussions are carried out in terms of\nrecognition rather than of respect, although some theorists contrast\nrecognition and respect (McBride 2013). Honneth develops a broader,\ncritical account of recognition that argues for a harmonious\nrelationship among universal (recognition) respect, esteem, and love,\narguing that each is essential for the development of positive\nrelations towards ourselves (Honneth 2007, 1995).\n\nThe idea that all persons are owed respect has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts. For instance, some philosophers employ it to\njustify various positions in normative ethics, such as the claim that\npersons have moral rights (Benn 1971; Feinberg 1970; Downie and Telfer\n1969) or duties (Fried 1978; Rawls 1971), or to argue for principles\nof equality (Williams 1962), justice (Narveson 2002a, 2002b; Nussbaum\n1999), and education (Andrews 1976). Others appeal to respect for\npersons in addressing a wide variety of practical issues such as\nabortion, racism and sexism, rape, punishment, physician-assisted\nsuicide, pornography, affirmative action, forgiveness, terrorism,\nsexual harassment, cooperation with injustice, treatment of gays and\nlesbians, sexual ethics, and many others. In political philosophy,\nrespect for persons has been used to examine issues of global\ninequality (e.g., Moellendorf 2010). One very important application\ncontext is biomedical ethics, where the principle of respect for\nautonomy is one of four basic principles that have become \u201cthe\nbackbone of contemporary Western health care ethics\u201d (Brannigan\nand Boss 2001, 39; see also Beauchamp and Childress 1979/2001 and, for\nexample, Kerstein 2021; Munson 2000; Beauchamp and Walters 1999). The\nidea of respect for patient autonomy has transformed health care\npractice, which had traditionally worked on physician-based\npaternalism, and the principle enters into issues such as informed\nconsent, truth-telling, confidentiality, respecting refusals of\nlife-saving treatment, the use of patients as subjects in medical\nexperimentation, and so on.\n3. Respect for Nature and Nonhuman Beings\n\nAlthough persons are the paradigm objects of moral recognition\nrespect, it is a matter of some debate whether they are the only\nthings that we ought morally to respect. One serious objection raised\nagainst Kant\u2019s ethical theory is that in claiming that only\nrational beings are ends in themselves deserving of respect, it\nlicenses treating all things which aren\u2019t persons as mere means\nto the ends of rational beings, and so it supports domination and\nexploitation of all nonpersons and the natural environment. Taking\nissue with the Kantian position that only persons are respect-worthy,\nmany philosophers have argued that humans who are not agents or not\nyet agents, human embryos, nonhuman animals, sentient creatures,\nplants, species, all living things, biotic communities, the natural\necosystem of our planet, and even mountains, rocks, and viruses have\n(full or perhaps just partial) moral standing or worth and so are\nappropriate objects of or are owed moral recognition respect. Of\ncourse, it is possible to value such things instrumentally insofar as\nthey serve human interests, but the idea is that such things matter\nmorally and have a claim to respect in their own right, independently\nof their usefulness to humans.\n\nA variety of different strategies have been employed in arguing for\nsuch respect claims. For example, the concept of moral recognition\nrespect is sometimes stripped down to its essentials, omitting much of\nthe content of the concept as it appears in respect for persons\ncontexts. The respect that is owed to all things, it can be argued, is\na very basic form of attentive contemplation of the object combined\nwith a prima facie assumption that the object might have\nintrinsic value (Birch 1993). Another strategy is to argue that the\ntrue grounds for moral worth and recognition respect are other than or\nwider than rationality. One version of this strategy (employed by P.\nTaylor 1986) is to argue that all living things, persons and\nnonpersons, have equal inherent worth and so equally deserve the same\nkind of moral respect, because the ground of the worth of living\nthings that are nonpersons is continuous with the ground of the worth\nfor persons. For example, we can regard all living things as\nrespect-worthy in virtue of being quasi-agents and centers of\norganized activity that pursue their own good in their own unique way.\nI\n\nA third strategy, which is employed within Kantian ethics, is to argue\nthat respect for persons logically entails respect for nonpersons. For\nexample, one can argue that rational nature is to be respected not\nonly by respecting humanity in someone\u2019s person but also by\nrespecting things that bear certain relations to rational nature, for\nexample, by being fragments of it or necessary conditions of it.\nRespect would thus be owed to humans who are not persons and to\nanimals and other sentient beings (Foreman 2017; Rocha 2015; Wood\n1998). Another strategy argues against Kant that we can both\nacknowledge that rational moral agents have the highest moral standing\nand worth and are owed maximal respect, and also maintain that other\nbeings have lesser but still morally significant standing or worth and\nso deserve less but still some respect. So, although it is always\nwrong to use moral agents merely as means, it may be justifiable to\nuse nonpersons as means (for example, to do research on human embryos\nor kill animals for food) provided their moral worth is also\nrespectfully acknowledged (Meyer and Nelson, 2001). Much philosophical\nwork has been done, particularly in environmental ethics, to determine\nthe practical implications of the claim that things other than persons\nare owed respect (e.g., Corral 2015; Foreman 2015; Schmidtz 2011;\nBognar 2011; Connolly 2006; Wiggins 2000; Westra 1989).\n4. Self-Respect\n\nWhile there is much controversy about respect for persons and other\nthings, there is surprising agreement among moral and political\nphilosophers about at least this much concerning respect for oneself:\nself-respect is something of great importance in everyday life.\nIndeed, it is regarded both as morally required and as essential to\nthe ability to live a satisfying, meaningful, flourishing life\u2014a\nlife worth living\u2014and just as vital to the quality of our lives\ntogether. Saying that a person has no self-respect or acts in a way no\nself-respecting person would act, or that a social institution\nundermines the self-respect of some people, is generally a strong\nmoral criticism. Nevertheless, as with respect itself, there is\nphilosophical disagreement, both real and merely apparent, about the\nnature, scope, grounds, and requirements of self-respect. Self-respect\nis often defined as a sense of worth or as due respect for oneself; it\nhas been analyzed in various ways: it is treated as a moral duty\nconnected with the duty to respect all persons, as something to which\nall persons have a right and which it would be unjust to undermine, as\na moral virtue essential to morally good living, and as something one\nearns by living up to demanding standards. Self-respect is frequently\n(but not always correctly) identified with or compared to self-esteem,\nself-confidence, dignity, self-love, a sense of honor, self-reliance,\npride, and it is contrasted (but not always correctly) with servility,\nshame, humility, self-abnegation, arrogance, self-importance.\nUnderstanding how, if at all, self-respect is connected with and\ndifferent from these other attitudes and stances is important to\nhaving a good understanding of self-respect and the other things.\n\nIn addition to the questions philosophers have addressed about respect\nin general, other questions have been of particular concern to those\ninterested in self-respect, such as: (1) What is self-respect, and how\nis it connected to or different from related notions such as\nself-esteem, self-confidence, pride, and so on? How are respect for\npersons and respect for oneself alike and unalike? (2) How is\nself-respect related to such things as moral rights, virtue, autonomy,\nintegrity, and identity? (3) Is there a moral duty to respect\nourselves as there is a duty to recognition respect others? (4) Are\nthere objective conditions\u2014for example, moral standards or\ncorrect judgments\u2014that a person must meet in order to have\nself-respect, or is self-respect a subjective phenomenon that gains\nsupport from any sort of self-valuing without regard to correctness or\nmoral acceptability? (5) Does respecting oneself conceptually entail\nor causally require or lead to respecting other persons (or anything\nelse)? And how are respect for other persons and respect for oneself\nalike and unalike? (6) What features of an individual\u2019s\npsychology and experience, what aspects of the social context, and\nwhat modes of interactions with others support or undermine\nself-respect? (7) Are social institutions and practices to be judged\njust or unjust (at least in part) by how they affect self-respect? Can\nconsiderations of self-respect help us to better understand the nature\nand wrongness of injustices such as oppression and to determine\neffective and morally appropriate ways to resist or end them?\n4.1 The concept of self-respect\n\nSelf-respect is a form of self-regard, a moral relation of persons\n(and only persons) to themselves that concerns their own important\nworth. Self-respect is thus essentially a valuing form of respect. It\nis, moreover, a normative stance--it is due regard for\noneself, proper regard for the dignity of one\u2019s person\nor position (as the O.E.D. puts it). Like respect for others,\nself-respect is a complex of multilayered and interpenetrating\nphenomena; it involves all those aspects of cognition, valuation,\naffect, expectation, motivation, action, and reaction that compose a\nmode of being in the world at the heart of which is an appropriate\nappreciation of oneself as having significant worth. Unlike some forms\nof respect, self-respect is not something one has only now and again\nor that might have no effect on its object. Rather, self-respect has\nto do with the structure and attunement of an individual\u2019s\nidentity and of her life, and it reverberates throughout the self,\naffecting the configuration and constitution of the person\u2019s\nthoughts, desires, values, emotions, commitments, dispositions, and\nactions. As expressing or constituting one\u2019s sense of worth, it\nincludes an engaged understanding of one\u2019s worth, as well as a\ndesire and disposition to protect and preserve it. Accounts of\nself-respect differ in their characterizations of the beliefs,\ndesires, affects, and behaviors that are constitutive of it, chiefly\nbecause of differences concerning both the aspects or conception of\nthe self insofar as it is the object of one\u2019s respect and also\nthe nature and grounds of the worth of the self or aspects of the\nself.\n\nMost theorists agree that as there are different kinds of respect, so\nthere are different kinds of self-respect. However, we clearly cannot\napply all kinds of respect to ourselves: it makes no sense to talk of\ndirective respect for oneself, for instance, and although one might\nregard oneself or some of one\u2019s characteristics as obstacles\n(\u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy\u201d), this would not generally\nbe considered a form of self-respect. Because the notion of self-worth\nis the organizing motif for self-respect, and because in the dominant\nWestern tradition two kinds of worth are ascribed to persons, two\nkinds of self-respect can be distinguished.\n\nOne way of expressing the distinction is to focus on the kinds of\nself-worth around which it is oriented. One kind of worth has to do\nwith what the individual is: occupant of a social role, member of a\ncertain class, group, or people, someone with a certain place in a\nsocial hierarchy, or simply a human person. Kantian dignity is one\nform, but not the only form, of this kind of worth. Such status- or\nidentity-grounded worth entails both entitlements to due treatment\nfrom others and responsibilities for the individual in virtue of being\nthe kind of thing that is rightly the object of respect.\nRecognition self-respect centers on this kind of worth. (Bird\ncalls this \u201centitlement self-respect\u201d (Bird 2010);\nSchemmel calls it \u201cstanding self-respect\u201d (Schemmel\n2019)). The censuring question, \u201cHave you no\nself-respect?\u201d, the phrase \u201cNo self-respecting person\nwould ...,\u201d and the idea that everyone has a right to\nself-respect concern recognition self-respect. Another kind of\nself-respect depends not on what one is but on the kind of person one\nis making of oneself, on the extent to which one\u2019s character and\nconduct meet standards of worthiness. Evaluative self-respect\nhas to do with this second kind of worth, an acquired worth that we\ncan call \u201cmerit,\u201d which is based on the quality of\none\u2019s character and conduct. (Darwall (1997) calls this\n\u201cappraisal self-respect\u201d; Bird and Schemmel call it\n\u201cstandards self-respect,\u201d since merit is a function of the\nstandards to which one holds oneself and by which one evaluates or\nappraises oneself.) We earn or lose merit, and so deserve or\ndon\u2019t deserve evaluative self-respect, through what we do or\nbecome. Although they are different, recognition self-respect and\nevaluative self-respect are related. The former involves, among other\nthings, recognizing certain norms as entailed by one\u2019s\nidentity-based worth and valuing oneself appropriately by striving to\nlive in accord with them. The latter involves regarding oneself as\nhaving merit because one is or is becoming the kind of person who does\nlive in accord with what one regards as appropriate norms or\nstandards.\n\nIndividuals have numerous identities and so worth bases for different\nforms of recognition self-respect. While self-respect based on\none\u2019s social role or position can be quite important to the\nindividual and how she lives her life as a self-respecting chef,\nrabbi, mother, teacher, Hindu, or member of the aristocracy, most\nphilosophical discussions, heavily influenced by Kant, focus on\ndignity-based respect for oneself as a person, that is, on moral\nrecognition self-respect. Recognition respect for oneself as a person,\nthen, involves living in light of an understanding and appreciation of\noneself as having dignity and moral status just in virtue of being a\nperson, and of the moral constraints that arise from that dignity and\nstatus. All persons are morally obligated or entitled to have this\nkind of self-respect. Because the dominant Kantian conception of\npersons grounds dignity in three things\u2014equality, agency, and\nindividuality\u2014we can further distinguish three kinds of\nrecognition self-respect. The first is respect for oneself as a person\namong persons, as a member of the moral community with a status and\ndignity equal to every other person (see, for example, Thomas 1983a;\nBoxill 1976; Hill 1973). This involves having some conception of the\nkinds of treatment from others that would count as one\u2019s due as\na person and treatment that would be degrading or beneath one\u2019s\ndignity, desiring to be regarded and treated appropriately, and\nresenting and being disposed to protest disregard and disrespectful\ntreatment. Thinking of oneself as having certain moral rights that\nothers ought not to violate is part of this kind of self-respect;\nservility (regarding oneself as the inferior of others) and arrogance\n(thinking oneself superior to others) are among its opposites.\n\nThe second kind of recognition self-respect involves an appreciation\nof oneself as an agent, a being with the ability and responsibility to\nact autonomously and value appropriately (see, for example, G. Taylor\n1985; Telfer 1968). Persons who respect themselves as agents take\ntheir responsibilities seriously, especially their responsibilities to\nlive in accord with their dignity as persons, to govern themselves\nfittingly, and to make of themselves and their lives something they\nbelieve to be good. So, self-respecting persons regard certain forms\nof acting, thinking, desiring, and feeling as befitting them as\npersons and other forms as self-debasing or shameful, and they expect\nthemselves to adhere to the former and avoid the latter. They take\ncare of themselves and seek to develop and use their talents and\nabilities in pursuit of their plans, projects, and goals. Those who\nare shameless, uncontrolled, weak-willed, self-consciously\nsycophantic, chronically irresponsible, slothfully dependent,\nself-destructive, or unconcerned with the shape and direction of their\nlives may be said to not respect themselves as agents.\n\nA third kind of recognition self-respect involves the appreciation of\nthe importance of being autonomously self-defining. One way a\nself-respecting individual does this is through having, and living in\nlight, of a normative self-conception, i.e., a conception of being and\nliving that she regards as worthy of her as the particular person she\nis. Such a self-conception both gives expression to ideals and\ncommitments that shape the individual\u2019s identity, and also\norganizes desires, choices, pursuits, and projects in ways that give\nsubstance and worth to the self. Self-respecting people hold\nthemselves to personal expectations and standards the disappointment\nof which they would regard as unworthy of them, shameful, even\ncontemptible (although they may not apply these standards to others)\n(Hill 1982). People who sell out, betray their own values, live\ninauthentic lives, let themselves be defined by others, or are\ncomplacently self-accepting lack this kind of recognition\nself-respect.\n\nTo these three Kantian kinds of recognition self-respect, we can add a\nfourth, which has to do with the fact that it is not just as abstract\nhuman beings or as agents with personal and universalizable moral\ngoals and obligations that individuals can, do, or should respect\nthemselves but also as concrete persons embedded in particular social\nstructures and occupying various social positions with status-related\nresponsibilities they must meet to be self-respecting (Middleton\n2006). This last kind also has political implications, as discussed\nbelow.\n\nEvaluative self-respect, which expresses confidence in one\u2019s\nmerit as a person, rests on an appraisal of oneself in light of the\nnormative self-conception that structures recognition self-respect.\nRecognition self-respecting persons are concerned to be the kind of\nperson they think it is good and appropriate for them to be and they\ntry to live the kind of life such a person should live. Thus, they\nhave and try to live by certain standards of worthiness by which they\nare committed to judge themselves. Indeed, they stake themselves,\ntheir value and their identities, on living in accord with these\nstandards. Because they want to know where they stand, morally, they\nare disposed to reflectively examine and evaluate their character and\nconduct in light of their normative vision of themselves. And it\nmatters to them that they are able to \u201cbear their own\nsurvey,\u201d as Hume says (1739, 620). Evaluative self-respect\ncontains the judgment that one is or is becoming the worthy kind of\nperson one seeks to be, and, more significantly, that one is not in\ndanger of becoming an unworthy kind of person (Dillon 2004).\nEvaluative self-respect holds, at the least, the judgment that one\n\u201ccomes up to scratch,\u201d as Telfer (1968) puts it. Those\nwhose conduct is unworthy or whose character is shameful by their own\nstandards do not deserve their own evaluative respect. However, people\ncan be poor self-appraisers and their standards can be quite\ninappropriate to them or to any person, and so their evaluative\nself-respect, though still subjectively satisfying, can be\nunwarranted, as can the loss or lack of it. Interestingly, although\nphilosophers have paid scant attention to evaluative respect for\nothers, significant work has been done on evaluative self-respect.\nThis may reflect an asymmetry between the two: although our evaluative\nrespect for others may have no effect on them, perhaps because we\ndon\u2019t express it or they don\u2019t value our appraisal, our\nown self-evaluation matters intensely to us and can powerfully affect\nour self-identity and the shape and structure of our lives. Indeed, an\nindividual\u2019s inability to stomach herself can profoundly\ndiminish the quality of her life, even her desire to continue\nliving.\n\nSome philosophers have contended that a third kind of self-valuing\nunderlies both recognition and evaluative self-respect. It is a more\nbasic sense of worth that enables an individual to develop the\nintellectually more sophisticated forms, a precondition for being able\nto take one\u2019s qualities or the fact that one is a person as\ngrounds of positive self-worth. It has been called \u201cbasic\npsychological security\u201d (Thomas 1989), \u201cself-love\u201d\n(Buss 1999), and \u201cbasal self-respect\u201d (Dillon 1997). Basal\nself-valuing is our most fundamental sense of ourselves as mattering\nand our primordial interpretation of self and self-worth. Strong and\nsecure basal self-respect can immunize an individual against personal\nfailing or social denigration, but damage to basal self-respect, which\ncan occur when people grow up in social, political, or cultural\nenvironments that devalue them or \u201ctheir kind,\u201d can make\nit impossible for people to properly interpret themselves and their\nself-worth, because it affects the way in which they assess reality\nand weigh reasons. Basal self-respect is thus the ground of the\npossibility of recognition and evaluative self-respect.\n\nThere are also non-deontological accounts of moral recognition\nself-respect. Utilitarians, for example, can treat self-respect as of\nparamount importance to a flourishing or happy life, and thereby\njustifying moral constraints on the treatment of others (Scarre 1992).\nSimilarly, one could give a virtue-theoretical account of recognition\nself-respect, especially the agentic form (Dillon 2015), although this\navenue has been relatively unexplored\n\nIt is common in everyday discourse and philosophical discussion to\ntreat self-respect and self-esteem as synonyms. It is evaluative\nself-respect, typically, with which self-esteem is conflated (Dillon\n2013). Evaluative self-respect and (high) self-esteem are both forms\nof positive self-regard concerned with one\u2019s worth, both involve\nhaving a favorable view of oneself in virtue of one\u2019s activities\nand personal qualities, and a person can have or lack either one\nundeservedly. Nevertheless, many philosophers have argued that the two\nattitudes are importantly different (for example, Dillon 2004, 2013;\nHarris 2001; Chazan 1998; Sachs 1981; Darwall 1977), although some\ntheorists treat the evaluative stance as a form of self-esteem\n(\u201cmortal self-esteem\u201d). The main difference between the\ntwo is that evaluative self-respect is a normative stance and\nself-esteem is not: the former calls for justification in light of\nstandards one has good reason to regard as appropriate, while the\nlatter arises from beliefs about oneself whose justification need not\nmatter to one and that need not involve standards-based\nself-assessment. Many philosophers agree that evaluative self-respect\nis morally important, which makes sense inasmuch as it is in the\nservice of the moral demands of dignity, worthy character, agency, and\none\u2019s moral commitments, and so is a motivation for morally\nappropriate living. Self-esteem--having a good opinion of oneself or\nfeeling good about oneself--is one of the most extensively studied\nphenomena in psychology and social psychology; it is generally\nregarded by social scientists as central to healthy psychological\nfunctioning and well-being, although they note that it has no\nnecessary connection to moral values, is central to such negative\nstates as narcissism, and can lead to serious disrespect of others and\nharm unless appropriately constrained (Baumeister et al 1996). (But\nsee Keshen (2017) on the value of reasonable self-esteem.) One way of\ndistinguishing evaluative self-respect and self-esteem is by their\ngrounds and the points of view from which they are appraised.\nEvaluative self-respect involves an assessment from a moral point of\nview of one\u2019s character and conduct in light of standards one\nregards as implied by one\u2019s moral worth as an agent and a\nperson. Self-esteem, as popularly and scientifically understood, is\nbased both on whatever qualities or activities one prizes or thinks\nothers prize, and on the esteem one believes one gets from others\nwhose esteem one values. It does not essentially concern morally\nsignificant worth, appropriate self-valuing, or self-assessment from a\nmoral point of view, and it can be based on features wholly unrelated\nto or even opposed to good character. For example, one can have a good\nopinion of oneself in virtue of being a good joke-teller or for having\nwon an important sports competition and yet not think one is a good\nperson because of it (Darwall 1977). And depending on what serves\none\u2019s psychological needs or suits one\u2019s companions, one\ncan derive high self-esteem from successful thuggery as from being\nhonest and kind. To have self-esteem is to feel good about oneself; to\nhave evaluative self-respect is to feel justified, to be able to hold\none\u2019s head up, look others in the eye, face oneself in the\nmirror. Another way of distinguishing them focuses on what it is to\nlose them: to lose evaluative respect for oneself is to find oneself\nto be shameful, contemptible, or intolerable; to lose self-esteem is\nto think less well of oneself, to be downcast because one believes one\nlacks qualities that would add to one\u2019s luster (Harris 2001) or\nthat others think less well of one.\n\nSelf-respect is also often identified with pride, although the two are\nrather different (Morton 2017). Just as there are different kinds of\nself-respect so, there are different kinds of pride, which are\ncomplexly related. In one sense, pride is the pleasure or satisfaction\ntaken in one\u2019s achievements, possessions, or associations; this\nkind of pride can be an affective element of either evaluative\nself-respect or self-esteem. In another sense, pride is inordinate\nself-esteem or vanity, an excessively high opinion of one\u2019s\nqualities, accomplishments, or status that can make one arrogant and\ncontemptuous of others. This kind of pride contrasts with both\nwell-grounded evaluative self-respect and the interpersonal kind of\nmoral recognition self-respect. But pride can also be a claim to and\ncelebration of a status worth or to equality with others, especially\nother groups (for example, Black Pride), which is interpersonal\nrecognition self-respect (Thomas 1993a, 1978\u201379). Pride can also be\n\u201cproper pride,\u201d which is a sense of one\u2019s dignity\nthat prevents one from doing what is unworthy; this is the agentic\ndimension of recognition self-respect. Pride\u2019s opposites, shame\nand humility, are also closely related to self-respect. A loss of\nevaluative self-respect may be expressed in shame, but shameless\npeople manifest a lack of recognition self-respect; and although\nhumiliation can diminish or undermine recognition self-respect and\nevaluative self-respect, humility is an appropriate dimension of the\nevaluative self-respect of any imperfect person.\n\nOne issue with which contemporary philosophers have been concerned is\nwhether self-respect is an objective concept or a subjective one. If\nit is the former, then there are certain beliefs, attitudes, and\ndispositions a person must have to be self-respecting. A person who\nthought of herself as a lesser sort of being whose interests and\nwell-being are less important than those of others would not count as\nhaving moral recognition self-respect, no matter how appropriate she\nregards her stance. If self-respect is a subjective concept, then a\nperson counts as having self-respect if, for example, she believes she\nis not tolerating treatment she regards as unworthy or behaving in\nways she thinks is beneath her, regardless of whether her judgments\nabout herself are accurate or her standards or sense of what she is\ndue are judged by others to be reasonable or worthy (Massey 1983a).\nPsychologists, for whom \u201cself-esteem\u201d is the term of\npractice, tend to regard the various dimensions of a person\u2019s\nsense of worth as subjective. Many philosophers treat the\ninterpersonal dimension of recognition self-respect objectively, and\nit is generally thought that having manifestly inaccurate beliefs\nabout oneself is good grounds for at least calling an\nindividual\u2019s sense of worth unjustified or compromised (Meyers\n1989). But there is no consensus regarding the standards to which\nindividuals hold themselves and by which they judge themselves, and\ncertainly the standards of the self-defining dimension of moral\nrecognition self-respect are inescapably, though perhaps not\nexclusively, subjective. Complicating the objective/subjective\ndistinction, however, is the fact of the social construction of\nself-respect. What it is to be a person or to have a status worthy of\nrespect, what treatment and conduct are appropriate to a person or one\nwith such a status, what forms of life and character have\nmerit\u2014all of these are given different content in different\nsociocultural contexts. Individuals necessarily, though perhaps not\ninalterably, learn to engage with themselves and with issues of\nself-worth in the terms and modes of the sociocultural conceptions in\nwhich they have been immersed. And different kinds of individuals may\nbe given different opportunities in different sociocultural contexts\nto acquire or develop the grounds of the different kinds of\nself-respect (Dillon 2021, 1997; Moody-Adams 1992\u201393; Meyers\n1989; Thomas 1983b). Even fully justified self-respect may thus be\nless than strongly objective and more than simply subjective.\n4.2 Treatment of self-respect in moral and political philosophy\n\nSelf-respect is frequently appealed to as a means of justifying a wide\nvariety of philosophical claims or positions, generally in arguments\nof the form: x promotes (or undermines) self-respect;\ntherefore, x is to that extent to be morally approved (or\nobjected to). For example, appeals to self-respect have been used to\nargue for, among many other things, the value of moral rights\n(Feinberg 1970), moral requirements or limits regarding forgiving\nothers or oneself (Dillon 2001; Holmgren 1998, 1993; Novitz 1998;\nHaber 1991; Murphy 1982), and both the rightness and wrongness of\npractices such as affirmative action. Such arguments rely on rather\nthan establish the moral importance of self-respect. Most philosophers\nwho attend to self-respect tend to treat it as important in one of two\nways, which are exemplified in the very influential work of Kant and\nJohn Rawls.\n\nKant argues that, just as we have a moral duty to respect others as\npersons, so we have a moral duty to respect ourselves as persons, a\nduty that derives from our dignity as rational beings. This duty\nrequires us to act always in an awareness of our dignity and so to act\nonly in ways that are consistent with our status as ends in ourselves\nand to refrain from acting in ways that abase, degrade, defile, or\ndisavow our rational nature. That is, we have a duty of moral\nrecognition self-respect. In The Metaphysics of Morals\n(1797), Kant argues for specific duties to oneself generated by the\ngeneral duty to respect humanity in our persons, including duties to\nnot engage in suicide, misuse of our sexual powers, drunkenness and\nother unrestrained indulgence of inclination, lying, self-deception,\navarice, and servility. Kant also maintains that the duty of\nself-respect is the most important moral duty, for unless there were\nduties to respect oneself, there could be no moral duties at all.\nMoreover, fulfilling our duty to respect ourselves is a necessary\ncondition of fulfilling our duties to respect other persons. Kant\nmaintains that we are always aware of our dignity as persons and so of\nour moral obligation to respect ourselves, and he identifies this\nawareness as a feeling of reverential respect for ourselves. This is\none of the natural capacities of feeling which we could have no duty\nto acquire but that make it possible for us to be motivated by the\nthought of duty. Reverence for self is, along with \u201cmoral\nfeeling,\u201d conscience, and love of others, a subjective source of\nmorality, and it is the motivational ground of the duty of\nself-respect. Kant also discusses evaluative self-respect, especially\nin Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and his Lectures\non Ethics (1779), as a combination of noble pride, which is the\nawareness that we have honored and preserved our dignity by acting in\nmorally worthy ways, and a healthy dose of humility, which is the\nawareness that we inevitably fall short of the lofty requirements of\nthe moral law. Kant regards well-grounded evaluative self-respect as a\nsubjective motivation to continue striving to do right and be\ngood.\n\nRawls, by contrast, views self-respect neither as something we are\nmorally required to have and maintain nor as a feeling we necessarily\nhave, but as an entitlement that social institutions are required by\njustice to support and not undermine. In A Theory of Justice\n(1971) he argues that self-respect (which he sometimes calls\n\u201cself-esteem\u201d is a \u201cprimary good,\u201d something\nthat rational beings want whatever else they want, because it is vital\nboth to the experienced quality of individual lives and to the ability\nto carry out or achieve whatever projects or aims an individual might\nhave. It is, moreover, a social good, one that individuals are able to\nacquire only under certain social and political conditions. Rawls\ndefines self-respect as including \u201ca person\u2019s sense of his\nown value, his secure conviction that his conception of the good, his\nplan of life, is worth carrying out,\u201d and it implies \u201ca\nconfidence in one\u2019s ability, so far as it is within one\u2019s\npower, to fulfill one\u2019s intentions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 440). He\nargues that individuals\u2019 access to self-respect is to a large\ndegree a function of how the basic institutional structure of a\nsociety defines and distributes the social bases of self-respect,\nwhich include the messages about the relative worth of citizens that\nare conveyed in the structure and functioning of institutions, the\ndistribution of fundamental political rights and civil liberties,\naccess to the resources individuals need to pursue their plans of\nlife, the availability of diverse associations and communities within\nwhich individuals can seek affirmation of their worth and their plans\nof life from others, and the norms governing public interaction among\ncitizens. Since self-respect is vital to individual well-being, Rawls\nargues that justice requires that social institutions and policies be\ndesigned to support and not undermine self-respect. Rawls argues that\nthe principles of justice as fairness are superior to utilitarian\nprinciples insofar as they better affirm and promote self-respect for\nall citizens.\n\nRawls\u2019s view that the ability of individuals to respect\nthemselves is heavily dependent on their social and political\ncircumstances has been echoed by a number of theorists working in\nmoral, social, and political philosophy. For example, Margalit (1996)\nargues that a decent society is one whose institutions do not\nhumiliate people, that is, give people good reason to consider their\nself-respect to be injured (but see Bird 2010). Honneth\u2019s theory\nof social criticism (1995) focuses on the way people\u2019s\nself-respect and self-identity necessarily depend on the recognition\nof others and so are vulnerable to being misrecognized or ignored both\nby social institutions and in interpersonal interactions. Some\ntheorists have used the concept of self-respect to examine the\noppression of women, people of color, gays and lesbians, and other\ngroups that are marginalized, stigmatized, or exploited by the\ndominant culture, identifying the plethora of ways in which oppressive\ninstitutions, images, and actions can do damage to the self-respect of\nmembers of these groups. Other writers discuss ways that individuals\nand groups might preserve or restore self-respect in the face of\ninjustice or oppression, and the ways in which the development of\nself-respect in individuals living under oppression or injustice\nempowers them to participate in the monumental struggles for justice\nand liberation (for example, Babbitt 2000, 1993; Bartky 1990a, 1990b,\n1990c; Basevich 2022; Boxill 1992, 1976; Boxill and Boxill 2015;\nCollins 1990; Dillon 2021, 1997, 1995; Diller 2001; Hay 2013, 2011;\nHolberg 2017; Ikuenobe 2004; Khader 2021; Meyers 1989, 1986; Mohr\n1992, 1988; Moody-Adams 1992\u201393; Seglow 2016; Statman 2002;\nThomas 2001b, 1983a, 1978\u201379; Weber 2016). Some theorists,\nespecially those working within a feminist framework, have argued that\nthe prevailing conceptions of self-respect in Kantian theory or in\ncontemporary liberal societies themselves contain features that\nreflect objectionable aspects of the dominating culture, and they have\nattempted to reconceive self-respect in ways that are more conducive\nto empowerment and emancipation (for example, Borgwald 2012, Dillon\n1992c).\n\nIn moral philosophy, theorists have also focused on connections\nbetween self-respect and various virtues and vices, such as self-trust\n(Borgwald 2012; Govier 1993), justice (Bloomfield 2011), honesty\n(Mauri 2011), benevolence (Andrew 2011), humility (Dillon 2020, 2015;\nGrenberg 2010), self-forgiveness (Dillon 2001; Holmgren 1998; Novitz\n1998), self-improvement (Johnson 2011), general immorality (Bagnoli\n2009; Bloomfield 2008), and arrogance (Dillon 2022, 2021, 2015, 2007,\n2003).\n5. Conclusion\n\nEveryday discourse and practices insist that respect and self-respect\nare personally, socially, politically, and morally important, and\nphilosophical discussions of the concepts bear this out. Their roles\nin our lives as individuals, as people living in complex relations\nwith other people and surrounded by a plethora of other beings and\nthings on which our attitudes and actions have tremendous effects,\ncannot, as these discussions reveal, be taken lightly. The discussions\nthus far shed light on the nature and significance of the various\nforms of respect and self-respect and their positions in a nexus of\nprofoundly important but philosophically challenging and contestable\nconcepts. These discussions also reveal that more work remains to be\ndone in clarifying these attitudes and their places among and\nimplications for our concepts and our lives.\n",
