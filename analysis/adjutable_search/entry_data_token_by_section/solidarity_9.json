Challenges to Solidarity\n\nTurning to criticisms of solidarity in this section, we start by\ndistinguishing different kinds of criticism along different\ndimensions. Perhaps most importantly, one must distinguish between, on\nthe one hand, challenges to solidarity as a social practice (or a\nrange of social practices), and, on the other hand, criticism of\ntheories of solidarity. We will call criticisms of the former kind\n\u201cpractical challenges\u201d to solidarity and will address\nthose of the latter kind as \u201ctheoretical challenges\u201d.\nPractical and theoretical challenges are clearly independent of each\nother. For example, one can think that we need a clear account of what\nsolidarity is, even if one holds that solidarity practices have, on\nthe whole, negative consequences for political life.\n\nTheoretical challenges to solidarity can conceivably take\nmany forms, but we will focus here on the related charges of\nconceptual incoherence and theoretical redundancy.\nThe former challenge is that uses of solidarity, both common sense and\nphilosophical, are simply too diffuse and incoherent to allow for any\nadequate and theoretically productive definition. If those using the\nconcept of solidarity in political or philosophical debate are more\nlikely than not to misunderstand or speak past each other, then we\nshould not use the concept. The latter challenge is that, from a\ntheoretical standpoint, we don\u2019t need to add solidarity to the\nfundamental philosophical concepts in the discipline because we can\nhave everything we want by reflecting on alternative concepts and\ntheories that have already been more thoroughly developed, for example\njustice, community, or equality.\n\nWhen it comes to practical challenges to solidarity, critics\nargue that solidarity tends to have negative consequences and that,\ntherefore, we should not promote it. We can further differentiate\nthese practical challenges in terms of, first, the kind of negative\nconsequences that are attributed to solidarity and, second, the kind\nof solidarity practices that are judged to be vulnerable to this\nchallenge. In relation to the former, the most prominent criticisms\nconcern solidarity\u2019s impact on the realization of other\nimportant social and political values. One historically important line\nof criticism to solidarity argues that solidarity threatens\nliberty (Arendt, Shklar, Kateb). Others worry that solidarity\ncreates unfair forms of inequality between those within a solidary\ngroup and those who are excluded (Scheffler 2001). Whilst the\ncriticism focus on negative effects on outsiders, critics have also\nargued that solidarity may have negative effects on participants.\nPerhaps most notably, some have claimed that solidarity stymies\npluralism and diversity. A related but distinct\nworry is that solidarity promotes\u2014or perhaps even\nrequires\u2014false beliefs and self-conceptions amongst participants\n(Margalit 2017; Shelby forthcoming).\n\nBefore we move on to specific arguments, a point about generality: We\nmaintain that, for a criticism to amount to a \u201cchallenge\u201d\nto solidarity, it must rise to a certain level of generality, i.e., it\nmust apply to a range of accounts of solidarity.\n",
