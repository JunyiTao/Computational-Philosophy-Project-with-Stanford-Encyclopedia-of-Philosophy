    "main_text": "Philosophical Influences\n3. Philosophical Influences\n\nThe philosophical content of the Vita nuova is minimal, a\nskeletal version of contemporary faculty psychology and a few brief\nreferences to metaphysics. But while finding his orientation as a\npoet, Dante was also engaged in the study of philosophy and, according\nto his own testimony in the Convivio, \u201cstarted going to\nwhere she [philosophy] was truly revealed, in the schools of the\nreligious orders and at the disputations of the philosophers\u201d\n[Conv. 2.12.7]. Dante does not provide any additional details\nthat reveal specifically where he studied philosophy, but in Florence\nin the early 1290s, there were three schools of religious orders at\nwhich he may have studied: that of the Dominicans at Santa Maria\nNovella; that of the Franciscans at Santa Croce; and that of the\nAugustinians at Santo Spirito. Unfortunately, there are no reliable\nhistorical records concerning the course of study that may have been\navailable to Dante at Santo Spirito. However, there is reliable\ninformation about the resources that would have been available to a\nlay student at Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce.\n\nAlthough the Dominicans at Santa Maria Novella did not allow laymen to\npursue studies of philosophy specifically, Dante would have been\npermitted to attend theology classes, and in these there would almost\ncertainly have been at least indirect exposure to Aristotelian\nphilosophy [Santagata (2016), 83]. Most intriguingly, Dante may have\nhad the opportunity to attend lectures of Remigio dei Girolami (d.\n1319), who had studied theology at the University of Paris during the\ntenure of Thomas Aquinas there [Panella; Davis (1984), 198\u2013223].\nRemigio, like Dante, was a White Guelf, and, also like Dante, Remigio\nread widely in classical literature and was fond of drawing lessons in\npolitical and ethical conduct from his reading. For both Remigio and\nDante, moreover, Thomas was primarily the author of the Summa\ncontra Gentiles and the commentary on the Ethics,\nconcerned, like Aristotle himself, to demonstrate the capacities of\nhuman reason as a means to truth.\n\nThe most prestigious studia in Florence in the 1290s,\nhowever, was surely Santa Croce, which, as a Studium\ngenerale, ranked only behind the three Studia\nprincipalia of Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge in terms of\nimportance [Santagata (2016), 83]. As Santagata notes in his recent\nbiography of Dante,\n\n\nTwo great intellectuals who were readers at Santa Croce between 1287\nand 1289\u2014Pietro di Giovanni Olivi from Provence, and the younger\nUbertino da Casale\u2014played a major role in the history of the\nFranciscan movement and, more generally, in the Church. Dante could\nnot have attended their lectures since both had left Florence before\n1290, but it is always possible that he had heard some of\nUbertino\u2019s sermons. Dante never mentions Olivi, but in many\nrespects his vision of the history of the Church seems to coincide\nwith that of the Provencal theologian in its Franciscan and spiritual\ninterpretation. As for Ubertino, a leading champion of the Franciscan\n\u201cspiritual\u201d movement, namely of those who advocated a\nreturn to the rigor of Francis\u2019s rule against the permissive\ninterpretation of the so-called \u201cconventuals\u201d led by the\nminister general, Matteo d\u2019Acquasparta, Dante would have\nBonaventura da Bagnoregio say in Paradiso [12.124\u2013126]\nthat they both betrayed the rule: Matteo because he \u201cis too\nloose\u201d through permissiveness, Ubertino because he \u201cis too\nnarrow\u201d through excessive rigor. [Santagata (2016), 84]\n\n\nBeyond these possibilities in Florence, Dante\u2019s testimony in\nConvivio 2.12.7 that he had attended the \u201cdisputations\nof the philosophers\u201d may hint at some degree of exposure to the\nstudy of philosophy in Bologna in this period of his life.\nUnfortunately, there is a gap of a little more than two years in the\nrecord of Dante\u2019s life between September 1291 and March 1294,\nand it is only possible to speculate on whether Dante was able to\navail himself of the possibilities of studying philosophical subjects\nthat would not have been accessible to him in the more constrained\nlandscape of the monastic libraries and studiae of\nFlorence.\n\nWherever it may have been that Dante acquired his familiarity with\nphilosophy and theology, his writings offer ample evidence of wide\nranging interests, if not deep expertise about each and every subject\nthat is touched on in them. In particular, Dante cites a dozen works\nof Aristotle, apparently at first hand, and displays a particularly\nintimate knowledge of the Ethics, largely derived, no doubt,\nfrom Thomas Aquinas. But his Aristotelianism was nourished by other\nsources as well. Bruno Nardi has argued persuasively that his attitude\ntoward the study of philosophy also owes a great deal to the more\neclectic Albert the Great [Nardi (1967); 63\u201372; (1992),\n28\u201329; Vasoli (1995b); Gilson (2004)]. In Albert, in particular,\nDante would have encountered a wide-ranging encyclopedism that\nincluded original work, experimental and theoretical, in natural\nscience, and treated Aristotelian natural philosophy and psychology in\nthe light of Islamic philosophers (notably Avicenna and Averroes) and\nGreco-Arab neo-Platonic sources such as the Liber de Causis,\nas well as the Christian neo-Platonist tradition of Pseudo-Dionysius.\nAlbert aimed to discover Aristotle\u2019s own meaning, with the help\nof Greek and Arab commentators who led him into disagreement with\nother Latini, including at certain points his pupil Thomas,\nand he asserts more than once that philosophy and theology are\nseparate spheres of knowledge. It is tempting to imagine that this\nwillingness to pursue philosophy on its own terms appealed to Dante,\nwhose Convivio and Monarchia also sought to\ndistinguish philosophical and religious knowledge without simply\nsubordinating the former to the latter.\n\nAlbert\u2019s view of the procession of the universe from the\n\u201csubstantial light\u201d of the divine intellect through the\noperation of a hierarchy of lesser intelligences is also clearly\nperceptible in Dante\u2019s treatment of the cosmic\nintelligenze or sostanze separate in the\nConvivio [Conv. 2.4\u20135; Nardi (1992),\n47\u201362]. It shows up again in his treatment of the growth of the\nhuman embryo, which seems to imply, not a sequence of animations by\nnutritive, sensitive and intellective powers, as for Thomas, but the\ncontinuous operation of a single virtus formativa, whose\noperation Albert compares to that of the prima intelligentia\nin the soul [De intellectu & intelligibili 2.2], and\nwhich is responsible not only for the development of the human\ncreature but for effecting its union with an essentially external\nanima intellectiva [Boyde (1981), 270\u201379; Nardi (1960),\n9\u201368; (1967), 67\u201370].\n\nAlbert is thus a likely conduit for seemingly Averroist elements in\nDante\u2019s thought. He regards intellectual activity as the\noperation of the intellectus agens, through which the human\nsoul is illumined by the divine Intelligence. Each soul possesses its\nown intellect, but this intellect is a \u201creflection\u201d\n(resultatio) of the light of the primal mind, which thus, in\neffect, becomes itself the true agent intellect. Albert explicitly\nrejects the Averroist view of the active intellect as itself a\ncelestial intelligence, a single, separate substance which actualizes\nin the passive intellect phantasms supplied by individual human minds.\nBut he nevertheless also argues that only an intellect universal in\nnature can produce an understanding of universal forms. The intellect\nand the soul of which it is a function thus partake of the character\nof the separate intelligences. Soul is not the actualizing essence of\nthe human creature, as in Thomas, but is related to body through the\nmediation of its organic faculties. In itself, through its agent\nintellect, the soul is drawn to contemplate the intelligences which\norder the universe at large, is informed by them with the transcendent\nknowledge they manifest, and finally \u201cstands\u201d in the\ndivine intellect. In this way, certain men are enabled to fulfill the\ninnate human desire for understanding and attain a natural beatitude,\n\u201csubstantiated and formed in the divine being\u201d [Albert,\nDe intellectu & intelligibili 2.2\u201312; Nardi (1960),\n145\u201350].\n\nThat this fulfillment is attained through natural understanding, with\nno recourse to the theology of grace and revelation, marks a crucial\ndifference between Albert and Thomas, who devotes several chapters of\nthe Summa contra gentiles to a forceful refutation of the\nnotion that final happiness as defined by Aristotle is possible in\nthis life [SCG 3.37\u201348]. For Thomas the desire to know is one\nand the same at all levels, and philosophy, seeking the causes of\nthings, is ultimately \u201cordered entirely to the knowing of\nGod\u201d [SCG 3.25.9] Dante\u2019s own position on this question is\ndifficult to define precisely. The poet of the Paradiso is at\none with Thomas on the value of philosophy as consisting finally in\nits power to prepare the mind for faith [Par. 4.118\u201332;\n29.13\u201345], but he shares Albert\u2019s fascination with natural\nunderstanding, and in earlier writings his willingness to grant\nphilosophy a \u201cbeatitude\u201d of its own hints at a latent\ndualism in his thought [Foster (1965), 51\u201371; (1977),\n193\u2013208; de Libera (1991), 333\u201336]. How far this reflects\nhis responsiveness to neo-Platonism as mediated by Albert or in such\nworks as the Liber de causis is hard to determine. Nardi, who\nargued successfully for seeing Dante as an eclectic thinker [Diomedi\n(2005), 1\u201323], stressed the importance of the Liber de\nCausis. But the Platonizing strain in Dante\u2019s thinking\nsurely involves more than simply the influence of Albert or interest\nin the Liber de Causis, and other scholars have noted\nDante\u2019s likely indebtedness to the encyclopedism of\ntwelfth-century thinkers like Bernardus Silvestris and Alan of Lille,\npoet-philosophers whose world view, inherited from late-antique\nNeoplatonism, was defined by the Liberal Arts and the cosmology of\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus [Vasoli (1995a, 2008); Garin (1976),\n64\u201370; Stabile (2007), 173\u201393]. In Bernardus\u2019\nCosmographia and Alan\u2019s Anticlaudianus, the\nunfolding of the secrets of nature by the enquiring mind generates an\nallegory of intellectual pilgrimage toward truth. Dante\u2019s\nexperience of philosophy, though defined in more dynamic and\nsophisticated terms, is a version of the same journey. The experience\nof love becomes a means to self-realization, and an awareness of the\nhierarchy of forces operative in the universe at large, which makes\npossible an ascensus mentis ad sapientiam, to that\n\u201camoroso uso della sapienza\u201d that enables the\nhuman mind to participate in the divine.\n\nOn the other hand, recent studies have argued that Nardi, in his zeal\nto free Dante from the constraints of the orthodox Thomism that\nscholars like Pierre Mandonnet and Giovanni Busnelli claimed to find\nin him, exaggerates the neo-Platonist strain in his thinking\n[Maier\u00f9 (2004), 128\u201335; Stabile (2007), 359\u201370;\nIannucci (1997); Moevs (2005), 17\u201335]. Moreover, Dante was\nsurely also aware of and influenced in some manner by a\n\u201cradical\u201d Aristotelianism centered in Bologna, where\nmasters influenced by Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia were\naffirming the autonomy of human reason and its capacity to attain\nhappiness through its own powers [Corti (1981), 9\u201331; Vanni\nRovighi]. Indeed, a number of textual and biographical clues have also\nbeen interpreted as pointing toward a more heterodox dimension in\nDante\u2019s thinking. In short, the question of the influence of\nLatin Averroism on Dante\u2019s philosophical views has remained an\nactive subject of debate among Dante scholars [see esp., Fortin\n(2002); Ardizzone (2014 and 2016); Ziolkowski (2014a); Stone (2006)].\nStill, many of these thinkers were also following paths first taken by\nAlbert, and it is possible that Albert\u2019s influence, together\nwith that of Thomas, is sufficient to account for many of the most\ndistinctive features of Dante\u2019s use of philosophy [Imbach\n(1996b), 399\u2013413].\n",
