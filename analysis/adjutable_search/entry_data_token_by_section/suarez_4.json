    "main_text": "The Metaphysical Disputations || Final Causation\n2.4 Final Causation\n\nIn offering his spirited and protracted defense of substantial forms,\nand of formal causation more generally, Su\u00e1rez shows himself\naware of the need to articulate and defend core features of his\nbroadly Aristotelian framework, including some which later came in for\nharsh criticism. Indeed, in the case of substantial forms, these\ncriticisms were finding voice already during his lifetime; he was, for\ninstance, an older contemporary of Descartes (b. 1596), who was twenty\nyears old when Su\u00e1rez died in 1617. Descartes simply reports\nwithout argument that substantial forms are \u201ca philosophical\nbeing unknown to me\u201d (Letter to Morin, 12 September 1638;\nDescartes 1984: 122). Because he is alert to such concerns, and\naddresses them directly, Su\u00e1rez appears to many historians of\nphilosophy as a sort of bridge figure between scholastic and early\nmodern philosophy. That may or may not be so, depending on the\nprinciples of periodization presupposed by those offering this sort of\njudgment. What is clearly true, however, is that he very often\ndevelops Aristotelian theses in a manner betraying a willingness to\nabandon those features of Aristotelianism which were to come in for\nthe harshest treatment by philosophers subsequent to him.\n\nOne such thesis pertains to his attitude towards teleological\ncausation. He endorses its centrality to his framework, but recognizes\nthat it requires articulation and defense. In the Metaphysical\nDisputations it receives both:\n\n\nAlthough a final cause is in a certain way more eminent than all\nothers and even prior [to them], its nature of causing is,\nnevertheless, more obscure and for that reason was almost entirely\nunknown to the ancient philosophers\u2026 For this reason \u2026\nin order to explain this more thoroughly and to resolve the\ndifficulties, it should first be inquired as to whether an end is a\ncause, then in what manner and what it causes, and also how many kinds\nof ends there are and what the nature of causing is for each one of\nthem (DM XXIII 1.1)\n\n\nHere, as elsewhere, Su\u00e1rez shows himself to be aware of many of\nthe sorts of problem that came to form the basis for the widespread\nrejection of teleological causation. Whether this redounds to his\ncredit, given his affirmation of their centrality to causation in\ngeneral, is an independent question.\n\nWe find him wondering expressly whether we are right to call the final\ncause a cause at all:\n\n\nBut that any whichever of these is a true cause can easily be proven\nindeed in the case of material, formal, and efficient [causes], for\nany whatever of these manifestly inflows some being\u2026 But\nconcerning the final cause there can be some reason for doubting,\nsince no real being is presupposed in it by which it could cause\n(De fine vero potest esse nonnulla dubitandi ratio, quia nullum\nesse reale in eo praesupponitur, quo causare possit: DM\nXIII 3.3)\n\n\nThe worry, according to Su\u00e1rez is that the final cause perhaps\nhas no \u201creal being\u201d (esse reale), in which case\nit could not enter into any kind of causal relation. In so speaking,\nhe is not just saying in a colorful way that perhaps the final cause\ndoes not exist, but rather that it is perhaps a mere fictum,\nthat possibly all of our appeals to final causation are merely\nconvenient fictions, able in principle to be replaced by appeals to\nother kinds of cause, those with real being, like efficient causes. If\nPonce de Le\u00f3n travelled to Florida in order to find the\nFountain of Youth, that is well and good; but the Fountain of Youth\ndoes not exist\u2014it has no esse reale\u2014and so\nit hardly caused him to do anything at all.\n\nIn more detail, Su\u00e1rez offers six distinct worries about final\ncausation (DM XXIII 1.1\u20136): (i) Every cause is a\nprincipium, but no end is a principium; hence, no\nend is a cause of any kind; (ii) every cause infuses being\n(influit esse) into its effect; no end does so; hence, no end\nis a cause: (iii) a form is an end; if an end were a real cause, form\nwould thus have to cause itself; nothing causes itself; hence the end\nis not a real cause; (iv) if an end is real cause, then it is also a\nmoving principle, and no end is a moving principle; hence, no end is a\ncause; (v) natural agents (here Su\u00e1rez is thinking of elements\nand beasts) have determinate propensities; the postulation of ends for\nbeings with determinate propensities is idle; hence, the postulation\nof final causes for natural agents lacks sufficient foundation; (vi)\none cannot specify what or in relation to what (quid vel circa\nquid) a final cause causes; if not, then a final cause does not\nimpart motion; hence, a final cause is not a cause.\n\nIn different ways, these objections call into question the status of\nthe final cause as cause. Some of them directly anticipate and address\nthe sorts of considerations which came to dominate later, often\ncaustic rejections of final causation.\n\nBe that as it may, Su\u00e1rez roundly affirms final causation. It\nis noteworthy, however, that he does so by offering significant\nconcessions to what came to be the textbook rejections of final\ncausation:\n\n\nAlthough the end is last in execution, nevertheless it is first in\nintention and under that aspect has the true nature of a principle.\nMoreover, the principle is not a fictum but is true and real\n(verum et reale), since it truly excites and moves. Hence,\njust as it has sufficient being by which it can exercise the sort of\nnature a principle has, so also it has the nature of a cause\n(DM XII 3.3).\n\n\nThe endorsement is clear. The concession comes in the phrases\n\u201cfirst in intention\u201d (primum in intentione) and\n\u201cunder that aspect\u201d (sub ea ratione), where\nSu\u00e1rez allows that a final cause qualifies as a cause only\nbecause and to the degree that it is conceived by an intentional\nagent. This, then, removes final causation from the realm of\nnon-intentional nature, even while affirming that final causes play an\nineliminable role in psychological explanation, particularly as\nregards intentional action.\n\nIn a positive vein, Su\u00e1rez argues on behalf of final causes by\nmeans of a simple counterfactual argument. One might say, for\ninstance, that someone made a journey to the store in order to buy\nmilk. The buying of milk, then, is the final cause of that\njourney. If it were discovered that store had unfortunately run out of\nmilk, then, suggests Su\u00e1rez, the milk, or the buying of the\nmilk, would remain the final cause of the action all the same;\notherwise there would have been no journey. To the rejoinder that the\nactual cause was not the milk, but the agent's desire to buy\nmilk, coupled with her belief that milk was to be had at the store,\nSu\u00e1rez readily agrees\u2014but then insists that the desire\nwould not be the desire it was were it not a desire for buying\nmilk. He contends, in other words, that the identity conditions\nof any desire to buy milk derive from the end, which is to say that\nfinal causation remains in play in the sphere of intentional action by\nproviding the very identity conditions of the desires which serve as\nefficient causes of intentional action. Still, this reasoning,\npositive though it is, also contains a large concession: final causes\nare implicated in the efficient causal realm only under the aspect of\nintentionality. This is why Su\u00e1rez ultimately concludes:\n\n\nI say first: in order for an end to cause, it is altogether necessary\nthat it be cognised in advance. (Dico ergo primo: ut finis causet,\nnecessarium omnino est ut praecognitus sit: DM XXIII\n7.2)\n\n",
