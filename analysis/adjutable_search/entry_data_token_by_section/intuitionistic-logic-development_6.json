There is not a shred of proof for the conviction,\nwhich has sometimes been put forward [here Brouwer refers in a\nfootnote to Hilbert 1900] that there exist no unsolvable mathematical\nproblems.\n\n\nHere he seems to overlook that, constructively, there is a difference\nbetween the claim that every mathematical problem is solvable and the\nweaker claim that there are no absolutely unsolvable problems. The\nformer is equivalent to \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\), the latter to \\(\\neg \\neg(A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\); and Brouwer had demonstrated the intuitionistic\nvalidity of the latter in the same paper. Indeed, in the Brouwer\narchive there is a note from about the same period 1907\u20131908 in\nwhich the point is made explicitly:\n\n\nCan one ever demonstrate of a proposition, that it can never be\ndecided? No, because one would have to so by reductio ad\nabsurdum. So one would have to say: assume that the proposition\nhas been decided in sense \\(a\\), and from that deduce a\ncontradiction. But then it would have been proved that not-\\(a\\)\nis true, and the proposition is decided after all.\n(van Dalen 2001b: 174n.a; translation mine)\n\n\nBrouwer never published this note. Wavre in 1926 gave the argument for\na particular case, clearly seeing the general point:\n\n\nIt suffices to give an example of a number of which one does not know\nwhether it is algebraic or transcendent in order to give at the same\ntime an example of a number that, until further information comes in,\ncould be neither the one nor the other. But, on the other hand, it\nwould be in vain, it seems to me, to want to define a number that\nindeed is neither algebraic nor transcendent, as the only way to show\nthat it is not algebraic consists in showing that it is absurd that it\nwould be, and then the number would be transcendent. (Wavre 1926: 66;\ntranslation mine)\n\n\nThe explicit observation that \\(\\neg \\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) means that\nno absolutely unsolvable problem can be indicated was made in Heyting\n1934: 16.\n",
