    "main_text": "Visual thinking and discovery || Discovering properties and kinds\n4.3 Discovering properties and kinds\nIn this section I will illustrate and then discuss the use of\nvisual thinking in discovering kinds of mathematical entity, by going\nthrough a few of the main steps leading to geometric group theory, a\nsubject which really took off in the 1980s through the work of Mikhail\nGromov.  The material is set out nicely in greater depth in Starikova\n(2012).\nSometimes it can be fruitful to think of non-spatial entities, such\nas algebraic structures, in terms of a spatial representation. An\nexample is the representation of a finitely generated group by a\nCayley graph. Let \\((G, \\cdot)\\) be a group and \\(S\\) a finite subset\nof \\(G\\). Let \\(S^{-1}\\) be the set of inverses of members of \\(S\\).\nThen \\((G, \\cdot)\\) is generated by \\(S\\) if and only if\nevery member of \\(G\\) is the product (with respect to \\(\\cdot\\)) of\nmembers of \\(S\\cup S^{-1}\\). In that case \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\) is said to\nbe a finitely generated group. Here are a couple of examples.\nFirst consider the group \\(S_{3}\\) of permutations of 3 elements\nunder composition. Letting \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\) be the elements, all six\npermutations can be generated by \\(\\rf\\) and \\(\\rr\\) where\n\n\\(\\rf\\) (for \u201cflip\u201d) fixes a and swaps \\(b\\) with \\(c\\),\ni.e., it takes to \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\) to \\(\\langle a, c,\nb\\rangle\\), and\n\\(\\rr\\) (for \u201crotate\u201d) takes \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\) to\n\\(\\langle c, a, b\\rangle\\).\n\nThe Cayley graph for \\((S_{3}, \\cdot, \\{\\rf, \\rr\\})\\) is a graph\nwhose vertices represent the members of \\(S_{3}\\) and two\n\u201ccolours\u201d of directed edges, representing composition with\n\\(\\rf\\) and composition with \\(\\rr\\). Figure 10 illustrates: red\ndirected edges represent composition with \\(\\rr\\) and black edges\nrepresent composition with \\(\\rf\\). So a red edge from a vertex\n\\(\\rv\\) representing \\(\\rs\\) in \\(S_{3}\\) ends at a vertex\nrepresenting \\(\\rs\\rr\\) and a black edge from \\(\\rv\\) ends at a vertex\nrepresenting \\(\\rs\\rf\\).  (Notation: \u201c\\(\\rs\\rr\\)\u201d\nabbreviates \u201c\\(\\rs \\cdot \\rr\\)\u201d which here denotes\n\u201c\\(\\rs\\) followed by \\(\\rr\\)\u201d; same for\n\u201c\\(\\rf\\)\u201d in place of \u201c\\(\\rr\\)\u201d.) A black edge\nhas arrowheads both ways because \\(\\rf\\) is its own inverse, that is,\nflipping and flipping again takes you back to where you\nstarted. (Sometimes a pair of edges with arrows in opposite directions\nis used instead.) The symbol \u201c\\(\\re\\)\u201d denotes the identity.\n\n\nFigure 10\n\nAn example of a finitely generated group of infinite order is\n\\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{1\\})\\). We can get any integer by successively\nadding 1 or its additive inverse \\(-1\\). Since 3 added to the inverse\nof 2 is 1, and 2 added to the inverse of 3 is \\(-1\\), we can get any\ninteger by adding members of \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) and their inverses. Thus\nboth \\(\\{1\\}\\) and \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) are generating sets for \\((\\mathbb{Z},\n+)\\). Figure 11 illustrates part of the Cayley graph for\n\\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\). The horizontal directed edges represent\n+2. The directed edges ascending or descending obliquely represent\n\\(+3\\).\n \n\n\nFigure 11\n\nAnother example of a generated group of infinite order is \\(F_2\\),\nthe free group generated by a pair of members. The first few\niterations of its Cayley graph are shown in Figure 12, where \\(\\{a,\nb\\}\\) is the set of generators and a right horizontal move between\nadjacent vertices represents composition with \\(a\\), an upward\nvertical move represents composition with \\(b\\), and leftward and\ndownward moves represent composition with the inverse of \\(a\\) and the\ninverse of \\(b\\) respectively.  The central vertex represents the\nidentity.\n\n\nFigure 12\n\nThinking of generated groups in terms of their Cayley graphs makes\nit very natural to view them as metric spaces. A path is a\nsequence of consecutively adjacent edges, regardless of direction. For\nexample in the Cayley graph for \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\) the\nedges from \\(-2\\) to 1, from 1 to \\(-1\\), from \\(-1\\) to 2 (in that\norder) constitute a path, representing the action, starting from\n\\(-2\\), of adding 3, then adding \\(-2\\), then adding 3. Taking each\nedge to have unit length, the metric \\(d_S\\) for a group \\(G\\)\ngenerated by a finite subset \\(S\\) of \\(G\\) is defined: for any \\(g\\),\n\\(h \\in G\\), \\(d_{S}(g, h) =\\) the length of a shortest path from\n\\(g\\) to \\(h\\) in the Caley graph of \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\). This is the\nword metric for this generated group.\nViewing a finitely generated group as a metric space allows us to\nconsider its growth function \\(\\gamma(n)\\) which is the cardinality of\nthe \u201cball\u201d of radius \\(\\le n\\) centred on the identity\n(the number of members of the group whose distance from the identity\nis not greater than \\(n\\)). A growth function for a given group\ndepends on the set of generators chosen, but when the group is\ninfinite the asymptotic behaviour as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) of the\ngrowth functions is independent of the set of generators.\nNoticing the possibility of defining a metric on generated groups\ndid not require first viewing diagrams of their Cayley graphs. This is\nbecause a word in the generators is just a finite sequence of symbols\nfor the generators or their inverses (we omit the symbol for the group\noperation), and so has an obvious length visually suggested by the\nwritten form of the word, namely the number of symbols in the\nsequence; and then it is natural to define the distance between group\nmembers \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) to be the length of a shortest word that gets\none from \\(g\\) to \\(h\\) by right multiplication, that is,\n\\(\\textrm{min}\\{\\textrm{length}(w): w = g^{-1}h\\}\\). \nHowever, viewing generated groups by means of their Cayley graphs\nwas the necessary starting point for geometric group theory, which\nenables us to view finitely generated groups of infinite order not\nmerely as graphs or metric spaces but as geometric entities. The main\nsteps on this route will be sketched briefly here; for more detail see\nStarikova (2012) and the references therein. The visual key is to\nstart thinking in terms of the \u201ccoarse geometry\u201d of the\nCayley graph of the generated group, by zooming out in visual\nimagination so far that the discrete nature of the graph is\ntransformed into a traditional geometrical object. For example, the\nCayley graph of a generated group of finite order such as \\((S_{3},\n\\cdot, \\{f, r\\})\\) illustrated in Figure 11\nbecomes a dot; the Cayley graph for \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\)\nillustrated in Figure 12 becomes an uninterrupted\nline infinite in both directions. \nThe word metric of a generated group is discrete: the values are\nalways in \\(N\\). How is this visuo-spatial association of a discrete\nmetric space with a continuous geometrical object achieved\nmathematically? By quasi-isometry. While an isometry from one metric\nspace to another is a distance preserving map, a quasi-isometry is a\nmap which preserves distances to within fixed linear bounds. Precisely\nput, a map \\(f\\) from \\((S, d)\\) to \\((S', d')\\) is a\nquasi-isometry iff for some real constants \\(L > 0\\) and\n\\(K \\ge 0\\) and all \\(x\\), \\(y\\) in \\(S\\) \\[ d(x, y)/L - K \\le\nd'(f(x), f(y)) \\le L \\cdot d(x, y) + K.  \\]\nThe spaces \\((S, d)\\) and \\((S', d')\\) are\nquasi-isometric spaces iff the quasi-isometry \\(f\\)\nis also quasi-surjective, in the sense that there is a real constant\n\\(M \\ge 0\\) such that every point of \\(S'\\) is no further than \\(M\\)\naway from some point in the image of \\(f\\).\nFor example, \\((\\mathbb{Z}, d)\\) is quasi-isometric to\n\\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) where \\(d(x, y) = |y - x|\\), because the inclusion\nmap \\(\\iota\\) from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\iota(n) = n\\),\nis an isometry hence a quasi-isometry with \\(L = 1\\) and \\(K = 0\\),\nand each point in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is no further than \\(1/2\\) away from\nan integer (in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). Also, it is easy to see that for any\nreal number \\(x\\), if \\(g(x) =\\) the nearest integer to \\(x\\) (or the\ngreatest integer less than \\(x\\) if it is midway between integers)\nthen \\(g\\) is a quasi-isometry from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\nwith \\(L = 1\\) and \\(K =\\frac{1}{2}\\);.\nThe relation between metric spaces of being quasi-isometric is an\nequivalence relation. Also, if \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are generating sets of\na group \\((G, \\cdot)\\), the Cayley graphs of \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\) and\n\\((G, \\cdot, T)\\) with their word metrics are quasi-isometric\nspaces. This means that properties of a generated group which are\nquasi-isometric invariants will be independent of the choice of\ngenerating set, and therefore informative about the group itself.\nMoreover, it is easy to show that the Cayley graph of a generated\ngroup with word metric is quasi-isometric to a geodesic \nspace.[1] \n A triangle\nwith vertices \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) in this space is the union of three\ngeodesic segments, between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\),\nand between \\(z\\) and \\(x\\). This is the gateway for the application\nof Gromov\u2019s insights, some of which can be grasped with the help\nof visual geometric thinking.\nHere are some indications. Recall the Poincar\u00e9 open disc\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry: geodesics are diameters or arcs of\ncircles orthogonal to the boundary, with unit distance represented by\never shorter Euclidean distances as one moves from the centre towards\nthe boundary. (The boundary is not part of the model). All triangles\nhave angle sum \\(< \\pi\\) (Figure 13, left), and\nthere is a global constant \u03b4 such that all triangles are\n\u03b4-thin in the following sense:\nA triangle \\(T\\) is \u03b4-thin if and\nonly if any point on one side of \\(T\\) lies within \u03b4 of some\npoint on one of the other two sides.\nThis condition is equivalent to the condition that each side of\n\\(T\\) lies within the union of the \u03b4-neighbourhoods of the other\ntwo sides, as illustrated in Figure 13,\nright. There is no constant \u03b4 such that all triangles in a\nEuclidean plane are \u03b4-thin, because for any \u03b4 there are\ntriangles large enough that the midpoint of a longest side lies\nfurther than \u03b4 from all points on the other two sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 13[2]\n\n\nThe definition of thin triangles is sufficiently general to apply\nto any geodesic space and allows a generalisation of the concept of\nhyperbolicity beyond its original context:\n\nA geodesic space is hyperbolic iff for some \u03b4 all\nits triangles are \u03b4-thin.\nA group is hyperbolic iff it has a Cayley graph\nquasi-isometric to a hyperbolic geodesic space.\n\n\nThe class of hyperbolic groups is large and includes important\nsubkinds, such as finite groups, free groups and the fundamental\ngroups of surfaces of genus \\(\\ge 2\\). Some striking theorems have\nbeen proved for them. For example, for every hyperbolic group the word\nproblem is solvable, and every hyperbolic group has a finite\npresentation. So we can reasonably conclude that the discovery of this\nmathematical kind, the hyperbolic groups, has been fruitful.\nHow important was visual thinking to the discoveries leading to\ngeometric group theory? Visual thinking was needed to discover Cayley\ngraphs as a means of representing finitely generated groups. This is\nnot the triviality it might seem: Cayley graphs must be distinguished\nfrom the diagrams we use to present them visually. A Cayley graph is a\nmathematical representation of a generated group, not a\nvisual representation. It consists of the following\ncomponents: a set \\(V\\) (\u201cvertices\u201d), a set \\(E\\) of\nordered pairs of members of \\(V\\) (\u201cdirected edges\u201d) and a\npartition of \\(E\\) into distinguished subsets, (\u201ccolours\u201d,\neach one for representing right multiplication by a particular\ngenerator). The Cayley graph of a generated group of infinite order\ncannot be fully represented by a diagram given the usual conventions\nof representation for diagrams of graphs, and distinct diagrams may\nvisually represent the same Cayley graph: both diagrams in Figure 14\ncan be labelled so that under the usual conventions they represent the\nCayley graph of \\((S_{3}, \\cdot, \\{f, r\\})\\), already illustrated by\nFigure 10. So the Cayley graph cannot be a\ndiagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 14\n\nDiagrams of Cayley graphs were important in prompting\nmathematicians to think in terms of the coarse-grained geometry of the\ngraphs, in that this idea arises just when one thinks in terms of\n\u201czooming out\u201d visually. Gromov (1993) makes the point in a\npassage quoted in Starikova (2012:138)\n  This space [a Cayley graph with the word metric] may\nappear boring and uneventful to a geometer\u2019s eye since it is\ndiscrete and the traditional (e.g., topological and infinitesimal)\nmachinery does not run in [the group] \u0393. To regain the geometric\nperspective one has to change one\u2019s position and move the\nobservation point far away from \u0393.  Then the metric in \u0393\nseen from the distance \\(d\\) becomes the original distance divided by\n\\(d\\) and for \\(d \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the points in \u0393 coalesce\ninto a connected continuous solid unity which occupies the visual\nhorizon without any gaps and holes and fills our geometer\u2019s\nheart with joy.\nIn saying that one has to move the observation point far away from\n\u0393 so that the points coalesce into a unity which occupies the\nvisual horizon, he makes clear that visual imagination is involved in\na crucial step on the road to geometric group theory. Visual thinking\nis again involved in discovering hyperbolicity as a property of\ngeneral geodesic spaces from thinking about the Poincar\u00e9 disk\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry. It is hard to see how this property\nwould have been discovered without the use of visual resources. \n5.  Visual thinking and mental arithmetic\n\nWhile there is no reason to think that mental arithmetic (mental\ncalculation in the integers and rational numbers) typically involves\nmuch visual thinking, there is strong evidence of substantial visual\nprocessing in the mental arithmetic of highly trained abacus users.\n\nIn earlier times an abacus would be a rectangular board or table\nsurface marked with lines or grooves along which pebbles or counters\ncould be moved. The oldest surviving abacus, the Salamis abacus, dated\naround 300 BCE, is a white marble slab, with markings designed for\nmonetary calculation (Fernandes 2015, Other Internet Resources). These were\nsuperseded by rectangular frames within which wires or rods parallel to\nthe short sides are fixed, with moveable holed beads on them. There are\nseveral kinds of modern abacus \u2014 the Chinese suanpan, the Russian\nschoty and the Japanese soroban for example \u2014 each kind with\nvariations. Evidence for visual processing in mental arithmetic comes\nfrom studies with well trained users of the soroban, an example of\nwhich is shown in Figure 15.\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\n\nEach column of beads represents a power of 10, increasing to the\nleft. The horizontal bar, sometimes called the reckoning\nbar, separates the beads on each column into one bead of value 5\nabove and four beads of value 1 below. The number represented in a\ncolumn is determined by the beads which are not separated from the\nreckoning bar. A column on which all beads are separated by a gap from\nthe bar represents zero. For example, the number 6059 is represented on\na portion of a schematic soroban in Figure 16.\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\nOn some sorobans there is a mark on the reckoning bar at every third\ncolumn; if a user chooses one of these as a unit column, the marks will\nhelp the user keep track of which columns represent which powers of\nten. Calculations are made by using forefinger and thumb to move beads\naccording to procedures for the standard four numerical operations and\nfor extraction of square and cube roots (Bernazzani 2005,Other Internet Resources). Despite the\nfact that the soroban has a decimal place representation of numbers,\nthe soroban procedures are not \u2018translations\u2019 of the\nprocedures normally taught for the standard operations using arabic\nnumerals. For example, multidigit addition on a soroban starts by\nadding highest powers of ten and proceeds rightwards to lower powers,\ninstead of starting with units thence proceeding leftwards to tens,\nhundreds and so on.\n\nPeople trained to use a soroban often learn to do mental arithmetic\nby visualizing an abacus and imagining moving beads on it in accordance\nwith the procedures learned for arithmetical calculations (Frank and\nBarner 2012). Mental abacus (MA), as this kind of mental arithmetic is\nknown, compares favourably with other kinds of mental calculation for\nspeed and accuracy (Kojima 1954) and MA users are often found among the\nmedallists in the Mental Calculation World Cup.\n\nAlthough visual and manual motor imagery is likely to occur,\ncognitive scientists have probed the question whether the actual\nprocesses of MA calculation consist in or involve imagining performing\noperations on a physical abacus. Brain imaging studies provide one\nsource of evidence bearing on this question. Comparing well-trained\nabacus calculators with matched controls, evidence has been found that\nMA involves neural resources of visuospatial working memory with a form\nof abacus which does not depend on the modality (visual or auditory) of\nthe numerical inputs (Chen et al. 2006). Another imaging study found\nthat, compared to controls without abacus training, subjects with long\nterm MA training from a young age had enhanced brain white matter\nrelated to motor and visuospatial processes (Hu et al. 2011).\n\nBehavioural studies provide more evidence. Tests on expert and\nintermediate level abacus users strongly suggest that MA calculators\nmentally manipulate an abacus representation so that it passes through\nthe same states that an actual abacus would pass through in solving an\naddition problem. Without using an actual abacus MA calculators were\nable to answer correctly questions about intermediates states unique to\nthe abacus-based solution of a problem; moreover, their response times\nwere a monotonic function of the position of the probed state in the\nsequence of states of the abacus process for solving the problem\n(Stigler 1984). On top of the \u2018intermediate states\u2019\nevidence, there is \u2018error type\u2019 evidence. Mental addition\ntests comparing abacus users with American subjects revealed that\nabacus users made errors of a kind which the Americans did not make,\nbut which were predictable from the distribution of errors in physical\nabacus addition (Stigler 1984).\n\nAnother study found evidence that when a sequence of numbers\nis presented auditorily (as a verbal whole \u201cthree thousand five\nhundred and forty seven\u201d or as a digit sequence \u201cThree,\nfive, four, seven\u201d) abacus experts encode it into an imaged\nabacus display, while non-experts encode it verbally (Hishitani\n1990).\n\nFurther evidence comes from behavioural interference studies. In\nthese studies subjects have to perform mental calculations, with and\nwithout a task of some other kind to be performed during the\ncalculation, with the aim of seeing which kinds of task interfere with\ncalculation as measured by differences of reaction time and error rate.\nAn early study found that a linguistic task interfered weakly with MA\nperformance (unless the linguistic task was to answer a mathematical\nquestion), while motor and visual tasks interfered relatively\nstrongly. These findings suggested to the paper\u2019s authors\nthat MA representations are not linguistic in nature but rely on visual\nmechanisms and, for intermediate practitioners, on motor mechanisms as\nwell (Hatano et al. 1977).\n\nThese studies provide impressive evidence that MA does involve mental\nmanipulation of a visualized abacus. However, limits of the known\ncapacities for perceiving or representing pluralities of objects seem\nto pose a problem. We have a parallel individuation system\nfor keeping track of up to four objects simultaneously and\nan approximate number system (ANS) which allows us to gauge\nroughly the cardinality of a set of things, with an error which\nincreases with the size of the set. The parallel individuation system\nhas a limit of three or four objects and the ANS represents\ncardinalities greater than four only approximately. Yet mental abacus\nusers would need to hold in mind with precision abacus representations\ninvolving a much larger number of beads than four (and the way in\nwhich those beads are distributed on the abacus). For example, the\nnumber 439 requires a precise distribution of twelve beads. Frank and\nBarner (2012) address this problem. In some circumstances we can\nperceive a plurality of objects as a single entity, a set, and\nsimultaneously perceive those objects as individuals. There is\nevidence that we can keep track of up to three such sets in parallel\nand simultaneously make reliable estimates of the cardinalities of the\nsets (if not more than four). If the sets themselves can be easily\nperceived as (a) divided into disjoint subsets, e.g. columns of beads\non an abacus, and (b) structured in a familiar way, e.g. as a\ndistribution of four beads below a reckoning bar and one above, we\nhave the resources for recognising a three-digit number from its\nabacus representation. The findings of (Frank and Barner 2012) suggest\nthat this is what happens in MA: a mental abacus is represented in\nvisuospatial working memory by splitting it into a series of columns\neach of which is stored as a unit with its own detailed\nsubstructure.\n\nThese cognitive investigations confirm the self-reports of mental\nabacus users that they calculate mentally by visualizing operating on\nan abacus as they would operate on a physical abacus. (See the 20-second\nmovie\nBrief interview with mental abacus user, at the Stanford Language and Cognition \nLab, for one such self-report.) There is good evidence that MA often involves\nprocesses linked to motor cognition in addition to active visual\nimagination. Intermediate abacus users often make hand movements,\nwithout necessarily attending to those movements during MA calculation,\nas shown in the second of the three short movies just mentioned.\nExperiments to test the possible role of motor processes in MA resulted\nin findings which led the authors to conclude that premotor processes\ninvolved in the planning of hand movements were involved in MA (Brooks\net al. 2018).\n6. A priori and a posteriori roles of visual experience\nIn coming to know a mathematical truth visual experience can play a\nmerely \u201cenabling\u201d role. For example, visual experience may\nhave been a factor in a person\u2019s getting certain concepts\ninvolved in a mathematical proposition, thus enabling her to\nunderstand the proposition, without giving her reason to believe\nit. Or the visual experience of reading an argument in a text book may\nenable one to find out just what the argument is, without helping her\ntell that the argument is sound. In earlier sections visual experience\nhas been presented as having roles in proof and propositional\ndiscovery that are not merely enabling. On the face of it this raises\na puzzle: mathematics, as opposed to its application to natural\nphenomena, has traditionally been thought to be an a priori\nscience; but if visual experience plays a role in acquiring\nmathematical knowledge which is not merely enabling, the result would\nsurely be a posteriori knowledge, not a priori\nknowledge. Setting aside knowledge acquired by testimony (reading or\nhearing that such-&-such is the case), there remain plenty of\ncases where sensory experience seems to play an evidential role in\ncoming to know some mathematical fact.\n6.1 Evidential uses of visual experience\nA plausible example of the evidential use of sensory experience is\nthe case of a child coming to know that \\(5 + 3 = 8\\) by counting on\nher fingers. While there may be an important \\(a\\) priori\nelement in the child\u2019s appreciation that she can reliably\ngeneralise from the result of her counting experiment, getting that\nresult by counting is an a posteriori route to it. For\nanother example, consider the question: how many vertices does a cube\nhave? With the background knowledge that cubes do not vary in shape\nand that material cubes do not differ from geometrical cubes in number\nof vertices (where a \u201cvertex\u201d of a material cube is a\ncorner), one can find the answer by visually inspecting a material\ncube. Or if one does not have a material cube to hand, one can\nvisually imagine a cube, and by attending to its top and bottom faces\nextract the information that the vertices of the cube are exactly the\nvertices of these two quadrangular faces. When one gets the answer by\ninspecting a material cube, the visual experience contributes to\none\u2019s grounds for believing the answer and that contribution is\npart of what makes the belief state knowledge. So the role of the\nvisual experience is evidential; hence the resulting knowledge is not\na priori. When one gets the answer by visually imagining a\ncube, one is drawing on the accumulated cognitive effects of past\nexperiences of seeing material cubes to bring to mind what a cube\nlooks like; so the experience of visual imagining has an indirectly\nevidential role in this case.\nDo such examples show that mathematics is not an a priori\nscience? Yes, if an a priori science is understood to be one\nwhose knowable truths are all knowable only in an a\npriori way, without use of sense experience as evidence. No, if\nan a priori science is one whose knowable truths are all\nknowable in an a priori way, allowing that some may be\nknowable also in an a posteriori way.\n6.2 An evidential use of visual experience in proving\nMany cases of proving something (or following a proof of it)\ninvolve making, or imagining making, changes in a symbol array. A\nstandard presentation of the proof of left-cancellation in group\ntheory provides an example. \u201cLeft-cancellation\u201d is the\nclaim that for any members \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) of a group with\noperation \\(\\cdot\\) and identity element \\(\\mathbf{e}\\), if \\(a \\cdot\nb = a \\cdot c\\), then \\(b = c\\). Here is (the core of) a proof of\nit: \\begin{align*} a \\cdot b &= a \\cdot c\\\\ a^{-1} \\cdot (a\n\\cdot b) &= a^{-1} \\cdot (a \\cdot c)\\\\ (a^{-1} \\cdot a) \\cdot b\n&= (a^{-1} \\cdot a) \\cdot c\\\\ \\mathbf{e}\\cdot b &= \\mathbf{e}\n\\cdot c\\\\ b &= c.  \\end{align*}\n\nSuppose that one comes to know left-cancellation by following this\nsequence of steps. Is this an a priori way of getting this\nknowledge? Although following a mathematical proof is thought to be a\nparadigmatically a priori way of getting knowledge, attention\nto the role of visual experience here throws this into doubt. The case\nfor claiming that the visual experience has an evidential role is as\nfollows.\nThe visual experience reveals not only what the steps of the\nargument are but also that they are valid, thereby contributing to our\ngrounds for accepting the argument and believing its conclusion.\nConsider, for example, the step from the second equation to the third.\nThe relevant background knowledge, apart from the logic of identity,\nis that a group operation is associative. This fact is usually\nrepresented in the form of an equation that simply relocates brackets\nin an obvious way: \\[ x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = (x \\cdot y) \\cdot z \\]\n\nWe see that relocating the brackets in accord with this format, the\nleft-hand term of the second equation is transformed into the\nleft-hand term of the third equation, and the same for the right-hand\nterms. So the visual experience plays an evidential role in our\nrecognising as valid the step from the second equation to the\nthird. Hence this quite standard route to knowledge of\nleft-cancellation turns out to be a posteriori, even though\nit is a clear case of following a proof.\nAgainst this, one may argue that the description just given of what\nis going on in following the proof is not strictly correct, as\nfollows.  Exactly the same proof can be expressed in natural language,\nusing \u201cthe composition of \\(x\\) with \\(y\\)\u201d for \u201c\\(x\n\\cdot y\\)\u201d, but the result would be hard to take in. Or the\nproof can be presented using a different notational convention, one\nwhich forces a quite different expression of associativity. For\nexample, we can use the Polish convention of putting the operation\nsymbol before the operands: instead of \u201c\\(x \\cdot y\\)\u201d we\nput \u201c\\(\\cdot x y\\)\u201d.  In that case associativity would be\nexpressed in the following way, without brackets: \\[ \\cdot x \\cdot\ny z = \\cdot \\cdot x y z.  \\]\n\nThe equations of the proof would then need to be re-symbolised; but\nwhat is expressed by each equation after re-symbolisation and the\nsteps from one to the next would be exactly as before. So we would be\nfollowing the very same proof, step by step. But we would not be using\nvisual experiences involved to notice the relocation of brackets this\ntime. This suggests that the role of the different visual experiences\ninvolved in following the argument in its different guises is merely\nto give us access to the common reasoning: the role of the experience\nis merely enabling. On this account the visual experience does not\nstrictly and literally enable us to see that any of the steps are\nvalid; rather, recognition of (or sensitivity to) the validity of the\nsteps results from cognitive processing at a more abstract level.\nWhich of these rival views is correct? Does our visual experience\nin following the argument presented with brackets (1) reveal to us the\nvalidity of some of the steps, given the relevant background knowledge\n? Or (2) merely give us access to the argument? The core of the\nargument against view (1) is this:\n\nSeeing the relocation of brackets is not essential to following the\nargument.\nSo seeing merely gives access to the argument; it does not reveal\nany step to be valid.\n\nThe step to this conclusion is faulty. How one follows a proof may,\nand in this case does, depend on how it is presented, and different\nways of following a proof may be different ways of coming to know its\nconclusion. While seeing the relocation of brackets is not essential\nto all ways of following this argument, it is essential to the normal\nway of following the argument when it is symbolically presented with\nbrackets in the way given above.\nAssociativity, expressed without symbols, is this: When the binary\ngroup operation is applied twice in succession on an ordered triple of\noperands \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\), it makes no difference whether\nthe first application is to the initial two operands or the final two\noperands. While this is the content of associativity, for ease of\nprocessing associativity is almost always expressed as a\nsymbol-manipulation rule. Visual perception is used to tell in\nparticular cases whether the rule thus expressed is correctly\nimplemented, in the context of prior knowledge that the rule is\ncorrect. What is going on here is a familiar division of labour in\nmathematical thinking. We first establish the soundness of a rule of\nsymbol-manipulation (in terms of the governing semantic\nconventions\u2014in this case the matter is trivial); then we check\nvisually that the rule is correctly implemented. Processing at a more\nabstract, semantic level is often harder than processing at a purely\nsyntactic level; it is for this reason that we often resort to\nsymbol-manipulation techniques as proxy for reasoning directly with\nmeanings to solve a problem. (What is six eighths divided by\nthree fifths, without using any symbolic technique?) When we do use\nsymbol-manipulation in proving or following a proof, visual experience\nis required to discern that the moves conform to permitted patterns\nand thus contributes to our grounds for accepting the argument. Then\nthe way of coming to know the conclusion has an a posteriori\nelement.\n6.3 A non-evidential use of visual experience\nMust a use of visual experience in knowledge acquisition be\nevidential, if the visual experience is not merely enabling?\nHere is an example which supports a negative answer. Imagine a square\nor look at a drawing of one. Each of its four sides has a\nmidpoint. Now visualize the \u201cinner\u201d square whose sides run\nbetween the midpoints of adjacent sides of the original square (Figure\n17, left).  By visualizing this figure, it should be clear that the\noriginal square is composed precisely of the inner square plus four\ncorner triangles, each side of the inner square being the base of a\ncorner triangle. One can now visualize the corner triangles folding\nover, with creases along the sides of the inner square. The starting\nand end states of the imagery transformation can be represented by the\nleft and right diagrams of Figure 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\nVisualizing the folding-over within the remembered frame of the\noriginal square results in an image of the original square divided\ninto square quarters, its quadrants, and the sides of the inner square\nseem to be diagonals of the quadrants. Many people conclude that the\ncorner triangles can be arranged to cover the inner square exactly,\nwithout any gap or overlap. Thence they infer that the area of the\noriginal square is twice the size of the inner square. Let us assume\nthat the propositions concerned are about Euclidean figures. Our\nconcern is with the visual route to the following:\nThe parts of a square beyond its inner square (formed by\njoining midpoints of adjacent sides of the original square) can be\narranged to fit the inner square exactly, without overlap or gap,\nwithout change of size or shape.\nThe experience of visualizing the corner triangles folding over can\nlead one to this belief. But it cannot provide good evidence for it.\nThis is because visual experience (of sight or imagination) has\nlimited acuity and so does not enable us to discriminate between a\nsituation in which the outer triangles fit the inner square\nexactly and a situation in which they fit inexactly but well\nenough for the mismatch to escape visual detection. (This contrasts\nwith the case of discovering the number of vertices of a cube by\nseeing or visualizing one.) Even though visualizing the square, the\ninner square and then visualizing the corner triangles folding over is\nconstrained by the results of earlier perceptual experience of scenes\nwith relevant similarities, we cannot draw from it reliable\ninformation about exact equality of areas, because perception itself\nis not reliable about exact equalities (or exact proportions) of\ncontinuous magnitudes.\nThough the visual experience could not provide good evidence for\nthe belief, it is possible that we erroneously use the\nexperience evidentially in reaching the belief. But it is also\npossible, when reaching the belief in the way described, that we do\nnot take the experience to provide evidence. A non-evidential\nuse is more likely, if when one arrives at the belief in this way one\nfeels fairly certain of it, while aware that visual perception and\nimagination have limited acuity and so cannot provide evidence for a\nclaim of exact fit.\nBut what could the role of the visualizing experience possibly be,\nif it were neither merely enabling nor evidential? One suggestion is\nthat we already have relevant beliefs and belief-forming dispositions,\nand the visualizing experience could serve to bring to mind the\nbeliefs and to activate the belief-forming dispositions (Giaquinto\n2007). These beliefs and dispositions will have resulted from prior\npossession of cognitive resources, some subject-specific such as\nconcepts of geometrical figures, some subject-general such as symmetry\nperception about perceptually salient vertical and horizontal axes. A\nrelevant prior belief in this case might be that a square is symmetric\nabout a diagonal. A relevant disposition might be the disposition to\nbelieve that the quadrants of a square are congruent squares upon\nseeing or visualizing a square with a horizontal base plus the\nvertical and horizontal line segments joining midpoints of its\nopposite sides.  (These dispositions differ from ordinary perceptual\ndispositions to believe what we see in that they are not cancelled\nwhen we mistrust the accuracy of the visual experience.) \nThe question whether the resulting belief would be knowledge\ndepends on whether the belief-forming dispositions are reliable\n(truth-conducive) and the pre-existing belief states are states of\nknowledge. As these conditions can be met without any violation of\nepistemic rationality, the visualizing route described incompletely\nhere can be a route to knowledge. In that case we would have an\nexample of a use of visual experience which is integral to a way of\nknowing a truth, which is not merely enabling and yet not\nevidential. A fuller account and discussion is given in chapters 3 and\n4 of Giaquinto (2007).\n7. Further uses of visual representations\nThere are other significant uses of visual representations in\nmathematics. This final section briefly presents a couple of them.\nAlthough the use of diagrams in arguments in analysis faces special\ndangers (as noted in 3.3), the use of\ndiagrams to illustrate symbolically presented operations can be very\nhelpful. Consider, for example, this pair of operations \\(\\{ f(x) + k,\nf(x + k) \\}\\). Grasping them and the difference between them can be\naided by a visual illustration; similarly for the sets \\(\\{ f(x + k),\nf(x - k) \\}\\), \\(\\{ |f(x)|, f(|x|) \\}\\), \\(\\{ f(x)^{-1}, f^{-1}(x),\nf(x^{-1}) \\}\\). While generalization on the basis of a visual\nillustration is unreliable, we can use them as checks against\ncalculation errors and overgeneralization. The same holds for\nproperties. Consider for example, functions for which \\(f(-x) =\nf(x)\\), known as even functions, and functions for which\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\), the odd functions: it can be helpful to\nhave in mind the images of graphs of \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(y = x^{3}\\) as\ninstances of evenness and oddness, to remind one that even functions\nare symmetrical about the \\(y\\)-axis and odd functions have rotation\nsymmetry by \\(\\pi\\) about the origin. They can serve as a reminder and\ncheck against over-generalisation: any general claim true of all odd\nfunctions, for example, must be true of \\(y = x^{3}\\) in\nparticular.\nThe utility of visual representations in real and complex analysis\nis not confined to such simple cases. Visual representations can help\nus grasp what motivates certain definitions and arguments, and thereby\ndeepen our understanding. Abundant confirmation of this claim can be\ngathered from working through the text Visual Complex\nAnalysis (Needham 1997). Some mathematical subjects have natural\nvisual representations, which then give rise to a domain of\nmathematical entities in their own right. This is true of geometry but\nis also true of subjects which become algebraic in nature very\nquickly, such as graph theory, knot theory and braid\ntheory. Techniques of computer graphics now enable us to use moving\nimages. For an example of the power of kinematic visual\nrepresentations to provide and increase understanding of a subject,\nsee the first two \u201cchapters\u201d of the online introduction to\nbraid theory by Ester Dalvit (2012, Other Internet Resources). \nWith regard to proofs, a minimal kind of understanding consists in\nunderstanding each line (proposition or formula) and grasping the\nvalidity of each step to a new line from earlier lines. But we can\nhave that stepwise grasp of proof without any idea of why it proceeds\nby those steps. One has a more advanced (or deeper) kind of\nunderstanding when one has the minimal understanding and a\ngrasp of the motivating idea(s) and strategy of the proof. The point\nis sharply expressed by Weyl (1995 [1932]: 453), quoted in (Tappenden\n2005:150)\n  We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept\na mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal\nconclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch. We want first an overview of the aim and the\nroad; we want to understand the idea of the proof, the deeper\ncontext.\nOccasionally the author of a proof gives readers the desired\nunderstanding by adding commentary. But this is not always needed, as\nthe idea of a proof is sometimes revealed in the presentation of the\nproof itself. Often this is done by using visual representations. An\nexample is Fisk\u2019s proof of Chv\u00e1tal\u2019s \u201cart\ngallery\u201d theorem. This theorem is the answer to a combinatorial\nproblem in geometry. Put concretely, the problem is this. Let the\n\\(n\\) walls of a single-floored gallery make a polygon. What is the\nsmallest number of stationary guards needed to ensure that every point\nof the gallery wall can be seen by a guard? If the polygon is convex\n(all interior angles < 180\u00b0), one guard will suffice, as guards\nmay rotate. But if the polygon is not convex, as in Figure 18, one\nguard may not be enough.\n\n\nFigure 18\n\nChv\u00e1tal\u2019s theorem gives the answer: for a gallery with\n\\(n\\) walls, \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) guards suffice, where\n\\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) is the greatest integer \\(\\le n/3\\). (If\nthis does not sound to you sufficiently like a mathematical theorem,\nit can be restated as follows: Let \\(S\\) be a subset of the Euclidean\nplane. For a subset \\(B\\) of \\(S\\) let us say that \\(B\\)\nsupervises \\(S\\) iff for each \\(x \\in S\\) there is a \\(y \\in\nB\\) such that the segment \\(xy\\) lies within \\(S\\). Then the smallest\nnumber \\(f(n)\\) such that every set bounded by a simple \\(n\\)-gon is\nsupervised by a set of \\(f(n)\\) points is at most \\(\\llcorner\nn/3.\\lrcorner\\)\nHere is Steve Fisk\u2019s proof. A short induction shows that\nevery polygon can be triangulated, i.e., non-crossing edges between\nnon-adjacent vertices (\u201cdiagonals\u201d) can be added so that\nthe polygon is entirely composed of non-overlapping triangles. So take\nany \\(n\\)-sided polygon with a fixed triangulation. Think of it as a\ngraph, a set of vertices and connected edges, as in Figure 19.\n\n\nFigure 19\n\nThe first part of the proof shows that the graph is 3-colourable,\ni.e., every vertex can be coloured with one of just three colours\n(red, white and blue, say) so that no edge connects vertices of the\nsame colour.\nThe argument proceeds by induction on \\(n \\ge 3\\), the number of\nvertices.\nFor \\(n = 3\\) it is trivial. Assume it holds for all \\(k\\), where\n\\(3 \\le k < n\\).\nLet triangulated polygon \\(G\\) have \\(n\\) vertices. Let \\(u\\) and\n\\(v\\) be any two vertices connected by diagonal edge \\(uv\\). The\ndiagonal \\(uv\\) splits \\(G\\) into two smaller graphs, both containing\n\\(uv\\). Give \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) different colours, say red and white, as\nin Figure 20.\n\n\nFigure 20\n\nBy the inductive assumption, we may colour each of the smaller\ngraphs with the three colours so that no edge joins vertices of the\nsame colour, keeping fixed the colours of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).  Pasting\ntogether the two smaller graphs as coloured gives us a 3-colouring of\nthe whole graph.\nWhat remains is to show that \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) or fewer\nguards can be placed on vertices so that every triangle is in the view\nof a guard. Let \\(b\\), \\(r\\) and \\(w\\) be the number of vertices\ncoloured blue, red and white respectively. Let \\(b\\) be minimal in\n\\(\\{b, r, w\\}\\). Then \\(b \\le r\\) and \\(b \\le w\\). Then \\(2b \\le r +\nw\\). So \\(3b \\le b + r + w = n\\). So \\(b \\le n/3\\) and so \\(b \\le\n\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\). Place a guard on each blue vertex. Done.\n The central idea of this proof, or the proof strategy, is\nclear. While the actual diagrams produced here are superfluous to the\nproof, some visualizing enables us to grasp the central idea.\n8. Conclusion\nThinking which involves the use of seen or visualized images, which\nmay be static or moving, is widespread in mathematical practice. Such\nvisual thinking may constitute a non-superfluous and non-replaceable\npart of thinking through a specific proof. But there is a real danger\nof over-generalisation when using images, which we need to guard\nagainst, and in some contexts, such as real and complex analysis, the\napparent soundness of a diagrammatic inference is liable to be\nillusory.\nEven when visual thinking does not contribute to proving a\nmathematical truth, it may enable one to discover a truth,\nwhere to discover a truth is to come to believe it in an independent,\nreliable and rational way. Visual thinking can also play a large role\nin discovering a central idea for a proof or a proof-strategy; and in\ndiscovering a kind of mathematical entity or a mathematical\nproperty.\nThe (non-superfluous) use of visual thinking in coming to know a\nmathematical truth does in some cases introduce an a\nposteriori element into the way one comes to know it, resulting\nin a posteriori mathematical knowledge. This is not as\nrevolutionary as it may sound as a truth knowable a\nposteriori may also be knowable a priori. More\ninteresting is the possibility that one can acquire some mathematical\nknowledge in a way in which visual thinking is essential but does not\ncontribute evidence; in this case the role of the visual thinking may\nbe to activate one\u2019s prior cognitive resources. This opens the\npossibility that non-superfluous visual thinking may result in a\npriori knowledge of a mathematical truth.\nVisual thinking may contribute to understanding in more than one\nway. Visual illustrations may be extremely useful in providing\nexamples and non-examples of analytic concepts, thus helping to\nsharpen our grasp of those concepts. Also, visual thinking\naccompanying a proof may deepen our understanding of the proof, giving\nus an awareness of the direction of the proof so that, as Hermann Weyl\nput it, we are not forced to traverse the steps blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch.",
