    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality || Superluminal causation\n8.4 Superluminal causation\n\n\nIn various counterfactual and probabilistic accounts of causation\nviolations of PI entail superluminal causation between the setting of\nthe nearby measurement apparatus and the distant measurement outcome,\nwhereas violations of OI entail superluminal causation between the\ndistant measurement outcomes (see Butterfield 1992b, 1994, Berkovitz\n1998b, section 2). Thus, it seems that theories that violate PI\npostulate a different type of superluminal causation than theories\nthat violate OI. Yet, as Berkovitz (1998b, section 2.4) argues, the\nviolation of PI in Bohm's theory does involve some type of\noutcome dependence, which may be interpreted as a generalization of\nthe violation of OI. In this theory, the specific R-measurement\noutcome in the EPR/B experiment depends on the specific L-measurement\noutcome: For any three different directions x, y,\nz, if the probabilities of x-spin \u2018up\u2019\nand y-spin \u2018up\u2019 are non-zero, the probability of\nR-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 will generally depend on\nwhether the L-outcome is x-spin \u2018up\u2019 or\ny-spin \u2018up\u2019.  Yet, due to the determinism that\nBohm's theory postulates, OI trivially obtains. Put it another way, OI\ndoes not reflect all the types of outcome independence that may exist\nbetween distant outcomes.  Accordingly, the fact that a theory\nsatisfies OI does not entail that it does not involve some other type\nof outcome dependence. Indeed, in all the current quantum theories\nthat violate factorizability there are correlations between distant\nspecific measurement outcomes \u2014 correlations that may well be\ninterpreted as an indication of counterfactual superluminal causation\nbetween these outcomes.\n",
