As the examples of the best philosophers and the heroes of\nRome\u2019s glorious past teach, whom Augustine regularly accuses of\nlove of glory, these actions may easily spring from other motivations\nthan the true love of God. Augustine therefore distinguishes between\ntrue (i.e., Christian) virtue that is motivated by love of God and\n\u201cvirtue as such\u201d (virtus ipsa: De civitate dei\n5.19) that performs the same appropriate actions but is, in the last\nresort, guided by self-love or pride (ib. 5.12; 19.25). Among other\nthings, this distinction underpins his solution of the so-called\nproblem of pagan virtue (Harding 2008; Tornau 2006b; Dodaro 2004a: 27\u201371; Rist 1994:\n168\u2013173) because it permits ascribing virtue in a meaningful\nsense to pagan and pre-Christian paradigms of virtue like Socrates\nwithout having to admit that they were eligible for salvation. If a\n\u201cteleological\u201d perspective on virtue is adopted that\nexclusively focuses on ends, the virtues of the pagan must be judged\nvices rather than virtues and will be punished accordingly (De\ncivitate dei 19.25, the passage from which the non-Augustinian\nphrase that pagan virtues are \u201csplendid vices\u201d seems to be\nderived; see Irwin 1999). An \u201coperative\u201d perspective\nhowever reveals that as far as appropriate actions are concerned,\nvirtuous non-Christians differ from the foolish and wicked but are\nindistinguishable from virtuous Christians. From this point of view,\nSocrates is closer to Paul than to Nero, even though his virtue will\nnot bring him happiness, i.e., eternal bliss. That he envisages a\nperspective on virtue that abstracts from the causal nexus of virtue\nand happiness is perhaps Augustine\u2019s most significant departure\nfrom ancient eudaimonism.\n7.3 Love\n\nLove is a crucial and overarching notion in Augustine\u2019s ethics.\nIt is closely related to virtue\n and often used synonymously with will (e.g., De trinitate\n15.38; in the cogito-like arguments, love and will are\ninterchangeable, cf. De civitate dei 11.27 with\nConfessiones 13.12) or intention (intentio).\nAugustine\u2019s basic text is, of course, the biblical command to\nlove God and neighbor (Matthew 22.37; 39), which he is however\nprepared, throughout his life, to interpret in terms of Platonic\nerotic love (Rist 1994: 148\u2013202). As in the Symposium\nand in Plotinus (Enneads I.6), love is a force in our souls\nthat attracts us to the true beauty we find nowhere else but in and\nabove ourselves; it drives us to ascend from the sensible to the\nintelligible world and to the cognition and contemplation of God\n(Confessiones 10.8\u201338, esp. 38). Even Christian\nfraternal love can be described, in a manner reminiscent of the\nPhaedrus, as a kind of seduction through another\u2019s real\nor assumed righteousness (De trinitate 9.11). In a more\ngeneral way, love means the overall direction of our will (positively)\ntoward God or (negatively) toward ourselves or corporeal creature\n(De civitate dei 14.7; Byers 2013: 88\u201399;\n217\u2013231). The former is called love in a good sense\n(caritas), the latter cupidity or concupiscence\n(cupiditas), i.e., misdirected and sinful love (De\ndoctrina christiana 3.16). The root of sin is excessive self-love\nthat wants to put the self in the position of God and is equivalent\nwith pride (De civitate dei 14.28). It must be distinguished\nfrom the legitimate self-love that is part of the biblical commandment\nand strives for true happiness by subordinating the self to God\n(O\u2019Donovan 1980). In his earlier work, Augustine has some\ndifficulties incorporating love of neighbor into the Platonic and\neudaimonist framework of his thinking (De doctrina christiana\n1.20\u201321, see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n After 400, in the context of his reflections on the Trinity and his\nexegesis of the First Epistle of John (esp. 1 John 4:8; 16, \u201cGod\nis love\u201d), he finds the solution that love is by its very nature\nself-reflexive. In loving our neighbors, we of necessity love that\nlove which enables us to do so itself, which is none other than God;\nlove of God and love of neighbor are, accordingly, co-extensive and,\nultimately, identical (De trinitate 8.12; In epistulam\nIohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 9.10). Right and perverse\nlove or intention\u2014charity or concupiscence\u2014thus becomes\nthe predominant and even the single criterion of moral evaluation;\nAugustine\u2019s ethics may in this sense be labeled intentionalist\n(cf. Mann 1999 on Augustine\u2019s \u201cinner-life ethics\u201d).\nHe keenly insists that each and every action, even if it is externally\ngood and impressive, can be motivated either by a good or an evil\nintention, by right or perverse love, by charity or pride. This goes\nfor the actions prescribed by the Sermon of the Mount and even for\nmartyrdom (In epistulam Iohannis tractatus decem 8.9, partly\nrelying on 1 Corinthians 13:3). It is therefore impossible to give\ncasuistic rules for external moral behavior. The only thing possible\nis the general recommendation to \u201cLove and do what you\nwill\u201d (ib. 7.8), i.e., to take care that the inner disposition\nor intention behind one\u2019s actions is love of God and neighbor\nand not self-love or pride. It is important not to misunderstand this\nas moral subjectivism, which Augustine\u2019s ontological and ethical\nassumptions exclude. He never excuses evil deeds done \u201cwith the\nbest intentions\u201d or with a subjectively pure conscience, and he\ndoes allow for actions that are always condemnable because they cannot\npossibly result from love, such as heresy. In a sense, his ideal agent\nis a successor of the Stoic and Neoplatonic sage, who always acts out\nof inner virtue or perfect rationality (the latter Augustine replaces\nwith true love) but adapts his outward actions to the external\ncircumstances (cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos\n11.200\u2013201 = 59 G Long-Sedley; Diogenes Laertius 7.121;\nPorphyry, Sententiae 32). Augustine\u2019s intentionalism\nhas, however, the ambivalent implication that, since love and will\ninevitably belong to the privacy of the mind, the inner motives for a\nperson\u2019s external agency are unknowable to anyone except the\nagent herself and God. On the one hand, this limits the authority of\nother people\u2014including those endowed with worldly power or an\necclesiastical office\u2014to pass moral judgments. Augustine\nrepeatedly recommends withholding judgment so as to preserve humility\n(De civitate dei 1.26; Sermon 30.3\u20134). On the\nother hand, Augustine makes our inner motivational and moral life\nopaque even to ourselves and fully transparent only to God\n(Confessiones 10.7; In Iohannis evangelium tractatus\n32.5). We can never be fully sure about the purity of our intentions,\nand even if we were, we could not be sure that we will persist in\nthem. All human beings are therefore called to constantly scrutinize\nthe moral status of their inner selves in a prayerful dialogue with\nGod (as it is dramatized in the Confessiones). Such\nself-scrutiny may well be self-tormenting; the obsession of Western\nChristianity with inner latent guilt here has its Augustinian roots.\nThe public staging of Augustine\u2019s confession before God in the\nConfessiones may, among many other things, represent an\nattempt to remedy the loneliness of Christian self-scrutiny (cf.\nConfessiones 10.1\u20137).\n\nAugustine\u2019s intentionalism also provides him with arguments in\nfavor of religious coercion. As the objective of right fraternal love\nis not the neighbor\u2019s temporal well-being but his eternal\nhappiness or salvation, we must not passively tolerate our\nfellow-humans\u2019 sins but should actively correct them if we can;\notherwise, our motivation would be inertia rather than love (In\nepistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 7.11; cf.\nLetter 151.11; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.18). Catholic\nbishops are therefore obliged to compel heretics and schismatics to\nre-enter the Catholic church even forcibly, just as a father beats his\nchildren when he sees them playing with snakes or as we bind a madman\nwho otherwise would fling himself down a precipice (Letter\n93.8; 185.7; and Letter 93.1\u201310 in general). Obviously,\nthis is a paternalistic argument that presupposes superior insight in\nthose who legitimately wield coercive power. While this may be\nacceptable in the case of the Church, which according to\nAugustine\u2019s ecclesiology is the body of Christ and the\nembodiment of fraternal love, it turns out to be problematic when it\nis transferred to secular rulers (Augustine rarely does this, but cf.\nLetter 138.14\u201315). And as even the Church in this world\nis a mixed body of sinners and saints (see\n 8. History and Political Philosophy),\n it may be asked how individual bishops can be sure of their good\nintentions when they use religious force (Rist 1994: 242\u2013245).\nAugustine does not address this problem, presumably because most of\nhis relevant texts are propagandistic defenses of coercion against the\nDonatists.\n7.4 Will and Freedom\n\nThough other Latin philosophers, especially Seneca, had made use of\nthe concept of will (voluntas) before Augustine, it has a\nmuch wider application in his ethics and moral psychology than in any\npredecessor and covers a broader range of phenomena than either\nAristotelian boulesis (roughly, rational choice) or Stoic\nprohairesis (roughly, the fundamental decision to lead a good\nlife). Augustine comes closer than any earlier philosopher to positing\nwill as a faculty of choice that is reducible neither to reason nor to\nnon-rational desire. It has therefore been claimed that Augustine\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d the will (Dihle 1982: ch. 6; Kahn 1988;\ncontrast Frede 2011: 153\u2013174 who, mainly on the basis of De\nlibero arbitrio, emphasizes Augustine\u2019s indebtedness to\nStoicism). Augustine admits both first-order and second-order\nvolitions, the latter being acts of the liberum voluntatis\narbitrium, the ability to choose between conflicting first-order\nvolitions (Stump 2001; Horn 1996; den Bok 1994). Like desires,\nfirst-order volitions are intentional or object-directed and operate\non all levels of the soul. Like memory and thought, will is a\nconstitutive element of the mind (see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God).\n It is closely related to love and, accordingly, the locus of moral\nevaluation. We act well or badly if and only if our actions spring\nfrom a good or evil will, which is equivalent to saying that they are\nmotivated by right (i.e., God-directed) or perverse (i.e.,\nself-directed) love (De civitate dei 14.7).\n With this basic idea in view, Augustine defends the passions or\nemotions against their Stoic condemnation as malfunctions of rational\njudgment by redefining them more neutrally as volitions\n(voluntates) that may be good or bad depending on their\nintentional objects (De civitate dei 9.4\u20135; 14.9;\nWetzel 1992: 98\u2013111; Byers 2012b). The mechanics of the will in\nAugustine\u2019s moral psychology is strongly indebted to the Stoic\ntheory of assent, which it however modifies in at least one respect.\nAs in Stoicism, the will to act is triggered by an impression\ngenerated by an external object (visum). To\nthis the mind responds with an appetitive motion that urges us to\npursue or to avoid the object (e.g., delight or fear). But only when\nwe give our inner consent to this impulse or withhold it, does a will\nemerge that, circumstances permitting, results in a corresponding\naction. The will is the proper locus of our moral responsibility\nbecause it is neither in our power whether an object presents itself\nto our senses or intellect nor whether we take delight in it (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.74; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.21), and our\nattempts to act externally may succeed or fail for reasons beyond our\ncontrol. The only element that is in our power is our will or inner\nconsent, for which we are therefore fully responsible. Thus, a person\nwho has consented to adultery is guilty even if his attempt actually\nto commit it is unsuccessful, and a victim of rape who does not\nconsent to the deed keeps her will free of sin even if she feels\nphysical pleasure (De civitate dei 1.16\u201328). Augustine\ntherefore defines sin as \u201cthe will to keep or pursue something\nunjustly\u201d (De duabus animabus 15). The second stage in\nthe above structure, the involuntary appetitive motion of the soul, is\nreminiscent of the Stoic \u201cfirst motions\u201d, but it also\ncorresponds to the \u201cimpulse\u201d, which in Stoicism does not\nprecede consent but follows it and immediately results in action.\nTemptations of this kind are, in Augustine, not personal sins but due to\noriginal sin, and they haunt even the saints. Our will must be freed\nby divine grace to resist them (Contra Iulianum 6.70; see, on\nthis theory and its Stoic and Platonic background, Byers 2013:\n100\u2013150; J. M\u00fcller 2009: 157\u2013161; Sorabji 2000:\n372\u2013384; Rist 1994: 176\u2013177).\n\nAugustine\u2019s thinking about free will (liberum arbitrium\nor liberum voluntatis arbitrium) undergoes some development\nduring his career. In the 390s, opposing the dualistic fatalism of the\nManicheans, he uses the cogito-like argument (see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n to demonstrate that we are responsible for our volitions because we\nare as certain that we will as we are certain that we exist and think\n(De duabus animabus 13; De libero arbitrio 3.3;\nConfessiones 7.5; S. Harrison 1999). A contemporaneous\ndefinition of will as a movement of soul toward some object of desire\nemphasizes the absence of external constraint, and the ensuing\ndefinition of sin as an unjust volition (see above) seems to endorse\nthe principle of alternative possibilities (De duabus\nanimabus 14\u201315). In De libero arbitrio, free will\nappears as the condition of possibility of moral goodness and hence as\na great good itself; but as it is not an absolute good (which is God\nalone) but only an intermediate one, it is liable to misuse and,\nhence, also the source of moral evil (De libero arbitrio\n2.47\u201353). In his early exegesis of Paul\u2019s chapter on\ndivine election (Romans 9), Augustine is keen to establish that Paul\ndid not abolish free will (Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13\u201318). With all this,\nAugustine is basically in harmony with the traditional view of early\nChristian theology and exegesis, which is still adopted in the 420s by\nJulian of Aeclanum when he blames Augustine for having fallen back\ninto Manichean fatalism and quotes his early definitions against him\n(Julian, Ad Florum, in Contra Iulianum opus\nimperfectum 1.44\u201347). Things change with Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2 and the Confessiones. By c. 400 CE,\nAugustine had come to the conclusion that our ability to make choices\nwas seriously impaired by the fallen condition of humankind and that\nit made little sense to talk about free will without reference to\ngrace. The optimistic-sounding claim in the first book of De\nlibero arbitrio (1.25\u201326; 29) that it is in our power to be\ngood as soon as we choose to be good because \u201cnothing is as\ncompletely in our will as will itself\u201d was probably never the\nwhole story; already in book 3 of the same work Augustine says that\nthe cognitive and motivational deficiencies caused by Adam\u2019s sin\n(\u201cignorance and difficulty\u201d, ib. 3.52; S. Harrison 2006:\n112\u2013130) seriously compromise our natural ability to choose the\ngood, and in his later, especially anti-Pelagian work he radicalizes\nthis to the idea that original sin makes us unable to completely\nsubdue our sinful volitions as long as we live, so that we live in a\npermanent state of \u201cakrasia\u201d or weakness of will (De\nnatura et gratia 61\u201367; De civitate dei 19.4;\nDe nuptiis et concupiscentia 1.35). But he never questions\nthe principle that we have been created with the natural ability to\nfreely and voluntarily choose the good, nor does he ever deny the\napplicability of the cogito argument to the will (cf. De civitate\ndei 5.10) or doubt that our volitions are imputable to us. What\ngrace does is to restore our natural freedom; it does not compel us to\nact against our will. What this means is best illustrated by the\nnarrative of Confessiones 8 (for particularly lucid\ninterpretations, see Wetzel 1992: 126\u2013138; J. M\u00fcller 2009:\n323\u2013335). Immediately before his conversion Augustine suffers\nfrom a \u201cdivided will\u201d, feeling torn apart between the will\nto lead an ascetic Christian life and the will to continue his\nprevious, sexually active life. Though he identifies with the former,\nbetter will rather than with the latter that actually torments him, he\nis unable to opt for it because of his bad habits, which he once\nacquired voluntarily but which have by now transformed into a kind of\naddictive necessity (ib. 8.10\u201312). Earlier philosophical\ntraditions would have interpreted this \u201cakratic\u201d state as\na conflict of reason and desire, and Manichean dualism would have\nattributed Augustine\u2019s bad will to an evil substance present in\nbut foreign to the soul, but Augustine insists that both wills were\nindeed his own. Using medical metaphors reminiscent of Hellenistic\nmoral philosophy, he argues that his will lacked the power of free\nchoice because the disease of being divided between conflicting\nvolitions had weakened it (ib. 8.19; 21). His ability to choose is\nonly restored when, in the garden scene at the end of the book, his\nwill is reintegrated and healed by God\u2019s call, which immediately\nfrees him to opt for the ascetic life (ib. 8.29\u201330). Before,\nwhen he had just continued his habitual way of life, this had been a\nnon-choice rather than a choice, even though, as Augustine insists, he\nhad done so voluntarily. In substance, this remained his line of\ndefense when, in the Pelagian controversy, he was confronted with the\ncharge that his doctrine of grace abolished free will (De spiritu\net littera 52\u201360; cf. De correptione et gratia 6).\nWhile the Pelagians thought that the principle of alternative\npossibilities was indispensable for human responsibility and divine\njustice, Augustine accepts that principle only for the first humans in\nparadise (Contra Iulianum opus imperfectum 1.47; 5.28;\n5.40\u201342 etc.). In a way, by choosing wrongly Adam and Eve have\nabandoned free will both for themselves and for all humankind.\nOriginal sin transformed our initial ability not to sin into an\ninability not to sin; grace can restore ability not to sin in this\nlife and will transform it into inability to sin in the next (De\ncivitate dei 22.30; De correptione et gratia 33).\n",
