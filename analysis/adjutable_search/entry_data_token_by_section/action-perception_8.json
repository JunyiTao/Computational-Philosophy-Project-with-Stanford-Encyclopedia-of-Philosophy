Motor Component and Efferent Readiness Theories\n\nAt this point, it should be clear that the claim that perception is\nactive or action-based is far from unambiguous.\nPerceiving may implicate action in the sense that it is taken\nconstitutively to involve associations with touch (Berkeley 1709),\nkinaesthetic feedback from changes in eye position (Lotze 1887\n[1879]), consciously experienced \u201ceffort of the will\u201d\n(Helmholtz 2005 [1924]), or knowledge of the way reafferent sensory\nstimulation varies as a function of movement (Held 1961; O\u2019Regan\n& No\u00eb 2001; Hurley & No\u00eb 2003).\n\nIn this section, we shall examine two additional conceptions of the\nrole of action in perception. According to the motor component\ntheory, as we shall call it, efference copies generated in\nthe oculomotor system and/or proprioceptive feedback from\neye-movements are used in tandem with incoming sensory inputs to\ndetermine the spatial attributes of perceived objects (Helmholtz 2005\n[1924]; Mack 1979; Shebilske 1984, 1987; Ebenholtz 2002; Briscoe\n2021). Efferent readiness theories, by contrast,\nappeal to the particular ways in which perceptual states\nprepare the observer to move and act in relation to the\nenvironment. The modest readiness theory, as we shall\ncall it, claims that the way an object\u2019s spatial attributes are\nrepresented in visual experience is sometimes modulated by one or\nanother form of covert action planning (Festinger et al.\n1967; Coren 1986; Vishton et al. 2007). The bold\nreadiness theory argues for the stronger, constitutive claim\nthat, as J.G. Taylor puts its, \u201cperception and multiple\nsimultaneous readiness for action are one and the same thing\u201d\n(1968: 432).\n",
