    "main_text": "Outstanding Issues || The Problem of Partiality\n3.3 The Problem of Partiality\n\nIn addition to offering accounts of monadic evaluative properties,\nsuch as being lovable or valuable, FA theories can offer accounts of\ndyadic, comparative evaluative properties, such as those of being more\nvaluable or better than. For example, FA theorists might\nclaim that whenever x is better than y, that\u2019s\nfully because it\u2019s fitting to value x more than\ny, or to prefer x to y. Likewise, they\nmight hold that whenever x is more lovable than y,\nthat\u2019s fully because x is fitting to love more than\ny. Indeed, according to some, FA theorists should take\nmonadic properties like that of being valuable or lovable to be\nexplanatorily posterior to their comparative counterparts (Schroeder\n2010). But the problem of partiality poses potential counterexamples\nto FA theories of at least certain comparative evaluative properties,\nfor example, that of being better than. The problem, roughly, is that\nin some cases where y is no better than x\u2014or\nindeed, where x is worse than y\u2014it can seem\nfitting to be partial to x, or to prefer x to\ny. For example, suppose that either My Pal or a Stranger can\nbe rescued from drowning, but not both. And suppose also that, except\nfor the fact that My Pal is my pal and that Stranger is a stranger,\neverything else is equal. Plausibly, then, My Pal\u2019s being\nrescued is no better than Stranger\u2019s being rescued and vice\nversa\u2014the two outcomes seem equally good. Still, it can seem\nfitting for me to prefer that My Pal is rescued. Hence, it can seem\nfitting for me to prefer one outcome to another when the outcomes are\nequally good. This is the kind of example that constitutes the\npartiality problem; and instances are easily multiplied.\n\nThe partiality problem was noticed and discussed by one of the\nprogenitors of FA theory, A.C. Ewing (1939), but has only recently\ncome to occupy the attention of contemporary authors (e.g., Bykvist\n2009; Olson 2009; Lemos 2011; Zimmerman 2011; and Orsi 2013).\nImportantly, the problem seems to apply only to FA theories of\ncomparative evaluative facts that propose to explain the relevant\nfacts in terms of normative facts that call for just anyone to have a\ncertain response. For example, that it\u2019s fitting for me to\nprefer that My Pal is rescued seems problematic only for FA theories\nof betterness that propose to explain facts about what\u2019s better\nthan what by appeal to facts about what\u2019s fitting for just\nanyone to prefer (or to value more). This way of explaining the\nproperty of being better than is a natural way of capturing the\npopular and plausible idea that betterness is an agent-neutral\nevaluative property (see section 1.4). However, if we hold\ninstead\u00a0that betterness is fundamentally agent-relative, in the\nmanner of Smith (2009), then we might reject the idea that facts about\nit are to be explained always in terms of normative facts about\nwhat\u2019s fitting for just anyone to prefer (as Smith himself\ndoes). This would be one way of avoiding the partiality problem as it\napplies to FA theories of better than, though the view about\nbetterness on which it rests is controversial; by far, the majority\nview is that the property is agent-neutral.\n\nA second way of dissolving the partiality problem is suggested by\nJonas Olson (2009). On Olson\u2019s view, the partiality problem is\nstructurally the same as, and indeed a special case of, the WKR\nproblem (see section 3.1): the fact that My Pal is my pal gives me\n(some, sufficient, or decisive) reason to prefer the outcome where\nthey\u2019re saved to the outcome where Stranger is, but it\ndoesn\u2019t make the former outcome any better than the latter.\nHence, according to Olson, a solution to the WKR problem should also\nsuffice to solve the problem of partiality. On Olson\u2019s favored\nsolution to the WKR problem, FA theorists should explain evaluative\nfacts in terms of facts about fittingness rather than reasons. Olson\nsuggests that while the fact that My Pal is my pal might give me\nreason to prefer that they\u2019re rescued, this fact\ndoesn\u2019t also make this preference fitting. Hence, FA\ntheories that explain betterness in terms of what\u2019s fitting for\nall agents to prefer, rather than in terms of what there\u2019s\nreason for all agents to prefer, can avoid the problem of\npartiality.\n\nHowever, there are two worries for Olson\u2019s diagnosis of the\nproblem of partiality as an instance of the WKR problem. First,\nwhatever we might think about the plausibility of WKR skepticism as a\nsolution to the WKR problem, this view seems less plausible as a\nsolution to the problem of partiality. Even those inclined to deny\nthat the demon\u2019s threat gives you a reason to desire a cup of\nmud would likely find it hard to deny that My Pal\u2019s being my pal\ngives me a reason to prefer that they\u2019re saved. Further,\nit\u2019s not obviously incoherent for the WKR skeptic to deny that\nthe former fact is a reason while accepting that the latter one is.\nThus, the fact that WKR skepticism seems at least more viable as a\nsolution to the WKR problem than it does as a solution to the problem\nof partiality suggests that these problems aren\u2019t the same.\n\nSecond, as indicated above, it can seem plausible not only that I have\nreason to prefer that My Pal is rescued, but that, contrary to Olson,\nthis preference is fitting. This, too, would distinguish the examples\nthat constitute the problem of partiality from those that constitute\nthe WKR problem. As discussed in section 3.1, the demon\u2019s threat\nseems not to make it fitting to the value the mud\u2014it\u2019s not\na fact in virtue of which the mud merits being valued. By\ncontrast, the fact that My Pal is my pal can seem to merit my\npreferring that they\u2019re rescued; and if it does, this preference\nis fitting.\n\nBoth of these considerations put pressure on the idea that the problem\nof partiality is an instance of the WKR problem. But they also suggest\nthat, like the WKV problem (section 3.2), the problem of partiality\nmay pose a problem for certain FA theories regardless of the normative\nproperty they appeal to: Just as the fact that My Pal is my pal gives\nme a reason to prefer that they\u2019re saved, or perhaps makes it\nthe case that I should have this preference, this fact may also make\nthis preference fitting. Hence, the problem of partiality in this way\nthreatens to be a rather general problem for FA theories, specifically\nfor those that aspire to explain certain comparative evaluative\nfacts.\n\nBeyond Olson\u2019s proposal, various other solutions to the\npartiality problem have been suggested and debated (see, e.g., Lemos\n2011; Zimmerman 2011; Orsi 2013a; and Nye, Plunkett, and Ku 2015).\nHowever, it\u2019s fair to say that, so far, none has gained wide\nacceptance. Thus, the partiality problem, perhaps more so than the WKR\nproblem or the WKV problem, remains an outstanding and pressing issue\nfor FA \n theory.[9]\n",
