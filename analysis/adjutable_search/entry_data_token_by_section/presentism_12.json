    "main_text": "Truth and Truth-Making || Deny the Need for Truth-Makers\n6.2 Deny the Need for Truth-Makers\n\nRecall, the claims that generate the truth-maker objection: (i)\npresentism, (ii) there are truths about the past, and (iii)\ntruth-maker theory. By locating truth-makers for truths about the\npast, we attempt to reconcile all three claims. But another strategy\nis to simply deny (iii), to assert that truths about the past\ndon\u2019t require truth-makers.\n\nThis way of approaching matters has been mooted (e.g., Tallant 2009b;\nIngthorsson 2017), but it hasn\u2019t received a huge amount of\nsupport. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that it can be\nviewed as a partial response. We can deny that truths about the past\nrequire truth-makers, but we must go further to explain what to say\ninstead about their truth. Presumably something must be said,\nif we hope to account for them. We can\u2019t say, simply, that\ntruths about the past require no truth-makers and then say nothing\nmore about what they require. And while we might look to replace\ntruth-maker theory with something less ontologically committing,\npresentists haven\u2019t been forthcoming with an account of how\ntruths get to be true, if not by some kind of truth-making\naccount.\n",
