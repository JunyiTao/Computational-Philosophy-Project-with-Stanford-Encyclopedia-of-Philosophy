    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy and History of Philosophy\n12. Metaphilosophy and History of Philosophy\n\nIn the well known work What is Philosophy? Bolzano elucidated\nhis concept of philosophy and of philosophizing and put forward his\nview of the task of philosophy (Bolzano 1849a). Philosophizing is not\nrestricted to a certain area of knowledge, according to Bolzano. As\nsoon as you ask for reasons, you are philosophizing, and this can be\ndone in any discipline, also outside of the genuine fields of\nphilosophy. Bolzano does not conclude from this, however, as later\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap did, that there\nis no proper realm of philosophical problems and philosophical subject\nmatters. Quite to the contrary, he adhered to the traditional division\nof philosophy into subdisciplines according to the different subject\nmatters that are concerned.\n\nMoreover, Bolzano was also learned in the history of\nphilosophy; he had great historical knowledge which he injected\ninto his various works. Thus in the second edition of\nAthanasia, for instance, there is added an extensive appendix\nwith a \u201ccritical survey of the literature concerning immortality\nsince 1827\u201d, and Bolzano\u2019s essay on the concept of beauty\ncontains a detailed list of definitions of the concept of the\nbeautiful, which were proposed by a variety of philosophers (1843b,\n45\u201392); likewise the Theory of Science contains in the\nnotes a wealth of historical material, which makes it a great source\nfor the historian of logic.\n",
