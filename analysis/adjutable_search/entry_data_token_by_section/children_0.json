Can Children Philosophize?\n\nJean Piaget\u2019s (1933) well-known theory of cognitive development\nsuggests that prior to age 11 or 12, most children are not capable of\nphilosophical thinking. This is because, it holds, prior to this time,\nchildren are not capable of \u201cthinking about thinking,\u201d the\nsort of meta-level thinking that philosophical thinking requires. This\nlevel of cognitive development includes analogical reasoning about\nrelationships, such as: \u201cBicycle is to handlebars as ship is to\nrudder, with \u2018steering mechanism\u2019 being the similar\nrelationship\u201d (Goswami, p. xxi). However, there is a solid body\nof psychological research that indicates Piaget\u2019s account\nseriously underestimates children\u2019s cognitive abilities\n(Astington, 1993; Gopnik, et al., 1999; Gopnik, 2009).\n\nPhilosopher Gareth Matthews went further and argued at length that\nPiaget failed to see the philosophical thinking manifest in the very\nchildren he studied. In Philosophy and the Young Child,\nMatthews (1980) provides a number of delightful illustrations of very\nyoung children\u2019s philosophical puzzlement. For example:\n\nTIM (about six years), while busily engaged in licking a pot,\nasked, \u201cPapa, how can we be sure that everything is not a\ndream?\u201d (p. 1)\nJORDAN (five years), going to bed at eight one evening, asked,\n\u201cIf I go to bed at eight and get up at seven in the morning, how\ndo I really know that the little hand of the clock has gone around\nonly once? Do I have to stay up all night to watch it? If I look away\neven for a short time, maybe the small hand will go around\ntwice.\u201d (p. 3)\nOne day JOHN EDGAR (four years), who had seen airplanes take off,\nrise, and gradually disappear into the distance, took his first plane\nride. When the plane stopped ascending and the seat-belt sign went\nout, John Edgar turned to his father and said in a rather relieved,\nbut still puzzled, tone of voice, \u201cThings don\u2019t really get\nsmaller up here.\u201d (p. 4)\n\n\nHowever, it might be objected, commonly observable as they might be,\nmore than such anecdotes are needed to show that children are capable\nof serious philosophical thinking. What is needed is evidence that\nchildren are capable of sustained philosophical discussion.\nMatthews (1984) provides illustrations of this, too. For example,\nmeeting with a group of 8\u201311 year olds, he used the following\nexample to develop a story for discussion:\n\nIan (six years old) found to his chagrin that the three children of\nhis parents\u2019 friends monopolized the television; they kept him\nfrom watching his favorite program. \u201cMother,\u201d he asked in\nfrustration, \u201cwhy is it better for three children to be selfish\nthan one?\u201d (Matthews 1984, 92\u20133)\n\n\nThis generated a lively discussion in which children commented on the\ninconsiderateness of the three visiting children, the desirability of\nworking out a solution that would satisfy all four children, the\nimportance of respecting people\u2019s rights, and how one might feel\nif he or she were in Ian\u2019s place. Matthews then posed a possible\nutilitarian approach: \u201cWhat about this argument, that if we let\nthe three visitors have their way, three people will be made happy\ninstead of just one?\u201d One reply was that it would not be fair\nfor three people to get what they want at the expense of a fourth.\nThis triggered a discussion of fairness that addressed more specific\nconcerns about the relative ages of the children, whether they are\nfriends, siblings, or strangers\u2014and what types of television\nprograms are involved.\n\nNo doubt, part of the explanation of the children\u2019s ability and\nwillingness to carry on an extended discussion of Ian\u2019s\ncircumstance is that they have faced similar challenges. Still, they\nexhibited a rather sophisticated grasp of the conceptual and moral\nissues at hand, which is what one might expect from children once they\nare invited to reflect on their own experiences.\n\nStories about children roughly one\u2019s own age can provide\nopportunities to discuss ideas that are most important to a child.\nConsider this example from Matthew Lipman\u2019s novel Lisa\n(1983). Harry and his friend Timmy go to a stamp club to trade stamps.\nAfterward they stop for ice cream cones, but Timmy discovers he has no\nmoney. Harry offers to buy him one, and Timmy says he will buy Harry a\ncone next time. As they are leaving the store, one of their classmates\ntrips Timmy. Timmy then knocks the tripper\u2019s books off the\ntable. After running away from the scene, Timmy and Harry talk about\nwhat has happened:\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t let them get away with it,\u201d Timmy\nremarked when they saw that they weren\u2019t being pursued and could\nslow down to a walk. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to stick his foot\nout.\u201d Then he added, \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t have to do\nwhat I did either. But, like I said before, turnabout is fair\nplay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d Harry thought, \u201cit isn\u2019t quite the\nsame thing.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t figure out why. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally to Timmy. \u201cThe purpose\nof your stamp club is to exchange stamps. So when you give someone\nstamps, you\u2019re supposed to give something back. Just like if\nsomeone lends me money, I\u2019m supposed to give it back. But if\nsomeone pulls a dirty trick on you, should you do the same thing to\nhim? I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I had to get even,\u201d Timmy protested. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t let him get away with it, tripping me like that for no\nreason.\u201d\n\nA bit later they met Lisa and Laura. Harry told the girls what had\nhappened and why he was puzzled. \u201cIt reminds me,\u201d remarked\nLisa, \u201cof last year when we were learning about how some\nsentences could be turned around and would stay true, while others,\nwhen you turned them around, would become false.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry agreed, \u201cbut there we found a rule.\nWhat\u2019s the rule here?\u201d Lisa tossed her long hair so that\nit hung over her right shoulder. \u201cIt looks like there are times\nwhen it is right to give back what we got and other times when it is\nwrong. But how do we tell which is which?\u201d (Lisa, pp.\n23\u20134)\n\n\nThis passage is an invitation to explore the moral nuances of\nreciprocity, or \u201creturning in kind.\u201d What might a group of\n10\u201311 year-olds have to say about this? Here is a sampling from\na lengthy discussion of the Lisa passage by a group of fifth\ngraders (Pritchard 1996). With very little prompting from the teacher,\nthe students raised and vigorously pursued questions such as the\nfollowing:\n\nWhat is likely to happen when we retaliate? Will this simply start\na long chain of trying to \u201cget things even\u201d that no one\n(other than perhaps the initiator) wants?\nCan retaliating really \u201cget things even\u201d? Can we even\nmake sense of \u201cgetting things even\u201d?\nIs it really right to respond to a wrong by returning in kind? Is\nthis trying to make a right out of two wrongs?\nWhat alternatives to trying to \u201cget things even\u201d might\nthere be? What would happen if you just ignore someone who is trying\nto get a rise out of you?\nWhen is self-defense the best strategy?\nIs there a difference between trying to \u201cget things\neven\u201d and trying to \u201cteach someone a lesson\u201d?\nCan something like the Golden Rule help us here? What does the\nGolden Rule mean? Is it a good rule?\n\n\nThoughtful and insightful questions like this are not unusual for\nchildren when they are given the opportunity to express them.\nThis discussion was prompted by a children\u2019s novel. However,\nstudents\u2019 regular classroom materials, works of art, thought\nexperiments, the daily news, or their own experiences can trigger\nphilosophical discussions of moral concepts and concerns.\n\nEven if one concedes that children are quite capable of engaging in\nextended discussions of moral concepts related to their own\nexperiences, what about philosophical ideas that are less immediately\nrelated to their practical affairs? Here is an illustration that\nbegins with logic and ends up in metaphysics.\n\nThe true sentence, \u201cAll oaks are trees\u201d becomes false when\nreversed. So does, \u201cAll carrots are vegetables.\u201d Can we\nsay that every true sentence beginning with \u2018all\u2019\nbecomes false when reversed? The children in Harry\nStottlemeier\u2019s Discovery initially are tempted to say, yes.\nBut at least as early as the 3rd grade, children easily\nfind exceptions. What about \u201cAll tigers are tigers\u201d, many\nwill ask. Others may respond that this is an uninteresting sentence,\noffering something like \u201cAll rabbits are hares,\u201d or\n\u201cAll mothers have children\u201d as alternatives. With\nrelatively little encouragement, they can come up with good\ndefinitions of geometric figures and differentiate them from proposed\ndefinitions that cannot be reversed. For example, \u201cAll squares\nare rectangles\u201d is true, but it becomes false when reversed.\n\u201cAll squares are rectangles with equal sides,\u201d however,\ncan be reversed.\n\nAlthough the study of logic is traditionally regarded as a part of\nphilosophy, critics might not find the reflections of children on such\nrules of logic terribly interesting philosophically. (Of course, some\nmight say this about elementary logic in the college classroom, as\nwell.) It is not that different from basic math and grammar, they\nmight object. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, for many\nchildren it is but a short step from logic to metaphysics. Here is an\nexample from a 4th grade class that had just been asked\nwhether true sentences beginning with \u2018all\u2019 always become\nfalse when reversed (Pritchard 1996). After the usual \u201cAll\ntigers are tigers\u201d and \u201cAll rabbits are hares\u201d were\nsuggested, a student asked, \u201cHow about \u2018All answers have\nquestions\u2019 and \u2018All questions have answers\u2019?\u201d\nFortunately, the teacher paused to explore this with the class,\nasking\u201cDo all answers have questions?\u201d Of course, replied\nthe students, otherwise we would not say that we have an\nanswer.\n\nThe teacher continued, \u201cHow about the other sentence? Do you\nthink that all questions have answers?\u201d What followed was a\nflood of responses:\n\nStudent #1: \u201cIs there life in the center of the\nsun?\u201d\nStudent #2: \u201cEven though we can\u2019t go there to find\nout, the question still has an answer.\u201d\nStudent #3: \u201cHow many grains of sand are there on\nearth?\u201d\nStudent #4: \u201cThere\u2019s a definite number even though we\ndon\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\nStudent #3: \u201cThe wind will blow them all around, and\nwe\u2019ll count some more than once.\u201d\nStudent #5: \u201cThere are too many to count.\u201d\nStudent #6: \u201cHow many grains of sand are there on all the\nplanets?\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cHow many trees are there on earth?\u201d\nStudent #4: \u201cThat\u2019s easier than grains of sand. We\ncould count the trees.\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cBy the time you finish counting them, some\nwould have fallen down and others would have started to\ngrow.\u201d\nStudent #8: \u201cDid God make time begin?\u201d\nStudent #9: \u201cYou mean, if there is a God, did he\nmake time begin?\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cDoes space have limits?\u201d\nStudent #5: \u201cYeah, what would happen if you got to the end\nof space and tried to put your hand out? If you couldn\u2019t, what\nwould be holding it back on the outside?\u201d\nStudent #6: \u201cMaybe what would hold your hand back is on the\ninside. There wouldn\u2019t be any outside.\u201d\n\n\nMany of the students seemed to be struggling to move from questions\nthat are difficult, if not impossible, to answer because of our\npractical limitations (e.g., not being certain that a\nparticular grain of sand has not already been counted) to questions\nthat in principle are unanswerable. Finally, with a\nmischievous grin on his face, one of the students asked, \u201cWill\ntime end?\u201d The problem, he explained, is that if time did end,\nno one would be able later to confirm that this was so.\n\nHere is another illustration of how quickly a discussion of logic can\nmove to a discussion of deep philosophical issues (Pritchard, 1985).\nThis is a group of 5th graders considering the sentence,\n\u201cAll people are animals.\u201d One of the students offered this\nas another example of a true sentence that becomes false when\nreversed. Jeff objected that \u201cAll people are animals\u201d is\nnot true. Chip proceeded to develop a taxonomy that relegated people,\nalong with elephants and tigers, under the heading of mammals, mammals\nunder animals, and animals under living things. Jeff continued to\nobject.\n\n\nChip: \u201cJeff, what are people? Just tell me, what are people? You\ncan\u2019t answer that, can you?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cYes, I can.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cA person.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWhat\u2019s a person?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cA living somebody.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cA living somebody could be a whale.\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cI said, somebody, not an\nanimal\u2026.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cYou can check every single book out there in the\nlibrary\u2014well, every one that\u2019s about\nus\u2026.\u201d\n\nLarry: \u201cI want to know why everyone\u2019s getting so huffy\nabout a little subject.\u201d\n\nRich: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking! That\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nAmy: \u201cDoes anyone have an encyclopedia in here so we can look up\neither animals, mammals, or persons?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cWe\u2019re all humans. So, if this Mars guy saw us, he\nwould say, \u2018Hey, look, there\u2019s some human beings.\u2019\nHe wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, look, there\u2019s some animals\ndown there.\u2019\u201d\n\nMike: \u201cMartians, if there are any, would say, \u2018Hey, look\nat those weird looking creatures,\u2019 or something like that. They\nwouldn\u2019t know what we are. They don\u2019t know\nanything about us.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cThere\u2019s living life, okay? Then you branch off from\nthere. You have animals, plants, and whatever the other stuff\nis\u2014you know, molecules and things like that. Now you go to the\nanimals and you branch off\u2014mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and\nwhatever there is. Then you branch off and you have all these special\nhumans. Is that right so far, Jeff?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cJust go on.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWell, I just want to know if you agree so far.\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cJust go on. Go on. I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\nThat\u2019s all\u2026. I\u2019m not an animal. I\u2019m a person,\nand I\u2019m going to stay that way.\u201d\n\nAmy: \u201cPeople are a type of animal, like a bird is. That\u2019s\ndifferent than like an elephant is. A bird\u2019s different than an\nelephant. And we\u2019re different than a bird.\u201d\n\n\nThe discussion continued for several more minutes. As the group\ndispersed, one student remarked to another, \u201cIf we want to, we\ncould argue for hours!\u201d \u201cFor days,\u201d replied the\nsecond. Meeting weekly after school in the local public library, this\ngroup of children returned the next week with an encyclopedia to try\nto settle the matter. After several minutes of discussion, the teacher\nasked the students if they thought everything in the encyclopedia is\ntrue.\n\n\nEmily: \u201cSome things we\u2019re not sure of; and the\nencyclopedia could put down every word about how the solar system was\nformed, and it would probably say there was big dust that spun around\nlike a top. But we\u2019re not sure about that. And, so, that could\nbe wrong.\u201d\n\n\nThe teacher asked whether, in such cases, the encyclopedia would say,\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d\n\n\nMike: \u201cIt\u2019ll say \u2018hypothesis\u2019\u2014which is a\nguess.\u201d\n\nKurt: \u201cIt\u2019ll say we\u2019re not sure yet.\u201d\n\n\nSo, the discussion retained its philosophical vitality. This\nparticular group continued to meet weekly for the entire school year,\ndiscussing a wide range of philosophical topics, including: the\nrelationship between the mind and the brain, differences (and\nsimilarities) between dreams and reality, knowledge of other minds,\nself-knowledge, and relationships between evidence and knowledge.\n",
