Social Contexts of Practitioners\n\n\nThere were important differences between the social and\ninstitutional contexts of early philosophy and science, as well as\nimportant differences between sciences. Masters textualists were\nprivate individuals who often sought, but rarely achieved political\ninfluence. By contrast, astronomy and calendrics in particular were\nclosely linked to government and court patronage, and from Han times\non, located in the Bureau of Astronomy (Loewe 1994, Raphals 2013, Sivin\n2009).\n\n\nA closer examination of what we know of some of the early\n\u201cscientists\u201d shows close links to philosophical traditions.\nThe apocryphal founder of scientific thought in China was Zou Yan\n\u9112\u884d (305\u2013240 BCE), who is associated with the so-called\n\u201cYin-Yang school\u201d (Yin-yang jia). Zou Yan is credited with\ncombining and systematizing yin-yang and the theory of Five Agents\n(Needham 1956b: 231\u201334), but none of his works survive. Sima\nQian\u2019s biography in Shi ji 76 describes Zou Yan as a\nmember of the Jixia \u7a37\u4e0b Academy, originally from the state\nof Qi (in present day Shandong). The Jixia Academy is also associated\nwith Warring States philosophers. Figures associated with it include\nMencius, Xunzi, the Mohist philosopher Song Xing, as well as Tian Pian,\nShen Dao, Peng Meng, and possibly Zhuangzi (Needham 1956a, 93; Sato\n2003, 75\u201377). The Jixia Academy is also associated with the growth of\nHuang-Lao Daoism (Graziani 2008). According to the Shi ji\nbiography of Zou Yan:\n\nhe examined deeply into the phenomena of the increase and decrease\nof yin and yang, and wrote essays totaling more than 100,000 words\nabout their strange permutations, and about the cycles of the great\nsages from beginning to end. His sayings were vast and far-reaching,\nand not in accord with the accepted beliefs of the classics. First he\nhad to examine small objects, and from these he drew conclusions about\nlarge ones, until he reached what was without limit. First he spoke\nabout modern times, and from this he went back to the time of Huang Di.\nThe scholars all studied his arts. Moreover he followed the great\nevents in the rise and fall of ages, and by means of their omens and\n(an examination into their systems), extended his survey (still\nfurther) backwards to the time when the heavens and the earth had not\nyet been born, (in fact) to what was profound and abstruse and\nimpossible to investigate.\n\nHe began by classifying China\u2019s notable mountains, great\nrivers and connecting valleys; its birds and beasts; the fruitfulness\nof its water and soils, and its rare products; and from this extended\nhis survey to what is beyond the seas, and men are unable to observe.\nThen starting from the time of the separation of the Heavens and the\nEarth, and coming down, he made citations of the revolutions and\ntransmutations of the Five Powers (Virtues), arranging them until each\nfound its proper place and was confirmed (by history). (Shi ji\nch 76, slightly modified from Needham 1956b, 232\u201333).\n\n\n\nOn this account, Zou Yan's interests included both the\n\u201cclassical\u201d learning of the Masters traditions and direct\ninquiry into natural phenomena, large and small. While this account\ngives no indication of specific direct contact between Zou and Masters\ntextualists, it does suggest that the Jixia Academy patronized a range\nof thinkers who included what we would today call both philosophers and\npractitioners of the early sciences.\n\n\nThe Han shu describes Zou Yan as a \u201cRecipe\nMaster\u201d or fang shi \u65b9\u58eb. This term was\napplied to a wide range of practitioners of medical, mantic and\ntechnical arts. (The titles of their mostly lost works are listed\nin the shu shu and fang ji sections of the Han\nshu Bibliographic Treatise, discussed above.) Fang\nshi practiced divination and claimed to possess secret texts and\nformulae. They gained great influence during the earlier part of the\nHan dynasty, though their influence waned by the later Han (Kalinowski\n2010; Ngo 1976). They used yin-yang and Five Agents cosmology, and seem\nto have originated from the Shandong peninsula. They were particularly\nassociated with the mantic arts, including the use of the sexagenary\ncycle of stems and branches, the Yi jing, and divination by\nstars, dreams, physiognomy, the winds, and by the use of pitch pipes\n(Li Ling 1993, 2000). The fang shi became an important\nforce in the Han court during the reign of Han Wu Di (r. 141\u201329 BCE),\nbut their origins are probably much older. Practices\nattributed to them have clear antecedents in Warring States\nphilosophical texts such as the Zhuangzi and the \u201cInner\nCultivation\u201d (Nei ye) chapter of the\nGuanzi.\n\n\nReferences to their presence in the court of Qin Shi\nHuang\u79e6\u59cb\u7687 (259\u2013210 BCE), who ruled Qin from\n246 to 221. They remained influential to the early part of the Six\nDynasties (to the fourth century CE). Most came from outlying\nregions, and gained influence for their skills in medicine,\nastronomical prediction and omen interpretation, all of which were\nlinked to the growth of science in early China. They used\nmagico-medical practices on behalf of the health and vitality of the\nemperor, but also introduced standardized measurement of time, space,\nweight, and musical pitch.\n\n\nAn important source for our knowledge of their interests and expertise\nis the collected biographies of fang shi are recorded in\nthe Standard History of the Later Han (Hou Han shu)\nunder the heading \u201cFang Techniques\u201d (fang shu\n\u65b9\u8853). The preface lists their expertise and interests as:\nfate calculation and prognostication, including astrology and the\nprediction of eclipses), medicine and a variety of magical\npractices. Over half of the fifty-seven specialists listed in the\ncollected biography (twenty-nine) practiced some form of astrology\n(biographies 1, 11, 12,16, 18\u201320, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30\u201333,\n35, 38\u201341, 43\u201346, 49, 51\u201353 and 55, as listed in\nKalinowski 2010, 359\u201366).  But they were also credited with\nexpertise in classical texts and in Huang-Lao and Daoist\nlore. (Hou Han shu 82A and 82B. Most of these techniques date\nfrom the late Zhou. See Li Ling 1995 and Kalinowski 2010, especially\nAppendix 2.)\n\n\nIn summary, although Masters textualists and fang shi had\nsome areas of overlapping expertise and interest, their practices and\ntextual lineages diverged in very different directions.\n",
