    "main_text": "The Dynamic and the Static Theory\n8. The Dynamic and the Static Theory\n\nMany of the above considerations\u2014especially those about\nMcTaggart\u2019s Argument; the A-theory and the B-theory; presentism,\neternalism, and the growing block theory; and the dispute between\nthree-dimensionalism and four-dimensionalism\u2014suggest that there\nare, generally speaking, two very distinct ways of thinking about the\nnature of time. The first is the Static Theory of Time, according to\nwhich time is like space, and there is no such thing as the passage of\ntime; and the second is the Dynamic Theory of Time, according to which\ntime is very different from space, and the passage of time is a real\nphenomenon. These two ways of thinking about time are not the only\nsuch ways, but they correspond to the two most popular combinations of\nviews about time to be found in the literature, which are arguably the\nmost natural combinations of views on these issues. In this section we\nwill spell out these two popular combinations, mainly as a way to\nsynthesize much of the preceding material, and also to allow the\nreader to appreciate in a big-picture way how the different disputes\nabout the nature of time are normally taken to be interrelated.\n\nThe guiding thought behind the Static Theory of Time is that time is\nlike space. Here are six ways in which this thought is typically\nspelled out. (Note: The particular combination of these six theses is\na natural and popular combination of related claims. But it is not\ninevitable. It is also possible to mix and match from among the tenets\nof the Static Theory and its rival, the Dynamic Theory.)\n\n\nThe Static Theory of Time\n\nThe universe is spread out in four similar dimensions, which\ntogether make up a unified, four-dimensional manifold, appropriately\ncalled spacetime.\nAny physical object that is located at different times has a\ndifferent temporal part for each moment at which it is located.\nThere are no genuine and irreducible A-properties; all talk that\nappears to be about A-properties can be correctly analyzed in terms of\nB-relations. Likewise, the temporal facts about the world include\nfacts about B-relations, but they do not include any facts about\nA-properties.\nThe correct ontology does not change over time, and it always\nincludes objects from every region of spacetime.\nPropositions have truth values simpliciter rather than at\ntimes, and so cannot change their truth values over time. Also, we can\nin principle eliminate verbal tenses like is, was,\nand will be from an ideal language.\nThere is no dynamic aspect to time; time does not pass.\n\n\n\nStatic Theorists of course admit that time seems special to\nus, and that it seems to pass. But they insist that this is just a\nfeature of consciousness\u2014of how we perceive the world\u2014and\nnot a feature of reality that is independent of us.\n\nThe second of the main ways of thinking about time is the Dynamic\nTheory of Time. The guiding thought behind this way of thinking is\nthat time is very different from space. Here are six ways in which\nthis thought is typically spelled out. (Note: The particular\ncombination of these six theses is a natural and popular combination\nof related claims. But, like the Static Theory, it is not inevitable.\nIt is also possible to mix and match from among the tenets of the\nDynamic Theory and the Static Theory.)\n\n\nThe Dynamic Theory of Time\n\nThe universe is spread out in the three dimensions of physical\nspace, and time, like modality, is a completely different kind of\ndimension from the spatial dimensions.\nAny physical object that is located at different times is wholly\npresent at each moment at which it is located.\nThere are genuine and irreducible A-properties, which cannot be\ncorrectly analyzed in terms of B-relations. The temporal facts about\nthe world include ever-changing facts involving A-properties,\nincluding facts about which times are past, which time is present, and\nwhich times are future.\nThe correct ontology changes over time, and it is always true that\nonly present objects exist.\nPropositions have truth values at times rather than\nsimpliciter and can, in principle, change their truth values\nover time. Also, we cannot eliminate verbal tenses like is,\nwas, and will be from an ideal language.\nThe passage of time is a real and mind-independent\nphenomenon.\n\n\n\nOpponents of the Dynamic Theory (and sometimes proponents as well)\nlike to characterize the theory using the metaphor of a moving\nspotlight that slides along the temporal dimension, brightly\nilluminating just one moment of time, the present, while the future is\na foggy region of potential and the past is a shadowy realm of what\nhas been. The moving spotlight is an intuitively appealing way to\ncapture the central idea behind the Dynamic Theory, but in the end, it\nis just a metaphor. What the metaphor represents is the idea that\nA-properties like being future, being present, and\nbeing past are objective and metaphysically significant\nproperties of times, events, and things. Also, the metaphor of the\nmoving spotlight represents the fact that, according to the Dynamic\nTheory, each time undergoes a somewhat peculiar but inexorable\nprocess, sometimes called temporal becoming. It goes from\nbeing in the distant future to the near future, has a brief moment of\nglory in the present, and then recedes forever further and further\ninto the past.\n\nDespite its being intuitively appealing (especially for Static\nTheorists, who see it as a caricature of the Dynamic Theory), the\nmoving spotlight metaphor has a major drawback, according to some\nproponents of the Dynamic Theory: it encourages us to think of time as\na fourth dimension, akin to the dimensions of space. For many\nproponents of the Dynamic Theory, this way of\nthinking\u2014\u201cspatializing time\u201d\u2014is a mistake.\nInstead, we should take seriously the ways that time seems completely\ndifferent from the dimensions of space\u2014for instance,\ntime\u2019s apparent directionality, and the distinctive ways that\ntime governs experience.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Hawley 2001; Lewis\n1986; Markosian 1993; Markosian 2004; Markosian (forthcoming); Moss\n2012; Price 1977; Prior 1967; Prior 1968; Sider 2001; Smart 1949;\nSullivan 2012a; Thomson 1983; and Williams 1951.\n",
