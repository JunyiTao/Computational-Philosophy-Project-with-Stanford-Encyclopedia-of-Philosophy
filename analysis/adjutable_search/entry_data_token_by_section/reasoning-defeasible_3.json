    "main_text": "Applications and Motivation\n2. Applications and Motivation\n\nPhilosophers and theorists of artificial intelligence have found a\nwide variety of applications for defeasible reasoning. In some cases,\nthe defeasibility seems to be grounded in some aspect of the subject\nor the context of communication, and in other cases in facts about the\nobjective world. The first includes defeasible rules as communicative\nor representational conventions and autoepistemic (reasoning\nabout one\u2019s own knowledge and lack of knowledge). The latter,\nthe objective sources of defeasibility, include defeasible\nobligations, defeasible laws of nature, induction, abduction, and\nOckham\u2019s razor (the presumption that the world is as\nuncomplicated as possible).\n",
