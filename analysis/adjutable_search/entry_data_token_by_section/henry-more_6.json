    "main_text": "Kabbalism and Quakerism\n7. Kabbalism and Quakerism\n\nIn October 1670 More was visited at Cambridge by Francis Mercury van\nHelmont (1614\u20131698), son of the famous iatrochemist, Jan\nBaptista van Helmont (1579\u20131644), and a student of Jewish\nKabbalah. More asked van Helmont if he would visit Anne, Lady Conway,\nwith a view to trying to treat the incessant debilitating headache\nwhich had troubled her for many years. As a result of meeting Anne,\nvan Helmont became her resident physician, living at Ragley Hall in\nWarwickshire, where More himself was a frequent visitor. Van Helmont\nwas a friend and collaborator of the leading Christian cabbalist of\nthe day, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1631\u20131689), and More now\nhad the opportunity to learn about the Jewish Kabbalah. It should be\nnoted that although his own version of the cabbala, as published in\nhis Conjectura Cabbalistica (1653), was nothing more than a\nmethod of scriptural interpretation of his own invention, More\nnevertheless felt that the original Jewish Kabbalah, deriving\nultimately from Moses, was the true source of the philosophical\ntheology which More had managed to \u201creconstruct\u201d.\n\nIt came as quite a shock to More, therefore, to learn through van\nHelmont and through correspondence with von Rosenroth that the\nKabbalah, as developed especially by the leading sixteenth-century\nKabbalist, Isaac Luria (1534\u20131572), was a long way from what he\nhad imagined. Its \u201cinvincible obscurity\u201d was distasteful\nto More\u2019s rationalist sensibilities, and he also discerned\nmonistic materialism in it, and even identification of God with\nnature. More\u2019s critical writings on Lurianic Kabbalah were\nincluded by von Rosenroth in his Kabbala denudata of 1677,\nand included by More in his Opera omnia in 1679 (Coudert\n1992, Crocker 2003, Laerke 2017).\n\nUnfortunately for More, his failure to be convinced by the spiritual\nworth of mystical Kabbalah contributed to an increasing distance\nbetween him and his great friend Anne Conway. Van Helmont had become\ninterested in Quakerism and introduced Anne to a number of leading\nQuakers, including George Fox (1624\u20131691), Robert Barclay\n(fl. 1670), George Keith (1638?\u20131716), and William Penn\n(1644\u20131718). Evidently the Quakers favoured the Kabbalah and\nAnne, increasingly favoured the Quakers. During this time Anne was\nwriting her own philosophical system which was published posthumously\nas The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy\n(1690 in Latin, 1692 in English). It is essentially a monistic system\nin which all things are made of spirit, and she criticises during the\ncourse of it not only the materialism of Hobbes and Spinoza, but also\nthe dualism of Descartes, and her erstwhile mentor, More (Conway 1996,\nHutton 2004). It seems clear that Anne was growing intellectually, and\nspiritually, away from More, and seems to have regarded her new Quaker\nfriends, a number of whom evidently now colonised Ragley Hall, as\ncloser to her own developing beliefs. A letter from Lord Conway of\n1677 even says that the Quakers in the Hall \u201chave free access to\nmy wife, but I believe Dr. More, though he was in the house all the\nlast summer, did not see her above twice or thrice\u201d (Nicolson\n1992, 439\u201340). More himself during this period seems to have\nbeen torn between trying to dissuade her from joining the Quakers, and\nrespect for Anne\u2019s carefully thought-out decision to embrace\ntheir teachings. Indeed, More even showed a grudging respect for the\nQuakers themselves, who were obviously serious and sincere, and in\nsome respects their enthusiasms matched his own tendencies in that\ndirection.\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting also that John Finch, More\u2019s former\nstudent and Anne\u2019s half-brother, also moved away from\nMore\u2019s way of thinking at this time. During his time in Turkey\nas a diplomat (1674\u20131681), Finch wrote a large manuscript\nTreatise of natural philosophy which remains unpublished.\nFinch\u2019s philosophy is materialist and based on an empiricist\nepistemology, and is highly critical of many of More\u2019s views.\nRejecting More\u2019s dualism, Finch takes an almost Hobbesian line,\nbut couples it with fideism in religion: we cannot prove the existence\nof God or immaterial substances by the use of reason and so must trust\nin the Gospels (Crocker 2003).\n\nIf nothing else, the fact that two such close admirers of More as John\nFinch and Anne Conway both came to reject his philosophy shows not\nonly that his philosophy was not as cogent and compelling as he\nthought, but also that his attempt to use philosophy in the service of\nreligion was increasingly seen (as it was by Joseph Beaumont, Samuel\nParker, John Beale, Robert Boyle, and others) as not only\nunconvincing, but even subversive of sound religion. Indeed it has\nrecently been suggested (Leech 2013) that More\u2019s determined\nefforts to provide a supposedly unassailable philosophical theology\nunintentionally contributed to disaffection with religion, and the\nrise of secularism and even atheism. If More\u2019s vigorously\nproposed philosophical theology, with its claims about souls, spirits,\nspace, and so forth, could be equally vigorously denied by his fellow\nreligionists, the contemporary onlooker could hardly be blamed for\ndeveloping a sceptical response to religion in general. The inability\nof religious believers to agree among themselves as to what is the\n\u201ctrue\u201d religion has been seen as a major factor in the\nrise of secularism, and has been dubbed \u201ctheological\nfratricide\u201d. Ironically, it was the passion and persistence with\nwhich More promoted his own version of philosophical theology which\nled to him being a prominent (though unwitting) participant in that\n\u201cfratricide\u201d (Leech 2013, 8, 233).\n",
