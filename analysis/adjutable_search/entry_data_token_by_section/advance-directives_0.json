    "main_text": "The orthodox legal view\n1. The orthodox legal view\n\n\nIn legal contexts, two general standards or approaches to question\nQ2 have been developed:\n\n\nThe Substituted Judgment standard: The surrogate's task is to\nreconstruct what the patient himself would have wanted, in the\ncircumstances at hand, if the patient had decision-making capacity.\nSubstantive advance directives are here thought of as a helpful\nmechanism for aiding the application of Substituted Judgment. The\nmoral principle underlying this legal standard is the principle of\n respect\n for \n autonomy,\n supplemented by the idea that when a patient is not currently capable\nof making a decision for himself, we can nonetheless respect his\nautonomy by following or reconstructing, as best we can, the\nautonomous decision he would have made if he were able. In a subset\nof cases, a substituted judgment can implement an actual earlier\ndecision of the patient, made in anticipation of the current\ncircumstances; this is known as precedent autonomy.\n\nThe Best Interests standard: The surrogate is to decide based\non what, in general, would be good for the\npatient. The moral principle underlying this standard is the principle of\n beneficence.\nThis legal standard has traditionally assumed a quite generic view of\ninterests, asking what a \"reasonable\" person would want under the\ncircumstances and focusing on general goods such as freedom from pain,\ncomfort, restoration and/or development of the patient's physical and\nmental capacities. This is because the Best Interests standard has\nmainly been employed when there is little or no information about the\npatient's specific values and preferences. However, the concept of\nbest interests is simply the concept of what is best for the\nperson. There is no reason why, in principle, the Best Interests\njudgment could not be as nuanced and individual as the best theory of\n well-being\n dictates.\n\n\n\nIn practice, the main difference between the two standards is often\nthought to be this. Substituted Judgment endeavors to reconstruct the\nsubjective point of view of the patient \u2014 i.e., the patient's\nown view of his interests \u2014 whenever such reconstruction is a\nviable possibility. By contrast, the Best Interests standard allows\nfor a more generic view of interests, without having to rely on the\nidiosyncratic values and preferences of the patient in question.\n\nThe applicability of these standards depends on the context in which\nthe lack of decision-making capacity occurs. Let us distinguish two\ngroups of patients:\n\n\nFormerly Competent: Patients who used to have the relevant\n decision-making capacity,\n but lost it, for example, due to Alzheimer's disease or\nother medical problems (or procedures such as surgical anesthesia)\nundermining normal brain functioning.\n\nNever-been Competent: Patients who have never had the\nrelevant decision-making capacity, either because the capacity has not\nyet developed (as in children), or because of a permanent brain\ndeficiency such as severe congenital mental retardation.\n\n\n\nThe Substituted Judgment standard seems well-suited to the\ncircumstances of the formerly competent patients since, in their case,\nthere are past values or patterns of decision-making that could\npotentially serve as a basis for the reconstructed decision on the\npatient's behalf. Furthermore, according to the current orthodoxy,\nprevalent especially in the law, Substituted Judgment is the preferred\nsolution for formerly competent patients because it promises to preserve respect for\n autonomy\n as an overriding moral consideration trumping concerns with\n beneficence.\nThe picture is this. If, ordinarily, we ought to respect patient\nautonomy rather than impose our own judgments on patients, we ought to\nrespect autonomy even after the patient has lost decision-making\ncapacity; and we can do so by following or reconstructing, as best we\ncan, the autonomous decision the patient would have made himself when\nfaced with the current circumstances. In short, in dealing with\nsomeone who used to be competent, the widely accepted primacy of\nrespect for autonomy over beneficence calls for Substituted\nJudgment. And this means that we should use the Substituted Judgment\nstandard whenever possible and fall back on the Best Interests\nstandard only when we lack sufficient information about the patient's\nprior wishes and values to make Substituted Judgment practicable.\n\n\nBy contrast, for the \u201cnever-been competent\u201d patients, the\nSubstituted Judgment standard does not seem applicable (e.g., Cantor 2005):\nif the patient has never been able to make autonomous decisions in\ncircumstances such as the current one, it seems impossible to\nreconstruct what the patient's decision would have been. For these\npatients, the Best Interests standard is the only option.\n\n\nWhen combined, these orthodox views generate one unified simple\nordering of priority among the several standards and mechanisms for\nsurrogate decision-making, an ordering found in answers to Q2 and Q2a\nprevailing in the literature (e.g., Brock 1995):\n\nHonor a substantive advance directive, as an aid to Substituted\nJudgment, whenever such directive is available.\nAbsent\nan advance directive, apply the Substituted Judgment standard based on\navailable information about the patient's past decisions and\nvalues.\nIf you cannot apply the Substituted Judgment standard \u2014 either because\nthe patient has never been competent or because information about the\npatient's former wishes and values is unavailable \u2014 use the Best\nInterests standard.\n\n\n\nIs this orthodox view correct?\n",
