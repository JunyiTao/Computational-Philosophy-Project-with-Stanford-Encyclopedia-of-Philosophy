    "main_text": "\n\nOver the past decades, political philosophers and applied ethicists\nhave been increasingly interested in the value of personal\nrelationships. The goods they generate\u2014or, perhaps, of which\nthey consist\u2014are obviously important, both instrumentally and\nnon-instrumentally, for how well individuals\u2019 lives go on\nvarious accounts of what makes a life good: They are highly desired by\nmost people, can bring a lot of pleasure and joy and, at least some of\nthem\u2014such as friendship or love\u2014have objective value. More\nrecently, these goods have also been said to be relevant to\ndetermining individuals\u2019 duties and even rights. In particular,\nthere are several reasons to be concerned with their distribution:\nPersonal relationship goods represent a significant and\nnon-substitutable component of individuals\u2019 well-being, are a\nsignificant kind of personal resource as well as a major determinant\nof individuals\u2019 opportunities.\n\nIt seems important to ensure that all individuals enjoy these goods to\na sufficient, or perhaps equal, degree. Theories of\njustice\u2014which have for a long time been mostly preoccupied with\nthe distribution of material goods\u2014started to show interest in\nthe distribution of personal relationship goods. And yet, the claims\nthat there are duties of justice to distribute them and that states\nare (amongst) the bearers of such duties raise several problems.\n",
