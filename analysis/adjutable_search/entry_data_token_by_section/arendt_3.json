Arendt\u2019s Theory of Action\n\n\nArendt\u2019s theory of action and her revival of the ancient notion of\npraxis represent one of the most original contributions to\ntwentieth century political thought. By distinguishing action\n(praxis) from fabrication (poiesis), by linking it\nto freedom and plurality, and by showing its connection to speech and\nremembrance, Arendt is able to articulate a conception of politics in\nwhich questions of meaning and identity can be addressed in a fresh\nand original manner. Moreover, by viewing action as a mode of human\ntogetherness, Arendt is able to develop a conception of participatory\ndemocracy which stands in direct contrast to the bureaucratized and\nelitist forms of politics so characteristic of the modern epoch.\n\n\nIn what follows, we focus on some of the key components of\nArendt\u2019s theory of action, such as freedom, plurality and\ndisclosure. We then examine the links between action and narrative,\nthe importance of remembrance, and of what may be called\n\u201ccommunities of memory.\u201d We then show the connection\nbetween action, power and the space of appearance. Lastly, we look at\nthe remedies for the unpredictability and irreversibility of action,\nnamely, the power of promise and the power to forgive.\n",
