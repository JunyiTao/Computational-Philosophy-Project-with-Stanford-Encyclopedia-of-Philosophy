    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || Early natural law theorists\n3.1 Early natural law theorists\n\nIn the writings of the early natural law theorists, Greek views of\nvirtue sometimes came under strong criticism. Hugo Grotius\n(1583\u20131645), for example, objected to Aristotle\u2019s approach\nto virtue and especially to his attempts to find a mean in terms of\nwhich to understand justice. It does not matter, Grotius complained,\nwhat moves someone to act unjustly \u2013 the only thing that matters\nis that unjust action violates the rights of others. Grotius\nacknowledged that one may develop emotional habits that support right\naction, but he thought this was a matter of having reason control\npassions and emotions so that they do not interfere with right action.\nThat reason should control passions indicates that the desired state\nis for one part of us to rule the other, not for both parts, in\nAristotle\u2019s words, to speak with the same voice. On this view,\nmoral character is a state closer to what the Greeks considered\nself-mastery or continence than it is to what they considered virtue.\n\n\nEven though the natural law theorists tended to assimilate virtue to\ncontinence, they still admitted that that there was an area of moral\nlife in which motive and character mattered. That was the area of\n\u201cimperfect duty\u201d (as contrasted with \u201cperfect\nduty\u201d). Under a perfect duty what is owed is specific and\nlegally enforceable by political society or courts; but action in\naccord with imperfect duty cannot be compelled, and what is owed under\nan imperfect duty is imprecise. Generosity is an example of the\nlatter, justice of the former. In the case of generosity, one has a\nduty to be generous, but one cannot be legally compelled to be\ngenerous, and when or how generosity is shown is not precisely\nspecifiable. But in the case of generosity, the motive of the agent\ncounts. For if I give money to a poor person I encounter on the street\nand do so because I want others to think well of me, I have not acted\ngenerously and performed my imperfect duty. When I give generously, I\nmust do so out of concern for the good of the person to whom I give\nthe money.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Grotius and the natural law theorists,\nand of the modern developments Anscombe attacked, see Schneewind\n(1990, 1998). For a discussion of the persistence of Aristotelian\nethics in the early modern period and a response to Schneewind, see\nFrede (2013).\n",
