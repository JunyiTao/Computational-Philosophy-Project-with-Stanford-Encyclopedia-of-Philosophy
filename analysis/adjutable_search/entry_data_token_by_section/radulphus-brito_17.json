    "main_text": "Ethics || Human Freedom, Free Will and Responsibility\n7.3 Human Freedom, Free Will and Responsibility\n\nBrito\u2019s accounts of human freedom and moral responsibility\nheavily depend on Godfrey of Fontaines. Godfrey, a theology master, is\nthe author of an important set of quodlibetal questions, where he\noffers a strongly intellectualist account of the psychology of human\nacts (or of free agency). After Aquinas\u2019 death in 1274, two main\nnotions of human agency were opposed, especially among theologians. On\nthe one hand, voluntarist theologians proposed that intellect and will\nare the two main faculties of the intellectual soul, with the\nintellect being a cognitive power, and the will an active, or dynamic,\npower. Since the perfection of the will is greater than that of the\nintellect, will is the main agent of human action. Intellectual\nknowledge is only a condition sine qua non of free action. In\nother words, the intellect\u2019s function is merely to present to\nthe will the objects of action. On the other hand, as a critical\nresponse to voluntarism, intellectualism proposes that the\nintellect\u2019s main function is to act responsibly. Thus,\nintellectualist theologians, such as Godfrey, hold that the\nintellect\u2019s function is not only to present to the will the\nobjects of action, but also to judge about the good and evil of\npossible actions. Moreover, voluntarist theologians consider will to\nbe an active power, whereas the intellectualists consider it a passive\none insofar as it is moved by the judgment it receives from the\nintellect. Accordingly, voluntarist theologians raise against the\nintellectualists the charge of determinism, since in the\nlatter\u2019s position, the will\u2019s action would not be properly\nfree. On the other hand, intellectualist theologians reject the\nvoluntarists\u2019 consideration of will as a cognitive power, as it\nwould perform the intellect\u2019s judgment about good and evil.\n\nFor Brito, free will (liberum arbitrium) depends entirely on\nintellectual judgment:\n\n\nWhen something appears to the will as a good, the will desires it,\nuntil deliberation and the intellect\u2019s judgment make something\nelse to appear as being better. Thus, when the will is brought towards\na good object, it doesn\u2019t pursue it immediately, but it first\ndeliberates about its contrary, its consequences, its accidents and\ncircumstances, and so the discourse of reason can make something,\nwhich appeared as good, appear as evil. And this is how free will\nworks. (QEN 60; QE-2008: 322)\n\n\nBrito thinks that the will necessarily desires something that appears\nas good. If there were no means to restrain the will, this would\ncertainly be a form of determinism. However, for Brito, the intellect\nhas the power to restrain the will. By deliberating about the extent\nto which the object is good, the intellect can eventually come upon\nnegative aspects in it and obstruct the action of the will. \n",
