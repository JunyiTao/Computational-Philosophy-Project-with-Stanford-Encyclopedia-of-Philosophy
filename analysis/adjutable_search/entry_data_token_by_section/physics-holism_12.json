    "main_text": "Quantum Field Theory\n13. String Theory\n\nString theory (or its descendant, M-theory) has\nemerged as a speculative candidate for unifying much of fundamental\nphysics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Existing\nstring theories proceed by quantizing classical theories of basic\nentities that are extended in one or more dimensions of a space that\nhas 6 or 7 tiny compact dimensions in addition to the three spatial\ndimensions of ordinary geometry. If these additional dimensions are\nappropriately considered spatial, then it is natural to extend the\nconcepts of\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal\n separability to encompass them. In that case, processes involving\nclassical strings (or p-branes with \\(p \\gt 0\\))\nwould count as (spatiotemporally) nonseparable, even though all\nparticles and their properties conform to spatial separability.\n\nThe status of\n nonseparability\n within a quantized string field theory is not so easy to assess,\nbecause of the general problems associated with deciding what the\nontology of any relativistic quantum field theory should be taken to\nbe.\n",
