Something like this position seems to be\nthe one Williams adopts in his (1993) \u201cPostscript\u201d to\n\u201cMoral Luck,\u201d for example.\n4.1.1 Denying Moral Luck and Preserving the Centrality of Morality\n\nLet us begin with the first and larger group of those who embrace the\napproach of denying the existence of moral luck. One of their main\ntasks is to explain away the appearance of moral luck. A second main\ntask is to paint a plausible and coherent picture of morality that\navoids luck.\n\nAn important tool for those who wish to explain away the existence of\nmoral luck is what Latus (2000) calls the \u201cepistemic\nargument\u201d (see Richards, Rescher, Rosebury, and Thomson). To see\nhow it goes, let us begin by focusing on resultant luck. Why do we\nfeel differently about the successful and unsuccessful murderers?\nBecause, according to the epistemic argument, we rarely know exactly\nwhat a person\u2019s intentions are or the strength of her commitment\nto a course of action. One (admittedly fallible) indicator is whether\nshe succeeds or not. In particular, if someone succeeds, that is some\nevidence that the person was seriously committed to carrying out a\nfully formed plan. The same evidence is not usually available when the\nplan is not carried out. Thus, rather than indicating our commitment\nto cases of resultant moral luck, our differential treatment of\nsuccessful and unsuccessful murderers indicates our different\nepistemic situations with respect to each. If we were in the\nunrealistic situation of knowing that both agents had exactly the same\nintentions, the same strength of commitment to their plans, and so on,\nthen we would no longer be inclined to treat them differently. Thomson\nrepresents a number of those who employ this strategy when she asks,\n\u201cWell do we regard Bert [a negligent driver who causes\na death] with an indignation that would be out of place in respect to\nCarol [an equally negligent driver who does not]? Even after we have\nbeen told about how bad luck figured in his history and good luck in\nhers?\u201d And Thomson answers: \u201cI do not find it in myself to\ndo so\u201d (1993, 205). Not everyone shares this intuition, however,\nas we will see in the next section.\n\nThe epistemic argument can be extended to circumstantial luck.\nConsider again the Nazi sympathizer, and a counterpart who moved in\n1929 to Argentina on business. The counterpart has exactly the same\ndispositions as the Nazi sympathizer, but lives a quiet and harmless\nlife in Argentina. According to this line of reasoning, while it is\ntrue that the counterpart is not responsible for the same\ndeeds as the Nazi sympathizer, he should be judged precisely for what\nhe would have done. Richards argues that we do judge people for what\nthey would have done, but that what they do is often our strongest\nevidence for what they would have done. As a result, given\nour limited knowledge, we might not be entitled to treat the\ncounterpart in the same way as the Nazi sympathizer, even though they\nare equally morally deserving of such treatment (Richards 1986, 174\nff.). Thus, circumstantial luck, like resultant luck, affects the\nbasis available to us when we judge agents, but does not affect what\nthose agents deserve.\n\nIt is hard to see how the argument can be extended further to cover\nconstitutive or causal luck. But even if the epistemic argument is\nlimited in this way, it can still be part of a good overall strategy\nof responding to the problem of moral luck insofar as it is possible\nto take a mix-and-match approach to different kinds of luck.\n\nA second strategy for explaining away the appearance of moral luck is\nmost naturally applied to resultant luck. Those who adopt this\nstrategy argue that it is understandable or even appropriate to feel\ndifferently about the driver who kills a child than about the one who\ndoes not. What is not appropriate is to offer different moral\nassessments of their behavior (e.g., Rosebury, Richards, Wolf,\nThomson).\n\nWilliams elucidates a notion of \u201cagent-regret,\u201d a\nsentiment whose \u201cconstitutive thought\u201d is a\nsubject\u2019s first-person thought that it would have been much\nbetter had she done otherwise. Agent regret also requires a certain\nsort of expression that is different from that of what we might call\n\u201cbystander regret.\u201d For example, it might include the\nwillingness to compensate a person who was harmed by one\u2019s\nactions. In the case of a lorry driver who, through no fault of his\nown, runs over a child, Williams writes, \u201cwe feel sorry for the\ndriver, but that sentiment co-exists with, indeed presupposes, that\nthere is something special about his relation to this happening,\nsomething which cannot merely be eliminated by the consideration that\nit was not his fault\u201d (1976 [1993b, 43]).\n\nIt is possible to take this thought still further and argue that it is\nreasonable to expect and perhaps even demand that one who\nkills the child respond in a different way from the other. For\nexample, Wolf argues that there is a \u201cnameless virtue\u201d\nwhich consists in \u201ctaking responsibility for one\u2019s actions\nand their consequences\u201d (2001, 13). It is the virtue of taking\nresponsibility in some sense for the consequences of one\u2019s\nactions, even if one is not responsible for them. In some ways it is\nakin to the virtue of generosity in that it \u201cinvolves a\nwillingness to give more\u2026that justice requires\u201d (14). To\ntake another example, Richards suggests that we often have negative\nfeelings about those who cause harm, even when we realize that they\nare not deserved, and that these can be feelings we ought to have. For\nexample, it ought to be distressing for a parent to encounter a girl\nwho accidentally dropped your baby, even if you know that no one could\nhave held on (1986, 178\u201379). The feelings that both agents and\nobservers naturally do or even ought to have can easily be confused\nwith judgments that commit us to the existence of moral luck. Yet once\nwe distinguish these legitimate feelings from moral judgments, we can\nand should eliminate the judgments that entail a commitment to moral\nluck. Again, this strategy is most naturally applied to resultant\nluck.\n\nRecently, critics of this strategy have objected to it on a variety of\ngrounds. For example, it has been argued against Wolf\u2019s view, in\nparticular, that once we acknowledge the  appropriateness  of\ngreater self-blame in cases of greater harm, no good reason for\ndenying moral luck remains, and indeed we have good reason for\naccepting it. (See Moore 2009, 31 ff.) It has also been argued that\nWolf\u2019s description of our phenomenology is at best incomplete:\nit is not merely that we wish people to blame themselves more when\nthey cause greater harm, but that we judge them to be more\nblameworthy. Our judgments of greater responsibility also require\nexplaining away. (See Domsky 2004.)\n\nA variant of this strategy employs the idea that one can justify\ndifferential treatment of, say, the negligent driver who hits\na child and one who does not, even if both are equally morally\nblameworthy. For example, Henning Jensen (1984) argues that while both\nare equally culpable, there are consequentialist reasons for not\nsubjecting the first negligent driver to the same degree of blame\nbehavior. Since we all take some risks, and some are less\nlikely to lead to harm than others, to blame everyone for simply\ntaking such risks would require such a high standard of care as to\nrisk destroying our ability to function as moral agents. On the other\nhand, requiring punishment for or compensation from those who do cause\nharm is required to provide a \u201crestorative value\u201d for\nthose agents and preserve their integrity.\n\nA third strategy is to point out that we mistakenly infer moral luck\nfrom legal luck. While there might be good reasons for the law to\ntreat people differently even if what they do depends on factors\nbeyond their control, we (understandably) make the mistaken inference\nthat the law directly reflects correct moral assessment in such cases.\nFor example, there are a number of reasons why the law might\njustifiably punish successful crimes more severely than merely\nattempted ones, including the balancing of deterrence and privacy\n(Rosebury 521\u201324). If reasons like this provide the\njustification for the differential treatment of such cases in the law,\nthen it would indeed be wrong to infer that the successful and\nunsuccessful murderers are deserving of different moral assessments.\nHowever, the fact that we do make such a mistaken inference\nexplains why we often commit ourselves to the existence of moral luck,\nwhen reflection can show that doing so is a mistake.\n\nIn addition to explaining how there can be an appearance of\nmoral luck, despite the fact that there is not any, some of those who\nwish to deny the existence of moral luck take on the task of offering\na coherent and plausible picture of morality that avoids luck.\n\nSome of those engaged in the free will debate have denied the\nexistence of causal, and perhaps also of constitutive, moral luck by\noffering a distinctive metaphysical account of human agency. (See, for\nexample, Chisholm, Taylor, Clarke, and O\u2019Connor. See also\nPereboom who argues that such an account is coherent, but not true.)\nThe view is known as \u201cAgent-Causal Libertarianism,\u201d and\nthe basic idea is that agents themselves cause actions or at least the\nformation of intentions, without their being caused to do so. Thus,\nthe agent herself, exercising her causal powers, is an undetermined\ncause of her intentions. On some agent causal views, only the agent,\nas opposed to events caused by other events is the cause of the\nintention (e.g., O\u2019Connor), while on another view, the agent\nacts in tandem with events that probabilistically cause the action\n(Clarke 1993). Particularly on the first sort of view, we seem to\navoid the conclusion that our actions must depend on causal factors\nthat are beyond our control. At the same time, it is not clear exactly\nhow the move to agent causation is supposed to restore the kind of\ncontrol we seek. For we might ask why we should consider the agent\ncause in control of her actions, while we can imagine that other\nsubstance causes (e.g., tables or billiard balls) would not be in\ncontrol of what they cause. It might be stipulated that the exercise\nof the particular causal power to cause intentions simply is an\nexercise of control, but we need further details to see that the\nchallenge has not been stipulated away. (See Clarke 2005 and Mele 2006\nfor recent discussions of agent causation and luck.) It is also\nimportant to note that Agent-Causal views are consistent with actions\nand even intentions depending in part on factors beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol, such as the reasons people have available at the time of\ndecision or action.\n\nIn a very different way, as we have seen, it is possible to take on a\npart of the task of describing a coherent picture of luck-free\nmorality by identifying an object of moral assessment in the case of\ncircumstantial luck. For example, Richards suggests that people should\nbe assessed for what they would have done in different circumstances.\nMore fundamentally, people should be assessed for their characters, of\nwhich their actions in different circumstances are manifestations.\n\nZimmerman begins where Richards leaves off, proposing to pursue\n\u201cthe implications of the denial of the relevance of luck to\nmoral responsibility\u201d to their \u201clogical conclusion\u201d\n(2002, 559). With the possible exception of some kinds of constitutive\nluck, Zimmerman rejects the possibility of moral luck of all four\nkinds while proposing a coherent picture of moral assessment. He\nrejects the possibility of resultant luck by first acknowledging that\na man who (by luck) succeeds in his plan to cause harm is responsible\nfor more things than one who (by luck) fails to carry out an identical\nplan. But, according to Zimmerman, we must distinguish between\nscope and degree of responsibility. Both men are\nresponsible to the same degree, and it is this kind of moral\nassessment to which the Control Principle ought to apply. When it\ncomes to circumstantial luck, things are more difficult. For when it\ncomes to cases like those of resultant luck in which we want to hold\npeople responsible, we can find something to hold them\nresponsible for, namely, their plans or intentions or attempts.\nHowever, when it comes to cases of circumstantial luck, such as the\nNazi collaborator and his counterpart, there are no counterpart plans\nor intentions or attempts that have simply failed to come to fruition.\nZimmerman suggests that there is nothing that we hold the counterpart\nresponsible for; in this case, the scope of the agent\u2019s\nresponsibility is 0. But we can and should still hold him responsible\nto the same degree as the Nazi sympathizer. He is responsible\ntout court even if he is not responsible for\nanything (2002, 565). He is responsible in the sense that his moral\nrecord is affected for better or worse in virtue of something about\nhim. For there is something in virtue of which he is responsible,\nnamely, his being such that he would have freely performed the very\nsame wrong actions had he been in the same circumstances as the Nazi\nsympathizer.\n\nThis reasoning can be extended still further to cover the case of\nconstitutive and even one kind of causal luck. Suppose that Georg does\nnot kill Henrik, and George does kill Henry. Further suppose that\n\u201cthe reason for Georg\u2019s not killing Henrik was that he was\ntoo timid, or that he had a thick skin and Henrik\u2019s insults did\nnot upset him in the way that Henry\u2019s insults upset George, or\nthat he was deaf and simply did not hear the insults that Henrik\nhurled his way. If it is nonetheless true that Georg would have freely\nshot and killed Henrik but for some such feature of the case over\nwhich he had no control, then, I contend, he is just as responsible,\nin virtue of this fact, as George is\u201d (2002, 565). Zimmerman\nacknowledges that there are features of one\u2019s constitution that\nare essential to who one is, although he denies that timidity,\nthick-skinnedness, and so on count among them. However, if such\nfeatures are essential, then it will not be true to say that had Georg\nlacked them, he would have freely killed Henrik. Since Georg is\nresponsible, on Zimmerman\u2019s view, precisely in virtue of such\ncounterfactuals being true, he would be absolved of responsibility if\nsuch features were essential to him. For this reason, Zimmerman\nconcedes that \u201cthe role that luck plays in the determination of\nmoral responsibility may not be entirely eliminable\u2026\u201d\n(2002, 575).\n\nFinally, Zimmerman goes on to claim that his reasoning applies even to\ncases in which a person\u2019s actions are causally determined. If it\nis true that, say, Georg would have killed Henrik if his deterministic\ncausal history, over which he has no control, had been different, then\nGeorg is as responsible as he would have been had he killed Henrik in\na world that was not determined. The upshot of the application of\nZimmerman\u2019s reasoning is that we are all responsible,\nblameworthy, and even praiseworthy in ways we have never imagined. If\nZimmerman is right, there are countless counterfactuals that apply to\neach and every one of us, in virtue of which we are responsible to one\ndegree or another. The view thus takes the Control Principle extremely\nseriously, and applies it in the broadest possible way. The price we\npay for \u201ctaking luck seriously\u201d is that our everyday moral\njudgments are, if not always mistaken, at the very least radically\nincomplete.\n\nA number of objections can be raised to Zimmerman\u2019s view,\nincluding (i) that at least large classes of the counterfactuals in\nvirtue of which he thinks people are responsible lack truth value\n(e.g., Adams 1977, Nelkin 2004, Zimmerman 2002, 572, and Zimmerman\n2015), and (ii) that he is simply mistaken that one can be responsible\nwithout being responsible for anything. A third sort of objection\ntakes the form of a challenge to offer a precise schema of the\nrelevant counterfactuals that can plausibly account for the feature of\nagents in virtue of which they are responsible to the same degree as\nothers who are blameworthy for wrongful acts..\n\nHanna (2014) poses this third sort of objection by first trying to\nidentify a general form of such a counterfactual. For example, he\nproposes as a first pass: \n\n(G) If an agent would freely perform some action \u00d8 if she were\nin circumstances C, then her degree of responsibility is the same as\nit would have been if she had freely \u00d8-ed in C.\n\n\nBut such a counterfactual schema cannot be correct. For consider the\nfollowing case: Jimmy promised his spouse to stop eating at the local\nMcDonald\u2019s. But were he to drive by it while it is open, he\nwould [freely] succumb to temptation and break his promise. He avoids\ndriving by the McDonald\u2019s so as not to break his promise. Surely\nJimmy is not as blameworthy as he would have been if he had driven by\nthe McDonald\u2019s and broken his promise. Thus, this counterfactual\nschema fails to ground the anti-luck verdict that one is equally\nblameworthy as someone who performed a bad act in virtue of the fact\nthat one would have done so in the circumstances. \n\nAs Hanna recognizes, the defender of circumstantial luck can improve\nthe counterfactual schema in various ways so as to try to avoid such\ncounterexamples. But each improvement seems to simply bring a clever\nnew apparent counterexample. Perhaps counterfactuals simply cannot do\nthe job being asked of them.\n\nDeniers of circumstantial and constitutive luck have various options\nin reply, however. They can continue to seek another schema for the\nrelevant counterfactuals, or identify a more fundamental feature of\nagents which give rise to counterfactuals that merely serve as\nevidence of such a feature without carrying all of the explanatory\nweight themselves. Or they can point out that a person\u2019s overall\ndegree of blameworthiness depends not only on a single counterfactual,\nand point out that there might be other relevant counterfactuals that\nare also true of the agent, some of which might mitigate or even make\nthe agent laudable. When one keeps all of these counterfactuals in\nview at the same time, it becomes much more intuitive that agents for\nwhom an identical set of counterfactuals is true are indeed equally\nblameworthy (or praiseworthy). (See Zimmerman 2015.) At this point, we\nagain seem to reach a potential clash over intuitions. For example,\nHanna offers the case of Jenny who \u201clives in a stable, idyllic,\nisolated utopian society. Consequently, she hasn\u2019t developed to\na sufficient degree all the traits that would dispose her to resist\ntyranny. Unfortunately, for these reasons\u2026Jenny would\ncollaborate if she were in Nazi-Germany-like conditions.\u201d\nHanna\u2019s intuition is that Jenny is not as culpable as an actual\nNazi collaborator, whereas it seems that Zimmerman, having all the\ncounterfactuals in view for each of the two agents, has the opposite\nreaction. It seems that a full adjudication of the debate will require\na comparison of entire frameworks, including appeal to an even larger\nrange of intuitions about cases, general moral principles, and\nexplanatory power, among other things. \n\nEven if one or more of the objections to Zimmerman\u2019s argument\nare ultimately on target, his approach is very helpful in showing what\nan attempt to follow out the denial of moral luck to its logical\nconclusion looks like. \n\nUnlike Zimmerman, most of those who adopt the denial strategy do so\nonly for certain sorts of moral luck. By treating all sorts of luck in\nthe same way (with the exception of constitutive luck with respect to\none\u2019s essential properties), Zimmerman challenges those who\nadopt this strategy to defend the drawing of the line between\nresultant and other sorts of luck. As we will see, this very same\nchallenge is also issued by those who take a diametrically opposed\nposition and accept all forms of moral luck.\n4.1.2 Denying Moral Luck and Setting Aside Morality in Favor of Ethics\n\nBefore turning to the approach of accepting the existence of moral\nluck, it remains to consider the view ascribed earlier to\nWilliams\u2019 \u201cPostscript\u201d (1993). Extracting\nWilliams\u2019 position on \u201cMoral Luck\u201d is a notoriously\ndifficult task, made easier only by Williams\u2019 own acknowledgment\nin the \u201cPostscript\u201d that his original article \u201cmay\nhave encouraged\u201d some misunderstandings (251). Many commentators\nhave read Williams as advocating the position that moral luck exists\nand is deeply threatening to morality. There is certainly a line of\nreasoning in Williams\u2019 original article that suggests this (see\n37\u201342, 51\u201353). But in the Postscript, Williams makes a\ndistinction between morality and ethics that allows him to deny the\nexistence of moral luck, thus preserving a certain integrity for\nmorality.\n\nWilliams understands morality to embody the Kantian conception of it\ndescribed above, accepting that the essence of the Control Principle\nis \u201cbuilt into\u201d morality so understood (1993, 252). At the\nsame time, examples like the Gauguin case described earlier show that\none can be rationally justified in one\u2019s decision in\nvirtue of its outcome. Further, such a case shows that our overall\nvalue judgment of someone\u2019s decision can depend on factors\nbeyond the control of the agent. We must conclude, then, that there is\na kind of value that competes with, if not trumps, moral value. And if\nthat is right, then we must give up \u201cthe point of\nmorality\u201d so understood, namely, to \u201cprovide a shelter\nagainst luck, one realm of value (indeed, of supreme value)\nthat is defended against contingency\u201d (1993, 251, emphasis\nmine). It seems that morality can only insulate itself from luck at\nthe expense of foregoing supreme value. Once we acknowledge this cost,\nwe can keep morality intact (although skeptical doubts about its\nability to resist luck can still be raised), but we have lost our\nreason to care about it. Instead, Williams suggests, we should care\nabout ethics, where ethics is understood to address the most\ngeneral question of how we ought to live.\n\nQuestions can be raised about this line of reasoning. For example, we\ncan ask whether there is any sense in which Williams\u2019 Gauguin\nought to have left his family, despite the fact that the result was so\nwelcome. If there is not, then Williams has not shown that morality\ncompetes with, or is trumped by, some other value. From the other\ndirection, we can ask whether Williams is right that morality loses\nits point if it is not the supreme source of value. Of course, even if\nWilliams\u2019 reasoning is unsound, the conclusion could still be\ncorrect, and others have offered different routes to it.\n\nThe idea that we ought to care about ethics, understood as Williams\ndoes, finds inspiration in the work of Aristotle. Aristotle is\nconcerned with the nature of the good life in the broadest\nsense\u2014in what he calls \u201ceudaimonia,\u201d often\ntranslated as \u201chappiness\u201d. Aristotle defends the idea that\nhappiness consists in being a virtuous person over a complete life,\nand, in turn, the idea that being a virtuous person requires not only\nthat one have virtuous qualities and dispositions, but also that one\nact on them. Luck enters into the account in at least two ways. First,\non Aristotle\u2019s account, one becomes a virtuous person by\nundergoing the right kind of upbringing and training. Since whether\none receives this training is at least to some extent beyond\none\u2019s control, one\u2019s ability to live a virtuous life is\ndeeply dependent on luck. Second, the fact that being a virtuous\nperson requires the performance of certain kinds of activities means\nthat the world must cooperate in various ways in order for one to be\ntruly virtuous, and so be truly happy. Aristotle writes that happiness\n\u201cneeds the external goods as well; for it is impossible, or not\neasy, to do noble acts without proper equipment\u201d (1984 NE 1099a\n31\u201333). For example, in order to engage in acts of generosity,\none must have resources at one\u2019s disposal to share. And since\nhaving the right equipment is at least to some extent a matter of\ncircumstantial luck, the value of one\u2019s life itself will depend\nin part on what is not in one\u2019s control. On one interpretation\nof Aristotle, luck enters into the account in yet a third way. Acting\nin accordance with virtue does not suffice for happiness, on this\ninterpretation, although it is the \u201cdominant component\u201d of\nAristotle\u2019s account of happiness (Irwin 1988, 445). According to\nthis view, one must also have a minimum provision of external goods\n(e.g., health, security, access to resources) whose contribution to\nhappiness is independent of their making virtuous activity possible.\nIf this is right, then the value of one\u2019s life will depend at\nleast in part on factors beyond one\u2019s control. In sum, while\nthere is some dispute about whether Aristotle thought more\nthan a life of virtuous activity is required for happiness, it is\nclear that luck plays a significant role in determining both whether\npeople are truly virtuous and whether people\u2019s lives are good in\nthe broadest sense. Hence, \u201cthe fragility of goodness\u201d\n(Nussbaum).\n4.2 Acceptance\n\nAll of those who accept the existence of some type of moral luck\nreject the Control Principle and the Kantian conception of morality\nthat embraces it. As a result, they must either explain how we can\nrevise our moral judgments and practices in a coherent way or show\nthat we are not committed to the Control Principle in the first\nplace.\n4.2.1 Accepting Moral Luck and Revising our Practices\n\nSome who accept luck argue that doing so requires a significant change\nin our moral practices. Browne (1992), for example, suggests that if\nthe Control Principle is false, we ought not to respond to an\nagent\u2019s wrongdoing with anger and blame that is\n\u201cagainst\u201d him, but rather with anger that does not include\nhostility or the desire to punish. Nevertheless, we can still respond\nto the successful murderer with more of the \u201cright\u201d kind\nof anger than we feel toward the unsuccessful one. One question that\nmight be raised here is whether we are left with enough of our\nordinary conception of morality to include genuine notions of blame\nand responsibility.\n4.2.2 Accepting Moral Luck Without (As Much) Revision\n\nOthers suggest that the Control Principle does not have nearly the\nhold on us that Nagel and Williams assume, and that rejecting it would\nnot change our practices in a significant way. Among these are some\nwho focus on the free will debate and others who take on the broader\nproblem of moral luck directly.\n4.2.2.1 Accepting Moral Luck and the Free Will Debate\n\nA large group who accept moral luck do not explicitly address the\nproblem of moral luck as so formulated because they focus on what\nNagel identifies as a narrower issue, namely, that of free will. One\ntraditional problem of free will is posed by the following line of\nreasoning: if determinism is true, then no one can act freely, and,\nassuming that freedom is necessary for responsibility, no one can be\nresponsible for their actions. Compatibilists have argued that we can\nact freely and responsibly even if determinism is true. Since most do\nnot adopt Zimmerman\u2019s radical account of moral assessment in\nwhich one can be responsible despite not being responsible\nfor anything, they admit the existence of causal moral luck.\nIf, as some have argued, causal luck is exhausted by constitutive and\ncircumstantial luck, then they also accept that there can be these\nsorts of moral luck, as well.\n\nA basic compatibilist strategy is to argue that agents can have\ncontrol over their actions in the sense required for freedom and/or\nresponsibility even if they do not control the causal determinants of\nthose actions. For example, if one acts with the ability to act in\naccordance with good reasons (Wolf 1990) or if one acts with\n\u201cguidance control\u201d which consists in part of acting on a\nreasons-responsive mechanism for which one has taken responsibility,\n(Fischer and Ravizza 1998), one can be responsible for one\u2019s\nactions. The key move here is to distinguish between different kinds\nof factors over which one has no control. If one\u2019s actions are\ncaused by factors that one does not control and that prevent one from\nhaving or exercising certain capacities, then one is not responsible.\nHowever, if one\u2019s actions are caused by factors that one does\nnot control, but that do allow one to have and exercise the relevant\ncapacities, then one can be \u201cin control\u201d of one\u2019s\nactions in the relevant sense, and so responsible for one\u2019s\nactions.\n\nInterestingly, compatibilists are often silent on the question of\nresultant and circumstantial moral luck, although these forms of luck\nmight represent an underutilized resource for them. For if it turns\nout that the luck\u2014or lack of control\u2014delivered by\ndeterminism is but one source of luck among others, then determinism\ndoes not embody a unique obstacle to free will and responsibility, at\nleast when it comes to control. This is to expand the application of a\nwidely used compatibilist strategy to show that when it comes to\ncausal luck, compatibilists are not alone.\n\nFor within the free will debate, compatibilists are not alone in\naccepting the existence of certain types of luck. Many libertarians\nassume that our actions are caused by prior events (not themselves in\nour control) in accordance with probabilistic laws of nature (see, for\nexample, Kane 1996, 1999, Nozick 1981). Given this view, it is natural\nto conclude that if determinism is false, there is at least one kind\nof luck in what sort of person one decides to be and so in what\nactions one performs. That is, there is luck in the sense that there\nis no explanation as to why a person chose to be one way rather than\nanother. At the same time, Kane, for example, denies that there must\nbe luck in the sense that one\u2019s choices are flukes or accidents\nif determinism is false. In Kane\u2019s view, what is important is to\nbe free from luck of the second kind. For even if one\u2019s action\nis not determined, it can still be the case that the causes of\none\u2019s action are one\u2019s own efforts and intention. And if\none\u2019s action is caused by one\u2019s own efforts and\nintentions, then one\u2019s action is not lucky in the sense of being\na fluke or accident. But while this shows that one\u2019s actions can\nbe free of luck of an important kind, it still leaves unaddressed luck\nof a third kind, namely the kind at issue in the moral luck debate:\nthe dependence of agents\u2019 choices on factors beyond their\ncontrol. And it appears that on the libertarian view in question, our\nchoices are indeed subject to luck of this sort. (See Pereboom 2002\nand 2014 for a discussion of the similar burdens shared by\ncompatibilists and this sort of libertarian.) Only the agent-causal\nlibertarians discussed above offer an account that aims specifically\nat eliminating a type of moral luck. (See Levy 2011 for an argument\nthat no account of free will can avoid challenges concerning\nluck.)\n4.2.2.2 Accepting Moral Luck and Distinctive Conceptions of Morality\n\nIt is also possible to argue that we are not committed to the Control\nPrinciple by taking on the problem of moral luck directly.\n\nOne strategy is to argue that moral luck is only a problem for an\noverly idealized conception of human agency. But once we adopt a\nrealistic conception of human agency, the problem evaporates. Margaret\nUrban Walker (1991) argues in this vein that moral luck is only\nproblematic for a conception of moral agents as \u201cnoumenal\u201d\nor pure (238). In contrast, adopting a conception of morality that\napplies to human beings in all of their impurity will not be\nthreatened by moral luck. According to Walker, the Control Principle\nis far from obvious, and we would not want to live in a world in which\nit held sway. The argument appears to rest on the idea that without\nmoral luck, we would lack several virtues that allow us to help each\nother in most essential ways. Our very reactions to moral luck can be\nvirtuous. For example, by accepting that our \u201cresponsibilities\noutrun control,\u201d we are able to display the virtue of\ndependability by accepting that we will be there for our friends, even\nif their needs are not in our control. In contrast, pure agents who\nare only responsible for what they control \u201cmay not be depended\non, much less morally required, to assume a share of the ongoing and\nmassive human work of caring, healing, restoring, and cleaning-up on\nwhich each separate life and the collective one depend.\u201d (247).\nThus, if we focus on our actual moral commitments, we will see that\nthe Control Principle is neither attractive nor necessary for\nmorality.\n\nIt is not obvious that a world in which people denied the existence of\nmoral luck would be as bleak as the one Walker envisions. Moral luck\nskeptics have material with which to question Walker\u2019s claim.\nFor example, those who deny resultant moral luck can still agree that\nagents have an obligation to minimize their risks of doing harm, and\nthose who deny circumstantial moral luck can still agree that agents\nhave an obligation to cultivate qualities that prepare them to act\nwell in whatever circumstances arise.\n\nA second strategy for rejecting the Control Principle turns\nNagel\u2019s argument on its head by taking as a starting point\nordinary judgments and reactions that reveal our implicit rejection of\nthe Control Principle. Adams (1985) adopts this strategy, drawing our\nattention to common practices, such as blaming people for their racist\nattitudes even if we do not think that such people are in control of\ntheir attitudes. Since Adams focuses primarily on agents\u2019 states\nof mind that have intentional objects such as anger and\nself-righteousness, it is possible to see him as accepting the\nexistence of constitutive moral luck in particular. But it is also\npossible to adopt the same sort of strategy for other sorts of luck,\nincluding resultant luck. Moore (1997 and 2009), for example, points\nto the fact that we resent those who succeed in causing harm more than\nthose who do not, we feel greater guilt when we ourselves cause harm,\nand when we face decisions, we feel that the consequences of matter to\nthe moral quality of our choices. According to Moore, the best\nexplanation of these reactive attitudes, such as guilt and resentment,\nis that their objects are genuinely more blameworthy.\n\nNow opponents who deny the existence of moral luck have ways of\nexplaining away these phenomena. When it comes to cases of\nconstitutive luck, like the case of the racist, they can say that we\nconfuse agents\u2019 blameworthiness for their character and\nattitudes with blameworthiness for their actions that manifest these\noffending attitudes and for their failure to take steps to eliminate\nthem. On reflection, we can see that we ought to blame the racists\nonly for their actions or omissions, not for the attitudes themselves\nover which they have no control. Similarly, as we saw earlier, when it\ncomes to resultant luck, moral luck skeptics have a variety of strong\nalternative explanations of our judgments and emotional responses. It\nis possible that there is a disagreement here at the level of\nintuitions: some find it easier on reflection to reject moral\njudgments that depend on results than others. Further, those accepting\nresultant moral luck face a challenge of articulating a positive\ntheory of how exactly results affect one\u2019s moral status while at\nthe same time accounting for our intuitions. Sverdlik (1988) argues\nthat it is not obvious how such a challenge can be met.\n\nAt this point in the debate, those who accept moral luck offer\nordinary judgments and responses in their defense, while moral luck\nskeptics offer alternative explanations of those practices and hold up\nthe Control Principle itself, together with other reflective intuitive\njudgments, as reason to reject moral luck. We seem to have something\nof a stalemate. So it is no surprise that those who accept moral luck\ntend not to rely exclusively on ordinary judgments to make their case,\nbut rather go on to try to undermine the Control Principle in other\nways.\n\nAnother way of trying to undermine the appeal of the Control Principle\nitself is to show how it might be mistaken for something else that is\nmore plausible. For example, Adams (1985) recognizes that there are\nlimits to what we can be responsible for, and writes that the states\nof mind \u201cfor which we are directly responsible are those in\nwhich we are responding, consciously or unconsciously, to data that\nare rich enough to permit a fairly adequate ethical appreciation of\nthe state\u2019s intentional object and of the object\u2019s place\nin the fabric of personal relationships\u201d (26). Thus, according\nto Adams\u2019 conception of morality, adherents of the Control\nPrinciple are correct in an important respect, namely, in their\nunderstanding that what one is responsible for springs in the right\nway from oneself. But this requirement is more general than a\nstrict requirement of control, and although easily confused with the\nControl Principle, is superior to it, on this view.\n\nAdopting the same general strategy, Moore (1997) identifies still\nother principles with which the Control Principle might be confused.\nHe points out that when we use the word \u201cluck\u201d in the\ncontext of moral assessment, we tend not to mean that the\nperson lacked control over what he did, but rather that what happened\nwas far off of \u201csome moral baseline of the normal\u201d (213).\nFor example, consider two would-be murderers, one of whom fires his\ngun and hits his target, and the other of whom fires in the same way,\nfrom the same distance, and so on, but whose bullet is deflected by an\nunexpected and unusually strong wind. Moore suggests that the first\ngunman is not \u201clucky\u201d in the ordinary sense, even though\nit is true that whether a hurricane-force wind arose or not was not in\nhis control. According to Moore, there is something intuitively right\nabout morality being immune to luck, but only if we understand\n\u201cluck\u201d in the sense of \u201cfreakishness.\u201d\nFurther, the successful murderer is \u201cin control\u201d\nof his action in the normal sense of the word \u201ccontrol,\u201d\neven though he doesn\u2019t control the wind. Thus, while we do care\nabout luck and control in making both moral and legal assessments,\nthey aren\u2019t Nagel\u2019s concepts, on this view. Thus,\naccording to Moore, there is no contradiction in our everyday\ncommitments.\n\nNow those who think we are naturally drawn to the Control Principle\ncan respond by pointing out both the intuitive plausibility of the\nprinciple in the abstract and the cases described earlier that seem to\nsupport it. They might also accept that Adams and Moore have pointed\nout further necessary conditions for responsibility, while still\nmaintaining that the Control Principle is true. Again, differing\nintuitions about cases and about the Control Principle have the\npotential to make a big difference to one\u2019s view at this\npoint.\n\nMichael Otsuka offers yet another principle in place of the Control\nPrinciple: One is only blameworthy in cases in which one had the kind\nof control that would have allowed one to be entirely blameless.\nConsistent with this is a kind of moral luck, however:\none\u2019s blameworthiness can vary in degree as a function of\nharm done, where harm done may be affected by what is not in\none\u2019s control. Although one cannot be blameworthy if one lacked\nthe control necessary to avoid blameworthiness, one\u2019s\ndegree of blameworthiness can increase if the risk one takes\ncomes out badly due to circumstances one could do nothing to avoid.\nFor example, in the case of the two assassins, both are blameworthy,\nbut, Otsuka argues, the one who hits and kills his target is more\nblameworthy. In sketching the view, Otsuka draws a parallel with\nDworkin\u2019s (1981) treatment of option luck in the debate over\negalitarianism. In that debate, a distinction is drawn between option\nluck (\u201ca matter of ...whether someone gains or loses through\naccepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might\nhave declined\u201d) and brute luck (\u201ca matter of how risks\nfall out that are not that sense...gambles).\u201d If one\u2019s\nluck is just brute-one did not assume a risk, as when one has done\neverything a careful driver would do, and due to sheer luck, a dog\nruns into the street and one drives over it-one is not blameworthy.\nBut if one assumes a risk by knowingly and freely driving recklessly,\nand, as a result, one kills a dog, then one is blameworthy. And,\nfurther, one might be more blameworthy in the case in which one kills\nthe dog than in the case in which one takes the same risk but luckily\nreaches home without hitting anything. It would be reasonable, on\nOtsuka\u2019s view, for the dog owner whose dog is killed to be more\nresentful than the one whose dog escapes, and this supports the\nconclusion that the driver who kills the dog is more blameworthy than\nthe one who does not. \n\nThe parallel to option and brute luck is suggestive, but a defender of\nthe unqualified Control principle has resources here. Appealing to the\ndistinction between scope and degree, one might grant that the\nreckless driver is, importantly, responsible for more things\n(including a death), but not more blameworthy. In fact, the parallel\nto the treatment of option luck in the debate about distributive\njustice may fit best if we are interested in what we are responsible\nfor, rather than how responsible we are. Further, we have seen\nreason to think that on reflection we should not blame one reckless\ndriver more than another. One might question Otsuka\u2019s premise\nthat degree of blameworthiness is to be understood in terms of\nappropriate degree of attitudes such as resentment (or even the weaker\npremise that the degree of blameworthiness tracks the appropriate\ndegree of such attitudes). But even if we accept this premise, we\nmight conclude that while it is understandable that one dog owner\nwould be more resentful than the first, more resentment is not\nactually justified. This observation takes us back to the subtle\nnature of the dialectic. \n\nIn adjudicating this debate between those defending the Control\nPrinciple and those defending alternative principles, we can ask just\nhow much weight should be given to our natural reactions to cases,\nand, in particular, to our reactive attitudes, such as resentment and\nguilt. At least in some cases, these can be tempered when we reflect\nexplicitly on key features of cases, and our initial responses can be\nrevised in light of these reflections, together with reflection on\ngeneral principles.\n\nNotably, there has recently been an attempt by philosophers to appeal\nto results from empirical psychology to explain away some set of\nintuitions or other, and this strategy has been applied in the area of\nmoral luck in particular. For some examples, see Domsky (2004) and\nRoyzman and Kumar (2004) whose explanations in different ways support\nthe preservation of our adherence to the Control Principle, and see\nEnoch and Guttel (2010) for a reply to both. Psychologists and\nexperimental philosophers have also simply tried to offer explanations\nof our intuitions, particularly of ones that appear to conflict as we\nfind in the debate about moral luck. For example, see Cushman and\nGreen (2012), who offer an explanation of apparently conflicting\nintuitions about moral results luck in terms of two dissociable\nprocesses, and Bj\u00f6rnsson and Persson (2012), who offer an\nexplanation in terms of shifting explanatory perspectives. In an\ninteresting set of studies, Kneer and Machery (2019) found that when\nparticipants were asked for comparative judgments about pairs of\nscenarios, varying only in outcome, they tended to offer anti-moral\nluck responses, judging agents in both scenarios equally blameworthy.\nIn contrast, in related studies in which each participant only saw one\nscenario without a comparison, participants\u2019 judgments of\ndegrees of blameworthiness varied by scenario, with the more harmful\noutcome scenarios receiving judgments of higher degrees of blame.\nHowever, Kneer and Machinery found that the differences in judgments\nin these cases was nearly entirely mediated by a disproportionate\nattribution of negligence to the agents in the harmful scenarios,\nsuggesting the possibility that, when presented only with one\nscenario, participants read backwards from harm to a morally\nsignificant attribution of features in the agents. If this is correct,\nthen it may not be outcome per se that provides the grounds of\ndifferential judgments, but, rather, a distinct morally salient\nfeature of agents that is often associated with outcome. Taken\ntogether, Kneer and Machery\u2019s studies support the idea that\npeople have anti-results-luck intuitions and lay theories, and that\nwhere they appear to have pro-results-luck intuitions, these can be\nexplained as people tracking something only contingently associated\nwith outcome rather than outcome itself. It is worth noting, however,\nas several of these authors do themselves, that even if we were\nconfident in our possession of psychological explanations of our\nintuitions, there would still be philosophical work to do to sort out\nwhat the normative facts are. But it is helpful to have a growing body\nof systematic studies of intuitive reactions to scenarios involving\nmoral luck, as well as investigation into the features of cases people\nfind salient.\n\nThere is a final argument in favor of the acceptance of moral luck of\na very different kind that might ultimately help decide the issue in\none direction or the other. It explicitly encompasses every kind of\nluck and thus poses a deep and difficult challenge to moral luck\nskeptics, particularly the large group who focus exclusively on\nresultant luck. The main idea is that rejecting resultant luck, but\nnot other sorts of luck, is an unstable position (e.g., Moore 1997 and\nHartman 2017). In a nutshell, one cannot find a principled place to\ndraw the line at refusing to accept moral luck. In effect, this\nargument is Nagel\u2019s argument in reverse. Begin by observing that\nwe lack control over everything: the results of our actions, our\ncircumstances, our constitution, and our causal history. If we are to\navoid moral skepticism, then we must accept moral luck in some areas,\nand if we do that, then we ought to accept it in the area of results.\nParticularly if we accept that we are not predisposed to accept the\nControl Principle in the first place, then we ought to accept luck in\nall areas, thereby avoiding moral skepticism.\n\nHartman (2017) offers a version of this strategy that is explicitly\nanalogical (pp. 105\u201307). Consider three agents who all form the\nintention and plan to carry out a murder. Each has a single\nopportunity to pull the trigger of a gun. Sneezy sneezes and so is\nunable to pull the trigger; Off-Target pulls the trigger, but the\nbullet is intercepted by a bird, and Bulls-Eye pulls the trigger and\nhits her target. By hypothesis, there is circumstantial luck, so,\nclaims Hartman, Sneezy is less blameworthy than Off-Target, even\nthough she would have pulled the trigger had her allergies not acted\nup. But given the parallels between Sneezy and Off-Target (same\nintentions, plans, and so on) are similar to the parallels between\nOff-Target and Bulls-Eye, we have analogical evidence that Off-Target\nis less blameworthy than Bulls-Eye. \n\nThere are a variety of possible replies, such as that offered by\nRivera-L\u00f3pez (2016), which claims that there is a principled\ndifference resting on the need to make moral attributions at all. We\nshould accept moral luck where it is necessary for making the practice\nof attributing responsibility possible, but given that it is necessary\nin the case of circumstantial luck and not in the case of results\nluck, we can draw a principled line between the two pairs of cases.\nHartman takes it that what is really needed here is that we ought to\naccept moral luck only if it is needed for our practices of\nattribution, but also suggest that it that this begs the question in\nthe context at least without further defense. Another reply is that\naccepting circumstantial luck does not require accepting that it makes\na difference everywhere, and that indeed Sneezy and Off-Target are\nthemselves equally blameworthy. Thus, the analogical argument does not\nget off the ground with this set of cases. And yet if we turn to a\ndifferent set of cases, such as the case of Jenny described earlier,\nwho lives in a utopian world but would have collaborated with the\nNazis, where the intuition of differential degrees of blameworthiness\nis stronger, the analogy becomes much weaker. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral line of argument poses a challenge for anyone who wishes to\ndraw a line, accepting some kinds of moral luck and not others. \n\nNow even if no one has adequately defended a way of drawing a line\nbetween different sorts of luck, it is not obvious that the door has\nbeen closed on all future attempts. Thus, one way of seeing this\nargument is as a shift-the-burden one. Those who wish to draw a line\nbetween different sorts of moral luck must offer a deeper rationale\nfor doing so than has yet been offered. \n4.3 Incoherence\n\nAccording to this approach, it is simply incoherent to accept\nor deny the existence of some type(s) of moral luck. This\napproach has been used for constitutive luck in particular.\n\nAmong those who wish to preserve the centrality of morality in our\nlives, many have appealed to an idea formulated by Nicholas Rescher\n(1993), according to which \u201c[o]ne cannot meaningfully said to be\nlucky in regard to who one is, but only with respect to what happens\nto one. Identity must precede luck\u201d (155). It is easy to take\nRescher\u2019s point out of context without realizing that he is\nworking with a notion of luck that differs from the notion of\n\u201clack of control.\u201d According to Rescher, something is\nlucky if (i) it came about \u201cby accident\u201d where this seems\nto mean something like \u201cunplanned\u201d or\n\u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d and (ii)\nthe outcome \u201chas a significantly evaluative status in\nrepresenting a good or bad result, a benefit or loss\u201d(145).\nTaken this way, it does seem at least very odd to say that one\u2019s\nidentity is (or is not) a matter of luck. But it is less clear that\nthere is anything odd\u2014let alone incoherent\u2014about saying\nthat one\u2019s identity is not a matter within one\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nCould there nevertheless be some truth to Rescher\u2019s claim even\nif we understand \u201cluck\u201d as \u201cout of one\u2019s\ncontrol?\u201d Perhaps it does not make sense, for example, to say\nthat a person is in control of who she is. For one could argue that\nthis would amount to saying that a person is a self-creator. And in\nfact the Control Principle, taken to its logical extreme, seems to\nlead to just such a requirement (see, e.g., Browne 1992, Nagel 1986,\n118). If it turns out that self-creation is conceptually impossible as\nmany argue (e.g., Galen Strawson 1986), then perhaps there is a sense\nin which it is right to say that being in control of one\u2019s\nconstitution makes no sense. But it does not follow from this that it\nis meaningless to deny that one can control one\u2019s\nconstitution.\n\nPerhaps the best way of deploying the insight that there is something\nspecial about luck and constitution is not to say that it is\nmeaningless to discuss it, but to say that constitutive moral luck is\nsimply unproblematic for morality in the way that resultant moral luck\nis. This would be to take up the \u201cline-drawing\u201d challenge\nas described in the last section. On this line of reasoning, for\npurposes of moral assessment, it does not matter how you came to be;\nwhat matters is what you do with what you are. Of course, as we saw,\nthis requires defense and explanation, but it is a way of capturing\nthe insight that constitutive luck is relevantly different from the\nresultant luck that has captivated a number of commentators.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe problem of moral luck is deeply unsettling. Naturally, there is a\nwide variety of responses to it. On the one extreme are those who deny\nthat there is any sort of moral luck, and on the other are those who\naccept every sort of moral luck. Most writers who have responded to\nthe problem fall somewhere in between; either they explicitly take a\nmixed approach or they confine their arguments to a carefully\ndelineated subset of types of moral luck while remaining uncommitted\nwith respect to the others. The extreme positions are vulnerable to\nthe objection that they have left some consideration or other\ncompletely unaccounted for. But those who occupy the middle also face\na formidable challenge: where can one draw a principled line between\nacceptable and unacceptable forms of luck? As we have seen, one\napparently natural place to draw a line is between resultant luck and\nall of the other sorts. On this view, there is no resultant moral\nluck, despite initial appearances, although there is moral luck of all\nthe other kinds. Thus, occupiers of this position face the challenge\nof setting out a plausible rationale for drawing the line where they\ndo. But they also face the challenge of where precisely to draw\nanother line, namely, the line around what counts as\n\u201cresults.\u201d For we can ask on which side of this line do\nintentions, willings, bodily movements, and so on, fall. Do results\ninclude everything that happens after the formation of an intention or\nthe exertion of the will, for example? Or everything that follows the\nbeginning of the formation of an intention or the\nbeginning of the exertion of the will? Or everything that\nfollows the \u201caffection of the heart\u201d of which Adam Smith\nwrote so eloquently? These are difficult questions for those who would\ndraw a line at resultant luck. But difficult questions await every\nother proposal, too. Fortunately, there is a rich and growing\nliterature providing a full spectrum of responses to explore.",
