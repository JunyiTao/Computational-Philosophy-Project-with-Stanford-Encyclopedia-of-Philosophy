    "main_text": "Dao and Names: The Laozi or Daode Jing\n4. Dao and Names: The Laozi or Daode Jing\n\nWe will discuss, here, mainly the contributions the Laozi\nmakes to this Daoist dialectic. For a more complete and detailed\ntreatment of the philosophy of the text, see the entry under Laozi.\n\n\nThe Zhuangzi history lists Laozi (along with Guan Yin)\nbetween Shen Dao and Zhuangzi. Whatever its actual date and manner of\ncomposition, the Laozi is assigned a role in the development\nof Zhuangzi\u2019s thought that best fits in that slot. The most famous\nline of Daoist meta-theory of dao opens the Daode\nJing. \u201cDao that can be dao-ed is not\nconstant dao.\u201d Though the text betrays no hint of\nexposure to the\n School of Names,\n this famous slogan is duplicated with mingname\nreplacing dao. It thus shifts the\nfocus of meta-discourse about dao from grounding its\nauthority in nature to issues of language and the role of\nmingwords in\ndao-ing. Since words are not constant, no dao that\ncan be conveyed using words can be.\n\nWhat is being denied in saying such dao are not\n constant?\n The text does not elaborate on the concept, however the issue in\nancient Chinese thought emerges as the crux of the dispute between\nMohists and Confucians. Mohists attempted to regiment the debate by\ninsisting on fastandards\nfor interpreting guiding language. They argued tiannature:sky\u2019s\nstandard lies in the distinction\nbetween benefit and harm\u2014which was by association a\nconstant standard. The writers of the Confucian\nAnalects inclined toward a notion of an administrator\n\u201crectifying names.\u201d A name is rectified when an\ninstruction containing it (a ritual or a law) correctly\nguides peoples action. \u201cIf names are not rectified \u2026\npeople will not know how to move hand or foot\u201d\n(Analects 13:3). The typical Confucian way of\nrectifying a name is to set an example\u2014either of correct use of\nthe term or correct action in following a dao that contains\nthe term. \n\nSo what is Laozi denying when he is made to say \u201cnames that can\nbe named are not\n constant\nnames?\u201d The skepticism here can be read in two ways. One\nis there is no correct way to use a name so contrary to\nMohism, no standard is \u201cnature\u2019s\u201d constant standard of\nchoice of a dao. The other reading is interpretive\u2014no\npattern of correct past use (no social practice) uniquely determines\nwhat concrete behavior counts as correct here-now (or in\nthe future). So, as Mozi had argued, tradition cannot determine\nwhat is the correct dao, but, the Laozi seems to\nadd, that is so even presupposing a tradition. There is no\nconstant (correct) way to interpret that\npractice/dao into action.\n\nThe negative result may be read in several ways. \n\nIt may be pure nihilism\u2014there is no such thing as correct\ndao.\nIt may be skepticism\u2014correct dao can never be\nknown;\nOr as anti-language\u2014correct dao cannot be put in\nwords or conveyed as guidance to another. \n\n\nThe second and third are compatible with their being a correct or\nconstant dao and the third even with someone\u2019s\nknowing it. It simply cannot be conveyed. The rest of the\ntext\u2014the very fact that there is more to the text\u2014makes\nthese two readings, particularly the last, the most common ones.\nHowever the traditional story of Laozi undermines the argument for\nplacing too much emphasis on the fact that after this opening stanza,\nhe goes on to write a text. It suggests that he writes only\nbecause compelled to do so by the keeper of the pass. \n\nAdopting readings 2 or 3 doesn\u2019t remove all paradox from Laozi\u2019s\nposition. Laozi is still left with his variation on Shen Dao\u2019s\n\u201cabandon knowledge.\u201d The text, however, does develop a\ndifferent motivation for it. We find few traces of Shen Dao\u2019s\nfatalistic or stoic reasoning. Laozi\u2019s opposition to knowledge derives\nmore from Song Xing\u2019s insights about how social knowledge shapes our\nvalues and desires. We can attribute to the Laozi the next\ndevelopment in Chinese pragmatics of language, how language shapes\naction.\n\nLaozi draws illustrations using ming (word)\npairs\u2014opposites. He draws analogies between naming and cutting\nor \u201ccarving\u201d (hence the symbol of the nameless\n pusimplicity\u2014uncarved,\nraw wood). When we\nlearn a way of using a word (e.g. watching teachers\n\u201crectify\u201d names) we internalize a community practice of\n\u201ccutting\u201d stuff and assigning names to the portions. This\nis how we pick out how to act\u2014what to pick up, put down, go\ntoward and so on. We interpret a dao by dividing\nthings up into types. We learn this in concrete practice as we avoid\nor pursue the things named. Thus, with the names we acquire a\ndisposition to behavior toward that type\u2014we acquire a socialized\nvalue or desire for one of the two discriminants. These acquired\ndesires then shape our weideeming:action.\n\n\nMuch of the further reasoning found in the Laozi follows that\nof Song Xing. The artificially created desires lead to unnecessary\ncompetition and strife. When we see that they are not natural,\nacquiring socialized desires (e.g. for status, reputation, for rare\nobjects) starts to look ill advised. He hints at places that acquiring\nthe system of names dulls our capacity for appreciation or reaction to\nnature\u2014\u201cthe five colors blind the eye \u2026\u201d\n(Daode Jing Ch. 12). And most important, acquiring knowledge\nin this way is losing the natural spontaneity and becoming subject to\nsocial control. \n\nThe text, accordingly, entices us to free ourselves from this system\nsignified by the slogan wu-weilack-action.\nWe are to set about forgetting all\nour socialization and return to the state of a newborn babe. The\nslogan is famously paradoxical and is even formulated in the text in a\nparadoxical way\u2014\u201clack acting and yet lack\n\u2018don\u2019t-act\u2019.\u201d \n\nThe bulk of the Daode Jing is thus given over to motivating\nthis paradoxical attitude. Its familiar strategy centers on the notion\nof \u201creversal.\u201d In passage after passage, advice is given\nthat reverses conventional values (usu. in Confucian-Mohist\ndiscourse)\u2014either rejecting the usual positive value term\n(benevolence, sages, morality, social activism) or motivating valuing\nthe opposite (non-being, water, the female, the lower position etc.).\n\n\nThe result is a fascinating exercise in normative advocacy including\nLaozi\u2019s famous political theory\u2014which you can find elaborated\nmore fully in the Laozi entry. Clearly, such advocacy is inconsistent\nwith the meta-theory and its purpose must be indirect\u2014perhaps to\ninduce us to \u201csee\u201d one of the three negative positions\nconsidered above. Still it gives the text a tone that we referred to\nabove as primitivism\u2014nullifying socialization and cultivating\nonly the \u201cnatural\u201d attitudes and actions.\n",
