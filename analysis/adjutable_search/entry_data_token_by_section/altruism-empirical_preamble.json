    "main_text": "\n\nMany philosophers have maintained that altruism is a crucial component\nof morality, and that people often do behave altruistically. Other\nphilosophers, along with many biologists and social scientists, have\nclaimed that facts about human psychology, or about the evolutionary\nprocesses that have shaped human psychology, indicate that no human\nbehavior is genuinely altruistic. Part of this disagreement can be\ntraced to the fact that both philosophers and scientists use the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d with many quite different meanings. Sections 2,\n3 and 4, set out a number of widely used accounts of altruism.  One of\nthese, \u201cthe standard account\u201d, has been the focus of most\nof the debate in philosophy over the existence of altruism. Sections 5\nand 6, review some of the most important empirical work aimed at\ndetermining whether humans can indeed behave altruistically, on the\nstandard account.\n",
