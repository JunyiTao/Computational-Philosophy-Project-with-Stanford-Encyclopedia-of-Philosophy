The autonomy of nonconceptual content\n\nOne question that arises when thinking about nonconceptual content is\nwhether a thinker can be in states with nonconceptual content despite\nnot possessing any concepts at all. That is, can nonconceptual content\nbe completely autonomous of conceptual content? The possibility of an\naffirmative answer to this question is important for many theorists\nwho wish to employ the notion of nonconceptual content to explain the\nbehavior of nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures (depending, of\ncourse, on how demanding their notion of a concept is). Similarly for\nthose theorists who hold both that subpersonal computational states\npossess nonconceptual content and that the relevant modules can exist\nin creatures not capable of any conceptual thought.\n\nHowever, Christopher Peacocke offers an argument against the autonomy\nthesis; concluding that \u201c\u2026 nonconceptual content is not a\nlevel whose nature is completely explicable without reference to\nconceptual contents \u2026 At the most basic level, conceptual and\nnonconceptual content must be elucidated simultaneously\u201d\n(Peacocke 1992, pp. 90\u201391). His argument is based on a\nneo-Kantian understanding of the relation between experience of an\nobjective world and self-consciousness. In essence he suggests that no\ncreature can properly be attributed states with genuine spatial\ncontents unless it grasps the distal environment in a minimally\nobjective way. A condition on grasping the distal environment in this\nway is that the organism is capable of utilizing such states in\nforming and updating an integrated representation of the layout of its\nenvironment and is thus able to reidentify particular locations within\nit. The requirement of concept possession comes in because these\ncapacities essentially involve an ability to represent both the\nspatial configuration of the environment and one\u2019s own changing\nposition within that environment\u2014and, he suggests, this would be\nimpossible for a creature lacking a rudimentary concept of the\nfirst-person.\n\nThis argument is powerful, but can be challenged. Supporters of the\nautonomy thesis, beginning with Berm\u00fadez (1994), have suggested\nthat the interrelated capacities to represent the spatial\nconfiguration of the environment and to represent one\u2019s own\nlocation within the environment need not depend on the possession of a\nprimitive first-person concept. Rather, these capacities can be\nunderstood at the nonconceptual level. In particular, Berm\u00fadez\n(1995, 1998) appeals to the notion of a nonconceptual point of view to\nexplain the interdependence of spatial awareness of the distal\nenvironment and awareness of one\u2019s own location within that\nenvironment at the nonconceptual level. For further discussion of this\ntype of nonconceptual self-consciousness see section\n 7.\n\nPeacocke himself eventually accepted the Autonomy Thesis on the\ngrounds that the capacities mentioned in the conditions for a state to\nhave genuine objective spatial content do not necessitate a conceptual\nnotion of the first-person; indeed, he agrees with Berm\u00fadez\nthat these capacities can be accounted for nonconceptually and without\ninvolving any first-person notion (Peacocke 2002).\n",
