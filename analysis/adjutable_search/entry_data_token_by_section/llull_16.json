    "main_text": "The Ars\n5. The Ars\n\nThe Ars, or to be more precise, the development through\nnumerous texts of a combining logical system to reveal the truth, is\nthe most important and original product of Ramon Llull\u2019s\nphilosophy, and the main core of his work.\n\nIts development is divided into two great phases. The first one is\ncalled the Quaternary Phase, for it is organized based on the model of\nthe four elements which form the base of the majority of the analogies\nused by Llull. The Quaternary Phase comprises two main texts: the\nArs compendiosa inveniendi veritatem, written by Llull\nfollowing the revelation of the Art at the Puig de Randa\nMount in 1274, and the Ars demonstrativa in 1283, in addition\nto other texts that comment or explain the Ars. The second\nphase is known as Ternary Period, for it follows the structure of a\ntrinity. It began with the criticism experienced in Paris with the\nArs inventiva veritatis (1290), followed by the modification\nof the Tabula generalis (1293\u20134), and it concludes with\nthe Ars generalis ultima (1305\u20138) and its abbreviated\nversion, which incidentally had the most comments and discussions\nduring the Renaissance, the Ars brevis of 1308.\n\nThe Ars was conceived by Ramon Llull as an instrument for an\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. Thus, it was to be a tool\nto aid the missionaries\u2019 work. Giles (2020, 4) had pointed out\nLlull\u2019s openness \u201cto convince religious others of Christian\ntruth, not through the rhetoric of polemics or by strategically quoting\nauthorities, but through methods of discussing or debating spiritual\ndifference and acknowledging shared traditions\u201d.\n\nAs a result, Llull did not structure this work based on the main\nChristian dogmas, the Trinity and the Incarnation, but on the common\nprinciples to the three religions of the book. As Rubio (2008a: 245)\nargues, \u201cthe secret of the Art consists of its demonstrating\nthat the accepted world view implies the Christian view of\nGod\u201d.\n\nStudies on the Ars (Ruiz Sim\u00f3n 1998; Rubio 2008a;\nJaulent 2010) show that it addresses the criticism made by Llull to\nScholastic logic. This criticism has two great stages: on the one\nhand, the insufficiency of the demonstration by syllogisms\u2014the\nbasis of all Scholastic science\u2014to reveal new truths, because it\nonly explicitly states the relationship between known facts and\nevident principles (Ruiz Sim\u00f3n 1998), thus relegating\ndialectics (or ars inveniendi), which consists of finding\narguments and counterarguments based on some loci or\n\u201cplaces\u201d, to the domain of opinion. On the other hand,\nthis criticism (Jaulent 2010) addresses the fact that demonstration by\nsyllogisms only works through second intentions, that is, it describes\nrelationships within logical propositions and not according to objects\nin reality, which are conceptualized as first intentions.\n\nLlull\u2019s Ars would seek to form a logic system different\nto the scholastic one, through which novel truths that describe not\nonly logical relationships, but also metaphysical relationships, can\nbe discovered. According to Ruiz Sim\u00f3n (1998) and Bonner\n(2007), the Ars is defined by Llull based on four adjectives:\ncompendioso and inventivo, like its first version;\ndemostrativo, as in the second one; and general, in\nthe final phase: (1) compendioso, for it is from some limited\nprinciples that an unlimited number of arguments can be found; (2)\ninventivo, because, through its combining mechanism, it makes\nit possible to find those arguments; (3) demostrativo,\nbecause it allows one to reach necessary conclusions; (4) and\ngeneral, because it encompasses both real and logical\nobjects, and it is thus applicable to any topic.\n\nTherefore, the Ars is a system to access any logical or\nmetaphysical truth, a means to find novel arguments, an instrument to\naccess all general and particular knowledge, a tool for the missionary\nthat seeks to refute the arguments of the infidels and a way to enact\nvirtues and suppress vices. \n",
