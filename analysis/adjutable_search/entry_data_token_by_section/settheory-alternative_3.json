    "main_text": "Naive Set Theory\n2. Naive Set Theory\n\nIn the previous section, we took a completely intuitive approach to\nour applications of set theory. We assumed that the reader would go\nalong with certain ideas of what sets are like.\n\nWhat are the identity conditions on sets? It seems entirely in accord\nwith common sense to stipulate that a set is precisely determined by\nits elements: two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same if for every\n\\(x\\), either \\(x \\in A\\) and \\(x \\in B\\) or \\(x \\not\\in A\\) and \\(x\n\\not\\in B\\): \n\n\\[ A = B \\leftrightarrow \\forall x(x \\in A \\leftrightarrow x \\in B) \\]\n\n\nThis is called the axiom of extensionality.\n\nIt also seems reasonable to suppose that there are things which are\nnot sets, but which are capable of being members of sets (such objects\nare often called atoms or urelements). These objects\nwill have no elements (like the empty set) but will be distinct from\none another and from the empty set. This suggests the alternative\nweaker axiom of extensionality (perhaps actually closer to common\nsense), \n\n\\[ [\\textrm{set}(A) \\amp \\textrm{set}(B) \\amp \\forall x(x \\in A \\leftrightarrow x \\in B)] \\rightarrow A = B \\]\n\n\nwith an accompanying axiom of sethood \n\n\\[ x \\in A \\rightarrow \\textrm{ set}(A) \\]\n\n\nWhat sets are there? The simplest collections are given by enumeration\n(the set {Tom, Dick, Harry} of men I see\nover there, or (more abstractly) the set \\(\\{-2, 2\\}\\) of square roots\nof 4. But even for finite sets it is often more convenient to give a\ndefining property for elements of the set: consider the set of all\ngrandmothers who have a legal address in Boise, Idaho; this is a\nfinite collection but it is inconvenient to list its members. The\ngeneral idea is that for any property \\(P\\), there is a set of all\nobjects with property \\(P\\). This can be formalized as follows: For\nany formula \\(P(x)\\), there is a set \\(A\\) (the variable \\(A\\) should\nnot be free in \\(P(x))\\) such that \n\n\\[ \\forall x(x \\in A \\leftrightarrow P(x)). \\]\n\n\nThis is called the axiom of comprehension. If we have weak\nextensionality and a sethood predicate, we might want to say\n\n\\[ \\exists A(\\textrm{set}(A) \\amp \\forall x(x \\in A \\leftrightarrow P(x))) \\]\n\n\nThe theory with these two axioms of extensionality and comprehension\n(usually without sethood predicates) is called naive set\ntheory.\n\nIt is clear that comprehension allows the definition of finite sets:\nour set of men {Tom, Dick, Harry} can also\nbe written \\(\\{x \\mid {}\\) \\(x = \\textit{Tom}\\) \\({}\\lor{}\\) \\(x =\n\\textit{Dick}\\) \\({}\\lor{}\\) \\(x = \\textit{Harry}\\}\\). It also appears\nto allow for the definition of infinite sets, such as the set\n\\((\\{x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\mid x \\lt 0 \\lor x^2 \\lt 2\\}\\) mentioned above\nin our definition of the square root of 2.\n\nUnfortunately, naive set theory is inconsistent. Russell gave the most\nconvincing proof of this, although his was not the first paradox to be\ndiscovered: let \\(P(x)\\) be the property \\(x \\not\\in x\\). By the axiom\nof comprehension, there is a set \\(R\\) such that for any \\(x, x \\in\nR\\) iff \\(x \\not\\in x\\). But it follows immediately that \\(R \\in R\\)\niff \\(R \\not\\in R\\), which is a contradiction.\n\nIt must be noted that our formalization of naive set theory is an\nanachronism. Cantor did not fully formalize his set theory, so it\ncannot be determined whether his system falls afoul of the paradoxes\n(he did not think so, and there are some who agree with him now).\nFrege formalized his system more explicitly, but his system was not\nprecisely a set theory in the modern sense: the most that can be said\nis that his system is inconsistent, for basically the reason given\nhere, and a full account of the differences between Frege\u2019s\nsystem and our \u201cnaive set theory\u201d is beside the point\n(though historically certainly interesting).\n",
