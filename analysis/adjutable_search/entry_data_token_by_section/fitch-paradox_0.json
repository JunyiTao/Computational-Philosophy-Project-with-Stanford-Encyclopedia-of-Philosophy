    "main_text": "Brief History\n1. Brief History\n\nThe literature on the knowability paradox emerges in response to a\nproof first published by Frederic Fitch in his 1963 paper, \u201cA\nLogical Analysis of Some Value Concepts.\u201d Theorem 5, as it was\nthere called, threatens to collapse a number of modal and epistemic\ndifferences. Let ignorance be the failure to know some truth. Then\nTheorem 5 collapses a commitment to contingent ignorance into a\ncommitment to necessary ignorance. For it shows that the existence of\ntruths in fact unknown entails the existence of truths necessarily\nunknown. Formally, \n\n\\[\\tag{Theorem 5}\n\\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg Kp) \\vdash \\exists p(p \\wedge \\neg \\Diamond Kp).\n\\]\n\n\nThe converse of Theorem 5 is trivial (since truth entails\npossibility), so Fitch goes most of the way toward erasing any logical\ndifference between the existence of contingent ignorance and the\nexistence of necessary unknowability. \n\nIt is however the contrapositive of Theorem 5 that is usually referred\nto as the paradox: \n\n\\[\\tag{K Paradox} \n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp) \\vdash \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp).\n\\]\n\n\nIt tells us that if any truth can be known then it follows that every\ntruth is in fact known. \n\nThe earliest version of the proof was conveyed to Fitch by an\nanonymous referee in 1945. In 2005 we discovered that Alonzo Church\nwas that referee (Salerno 2009b). His reports are published in their\nentirety in Church (2009). Fitch apparently did not take the result to\nbe paradoxical. He published the proof in 1963 to avert a kind of\n\u201cconditional fallacy\u201d that threatened his informed-desire\nanalysis of value. The analysis roughly says: \\(x\\) is valuable\nto \\(s\\) just in case there is a truth \\(p\\) such that were\n\\(s\\) to known \\(p\\) then she would desire \\(x\\). The\nexistence of unknowable truths ultimately explains why he restricts\nthe propositional variables to knowable propositions. For an\nunknowable truth provides for an impossible antecedent in Fitch\u2019s\ncounterfactual, and ultimately trivializes the analysis. Since Fitch\u2019s\ntheory of value is not the context in which the paradox is widely\ndiscussed, we will say no more about it here. \n\nRediscovered in Hart and McGinn (1976) and Hart (1979), the result was\ntaken to be a refutation of verificationism, the view that all\nmeaningful statements (and so all truths) are verifiable. After all,\nif one accepts the knowability principle,\n\\(\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp)\\), she is\ncommitted to the absurd claim that all truths are known. Mackie (1980)\nand Routley (1981), among others at the time, point to difficulties\nwith this general position but ultimately agree that Fitch\u2019s result is\na refutation of the claim that all truths are knowable, and that\nvarious forms of verificationism are imperiled for related reasons.\nSince the early eighties, however, there has been considerable effort\nto analyze the proof as paradoxical. Why after all should it be that\nan epistemic theory of truth collapses possible knowledge into actual\nknowledge? Intuitively, that truth is to be understood in terms of the\nepistemic capacities of non-omniscient agents is at least a coherent\nposition\u2014a position distinct from and more plausible than the\nthesis that all truths are known. Moreover, it has been thought\nstrange that sophisticated versions of the epistemic theory of truth\nshould fall prey to such swift deduction. Hence, the Church-Fitch\nproof has come to be known as the paradox of knowability.\n\n\nThere is no consensus about whether and where the proof goes wrong. We\nuse this entry to lay out the proof and explore a range of proposed\ntreatments.\n",
