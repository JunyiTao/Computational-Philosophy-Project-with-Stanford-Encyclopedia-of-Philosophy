    "main_text": "Convention || Conventions of Language\n2.2 Conventions of Language\n\nIn the final chapter of Convention, Lewis gives his theory of\nwhat it is for a community to speak a language (see the section on\nconventional theories of meaning in the entry on\n convention),\n i.e., for a community to have adopted one language as their language\nby convention. Lewis individuates languages largely by the truth\nconditions they assign to sentences. And his account of truth\nconditions is given in terms of possible worlds. So the truth\ncondition of an indicative sentence is the set of possible worlds in\nwhich it is true. Somewhat more abnormally, Lewis takes the truth\ncondition for an imperative to be the set of possible worlds in which\nthe imperative is obeyed. (The account of language in\nConvention covers many different moods, but we will focus\nhere on the account of indicatives.)\n\nThe focus on truth conditions is not because Lewis thinks truth\nconditions are all that there are to languages. He acknowledges that\nlanguages also have \u2018grammars\u2019. A grammar, in\nLewis\u2019s sense, is a lexicon (i.e. a set of elementary\nconstituents, along with their interpretation), a generative component\n(i.e. rules for combining constituents into larger constituents), and\na representing component (i.e. rules for verbally expressing\nconstituents). Lewis\u2019s preferred interpretations are functions\nfrom possible worlds to extensions. So we can sensibly talk about the\nmeaning of a non-sentential constituent of the language, but these\nmeanings are derived from the truth conditions of sentences, rather\nthan determining the meanings of sentences. That\u2019s because, as\nwe\u2019ll see, what the conventions of language establish in the\nfirst instance are truth conditions for entire messages, i.e.,\nsentences.\n\nGiven this understanding of what a language is, Lewis goes on to say\nwhat it is for a population to speak a language. One natural approach\nwould be to say that speakers and hearers face a co-ordination\nproblem, and settling on one language to communicate in would be a\nsolution to that problem. When Lewis is analysing signalling, that is\nthe approach he takes. But he doesn\u2019t think it will work for\nlanguage in general. The reason is that he takes conventions to be\nregularities in action, and it is hard to say in general what actions\nare taken by hearers.\n\nSo instead Lewis says that a population P speaks a language\nL if and only if there is a convention of speaking truthfully\nin L that persists amongst P. The parties to the\nco-ordination problem (and the convention that solves it) are the\ndifferent people who want to communicate in P. They solve\ntheir problem by speaking truthfully (on the whole) in L.\n\nIt might be wondered whether it could really be a convention to speak\ntruthfully in L. After all, there is no obvious alternative\nto speaking truthfully. As Lewis points out, however, there are many\nnatural alternatives to speaking truthfully in L; we could\nspeak truthfully in L\u2032 instead. The existence of\nalternative languages makes our use of L conventional. And\nthe convention can be established, and persist, without anyone\nagreeing to it.\n",
