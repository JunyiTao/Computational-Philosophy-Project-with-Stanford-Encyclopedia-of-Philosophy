    "main_text": "The Roman Republic and Cicero || De legibus\n6.3 De legibus\n\nDe legibus, or On the Laws, is also written as a\ndialogue, but one set in Cicero\u2019s own day with himself, his\nbrother, and closest friend as the interlocutors, gathered at his\ncountry estate of Arpinum. Probably begun after De re\npublica, it was likewise written in the years immediately before\n51 BCE, and similarly survives only in piecemeal and fragmentary form.\nBooks I\u2013II treat natural law or ius naturae, with\n\u201cMarcus\u201d (Cicero himself) declaring that \u201claw is the\nhighest reason, rooted in nature\u201d (I.18), and that men, bound to\nthe gods by reason, are \u201cborn for justice\u201d\n(I.28\u201332). However, \u201cthe corruption of bad\nhabits\u2026extinguishes\u2026the sparks given by nature\u201d\n(I.33) and can result in the formation of bad laws. Such iniquitous\nlaws as those passed by tyrants are not just (I.42); nor is the title\nof law to be conferred upon \u201cwhat bandits have agreed among\nthemselves\u201d (II.13).\n\nIn Books II\u2013III, the speakers prescribe an ideal law code, based\non but modifying Roman law; notably, for example, the institution of\nthe tribunate is defended (III.16\u201317). As these prescriptions,\nand the circumstances of their writing (a temporary retreat from\nactive politics), suggest, Cicero had a complex attitude to the Greek\ndilemma posing the lives of philosophy and of politics as opposed\nalternatives. He saw philosophy as a source of insight and perspective\nrelevant to politics, but after his early studies, devoted himself to\nit primarily when temporarily debarred from more active pursuits. One\nmight say that philosophy became, beyond its intrinsic value, a form\nof alternative public service when the forum was too dangerous for him\nto enter (here following the reflection along these lines offered by\nBaraz 2012).\n6.4 De Officiis\n\n\u201cThe De officiis, not the De re publica, is\nCicero\u2019s Republic\u201d (Long 1995: 240). This dictum\nof A. A. Long holds true not only in the sense that for Cicero, as for\nPlato and Aristotle, ethics was inseparable from politics. It is true\nalso and more profoundly insofar as the De officiis takes up\nthe same subject as Plato\u2019s Republic, namely the\napparent conflict between justice and individual advantage, and\nproposes broadly the same resolution, namely that the conflict is only\never apparent: violating one\u2019s officia or duties can\nnever serve one\u2019s advantage so long as both are properly\nunderstood. Book I treats what is virtuous, or honestas; Book\nII treats what is advantageous, or utilitas; and Book III\nconsiders cases to show that any apparent conflict is illusory.\n\nThe most difficult case to resolve according to the overall argument\nof the book is that of advantage when understood as political\nambition, driven by greatness of spirit. As Cicero acknowledges, and\nas was especially true in the highest echelons of Roman society,\n\u201cMen are led most of all to being overwhelmed by forgetfulness\nof justice when they slip into desiring positions of command or honour\nor glory\u201d (I.26). The solution is to aim only at true glory,\nsuch as can be gained only through the fulfillment of one\u2019s\nofficia. Similar casuistry enables Cicero to resolve in\naccordance with his thesis a range of common cases where advantage\nmight be sought at the expense of justice (in administering the estate\nof an orphan, for example, a common duty of eminent Romans). Yet such\ncasuistry is always advanced within a context of celebration of\njustice and natural law: it is not simply that in fact justice never\nconflicts with advantage, but that justice properly understood is\nalways to one\u2019s advantage as a human being.\n\nAs in Plato, a redefinition of the virtues plays a crucial role in the\noverall argument for the benefits of justice. For Cicero, the virtues\nare Romanized as officia, understood not only as duties in\nthe abstract but rather as obligations of role or relationship, each\nattaching to someone in virtue of a distinct persona (whether\nas father, consul, neighbor, and so on, or simply as a human being).\nSome virtues are rooted in one\u2019s persona as a human\nbeing subject to natural law, others in the specific roles and customs\nof one\u2019s city. Four principal virtues are identified: wisdom;\njustice, resting on fides (good faith and credit) and respect\nfor property; greatness of spirit; and decorum. Respect for property\nis a keystone of Cicero\u2019s political thought, here very far from\nthe current in Platonism which subordinated property to civic\nharmony.\n\nStrikingly, whereas tyrannicide might appear to be a difficult case\nfor such an ethical code to confront, Cicero presents it\u2014writing \nlater in the year that Caesar was assassinated\u2014as the\nstraightforwardly ethically correct choice. Cicero couches his case in\nStoic terms of naturalness and fellowship (Dyck 1996, ad loc.\nto Off.III.29\u201332). His pivotal move is to deny that\ntyrants are party to the otherwise universal nature of human\nfellowship. Thus he asserts that \u201cthere can be no fellowship\nbetween us and tyrants\u2026just as some limbs are amputated if they\nare\u2026harming other parts of the body, similarly if the wildness\nand monstrousness of a beast appears in human form, it must be removed\nfrom the common humanity\u2026of the body\u201d\n(Off.III.32: ostensibly about the tyrant Phalaris).\n7. Political Philosophy in the Roman Empire\n\nAlthough Rome ruled over an empire long before Cicero died, and the\nrepublican constitution that he had served would remain formally\nintact in many respects long after that date as well, the imperial era\nof Roman government is standardly associated with the elevation of\nOctavian by the Senate in 27 BCE by according him the title of\n\u201cAugustus\u201d (among other novel titles and combinations of\noffices that he was then and later accorded). Octavian and a number of\nhis successors were also referred to as the princeps,\nliterally the first man, implicitly the first among nominal equals,\nsometimes translated by the English derivation \u2018prince\u2019,\nand so giving rise to the description of the period from 27\nBCE\u2013284 CE as the Principate (to be followed in turn by the\nDominate). In this period, Stoicism continued to exercise an important\nhold, drawing in part on the Hellenistic genre of advice to kings;\nPlatonism too, and forms of Pythagoreanism, regained much sway.\nMoreover, a number of Stoic-minded writers and orators played their\nparts in Roman political life, some fashioning the life of a\nphilosopher itself into a distinctive form of what might be called\nnon-political politics (Trapp 2007). In this article, I cannot explore\nthe full ramifications of these philosophical developments under the\nEmpire, in writers in Greek as well as in Latin, and influencing not\nonly pagan but also Jewish and Christian thinkers. The article also\nleaves aside the many and varied important contributions to political\nthought in Rome and its possessions made not by philosophers but by\nhistorians, including Livy, Sallust, Diodorus Siculus, Tacitus, and\nSuetonius. (Again, for an overview that seeks to integrate political\nand historical developments with political theorizing, see J.W. Atkins\n2018.)\n7.1 Later Stoicism\n\nIf Cicero as a new man made senator had to contend with the\ncompetitive pressures of republican politics, Seneca (c. 3\nBCE\u201365 CE), as a new man (from Spain) made senator a century\nlater, had to contend with the problem of advising, and surviving, the\npoisonous politics of intimacy with the princeps. For Seneca,\nStoic philosophy (of which he was an avowed exponent, though other\nphilosophical influences can also be found in his ideas), can be best\nsquared with politics if the ruler is supremely virtuous: in that\ncase, the Stoic wise man is the king or prince.\n\nLike Cicero, Seneca wrote essays in natural as well as political\nphilosophy, including for example a significant analysis of the give\nand take of benefits or reciprocal gifts and favors in political life\n(De beneficiis, recently translated afresh by Griffin and\nInwood, 2011), and even a De officiis (which is lost). Like\nCicero, he wrote important collections of letters (and where Cicero\nwrote poetry, Seneca also wrote plays). The letters include his\ndistinctive \u201cconsolations\u201d which would inaugurate a new\nphilosophical and literary genre (see the entry on\n Seneca).\n\nIn this large corpus, arguably his most important surviving work for\npolitical philosophy is his De clementia (\u201cOn\nMercy\u201d), addressed to the emperor Nero whom he served as tutor\n(in rhetoric, not in philosophy) and later in the capacity of\nofficially designated amicus or friend (Veyne 2003, vii, 19).\nPresented as a \u201cmirror\u201d in which Nero could see himself\nand the consequences of his virtue (1.1.1), this text would become a\nfountainhead of the \u201cmirror for princes\u201d genre in\nsubsequent centuries. The challenge was how to reconcile the virtue of\njustice with that of clementia, clemency or mercy, a\ndistinctively Roman virtue (not corresponding exactly to any Greek\nword: Braund 2009, 33) that had been incorporated into public life as\na virtue of the Roman people (clementia populi Romani) and\nattributed specifically in cultic form to Caesar Augustus (previously\nOctavian) as clementia Caesaris (included as one of\n\u201cthe four virtues attributed to Augustus on an honorific\nshield,\u201d as observed by Griffin 2000: 540; see more generally\nFlamerie de Lachapelle 2011). Appealing to the related Stoic virtue of\nphilanthr\u00f4pia in Greek, humanitas in Latin, or\nlove of humankind, Seneca claimed that, by taking into account all the\ncircumstances of the affair, clemency can claim to embody, as it were,\na more perfect justice (iustissimum), than would the\nobservance of the strict letter of the law (2.7.3, as discussed by\nBraund 2009, 66\u201370).\n\nSeneca manages to defend clemency\u2019s claim to the rank of virtue\nby distinguishing it both from its opposite, crudelitas or\ncruelty, and from a related disposition, misericordia, pity\nor compassion, which for the Stoics counted as a vice (2.4.4). The\nStoic sage will exercise clemency by attending to the circumstances\nand causes of the criminal\u2019s act, but also by seeking in various\nways to improve the latter\u2019s character (1.14.1\u20133,\n1.16.1\u20133), an approach that goes back at least to Plato\n(Prt. 324a\u2013c, Grg.469a\u2013b), doing so with\nparsimony and discernment between those who are curable and those who\nare not (again with Plato, Grg.525a\u2013526b). Indeed,\nSeneca asserts that those who are curable will generally strive\nsubsequently to become worthy of the clemency shown to them by the\nprince (2.2.1), a principle illustrated by the story of\nAugustus\u2019 clemency toward the conspirator Cnaeus Cornelius\nCinna, who would become his lifelong friend (1.9). In good Stoic\nfashion, Seneca finally shows that the virtue of clemency is both\nvaluable in itself and also beneficial. It sustains the rule of a\nprince by inspiring love in his subjects (1.19.6), whereas cruelty\naugments the number of his enemies (1.8.7). And conversely, whereas\nmisericordia wallows in a wrongful and inefficient emotional\npity for the treatment that justice would prescribe of the criminal\n(2.6.1), clemency improves the criminal more efficiently than cruelty\nwould do (1.22.1), and for this and other reasons better aims at the\ngood of mankind. It is worth noting finally that, while Seneca\nspecifies that clemency should also extend to slaves, his\ncosmopolitanism stopped short of advocating their manumission or the\nabolition of slavery (Griffin 1992:\n 256\u201385).[15]\n\nSeneca did not limit himself to the political function of advising\nrulers. Instead, he conceived the role of philosophy as benefiting\npeople generally, in the widest sense of a cosmopolitan ethics and\neven politics. His De otio (\u201cOn Leisure\u201d)\ncontrasts the single commonwealth embracing gods and men in a cosmic\ncitizenship, with the ordinary multiple commonwealths to which the\naccidents of birth assign us (though these also rightly command\nallegiance) (4.1). Should such an ordinary regime turn lethal, the\nphilosopher remains a citizen of the cosmic commonwealth, and so his\nserenity can and should remain intact. That fate befell Seneca himself\nin 65 CE, when Nero accused him of conspiring in a planned\nassassination of the emperor and ordered him to commit suicide. To be\nsure, however, Seneca\u2019s suicide reflected not only political\nobedience, but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, the belief,\npreviously expressed in his writings (in particular De\nprovidentia and De ira, as well as his letters) that\nsuicide is a supreme mark of freedom. No tyranny can so enslave us as\nto take away this freedom: a freedom to act based on the inner\nliberation of realizing that death and other worldly losses are in\nfact indifferent and irrelevant to happiness (Inwood 2005:\n307\u20139).\n\nSeneca was far from the only Stoic politically active in his day or in\nsuccessive generations. Others like Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus\nunder Nero, Helvidius Priscus under Vespasian, and Paconius Agrippinus\nunder Tiberius, chose to defy those whom they saw as tyrannical\nrulers, becoming known as the so-called \u2018Stoic martyrs\u2019.\n(On the varieties of Stoicism under the principate, see the classic\nstudy of Brunt 2013, originally published in 1975.) Some Stoics spoke\nout against a wider range of customs that they took to be cruel or\nunfounded or otherwise irrational, most notably Musonius Rufus against\nsuch practices as the Athenians\u2019 holding of gladiatorial games\nin the same theatre of Dionysus where they celebrated religious\nfestivals (assuming that it is indeed he who is described in Dio\nChrysostom\u2019s Orationes XXXI, 122), and against the\nsocial convention of excluding women from philosophizing (for his\nfragments, see King 2011). Yet these later Stoics made rather few\ndetailed contributions to political philosophy, even if their\nfundamental analysis of living according to nature and reason, as\nfurther developed by figures ranging from the once-enslaved Epictetus\nto the emperor Marcus Aurelius, remained an important touchstone for\nthinking about politics.\n7.2 Platonisms and Other Philosophies in the Empire\n\nWhile the men of affairs in the Roman Senate and imperial court turned\noften (though not exclusively) to Stoicism, in the Greek centers of\nphilosophy and among provincial Greek men of affairs Platonism\nremained an important framework for thinking about both ethics and\npolitics, as did a related if somewhat shadowy form of\n Pythagoreanism\n which can be seen as a continuation of the genre of Hellenistic\nkingship treatises (Centrone 2000). The most important contributions\nmade to political thought by the Platonist philosopher of the\nsecond-century AD, Plutarch (c.46\u2013c.120 CE), are his paired\nbiographical lives of Greek and Roman statesmen, each with a\ncomparison drawing political morals. Together with the histories of\nThucydides, Livy and Sallust, these Lives instructed\ngenerations of students in the principles and perils of political\nethics, and instituted the distinction between statesman and demagogue\nas we have come to know it today: with figures like the fifth-century\nBCE Athenian \u201cAristides the Just\u201d embodying the ideal\nstatesmen, in contrast to the Platonic view of all past and present\nstatesmen as fatally flawed. Plutarch also made important\ncontributions to political philosophy in the many essays collected in\nhis volumes of Moralia.\n\nPlutarch was a committed but in some ways revisionist Platonist. His\nattitude to public life was more Roman than Platonic (befitting the\nrole in public affairs that he played in his own city): the political\nlife was for him unproblematically noble, not inferior to the life of\nphilosophy. Similarly, he revised the strict Platonic dictum that\nphilosophers must rule by allowing that philosophers might rule merely\nin the sense of advising rulers, not of being rulers themselves. (In\nfact, this move had some Platonic pedigree in the\nStatesman\u2019s insistence that the science of statecraft\nis the same whether known and exercised by an advisor or by an actual\nruler (259a).) And he considered philosophy to be more of a\ncharacter-building study than a source of knowledge of exact or\npolitically relevant knowledge. Where statesmen were educated in\nphilosophy, as for example in the Lives of Pericles, Cicero,\nBrutus, and Cato Minor, he treats this as valuable mainly because of\nthe virtue\u2014in particular, moderation and\nself-restraint\u2014which it imparts to them (Van Raalte 2005). The\nstudy of philosophy serves as a sort of inoculation against greed and\nimmoderate ambition. But it need not impart any particular substantive\nknowledge to the statesman (so competing philosophies could all be\nuseful in shaping virtue: Anaxagaorean influence on Pericles, an\neclectic mixture of Stoicism, Academic skepticism, and Platonism on\nCicero; Stoicism on the younger Cato). Indeed, excessively rigid\nadherence to a philosophy could be deleterious, making a statesman\nrigid and inflexible. The younger Cato was defeated when he stood for\nthe consulship because, Plutarch says, he experienced the same thing\nthat happens to fruits that appear \u201cout of season\u201d\n(Phoc. 3.1). Like such fruits, he was admired, but \u201cthe\nweight and grandeur\u201d of his virtue was \u201cout of all\nproportion to the immediate times\u201d (asummetron tois\nkathest\u014dsi kairois, Phoc. 3.2\u20133).\n\nPlutarch\u2019s political sympathies lay with monarchy. He treated\nthe exemplary Greek or Roman statesman as inherently and ideally a\nkind of monarchical figure, even when functioning within a democratic\nor republican environment. \u201cAristocratic and kingly\u201d was\nhis praise for Pericles\u2019 type of true statesmanship (literally,\nhis \u201cpolitics\u201d or \u201cpolicy\u201d,\npoliteia), once he has given up his initial recourse to\ndemagogic methods (Per.14.2). Thus for all his admiration for\nGreek statesmen of the classical age, and his profound later influence\non republican sentiments in Europe, Plutarch preferred monarchy as the\nbest constitution and believed that he was following his master Plato\nin so doing. As John Dillon puts it, he held \u201cthat the\naccomplished statesman, like a first-rate musician, will be able to\nmake the best of any of the three basic constitutions [monarchy,\naristocracy, or democracy] that he is given to work on\u201d (Dillon\n1997). To quote Plutarch himself on this point from his fragmentary\nwriting \u201cOn Monarchy, Democracy, and Oligarchy\u201d:\n\n\u2026if he [the statesman] is given the choice among governments,\nlike so many tools, he would follow Plato\u2019s advice and choose no\nother than monarchy, the only one which is able to sustain that top\nnote of virtue, high in the highest sense, and never let it be tuned\ndown under compulsion or expediency. For the other forms of government\nin a certain sense, although controlled by the statesman, control him,\nand although carried along by him, carry him along, since he has no\nfirmly established strength to oppose those from whom his strength is\nderived\u2026. (Peri mon. 827bc)\n\n\nPlato\u2019s collective virtuous aristocracy in the Republic\n(his philosopher-kings and -queens, in the plural), was transmuted by\nPlutarch, perhaps under the influence of the singular kingly political\nexpert in the Statesman, into a monarchical\n ideal.[16]\n\nLater Platonic philosophers, known as Neoplatonists (see the entry on\n Plotinus),\n also focused primarily on ethics in the context of cosmology and\ntheology, stressing the ascent of the soul to a disembodied pure\nunderstanding of the One. Yet they made room for the political virtues\nof the embodied soul as a first step in this process of divinization\nor \u201cbecoming like God\u201d (O\u2019Meara 2003). In working\nout the political implications of such views, Plato\u2019s\nLaws became an important model for theocratic political\nreform, especially as Neoplatonism became influential for a certain\nstrand of Christian thinkers, in particular those able to absorb the\ntranslation of Greek texts into Arabic.\n8. Conclusion\n\nOn a continuum of political rule stretching from the sheer domination\nof some over others on one extreme, to a vision of collaborative\ndeliberation among equals for the sake of the good life on the other,\nmany ancient Greek and Roman political philosophers clearly staked out\nthe latter ground. The very idea of the city and the civic bond as\nrooted in justice was common ground across much of the spectrum of\nancient political philosophy. Even the Epicureans saw society as\nrooted in justice, although understanding justice in turn as rooted in\n utility.[17]\n Philosophers adhering to this approach were not however ignorant of\npossible objections to it. The diagnosis of politics as domination has\nnever been more powerfully advanced than by Plato\u2019s character\nThrasymachus, nor has the attack on justice as a good life for the\nindividual ever been as powerfully made as by Plato\u2019s character\nCallicles or the skeptic Carneades. The nostalgic view of ancient\npolitical philosophy as predicated on widely shared conceptions of\nhuman nature and the human good, before the splintering and fracturing\nof modernity, is an oversimplification.\n\nIt is true that those ancient visions of politics which rooted\nthemselves in a commitment to ethical cultivation and the common good\ndid not have to contend with the absolutist claims of rival versions\nof monotheistic religions. But the ancients did have to answer various\nforms of relativism, immoralism, and skepticism, contending with rival\nphilosophical schools which disagreed profoundly with one another. If\nsome of them chose to see politics as a domain of common benefit and a\nspace for the cultivation of virtue, this was not because it had not\noccurred to them that it could be thought of otherwise, but in part\nbecause they had developed powerful philosophical systems to support\nthis view. The experience and practices of the Greek poleis\n(the plural of polis) and the Roman res publica\nplayed important roles in shaping these approaches.\n\nPlato and Aristotle can in many ways be seen as defending some\nfundamental tenets of Greek ethics (such as the value of justice), but\ndoing so by means of advancing revisionist philosophical doctrines and\ndistancing themselves from the ways in which those tenets were\ninterpreted by the democratic institutions of their day. The range of\nethical and political views which they, along with their Hellenistic\nsuccessors, laid out, continue to define many of the fundamental\nchoices for modern philosophy, despite the many important innovations\nin institutional form and intellectual approach which have been made\nsince. Many of those innovations, indeed, came in response to a\nrevival of the ancient skeptical and relativist challenges: challenges\nalready known from their evolution within ancient political philosophy\nitself.",
