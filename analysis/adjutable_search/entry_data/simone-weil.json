    "preamble": "\n\nSimone Weil (1909\u20131943) philosophized on thresholds and across\nborders. Her persistent desire for truth and justice led her to both\nelite academies and factory floors, political praxis and spiritual\nsolitude. At different times she was an activist, a pacifist, a\nmilitant, a mystic, and an exile; but throughout, in her inquiry into\nreality and orientation to the good, she remained a philosopher. Her\noeuvre features deliberate contradiction yet demonstrates remarkable\nclarity. It is value centered and integrated but not systematic. It\ncontains scattered notes of her translations of and commentaries on\nseveral ancient Greek texts, Pythagorean geometry formulae, and\ndetailed accounts of her daily tasks within a factory; but her oeuvre\nis also composed of addresses to political, industrial, and religious\nleaders as well as pieces intended for university students, radical\nmilitants, industrial workers, and farm laborers. In both her life and\nher thought\u2014itself an unstable distinction with respect to\nWeil\u2014she is a philosopher of margins and paradoxes. In part\nbecause Weil\u2019s thought defies categorization, the ways in which\nher ideas are taken up often say as much about her commentator as they\ndo about her. She was taken as a prototype for Albert Camus\u2019s\nr\u00e9volt\u00e9s and praised by Andr\u00e9 Gide as\n\u201cthe patron saint of all outsiders\u201d. Giorgio Agamben\ndescribed her conscience as \u201cthe most lucid of our times\u201d,\nand Hannah Arendt claimed that perhaps only Weil treated the subject\nof labor \u201cwithout prejudice and sentimentality\u201d. Maurice\nBlanchot described Weil as an \u201cexceptional figure\u201d who\noffers \u201can example of certitude\u201d in the modern world, and\nIris Murdoch wrote of \u201ca profoundly disciplined life behind her\nwritings\u201d that gave \u201can authority which cannot be\nimitated\u201d. But Weil was also criticized by Leon Trotsky as a\n\u201cmelancholy revolutionary\u201d and disparaged as\n\u201ccrazy\u201d by Charles de Gaulle. These remarks, however,\nbetray an irony of which Weil was well aware and about which she was\ndeeply concerned near the end of her life, namely, that her person\nwould be considered more than her thought. By categorically focusing\non the philosophical concepts Weil articulated and developed, this\nentry presents her philosophy while speaking to her concern.\n\nFollowing Weil\u2019s philosophical development, her central concepts\nare addressed under five categories: social-political philosophy,\nepistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, and\naesthetics. The periodization employed is as follows: 1925\u20131934\n(early), 1935\u20131939 (middle), 1939\u20131943 (late). It is\nimportant to note that, given Weil\u2019s rejection of systematicity\nand development of concepts, these categories and periods introduce a\ndegree of artifice into her thought. The conclusion of this entry\nreports on her reception among the Continental and Anglo-American\ntraditions of philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Philosophical Development\n\nSimone Weil was born in Paris on 3 February 1909. Her parents, both of\nwhom came from Jewish families, provided her with an assimilated,\nsecular, bourgeois French childhood that was cultured and comfortable.\nWeil and her older brother Andr\u00e9\u2014himself a math prodigy,\nfounder of the Bourbaki group, and a distinguished mathematician at\nthe Princeton Institute for Advanced Study\u2014studied at\nprestigious Parisian schools. Weil\u2019s first philosophy teacher,\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Victor-Duruy, was Ren\u00e9 Le Senne; it was he\nwho introduced her to the thesis\u2014which she would\nmaintain\u2014that contradiction is a theoretical obstacle generative\nof nuanced, alert thinking. Beginning in October 1925, Weil studied at\nHenri IV Lyc\u00e9e in preparation for the entrance exams of the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. At Henri IV she studied under\nthe philosopher and essayist \u00c9mile-Auguste Chartier (known\npseudonymously as Alain), whose teacher was Jules Lagneau. Like Weil\nat this time, Alain was agnostic. In his classes he emphasized\nintellectual history: in philosophy this included Plato, Marcus\nAurelius, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant, and in literature, Homer,\nAeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Already sympathetic with the\ndowntrodden and critical of French society, she gained the theoretical\ntools to levy critiques against her country and philosophical\ntradition in Alain\u2019s class. There, employing paradox and\nattention through the form of the essay (it is important to note that\nnone of her writings was published as a book in her lifetime), she\nbegan intentionally developing what would become her distinct mode of\nphilosophizing. It is therefore arguable that she is part of the\nAlain/Lagneau line of voluntarist, spiritueliste philosophy\nin France.\n\nIn 1928 Weil began her studies at the \u00c9cole Normale. She was\nthe only woman in her class, the first woman having been first\nadmitted in 1917. In 1929\u20131930 she worked on her dissertation on\nknowledge and perception in Descartes, and having received her\nagr\u00e9gation diploma, she served from late 1931 to\nmid-1934 as a teacher at lyc\u00e9es. Throughout this\nperiod, outside of her duties at each lyc\u00e9e where she\ninstructed professionally, Weil taught philosophy to, lobbied for, and\nwrote on behalf of workers\u2019 groups; at times, moreover, she\nherself joined in manual labor. In her early thinking she prized at\nonce the first-person perspective and radical skepticism of Descartes,\nthe class-based solidarity and materialist analysis of Marx, and the\nmoral absolutism and respect for the individual of Kant. Drawing from\neach, her early work can be read as an attempt to provide, with a view\ntoward liberty, her own analysis of the fundamental causes of\noppression in society.\n\nIn early August 1932, Weil travelled to Germany in order to understand\nbetter the conditions fostering Nazism. German trade unions, she wrote\nto friends upon her return to France, were the single force in Germany\nable to generate a revolution, but they were fully reformist. Long\nperiods of unemployment left many Germans without energy or esteem. At\nbest, she observed frankly, they could serve as a kind of dead weight\nin a revolution. More specifically, by early 1933 she criticized the\ntendency of social organizations to engender bureaucracy, which\nelevated management and collective thinking over and against the\nindividual worker. Against this tendency, she advocated for\nworkers\u2019 understanding the physical labor they performed within\nthe context of the whole organizational apparatus. In\n\u201cReflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social\nOppression\u201d (1934), Weil presented both a summation of her early\nthought and a prefiguring of central elements in her thematic\ntrajectory. The essay employs a Marxian method of analysis that pays\nattention to the oppressed, critiques her own position as an\nintellectual, privileges manual labor, and demands precise and\nunorthodox individual thinking that unites theory and practice against\ncollective clich\u00e9s, propaganda, obfuscation, and\nhyper-specialization. These ideas would provide a theoretical\nframework for her idiosyncratic practice of philosophy. Near the end\nof her life she wrote in a notebook: \u201cPhilosophy (including\nproblems of cognition, etc.) is exclusively an affair of\naction and practice\u201d (FLN 362).\n\nOn 20 June, 1934, Weil applied for a sabbatical from teaching. She was\nto spend a year working in Parisian factories as part of its most\noppressed group, unskilled female laborers. Weil\u2019s \u201cyear\nof factory work\u201d (which amounted, in actuality, to around 24\nweeks of laboring) was not only important in the development of her\npolitical philosophy but can also be seen as a turning point in her\nslow religious evolution.\n\nIn Paris\u2019s factories, Weil began to see and to comprehend\nfirsthand the normalization of brutality in modern industry. There,\nshe wrote in her \u201cFactory Journal\u201d, \u201c[t]ime was an\nintolerable burden\u201d (FW 225) as modern factory work comprised\ntwo elements principally: orders from superiors and, relatedly,\nincreased speeds of production. While the factory managers continued\nto demand more, both fatigue and thinking (itself less likely under\nsuch conditions) slowed work. As a result, Weil felt dehumanized.\nPhenomenologically, her factory experience was less one of physical\nsuffering per se, and more one of humiliation. Weil was\nsurprised that this humiliation produced not rebellion but rather\nfatigue and docility. She described her experience in factories as a\nkind of \u201cslavery\u201d. On a trip to Portugal in August 1935,\nupon watching a procession to honor the patron saint of fishing\nvillagers, she had her first major contact with Christianity and wrote\nthat\n\n\nthe conviction was suddenly borne in upon [her] that Christianity is\npre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help\nbelonging to it, and [she] among others. (1942 \u201cSpiritual\nAutobiography\u201d in WFG 21\u201338, 26)\n\n\nIn comparison with her pre-factory \u201cTestament\u201d, we see\nthat in her \u201cFactory Journal\u201d Weil maintains the language\nof liberty, but she moves terminologically from\n\u201coppression\u201d to \u201chumiliation\u201d and\n\u201caffliction\u201d. Thus her conception and description of\nsuffering thickened and became more personal at this time.\n\nWeil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and, moreover,\nplanned on returning to factory work. Her trajectory shifted, however,\nwith the advent of the Spanish Civil War. On the level of geopolitics,\nshe was critical of both civil and international war, and she approved\nof France\u2019s decision not to intervene on the Republican side. On\nthe level of individual commitment, however, she obtained\njournalist\u2019s credentials and joined an international anarchist\nbrigade. On 20 August, 1936, Weil, clumsy and nearsighted, stepped in\na pot of boiling oil, severely burning her lower left leg and instep.\nOnly her parents could persuade her not to return to combat. By late\n1936 Weil wrote against French colonization of Indochina, and by early\n1937 she argued against French claims to Morocco and Tunisia. In April\n1937 she travelled to Italy. Within the basilica Santa Maria degli\nAngeli, inside the small twelfth-century Romanesque chapel where St.\nFrancis prayed, Weil had her second significant contact with\nChristianity. As she would later describe in a letter,\n\u201c[S]omething stronger than I compelled me for the first time to\ngo down on my knees\u201d (WFG 26).\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938 Weil revisited her Marxian commitments, arguing\nthat there is a central contradiction in Marx\u2019s thought:\nalthough she adhered to his method of analysis and demonstration that\nthe modern state is inherently oppressive\u2014being that it is\ncomposed of the army, police, and bureaucracy\u2014she continued to\nreject any positing of revolution as immanent or determined. Indeed,\nin Weil\u2019s middle period, Marx\u2019s confidence in history\nseemed to her a worse ground for judgment than Machiavelli\u2019s\nemphasis on contingency.\n\nDuring the week of Easter 1938, Weil visited the Benedictine abbey of\nSolesmes from Palm Sunday to the following Tuesday. At Solesmes she\nhad her third contact with Christianity: suffering from headaches,\nWeil found a joy so pure in Gregorian chant that, by analogy, she\ngained an understanding\n\n\nof the possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction.\nIt goes without saying that in the course of these services the\nthought of the passion of Christ entered into [her] being once and for\nall. (WFG 26)\n\n\nAt Solesmes, she was also introduced to the seventeenth century poet\nGeorge Herbert by a young Englishman she met there. She claimed to\nfeel Christ\u2019s presence while reciting Herbert\u2019s poem\n\u201cLove\u201d. As she fixed her full attention on the poem while\nsuffering from her most intense headache, Weil came to see that her\nrecitation had the virtue of prayer, saying, \u201cChrist himself\ncame down and took possession of me\u201d (WFG 27). Importantly, she\nthought God \u201cin his mercy\u201d had prevented her from reading\nthe mystics until that point; therefore, she could not say that she\ninvented her unexpected contact with Christ (WFG 27). These events and\nwritings in 1936\u20131938 exemplify the mutually informing nature of\nsolidarity and spirituality in Weil\u2019s thought that began in\nAugust 1935.\n\nAfter the military alliance of Germany and Italy in May 1939, Weil\nrenounced her pacifism. It was not that she felt she was wrong in\nholding such a position before, but rather that now, she argued,\nFrance was no longer strong enough to remain generous or merely\ndefensive. Following the German Western offensive, she left Paris with\nher family in June 1940, on the last train. They settled eventually\nbut temporarily in Marseilles, at the time the main gathering point\nfor those attempting to flee France, and where Weil would work with\nthe Resistance.\n\nIn Vichy France Weil took up a practice she had long sought, namely,\nto apprentice herself to the life of agricultural laborers. In\naddition, in Marseilles she was introduced to the Dominican priest\nJoseph-Marie Perrin, who became a close friend as well as a spiritual\ninterlocutor, and through whom she began to consider the question of\nbaptism. In an effort to help Weil find a job as an agricultural\nlaborer, Perrin turned to his friend Gustave Thibon, a Catholic writer\nwho owned a farm in the Ard\u00e9che region. Thus in Fall 1941 Weil\nworked in the grape harvest. Importantly, however, she was not treated\nlike the rest of the laborers; although she worked a full eight hours\nper day, she resided and ate at the house of her employers. She\nreportedly carried Plato\u2019s Symposium with her in the\nvineyards and attempted to teach the text to her fellow laborers.\n\nIn 1942 Weil agreed to leave France in part so her parents would be in\na safe place (they would not leave without her, she knew), but\nprincipally because she thought she might be more useful for\nFrance\u2019s war effort if she were in another country. Thus she\nwent to New York via Morocco. In New York, as in Marseilles, she\nfilled notebook after notebook with philosophical, theological, and\nmathematical considerations. New York, however, felt removed from the\nsufferings of her native France; the Free French movement in London\nfelt one step closer to returning to France. In 1943 Weil was given a\nsmall office at 19 Hill Street in London. From this room she would\nwrite day and night for the next four months, sleeping around three\nhours each night. Her output in this period totaled around 800 printed\npages, but she resigned from the Free French movement in late July\n(P\u00e9trement 1973 [1976: xx]).\n\nWeil died Tuesday, 24 August 1943. Three days later, the coroner\npronounced her death a suicide\u2014cardiac failure from\nself-starvation and tuberculosis. The accounts provided by her\nbiographers tell a more complex story: Weil was aware that her fellow\ncountry-men and women in the occupied territory had to live on minimal\nfood rations at this time, and she had insisted on the same for\nherself, which exacerbated her physical illness to the point of death\n(Von der Ruhr 2006: 18). On 30 August she was buried at\nAshford\u2019s New Cemetery between the Jewish and the Catholic\nsections. Her grave was originally anonymous. For fifteen years\nAshford residents thought it was a pauper\u2019s.\n2. Social-Political Philosophy\n\nAlways writing from the left, Weil continually revised her\nsocial-political philosophy in light of the rapidly changing material\nconditions in which she lived. However, she was consistent in her\nacute attention to and theorizing from the situation of the oppressed\nand marginalized in society.\n\nHer early essays on politics, a number of which were posthumously\ncollected by Albert Camus in Oppression et libert\u00e9\n(OL), include \u201cCapital and the Worker\u201d (1932),\n\u201cProspects: Are We Heading for the Proletarian\nRevolution?\u201d (1933), \u201cReflections concerning Technology,\nNational Socialism, the U.S.S.R., and certain other matters\u201d\n(1933) and, most importantly, \u201cReflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression\u201d (1934 in OL 36\u2013117). In\nher early writings, Weil attempted to provide an analysis of the real\ncauses of oppression so as to inform militants in revolutionary\naction. Her concern was that, without this analysis, a socially\nenticing movement would lead only to superficial changes in the\nappearance of the means of production, not to new and freer forms of\nstructural organization.\n\nThe division of labor or the existence of material privilege alone is\nnot a sufficient condition for Weil\u2019s concept of\n\u201coppression\u201d. That is, she recognized that there are some\nforms of social relations involving deference, hierarchy, and order\nthat are not necessarily oppressive. However, the intervention of the\nstruggle for power\u2014which she, following Hobbes, sees as an\ninexorable feature of human society\u2014generates oppression.\n\n\n[P]ower [puissance] contains a sort of fatality which weighs\nas pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey; nay more, it\nis in so far as it enslaves the former that, through their agency, it\npresses down upon the latter (\u201cReflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression\u201d, OL 62).\n\n\nOppression, then, is a specific social organization that, as a\nconsequence of the essentially unstable struggle for power, and\nprincipally the structure of labor, limits the individual from\nexperiencing the world to the full extent of her or his full\ncapability, a capability Weil describes as \u201cmethodical\nthinking\u201d (p\u00e9nsee m\u00e9thodique). By\ndivorcing the understanding from the application of a method,\noppression, exercised through force, denies human beings direct\ncontact with reality. Also informing her sense of oppression is her\nnotion of \u201cprivilege\u201d, which includes not only money or\narms, but also a corpus of knowledge closed to the working masses\nthat, thereby, engenders a culture of specialists. Privilege thus\nexacerbates oppression in modern societies, which are held together\nnot by shared goals, meaningful relations, or organically developing\ncommunities, but through a \u201creligion of power\u201d (OL 69). In\nthis way, both power and prestige contribute to a modern reversal of\nmeans and ends. That is, elements like money, technology, and\nwar\u2014all properly speaking \u201cmeans\u201d\u2014are, through\nthe workings of power, treated as \u201cends\u201d worthy of\nfurtherance, enhancement, and multiplication without limit.\n\nIn her early social-political thought Weil testified to what she\ncalled \u201ca new species of oppression\u201d\n(\u201cProspects\u201d, OL 9), namely, the bureaucracy of modern\nindustry. Both her anarchism and Marxian method of analysis influenced\nhow she problematized revolutionary struggle: the problem lies in\nforming a social organization that does not engender bureaucracy, an\nanonymous and institutionalized manifestation of force. The\noppressiveness of modern bureaucracy, to which she responded through\nanalysis and critique, includes clich\u00e9d, official and\nobscurantist language\u2014the \u201ccaste privileges\u201d of\nintellectuals (\u201cTechnology, National Socialism, the\nU.S.S.R\u201d, OL 34)\u2014 and a division of labor such that, in\nthe case of most workers, labor does not involve, but in fact\nprecludes, engaged thinking. Out of balance in this way, modern humans\nlive as cogs in a machine: less like thinking individuals, and more\nlike instruments crushed by \u201ccollectivities\u201d.\nCollectivity\u2014a concept that centrally comprises industry,\nbureaucracy, and the state (the \u201cbureaucratic organization\npar excellence\u201d [OL 109]), but that also includes\npolitical parties, churches, and unions\u2014by definition quashes\nindividual subjectivity.\n\nDespite her critiques of oppression, prestige, and collectivity, in a\npolemical argument Weil is also critical of \u201crevolution\u201d,\nwhich for her refers to an inversion of forces, the victory of the\nweak over the powerful. This, she says, is \u201cthe equivalent of a\nbalance whose lighter scale were to go down\u201d (OL 74).\n\u201cRevolution\u201d in its colloquial or deterministic sense,\nthen, has itself become an \u201copiate\u201d, a word for which the\nlaboring masses die, but which lies empty. For Weil, real revolution\nis precisely the re-organization of labor such that it subordinates\nthe laborers neither to management (as in bureaucracy) nor to\noppressive conditions (as in factory work). As she sees it, if\nrevolution is to have meaning, it is only as a regulative, and not a\npositive, ideal (OL 53). In Weil\u2019s adaptation of this Kantian\nnotion, such a regulative ideal involves an attention to reality,\ne.g., to the present political and working conditions, to human\nconditions such as the struggle for power. Only in this way can it\nprovide a standard of analysis for action: the ideal allows for a\ndialectical relation between a revolutionary alternative and present\npraxis, which is always grounded in material conditions. Freedom,\nthen, is a unity of thought and action. It is, moreover\u2014and not\nunlike in Hegel\u2019s conceptualization\u2014a condition of\nbalanced relations to and interdependence with others (who check our\nsovereignty) and the world (which is limited and limiting). A freeing\nmode of production, as opposed to an alienating and oppressing one,\nwould involve a meaningful relation to thinking and to others\nthroughout the course of labor. When workers understand both the\nmechanical procedures and the efforts of other members of the\ncollectivity, the collectivity itself becomes subject to individuals,\ni.e., means and ends are rightfully in a relation of equilibrium.\n\nThe ontology behind Weil\u2019s notion of free labor draws on the\nKantian emphasis on the individual as an end\u2014especially, for\nWeil, in her or his capacity for thinking (with Plato, for whom\nknowing and doing are united). In addition, the teleology of labor in\nWeil\u2019s philosophy corresponds with the thought of Hegel and\nMarx, and is in opposition to Locke: in the individual\u2019s mixing\nwith the material world, her interest lies in how this promotes\nliberty, rather than property. The uprooting Weil experienced in\nfactory work introduced a shift in her conception of freedom: as she\nbegan to see the human condition as not just one of inexorable\nstruggle, but of slavery, her notion of freedom shifted from a\nnegative freedom from constraints to a positive freedom to obey. She\nreferred to the latter, a particular kind of relational freedom, as\n\u201cconsent\u201d. She concluded her \u201cinventory of modern\ncivilization\u201d (OL 116) with a call to introduce play into the\nbureaucratic machine and a call to think as individuals, denying the\n\u201csocial idol\u201d by \u201crefusing to subordinate\none\u2019s own destiny to the course of history\u201d and by taking\nup \u201ccritical analysis\u201d (OL 117). In sum, by 1934 Weil\npictured an ideal society, which she conceptualized as a regulative\nimpossibility in which manual labor, understood and performed by\nthinking individuals, was a \u201cpivot\u201d toward liberty.\n\nWeil\u2019s \u201cFactory Journal\u201d from 1934\u20131935\nsuggests a broader shift in her social-political philosophy. During\nthis period, her political pessimism deepened. In light of the\nhumiliating work she conducted in the factories, her post-factory\nwritings feature a terminological intensification: from\n\u201chumiliation\u201d and \u201coppression\u201d to\n\u201caffliction\u201d (malheur), a concept informed by her\nfactory experience of embodied pain combined with psychological agony\nand social degradation\u2014and to which she would later add\nspiritual distress.\n\nIn 1936 Weil advanced her political commitments in ways that\nforeshadowed her later social-political thought. She continued to\neschew revolution and instead to work toward reform, namely, greater\nequality in the factory through a shift from a structure of\nsubordination to one of collaboration. In addition, in response to the\noutbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she argued against fascism while\nfavoring\u2014against the Communist position\u2014French\nnon-intervention. She was opposed to authoritarian logic, and she saw\ngoing to war as a kind of surrender to the logic of power and prestige\ninherent in fascism.\n\n\nOne must choose between prestige and peace. And whether one claims to\nbelieve in the fatherland, democracy, or revolution, the policy of\nprestige means war. (1936 \u201cDo We Have to Grease Our Combat\nBoots\u201d, FW 258)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s development of the concepts of power and prestige\ncontinued in her article \u201cLet Us Not Start Another Trojan\nWar\u201d (1936, subtitled, and translated into English as,\n\u201cThe Power of Words\u201d in SWA 238\u2013258). Her thesis is\nthat a war\u2019s destruction is inversely proportional to the\nofficial pretexts given for fighting it. Wars are absurd, she argued\n(against Clausewitz), because \u201cthey are conflicts with no\ndefinable objective\u201d (SWA 239). Like the phantom of Helen\nthat inspired ten years of fighting, ideologies (e.g., capitalism,\nsocialism, fascism), as well as capitalized words such as\n\u201cNation\u201d and \u201cState\u201d, have taken on the role\nof the phantom in the modern world. Power relies on\nprestige\u2014itself illusory and without limit because no nation\nthinks it has enough or is sure of maintaining its imagined glory, and\ntherefore ever increases its means to wage war\u2014so as to appear\nabsolute and invincible. In response to these forces, Weil prescribed\ndistinguishing between the imaginary and the real and, relatedly,\ndefining words properly and precisely. Taken together, these\nprescriptions amount to a critique of ideology with its bloated\npolitical rhetoric.\n\n\n[W]hen a word is properly defined it loses its capital letter and can\nno longer serve either as a banner or as a hostile slogan; it becomes\nsimply a sign, helping us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete\nobjective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the\nintrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by\nprecise analysis\u2014to do this, strange though it may appear, might\nbe a way of saving human lives. (SWA 242)\n\n\nFurther, Weil desired a kind of equilibrium between forces instead of\nan endless pursuit of an illusion of absolute stability and security.\nFollowing Heraclitus, she saw struggle as a condition of life. What is\nrequired of the thinking individual, in turn, is to distinguish\nbetween worthwhile conflict, such as class struggle, and illusions of\nprestige, which often serve as the foundation of war. In her middle\nperiod, then, Weil maintained the contrariety between reality, limit,\nand equilibrium on the one hand and imagination, limitlessness, and\ncollectivity on the other. In her 1937 \u201cNote on Social\nDemocracy\u201d, she defined politics as follows:\n\n\nThe material of the political art is the double perspective, ever\nshifting between the real conditions of social equilibrium and the\nmovements of collective imagination. Collective imagination, whether\nof mass meetings or of meetings in evening dress, is never correctly\nrelated to the really decisive factors of a given social situation; it\nis always beside the point, or ahead of it, or behind it. (SE 152)\n\n\nIn her late period Weil provided an explication of the all-pervasive\nand indiscriminate concept of \u201cforce\u201d in the essay\n\u201cThe Iliad or the Poem of Force\u201d (1940 in SWA\n182\u2013215). It is important to note Weil\u2019s locus of\nenunciation for this concept, temporally after the fall of France and\nspatially from a position of exile, including antisemitic\nmarginalization, which is why the essay appeared in the December 1940\nand January 1941 Cahiers du Sud under the anagrammatic\npseudonym Emile Novis, taken up by Weil to avoid antisemitic\nconfrontation and censorship. This essay was not only the most widely\nread of Weil\u2019s pieces during her lifetime, but it was also her\nfirst essay to appear in English, translated by Mary McCarthy and\npublished in Dwight Macdonald\u2019s magazine Politics in\n1945 (November, pp. 321\u2013330).\n\nIn her essay on the Iliad\u2014a text Roberto Esposito calls\n\u201ca phenomenology of force\u201d (Esposito 1996 [2017:\n46])\u2014Weil further develops an understanding of force initially\npresented in her earlier, unfinished essay \u201cReflections on\nBarbarism\u201d (1939): \u201cI believe that the concept of force\nmust be made central in any attempt to think clearly about human\nrelations\u201d (quoted in P\u00e9trement 1973 [1976: 361]). The\nprotagonist of the Iliad, Weil writes in an original reading,\nis not Achilles or Hector, but force itself. Like her concept of\n\u201cpower\u201d in her early writings, \u201cforce\u201d reifies\nand dehumanizes no matter if one wields or undergoes it. Further,\nforce includes not only coercion, but also prestige, which is to say\nthat it has a social element. Two important implications follow.\nFirst, on the level of the individual, each \u201cpersonality\u201d\n(la personne) is informed by social values and thereby\nfeatures the operations of force through accidental characteristics,\nsuch as the name of the family into which one is born or the embodied\nfeatures that are considered physically attractive at a certain place,\nin a certain society, at a certain time. Second, on the level of the\ncollectivity, force can destroy not only bodies, but also values and\ncultures, as is the case, Weil is at pains to point out, in French\ncolonialism. In her mid-to-late writings, then, she saw neither\nMarx\u2019s notion of class nor Hegel\u2019s self-development of\nGeist, but force itself, as the key to history. She presents\nthis concept as \u201cthe force that kills\u201d and as a specific\nkind of violence \u201cthat does not kill just yet\u201d, though\n\n\n[i]t will surely kill, it will possibly kill, or perhaps it merely\nhangs, poised and ready, over the head of the creature it can\nkill, at any moment, which is to say at every moment. (SWA\n184\u2013185)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of force, then, is also a development from Hobbes\nand Hegel: it names that which renders the individual a slave.\n\nIt was in London (1942\u20131943), during her work for the Free\nFrench, that Weil articulated her most robust late social-political\nphilosophy. Her concepts of \u201clabor\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d thickened as she moved further toward\nChristianity and\u2014against her early emphasis on the\nindividual\u2014toward the social. Weil\u2019s pi\u00e8ces\nd\u2019occasion from this time period include \u201cDraft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations\u201d (1943), written in response to\nde Gaulle\u2019s State Reform Commission in its drafting of a new\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, as well as \u201cNote\non the General Suppression of Political Parties\u201d (1943), written\nbecause the Free French was considering recognizing political parties.\nIn this piece Weil argues for the complete abolition of political\nparties. Drawing on Rousseau\u2019s concept of the general will, Weil\ncontends that political parties subdue the independent, individual\nwills of which the general will is derivative and on which democracy\ndepends. Most important from this period was her major work The\nNeed for Roots (L\u2019enracinement), which Weil called\nher second \u201cmagnum opus\u201d (SL 186), and which Albert Camus\npublished posthumously in 1949, with Gallimard, as the first of 11\nvolumes of Weil\u2019s he would promote.\n\nWeil wrote additional essays in London, the most conceptually\nimportant of which was \u201cLa Personne et le\nsacr\u00e9\u201d (1942\u20131943, translated into English as\n\u201cHuman Personality\u201d), in which she critiques\n\u201crights\u201d as reliant on force and poses as counter-terms\n\u201cobligation\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d. She distinguishes\nbetween two conceptions of justice: natural (hence social and\ncontingent) and supernatural (hence impersonal and eternal). The\nNeed for Roots (1943 NR) adds \u201cneeds of the soul\u201d as\nanother counter-balance to rights. Overall, Weil presents not a\nlaw-based or rights-based, but a compassion-based morality, involving\nobligations to another that are discernible through attention,\ncentered on and evolving toward a supernatural justice that is not of\nthe world, but that can be in it. As a departure from Kant, and\nthrough Plato, whom Weil \u201ccame to feel\u2026 was a\nmystic\u201d (\u201cSpiritual Autobiography\u201d, WFG 28), the\nbasis of her sense of (supernatural) justice was not human\nrationality, but a desire for the Good, which she believed all humans\nshare, even if at times they forget or deny this. Importantly, given\nher critique of French colonialism, and despite her claim that\nobligations to another must be indiscriminate, i.e., universal, she\ndid not want to universalize law in a Kantian fashion. Rather, her aim\nwas for cultures to continue their own traditions, for the goal of\nrootedness (l\u2019enracinement) is not to change cultural\nvalues per se, but more precisely, to change how individuals\nin those cultures read and orient themselves toward those values.\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of \u201croots\u201d is crucial to her late\npolitical thought. With connotations of both vitality and\nvulnerability, \u201croots\u201d conceptualizes human society as\ndynamic and living while attesting to the necessity of stability and\nsecurity if growth and flourishing are to occur on the level of the\nindividual. Beyond the organic metaphor on the level of the natural,\nher concept of roots serves as a kind of bridge between the reality of\nsociety and the ideal of supernatural justice. Roots do this by\nmanifesting human subjection to material and historical conditions,\nincluding the need to participate in the life of a community, to feel\na sense of connection to a place, and to maintain temporal links,\ne.g., to cultural history and to hopes for the future. In turn, a\nrooted community allows for the development of the individual with a\nview toward God or eternal values. As such, and contra her\nearly and middle maintenance of a critical distance from any\ncollectivity (or Great Beast, to use the Platonic metaphor she\nfrequently employs), in her late thought Weil sees roots as allowing\nfor a \u201cnew patriotism\u201d based on compassion. The\nestablishing of roots (l\u2019enracinement) enables multiple\nrelations to the world (e.g., on the level of the nation, the\norganically developing community, the school) that at once nourish the\nindividual and the community.\n\nIn addition to war and colonization, in The Need for Roots\nWeil points to money and to contemporary education as\nself-perpetuating forces that uproot human life. The longest section\nof the text describes modern uprootedness\n(d\u00e9racinement), occurring when the imagined modern\nnation and money are the only binding forces in society, and she\ncharacterizes this condition as a threat to the human soul. Modern\neducation is corrupted both by capitalism\u2014such that it is\nnothing except \u201ca machine for producing diplomas, in other\nwords, jobs\u201d (NR 118)\u2014and by a Roman inheritance for\ncultivating prestige with respect to the nation: \u201cIt is this\nidolatry of self which they have bequeathed to us in the form of\npatriotism\u201d (NR 137). As an alternative to modern uprootedness,\nWeil outlines a civilization based not on force, which turns a person\ninto a thing, but on free labor, which in its engagement with and\nconsent to necessary forces at play in the world, including time and\ndeath, allows for direct contact with reality. Moreover, Weil\u2019s\nwriting in The Need for Roots is refracted through her\nreligious experience. In this later period, then, she no longer\nconceptualizes labor in the mechanical terms of a \u201cpivot\u201d\nas she did in her early writings; it is now the \u201cspiritual\ncore\u201d of \u201ca well-ordered social life\u201d (NR 295). (In\nher late social-political philosophy, in fact, a spiritual revolution\nis more important than an economic one.) Contra the Greeks,\nwho devalued physical work, her conception of labor serves to mediate\nbetween the natural and the supernatural. In her late writings, labor\nis fully inflected by her experiences with Christianity. As such,\nlabor\u2019s consent to and, moreover, working through natural forces\n(e.g., gravity) is in fact consent to God, who created the natural\nworld. Labor\u2019s kenotic activity, as energy is expended daily, is\na kind of imitatio Christi.\n\nHer social-political writings in London are markedly different from\nher early writings as an anarchist informed principally by Descartes,\nMarx, and Kant. While those influences remain, her later writings must\nbe read through the lens of her Christian Platonism. She suggests that\nwe must draw our spiritual life from our social environment. That is,\nwhile spirituality is individual vis-\u00e0-vis God, this\nspirituality occurs within a social context, namely, the collectivity,\nand principally, the nation. This is a reversal from the critical\ndistance she had maintained from the collectivity, especially in her\nearly emphasis on the individual\u2019s methodical thinking.\n3. Epistemology\n\nThroughout her life, Weil argued that knowledge in and of the world\ndemanded rigorous, balanced thinking, even if that difficulty and\nmeasurement led the thinker to near-impossible tasks. For her these\ntasks of thinking included, for instance, her attempt to synthesize\nperspectives of intricate Catholic doctrine on the threshold of the\nChurch with wisdom from various traditions such as ancient Greek\nphilosophy and tragedies, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Following\nAeschylus, she believed knowledge was gained through suffering. Shaped\nby her social-political and religious thought, Weil\u2019s\nepistemology would change over time, especially in light of her\nmystical experiences.\n\nIn her dissertation, Weil attempts to think with Descartes in order to\nfind foundational knowledge. Like Descartes, she argues for the\nexistence of self, God, and world. Her cogito, however, was a\ndecisive break from his: \u201cI can, therefore I am\u201d (Je\npuis, donc je suis) (1929\u20131930 \u201cScience and\nPerception in Descartes\u201d, FW 59). The self has the power of\nfreedom, Weil argues, but something else\u2014the omnipotent,\nGod\u2014makes the self realize that it is not all-powerful.\nSelf-knowledge, then, is capability always qualified by the\nacknowledgment that one is not God. She maintained a kind of Cartesian\nepistemology during her time as a teacher, early in her academic life.\nIn Lectures on Philosophy (1978 LP), a collection of lecture\nnotes taken by one of her students during the academic year\n1933\u20131934 at a girl\u2019s lyc\u00e9e in Roanne, we\nfind that Weil is initially critical of sensations as grounds for\nknowledge, and thereby critical of empiricist epistemology (LP\n43\u201347).\n\nFrom her early writings onward she was to problematize the imagination\nas the \u201cfolle imagination\u201d, a barrier between\nmind and reality, meaning that the human knower is kept from\nthings-in-themselves. Weil\u2019s epistemology, then, informed by her\ninitial studies of Descartes, would take on inflections of Kant and\nPlato while positioning her against Aristotle. She was critical of any\nsensation that universalizes one\u2019s reading of the world, and she\nsaw the imagination as thus extending the self, because it could not\nhelp but filter phenomena through its own categories, wishes, and\ndesires, thereby reading the world on its own terms. Relatedly, Weil\nwould develop an intersubjective epistemology. Knowing the truth\nrequires not extending one\u2019s own limited perspective, but\nsuspending or abandoning it such that reality\u2014including the\nreality of the existence of others\u2014could appear on its own\nterms. This suspension involves a practice of epistemic humility and\nopenness to all ideas; intelligence for Weil demands the qualified use\nof language, acknowledgement of degrees, proportions, contingencies,\nand relations, as well as an ability to call the self into question.\nThese epistemic practices are part of a broader recognition that the\nindividual knower is limited.\n\nThe progression of Weil\u2019s epistemology can be seen first in her\nconceptualization of contradiction. By Lectures on\nPhilosophy, she affirmed a sense of contradiction beyond the\nlogical conjunction \u201ca is b\u201d and\n\u201ca is not-b\u201d. Indeed, she argues that\ncontradiction can be a generative obstacle in that it requires the\nmind to expand its thinking in order to transcend the obstacle.\nDrawing on the mathematics of Eudoxus, she elaborates on this notion\nto claim that incommensurables can be reconciled when set on a kind of\n\u201chigher plane\u201d. This is not, however, a type of Hegelian\nsynthesis that can be intellectually apprehended. Instead, the\ncontemplation of contradictions can lead the knower to a higher\ncontemplation of truth-as-mystery. Thus, in her late epistemology Weil\npresents this concept of \u201cmystery\u201d as a certain kind of\ncontradiction in which incommensurables appear linked in an\nincomprehensible unity.\n\nMystery, as a conceptualization of contradiction, carries theological,\nor at least supernatural, implications. For instance, if contradiction\nis understood through formal logic, then the existence of affliction\nwould seemingly prove the nonexistence of an omnipotent, wholly\nbenevolent God; however, contradiction, understood as mystery, can\nitself serve as a mediation, allowing for the coexistence of\naffliction and God, seen most prominently on the Cross. Indeed, Christ\nis the religious solution to Weil\u2019s principal contradiction,\nthat between the necessary and the good. Moreover, through incarnation\nthat opens onto universality, Christ also manifests and solves the\ncontradiction of the individual and the collectivity. Thus, in a\nmodification of the Pythagorean idea of harmony, she claims that\nChrist allows for \u201cthe just balance of contraries\u201d\n(\u201cSpiritual Autobiography\u201d, WFG 33). More broadly, in her\n1941 \u201cThe Pythagorean Doctrine\u201d, she argues that\nmathematics are a bridge between the natural and eternal (or between\nhumans and God). That is, the Pythagoreans held an intellectual\nsolution to apparent natural contradictions. Inspired by Pythagoras,\nshe claimed that the very study of mathematics can be a means of\npurification in light of the principles of proportion and the\nnecessary balancing of contraries\u2014especially in geometry. She\nsaw in the Pythagorean legacy and spirit a link between their\nmathematical insights and their distinctly religious project to\npenetrate the mysteries of the cosmos.\n\nAs opposed to the suppression or dissolution of contradictions, as in\nsystematic philosophy, in Weil\u2019s value-centered philosophy\ncontradictions are to be presented honestly and tested on different\nlevels; for her, they are \u201cthe criterion of the real\u201d and\ncorrespond with the orientation of detachment (GG 98). For example,\nChrist\u2019s imperative to \u201clove your enemies\u201d contains\na contradiction in value: love those who are detestable and who\nthreaten the vulnerability of loving. For Weil, submitting to this\nunion of contraries loosens one\u2019s attachments to particular,\nego-driven perspectives and enables a \u201cwell-developed\nintellectual pluralism\u201d (Springsted 2010: 97). She writes,\n\u201cAn attachment to a particular thing can only be destroyed by an\nattachment which is incompatible with it\u201d (GG 101). With these\nphilosophical moves in mind, Robert Chenavier argues that she has not\na philosophy of perception, a phenomenology, but rather, borrowing\nGaston Bachelard\u2019s phrase, a \u201cdynamology of\ncontradiction\u201d (Chenavier 2009 [2012: 25]).\n\nOverall, Weil\u2019s presentation of contradiction is more\nPythagorean or Platonic than it is Marxian: it takes up contradiction\nnot through resolution on the level of things, but through dialectics\non the level of thought, where mystery is the beginning and end-point\nof thought (Springsted 2010: 97). In her unfinished essay \u201cIs\nThere a Marxist Doctrine?\u201d, from her time in London, Weil\nwrites,\n\n\nContradiction in matter is imaged by the clash of forces coming from\ndifferent directions. Marx purely and simply attributed to social\nmatter this movement towards the good through contradictions, which\nPlato described as being that of the thinking creature drawn upwards\nby the supernatural operation of grace. (OL 180)\n\n\nShe follows the Greek usage of \u201cdialectics\u201d to consider\n\u201cthe virtue of contradiction as support for the soul drawn\nupwards by grace\u201d (or the good); Marx errs, she thought, in\ncoupling such a movement with \u201cmaterialism\u201d (OL 181).\n\nA second central epistemological concept for Weil is\n\u201creading\u201d (lecture). Reading is a kind\nof interpretation of what is presented to knowers by both their\nphysical sensations and their social conditions; therefore,\nreading\u2014as the reception and attribution of certain meanings in\nthe world\u2014is always mediated. In turn, readings are mediated\nthrough other readings, since our perception of meaning is undoubtedly\ninvolved in and affected by an intersubjective web of interpretations.\nWeil explains this through the metaphor, borrowed from Descartes, of a\nblind man\u2019s stick. We can read a situation through attention to\nanother in order to expand our awareness and sensitivity, just as the\nblind man enlarges his sensibility through the use of his stick. But\nour readings of the world can also become more narrow and simplistic,\nas for instance, when a context of violence and force tempts us to see\neveryone we encounter as a potential threat. Moreover, readings are\nnot free from power dynamics and can become projects of imposition and\nintervention; here her epistemology connects to her social-political\nphilosophy, specifically to her concept of force.\n\n\nWe read, but also we are read by, others. Interferences in these\nreadings. Forcing someone to read himself as we read him (slavery).\nForcing others to read us as we read ourselves (conquest). (NB 43)\n\n\nShe connects reading to war and imagination: \u201cWar is a way of\nimposing another reading of sensations, a pressure upon the\nimagination of others\u201d (NB 24). In her 1941 \u201cEssay on the\nConcept of Reading\u201d (LPW 21\u201327) Weil elaborates,\n\u201cWar, politics, eloquence, art, teaching, all action on others\nessentially consists in changing what they read\u201d (LPW 26). In\nthe same essay she develops \u201creading\u201d in relation to the\naforementioned epistemological concepts of appearance, the empirical\nworld, and contradiction:\n\n\n[A]t each instant of our life we are gripped from the outside, as it\nwere, by meanings that we ourselves read in appearances. That is why\nwe can argue endlessly about the reality of the external world, since\nwhat we call the world are the meanings that we read; they are not\nreal. But they seize us as if they were external; that is real. Why\nshould we try to resolve this contradiction when the more important\ntask of thought in this world is to define and contemplate insoluble\ncontradictions, which, as Plato said, draw us upwards? (LPW 22)\n\n\nIt is important to note that for Weil, we are not simply passive in\nour readings. That is, we can learn to change our readings of the\nworld or of others. An elevated transformation in reading, however,\ndemands an apprenticeship in loving God through the things of this\nworld\u2014a kind of attentiveness that will also entail certain\nbodily involvements, labors, postures, and experiences. Particular\nreadings result from particular ways of living. Ideally for her, we\nwould read the natural as illuminated by the supernatural. This\nconceptualization of reading involves recognition on hierarchical\nlevels, as she explains in her notebooks:\n\n\nTo read necessity behind sensation, to read order behind necessity, to\nread God behind order. We must love all facts, not for their\nconsequences, but because in each fact God is there present. But that\nis tautological. To love all facts is nothing else than to read God in\nthem. (NB 267)\n\n\nThus the world is known as a kind of text featuring several\nsignifications on several stages, levels, or domains.\n\nWeil\u2019s epistemology grounds her critique of modern science. In\nThe Need for Roots she advocates for a science conducted\n\u201caccording to methods of mathematical precision, and at the same\ntime maintained in close relationship with religious faith\u201d (NR\n288). Through contemplation of the natural world via this kind of\nscience, the world could be read on multiple levels. The knower,\nreading thus, would understand that the order of the world is the same\nas a unity, but different on its myriad levels:\n\n\nwith respect to God [it] is eternal Wisdom; with respect to the\nuniverse, perfect obedience; with respect to our love, beauty; with\nrespect to our intelligence, balance of necessary relations; with\nrespect to our flesh, brute force. (NR 288\u2013289)\n\n\nAs in her social-political thought, in her epistemology Weil is a kind\nof anti-modern. She sees modern science and epistemology as a project\nof self-expansion that forgets limit and thinks the world should be\nsubject to human power and autonomy. Labor (especially physical labor,\nsuch as farming), then, also assumes an epistemological role for her.\nBy heteronomously subjecting the individual to necessity on a daily\nbasis, it at once contradicts self-aggrandizement and allows for a\nmore balanced reading: the intelligence qualifies itself as it reads\nnecessary relations simultaneously on multiple levels. This reading on\ndifferent levels, and inflected through faith, amounts to a kind of\nnon-reading, in that it is detached, impersonal and impartial. Through\nthese predicates \u201creading\u201d is connected to her social\nthought, aesthetics, and religious philosophy. That is, in her later\nthought Weil\u2019s epistemology relies on a time-out-of-mind\nmetaphysics for justification. Analogous to aesthetic taste, spiritual\ndiscernment\u2014God-given and graceful\u2014allows the abdicated\nself to read from a universal perspective at its most developed stage.\nThus, she argued, one can love equally and indiscriminately, just as\nthe sun shines or the rain falls without preference.\n4. Ethics\n\nWeil\u2019s central ethical concept is \u201cattention\u201d\n(l\u2019attention), which, though thematically and\npractically present in her early writings, reached its robust\ntheoretical expression while she was in Marseilles in 1942. Attention\nis a particular kind of ethical \u201cturn\u201d in her\nconceptualization. Fundamentally, it is less a moral position or\nspecific practice and more an orientation that nevertheless requires\nan arduous apprenticeship leading to a capacity of discernment on\nmultiple levels. Attention includes discerning what someone is going\nthrough in her or his suffering, the particular protest made by\nsomeone harmed, the social conditions that engender a climate for\nsuffering, and the fact that one is, by chance (hazard) at a\ndifferent moment, equally a subject of affliction.\n\nAttention is directed not by will but by a particular kind of desire\nwithout an object. It is not a \u201cmuscular effort\u201d but a\n\u201cnegative effort\u201d (WFG 61), involving release of egoistic\nprojects and desires and a growing receptivity of the mind. For Weil,\nas a Christian Platonist, the desire motivating attention is oriented\ntoward the mysterious good that \u201cdraws God down\u201d (WFG 61).\nIn her essay \u201cReflections on the Right use of School Studies\nwith a View to the Love of God\u201d (1942 in WFG 57\u201365), Weil\ntakes prayer, defined as \u201cthe orientation of all the attention\nof which the soul is capable toward God\u201d, as her point of\ndeparture (WFG 57). She then describes a kind of vigilance in her\ndefinition of attention:\n\n\nAttention consists of suspending our thought, leaving it detached\n[disponible], empty [vide], and ready to be\npenetrated by the object; it means holding in our minds, within the\nreach of this thought, but on the lower level and not in contact with\nit, the diverse knowledge we have acquired which we are forced to make\nuse of. \u2026 Above all our thought should be empty\n[vide], waiting [en attente], not seeking anything\n[ne rien chercher], but ready to receive in its naked truth\nthe object that is to penetrate it. (WFG 62)\n\n\nThe French makes more clear the connection between attention\n(l\u2019attention) and waiting (attente). For Weil\nthe problem with searching, instead of waiting en hupomene\n(\u03b4\u1f30 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2),\nis precisely that one is eager to fill the void characterizing\nattente. As a result, one settles too quickly on some-thing:\na counterfeit, falsity, idol. Because in searching or willing the\nimagination fills the void (le vide), it is crucial that\nattention be characterized by suspension and detachment. Indeed, the\nvoid by definition is empty (vide)\u2014of idols, futural\nself-projections, consolations that compensate un-thinking, and\nattachments of collective and personal prestige. As such, its\nacceptance marks individual fragility and destructibility, that is,\nmortality. But this acceptance of death is the condition for the\npossibility of the reception of grace. (As explained below in regard\nto her religious philosophy, Weil\u2019s concept for the disposition\ncharacterized by these features of attention, with obvious theological\nresonances, is \u201cdecreation\u201d.)\n\nIn attention one renounces one\u2019s ego in order to receive the\nworld without the interference of one\u2019s limited and consumptive\nperspective. This posture of self-emptying, a stripping away of the\n\u201cI\u201d (d\u00e9pouillement)\u2014ultimately for\nWeil an imitatio Christi in its kenosis\u2014allows for an\nimpersonal but intersubjective ethics. Indeed, if the primary\norientation of attention is toward a mysterious and unknown God (often\nexperienced as a desire for the Good), the secondary disposition is\ntoward another person or persons, especially toward those going\nthrough affliction.\n\n\nThe soul empties itself [se vide] of all its own contents in\norder to receive into itself the being it is looking at, just as he\nis, in all his truth. Only he who is capable of attention can do this.\n(WFG 65)\n\n\nWeil recognizes and problematizes the fact that the autonomous self\nnaturally imposes itself in its projects, as opposed to disposing\nitself to the other; for this reason, attention is rare but is\nrequired of any ethical disposition. The exemplary story of attention\nfor Weil is the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which, on her\nreading, compassion is exchanged when one individual \u201cturns his\nattention toward\u201d another individual, anonymous and afflicted\n(WFG 90).\n\n\nThe actions that follow are just the automatic effect of this moment\nof attention. The attention is creative. But at the moment when it is\nengaged it is a renunciation. This is true, at least, if it is pure.\nThe man accepts to be diminished by concentrating on an expenditure of\nenergy, which will not extend his own power but will only give\nexistence to a being other than himself, who will exist independently\nof him. (1942 \u201cForms of the Implicit Love of God\u201d in WFG\n83\u2013142, 90)\n\n\nAs such, attention not only gives human recognition and therefore\nmeaningful existence to another, but it also allows the individual\nengaged in renunciation to take up a moral stance in response to her\nor his desire for good.\n\nIt is important to distinguish Weil\u2019s ethics of attention from\ncanonical conceptualizations of ethics. Attention is not motivated by\na duty (although Weil thinks we are obligated to respond to\nothers\u2019 needs, whether of soul or body [see \u201cDraft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations\u201d in SWA, esp. 224\u2013225]) or\nassessed by its consequences. In addition, through its sense of\nphronesis (practical wisdom), which Weil assumed from\nAristotle through Marx, attention is arguably closer to virtue ethics\nthan it is to deontology or consequentialism. However, it is separated\nfrom the tradition of virtue ethics in important ways: it often\nemerges more spontaneously than virtue, which, for Aristotle, is\ncultivated through habituation as it develops into a hexis;\nWeil\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cnegative effort\u201d suggests an\nactive-passive orientation that militates against Aristotle\u2019s\nemphasis on activity (it is more a \u201cturning\u201d than a\n\u201cdoing\u201d, more orientation than achievement); it is\nexcessive in its generosity, as opposed to being a mean,\ne.g., liberality; its supernatural inspiration contrasts with\nAristotle\u2019s naturalism; it does not imply a teleology of\nrealizing one\u2019s own virtuous projects\u2014in fact, it is a\nsuspension of one\u2019s own projects; finally, for Weil, Aristotle\nlacks a sense of the impersonal good toward which attention is\noriented (and in this respect she is, again, inspired by Plato).\n\nWeil treats the connections among attention, void, and love, relying\non her supernatural (Christian Platonic) metaphysics, in \u201cForms\nof the Implicit Love of God\u201d.\n\n\nTo empty ourselves [Se vider] of our false divinity, to deny\nourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to\ndiscern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the\ntrue center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of\nmechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of\neach soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is\nturned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor. (WFG\n100)\n\n\nAttention can be seen as love, for just as attention consents to the\nexistence of another, love requires the recognition of a reality\noutside of the self, and thus de-centers the self and its\nparticularity. Contra the colloquial sense of love, it is\nbecause we do not love personally, but \u201cit is God in us who\nloves them [les malheureux]\u201d (WFG 93\u201394), that\nour love for others is \u201cquite impersonal\u201d and thereby\nuniversal (WFG 130). Weil allows, however, \u201cone legitimate\nexception to the duty of loving universally\u201d, namely, friendship\n(\u201cLast Thoughts\u201d, WFG 51). Friendship is \u201ca personal\nand human love which is pure and which enshrines an intimation and a\nreflection of divine love\u201d (WFG 131), a \u201csupernatural\nharmony, a union of opposites\u201d (WFG 126). The opposites that\nform the miraculous harmony are necessity/subordination (i.e., drawing\nfrom Thucydides\u2019 Melian dialogue, she sees it as an\nimpossibility for one to want to preserve autonomy in both oneself and\nanother; in the world the stronger exerts force through will) and\nliberty/equality (which is maintained through the desire of each\nfriend to preserve the consent of oneself and of the other, a consent\nto be \u201ctwo and not one\u201d [WFG 135]). In other words, in\nfriendship a particular, self-founded reading of the other is not\nforced. Distance is maintained, and in this way Weil\u2019s concept\nof friendship advances her previous critiques of the ethos of\ncapitalism, bureaucracy, and colonialism\u2014i.e., free consent of\nall parties is the essential ingredient of all human relations that\nare not degraded or abusive. Hence friendship is a model for ethics\nmore generally\u2014even, contra her claim, universally.\n\n\nFriendship has something universal about it. It consists of loving a\nhuman being as we should like to be able to love each soul in\nparticular of all those who go to make up the human race. (WFG\n135)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s ethics of attention informs her later social-political\nphilosophy and epistemology. In relation to her social-political\nthought, attention suspends the centrality of the self to allow for\nsupernatural justice, which involves simultaneously turning attention\nto God and to affliction. Justice and the love of the neighbor are not\ndistinct, for her.\n\n\nOnly the absolute identification of justice and love makes the\ncoexistence possible of compassion and gratitude on the one hand, and\non the other, of respect for the dignity of affliction\n[malheur] in the afflicted\u2014a respect felt by the\nsufferer himself [les malheureux par lui-m\u00eame] and the\nothers. (WFG 85)\n\n\nAdditionally, attention, in its consent to the autonomy of the other,\nis an antidote to force. Important to Weil\u2019s epistemology,\nattention militates against readings that are based on imagination,\nunexamined perceptions, or functions of the collectivity (e.g.,\nprestige). Attention here manifests as independent, detached thought.\nIn its religious valence involving obedience and consent, attention\nalso bears on Weil\u2019s epistemology in an additional way: it\nsuggests that knowing the reality of the world is less an individual\nachievement or attainment of mastery and more a gift of grace. That\nis, attention is openness to what cannot be predicted and to what\noften takes us by surprise. In this way, attention resists the natural\ntendency of humans to seek control and dominance over others. At stake\nin this ethical mode, then, is the prevention of injustices that\nresult from projects of self-expansion, including the French\ncolonialism Weil criticized in her time.\n5. Metaphysical and Religious Philosophy\n\nAlthough the metaphysics of Weil\u2019s later thought was both\nChristian and Platonic, and therefore graceful and supernatural, her\nturn to God occurred not despite but, rather, because of her attention\nto reality and contact with the world. It is not the case, then, that\nher spiritual turn and \u201ctheological commitment\u201d\n(Springsted 2015: 1\u20132) severed her contact with her early\nmaterialism, solidarities, or Marxian considerations; rather, her\nspiritual turn occurred within this context, which would ground the\nreligious philosophy she would subsequently articulate.\n\nIn her late thought Weil presents an original creation theology. God,\nas purely good, infinite, and eternal, withdrew (or reduced Godself)\nso that something else (something less than fully good, finite, and\nspatio-temporally determinate) could exist, namely, the universe.\nImplicit in this outside-of-God universe is a contingency of forces.\nShe calls this principle of contingency, the \u201cweb of\ndeterminations\u201d (McCullough 2014: 124) contrary to God,\n\u201cnecessity\u201d. Necessity is \u201cthe screen\u201d\n(l\u2019\u00e9cran) placed between God and creatures. Here\nher creation metaphysics echoes Plato\u2019s distinction between the\nnecessary and the good in the Timaeus. Her Christian\ninflection translates this to the \u201csupreme contradiction\u201d\nbetween creature and creator; \u201cit is Christ who represents the\nunity of these contradictories\u201d (NB 386).\n\nWeil is clear that God and the world is less than God alone, yet that\nonly heightens the meaning of God\u2019s abdication. That is, out of\nlove (for what would be the world and the creatures therein), God\ndecided to be lesser. Because existence\u2014God\u2019s very denial\nof Godself\u2014is itself a mark of God\u2019s love, providence is\ntherefore not found in particular interventions of God, but understood\nby recognizing the universe in all its contingency as the sum of\nGod\u2019s intentions. In this theology rests an implication for\ncreatures. If humans are to imitate God, then they must also renounce\ntheir autonomy (including imagined \u201ccenteredness\u201d in the\nuniverse) and power out of love for God and therefore the world; she\ncalls this \u201cdecreation\u201d\n(d\u00e9cr\u00e9ation), which she describes paradoxically\nby \u201cpassive activity\u201d (WFG 126) and, drawing on her\nreadings of the Bhagavad Gita, \u201cnon-active\naction\u201d (NB 124).\n\nWeil articulates her religious philosophy through a series of\ndistinctions\u2014of oppositions or contradictions. It is important\nto read the distinctions she makes not as positing dualisms, but as\nsuggesting contraries that are, unsynthesized, themselves mediations\nthrough which the soul is drawn upward. Her concept of\n\u201cintermediaries\u201d\u2014or metaxu\n(\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd), the Greek term she employs in\nher notebooks\u2014becomes explicit beginning in 1939. Through\nmetaxu God is indirectly present in the world\u2014for\nexample, in beauty, cultural traditions, law, and labor\u2014all of\nwhich place us into contact with reality. In terms of her\nperiodization, her concept of mediation moved from relations of mind\nand matter on the level of the natural (found in the early Weil) to a\nmediation relating the natural intelligence to attention and love on\nthe level of the supernatural (at work in the late Weil), thus\nencompassing her early view through a universal perspective.\n\nGiven that reality is itself metaxu, Weil\u2019s late\nconcept of mediation is more universal than the aforementioned\nspecific examples suggest. For her the real (le r\u00e9el)\nitself is an obstacle that represents contradiction, an obstacle felt,\nsay, in a difficult idea, in the presence of another, or in physical\nlabor; thus thought comes into contact with necessity and must\ntransform contradiction into correlation or mysterious and crucifying\nrelation, resulting in spiritual edification. Her explanation of this\nmediation is based on her idiosyncratic cosmology, especially its\nparadoxical claim that what is often painful reality, as distance from\nGod, is also, as intermediate, connection to God. She illustrates this\nclaim with the following metaphor:\n\n\nTwo prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by\nknocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but\nit is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and\nGod. Every separation is a link. (GG 145)\n\n\nWhen developing her concept of the real, Weil is especially interested\nin distinguishing it from the imaginary. The\nimagination\u2014problematized on epistemological grounds in her\nearly thought\u2014is criticized once again in her religious\nphilosophy for its insidious tendency to pose false consolations that\nat once invite idolatry or self-satisfaction, both of which obviate\nreal contemplation. This is why decreation, in which the individual\nwithdraws her or his \u201cI\u201d and personal perspective so as to\nallow the real and others to give themselves, is crucial not only\nspiritually, but also epistemologically and ethically. It is,\nadditionally and more radically, why Weil suggests that atheism can be\na kind of purification insofar as it negates religious consolation\nthat fills the void. For those for whom religion amounts to an\nimagined \u201cGod who smiles on [them]\u201d (GG 9), atheism\nrepresents a necessary detachment. Crucially, for her, love is pure\nnot in the name of a personal God or its particular image, but only\nwhen it is anonymous and universal.\n\nThe real leads us back to the aforementioned concept of\n\u201cnecessity\u201d, for reality\u2014essentially determinate,\nlimited, contingent, and conditional\u2014is itself a \u201cnetwork\nof necessity\u201d (Vet\u00f6 1971 [1994: 90]), such that necessity\nis a reflection of reality. Moreover, like \u201cpower\u201d in her\nearly period and \u201cforce\u201d in her middle period,\nWeil\u2019s concept of necessity includes not only the physical\nforces of the created world, but also the social forces of human life.\nThrough necessity a sense of slavery remains in her thought, for\nhumans are ineluctably subject to necessity. In this way, enslavement\nto forces outside our control is essentially woven into the human\ncondition.\n\nTime, contrary to God as eternal, along with space and matter, is\nfirst of all the most basic form of necessity. In its constant\nreminder of distance from God, and in the experiences of enduring and\nwaiting, time is also painful. Weil\u2019s Christian Platonism comes\nto light in the two most poignant metaphors she uses to refer to time,\nnamely, the (Platonic) Cave and the (Christian) Cross. In both cases,\ntime is the weight or the pull of necessity, through which the soul,\nin any effort of the self, feels vulnerable, contingent, and\nunavoidably subject to necessity\u2019s mediation here below\n(ici-bas). Time, then, is both the Cave where the self\npursues its illusory goals of expansion into the future and the Cross\nwhere necessity, a sign of God\u2019s love, pins the self, suffering\nand mortal, to the world.\n\nImportantly, by 1942 in New York, Weil\u2019s concept of time aligns\nwith Plato\u2019s against what she sees as Christian emphasis on\nprogress:\n\n\nChristianity was responsible for bringing this notion of progress,\npreviously unknown, into the world; and this notion, become the bane\nof the modern world, has de-Christianized it. We must abandon the\nnotion. We must get rid of our superstition of chronology in order to\nfind Eternity. (LPr 29)\n\n\nFor Weil progress does not carry normative implications of\nimprovement, for the Good is eternal and non-existent (in that it is\nneither spatial nor temporal); time must be consented to and suffered,\nnot fled. As for Christ on the cross, for creatures there is\nredemption not from but through suffering. She thus presents a\nsupernatural use of, not a remedy for, affliction. One form of sin,\nthen, is an attempt to escape time, for only God is time-out-of-mind.\nHowever, time, paradoxically, can also serve as metaxu. While\nmonotony is dreadful and fatiguing when it is in the form of a\npendulum\u2019s swinging or a factory\u2019s work, it is beautiful\nas a reflection of eternity, in the form of a circle (which unites\nbeing and becoming) or the sound of Gregorian chant. This beauty of\nthe world suggests, when read from the detached perspective, order\nbehind necessity, and God behind order.\n\nA second form of necessity is \u201cgravity\u201d\n(pesanteur), as distinct from supernatural\n\u201cgrace\u201d. Gravity signifies the forces of the natural world\nthat subject all created beings physically, materially,\npsychologically, and socially, and thus functions as a downward\n\u201cpull\u201d on the attention, away from God and the afflicted.\n\u201cGrace\u201d, on the other hand, is a counter-balance, the\nmotivation by and goodness of God. Grace pierces the world of\nnecessity and serves to orient, harmonize, and balance, thus providing\na kind of \u201csupernatural bread\u201d for satiating the human\nvoid. Grace, entering the empirical world, disposes one to be purified\nby leaving the void open, waiting for a good that is real but that\ncould never \u201cexist\u201d in a material sense (i.e., as subject\nto time, change, force, etc.). For Weil, natural/necessary gravity\n(force) and supernatural/spiritual grace (justice) are the two\nfundamental aspects of the created world, coming together most\nprominently in the crucifixion. The shape of the cross itself reflects\nthis intersection of the horizontal (necessity) and the vertical\n(grace).\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of necessity bears on her late conceptualization\nof the subject. She connects seeing oneself as central to the world to\nseeing oneself as exempt from necessity. From this perspective, if\nsomething were to befall oneself, then the world would cease to have\nimportance; therefore, the assertive and willful self concludes,\nnothing could befall oneself. Affliction contradicts this perspective\nand thus forcefully de-centers the self. Unlike her existentialist\ncontemporaries such as Sartre, Weil did not think human freedom\nprincipally through agency; for her, humans are free not ontologically\nas a presence-to-self but supernaturally through obedience and\nconsent. More than obedience, consent is the unity of necessity in\nmatter with freedom in creatures. A creature cannot not obey;\nthe only choice for the intelligent creature is to desire or not to\ndesire the good. To desire the good\u2014and here her stoicism\nthrough Marcus Aurelius and Spinoza emerges in her own appeal to\namor fati\u2014is a disposition that implies a consent to\nnecessity and a love of the order of the world, both of which mean\naccepting divine will. Consent, therefore, is a kind of reconciliation\nin her dialectic between the necessary and the good. Consent does not\nfollow from effort or will; rather, it expresses an ontological\nstatus, namely, decreation. In supernatural compassion one loves\nthrough evil: through distance (space) and through monotony\n(time), attending in a void and through the abdication of God. Thus,\nin regard to contradiction and mediation, just as the intelligence\nmust grapple with mystery in Weil\u2019s epistemology, so too love\nmust be vulnerable and defenseless in the face of evil in her\nmetaphysical and religious philosophy.\n6. Aesthetics\n\nWeil\u2019s metaphysic sheds light on her aesthetic philosophy, which\nis primarily Kantian and Platonic. For Weil beauty is a snare\n(\u00e0 la Homer) set by God, trapping the soul so that God\nmight enter it. Necessity presents itself not only in gravity, time,\nand affliction, but also in beauty. The contact of impersonal good\nwith the faculty of sense is beauty; contact of evil with the faculty\nof sense is ugliness and suffering\u2014both are contact with the\nreal, necessary, and providential.\n\nWeil is a realist in regard to aesthetics in that she uses the\nlanguage of being gripped or grasped by beauty, which weaves, as it\nwere, a link among mind, body, world, and universe. Woven through the\nworld, but beyond relying simply on the individual\u2019s mind or\nsenses, beauty, in this linking, lures and engenders awareness of\nsomething outside of the self. In paradoxical terms, for Weil,\nfollowing Kant, the aesthetic experience can be characterized as a\ndisinterested interestedness; against Kant, her telos of such\nexperience is Platonic, namely, to orient the soul to the\ncontemplation of the good. Moreover, for Weil beauty is purposive only\nbecause it is derivative of the good, i.e., the order of the world is\na function of God. In a revision of Kant\u2019s line that beauty is a\nfinality without finality, then, she sees beauty not only as a kind of\nfeeling or presence of finality, but also as a gesture toward,\ninclination to, or promise of supernatural, transcendental\ngoodness.\n\nAt the same time, Weil\u2019s concept of beauty is not only informed\nby her Platonism and thus marked by eternity, but it is also inspired\nby her experiences with Christ and hence features a kind of\nincarnation: the ideal can become a reality in the world. As such,\nbeauty is a testament to and manifestation of the network of\ninflexible necessity that is the natural world\u2014a network that,\nin some sense, the intelligence can grasp. It is in this way\u2014not\nas an ontological category but, rather, as a sensible\nexperience\u2014that through beauty necessity becomes the object of\nlove (i.e., in Kantian terms, beauty is regulative, not constitutive).\nThus beauty is metaxu (an intermediary) attracting the soul\nto God, and as metaxu, beauty serves as a \u201clocus of\nincommensurability\u201d (Winch 1989: 173) between the fragile\ncontingency of time (change, becoming, death) and an eternal\nreality.\n\nBecause beauty is the order of the world as necessity, strictly\nspeaking, \u201cbeauty\u201d applies principally to the world as a\nwhole, and therefore consent to beauty must be total. Thus the love of\nbeauty functions as an \u201cimplicit love of God\u201d [see WFG\n99]. More specifically, on the level of the particular there are,\nsecondarily, types of beauty that nevertheless demonstrate balance,\norder, proportion, and thus their divine provenance (e.g., those found\nin nature, art, and science).\n\nOne\u2019s recognition of the beauty/order of the world has\nimplications, once again, for the subject. Because beauty is to be\ncontemplated at a distance and not consumed through the greedy will,\nit trains the soul to be detached in the face of something\nirreducible, and in this sense it is similar to affliction. Both\nde-center the self and demand a posture of waiting (attente).\nContemplating beauty, then, means transcending the perspective of\none\u2019s own project. Because beauty, as external to self, is to be\nconsented to, it implies both that one\u2019s reality is limited and\nthat one does not want to change the object of her/his mode of\nengagement. Furthermore, beauty has an element of the impersonal\ncoming into contact with a person. Real interaction with beauty is\ndecreative. True to this idea, Weil\u2019s aesthetic commitments are\nreflected in her style: in her sharp prose she scrutinizes her own\nthought while tending to exclude her own voice and avoid personal\nreferences; thus she performs \u201cthe linguistic decreation of the\nself\u201d (Dargan 1999: 7).\n7. Reception and Influence\n\nAlthough the French post-structuralists who succeeded Weil did not\nengage extensively with her thought, her concepts carry a legacy\nthrough her contemporaries domestically and her heirs internationally\n(see Rozelle-Stone 2017). In regard to her generation of French\nthinkers, the influence of \u201cattention\u201d can be seen in the\nwritings of Maurice Blanchot; her Platonic sense of good, order, and\nclarity was taken up\u2014and rejected\u2014by both Georges Bataille\nand Emmanuel Levinas. Following Weil\u2019s generation, in his\nyounger years Jacques Derrida took interest in her mysticism and,\nspecifically, her purifying atheism, only to leave her behind almost\nentirely in his later references (Baring 2011). It is possible that\nWeil\u2019s limited influence on post-structuralists is derived not\nonly from the fact that she was not influenced by Nietzsche and\nHeidegger to the extent of the four aforementioned French thinkers,\nbut also, quite simply, because she did not survive World War II and\nhence did not write thereafter. It is also important to note that\nthroughout her life, Weil\u2019s position as a woman philosopher\ncontributed to ad hominem attacks against her person, not her\nthought; she was often perceived as \u201cpsychologically cold\u201d\nas opposed to being engaged in \u201can ethical project with\ndifferent assumptions\u201d (Nelson 2017: 9).\n\nAcross Europe and more recently, Weil\u2019s \u201cnegative\npolitics\u201d\u2014that is, turning away from institutions and\nideology and toward religious reflection\u2014, in conjunction with\nMichel Foucault\u2019s concept of biopolitics, has been taken up by\nthe political philosophies of Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito\n(Ricciardi 2009). In doing so, Agamben (who wrote his dissertation on\nWeil\u2019s political thought and critique of personhood, ideas of\nwhich went on to shape Homo Sacer [see Agamben 2017]) and\nEsposito rely on Weil\u2019s concepts of decreation, impersonality,\nand force. Beyond the Continental scene, her Christian\nPlatonism\u2014especially her concepts of the good, justice, void,\nand attention\u2014influenced Iris Murdoch\u2019s emphasis on the\ngood, metaphysics, and morality, and was thereby part of a recent\nrevival in virtue ethics (Crisp & Slote 1997). In addition, many\nhave noted the \u201cspiritual kinship\u201d that is apparent between the\nreligious and ethical philosophies of Weil and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\nFor example, the view that belief in God is not a matter of evidence,\nlogic, or proof is shared by these thinkers (Von der Ruhr 2006). The\nlegacy of Weil\u2019s writings on affliction and beauty in relation\nto justice is also felt in Elaine Scarry\u2019s writings on\naesthetics (Scarry 1999). T. S. Eliot, who wrote the introduction to\nThe Need for Roots, cites Weil as an inspiration of his\nliterature, as do W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery\nO\u2019Connor, Susan Sontag, and Anne Carson.\n\nThe Anglo-American secondary literature on Weil has emphasized her\nconcept of supernatural justice, including the philosophical tensions\nthat inform her materialism and mysticism (Winch 1989; Dietz 1988;\nBell 1993, 1998; Rhees 2000). Additional considerations treat her\nChristian Platonism (Springsted 1983; Doering & Springsted 2004).\nRecent English-language scholarship on Weil has included texts on her\nconcept of force (Doering 2010), her radicalism (Rozelle-Stone &\nStone 2010), and the relationship in her thought between science and\ndivinity (Morgan 2005), between suffering and trauma (Nelson 2017),\nand between decreation and ethics (Cha 2017). Furthermore, her\nconcepts have influenced recent contributions to questions of identity\n(Cameron 2007), political theology (Lloyd 2011), animality (Pick\n2011), and international relations (Kinsella 2021).\n",
