    "main_text": "Unicity vs. Plurality of Substantial Form\n13. Unicity vs. Plurality of Substantial Form\n\n\nHeatedly debated in the 1270s and 1280s both at Paris and Oxford was\nthe question concerning whether there is one or more than one\nsubstantial form in one substance, and especially in a human being.\nGodfrey devotes considerable attention to this, especially in Quodlibet\nII of Easter, 1286 and then again in Quodlibet III of Christmas, 1286.\nThese dates are significant because alleged theological difficulties\nwith the theory of unicity of substantial form as advanced by Aquinas\nand others had led to prohibitions and condemnations of this by the\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Robert Kilwardby, O.P. on March 18, 1277, a\nreissuing of this by his successor in that see, John Pecham, O.F.M. in\n1284, and finally a new and resounding condemnation by Pecham on April\n30, 1286.\n\n\nIn Quodlibet II, q. 7 Godfrey considers three theories that defend\nplurality of forms in all material substances, or at least of duality\nof substantial forms in human beings (Henry of Ghent). Godfrey severely\ncriticizes all three theories. Most fundamental among his many\narguments against them is his conviction that a substantial form\nconfers substantial being upon a composite substance. Therefore, the\npresence of more than one substantial form in such a being would\nundermine its substantial unity. Already in this discussion Godfrey\naddresses alleged theological issues raised against unicity of\nsubstantial form, especially one concerning the continuing numerical\nidentity of Christ\u2019s body during the period between his death on Good\nFriday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. At this point Godfrey\u2019s\nphilosophical preference is for unicity of form in all material\nentities, including humans. He regards theories that defend plurality\nof forms in all material substances as more improbable, and Henry\u2019s\ntheory of duality of forms in human beings as less improbable. He\nmaintains that the theological question remains open to a defense\neither of unicity or of plurality of substantial forms.\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 5, after Pecham\u2019s condemnation of April, 1286,\nGodfrey examines the theological aspects of this issue in detail. Again\nhe insists on one\u2019s freedom, theologically speaking, to defend either\nunicity or plurality of forms in human beings, especially at Paris, but\ndoes not commit himself definitively to either side (PB 2.197\u2013211). In\nsum, when he is primarily concerned with the philosophical issues\ninvolved, he favors unicity of substantial form in all material\nsubstances. When discussing the theological issues, he is more hesitant\nand, without embracing either side in any definitive way, continues to\nargue for one\u2019s freedom to defend either side pending some future\ndecision by the Church (Wippel, 1981, pp, 321\u201347).\n",
