Preludes in the Laws\n\nA significant part of the impetus for interpretations that see\nconsiderable differences between the Republic and the\nLaws comes from the presence in the latter of\n\u201cpreludes\u201d to individual laws and to the lawcode as a\nwhole that are available to all the citizens. In Plato\u2019s own\nview, one of the most important innovations in the political theory of\nthe Laws is the requirement that good lawgivers try to persuade the\ncitizens and not simply issue commands to them by means of laws\n(Laws 722B5\u2013C2). Plato compares the lawgiver in\nMagnesia to a free doctor treating free people. Slave doctors who\ntreat other slaves merely give them orders and then rush off to other\npatients. Free doctors treating free people must explain to their\npatients the condition they have and the rationale for treatment\nbefore prescribing (Laws 722B\u2013723B). In doing so, they\nwill \u201ceducate\u201d the patients and use \u201carguments that\ncome close to philosophizing\u201d (Laws 857C2\u2013E5).\nSimilarly, Plato thinks that the lawgiver in Magnesia should not\nmerely issue legal commands: law without persuasion is condemned as\nmere force (722B). Drawing on Plato\u2019s programmatic remarks in\nBooks 4, 9, and 10 the preludes should have the following\nfeatures.\n\nWhat the person who is to be persuaded is asking for is to be\n\u201ceducated\u201d or \u201ctaught,\u201d that is, to be given\ngood epistemic reasons for thinking that the principles lying behind\nthe legislation are true (Laws 885DE).\nWhat the lawgiver and the preludes actually do is characterized as\n\u201cteaching,\u201d that is, giving reasons to the citizens and\nbringing it about that they \u201clearn\u201d (Laws 718CD,\n720D, 723A, 857DE and 888A).\nThe preludes are thus designed to be instances of rational\npersuasion, that is, attempts to influence the citizens\u2019 beliefs\nby appealing to rational considerations. They are not intended to\ninculcate false, but useful beliefs, or to effect persuasion through\nnon-rational means.\nThe preludes are meant to provide quite general ethical\ninstruction. The lawgiver is to be a primary source of instruction\nabout what is fine, just and good. Thus the citizens will learn why\nthe laws are fine and just and should also learn why following the\nlaws and, more generally, acting virtuously is good for them. They are\nto receive a true and reasoned account of what is good for human\nbeings.\n\n\nThe view that this use of preludes marks a significant difference from\nthe Republic depends on two claims.\n\nThe Laws advocates the use of preludes, along with other\nmethods, to educate the citizens and give them some rational\nunderstanding of the laws and, more generally, an understanding of\nethical truths.\nThe Republic does not intend to provide, except to its\nhighest class, the philosopher-rulers, an education that can result in\nsuch a rational appreciation of basic ethical truths.\n\n\nWith respect to (II), advocates of the change interpretation point to\npassages from the Republic such as the following.\n\nTherefore, to insure that someone like that [one whose reason is not\nstrong enough to rule himself] is ruled by something similar to what\nrules the best person, we say that he ought to be the slave\n[doulon] of that best person who has a divine ruler within\nhimself. (Rep. 590C8\u2013D1)\n\n\nThe education provided to the two lower classes, it is argued, thus\ndoes not succeed in enabling them to be ruled by their own reason and\nleaves them in the state of slaves. In Republic Book 7, Plato\nconsiders whether the musical education the auxiliaries receive (which\nis the most advanced education that they get) tends to the good of\nleading the soul out of the Cave and toward the\n\u201cintelligible\u201d or \u201cknowable region.\u201d The\nanswer is that it does not, since musical education\n\neducated the guardians through habits. Its harmonies gave them a\ncertain harmoniousness, not knowledge; its rhythms gave them a certain\nrhythmical quality; and its stories whether fictional or nearer the\ntruth, cultivated other habits akin to these. But there was nothing in\nit that aimed at any such subject as you are now seeking.\n(Rep. 522A4\u2013B1, cf. 484C3\u2013D10 and\n516E8\u2013517E2)\n\n\nThus all citizens, other than the philosopher-rulers, remain within\nthe Cave.\n\nBoth (I) and (II) are, however, quite controversial. With respect to\n(I), some have argued that despite the fact that Plato\u2019s\nprogrammatic remarks about the preludes suggest that they are designed\nto further a rational appreciation of ethical truths, what is actually\nprovided for the vast majority of the citizens is, primarily,\nrhetorical persuasion appealing to their sense of honor and shame.\nThis gap is then explained either by the hypothesis (i) that Plato is\nbeing deceptive, or his mental capacities declined in old age; or (ii)\nthat the programmatic remarks represent an ideal that Plato makes it\nclear cannot be realized in actual\n practice.[30]\n Evaluating the acceptability of (II) will require careful examination\nof the education provided to the Republic\u2019s auxiliary\nand money-making classes and, in particular, consideration of what the\nauxiliaries\u2019 \u201cmusical education\u201d provides them\n with.[31]\n\nInterpretations that see the main aim of the preludes as providing,\nalong with the rest of the citizens\u2019 education, a rational,\nalthough less than fully philosophic, grasp of basic ethical\nprinciples need not hold that this is the only aim of the preludes or\nthat there is only one kind of prelude. Plato does include some\npreludes \u2013 e.g. those to laws pertaining to murders that are\nespecially heinous in that they are fully voluntary and committed out\nof desire for pleasure, envy and so on \u2013 that work primarily by\nrhetorical means or appeal to myths that Plato probably did not accept\nas literally true (e.g. 870D\u2013871A). Such preludes are designed,\nas Saunders notes, for those citizens who have badly failed to benefit\nfrom Magnesia\u2019s educational system (Saunders 1992,\n210\u201311). Such preludes are a last resort before the infliction\nof punishment and are aimed at the inevitable failures among the\ncitizens. Interpretations stressing the rational aim of the preludes\nargue that Magnesia\u2019s education is intended to give the citizens\nas a whole the ability to follow the more sophisticated preludes and\nthat such preludes are not restricted to an elite sub-class of\ncitizens.\n\nFurther progress in resolving these disputes might be made by\ncontinued research on three topics. First, we must consider the\npreludes in light of the broader context of the citizens\u2019\neducation in the Laws. What sort of education is provided for\nthem and what cognitive and ethical abilities will such education\nfoster? Second, we need to examine Plato\u2019s views about education\nin the other late dialogues, especially the\n Statesman.[32]\n Finally, the issues concerning citizens\u2019 education are\nintimately linked to deep questions in Plato\u2019s psychology and\nepistemology. In order to understand what kind of education is\nrequired in order to have a rational grasp of ethical principles we\nmust consider the nature of ethical learning, given Plato\u2019s\nepistemology and psychology, in both the middle and late periods. This\nissue is discussed a bit further in section 10.\n",
