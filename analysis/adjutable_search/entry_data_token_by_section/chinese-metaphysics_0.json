Is there \u201cMetaphysics\u201d in Chinese Philosophy?\n\nThis entire entry could be taken up with the question begged by its\ntitle: Is there metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy? Rather than argue\nfor the legitimacy of my topic in the abstract, I will explicate\nspecific issues and positions from various Chinese philosophers,\nleaving it to readers to decide how well they fit the category of\nmetaphysics. Nonetheless, I cannot entirely ignore the problem of\napplying the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d so far beyond its Greek\norigins, and so a few preliminary comments are\n necessary.[1]\n\nIf we designate an area of philosophical inquiry concerned with the\nultimate nature of reality\u2014its being, origins, components, ways\nof changing, and so on\u2014there is no question that Chinese\nphilosophers addressed issues within this domain. The question is, do\nwe apply the label of \u201cmetaphysics\u201d to philosophical\narguments within this domain, or do we reserve the label for some\nspecifically European approach or theory? The latter faces an obvious\nproblem\u2014any definition broad enough to include all European\napproaches will include some Chinese theories, just as any definition\nnarrow enough to exclude all Chinese approaches will exclude some\nEuropean philosophers that everyone would agree addressed metaphysics.\nThe choice of definitions is as much about rhetoric and power as the\nfacts. If \u201cmetaphysics\u201d labels the broader domain, then\nstudying metaphysics involves engaging other cultures. In contrast, if\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d labels a specifically European view, then\ncourses, books, and encyclopedia entries on metaphysics legitimately\nexclude other cultures. Aside from the political consequences of that\nexclusion, it obscures the many areas in which the traditions can be\nplaced in fruitful dialogue. Those factors support using an expansive\ndefinition of metaphysics, but applying \u201cmetaphysics\u201d to\nboth European and Chinese thought risks obscuring the differences\nbetween the two. More insidiously, it erodes these differences by\npresenting Chinese philosophy in European terms. That is a legitimate\nworry, but I think the greater danger is in ignoring what Chinese\nPhilosophy might contribute to discussions of metaphysics.\n\nIf we do take Chinese Philosophy as having metaphysics, we must strive\nto avoid distorting it to fit into European terms. One problem is in\nselecting topics. A simple approach would be to list the main topics\nin European metaphysics and then see what Chinese philosophers have to\nsay about them. The results would be disappointing, and this approach\nwould miss what is most interesting about a cross-cultural\nperspective, which is its ability to raise new questions. Within this\nentry, I have tried as much as possible to follow and explicate the\nmain issues that arose when Chinese philosophers were concerned with\nthe nature of reality. I have then made brief gestures toward how\nthese issues might connect to metaphysical problems in the European\ntradition.\n\nA second problem is with drawing boundaries. A label like\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d refers to certain human practices at the\nsame time that it draws boundaries around those practices. While\nChinese philosophers engaged in the kinds of practices that\nmetaphysics refers to, they did not draw the same boundaries.\nIsolating metaphysical inquiry from practices of self-cultivation, for\nexample, would have struck almost any Chinese philosopher as odd, if\nnot dangerous. There is no native Chinese term marking the same\nboundaries as \u201cmetaphysics\u201d in European philosophy. When\nChinese encountered the term, it was translated by way of Japanese as\nxing er shang xue \u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u5b78,\nliterally, \u201cthe study of what is above forms.\u201d \u201cWhat\nis above forms\u201d had long been a central concept in Chinese\nphilosophy, originating in a passage from the \u201cXici\u201d\ncommentary on the Yi Jing \u6613\u7d93, the Classic\nof Changes, which says: \u201cWhat is above forms refers to the\nway [dao \u9053]; what is below forms refers to utensils\n[qi \u5668]\u201d (Gao Heng 1998,\n 407).[2]\n The distinction between what is above forms and what is below forms\nhas a vague resemblance to the distinction between metaphysics and\nphysics, but it is more specific (Zheng 2017; R. Wang 2015). The\ncontrast is between the formed and the formless. Both were taken to be\nimmanent in the world. They are two aspects of the processes of nature\nand would not be taken as distinct areas of inquiry. The implications\nof this view will appear across a range of metaphysical issues.\n",
