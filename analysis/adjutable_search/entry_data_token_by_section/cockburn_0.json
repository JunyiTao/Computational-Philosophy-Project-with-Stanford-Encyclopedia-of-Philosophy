    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nCockburn was born in London on August 16,\n 1679.[1]\n As a child, she taught herself to write, became proficient in French,\nand studied Latin grammar and logic. In addition to her studies, she\ndevoted time to writing plays. In 1695, Cockburn\u2019s first play\nAgnes de Castro was staged, and was published the following\nyear. In 1698, her second play, Fatal Friendship, was staged\nand printed. Both plays were very well received and she enjoyed some\ncelebrity in theatrical circles. Cockburn wrote three more plays over\nthe next three years.\n\nWhile Catharine Trotter was establishing her reputation as a\nplaywright, she was also studying Locke\u2019s work, An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding. Trotter was so deeply impressed\nwith his ideas that she felt obliged to take up her pen in defense of\nLocke. Cockburn\u2019s first philosophical work, published in 1702\nand entitled The Defence of Mr. Locke\u2019s Essay of Human\nUnderstanding, was a response to a series of three\nanonymously-penned pamphlets critical of Locke\u2019s Essay.\nLocke himself was so impressed with the work, he presented Cockburn\nwith a substantial gift of money and books in appreciation.\n\nIn 1739, Cockburn wrote her Remarks upon some Writers in the\nControversy concerning the Foundation of moral Duty and moral\nObligation. It was finally published, anonymously, in 1743 in the\nEnglish literary journal The History of the Works of the\nLearned. Remarks upon some Writers considers primarily\nthe work of philosopher Samuel Clarke and various critics of his moral\ntheory. In 1747, she published a critique of the moral philosophy of\nDr. Thomas Rutherforth, entitled Remarks upon the Principles and\nReasonings of Dr. Rutherforth\u2019s Essay on the Nature and\nObligation of Virtue, whose work was strongly critical of Samuel\nClarke\u2019s moral theory. In this work, Cockburn again defends a\nClarkean view of morality.\n\nCockburn was also deeply interested in religious issues and she wrote\nand published a series of theological works. These included a work, in\nthe form of two letters, that examined Catholic and Protestant\ndoctrine entitled A Discourse concerning a Guide in\nControversies. This work was first published in 1707. Another\nwork, first published in 1726, entitled A Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\nOccasioned by his Sermon, was mainly a defense of Locke\u2019s\northodoxy against charges of heresy. She wrote and published a second\nVindication of Locke\u2019s orthodoxy against Holdsworth, in\ntwo parts.This work was not published until it was included in\nCockburn\u2019s collected works; Cockburn\u2019s work had attracted\nsufficient attention that Thomas Birch approached her with the idea of\na volume of her collected works, including her correspondence. She\naided in the editing of this work, but did not live to see its\npublication in 1751. She died in May of 1749.\n",
