    "main_text": "The explanatory question: How can consciousness exist? || The explanatory gap\n5.2 The explanatory gap\n\n\nOur current inability to supply a suitably intelligible link is\nsometimes described, following Joseph Levine (1983), as the existence\nof an explanatory gap, and as indicating our incomplete\nunderstanding of how consciousness might depend upon a nonconscious\nsubstrate, especially a physical substrate. The basic gap claim admits\nof many variations in generality and thus in strength.\n\n\nIn perhaps its weakest form, it asserts a practical limit\non our present explanatory abilities; given our current\ntheories and models we can not now articulate an intelligible link. A\nstronger version makes an in principle claim about our\nhuman capacities and thus asserts that given our human\ncognitive limits we will never be able to bridge the gap. To us, or\ncreatures cognitively like us, it must remain a residual mystery\n(McGinn 1991). Colin McGinn (1995) has argued that given the inherently\nspatial nature of both our human perceptual concepts and the scientific\nconcepts we derive from them, we humans are not conceptually suited for\nunderstanding the nature of the psychophysical link. Facts about that\nlink are as cognitively closed to us as are facts about multiplication\nor square roots to armadillos. They do not fall within our conceptual\nand cognitive repertoire. An even stronger version of the gap claim\nremoves the restriction to our cognitive nature and denies in\nprinciple that the gap can be closed by any cognitive\nagents.\n\n\nThose who assert gap claims disagree among themselves about what\nmetaphysical conclusions, if any, follow from our supposed epistemic\nlimits. Levine himself has been reluctant to draw any anti-physicalist\nontological conclusions (Levine 1993, 2001). On the other hand some\nneodualists have tried to use the existence of the gap to refute\nphysicalism (Foster 1996, Chalmers 1996). The stronger one's\nepistemological premise, the better the hope of deriving a metaphysical\nconclusion. Thus unsurprisingly, dualist conclusions are often\nsupported by appeals to the supposed impossibility in\nprinciple of closing the gap.\n\n\nIf one could see on a priori grounds that there is no way\nin which consciousness could be intelligibly explained as arising from\nthe physical, it would not be a big step to concluding that it in fact\ndoes not do so (Chalmers 1996). However, the very strength of such an\nepistemological claim makes it difficult to assume with begging the\nmetaphysical result in question. Thus those who wish to use a strong\nin principle gap claim to refute physicalism must find\nindependent grounds to support it. Some have appealed to conceivability\narguments for support, such as the alleged conceivability of zombies\nmolecularly identical with conscious humans but devoid of all\nphenomenal consciousness (Campbell 1970, Kirk 1974, Chalmers 1996).\nOther supporting arguments invoke the supposed non-functional nature of\nconsciousness and thus its alleged resistance to the standard\nscientific method of explaining complex properties (e.g., genetic\ndominance) in terms of physically realized functional conditions (Block\n1980a, Chalmers 1996). Such arguments avoid begging the\nanti-physicalist question, but they themselves rely upon claims and\nintuitions that are controversial and not completely independent of\none's basic view about physicalism. Discussion on the topic remains\nactive and ongoing.\n\n\nOur present inability to see any way of closing the gap may exert\nsome pull on our intuitions, but it may simply reflect the limits of\nour current theorizing rather than an unbridgeable in principle barrier\n(Dennett 1991). Moreover, some physicalists have argued that\nexplanatory gaps are to be expected and are even entailed by plausible\nversions of ontological physicalism, ones that treat human agents as\nphysically realized cognitive systems with inherent limits that derive\nfrom their evolutionary origin and situated contextual mode of\nunderstanding (Van Gulick 1985, 2003; McGinn 1991, Papineau 1995,\n2002). On this view, rather than refuting physicalism, the existence of\nexplanatory gaps may confirm it. Discussion and disagreement on these\ntopics remains active and ongoing.\n",
