    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLeucippus is variously said to have been born in Elea, Abdera or\nMiletus (DK 67A1). His dates are unknown, other than that he lived\nduring the fifth century BCE. Diogenes Laertius reports that he was a\nstudent of Parmenides\u2019 follower Zeno (DK 67A1). Zeno is best\nknown for paradoxes suggesting that motion would be impossible if a\nmagnitude could be divided into an infinite number of parts, each of\nwhich must be traversed, and other absurdities associated with taking\nmagnitudes to be infinitely divisible.  The likelihood that atomism\nis thought to have been formulated at least partly in response to\nthese arguments may account for the story that Leucippus was a student\nof Zeno.\n\nThe extent of Leucippus\u2019 contribution to the developed atomist\ntheory is unknown. His relationship to Democritus, and even his very\nexistence, was a subject of considerable controversy in nineteenth\ncentury scholarship (Graham 2008). Most reports on early Greek atomism\nrefer to the views of Democritus alone, or to both atomists together;\nEpicurus seems even to have denied that there was a philosopher\nLeucippus (DK 67A2). Aristotle certainly ascribes the foundation of\nthe atomist system to Leucippus. Leucippus is sometimes said to have\nbeen the author of a work called the Great World-System; one\nsurviving quotation is said to have come from a work On\nMind.\n",
