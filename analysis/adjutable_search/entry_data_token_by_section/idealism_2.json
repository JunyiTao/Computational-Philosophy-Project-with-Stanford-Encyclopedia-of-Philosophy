Idealism in Early Modern British philosophy\n\nThe relation between ontological and epistemological arguments for\nidealism is complex. Idealism can be argued for on ontological\ngrounds, and then bring an epistemological argument in its train. Or\nan epistemological argument can be offered independently of\nontological assumptions but lead to idealism, especially in the hope\nof avoiding skepticism. The first option may have been characteristic\nof some rationalists, such as Leibniz in his more strictly idealist\nmood. Both forms of argument are found within early modern British\nphilosophy. We find epistemological considerations pushing toward\nidealism in both Hobbes and Locke in spite of the avowed materialism\nof the first and dualism of the second, who therefore obviously did\nnot call themselves idealists. Berkeley argues for idealism on\nepistemological grounds and then adds ontological considerations in\norder to avert skepticism, although he calls his position\nimmaterialism rather than idealism. Berkeley\u2019s contemporary\nArthur Collier, who explicitly denies the existence of\nmind-independent matter without giving his own position a name, argues\nfirst in an epistemological mood, then moves from epistemology to\nontology. Hume, by contrast, although calling himself neither an\nimmaterialist nor an idealist, nevertheless adopts epistemological\narguments for idealism similar to some of Berkeley\u2019s, but then\nuses that position as the basis for a critique of traditional\nmetaphysical pretensions, including those to idealism\u2014while also\nbeing drawn to idealism in resistance to what he regards as the\nnatural tendency to dualism. Hume\u2019s critical attitude toward\nmetaphysics is subsequently taken up by Kant, although Kant famously\nasserts on practical grounds some of the very same metaphysical theses\nthat he argues cannot be asserted on theoretical grounds.\n\nThe British philosophers were all hostile toward dogmatic metaphysics\nin Wolff\u2019s sense, although until the time of Hume, who had some\nfamiliarity with Leibniz, the metaphysics with which they were\nfamiliar were those of Descartes, Aristotelian scholasticism, and\nNeo-Platonism, which had become domesticated in Britain through the\nwork of the Cambridge Platonists in the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury. All of these movements fed into the general movement of\nrationalism, while the British philosophers, typically lumped together\nunder the rubric of empiricism in spite of their own differences, all\nbelieved, albeit for different reasons, that the doctrines put forward\nby dogmatic metaphysicians rest on a totally unfounded conception of\nknowledge and cannot survive rational scrutiny (empiricists might\nthemselves be considered critical rationalists). Thus the primary task\nof philosophy for these philosophers became that of providing a theory\nof knowledge based on an adequate assessment of the constitution of\nhuman nature, for they were interested in knowledge only as a human\nachievement. However, it is not human nature in general that is of\ninterest in this context but the workings of those human powers or\nfaculties that are responsible for our human ability to relate to the\nworld in terms of knowledge-claims. (Thus Kant\u2019s attempt to\nargue on practical grounds for metaphysical theses that could not be\njustified on theoretical grounds would be a major departure from the\nmethods of the British empiricists.) These faculties were attributed\nby the British as well as their Continental opponents to what was\ncalled \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201cmind\u201d (mens,\nconsciousness, Bewu\u00dftsein), an attribution which\nresulted in moving the \u201coperations of the mind\u201d into the\ncenter of philosophical attention. Reflections on the conditions of\nthe possibility of knowledge led Hobbes and Locke to idealism in spite\nof their ontological commitments to materialism or dualism\nrespectively, while Berkeley concluded that their epistemology would\nlead to a skepticism that could be avoided only by his own more\nradical \u201cimmaterialist\u201d ontology. Hume\u2019s position\nremains complex and for this reason controversial. His thesis that our\nbeliefs in causation, external objects, and even the self are all\nfounded on \u201ccustom\u201d and imagination rather than\n\u201creason\u201d may be considered an epistemological position\nwithout ontological implications, thus not an argument for idealism;\nbut while he sometimes seems to attempt to avoid commitment on\nontological questions altogether, at other times, as in his argument\nthat the existence of external objects in addition to our impressions\nis only a fiction, he seems to infer idealism from his epistemology.\nIn spite of their differences, almost all British philosophers from\nHobbes up to and including Hume insisted that the highest priority for\nphilosophy is to give an analysis of the conditions and the origin of\nknowledge, while they gave not only somewhat different accounts of\nwhat these conditions consist in and how they contribute to a\nconvincing story about the origin of knowledge but they also had to\nface quite interesting \u201cmetaphysical\u201d consequences from\ntheir respective accounts.\n\nThis is easily confirmed by looking briefly at some of their main\nconvictions concerning knowledge, starting with Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131679). As Hobbes points out in the chapters Of\nPhilosophy and Of Method in the first part\n(Computation or Logic) of the first section (Concerning\nBody) of his Elements of Philosophy (1655), knowledge is\nthe result of the manipulation of sensory input based on the\nemployment of logical rules of reasoning (ratiocination) in acts of\nwhat he calls \u201ccomputation\u201d. He describes the details of\nthis process most succinctly in a short passage in chapter 6 of the\nfirst part (Human Nature) of his The Elements of Law,\nNatural and Politic (1640), his first major philosophical work.\nAfter distinguishing what he calls \u201csense, or knowledge\noriginal\u201d from \u201cknowledge \u2026 which we call\nscience\u201d, he goes on to \u201cdefine\u201d knowledge \u201cto\nbe evidence of truth, from some beginning or principle of sense\u201d\nand formulates four principles that are constitutive of knowledge:\n\n\nThe first principle of knowledge therefore is that we have such and\nsuch conceptions; the second, that we have thus and thus named the\nthings whereof they are conceptions; the third is, that we have joined\nthose names in such manner, as to make true propositions; the fourth\nand last is, that we have joined those propositions in such manner as\nthey be concluding. (1640: I.6.4)\n\n\nThe message is straightforward with respect to both the basis and the\nformation of knowledge: senses (sensations) are basic to our\nacquisition of knowledge in that they lead to conceptions\n(representations) to which we attach names (concepts) which we then\nput together into propositions which, if true, already constitute\nknowledge, and from which there arise further knowledge if we draw\nconclusions in an orderly way from them.\n\nAlthough the account given by Hobbes of the origin and the formation\nof knowledge is rightly called empiricist because it traces all\nknowledge back to the senses or sensations and their non-sensory\ncauses, i.e., to what he calls \u201cthings without us\u201d, it is\nby no means directly committed to either idealism or dualism; on the\ncontrary, Hobbes\u2019s preferred ontological position is\nmaterialism. Nevertheless, his account may lead to an early form of\nepistemologically motivated idealism. This is so because although\nHobbes makes no claims as to either the constitution and the reality\nof what causes sensations or to any specific contribution on the part\nof the subject of knowledge to what we take to be the \u201caccidents\nor qualities\u201d of objects, he states, again most explicitly in\nthe part on Human Nature in The Elements of Law, (1)\nthat there are causes of our sensations which by way of their motions\ngive rise to what we sense as qualities, but (2) that these qualities\nonly have the status of \u201cseemings and apparitions\u201d. In his\nown words: \u201cThe things that really are in the world without us,\nare those motions by which these seemings are caused\u201d\n(Elements of Law, I.2.10). While he is confident that there\nare external objects, and thus has no intention of affirming idealism,\nnevertheless because in Hobbes\u2019s opinion we could have\nconceptions of these seemings even if there were no objects around\n(Elements of Law I.1.8) there is for him no basis on which to\nfound any metaphysical claims to the real existence of an external\nworld or any epistemological basis for claiming knowledge of the real\nconstitution of a subject-independent world or its real existence.\nThus, Hobbes\u2019s epistemology allows him at most agnosticism about\nthe existence of objects other than our representations of them, even\nif it does not force him into outright idealism. This is nicely\nconfirmed by a passage from part II (The First Grounds of\nPhilosophy) where he declares:\n\n\nNow things may be considered, that is, be brought into account, either\nas internal accidents of our mind, in which manner we consider them\nwhen the question is about some faculty of the mind; or as species of\nexternal things, not as really existing, but appearing only to\nexist, or to have a being without us [emphasis added]. And in\nthis manner we are now to consider them. (Elements of Law\nII.7.1)\n\n\nIn spite of a pre-reflective disposition toward dualism, an explicit\nargument for an agnostic attitude with respect to the ultimate\nconstitution of reality is also characteristic of John Locke\n(1632\u20131704). Already in The Epistle to the Reader of\nAn Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690) he denounces\nrationalist metaphysics as a \u201cSanctuary of Vanity and\nIgnorance\u201d and declares in the first book of his Essay\nright at the outset:\n\n\nI shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the\nmind; or trouble myself to examine, wherein its essence consists, or\nby what motions of our spirits, or alterations of our bodies, we come\nto have any sensation by our organs, or any ideas in our\nunderstandings; and whether those ideas do in their formation,\nany, or all of them, depend on matter or no [emphasis added]:\nThese are speculations, which, however curious and entertaining, I\nshall decline. (Book I, chap. I, 2; see also II.XXI.73)\n\n\nInstead he restricts his investigation to the \u201cpurpose to\nenquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human\nknowledge\u201d (Essay I.I.2). Such an investigation\npresupposes an acquaintance with our own minds, and thus according to\nLocke the most pressing task is to understand the mind or the\nunderstanding itself. And because for Locke the sole material the mind\nhas the ability to process are ideas, the most pressing task if one\nwants to understand the possibility of knowledge is to give an account\nof \u201chow he [the mind] comes by them [the ideas]\u201d\n(Essay II.I.1). There is no need to go into the details of\nLocke\u2019s conception of how the mind gets ideas and what the\nunderstanding does with them in order to arrive at knowledge. Although\nhis description of these processes differs in some interesting ways\nfrom the model Hobbes proposes, in the end both Hobbes and Locke share\nthe view (1) that whatever we can know depends on our having ideas\nwhich must be somehow based in sensation, (2) that there must be some\nexternal cause (Hobbes) or some source of affection (Locke) which\ngives rise to sensory ideas, yet (3) ultimately we are ignorant about\nthe real constitution of these causes and these sources. What we know\nis the content and structure of our own ideas, although we have no\nreason to deny the existence of external objects and even assume that\nin some regards external objects resemble our ideas of them (in the\ncase of primary qualities).\n\nObviously it is mainly point (3) that is of importance for the\nquestion of whether dualism or idealism is involved in Locke\u2019s\nversion of the operations of the mind. Again, as in the case of\nHobbes, it seems that Locke\u2019s position is meant to be neutral\nagainst and compatible with all these alternatives and that he wishes\nto stay agnostic with respect to them. This is indicated especially\nwell by his theory of substance and his remarks concerning the limits\nof knowledge. Substances, Locke famously holds, \n\n\nare such combinations of simple Ideas, as are taken to represent\ndistinct particular things subsisting by themselves. (Essay\nII.XII.6) \n\n\nIf one analyzes our concept of a substance one\n\n\nwill find he has no other Idea of it at all, but only a Supposition of\nhe knows not what support of such qualities, which are capable of\nproducing simple Ideas in us. (Essay II.XXIII.2)\n\n\nThe reasons for this supposition are two: (1) we cannot make sense of\nthe concept of an unsupported quality or of ideas subsisting by\nthemselves, (2) we know from experience that \u201ca certain number\nof these simple Ideas go constantly together\u201d or \u201cexist\ntogether\u201d (Essay II.XXIII.2\u20133). Although Locke\nthinks of these reasons as totally compelling, he sees quite well that\nthey do not justify any claim as to what a substance or a thing really\nis, what its nature or constitution consists in. Thus he never gets\ntired of emphasizing that we only have a confused idea of substance (a\nclaim also made by Leibniz about three-quarters of our knowledge,\nalthough he held that we have a clear concept of what substance is),\nand repeats quite often (at least three times in Essay book\nII, chap. XXIII alone) that\n\n\nWhatever therefore be the secret, abstract nature of substance in\ngeneral, all the ideas we have of particular distinct sorts of\nsubstances, are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas,\nco-existing in such, though unknown, cause of their union, as makes\nthe whole subsist of itself. (Essay II.XXIII.6)\n\n\nHe restricts this agnostic attitude not just to corporeal substances\nor bodies but extends it to spiritual substances or minds as well:\n\n\nIt is plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter is as\nremote from our conceptions and apprehensions, as that of spiritual\nsubstance or spirit; and therefore from our not having any notion of\nthe substance of spirit, we can no more conclude its non-existence,\nthan we can for the same reason deny the existence of body; it being\nas rational to affirm there is no body, because we have no clear and\ndistinct idea of the substance of matter, as to say there is no\nspirit, because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of\na spirit. (Essay II.XXIII.5)\n\n\nThis criticism of any metaphysical claims concerning the ultimate\nconstitution of reality is accompanied by a more general warning\nagainst the overstepping of the natural limits of our cognitive\nfaculties. According to Locke it is just a fact about human nature\nthat there are limits to the powers of the understanding. These powers\nare meant to be bestowed to us by God to an extent sufficient for us\nto know \u201cWhatever is necessary for the Conveniences of Life, and\nInformation of Virtue\u201d (Essay I.I.5; see also\nII.XXIII.12) but only to that extent. If therefore the nature and the\nconstitution of substances both corporeal and spiritual are beyond our\ncognitive grasp then we should take this to be a hint that God has set\nlimits to what we can know because he sees no reason for us to know\neverything. Even if the powers He endowed on us would be magnified\ninfinitely we still would remain clueless as to what substances really\nare because we still would be stuck in a world of qualities (this is\none way of reading Essay II.XXIII.12). Thus, in the end\nmetaphysical knowledge of any kind is meant to be beyond our reach.\nThis, however, is nothing we should be concerned about:\n\n\nFor, though the comprehension of our understandings comes exceeding\nshort of the vast extent of things; yet we shall have cause enough to\nmagnify the bountiful author of our being, for that proportion and\ndegree of knowledge he has bestowed on us, so far above all the rest\nof the inhabitants of this our mansion. (Essay I.I.5)\n\n\nFor Locke, ontological agnosticism is an expression of piety.\nLocke\u2019s position may be regarded as a theological expression of\nthe most fundamental epistemological motivation for idealism: no\nmatter how much we know about objects and at what level of detail, we\nstill know them only from our own, human point of view, but whether\nobjects exist beyond our experience of them is really none of our\nbusiness. But neither is Locke prepared to assert that only spirits or\nminds exist; that too would exceed the bounds of human knowledge.\n\nThe agnosticism with respect to the ultimate constitution of\nsubstances and things or of the fundamentum in re of\n\u201cthe ideas thereof\u201d characteristic of Hobbes and Locke is\nchallenged forcefully by George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), for whom\ntheir agnosticism becomes a form of skepticism and even impiety. In\nhis Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\n(1710) he raises doubts about whether an agnostic stance along the\nlines of Hobbes and Locke can be upheld consistently if one thinks\nabout the origin and the properties of ideas the way they do. Although\nin his Treatise Berkeley does not mention Hobbes at all and\naddresses Locke not by his name but by formulas like \u201cesteemed\nphilosopher\u201d and \u201clearned author\u201d (1710:\nIntroduction, \u00a711) very few times, it is abundantly clear that he\nwants to confront especially Locke with a painful choice: either his\nconception of a substance or a thing has \u201cno distinct meaning\nannexed to\u201d it (1710: Part I, \u00a717) and is nonsense, or he\nhas to endorse not just epistemological agnosticism but full-blown\nidealism or, in Berkeley\u2019s term, immaterialism. In other words,\nBerkeley\u2019s point is that Locke cannot afford to be agnostic with\nrespect to the metaphysical status of substances and things if he\nwants us to think of ideas as the immediate objects of human\nknowledge. Arthur Collier (1680\u20131732) would make a similar\nargument.\n\nBerkeley offers both epistemological and metaphysical arguments for\nhis immaterialism. His epistemological arguments begin from the\npremise that ideas and only ideas are the objects of human knowledge,\na presupposition that he at least considered uncontroversial. Although\nhis taxonomy of the different kinds of ideas deviate in ways that are\nnot of interest here from Locke\u2019s classification, he agrees with\nLocke that ideas exist only \u201cin the mind\u201d (1710: Part I,\n\u00a72). He takes the mind to be a \u201cperceiving, active\nbeing\u201d which itself is not \n\n\nany one of my ideas, but a thing entirely distinct from them, wherein\nthey exist or, which is the same thing, whereby they are perceived.\n(1710: Part I, \u00a72) \n\n\nFrom these stipulations he derives his most fundamental and famous\nclaim (1) that \u201cthe existence of an idea consists in being\nperceived\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a72) or that \u201ctheir\nesse is percipi\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a73) by\nthe perceiving, active mind. Already here Berkeley has the means in\nplace to cast into doubt the meaningfulness of the assumption that\nthere might exist unperceived objects or things. This is due to his\nrestriction of existence to what is perceivable or, even narrower, to\nwhat is perceived: If the only objects that exist for a\nmind\u2014whether it is my own mind or the mind of other human beings\nor the divine mind\u2014are ideas because there is nothing else that\ncan exist for the mind, then the very concept of something that exists\nbut is not for the mind or is unperceived is a contradiction in terms.\nThus if, as Berkeley supposes Locke does, one thinks of things as\nconsisting of collections of ideas, he asks how could one take a thing\nto be something other than ideas and nevertheless to exist? This\nquestion underlies Berkeley\u2019s confidence in what is often\nreferred to as his \u201cmaster argument\u201d, the argument that\none cannot conceive of anything existing unconceived because in trying\nto do so one is still conceiving of the object (1710: Part I,\n\u00a723). This seems open to the obvious objection that he is\nconfusing the content of a proposition (for example, \u201cThe earth\nmay still exist after the extinction of all conscious life\u201d)\nwith the act of entertaining (\u201cconceiving\u201d) such a\nproposition, which of course cannot take place except in a conscious\nbeing; but if he is already committed to the thought that objects of\nknowledge are nothing but ideas, it is at least understandable that he\nshould overlook this distinction.\n\nThe second conviction, also meant to be damaging to Locke\u2019s view\nabout substances, on which Berkeley rests his case in favor of\nidealism is the more strictly metaphysical claim (2) that \u201can\nidea can be like nothing but an idea\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a78).\nAlthough this claim is initially put forward in the context of his\nwell-known criticism of Locke\u2019s primary-secondary-quality\ndistinction, it is equally relevant for his denial that there are\nthings \u201cwithout the mind\u201d. The reasoning on which this\nclaim is based seems to be the following: For two items to stand in\nthe relation of likeness they must have something in common. However,\nif an idea is mind-dependent and if ideas are all there is for the\nmind, then what is \u201cwithout the mind\u201d must be different in\nevery respect from an idea. Thus a relation of likeness cannot obtain\nbetween ideas \u201cin the mind\u201d and things \u201cwithout the\nmind\u201d. Berkeley puts this point quite bluntly by appealing to\nobservation:\n\n\nIf we look but ever so little into our thoughts, we shall find it\nimpossible for us to conceive a likeness except only between our\nideas. Again, I ask whether those supposed originals or external\nthings, of which our ideas are the pictures or representations, be\nthemselves perceivable or no? if they are, then they are\nideas, and we have gained our point; but if you say they are not,\nI appeal to any one whether it be sense, to assert a colour is like\nsomething which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which is\nintangible; and so of the rest. (1710: Part I, \u00a78)\n\n\nThere is a third metaphysical claim that is essential to both\nBerkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke and the idealistic position he is\ngoing to adopt for himself. This is the claim (3) that ideas are\npassive and causally inert, i.e., they can neither produce nor alter\nanother idea (1710: Part I, \u00a725). This claim he also purports to\nbase on observation:\n\n\nwhoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflection,\nwill not perceive in them any power or activity; there is therefore no\nsuch thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us\nthat the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in\nit, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do any thing, or,\nstrictly speaking, to be the cause of any thing. (1710: Part I,\n\u00a725)\n\n\nPerhaps this is intended as an epistemological premise for an\nontological claim. Be that as it may, again the primary function of\nthis claim is to discredit a Lockean view according to which we have\nto think of the primary qualities of things\u2014which are contents\nof the most fundamental ideas we have of them\u2014as the causes of\nsensations or of sensory ideas. It is, however, also meant to support\nthe untenability of the assumption that agnosticism with respect to\nthe real existence of mind-independent things is a viable option for a\nbeliever in Locke\u2019s model of how and by what means we acquire\nknowledge of objects.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke\u2019s theory concerning\nsubstances is not carried out for its own sake. On the contrary, it is\nmeant to establish what Berkeley thinks to be the unavoidable\nmetaphysical consequences of a position that takes ideas \u201cin the\nmind\u201d to be the only material for the operations of the mind in\nits acquisition of knowledge. These metaphysical consequences consist\nin a thoroughgoing idealism or \u201cimmaterialism\u201d with\nrespect to the nature and constitution of things or substances.\nBerkeley\u2019s way of establishing this result is open to many\nquestions. However, the basic outline of his overall argument can be\nsketched thus: If existence is restricted to ideas (and minds) and if,\nwhat is undoubtedly the case, things or substances exist, then things\nor substances must be ideas (or minds) too. Now, as Locke has\nconvincingly shown, we can have ideas of particular things or\nsubstances, e.g., gold and lead, humans and sheep, distinguished by\nour ideas of their various properties, but we have only a confused or\nobscure idea of substance in general, which we suppose to underlie\nwhatever collection of ideas we take to be a thing or a substance of\none kind or another. But if we cannot have any ideas of things or\nsubstances other than our ideas of their properties, which clearly\nexist in minds, then the only clear ideas of things that we have is as\nideas, and in that case, if they do not seem to exist in our own\nindividual, human minds, then things or substances must be ideas in\nsome other non-human, i.e., divine mind. This divine mind cannot be\nitself an idea because it must be conceived as an active principle\nthat can be the cause of ideas, a principle of which we can have no\nidea but only a \u201cnotion\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a726,\n\u00a727). Therefore, the very fact that we take things or substances\nto be real commits us to the claim that things are ideal entities\nperceived by the mind of God. Idealism, one could say, is the only\ntenable basis for a realistic stance for Berkeley, but it leads to a\nrealism about minds, human and divine, rather than of what he always\ncalls material substance. And if one is to accept his\nre-interpretation of causality as a purported relation between ideas\nin terms of his theory of marks and signs, in particular his theory\nthat what we think of as ideas of objects are signs of (God\u2019s\nplan for) future possible ideas for us (cf. 1710: Part I, \u00a765\nf.), then one also has to agree to idealism. In Berkeley\u2019s view,\nthe only alternative to idealism is not materialism but\nskepticism.\n\nUp until the point at which he introduces the mind of God into his\nargument, all of Berkeley\u2019s epistemological considerations might\nbe thought of as expressions of the basic insight that we can only\nconceive of reality from our own point of view, which are then\nextended into full-blown idealism in order to avoid the whiff of\nagnosticism or skepticism and supplemented with the existence of a\ndivine mind in order to satisfy an ineliminable tendency to believe in\nthe existence of something more than one\u2019s own mind or even of\nhuman minds in general. We will later see that the tendency to\npreserve both the impulse to idealism and the conviction that there is\nsomething more than ordinary human minds by positing a more than human\nmind is characteristic of many versions of idealism until the end of\nits glory days at the beginning of the twentieth century. This\ntendency is decidedly absent from the philosophy of David Hume,\nhowever.\n\nArthur Collier was a much more obscure clergyman than Berkeley. He\npublished his Clavis Universalis: Or, A New Inquiry after Truth,\nBeing a Demonstration of the Non-Existence, or Impossibility, of an\nExternal World in 1713, the same year that Berkeley\u2019s\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge appeared, and three years after\nBerkeley\u2019s Three Dialogues; however, he states that he\nhad originally conceived his position a decade earlier, so before he\ncould have read Berkeley. Although the work was not widely read, it\nwas translated into German by Johann Christian Eschenbach in 1756, and\nthen noticed by Thomas Reid and following him Dugald Stewart. It was\nrepublished in English in 1837 along with Collier\u2019s other\nphilosophical work, A Specimen of True Philosophy, in a\ncollection of Metaphysical Tracts edited by Samuel Parr, and\nthen again in 1909, edited with an introduction by Ethel Bowman. By\n\u201cexternal\u201d Collier meant \u201cindependent, absolute, or\nself-existent\u201d, and his position is that \u201call matter,\nbody, extension, &c.\u201d (which he also frequently calls\n\u201cexpansion\u201d) depends \u201con mind, thought, or\nperception, and that it is not capable of an existence, which is not\nthus dependent\u201d (Collier 1713 [1909: 6]). Collier\u2019s\nposition is thus full-throated idealism, which he emphasizes is\nneither skepticism nor a denial that bodies exist, but the position\nthat \n\n\nsuch and such bodies, which are supposed to exist, do not exist\nexternally; or in universal terms, that there is no such thing as an\nexternal world. (1713 [1909: 9]) \n\n\nCollier argues for his idealism on both epistemological and more\npurely metaphysical ground. His work, although a footnote in the\nhistory of philosophy, is interesting precisely because it so clearly\nillustrates the dual strategies for arguing for idealism,\n\nCollier\u2019s most purely epistemological argument is that we are\nall familiar with (visual) experiences that are assumed to be of\nexternal objects but which do not differ from similar experiences\nwhich are clearly not of external objects, yet that there is no\ndiscernible difference between the latter and the former, thus that if\nthe latter are in or entirely dependent upon the mind, then so must be\nthe former. He uses examples such as those of imaginary beings,\nchimeras or centaurs (1713 [1909: 17]), which he supposes we\n(visually) represent just as vividly (his term, anticipating Hume) as\nother objects, secondary qualities (1713 [1909: 21\u20132]), cases of\ndouble vision, cases of experiences which change, such as different\nphases of the moon, when no one would believe that the external\nobjects is changing (1713 [1909: 33]), and mirror images, which\neveryone believes exist in the mind, not in the piece of glass outside\nus, and yet are indiscernible from other images of their objects. He\nalso equates being visible with being \u201cpresent to the\nmind\u201d, and asks how something could be present to the mind if it\nwere elsewhere from the mind? (1713 [1909: 35]). He infers that to be\nvisible is to be in or dependent upon the mind, and thus that to be\noutside of the mind would necessarily be to be invisible (1713 [1909:\n56]).\n\nThis begins the more purely metaphysical part of Collier\u2019s\nargument: that to be visible is to be in the mind we can consider an\nepistemological premise, but then he argues that nothing can be both\nvisible and invisible at the same time, which is of course quite true\nindependently of epistemology. A further argument he makes is that\nsince God can give created minds any ideas directly, it would be\nneedless for him to give us our ideas indirectly, by creating\nindependent objects to cause ideas in us, and God does nothing useless\n(1713 [1909: 60\u20132]). This is a metaphysical, in this case\ntheological argument, directed against the occasionalists Nicholas\nMalebranche and his English follower John Norris rather than against\nLocke. The most interesting of Collier\u2019s metaphysical arguments\nfor idealism, however, take the form of antinomies, and have sometimes\nbeen held to anticipate Kant\u2019s first and second antinomies\n(Bowman in Collier [1713] 1909: xxiv). Collier argues that there are\nsound arguments that an external world must be both finite and\ninfinite in \u201cexpanse\u201d or extension (1713 [1909: 63]), that\nit must be both finitely and infinitely divisible (1713 [1909: 68]),\nand that it must both be in motion as a whole and have moveable parts,\nbut also cannot be either of these (1713 [1909: 78]). Since the\nconcept of an external world is in these ways contradictory, such a\nthing cannot exist. It is striking, however, that Collier does not\nactually provide the arguments for what would become the theses and\nantitheses of Kant\u2019s first two antinomies, instead providing\nonly a version of Zeno\u2019s paradox to prove the impossibility of\nmoving parts within an extended universe, an antinomy that Kant dos\nnot take over. \n\nIt is not inconceivable that Kant knew of Collier\u2019s work through\nEschenbach\u2019s translation, although there is no direct evidence\nfor that. It is more likely that Collier\u2019s argument that the\ndifference between what we ordinarily take to be a veridical\nperception and a mere imagination or hallucination is merely a matter\nof vividness, and that the latter can become as vivid as the former\nand thereby undermine any use of vividness as a criterion of\nexternality (1713 [1909: 19\u201320]), could have been known to Hume\nand influenced his formulation of the distinction between impressions\nand ideas in his Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340). So\nat this point we can turn to Hume.\n\nWhether or not David Hume (1711\u20131776) learned from Collier, he\nlearned a great deal from Berkeley, above all his empiricist\nepistemology, but for the most part he tried to avoid Berkeley\u2019s\noutright commitment to idealism. Hume\u2019s view that our knowledge\nconsists of our ideas, our recognition of \u201cphilosophical\u201d\nrelations among them, such as identity and difference, and our\nrecognition of \u201cnatural\u201d relations among them such as\ncausation, which are established by imagination and custom, could\nconstitute an epistemological ground for idealism\u2014causality, in\nparticular, which Hume regards as the basis of all our knowledge of\nexistence, is at the same time reduced to a way of feeling and\nthinking, in other words a state of mind. But depending on how he is\nread, Hume either accepts the skepticism about possible external\nobjects that Berkeley tries to avoid with his ontology that renders\nany external objects other than other human or divine minds\nimpossible, or else holds that even if there are valid arguments for\nskepticism it is psychologically impossible for human beings to remain\nin a skeptical frame of mind, thus we naturally even if not rationally\nbelieve in the existence of objects apart from our ideas of them.\nHowever, in those passages, prominently in Book I, Part IV of his\nearly Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340), where Hume\nentertains a kind of monism that sees both \u201cminds\u201d and\n\u201cobjects\u201d as nothing but different sets or\n\u201cbundles\u201d of one sort of thing, namely, perceptions,\nimpressions and their paler copies, ideas, his position might seem\nmuch like Berkeley\u2019s idealism, with the difference that while he\nreduces all reality to mental states like impressions and ideas he\ndoes not see these as properties that must inhere in substantial minds\nany more than in substantial bodies, both of which are fictions that\nwe introduce in order to explain continuities among those impressions\nor ideas (although it may be difficult to explain who is introducing\nthose fictions without resorting to substantial minds after all).\n\nHume\u2019s potentially idealist approach to causation is clearly on\nview in his 1748 Enquiry concerning Human Knowledge, which\nwas quickly translated into German and would eventually provide Kant\nwith the stimulus for his own aprioristic rather than empiricist\nargument for idealism with regard not only to causation but to all of\nwhat he called the categories of pure reason, including especially\nsubstance and interaction as well as causation. But since Kant was not\nfamiliar with the contents of Hume\u2019s earlier Treatise of\nHuman Nature, he did not know that Hume too had generalized his\napproach to causality to the cases of mind and body, nor did he know\nthat Hume may have tried to sidestep Berkeley\u2019s commitment to\nsubstances but not his idealism altogether by his theory of both minds\nand bodies as bundles of perceptions. Kant would try to avert\nBerkeley\u2019s version of idealism by a different stratagem, but\nbefore we come to that we must consider Hume\u2019s position more\nfully. Hume accepted from Locke and Descartes before him that the\nimmediate objects of consciousness are what they had called ideas,\nalthough he reserves that word for copies or subsequently recalled\nperceptions rather than the originally experienced perceptions that he\ncalls impressions. He also adopts the view of his predecessors that\nknowledge lies in the recognition of relations among impressions,\nideas, or both, and divides those relations into two kinds,\nphilosophical and natural. Philosophical relations are those\nimmediately evident on reflection on or comparison of particular\nideas, and include resemblance, identity, spatial and temporal\nrelations such as above and below or before and after, number and\ndegree, and logical contrariety (Hume 1739\u201340: I.I.5), while\nnatural relations are those that are not immediately evident on\nreflection on a single impression or idea or in a single comparison of\nany number, but which instead become evident, or more properly are\nformed, only through repeated experience. Hume\u2019s best known\nargument is then that causation is not a philosophical but a natural\nrelation: the causal relation is comprised by temporal succession,\nspatial contiguity, and necessary connection, and while the first two\nare philosophical relations that are immediately apparent, the\nnecessary connection between different ideas\u2014those of a cause\nand its separate effect\u2014is, unlike the necessary identity of two\nqualitatively similar ideas, not immediately apparent, as Hume puts\nit, to reason (1739\u201340: I.III.2), but instead grows only out of\nrepeated experience, the repeated experience of qualitatively similar\npairs of impressions which causes them to become linked in the mind,\nas we would ordinarily say, or at least in consciousness, as the\ncareful Hume should say at most (1739\u201340: I.III.6). In fact,\nHume\u2019s argument is that repeated experience itself has two\neffects: it creates a habit of thought such that upon the presentation\nof an impression of one kind that has repeatedly been experienced in\nspatial and temporal conjunction with one of another kind, a vivid\nversion of the idea of the kind of impression with which the first\nkind of impression has been repeatedly associated immediately\noccurs\u2014this is the essence of causal inference or belief,\nbecause a belief is nothing but an idea that is almost as vivid and\nforceful as the impression of which it was once a copy (1739\u201340:\nI.III.7\u20138; this is the thought Hume could have learned from\nArthur Collier)\u2014and further, there is an actual feeling of the\nmind (as we would ordinarily say) being tugged from the one impression\nto the other idea\u2014this is the basis of the idea of necessary\nconnection, a connection which the mind then \u201cspreads\u201d\nupon its objects to form the idea of a necessary connection among them\nor their states (1739\u201340: I.III.14).\n\nHume\u2019s theory of causation points toward idealism by relocating\nthe relation of causation from the external objects where we would\nordinarily suppose it to obtain to the mind, which we would ordinarily\nsuppose knows but does not constitute the relation known. In\nHume\u2019s words,\n\n\nTho\u2019 the several resembling instances, which give rise to the\nidea of power, have no influence on each other, and can never produce\nany new quality in the object, which can be a model of that\nidea [of power or causation], yet the observation of this\nresemblance produces a new impression in the mind, which is\nits real model\u2026. Necessity, then, is the effect of this\nobservation, and is nothing but an internal impression of the mind, or\na determination to carry our thoughts from one object to another.\n(1739\u201340: I.III.14, para. 20)\n\n\nSeveral things may be noted about this theory. For one, if it had been\nHume\u2019s intent to raise a general skepticism about causation,\nbased on the famous worry about induction that he himself raises,\nespecially in the subsequent Enquiry, namely that an\nassertion of causality claims that future impressions will occur in\nthe same patterns as past ones but there is no basis \u201cin\nreason\u201d for assuming that the future will resemble the past,\nthen the relocation of causation from the domain of objects to the\ndomain of the mind should make no difference, because we have no more\nreason to believe that the mind will behave the same way in the future\nas it has in the past than we do to believe that about anything else.\nSo we must either believe that Hume is very confused, not realizing\nthat his skepticism about induction as applied to external objects\nmust undermine our confidence in his application of induction to the\nmind itself, or else that he is very arch, and that he means us to do\nhis skeptical work for him by carrying over skepticism about induction\nto the case of the mind itself, or else that he is not really worrying\nabout issues of justification and thus of the threat of skepticism at\nall, but just means to be giving a plausible description of\nthe only possible basis for causal inference, namely the mind\u2019s\nexperience of itself. The last possibility may well seem to be the\nmost plausible, leading to the \u201cnaturalist\u201d reading of\nHume promoted by Norman Kemp Smith, Barry Stroud, and Don Garrett\nrather than the \u201cskeptical\u201d reading of Hume accepted by\nHume\u2019s contemporaries such as James Beattie and Thomas Reid and\ndefended recently and more skillfully by Robert Fogelin.\n\nThere is a further issue with Hume\u2019s treatment of causation that\nis largely suppressed in the Enquiry but that was evident in\nthe Treatise, namely, that although, as we saw in the last\npassage quoted, Hume sometimes describes necessary connection as being\ndisplaced from the object to the mind, on his own\nstrict interpretation of empiricism there is a problem in positing the\nexistence of either objects or minds distinct from perceptions. This\nis what pushes Hume towards his own form of idealism. That is,\nalthough we naturally speak of perceptions as being of\nobjects and in or by the mind, on the view that all\nknowledge is founded on perception and that in perception we are\nimmediately acquainted with nothing but perceptions, it becomes\nproblematic how we could have knowledge either of the mind itself or\nof any object of perceptions distinct from those perceptions. Hume\nputs the former point succinctly by arguing that we have no perception\nof the self distinct from our perception of its perceptual states:\n\n\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call\nmyself, I always stumble on some particular perception or\nother, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or\npleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a\nperception, and never can observe any thing but the perception.\n(1739\u201340: I.IV.6.3)\n\n\nHe then argues that in fact the self is\n\n\nnothing but a bundle of different perceptions, which succeed each\nother with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and\nmovement. (1739\u201340: I.IV.6.4)\n\n\nand that the idea of a continuous self is but a fiction or illusion\ncreated by relations of resemblance and continuity among perceptions\nin the bundle, just as both the idea of and belief in causal\nconnection were created by repetition of pairs of impressions. Without\nsaying that the objects of perception are also nothing but bundles of\nrelated perceptions, Hume presents a similar account of how the idea\nof objects distinct from our perceptions of them is generated by our\nimpression of continuity among perceptions: although only philosophers\nreflect on this, in fact we know that perceptions are fleeting and\ntransitory; we mistake continuity among them for enduring identity;\nand we then invent something other than perceptions, something not\nfleeting and transitory, to which to ascribe that enduring identity\n(1739\u201340: I.IV.2). In neither case, however, do we actually have\na clear idea of any object or substance distinct from our perceptions:\nwe do not have such an idea of external objects or their substance,\nbut neither do we have a clear idea of the mind or its substance. The\nonly ideas we have are copies of our impressions, or perceptions.\n\nHume\u2019s attack on the supposition that we have an idea of the\nmind as distinct from its impressions thus constitutes a rejection of\nBerkeley\u2019s commitment to the existence of mental substances, but\nnot of idealism altogether. On Hume\u2019s account, we are not\nentitled to assert the existence of both ideas and the minds, human or\ndivine, that have them, but only the existence of the former. At the\nsame time, he does not seem to think that we are forced into\nskepticism about either minds or external objects by his approach,\nthat is, into a position that there may really be minds and external\nobjects but we cannot know that fact or their real qualities; yet he\nstill has a lingering worry that although there are psychological\nmechanisms leading us to form the fictions of minds and bodies beyond\nperceptions, we do not really know what we are talking about when we\ntalk about such things, and thus cannot even coherently doubt whether\nwe have knowledge of them\u2014our talk about them is explicable but\nmeaningless. Hume thus seems to end up with an uneasy compromise\nbetween idealism and agnosticism.\n",
