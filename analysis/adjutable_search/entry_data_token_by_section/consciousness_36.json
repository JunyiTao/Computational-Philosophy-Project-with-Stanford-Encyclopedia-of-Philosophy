    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Representationalist theories\n9.3 Representationalist theories\n\n\nAlmost all theories of consciousness regard it as having\nrepresentational features, but so called representationalist theories\nare defined by the stronger view that its representational features\nexhaust its mental features (Harman 1990, Tye 1995, 2000). According to\nthe representationalist, conscious mental states have no mental\nproperties other than their representational properties. Thus two\nconscious or experiential states that share all their representational\nproperties will not differ in any mental respect.\n\n\nThe exact force of the claim depends on how one interprets the idea\nof being \u201crepresentationally the same\u201d for which there are\nmany plausible alternative criteria. One could define it coarsely in\nterms of satisfaction or truth conditions, but understood in that way\nthe representationalist thesis seems clearly false. There are too many\nways in which states might share their satisfaction or truth conditions\nyet differ mentally, including those that concern their mode of\nconceptualizing or presenting those conditions.\n\n\nAt the opposite extreme, one could count two states as\nrepresentationally distinct if they differed in any features that\nplayed a role in their representational function or operation. On such\na liberal reading any differences in the bearers of content would count\nas representational differences even if they bore the same intentional\nor representational content; they might differ only in their\nmeans or mode of representation not their\ncontent.\n\n\nSuch a reading would of course increase the plausibility of the\nclaim that a conscious state's representational properties exhaust its\nmental properties but at the cost of significantly weakening or even\ntrivializing the thesis. Thus the representationalist seems to need an\ninterpretation of representational sameness that goes beyond\nmere satisfaction conditions and reflects all the intentional or\ncontentful aspects of representation without being sensitive to mere\ndifferences in underlying non-contentful features of the processes at\nthe realization level. Thus most representationalists provide conditions\nfor conscious experience that include both a content condition plus\nsome further causal role or format requirements (Tye 1995, Dretske\n1995, Carruthers 2000). Other representationalists accept the existence\nof qualia but treat them as objective properties that external objects\nare represented as having, i.e., they treat them as\nrepresented properties rather than as properties\nof representations or mental states (Dretske 1995, Lycan\n1996).\n\n\nRepresentationalism can be understood as a qualified form of\neliminativism insofar as it denies the existence of properties of a\nsort that conscious mental states are commonly thought to \nhave\u2014or at least seem to have\u2014namely those that are mental but not\nrepresentational. Qualia, at least if understood as intrinsic monadic\nproperties of conscious states accessible to introspection, would seem\nto be the most obvious targets for such elimination. Indeed part of the\nmotivation for representationalism is to show that one can accommodate\nall the facts about consciousness, perhaps within a physicalist\nframework, without needing to find room for qualia or any other\napparently non-representational mental properties (Dennett 1990, Lycan\n1996, Carruthers 2000).\n\n\nRepresentationalism has been quite popular in recent years and had\nmany defenders, but it remains highly controversial and intuitions\nclash about key cases and thought experiments (Block 1996). In\nparticular the possibility of inverted qualia provides a crucial test\ncase. To anti-representationalists, the mere logical possibility of\ninverted qualia shows that conscious states can differ in a significant\nmental respect while coinciding representationally.\nRepresentationalists in reply deny either the possibility of such\ninversion or its alleged import (Dretske 1995, Tye 2000).\n\n\nMany other arguments have been made for and against\nrepresentationalism, such as those concerning perceptions in different\nsense modalities of one and the same state of affairs\u2014seeing\nand feeling the same cube\u2014which might seem to involve mental\ndifferences distinct from how the relevant states represent the world\nto be (Peacocke 1983, Tye 2003). In each case, both sides can muster\nstrong intuitions and argumentative ingenuity. Lively debate\ncontinues.\n",
