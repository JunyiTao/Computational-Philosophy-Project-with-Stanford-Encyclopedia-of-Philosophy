    "main_text": "The Primacy of the Aesthetic\n2. The Primacy of the Aesthetic\n\nPhilosophers since Kant customarily distinguish intuitions or\nrepresentations from concepts or universals. In one sense Croce\nfollows this tradition, but another sense his view departs radically.\nFor intuitions are not blind without concepts; an intuitive\npresentation (an \u2018intuition\u2019) is a complete conscious\nmanifestation just as it is, in advance of applying concepts (and all\nthat is true a priori of them is that they have a particular\ncharacter or individual physiognomy\u2014they are not necessarily\nspatial or temporal, contra Kant). To account for this, Croce\nsupposes that the modes of mental activity are in turn arranged at\ndifferent levels. The intellect presupposes the intuitive\nmode\u2014which just is the aesthetic\u2014but the intuitive mode\ndoes not presuppose the intellect. The intellect\u2014issuing in\nparticular judgements\u2014in turn is presupposed by the practical,\nwhich issues among other things in empirical laws. And morality tells\nthe practical sciences what ends in particular they should pursue.\nThus Croce regarded this as one of his key insights: All mental\nactivity, which means the whole of reality, is founded on the\naesthetic, which has no end or purpose of its own, and of course no\nconcepts or judgements. This includes the concept of existence or\nreality: the intuition plus the judgement of existence is what Croce\ncalls perception, but itself is innocent of it.\n\nTo say the world is essentially history is to say that at the lowest\nlevel it is aesthetic experiences woven into a single fabric, a\nworld-narrative, with the added judgement that it is real, that it\nexists. Croce takes this to be inevitable: the subjective present is\nreal and has duration; but any attempt to determine its exact size is\nsurely arbitrary. Therefore the only rigorous view is that the past is\nno less real than the present. History then represents, by definition,\nthe only all-encompassing account of reality. What we call the natural\nsciences then are impure, second-rate. Consider for example the\nconcept of a space-time point. Plainly it is not something\nanyone has ever met with in experience; it is an abstraction,\npostulated as a limit of certain operations for the convenience of a\n\u2018theory\u2019. Croce would call it a pseudo-concept, and would\nnot call the so-called \u2018empirical laws\u2019 in which it\nfigures to be fit subjects for truth and knowledge. Its significance,\nlike that of other pseudo-concepts, is pragmatic.\n\nIn fact the vast majority of concepts\u2014house, reptile,\ntree\u2014are mere adventitious collections of things that are\nformulated in response to practical needs, and thus cannot, however\nexact the results of the corresponding science, attain to truth or\nknowledge. Nor do the concepts of mathematics escape the\n\u2018pseudo\u2019 tag. What Croce calls pure concepts, in contrast,\nare characterised by their possession of expressiveness, universality\nand concreteness, and they perform their office by a priori\nsynthesis (this accounts for character mentioned above). What\nthis means it that everything we can perceive or imagine\u2014every\nrepresentation or intuition\u2014will necessarily have all three:\nthere is no possible experience that is not of something concrete,\nuniversal in the sense of being an instance of something absolutely\ngeneral, and expressive, that is, admitting of verbal enunciation.\nEmpirical concepts, then, like heat, are concrete but not\nuniversal; mathematical concepts, like number, are universal\nbut not concrete. Examples of pure concepts are rare, but those\nrecognized by Croce are finality, quality and\nbeauty. Such is the domain of Logic, in Croce\u2019s\nscheme.\n\nA critical difference, for our purposes, between Croce\u2019s ideas\nand those of his apparent follower Collingwood, emerges when we ask:\nwhat are the constituents of the intuition? For\nCollingwood\u2014writing in the mid-1930s\u2014intuitions are built\nup out of sense-data, the only significant elaboration of\nRussell\u2019s doctrine being that sense-data are never simple,\ncomprising what analysis reveals as sensory and affective\nconstituents. For Croce the intuition is an organic whole, such that\nto analyze it into atoms is always a false abstraction: the intuition\ncould never be re-built with such elements. (Although a deadly\nopponent of formal logic, Croce did share Frege\u2019s insight that\nthe truly meaningful bit of language is the sentence; \u2018only in\nthe context of sentence does a word have a meaning\u2019, wrote Frege\nin 1884).\n",
