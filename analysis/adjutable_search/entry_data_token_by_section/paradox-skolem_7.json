    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues\n3. Philosophical Issues\n\n\nThe last section explained why Skolem's Paradox does not constitute\na problem for mathematics. This, of course, has not kept philosophers\nfrom arguing that the paradox does constitute a problem for\nphilosophy. In this section, we explore several attempts to derive\nphilosophical conclusions from the mathematics surrounding Skolem's\nParadox. Before doing so, however, two cautionary notes are in order.\nFirst, many of the more provocative discussions of Skolem's Paradox are\nquite brief\u2014amounting to little more than suggestive comments\nmade in passing. Hence, much of the discussion of these comments will\nhave to be somewhat conjectural. Second, many critical discussions of\nSkolem's Paradox have focused simply on working carefully through the\nparadox's mathematics and then explaining why the paradox doesn't\nconstitute a genuine mathematical contradiction. Since this material\nwas already covered in section 2, we won't say any more about these\nissues in this section.\n",
