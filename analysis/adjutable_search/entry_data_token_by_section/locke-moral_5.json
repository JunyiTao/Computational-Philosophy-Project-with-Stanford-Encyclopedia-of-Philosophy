    "main_text": "Locke\u2019s natural law theory: the basis of moral obligation || Morality as a deductive science\n2.3 Morality as a deductive science\n\nThere are two baseline assumptions of Locke\u2019s moral thinking: morality\nis universal and it is something that can be understood clearly and\nunequivocally by human reason\u2014when Locke imagines us\nrationally-discovering natural law, he envisions us applying a\nrigorous set of logical principles to a set of clear and well-defined\nideas about human nature, God, and society. But, how exactly is this\ndone?\n\nFor one thing, this process looks a great deal like mathematical\nreasoning. For Locke, moral rules are founded on a fundamental set of\nprinciples, much like mathematical axioms. The fundamental principles\ncan be deduced rationally, and it is from these that we can further\nderive all of our moral duties. Morality is, therefore, demonstrable,\na term indicating mathematical-style proofs wherein conclusions are\nderived from axiomatic foundations. The moral status of any action is\nthen determined by comparing our behaviour against these demonstrated\nrules. But, we might ask, what kinds of ideas are moral\nideas, and what sort of rationalist could Locke possibly be? Locke is\na well-known empiricist; for Locke, the mind is a blank slate, the\ncontent of which is supplied exclusively from sensory or reflective\nexperience. Locke famously espouses this empiricist view in the\nEssay, but holds it quite clearly also in the Essays on\nthe Law of Nature. In fact, however, Locke\u2019s moral\nrationalism takes this empiricist theory of ideas as its starting\npoint. Moral ideas, for Locke, are fundamentally experiential in\norigin. They are not directly so, of course, since we do not perceive\nsomething like justice or honesty directly. Moral ideas are\nexperiential, in the special Lockean sense that they are complex\nideas\u2014products of the mind\u2019s ability to form complex\nconstructions from its simple directly-experiential contents. For\nLocke, the interplay of reason and sensation works as follows:\n\nreason is \u2026 taken to mean the discursive faculty of the mind,\nwhich advances from things known to things unknown and argues from one\nthing to another in a definite and fixed order of propositions\u2026\nThe foundations, however, on which rests the whole of that knowledge\nwhich reason builds \u2026 are the objects of sense-experience; for\nthe senses primarily supply the entire as well as the chief\nsubject-matter of discourse and introduce it into the deep recesses of\nthe mind. (Locke 1663\u201364, 101)\n\n\nFrom perceptual simple ideas, we can generate complex moral\npropositions. This seems like a tall order, and Locke offers very\nlittle, in any of his works, by way of actually putting this moral\nreasoning process to work. However, that is not to say that Locke is\nsilent in this regard. There are places in his writings where Locke\ntakes us through some moral demonstrations.\n\nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, for example, Locke claims\nthat, based on sensory experience, we can assert the extra-mental\nexistence of perceptible objects and all their perceptible qualities.\nAll such qualities can be explained by reference to matter in motion.\nWhat is also clear to the senses, Locke argues, is that this world of\nmoving objects exhibits a nomological regularity, or as Locke puts it,\na \u201cwonderful art and regularity\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364,\n103). Such regularity and beauty leads the contemplative mind to\nconsider how such a world could have come about. Such contemplation\nwould lead any rational being to the conclusion that the world cannot\nbe the result of chance, and must therefore be the product of a\ncreative will. Note that Locke is here trying to demonstrate for us\njust how sensation and reason work together. The mind moves from ideas\nof sensation to what Locke considers logical conclusions regarding the\ncreative force behind the world we experience. But, our understanding\nof natural law is not founded solely in sensory experience. Through\nreflection, which is an introspective kind of perceptual experience\nfor Locke, humans can gain ideas of our own nature and faculties that\nserve to complete our understanding both of God and of God\u2019s creative\nwill. This reasoning goes as follows\u2014the creative being, which\nsensation indicates must exist, cannot be less perfect than\nhuman will, nor can it be human, because our ideas of\nreflection tell us that humans are not, and cannot be, self-causing.\nReason must conclude, then, that the world is created by a divine\nwill\u2014a superior power, which can bring us into existence,\nmaintain us, or take us away, give us great joy or render us in great\npain. Locke concludes as follows:\n\nwith sense-perception showing the way, reason can lead us to knowledge\nof a lawmaker or of some superior power to which we are necessarily\nsubject. (Locke 1663\u20134, 104)\n\n\nFrom this deduction regarding divine purpose and authority, humans can\nconclude that they are obligated to render \u201cpraise, honour, and\nglory\u201d to God. Beyond this, the rational agent can deduce,\nthrough reflection upon her own constitution and faculties, that her\nnatural impulses to protect and preserve her life, and to enter into\nsociety with others are faculties with which she has been uniquely\nequipped by God and by which she is considered specifically human.\nThese must constitute the basis of the principles and duties governing\nher conduct\u2014her \u201cfunction appears to be that which nature\nhas prepared \u2026 [her] to perform\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364,\n105). Thus, by a series of steps from perception to reasoning about\nthat perceptual experience, we are, Locke concludes, able to define\nour moral duties and regulate our conduct accordingly.\n\nIn the Essay, Locke develops this idea of the rational\ndeduction of natural law somewhat further, setting it in the context\nof a more mature and coherent theory of ideas than we find in the\nEssays on the Law of Nature. In the Essay, moral\nideas assume a particular significance owing to their place in Locke\u2019s\ngeneral taxonomy of ideas. For Locke, all the basic contents of the\nmind are simple ideas. These are formed by the mind into what Locke\nterms complex ideas, which are combinations of simple ideas made in\nthe pattern of our perceptions of things in the extra mental world, or\naccording to a pattern created by reason alone. Moral ideas fall into\nthe second category of complex idea, falling under the technical\nheading complex ideas of modes. Modes are a specific kind of\ncomplex ideas, created by the mind from simple ideas of sensation or\nreflection, but referring to no extra-mental reality. They are not\nintended as natural kinds, but are products of the mind alone,\nreferring to purely conceptual archetypes. They are best understood in\ncontradistinction to ideas of substances, which are created by the\nmind but aim to mirror the real essences of extra-mental\nthings\u2014for example, the idea cat is intended to capture\na kind of thing in the world that has a specific set of perceivable\ncharacteristics. Ideas of substances fail in mirroring reality,\nhowever, as they can never be complete representations of the world\noutside the mind. Modal ideas, on the other hand, are a special kind\nof idea for Locke, and actually hold out the promise for real\nknowledge. Modal ideas are ideas by which we fully grasp the real\nessence of things, because the mind, in some sense, is the originator\nof them (I will return to this in the next paragraph). The idea of a\ntriangle is a modal idea, made by reason and knowable in its essence\nwith complete accuracy. The idea of a triangle is a product of the\nmind, and does not refer to anything outside the mind\u2014i.e., any\nexternal archetype. The kinds of ideas that fall into this category\nare the idea of God, mathematical concepts, and, most importantly for\nour present purposes, moral concepts. Locke writes, \n\nI am bold to think, that Morality is capable of\nDemonstration, as well as Mathematicks: since the precise real\nEssence of the things moral Words stand for, may be perfectly known;\nand so the Congruity, or Incongruity of the Things themselves, be\ncertainly discovered, in which consists perfect knowledge.\n(Essay, 3.11.16)\n\n\nMoral rules, for Locke, are knowable with the same degree of certainty\nas \u201cany Demonstration in Euclid\u201d (Essay,\n4.3.18).\n\nThis might seem to be a tall order when considering the controversy\ngenerated by beliefs about moral rules, yet Locke clearly believes\nthat moral rules can, with the right mental effort, yield indisputable\nuniversal laws. Locke offers an example of how this might work, by\nanalyzing the moral proposition Where there is no property, there\nis no injustice. In order to see the demonstrable certainty of\nthis claim, we have to examine the composite ideas and how those agree\nor disagree with one another. The idea of property, first of all, is a\nright to something. The idea of injustice, considered next, is a\nviolation of that right. Given these definitions, which Locke thinks\nare arrived at by careful attention to definition, it is a rational\ndeduction that injustice cannot exist if there is no property to be\nviolated. Injustice and property must, by definition agree. This is a\nclearly demonstrable rule, according to Locke, deduced from clear and\nadequately conceived ideas. The only other example Locke offers is the\nproposition No Government allows absolute Liberty.\nGovernment, according to Locke, is the establishment of society upon\ncertain laws, requiring conformity. Absolute liberty is allowing\nanyone to do as they please. These are modal ideas, according to\nLocke, and thus known with complete adequacy. As such, it is possible\nfor the rational individual to see clearly that the ideas of absolute\nliberty and government cannot agree. Of course, most people will argue\nthat these rational deductions rely upon definitions that are\ndebatable. This would not seem to be helped by the fact that, for\nLocke, modal ideas, like all complex ideas, are put together by the\nmind; while complex ideas of substance are constructed on the pattern\nof perceivable objects, modal ideas are, Locke explains, \u201cput\ntogether at the pleasure of our Thoughts, without any real pattern\nthey were taken from\u201d (Essay, 4.4.12). This might seem\nto pose a problem for Locke\u2019s moral theory, according to which moral\nlaws are just as necessary as mathematical principles. However, Locke\nis not worried about any relativistic implications. For Locke, any\ndisagreement about definitions of concepts like property, justice or\nmurder, result from insufficient reasoning about the simple ideas that\ncomprise our moral ideas, as well as bias, prejudice and other\nirrational influences. For Locke, it is precisely because these ideas\nrefer to nothing outside the mind that they can be\nuniversally-conceived and adequately understood. Just as the notion of\ntriangularity is known perfectly because it does not depend upon the\nexistence of triangles outside the mind, so justice is understood\nperfectly because it is not using some extramental archetype as its\ninspiration. He writes,\n\nthe Truth and Certainty of moral Discourses abstracts from\nthe Lives of Men, and the Existence of those Vertues in the World\nwhereof they treat. (Essay, 4.4.8)\n\n\nMathematical concepts are impervious to bias, prejudice or\notherwise-idiosyncratic definitions and their relative properties are\nclear to anyone who understands them perfectly. While many would\ncontend that moral ideas are simply too controversial to fit a\nproto-mathematical picture, Locke would respond that they seem\ncontroversial only because many of us have not taken the time to\nconsider moral ideas in an objective and analytical light. If we were\nto do so, he argues, we could come to know moral rules with\ncertainty.\n\nLocke, in fact, adds something of a meta-moral dimension to this\nepistemological point by suggesting that as rational beings it is our\n\u201cproper Imployment\u201d to contemplate morality. In Book IV of\nthe Essay, where Locke concludes that morality is, like\nmathematics, a human science (and, properly-speaking, knowledge),\nLocke draws a teleological lesson\u2014since we are clearly fitted\nwith the capacity for discerning our moral duty, then that is what we\nought to do: \u201cI think I may conclude, that Morality is\nthe proper Science and Business of Mankind in general.\u201d\n(Essay, 4.12.11) Humans must, he argues, employ reason in the\npursuit of that which \u201cthey are most adapted to, and follow the\ndirection of Nature, where it seems to point us out the way\u201d\n(Essay, 4.12.11). The fact that many people do not or cannot\ndevote contemplative hours to their moral duties is something Locke\nwill consider in his account of moral motivation, however, the key\npoint here is that humans have a teleological makeup that allows for\nrational certainty with regard to divine moral law.\n\nIs having this degree of knowledge enough to motivate humans to act\naccordingly\u2014that is, does the sheer recognition of one\u2019s duty\nhave any sway in one\u2019s practical deliberations?\n",
