If such non-exotic explanations are available, intentionalist\nexplanations seem unwarranted and unnecessary.\n\nSince the central paradoxes of self-deception arise from modeling\nself-deception on intentional interpersonal deception,\nnon-intentionalists suggest this model be jettisoned in favor of one\nthat takes \u2018to be deceived\u2019 to be nothing more than\nbelieving falsely or being mistaken in believing something (Johnston\n1988; Mele 2001). For instance, Sam mishears that it will be a sunny\nday and relays this misinformation to Joan with the result that she\nbelieves it will be a sunny day. Joan is deceived into believing it\nwill be sunny, and Sam has deceived her, albeit unintentionally.\nInitially, such a model may not appear promising for self-deception\nsince simply being mistaken about p or accidentally causing\noneself to be mistaken about p doesn\u2019t seem to be\nself-deception at all but some sort of innocent error.\nNon-intentionalists, however, argue that in cases of self-deception,\nthe false belief is not accidental but, rather, motivated by desire\n(Mele 2001), emotion (Lazar 1999), anxiety (Johnston 1988; Barnes\n1997), or some other attitude regarding p or related to\np. So, for instance, when Allison believes, against the\npreponderance of evidence available to her, that her daughter is not\nhaving learning difficulties, non-intentionalists will explain the\nvarious ways she misreads the evidence by pointing to such things as\nher desire that her daughter not have learning difficulties, her fear\nthat she has such difficulties, or anxiety over this possibility. In\nsuch cases, Allison\u2019s self-deceptive belief that her daughter is\nnot having learning difficulties fulfills her desire, quells her fear,\nor reduces her anxiety, and it\u2019s this function\u2014not an\nintention\u2014that explains why her belief formation process is\nbiased. Allison\u2019s false belief is not an innocent mistake but a\nconsequence of her motivational states.\n\nNon-intentionalists divide over the dual-belief requirement. Some\naccept the requirement, seeing the persistent efforts to resist the\nconscious recognition of the unwelcome truth or to reduce the anxiety\ngenerated by this recognition as characteristic of self-deception\n(Bach 1981; Johnston 1988). So, in Allison\u2019s case, her belief\nthat her daughter is having learning difficulties, along with her\ndesire that this not be the case, motivates her to employ means to\navoid this thought and to believe the opposite.\n\nOthers, however, argue the needed motivation can as easily be supplied\nby uncertainty or ignorance whether p, or suspicion that\n~p (Mele 2001; Barnes 1997). Thus, Allison need not hold any\nopinion regarding her daughter\u2019s having learning difficulties\nfor her false belief to count as self-deception since it\u2019s her\nregarding evidence in a motivationally biased way in the face of\nevidence to the contrary, not her recognition of this evidence, that\nmakes her belief self-deceptive. Accordingly, Allison needn\u2019t\nintend to deceive herself nor believe at any point that her daughter,\nin fact, has learning difficulties. If we think someone like Allison\nis self-deceived, then self-deception requires neither contradictory\nbeliefs nor intentions regarding the acquisition or retention of the\nself-deceptive belief. Such approaches are \u2018deflationary\u2019\nin the sense that they take self-deception to be explicable without\nreaching for exotic cognitive architecture since neither intentions\nnor dual-beliefs are required to account for self-deception. (For more\non the dual-belief requirement, see\n \u00a73.2 Revision of Belief.)\n\nMele (2001, 2012) has offered the most fully articulated deflationary\naccount, and his view has been the target of the most scrutiny, so it\nis worth stating what he takes to be the jointly sufficient conditions\nfor entering self-deception:\n\nThe belief that p, which S acquires, is\nfalse\nS treats data relevant, or at least seemingly relevant,\nto the truth value of p in a motivationally biased way\nThis biased treatment is a nondeviant cause of S\u2019s\nacquiring the belief that p\nThe body of data possessed by S at the time provides\ngreater warrant for ~p than for p\nS consciously believes at the time that there is a\nsignificant chance that ~p\nS\u2019s acquiring the belief that p is a\nproduct of \u201creflective, critical reasoning,\u201d and\nS is wrong in regarding that reasoning as properly\ndirected\n\n\nMele (2012) added the last two conditions to clarify his account in\nview of some of the criticisms of this kind of approach addressed in\nthe next section.\n\nTo support non-intentionalism, some have looked to the purposive\nmechanisms of deception operating in non-human organisms as a model\n(Smith 2014), while others have focused on neurobiological mechanisms\ntriggered by affect to explain the peculiarly purposive responses to\nevidence involved in self-deception (Lauria et al. 2016).\nDeflationary Worries and Modifications\n\nCritics contend these deflationary accounts do not adequately\ndistinguish self-deception from other sorts of motivated believing\n(such as wishful thinking), nor can they explain the peculiar\nselectivity associated with self-deception, its characteristic\n\u2018tension,\u2019 the way it involves a failure of\nself-knowledge, or the agency of the self-deceiver.\n\nSelf-Deception and Wishful Thinking: What distinguishes\nwishful thinking from self-deception, according to intentionalists,\njust is that the latter is intentional while the former is not\n(Berm\u00fadez 2000). Specifically, wishful thinking does not seem\n\u2018deceptive\u2019 in the requisite sense. Non-intentionalists\nrespond that what distinguishes wishful thinking from self-deception\nis that self-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive\nbelief whereas wishful thinkers do not (Bach 1981; Johnston 1988) or\nthat they merely possess, without recognizing it, greater\ncounterevidence than wishful thinkers (Mele 2001). In either case,\nself-deceivers exert more agency than wishful thinkers over their\nbelief formation. In wishful thinking, motivation triggers a belief\nformation process in which the person does not play an active,\nconscious role, \u201cwhile in self-deception the subject is a\nwilling participant in directing cognition towards the doxastic\nembrace of the favored proposition\u201d (Scott-Kakures 2002; see\nalso Szabados 1973). While the precise relationship between wishful\nthinking and self-deception is clearly a matter of debate,\nnon-intentionalists offer plausible ways of distinguishing the two\nthat do not invoke the intention to deceive.\n\nSelf-Deception and Selectivity: Another worry\u2014termed\nthe \u2018selectivity problem\u2019\u2014originally raised by\nBerm\u00fadez (1997, 2000) is that deflationary accounts don\u2019t\nseem to be able to explain the selective nature of self-deception\n(i.e., why motivation seems only selectively to produce bias). Why is\nit, such intentionalists ask, that we are not rendered biased in favor\nof the belief that p in many cases where we have a very\nstrong desire that p (or anxiety or some other motivation\nrelated to p)? Intentionalists argue that an intention to get\noneself to acquire the belief that p offers the most\nstraightforward answer to this question.\n\nOthers, following Mele (2001, 2012, 2020), contend that selectivity\nmay be explained in terms of the agent\u2019s assessment of the\nrelative costs of erroneously believing that p or ~p\n(see Friedrich (1993) and Trope and Lieberman (1996) on lay hypothesis\ntesting). Essentially, this approach suggests that the minimization of\ncostly errors is the central principle guiding hypothesis testing. So,\nfor example, Josh would be happier believing falsely that the gourmet\nchocolate he finds so delicious isn\u2019t produced by exploited\nfarmers than falsely believing that it is since he desires that it not\nbe so produced. Because Josh considers the cost of erroneously\nbelieving his favorite chocolate is tainted by exploitation to be very\nhigh\u2014no other chocolate gives him the same pleasure\u2014it\ntakes a great deal more evidence to convince him that his chocolate is\nso tainted than it does to convince him otherwise. It\u2019s the low\nsubjective cost of falsely believing the chocolate is not tainted that\nfacilitates Josh\u2019s self-deception. But we can imagine Josh\nhaving the same strong desire that his chocolate not be tainted by\nexploitation and yet having a different assessment of the cost of\nfalsely believing it\u2019s not tainted. Say, for example, he works\nfor an organization promoting fair trade and non-exploitive labor\npractices among chocolate producers and believes he has an obligation\nto accurately represent the labor practices of the producer of his\nfavorite chocolate and would, furthermore, lose credibility if the\nchocolate he himself consumes is tainted by exploitation. In these\ncircumstances, Josh is more sensitive to evidence that his favorite\nchocolate is tainted\u2014despite his desire that it not\nbe\u2014since the subjective cost of being wrong is higher for him\nthan it was before. It is the relative, subjective costs of falsely\nbelieving p and ~p that explain why desire or other\nmotivation biases belief in some circumstances and not others.\n\nWhile error-cost accounts offer some explanation of selectivity, one\nmight still complain that even when these conditions are met,\nself-deception needn\u2019t follow (Berm\u00fadez 2000, 2017). Some\nnon-intentionalist respond that these conditions are as complete an\nexplanation of self-deception as is possible. Given the complexity of\nthe factors affecting belief formation and the lack of a complete\naccount of its etiology, we shouldn\u2019t expect a complete\nexplanation in each case (Funkhouser 2019; Mele 2020). Others argue\nthat attention to the role of emotion in assessing and filtering\nevidence sheds further light on the process. According to such\napproaches, affect plays a key role in triggering the conditions under\nwhich motivation leads to self-deception (Galeotti 2016a; Lauria\net al. 2016; Lauria and Preissmann 2018). Our\nemotionally-loaded appraisal of evidence, in combination with\nevidential ambiguity and our potential to cope with the threatening\nreality, helps to explain why motivation tips us toward\nself-deception. Research on the role of dopamine regulation and\nnegative somatic markers provides some empirical support for this sort\nof affective model (Lauria et al. 2016; Lauria and Preissmann\n2018).\n\nNon-intentionalists also point out that intentionalists have\nselectivity problems of their own since it isn\u2019t clear why\nintentions are formed in some cases rather than others (Jurjako 2013)\nor why some intentions to acquire a self-deceptive belief succeed\nwhile others do not (Mele 2001, 2020) See Berm\u00fadez (2017) for a\nresponse to these worries.\n\nSelf-Deception and Tension: A number of philosophers have\ncomplained that deflationary accounts fail to explain certain\n\u2018tensions\u2019 or conflicts supposed to be present in cases of\ngenuine self-deception (Audi 1997; Bach 1997; Nelkin 2002; Funkhouser\n2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Jordan 2022). Take Ellen, who says she is\ndoing well in her biology class but systematically avoids looking at\nthe results on her quizzes and tests. She says she doesn\u2019t need\nto look; she knows she didn\u2019t miss anything. When her teacher\ntries to catch her after class to discuss her poor grades, she rushes\noff. Similarly, when she sees an email from her teacher with the\nsubject line \u201cyour class performance,\u201d she ignores it. The\nprospect of looking at the test results, talking with her teacher, or\nreading her email sends a flash of dread through her and a pit to her\nstomach, even as she projects calm and confidence. Ellen\u2019s\nbehavior and affective responses suggest to these critics that she\nknows she isn\u2019t doing well in her biology class, despite her\navowals to the contrary. Ellen\u2019s case highlights a variety of\ntensions that may arise in the self-deceived. Philosophers have\nfocused on tensions that arise with respect to evidence (since there\nis a mismatch between what the evidence warrants and what is believed\nor avowed); to unconscious doxastic attitudes (since they are at\nvariance with those consciously held); to self-knowledge (since one\nhas a false second-order belief about what one believes); to the\nvarious components of belief\u2014behavioral, verbal, emotional,\nphysical\u2014(since what one does, says, feels, or experiences can\ncome apart in a number of ways) (Funkhouser 2019); and to authorship\n(since one may be aware of authoring her self-deception and presenting\nher self-deception to herself as not having been authored, i.e., as\nthe truth) (Jordan 2022). These tensions seem to be rooted in the\nself-deceiver\u2019s awareness of the truth. But, since deflationary\naccounts deny the dual-belief requirement, specifically, that\nself-deceivers must hold the true belief that ~p, it\u2019s\nnot clear why self-deceivers would experience tension or display\nbehaviors in conflict with their self-deceptive belief p.\n\nDeflationary theorists counter that suspicion that ~p,\nthinking there\u2019s a significant possibility that ~p, may\nsuffice to explain these kinds of tensions (Mele 2001, 2009, 2010,\n2012). Clearly, a person who self-deceptively believes that p\nand suspects that ~p may experience tension; moreover, such\nattitudes combined with a desire that p might account for the\nbehaviors highlighted by critics.\n\nWhile these attitudes may explain some of the tension in\nself-deception, a number of critics think they are inadequate to\nexplain deep-conflict cases in which what self-deceivers say about\np is seriously at odds with non-verbal behavior that\njustifies the attribution of the belief that ~p to them\n(Audi, 1997; Patten 2003; Funkhouser 2005; Gendler 2007;\nFern\u00e1ndez 2013). While some propose these cases are just a\ntype of self-deception that deflationary approaches cannot\nexplain (Funkhouser 2009, 2019; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013), others go\nfurther, suggesting these cases show that deflationary approaches\naren\u2019t accounts of self-deception at all but of\nself-delusion since deflationary self-deceivers seem\nsingle-mindedly to hold the false belief (Audi 2007; Funkhouser 2005;\nGendler 2007).\n\nSome defenders of deflation acknowledge that the significant\ndifference between what deflationary accounts have in view (namely,\npeople who do not believe the unwelcome truth that ~p, having\na motivation-driven, unwarranted skepticism toward it) and what\ndeep-conflict theorists do (namely, people who know the unwelcome\ntruth that ~p and avoid reflecting on it or encountering\nevidence for it) warrants questioning whether these phenomena belong\nto the same psychological kind, but argue that it\u2019s the\ndeep-conflict cases that represent something other than\nself-deception. Those who unconsciously hold the warranted belief and\nmerely say or pretend they hold the unwarranted one (Audi 1997;\nGendler 2007) hardly seem deceived (Lynch 2012). They seem more to\nresemble what Longeway (1990) calls escapism, the avoidance\nof thinking about what we believe to escape reality (See Lynch\n2012).\n\nFunkhouser (2019) suggests that this dispute over the depth of\nconflict and intensity of tension involved in self-deception is, in\npart, a dispute over which cases are central, typical, and most\ninteresting. Whether deep-conflict cases constitute a distinct\npsychological kind or whether they reflect people\u2019s\npre-theoretical understanding of self-deception remains unclear, but\ndeflationary approaches seem to be capable of explaining at least some\nof the behavior such theorists insist justifies attributing an\nunconscious belief that ~p. Deep-conflict theorists need to\nexplain why we should think when one avows that p, one does\nnot also believe it to some degree, and why the behavior in question\ncannot be explained by nearby proxies like suspicion or doubt that\np (Mele 2010, 2012). Some deflationary theorists contend that\na degree of belief model might render deep-conflict cases more\nsensible (see Shifting Degrees of Belief).\n\nSelf-Deception and Self-Knowledge: Several theorists have\nargued that deflationary approaches miss certain failures of\nself-knowledge involved in cases of self-deception. Self-deceivers,\nthese critics argue, must hold false beliefs about their own belief\nformation process (Holton 2001; Scott-Kakures 2002), about what\nbeliefs they actually hold (Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013),\nor both. Holton (2001), for instance, argues that Mele\u2019s\nconditions for being self-deceived are not sufficient because they do\nnot require self-deceivers to hold false beliefs about themselves. It\nseems possible for a person to acquire a false belief that p\nas a consequence of treating data relevant to p in a\nmotivationally biased way when the data available to her provides\ngreater warrant for p and still retain accurate\nself-knowledge. Such a person would readily admit to ignoring certain\ndata because it would undermine a belief she cherishes. She makes no\nmistakes about herself, her beliefs, or her belief formation process.\nSuch a person, Holton argues, would be willfully ignorant but\nnot self-deceived. If, however, her strategy was sufficiently opaque\nto her, she would be apt to deny she was ignoring relevant evidence\nand even affirm her belief was the result of what Scott-Kakures (2002)\ncalls \u201creflective, critical reasoning.\u201d These erroneous\nbeliefs represent a failure of self-knowledge that seems, according to\nthese critics, essential to self-deception, and they distinguish it\nfrom wishful thinking (see above), willful blindness, and other nearby\nphenomena.\n\nIn response to such criticisms, Mele (2009, 2012) has offered the\nfollowing sufficient condition: S\u2019s acquiring the\nbelief that p is a product of \u201creflective, critical\nreasoning,\u201d and S is wrong in regarding that reasoning as\nproperly directed. Some worry that meeting this condition requires a\ndegree of awareness about one\u2019s reasons for believing that would\nrule out those who do not engage in reflection on their reasons for\nbelief (Fern\u00e1ndez 2013) and fails to capture errors about what\none believes that seem essential for dealing with deep-conflict cases\n(Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Funkhouser 2005). Whether Mele\u2019s (2009)\nproposed condition requires too much sophistication from\nself-deceivers is debatable but suggests a way of accounting for the\nintuition that self-deceivers fail to know themselves without\nrequiring them to harbor hidden beliefs or intentions.\n\nSelf-Deception and Agency: Some worry that deflationary\nexplanations render self-deceivers victims of their own motivations;\nthey don\u2019t seem to be agents with respect to their\nself-deception but unwitting patients. But, in denying self-deceivers\nengage in intentional activities for the purpose of deceiving\nthemselves, non-intentionalists needn\u2019t deny self-deceivers\nengage in any intentional actions. It\u2019s open to them to accept\nwhat Lynch terms agentism: \u201cSelf-deceivers end up with\ntheir unwarranted belief as a result of their own actions motivated by\nthe desire that p\u201d (Lynch 2017). According to agentism,\nmotivation affects belief by means of intentional actions, not simply\nby triggering biasing mechanisms. Self-deceivers can act with\nintentions like \u201cfind any problem with unwelcome evidence\u201d\nor \u201cfind any p-supporting evidence\u201d with a view\nof determining whether p is true. These kinds of intentions\nmay explain the agency of self-deceivers and how they could be\nresponsible for self-deception and not merely victims of their own\nmotivations. It isn\u2019t perfectly clear whether Mele-style\ndeflationists are committed to agentism, but even if they are,\nquestions remain about whether such unwittingly deceptive intentional\nactions are enough to render self-deceivers true agents of their\ndeception since they think that they are engaging in actions to\ndetermine the truth, not to deceive themselves.\n",
