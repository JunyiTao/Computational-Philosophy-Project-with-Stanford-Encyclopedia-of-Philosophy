    "main_text": "Creative evolution\n5. Creative evolution\n\nFor Bergson, the notion of life mixes together two opposite senses,\nwhich must be differentiated and then led into a genuine unity. On the\none hand, it is clear from Bergson\u2019s earlier works that life is\nthe absolute temporal movement informed by duration and retained in\nmemory. But, on the other hand, he has shown that life also consists\nin the practical necessities imposed on our body and accounting for\nour habitual mode of knowing in spatial terms. More specifically then,\nBergson\u2019s project in Creative Evolution is to offer a\nphilosophy capable of accounting both for the continuity of all living\nbeings\u2014as creatures\u2014and for the discontinuity implied in\nthe evolutionary quality of this creation. Bergson starts out by\nshowing that the only way in which the two senses of life may be\nreconciled (without being collapsed) is to examine real life, the real\nevolution of the species, that is, the phenomenon of change and its\nprofound causes. His argument consists of four main steps. First, he\nshows that there must be an original common impulse which explains the\ncreation of all living species; this is his famous vital impulse\n(\u00e9lan vital). Second, the diversity resulting from evolution\nmust be accounted for as well. If the original impulse is common to\nall life, then there must also be a principle of divergence and\ndifferentiation that explains evolution; this is Bergson\u2019s\ntendency theory. Third, the two main diverging tendencies that account\nfor evolution can ultimately be identified as instinct on the one hand\nand intelligence on the other. Human knowledge results from the form\nand the structure of intelligence. We learned from \u201cThe\nIntroduction to Metaphysics\u201d that intelligence consists\nprecisely in an analytic, external, hence essentially practical and\nspatialized approach to the world. Unlike instinct, human intelligence\nis therefore unable to attain to the essence of life in its duration.\nThe paradoxical situation of humanity (the only species that wants to\nknow life is also the only one that cannot do so) must therefore be\novercome. So, fourth, the effort of intuition is what allows us to place\nourselves back within the original creative impulse so as to overcome\nthe numerous obstacles that stand in the way of true knowledge (which\nare instantiated in the history of metaphysics). We are going to look\nat each of these four steps.\n\nFirst, we are going to look at the concept of vital impulse. In\nCreative Evolution, Bergson starts out by criticizing\nmechanism as it applies to the concepts of life and evolution. The\nmechanistic approach would preclude the possibility of any real change\nor creativity, as each development would be potentially contained in\nthe preceding ones. However, Bergson continues, the teleological\napproach of traditional finalism equally makes genuine creation of the\nnew impossible, since it entails, just as mechanism, that the\n\u201cwhole is given.\u201d Therefore, neither mechanism nor strict\nfinalism can give a satisfying account of the phenomenon of change\nthat characterizes life. Nevertheless, Bergson argues, there is a\ncertain form of finalism that would adequately account for the\ncreation of life while allowing for the diversity resulting from\ncreation. It is the idea of an original vital principle. If there is a\ntelos to life, then, it must be situated at the origin and not at the\nend (contra traditional finalism), and it must embrace the whole of\nlife in one single indivisible embrace (contra mechanism). But, this\nhypothesis does not yet account for evolution in the diversity of its\nproducts, nor does it explain the principle of the nature of life.\n\nSecond, we turn to Bergson\u2019s account of the\n\u201ccomplexification\u201d of life, that is, the phenomenon of its\nevolution from the simple original vital impulse into different\nspecies, individuals, and organs. The successive series of\nbifurcations and differentiations that life undergoes organize itself\ninto two great opposite tendencies, namely, instinct and intelligence.\nBergson arrives at this fundamental distinction by considering the\ndifferent modes through which creatures act in and know the external\nworld. Animals are distinguished from plants on the basis of their\nmobility, necessitated by their need to find food,whereas plants\nsurvive and grow through photosynthesis, which does not require\nlocomotion. While the relationship between consciousness and matter\ninstantiated in the instinct of animals is sufficient and well adapted\nto their survival (from the point of view of the species), humans are\nnot adequately equipped in this respect; hence the necessity of\nsomething like intelligence, defined by the ability to make tools.\nHumanity is essentially homo faber. Once again, from the\npoint of view of real, concrete life that Bergson is here embracing,\nintelligence is essentially defined by its pragmatic orientation (and\nnot speculation, as a dogmatic intellectualist approach would assume).\nFrom this, Bergson deduces not only the cognitive structure and the\nscientific history of intelligence (which he examines in detail), but\nalso its limitations. This essentially pragmatic, hence analytic and\nquantitative orientation of intelligence precludes its immediate\naccess to the essentially qualitative nature of life. Notice that the\ndistinction between the two tendencies relies on the original\ndistinction between the qualitative and the quantitative\nmultiplicities. In any case, in order that human intelligence may\nattain true knowledge of the essence of the vital impulse, it will\nhave to proceed by means of a mode of knowing that lies at the\nopposite end of intelligence, namely, instinct.\n\nThroughout Creative Evolution, Bergson\u2019s crucial point\nis that life must be equated with creation, as creativity alone can\nadequately account for both the continuity of life and the\ndiscontinuity of the products of evolution. But now the question is:\nif humans only possess analytic intelligence, then how are we ever to\nknow the essence of life? Bergson\u2019s answer \u2014 his third\nstep \u2014 is that, because at the periphery of intelligence a\nfringe of instinct survives, we are able fundamentally to rejoin the\nessence of life. For, as the tendency and the multiplicity theories\nmade clear, instinct and intelligence are not simply self-contained\nand mutually exclusive states. They must be called tendencies\nprecisely because they are both rooted in, hence inseparable from, the\nduration that informs all life, all change, all becoming. There is,\ntherefore, a little bit of instinct surviving within each intelligent\nbeing, making it immediately \u2014 if only partially \u2014\ncoincide with the original vital impulse. This partial coincidence, as\nwe described above, is what founds intuition.\n\nFinally, we can return to the question of intuition. Thanks to\nintuition, humanity can turn intelligence against itself so as to\nseize life itself. By a very different route than the one we saw\nbefore, Bergson shows, once again, that our habitual way of knowing,\nbased in needs, is the only obstacle to knowledge of the absolute.\nHere he argues that this obstacle consists in the idea of disorder.\nAll theories of knowledge have in one way or another attempted to\nexplain meaning and consistency by assuming the contingency of order.\nThe traditional question, \u201cwhy is there order rather than\ndisorder?\u201d necessarily assumes that the human mind is able to\ncreate order mysteriously out of chaos. But, for Bergson, the real\nquestion is: \u201corder is certainly contingent, but in relation to\nwhat\u201d (Creative Evolution, p. 232)? His answer consists in\nshowing that it is not a matter of order versus disorder, but rather\nof one order in relation to another. According to Bergson, it is the\nsame reasoning that underlies the ideas of chance (as opposed to\nnecessity), and of nothingness (as opposed to existence). In a word,\nthe real is essentially positive. The real obeys a certain kind of\norganization, namely, that of the qualitative multiplicity. Structured\naround its needs and interests, our intelligence fails to recognize\nthis ultimate reality.\n\nHowever, a fringe of intuition remains, dormant most of the time yet\ncapable of awakening when certain vital interests are at stake. The\nrole of the philosopher is to seize those rare and discontinuous\nintuitions in order to support them, then dilate them and connect them\nto one another. In this process, philosophy realizes that intuition\ncoincides with spirit, and eventually with life itself. Intuition and\nintelligence thus each correspond to tendencies within the human\npsyche, which, as whole, thereby coincides immediately\n\u2014 if only partially \u2014 with the vital impulse. It is only\nby leaping into intuition that the ultimate unity of mental life\nappears, for, just as Bergson showed against Zeno, that mobility\ncannot be reconstructed out of immobility. Here he explains that while\none can go from intuition to intelligence by way of diminution, the\nanalytic nature of intelligence precludes the opposite process. Thus\nBergson concludes, \u201cphilosophy introduces us into spiritual\nlife. And at the same time, it shows us the relation of the life of\nspirit to the life of the body\u201d (Creative Evolution, p. 268). In\na word, it is life in its creativity which unifies the simplicity of\nspirit with the diversity of matter. And it is a certain kind of\nphilosophy, insofar as it is able to place itself back within the\ncreative impulse, which is capable of realizing the necessary\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d of the diverse, partial views\ninstantiated in the different branches of scientific knowledge and\nmetaphysical thought \u2014 so as to reestablish the absoluteness of\nknowledge, defined by its coincidence with absolute becoming.\n",
