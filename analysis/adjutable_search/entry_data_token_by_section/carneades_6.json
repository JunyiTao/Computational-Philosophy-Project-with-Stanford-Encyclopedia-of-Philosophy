    "main_text": "Other interests || Fate and Voluntary Action\n4.2 Theology\n\nTwo accounts of Carneades\u2019 sorites arguments against\nthe existence of the gods have come down to us, one in Sextus\nEmpiricus (M 9.182\u201390), one in Cicero\u2019s dialogue,\nthe De natura deorum (3.43\u201350).\n\nSorites arguments are fashioned by assembling as premises a sequence\nof conditionals the antecedent of each of which after the first is the\nconsequent of the preceding member of the series. According to each\npremise, if a property belongs to an item or items specified in the\nantecedent, then it belongs to the item or items specified in the\nconsequent. The argument using the property heap (Greek\ns\u00f4ros), from which the genus takes its name, is a good\nexample. If one grain of sand is not a heap, then the result of adding\none more grain is not a heap; if two grains are not a heap, then the\nresult of adding one more is not a heap. But it is plain that if one\nrepeats the operation by which these premises are generated often\nenough, the result will be a sequence of conditionals the consequent\nof whose last member (n grains of sand are not a heap) is clearly\nfalse. Anyone who agrees that it is false, but who has accepted each\nof the conditionals in the sequence, is obliged to reject the\nantecedent of the first, that one grain of sand is not a heap, which\nseems just as plainly true as the consequent of the last premise is\nplainly false. Those who would avoid this face the difficult task of\ndrawing a line somewhere in the sequence by rejecting one of the\npremises and explaining why this conditional and not one preceding it\nis to be rejected.\n\nCarneades\u2019 theological sorites arguments set out from apparently\nunobjectionable ideas about divinity and little by little, on the\nbasis resemblances and implied grounds for bestowing divine status on\nthe generally acknowledged gods, enlarge the extension of the divine\nuntil a conclusion that will be received as absurd is reached (cf.\nBurnyeat, 1982). The first argument in Sextus\u2019 account, for\nexample, proceeds as follows (M 9.182): If Zeus is a god,\nthen Poseidon is a god, but if Poseidon is a god, then Achelous (a\nriver) is a god; Achelous is a god, then so too is the Nile; if the\nNile, then every river, then every stream. This, it is implied, is\nabsurd. Therefore Zeus is not a god, and we are invited to draw the\nconclusion that there are no gods because if any being were a god,\nZeus would be a god and it has apparently just been shown that he is\nnot.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s account, Carneades\u2019 purpose in so arguing is\nsaid to have been \u2018not to abolish the gods\u2013what could\nbecome a philosopher less\u2013but to convict the Stoics of having\nexplained nothing clearly about the gods\u2019 (N.D 44).\nScholars who follow the lead of this remark take Carneades\u2019\nintentions to have been narrowly dialectical\u2013to draw unwelcome\nconsequences from the commitments of his specifically Stoic opponents,\nconsequences that for all the argument tells us follow only Stoic\nassumptions (see Couissin, 1941). But though the Stoics may be\nvulnerable to Carneades\u2019 sorites arguments, the understanding of\nthe divine on which the arguments depend is hardly peculiar to them.\nIn Cicero the arguments are presented by the character Cotta, a priest\nin the Roman religion, who speaks the words describing\nCarneades\u2019 intentions just cited. Cicero\u2019s decision to\nmake Cotta the spokesperson for Academic skepticism in his dialogue\ntells us something important about it, that it was possible to combine\nAcademic skepticism with religious conviction. But the attitude, which\nresembles fideism, that Cotta attributes to Carneades may not have\nbeen Carneades\u2019. There is no special reference to the Stoics in\nSextus\u2019 presentation. Carneades\u2019 arguments, like those in\nthe broader context, may have been intended to raise doubts about the\nexistence of the gods that did not depend on Stoic philosophy and had\nimplications that were not for the Stoics alone. Carneades would have\nbeen arguing not as a committed atheist of course, for he would have\nbeen sensible of the force of the argument in support of the\ngods\u2019 existence, but perhaps as a pioneering agnostic (see\nSedley, 2020).\n\nCarneades also had a hand in the arguments raising problems in logic\ndescribed in Cicero\u2019s Academica (Acad.\n2.91\u20138; cf. Barnes, 1997) and in the case against divination\npresented in his De divinatione.\n",
