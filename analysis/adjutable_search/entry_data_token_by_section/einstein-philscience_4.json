Realism and Separability\n\nAs we have seen, Schlick\u2019s Raum und Zeit in den gegenw\u00e4rtigen\nPhysik promoted a realistic interpretation of the ontology of\ngeneral relativity. After reading the manuscript early in 1917,\nEinstein wrote to Schlick on 21 May that \u201cthe last section\n\u2018Relations to Philosophy\u2019 seems to me excellent\u201d\n(CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 343), just the sort of praise one would expect from\na fellow realist. Three years earlier, the Bonn mathematician, Eduard\nStudy, had written another well-known, indeed very well-known defense\nof realism, Die realistische Weltansicht und die Lehre vom\nRaume (1914). Einstein read it in September of 1918. Much of it\nhe liked, especially the droll style, as he said to Study in a letter\nof 17 September (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 618). Pressed by Study to say more\nabout the points where he disagreed, Einstein replied on 25 September\nin a rather surprising way:\n\n\nI am supposed to explain to you my doubts? By laying stress on these\nit will appear that I want to pick holes in you everywhere. But things\nare not so bad, because I do not feel comfortable and at home in any\nof the \u201cisms.\u201d It always seems to me as though such an ism\nwere strong only so long as it nourishes itself on the weakness of it\ncounter-ism; but if the latter is struck dead, and it is alone on an\nopen field, then it also turns out to be unsteady on its feet. So,\naway we go!\n\n\u201cThe physical world is real.\u201d That is supposed to be the\nfundamental hypothesis. What does \u201chypothesis\u201d mean here?\nFor me, a hypothesis is a statement, whose truth must be\nassumed for the moment, but whose meaning must be raised above all\nambiguity. The above statement appears to me, however, to be, in\nitself, meaningless, as if one said: \u201cThe physical world is\ncock-a-doodle-doo.\u201d It appears to me that the \u201creal\u201d\nis an intrinsically empty, meaningless category (pigeon hole), whose\nmonstrous importance lies only in the fact that I can do certain\nthings in it and not certain others. This division is, to be sure, not\nan arbitrary one, but instead \u2026.\n\nI concede that the natural sciences concern the \u201creal,\u201d\nbut I am still not a realist. (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 624)\n\n\nLest there be any doubt that Einstein has little sympathy for the\nother side, he adds: \n\nThe positivist or pragmatist is strong as long as he battles against\nthe opinion that there [are] concepts that are anchored in the\n\u201cA priori.\u201d When, in his enthusiasm, [he] forgets that all\nknowledge consists [in] concepts and judgments, then that is a\nweakness that lies not in the nature of things but in his personal\ndisposition just as with the senseless battle against hypotheses, cf.\nthe clear book by Duhem. In any case, the railing against atoms rests\nupon this weakness. Oh, how hard things are for man in this world; the\npath to originality leads through unreason (in the sciences), through\nugliness (in the arts)-at least the path that many find passable.\n(CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 624)\n\n\nWhat could Einstein mean by saying that he concedes that the natural\nsciences concern the \u201creal,\u201d but that he is \u201cstill\nnot a realist\u201d and that the \u201creal\u201d in the statement,\n\u201cthe physical world is real,\u201d is an \u201cintrinsically\nempty, meaningless category\u201d?\n\nThe answer might be that realism, for Einstein, is not a philosophical\ndoctrine about the interpretation of scientific theories or the\nsemantics of theoretical\n terms.[3]\n For Einstein, realism is a physical postulate, one of a most\ninteresting kind, as he explained on 18 March 1948 in a long note at\nthe end of the manuscript of Max Born\u2019s Waynflete Lectures,\nNatural Philosophy of Cause and Chance (1949), which Born had\nsent to Einstein for commentary:\n\n\nI just want to explain what I mean when I say that we should try to\nhold on to physical reality. We are, to be sure, all of us aware of\nthe situation regarding what will turn out to be the basic\nfoundational concepts in physics: the point-mass or the particle is\nsurely not among them; the field, in the Faraday - Maxwell sense,\nmight be, but not with certainty. But that which we conceive as\nexisting (\u2019actual\u2019) should somehow be localized in time and\nspace. That is, the real in one part of space, A, should (in theory)\nsomehow \u2018exist\u2019 independently of that which is thought of\nas real in another part of space, B. If a physical system stretches\nover the parts of space A and B, then what is present in B\nshould somehow have an existence independent of what is present in A.\nWhat is actually present in B should thus not depend upon the type of\nmeasurement carried out in the part of space, A; it should also be\nindependent of whether or not, after all, a measurement is made in\nA.\n\nIf one adheres to this program, then one can hardly view the\nquantum-theoretical description as a complete representation\nof the physically real. If one attempts, nevertheless, so to view it,\nthen one must assume that the physically real in B undergoes a sudden\nchange because of a measurement in A. My physical instincts bristle at\nthat suggestion.\n\nHowever, if one renounces the assumption that what is present in\ndifferent parts of space has an independent, real existence, then I do\nnot at all see what physics is supposed to describe. For what is\nthought to by a \u2018system\u2019 is, after all, just conventional,\nand I do not see how one is supposed to divide up the world\nobjectively so that one can make statements about the parts. (Born\n1969, 223\u2013224; Howard\u2019s translation)\n\n\nRealism is thus the thesis of spatial separability, the claim that\nspatial separation is a sufficient condition for the individuation of\nphysical systems, and its assumption is here made into almost a\nnecessary condition for the possibility of an intelligible science of\nphysics.\n\nThe postulate of spatial separability as that which undergirds the\nontic independence and, hence, individual identities of the systems\nthat physics describes was an important part of Einstein\u2019s thinking\nabout the foundations of physics since at least the time of his very\nfirst paper on the quantum hypothesis in 1905 (Einstein 1905a; for\nmore detail on the early history of this idea in Einstein\u2019s thinking,\nsee Howard 1990b). But the true significance of the separability\nprinciple emerged most clearly in 1935, when (as hinted in the\njust-quoted remark) Einstein made it one of the central premises of\nhis argument for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics (see Howard\n1985 and 1989). It is not so clearly deployed in the published version\nof the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paper (1935), but Einstein did not\nwrite that paper and did not like the way the argument appeared there.\nSeparability is, however, an explicit premise in all of Einstein\u2019s\nlater presentations of the argument for the incompleteness of quantum\nmechanics, both in correspondence and in print (see Howard 1985 for a\ndetailed list of references).\n\nIn brief, the argument is this. Separability implies that spacelike\nseparated systems have associated with them independent real states of\naffairs. A second postulate, locality, implies that the events in one\nregion of spacetime cannot physically influence physical reality in a\nregion of spacetime separated from the first by a spacelike interval.\nConsider now an experiment in which two systems, A and B, interact and\nseparate, subsequent measurements on each corresponding to spacelike\nseparated events. Separability implies that A and B have separate real\nphysical states, and locality implies that the measurement performed\non A cannot influence B\u2019s real physical state. But quantum mechanics\nascribes different theoretical states, different wave functions, to B\ndepending upon that parameter that is measured on A. Therefore,\nquantum mechanics ascribes different theoretical states to B, when B\npossesses, in fact, one real physical state. Hence quantum mechanics\nis incomplete.\n\nOne wants to ask many questions. First, what notion of completeness is\nbeing invoked here? It is not deductive completeness. It is closer in\nkind to what is termed \u201ccategoricity\u201d in formal semantics,\na categorical theory being one whose models are all isomorphic to one\nanother. It is closer still to the principle discussed above\u2014and\ncited as a precursor of the concept of categoricity\u2014namely, the\nprinciple of univocalness, which we found doing such important work in\nEinstein\u2019s quest for a general theory of relativity, where it was the\npremise forcing the adoption of an invariant and thus univocal scheme\nfor the individuation of spacetime manifold points.\n\nThe next question is why separability is viewed by Einstein as\nvirtually an a priori necessary condition for the possibility of a\nscience of physics. One reason is because a field theory like general\nrelativity, which was Einstein\u2019s model for a future unified foundation\nfor physics, is an extreme embodiment of the principle of\nseparability: \u201cField theory has carried out this principle to\nthe extreme, in that it localizes within infinitely small\n(four-dimensional) space-elements the elementary things existing\nindependently of the one another that it takes as basic, as well as\nthe elementary laws it postulates for them\u201d (Einstein 1948,\n321\u2013322). And a field theory like general relativity can do this\nbecause the infinitesimal metric interval\u2014the careful way to\nthink about separation in general relativistic spacetime\u2014is\ninvariant (hence univocally determined) under all continuous\ncoordinate transformations.\n\nAnother reason why Einstein would be inclined to view separability as\nan a priori necessity is that, in thus invoking separability to ground\nindividuation, Einstein places himself in a tradition of so viewing\nspatial separability with very strong Kantian roots (and, before Kant,\nNewtonian roots), a tradition in which spatial separability was known\nby the name that Arthur Schopenhauer famously gave to it, the\nprincipium individuationis (for a fuller discussion of this\nhistorical context, see Howard 1997).\n\nA final question one wants to ask is: \u201cWhat does any of this\nhave to do with realism?\u201d One might grant Einstein\u2019s point that\na real ontology requires a principle of individuation without agreeing\nthat separability provides the only conceivable such principle.\nSeparability together with the invariance of the infinitesimal metric\ninterval implies that, in a general relativistic spacetime, there are\njoints everywhere, meaning that we can carve up the universe in any\nway we choose and still have ontically independent parts. But quantum\nentanglement can be read as implying that this libertarian scheme of\nindividuation does not work. Can quantum mechanics not be given a\nrealistic interpretation? Many would say, \u201cyes.\u201d Einstein\nsaid, \u201cno.\u201d \n",
