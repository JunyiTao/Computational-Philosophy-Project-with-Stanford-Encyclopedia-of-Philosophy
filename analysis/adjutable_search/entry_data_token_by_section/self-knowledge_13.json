    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Rationalist Accounts\n3.6 Rationalist Accounts \n\nRationalist accounts of self-knowledge maintain that our status as\nrational thinkers guarantees our capacity for self-knowledge. Some\nagentialist accounts (discussed in the next subsection) agree with\nthat claim, but on agentialist views this guarantee stems from the\nagency exercised in rational deliberation. I reserve the term\n\u201crationalist\u201d for accounts that focus on rationality and\nare independent of claims about agency. As we saw in\n 3.2,\n Shoemaker (1994) contends that no rational thinker (who possesses the\nrelevant mental state concepts) could be \u201cself-blind\u201d, that is,\nincapable of self-knowledge. He reasons as follows. A self-blind\nperson would (i) fall into certain conceptual errors, such as making\nirrational Moore-paradoxical judgments like it\u2019s snowing but\nI don\u2019t believe that it is; (ii) be unable to communicate\ntheir beliefs, and hence to engage in cooperative endeavors; (iii)\nregard themselves \u201cas a stranger\u201d, e.g. in observing themselves taking\naspirin without grasping that they were in pain. Yet a rational\nthinker would not commit these errors, be incapacitated in this way,\nor suffer this kind of self-alienation. So rational thinkers cannot be\nself-blind.\n\n\nShoemaker explains the link between rationality and self-knowledge\nwith his \u201cconstitutivist\u201d\n [8]\n thesis, namely: for rational thinkers with the appropriate conceptual\nrepertoire, being in certain mental states constitutes\nknowledge that one is in them. What it is for a rational creature to\nfeel pain is, in part, for that creature to believe that they are in\npain; what it is for a rational creature to believe that p\nis, in part, for it to believe that it believes that p; etc.\nShoemaker cashes out this idea with a functionalist analysis of mental\nstates, proposing that in rational creatures, the causal role defining\na mental state are also sufficient for belief that one is in that\nmental state (Shoemaker 1994: 287\u20139).\n\nInspired in part by Shoemaker\u2019s arguments, Stoljar (2018, 2019)\nhas recently proposed an ambitious, systematic explanation of the\n(supposed) fact that rational thinkers are necessarily capable of\nself-knowledge. Stoljar posits that what it means to be\nrational is to be guided by the rules of rationality, which\ninclude the following \u201cintrospective principle\u201d:\n\n\nIf one is in a conscious state C, \u2026 one will believe that one is in\nC. (Stoljar 2019: 405; ellipsis in original)\n\n\n(The ellipsis indicates that further conditions must be added; the\ndetails are not crucial here.) If rationality partly consists in\nfollowing this principle, then no rational creature will be\nself-blind. Stoljar (2019) argues that his proposal also explains why,\nas Evans claimed, we can know that we believe that p by\nconsidering p. He proposes that a belief is conscious, in the\nrelevant sense, when one attends to its content\u2014e.g., to\nit\u2019s snowing. Together with the introspective principle\nabove, this means that a rational person who believes that p,\nand who attends to p, will believe that they believe that\np.\n\nSmithies (2019) also defends the idea that rational thinkers are\nnecessarily capable of knowing their beliefs. His starting point is\nthe claim that Moore-paradoxical beliefs are always irrational. He\nnotes that such beliefs may seem rational if a thinker\ndoesn\u2019t know what they believe: e.g., if someone believes that\np but has misleading evidence suggesting that they\ndon\u2019t believe that p. Smithies concludes that, since\nsuch beliefs are always irrational, a rational thinker will know all\nof their beliefs. \u201cRationality requires knowing what you believe,\nsince otherwise you\u2019re liable to fall into an irrational Moorean\npredicament\u201d (ibid.: 174). To explain how we are able to know all of\nour beliefs, he proposes a nonstandard conception of belief: \u201cto\nbelieve that p is to be disposed to judge that p\nwhen you consciously entertain whether p\u201d (ibid.: 175\u20136).\nGiven that conception, beliefs are necessarily accessible to the\nsubject, since they consist in dispositions to conscious judgments.\nThis means that a rational thinker who believes that p will\nhave (available) justification for believing that they believe that\np.\n\nRationalist accounts face two related challenges. First, to defend the\nidea that rationality guarantees the capacity for self-knowledge,\nthese accounts must adopt a fairly demanding conception of what it is\nto be rational. But if a conception of rationality is too demanding,\nthen it is questionable whether it applies to cognitively flawed\ncreatures like us (Kornblith 2012; Cassam 2015). Second, in order to\nexplain how we can meet their demanding standards for\nrationality\u2014how we can follow Stoljar\u2019s introspective\nprinciple, or can know all of our beliefs\u2014rationalists tend to\ninvoke nonstandard conceptions of \u201cconscious\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d. The\nchallenge here is to show that the process of achieving self-knowledge\nis psychologically realistic and that it applies to the kinds of\nstates that we actually possess.\n\nMany philosophers share the intuition that, necessarily, no rational\nthinker is self-blind. The success of rationalist accounts of\nself-knowledge depends on whether there are conceptions of\nrationality, consciousness, belief, etc. that are robust enough to\nexclude the possibility of self-blindness yet psychologically\nrealistic enough to explain the cognitive achievements of actual human\nbeings.\n",
