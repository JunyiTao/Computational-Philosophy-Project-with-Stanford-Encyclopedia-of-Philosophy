    "main_text": "The poem\u2019s structure and lack of final revision\n2. The poem\u2019s structure and lack of final revision\n\nThe six books of the DRN display a clear architectural\ndesign:\n\nAtoms and void as the sole permanent entities\nAtomic motion and atomic shapes; the properties of compounds\nThe nature and mortality of soul; curing the fear of death\nActivities of the soul: sensation and thought, volition, dreams\nand emotions\nOur world: cosmology, origins of life, and history of\ncivilisation\nMeteorological and terrestrial phenomena\n\n\nThe most obvious feature is the progression in scale of the\nsubject-matter, in two-book increments. We start with the atomic level\nin books 1\u20132, move to the human scale in books 3 and 4, and then\nonto the cosmic in 5\u20136. Between each of the three pairs the\nfirst book concentrates on the nature or permanent properties of the\nsubject, while the second depicts its powers and activity, the subject\nin action. Only the atoms, however, are indestructible and thus\neverlasting. All generated entities, from our souls to the cosmos, are\ncompounds and so transient and destructible (on gods see section 7\nbelow).\n\nA second structuring feature is the direction given by the themes of\nbirth and death. The opening hymn to Roman Venus features a spring\nscene of birth and joy, nature at her most benign and nurturing, while\nbooks 3 and 6 close on the theme of death. Book 3 argues for the\nmortality of the soul, and its final sections seek to remove the fear\nof death, while Book 6 ends with a dark and horrible portrayal of mass\ndeath adapted from Thucydides\u2019 account of the Athenian plague in\n430\u2013426 BCE. A balance between the two halves of the work is\nalso marked out by the one and only mention of Epicurus by name in the\nwhole DRN, at 3.1042. This unique direct mention is already\nconspicuous, but its position at the end of book 3, at the very core\nof the poem, gives it more prominence.\n\nSuch large-scale symmetries show careful poetic design. At the same\ntime, there are a number of indications that the DRN is\nlacking its final revision. The strongest sign of this is a passage\nfrom the opening of Book 4. Lines 4.45\u201353 recap the contents of\nbooks 1 and 2 and then announce as the next subject\nsimulacra, Lucretius\u2019 renderings of the\neidola, the thin film of images constantly shed by all solid\nobjects, whose stream is the object of vision. These are indeed\ntreated next but, oddly 4.45\u201353 make no mention of the soul, the\ntopic of book 3. Worse, the lines follow another programmatic passage,\n4.26\u201344 also introducing the simulacra, but now given\nas the sequel to the discussion of soul. Together the two passages\nshow that 4.45\u201353 are a left-over from an earlier draft. This\nrelative imperfection, however, is also precious evidence for the\ndevelopment of the work. As pointed out long ago (Mewaldt 1908), it is\nevidence of a change of plan: at some point books 3 and 4 were\ninterchanged. Interestingly, this first ordering of the material\nagrees with the order of exposition in Epicurus\u2019s Letter to\nHerodotus.\n\nA number of other features are less conclusive, but also suggest that\na final revision was never executed. First, Books 1 to 3 as a group\nare shorter and more polished than 4 to 6. Second, the recurrence of\nthe vital honey and woodworm passage from book 1 at the opening of\nbook 4, with minor variations (1.926\u2013950 = 4.1\u201325) is\nawkward. Some suspect that the book 4 version was slated for\nreplacement, though some defend it. Third is the promise at 5.155 to\ndiscuss the abodes of the gods at some length (largo\nsermone), never taken up. Two final considerations, though\ninconclusive, also deserve mention. For some, the ending of book 6 as\nwe have it is too bleak and lacking its moral, but others think it\nadequate as a closure, the readers being by then sufficiently\ninstructed to draw the moral themselves. Lastly, the proems of books 1\nto 3 appear to form an integrated pattern. The proems of 1 to 3 appear\nto mark out degrees of cosmic ascent as equivalent to degrees of\nEpicurean initiation: book 1 celebrates Venus/pleasure here on earth;\nthe second proem locates readers among \u2018the lofty sanctuaries of\nthe wise\u2019 (2.8), now free from the struggles of the\nunenlightened; the third proem raises us all the way to the level of\ngods (3.15\u201330), as if outside the cosmos. After that, however,\nthe pattern is harder to discern.]\n",
