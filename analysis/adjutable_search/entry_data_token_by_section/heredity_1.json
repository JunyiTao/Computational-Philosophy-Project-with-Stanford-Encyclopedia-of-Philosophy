Heritability and Population Genetics\n\nMendelian genetics provides laws that govern the passing on of\ndiscrete traits from one generation to the next. For example, Mendel\nexperimentally demonstrated particular patterns of inheritance for\nsmooth and wrinkled peas in a population of pea plants. Discrete or\ndiscontinuous traits contrast with continuous or quantitative traits.\nHeight in humans and leaf number in trees are continuous traits.\nContinuous traits vary on a continuum that can be represented as a\nnormal distribution, graphed as a bell curve. Most philosophical\ndiscussion about heredity and heritability arises from the study of\ncontinuous traits.\n\nThe study of quantitative or continuous traits can be carried out by\nlooking simply at phenotypes. For example, if a population of plants\nvaries in height we can ask how much of this variation is due to\ngenes. Assessing the proportion of the variation of a trait in a\npopulation that is due to genes is achieved by a statistical method\ncalled the analysis of variance. Once this analysis has been carried\nout a simple formula provides a number between 0 and 1 that is the\nheritability measure for the trait in question. We use a few simple\nexamples to illustrate the important concepts involved in producing\nheritability measures.\n\nBefore we consider the analysis of variance and its contribution to\nheritability measures, it is helpful to understand the general concept\nof heritability. Heritability is a measure of genetic influence on\nvariation. If a trait has high heritability, its varying from\nindividual to individual in a population can be explained genetically.\nAn imaginary example illustrates one way of assessing heritability.\nSay we have two students from a class and student a is\n6\u20322\u2033 and student b is 4\u20322\u2033. To discover\nthe influence of genes on height, we could clone both students and\nthen swap the clones\u2019 environments and see what happens. In the\nfigure below, the environments that a and b grew up in\nare \\(\\rE a\\) and \\(\\rE b\\). Clones of a and b are \\(\\rC\na\\) and \\(\\rC b\\). \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccl} \n& \\rE a & \\rE b & \\text{Height results} \\ldots \\\\\\hline \n1 & \\rC b=4^{\\prime}2^{\\prime\\prime} & \\rC a=6^{\\prime}2^{\\prime\\prime} & \\text{from genes} \\\\\\hline \n2 & \\rC b=5^{\\prime}8^{\\prime\\prime} & \\rC a=5^{\\prime}8^{\\prime\\prime} & \\text{from genes and environment} \\\\\\hline \n3 & \\rC b=6^{\\prime}2^{\\prime\\prime} & \\rC a=4^{\\prime}2^{\\prime\\prime}  & \\text{entirely from environment} \\\\\\hline \n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nA scenario like 2 is the most likely outcome. Of course we can\u2019t\nclone humans (or faithfully replicate the environments they grow up\nin). We can, however, do this with plants and other kinds of\nexperimental organisms and as a result we can get a good sense of the\ncontribution of genes to variation in a phenotypic trait.\n\nHeritability can be estimated in humans by comparing resemblance in\nthe phenotypic traits of twins (See Section 4. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of twin studies.). Twin studies make the following\nassumptions: Monozygotic, (identical), twins share all their genes and\ntheir environment but dizygotic, (fraternal), twins share half their\ngenes and their environment. For any given trait, say height, we get\nthe following results:\n\nIf heritability is high and variation is due mostly to genes, then\nmonozygotic twins will be closer in height than fraternal twins.\n\n\nIf heritability is low and variation in height is due mostly to the\nenvironment, then monozygotic twins will be as different in height\nfrom one another as dizygotic twins.\n\nFinally, we can get a sense of the heritability of a trait by finding\nthe slope of the regression line on the plots of offspring value for a\ntrait graphed with parental value. If the slope is 1, the trait is\nentirely genetic and if the slope is 0, then the trait is not genetic\nat all. If the variation among individuals is due to variation in\ntheir genes, then offspring ought to resemble their parents.\nHeritability is always a value between 1 and 0. In the graph below\nvalues for mid-parent height and mid-offspring height are plotted for\na small sample population (mid-parent height is the average of the\nheight of both parents). The slope of the regression line is .75,\nwhich indicates high heritability. (It should be stressed that this is\na very informal presentation of this kind of estimation of\nheritability and for this approach to provide any useful results\nimportant constraints on the nature of the population and the relevant\nenvironment would have to be satisfied.)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nSo far we have introduced methods of measuring or calculating\nheritability that are somewhat intuitive. The problem is that these\nmethods do not acknowledge all that is involved in the production of\nvariation in the quantitative traits of organisms in a population. If\nwe stick to the example of variation in height in a sample population\nof humans, we will discover that in most representative samples,\nheights are distributed more or less normally. The variance in height\nis defined as the average of the squared difference between each\nmeasured height and the mean height for the population. Variance in\nphenotype or phenotypic variance is symbolized as \\(V_P\\). (From here\nuntil the end of this section we adopt a specific strategy for\npresenting the equations used in spelling out heritability relations.\nWe start out, with equation (1) below, by presenting the simplest\nversion of the relevant equations. Simple equations such as (1) below\nare rarely ever satisfied but are routinely presented as adequate in\nelementary introductions to behavioral genetics. Subsequent equations\nin the sequence below render the relevant situation more accurately.\nPopulation geneticists endorse variants of (1\u2032) below and do not\nendorse (1).) \n\n\\[\\tag{1} V_P = V_G + V_E \\]\n\n\nEquation (1) simply says that the phenotypic variance is the variance\ndue to genes plus the variance due to the organisms\u2019\nenvironment. Behavioral geneticists and psychologists introduce\nheritability in the following way: Heritability is the proportion of\nphenotypic variance that is attributable to genotypic variance:\nheritability \\(= \\bfrac{V_G}{V_P}\\) (Biologists will also sometimes\ntalk of \u201cenvironmentability\u201d, which is\n\\(\\bfrac{V_E}{V_P}\\).)\n\nThis notion of heritability is called broad sense heritability,\n\\(h_b^2\\) , and is \u201cthe proportion of phenotypic differences due\nto all sources of genetic variance\u201d (Plomin 1990, 234). Narrow\nsense heritability, \\(h^2\\), is \u201cthe proportion of phenotypic\nvariance due solely to additive genetic variance\u201d (Plomin 1990,\n234). \n\n\\[\\tag{2} h_b^2 = \\frac{V_G}{V_P} \\] \\[\\tag{3} h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} \\]\n\n\n\u201cAdditive genetic variation \\((V_{A})\\) is variation among\nindividuals due to the additive effects of genes\u201d (Freeman and\nHeron, 206). For example, variation in height of organisms could\nresult from the contribution of several alleles at a locus where each\nallele contributes more height to the organism. More precisely, allele\nA could contribute .5 units to an organism\u2019s height,\nallele a another .5 units and so on. A contrast with additive\ngenetic variance is dominance variance \\((V_{D})\\). In this case, say\ntwo alleles (A and a) are responsible for the\norganism\u2019s height. An organism with aa is 1.0 units high,\nan organism with AA is 2.0 units high but an organism with\nAa is also 2.0 units high. Total genetic variance,\n\\(V_G\\), is actually the sum of all the genetic variance. In the\nsimplified case presented here this is \n\n\\[\\tag{4} V_G = V_A + V_D \\]\n\n\nThe implied equation for \\(V_P\\) from the discussion so far is\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1^{\\prime}\\)} V_P = V_A + V_D + V_E \\]\n\n\nBut this equation still oversimplifies the situation and requires more\nrefining to deal with quantitative traits. Variance in phenotype can\nresult from gene interaction effects, or epistatic variance,\n\\(V_{I}\\). This occurs when alleles at one locus have an effect on the\nphenotype that is dependent upon alleles at one or more other loci.\nFurther, there may be a contribution to phenotypic variance from\ngene/environment interaction, \\(V_{G\\times E}\\) (See Tabery 2014 for a\ndetailed discussion of gene/environment interaction.). This occurs\nwhen the effect of the environment on the phenotype differs between\ngenotypes. Finally, \\(V_P\\) can be affected by non-random correlations\nbetween genotypes and environments referred to as gene-environment\ncovariation, \\(\\COV(G,E)\\). For example, if plants with a genotype\nthat tends to produce large plants also select nutrient- rich\nenvironments, by root growth or seed dispersal, and plants with a\ngenotype that tends to produce small plants also select nutrient- poor\nenvironments, the variance in height would be increased. If the\nrelation were switched the variance would decrease (Futuyma\n1998). Factoring all the above in we now have the following:\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1^{\\prime}\\)} V_P = V_A + V_D + V_I + V_E + V_{G\\times E} + \\COV(G,E) \\]\n\n\nAnd \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(4^{\\prime}\\)} V_G = V_A + V_D + V_I \\]\n\n\nThe assumption made by many evolutionary biologists is that \\(V_I,\nV_{G\\times E}\\) and \\(\\COV(G,E)\\) are generally small and the most\nimportant component of variance from an evolutionary standpoint is\n\\(V_A\\). As a result, evolutionary biologists are usually interested\nin \\(h^2 (= \\bfrac{V_A}{V_P})\\). In contrast, psychologists and\nbehavioral geneticists are more interested in \\(h_b^2 (=\n\\bfrac{V_G}{V_P})\\). Psychologists are interested in the contribution\nof genes to human psychological traits whereas evolutionary biologists\nuse heritability measures to predict and measure the response of a\ntrait to selection. The relevant equation here is \n\n\\[\\tag{5} h^2 = \\frac{R}{S} \\]\n\n\nwhere, R is response to selection and S is the selection\ndifferential. Heritability in this context is referred to as realized\nheritability.\n\nPhilosophical discussion over measuring heritability has arisen mostly\nfrom the use of \\(h_b^2\\) measures in behavioral genetics and\npsychology. Much of this discussion takes off from a paper by Lewontin\n(1974) in which he argues that the analysis of variance cannot provide\nus with answers to questions about how much genes contribute to\nvariance in a given trait. Before we turn to this and related\ndiscussions, we provide more detail on how heritability is measured in\nhumans.\n",
