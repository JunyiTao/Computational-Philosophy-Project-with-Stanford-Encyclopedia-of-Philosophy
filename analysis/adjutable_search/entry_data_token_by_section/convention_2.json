    "main_text": "Issues raised by convention || Conventionalism\n1.2 Conventionalism\n\n\nConventionalism about some phenomenon is the doctrine that, perhaps\ndespite appearances to the contrary, the phenomenon arises from or is\ndetermined by convention. Conventionalism surfaces in virtually every\narea of philosophy, with respect to such topics as property (Hume\u2019s\nTreatise of Human Nature), justice (Hume\u2019s Treatise\nagain), morality (Gilbert Harman (1996), Graham Oddie (1999), Bruno Verbeek (2008)),\ngeometry (Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1902), Hans Reichenbach (1922), Adolf\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1962)), Lawrence Sklar (1977)), pictorial\nrepresentation (Nelson Goodman (1976)), personal identity (Derek\nParfit (1984)), ontology (Rudolf Carnap (1937), Nelson Goodman (1978),\nHilary Putnam (1987)), arithmetic and mathematical analysis (Rudolf\nCarnap (1937)), necessity (A. J. Ayer (1936)), Alan Sidelle (1989)),\nand almost any other topic one can imagine. Conventionalism arises in\nso many different forms that one can say little of substance about it\nas a general matter. However, a distinctive thesis shared by most\nconventionalist theories is that there exist alternative\nconventions that are in some sense equally good. Our choice of a\nconvention from among alternatives is undetermined by the nature of\nthings, by general rational considerations, or by universal features\nof human physiology, perception, or cognition. This element of free\nchoice distinguishes conventionalism from doctrines such as\nprojectivism, transcendental idealism, and constructivism about\nmathematics, all of which hold that, in one way or another, certain\nphenomena are \u201cdue to us.\u201d\n\n\nA particularly important species of conventionalism, especially within\nmetaphysics and epistemology, holds that some phenomenon is partly due\nto our conventions about the meaning or proper use of words. For\ninstance, Henri Poincar\u00e9 argues that \u201cthe axioms of\ngeometry are merely disguised definitions,\u201d concluding\nthat:\n\n\nThe axioms of geometry therefore are neither synthetic a\npriori judgments nor experimental facts. They are\nconventions; our choice among all possible conventions is\nguided by experimental facts; but it remains free and\nis limited only by the necessity of avoiding all contradiction. (1902,\np. 65)\n\n\nPoincar\u00e9 holds that, in practice, we will always find it more\nconvenient to choose Euclidean over non-Euclidean geometry. But he\ninsists that, in principle, we could equally well choose non-Euclidean\naxioms. This position greatly influenced the logical positivists,\nincluding Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick, and Hans Reichenbach, who\ngeneralized it to other aspects of science.\n\n\nBeginning with Logical Syntax of Language (1937/2002), Carnap\ndeveloped a particularly thoroughgoing version of linguistic\nconventionalism. Carnap invites us to propose various linguistic\nframeworks for scientific inquiry. Which framework we choose\ndetermines fundamental aspects of our logic, mathematics, and\nontology. For instance, we might choose a framework yielding either\nclassical or intuitionistic logic; we might choose a framework\nquantifying over numbers or one that eschews numbers; we might choose\na framework that takes sense data as primitive or one that takes\nphysical objects as primitive. Questions about logic, mathematics, and\nontology make no sense outside a linguistic framework, since only by\nchoosing a framework do we settle upon the ground rules through which\nwe can rationally assess such questions. There is no theoretical basis\nfor deciding between any two linguistic frameworks. It is just a\nmatter for conventional stipulation based upon pragmatic factors like\nconvenience.\n\n\nConventionalist theories differ along several dimensions. The most\nobvious concerns the underlying understanding of conventions\nthemselves. In many cases, such as Hume\u2019s theory of property and\njustice, the conventions are social. In other cases, however,\nconvention lacks any intrinsically social element. For example, both\nPoincar\u00e9 and Carnap seem to regard conventional stipulation as\nsomething that a lone cognitive agent could in principle achieve.\n\n\nAnother important difference between conventionalist theories\nconcerns what the \u201cconventional\u201d is contrasted with.\nOptions include: the natural; the mind-independent; the objective; the\nuniversal; the factual; and the truth-evaluable.\n\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric conventionalism contrasts the\nconventional with the truth-evaluable. According to Poincar\u00e9,\nthere is no underlying fact of the matter about the geometry of\nphysical space, so geometric axioms are not evaluable as true or false.\nRather, the choice of an axiom system is akin to the choice of a\nmeasuring standard, such as the metric system. In many conventionalist\ntheories, however, the idea is that our conventions somehow\nmake certain facts true. Those facts may be\n\u201cconventional\u201d, \u201csocial,\u201d or\n\u201cinstitutional\u201d rather than \u201cbrute\u201d or\n\u201cnatural,\u201d but they are full-fledged facts nonetheless. For\ninstance, following Hume, it seems plausible to claim that property\nrights and monetary value are due largely to convention. Yet few\nphilosophers would hold that claims about property rights or monetary\nvalue are\n non-truth-evaluable.[2]\nAs this example illustrates, conventionalism\nneed not reflect an \u201canti-realist\u201d or\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d stance towards some subject matter.\n\n\nConventionalism often entrains relativism. A particularly\nclear example is Gilbert Harman\u2019s moral philosophy (1996), according\nto which moral truths result from social convention. Conventions vary\namong societies. One society may regard infanticide as horrific, while\nanother may regard it as routine and necessary. Moral statements are\ntrue only relative to a conventional standard. On the other hand, as\nthe example of property rights illustrates, one can accept that some\nfact is due to social convention while denying that it is relative or\nnon-universal. For instance, one might urge, the conventions of my\nsociety make it the case that I own my house, but this fact is then\ntrue simpliciter, without relativization to a particular\nsocietal convention.\n\n\nA final division among conventionalist theories concerns whether the\nputative conventions inform pre-existing practice. Hume\u2019s theory\nof property purports to unveil actual conventions at work in actual\nhuman societies. But some conventionalists instead urge that we must\nadopt a convention. Carnap\u2019s conventionalist treatment\nof logic, mathematics, and ontology illustrates this approach. Carnap\nexhorts us to replace unformalized natural language with conventionally\nchosen formal languages. Carnap has no interest in describing\npre-existing practice. Instead, he offers a \u201crational\nreconstruction\u201d of that practice.\n",
