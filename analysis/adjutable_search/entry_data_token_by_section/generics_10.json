    "main_text": "Semantic Analyses of Gen || Stereotypes and Prototypes\n2.4 Stereotypes and Prototypes\n\nA somewhat different approach to the semantics of generics is taken by\ntheorists who suppose that generics express stereotypes or prototypes.\nOn such views, \u201ctigers are striped\u201d would express that the\nstereotypical or prototypical tiger is striped, and likewise,\n\u201csharks attack bathers\u201d would express a belief about the\nstereotypical or prototypical shark. Geurts (1985) and Declerk (1986)\nsuggest that generics may be interpreted as expressing culturally\naccepted stereotypes, and Platteau (1980), Nunberg and Pan (1975), and\nHeyer (1985, 1990) claim that generics express prototypes, in the\nsense of Rosch (1978). Thus on such views, \u201ctigers are\nstriped\u201d would express the fact that the stereotypical or\nprototypical tiger is striped.\n\nA general concern with views of this type is that they would seem to\nmake the holding of the relevant sort of false belief sufficient to\nrender the generic true. For example, suppose that people falsely\nassociate sliminess with snakes in the relevant way (e.g., as a\nculturally held stereotype, or part of the Roschean prototype, etc).\nThis does not make the generic \u201csnakes are slimy\u201d true\n(Krifka et al. 1995). While it is plausible that people often\nassert generics on the basis of their\nprototypical/stereotypical beliefs, it is implausible to think that\nthese beliefs enter into the truth conditions of generics.\nStereotypical beliefs can be, and often are, false.\n",
