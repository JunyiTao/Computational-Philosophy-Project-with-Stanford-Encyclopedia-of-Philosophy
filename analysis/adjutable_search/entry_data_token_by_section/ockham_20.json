Political Philosophy\n\nThe divine command themes so prominent in Ockham\u2019s ethics are\nmuch more muted in his political theory, which on the contrary tends\nto be far more \u201cnatural\u201d and\n \u201csecular.\u201d[53]\n As sketched\n above,\n Ockham\u2019s political writings began at Avignon with a discussion\nof the issue of poverty. But later on the issues were generalized to\ninclude church/state relations more broadly. He was one of the first\nmedieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation, and\nwas important for the early development of the notion of property\nrights.\n\nThe Franciscan Order at this time was divided into two parties, which\ncame to be known as the \u201cConventuals\u201d and the\n\u201cSpirituals\u201d (or \u201czealots\u201d). The Spirituals,\namong whom were Ockham, Michael of Cesena, and the other exiles who\njoined them in fleeing Avignon, tried to preserve the original ideal\nof austere poverty practiced and advocated by St. Francis himself (c.\n1181\u20131226). The Conventuals, on the other hand, while\nrecognizing this ideal, were prepared to compromise in order to\naccommodate the practical needs of a large, organized religious order;\nthey were by far the majority of the order. The issue between the two\nparties was never one of doctrine; neither side accused the other of\nheresy. Rather, the question was one of how to shape and run the\norder\u2014in particular, whether the Franciscans should (or even\ncould) renounce all property rights.\n",
