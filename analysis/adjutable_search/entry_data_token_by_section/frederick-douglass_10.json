    "main_text": "Women\u2019s Suffrage\n11. Women\u2019s Suffrage\n\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass remained active in Republican Party. He\nwas a staunch supporter of uncompromising Reconstruction of the Union\nand advocated for economic and education investment in free and\nnewly-freed black Americans. Douglass pressed for the expansion of and\nguarantee of civil rights for blacks, particularly for the defense of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875, which the Supreme Court declared\nunconstitutional in 1883 (1883a [FDSW: 685\u2013693]). Additionally,\nin keeping with his civil rights efforts and his view of natural\nrights and the development of the United States into a just Republic,\nhe was an advocate, although a complicated one, of women\u2019s\nsuffrage (Douglass 1976). He joined other prominent leaders in the\nabolition movement, such as Sojourner Truth, and emerging leaders in\nthe suffrage movement, such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady\nStanton, in these efforts.\n\nThe American Equal Rights Association was the principal national\norganization working on behalf of women\u2019s right to vote. At\nleast in rhetoric, it had a dual platform of racial and sexual\nequality (DuBois 1978). Middle-class and wealthy white women primarily\nled it, and Douglass supported its platform but clashed with its\nleaders over conflicting interests and its latent racism. The tensions\nwithin the American Equal Rights Association, and the suffrage\nmovement generally, erupted over the passing of the fifteenth\namendment to the U.S. Constitution. The fifteenth amendment franchised\nall male citizens, although, as U.S. history so brutally revealed, it\ndid so in word but not in deed. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.\nAnthony opposed the fifteenth amendment because they demanded that\nblack men and all women (particularly white women) should be\nenfranchised simultaneously. Some within the suffrage movement based\ntheir arguments for women\u2019s suffrage and against blacks\u2019\nenfranchisement on racist grounds. Although the white women who led\nthe association were abolitionists, they also, and not\ninconsequentially, held that blacks, particularly black men, were\ninferior to white women and neither as ready for nor deserving of the\nvote as they were (Stanton 1868 [2000: 194\u2013199] and 1869 [2000:\n236\u2013238]).\n\nDouglass was sympathetic to the cause of the universal franchise;\nhowever, he condemned arguments for women\u2019s suffrage that were\npredicated on the supposed racial superiority of white women. He\nroundly condemned Stanton\u2019s racist claims that black and\n\u201cOriental\u201d men, and by extension black and Asian\nwomen\u2014i.e., Stanton\u2019s nasty references to\n\u201cSambo\u201d and \u201cYung Tung\u201d\u2014were not as\ndeserving as white women (1869b [FDP1 v.4: 213\u2013219]; Stanton\n1868 [2000: 194\u2013199]). Douglass did not want to delay the\nfranchise for black males to resolve the question of women\u2019s\nright to vote. He believed it a practical matter to quickly get some\nprotections for black Americans while the fight for suffrage for black\nand white women continued. Moreover, he argued it was imperative to\nobtain some measure of blacks\u2019 political, legal, and social\nrights to confront the rising level of horrific anti-black violence\nsweeping the United States. Douglass firmly made this claim in his\nspeech at an American Equal Rights Association meeting in 1869:\n\n\nI must say that I do not see how any one can pretend that there is the\nsame urgency in giving the ballot to women as to the negro. With us,\nthe matter is a question of life and death. It is a matter of\nexistence, at least in fifteen states of the Union. When women,\nbecause they are women, are hunted down through the cities of New York\nand New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses and hung upon\nlamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, and their\nbrains dashed out upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult\nand outrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their\nhomes burnt down over their heads; when their children are not allowed\nto enter schools; then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot\nequal to our own. (1869b [FDP1 v.4: 216] [SFD: 271])\n\n\nWhen asked if this did not apply to black women, Douglass replied that\nit did, but because they were black and not women (Ibid.). He did not\nhave ready answers, however, to concerns about how well black men,\nincluding elite black men, represented and protected the rights and\ninterests of black women. Generations of black male leaders repeated\nhis shortsightedness, which black women leaders, like Anna Julia\nCooper (c. 1859\u20131964), criticized while also struggling against\nthe racism of first-wave feminism (Cooper 1998).\n",
