    "main_text": "Scholastic Concepts of Probability || Semantic probability\n3.4 Semantic probability\n\nAristotle tied the notion of probability to questions of necessity and\ncontingency. The probable did not follow with necessity but only\ncontingently (and for the most part) from the nature of things. In\nmedieval scholasticism, this connection was often stated in semantic\nterms. Boethius of Dacia called probability: \u201ca property which\ndisposes (habilitans) but does not necessitate a subject to\nthe partaking of a\n predicate\u201d.[28]\n Probability is here a degree of participation of a predicate in a\nsubject. Full participation under all conditions stands for necessity;\nparticipation under most conditions (for the most part) leads to\nprobability. The semantic notion of probability as conditioned\nparticipation of a predicate in a subject is thus closely related to\nthe proto-frequentist interpretation discussed above. It is, however,\nformally distinct as a notion of probability, not least because some\nscholastics addressed it as such. Peter Richeri, Topica\nAristotelis (A. 37), I q. 2,\n117ra\u2013118ra, referred to Boethius (the\nancient one, not the medieval philosopher of Dacia) in this\ncontext:\n\n\nYet Boethius defines probable things differently in his\nTopics I: probable things are those to which the mind readily\nacquiesces, although it does not possess a firmness of truth in them,\nas in this proposition: \u201cIf she is a mother, she loves [her\nchild].\u201d With respect to this explication, it should moreover be\nknown that a proposition is called probable when its subject contains\na property which disposes, but does not necessitate, it to partake of\nthe predicate\n \u2026.[29]\n\n\nThe semantic relation to which Richeri refers is not explicit in\nBoethius\u2019s definition. What mainly matters here, however, is\nRicheri\u2019s use of a semantic notion of probability. Albert of\nCologne displays the same notion in connection with a perception-based\nexplanation; such propositions are held true by everyone, the most, or\nthe\n wise.[30]\n The less sense-based and the more intellectual a perception is the\nmore is it restricted to the wise and the thoughtful, according to\nAlbert. Interestingly, he acknowledges Arabic sources for this view\n(Albert Logica, I, 1, 2, 241; Bach 1881; Cortabarria Beita\n1953). He does not mention a specific source, but this hint uncovers\nan important connection indicating that medieval Islamic philosophy,\ntheology, and law were no less based on probability than their\nChristian counterparts (Black 1990, 108; Daiber 1990, 218; Miller\n1984, 55).\n\nNicolas of Autrecourt offers an alternative perspective on the\ncontrast between complete and partial participation. Nicolas posits\nthat perfect knowledge corresponds to the full appearance of an\nobject, whereas probability represents a degree of approaching this\ncompleteness. Certainty, in turn, arises when there exists a\nsufficiently high degree of completeness in the object\u2019s manifestation\n(Grellard 2005, 93; Salvestrini 2022, 968).\n",
