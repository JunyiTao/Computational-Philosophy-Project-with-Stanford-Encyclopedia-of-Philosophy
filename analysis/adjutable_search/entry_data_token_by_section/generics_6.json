    "main_text": "Semantic Analyses of Gen\n2. Semantic Analyses of Gen\n\nA great deal of work has been done on the semantics of\n(characterizing) generics, particularly on bare plural\n(characterizing) generics. It is easy to see why this is so:\n\u201cDucks lay eggs\u201d is a true generic, while \u201cducks are\nfemale\u201d is false, yet it is only the female ducks who ever lay\neggs. \u201cMosquitoes carry the West Nile virus\u201d is true, and\n\u201cbooks are paperbacks\u201d is false, yet less than one percent\nof mosquitoes carry the virus, while over eighty percent of books are\npaperbacks. How are we to account for these puzzling facts?\n\nIt is clear that generics are not equivalent to universal statements,\nbut rather permit exceptions\u2014that is, generics can be true even\nif some (or sometimes many) members of the kind lack the property in\nquestion. Generics also do not mean \u201cmost\u201d; it is false\nthat most mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus and true that most\nbooks are paperbacks, but our intuitions about the truth/falsity of\nthe corresponding generics are reversed.\n\nAs these examples suggest, Gen cannot be analyzed as sharing\na meaning with any of the standard quantifiers. One question that\ncomes up immediately is whether Gen can be considered a\nquantifier in any sense. Carlson (1977) argued informally that it\ncould not, since generics do not tell us how much or how\nmany. He notes that, if asked \u201chow many tigers are\nstriped\u201d, one could reply \u201cmost/all/many/some tigers are\nstriped\u201d, but not simply \u201ctigers are striped\u201d (see\nLeslie (2007) for a more formal argument, which goes by way of the\npremise that quantifiers exhibit isomorphism invariance, while\nGen does not.).\n\nA significant number of theories concerning the meaning of generics\nhave been offered over the years. Most theories have focused primarily\non bare plural generics, though some theories are intended to cover\nindefinite and definite singulars too. We will conclude with some\nremarks concerning issues specific to indefinite and definite\nsingulars.\n",
