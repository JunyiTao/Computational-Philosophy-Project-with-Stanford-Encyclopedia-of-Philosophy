There is\nevidence that the couple worked closely together at that time.\nMoreover, there are discrepancies between the final manuscript in\nCondorcet\u2019s hand, and the first published version, edited and\nintroduced by Grouchy. There are notable passages added that deal with\nthe role of women and families in the evolution of humanity. On the\nfirst page of the first part, \u201cMen united into hordes\u201d,\nCondorcet writes that human groups are always family based and this is\nbecause mothers and fathers have a natural tendency to form strong\nemotional attachments towards their children:\n\n\nA family society seems to be natural to man. Its origin is to be found\nin the child\u2019s need for its parents and in the natural\nsolicitude of the mother and\u2014though to a lesser extent\u2014of\nthe father for their offspring. But the child\u2019s need lasts long\nenough to bring into existence and foster a desire to perpetuate this\nlife together and to awaken a lively sense of its advantages. A family\nthat lived in a region offering ready means of subsistence could\nincrease and become a tribe. (Lukes and Urbinati 2012: 9)\n\n\nThese passages were deleted in a later edition by Fran\u00e7ois\nArago who preferred to see them as inauthentic than as the product of\na collaboration between Condorcet and Grouchy.\n\nCondorcet\u2019s discussion of the importance of the family for human\nsociety in these first paragraphs does not lead, as one might expect,\nto further discussion of how the family develops, and how it\ninfluences the progress of humanity. But in Grouchy\u2019s 1795\nedition, the idea that studying families is important in order to\nunderstand human progress is reintroduced in the last pages\n(Condorcet, 1795, p.322):\n\n\nUntil now, political history, as indeed, the history of philosophy and\nof science has always been the history of a few men. But what the\nhuman species actually consists in, the families, subsisting nearly\nentirely from their labor, has been forgotten.(my translation)\n\n\nA history of families, Grouchy and Condorcet conclude, is what we need\nto study in order to truly understand human progress because focusing\non isolated individuals, exceptionally bred royalty, or heroes whose\npaths are exceptional, cannot give us an accurate picture of how\nhumanity in general changed through the ages.\n\nIf we take into account the influence of Sophie de Grouchy as his\ncollaborator, we can interpret this framing of the work with\nconsiderations about family life as hers. It does give the work a\ndistinctly proto-feminist flavor of the kind that goes beyond\nCondorcet\u2019s principles. Focusing on the family and its\nimportance for human development is crucial to the proper integration\nof women into the history of humanity and to make their lives central\nto any plans for future progress. Not only does it allow us to look\nbeyond the odd, isolated woman who against all historical odds\nsucceeded in asserting herself at the top of some discipline or other,\nbut it also reminds men that they have a life and a set of duties\nwithin the family unit, that they are not free individuals moving\nhistory along with the sheer force of their courage or intellect, but\nfathers who need to change a nappy and help their daughters with their\nhomework so that they too have a chance at participating in human\nprogress.\n",
