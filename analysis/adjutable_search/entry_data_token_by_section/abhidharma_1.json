    "main_text": "Abhidharma: its origins and texts || Literary style and genre\n1.1 Literary style and genre\n\nScholarly opinion has generally been divided between two alternative\ninterpretations of the term abhidharma, both of which hinge\nupon the denotation of the prefix abhi. First, taking\nabhi in the sense of \u201cwith regard to,\u201d\nabhidharma is understood as a discipline whose subject matter\nis the Dharma, the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Second, using\nabhi in the sense of preponderance and distinction,\nabhidharma has also been deemed a distinct, higher teaching;\nthe essence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings or that which goes beyond\nwhat is given in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, in a sense somewhat\nreminiscent of the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d (e.g.,\nDhs-a 2\u20133; Horner 1941; von Hin\u00fcber 1994).\nBuddhist tradition itself differentiates between the\nS\u016btr\u0101nta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings\nby contrasting the S\u016btr\u0101nta \u201cway of putting\nthings\u201d in partial, figurative terms that require further\nclarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that\nexpound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms (A IV\n449\u2013456; Dhs-a 154). This coincides with additional\ndistinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit\nmeaning (Skt., ney\u0101rtha, Pali, neyyattha)\nversus those that have explicit meaning (Skt.,\nn\u012bt\u0101rtha, Pali n\u012btattha) (A\nI 60; Ps I 18), and texts that are expressed in conventional\nterms (Skt., sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti, Pali, sammuti)\nversus others that are expressed in ultimate terms (Skt.,\nparam\u0101rtha, Pali, paramattha) (Vibh\n100\u2013101; Mp I\n 94\u201397).[4]\n From Abhidharma perspective, the s\u016btras were conveyed\nin conventional terms whose ultimate meaning required further\ninterpretation.\n\nThe texts of the canonical Abhidharma are works that evolved over\ndecades, if not centuries, out of materials already present in the\nS\u016btra and Vinaya portions of the canon. This is evidenced in two\ncharacteristics of the genre that can be traced to earlier Buddhist\nliterature. The first is the analytical style of the texts, which\nattempt to summarize meticulously the significant points of the Dharma\nand provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the mental and physical\nfactors that constitute sentient experience. This analytical\nenterprise includes the arrangement of major parts of the material\naround detailed lists of factors and combinations of sets of their\ncategories yielding matrices (Skt., m\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101,\nPali, m\u0101tik\u0101) of doctrinal topics. Already in the\ncollections of the Buddha\u2019s discourses, certain texts are\narranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment\nof doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Lists were clearly\npowerful mnemonic devices, and their prevalence in early Buddhist\nliterature can be explained partly as a consequence of its being\ncomposed and for some centuries preserved\n orally.[5]\n For instance, one of the four primary \u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas, the\ncollection of \u201cgrouped\u201d sayings\n(sa\u1e43yukta/sa\u1e43yutta), groups the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings according to specific topics, including the four noble\ntruths, the four ways of establishing mindfulness, the five\naggregates, the six sense faculties, the seven constituents of\nawakening, the noble eightfold path, the twelve links of dependent\norigination, and others. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of\ncontents of the Vibha\u1e45ga and\nPuggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti of the Therav\u0101da and the\nSa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya and Dharmaskandha of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, which are structured as commentaries on\nthose lists.\n\nThe second characteristic of Abhidharma literature is its bent for\ndiscursive hermeneutics through catechetical exposition. The texts\nseem to be the products of discussions about the doctrine within the\nearly Buddhist community. Again, such discussions are already found in\nthe \u0100gama/Nik\u0101ya collections (e.g., M I\n292\u2013305, III 202\u2013257): they often begin with a doctrinal\npoint to be clarified and proceed to expound the topic at stake using\na pedagogical method of question and answer. The texts also record\nmore formal methods of argumentation and refutation of rival theories\nthat shed light on the evolution of the Abhidharma as responding to\nthe demands of an increasingly polemical environment. The process of\ninstitutionalization undergone by Buddhist thought at the time and the\nspread of the Buddhist community across the Indian subcontinent\ncoincided with a transition from oral to written methods of textual\ntransmission and with the rise of monastic debates concerning the\ndoctrine among the various Buddhist schools. Intellectual assimilation\nand doctrinal disputes also existed between the Buddhist monastic\ncommunity and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and\nBrahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical\nmovements, which must also have contributed to the Abdhidharma\ndiscursive hermeneutics and argumentative style. The dialectic format\nand the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal\ninterpretation are the hallmarks of the Kath\u0101vatthu and\nthe Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya. Later on, post-canonical\nAbhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing\nsophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations\nthat resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their\ncanonical antecedents.\n\nAbhidharma literature, then, arose from two approaches to discussing\nthe Dharma within the early Buddhist community: the first intended to\nsummarize and analyze the significant points of the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings, the second to elaborate on and interpret the doctrines by\nmeans of monastic disputations (Bronkhorst 2016, 29\u201346; Cousins 1983,\n10; Dessein 2016, 4\u20137; Gethin 1992b, 165; Gethin 2022, 227\u2013242).\n",
