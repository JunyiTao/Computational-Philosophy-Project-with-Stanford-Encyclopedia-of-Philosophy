    "main_text": "God || The Intelligible World\n2.1 The Intelligible World\n\nThe intelligible world is the realm of Platonic objects that\nconstitutes the source and grounds of human knowledge. Malebranche\u2019s\naccount of the intelligible world is incomplete according to\nNorris:\n\nMalebranch has ventured the farthest of any that I know upon\nthe Discovery. He is indeed the great Galileo of the\nIntellectual World. He has given us the Point of View, and\nwhat ever farther Detections are made, it must be through his\nTelescope\u2026But even this great Apelles has\ndrawn this Celestial Beauty but half way, and I am afraid the\nexcellent Piece will Suffer, whatever other hand has the finishing of\nit. (Theory I 4)\n\n\nNorris considers his Theories I and II to be the\ncompletion of Malebranche\u2019s project. In Theory I, Norris\ndiscusses the nature of God, and in Theory II he discusses\nhow creation is related to God. The most substantial expansion upon\nMalebranche\u2019s thought occurs in the first part of this treatise, where\nNorris spends a great deal of time arguing that God is truth. The\nintelligible world is the mind of God, a \u201ckind of Terra\nIncognita, a more Intellectual America\u201d (3).\n\nNorris first argues for the existence of an ideal counterpart to\nnature. Since the world is created, \u201cit must of necessity\nreceive its Being from some other Being that was when it self was\nnot\u201d (18). He considers the nature of a being that is capable of\nbringing existence from absolute privation, and concludes such a being\nmust be infinitely powerful. Relying upon the premise that all action\nis guided by thought, and that God could not have thought about the\nworld because it did not exist at the time, Norris concludes the ideas\nthat guided God\u2019s thought in the creation of the world and its\ninhabitants must be \u201ctheir essential Reasons and Natures before\nthey had any in this, nay even from all Eternity\u2026and that there\nis an Intelligible as well as a Sensible World,\ntruly representative and exhibitive of this,\u201d or \u201c a fair\nintelligible Mirrour\u201d (26). The intelligible world is the\npattern or model of nature, \u201csince it could no more be its own\nExemplary or Formal, than Efficient\nCause\u201d (30).\n\nHis second argument for the intelligible world is from the existence\nof natural kinds. Norris asks \u201cWhy is not the Body of one Man as\nbig as the Globe of the Sun, while that of another is too small to be\nseen without a Microscope?\u201d and answers \u201c\u2019tis not\naccording to the Idea of that Creature that he should be\neither so big, or so little\u201d (39). This stance marks a\nnoteworthy departure from Malebranche, who claims God does not have\nparticular ideas of bodies in Elucidation 10 of the\nSearch. Norris\u2019 next argument begins with our understanding\nof perfect, geometrical objects. Norris says when he views \u201ca\nglobular Body I have naturally excited in me an Idea of a\nperfect Globe or Sphere\u201d (51). This implies the existence of an\nideal sphere because \u201cthe effect cannot have more perfection\nthan its Cause\u2026because the Cause cannot give that to the effect\nwhich it has not it self\u201d (52). Norris concludes that human\nthought of perfect circles proves an ideal circle exists as the cause\nof thought because there are none in nature.\n\nHis fourth argument comes from the nature of truth. Norris considers\nthe skeptic\u2019s claim that there is no absolute truth and turns the\ntable on the skeptic. If the skeptic is right, then there is no truth,\nwhich is itself an absolute truth. As such, the claim, \u2018There is\nno truth\u2019, would be a necessary and eternal truth:\n\nAnd besides when they go to prove this sceptical Position they must do\nit by pretending to lay the Grounds of it in Philosophic Principles\nand Maxims, which besides the Confession of such Principles would be\nto erect their scepticism as an Institution of Science, and then since\nall Science is of Necessary and Immutable things,\nand whatsoever is necessary and immutable is also Eternal, hence it\nfollows yet farther that they will by consequence and must allow not\nonly Truth in general, but also Eternal Truth, since both the\nConclusion which they pretend to prove, and the Principles whereby\nthey prove it, according to them must be such. (65)\n\n\nThere are eternal truths, as even the skeptic must admit, so there are\nalso eternal relations of ideas because truth relates ideas. In\nNorris\u2019 view, it is the divine ideas that are related. Truth is\ngrounded \u201cupon this necessity of Union and Connexion of Ideas in\ncertain Propositions\u201d (67). Norris adapts Suarez\u2019 view that all\nrelations are accidental, hence require a subject. Nonetheless, Norris\nargues that the eternal truths \u201care Real, and have an\nexistence out of, and independent upon the understanding\u201d (70).\nThe eternal truths derive their reality from the \u201cSimple\nEssences of things\u201d and these are the eternal divine ideas,\nwhich stand in Suarezian accidental relations to one another (71).\nNorris\u2019 fifth argument for the existence of divine ideas is that there\nare objective sciences concerning universals, such as metaphysics and\ngeometry. These disciplines concern necessary knowledge, \u201cto\nspeak more conformably to the School-language, in a knowledge acquired\nby Demonstration\u201d (128\u2013129). Since all science\nconcerns the necessary and unchanging, science cannot be about\ncontingent things, but about universals. These universals are the\nintelligible objects, or the divine ideas.\n\nNorris\u2019 final and sixth argument for the existence of the intelligible\nworld derives from the existence of God. Indeed, Norris views his own\nwork as the culmination of the project begun by Plato. A proper\nreading of the Timaeus will reveal Plato meant \u201cthe\nExemplaria rerum in mente Divina to be the Original Forms or\nPatterns of things in the divine Understanding\u201d rather than the\nstandard interpretation, which is that the creator consult and not be\nthe locus of abstract objects (139). If God has the ideas, then the\nintelligible world exists because God exists. God has the ideas in an\neminent manner (\u2018eminent\u2019 is discussed further below), and\nthese ideas are the objects of His thought. Relying upon the principle\nthat all knowledge is knowledge of something, Norris concludes that\nthe divine ideas are real objects in the mind of God. These ideas are\n\u201creally Coessential with and indistinct from the Essence of\nGod\u201d (155) so when God considers ideas, God considers himself.\nGod considers himself adequately and inadequately,\n\nAgain when he knows himself absolutely Speaking, he considers himself\nadequately, but in the knowledge of Creatures, or rather of\nhimself in relation to Creatures, he considers himself inadequately,\naccording to those degrees of Being or Perfection wherein his Essence\nis imitable or participable by them. (167)\n\n\nHe concludes his arguments for the existence of the intelligible world\nby stating that the ideal world is better known than the natural world\nbecause it is necessary, eternal and immutable. As Descartes had\nargued, the senses are part of the natural world and are designed to\nassist in preserving the union of soul and body, or to keep one alive,\nnot for delivering knowledge. The nature and existence of the\nintelligible world is discovered by intellectual activity; the highest\ndegree of intellectual activity is the clear and distinct\nperception.\n",
