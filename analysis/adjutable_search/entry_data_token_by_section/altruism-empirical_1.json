Defining \u201cEgoism\u201d and \u201cAltruism\u201d\u2014The Standard Account\n\nProviding definitions for \u201cegoism\u201d and\n\u201caltruism\u201d is a contentious matter, since these terms have\nbeen understood in radically different ways both in philosophy and in\nthe biological and social sciences. In this entry the focus will be on\nthe most widespread interpretation of\n\u201cegoism\u201d and \u201caltruism\u201d, understood as\ndescriptive claims about human psychology, within philosophy.\nWe\u2019ll call it \u201cthe standard account\u201d, versions of\nwhich have been offered by numerous authors including Broad (1950),\nFeinberg (1965 [1999]), Sober and Wilson (1998: Chs. 6 & 7),\nRachels (2003: Ch. 6), Joyce (2006: Ch. 1), Kitcher (2010, 2011: Ch.\n1), May (2011a), and many others. Not surprisingly, there are minor\ndifferences among the accounts provided by these authors, and those\ndifferences occasionally provoke disagreement in the literature. But\nall of them bear a strong family resemblance to the one we\u2019re\nabout to\n sketch.[5]\n\n\nAt the end of this section, a different account of altruism proposed\nin philosophy is briefly discussed. Biological accounts of altruism\nwill be considered in\n section 3,\n and accounts proposed by social scientists will be discussed in\n section 4.\n But our present focus is the standard philosophical account. \n\nAs already intimated, while advocates of altruism and of\negoism agree that people often help others, they disagree about\nwhy they do this. On the standard account, defenders of\naltruism insist that, sometimes at least, people are motivated by an\nultimate desire for the well-being of another person, while defenders\nof egoism maintain that all ultimate desires are self-interested. This\nformulation invites questions about (1) what it is for a behavior to\nbe motivated by an ultimate desire, and (2) the distinction\nbetween desires that are self-interested and desires for\nthe well-being of others.\n\nThe first question, regarding ultimate desires, can be usefully\nexplicated with the help of a familiar account of practical\n reasoning.[6]\n On this account, practical reasoning is a causal process via which a\ndesire and a belief give rise to or sustain another desire. For\nexample, a desire to drink an espresso and a belief that the best\nplace to get an espresso is at the espresso bar on Main Street may\ncause a desire to go to the espresso bar on Main Street. This desire\ncan then join forces with another belief to generate a third desire,\nand so on. Sometimes this process will lead to a desire to perform a\nrelatively simple or \u201cbasic\u201d action, and that desire, in\nturn, will cause the agent to perform the basic action without the\nintervention of any further desires. Desires produced or sustained by\nthis process of practical reasoning are instrumental\ndesires\u2014the agent has them because she thinks that satisfying\nthem will lead to something else that she desires. But not\nall desires can be instrumental desires. If we are to avoid\ncircularity or an infinite regress there must be some desires that are\nnot produced because the agent thinks that satisfying them\nwill facilitate satisfying some other desire. These desires that are\nnot produced or sustained by practical reasoning are the agent\u2019s\nultimate desires, and the objects of ultimate\ndesires\u2014the states of affairs desired\u2014are often said to be\ndesired \u201cfor their own sake\u201d. A behavior is\nmotivated by a specific ultimate desire when that desire is\npart of the practical reasoning process that leads to the\nbehavior.\n\nAlthough the second question, about the distinction between\nself-interested desires and desires for the well-being of others,\nwould require an extended discussion in any comprehensive treatment of\nthe debate between egoists and altruists, some rough and ready\nexamples of the distinction will suffice\n here.[7]\n The desires that another person\u2019s life be saved, that another\nperson\u2019s suffering be alleviated, or that another person be\nhappy are paradigm cases of desires for the well-being of others,\nwhile desires to experience pleasure, get rich, and become famous are\ntypical examples of self-interested desires. The self-interested\ndesires to experience pleasure and to avoid pain have played an\nespecially prominent role in the debate, since one version of egoism,\noften called hedonism, maintains that these are our\nonly ultimate desires. Stich et al. (2010) maintain that some\ndesires, like the desire that I myself be the one to\nalleviate my friend\u2019s suffering, are hard to classify, and\nconclude that both egoism and altruism are best viewed as somewhat\n vague.[8]\n\n\nWhether or not this is correct, it is clear that there are\nmany desires that are neither self-interested nor\ndesires for the well-being of others. One of the earliest examples was\nprovided by Bishop Joseph Butler (1726 [1887]) who noted that revenge\noften engenders malevolent desires, like the desire that another\nperson be harmed, which are obviously not desires for the well-being\nof the that person, and are not self-interested\n either.[9]\n Other examples include the desire that great works of art be\npreserved and the desire that space exploration be pursued. More\ninteresting for moral theory are the desire to do one\u2019s moral\nduty, and the desire to obey God\u2019s commandments. If people have\nultimate desires like these, then egoism is false. But, of\ncourse, the existence of ultimate desires like these would not show\nthat altruism is true. The take-away from such cases is that on the\nstandard account, egoism and altruism might both be\nmistaken.\n\nThough interpretations of \u201caltruism\u201d in the standard\naccount family predominate in the philosophical literature, some\nphilosophers use the term in a very different way. A paper by Thomas\nSchramme (2017) provides a clear example.\n\n\n[A]ltruism need not be reduced to its opposition to egoism. In this\nchapter, altruism is discussed as a psychological basis for moral\nconduct more generally, not just in terms of motivations to benefit\nothers. Here altruism stands for the capacity to take the\nmoral point of view and be disposed to act accordingly\u2026. Seen\nin this way, altruism is a short word for the psychological phenomenon\nof the internalized pull of morality\u2026 (2017: 203\u2013204).\n\n\nAltruism is then basically identical with taking the moral point of\nview, i.e., an individual appreciation of the normative force of\nmorality. (2017: 209).\n [10]\n\n\nSchramme is, of course, aware that many authors reject \u201csuch a\nclose connection of general moral motivation and altruistic\nmotivation\u201d but he maintains that this account of altruism\n\u201ccan certainly be found in the philosophical debate\u201d\n(2017: 209). Much the same claim is made by Badhwar (1993: 90):\n\nIn the moral philosophy of the last two centuries, altruism of one\nkind or another has typically been regarded as identical with moral\nconcern.\n\nSchramme is surely right that \n\n\n[t]he fact that we can understand altruism both as referring to moral\nbehavior quite generally and as restricted to a more specific set of\nhelping behaviors may lead to confusion. (2017: 204) \n\n\nThough some philosophers may believe there is a substantive dispute\nabout which account of altruism is correct, others think that\nthe issue is purely terminological. As noted earlier, the primary\nconcern in this entry is with what this entry dubs the \u201cstandard\naccount\u201d of altruism. But in the next two sections a number of\naccounts are considered that differ both from the standard account and\nfrom the account discussed by Schramme and Badhwar. \n",
