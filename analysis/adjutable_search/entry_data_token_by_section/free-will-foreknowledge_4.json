    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || God\u2019s forebeliefs as \u201csoft facts\u201d about the past\n2.4 God\u2019s forebeliefs as \u201csoft facts\u201d about the past\n\nThe next solution is due to the fourteenth century philosopher William\nof Ockham, and was revived in the contemporary literature by Marilyn\nAdams (1967). This solution rejects premise (2) of the basic argument\nin its full generality. Following Ockham, Adams argues that premise\n(2) applies only to the past strictly speaking, or the\n\u201chard\u201d past. A \u201csoft\u201d fact about the past is\none that is in part about the future. An example of a soft fact about\nthe past would be the fact that it was true yesterday that a certain\nevent would occur a year later, or the fact that you saw Paris for the\nlast time. Adams argues that God\u2019s existence in the past and\nGod\u2019s past beliefs about the future are not strictly past\nbecause they are facts that are in part about the future.\n\nAdams\u2019s argument was unsuccessful since, among other things, her\ncriterion for being a hard fact had the consequence that no fact is a\nhard fact (Fischer 1989, introduction), but it led to a series of\nattempts to bolster it by giving more refined definitions of a\n\u201chard fact\u201d and the type of necessity such facts are said\nto have\u2014what Ockham called \u201caccidental necessity\u201d\n(necessity per accidens). The resulting formulations became\nso refined and elaborate, in an effort to avoid possible\ncounterexamples, that they risked becoming detached from the simple\nintuition they were intended to capture. Recent discussions of the\nhard fact/soft fact distinction may be found in Todd (2013) and\nPendergraft and Coates (2014). Plantinga (1986) argued that a\nsuccessful Ockhamist response to theological fatalism needn\u2019t\nawait the definitive formulation of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for soft facthood, because paradigm examples of soft\nfacts--facts that are surely soft, if any facts are soft--are enough\nfor the job. It\u2019s clear that proposition T, for\nexample--that you will answer the phone tomorrow at 9 am--does not\nexpress a hard fact about the past. (It doesn\u2019t express a fact\nabout the past at all.) But if God is necessarily existent and\nessentially omniscient, this fact about what you will do tomorrow both\nentails, and is entailed by, God\u2019s yesterday believing\nT. Assuming that hard and soft facthood are closed under\nlogical equivalence, it follows that God\u2019s having believed\nT is not a hard fact about yesterday, a conclusion that\ndoesn\u2019t rely on any particular answer to the general question\nhow the hard fact/soft fact distinction is to be articulated.\nResponses to this defense of Ockhamism may be found in Brant (1997)\nand Hunt (2002).\n\nThere was considerable debate over Ockhamism in the eighties and\nnineties. Some of the defenses in this period appear in Freddoso\n(1983), Kvanvig (1986), Plantinga (1986), Wierenga (1989), and Craig\n(1990). Some of the criticisms appear in Fischer (1983, 1985a, 1991),\nHasker (1989), Widerker (1990), Zagzebski (1991), and Pike (1993). The\nOckhamist strategy, relying as it does on the distinction between\nfacts about the past that are really about the past and facts about\nthe past that are really (at least in part) about the future, is\nintertwined with work on the reality of the past and future. Finch and\nRea (2008) have argued that the Ockhamist solution requires the\nrejection of presentism.\n\nPerhaps the toughest obstacle confronting the Ockhamist solution is\nthat it is very difficult to give an account of the necessity of the\npast that preserves the intuition that the past has a special kind of\nnecessity in virtue of being past, but which has the consequence that\nGod\u2019s past beliefs do not have that kind of necessity. The\nproblem is that God\u2019s past beliefs seem to be as good a\ncandidate for something that is strictly past as almost anything we\ncan think of, such as an explosion that occurred last week. If\nGod\u2019s past beliefs about the future are soft facts, but the past\nexplosion is a hard fact, that must be because of something special\nabout God\u2019s past beliefs that is intuitively plausible apart\nfrom the attempt to avoid theological fatalism. Perhaps God\u2019s\ndoxastic states are best understood in terms of \u201cwide\ncontent\u201d or a functionalist account of the mental (Zemach and\nWiderker 1987); perhaps divine omniscience is dispositional rather\nthan occurrent (Hunt 1995), or doesn\u2019t involve beliefs at\nall (Alston 1986). If God\u2019s foreknowledge is special in any of\nthese ways, premise (2) is arguably false. But there are theological\ncosts to these conceptions of divine omniscience. The appeal to\nPutnam\u2019s point that \u201cmeanings ain\u2019t in the\nhead\u201d conflicts with the \u201cincompatibilist\nconstraint\u201d in Fischer (1983); see also Hasker (1988) for a\nresponse to Alston, and Hughes (1997) for a response to Hunt. Since\nthese accounts of divine foreknowledge aren\u2019t independently\nplausible, however interesting they might be theoretically, it is hard\nto avoid the conclusion that the Ockhamist solution is ad\nhoc.\n",
