    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n9. Metaphysics\n\nBolzano\u2019s most important metaphysical doctrines are found in his\nAthanasia (Bolzano 1827), in the Paradoxes of the\nInfinite (Bolzano 1851), and in his writings that he left\nunpublished; Bolzano\u2019s pupil P\u0159\u00edhonsk\u00fd,\nmoreover, gave an exposition of Bolzano\u2019s Atomism\n(P\u0159\u00edhonsk\u00fd1857). Athanasia was first\npublished anonymously (in 1827), its second edition appeared in 1838\nwith a statement of authorship. Its full title \u201cAthanasia or\nReasons for the Immortality of the Soul\u201d makes clear that the\nbook pursues a theoretical goal. Bolzano combines with this\ntheoretical goal of the book a practical purpose as well; it is also a\n\u201cbook of consolation\u201d or (as the subtitle of the second\nedition says) \u201ca book for every educated person who wants peace\nof mind regarding this matter\u201d.\n\nFrom traditional metaphysics Bolzano adopts the doctrine that\neverything real is either a substance or an adherence (cf. Schnieder\n2002). Substances are either themselves simple or composed of simple\nsubstances; simple substances (i.e., monads, according to Leibniz) are\ncalled \u2018atoms\u2019 by Bolzano. The soul is a simple substance.\nBolzano attempts to prove that no simple substance can begin or cease\nto be (in time). This attempt at a proof on Bolzano\u2019s part,\nhowever, is deficient, as he himself observed. From this brief sketch\nit is already evident that Bolzano\u2019s metaphysical views bore a\ndefinite stamp from the tradition, especially from Leibniz. In\ncontrast with Leibniz\u2019s doctrine of the\n\u201cwindowlessness\u201d of the monads and of the pre-established\nharmony that this requires, however, Bolzano assumes an interaction\namong the finite atoms or monads. (Cf. Bolzano 1827, 48\u201350, 67,\n92 f., 114 f., 2nd edition: 421, 441; Bolzano 1851, reprint 1975: 112\nf., 118, E: Russ 2004, 666 f., 670; P\u0159\u00edhonsk\u00fd 1857,\n7.)\n\nEvery attribute of a real object is itself something real. An\nadherence is an attribute of something real, i.e., of a substance or\nof another adherence. The adherences of a human being or of a mind\nmust therefore themselves belong to World 2 or World 1. They are\ntherefore particulars and not universals. This view is supported by\nBolzano\u2019s claim that each \u201cprivate\u201d mental\nphenomenon, such as a feeling, a desire, a volition or a thought\n(i.e., a subjective idea or a subjective proposition), is an attribute\nof the individual mind that \u201chas\u201d it, where\n\u2018has\u2019 expresses the copula (WL II, 69). It is a particular\nattribute of an individual (or, in today\u2019s terminology, a trope)\nthat cannot be shared by any other individual: if both, \\([A_1\\) has\n\\(b]\\) and \\([A_2\\) has \\(b]\\), are true and \\(b\\) is a subjective\nidea or any other mental phenomenon, then \\(A_1\\) must be identical\nwith \\(A_2\\). Bolzano\u2019s theory of propositions, however, conveys\nthe impression that attributes are universals. For in the standard\nexamples he gives for a true proposition \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\), the\nattribute \\(b\\) is a universal, such as erudition, that can be shared\nby different objects (WL I, 130). Obviously, we must admit that some\nof Bolzano\u2019s attributes are universals and others are\nparticulars. In this case, however, the word \u2018has\u2019, which\nexpresses the copula of each proposition according to Bolzano, is used\nambiguously by him.\n\nBolzano connected his metaphysical views with the physical doctrines\nof his time (see section 10). Nevertheless his metaphysical doctrines\nstrike us \u2014 at least at first glance \u2014 as rather backward.\nThis reproach seems to be justified with respect to the\nAthanasia. In his other writings (in particular in his\nTheory of Science), however, Bolzano developed quite modern\nmetaphysical ideas that come close to views of today\u2019s analytic\nontology (cf. Berg 1992) and mereology (cf. Krickel 1995). For\nexample, according to the analysis of propositions that Bolzano\ndeveloped in his theory of science, a time qualification is required\nin the subject idea of every proposition whose subject (i.e., the\nobject of its subject idea) is a real thing (WL I, 113, 202, 364 f.,\nWL II, 15). This condition is required in order to avoid\n\u201cHegelian\u201d contradictions in cases where the object the\nproposition is about (i.e., its subject) undergoes a change. Sometimes\nBolzano restricts this requirement to propositions in which a\nnon-permanent property is attributed to a changeable substance (WL II,\n239), since this is sufficient for avoiding the aforementioned\ncontradictions. Due to this proposal, the proposition [Cajus at time\n\\(t_1\\) has erudition] and the proposition [Cajus at time \\(t_2\\) has\nlack of erudition] can both be true as long as \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) are\ndifferent; for if \\(t_1\\) is different from \\(t_2\\), then the ideas\n[Cajus at time \\(t_1\\)] and [Cajus at time \\(t_2\\)] have different\nobjects (WL I, 202, 365). These remarks indicate that Bolzano\nconceived of changeable substances such as Cajus as four-dimensional\nobjects, extended in space and time. An idea such as [Cajus at time\n\\(t_1\\)] can pick out a time slice of the four-dimensional Cajus; such\na time slice or momentary object as Cajus at time \\(t_1\\) is also an\nobject for Bolzano, but ontologically it is secondary. Considerations\nsuch as these result in Bolzano\u2019s proposal to use this property\nfor the definition of time: Time is for Bolzano the condition or\nqualification that is required in order to make a proposition about a\n(changeable) real object true or false (WL I, 365).\n",
