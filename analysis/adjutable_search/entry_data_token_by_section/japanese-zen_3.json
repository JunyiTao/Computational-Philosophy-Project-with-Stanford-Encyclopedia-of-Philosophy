    "main_text": "The Practice: Three-Step Process || The Adjustment of the Body\n3.1 The Adjustment of the Body\n\nGenerally speaking, the adjustment of the body means to prepare\noneself (one\u2019s mind-body) in such a way that one can achieve an\noptimal state of being free. To do so, the practitioner needs to have\na proper diet, engage in appropriate physical exercise, and avoid\nforming habits contrary to nurturing a healthy mind-body condition.\nSpecifically, however, when Zen mentions the adjustment of the body,\nit has in mind seated meditation postures. There are two postures\nwhich Zen recognizes: the lotus-posture and the half-lotus posture. A\nlong Zen tradition takes them to be effective for stilling the mind\nand dissolving various psychological complexes and psychosomatic\ndisorders. However, if a lay practitioner cannot at first assume these\npostures, they can be substituted initially by sitting on a chair with\nthe spine straight, as it can bring about a similar effect. The\nadjustment of the body is necessary for the practitioner in order to\nexperience the practical benefits of doing meditation.\n",
