    "main_text": "Sources of Knowledge and Justification || Reason\n5.4 Reason\n\nSome beliefs are (thought to be) justified independently of\nexperience. Justification of that kind is said to be a\npriori. A standard way of defining a priori\njustification is as follows:\n\n\nA Priori Justification\n\nS is justified a priori in believing that p if\nand only if S\u2019s justification for believing that p\ndoes not depend on any experience.\n\n\nWhen they are knowledgeably held, beliefs justified in this way are\ninstances of a priori\n knowledge.[58]\n\nWhat exactly counts as experience? If by \u201cexperience\u201d we\nmean just perceptual experiences, justification deriving from\nintrospective or memorial experiences would count as a\npriori. For example, I could then know a priori that\nI\u2019m thirsty, or what I ate for breakfast this morning. While the\nterm \u201ca priori\u201d is sometimes used in this way,\nthe strict use of the term restricts a priori justification\nto justification derived solely from the use of reason.\nAccording to this usage, the word \u201cexperiences\u201d in the\ndefinition above includes perceptual, introspective, and memorial\nexperiences alike. On this narrower understanding, paragons of what I\ncan know a priori are conceptual truths (such as \u201cAll\nbachelors are unmarried\u201d), and truths of mathematics, geometry\nand logic.\n\nJustification and knowledge that is not a priori is called\n\u201ca posteriori\u201d or \u201cempirical\u201d. For\nexample, in the narrow sense of \u201ca priori\u201d,\nwhether I\u2019m thirsty or not is something I know empirically (on\nthe basis of introspective experiences), whereas I know a\npriori that 12 divided by 3 is 4.\n\nSeveral important issues arise about a priori knowledge.\nFirst, does it exist at all? Skeptics about apriority deny its\nexistence. They don\u2019t mean to say that we have no knowledge of\nmathematics, geometry, logic, and conceptual truths. Rather, what they\nclaim is that all such knowledge is\n empirical.[59]\n\nSecond, if a priori justification is possible, exactly what\ndoes it involve? What makes a belief such as \u201cAll\nbachelors are unmarried\u201d justified? Is it an unmediated grasp of\nthe truth of this proposition? Or does it consist of grasping that the\nproposition is necessarily true? Or is it the purely\nintellectual state of \u201cseeing\u201d (with the \u201ceye of\nreason\u201d) or \u201cintuiting\u201d that this proposition is\ntrue (or necessarily true)? (see Bengson 2015 and Chudnoff 2013 for\nsophisticated defenses of this view). Or is it, as externalists would\nsuggest, the reliability of the cognitive process by which we come to\nrecognize the truth of such a proposition?\n\nThird, if a priori knowledge exists, what is its extent?\nEmpiricists have argued that a priori knowledge is\nlimited to the realm of the analytic, consisting of\npropositions true solely by virtue of our concepts, and so do not\nconvey any information about the world. Propositions that convey\ngenuine information about world are called synthetic. a\npriori knowledge of synthetic propositions, empiricists would\nsay, is not possible. Rationalists deny this. They might\nappeal to a proposition such as \u201cIf a ball is green all over,\nthen it doesn\u2019t have black spots\u201d as an example of a\nproposition that is both synthetic and yet knowable a priori\n(see Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009 and Malmgren 2011 for a discussion of\nthe content of such a priori justified judgments; for\nliterature on a priori knowledge, see BonJour 1998, BonJour\nin BonJour & Devitt 2005 [2013]; Boghossian and Peacocke 2000;\nCasullo 2003; Jenkins 2008, 2014; and Devitt 2014).\n",
