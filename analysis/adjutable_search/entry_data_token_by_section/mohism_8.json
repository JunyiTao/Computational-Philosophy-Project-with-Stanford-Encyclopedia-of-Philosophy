    "main_text": "Religion\n9. Historical Influence and Decline\n\n\nThe Mohists can be credited with a number of significant philosophical\nachievements, including China\u2019s first ethical and political theories\nand history\u2019s earliest form of consequentialism.  They strive for but\ndo not quite achieve a viable account of an impartial, objectively\njustified moral code. Both their insights and their errors are of\ngreat philosophical interest. Their ethical theory has important\ndefects, but one of its major strengths is that these could probably\nbe remedied without abandoning the basic structure of the theory.\n\n\nMohism never achieved a position of dominance or orthodoxy, but at\nits peak in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, no school was more\ninfluential. This status is attested by no less an authority than\nMencius, who lamented that \u201cthe statements of Mo Di and Yang Zhu\n[another rival thinker] fill the world,\u201d and by the attention Xunzi\ndevotes to refuting Mohist economic doctrines. Though their importance\nis routinely slighted in Confucian-biased accounts of Chinese thought,\nthe Mohists articulated much of the theoretical framework of early\nChinese epistemology, logic, political theory, and ethics. Their ideas\nwere a crucial stimulus for Mencius, Xunzi, the Daoists, and the\nso-called \u201clegalist\u201d political thinkers, all of whom either borrowed\nMohist ideas or developed their own views partly in reaction to them.\nOne sign of the Mohists\u2019 status is that their shared critics typically\npaired them with the Confucians (Ru) as a bloc, referring to\nthe two as Ru-Mo, the two \u201cmoralizing\u201d schools devoted to\nren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness). Confucianism owes an\nunacknowledged debt to Mohism for its notion of comprehensive moral\nconcern, as reflected, for instance, in Mencius\u2019s doctrine of extending\nour natural concern for kin so that it reaches everyone. The phrase\n\u201cinclusive care\u201d begins to appear in Confucian texts toward the end of\nthe Warring States era \u2014 a late passage in the Xunzi refers\nto \u201ccomprehensive benefit and inclusive care\u201d (Book 25) \u2014 and by the\nHan dynasty, we find the Confucian Gongsun Hong explaining the virtue\nof ren (benevolence) in explicitly Mohist terms, as \u201cextending\nbenefit and eliminating harm, inclusively caring without partiality\u201d\n(Han Shu, Vol.\n 58).[18]\n\n\nWith few exceptions, Chinese thought after the Han turned away from\nthe Mohists\u2019 epistemological, semantic, and logical interests to focus\non moral metaphysics and moral psychology, thus passing over what might\nhave been their chief legacy. Hence Mohism is sometimes depicted as a\nsplinter movement not genuinely representative of the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition. This view is false and anachronistic, however.\nMuch of what is plausible or intriguing in Mohist thought directly\nreflects concepts, assumptions, and problems that were elements of\nmainstream Warring States intellectual discourse.\n\n\nFollowing the unification of China under the Qin dynasty\n(221\u2013207 BCE), the Mohist movement declined, eventually\nvanishing altogether by the middle of the Western Han (206\nBCE\u201324 CE). After Confucianism won imperial favor in 136\nBCE, Confucius gradually came to be venerated as China\u2019s greatest\nsage. Mozi and his school fell into neglect and obscurity, their texts\nlargely unread. Centuries later, the bulk of the Mozi was\nnearly lost to history, surviving only because it had been copied into\na massive collection of Daoist scripture. Interest in Mohism revived\nonly late in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911 CE), when scholars,\nstimulated partly by contact with the West, went looking for untapped\nintellectual resources in their own tradition, particularly materials\nrelated to science and logic.\n\n\nA number of factors can be cited to explain Mohism\u2019s decline and\ndisappearance. Graham is probably right, for instance, to suggest that\nafter the Qin unification, the Mohists lost the political influence\nthey had exerted as expert craftsmen and defense specialists who\nhelped smaller states survive during the Warring States era (1989,\np. 34). But the major factor is probably that as a social and\nphilosophical movement, Mohism gradually collapsed into\nirrelevance. By the middle of the former Han dynasty, the more\nappealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival\nschools. Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into\nConfucianism, though in a modified and unsystematic form. Key features\nof their political philosophy were probably shared with most other\npolitical thinkers, and their trademark opposition to warfare had been\nrendered effectively redundant by unification. The philosophy of\nlanguage, epistemology, metaphysics, and science of\nthe later\n Mohist Canons\n were recorded in difficult, dense texts\nthat would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers (and that\nin any case quickly became corrupt). What remained as distinctively\nMohist was a package of harsh, unappealing economic and cultural\nviews, such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of\nmusic and ritual. Compared with the classical learning and rituals of\nthe Confucians, the speculative metaphysics of Yin-Yang thinkers, and\nthe romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the\nDaoists, Mohism offered little to attract adherents, especially\npolitically powerful ones.\n\n\nThe Mohists helped to articulate much of the framework of classical\nChinese philosophical discourse while advocating a way of life so at\nodds with most people\u2019s conception of the good life that it stood\nlittle chance of ever inspiring a wide following. The school had\nalways shown undue enthusiasm for radical, simplistic\npositions. Unwilling or unable to modify their doctrines or to develop\nnew positions in response to their changing social and intellectual\nsetting, the Mohists probably died out in the imperial era because\ntheir Warring States reformist social and political platform had\nbecome obsolete.\n",
