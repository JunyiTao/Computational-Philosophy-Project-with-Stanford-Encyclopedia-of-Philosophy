Discontinuous Change and the Leibniz Continuity Condition\n\n\nIf the LCC is to have a chance of being applicable, then it needs\nfurther restriction, beyond atomic sentences and their negations. This\nis because it has implausible consequences when applied to certain\natomic sentences. Consider any increasing function \\(f(t)\\). Then\nsentences of the form \\(f(t) \\lt f(a)\\) will hold for \\(t \\lt a\\). By\nthe LCC then, \\(f(a) \\lt f(a)\\). This is surely a gratuitous\nconclusion even before the contradicting sentence \\(-f(a) \\lt f(a)\\)\nis taken into account. The present author (1997) therefore proposed to\nrestrict the application to the atomic sentences of equational\ntheories, that is to sentences of the form \\(f(t) = 0\\). This is not\nso unreasonable on independent grounds, since the basic laws of nature\nare expressed in equational form.\n\n\nSo restricted, we can note that far from being unreasonable, it turns\nout that the LCC is satisfied in a large class of reasonable models,\nspecifically the C-infinity worlds mentioned earlier, in which every\nfunction is continuous. These include all those of GR. Now a\nC-infinity world gives us a kind of half-way house for cause. It\nmight be that all correlations are coincidences, but at least if\nfunctions are continuous then causation is a distinctive correlation\nin that it is transmitted locally. This can be applied beneficially\nto produce not a general account of inconsistent change, but a\nparticular account of certain inconsistent changes, as follows.\n\n\nQuantum measurement has long been problematic, for more than one\nreason. One reason has been that it represents an irreducibly\ndifferent kind of process from Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. Another is that\nit is change which is discontinuous and yet causal: one can make\nthings to happen with measurement, even though one cannot determine\nthe exact outcome. A third reason is nonlocality itself: the nonlocal\nis ipso facto the discontinuous, and yet the nonlocal is\ngoverned by a kind of statistical causality. But now, to settle at\nleast some of these issues, it has been proposed to utilise the\ntheory of inconsistent continuous functions. These arise when a\nfunction is classically discontinuous, but we inconsistently identify\nthe limit of the function (assuming it has a limit) with its value at\nthe limit. Such functions, by virtue of being continuous, can be\nshown to satisfy the LCC. But granted that the formal details exist,\nwhat reason is there to apply them? It is precisely that we want to\npreserve a degree of causality, that is LCC-causality, while yet\nretaining the essential discontinuity and unpredictability of the\nprocess. Thus the slogan \u201cnonlocality is inconsistent\nlocality,\u201d which is intended not to apply to change in general\nbut to discontinuous change which we nonetheless have reason to think\nof as causal.\n",
