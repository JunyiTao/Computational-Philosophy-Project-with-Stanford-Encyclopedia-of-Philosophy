    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Sexual Activity\n1.2 Sexual Activity\n\nIt is difficult to define \u201csexual act\u201d or \u201csexual\nactivity.\u201d Various proposed criteria face difficulties (Soble\n2006a). This is especially so when closely related concepts (e.g.,\n\u201chaving sex\u201d) do not have the same extension. In ordinary\nlanguage use, and according to some studies, people distinguish\nbetween having sex and sexual activity; they count many activities as\nsexual but not as having sex, such as solo masturbation, cyber-sex,\nand even oral sex (Soble 2006a,: 15\u201316). Solo masturbation\ncounts as sexual activity and as a sexual act, but not as having sex,\nthough Soble has recently argued that solo masturbation is on a\ncontinuum with other forms of sexual activity, both physically and\npsychologically (2022a). There are a few criteria to define\n\u201csexual activity\u201d (Soble 2006a). One criterion is\nreproduction: for an activity to be sexual it has to be or aim at\nbeing reproductive. This faces obvious counter-examples, such as\nsame-sex sexual activities and heterosexual oral and anal sex (Soble\n2006a, 18\u201319). Another criterion is bodily contact: sexual\nactivities are those that involve contact with sexual body parts\n(though we need to figure out what these parts are). This fails as a\nsufficient condition (doctors sometimes have to touch patients\u2019\ngenitals) and as a necessary one (achieving orgasm during a phone-sex\nchat) (Soble 2006a, 19\u201320).\n\nSexual pleasure is a third criterion: \u201cThose activities \u2026\nare sexual \u2026 which give rise to sexual pleasure\u201d (Gray\n1978, 191\u2013192). But the production of sexual pleasure is not\nnecessary because many acts do not produce such pleasure; and this\ncriterion conceptually rules out non-pleasurable sex (Soble 2006a,\n21\u201322). It might also not be sufficient: a man might see someone\non the street and feel a twinge of sexual pleasure (Soble 1996, 130).\nThe presence of sexual pleasure in this case does not suffice for the\nman\u2019s experience to be sexual activity (perhaps if the man\ncontinues to look the experience becomes a sexual activity because of\nhis intention to keep looking; Soble 1996, 130).\n\nAnother criterion is intention, though we need to figure out what the\nintention is for. One reasonable candidate is \u201cthe intention to\nproduce sexual pleasure in oneself or in another.\u201d But this is\nnot necessary: two people who have sexual intercourse to procreate\nengage in a sexual act. The experience, if any, of sexual pleasure is\na by-product of the action (Soble 1996, 132). This criterion\nis also not sufficient. Suppose that X intends to produce\nsexual pleasure in Y by \u201cwhistling\n\u2018Dixie\u2019,\u201d but what X does is not a sexual\nact (Soble 2006a, 22).\n\nAnother criterion for defining \u201csexual activity\u201d is sexual\ndesire:\n\n\nsexual desire is desire for contact with another person\u2019s body\nand for the pleasure which such contact produces; sexual activity is\nactivity which tends to fulfill such desire of the agent. (Goldman\n1977, 268)\n\n\nA \u201csexual act\u201d (or \u201cactivity\u201d, in\nGoldman\u2019s terms) is activity \u201cwhich tends to\nfulfill\u201d sexual desire.\n\nThe definition sounds right: what else is a sexual act if not\none that satisfies or \u201ctends to\u201d satisfy sexual desire?\nBut it faces counter-examples. Consider a sex worker performing\nfellatio on a man: while fellatio fulfills or tends to fulfill the\nman\u2019s sexual desire, it does not fulfill or tend to fulfill the\nsex worker\u2019s sexual desire if she does not desire the client (as\nis often the case). Thus satisfying sexual desire is not necessary for\nan activity to be sexual. Whether it is sufficient depends on what we\nmean by \u201csatisfaction\u201d or \u201cfulfillment.\u201d If it\nmeans \u201cthe desire is no longer felt for the time being\u201d or\n\u201cthe desire is gone,\u201d satisfying sexual desire would\nnot be sufficient. Taking a cold shower, a powerful sleeping\npill, or even focusing on something else might get rid of the sexual\ndesire, yet these activities are not sexual. If \u201csatisfying\nsexual desire\u201d means, \u201cthe desire achieves its goal\u201d\n(which is sexual fulfillment), satisfying sexual desire by a\nparticular activity would be sufficient for that activity to\nbe sexual, but the definition becomes circular. The criterion of\nsexual desire, then, does not succeed in defining \u201csexual\nact\u201d.\n\nBy the above criteria, a definition of \u201csexual activity\u201d\nis hard to find. One crucial reason might be that what we commonly\nthink is a sexual act does not depend on one criterion: behavior,\nintentions, contact with specific body parts, etc., play a role\ndepending on the context. This reason motivates a disjunctive\ndefinition, according to which an activity is sexual if and only if it\nis done from a sexual motive, it tends to fulfill sexual desire, it\ninvolves contact with the genitalia (or sexual body parts) or one or\nmore of the parties to the activity, or it behaviorally fits\nparadigmatic cases of sexual activity (this is just one example of a\ndisjunctive definition). Whether such a definition succeeds depends on\nvarious factors, such as that each disjunct is itself philosophically\nunproblematic, the list of disjuncts is exhaustive, and the definition\nis not too unwieldy to be plausible or useful.\n\nAnother reason why a definition of sexual activity is hard to find\n(and one that might go against a disjunctive definition) is that there\nare many concepts closely related to each other that nonetheless\ncommonly mean different things. \u201cTo have sex\u201d or \u201cto\nengage in sex\u201d almost always refer to sexual activity with at\nleast one more person, whereas \u201cengaging in a sexual\nactivity\u201d and \u201chaving a sexual experience\u201d do not\nhave this reference, and they are not common expressions. Thus,\ndefining these concepts is tricky if we want the definitions to agree\nwith common linguistic usage, or if we rely on such usage to formulate\nthese definitions. More worrisome, if we need to define these concepts\nfor help with practical, moral, and legal issues, the rift between\nthem and common language should give us pause.\n",
