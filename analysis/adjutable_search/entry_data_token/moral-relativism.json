Historical Background\n\nThough moral relativism did not become a prominent topic in philosophy\nor elsewhere until the twentieth century, it has ancient origins. In\nthe classical Greek world, both the historian Herodotus and the\nsophist Protagoras appeared to endorse some form of relativism (the\nlatter attracted the attention of Plato in the Theaetetus).\nIt should also be noted that the ancient Chinese Daoist philosopher\nZhuangzi put forward a nonobjectivist view that is sometimes\ninterpreted as a kind of relativism.\n\nAmong the ancient Greek philosophers, moral diversity was widely\nacknowledged, but the more common nonobjectivist reaction was moral\nskepticism, the view that there is no moral knowledge (the position of\nthe Pyrrhonian skeptic Sextus Empiricus), rather than moral\nrelativism, the view that moral truth or justification is relative to\na culture or society. This pattern continued through most of the\nhistory of Western philosophy. There were certainly occasional\ndiscussions of moral disagreement\u2014for example in Michel de\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays or in the dialogue David Hume\nattached to An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.\nThese discussions pertained to moral objectivity, but moral relativism\nas a thesis explicitly distinguished from moral skepticism ordinarily\nwas not in focus. Prior to the twentieth century, moral philosophers\ndid not generally feel obliged to defend a position on moral\nrelativism.\n\nNonetheless, the increased awareness of moral diversity (especially\nbetween Western and non-Western cultures) on the part of Europeans in\nthe modern era is an important antecedent to the contemporary concern\nwith moral relativism. During this time, the predominant view among\nEuropeans and their colonial progeny was that their moral values were\nsuperior to the moral values of other cultures. Few thought all moral\nvalues had equal or relative validity, or anything of that sort. The\nmain impetus for such a position came from cultural anthropology.\nAnthropologists were fascinated with the diversity of cultures, and\nthey produced detailed empirical studies of them\u2014especially\n\u201cprimitive,\u201d non-Western ones. At the beginning\nanthropologists accepted the assumption of European or Western\nsuperiority. But this assumption began to be challenged in the\ntwentieth century, especially by some social scientists in the United\nStates. An early dissent came from the sociologist William Graham\nSumner, who proposed a version of moral relativism in his 1906\nFolkways. But the most influential challenge originated with\nthe anthropologist Franz Boas. He and his students\u2014in\nparticular, Ruth Benedict, Melville J. Herskovits, and Margaret\nMead\u2014explicitly articulated influential forms of moral\nrelativism in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1947, on the\noccasion of the United Nations debate about universal human rights,\nthe American Anthropological Association issued a statement declaring\nthat moral values are relative to cultures and that there is no way of\nshowing that the values of one culture are better than those of\nanother. Anthropologists have never been unanimous in asserting this,\nand more recently human rights advocacy on the part of some\nanthropologists has mitigated the relativist orientation of the\ndiscipline. Nonetheless, prominent anthropologists such as Richard A.\nShweder and the late Clifford Geertz have defended relativist\npositions in recent years.\n\nAn important early bridge from anthropology to philosophy was\nestablished by Edward Westermarck (1906\u20138 and 1932), a social\nscientist who wrote anthropological and philosophical works defending\nforms of empirical as well as metaethical moral relativism. In the\nlatter half of the 20th century, moral philosophers began devoting\nconsiderable attention to moral relativism and some\u2014most notably\nRichard B. Brandt (1954) and John Ladd (1957)\u2014took quite\nseriously the empirical effort of anthropology to understand the\nmoralities of different cultures, to the point of making such\nempirical inquiries themselves (an anticipation of the recent emphasis\non experimental philosophy, to be discussed in\n section 3).\n In the past several decades there has been increasing consideration\nof moral relativism, and there is now an enormous literature on the\nsubject (the Bibliography below is very limited). Most of these\ndiscussions are situated in the domain of \u201cpure\nmetaethics,\u201d but not all. For example, there is considerable\nwork on moral relativism in connection with human rights (Donnelly\n2013, part 2 and Okin 1998), political philosophy (Accetti 2015,\nBilgrami 2011 and Long 2004) and feminist philosophy (Code 1995\nand Khader 2019). There are also discussions of moral relativism in\napplied fields such as medical ethics (Earp 2016).\n2. Forms and Arguments\n\nIn general, the term \u2018relativism\u2019 refers to many different\nideas. For example, in anthropology it sometimes connotes, among other\nthings, the rather uncontroversial notion that anthropologists should\nstrive to be impartial and unprejudiced in their empirical inquires.\nHowever, in moral philosophy \u2018relativism\u2019 is usually taken\nto suggest an empirical, a metaethical, or a normative position. The\nempirical position is usually:\n\nDescriptive Moral Relativism (DMR). As a matter of\nempirical fact, there are deep and widespread moral disagreements\nacross different societies, and these disagreements are much more\nsignificant than whatever agreements there may be.\n\n\nSometimes what is emphasized is moral diversity rather than strict\ndisagreement. DMR is often thought to have been established\nby anthropology and other empirical disciplines. However, it is not\nuncontroversial: Empirical as well as philosophical objections have\nbeen raised against it. Hence, it is one focal point of debate.\n\nThe metaethical position usually concerns the truth or justification\nof moral judgments, and it has been given somewhat different\ndefinitions. Metaethical relativists generally suppose that many\nfundamental moral disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, and on\nthis basis they argue that moral judgments lack the moral authority or\nnormative force that moral objectivists usually contend these\njudgments may have. Hence, metaethical relativism is in part a\nnegative thesis that challenges the claims of moral objectivists.\nHowever, it often involves a positive thesis as well, namely that\nmoral judgments nonetheless have moral authority or normative force,\nnot absolutely or universally (as objectivists contend), but relative\nto some group of persons such as a society or culture. This point is\ntypically made with respect to truth or justification (or both), and\nthe following definition will be a useful reference point:\n\nMetaethical Moral Relativism (MMR). The truth or\nfalsity of moral judgments, or their justification, is not absolute or\nuniversal, but is relative to the traditions, convictions, or\npractices of a group of persons.\n\n\nWith respect to truth-value, this means that a moral judgment such as\n\u2018Polygamy is morally wrong\u2019 may be true relative to one\nsociety, but false relative to another. It is not true, or false,\nsimply speaking. Likewise, with respect to justification, this\njudgment may be justified in one society, but not another. Taken in\none way, this last point is uncontroversial: The people in one society\nmay have different evidence available to them than the people in the\nother society. But proponents of MMR usually have something\nstronger and more provocative in mind: That the standards of\njustification in the two societies may differ from one another and\nthat there is no rational basis for resolving these differences. This\nis why the justification of moral judgments is relative rather than\nabsolute.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of different\nformulations of relativism (for discussion of some of these, see\nFricker 2013, Krausz 2011 and L\u00f3pez de Sa 2011). It is\nimportant to note several distinctions that may be made in formulating\ndifferent metaethical relativist positions. First, a distinction is\nsometimes drawn between content relativism, the view that sentences\nmay have different contents (meanings) in different frameworks, and\ntruth relativism, the view that sentences have the same content in\ndifferent frameworks, but their truth-value may vary across these\nframeworks (for a discussion of this distinction in terms of moral\nrelativism, see Prinz 2007: 180\u20133). In the discussions that follow,\ntruth relativism is ordinarily assumed. Second, it is sometimes said\nthat the truth or justification of moral judgments may be relative to\nan individual person as well as a group of persons. In this article,\nthe latter will be assumed, as in the definition of MMR,\nunless otherwise noted. Third, that to which truth or justification is\nrelative may be the persons making the moral judgments or the persons\nabout whom the judgments are made. These are sometimes called\nappraiser and agent relativism respectively. Appraiser relativism\nsuggests that we do or should make moral judgments on the basis of our\nown standards, while agent relativism implies that the relevant\nstandards are those of the persons we are judging (of course, in some\ncases these may coincide). Appraiser relativism is the more common\nposition, and it will usually be assumed in the discussion that\nfollows. Finally, MMR may be offered as the best explanation\nof what people already believe, or it may be put forward as a position\npeople ought to accept regardless of what they now believe. There will\nbe occasion to discuss both claims below, though the latter is\nprobably the more common one.\n\nMetaethical moral relativist positions are typically contrasted with\nmoral objectivism. Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that\nmoral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or\nuniversal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes\nare justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false\nones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and\nwell-informed person. There are different ways of challenging moral\nobjectivism. Moral skepticism says that we are never justified in\naccepting or rejecting moral judgments. Other views\u2014variously\ncalled moral non-cognitivism, expressivism, anti-realism, nihilism,\netc.\u2014contend that moral judgments lack truth-value, at least\nbeyond the truth-value implied by the minimalist claim that to assert\nthat S is true is simply to assert S (a related view, the error\ntheory, claims that moral judgments are always false). MMR is\noften distinguished from all of these views: Instead of denying\ntruth-value or justification, it affirms relative forms of these.\nHowever, metaethical moral relativist views are sometimes regarded as\nconnected with positions that say moral judgments lack truth-value,\nsince the relativist views contend that moral judgments lack\ntruth-value in an absolute or universal sense. This is sometimes\nsimply a question of terminology, but not always. If it is said that\nmoral judgments lack truth-value (beyond the claim of minimalism),\nthen there cannot be relative truth-value in the sense that moral\nrelativists usually intend (though it might be contended that there is\na sense in which there could still be justification). As will be seen\nbelow, there is a debate about the relationship between MMR\nand non-cognitivist or expressivist positions.\n\nMost arguments for MMR are based on DMR and the\ncontention that it is implausible to suppose fundamental moral\ndisagreements can always be resolved rationally (for overviews of\nthese arguments, see Plakias 2020 and Seipel 2020b). Sometimes it is\nsaid that some moral disagreements are faultless, meaning that neither\nparty has made a mistake (see K\u00f6lbel 2004). For instance, Harman\n(1996), Prinz (2007) and Wong (1984 and 2006) have all stressed the\nimportance of moral disagreements in arguing for MMR, and\nsuch arguments will be considered in some detail in subsequent\nsections. However, some arguments for MMR have a rather\ndifferent approach, and two of these should be noted here.\n\nFirst, MMR might be defended as a consequence of the general\nrelativist thesis that the truth or justification of all\njudgments is not absolute or universal, but relative to some group of\npersons. For example, this general position might be maintained on the\nground that each society has its own conceptual framework and that\nconceptual frameworks are incommensurable with one another. Hence, we\ncan only speak of truth or justification in relative terms (see the\ndiscussion of incommensurability in the Summer 2015 archived version\nof the entry on\n relativism\n (section 4.2)). This position might be thought to have the\ndisadvantage that it can only be put forward as true or justified\nrelative to some conceptual framework (the suggestion is usually that\nthis framework is our own), and many find it implausible with regard\nto common sense judgments and judgments in the natural sciences.\nHowever, this is one avenue to MMR. But most proponents of\nMMR focus on distinctive features of morality and reject\ngeneral relativism. In fact, they often contrast morality and science\nwith respect to issues of truth and justification. For example, Harman\n(2000b), Prinz (2007) and Wong (1996 and 2006) all associate moral\nrelativism with naturalism, a position that usually presupposes the\nobjectivity of the natural sciences.\n\nSecond, a metaethical moral relativist position might be defended by\nemphasizing aspects of morality other than disagreement. For example,\nRovane (2011 and 2013) has maintained that relativism is best\nunderstood, not as a response to disagreement, but as a response to\nalternative conceptual schemes that portray different worlds that are\nnormatively insulated from one another. On this account, the\ntruth-bearers in one world are not logically related to the\ntruth-bearers in another world (so there cannot be strict\ndisagreement), and yet it is not possible to embrace both worlds (so\nthey are alternatives). Rovane argues that in the moral domain, but\nnot in the domain of the natural sciences, there may be different\nworlds in this sense. Hence, a moral judgment may be true for the\noccupant of one world, but not for the occupant of another. An\nimplication of this view, she says, is that learning and teaching\nacross different moral worlds might not be possible.\n\nIn a partially similar view, Velleman (2015) has claimed, on the basis\nof ethnographic and historical data, that different communities\nconstruct available action types differently. Moreover, reasons for\naction are always dependent on the perspective of the particular\ncommunity since they arise out of the drive for mutual\ninterpretability needed for social life within the community. Hence,\nthere are no perspective-independent reasons. There cannot be\nstraight-forward disagreement across these communities because they do\nnot have common sets of action types. The communities may nonetheless\naddress the basic themes of morality, but in incompatible ways given\ntheir different perspectives. So moralities can only have local\nvalidity.\n\nBoth Rovane and Velleman stress moral diversity rather than moral\ndisagreement. They maintain, not that disagreements cannot be\nrationally resolved, but that there is no basis for showing that,\namong various incompatible alternatives, one is rationally superior to\nanother.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting that MMR is sometimes\njustified by appealing in a significant way to a distinctive analysis\nof moral judgments in combination with a claim about moral\ndisagreement. For example, Prinz (2007) argues that what he calls\n\u201cmoral sentimentalism\u201d implies a form of MMR once\nwe acknowledge moral disagreements. According to moral sentimentalism,\nan action is morally right (wrong) if and only if some observer of the\naction has a sentiment of approbation (disapprobation) concerning it.\nPrinz defends this position on the basis of a metaethical argument\nthat it is the most plausible account in light of empirical studies\nlinking moral judgments and emotions. Since people often have\nconflicting sentiments about the same action, a judgment of the form\n\u2018Action X is right\u2019 may be true (when expressed\nby a person who approves of X), and \u2018X is\nwrong\u2019 may also be true (when expressed by a person who\ndisapproves of X). On this view, the truth of such moral\njudgments is relative to the sentiments of the persons who make them.\nMoral sentimentalism is a crucial feature of this argument and many\nphilosophers would deny that moral rightness and wrongness depend on\nour sentiments in this way. But most arguments for MMR are\nnot based on moral sentimentalism.\n\nIn another example, Harman (2000a) argues that a moral judgment that a\nperson ought to do X (an \u201cinner judgment\u201d)\nimplies that the person has motivating reasons to do X, and\nthat a person is likely to have such reasons only if he or she has\nimplicitly entered into an agreement with others about what to do.\nHence, moral judgments of this kind are valid only for groups of\npersons who have made such agreements. An action may be right relative\nto one agreement and wrong relative to another (this combines agent\nand appraisal relativism insofar as Harman assumes that the person\nmaking the judgment and the person to whom the judgment is addressed\nare both parties to the agreement).\n\nHarman\u2019s relativism is presented as a thesis about logical form,\nbut the relativist implication arises only because it is supposed that\nthe relevant motivating reasons are not universal and so probably\narose from an agreement that some but not all persons have made. In\nthis sense, moral disagreement is an important feature of the\nargument. But the main focus is on the internalist idea that inner\njudgments imply motivating reasons, reasons that are not provided\nsimply by being rational, but require particular desires or intentions\nthat a person may or may not have. Internalism in this sense is a\ncontroversial view, and many would say that a moral judgment can apply\nto a person whether or not that person is motivated to follow it (see\nthe section on \u2018Psychological: Moral Motivation\u2019 in the\nentry on\n moral epistemology).\n However, internalism is not a standard feature of most arguments for\nmoral relativism, and in fact some relativists are critical of\ninternalism (for example, see Wong 2006: ch. 7)\n\nIt is worth noting that internalism is one expression of a more\ngeneral viewpoint that emphasizes the action-guiding character of\nmoral judgments. Though Harman and others (for example, Dreier 1990\nand 2006) have argued that a form of moral relativism provides the\nbest explanation of internalism, a more common argument has been that\nthe action-guiding character of moral judgments is best explained by a\nnon-cognitivist or expressivist account according to which moral\njudgments lack truth-value (at least beyond the claim of minimalism).\nIn fact, some have claimed that the expressivist position avoids, and\nis superior to, moral relativism because it accounts for the\naction-guiding character of moral judgments without taking on the\nproblems that moral relativism is thought to involve (for instance,\nsee Blackburn 1998: ch. 9 and 1999, and Horgan and Timmons 2006). By\ncontrast, others have maintained that positions such as\nnon-cognitivism and expressivism are committed to a form of moral\nrelativism (for example, see Bloomfield 2003, Foot 2002b, and\nShafer-Landau 2003: ch 1). For an assessment of this debate, see\nMiller 2011, and for a discussion of non-cognitivism and related\npositions, see the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n\nFinally, the term \u2018moral relativism\u2019 is sometimes\nassociated with a normative position concerning how we ought to think\nabout, or behave towards, persons with whom we morally disagree.\nUsually the position is formulated in terms of tolerance. In\nparticular, it is said that we should not interfere with the actions\nof persons that are based on moral judgments we reject, when the\ndisagreement is not or cannot be rationally resolved. This is thought\nto apply especially to relationships between our society and those\nsocieties with which we have significant moral disagreements. Since\ntolerance so-understood is a normative thesis about what we morally\nought to do, it is best regarded, not as a form of moral relativism\nper se, but as a thesis that has often been thought to be\nimplied by relativist positions such as DMR and MMR.\nDespite the popularity of this thought, most philosophers believe it\nis mistaken. The main question is what philosophical relationship, if\nany, obtains between moral relativism and tolerance.\n\nThe remainder of this entry will discuss DMR, the contention\nthat it is unlikely that fundamental moral disagreements can be\nrationally resolved, arguments for and challenges to MMR,\nmixed positions that combine moral relativism and moral objectivism,\nand the relationship between moral relativism and tolerance. But first\nthere needs to be some consideration of the recent contributions of\nexperimental philosophy to these discussions.\n3. Experimental Philosophy\n\nExperimental philosophy is an approach to philosophy that explicitly\ndraws on experimental knowledge established by the sciences to address\nphilosophical questions (see the entry on\n experimental moral philosophy).\n There are three significant ways in which experimental philosophy has\nplayed an important role in discussions of moral relativism. These\nconcern the extent to which there is moral disagreement or moral\ndiversity among people (that is, DMR), the extent to which\nfolk morality is committed to an objectivist or relativist\nunderstanding of moral judgments (that is, the views of ordinary\npeople concerning MMR), and the extent to which acceptance of\nmoral relativism affects moral attitudes such as tolerance (that is,\nways in which views concerning MMR causally influence whether\nor not people have tolerant attitudes).\n\nThe first of these has a long history in discussions of moral\nrelativism and in fact may be considered one of the earliest instances\nof experimental moral philosophy. As was seen in\n section 1,\n for more than a century the work of anthropologists and other social\nscientists has contributed to the development of thought about moral\nrelativism, both by purporting to provide empirical evidence for\nextensive cross-cultural disagreement and diversity about morality,\nand by proposing the notion that moral codes are true only relative to\na culture as the best explanation of this. That is, these scientists\nhave provided empirical grounds for accepting DMR, and they\nhave suggested that some form of MMR is a reasonable\ninference from this data (though these positions were not always\nclearly distinguished). More importantly, the work cited in\n section 1\n by Brandt (1954) and Ladd (1957), involving both empirical\ninvestigations into the moral values of Native Americans and\nphilosophical reflection on the significance of these investigations\nvis-\u00e0-vis moral relativism, are significant examples of moral\nphilosophers engaging in empirical inquiry in support of philosophical\naims. Their empirical work did not immediately inspire other other\nphilosophers to engage in similar research. Experimental philosophy in\nthis sense\u2014experiments or other empirical investigations conducted by\nphilosophers\u2014did not become prominent until nearly a half-century\nlater. Nowadays philosophers do sometimes conduct experiments to\ninvestigate the extent of moral disagreement (for example, see the\nstudy of Western and East Asian values cited in Doris and Plakias\n2008). What has been much more common in recent decades has been the\ncitation by philosophers of empirical studies by anthropologists to\nestablish facts about moral disagreement or diversity (for example,\nsee Prinz 2007, Velleman 2015, and Wong 1984 and 2006). There has been\na renewed interest in ethics by some anthropologists in the last few\nyears (see Klenk 2019 and Laidlaw 2017), but this has not yet\nattracted much attention by philosophers. There is more about these\nissues in\n section 4.\n\nThe second concern, the extent to which ordinary people accept some\nform of moral objectivism or some form of MMR (or some other\nnon-objectivist position), has been the subject of considerable\nexperimental research in recent years. This research has sometimes\nbeen conducted by psychologists (or other scientists), sometimes by\nphilosophers, and increasingly sometimes by both working together (for\noverviews of this literature, see P\u00f6lzler and Wright 2019 and\nSarkissian 2016). In the past, philosophers with a variety of\nmeta-ethical commitments have sometimes claimed that in everyday moral\npractices people implicitly suppose that moral objectivism in some\nsense is correct (for example, see Blackburn 1984: 180 and Jackson\n1998: 137). By contrast, on occasion some philosophers have maintained\nthat ordinary people sometimes have attitudes that conflict with\nobjectivism. For instance, Wong has argued that in some moral\ndisagreements people grant that the person with the conflicting moral\njudgment is reasonable in accepting the judgment to the extent that\nthese people are unsure if their own position is uniquely right\u2014what\nhe calls \u201cmoral ambivalence\u201d (see Wong 2006: ch. 1). So\nwho are correct, philosophers who claim that ordinary people accept a\nform of objectivism (folk moral objectivism) or philosophers who think\nthat ordinary people at least sometimes accept something closer to\nMMR (folk moral relativism)?\n\nRecent empirical research suggests that both positions may have some\nmerit: the meta-ethical views of ordinary people are rather complex. A\ncommon method for measuring whether people are objectivists or\nrelativists about a moral statement is to present them with a\ndisagreement between two parties concerning the statement and to\nask them if at most only one party could be correct. A response that\nonly one could be correct indicates commitment to objectivism, while a\nresponse that more than one could be correct suggests commitment to\nrelativism (or some non-objectivist position). Several studies\nemploying this and related methodologies have provided evidence\nthat, while many people are objectivists about morality, a significant\nnumber are not objectivists (for example, see Nichols 2004). Moreover,\nsome studies have shown interesting correlations with these\ndifferences. For instance, being in a competitive rather than\ncooperative interaction and belief in a punishing God correlate\nwith more objectivist intuitions (see Fisher et al. 2017 and\nSarkissian and Phelan 2019) while openness to experience and to\nalternative possibilities are more common among those with\nnon-objectivist intuitions (see Feltz and Cokely 2008 and Goodwin and\nDarley 2010). In addition, some studies purport to show that there may\nbe causal relationships as well as correlations. For example, the\ndesire to punish generates objectivist intuitions (see Rose and\nNichols Forthcoming).\n\nOther studies have shown different kinds of complexity. People are\nmore likely to be objectivists about some moral issues (such as\nrobbery) than they are about other moral issues (such as abortion).\nThese differences also have correlations that might be partly\nexplanatory: regarding an issue as objective correlates with strength\nof belief and perception of consensus on the issue (see Goodwin and\nDarley 2008 and 2010; cf. Ayars and Nichols 2020). Moreover, people\nare more likely to be objectivists about some issues than others even\nwhen they are allowed to determine for themselves which issues count\nas moral issues (see Wright et al. 2013).\n\nFinally, it is more more probable that people give objectivist\nresponses when they think that the parties to a moral disagreement\nshare the same culture than when they think that the disagreeing\nparties belong to a very different culture. This might suggest that\nmany of those who give objectivist responses are tacitly assuming a\nkind of objectivity on the assumption that the disagreeing parties\nhave a common moral framework, but not in circumstances in which there\nare different moral frameworks (see Sarkissian et al. 2011).\n\nIn short, empirical work about folk meta-ethical outlooks suggests\nthat there is considerable diversity in the extent to which, and the\ncircumstances under which, people express moral objectivist views or\nmoral non-objectivist views such as MMR. This might be taken\nto indicate that some people are objectivists and some are not. But it\nmight also be taken to show that some people are \u201cmeta-ethical\npluralists\u201d: they are objectivists about some moral issues, but\nthey are relativists about other moral issues (see P\u00f6lzler\n2017, Wright 2018, and Wright, Grandjean and McWhite 2013).\nThat is, perhaps some people implicitly deny the common assumption\namong philosophers that all moral beliefs should be given the same\nmeta-ethical analysis.\n\nVarious questions may be raised about the value and significance of\nthis experimental work. In recent years an important issue in\npsychology has been the extent to which experimental results can be\nreplicated. It has been argued that the replication rate in\nexperimental philosophy is comparatively high (see Cova et al.\n2018) and some studies of people\u2019s acceptance of moral\nobjectivity have been replicated (for example, see Wright 2018).\nAnother issue is whether the samples of these studies are sufficiently\ndiverse to be indicative of the meta-ethical commitments of all human\nbeings. Once again, there have been concerns that psychology studies\nhave been unrepresentative (for example, because they rely too heavily\non undergraduate students in the United States). However, at\nleast some studies pertaining to moral objectivity have included a\nmore diverse group of subjects (for example, Beebe et al. 2015\nand Sarkissian et al. 2011). A different question is to what\nextent these studies actually measure acceptance of moral objectivism\nor  moral relativism. Many studies focus on moral objectivism and\nthese may leave unclear people\u2019s views about a position such as\nMMR (Since there are a variety of positions that reject objectivism).\nHowever, some studies have focused on moral relativism specifically\n(for example, Sarkissian et al. 2011).\n\nIn any case, some philosophers may wonder about the philosophical\nrelevance of this experimental research. One response is that it could\naffect criteria of success in meta-ethics. For example, it is\nsometimes suggested that most people are moral objectivists rather\nthan moral relativists, and that a meta-ethical position such as moral\nrealism gains credibility because it is in accord with folk morality\nso understood (see Smith 1991). The studies just cited and others\nappear to challenge the factual premise of this meta-ethical criterion\n(see Sarkissian 2017), and it has been argued that the best\ninterpretation of the empirical data is that many people accept a form\nof relativism (see Beebe Forthcoming). Another response is that some\nof the complexity revealed in these studies might lead philosophers to\nconsider more seriously the philosophical viability of a pluralist or\nmixed meta-ethical position according to which, for instance, moral\nobjectivism is correct in some respects, but MMR is correct\nin other respects (in this connection, see Gill 2008 and\nSinnott-Armstrong 2009). There is more on this issue in\n section 7.\n In any case, there is increasing recognition of the importance of\ninterpreting the significance of the experimental evidence for\nmeta-ethics with care (see Bush and Moss 2020, Hopster 2019\nand P\u00f6lzler and Wright 2020).\n\nThe final area in which experimental philosophy has contributed to\ndiscussions of moral relativism pertains to the relationship between\nrelativism and moral attitudes such as tolerance. It is sometimes\nclaimed that some forms of moral relativism provide a reason for\ntolerance (see\n section 8).\n But are moral relativists more likely to be tolerant than moral\nobjectivists? Some recent psychological studies suggest that the\nanswer may be \u201cyes.\u201d There is some correlation between\naccepting moral relativism and being\nmore tolerant (Collier-Spruel et al. 2019), and there\nis some correlation between regarding a moral issue as objective\nand being less tolerant (Wright et al. 2008 and 2014),\nthough it is also clear that other factors are relevant to whether\nbehavior is tolerant or intolerant.\n\nInsofar as these studies suggest that there is some correlation\nbetween acceptance of moral relativism and tolerance, this might be\nregarded as an unsurprising result for those who have argued that\nmoral relativism provides a rational basis for tolerance. Of course, a\npsychological relationship does not show that there is a logical\nrelationship. But some support might be derived from the fact that\npeople are behaving in what, for this position, is a rational way. In\naddition, it has been claimed that an advantage of moral relativism is\nthat, even though it does not provide a reason for tolerance,\nacceptance of it makes people more tolerant (see Prinz 2007: 208).\nThese studies would provide support for this empirical claim.\n4. Descriptive Moral Relativism\n\nMost discussions of moral relativism begin with, and are rooted\nin, DMR. Though this is not sufficient to establish\nMMR, the most common rationales for MMR would be\nundermined if DMR (or some descriptive thesis about\nsignificant moral disagreement or diversity) were incorrect. Moreover,\nif DMR were generally rejected, it is likely that\nMMR would have few proponents. Hence, it is important to\nconsider whether or not DMR is correct. Defenders of\nDMR usually take it to be well-established by cultural\nanthropology and other empirically-based disciplines, and many believe\nit is obvious to anyone with an elementary understanding of the\nhistory and cultures of the world. Examples of moral practices that\nappear sharply at odds with moral outlooks common in the United States\nare not hard to come by: polygamy, arranged marriages, suicide as a\nrequirement of honor or widowhood, severe punishments for blasphemy or\nadultery, female circumcision or genital mutilation (as it is\nvariously called), and so on (for a review of some of the literature,\nsee Prinz 2007: 187\u201395). At a more general level, Wong (1984) has\nargued that at least two different approaches to morality may be found\nin the world: a virtue-centered morality that emphasizes the good of\nthe community, and a rights-centered morality that stresses the value\nof individual freedom.\n\nThough it is obvious that there are some moral disagreements, it is\nanother matter to say that these disagreements are deep and\nwidespread, and that they are much more significant than whatever\nagreements there may be. Philosophers have raised two kinds of\nobjection to this contention: a priori arguments that\nDMR could not be true, and a posteriori arguments\nthat DMR is probably not true or at least has not been\nestablished to be true.\n\nA priori objections maintain that we can know DMR is\nfalse on the basis of philosophical considerations, without recourse\nto empirical evidence. One argument, expressed in general form by\nDonald Davidson (1984a), states that disagreement presupposes\nconsiderable agreement (see the entry on\n Donald Davidson).  \nAccording to Davidson, a methodological constraint on the translation\nof the language of another society is that we must think they agree\nwith us on most matters. For example, suppose we believed there were\nnumerous disagreements between us and another society about trees. As\nthe disagreements piled up, we reasonably would begin to think we had\nmistranslated a word in the language of the other society as\n\u2018tree\u2019: It is more likely that (what we take to be) their\nfalse beliefs about trees are really beliefs about something else. By\ngeneralization, it follows that there could not be extensive\ndisagreements about trees between our society and the other one. Of\ncourse, there could be some disagreements. But these disagreements\nwould presuppose substantial agreements in other respects. Davidson\n(1984b [2004a] and 1995 [2004b]) and others (for example, Cooper 1978\nand Myers 2004) have claimed that this argument applies to moral\nconcepts. If they are right, then there cannot be extensive\ndisagreements about morality, and the agreements are more significant\nthan the disagreements. DMR cannot be true.\n\nDavidson\u2019s argument is controversial. One response is that, even\nif it were compelling in some cases, it would not have force with\nrespect to moral concepts. \u2018Tree\u2019 is an ordinary,\ndescriptive concept based on direct observation. In view of this,\nmistranslation seems more likely than substantial disagreement. But\nwhat about concepts concerning what is amusing, interesting, or\nexciting? These have to do with human reactions to the world, and it\nmay be said that our knowledge of human nature suggests that some\nreactions vary widely. A claim that there is much disagreement about\nwhat people find amusing\u2014about what makes them laugh\u2014does\nnot immediately generate the suspicion of mistranslation. If moral\nconcepts were more similar to \u2018amusing\u2019 than to\n\u2018tree\u2019, as some believe, then the Davidsonian argument\nmight not undermine DMR even if it were convincing in other\ncases. Davidson, however, believed the argument applies across the\nboard, to evaluations as well as empirical beliefs. Another response\nto his argument is to claim that, even if it does apply to\nevaluations, it would only apply to very basic ones and would leave\nroom for substantial disagreements beyond these (if this were the\ncase, then Davidson would have established only what I call a mixed\nposition in\n section 7).\n For some critical responses to the Davidsonian critique of\nrelativism, see Gowans 2004: 144\u20136, Prinz 2007: 195\u20139 and\nRovane 2013: 247\u201362.\n\nAnother a priori objection to DMR was suggested by\nPhilippa Foot (1978a and 1978b) in a response to emotivism. Just as\nthere are shared criteria of \u2018rude\u2019 such that not just\nanything could be considered rude, she argued, there are shared\ncriteria of moral concepts such that not just anything could be a\nmoral virtue or obligation. For example, there are substantial\nconstraints on what could be considered courage. Hence, there are\nsignificant limits to the extent of moral disagreements.\n\nOne response to this argument, interpreted as an objection to\nDMR, is that it faces a dilemma. On the one hand, if\n\u2018courage\u2019 is understood broadly, in terms of confronting a\ndifficulty to achieve some perceived good, then it is likely that most\neveryone values courage. However, this leaves room for very different\nconceptions of courage. Both warriors and pacifists may value it, but\nthey may regard very different kinds of actions as courageous. This\nputs less pressure on DMR, a point Foot later conceded to\nsome extent (see\n section 7)).\n On the other hand, if courage is defined narrowly, for example, as\nthe virtue of a warrior who faces the threat of death in battle (as\nsuggested by Aristotle), then there may be little disagreement about\nthe scope of the concept, but considerable disagreement about whether\ncourage so-defined should be valued (pacifists would say no). A\nproponent of DMR might say that this is also a significant\nmoral disagreement. Against this, it may be said that our\nunderstanding of human nature and culture shows that everyone values\ncourage understood within some fairly significant limits. This is a\nmore empirical point, in line with the objections in the last\nparagraph of this section.\n\nSome versions of the a priori approach emphasize the\nconstraints imposed by \u201cthinner\u201d moral concepts such as\ngoodness, rightness, or morality itself (for example, see Garcia\n1988). Once again, a defender of DMR might say that, if these\nconcepts have enough content to preclude significant disagreement in\ntheir application, then it is likely that many societies do not apply\nthem at all\u2014a form of moral disagreement in itself. Another\nresponse would be to argue, following R.M. Hare (1981), that a formal\nanalysis, for example in terms of a kind of prescriptivity, is\nplausible with respect to some thinner moral concepts, and that this\nis consistent with significant moral disagreements. However, the a\npriori critics question the adequacy of any such analysis. Much\nof this debate concerns the acceptability of formal versus material\ndefinitions of morality (see the entry on the\n definition of morality).\n\nThe second approach to rejecting DMR focuses on the\ninterpretation of the empirical evidence that purportedly supports\nthis thesis. Some objections point to obstacles that face any attempt\nto understand human cultures empirically. For example, it may be said\nthat the supposed evidence is incomplete or inaccurate because the\nobservers are biased. In support of this, it may be claimed that\nanthropologists often have had preconceptions rooted in disciplinary\nparadigms or political ideologies that have led them to misrepresent\nor misinterpret the empirical data. Or it may be said that even the\nmost objective observers would have difficulty accurately\nunderstanding a society\u2019s actual moral values on account of\nphenomena such as self-deception and weakness of will. These concerns\npoint to substantial issues in the methodology of the social sciences.\nHowever, even if they were valid, they would only cast doubt on\nwhether DMR had been established: They would not necessarily\ngive us reason to think it is false. Of course, this would be an\nimportant objection to someone who claims DMR is established\nor relies on DMR to argue for MMR.\n\nAnother objection, more directly pertinent to DMR, is that\nanthropologists have tacitly and mistakenly assumed that cultures are\nrather discrete, homogenous, and static entities\u2014rather like the\nshapes in a Piet Mondrian painting or a checkerboard. In fact,\naccording to this contention, cultures typically are rather\nheterogeneous and complex internally, with many dissenting voices.\nMoreover, they often interact and sometimes influence one another, and\nthey may change over time. From this perspective, the world of\ncultures is closer to an animated Jackson Pollock painting than to the\nunambiguous configuration suggested by the first image. If these\ncontentions were correct, then it would be more difficult to know the\nmoral values of different cultures and hence to know whether or not\nDMR is true. As before, this would not show that it is false\n(in fact, the point about heterogeneity might point the other way).\nHowever, we will see later that these contentions also pose challenges\nto MMR.\n\nOther critics try to establish that the empirical evidence cited in\nsupport of DMR does not really show that there are\nsignificant moral disagreements, and is consistent with considerable\nmoral agreement. A prominent contention is that purported moral\ndisagreements may result from applying a general moral value (about\nwhich there is no disagreement) in different circumstances or in the\nsame circumstances where there is a factual disagreement about what\nthese circumstances are. Either way, there is no real moral\ndisagreement in these cases. For example, everyone might agree on the\nimportance of promoting human welfare (and even on the nature of human\nwelfare). But this may be promoted differently in different, or\ndifferently understood, circumstances. Another contention is that\nmoral disagreements may be explained by religious disagreements: It is\nonly because specific religious assumptions are made (for instance,\nabout the soul) that there are moral disagreements. Once again, the\napparent moral disagreement is really a disagreement of a different\nkind\u2014here, about the nature of the soul. There is no genuine\nmoral disagreement. Of course, these possibilities would have to be\nestablished as the best explanation of the disagreements in question\nto constitute an objection to DMR.\n\nFinally, some objections maintain that proponents of DMR fail\nto recognize that there is significant empirical evidence for\nconsiderable moral agreement across different societies (see\nSauer 2019). Several kinds of agreement have been proposed. For\nexample, the role-reversal test implied by the Golden Rule (\u201cDo\nunto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d) has been\nprominent beyond Western traditions: A version of it is also endorsed\nin The Analects of Confucius, some traditional Buddhist\ntexts, and elsewhere (see Wattles 1996). Another form of this claim\nmaintains that basic moral prohibitions against lying, stealing,\nadultery, killing human beings, etc. are found across many different\nand otherwise diverse societies. Yet another contention is that the\ninternational human rights movement indicates substantial moral\nagreement (see Donnelly 2013: ch. 4). On the basis of evidence of this\nkind, some such as Sissela Bok (1995) and Michael Walzer (1994) have\nproposed that there is a universal minimal morality, whatever other\nmoral differences there may be. In a similar vein, Hans K\u00fcng\n(1996) and others have maintained that there is a common \u201cglobal\nethic\u201d across the world\u2019s major religious traditions\nregarding respect for human life, distributive justice, truthfulness,\nand the moral equality of men and women. These contentions, which have\nreceived increased support in recent years, must be subjected to the\nsame critical scrutiny as those put forward in support of\nDMR. However, if they were correct, they would cast doubt on\nDMR. In the final analysis, there may be significant\nagreements as well as disagreements in people\u2019s moral values. If\nthis were the case, it would complicate the empirical background of\nthe metaethical debate, and it might suggest the need for more nuanced\nalternatives than the standard positions.\n5. Are Moral Disagreements Rationally Resolvable?\n\nPhilosophers generally agree that, even if DMR were true\nwithout qualification, it would not directly follow that MMR\nis true. In particular, if moral disagreements could be resolved\nrationally for the most part, then disagreement-based arguments for\nMMR would be undermined, and there would be little incentive\nto endorse the position. Such resolvability, at least in principle, is\nwhat moral objectivism would lead us to expect. One of the main points\nof contention between proponents of MMR and their objectivist\ncritics concerns the possibility of rationally resolving moral\ndisagreements. It might be thought that the defender of MMR\nneeds to show conclusively that the moral disagreements identified in\nDMR cannot be rationally resolved, or again that the moral\nobjectivist must show conclusively that they can be. Neither is a\nreasonable expectation. Indeed, it is unclear what would count as\nconclusively arguing for either conclusion. The center of the debate\nconcerns what plausibly may be expected. Adherents of MMR\nattempt to show why rational resolution is an unlikely prospect, while\ntheir objectivist critics try to show why to a large extent this is\nlikely, or at least not unlikely.\n\nMoral objectivists can allow that there are special cases in which\nmoral disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, for example on\naccount of vagueness or indeterminacy in the concepts involved. Their\nmain claim is that ordinarily there is a rational basis for overcoming\ndisagreements (not that people would actually come to agree).\nObjectivists maintain that, typically, at least one party in a moral\ndisagreement accepts the moral judgment on account of some factual or\nlogical mistake, and that revealing such mistakes would be sufficient\nto rationally resolve the disagreement. They suggest that whatever\ngenuine moral disagreements there are usually can be resolved in this\nfashion. In addition, objectivists sometimes offer an analysis of why\npeople make such mistakes. For example, people may be influenced by\npassion, prejudice, ideology, self-interest, and the like. In general,\nobjectivists think, insofar as people set these influences aside, and\nare reasonable and well-informed, there is generally a basis for\nresolving their moral differences. However, though these claims are\noften made, it is another matter to establish empirically that\nself-interest is the source of disagreement, and it has been argued\nthat there are considerable obstacles to doing this (see Seipel\n2020a). (Objectivists might also say that at least some agreements\nabout moral truths reflect the fact that, with respect to matters\npertaining to these truths, people generally have been reasonable and\nwell-informed.)\n\nProponents of MMR may allow that moral disagreements\nsometimes are rationally resolved. In particular, they may grant that\nthis often happens when the parties to a moral dispute share a moral\nframework. The characteristic relativist contention is that a common\nmoral framework is often lacking, especially in moral disagreements\nbetween one society and another, and that differences in moral\nframeworks usually cannot be explained simply by supposing that one\nsociety or the other is making factual or logical mistakes. These\nmoral disagreements are ultimately rooted in fundamentally different\nmoral orientations, and there is usually no reason to think these\ndifferences result from the fact that, in relevant respects, one side\nis less reasonable or well-informed than the other. They are faultless\ndisagreements. This conclusion might rest on the observation that it\nis not evident that mistakes are at the root of these disagreement.\nBut it might also depend on a theory, developed to explain such\nobservations, that the frameworks are incommensurable: They do not\nhave enough in common, in terms of either shared concepts or shared\nstandards, to resolve their differences, and there is no impartial\nthird standpoint, accessible to any reasonable and well-informed\nperson, that could be invoked to resolve the conflict.\n\nVarious objectivist responses may be made to this argument. One is the\nDavidsonian approach, already considered, that precludes the\npossibility of incommensurable moral frameworks. Another response is\nthat incommensurability does not preclude the possibility of\nrationally resolving differences between moral frameworks. For\nexample, Alasdair MacIntyre (1988: ch. 18 and 1994) has argued that,\nin some circumstances, it is possible to realize, through an exercise\nin imagination, that a conflicting and incommensurable moral tradition\nis rationally superior to one\u2019s own tradition. However, the most\ncommon objectivist response is to claim that some specific moral\nframework is rationally superior to all others. For example, it might\nbe argued, following Kant, that pure practical reason implies a\nfundamental moral principle such as the Categorical Imperative (see\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy),\n or it might be claimed, following Aristotle, that human nature is\nsuch that virtues such as courage, temperance, and justice are\nnecessary for any plausible conception of a good life (see the\nsections on\n the human good and the function argument\n in the entry on Aristotle\u2019s ethics, and the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n If such an argument were sound, it might provide a compelling\nresponse to the relativist contention that conflicts between moral\nframeworks cannot be rationally resolved.\n\nProponents of MMR are unimpressed by these responses. They\nmay say that the Davidsonian account cannot assure sufficient common\nground to resolve conflicts between moral frameworks (or to ensure\nthat there is really only one framework), and that MacIntyre\u2019s\napproach is likely to work at best only in some cases. And they\nusually consider debates about the Kantian and Aristotelian arguments\nto be as difficult to resolve rationally as the conflicts between\nmoral frameworks the relativists originally invoked. They may add that\nthe fact that moral objectivists disagree among themselves about which\nobjectivist theory is correct is further indication of the difficulty\nof resolving fundamental moral conflicts.\n\nA rather different objectivist challenge is that the position of the\nproponent of MMR is inconsistent. The relativist argument is\nthat we should reject moral objectivism because there is little\nprospect of rationally resolving fundamental moral disagreements.\nHowever, it may be pointed out, the relativist should acknowledge that\nthere is no more prospect of rationally resolving disagreements about\nMMR. By parity of reasoning, he or she should grant that\nthere is no objective truth concerning MMR.\n\nTo this familiar kind of objection, there are two equally familiar\nresponses. One is to concede the objection and maintain that\nMMR is true and justified in some metaethical frameworks, but\nnot others: It is not an objective truth that any reasonable and\nwell-informed person has reason to accept. This may seem to concede a\ngreat deal, but for someone who is a relativist through and through,\nor at least is a relativist about metaethical claims, this would be\nthe only option. The other response is to contest the claim that there\nis parity of reasoning in the two cases. This would require showing\nthat the dispute about the irresolvability of moral disagreements (a\nmetaethical debate) can be rationally resolved in a way that\nfundamental moral disagreements (substantive normative debates)\nthemselves cannot. For example, the metaethical debate might be\nrationally resolved in favor of the relativist, while the substantive\nnormative debates cannot be resolved.\n6. Metaethical Moral Relativism\n\nEven if it were established that there are deep and widespread moral\ndisagreements that cannot be rationally resolved, and that these\ndisagreements are more significant than whatever agreements there may\nbe, it would not immediately follow that MMR is correct.\nOther nonobjectivist conclusions might be drawn. In particular,\nopponents of objectivism might argue for moral skepticism, that we\ncannot know moral truths, or for a view that moral judgments lack\ntruth-value (understood to imply a rejection of relative truth-value).\nHence, proponents of MMR face two very different groups of\ncritics: assorted kinds of moral objectivists and various sorts of\nmoral nonobjectivists. The defender of MMR needs to establish\nthat MMR is superior to all these positions, and this would\nrequire a comparative assessment of their respective advantages and\ndisadvantages. It is beyond the scope of this article to consider the\nalternative positions (see the entries on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism,\n moral anti-realism,\n moral epistemology,\n moral realism, and\n moral skepticism).\n What can be considered are the challenges the proponent of\nMMR faces and what may be said in response to them. Some\ncritics of MMR have raised questions about the coherence of\nthe position (for example, Boghossian 2011 and 2017).\n\nFor example, it might be thought that MMR, with respect to\ntruth-value, would have the result that a moral judgment such as\n\u201csuicide is morally right\u201d (S) could be both true and\nfalse\u2014true when valid for one group and false when invalid for\nanother. But this appears to be an untenable position: most people\nwould grant that nothing can be both true and false. Of course, some\npersons could be justified in affirming S and other persons justified\nin denying it, since the two groups could have different evidence. But\nit is another matter to say S is both true and false.\n\nA standard relativist response is to say that moral truth is relative\nin some sense. On this view, S is not true or false\nabsolutely speaking, but it may be true-relative-to-X and\nfalse-relative-to-Y (where X and Y refer to\nthe moral codes of different societies). This means that suicide is\nright for persons in a society governed by X, but it is not\nright for persons in a society governed by Y; and, the\nrelativist may contend, there is no inconsistency in this conjunction\nproperly understood.\n\nIt might be objected that the notion of relative truth fails to\ncapture the sense in which \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019\nare normative terms about what ought to be as opposed to what is the\ncase. The statement \u201csuicide is morally right\u201d is\nnormative in this sense, but the statement \u201csuicide is morally\nright for persons in a society governed by moral code X\u201d is not\nnormative, but descriptive: it tells us what persons who accept moral\ncode X think, and as such it is something everyone could agree with,\nirrespective of their own moral code, if in fact this is what moral\ncode X says. In response, it might be said that there are expressions\nof relativist moral statements that are normative. For instance,\n\u201csuicide is morally right for us,\u201d spoken by and to\nmembers of the group referred to by \u2018us\u2019, is not merely a\ndescription of what they believe: it tells them what they are morally\npermitted to do (in this sense, it is action-guiding).\n\nSuch relativist formulations may also give rise to a related and very\ncommon objection. Relativism often presents itself as an\ninterpretation of moral disagreements: It is said to be the best\nexplanation of rationally irresolvable or faultless moral\ndisagreements. However, once moral truth is regarded as relative, the\ndisagreements seem to disappear. For example, someone accepting\nX who affirms S is saying suicide is right for\npersons accepting X, while someone accepting Y who\ndenies S is saying suicide is not right for persons accepting\nY. It might well be that they are both correct and hence that\nthey are not disagreeing with one another (rather as two people in\ndifferent places might both be correct when one says the sun is\nshining and the other says it is not, or as two people in different\ncountries may both be correct when one says something is illegal and\nthe other says it is not). The relativist explanation dissolves the\ndisagreement. But, then, why did it appear as a disagreement in the\nfirst place? An objectivist might say this is because people thinking\nthis assume that moral truth is absolute rather than relative. If this\nwere correct, the relativist could not maintain that MMR\ncaptures what people already believe. The contention would have to be\nthat they should believe it, and the argument for relativism would\nhave to be formulated in those terms. For example, the relativist\nmight contend that MMR is the most plausible position to\nadopt insofar as moral judgments often give practically conflicting\ndirectives and neither judgment can be shown to be rationally superior\nto the other.\n\nAnother common objection, though probably more so outside philosophy\nthan within it, is that MMR cannot account for the fact that\nsome practices such as the holocaust in Germany or slavery in the\nUnited States are obviously objectively wrong. This point is usually\nexpressed in a tone of outrage, often with the suggestion that\nrelativists pose a threat to civilized society (or something of this\nsort). Proponents of MMR might respond that this simply begs\nthe question, and in one sense they are right. However, this objection\nmight reflect a more sophisticated epistemology, for example, that we\nhave more reason to accept these objectivist intuitions than we have\nto accept any argument put forward in favor of MMR. This\nwould bring us back to the arguments of the last section. Another\nrelativist response would be to say that the practices in question,\nthough widely accepted, were wrong according to the fundamental\nstandards of the societies (for example, there were arguments against\nslavery presented in the United States prior to the Civil War). This\nwould not show that the practices are objectively wrong, but it might\nmitigate the force of the critique. However, though this response may\nbe plausible in some cases, it is not obvious that it always would be\nconvincing.\n\nThis last response brings out the fact that a proponent of\nMMR needs a clear specification of that to which truth is\nrelative. For example, if S is true-relative-to the moral\ncode of a society, does this mean it is true-relative-to what people\nin the society think the moral code says or to what the fundamental\nstandards of the moral code actually imply? These might not be the\nsame. It is often supposed that truths can be undiscovered or that\npeople can make mistakes about them. As just noted, a moral relativist\ncould make sense of this by supposing that it is the fundamental\nstandards of a moral code that are authoritative for people in a\nsociety that accepts that code. Hence, what is morally\ntrue-relative-to the moral code of a society is whatever the\nfundamental standards of the code would actually warrant. By this\ncriterion, there could be moral truths that are unknown to people in\nthe society that accepts the code, or these people could be mistaken\nin thinking something is a moral truth.\n\nA similar point arises from the fact that it is sometimes thought to\nbe an advantage of MMR that it maintains a substantial notion\nof intersubjective truth or justification: It avoids the defects of\nmoral objectivism, on the one hand, and of moral skepticism and\ntheories that disregard moral truth-value altogether, on the other\nhand, because it maintains that moral judgments do not have truth in\nan absolute sense, but they do have truth relative to the moral code\nof a society (and similarly for justification). This is thought to be\nan advantage because, notwithstanding the supposed difficulties with\nmoral objectivism, morality is widely regarded as \u201cnot merely\nsubjective,\u201d and MMR can capture this. However, this\npurported advantage raises an important question for relativism: Why\nsuppose moral judgments have truth-value relative to a society as\nopposed to no truth-value at all? If the relativist claims that a set\nof fundamental standards is authoritative for persons in a society, it\nmay be asked why they have this authority. This question may arise in\nquite practical ways. For example, suppose a dissident challenges some\nof the fundamental standards of his or her society. Is this person\nnecessarily wrong?\n\nVarious answers may be given to these questions. For example, it may\nbe said that the standards that are authoritative in a society are\nthose that reasonable and well-informed members of the society would\ngenerally accept. This might seem to provide a basis for normative\nauthority. However, if this approach were taken, it may be asked why\nthat authority rests only on reasonable and well-informed members of\nthe society. Why not a wider group? Why not all reasonable and\nwell-informed persons?\n\nA different response would be to say that the standards that are\nauthoritative for a society are the ones persons have agreed to follow\nas a result of some negotiation or bargaining process (as seen above,\nHarman has argued that we should understand some moral judgments in\nthese terms). Once again, this might seem to lend those standards some\nauthority. Still, it may be asked whether they really have authority\nor perhaps whether they have the right kind. For example, suppose the\nagreement had been reached in circumstances in which a few members of\nsociety held great power over the others (in the real world, the most\nlikely scenario). Those with less power might have been prudent to\nmake the agreement, but it is not obvious that such an agreement would\ncreate genuine normative authority\u2014a point the dissident\nchallenging the standards might well make. Moreover, if all moral\nvalues are understood in this way, how do we explain the authority of\nthe contention that people should follow a set of values because they\nagreed to do so? Must there be a prior agreement to do what we agree\nto do?\n\nA related objection concerns the specification of the society to which\nmoral justification or truth are said to be relative. People typically\nbelong to many different groups defined by various criteria: culture,\nreligion, political territory, ethnicity, race, gender, etc. Moreover,\nwhile it is sometimes claimed that the values of a group defined by\none of these criteria have authority for members of the group, such\nclaims are often challenged. The specification of the relevant group\nis itself a morally significant question, and there appears to be no\nobjective map of the world that displays its division into social\ngroups to which the truth or justification of moral judgments are\nrelative. A proponent of MMR needs a plausible way of\nidentifying the group of persons to which moral truth or justification\nare relative.\n\nMoreover, not only do people typically belong to more than one group,\nas defined by the aforementioned criteria, the values that are\nauthoritative in each group a person belongs to may not always be the\nsame. If I belong to a religion and a nationality, and their values\nconcerning abortion are diametrically opposed, then which value is\ncorrect for me? This raises the question whether there is a basis for\nresolving the conflict consistent with MMR (the two groups\nmight have conflicting fundamental standards) and whether in this\ncircumstance MMR would entail that there is a genuine moral\ndilemma (meaning that abortion is both right and wrong for me). This\npoint is not necessarily an objection, but a defender of MMR\nwould have to confront these issues and develop a convincing position\nconcerning them.\n\nThe fact that social groups are defined by different criteria, and\nthat persons commonly belong to more than one social group, might be\ntaken as a reason to move from relativism to a form of subjectivism.\nThat is, instead of saying that the truth or justification of moral\njudgments is relative to a group, we should say it is relative to each\nindividual (as noted above, relativism is sometimes defined to include\nboth positions). This revision might defuse the issues just discussed,\nbut it would abandon the notion of intersubjectivity with respect to\ntruth or justification\u2014what for many proponents of MMR\nis a chief advantage of the position. Moreover, a proponent of this\nsubjectivist account would need to explain in what sense, if any,\nmoral values have normative authority for a person as opposed to\nsimply being accepted. The fact that we sometimes think our moral\nvalues have been mistaken is often thought to imply that we believe\nthey have some authority that does not consist in the mere fact that\nwe accept them.\n\nAnother set of concerns arises from purported facts about similarities\namong and interactions across different societies vis-\u00e0-vis\nmorality. People in one society sometimes make moral judgments about\npeople in another society on the basis of moral standards they take to\nbe authoritative for both societies. In addition, conflicts between\nsocieties are sometimes resolved because one society changes its moral\noutlook and comes to share at least some of the moral values of the\nother society. More generally, sometimes people in one society think\nthey learn from the moral values of another society: They come to\nbelieve that the moral values of another society are better in some\nrespects than their own (previously accepted) values. The Mondrian\nimage of a world divided into distinct societies, each with it own\ndistinctive moral values, makes it difficult to account for these\nconsiderations. If this image is abandoned as unrealistic, and is\nreplaced by one that acknowledges greater moral overlap and\ninteraction among societies (recall the Pollock image), then the\nproponent of MMR needs to give a plausible account of these\ndynamics. This is related to the problem of authority raised earlier:\nThese considerations suggest that people sometimes acknowledge moral\nauthority that extends beyond their own society, and a relativist\nneeds to show why this makes sense or why people are mistaken in this\nacknowledgement.\n7. Mixed Positions: A Rapprochement between Relativists and Objectivists?\n\nDiscussions of moral relativism often assume (as mostly has been\nassumed here so far) that moral relativism is the correct account of\nall moral judgments or of none. But perhaps it is the correct account\nof some moral judgments but not others or, more vaguely, the best\naccount of morality vis-\u00e0-vis these issues would acknowledge\nboth relativist and objectivist elements. Such a mixed position might\nbe motivated by some of the philosophical questions already raised\n(recall also the suggestion in the section on\n experimental philosophy\n that some people may be \u201cmeta-ethical pluralists\u201d). On\nthe empirical level, it might be thought that there are many\nsubstantial moral disagreements but also some striking moral\nagreements across different societies. On the metaethical plane, it\nmight be supposed that, though many disagreements are not likely to be\nrationally resolved, other disagreements may be (and perhaps that the\ncross-cultural agreements we find have a rational basis). The first\npoint would lead to a weaker form of DMR The second point,\nthe more important one, would imply a modified form of MMR\n(see the suggestions in the last paragraph of\n section 4).\n This approach has attracted some support, interestingly, from both\nsides of the debate: relativists who have embraced an objective\nconstraint, and (more commonly) objectivists who have allowed some\nrelativist dimensions. Here are some prominent examples of these mixed\nmetaethical outlooks.\n\nDavid Copp (1995) maintains that it is true that something is morally\nwrong only if it is wrong in relation to the justified moral code of\nsome society, and a code is justified in a society only if the society\nwould be rationally required to select it. Since which code it would\nbe rationally required to select depends in part on the non-moral\nvalues of the society, and since these values differ from one society\nto another, something may be morally wrong for one society but not for\nanother. Copp calls this position a form of moral relativism. However,\nhe believes this relativism is significantly mitigated by the fact\nthat which code a society is rationally required to select also\ndepends on the basic needs of the society. Copp thinks all societies\nhave the same basic needs. For example, every society has a need to\nmaintain its population and system of cooperation from one generation\nto the next. Moreover, since meeting these basic needs is the most\nfundamental factor in determining the rationality of selecting a code,\nCopp thinks the content of all justified moral codes will tend to be\nquite similar. For instance, any such code will require that\npersons\u2019s basic needs for such things as physical survival,\nself-respect and friendship be promoted (these are said to be\nnecessary for minimal rational agency). The theory is mixed insofar as\nthe rationality of selecting a code depends partly on common features\nof human nature (basic needs) and partly on diverse features of\ndifferent societies (values). Whether or not justified moral codes\n(and hence moral truths) would tend to be substantially similar,\ndespite differences, as Copp argues, would depend on both the claim\nthat all societies have the same basic needs and the claim that these\nneeds are much more important than other values in determining which\nmoral code it is rational for a society to select.\n\nWong (1996) defended a partly similar position, though one intended to\nallow for greater diversity in correct moral codes. He argued that\nmore than one morality may be true, but there are limits on which\nmoralities are true. The first point is a form of metaethical\nrelativism: It says one morality may be true for one society and a\nconflicting morality may be true for another society. Hence, there is\nno one objectively correct morality for all societies. The second\npoint, however, is a concession to moral objectivism. It acknowledges\nthat objective factors concerning human nature and the human situation\nshould determine whether or not, or to what extent, a given morality\ncould be one of the true ones. The mere fact that a morality is\naccepted by a society does not guarantee that it has normative\nauthority in that society. For example, given our biological and\npsychological make-up, not just anything could count as a good way of\nlife. Again, given that most persons are somewhat self-interested and\nthat society requires some measure of cooperation, any plausible\nmorality will include a value of reciprocity (good in return for good\non some proportional basis). Since these objective limitations are\nquite broad, they are insufficient in themselves to establish a\nspecific and detailed morality: Many particular moralities are\nconsistent with them, and the choice among these moralities must be\ndetermined by the cultures of different societies.\n\nWong has developed this approach at length in more recent work (2006).\nHis \u201cpluralistic relativism\u201d continues to emphasize that\nthere are universal constraints on what could be a true morality. The\nconstraints are based on a naturalistic understanding of human nature\nand the circumstances of human life. For Wong, given a variety of\nhuman needs and the depth of self-interest, morality\u2019s function\nis to promote both social co-operation and individual flourishing. In\naddition, morality requires that persons have both effective agency\nand effective identity, and these can only be fostered in personal\ncontexts such as the family. Hence, the impersonal perspective must be\nlimited by the personal perspective. Any true morality would have to\nrespect requirements such as these.\n\nNonetheless, according to Wong, the universal constraints are\nsufficiently open-ended that there is more than one way to respect\nthem. Hence, there can be more than one true morality. This is\npluralistic relativism. For Wong, the different true moralities need\nnot be, and typically are not, completely different from one another.\nIn fact, they often share some values (such as individual rights and\nsocial utility), but assign them different priorities.\n\nWong presents pluralistic relativism as the best explanation of what\nhe calls \u201cmoral ambivalence,\u201d the phenomenon of morally\ndisagreeing with someone while recognizing that the person is still\nreasonable in making the conflicting judgment\u2014to the point that\none\u2019s confidence in being uniquely right is shaken. The extent\nto which moral ambivalence is widespread is an empirical question\n (see section 3).\n In any case, Wong presents a sustained and detailed argument\nthat an empirically-based understanding of the nature and conditions\nof human life both limits and underdetermines what a true morality\ncould be. In many respects, his position is the most sophisticated\nform of relativism developed to date, and it has the resources to\nconfront a number of the issues raised in the last section (for some\ncritical responses to Wong and his replies, see Xiao and Huang 2014;\nfor more recent discussion, see Li 2019, Vicente and Arrieta\n2016, and Wong 2020).\n\nA somewhat similar mixed position has been advanced, though more\ntentatively, by Foot (2002a and 2002b; see also Scanlon 1995 and 1998:\nch. 8). She argued that there are conceptual limitations on what could\ncount as a moral code (as seen in\n section 4),\n and that there are common features of human nature that set limits on\nwhat a good life could be. For these reasons, there are some objective\nmoral truths\u2014for example, that the Nazi attempt to exterminate\nthe Jews was morally wrong. However, Foot maintained, these\nconsiderations do not ensure that all moral disagreements can be\nrationally resolved. Hence, in some cases, a moral judgment may be\ntrue by reference to the standards of one society and false by\nreference to the standards of another society\u2014but neither true\nnor false in any absolute sense (just as we might say with respect to\nstandards of beauty).\n\nFoot came to this mixed view from the direction of objectivism (in the\nform of a virtue theory), and it might be contended by some\nobjectivists that she has conceded too much. Since there are objective\ncriteria, what appear as rationally irresolvable disagreements might\nbe resolvable through greater understanding of human nature. Or the\nobjective criteria might establish that in some limited cases it is an\nobjective moral truth that conflicting moral practices are both\nmorally permissible. In view of such considerations, objectivists\nmight argue, it is not necessary to have recourse to the otherwise\nproblematic notion of relative moral truth.\n\nA position related to Foot\u2019s has been advanced by Martha\nNussbaum (1993). With explicit reference to Aristotle, she argued that\nthere is one objectively correct understanding of the human good, and\nthat this understanding provides a basis for criticizing the moral\ntraditions of different societies. The specifics of this account are\nexplained by a set of experiences or concerns, said to be common to\nall human beings and societies, such as fear, bodily appetite,\ndistribution of resources, management of personal property, etc.\nCorresponding to each of these is a conception of living well, a\nvirtue, namely the familiar Aristotelian virtues such as courage,\nmoderation, justice, and generosity. Nussbaum acknowledged that there\nare disagreements about these virtues, and she raised an obvious\nrelativist objection herself: Even if the experiences are universal,\ndoes human nature establish that there is one objectively correct way\nof living well with respect to each of these areas? In response,\nNussbaum conceded that sometimes there may be more than one\nobjectively correct conception of these virtues and that the\nspecification of the conception may depend on the practices of a\nparticular community.\n\nAs with Foot, Nussbaum came to this mixed position from the\nobjectivist side of the debate. Some moral objectivists may think she\nhas given up too much, and for a related reason many moral relativists\nmay believe she has established rather little. For example, bodily\nappetites are indeed universal experiences, but there has been a wide\nrange of responses to these\u2014for example, across a spectrum from\nasceticism to hedonism. This appears to be one of the central areas of\nmoral disagreement. In order to maintain her objectivist credentials,\nNussbaum needs to show that human nature substantially constrains\nwhich of these responses could be morally appropriate. Some\nobjectivists may say she has not shown this, but could, while\nrelativists may doubt she could show it.\n\nMixed positions along the lines of those just discussed suppose that\nmorality is objective in some respects, on account of some features of\nhuman nature, and relative in other respects. For the respects in\nwhich morality is relative, it is up to particular societies or\nindividuals to determine which moral values to embrace. Hence, the\nauthority of morality depends partly on objective factors and partly\non the decisions of groups or individuals. Insofar as this is true,\nsuch mixed positions need to say something about the basis for these\ndecisions and how conflicts are to be resolved (for example, when\nindividuals dissent from groups or when people belong to different\ngroups with conflicting values). The objective features of mixed\npositions may help resolve these issues, or may limit their import,\nbut at the point where these features give out there remain some of\nthe standard concerns about relativism (such as those raised in the\nlast section).\n\nAnother approach might be construed as a mixed position, though it was\nnot put forward in these terms. Isaiah Berlin (1998) argued that,\nthough some moral values are universal, there are also many objective\nvalues that conflict and are not commensurable with one another. He\ncalled his position pluralism and rejected the label\n\u2018relativism\u2019 (see the entry on\n Isaiah Berlin).\n But if incommensurability implies that these conflicts cannot be\nrationally resolved, then it might suggest a concession to\nrelativism.\n\nAgainst such a position, an objectivist may ask why we should think\nobjective goods are incommensurable: If X and Y are\nboth objectively good, then why not say that the statement\n\u2018X is better than Y\u2019 (or a more\nrestrictive comparative statement specifying respects or\ncircumstances) is objectively true or false, even if this is difficult\nto know? Berlin\u2019s view was that there are many examples of\nconflicting goods\u2014for example, justice and mercy, or liberty and\nequality\u2014where it is implausible to suppose they are\ncommensurable.\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that a rather different kind of mixed\nposition was proposed by Bernard Williams (1981 and 1985: ch. 9). He\nrejected what he called \u201cstrict relational relativism,\u201d\nthat ethical conceptions have validity only relative to a society. But\nhe endorsed another form of relativism. This was explained by\nreference to a distinction between a \u201cnotional\nconfrontation,\u201d where a divergent outlook is known but not a\nreal option for us, and a \u201creal confrontation,\u201d where a\ndivergent outlook is a real option for us\u2014something we might\nembrace without losing our grip on reality. Williams\u2019s\n\u201crelativism of distance\u201d says ethical appraisals are\nappropriate in real confrontations, but not in notional ones. For\nexample, we could never embrace the outlook of a medieval samurai:\nSince this is a notional confrontation, it would be inappropriate to\ndescribe this outlook as just or unjust. This is the sense in which\nrelativism is correct. But in real confrontations, relativism\nunhelpfully discourages the evaluation of another outlook that is a\ngenuine option for us (for a development of Williams\u2019s position\nby reference to the recent experimental literature, see Gait\u00e1n\nand Viciana 2018).\n\nWilliams was a strong critic of most forms of moral objectivism, yet\nhe also criticized many of the nonobjectivist alternatives to\nobjectivism. His outlook is not easily classified in terms of standard\nmetaethical positions. With respect to his relativism of distance, it\nmay be wondered why appraisals are inappropriate in notional\nconfrontations: Why should the fact that an outlook is not a real\noption preclude us from thinking it is just or unjust? On the other\nhand, in real confrontations Williams thought the language of\nappraisal was appropriate, but he also thought these confrontations\ncould involve rationally irresolvable disagreements. Though Williams\nrejects strict relational relativism, objectivists may argue that his\nposition suffers from defects as serious as those that attend\nMMR. If the confrontations are real because the two outlooks\nhave something in common, objectivists might ask, could this not\nprovide a basis for resolving these disagreements?\n\nThe central theme in mixed positions is that neither relativism nor\nobjectivism is wholly correct: At least in the terms in which they are\noften expressed, these alternatives are subject to serious objections,\nand yet they are motivated by genuine concerns. It might seem that a\nmixed position could be developed that would give us the best of both\nworlds (there are a number of other proposals along these lines; for\nexample see Hampshire 1983 and 1989). However, an implication of most\nmixed positions (this does not apply to Williams) seems to be that, in\nsome respect, some moral judgments are objectively true (or\njustified), while others have only relative truth (or justification).\nThis should not be confused with the claim that an action may be right\nin some circumstances but not others. For example, a consequentialist\nview that polygamy is right in one society and wrong in another\nbecause it has good consequences in the first society and bad\nconsequences in the second would not be a mixed position because the\njudgments \u201cPolygamy is right in circumstances A\u201d\nand \u201cPolygamy is wrong in circumstances B\u201d could\nboth be true in an absolute sense. By contrast, a mixed position might\nsay that \u201cPolygamy is right\u201d is true relative to one\nsociety and false relative to another (where the two societies differ,\nnot necessarily in circumstances, but in fundamental values), while\nother moral judgments have absolute truth-value. This is a rather\ndisunified conception of morality, and it invites many questions. A\nproponent of a mixed view would have to show that it is an accurate\nportrayal of our moral practices, or that it is a plausible proposal\nfor reforming them.\n8. Relativism and Tolerance\n\nRelativism is sometimes associated with a normative position, usually\npertaining to how people ought to regard or behave towards those with\nwhom they morally disagree. The most prominent normative position in\nthis connection concerns tolerance. In recent years, the idea that we\nshould be tolerant has been increasingly accepted in some circles. At\nthe same time, others have challenged this idea, and the philosophical\nunderstanding and justification of tolerance has become less obvious\n(see Heyd 1996 and the entry on\n toleration).\n The question here is whether moral relativism has something to\ncontribute to these discussions, in particular, whether DMR\nor MMR provide support for tolerance (for discussion, see\nGraham 1996, Harrison 1976, Ivanhoe 2009, Kim and Wreen 2003, Prinz\n2007: pp. 207\u201313 and Wong 1984: ch. 12). In this context,\ntolerance does not ordinarily mean indifference or absence of\ndisapproval: It means having a policy of not interfering with the\nactions of persons that are based on moral judgments we reject, when\nthe disagreement is not or cannot be rationally resolved. The context\nof discussion is often, but not always, moral disagreements between\ntwo societies. Does moral relativism provide support for tolerance in\nthis sense?\n\nThough many people seem to think it does, philosophers often resist\nsupposing that there is a philosophical connection between accepting a\nmetaethical position and reaching a practical conclusion (however, see\nGillespie 2016). Hence, it is often thought that,\nthough DMR may provide the occasion for tolerance, but\nit could not imply that tolerance is morally obligatory or even\npermissible. DMR simply tells us there are moral\ndisagreements. Recognition of this fact, by itself, entails nothing\nabout how we should act towards those with whom we disagree.\nMMR fares no better. For one thing, MMR cannot very\nwell imply that it is an objective moral truth that we should be\ntolerant: MMR denies that there are such truths. (A mixed\nposition could contend that tolerance is the only objective moral\ntruth, all others being relative; but it would have to be shown that\nthis is more than an ad hoc maneuver.) It might be said that\nMMR implies that tolerance is a relative truth. However, even\nthis is problematic. According to MMR, understood to concern\ntruth, the truth-value of statements may vary from society to society.\nHence, the statement, \u201cpeople ought to be tolerant\u201d\n(T), may be true in some societies and false in others.\nMMR by itself does not entail that T is true in any\nsociety, and may in fact have the result that T is false in some\nsocieties (a similar point may be made with respect to\njustification).\n\nSome objectivists may add that in some cases we should be tolerant of\nthose with whom we morally disagree, but that only objectivists can\nestablish this as an objective moral truth (for example, by drawing on\narguments in the liberal tradition from Locke or Mill). To the\nobjection that moral objectivism implies intolerance (or imperialism),\nobjectivists typically contend that the fact that we regard a society\nas morally wrong in some respect does not entail that we should\ninterfere with it.\n\nNonetheless, the thought persists among some relativists that there is\na philosophically significant connection between relativism and\ntolerance. Perhaps the conjunction of MMR and an ethical\nprinciple could give us a reason for tolerance we would not have on\nthe basis of the ethical principle alone. Such an approach has been\nproposed by Wong (1984: ch. 12). The principle is, roughly speaking,\nthat we should not interfere with people unless we could justify this\ninterference to them (if they were rational and well-informed in\nrelevant respects). Wong called this \u201cthe justification\nprinciple.\u201d Of course, it is already a tolerance principle of\nsorts. The idea is that it gains broader scope if MMR is\ncorrect. Let us suppose the statement that there is an individual\nright to freedom of speech is true and justified for our society, but\nis false and unjustified in another society in which the press is\nrestricted for the good of the community. In this case, given\nMMR, our society might not be able to justify interference to\nthe restrictive society concerning freedom of the press. Any\njustification we could give would appeal to values that are\nauthoritative for us, not them, and no appeal to logic or facts alone\nwould give them a reason to accept our justification.\n\nIf the justification principle were widely accepted, this argument\nmight explain why some people have had good reason to think there is a\nconnection between relativism and tolerance. But there is a question\nabout whether the position is stable. Wong derived the justification\nprinciple from Kant, and Kant rejected MMR. If we were to\naccept MMR, would we still have reason to accept the\njustification principle? Wong thought we might, perhaps on the basis\nof considerations quite independent of Kant. In any case, this\nargument would only show that MMR plays a role in an argument\nfor tolerance that is relevant to people in a society that accepted\nthe justification principle. The argument does not establish that\nthere is a general connection between relativism and tolerance. Nor\ndoes it undermine the contention that MMR may have the result\nthat T is true in some societies and false in others.\n\nIn his more recent defense of pluralistic relativism (2006), Wong has\nargued that, since some serious moral disagreements are inevitable,\nany adequate morality will include the value of what he calls\naccommodation. This involves a commitment to peaceful and non-coercive\nrelationships with persons with whom we disagree. Accommodation\nappears to be related to tolerance, but Wong argues for more than\nthis: we should also try to learn from others, compromise with them,\npreserve relationships with them, etc. Wong\u2019s defense of\naccommodation is immune to the objection that relativism cannot be a\nbasis for such a universal value because his defense purports to be\nbased on considerations that any adequate morality should recognize.\nHowever, for this reason, though it presupposes the considerations\nsupporting the relativist dimension of his position (there is no\nsingle true morality), it argues from the non-relativist dimension\n(there are universal constraints any morality should accept, in\nparticular, that one function of morality is to promote social\nco-operation). Hence, it is not strictly speaking an argument from\nrelativism to accommodation.\n\nAs was noted in\n section 3,\n aside from the philosophical question whether or not some form of\nmoral relativism provides a reason for attitudes such as tolerance,\nthere is the psychological question whether or not people who accept\nrelativism are more likely to be tolerant. As was seen, there is some\nevidence that relativists are more tolerant than objectivists, and it\nhas been claimed that, even if relativism does not justify tolerance,\nit would be a positive feature of relativism that acceptance of it\nmakes people more tolerant (see Prinz 2007: 208). Of course, this\njudgment presupposes that, in some sense, it is good to be\ntolerant.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Accetti, C., 2015, <em>Relativism and Religion: Why Democratic\nSocieties Do Not Need Moral Absolutes</em>, New York: Columbia\nUniversity Press.", "American Anthropological Association Executive Board, 1947,\n\u201cStatement on Human Rights,\u201d <em>American\nAnthropologist</em>, 49: 539\u201343.", "Appiah, K.
