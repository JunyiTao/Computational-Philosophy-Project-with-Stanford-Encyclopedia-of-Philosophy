    "main_text": "Physics\n8. Physics\n\nWhile the receptacle has an obvious metaphysical role in the\nTimaeus, its primary role after its introduction is in the\nphysical theory of the dialogue. The argument from 47e3 to 52d4\nprepares the ground for both the spatial matrix in which to situate,\nand the material substratum from which to constitute, the universe\nthat he will fashion after its eternal model. The fashioning, however,\nis the process of bringing order to what was, prior to and apart from\nthe Craftsman\u2019s intervention, a thoroughly disorderly state of\naffairs, and so the physical account begins with a description of that\ndisorderly, \u201cgod-forsaken\u201d (53b3\u20134) initial\nstate.\n\nIn that state, dramatically described at 52d4\u201353c3, the filled\nspace that is the receptacle undergoes constant, erratic motion: it is\nsubject to forces (dunameis, 52e2) that are dissimilar to and\nout of balance with each other, and thus, as each spastic movement\nproduces its chain of spastic reactions, it is perpetually unstable\n(52e1\u20135). These motions may accidentally produce manifestations\nthat to a would-be observer look like fire or any of the so-called\nfour elements, or \u201ckinds\u201d (gen\u00ea). Timaeus\ncalls these manifestations \u201ctraces\u201d (53b2) of the four\nkinds, and states that even as inarticulate traces, they tended to\nbehave in the ways in which the subsequently articulated kinds would\ncome to behave by necessity: each trace type would gather to its own\nregion, with the heavier to one region and the lighter to another.\nThese migrations are the effect of the ceaseless agitation of the\nreceptacle, which acts like a \u201cwinnowing sieve\u201d (52e6),\nseparating the heavy from the light. The result is a pre-cosmic\ninchoate stratification of these traces, which anticipates the\n(perpetually incomplete, 58a2\u2013c4) stratification of the finished\nuniverse.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements for the construction of the body\nof the universe previously set out at 31b4\u201332c4, the Craftsman\nbegins by fashioning each of the four kinds \u201cto be as perfect\nand excellent as possible\u2026\u201d (53b5\u20136). He selects as\nthe basic corpuscles (s\u00f4mata, \u201cbodies\u201d)\nfour of the five regular solids: the tetrahedron for fire, the\noctahedron for air, the icosahedron for water, and the cube for earth.\n(The remaining regular solid, the dodecahedron, is \u201cused for the\nuniverse as a whole,\u201d [55c4\u20136], since it approaches most\nnearly the shape of a sphere.) The faces of the first three of these\nare composed of equilateral triangles, and each face is itself\ncomposed of six elemental (scalene) half equilateral right-angled\ntriangles, whose sides are in a proportion of 1:\u221a3:2. Timaeus\ndoes not say why each face is composed of six such triangles, when in\nfact two, joined at the longer of the two sides that contain the right\nangle, will more simply constitute an equilateral triangle. The faces\nof the cube are squares composed of four elemental isosceles\nright-angled triangles and again, it is not clear why four should be\npreferred to two. Given that every right-angled triangle is infinitely\ndivisible into two triangles of it own type (by dropping a\nperpendicular from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse, the\nresulting two smaller right triangles are both similar to the original\ntriangle) the equilateral or square faces of the solids and thus the\nstereometric solids themselves have no minimal size. Possibly, then,\nthe choice of six component triangles for the equilateral and four for\nthe square is intended to prevent the solid particles from becoming\nvanishingly\n small.[29]\n\nSince each of the first three of the regular solids has equilateral\nfaces, it is possible for any fire, air or water corpuscles to come\napart in their interactions\u2014they cut or crush each\nother\u2014and their faces be reconstituted into corpuscles of one of\nthe two other sorts, depending on the numbers of faces of the basic\ncorpuscles involved. For example, two fire corpuscles could be\ntransformed into a single air corpuscle, or one air corpuscle into two\nfire corpuscles, given that the tetrahedron has four faces and the\noctahedron eight (other examples are given at 56d6\u2013e7). In this\nway Timaeus explains the intertransformation that can occur among\nfire, air and water. On the other hand, while the faces of the cube\nparticles may also come apart, they can only be reconstituted as cubes\nsince they are based on isosceles right-angled triangles; and so earth\nundergoes no intertransformation with the other\n three.[30]\n Having established the construction and interaction of the basic\nparticles, Timaeus continues the physical account of the discourse\nwith a series of applications: differences among varieties of each of\nthe primary bodies are explained by differences in the sizes of the\nconstituent particles (some varieties consisting of particles of\ndifferent sizes), and compounds are distinguished by their\ncombinations of both different sorts and different sizes of particles.\nThese various arrangements explain the perceptible properties\npossessed by the varieties of primary bodies and their compounds. An\nobject\u2019s particular arrangement of triangles produces a\nparticular kind of \u201cdisturbance\u201d or\n\u201cexperience\u201d (pathos) in the perceiving subject,\nso that the object is perceived as having this or that perceptible\nproperty.\n\nIt is a fair question to ask how the physics of the discourse relates\nto its metaphysics\u2014for example, how the perceptible properties\nof observable instances of fire (its brightness, lightness and heat,\nlet us say) relate to the form of Fire, an intelligible reality that\nhas no perceptible properties at all. The form of Fire is the\nnon-spatial, non-material, non-perceptible intelligible, eternal and\nunchanging nature of fire that the Craftsman \u201cimitates,\u201d\nand in so doing produces spatially extended, material, perceptible,\ntransient and variable instances of fire. Although we are not told\nwhat it is about the nature of fire that requires observable instances\nof it to have just these properties, it is presumably that knowledge\nthat guides the Craftsman to select and assign the four regular solids\nas he does. Given that the nature of fire is such that any\n\u201cimitations\u201d of it that appear in the Receptacle must be\nperceptible as bright, light and hot, the type of solid body that best\nsupports these properties\u2014the tetrahedron, it turns\nout\u2014should be assigned to fire. And so with the other three\nkinds (see 55d7\u201356c7).\n",
