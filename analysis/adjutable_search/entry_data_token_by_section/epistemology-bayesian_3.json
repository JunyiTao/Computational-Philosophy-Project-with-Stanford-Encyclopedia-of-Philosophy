    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || Applications\n1.3 Applications\n\nBayesian epistemology features an ambition: to develop a simple\nnormative framework that consists of little or nothing more than the\ntwo core Bayesian norms, with the goal of explaining or justifying a\nwide range of intuitively good epistemic practices and perhaps also of\nguiding our inquiries, all done with a focus on credence change. That\nsounds quite ambitious, given the narrow focus on credence change. But\nmany Bayesians maintain that credence change is a unifying theme that\nunderlies many different aspects of our epistemic endeavors. Let me\nmention some examples below.\n\nFirst of all, it seems that a hypothesis H is\nconfirmed by new evidence E exactly when one\u2019s\ncredence in H ought to increase in response to the acquisition\nof E. Extending that idea, it also seems that how much\nH is confirmed correlates with how much its credence ought to\nbe raised. With those ideas in mind, Bayesians have developed several\naccounts of confirmation; see\n section 3 of the entry on confirmation.\n Through the concept of confirmation, some Bayesians have also\ndeveloped accounts of closely related concepts. For example, being\nsupported by evidence seems to be the same as or similar to\nbeing confirmed by evidence, which is ultimately explained by\nBayesians in terms of credence change. So there are some Bayesian\naccounts of evidential support; see\n section 3 of the entry on Bayes\u2019 theorem\n and\n sections 2.3\u20132.5 of the entry on imprecise probabilities.\n Here is another example: how well a theory explains\na body of evidence seems to be closely related to how well the theory\nis confirmed by the evidence, which is ultimately explained by\nBayesians in terms of credence change. So there are some Bayesian\naccounts of explanatory power; see\n section 2 of the entry on abduction.\n\nThe focus on credence change also sheds light on another aspect of our\nepistemic practices: inductive inference. An inductive inference is\noften understood as a process that results in the formation of an\nall-or-nothing attitude: believing or accepting the truth of a\nhypothesis H on the basis of one\u2019s evidence E.\nThat does not appear to fit the Bayesian picture well. But to\nBayesians, what really matters is how new evidence E ought to\nchange one\u2019s credence in H\u2014whether one\u2019s\ncredence ought to be raised or lowered, and by\nhow much. To be sure, there is the issue of whether the\nresulting credence would be high enough to warrant the formation of\nthe attitude of believing or accepting. But to many Bayesians, that\nissue seems only secondary, or better forgone as argued by Jeffrey\n(1970). If so, the fundamental issue about inductive inference is\nultimately how credences ought to change in light of new evidence. So\nBayesians have had much to say about various kinds of inductive\ninferences and related classic problems in philosophy of science. See\nthe following footnote for a long list of relevant survey articles (or\nresearch papers, in cases where survey articles are not yet\n available).[1]\n\nFor monographs on applications in epistemology and philosophy of\nscience, see Earman (1992), Bovens & Hartmann (2004), Howson &\nUrbach (2006), and Sprenger & Hartmann (2019). In fact, there are\nalso applications to natural language semantics and pragmatics: for\nindicative conditionals, see the survey by Briggs (2019: sec. 6 and 7)\nand sections 3 and 4.2 of the entry on\n indicative conditionals;\n for epistemic modals, see Yalcin (2012).\n\nThe applications mentioned above rely on the assumption of some or\nother norms for credences. Although the correct norms are held by most\nBayesians to include at least Probabilism and the Principle of\nConditionalization, it is debated whether there are more and, if so,\nwhat they are. It is to this issue that I now turn.\n\n\n",
