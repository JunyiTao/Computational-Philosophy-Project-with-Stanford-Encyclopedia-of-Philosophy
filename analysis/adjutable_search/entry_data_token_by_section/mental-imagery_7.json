    "main_text": "Mental imagery in perception || Amodal completion\n2.1 Amodal completion\n\nAmodal completion in the visual sense modality is the representation\nof occluded parts of perceived objects. When we see a cat behind a\npicket fence, we complete those parts of the cat amodally that are\nhidden behind the planks. But amodal completion is not just a visual\nphenomenon: in the auditory sense modality, we amodally complete, for\nexample, beeped out parts of a soundtrack and in the tactile sense\nmodality, we amodally complete the entire shape of the wine glass we\nhold although we only touch it with the tip of our fingers (see also\nYoung and Nanay forthcoming on olfactory amodal completion). Amodal\ncompletion is the representation of those parts of perceived objects\nthat we get no sensory stimulation from (Michotte et al. 1964, Nanay\n2018b).\n\nAmodal completion is perceptual representation, as a vast amount of\nneuroscientific studies show that it happens very early in the sensory\ncortices, in the visual case it happens in the primary visual cortex\n(Lee and Nguyen 2001, Ban et al. 2013, Pan et al. 2012, see also\nBriscoe 2011). And it is not directly triggered by sensory input as\nthe amodally completed shape is not directly triggered by the retinal\ninput \u2013 the retinal input that would correspond to the amodally\ncompleted contour is empty \u2013 no contour on the retina there. In\nthe case of the cat behind the picket fence, the shape of the occluded\ntail is represented in the primary visual cortex, but there is no\ncorresponding shape on the retina that could have directly triggered\nthis shape representation: the only thing on the part of the retina\nthat would correspond to the shape of the tail is just the monochrome\nwhite of the picket fence. Amodal completion is, in this sense,\nperceptual representation that is not directly triggered by sensory\ninput (a view widely shared among empirical researchers, see van Lier\nand Ekroll 2020 for a summary).\n\nIs amodal completion a form of mental imagery then? Not everyone\nthinks so. One could argue that amodal completion is not a perceptual\nphenomenon at all, but rather a cognitive one: we see the unoccluded\nparts and then form beliefs about the occluded ones (see Briscoe 2011\nfor one version of this claim). There are two sorts of reasons to\nworry about this proposal. First, there are phenomenological worries:\nit just doesn\u2019t feel as if we merely had beliefs about occluded\nparts of perceived objects (see, e.g., Noe 2004). Second, there are\nempirical problems. In particular, this way of thinking about amodal\ncompletion does not (and, arguably, could not) explain why the\noccluded contours show up in early cortical regions of perceptual\nprocessing and do so very quickly after stimulus presentation (Sekuler\nand Palmer 1992, Rauschenberger and Yantis 2001).\n\nAnd amodal completion is partly constitutive of perception per se. The\nvast majority of our perceptual states involve amodal completion. Take\nthe visual sense modality: when you look around, you see objects\nfurther away from you partly occluded by objects closer to you. So\nyour perceptual system amodally completes these occluded bits of the\nobjects further away from you. But amodal completion is also involved\nin the representation of the unoccluded objects \u2013 you\ndon\u2019t get direct sensory input from the back side of these\nobjects, nonetheless you represent them perceptually \u2013 which\nmeans you amodally complete the back side of all three-dimensional\nobjects (Bakin et al. 2000, Ekroll et al. 2016). In short, amodal\ncompletion is partly constitutive of perception per se. And if amodal\ncompletion is indeed a form of mental imagery, then we have reason to\nthink that mental imagery is partly constitutive of perception, just\nas the charitable interpretation of Kant suggests.\n",
