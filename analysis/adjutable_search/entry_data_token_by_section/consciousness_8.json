    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Qualitative character\n4.2 Qualitative character\n\nQualitative character is often equated with so called\n\u201craw feels\u201d and illustrated by the redness one experiences\nwhen one looks at ripe tomatoes or the specific sweet savor one\nencounters when one tastes an equally ripe pineapple (Locke 1688). The\nrelevant sort of qualitative character is not restricted to sensory\nstates, but is typically taken to be present as an aspect of\nexperiential states in general, such as experienced thoughts or desires\n(Siewert 1998).\n\n\nThe existence of such feels may seem to some to mark the threshold\nfor states or creatures that are really conscious. If an organism\nsenses and responds in apt ways to its world but lacks such qualia,\nthen it might count as conscious at best in a loose and less than\nliteral sense. Or so at least it would seem to those who take\nqualitative consciousness in the \u201cwhat it is like\u201d sense to\nbe philosophically and scientifically central (Nagel 1974, Chalmers\n1996).\n\n\nQualia problems in many forms\u2014Can there be inverted qualia?\n(Block 1980a 1980b, Shoemaker 1981, 1982) Are qualia epiphenomenal?\n(Jackson 1982, Chalmers 1996) How could neural states give rise to\nqualia? (Levine 1983, McGinn 1991)\u2014have loomed large in the\nrecent past. But the What question raises a more basic problem of\nqualia: namely that of giving a clear and articulated description of\nour qualia space and the status of specific qualia within it.\n\n\nAbsent such a model, factual or descriptive errors are all too\nlikely. For example, claims about the unintelligibility of the link\nbetween experienced red and any possible neural substrate of such an\nexperience sometimes treat the relevant color quale as a simple and\nsui generis property (Levine 1983), but phenomenal redness in\nfact exists within a complex color space with multiple systematic\ndimensions and similarity relations (Hardin 1992). Understanding the\nspecific color quale relative to that larger relational structure not\nonly gives us a better descriptive grasp of its qualitative nature, it\nmay also provide some \u201chooks\u201d to which one might attach\nintelligible psycho-physical links.\n\n\nColor may be the exception in terms of our having a specific and\nwell developed formal understanding of the relevant qualitative space,\nbut it is not likely an exception with regard to the importance of such\nspaces to our understanding of qualitative properties in general (Clark\n1993, P.M. Churchland 1995). (See the entry on\n qualia.)\n",
