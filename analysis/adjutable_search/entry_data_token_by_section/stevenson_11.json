    "main_text": "Ethics, Language, and Methods || Persuasion and Persuasive Definitions\n4.3 Persuasion and Persuasive Definitions\n\nNot all linguistic attempts to coordinate or settle attitudes appeal\nto reasons. For example, we often merely invoke or stress the purely\nemotive element of words, or use metaphor, intonation, pleasantness of\nspeech or rhythm, and the like. These are all nonrational, but still\nlinguistic, methods of settling and coordinating attitudes that\nStevenson calls \u201cPersuasion.\u201d Consider, first, the many\nuses of thick ethical terms, such as \u2018courageous\u2019 or\n\u2018democratic\u2019. Often, we try to coordinate attitudes by\ninvoking these words more for their emotive meanings than for their\ndescriptive, especially when the descriptive meanings are taken for\ngranted. Saying that one acted in the face of fear may be\ndescriptively accurate; saying that one acted courageously, especially\nwhen all relevant parties already believe that one acted in the face\nof fear, is more likely an attempt to coordinate admiration among the\nparties. Consider also the persuasive strategy of repetition. Smith\nsays that Jones did the right thing; asked for a reason, Smith merely\nstates that Jones\u2019s act was an instance of performing his duty. Here,\nSmith provides no reason at all, but merely attempts to coordinate\npositive attitudes by relying on the repeated effect of the emotive\nforce of evaluative terms. For a different use of repetition, consider\nthe persuasiveness of Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s repetition of \u2018I\nhave a dream\u2019 and \u2018Let freedom ring\u2019 during his\n\u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, delivered during the 1963 March\non Washington. These are just a few examples of moral persuasion.\n\nPersuasive techniques, according to Stevenson, play a vital role in\nattempts to modify the standards of a society or group. At the center\nof such reform is the use of what Stevenson calls \u201cpersuasive\ndefinition,\u201d or attempts to give \u201ca new conceptual meaning\nto a familiar word without substantially changing its emotive meaning,\nand which is used with the conscious or unconscious purpose of\nchanging, by this means, the direction of people\u2019s interests\u201d\n(1938b, 32; 1944, chapter IX). Suppose Smith recognizes that Jones has\nhad little formal education and uses grammatically incorrect sentences\nand obvious literary references and, on this basis, claims that Jones\nis simply not a person of \u201cculture.\u201d Rodriguez agrees that\nJones has such qualities but claims that Jones is a person of culture\nnotwithstanding, for \u201cin the true and full sense of the term,\n\u2018culture\u2019 means imaginative sensitivity and\noriginality,\u201d and these qualities Jones has in\nabundance:\n\n\nIt will be obvious that [Rodriguez], in defining\n\u2018culture\u2019, was not simply introducing a convenient\nabbreviation, nor was he seeking to clarify \u2018the\u2019 common\nmeaning of the term. His purpose was to redirect [Smith\u2019s] attitudes,\nfeeling that [Smith] was insufficiently appreciative of their friend\u2019s\nmerits. \u2018Culture\u2019 had and would continue to have, for\npeople of their sort, a laudatory emotive meaning. The definition\nurged [Smith] to stop using the laudatory term to refer to grammatical\nniceties, literary allusions, and the rest, and to use it, instead, to\nrefer to imaginative sensitivity and originality. In this manner, it\nsought to place the former qualities in a relatively poor light, and\nthe latter in a fine one, and thus to redirect [Smith\u2019s] admiration.\nWhen people learn to call something by a name rich in emotive meaning,\nthey more readily admire it; and when they learn not to call it by\nsuch a name, they less readily admire it. The definition made use of\nthis fact. It sought to change attitudes by changing names. (1944,\n211\u2013212; see also 1938b)\n\n\nPersuasive definitions lie at the heart of much moral reform, whether\nfor good or ill (1944, 209\u2013210). \u201cThe words are\nprizes,\u201d Stevenson writes, \u201cwhich each man seeks to bestow\non the qualities of his own choice\u201d (1938b, 35).\n",
