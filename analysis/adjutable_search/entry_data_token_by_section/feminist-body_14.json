    "main_text": "A Return to Phenomenology || Throwing Like a Girl\n7.1 Throwing Like a Girl\n\nIn a series of essays written early in her career, Young, (reprinted\n2005), captured everyday experiences of women\u2019s embodiment. Such\naccounts were not simply descriptive, but were aimed, initially, to\nmake evident the way in which the social norms governing female\n\u201cbodily comportment\u201d yielded an inhibited\nintentionality, an interruption in the pre-reflexive engagement\nwith our environment to which Merleau-Ponty had drawn our attention\n(1945 [1962]). So, for example, in \u201cThrowing Like A Girl\u201d\n(1980) she points to studies which suggest that girls and boys throw\nin different ways and that women, when attempting physical tasks,\nfrequently fail to use the physical possibilities of their bodies.\nHere she is echoing the descriptions offered by Beauvoir. Also\nfollowing Beauvoir, Young suggests that the inhibited intentionality\ncharacteristic of female embodiment derives from the fact that women\noften experience their bodies as things/objects, \u201clooked at and\nacted upon\u201d (1980 [2005: 39]), as well as the source of\ncapacities. \u201cShe often lives her body as a burden, which must be\ndragged and prodded along, and at the same time protected\u201d (1980\n[2005: 36]). For Young, as for Beauvoir, such experiences of\nembodiment are not a consequence of anatomy, but rather of the\nsituation of women in contemporary society, but they point to\nsignificant ways in which female lived embodiment can be an obstacle\nto intentional engagement with the world.\n\nOther of Young\u2019s essays, for example, \u201cPregnant\nEmbodiment\u201d (1984), \u201cBreasted Experience\u201d (2005, but\na shorter version in 1992) and \u201cMenstrual Meditations\u201d (2005a), focus\non distinctive aspects of female embodiment that yield distinct ways\nof being in the world. Here the stress is not only on inhibited\nintentionality. There is also recognition that such experiences can\noffer alternative possibilities for embodied engagement that can be\npositive as well as negative. In her accounts Young stresses that it\nis such everyday ordinary experiences of embodiment, variable\nas they are, that constitute women\u2019s sense of their identity\nas women. Young develops this insight in a discussion of\nMoi\u2019s suggestion that we should replace categories of both sex\nand gender with the category of the lived body. Moi (1999) suggests\nthat the category of the lived body can capture the way material\nfeatures of our bodies play a role in our subjective sense of self,\nwithout giving a reductionist, biological account of such\nembodiment.\n",
