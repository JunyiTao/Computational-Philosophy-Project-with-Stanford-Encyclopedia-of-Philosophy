    "main_text": "The Problem of the Sophist || Appearances\n4.2 Appearances\n\n\nThe sophist is not unique in his tendency to turn up all over a tree.\nAnything, including very simple things, can do the same, because\npeople experience them in different ways and so have different\nconceptions of them. People tend to share the same concept of an\nangler, because he engages in a single observable activity. But\nanything of any complexity, engaged in several activities, is apt to\nbe conceived in different ways by different people. Some of those\nconceptions may capture the entity by a feature or activity essential\nto it, but many others will capture it in some accidental\nway. Division does not itself guarantee that one attends to essential\nfeatures. Furthermore, a dispute might arise about virtually any\nentity, but in many cases we can sort out disagreements by perception\nor by some straightforward decision-procedure (we can settle disputes\nabout number by counting, disputes about size or weight by measuring\nor weighing: Euthyphro 7b\u2013c; cf. Phaedrus\n263a\u2013b). In other cases there is no ready way to decide.\n\n\nThe anomalous sixth division of the sophist (Sophist\n226b\u2013231b) reveals sophistry as a disputed concept. Whereas the\nfirst five divisions locate the sophist somewhere under acquisitive\nart, the sixth division locates him in a quite different place, under\nthe art of separation, marked off expressly from productive and\nacquisitive art, as a third kind under techn\u00ea, to deal\nwith this case. The sixth sophist purifies souls of beliefs that\ninterfere with learning, and he looks a lot like Socrates. The\nStranger queries using the label \u201csophist\u201d in this case\nand calls the art he has just uncovered the \u201cnoble\u201d art of\nsophistry. The sixth division exploits the fact that many people\nmistook Socrates for a sophist (cf. Aristophanes\u2019 depiction of\nSocrates in the Clouds and Socrates\u2019 defense against the\ncharge in Plato\u2019s Apology). This definition fails to capture\nthe sophist by even an accidental feature, but instead snares a\ndistinct kind called by the same name owing to a superficial\nresemblance.\n\n\nThe sophist is special not because he turns up in so many places, or\nbecause some conceptions pick out different kinds altogether that\nmerely share the same name. The sophist is unique because the\nmultiplicity in his case reflects not only something about us and our\nexperience, but also something about him and his art. The Stranger\nrestates the six definitions of the sophist (Sophist\n231c\u2013e), and then observes:\n\n\nDo you know that, when someone appears to know many things, and is\ncalled by the name of one art, this appearance (phantasma) is\nnot sound, but it is clear that the person experiencing it in relation\nto some art is unable to see that [feature] of it toward which all\nthese sorts of learning look, and so he addresses the person having\nthem by many names rather than one? (Sophist 232a)\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranger has defined the sophist as a hired hunter of rich young\nmen, as engaged in selling his own and other people\u2019s wares for the\nsoul, as an expert in disputation about justice and injustice, and so\non. Why is the appearance not sound, and why does it indicate that we,\nwho experience that appearance, have failed to see that feature\n\u201ctoward which all these sorts of learning look\u201d? People\ncall all six conceptions by the name \u201csophist.\u201d Why does\nthe Stranger say that those who experience this unhealthy appearance\ncall the entity by many names instead of one?\n\n\nThe Stranger will go on to point out that the sophist makes people\nthink he knows things he doesn\u2019t know (Sophist\n232b\u2013233c). The sophist\u2019s pretense would certainly explain the\nunhealthiness of the appearance of manifold expertise, but the\npreceding discussion and definitions leading up to the quoted passage\nhave not revealed the sophist\u2019s pretense. One must look ahead in the\ndialogue to see that. Instead the unhealthy appearance seems to rest\non the very fact that the sophist, as so far defined, has so many\nsorts of expertise\u2014he knows how to hunt, how to make a profit,\nhow to sell his own intellectual wares, how to dispute about justice\nand injustice, how to purify the soul of ignorance (cf. Notomi 1999,\n80). Our judgment is unsound because we, who experience the sophist\u2019s\nappearance of manifold expertise, fail to detect that feature of his\nart \u201ctoward which all these sorts of learning\nlook\u201d\u2014something about the sophist that explains why he\nseems to know so much, something about him that would justify our\ncalling him by one name: \u201csophist.\u201d\n\n\nWhat is that one thing still missing? As the discussion proceeds, the\nStranger argues that we are missing the feature of sophists that\nexplains how they can successfully appear wise to their\nstudents, when they are not in fact wise (Sophist\n233b\u2013c). He and Theaetetus carefully defined the sophist in\nterms of many of his activities but none of those makes him what he\nis. They have so far missed the essence of the sophist, and for that\nreason they mistakenly call him by many names instead of one.\n\n\nThe visitor introduces a new paradigm (Sophist 233d) to\nunmask the special nature of the sophist\u2019s art: the art of\nimitation. By means of imitation a painter can make products with the\nsame names as the originals and fool children into thinking he can\nmake anything he wants (Sophist 234b\u2013c). The sophist\nachieves the same result with statements (logoi), making\nlarge things appear small, and easy things hard, and could fool young\npeople (Sophist 234c\u2013235a). All the appearances are\nlinked together by the sophist\u2019s skill at imitating people who truly\nknow the things he seems to know.\n\n\nWith that insight, the Stranger declares that they have nearly caught\nthe sophist and sets out in pursuit (he finally completes this seventh\ndivision at the end of the dialogue).  This time ignoring the entire\nbranch of acquisitive art from which the first five divisions set out,\nhe instead takes the branch of productive art down to image-making and\ndivides it into two parts, copy-making (eikastik\u00ea) and\nappearance-making (phantastik\u00ea). Whereas a copy-maker\npreserves the proportions of the paradigm (paradeigma in its\nmore usual sense), and keeps the appropriate colors and other details,\nan appearance-maker alters the true proportions of the original, so\nthat the image appears beautiful from a distance (Sophist\n235c\u2013236c). The visitor\u2019s proclaimed uncertainty about which\nkind includes the sophist takes him into the dialogue\u2019s main project,\nthe investigation of not-being, an investigation needed to make sense\nof appearances and false statement.\n\n\nThis appearing and seeming, but not being, and stating\nthings, but not true [things], all these were always full of difficulty\nin the past and they still are. It is very difficult, Theaetetus, to\nfind terms in which to say that there really is false stating or\njudging, and to utter this without being caught in a contradiction.\n(Sophist 236e\u2013237a)\n\n\n\n\nIn essence the sophist produces appearances, and \nmore precisely false appearances. So to understand the \nsophist, the inquirers have to make sense of appearances and their \nproduction. And to do that, the Stranger must take on Parmenides, who\nfamously said:\n\n\nNever shall this be proved, that things-that-are-not are. When you inquire, keep\nyour thought from that route. (Sophist 237a; cf. Diels and Kranz\n1951\u201352, 28B7.1\u20132)\n\n\n",
