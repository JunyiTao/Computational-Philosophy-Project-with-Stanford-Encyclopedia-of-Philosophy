    "main_text": "Criticisms of Neoliberalism || Inequality\n7.2 Inequality\n\nOne central concern about neoliberalism is that, even if it boosts\neconomic growth, it also increases economic inequality, which is\nproblematic in several ways. Two kinds of inequality criticisms are\ngenerally offered. The more well-known are the empirical criticisms\nthat neoliberal regimes lead to dangerous inequalities just from the\ndata, such as Thomas Piketty\u2019s book, Capital (2014),\nwhich holds that economic inequality is growing and is a threat to\ndemocracy, much as Martin Gilens\u2019s (2014) work on inequality and\nthe responsiveness of democratic policy-making to the richest 10%.\n\nThe other kind of critique of inequality under neoliberalism is\nderived from Rawls\u2019s work. As is well-known, Rawls rejected\nwelfare-state capitalism and a more robust form of capitalism which he\ncalled the system of natural liberty on the grounds that they do not\nsatisfy Rawls\u2019s two principles of justice (Rawls 2001;\nO\u2019Neill and Williamson 2014). Rawls argued that even\nwelfare-state capitalism cannot protect the value of political liberty\nor realize its priority (Rawls 1993 [2005]) because it allows for the\naccumulation of capital in too few hands, which leads to economic\ndomination of politics, and shuts many people out of the goods of\nowning and operating at least some of the capital they need to enjoy\nthe worth of their constitutional liberties.\n\nAnother kind of inequality that has been raised as a concern for\nneoliberal societies is the imbalance of political power within the\nfirm between bosses and workers. Elizabeth Anderson (2019) has argued,\nfor instance, that this is a form of tyrannical \u201cprivate\ngovernment\u201d and that the institutions defended by neoliberals\n(though she does not use this term) are insufficient to equalize the\nfreedoms of capitalists and workers.\n",
