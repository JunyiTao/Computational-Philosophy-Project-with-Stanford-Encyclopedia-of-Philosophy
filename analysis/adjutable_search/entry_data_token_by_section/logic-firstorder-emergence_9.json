    "main_text": "Kurt G\u00f6del\n10. Kurt G\u00f6del\n\nSo matters remained unclear throughout the 1920s. But the\nconstructivist ambitions of the Hilbert school, the focus on the\nanalysis of the quantifiers, and the explicit posing of metalogical\nquestions had made the emergence of first-order logic as a system\nworthy of study in its own right all but inevitable. The crucial\ntechnical breakthroughs came in 1929 and 1931 with the publication, by\nG\u00f6del, first, of the completeness theorem for first-order logic,\nand then of the incompleteness theorems. With these results (and\nothers that soon followed) it finally became clear that there were\nimportant metalogical differences between first-order logic and\nhigher-order logics. Perhaps most significantly, first-order logic is\ncomplete, and can be fully formalized (in the sense that a sentence is\nderivable from the axioms just in case it holds in all models).\nFirst-order logic moreover satisfies both compactness and the downward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem property; so it has a tractable model theory.\nSecond-order logic does not. By the middle of the 1930s these\ndistinctions were beginning to be widely understood, as was the fact\nthat categoricity can in general only be obtained in higher-order\nsystems. Lindstr\u00f6m was later to show (1969) that no logical\nsystem satisfying both compactness and the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nproperty can possess greater expressive power than first-order logic:\nso in that sense, first-order logic is indeed a \u201cnatural\u201d\nentity.\n\nBut the technical results alone did not settle the matter in favor of\nfirst-order logic. As Schiemer & Reck point out (2013), well into\nthe 1930s, even after the principal metalogical results had been\nachieved, logicians such as G\u00f6del, Carnap, Tarski, Church, and\nHilbert & Bernays continued to use higher-order systems (generally\nin some version of the simple theory of types). In other words, even\nafter the metalogical results there was a choice to be made,\nand the choice in favor of first-order logic was not inevitable. After\nall, the metalogical results can be taken to show a severe\nlimitation of first-order logic: that it is not capable of\nspecifying a unique model even for the natural numbers. Hilbert in\n1917/18 had treated first-order logic as a mere stepping-stone, and\nthe metalogical results can be taken to confirm the wisdom of his\napproach: If you want categoricity, then you are forced to move to a\nhigher-order system.\n\nAt this point in the 1930s, however, several other strands of thinking\nabout logic now coalesced. The intellectual situation was highly\ncomplex. The famous papers by Carnap, von Neumann, and Heyting at the\n1931 K\u00f6nigsberg congress had identified the logicist, formalist,\nand intuitionist schools: their debates were to shape thinking about\nthe foundations of mathematics for the next several decades. A search\nfor secure foundations, and in particular for an avoidance of the\nset-theoretical paradoxes, was something they shared, and that helped\nto tip the balance in favor of first-order logic. In the first place\n(as Weyl and Skolem had already pointed out, and as was at least\nimplicit in the Hilbert program) there were good constructivist and\nphilosophical reasons for avoiding higher-order quantification\nwherever possible, and for restricting one\u2019s logic to the first\norder. Secondly, several unambiguously first-order formulations were\nnow given of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and also of\nvon-Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory (which permits a finite\naxiomatization). The first-order nature of these theories was stressed\nin a number of publications from the 1930s: by Tarski (1935), Quine\n(1936), Bernays (1937), and G\u00f6del (1940). As a practical matter,\nthese first-order set theories sufficed to formulate all existing\nmathematical practice; so for the codification of mathematical proofs,\nthere was no need to resort to higher-order logic. (This confirmed an\nobservation that Hilbert had already made as early as 1917, though\nwithout himself fully developing the point.) Thirdly, there was an\nincreased tendency to distinguish between logic and set theory, and to\nview set theory as a branch of mathematics. The fact that higher-order\nlogic could be construed as (in Quine\u2019s later phrase) \u201cset\ntheory in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d reinforced the other\ntendencies: \u201ctrue\u201d logic was first-order; higher-order\nlogic was \u201creally\u201d set theory. By the end of the decade, a\nconsensus had been reached that, for purposes of research in the\nfoundations of mathematics, mathematical theories ought to be\nformulated in first-order terms. Classical first-order logic had\nbecome \u201cstandard\u201d.\n",
