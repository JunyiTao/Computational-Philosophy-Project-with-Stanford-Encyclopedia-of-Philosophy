{
    "main_text": "Freedom and Domination || Conclusion\n2.3 Conclusion\n\nFeminists in both the analytic and Continental traditions raise\nconcerns about a post-structuralist identification of the subject,\nincluding the feminist subject, with power. If women, like gay people\nand others, are the effects of discourses of power how can they also\nbe the agents of their own emancipation? Some feminists find this\nquestion to be so removed from the horrific lives many women live as\nto be farcical. For example, Nussbaum asks that we attend to\ncapacities and functionings and Fraser likewise insists that we move\naway from what she sees as purely cultural concerns to include\nsocio-economic ones. Others try to secure theoretical grounds for\nagency and autonomy outside of power.\n",
