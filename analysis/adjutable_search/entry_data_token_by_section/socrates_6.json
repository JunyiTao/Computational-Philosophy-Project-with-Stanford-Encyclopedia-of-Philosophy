    "main_text": "A Chronology of the historical Socrates in the context of Athenian history and the dramatic dates of Plato\u2019s dialogues\n4. Socrates outside philosophy\n\nSocrates is an inescapable figure in intellectual history worldwide.\nReaders interested in tracking this might start with Trapp\u2019s two\nvolumes (2007). Strikingly, Socrates is invoked also in nonacademic\ncontexts consistently over centuries, across geographical and\nlinguistic boundaries globally, and throughout a wide range of media\nand forms of cultural production.\n\nThough not commonplace today, Socrates was once routinely cited\nalongside Jesus. Consider Benjamin Franklin\u2019s pithy maxim in his\nAutobiography, \u201cHumility: Imitate Jesus and\nSocrates,\u201d and the way the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.,\ndefends civil disobedience in Letter from Birmingham Jail by\narguing that those who blame him for bringing imprisonment on himself\nare like those who would condemn Socrates for provoking the Athenians\nto execute him or condemn Jesus for having triggered his crucifixion.\nIn the visual arts, artist Bror Hjorth celebrates Walt Whitman by\ngiving him Jesus and Socrates as companions. This wood relief,\nLove, Peace and Work, was commissioned in the early 1960s by\nthe Swedish Workers\u2019 Educational Association for installation in\nits new building in Stockholm and was selected to appear on a 1995\npostage stamp. A more light-hearted linking is Greece\u2019s entry\ninto the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, Elpida\u2019s Socrates\nSuperstar, the lyrics of which mention that Socrates was earlier\nthan Jesus.\n\nAt times, commending Socrates asserted the distinctiveness of Western\nCivilization. For example, an illustrated essay on Socrates\ninaugurates a 1963 feature called \u201cThey Made Our World\u201d in\nLOOK, a popular U.S. magazine. Today Socrates remains an icon\nof the Western ideal of an intellectual and is sometimes invoked as\nrepresentative of the ideal of a learned person more universally.\nWhether he is being poked fun at, extolled, pilloried, or just\nacknowledged, Socrates features in a wide range of projects intended\nfor broad audiences as a symbol of the very idea of the life of the\nmind, which, necessarily from a Socratic viewpoint, is also a moral\nlife (but not necessarily a conventionally successful life). \n\nThere may be no more succinct expression of this standing than James\nMadison\u2019s comments on the tyrannical impulses of crowds in\nFederalist 55: \u201cHad every Athenian citizen been a\nSocrates; every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.\u201d\nThe persistence of this position in the cultural imagination is clear\nin his many appearances as a sober knower (e.g., Roberto\nRossellini\u2019s 1971 film) and a giant among giants, as in, for\nexample, his imagined speech, penned by Gilbert Murray, where he is\nplaced first among the \u201cimmortals\u201d featured in the 1953\nrecording, This I Believe,compiled by journalist Edward R.\nMurrow and linked to his wildly successful radio broadcast of the same\nname. But Socrates also persistently appears in funny settings. For\nexample, an artist makes the literally brainless, good-natured\nscarecrow featured in the 1961 animation, Tales from the Wizard of\nOz, answer to the name \u2018Socrates\u2019; and the Beatles\nmake Jeremy Hillary Boob, Ph.D., their sweet fictional character in\nthe 1968 film Yellow Submarine, respond to a question with\nthe quip, \u201cA true Socratic query, that!\u201d A more robust\nrecent example that mobilizes the longevity of Socrates\u2019\nassociation with reflection and ethical behavior is Walter\nMosley\u2019s crime fiction featuring Socrates Fortlow. His three\nbooks follow a Black ex-con in Los Angeles with a violent past and a\nfierce determination to live life as a thinking person and to do good;\nthe character says his mother named him \u2018Socrates\u2019 because\nshe wanted him to grow up smart, a reference to a naming custom\npracticed by former slaves. The association of Socrates with great\nintellect and moral rectitude is still kicking, as a quick glance at\nthe collection of Socrates-themed merchandise available from a wide\narray of vendors will attest. Further, in the mode of \u201cthe\nexception proves the rule,\u201d observe that in DC Comics, Mr.\nSocrates is a criminal genius able to control Superman by subduing him\nwith a device that disables him mentally. \n\nIn antiquity, Socrates did not act as a professional teacher of\ndoctrines; he did, however, self-identify as a knowledge-seeker for\nthe sake of himself and the benefit of those with whom he engaged,\nyoung or not. So firmly entrenched internationally in today\u2019s\nvernacular is his association with education that his name is used to\nbrand professional enterprises as varied as curricula designed for\nelementary school, college, law school, institutional initiatives that\nserve multiple disciplines, think tank retreats, caf\u00e9\ngatherings, electronic distance learning platforms, training programs\nfor financial and marketing consultants, some parts of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy, and easy-to-use online legal services. We find a\nless commercial example in Long Walk to Freedom (1994)\nin which the great South African statesman Nelson Mandela reports\nthat, during his incarceration for anti-apartheid activism, his fellow\nprisoners educated themselves while laboring in rock quarries and that\n\u201cthe style of teaching was Socratic in nature;\u201d a leader\nwould pose a question for them to discuss in study sessions. Another\nexample is Elliniko Theatro\u2019s Socrates Now, a solo\nperformance based on Plato\u2019s Apology that integrates\naudience discussion.\n\nIn U.S. education at all levels these days, Socratic questioning\nimplies no effort on the part of a leading figure to elicit from\nthe participants any severe discomfort with current opinions\n(that is, to sting like a gadfly or to expose a disquieting truth),\nbut instead uses the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 to invest with\ngravitas collaborative learning that addresses moral questions and\nrelies on interactive techniques. The unsettling and dangerous aspects\nof Socratic practice turn up in politicized contexts where a\ndistinction between dissent and disloyalty is at issue. Appeals to\nSocrates in these settings most often highlight the personal risks run\nby an intellectually exemplary critic of the unjust acts of an\nestablished authority. This is a recurring theme in politically minded\nallusions to Socrates globally. A wave of such work took hold in the\nU.S., Britain and Canada around WWII, the McCarthy Era, and Cold War.\nCreative artists in literature, radio, theater, and television\nsummoned Socrates to probe what it means to be an unyielding advocate\nof free speech and free inquiry\u2014even a martyr to belief in the\nnecessity of these freedoms to meaningful and virtuous human life. In\nthese sources, his strange appearance, behavior, and views, especially\nhis relentlessly critical, even irritating, truth-seeking, and\nanti-ideological posture are presented as testing Athenian\ndemocracy\u2019s capacity to abide by these ideals. They suggest that\nthe indictment, trial, and execution are stains on Athenian democracy\nand that a worrisome historical parallel is unfolding. These\nfull-blown interpretations of the life of Socrates require wrestling\nwith the whole issue of the historical Socrates; a claim to historical\naccuracy was a crucial part of any case for his story\u2019s being\ncredible as a warning. \n\nVisually, we find monuments and other sculptural tributes to a less\novertly political Socrates in cities and small towns across the globe\nin public spaces devoted to learning and contemplation. A stand-out\nfor its unusual focus is Antonio Canova\u2019s 1797 bas-relief,\n\u201cSocrates rescues Alcibiades in the battle of Potidaea,\u201d\nin which Socrates strikes a powerful pose as a hoplite. An 1875 piece\nby Russian imperial sculptor Mark Antokolski foregrounds the personal\ncost of Socrates\u2019s commitment to philosophy, portraying him\nalone, a drained cup of hemlock at his side, slumped over dead.\nReproductions of, and drawings based on, ancient copies of what are\nthought to be a fourth-century B.C.E. statue of Socrates by the\nAthenian Lysippus (e.g., the British Museum\u2019s Statuette of\nSocrates) are also in wide circulation. A particularly interesting one\ncan be found in graphic artist Ralph Steadman\u2019s\nParanoids, a 1986 book of Polaroid caricatures of famous\npeople. But the most influential image of the philosopher today is the\nriveting, widely reproduced, 1787 painting, \u201cThe Death of\nSocrates,\u201d by Jacques Louis David, now in the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It captures the\nphilosopher\u2019s own claim to be reverent, his courageous decision\nto take the cup of hemlock in his own hand, and the grief his unjust\nfate stirred in others. \n\nDavid\u2019s neo-classical history-painting has come to be a defining\nimage of Socrates. This is curious because, while the design of the\npainting abounds with careful references to the primary sources, it\nignores those sources\u2019 description of Socrates himself \u2014\nthe ones cited in section 1 on Socrates\u2019s strangeness \u2014\nrendering the old philosopher classically handsome instead. Attending\nto the primary sources has led some readers to wonder whether Socrates\nmight have had an African heritage. For example, in the 1921\n\u201cThe Foolish and the Wise: Sallie Runner is Introduced to\nSocrates,\u201d a short story in the NAACP journal edited by W. E. B.\nDu Bois, author Leila Amos Pendleton tackles the issue. Her character,\na bright girl employed as a maid, responds to her employer\u2019s\naccount of the physical appearance of the great man born before Jesus\nthat Miss Audrey intends to tell Sallie all about: \u201cHe was a\ncullod gentmun, warn\u2019t he?\u201d This prompts the following\nexchange: \u201cOh no, Sallie, he wasn\u2019t colored.\u201d\n\u201cWal, ef he been daid all dat long time, Miss Oddry, how kin\nyo\u2019 tell his color?\u201d \u201cWhy he was an Athenian,\nSallie. He lived in Greece.\u201d Nails (1989) depicted Socrates as\nan African village elder in a recreation of Republic 1. In\nthe visual arts, drawings and watercolors by the Swiss artist Hans\nErni resolutely portray Socrates as ugly as the sources describe him.\nSocrates also sometimes resonates as Black (or queer, or touched),\nindependent of any discussion of physical attributes; this follows\nfrom his renown for refusing to be defined by the stultifying norms of\nhis day. \n\nIn Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates says a recurring dream\ninstructs him to \u201ccompose music and work at it\u201d and that\nhe had always interpreted it to mean something like keep doing\nphilosophy because \u201cphilosophy was the greatest kind of music\nand that\u2019s what I was working at\u201d (60e\u201361a). In\nprison awaiting execution, he says he experimented with new ways of\ndoing philosophy; he tried turning some of Aesop\u2019s fables into\nverse. We might view some of the deeply thoughtful, even loving,\nengagements with Socrates in music and dance in light of this passage.\n\u201cSocrates\u201d is the fifth movement of Leonard\nBernstein\u2019s Serenade after Plato\u2019s Symposium\n(1954). He is the explicit inspiration for two works of choreography\nby Mark Morris, Death of Socrates in 1983, and\nSocrates in 2010, both of which work with 1919 compositions\nby Erik Satie that directly reference Socrates. And we have a work\nproduced in 2022 at HERE in New York, The Hang, the stunning\nproduct of a collaboration by playwright Taylor Mac and composer Matt\nRay.\n\nConjurings of Socrates appear outside philosophy as both brief but\ndense references to discrete features of this puzzling figure, and\nsustained portraits that wrestle with his enigmatic character. Details\nof the sources mentioned above, and other sources that may be useful,\nare included in the following supplementary document.\n\nResources for Teaching\n\n",
