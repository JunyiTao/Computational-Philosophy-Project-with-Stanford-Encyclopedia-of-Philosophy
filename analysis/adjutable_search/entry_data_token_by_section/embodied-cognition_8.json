Conceptualization\n\n\nReturning now to the three themes around which this discussion of\nembodied cognition is organized, the first is Conceptualization.\nAccording to Conceptualization, the concepts by which organisms\nrecognize and categorize objects in the world, reason and draw\ninferences, and communicate with each other, are heavily\nbody-dependent. The morphological properties of an agent\u2019s body\nwill constrain and inform the meaning of its concepts. The claim that\nconcepts are embodied in this way has been defended via quite distinct\nroutes.\n",
