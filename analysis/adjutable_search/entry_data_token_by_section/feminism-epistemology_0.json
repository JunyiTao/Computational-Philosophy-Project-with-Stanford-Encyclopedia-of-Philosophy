    "main_text": "Situated Knowers\n1. Situated Knowers\n\nFeminist epistemology conceives of knowers as situated in particular\nrelations to what is known and to other knowers. What is known, and\nhow it is known, reflects the situation and perspective of the knower.\nHere we are concerned with claims to know, temporarily\nbracketing the question of which claims are true or warranted. \n\nSituated knowledge in general. People may understand\nthe same object in different ways that reflect the distinct relations\nin which they stand to it. (1) Embodiment. People experience\nthe world by using their bodies, which have different constitutions\nand are differently located in space and time. (2) First-person\nvs. third-person knowledge. Individuals have first-personal\naccess to some of their own bodily and mental states, and knowledge about themselves, which differs from third-person\nknowledge about them. (3) Emotions, attitudes, interests, and\nvalues. People often represent objects in relation to their\nemotions, attitudes and interests, which differ from how others\nrepresent these objects.  A thief represents a lock as a frustrating obstacle while its owner represents the lock as a comforting source of security. (4) Personal knowledge of others.\nBecause people behave differently toward others, and others interpret\ntheir behavior differently, depending on their personal relationships,\nwhat others know of them depends on these relationships. (5)\nKnow-how. People have different skills, which may also be a\nsource of different propositional knowledge. (6) Cognitive\nStyles. People have different styles of investigation and\nrepresentation (e.g. preferring lumping or splitting). (7)\nBackground beliefs and worldviews. People form different\nbeliefs about an object, in virtue of different background beliefs. Such differences may lead a patient to interpret his symptoms as signs of a heart attack, while his doctor diagnoses heartburn. Differences in global metaphysical or political worldviews  may also generate different beliefs about particulars on a broader scale. (8) Relations to other\ninquirers. People may stand in different epistemic relations to\nother inquirers\u2014for example, as informants, assistants,\nstudents\u2014which affects their access to information and their\nability to convey their beliefs to others. \n\nSituatedness influences knowers\u2019 access to\ninformation and the terms in which they represent what they know. They\nbear on the form of their knowledge (articulate/implicit,\nformal/informal, and so forth). They affect their attitudes toward\ntheir beliefs (certainty/doubt, dogmatic/open to revision), their\nstandards of justification, and the authority with which they lay\nclaim to their beliefs and offer them to others. They affect\nknowers\u2019 assessment of which claims are significant or\nimportant.\n\nSocial situation. Feminist epistemology focuses on\nhow the social location of the knower affects what and how\nshe knows. It is thus a branch of social epistemology.\nIndividuals\u2019 social locations consist of their ascribed social\nidentities (gender, race, sexual orientation, caste, class, kinship\nstatus, trans/cis etc.) and social relations, roles, and role-given interests,\nwhich are affected by these identities. Individuals are subject to\ndifferent norms that prescribe different virtues, habits, emotions,\nand skills thought to be appropriate for their roles. They also have\ndifferent subjective identities\u2014identities incorporated into their self-understandings\u2014, and attitudes toward their ascribed identities, such as affirmation, rejection, pride, and shame. \n\nGender as a mode of social situation. In feminist\ntheory, \u201cgender\u201d refers to systems of meanings, social\nidentities, roles, norms, and associated behaviors, traits and\nvirtues, ascribed or prescribed to individuals on the basis of their\nreal or imagined sexual characteristics (Haslanger 2000). It also\nincludes individuals\u2019 subjective identifications with and\norientations to such meanings. Psychological traits are considered\n\u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d if they dispose\ntheir bearers to comply with the gender norms assigned to men and\nwomen, respectively. From a performative perspective, masculinity and\nfemininity are not fixed traits but contrasting styles of behavior\nthat may be manifested by individuals of any ascribed or subjective\ngender identity in almost any role (West & Zimmerman 1987; Butler\n1990). Finally, \u201cgender symbolism\u201d comprises metaphorical\nascriptions of gendered ideas to animals and inanimate objects.\n\nGendered knowledge. By joining the account of\nsituated knowledge with the account of gender as a social situation,\nwe can generate a catalog of ways in which what people know, or think\nthey know, can be influenced by their own gender (roles, norms,\ntraits, performance, identities), other people\u2019s genders, or by\nideas about gender (symbolism).\n\nThe phenomenology of gendered bodies. People\u2019s bodies are both differently sexed and differently gendered. Early child\nsocialization trains boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 bodies to different\nnorms of bodily comportment. Once internalized, such norms profoundly\naffect the phenomenology of embodiment. They inform men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s distinct first-personal knowledge of what it is like to\ninhabit a body, to express capacities unique to one sex or another\n(e.g., breast feeding), and to have experiences that are manifested\nthrough different body parts in differently sexed bodies (e.g.,\norgasm). They also cause men\u2019s and women\u2019s experiences of\ngendered behaviors that both can perform to differ\u2014in fluidity,\nself-consciousness, confidence, awkwardness, shame, and so forth. Some\nfeminist epistemologists argue that dominant models of the world,\nespecially of the relation between minds and bodies, have seemed\ncompelling to mostly male philosophers because they conform to a male\nor masculine phenomenology (Bordo 1987; Young 1990).\n\nGendered first-personal knowledge. It is one thing to\nknow what sexual harassment is in third-personal terms. It is another\nto recognize \u201cI have been sexually harassed.\u201d\nMany women know that women in general are disadvantaged have\ndifficulty recognizing themselves as sharing women\u2019s predicament\n(Clayton & Crosby 1992). The problems of self-knowledge\nare pressing for feminist theory, because it is committed to\ntheorizing in ways that women can use to improve their lives. This\nentails that women be able to recognize their lives in feminist\naccounts of women\u2019s predicament. Feminist epistemology is\ntherefore concerned with investigating the conditions of feminist\nself-understanding and the social settings in which it may arise\n(MacKinnon 1989).\n\nGendered attitudes, interests, and values. A representation\nis androcentric if it depicts the world in relation to male\nor masculine interests, attitudes or values. A \u201cmale\u201d\ninterest is an interest a man has, in virtue of the goals given to him\nby social roles designated as appropriate for men to occupy, or in\nvirtue of his subjective gender identity. A \u201cmasculine\u201d\ninterest is an interest a man has in virtue of attitudes thought\nappropriate to men. Such attitudes and interests structure the\ncognition of those who have them. For instance, they may influence how\nheterosexual men classify women as, e.g., differently eligible for\nsexual intercourse with them. A representation is gynocentric\nif it depicts the world in relation to female or feminine interests,\nattitudes, or values. An interest, attitude, or value might also be\nsymbolically gendered. For example, the ethics of care represents moral problems in\nterms of symbolically feminine values\u2014values culturally\nassociated with women\u2019s gender roles (Gilligan 1982). It is a\nsymbolically gynocentric perspective, even if men also adopt it.\nFeminist epistemology raises numerous questions about these phenomena.\nCan situated emotional responses to things be a valid source of\nknowledge about them (Jaggar 1989, Keller 1983, Pitts-Taylor 2013)? Do\ndominant practices and conceptions of science reflect an androcentric\nperspective, or a perspective that reflects other dominant positions,\nas of race and colonial rule (Merchant 1980; Harding 1986, 1991, 1993,\n1998, 2006, 2008; Schiebinger 2007)? Do mainstream philosophical\nconceptions of objectivity, knowledge, and reason reflect an\nandrocentric perspective (Bordo 1987; Code 1991; Flax 1983; Rooney\n1991)? How would the conceptual frameworks of particular sciences\nchange if they reflected the interests of women (Anderson 1995b, Rolin\n2009)?\n\nKnowledge of others in gendered relationships. Gender norms\nstructure the social spaces to which people with different gender\nidentities are admitted, as well as the presentation of self to\nothers. Inquirers with different gender identities therefore have\naccess to different information about others. Male and female\nethnographers may be admitted to different social spaces, and have\ndifferent effects on their informants. Research that elicits\ninformation about others through personal contact therefore raises the\nquestion of how findings might be influenced by gendered relations\nbetween researchers and subjects, and whether gender-inclusive\nresearch teams are in a better position to detect this (Bell et al\n1993; Leacock 1981; Sherif 1987).\n\nGendered skills. Some skills are labeled masculine or\nfeminine because men and women need them to perform their respective\ngender roles. To the extent that the skill is perceived by the agent\nor others as proper to someone with a different gender, performance of\nit, or social recognition of success in performance, may be impaired.\nThese phenomena raise various epistemic questions. Does the\n\u201cmasculine\u201d symbolism of certain scientific skills, such\nas of assuming an \u201cobjective\u201d stance toward nature,\ninterfere with the integration of women into science? Do actually or\nsymbolically \u201cfeminine\u201d skills aid the acquisition of\nscientific knowledge (Keller 1983, 1985a; Rose 1987; Ruetsche\n2004)?\n\nGendered cognitive styles. Some theorists believe that men\nand women have different cognitive styles (Belenky et al 1986;\nGilligan 1982). Whether or not this is true, cognitive styles are\ngender symbolized (Rooney 1991). Deductive, analytic, atomistic,\nacontextual, and quantitative cognitive styles are labeled\n\u201cmasculine,\u201d while intuitive, synthetic, holistic,\ncontextual and qualitative cognitive styles are labeled\n\u201cfeminine.\u201d It is seen as masculine to make one\u2019s\npoint by argument, feminine to make one\u2019s point by narrative.\nArgument is commonly cast as an adversarial mode of discourse, like\nwar, while narrative is viewed as a seductive mode of discourse, like\nlove. These phenomena raise epistemic questions: does the quest for\n\u201cmasculine\u201d prestige by using \u201cmasculine\u201d\nmethods distort practices of knowledge acquisition (Addelson 1983;\nMoulton, 1983)? Are some kinds of research unfairly ignored because of\ntheir association with \u201cfeminine\u201d cognitive styles (Keller\n1983, 1985b)?\n\nGendered background beliefs and worldviews. Representational\nschemes that are functional for different gendered roles and attitudes\nmake different information salient. The resulting differential\nbackground knowledge may lead differently gendered individuals to\ninterpret commonly accessed information differently. A man might read\na woman\u2019s demure smile as a coy come-on, where another woman may\ninterpret it as her polite and defensive reaction to unwanted\nattention. Such differences can spring from differential access to\nempathetic and phenomenological knowledge. These phenomena raise\nepistemological questions. Are there epistemic obstacles to legal\ninstitutions recognizing rape and sexual harassment, insofar as they\nconfine their thinking within a \u201cmasculine\u201d perspective\n(MacKinnon 1989)? Do sexist or androcentric background beliefs cause\nscientists to generate sexist theories about women, despite adhering\nto ostensibly objective scientific methods (Harding 1986; Harding\n& O\u2019Barr, 1987)? How might the social practices of science\nbe organized so that variations in background beliefs of inquirers\nfunction as epistemic resources (Longino 1990; Solomon 2001)?\n\nRelations to other inquirers. Gender differences in knowledge\ncan be reduced if differently gendered people participate in inquiry together. Each\ngender can take on testimony what the other can acquire through direct\nexperience. Each may also learn how to exercise imaginative projection more effectively, and to take up the perspective of another gender. However, gender norms influence the terms on which men and\nwomen communicate (Kalbfleisch 1995). In some contexts, women are not\nallowed to speak, or their questions, comments, and challenges are\nignored, interrupted, and systematically distorted, or they\naren\u2019t accepted as experts. Gendered norms of conversation and\nepistemic authority thus influence the ability of knowledge practices\nto incorporate the knowledge of men and women into their processes of\ninquiry. Feminist epistemologists explore how gender norms distort the\ndissemination of testimony and relations of cognitive authority among\ninquirers (Addelson 1983; Code 1991; Fricker 2007) and how the social\nrelations of inquirers could be reformed, especially with regard to\nthe allocation of epistemic authority, so as to enable more successful\npractices of inquiry (Jones 2002; Longino 1990; Nelson 1990,\n1993).\n\nProblems of and Approaches to Gendered Situated\nKnowledge. Mainstream epistemology takes as paradigms of\nknowledge simple propositional knowledge about matters in principle\nequally accessible to anyone with basic cognitive and sensory\napparatus: \u201c2+2=4\u201d; \u201cgrass is green\u201d;\n\u201cwater quenches thirst.\u201d Feminist epistemology does not\nclaim that such knowledge is gendered. Paying attention to\ngender-situated knowledge enables questions to be addressed that are\ndifficult to frame in epistemologies that assume that gender and other\nsocial situations of the knower are irrelevant to knowledge. Are\ncertain perspectives epistemically privileged? Can a more objective\nperspective be constructed from differently gendered perspectives?\n\n\nFeminist epistemologists have considered situated knowledge within\nthree traditions: standpoint theory, postmodernism, and empiricism.\nThe next three sections explain how these three traditions were\noriginally articulated, while\n section 5\n discussion their interactions and convergence.\n",
