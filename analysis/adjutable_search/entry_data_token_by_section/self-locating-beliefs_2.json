    "main_text": "Arguments and Examples || A dialectic-structuring device\n2.1 A dialectic-structuring device\n\nIn 1979, David Lewis and John Perry each offered arguments for a\ndistinctive category of self-locating belief (Lewis 1979; Perry 1979).\nTo understand the argumentative landscape, it\u2019s useful to think\nof both Lewis and Perry as first arguing that a particular theory of\nbelief is inadequate, and then offering different remedies for its\ninadequacies. We\u2019ll call that initial theory of belief the\n\u201cSimple Picture\u201d, then characterize rival theories in\nterms of how they supplement the Simple Picture to remedy the problems\nLewis and Perry identified.\n\nOn the Simple Picture, belief is a binary relation between subjects\nand possible-worlds propositions (or something like them\u2014more on\nthis in a moment), and the interesting and theoretically important\ndoxastic states of believers are states of believing\nP for possible-worlds propositions P. (So, in\nparticular, all the states required to fully account for what\u2019s\nhappening with people doxastically, to explain people\u2019s doxastic\nsimilarities and differences, and to give explanations of\npeople\u2019s behavior in terms of their doxastic states, will be\nstates of believing P for propositions P,\nwith propositions understood as sets of possible worlds.)\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good characterization of the view that Lewis\nwanted to demonstrate was inadequate, but we need to generalize a bit\nto bring Lewis and Perry under the same umbrella. Although\npossible-worlds propositions were Lewis\u2019s specific concern, the\nSimple Picture needn\u2019t work with possible worlds propositions in\nparticular\u2014it can operate with any type of proposition in a\nbroader category we\u2019ll call traditional propositions.\nTraditional propositions determine a possible-worlds truth condition.\nSo they take truth-values relative to worlds. And importantly for our\npurposes, they don\u2019t take truth-values relative to anything more\nfine-grained than worlds. So we\u2019ll never get two worldmates\nstanding in the belief relation to the same traditional proposition,\none thereby believing truly and the other thereby believing falsely.\nOn the Simple Picture, objects of belief represent ways for the world\nto be\u2014they impose representational demands on the world, and are\nanswerable to the world for their truth or falsity. Possible worlds\npropositions are, obviously, like this. So too are standard Russellian\nstructured propositions, constructed out of objects and properties.\n(The Russellian proposition constructed in the usual way from\nAristotle and wisdom is true in all and only the worlds in\nwhich Aristotle is wise.)\n\nWe can summarize the Simple Picture as follows:\n\n\nThe Simple Picture:\n\nBelief is a binary relation between believers and objects of\nbelief.\nThe objects of belief are traditional propositions.\n\n\n\nIn 1979, John Perry and David Lewis produced examples purporting to\nshow that this simple way of theorizing about belief was inadequate,\nbecause the family of doxastic states at its disposal\u2014states of\nbelieving that P for traditional propositions\nP\u2014couldn\u2019t explain some bits of behavior that it\u2019s\nimportant to be able to explain in doxastic terms, couldn\u2019t\ncapture certain sorts of ignorance and doxastic change, and/or\ncouldn\u2019t properly categorize believers so as to capture\nimportant doxastic similarities and differences between them.\n\nThinking about the dialectical situation this way helps frame the\nrelevant arguments and examples in terms of problems they raise for\nthe Simple Picture. We can then differentiate the various theories of\nself-locating belief by how they supplement the Simple Picture to\nremedy those problems.\n\nTo guard against historical misunderstanding, we note that not\neverybody endorsed the Simple Picture in the beginning of 1979, and\nthere were already examples and arguments in the literature making\ntrouble for the Simple Picture, on similar sorts of grounds, before\nPerry\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s 1979 papers (see for example\nCasta\u00f1eda 1966, 1967; Frege 1956; Wittgenstein 1953; Anscombe\n1975). But thinking in terms of problems for, and modifications of,\nthe Simple Picture is helpful for understanding the argumentative\nlandscape.\n",
