    "main_text": "Anthropogenic Climate Change || Recent Controversies\n5.4 Ethics and Climate Change\n\nThe issue of anthropogenic climate change raises a host of challenging\nethical questions. Most of these are beyond the scope of this entry on\nclimate science. A very brief discussion is provided here\nnevertheless, because the questions are important and because a full\nentry on the topic is not yet available. \n\nThe basic ethical question is: What ought to be done about\nanthropogenic climate change, and by whom? The question arises because\nthere is good evidence that climate change is already having harmful\nimpacts on both humans and non-human nature, and because continued\nhigh rates of greenhouse gas emission can be expected to bring\nadditional and more devastating harms in the future (Field et al.\n2014). Attempting to address this basic ethical question, however,\nleads to further, complex questions of global and intergenerational\njustice, as well as to questions regarding our ethical obligations to\nnon-human nature. Here are just a few examples: Do some nations,\nincluding those that have emitted large quantities of greenhouse gases\nin the past, have an obligation to bear more of the costs of climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation than other nations? (See, e.g., Baer\net al. 2009; Caney 2011; Singer 2016: Ch.2.) When considering actions\nto mitigate climate change, how should the harms and benefits to\nfuture generations be weighed against those affecting people today?\n(See, e.g., Broome 2008; Gardiner 2006.) How should impacts of climate\nchange on non-human nature, including loss of biodiversity, be taken\ninto account? (See, e.g., Palmer 2011.) Are there circumstances in\nwhich proposed geoengineering solutions\u2014such as injecting\nsulfate aerosols into the stratosphere or seeding the oceans with\ncarbon-absorbing phytoplankton\u2014are ethically acceptable? (See,\ne.g., Gardiner 2010; Preston 2013.) There is a large and growing\nphilosophical literature engaging with these and related questions;\nsome anthologies and book-length works include Arnold 2011; Broome\n2012; Gardiner 2011; Gardiner et al. 2010; Garvey 2008; Maltais and\nMcKinnon 2015, Preston 2016; Shue 2014; Singer 2016.\n",
