    "main_text": "Incommensurability and World-Change || Methodological Incommensurability\n4.1 Methodological Incommensurability\nThe incommensurability illustrated above whereby puzzle-solutions\nfrom different eras of normal science are evaluated by reference to\ndifferent paradigms, is methodological incommensurability. Another\nsource of methodological incommensurability is the fact that\nproponents of competing paradigms may not agree on which problems a\ncandidate paradigm should solve (1962/1970a, 148). In general the\nfactors that determine our choices of theory (whether puzzle-solutions\nor potential paradigm theories) are not fixed and neutral but vary and\nare dependent in particular on the disciplinary matrix within which\nthe scientist is working. Indeed, since decision making is not\nrule-governed or algorithmic, there is no guarantee that those working\nwithin the same disciplinary matrix must agree on their evaluation of\ntheory (1962/1970a, 200), although in such cases the room for\ndivergence will be less than when the disputants operate within\ndifferent disciplinary matrices. Despite the possibility of\ndivergence, there is nonetheless widespread agreement on the desirable\nfeatures of a new puzzle-solution or theory. Kuhn (1977, 321\u20132)\nidentifies five characteristics that provide the shared basis\nfor a choice of theory: 1. accuracy; 2. consistency (both internal and\nwith other relevant currently accepted theories); 3. scope (its\nconsequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain);\n4. simplicity (organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena);\n5. fruitfulness (for further research). Even though these are, for\nKuhn, constitutive of science (1977c, 331; 1993, 338) they cannot\ndetermine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy\nthese criteria may be disputable (e.g. does simplicity concern the\nontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical\nform?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room\nfor disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there\ncan be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one\nanother, especially when they conflict.\n",
