    "main_text": "William of Ockham || Property\n13.1 Property\n\nIn the first of these, the Work of Ninety Days, Ockham\ndefended against Pope John XXII the Franciscan claim that the highest\nform of religious poverty is to live without property or any other\nright enforceable by a human court. John had argued that no one can\njustly consume something without owning it. Marsilius and others had\nanswered that we can justly consume things we don\u2019t own if we\nhave the owner\u2019s permission. It was objected that permission\nconfers a right, and permission to consume transfers ownership. Ockham\nanswers by means of a distinction between natural rights and legal\n rights.[64]\n In the state of innocence ownership would have been contrary to\nnatural law because everyone had a natural right to use any thing\n(27.80\u20133, 313), but after the Fall natural law gave (or God\ngave) to human communities the right to enact human law assigning\n property,[65]\n i.e., assigning to individuals or groups the right to exclude others\nfrom using certain\n things.[66]\n This law binds morally, since we must respect agreements. Thus the\ninstitution of property morally \u201cties\u201d or impedes the\nnatural right to use things, so that in ordinary circumstances we\ncannot justly use another\u2019s things. However, the original\nnatural right is not altogether abolished; on some occasions we can\nstill exercise it. For example, if an object is unappropriated, we can\nuse it without asserting property rights over it. In circumstances of\nextreme need, we can use another\u2019s property to sustain life.\nEven outside a situation of necessity, we can use another\u2019s\nproperty with the owner\u2019s permission, not only to preserve life\nbut for any legitimate purpose. Permission sometimes confers a legal\nright, but sometimes the person giving permission does not intend to\ngive, nor does the person granted the permission intend to accept, any\nright enforceable in a human court; in such a case, if the permission\nis withdrawn, for good reason or not, the person who previously had\npermission has no legal remedy. Such permission to use property does\nnot confer ownership or any other legal right, or any new right of any\nkind, but merely \u201cunties\u201d the natural right to use. The\nnatural right is enough to make use, even consumption, just. The\nFranciscans can therefore justly use and consume things that belong to\nothers without having any legal rights, relying on the natural right\nto use untied by the owner\u2019s\n permission.[67]\n\n\nEchoes of the debate over property continued to reverberate down the\ncenturies, thanks in part to the inclusion of several of Pope John\nXXII\u2019s bulls in what became the Corpus iuris canonici.\nNotable figures in this regard include\n Richard FitzRalph,\n John Wyclif, Conrad Summenhart (Varkemaa 2012), Fernando\nV\u00e1zquez de Menchaca (1572 [post.]),\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n (1548\u20131617),\n Hugo Grotius,\n Samuel Pufendorf, and\n Locke.\n (See also Kilcullen 2001b.)\n",
