    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Function and Value\n4. What Rights Are: Function and Value\n\nGiven that, as explained above, \u201crights\u201d take different\nforms and combine in a variety of configurations (as well as greatly\nvary in content), what unites them under the single category of\n\u201cright\u201d? \n\nThe beginning of the answer is that rights are typically for or in\nsome sense entitle right-holders. Notice first that not all legal\nnorms exhibiting Hohfeldian forms are legal rights. For example, an\nimmunity from inheriting property rights on the grounds of one\u2019s\ngender hardly seems to qualify as a \u201cright\u201d (Lyons 1994:\n11); or, imagine a claim-\u201cright\u201d to be persecuted by state\nauthorities; or, consider a claim-right to die of starvation (Jones\n1994: 29). As these examples suggest (as do the counter-examples\noffered above to the notion that stand-alone privileges, powers, and\nimmunities necessarily qualify as \u201crights\u201d in normal\ndiscourse\n [Sections 3.1.2\u20143.1.4]),\n a feature seemingly differentiating rights from other norms\nexhibiting Hohfeldian forms is somehow entitling or fulfilling a\ncertain function vis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder. What,\nthen, is this \u201cfunction\u201d of rights? How, in other words,\ndo rights entitle right-holders? \n\nBut, before discussing the primary answers to this question, a few\npreliminary comments are in order. First, beyond clarifying our\nanalytic understanding of the idea of \u201cright\u201d, the\ntheories of the function of rights are justificatory. That is, they\nare typically value-laden, describing the uniting overarching feature\nor function of rights in terms of value to right-holders;\nthereby explaining a moral value putatively inherent to all rights,\nqua rights. Thus, although none of the theories on offer\nmanages to capture the entire scope of rights discourse, they do\ncapture core cases of rights, fleshing out what is inherently morally\nappealing about them. Succinctly, in one way or another, all these\ntheories share the insight that a legal system committed to rights is\noriented towards the ideal of treating the individual person as\nlaw\u2019s primary unit of concern. To paraphrase Thomas Hardy, if\n\u201cpoetry is emotion put into measure\u201d, then rights are\nliberal values put into law.\n\nSecond, this entry focuses on functions of legal rights as such,\nindependent of the content of any specific right. This is not to deny\nthat different legal rights (e.g., rights to freedom, property,\nagainst self-incrimination) are uniquely valuable to right-holders.\nOnly that such right-specific values are not the focus of this entry.\n\n\nThird, any necessary function that rights fulfill qua rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis right-holders sets a condition for\nright-holding. For example, under the Interest Theory, rights broadly\nspeaking benefit right-holders (see Section 4.2). Thus, if\na right does not benefit X, X does not hold that right.\nRelatedly, as demonstrated in the supplement to this entry (referenced\nbelow), the function of rights is intimately connected with the matter\nof what types of entities can or cannot as a general matter hold\nrights (see Jones 1994: 67\u201371; Kramer 2001: 29\u201358; Kurki\n2019: 62\u201388). For example, under the Interest Theory, if\nX is not the sort of entity that has interests, then X\ncategorically cannot hold any rights (e.g., Raz 1986: 166). \n\nThere are several competing theories on the function of rights. This\nentry focuses primarily on the two leading theories: the \u201cWill\n(or Choice) Theory\u201d and the \u201cInterest Theory\u201d. Some\nattention is also given to \u201cDemand Theories\u201d. Other\napproaches include Kamm\u2019s view that rights can protect\nright-holder\u2019s status as persons, such as respecting their\nagency or equal moral worth, regardless of their interests (2002:\n485\u2013487); \u201cHybrid Theories\u201d, combining elements from\nthe interest and the Will Theories (Sreenivasan 2005: 267\u2013274;\n2010: 484\u2013494; McBride 2017a); Wenar\u2019s\n\u201cMulti-Function Theory\u201d, denying rights have only a single\nfunction (2005: 246\u2013251), and his \u201cKind Desire\nTheory\u201d arguing that the function of rights turns on what\nrole-bearers desire in their capacity as bearers of that type of role\n(2013; Schaab 2018); And, Cruft\u2019s \u201cAddressive\nTheory\u201d, emphasizing the second-personal aspects of\ndirected-duties (2019: 44\u201370). \n\nThe debate over the theories of the function of rights revolves\nheavily on the theories\u2019 extensional adequacy (that is, to what\ndegree a theory adequately captures the discourse of\n\u201crights\u201d). While each of the leading two theories captures\nimportant instances of rights, neither manages to encompass the full\nparameters of rights discourse. The debate remains unsettled, with\never-growing nuance and ingenuity. See the supplementary document:\n\n\nExtensional Adequacy of Theories of Rights\n\n\n\nfor further details on some of this debate, including the primary\nchallenges and related refinements of the Will and the Interest\nTheories. \n",
