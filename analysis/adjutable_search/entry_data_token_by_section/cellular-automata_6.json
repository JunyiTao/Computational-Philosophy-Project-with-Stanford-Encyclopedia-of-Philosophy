    "main_text": "Some Basic Notions and Results || The Edge of Chaos\n2.4 The Edge of Chaos\n\nThe intermediate nature of Class4 rules is connected to the\nidea that interesting complexity, such as the one displayed\nby biological entities and their dynamics, lies in a middle area\nbetween the two extremes of boring regularities and noisy chaos: \n\n\nPerhaps the most exciting implication [of CA representation of\nbiological phenomena] is the possibility that life had its origin in\nthe vicinity of a phase transition and that evolution reflects the\nprocess by which life has gained local control over a successively\ngreater number of environmental parameters affecting its ability to\nmaintain itself at a critical balance point between order and chaos.\n(Langton 1990: 13)\n\n\nCA provided not just the intuition, but a formal framework to\ninvestigate the hypothesis. In the late Eighties the \u201cEdge of\nChaos\u201d picture received considerable interest by CA\npractitioners. Packard 1988 and Langton 1990 were the first studies to\ngive to the Edge of Chaos a now well-known interpretation in the CA\ncontext. As Miller and Page put it, \u201cthese early experiments\nsuggested that systems poised at the edge of chaos had the capacity\nfor emergent computation\u201d (Miller & Page 2007: 129). The\nidea is simple enough: what happens if we take a rule like Rule\n110 and introduce a small perturbation? If we are to believe the\nEdge of Chaos hypothesis, we should expect the rules obtained by small\nchanges in Rule 110 to exhibit either simple or chaotic\nbehavior. Let us consider a single switch from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 in the\ncharacteristic mapping of Rule 110. The results are the\nfollowing eight neighboring rules, each differing from Rule\n110 by a single bit (the diagonal in the array, with numbers in\nitalics):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n110\n111\n108\n106\n102\n126\n78\n46\n228 \n\n000\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 \n\n001\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n\n010\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n\n011\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n\n100\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0 \n\n101\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1 \n\n110\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1 \n\n111\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1 \n\nClass\n4\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n1 \n\n\n\nAt a first approximation, the Edge of Chaos hypothesis is confirmed:\nthree of the eight neighbors are Class3, three are\nClass2, two are Class1: Rule 110 is the\nonly Class4 in the table. To generalize these findings to\nthe entire class of rules for one-dimensional CA, Langton introduced a\nparameter, \\(\\lambda\\), that applies to each \\(\\phi\\): for \\(k = 2\\),\n\\(r = 1\\) (binary-state, unary-range) CA, \\(\\lambda(\\phi)\\) can be\ncomputed as the fraction of entries of the transition rule table that\nare mapped to a non-zero output (see Langton 1990: 14 for the general\ndefinition). In our case this means: \\(\\lambda(\\phi)\\) will be equal\nto the number of ones in the rule column\u2014e.g., \\(\\lambda(\\phi) =\n5/8\\) for \\(\\phi\\) = Rule 110 and \\(\\lambda(\\phi) = 1/2\\) for\n\\(\\phi\\) = Rule 46. Langton\u2019s major finding was that a\nsimple measure such as \\(\\lambda\\) correlates with the system\nbehavior: as \\(\\lambda\\) goes from 0 to 1, the average behavior of the\nsystems goes from freezing to periodic patterns to chaos. Langton\nsingled out 1/2 as the value of \\(\\lambda\\) at which the average\nbehavior first shows evidence of chaos: rules \\(\\phi\\) with\n\\(\\lambda(\\phi) \\sim 1/2\\) were highlighted as being on the Edge (see\nMiller & Page 2001: 133).\n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda\\)\nAll Rules\nChaotic Rules\nComplex Rules \n\n0\n1\n0\n0 \n\n1/8\n8\n0\n0 \n\n1/4\n28\n2\n0 \n\n3/8\n56\n4\n1 \n\n1/2\n70\n20\n4 \n\n5/8\n56\n4\n1 \n\n3/4\n28\n3\n0 \n\n7/8\n8\n0\n0 \n\n1\n1\n0\n0 \n\n\n\nBoth chaotic and complex rules have an average \\(\\lambda\\) value\naround 1/2, thus apparently supporting the Edge of Chaos hypothesis.\nIt is fair to say, though, that some have cast doubts on the\nexplanatory role of parameter \\(\\lambda\\) and the inferences drawn\nfrom it. In particular, the transition region of the Edge of Chaos\nseems to be itself complex. Miller and Page note that \u201cthere are\nmultiple edges, not just a single one\u201d (Miller & Page 2007:\n133). Aggregate results do not hold when we analyze individual rules,\neven paradigmatic ones:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n110\n111\n108\n106\n102\n126\n78\n46\n228 \n\n\\(\\lambda\\) \n5/8\n3/4\n1/2\n1/2\n1/2\n3/4\n1/2\n1/2\n3/4 \n\n\n\nAs the table shows, among the Rule 110 neighbors, some\nchaotic rules \\(\\phi\\) have \\(\\lambda(\\phi) = 3/4\\), some cyclic ones\nhave \\(\\lambda(\\phi) = 1/2\\) and, indeed, \n\n\nevery one of the rules classified as complex in this space has at\nleast one chaotic neighbor with a lower \\(\\lambda\\) value and one with\nhigher value. (Miller & Page 2007: 135) \n\n\nMelanie Mitchell, Peter Hraber and James Crutchfield replicated\nLangton and Packard\u2019s experiments, reporting very different\nresults (Mitchell, Hraber, & Crutchfield 1994). In particular,\nthey report that serious computational phenomena take place much\ncloser to a chaotic \\(\\lambda(\\phi) = 1/2\\) than it was previously\nthought. Apart from technical points, a conceptual flaw in the\noriginal findings is the use of aggregate statistics, which are\ndifficult to interpret in a high variance context: \n\n\nif, instead, the hypotheses are concerned with generic, statistical\nproperties of CA rule space\u2014the \u201caverage\u201d behavior\nof an \u201caverage CA\u201d at a given \\(\\lambda\\)\u2014then the\nnotion of \u201caverage behavior\u201d must be better defined.\n(Mitchell, Hraber, & Crutchfield 1994: 14). \n\n\nWhile it is fair to conclude that complex behavior does not lie at the\nEdge of Chaos taken in a simplistic sense (i.e., it is not\nstraightforwardly correlated with the simple \\(\\lambda\\)), the\ninterest in the connection between computational capabilities and\nphase transitions in the CA rule space has been growing since then. We\nwill consider such developments below, specifically in the context of\nCA and the philosophy of computation. \n",
