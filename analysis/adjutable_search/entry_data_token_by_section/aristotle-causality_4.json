    "main_text": "The Explanatory Priority of Final Causes\n5. The Explanatory Priority of Final Causes\n\nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes in order to provide the student of nature with the\nexplanatory resources indispensable for a successful investigation of\nthe natural world. However, the Physics does not provide\nall the explanatory resources for all natural\ninvestigations. Aristotle returns to the topic of causality in the\nfirst book of the Parts of Animals. This is a relatively\nindependent and self-contained treatise entirely devoted to developing\nthe explanatory resources required for a successful study of animals\nand animal life. Here Aristotle completes his theory of causality by\narguing for the explanatory priority of the final cause over the\nefficient cause.\n\nSignificantly enough, there is no attempt to argue for the existence\nof four fundamental modes of causality in the first book of the\nParts of Animals. Evidently, Aristotle expects his reader to\nbe already familiar with his general account of the four causes as\nwell as his defense of final causality. The problem that here concerns\nAristotle is presented in the following way: since both the final and\nthe efficient cause are involved in the explanation of natural\ngeneration, we have to establish what is first and what is second\n(PA 639 b 12\u201313). Aristotle argues that there is no\nother way to explain natural generation than by reference to what lies\nat the end of the process. This has explanatory priority over the\nprinciple that is responsible for initiating the process of\ngeneration. Aristotle relies on the analogy between artistic\nproduction and natural generation, and the teleological model that he\nhas developed for the explanation of artistic production. Consider,\nfor example, house-building. There is no other way to explain how a\nhouse is built, or is being built, than by reference to the final\nresult of the process, the house. More directly, the bricks and the\nbeams are put together in the particular way they are for the sake of\nachieving a certain end: the production of the house. This is true\nalso in the case of natural generation. In this context\nAristotle\u2019 slogan is \u201cgeneration is for the sake of\nsubstance, not substance for the sake of generation\u201d\n(PA 640 a 18\u201319). This means that the proper way to\nexplain the generation of an organism like an animal, or the formation\nof its parts, is by reference to the product that lies at the end of\nthe process; that is to say, a substance of a certain type.\n\nFrom Aristotle we learn that Empedocles explained the articulation of\nthe human spine into vertebrae as the result of the twisting and\nturning that takes place when the fetus is in the womb of the mother.\nAristotle finds this explanation unacceptable (PA 640 a\n19\u201326). To begin with, the fetus must have the power to twist\nand turn in the way it does, and Empedocles does not have an\nexplanation for this fact. Secondly, and more importantly, Empedocles\noverlooks the fact that it takes a human being to generate a\nhuman being. That is to say, the originating principle of the\ngeneration is a fully developed human being which is formally the same\nas the final outcome of the process of generation. It is only by\nlooking at the fully developed human being that we can understand why\nour spine is articulated into vertebrae and why the vertebrae are\narranged in the particular way they are. This amounts to finding the\nrole that the spine has in the life of a fully developed human being.\nMoreover, it is only by looking at the fully developed human being\nthat we can explain why the formation of the vertebrae takes place in\nthe particular way it does. (For further information about the\nexplanatory priority of the final over the efficient cause, see Code\n1997: 127\u2013143.)\n\nPerhaps we are now in the position to understand how Aristotle argues\nthat there are four kinds of causes and at the same time says that\nproper knowledge is knowledge of the cause or knowledge of\nthe why (APost. I 2, 71 b 10\u201312, II 11, 94 a\n20; Phys. II 3, 194 b 17\u201320; Metaph. I 1, 981\na 28\u201330). Admittedly, at least at first sight, this is a bit\nconfusing. Confusion dissolves when we realize that Aristotle\nrecognizes the explanatory primacy of the final/formal cause over the\nefficient and material cause. Of course this does not mean that the\nother causes can be eliminated or reduced to the formal cause. Quite\nthe contrary: Aristotle is adamant that, for a full range of cases,\nall four causes must be given in order to give an explanation. More\nexplicitly, for a full range of cases, an explanation which fails to\ninvoke all four causes is no explanation at all. At the same time,\nhowever, the final/formal cause is the primary cause and knowledge of\nthis cause amounts to knowledge of the why.\n",
