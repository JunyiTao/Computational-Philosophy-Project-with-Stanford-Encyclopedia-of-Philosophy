    "main_text": "Extant Philosophical Commentaries\n2. Extant Philosophical Commentaries\n\n\nThe early extant work of \u201cJohn the Grammarian,\u201d on ambiguous words in Greek\ndistinguishable only by their accent, is philosophically\ninsignificant. So I leave these aside, and pass on to give an overview in this section of his extant\nphilosophical writings, first and foremost his commentaries on\nAristotle. In order to appreciate the magnitude of Philoponus\u2019\nachievement as philosopher and scientist, one has to take into\naccount, at least partially, the intellectual culture in which he was\nbrought up. A common way that philosophers in late antiquity developed\nand propagated their own ideas was by composing commentaries on the\nclassical philosophical texts of Plato and Aristotle.  Generations of\nsuch commentaries were written from the time when Aristotle\u2019s works\nbecame again accessible to a wider audience in the first century\nBCE down to the seventh century CE and beyond, forming a rich and largely coherent\ntradition. The majority of ancient commentaries still extant today\nwere written by Neoplatonists as textbooks for their philosophical\ncourses. Typically, these works have a number of features in common:\n\nThe commentaries consisted in an extremely detailed oral exegesis\nof a philosophical text, designed for the benefit of students.\nNot uncommonly, selected pupils were responsible for taking\nverbatim notes of their teachers\u2019 exegeses, thus turning the\nlecture into a book roll.\nEach set of lectures and resulting commentary constituted a step\nwithin a substantial curriculum of philosophical training which began\nwith Aristotle and aimed at progressing towards Plato.\nA commentator was expected to demonstrate the agreement between\nPlato and Aristotle, indeed, to show forth the harmony among all\n\u201cancient\u201d philosophers (i.e., those down to the time of\nAristotle) including Homer.\nFinally, doing philosophy in this way was not only an education,\nit was also and even more so a pagan religious exercise, empowering\nthinkers to perfect their intellect and their character with a\nview to becoming godlike as far as is humanly possible.\n\n\n After a basic education in \u201cgrammar\u201d as well as studies in\nclassical Greek language and literature, John Philoponus, who was\nprobably born into a Christian family, embarked on this curriculum\n(ca. 510). As a pupil of Ammonius (ca. 440\u2013520) he assumed\nresponsibility for writing down the lectures of the school\u2019s by then\nailing head: Philoponus\u2019 commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s On Generation\nand Corruption, On the Soul, Prior Analytics\nand Posterior Analytics explicitly state in their titles that\nthey are based on Ammonius\u2019 seminars (ek t\u00f4n\nsynousi\u00f4n Amm\u00f4n\u00edou). The commentaries on the\nCategories, Physics and Meteorology do not\nmake such claims, which suggests, in conjunction with other evidence,\nthat Philoponus was by that time teaching these courses on his own.  He presumably\ntook over as lecturer from Ammonius at some point, although he never\nheld the chair of philosophy but remained in the status of a\n\u2018grammatik\u00f3s\u2019, i.e. a professor of philology.\nAfter the death of Ammonius the school\u2019s leadership seems to have\npassed into the hands of the mathematician Eutocius and then on to the\nphilosopher Olympiodorus (ca. 495\u2013570), who remained a pagan and, remarkably, still\ntaught in then-Christian Alexandria unperturbed as late as 565.\n\n In many ways, Philoponus\u2019 commentary on the Categories\nmay be regarded as typical of its kind. The exegesis of\nAristotle\u2019s text is prefaced by a general clarification of\nmatters of interest for the student who reads philosophy for the first\ntime. (Similar preliminaries can also be found as prefaces to\ncommentaries on Porphyry\u2019s Introduction.) Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical works were arranged in an order of increasing complexity,\nbeginning with the Categories, which deals with simple,\nuncombined utterances. This was followed by De\ninterpretatione (on propositions), Prior Analytics (on\nsyllogism) and Posterior Analytics (on proof). Discussing the\nproblem of the subject matter (skop\u00f3s) of the\nCategories, Philoponus says \u2013 roughly in agreement with\nIamblichus \u2013 that the Categories are about simple utterances\n(ph\u00f4na\u00ed) signifying simple things\n(pr\u00e1gmata) by means of simple concepts\n(no\u00eamata; In Cat. 10).\n\n Most Neoplatonists followed Alexander of Aphrodisias in regarding\nlogic not as a separate philosophical discipline (that was the Stoic view) but\nrather as philosophy\u2019s tool, its organon. In their\ncommentaries on the Prior Analytics, both Philoponus and\nAmmonius side with that tradition and reject the Stoic view, but they\nadd that in the case of Plato, dialectic may well be regarded as part\nof Platonic philosophy (witness dialogues such as Phaedrus\nand Phaedo) but also as an exercise in its own right serving\nas philosophical tool (witness the Parmenides;\ncf. Philoponus, In An.Pr. 6\u20139). The contemporary Athenian\nNeoplatonist Simplicius, who spent much acumen on repudiating and\nexcoriating Philoponian cosmological ideas, denied altogether Philoponus\u2019\ncompetence as a logician, and modern scholars tend to agree with\nhim. Historians of logic, however, acknowledge that Philoponus was the\nfirst to render a satisfactory account of the syllogism (subsequently\nthe traditional one), stating that the major premise includes the\npredicate term of the conclusion, the minor premise the subject term\n(In An.Pr. 67). In Philoponus, too, one encounters for the\nfirst time a particular diagram that schematised what kind of\nconclusions (i.e. universal affirmative, universal negative,\nparticular affirmative, or particular negative) follow from what kind\nof premises. This diagram, later to be called by the schoolmen\n\u2018asses\u2019 bridge\u2019 (pons asinorum), enabled students\nof logic more easily to construct valid syllogisms (In\nAn.Pr. 274).\n",
