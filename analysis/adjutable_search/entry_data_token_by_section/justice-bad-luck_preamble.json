    "main_text": "\n\nSome people end up worse off than others partly because of their bad\nluck. For instance, some die young due to a genetic disease, whereas\nothers live long lives. Are such differential luck induced\ninequalities unjust? Many are inclined to answer this question\naffirmatively. To understand this inclination, we need a clear account\nof what luck involves. On some accounts, luck nullifies\nresponsibility. On others, it nullifies desert. It is often said that\njustice requires luck to be \u2018neutralized\u2019. However, it is\ncontested whether there is any specific distributive pattern, e.g., equality, that eliminates the influence\nof luck can be described. Moreover, an agent\u2019s level of\neffort\u2014something few would initially see as a matter of\nluck\u2014might be inseparable from her level of\ntalent\u2014something most would initially see as a matter of\nluck\u2014and this might challenge standard accounts of just\ndeviation from equality (or, for that matter, other favored\ndistributive patterns). Critically, relational egalitarians argue that\nso-called luck egalitarians\u2019 preoccupation with eliminating\ninequalities reflecting differential bad luck misconstrues justice,\nwhich, according to the former, is a matter of social relations having\na suitably egalitarian character.\n",
