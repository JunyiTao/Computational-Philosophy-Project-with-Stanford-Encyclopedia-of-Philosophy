    "main_text": "Constituents of the Social World || Top-Down and Flat Approaches\n3.3 Top-Down and Flat Approaches\n\nAlthough it is common to distinguish individualism and holism as the\ntwo poles in debates over social ontology, the range of views\ndiscussed in sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2\n show that individualism is not the only alternative to holism. Even\namong those in 3.1\u2014ones that take the social to be built out of\nnon-social components\u2014there are both individualistic and\nnon-individualistic alternatives to holism.\n\n\u201cHolism\u201d too is diverse. Some theories are dualist: they\npropose separate spheres of the individualistic and the social, akin\nto the Cartesian distinction between bodies and mind. Others are\nmonist: they take the social to be fundamental or to have ontological\npriority. Still other theories put forward a \u201cflat\u201d\nontology, according to which entities of all kinds exist and yet stand\nin no ontological priority with respect to one another.\n3.3.1 Dualism\n\nDualism about the social is the view that social and non-social\nentities\u2014such as societies and individuals, or structures and\nagents\u2014are distinct, and neither is grounded in the other. In\nthe mid-twentieth-century individualism/holism debates (see Jarvie\n1972, O\u2019Neill 1973), holists were widely understood as endorsing\nversions of dualism. In those debates, defenders of holism did not\ndeny the existence of the non-social. Instead, they argued that the\nsocial cannot be reduced to individualistic entities.\n\nWork on the relation between minds and bodies strongly influences\narguments about social dualism. In particular, many philosophers of\nsocial science have adopted anti-dualist strategies pioneered by\nphilosophers of mind, especially the \u201cnon-reductive\nphysicalism\u201d developed by Davidson, Putnam, Fodor, Kim, and\nothers. As applied to minds, this is the view that there may be\nin-principle obstacles to reducing mental properties or facts to\nphysical properties or facts, even though the mental is exhaustively\ndetermined by the physical. Philosophers of the social sciences\napplied this to social entities in the form of \u201cnon-reductive\nindividualism\u201d. There may be obstacles, this view holds, to the\nreduction of social phenomena to individualistic ones, even though the\nsocial is exhaustively determined by the individualistic (Macdonald\n& Pettit 1981; Mellor 1982; Currie 1984; Kincaid 1986, 1997, 1998;\nTuomela 1989; Little 1991; Bhargava 1992; Pettit 1993, 2003; Hoover\n1995, 2001a, 2009;\nStalnaker 1996; Sawyer 2002, 2005; Schmitt 2003a; List &\nSpiekermann 2013). More recently, some philosophers have challenged\nthese arguments as inadequately characterizing the\n\u201csupervenience base\u201d (see sections\n 3.1.3\n and\n 3.1.4).\n These philosophers agree with the basic strategy for denying dualism.\nBut they deny that the \u201cindividualistic\u201d is the proper way\nto understand the building blocks of the social, arguing instead for a\nbroader set of building blocks.\n\nDualism has seen a resurgence among some philosophers of mind, e.g.,\nChalmers 1996. It is not clear, however, that the sorts of argument\nmarshalled in favor of mental dualism could apply to social dualism.\nFor instance, even if Chalmers\u2019 \u201czombie\u201d argument\nsucceeds for minds, there may not be a social analogue to the\n\u201chard problem of consciousness\u201d (see entry on\n zombies).\n3.3.2 Ontological priority of the social\n\nA different version of social holism is monist rather than dualist.\nInstead of postulating two or more spheres of substances\u2014social\nand non-social\u2014this version regards social entities to be\nontologically prior or fundamental, and individual people (and other\nentities) to be ontologically derivative on the social. This sort of\nmonism is often associated with Hegel (see\n section A.3.2 of the supplement)\n and the British idealists, such as Green 1866 and Bradley 1893.\n\nSome mid-century social theories also seem to take this position.\nClassical structuralism emphasizes the priority of structure over the\nindividual, following Saussure\u2019s arguments for the ontological\npriority of the linguistic system over the individual sign (1916). In\nits initial applications to anthropology, roles in a cultural system\nwere analyzed in terms of the system as a whole. By the 1960s,\nhowever, the point was applied not just to roles but to individuals\nthemselves. Althusser 1965 and Balibar 1965, for instance, argue for a\n\u201ctheoretical anti-humanism\u201d in which causal explanation is\npredominantly structural: \n\n\nMen only appear in the theory as supports for the relationships\nimplied in the structure, and the forms of their individuality only\nappear as the determined effects of the structure. (Balibar 1965) \n\n\nThe functionalist sociology of Talcott Parsons (1951) also prioritizes\nsocial structure over individual agency. Parsons is often understood\nas arguing that individual action is little more than a manifestation\nof social functions, and is severely criticized (e.g., by Garfinkel\n1967) on the grounds that he inappropriately discounts individual\nagency. It is not always clear, however, whether the explanatory\npriority of the social over the individual entails a claim about\nontological priority. Functional systems, even ones that strip\nindividuals of their freedom to act independently, may nonetheless be\nexhaustively grounded in \u201clow-level\u201d entities.\n3.3.3 Flat ontologies\n\nOther approaches reject any ordering or hierarchy of entities\naltogether. Some views deny that the sciences can be divided into\nhierarchies, but allow that certain entities are composed of others. A\nmore radical view is that there is no building at all among entities.\nA prominent example is Actor-Network Theory (Latour 2005, Callon 1999,\nLaw 2009). All entities, in this approach, are potentially on a par\nwith one another. Even identifying an entity or a class of things as\n\u201csocial\u201d is a mistake, according to Latour. Latour\ndistinguishes certain roles that objects can play: they can act as\n\u201cmediators\u201d, transforming meaning, and they can act as\n\u201cintermediaries\u201d, transmitting meaning without\ntransforming it. An atom, a person, a machine, a mountain, or a bank,\nhave equal potential to play these roles. All the\nscientist\u2014social or natural\u2014can do is to write narratives\nthat trace associations. Other approaches to flat ontology include\n\u201cassemblage theory\u201d (DeLanda 2006), \u201cobject-oriented\nontology\u201d (Harman 2005), and \u201cscale-free\nmetaphysics\u201d (Thalos 2013).\n4. How Social Categories and Kinds Are Set Up\n\nInquiry into the constituents or \u201cstuff\u201d of the social\nworld, discussed in the last section, is a huge field. But there is\nanother field of inquiry with an array of approaches in social\nontology: the inquiry into how social categories or kinds are set up.\nConsider, for instance, the fact Kanye and Kim are dancing the\ncha-cha. The \u201cstuff\u201d of the dance is the two people\nmoving around in some pattern. But, we might ask, what sets up the\ncategory cha-cha? Why do the moves determine what dance it\nis, rather than the material of floor they are dancing on or the brand\nof shoes they are wearing? What makes it the case that dances are\ncategorized into cha-chas versus sambas versus salsas; or, for that\nmatter, certain sequences of movement into dances versus strolls\nversus marches?\n\nHere are a few options one might start with:\n\n A crude mentalistic theory: the fact that the dance is a cha-cha\nis a product of the fact that I believe it is a cha-cha.\n A crude naturalistic theory: social categories are natural\nfeatures of reality, with the physical structure of the world breaking\nreality down into categories, one of which is the cha-cha.\n A crude linguistic theory: we define the word\n\u2018cha-cha\u2019, and that definition specifies the conditions\nfor an entity to be a cha-cha.\n\n\nThe following sections discuss more developed views taking off from\nthese ideas.\n Section 4.1\n discusses theories that are both mentalistic and\nindividualistic: i.e., those holding that the metaphysical source\nof a person\u2019s social categories is that person\u2019s own\nmental states.\n Section 4.2\n discusses mentalistic theories that involve many or all the mental\nstates of people in a community, rather than each person for herself.\n Section 4.3\n discusses theories that regard social categories to be set up by\npatterns of properties and causes.\n Section 4.4\n discusses theories that include practices in setting up social\ncategories, and\n section 4.5\n discusses pluralistic and heterogeneous theories.\n Section 4.6\n discusses the potential roles for language in setting up social\ncategories.\n\nImportantly, any given theory of the source of social categories can\ntake different positions on the topics discussed in\n section 3\u2014i.e.,\n on what the constituents or building blocks of social entities are. A\nset of theorists might disagree about how cha-chas (or other social\nentities, or entities in general) are constituted\u2014e.g.,\nby people, or patterns, or physical configurations of atoms, or\nsensible particulars, or impressions, etc. And yet all might agree\nthat a person\u2019s categories are set up by that\nperson\u2019s own mental states (compare, for instance, Berkeley\n1710, Russell 1929, and Dennett 1991). Conversely, a set of theorists\nmight all agree on how cha-chas are constituted, yet disagree on what\nmetaphysically sets up that category.\n4.1 Social Categories as a Product of Each Person\u2019s Own Mental States\n\nMany philosophical traditions investigate how individuals mentally\nconstruct, organize, categorize, or represent social objects\u2014and\nobjects more generally. Some views regard social categories to be\nconcepts that individual minds assemble in order to organize\nsubjective impressions. An example is a Lockean \u201cnominal\nessence\u201d theory of social categories (see\n section A.2.4 of the supplement).\n In this theory, a given person\u2019s social category\ncha-cha is an idea in that person\u2019s mind, formed out of\ncombinations of impressions or other ideas internal to that\nperson\u2019s mind.\n\nAt least until the middle of the twentieth century, the\nindividualistic-and-mentalistic theories were the prevailing\napproaches to the setup of the social world. These theories come in\nstaggering variety. Even classical structuralism in anthropology\n(e.g., L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1945, 1963) falls into this class, holding\nthat structures are unconscious sets of mental states. This brand of\nstructuralism has an individualistic rather than a distributed theory\nof how structure determines a person\u2019s social categories: each\nperson, according to L\u00e9vi-Strauss, has a mental structure that\ndetermines his or her own social categories. Later versions of\nstructuralism reject this individualistic treatment of structure.\n\nTo organize the class of individualistic-and-mentalistic theories, we\nmight distinguish the positions they take with respect to dimensions\nsuch as the following:\n\nThe extent to which social categories differ from person to\nperson: We seem to live in a single world, to have attitudes\nabout the same objects and propositions as one another, and to\ncommunicate about them. Are categories shared among people in a\nculture, between cultures, or universally? Intersubjectivity and\nobjectivity are acute problems for mentalistic theories of social\ncategories. In certain views, each person\u2019s private\n\u201cconceptual scheme\u201d may differ in subtle or stark ways\nfrom the schemes of others. Some hold that conceptual schemes may be\nsimilar among members of a community, as a result of collaboration and\ncausal feedback, but never identical. Alternatively, conceptual\nschemes and social categories may be less fine-grained, so that\ndifferences in people\u2019s mental states may not yield differences\nin their categories (cf. Mach 1886, Natorp 1888, Cassirer 1910, Quine\n1960, Foucault 1966 [1970]).\nHow integrated a person\u2019s category-determining mental\nstates are: Quine 1951 argues that our beliefs about the world\nare interconnected with one another, and that no belief can be\nassessed against our experience of the world on its own, in isolation\nfrom our other beliefs. Each person, according to Quine, forms a\n\u201cweb of belief\u201d by systematizing the stimuli the person\nreceives from the world. A person\u2019s ontological categories are a\nproduct of that network, and any change to the network affects the\nnetwork as a whole. Other approaches to the mentalistic construction\nof social categories are more piecemeal, with the determination of\neach category ontologically independent of one another.\nHow a person\u2019s social categories are related to that\nperson\u2019s concepts: Many theories of categorization in\npsychology (see Cohen & Lefebvre 2005) treat a person\u2019s\nconcepts interchangeably with the categories that person imposes on\nthe world. The so-called internalist versions of these theories take a\nperson\u2019s concepts to ontologically depend on states of the\nperson\u2019s brain alone. These theories take a person\u2019s\nsocial categories to be the same as her concepts, which are internal\nmental states. Other mentalistic theories of social categories do not\nfit this mold. It may be that a person\u2019s social categories are\ngenerated by that person\u2019s mental states, without the categories\nhaving to be conceptualized.\nWhether the mind \u201corganizes\u201d the world:\nMentalistic theories of how social categories are set up often\nimplicitly draw on a picture of the mind as \u201corganizing\u201d\nthe content that is \u201cgiven\u201d to it by the senses. Sellars\n1956 and Davidson 1973 criticize this picture, denying that there is\nany such \u201cgiven\u201d. Davidson rejects the distinction between\n\u201cscheme\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d, arguing that it is\nincoherent to hold that different people, or people in different\ncultures, have different \u201cconceptual schemes\u201d. In\nresponse, one might defend the scheme/content distinction, or else\nturn to a less mentalistic picture of the determination of categories\n(see\n section 4.4).\n Still other views\u2014such as various forms of idealism\u2014take\na mentalistic view of the setup of social categories without endorsing\na scheme/content distinction.\nWhether and how category-determining mental states are\nconstrained: Theories inspired by structural linguistics\n(Saussure 1916, Jakobson 1931, Chomsky 1965) hold that the mind limits\nthe possible variations among categories, and that a person\u2019s\ncategories are linked with one another. According to\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss, kinship structures are governed by universal\nrules, so only a limited number of forms of kinship are human\npossibilities (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1945). Some recent psychological\ntheories of categorization see humans as having specialized neural\ncircuits for processing different categories of objects (see Carey\n& Spelke 1994,\nCapitani et al. 2003,\nMahon & Caramazza 2009). Other theories propose constraints on the mechanisms by\nwhich categories are constructed by the mind (Kant 1781/1787, Cohen 1871). Still other\ntheorists regard the mental construction of social categories to\ninvolve generic mental processes (Piaget 1926, Mandler 2004).\n\n4.2 Social Categories as a Product of Community-Wide Mental States\n\nInstead of taking social categories to be products of individual\nminds, another class of theories holds that they are the products of\nthe minds in a community taken together. Hume 1740 argues that\npromises are a product of a social convention. We have a convention,\naccording to Hume, of the following form: words uttered according to a\ncertain formula incur an obligation. When someone utters a phrase of\nthe form \u2018I promise to S\u2019, the speaker is obligated\nto perform S. According to this theory, the conditions for an\nutterance to be a promise are set up by beliefs and expectations of\nthe members of the community at large.\n\nTheories in this broad class take different approaches to how\ncommunity mental states set up social categories.\n4.2.1 Social categories set up by agreement\n\nAgreement, according to some historical theories, is the source of\nlaw, language, and the state (see section\n 1.1, and \n also sections A.1 and\n A.2.1 of the supplement).\n Agreement still plays a role in contemporary theories of some social\nphenomena, but that role is typically to ground the obligations\nassociated with phenomena. For instance, according to the \u201cwill\ntheory of contract\u201d, contractual obligations are grounded by the\nintentional choices of each party to be bound to a commitment (see\nFried 1981, Barnett 1985). When it comes to setting up social\ncategories, it seems less likely that actual agreements are available\nto be their metaphysical sources. Instead, even theories that are\nputatively agreement-based tend to place agreement in a different\nrole. Gauthier 1986, for instance, advances an agreement-based theory\nof morality. By his account, however, the justification for moral\nclaims is based on what people rationally would agree to:\nidealized agreements, rather than actual ones, serve as the basis for\nmoral categories.\n\nAnother difficulty\u2014even if a given social category is the\nproduct of agreement\u2014is identifying which feature of an\nagreement does the \u201cmetaphysical labor\u201d in setting up the\ncategory. Suppose we employ a social category at time t\u2032\nwhich was a product of an agreement at time t. It may be that\nthe features of that category are a product of the mental states of\nparticipants at t, or of the utterances or acts of participants\nat t. Or perhaps what matters is the mental states of community\nmembers at t\u2032: that is, it is the synchronic trace of the\nagreement that sets up the social categories in a community at\nt, not the agreement itself.\n4.2.2 Social convention\n\nConvention-based theories are widely proposed for many social\nphenomena, including traffic rules, etiquette, laws, language, norms,\ninstitutions, morality, gender, codes of dress, and religion\u2014as\nwell as geometry, logic, truth, and necessity (see, among many others,\nQuine 1936, Lewis 1969, Schiffer 1972, Carter & Patterson 1982,\nGilbert 1983, Kekes 1985, Sugden 1986, Sidelle 1989, Friedman 1995,\nLagerspetz 1995, Young 1996, Bicchieri 2005, Bickhard 2008, Schotter\n2008, Marmor 2009, Azzouni 2014, Guala 2016).\n\nTo say that a social phenomenon is \u201cconventional\u201d\nsometimes means little more than that it is social, or that something\nabout the phenomenon is arbitrary, or a matter of choice. In social\nontology, however, conventionalist theories are understood more\nprecisely, following variants of David Lewis\u2019s 1969 analysis of\nconvention, or else following analyses of convention that challenge\nLewis\u2019s approach.\n\nLewis argues that conventions are solutions to coordination problems.\nIn interactive situations that have more than one\nequilibrium\u2014for instance, where it is rational for us all to\ndrive on the left or for us all to drive on the\nright\u2014conventions resolve the question of which actions to\nchoose. In his analysis, convention does not require explicit or tacit\nagreement, but instead involves the possession of various attitudes by\nmembers of the community, including beliefs, knowledge, expectations,\nand preferences (see the entry on\n convention).\n\nAmong the critiques of Lewis-style conventionalist theories are: that\nmany social phenomena do not appear to be solutions to coordination\nproblems; that they are excessively mentalistic, involving a complex\nstructure of beliefs, knowledge, expectations, and preferences of the\npopulation; and that they regard conventions as regularities in\nbehavior having certain characteristics, so the analysis rules out as\nconventions anything that is not exemplified in behavioral regularity\n(see Burge 1975, Millikan 2005). The critiques, however, are\ncomplicated by the malleability of the notion of convention: it is not\nclear whether these should be regarded as difficulties for\nconventionalism or for Lewis\u2019 analysis.\n4.2.3 Collective attitudes and dispositions\n\nAnother prominent set of approaches is closely related to\nconventionalism, but instead of appealing to structures of individual\nattitudes, these approaches take the social world to be set up by\ncollective attitudes and dispositions. (Some, though not all,\nof these accounts go on to analyze collective attitudes in terms of\nindividual attitudes. See\n section 5.2.)\n\nHart (1961) proposes a sociological basis for certain kinds of\nrules\u2014in particular, the rule regarding how valid laws are made\nin a society. A rule R, for Hart, is a rule in a society\nif two requirements hold: that members of the society behave in\nconformance to R, and that members of the society accept\nR as a standard of behavior in the society.\n\nSearle (1995, 2010) proposes a theory of those social facts he calls\n\u201cinstitutional facts\u201d. He modifies a Hart-style approach\nin three ways. First, he augments Hart\u2019s account of what it\ntakes for members of a society to accept a rule: he argues that the\ncommunity must collectively accept the rule (see\n 5.2\n on collective attitudes). Second, he does not require that rules be\nimplemented in behavior: institutional facts depend only on mental\nstates in a society, not on practices. Third, he argues that the\n\u201cconstitutive rules\u201d for institutional facts all share a\ncommon form: they involve a certain kind of status assigned to objects\nin the world. The general form of constitutive rules, according to\nSearle, is \u201cX counts as Y in context\nC\u201d. An object X counts as having the status or\nsymbolic function of Y in the context of a community. For\nexample: a line of stones (X) counts as having the status\nof functioning as a border wall (Y) in a village\n(C). Another example: a piece of paper issued by the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing (X) counts as having the\nstatus of functioning as money (Y) in the United States\n(C). Among the institutional facts, according to Searle,\nare social categories such as money, borders, cocktail parties, and\npublic offices. Tuomela (2002) advances a related collective\nacceptance theory of social entities.\n\n\u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir (2008, 2010, 2013) also regards many\nsocial properties to be a product of collective attitudes, but in a\nweaker sense than Searle. A social property is \u201cconferred\u201d\non an object, according to \u00c1sta, if the object has the property\nbecause of some attitudes of people. A baseball umpire, for instance,\nconfers the property of being a strike on certain pitches. Many\nproperties, \u00c1sta argues, should not be understood as being\nconferred by actual beliefs or acceptances of community members.\nInstead, conferrals should be understood in terms of ideal versions of\ncommunity members. At bottom, she understands conferrals to be a\nproduct of community dispositions: i.e., how members are disposed to\nuse concepts in counterfactual situations.\n4.2.4 Other mental states\n\nOther approaches also see social categories as being set up by the\ndistributed mental states of members of a society. Many of these\ntheories are less specific about the particular states that\nindividuals must be in. Husserl (1936, 1950) argues that how an\nindividual represents an object depends, in part, on the\npresupposition that others are representing it as well. Individual\nempathy for the representations of others plays a part in how the\nindividual herself constructs representations. The representations of\nobjects in a society, therefore, are a product of harmonized mental\nstates among its members. But these mental states are not required to\nbe attitudes or dispositions. Other theorists associate different\nmental characteristics with structuring social categories. Berger and\nLuckmann (1966), for instance, regard the identification of people in\na society with social roles as central to the characteristics of those\nroles.\n4.3 Pattern Theories\n\nMentalistic theories of social categories, whether individualistic or\nsocial, are sometimes criticized for overly fictionalizing the social\nworld. Some philosophers emphasize that social categories are\nroutinely used in the social sciences: the categories support\ninductive inferences, can be assessed statistically, and have causal\neffects. Such theorists argue that social categories are \u201creal\nkinds\u201d in the world, much like water and gold are \u201cnatural\nkinds\u201d. Some deny the distinction between social kinds and\nnatural kinds altogether, even while seeking to retain a role for\npeople in setting up social categories. Instead of regarding social\nkinds to be generated principally by mental states that we overlay on\nthe world, they treat social kinds as products of patterns\u2014often\npatterns of causes and effects\u2014in the world.\n4.3.1 Functional roles and realizers\n\nFunctionalism in social theory is predominantly an approach to social\nexplanation, providing causal accounts for the existence and\nmaintenance of social entities in terms of the functions they serve\nfor society. Some functionalist theories also make ontological claims,\narguing that the nature of social entities involves their\nfunctions.\n\nA common theme in functionalism is that people are often unaware of\nthe functions that their own activities perform. Merton (1957)\ndistinguishes the \u201clatent\u201d functions of an activity from\nits \u201cmanifest\u201d functions. In many contemporary societies,\nfor instance, people choose whom to marry on the basis of strong\nromantic attachments. One function of this practice is the manifest\nfunction of promoting happy long-term relationships. This motivates\nindividuals to marry for love. But, Merton argues, the practice also\nhas an underlying goal (the latent function): to minimize the role of\nfamily in the selection of a mate, thus leading to a kinship structure\nwith many marriages that join individuals from different communities.\nFunctionalists, then, often disagree with theories that treat social\nphenomena as cognitively transparent to members of a society.\n\nA function may figure into the ontology of a social kind K in any of\nseveral ways. The simplest is for K to be defined by a causal\nrole R that its instances perform. In that case, K is a \u201ccausal\nrole kind\u201d. Take, for instance, the role serving to minimize\nthe role of family in selecting a mate. Alternatively, certain\nsocial categories may better be understood as realizers of\nfunctional roles. A realizer-kind is often defined in terms of process\nor physical characteristics, where things that have those\ncharacteristics normally perform a role (see Block 1980, McLaughlin\n2006).\n\nAs analyses of social functional kinds, both role-kinds and\nrealizer-kinds have shortcomings. In particular, they miss out on the\nnormative character of functions. Cummins (1975) analyzes functions in\nterms of the capacities of the components of a system to contribute to\na capacity of a larger system. On his account, the function that an\nentity plays is sensitive to the context of the larger system in which\nit is embedded. Social kinds, then, may arise from components of\nsocial systems having particular Cummins-functions.\n4.3.2 Teleofunctions and tokens\n\nMillikan (1984) proposes a different approach to functional kinds,\narguing that they arise from the successive copying or reproduction of\nnew objects from older ones. A population of objects copied in the\nright way, and copied because they perform a function, form a\n\u201creproductively established family\u201d. Millikan (1999, 2005)\napplies this account to linguistic and social kinds as well as\nbiological ones. Millikan also analyzes social convention in terms of\nreproductively established families, and other theorists have recently\napplied her theory to artifacts (see\n section 5.5).\n\nA significant contribution of Millikan\u2019s approach is the\nconstitutive role of particular tokens in the world in setting up the\nkinds of which they are members. In her approach, the kind\nmarriage is partly set up by millions of particular marriages\ncopied one from another in a reproductively established family.\nParticular marriages\u2014the actual members of the kind\u2014figure\ninto setting up the kind marriage to have the membership\nconditions it does. Contrast this with a mentalistic account of the\nkind marriage. According to that sort of theory, particular\nmarriages are members of the kind, and may play a causal role in\ntriggering people to have certain attitudes. But it is the attitudes\nthat define the kind; the tokens do not play an ontological role. Thus\nMillikan proposes a more \u201cworld-involving\u201d and less\nmentalistic theory of how kinds are set up. Also see Burge 1986 for a\nsimilar insight.\n4.3.3 Causal loops\n\nSystems theorists in the 1940s and 1950s began to investigate feedback\nmechanisms of regulation and control, such as electronic circuits that\nloop their outputs back into their inputs in order to arrive at a\nstable equilibrium. Wiener (1948, 1950) applies this\n\u201ccybernetics\u201d to social systems, as do Mead et al.\n1950\u20131956, Parsons 1951, Ashby 1956. Bateson (1972) elaborates\nthese applications, describing social systems as involving\nhomeostasis, i.e., mechanisms that self-correct to stabilize their\nproperties.\n\nBoyd (1999a) applies\nhomeostasis to the analysis of kinds, both natural and social.\nAccording to Boyd, kinds are clusters of entities that stably have\nsimilar properties, with these similarities sustained by a causal\nhomeostatic mechanism. Marriage, for instance, is a kind because there\nare many particular entities with similar properties (such as being\nformed by ceremonies, involving couples paired up, and so on), and\nbecause there are mechanisms causing entities to have and keep these\nproperties. Like Millikan, Boyd argues that kinds are a product of\nactual tokens in the world and the causal processes in which those\ntokens are involved. Since his account involves actual causal patterns\nover time, kinds are historical, but they do not need to involve\nfunctional roles or evolution.\n\nHacking (1995) employs feedback mechanisms in a different way: rather\nthan emphasizing stability, he regards causal change to be\ncharacteristic of \u201chuman kinds\u201d. Hacking argues that human\nkinds are generated through histories of causal loops, in which\nobjects having a cluster of properties are named as being members of a\nkind. That label then affects the property cluster that they have,\nwhich changes the classification, and so on repeatedly, with human\ninterests changing the properties that get classified into the\ncategory. Hacking discusses the example of the kind refugee,\nin which categorizing people as refugees changes how they are treated,\nwhich then loops back to affect how we categorize refugees. In\nHacking\u2019s account, each loop includes a mentalistic\naspect\u2014the classification\u2014and an instantiated\naspect\u2014the causal effects on the properties. Butler 1993 and\nHayles 1999 develop accounts of the looping effects of classification\nsystems on human bodies (see also Schilling 2001). Mallon (2003, 2016)\ncombines the looping theories with homeostatic property clusters, and\napplies them to social kinds, races in particular.\n4.4 Theories of Practice\n\nA different large class of theories hold that practical engagement\nwith the environment is the basis for the setup of social categories.\nMany of these theories are influenced by Heidegger 1927, Merleau-Ponty\n1945, and Wittgenstein 1953. And still other theories are pluralistic\nand heterogeneous: they hold that social categories are not just set\nup in one uniform way, but in a variety of distinct ways.\n\nTheories of practice were discussed in\n section 3.2.4,\n as theories of the constituents or parts of social phenomena. Dances,\nfor instance, involve physical and mental routines: among the\nconstituents of a cha-cha are people\u2019s thoughts and actions on\nthe dance floor. However, theories of practice are not so easily\ncategorized. Particular tokens of dance routines might be understood\nas playing a dual role: not only are they the constituents of\ncha-chas, but they also are among the sources of the category cha-cha.\nIn this respect, theories of practice share an insight with certain\n\u201cpattern\u201d theories (see sections\n 4.3.2\n and\n 4.3.3):\n the tokens of the practices themselves do some of the work in\nstructuring the social categories into which the practices fall.\nGiddens (1984) gives an account of what he calls\n\u201cstructuration\u201d, the process by which social structures\nare dynamically generated by practices and also condition them.\nSahlins (1981, 1985) describes the formation of cultural categories\nthrough collisions between cultures and the actions of individuals.\nOther theories as well, such as Foucault (1976, 1977a) and Geertz (1973) can also be\nunderstood as giving accounts of how practices set up social\ncategories.\n\nBecause practices are so general and play so many roles in these\ntheories, it is a challenge to interpret them from the perspective of\nsocial ontology. It is hard to tease apart different kinds of\nontological claims they make, and also hard even to know when these\ntheories are making an ontological claim, as opposed merely to telling\na narrative of causal influence. Some theories of practice insist on\nthe importance of material routines in the world, and yet return to\nmentalistic-sounding accounts of the conceptual creation of the social\nworld. The centerpiece of Bourdieu 1972 [1977], for instance, is the\nclaim that social practice is generated by a\n\u201chabitus\u201d\u2014a mentally internalized system of\ndiscrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions. (See also\nOrtner 1984).\n4.5 Pluralistic and Heterogeneous Theories\n\nAs seen in the \u201cpattern theories\u201d discussed in\n section 4.3,\n approaches to biological and other scientific kinds are sometimes\nextended to social categories. Some participants in these debates,\nincluding Dupr\u00e9 (1995) and Hacking (2007), argue for a sweeping\npluralism about scientific kinds: they contend that there are myriad\nkinds of kinds, and that it is an error to regard some kinds as more\n\u201cnatural\u201d than others. Others argue for a more modest form\nof pluralism. Ereshefsky and Reydon (2015) argue that there are\nseveral distinct kinds of scientific kinds, including non-causal\nkinds, functional kinds, and heterostatic kinds. Along similar lines,\nmany theorists of race argue for pluralism with respect to racial\nkinds: though contemporary race theorists deny \u201cbiological\nessentialism\u201d, they argue that there are many ways racial kinds\nare constructed and used in contemporary societies (see\n section 5.4).\n\nEpstein (2008, 2014a) argues\nfor modest pluralism about the ways social categories are set up. He\nintroduces the term \u2018anchoring\u2019 to denote the setting up\nor putting in place of social categories or kinds. He proposes that\nall the theories discussed in\n section 4\n are theories of anchoring, but denies that social categories are all\nanchored in the same way. Instead, there are various \u201canchoring\nschemas\u201d. He cautions that we sometimes classify kinds according to\nhow they are anchored, but not in all cases.\n\nIn addition to pluralism about anchoring schemas, he also argues that\nanchors are heterogeneous (Epstein 2015): even for a single anchoring schema, the anchors\nthat feed into that schema\u2014i.e., the facts that metaphysically\nset up a social category\u2014are often diverse. Legal categories in\nthe U.S., for instance, are anchored by facts such as jury\ninstructions, trial results, legislative enactments, judicial\ninterpretation, and environmental regularities. Even theories of\npractice, he argues, do not have the resources to accommodate this\nheterogeneity.\n4.6 The Roles of Language\n\nMany theories in social ontology assign a central role to language. In\nconsidering the relation between language and sociality, we should\nseparate the following questions:\n\n Regarding the social nature of language: Is language private or\npublic, mental or social or environmental? This is discussed in\n section 5.7.\n Regarding linguistic entities as constituents of social facts: Do\ncertain social facts have linguistic components or building blocks?\nFor instance, a speech act may be a component of an instance of a\nhate-crime. This is discussed in\n section 3.2.3.\n Regarding roles for language in setting up social categories: Is\nour language part of the metaphysical explanation for why we have the\nsocial categories we do, such as dollar, woman, or professor? This is\nthe topic of the present section.\n\n\nAnswers to this third question can, in turn, be divided into two broad\nkinds of role for language: (a) social categories correspond to\nsemantic values, or meanings, of words; (b) social categories are set\nup by speech acts, discourse, or other features of a community\u2019s\nlanguage.\n4.6.1 Social categories as semantic values\n\n\u2018Cha-cha\u2019 is a word in the English language (yes, imported\nfrom Spanish). In some semantic theories, the meaning of that word\njust is the social kind cha-cha: the semantic value of the\nword is identical with the social category. This may or may not imply\nthat language plays a key role in social ontology. On a\ndirect-reference theory of meaning (see Soames 1987, Kaplan 1989,\nRecanati 1993), it does not. That theory argues that we encounter the\nkind cha-cha in the world\u2014a kind that is presumably\nsocially constructed\u2014and then connect the word\n\u2018cha-cha\u2019 to that kind. The inclusion of that word in our\nlanguage does not have any metaphysical bearing on the category.\n\nThe same may apply even if the name has causal influence on the\ncategory cha-cha. Hacking 1995 argues that the term we apply\nto a category has an influence on our practices, which in turn changes\nthe category. Even in this account, it is not clear that language has\na metaphysical bearing on the category: the practices ontologically\ndetermine the contours of the category, and the uses of the word are\nmerely one among many causal influences on those practices.\n\nBut in other theories of meaning, the order of metaphysical\ndetermination is reversed. Consider, for instance, a theory in which\nword meaning is derived from patterns of usage\u2014a theory, for\ninstance, in which the word \u2018cha-cha\u2019 derives its meaning\nat a time from uses of that word up to that time. Or consider a\ndescriptive theory of meaning\u2014a theory in which the word\n\u2018cha-cha\u2019 derives its meaning from the cluster of\ndescriptions that the English-speaking community associates with it.\nIf we add to these theories of linguistic meaning the further claim\nthat social categories are identified with semantic values, then it is\nlinguistic building blocks that set up the social kind\ncha-cha.\n\nThere are grounds for skepticism about equating social categories with\nsemantic ones. Sociologists often discover social categories that have\nnot been previously named, spoken of, or even conceptualized. This\nsuggests that semantic categories may not play quite so central a role\nin the metaphysics of the social world.\n4.6.2 Social categories set up by speech acts, discourse, features of language\n\nAustin (1961, 1962) points out that language is not only reserved for\ndescribing states of affairs in the world. Certain utterances are\n\u201cperformative\u201d: merely in uttering them, we establish\nfacts in the world. A minister, for instance, marries a couple with an\ninvocation. Searle (1995, 2010) argues that all \u201cinstitutional\nfacts\u201d are generated in this way. Every constitutive rule, he\nargues, is a product of a declarative speech act, although he\nqualifies this by holding that some declarations may be replaced with\nattitudes that have the same function (Searle 2010). He expresses\nskepticism that, in such acts, we genuinely create new entities in the\nworld, rather than merely taking attitudes towards \u201cbrute\nreality\u201d (cf. Sider 2001, Effingham 2010). Thomasson (2003)\nargues on the contrary for the reality of entities generated with\nspeech acts (cf. Wiggins 1980, Schiffer 2003).\n\nSeveral theorists argue not just that particular social entities are\nproduced by speech acts, but that the social world is the product of\ndiscourse more generally. This view has many historical antecedents in\nthe enlightenment and post-enlightenment (Aarsleff 1982, Ricken 1994,\nand Forster 2010), as well as in the early twentieth century, such as\nCassirer 1925 and Whorf 1944. But Wittgenstein (1953) is generally\ncredited with crystallizing this \u201clinguistic turn\u201d. Winch\n(1958) draws on Wittgenstein to argue that \u201cour language and our\nsocial relations are just two different sides of the same coin\u201d.\nSocial phenomena and their meanings, according to Winch, are\nmanifestations of the \u201cform of life\u201d in which a\nsociety\u2019s language-games are a part. This perspective has been\ninfluential in post-structuralism in particular, with a wide range of\ntheories advocating the linguistic construction of social reality.\nIncluded among these are Foucault\u2019s discourse analysis (Foucault\n1984, 2001) and Butler (1988)\u2019s treatment of the performativity\nof gender, with the speech acts that would appear to express gender\nactually being constitutive of gender identities. See Tannen, Hamilton\net al. 2015.\n\nRecent theories in post-structuralism have begun to de-emphasize\nlanguage, partly as a result of critiques that such theories focus too\nlittle on human bodies and physical experience. The notion of\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d is also often expanded to include practical\nactivities in the world (such as the \u201carchitectural\ndiscourse\u201d of constructed spaces). Theories of discourse,\nconstrued in this way, are difficult to distinguish from more general\ntheories of practice and heterogeneous theories.\n5. Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology\n\nThe preceding sections discuss general theories of social ontology.\nInforming these\u2014and informed by them\u2014is work on specific\napplications. The following sections briefly discuss prominent domains\nin social ontology to give a sense of the variety of these\napplications, to introduce some key topics, and to point to resources\nfor further reading. Corresponding to each these sections is an entire\nsubfield of philosophy and/or social science.\n5.1 Social Groups\n\nWhat are social groups? One debate in the literature concerns the kind\nof entities that social groups are: collections, classes, sets,\nfusions, structures, or some other kind of entity. It may seem natural\nto think of a group as a set of people in the mathematical sense.\nHowever, groups can persist through changes in membership, while sets\nare generally understood as having their members essentially (see\nSharvy 1968, Ruben 1985, Uzquiano 2004, Sheehy 2006). Effingham (2010)\nproposes an account that identifies groups with complex sets, so that\nthey can have different members at different times and at different\nworlds. Others (including Macdonald & Pettit 1981, Copp 1984,\nSheehy 2006) argue that groups are fusions of people. A problem with\nthis is the transitivity of parthood: since Alice\u2019s finger is a\npart of Alice, it follows from the fusion view that if Alice is a part\nof a group, then so is Alice\u2019s finger. That is a problem,\nbecause while Alice is a member of the group her finger is not.\nAnother view is that groups are realizations of structures: Schmitt\n(2003a) considers and objects to this, and Ritchie (2013) defends it.\nOthers argue that groups are distinct from their members but are\nconstituted by them (Uzquiano 2004, Jansen 2009, Epstein 2015).\n\nDifferent approaches to groups make different commitments with regard\nto the entities that should be included among the social\ngroups\u2014e.g., committees, teams, corporations, universities,\nnations, races, genders, red-haired people. Some theorists also\npropose that social groups must have certain distinctive\ncharacteristics, such as the members being in certain cognitive states\nor being subject to certain norms. Related to this is the question of\nwhether there are distinct types of groups. Ritchie (2015) argues that\nthere are two prominent types\u2014organized groups, which\nare realizations of structured sets of nodes that stand in a\nfunctional relation to one another, and feature groups, which\nare collections of people who have a property or feature in common\nwith one another. Thomasson (forthcoming) argues that an important way\nof characterizing groups is in terms of the norms they bear. Epstein\n(forthcoming) challenges simple typologies of groups and proposes a\nframework for the metaphysics of groups involving multiple\ndimensions.\n5.2 Group Minds, Collective Intentionality, and Group Agency\n\nCan groups take actions? Can they have intentions or beliefs? Can they\nbear responsibility? If so, how are these to be understood? Through\nmuch of the twentieth century ascriptions of intentions and actions to\ngroups were widely regarded as either erroneous or else merely\n\u201csummative\u201d: that is, for a group to have an intention or\ntake an action is merely for all the members of the group to have that\nintention or take that action (see Tollefsen 2015).\n\nSchweikard and Schmid (see entry on\n collective intentionality)\n find more nuanced approaches in Scheler 1913 and Walther 1923.\nScheler identifies various kinds of social entities, some of which\ninvolve people acting in solidarity, and Walther proposes an account\nof structured attitudes in terms of empathy. In the recent literature,\nGilbert (1989, 1990) introduces new reasons for denying summative\napproaches: members of social groups are subject to norms that do not\napply merely to individuals who have matching attitudes. If a couple\nis walking together to the store, one person violates a norm if she\nsuddenly takes off in a different direction without excusing herself.\nBut this would not violate any norms if collective intentions were\nmerely summative. Gilbert argues that social groups, as opposed to\nmere collections of individuals, are formed by the members making\njoint commitments. She describes the formation of such commitments,\nand analyzes group attitudes in terms of them.\n\nBratman (1993, 2014) is more concerned with demystifying shared\nintentions by explaining how they can arise from individual attitudes.\nInstead of searching for a general analysis, he proposes sufficient\nconditions for the formation of shared intention, as applied to the\ncase of \u201cmodestly social\u201d groups. These are small,\nunstructured groups of people, in which all members participate\nknowledgably in coordination with one another. Bratman analyzes shared\nintention in terms of the common knowledge of group members, together\nwith \u201cmeshing\u201d intentions by group members to perform an\naction by way of the actions and plans of the other members. Bratman\nargues that the norms Gilbert observes can be derived from these\ninterpersonal intentions together with standard moral obligations.\n\nTuomela and Miller (1988) and Searle (1990) account for group\nintention differently. Following Sellars (1968, 1980), they propose\nthat there is an overlooked class of attitudes that individual people\npossess: in addition to \u201cI-attitudes\u201d, individuals also\nhave \u201cwe-attitudes\u201d. According to Searle, these are\ndistinct primitive mental states. For a group to collectively intend\nJ, according to Searle, is for all the members of the group to\nwe-intend J. His view is somewhat similar to a \u201csummative\u201d\nview of group attitudes, except that collective attitudes are sums of\nwe-attitudes rather than I-attitudes. Tuomela and Miller also\ndistinguish attitudes in the \u201cwe-mode\u201d from attitudes in\nthe \u201cI-mode\u201d. The most unified form of group attitude, in\ntheir view, is made up of the members having we-mode attitudes. But\nfor Tuomela and Miller, we-mode attitudes are not primitive, but are\nbuilt out of more standard attitudes. They also admit different\nspecies of group attitudes, some of which are built of I-mode\nattitudes of group members, much like Bratman does. In recent years,\npsychologists and cognitive scientists have begun to investigate\nwhether there are distinctively social attitudes (see Knoblich,\nButterfill et al. 2011, Gallotti & Frith 2013, Tomasello\n2014).\n\nIn addition to collective intentions, other philosophers have worked\non the analysis of other attitudes, such collective belief and\njudgment (Gilbert 1987, Wray 2001, Hakli 2006, List 2014).\n\nThe analysis of collective attitudes raises questions about the nature\nof group minds more generally, and whether or not they are to be\nunderstood as extensions of individual properties applied to groups. A\nnumber of theorists take a functionalist approach to group minds and\nagency. On this approach, group agents or group cognitive systems are\nunderstood to function in a similar way as individuals do, at a\ncertain level of description. A widely accepted theory of individual\nagency is that people have a modular system that we use to navigate\nthe world. We have beliefs, knowledge, form intentions, plan, reason,\nand take action. All of these components can be described in terms of\ntheir functional contributions to the system, and they integrate with\none another to perform unified functions. They compose, in other\nwords, a \u201csystem of practical activity\u201d. Group agency is\nunderstood on this model: for group agents, the same functional system\nis realized, but by groups or distributed systems rather than by\nindividuals. (See Bratman 1987, 1993, 2014; List & Pettit 2011; Theiner &\nO\u2019Connor 2010; Theiner 2014; Epstein forthcoming). List and\nPettit argue that such realizers constitute new \u201cloci of\nagency\u201d, or \u201cgroups with minds of their own\u201d.\n\nOthers challenge group minds by arguing against functional treatments\nof mind altogether. Rupert (2014), for instance, argues that having\nphenomenal states is a requirement for intentionality, but that groups\ncannot have such states (see also Schwitzgebel 2015, List\nforthcoming). Other theorists object to the typical focus of this\nliterature on small unstructured collectives of adults interacting\nwith one another. They instead work on the attitudes of complex\ngroups, corporations, and large-scale systems (Hutchins 1995, Huebner\n2013). Questions of moral agency and corporate\nresponsibility may also bear on how to analyze group agency and group\nminds (see French 1979, Tollefsen 2002, Pettit 2007, Hess 2010, List\n& Pettit 2011).\n5.3 Institutions, Organizations, and Firms\n\nThe nature of institutions, organizations, and firms is treated more\nextensively in sociology and economics than in philosophy. Coase\n(1937, 1960) pioneered the literature on firms in economics. In\n\u201cThe Nature of the Firm\u201d, Coase examines the question of\nwhy firms exist at all: he argues that the function of firms is to\nlower transaction costs that would otherwise have to be incurred in\nforming contracts among individuals. Coase does not distinguish the\nquestion of the function of firms from the question of what firms are.\nBut subsequent work engages more directly with ontological questions,\nincluding eliminativism about firms (Alchian & Demsetz 1972), the\n\u201cnexus of contracts\u201d view (Jensen & Meckling 1976),\nthe \u201cproperty rights\u201d view (Grossman & Hart 1986, Hart\n& Moore 1990), and the \u201cresource view\u201d (Penrose 1959,\nBarney 1991, Conner & Prahalad 1996).\n\nWork on firms is also tied to theories of in institutions in\neconomics, spearheaded by Oliver Williamson, Douglas North, and Elinor\nOstrom. Williamson (1979, 1981, 1996) popularized a Coase-style\napproach with theories of how institutional structures such as\nmarkets, hierarchies, multidivisional corporations, and alliances\nsolve problems of transaction costs. Ostrom\u2019s influential work\non common pool resources treats institutions as sets of rules that\ncommunities put in place in order to change incentives and to induce\nsocially beneficial choices. The \u201cnew institutional\neconomics\u201d program develops this largely game-theoretic\nunderstanding of institutions, tying them to analyses of the nature of\nconventions and norms (see Shepsle 1986; Sugden 1986; North 1990;\nOstrom 1990, 1995; Binmore 1998; Schotter 2008; Guala 2016).\n\nRecent work in organizational sociology also focuses on systems of\nrules, with organizations analyzed in terms of their\n\u201cinstitutionalized\u201d features. Rather than the explicitly\nchosen rules discussed by economists, however, here systems of rules\nare regarded as tacit and non-intentionally followed (Powell &\nDiMaggio 2012). Sociological approaches have been developed for\ninterpreting organizations, largely focused on causal explanations for\ntheir structure, power, and influence. Work on the nature of\norganizations in sociology often involves analyzing them in terms of\nsocial components or properties (see Clegg, Hardy et al. 1996, Scott\n2014).\n5.4 Race, Gender, and Disability\n\nMuch recent interest in social ontology has been sparked by new\napproaches to race, gender, disability, and related social categories.\nHistorically, erroneous ontological claims have contributed to and\nbeen used to justify social oppression. Claims about the genetic\nnature of race, for instance, are historically tied to claims about\nintellectual, character, and cultural differences between racial\ngroups. Likewise, claims about the nature of gender differences are\nhistorically tied to claims about how women ought to behave.\n\nControversy over race categories, gender categories, and other\ncategories, pertains both to their construction and their essential\nproperties. The term \u2018essentialism\u2019, as applied to\ncategories such as race and gender, has a different meaning than it\ndoes in mainstream metaphysics. As applied to race, for instance,\n\u2018essentialism\u2019 is often understood as synonymous with\n\u2018biological essentialism\u2019\u2014the view that races have\nsimple, natural, and heritable biological properties, such that every\nmember of a racial group has that biological property. This should not\nbe confused with a metaphysical claim that might be made by a social\nconstructivist proposing a \u201csocial essence\u201d of race: for\ninstance, a claim that membership in a racial group essentially\ninvolves identifying with other people for reasons of solidarity, or\nthat it involves being descended from a historically and\ngeographically situated population. Such a theorist would flatly deny\n\u201cessentialism\u201d in the old sense, which still analyzing the\n(socially set up) essential properties of race (for a critique of\nessentialism, see Phillips 2010; see also entry on\n race).\n\nEliminativists argue that biological essentialism in the old sense is\ninseparable from our racial categories, so debunking racist views\nimplies that racial categories are an illusion: there are no races\n(Appiah 1985, 1994; Zack 1994, 1995). A different set of approaches\nmaintains that races are social kinds without having simple biological\nessences. Among these are historico-geographic theories,\ngenetic-bundle theories, identity theories, etc. (see Bernasconi &\nLott 2000, Zack 2002, Glasgow 2009). Other theories hold that although\nsimple biological theories are false, racial differences can be\nidentified using the methods of population biology (Andreasen 1998,\nKitcher 2007, Hardimon 2012; see also Kaplan & Winther 2014). In\nthe face of competing conceptions of race, some theorists propose\npluralism about race-like kinds (Hochman 2013, McPherson 2015). In\nmany theories of race, bi-racialism and multi-racialism have been\ntreated as boundary or marginal cases. Others argue, on the contrary,\nthat multiracialism is central to the construction of racial\ncategories (see Alcoff, Sundstrom et al. 2016).\n\nIn some ways, questions pertaining to the metaphysics of sex and\ngender resemble those pertaining to race: historically, descriptive\nand normative categories were conflated in simplistic biological\ntheories. An important difference between sex/gender and race,\nhowever, concerns the distinction between sex and gender (Beauvoir\n1949, West & Zimmerman 1987). Many theorists propose that sexes\nare biological categories and that genders are categories of social\nnorms and behaviors that are traditionally attached to sexes. However,\nother theorists argue that it is incorrect to regard sex as biological\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000, Butler 2004). Thus in the case of sex/gender,\nthere are arguably multiple socially constructed categories that\ninteract with one another; and some theorists reject the distinction\nbetween sex and gender (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n\nA question pertaining to racial and gender categories alike is whether\nthese are descriptively adequate categories in the first place. Many\nof the political phenomena associated with differential treatment of\ngroups and oppression cut across lines of race, gender, and class.\nSome theorists of intersectionality argue that it is misleading to\nregard standard gender and racial groups as if they were unified (see\nCrenshaw 1991, McCall 2005, Jones 2014).\n\nA central problem in the ontology of race, gender, and other\ncategories is that how we categorize not only has ethical\nimplications, but is affected by ethically-laden facts. Some theorists\nchallenge the idea of a purely descriptive analysis of such groups.\nOthers propose that there can be descriptive analyses, but that such\nanalyses are a stepping stone to ethically preferable categories.\nHaslanger (2000, 2012) in particular has argued for the\n\u201cameliorative\u201d analysis of racial and gender categories.\nPart of the role of social ontology is to analyze the concepts and\ncategories that are \u201coperative\u201d in a social system, but an\nequally important aim is to explore how we might otherwise construct\nsocial categories with the aim of social improvement. Barnes (2016)\nargues for an ameliorative account of disability (see entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n5.5 Artifacts and Artworks\n\nThe term \u2018artifact\u2019 denotes a broad class of objects that\nare products of human activity. The paradigmatic examples are tools,\nsuch as hammers, knives, and cups, but the category of artifacts\nincludes more complex objects as well, such as cars, houses, and\ncomputers. Some theorists conceive of artifacts broadly enough that\nthe category includes nearly all social entities, from hammers to\nHamlet.\n\nThe standard rough characterization of an artifact is that it is an\nobject created by people to perform some function (see Hilpinen\n1992a, Dipert 1993; entry\non\n artifact).\n This characterization excludes objects that are used to perform\nfunctions but are not made by a person. A rock might be used as a\nhammer, or a piece of driftwood as decoration. Other objects are made\nby people but without any functional intention, such as scraps of\nmetal produced in making a blade. The functionality of an object can\nalso be de-coupled from its making: someone might, for instance,\ndecide that an unmodified pile of scrap metal is sculpture.\n\nThis definition requires an understanding of the role\u2014and\nperhaps the necessity\u2014of intention. Many objects that we presume\nto be artifacts are not accompanied by human intentions directly. A\nmachine, for example, might automatically hammer out thousands of\nblades, which the machine stacks into boxes. A particular blade in one\nof those boxes would typically be considered an artifact even though\nno human was ever aware of that blade\u2019s existence, to say\nnothing of having created it for a reason. Millikan (1984) argues that\ncertain entities can be understood as having \u201cderived\nfunctions\u201d, when their intended role is part of the explanation\nfor their being reproduced. Thomasson (2003, 2007) develops this idea\nfurther, arguing that the function of an artifact is always in\nprinciple knowable to the creator. Elder (2004, 2007) develops\nMillikan\u2019s approach in an opposing direction, arguing that\nartifacts are copied kinds but need not be accompanied by creator\nintention.\n\nThese and other accounts hold that artifacts ontologically depend on\nhistorical facts, often historical intentions of the creator. Others\nargue that the emphasis on historical processes is misguided, and that\nwhat matters is how an object is used in the present (Keil, Greif et\nal. 2007; Preston 2009, 2013). Not everyone agrees that artifacts must\nhave a function (or an intended function). Objects such as doodles and\nrock stacks are created without either functions or functional\nintentions. Even if artifacts necessarily involve functions, the role\nof functions in distinguishing artifactual kinds from one another\nmight be debated. It may be that artifactual kinds are individuated by\nfunction, but many artifactual kinds (such as houses) seem to have\nmultiple functions, and some sets of distinct artifactual kinds (such\nas bicycles and tricycles) may all have the same function.\n\nTheories of artifacts draw from the literature on the ontology of art\n(see, for instance, Bloom 1996, Levinson 2007), and many theories of\nartworks regard them to be kinds of artifacts (see Eaton 1969,\nIseminger 1973, Hilpinen 1992b, Thomasson 1999).\n\nProblems in the ontology of art include the ontological categories\ninto which artworks fall, the unity or diversity of kinds of entities\nwithin artistic domains and across domains (e.g., in painting,\nsculpture, music, dance), the individuation of particular artworks,\nthe definition of art in general, and the dynamic changes in artistic\ncategories. See entries on the\n definition of art,\n history of the ontology of art,\n the philosophy of music,\n the philosophy of dance,\n conceptual art,\n and\n the philosophy of digital art.\n5.6 Money\n\nMenger (1892) tells a story of the emergence of money from trading\npractices. For a society to come to have money, Menger argues, it is\nnot required that anyone in the society made a choice to adopt a\nmedium as money. Instead, in the course of transactions in the\nmarketplace, the marketability of certain goods will tend to increase,\nand as a result, these goods acquire a degree of\n\u201cmoney-character\u201d. Money, in Menger\u2019s view, is\nsimply a good that is highly marketable in transactions, and therefore\nhighly liquid.\n\nThe centerpiece of Menger\u2019s account is the non-intentional\nemergence of money (see Aydinonat 2008, Tieffenbach 2010). But his\naccount also gives an implicit theory of the nature of money. Money is\na simple causal-role kind, with any good that is highly liquid and\nmarketable being money. Introductory economics textbooks tend to\ndefine money as a slightly more complicated role-kind: money is a\nstore of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account (Arnold\n2008, Mankiw 2016). Recent work in economics suggests a different set\nof functions for money. A striking feature of standard economic models\nis that money seems superfluous. In idealized neo-classical economies,\nthere is no need for a medium of exchange, nor is it clear why price\nlevels should affect the \u201creal economy\u201d of production and\nconsumption. Thus economists have recently investigated the economic\n\u201cfrictions\u201d that make money useful, and find that money\ncontributes to efficiency in a market that has imperfect\nenforceability of contracts and limited record-keeping. In such an\neconomy, money helps perform operations such as the search for trading\npartners. The overcoming of such economic \u201cfrictions\u201d\nseems to be an alternative and perhaps underlying function of money.\n(See Diamond 1984, Kiyotaki & Wright 1989, Kocherlakota 1998,\nWright 2010, Smit, Buekens et al. 2016.)\n\nThese discussions imply that money is a causal-role kind of some sort.\nThis is questionable, however: such a definition fails to accommodate\ntokens of money that fail to perform those roles (such as a coin\nburied in the ground). Instead, money may be better understood as a\ndifferent sort of functional kind, or perhaps as an artifactual kind\n(see\n section 5.5).\n Alternatively, the nature of money may not involve its functions at\nall. Aristotle (Politics 1.8\u201310) notes that there are\nseveral distinct functions performed by money, each of which would\nnaturally have its own essence; but he points out that we use the same\nmedium for all of these. The money in any given society, he argues, is\na product of agreement in that society.\n\nA story is sometimes told of a historical progression from barter to\nthe use of \u201ccommodity money\u201d (such as gold, cowrie shells,\nor beads) to the use of \u201cfiat money\u201d (such as\ngovernment-issued paper currency) (see Searle 1995, McEachern 2011).\nSearle argues that all kinds of money are \u201cinstitutional\nkinds\u201d, which he analyzes in terms of the collective assignment\nof a function to a substrate. Commodity money, in his view, involves\nassignment to a good with some intrinsic value, while fiat money\ninvolves assignment to a piece of paper printed by the government.\n\nHistorians of money and monetary theorists divide kinds of money along\nmore nuanced dimensions. A few historical cases may qualify as fiat\nmoney, such as in Ming dynasty China, revolutionary France, and the\nAmerican Confederacy, but these were fragile and subject to collapse\n(Yang 1952, Ferguson 2008, Spang 2015). But many contemporary\napproaches emphasize the role of private interactions in the creation\nof money, and importantly, reserve banking as well as credit and debt\nmarkets. Other theories emphasize the role of the state, and in\nparticular the central roles of interest-rate-setting institutions,\ngovernment debt, and the collection of taxes (see Friedman &\nSchwartz 1963, Kaldor 1985, Moore 1988, Deleplace & Nell 1996). In\nthese approaches, questions about the \u201csubstance\u201d of money\nbecome rather peripheral.\n\nSome controversies persist on the substance of money. It was part of\nhistorical debates over the gold standard and\n\u201cbimetallism\u201d, and more recently there has been\nphilosophical discussion of electronic money (Smith & Searle 2003)\nand \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d such as bitcoin. An ongoing problem\nfor work in the nature of money is the blurring of distinctions\nbetween questions about ontology, about the evolution of money, about\nwhat drives the money supply, and about what makes a monetary system\nstable.\n5.7 The Law\n\nMany important questions in social ontology are connected to\njurisprudence, or the study of the nature of law itself. Consider a\ngiven legal obligation or prohibition in a locality, such as a U.S.\nfederal law on reporting requirements for public corporations, or a\nstate law governing medical reimbursements. Lawyers and judges mainly\nwork on specific applications of such laws, such as whether a\nparticular corporation satisfying a particular reporting requirement.\nIn certain circumstances lawyers and judges investigate and interpret\nthe content of the law, such as whether some provision is incompatible\nwith the Constitution.\n\nThe study of the nature of law is distinct from these. It can be\ndivided into two principal inquiries, corresponding to the division\nbetween the \u201cconstituents\u201d and \u201csources\u201d\ndiscussed in sections\n 3\n and\n 4.\n The first inquiry examines what determines or grounds the content of\nlaws in general, within a legal system. For instance, is the content\nof a law exhaustively determined by the statutes recorded in the legal\ncode? Or is that only a part of what determines the content of a law?\nOther candidate contributors to the content of a law are historical\njudicial interpretations, jury decisions, patterns of practices,\nlegislative actions and intentions, executive statements, general\nlegal principles, and moral principles. Hart (1961) casts this\nquestion as the inquiry into the \u201crule of recognition\u201d in\na legal system: that is, what conditions a proposition needs to\nsatisfy in order for it to be a law (see also Dworkin 1967, 1978,\n1986; Greenawalt 1986; Shapiro 2007, 2009).\n\nA second question is: What are the sources of these contributors to\nthe content of the law? In virtue of what do texts or enactments or\ninterpretations or moral considerations figure into grounding the\ncontent of a nation\u2019s laws? Positivist theories hold that social\npractices and other sociological facts are the sources of legality;\nnatural law theories argue instead that legality is rooted in human\nnature and that legal standards are independent of human decision and\npractice. A central problem for any theory of the sources of law is\nthe authority, or bindingness, which law carries (if it does carry\nthese). See the articles in J.L. Coleman, Shapiro, & Himma 2002,\nas well as entries on the\n nature of law,\n natural law theories,\n legal positivism,\n and\n the economic analysis of law.\n\nOther issues in the ontology of law pertain to the nature of entities\nthat pervade the law, such as contracts (Fried 1981, Barnett 1985,\nHart & Holmstrom 1986), promises (Scanlon 1990, Kolodny &\nWallace 2003, Owens 2006, Shiffrin 2008), and torts (J.L. Coleman\n1982, 1983, Postema 2001). The law also plays a central role in\nsetting up certain social categories, such as marriage and\ncorporations. Marriage is tightly regulated by the law in many\ncultures. Does the law define what marriage is, or is marriage set up\nwholly or in part by social practices? Likewise for corporations: does\nthe law have a privileged role in determining what types of\ncorporations exist in a modern society, or are corporations products\nof social and economic systems? (See\n section 5.3.)\n\nSocial ontology also has implications for the practice of lawmaking\nand adjudication. Theorists of corporate liability, for instance,\ninvestigate the nature of corporate agency and responsibility, and the\nrelation between these and the agency and responsibility of individual\npeople connected to the corporation (French 1984, Fisse &\nBraithwaite 1993, Erskine 2003, Gobert & Punch 2003, Pettit 2007).\nThe law is also often called on to adjudicate ontological questions,\nsuch as whether goods of a certain kind fall under a clause of a trade\nagreement, or whether a particular act is an instance of a\ncriminalized activity.\n5.8 Language and Linguistic Objects\n\nMuch work in linguistics and the philosophy of language involves\nclaims and assumptions about the nature of linguistic entities, such\nas linguistic rules, components of the language faculty, and semantic\ncontent. Theories of the nature of language and meaning are also\ninfluential models for the metaphysics of other social entities (such\nas artifacts, institutions, and laws).\n\nThe most conspicuous debate about the \u201cnature of\nlanguage\u201d\u2014namely, the debate over innateness\u2014does\nnot have much to do with the metaphysics of language. Like most\nphenomena involving the human mind, language is causally affected by\nsocial factors. A person\u2019s vocabulary and grammar, for instance,\nare affected by interactions with parents, peers, and other community\nmembers. Just how significant these causal effects are is widely\ndebated in linguistics, with many in the Chomskian tradition favoring\ninnate constraints on the mental structures of language and others\nrejecting innatism (see Chomsky 1986, 2000; Tomasello 1992, 1995;\nElman, Bates et al. 1996; Kirby 1999). The question of the nature of\nlanguage, however, is to a large extent independent of innatism versus\nanti-innatism. Interactions with other people may contribute only a\nbit to an individual\u2019s mental structures, or they may\nfundamentally shape them\u2014but in either case a person\u2019s\nlanguage may or may not ontologically depend only on that\nperson\u2019s brain states.\n\nChomsky (1986) does take an explicit position on the nature of\nlanguage and its ontological building blocks. He argues that\nlinguistics is the science of \u201cI-languages\u201d\u2014i.e.,\ninternalized languages, the mental rules of grammar, phonology, and so\non, that individuals use in expressing themselves or understanding the\nutterances of others. He rejects\n\u201cE-languages\u201d\u2014externalized or public languages like\nEnglish, Chinese, and Khosa\u2014as unscientific fictions. Others\ndisagree on various grounds. Katz and Postal (1991) share\nChomsky\u2019s view that each person has his or her own language, but\nargue that languages are abstract or mathematical entities rather than\npsychological ones (see also Higginbotham 1991). Wittgenstein (1953)\nand his successors have a more substantive disagreement: Wittgenstein\ndenies the possibility of a \u201cprivate language\u201d altogether,\narguing that language is a matter of engagement of people with one\nanother and with the world. Other philosophers have argued for the\npublicity and externality of language on a variety of grounds,\nincluding the communicative basis of language, the nature of rules,\nand theories of semantic content (see Kripke 1972, 1982; Schiffer\n1972; Lewis 1975; Putnam 1975; Burge 1979; Brandom 1994; Dummett 1989;\nand entries on\n theories of meaning,\n externalism about mental content,\n names,\n and\n the normativity of meaning and content).\n\nTheories of words, phonemes, and other linguistic entities are tied to\nthe metaphysics of language more generally, but also are subjects of\nseparate inquiries. The extent to which these are questions for social\nontology, rather than, say, the metaphysics of psychological states,\ndepends in part on whether and how language is public. Kaplan (1990),\nfor instance, argues that words are entities extended over time and\nacross a population: \u201cutterances and inscriptions are\nstages of words, which are the continuants made up\nof these interpersonal stages\u201d. This approach is in contrast to\ntype-token theories, some of which regard word-types to be socially\nindividuated, and others individualistically individuated (see Hugly\n& Sayward 1981, Bromberger 1989, McCulloch 1991, Cappelen 1999,\nWetzel 2009, Hawthorne & Lepore 2011). The nature of words is also\ntied to the question of whether a word\u2019s meaning is essential to\nit (Kaplan 1990, Alward 2005, Simchen 2012), and to the distinctions\nbetween various types of words in linguistics, such as phonological\nwords, syntactic atoms, morphological words, and lexical words (see\nSelkirk 1984, Di Sciullo & Williams 1987, Hall 1999, Raffelsiefen\n1999, Julien 2007). Similar issues arise in connection with sentences,\nutterances, and quotation (Davidson 1979, J. Bennett 1988, Washington\n1992, Cappelen & Lepore 1997, Recanati 2001,\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2004b, Predelli 2008, Saka 2013).\n\nSpeech acts make up another domain in which social factors are\nplausibly constitutive. Austin (1962) and Searle (1969) argue that the\nforce of any speech act is a product of a social convention pertaining\nto speech acts of that type. Others use an\n\u201cintentionalist\u201d approach, in which the force of a speech\nact is a product only of the intentions of the speaker. Yet others\nargue that this force is a product of the uptake by hearers in\naddition to speaker intentions (see Strawson 1964, Bach & Harnish\n1979, Clark & Carlson 1982, Garc\u00eda-Carpintero 2004a, and entries on\n speech acts,\n assertion).",
