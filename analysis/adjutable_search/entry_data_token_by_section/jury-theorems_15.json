    "main_text": "Problems and Questions || Are correctness facts underdetermined?\n4.2 Are correctness facts underdetermined?\n\nMany group decision problems display what might be called Possible\nUnderdetermination: the true state of the world can (with\nnon-zero probability) be objectively underdetermined by the totality\nof influences on (one or more individuals in) the population, which\nincludes all\n evidence.[15]\n A jury\u2019s choice between \u201cguilty\u201d and\n\u201cinnocent\u201d verdicts normally displays Possible\nUnderdetermination, since the total available evidence can be\nobjectively inconclusive (despite supporting one of these states).\nDietrich and List\u2019s (2004) jury model implicitly assumes\nPossible Underdetermination, because even the ideal interpretation of\ntotal evidence can be incorrect. Landemore (2013: 145) mentions\nsettings in which the correctness of the decision remains objectively\nuncertain, since the truth is never revealed with certainty. This\ncould be interpreted as a strong (\u201cpersisting\u201d) type of\nunderdetermination: the truth is objectively underdetermined not just\nby the influences at the time of decision, but even by all future\ninfluences.\n\nPossible Underdetermination implies that individual judgments, the\ngroup judgment, and even the asymptotic group judgment (as group size\nincreases) are all fallible, i.e., incorrect with non-zero\nprobability. The reason is simple: each of these judgments is\ndetermined by something (the total influences) that can underdetermine\nthe state, hence does not always match the state.\n\nExceptions exist. When mathematicians vote on the truth of a\nmathematical conjecture, the correct decision is given by logical\nfacts, hence is never underdetermined. Even then, individual judgments\nand (finite or asymptotic) group judgments can be incorrect, because\nof a positive probability that the objectively accessible truth is not\nsubjectively recognized, say due to subjectively misleading evidence,\nintransparent logical facts, or distracting circumstances.\n\nThe lesson is that the infallibility hypothesis is untenable under\nPossible Underdetermination, and dubious even without Possible\nUnderdetermination. The next subsection will, however, discuss a\nspecial scenario in which the group is asymptotically\ninfallible.\n",
