He assumed the role of\nphilosophical adviser and critical collaborator of Goethe and\nespecially Schiller. Through his discerning criticism he furthered the\nproduction of some of their important works, for example Schiller\u2019s\nBriefe \u00fcber die \u00c4sthetische Erziehung des Menschen\nof 1795 (Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man), and his\nphilosophical poems as well as Goethe\u2019s epic Herrmann und\nDorothea and his novel Wilhelm Meister. For Schiller\u2019s\nnewly created journal, Die Horen, he authored two important\ncontributions, \u201cUeber den\nGeschlechts-Unterschied\u201d (\u201cOn Sexual\nDifference\u201d) where he formulated a gender theory on the basis of\ncontemporary natural philosophy and \u201cUeber m\u00e4nnliche\nund weibliche Form\u201d (\u201cOn the Male and Female\nForm\u201d) where he extended this theory into the realm of the arts\nand culture (1794, 1795, GS Vol 1: 311\u201334, 335\u201369). While\nin Jena he joined forces with his brother Alexander and Goethe and\ntogether the three men engaged in a study of the evolving new\ndiscipline of comparative anatomy at the University. Humboldt used the\ninsights he had gained from this study to create a comprehensive\nblueprint for a future comparative anthropology (\u201cPlan einer\nvergleichenden Anthropologie\u201d (1797, GS Vol 1: 377\u2013410).\nBut only years later when he attempted to lay the foundation for his\nnewly conceived discipline of general and comparative linguistics, he\nwould return to it and rework his ideas.\n\nGuided by his anthropological interests, however, Humboldt became\ninvolved in the problem of what constituted national character and how\nprecisely one could within the context of modern Europe determine its\nessential features. Thus in 1797 he composed an extensive study in a\ngenre of what we might call today \u201ccultural and historical\ncriticism\u201d entitled: Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert\n(The Eighteenth Century, GS Vol 2: 1\u2013112). He would\nsoon have the opportunity to gather his own observations on those\nissues, when in the fall of 1797 he and his family moved to Paris\nwhere they would remain until the summer of 1801. This extended\nsojourn was interrupted by two extended journeys to Spain, from\nNovember 1799 to April 1800 and again in the spring and summer of\n1801, the purpose of the latter being a visit to the Basque country in\norder to study the Basque language and culture.\n",
