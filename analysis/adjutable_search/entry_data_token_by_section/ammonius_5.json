    "main_text": "Philosophical Positions || Aristotle\u2019s God as Efficient Cause of the World\n3.2 Aristotle\u2019s God as Efficient Cause of the World\n\nAristotle\u2019s intellectual God seems not to be a good fit for the\nrole of craftsman and creator which God plays in Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus. Proclus (in Tim. 1.266.28\u2013268.24)\nsays as much: while \u201cthe Peripatetics say there is something\nseparate [from the physical world], it is not creative\n(poi\u0113tik\u0113), but final (telikon); hence they\nboth removed the exemplars (paradeigmata) and set a\nnon-plural intelligence over all things.\u201d Indeed, Proclus says,\nAristotle\u2019s own principles ought to have made him admit that God\nwas a creator. According to Simplicius, Peripatetic interpreters,\nincluding Alexander of Aphrodisias, accepted that God was a final\ncause of the entire world, that God\u2019s moving the heavens made\nhim indirectly the efficient cause of sublunar motion, and that he was\nalso the efficient cause of the heavens\u2019 motion, but not of\ntheir existence as a substance (in Cael. 271,13\u201321;\nin Phys. 1360,24\u20131363,24). Simplicius goes on to say\nthat Ammonius devoted an entire book to arguing that, contrary to\nthese Peripatetics, God was both final and efficient cause of both the\nmovement and existence of the whole world, sublunar and supralunar.\nThis interpretation, according to Simplicius, allowed Ammonius to\nharmonize Aristotle with Plato; it should not, therefore, be taken as\na concession to Christian doctrine. Instead of criticizing Aristotle,\nas Proclus had done, Ammonius took five Aristotelian passages and\ninterpreted them as indicating that Aristotle did in fact reason along\nthe lines Proclus had indicated in his criticism. Thus, for example,\nAmmonius argued, according to Simplicius, that in Physics\n2.3, 194b29\u201332, that from which comes the origin of motion\n(i.e., God, the unmoved mover) is itself a productive cause.\nAmmonius also argued that \u201cif, according to Aristotle, the power\nof any finite body is itself finite, clearly whether it be a power of\nmoving or a power that produces being, then, just as it gets its\neternal motion from the unmoved cause, so it must receive its\neternal being as a body from the non-bodily cause\u201d\n(trs. of this and other relevant texts in Sorabji 2005, vol. 2, sect.\n8(c)1). Ammonius\u2019 harmonization of Aristotle with Plato on this\npoint would prove essential to both Arabic Aristotelians and,\neventually, to Aquinas\u2019 ability to enlist Aristotle\u2019s God\nfor Christianity. Verrycken (1990, 218) interprets Ammonius\u2019\nconception of the relation of God and the world as based on the\nNeoplatonic \u2018procession\u2019 (God\u2019s production of the\nworld) and \u2018reversion\u2019 (its direction toward God as final\ncause), with God conceived as the divine Intellect. Verrycken (1990,\n222) argues further that Ammonius and his school also conceived of\nAristotle\u2019s God as consisting of two Neoplatonic hypostases, the\nGood and the Intellect, and that he/it could be viewed as either one,\ndepending on one\u2019s point of view: in metaphysics, as we see in\nAsclepius\u2019 commentary, Aristotle\u2019s God is mostly\nunderstood as the Good, \u201cthe first origin and final cause of all\nreality\u201d; in natural philosophy, as we see in Simplicius, God is\nprimarily the demiurgic Intellect, which is itself the final cause of\nthe world\u2019s movement.\n3.3 Aristotle and anti-determinism\n\nIn his commentary on On Interpretation chapter 9, Ammonius\nadded two other determinist arguments to the famous \u2018there will\nbe a sea-battle tomorrow\u2019 argument, making his commentary into a\nsmall treatise on determinism. The first of these was the\n\u2018Reaper\u2019 (131,20 ff.), an argument which Ammonius\nconsidered more \u2018verbal\u2019, which perhaps goes back to\nDiodorus Cronus and which greatly interested Zeno the Stoic: \u201cif\nyou will [that is, you are going to] reap, it is not the case that\nperhaps (takha) you will reap and perhaps you will not reap,\nbut you will reap, whatever happens (pant\u014ds); and if\nyou will not reap, in the same way it is not that perhaps you will\nreap and perhaps you will not reap, but, whatever happens, you will\nnot reap. But in fact, of necessity, either you will reap or you will\nnot reap.\u201d In consequence, Ammonius says, \u201cthe\n\u2018perhaps\u2019 is destroyed,\u201d and with it the contingent.\nAgainst this, Ammonius argues that if the determinist intends\n\u2018you will reap\u2019 to be contingent, he has already lost his\npoint, but if he intends it as necessary, he is taking for granted\nwhat he intends to prove; further, in that case, \u2018will reap,\nwhatever happens\u2019 will be true, but the determinist cannot say\n\u2018but in fact either you will reap or you will not reap\u2019,\nsince if one of these is necessary, the other is impossible. Sorabji\n(1998, 4\u20135) argues that \u2018perhaps\u2019 is ambiguous,\nmarking either a hesitant statement about the future or a statement\nabout present possibilities, and that the determinist argument plays\non this ambiguity, something which he thinks Ammonius did not see.\n\nThe second determinist argument, said by Ammonius to be \u2018more\nrelated to the nature of things\u2019, is from divine knowledge\n(132,8 ff.): \u201cthe gods either know in a definite manner the\noutcome of contingent things or they have absolutely no notion of them\nor they have an indefinite knowledge of them, just as we do.\u201d\nAmmonius shows that the gods must have definite knowledge of their\ncreations. Is the future definite, then, and not contingent, since the\ngods know future facts in a definite manner? Ammonius\u2019 reply to\nthis question is based on the idea (from Iamblichus, originally) that\nthe type of knowledge depends on the type of knower, not on the type\nof thing known. Therefore (136,1\u201317), due to their own nature,\nthe gods, and only they, can have definite\n(h\u014drismen\u0113) knowledge of future contingent facts,\nthough those facts are indefinite, in themselves, and not determined.\nIndeed, with the gods nothing is past or future (133,20), for they are\noutside of time.\n\nOnly after discussing these two additional arguments for the abolition\nof contingency does Ammonius consider the sea-battle argument from\nAristotle\u2019s discussion (De Int.18b17\u201325,\n19a30\u201332): if every affirmation must be true or false and if\nthere is a sea-battle today, it was always true to say that there\nwould be a sea-battle on this day and, hence, it was not possible for\nthis not to happen or not to be going to happen, so that it is\nnecessary for it to happen. Ultimately, all things which are going to\nhappen happen necessarily and none by chance. There has been, since\nthe Stoics, controversy over Aristotle\u2019s answers to this\nargument. What has been called the \u2018standard\ninterpretation\u2019 holds that Aristotle thought that, unlike such\nsentences about the past or present, sentences asserting future\nsingular contingent facts are neither true nor false, exempting them\nfrom the principle of bivalence and avoiding the alleged deterministic\nconsequence that contingency and chance are destroyed. There has\nlikewise been a substantial debate over whether Ammonius was an\nadherent of the \u2018standard interpretation\u2019 of\nAristotle\u2019s answer (cf. Sorabji 1998, Kretzmann 1998, Mignucci\n1998, Seel 2000ab).\n\nAmmonius, like Boethius, whose answer is somewhat more complicated,\nattacks the problem by means of his interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s opening remark in the chapter (18a28 ff.) that,\nwhile the rule that, of every contradictory pair of sentences, one is\ntrue and one false holds among sentences about what is or has\nhappened, as well as sentences about universals taken universally and\nfor singulars in the present or past tense, for universals not said\nuniversally it is not necessary, as he has explained in the preceding;\n\u201cbut in the case of future singulars it is not the same.\u201d\nAmmonius interprets \u201cit is not the same\u201d as indicating a\ndoctrine that sentences about future singular contingent events\n\u2018divide the true and false\u2019 (i.e., obey the principle of\nbivalence) but do so in an indefinite, \u2018not in a definite\nmanner\u2019 (ouk aph\u014drismen\u014ds): either there\nwill be a sea-battle tomorrow or there will not be one, and certainly\nthere will not both be one and not, but whichever of these two will\nturn out to be the case, the sentence correctly predicting that\noutcome is true (and the other false) only in an indefinite, not a\ndefinite way. Thus it is not \u201cpossible in a definite manner to\nsay which of them will be true and which will be false, since the\nthing has not already occurred but can both occur and not occur\u201d\n(130,23 ff.).\n\nThe idea of being true \u2018in a definite\u2019 or \u2018in an\nindefinite manner\u2019 does not occur in De Int. The\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s response to the sea-battle\nargument by this distinction probably goes back to Alexander of\nAphrodisias (cf. Alexander, Quaestiones 1.4 with Sharples\n1992, esp. 32\u20136). The distinction itself is probably taken over\nfrom the discussion of one of two contrary properties belonging to a\nsubject \u2018in a definite manner\u2019 in Cat. 10,\n12b38\u201340, which may have been suggested to the commentators by\nAristotle\u2019s remark at De Int. 19a33 that\n\u201csentences are true in the way things are.\u201d What precisely\nis meant by the distinction between being true in a definite or in an\nindefinite manner is obscure, controversial and much debated in the\nliterature: is it the distinction between necessary or causally\ndeterministic truth and mere truth, or that between being already true\nand going to be, while not yet being, true (cf. Nicostratus\u2019\ncharacterization of \u2018the Peripatetics\u2019 in Simplicius,\nin Cat. 406,13\u2013407,15)?\n\nAt the end of his discussion (154,3 ff., interpreting 19a23 ff.),\nAmmonius brings together necessary and definite truth, but not clearly\nenough to resolve all questions about the latter. He uses\nAristotle\u2019s idea that sentences can be necessarily true in two\nways, either absolutely, no matter whether they are said of\nperishable, existing or non-existent things, or for as long as the\npredicate holds of the subject. The whole of a disjunction of\ncontradictory assertions, such as \u2018either there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u2019\nor \u2018either Socrates is walking or Socrates is not\nwalking\u2019, is necessarily true in the absolute sense. Ammonius\nsays that this is still the case when, due to the nature of the thing\nin question, one of the disjuncts is true in a definite manner, as in\n\u2018either fire is hot or fire is not hot\u2019 (154,11). It\nappears, then, that Ammonius treats only the contradictory\ndisjunctions as necessarily true in the absolute sense, while their\ndisjoined parts may be necessarily true in the other sense, that is,\nonly as long as the predicate holds of the subject. In the case of\ncertain facts, such as fire being hot, this is always the case, and of\ntwo contradictory disjuncts the one which asserts this fact is always\ntrue in a definite manner. In the case of contingent facts, then, one\ndisjunct will only be true in a definite manner when the subject\nexists and the predicate is true of it. For Ammonius, when Aristotle\nrestricts the discussion to future contingent facts, this\nmakes it necessary that neither member of a contradiction said about\nthem be true in a definite manner, \u2018whatever happens\u2019,\nsince each, being contingent, must be susceptible of both truth and\nfalsity \u2018however it chances\u2019 or \u2018for the most\npart\u2019 or \u2018for the lesser part\u2019. Thus,\nAmmonius\u2019 explanation of Aristotle\u2019s reply to the\ndeterminist has an affinity with his answers to the\ndeterminist\u2019s claims about the \u2018Reaper\u2019 (there, the\ndeterminist is said to have illegitimately assumed that \u2018you\nwill reap\u2019 is necessary, not contingent; here, to have ignored\nAristotle\u2019s assumption that the disjuncts are contingent) and\nabout divine foreknowledge (there, the gods are said to know things\ndefinitely, because these things are not future for the gods, although\nthey are both future and indefinite for us; here, the future disjuncts\nare each contingent and, thus, not definitely true, it being open for\neach to be true or false in the event). Ammonius\u2019 approach may\nnot be very satisfying to us, in that it does not answer the question\nof what kind of truth-value Aristotle or Ammonius assigned to future\ncontingent propositions, but it keeps to the project of De\nInt., exploring the application of and the exceptions to the rule\nthat every contradictory pair of sentences has one member true and one\nmember false (cf. Whitaker 1996). Boethius (in De Int. II\n106,30\u2013107,16, 208,1\u201318) also uses the distinction between\nbeing true in a definite and in an indefinite manner, but there is\ndebate among scholars as to whether he understands this distinction\nand its role in Aristotle\u2019s argument in just the same way as\nAmmonius (cf. Sorabji 1998, Kretzmann 1998, Mignucci 1998). \n4. Influence\n\nAmmonius was chiefly influential as the founder of the school of\nAristotle-interpretation in Alexandria. Nearly all the principal\ncommentators who came after him were his pupils or his pupils\u2019\npupils. He gave a model for the method of exegesis of Aristotle and\nPlato and his lecturing style made an impression on students. His\ncommentary on De Interpretatione was particularly important\nand served as a source for Stephanus and other commentators. In its\ntranslation by William of Moerbeke, this work was influential on\nAquinas and thus on medieval and later Aristotelian philosopy and\nsemantics (cf., e.g., Fortier 2012). Ammonius\u2019 new set of\nintroductions to philosophy and the study of Aristotle, once adopted\nand adapted by his Alexandrian students\u2014Olympiodorus, Elias,\nDavid, Pseudo-Elias, and Philoponus, were also transferred to other\nlanguages and cultures. Importantly, a number of his and his\nstudents\u2019 works were studied and translated into Persian, Arabic\nand Syriac, where Ammonius\u2019 influence was carried forward (cf.\nthe brief overview of the diffusion of Ammonius\u2019 new curriculum\nand its introductions in Sorabji 2016c, 49\u201353, also with further\nliterature on the translations of works from Ammonius\u2019 school).\nAs an example of this diffusion, take the larger commentary on the\nCategories by Sergius of Reshaina (d. 536), who studied with\nAmmonius at Alexandria and later became a physician in his home city\n(see Hugonnard-Roche 2004 and Watt 2010, both with further\nliterature).",
