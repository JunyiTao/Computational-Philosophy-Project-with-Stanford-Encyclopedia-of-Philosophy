    "main_text": "Varieties of Non-Evidentialism || Fideistic non-evidentialism\n6.3 Fideistic non-evidentialism\n\nA third Non-Evidentialist position in the ethics of belief, similar to\nbut distinct from dogmatism, is sometimes called fideism,\nthough it needn't have anything to do with religious doctrine in\nparticular. According to the fideist, we can legitimately hold\npropositions on faith without having any evidence for them,\nwithout feeling impelled towards them, and even in the face of strong\nevidence against them (note that this is just one way of defining\n\u201cfideism,\u201d see the entry on\n fideism\n for others). Someone might hold on the basis of faith, for instance,\nthat there has been at least one bodily resurrection at some point in\nthe past, even though he has never witnessed such a thing first-hand,\nand his best scientific, testimonial, and everyday inductive evidence\nconstitutes a powerful case against it.\n\nFideism of this radical sort is not itself required by most religions,\nbut is typically associated with religious thinkers like Tertullian in\nthe ancient period (perhaps unfairly: see Sider 1980), and Kierkegaard\n(1846) in the modern (also perhaps unfairly: see Evans 1998). Apart\nfrom wearing its irrationality on its sleeve, fideism is vulnerable to\npsychological objections about the lack of direct control over belief.\nIf belief just is an attitude that necessarily responds to\nperceived evidence with a positive \u2018direction of fit,\u2019 it\nis hard to see how a well-functioning subject could believe that\np in the face of strong evidence that not-p.\nConsider someone who has normal sensory faculties and who, despite\nstrong perceptual and testimonial evidence to the contrary, repeatedly\ndeclares\u2014without claiming to have any hidden evidence\u2014that\nthere is, say, a huge abyss opening up in front of him. It would take\na very long time for us to become convinced that he really\nbelieves that there is an abyss in front of him. But if, in the end,\nwe are convinced by his actions and speech that he has this belief,\nand we know that his sensory faculties are functioning properly, then\nwe will probably think the belief is the product of an undesirable and\npartly involuntary state such as self-deception, wish-fulfillment, or\nparanoia. We won't think that he has simply chosen to believe.\n\nA more moderate sort of fideism would say that we are permitted to\nform a \u201cfaith\u201d-based belief only if the evidence regarding\nthe proposition in question is not compelling either way, or is absent\naltogether. Only under those circumstances can we (directly or\nindirectly) make a \u201cleap of faith\u201d into belief (Adams\n1987). Typically, however, those who have recommended \u201cleaps of\nfaith\u201d have cited pragmatic or moral grounds for those leaps,\nand so given the taxonomy we have so far, they would ultimately count\nas practical non-Evidentialists rather than bona fide fideists.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the claim is that in the complete absence of\npractical or theoretical reasons in favor, a subject is still\npermitted to adopt a certain belief, then the view seems to have\nabandoned aspirations to developing a principled position, and is no\nlonger obviously an \u201cethics\u201d of belief. This is not a\nknockdown argument against that kind of fideism, of course: it may be\nthat such a fideist can give reasons to think that trying to formulate\nan ethics of belief is an ill-conceived project in the first\nplace.\n\nA final alternative for the fideist is to admit that he is not really\nfocused on belief at all, but is rather trying to make room for\nanother kind of positive propositional attitude that is not guided by\nevidence. Many philosophers and religious people who embrace the\nfideist label construe \u201cfaith\u201d (Latin: fides) as\nsomething different from belief\u2014hope, perhaps, or something like\n\u201cacceptance\u201d (see \u00a77 and the entry on\n fideism).\n On such a conception, faith that p might very well be able\nrationally to co-exist in the same psychology with a lot of evidence\nfor not-p.\n7. The ethics of acceptance\n\nThis last point shows that Evidentialism about belief\u2014even of a\nstrict and uncompromising sort\u2014can be combined with\nNon-Evidentialism about some other positive, categorical propositional\nattitudes in order to make it seem less stern (see Audi 2008a for a\nlist of possible meanings of \u201cfaith\u201d). Perhaps the most\nprominent candidate here is acceptance conceived as a\npositive categorical attitude towards a proposition that is by\ndefinition voluntary and figures significantly in our deliberation,\naction, argumentation, and assertion. Some philosophers focus on the\nrole that acceptance plays in scientific inquiry, theory-construction,\nand decision theory (van Fraasen 1984, Stalnaker 1987, Cohen 1992).\nOthers focus on the role that it plays in ethical, juridical,\nreligious, and everyday contexts (Bratman 1992, Cohen 1992, Alston\n1996, Audi 2008a). A warning is in order here: acceptance is typically\na technical notion and characterizations of its nature and ethics\ndiffer radically in the literature. There is also some dispute about\nwhether acceptance is able to play the various roles that its\nadvocates intend (Radford 1990, Maher 1990, Moore 1994).\n\nThe ethicist of belief who wants to soften or supplement her view by\nappealing to some notion of permissible acceptance would need to say\nwhat acceptance is, how the two sorts of attitude differ, what sorts\nof norms govern each, and how they interact in a single subject. One\nof the main advantages of a hybrid view like this is that acceptance\nis usually taken to be by definition voluntary, and thus it\nis much easier to see how a genuine \u201cethics\u201d (complete\nwith praise and blame ascriptions) could be built around it. As we saw\nearlier, a notion of acceptance (as \u201cfaith\u201d) is the sort\nof thing that a fideist might want to appeal to against those who say\nthat one can't just decide to believe that p in the face of\nstrong opposing evidence. A moderate fideist, by contrast, might argue\nthat we are only permitted to accept that p if we lack\nstrong evidence about p either way. This is still\nconsistent with our having weak evidence for not-p,\nand even a (weakly held) belief that not-p.",
