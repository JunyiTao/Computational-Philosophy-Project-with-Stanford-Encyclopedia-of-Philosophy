    "main_text": "\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s two incompleteness theorems are among the most\nimportant results in modern logic, and have deep implications for\nvarious issues. They concern the limits of provability in formal\naxiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in\nany consistent formal system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\narithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of\n\\(F\\) which can neither be proved nor disproved in \\(F\\).\nAccording to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal system\ncannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it is\nindeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on the\nphilosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to apply\nthe results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophy\nof mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. The\npresent entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and various\nissues surrounding them. (See also the entry on\n Kurt G\u00f6del\n for a discussion of the incompleteness theorems that contextualizes\nthem within a broader discussion of his mathematical and philosophical\nwork.)\n",
