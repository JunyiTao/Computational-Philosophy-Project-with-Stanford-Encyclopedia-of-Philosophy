History of the Rule of Law\n\nThe Rule of Law has been an important ideal in our political tradition\nfor millennia, and it is impossible to grasp and evaluate modern\nunderstandings of it without fathoming that historical heritage. The\nheritage of argument about the Rule of Law begins with Aristotle (c.\n350 BC); it proceeds with medieval theorists like Sir John Fortescue\n(1471), who sought to distinguish lawful from despotic forms of\nkingship; it goes on through the early modern period in the work of\nJohn Locke (1689), James Harrington (1656), and (oddly enough)\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1517); in the European Enlightenment in\nthe writings of Montesquieu (1748) and others; in American\nconstitutionalism in The Federalist Papers and (and even more\nforcefully) in the writings of the Federalists\u2019 opponents; and,\nin the modern era, in Britain in the writings of A. V. Dicey (1885),\nF.A. Hayek (1944, 1960, and 1973), Michael Oakeshott (1983), Joseph\nRaz (1977), and John Finnis (1980), and in America in the writings of\nLon Fuller (1964), Ronald Dworkin (1985), and John Rawls (1971).\nBecause the heritage of this idea is so much a part of its modern\napplication, a few highlights need to be mentioned. \n",
