    "main_text": "The Emergence of Kokugaku || Keich\u016b (1640\u20131701)\n2.1 Keich\u016b (1640\u20131701)\n\nBecause the preeminent Motoori Norinaga located a genesis for his own\nstudies in the scholarship of Keich\u016b, most students of Kokugaku\ntoday accept Keich\u016b as at least its forerunner. Keich\u016b had a\nsolidly samurai pedigree, though his father and grandfather fared\npoorly after 1600 under the new Tokugawa regime. He had a rigorous\nearly education supervised by his mother, and at the age of 12 to\nfulfill a parental vow began the ten-year path to ordination in the\nShingon Buddhist priesthood, becoming a high priest (Ajari)\nin 1663. \n\nKeich\u016b developed an interest in traditional waka,\n(31-syllable) Japanese verse, including the verses in Japan\u2019s\nmost ancient extant poetry anthology, the eighth-century\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b. One feature of seventeenth-century\nJapanese poetics was an awakening interest in the anthology, but only\nabout 10% of its 4400 poems were accessible to Keich\u016b\u2019s\ncontemporaries owing to the arcane method of its original\ntranscription. To remedy this lacuna the Daimyo of Mito commissioned a\ncommentary, the responsibility for which, in a roundabout fashion,\ndevolved upon Keich\u016b. It was for that philological work that he\nremains best known.\n\nIn terms of the Kokugaku tradition, three factors stand out in terms\nof why later Kokugakusha (native studies scholars) came to\nsee him as a pioneer of their own work. First was Keich\u016b\u2019s\nnear-mystical reverence for waka. By tradition waka\nwere thought to be an invention of the kami rendering them\nultimately beyond human ken, and Keich\u016b felt this numinous\nquality intensely. Second was the relative sophistication of\nKeich\u016b\u2019s philology, which balanced historical linguistic\nanalysis with an intuitive sense of the meaning behind the text. Later\nscholars attributed this to Keich\u016b\u2019s earlier study of\nSanskrit as part of his study for the Shingon Buddhist priesthood. And\nthird was his representation of the ancient pre-Buddhist and\npre-Confucian past as the \u201cland of the kami\u201d\n(shinkoku) characterized by a simple self-sufficiency rooted\nin the native Way.\n\nAs Keich\u016b wrote in his commentary on the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b:\n\n\nJapan is the land of the kami. Therefore in both our\nhistories and our government administration, we have always given\npriority to the kami and always placed humans second. In high\nantiquity, our rulers governed this land exclusively by means of\nShinto\u2026, and there was no philosophizing of the sort one finds\nin Confucian classics and Buddhist writings. (c. 1690,\nMan\u2019y\u014d daish\u014dki: zassetsu, adapted from SJTa:\n395) \n\n\nAdditionally in his later retirement from active priesthood\nKeich\u016b produced a number of studies of Japan\u2019s other major\npoetry anthologies, treatises on ancient Japanese language, and\nstudies of the emergent canon of literary and historical prose works,\nall of which resonated with the topics taught in later Kokugaku\nacademies.\n",
