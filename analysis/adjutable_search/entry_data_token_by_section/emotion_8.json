    "main_text": "The Hybrid Evaluative-Feeling Tradition in Recent Philosophy || Emotions as Evaluative Feelings\n7.2 Emotions as Evaluative Feelings \n\nSeveral authors have proposed theories that endow feelings with\nintentionality. A notable example is that of Goldie (2000), who\nidentifies the intentionality of emotions with that of feelings\ntowards, which are not just bodily feelings that borrow their\nintentionality from somewhere else, as in Prinz\u2019s account, but\nare instead supposed to have their own, intrinsic intentionality (see\nalso D\u00f6ring 2007; Pugmire 1998). For example, when I feel fear\nabout slipping on ice, my feeling is towards the ice as being\ndangerous. This sort of feeling is a matter of thinking of the ice\nwith feeling, and cannot be reduced to a combination of a\nnon-intentional bodily feeling and a non-emotional evaluative thought.\nAs Goldie puts it, \n\n\nemotional feelings are inextricably intertwined with the\nworld-directed aspect of emotion, so that an adequate account of an\nemotion\u2019s intentionality\u2026will at the same time capture an\nimportant aspect of its phenomenology. (Goldie 2002: 242; see also\nRatcliffe 2005, 2017) \n\n\nIn a similar vein, Helm (2009: 8) proposes that \u201cemotions are\nintentional feelings of import\u201d which are either pleasurable or\nunpleasant. On Helm\u2019s view, \n\n\n[f]or something to have import to you\u2014for you to care\nabout it\u2014is (roughly) for it to be worthy of attention and\naction. (Helm 2009: 252) \n\n\nThis explains why emotions motivate action: feeling that something is\nworthy of attention and action is being motivated. It also explains\nwhat makes a recalcitrant emotion irrational. By judging a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as not dangerous and yet fearing it,\nthe subject is judging that what he or she feels is worthy of\nattention and action actually isn\u2019t, thereby undertaking\nevaluative commitments at odds with one another (Helm 2015:\n430\u2013431).\n\nSome of the views that ascribe intentionality to feelings are inspired\nby the broader research program of representationalism in the\nphilosophy of mind, which is the view that phenomenal properties are\nidentifiable with, or at least reducible to, intentional properties\n(Dretske 1995; Horgan & Tienson 2002). In some variants of\nrepresentationalism, the emotional phenomenology that gets to be\nreduced is merely somatic, in the sense that the feeling is directed\nat bodily events (e.g., Tye 1995). In other variants, the\nphenomenology is much richer, as it comprises somatic, cognitive,\nconative and irreducibly affective components directed at\nparticular and formal objects in the world (e.g., Kriegel 2012).\n\nAn alternative embraced by some contemporary feeling theorists is to\nargue that emotions are feelings devoid of any intentional objects.\nThe contrary impression is an illusion, deriving from the fact that\nthe feelings we call emotions are typically caused by thoughts with an\nintentional structure with which they are associated in a\n\u201ccomposite\u201d experience (Whiting 2011; Goldstein 2002). On\nthis view, fear of the ice is a composite mental state consisting of\nan emotion\u2014the objectless feeling of fear\u2014plus a thought\nwith the ice as its intentional object. In themselves, emotions are\nmerely hedonic feelings without intentionality. The grounds claimed\nfor this view are explicitly phenomenological, however, and since most\nresearchers\u2019 introspection appears to deliver the contrary\nverdict that emotions are themselves object-directed, the composite\nview fails to persuade (for a different argument for objectlessness\nbased on social psychology data, see Shargel 2015).\n",
