    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of pure mathematics deals with two major groups of\nquestions. One pertains to the ontology of mathematical entities and\nthe other to the epistemology of mathematical concepts and judgments\n(Avigad 2007). The nature and existence of mathematical objects (e.g.,\nnumbers and geometrical shapes), the existence and qualifications of\ninfinities (e.g., infinite magnitudes and infinite collections of\nnumbers or numbered things), and the existence and qualifications of\ncontinua are some of the most significant ontological issues with\nwhich philosophers of mathematics are concerned. On the other hand,\nsome of the most important and challenging epistemological issues\nabout mathematics are the following: the mechanisms through which we\ngrasp mathematical knowledge, the epistemic status of mathematical\naxioms and principles, the nature of mathematical proofs (that are\nwritable on paper) and their connection to what goes on in the mind of\nmathematicians, and the role of mathematical knowledge in attaining a\nbetter understanding of the physical world.\n\nIt is very well known that the medieval Islamic civilization played a\npivotal role in the historical development of technical aspects of\nmathematics. Standing on the shoulders of their pre-Islamic Greek,\nIndian, and Persian ancestors, Muslim mathematicians have made\nnumerous innovations in various branches of mathematics and have\nwritten a great number of books and essays introducing mathematical\nnotions and proving mathematical theorems (Al-Daffa\u02be 1977; R.\nRashed 1984b [1994]; 1996 [2012]; 2015; Berggren 2016). However, it is\nvery difficult (if not impossible) to find a book from the medieval\nIslamic era that is exclusively devoted to a comprehensive and\nsystematic study of philosophy of mathematics. Nevertheless, many of\nthe aforementioned philosophical issues about mathematics have been\naddressed, by great Muslim medieval thinkers, in various works whose\ncentral subject was mathematics, physics, metaphysics, or even\ntheology (kal\u0101m). Putting these scattered engagements\ntogether, it becomes clear that although philosophy of mathematics has\nnever been treated as an independent discipline in the medieval\nIslamic world, Muslim thinkers came up with very interesting and\nprofound ideas, insights, and arguments about at least some\nphilosophical issues related to mathematics. This entry briefly\nreviews the most remarkable examples of such insights and arguments,\nsome of which have been the subject of long-standing debates and\ndiscussions among Muslim thinkers. Accordingly, the technical\nmathematical works of Arab and Muslim scholars will be discussed only\nto the extent that they contain materials related to the\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n",
