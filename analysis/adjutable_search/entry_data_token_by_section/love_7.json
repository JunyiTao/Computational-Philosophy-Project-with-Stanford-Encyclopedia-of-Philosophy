    "main_text": "Emotion Views\n5. Emotion Views\n\nGiven these problems with the accounts of love as valuing, perhaps we\nshould turn to the emotions. For emotions just are responses to\nobjects that combine evaluation, motivation, and a kind of\nphenomenology, all central features of the attitude of love.\n\nMany accounts of love claim that it is an emotion; these include:\nWollheim 1984, Rorty 1986/1993, Brown 1987, Hamlyn 1989, Baier 1991,\nand Badhwar\n 2003.[11]\n Thus, Hamlyn (1989, p. 219) says:\n\nIt would not be a plausible move to defend any theory of the emotions\nto which love and hate seemed exceptions by saying that love and hate\nare after all not emotions. I have heard this said, but it does seem\nto me a desperate move to make. If love and hate are not emotions what\nis?\n\n\nThe difficulty with this claim, as Rorty (1980) argues, is that the\nword, \u2018emotion,\u2019 does not seem to pick out a homogeneous\ncollection of mental states, and so various theories claiming that\nlove is an emotion mean very different things. Consequently, what are\nhere labeled \u201cemotion views\u201d are divided into those that\nunderstand love to be a particular kind of evaluative-cum-motivational\nresponse to an object, whether that response is merely occurrent or\ndispositional (\u2018emotions proper,\u2019 see\n Section 5.1,\n below), and those that understand love to involve a collection of\nrelated and interconnected emotions proper (\u2018emotion\ncomplexes,\u2019 see\n Section 5.2,\n below).\n",
