The Systematicity Debate\n\nThe major points of controversy in the philosophical literature on\nconnectionism have to do with whether connectionists provide a viable\nand novel paradigm for understanding the mind. One complaint is that\nconnectionist models are only good at processing associations. But\nsuch tasks as language and reasoning cannot be accomplished by\nassociative methods alone and so connectionists are unlikely to match\nthe performance of classical models at explaining these higher-level\ncognitive abilities. However, it is a simple matter to prove that\nneural networks can do anything that symbolic processors can do, since\nnets can be constructed that mimic a computer\u2019s circuits. So the\nobjection can not be that connectionist models are unable to account\nfor higher cognition; it is rather that they can do so only if they\nimplement the classicist\u2019s symbolic processing tools.\nImplementational connectionism may succeed, but radical connectionists\nwill never be able to account for the mind.\n\nFodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s often cited paper (1988) launches a debate\nof this kind. They identify a feature of human intelligence called\nsystematicity which they feel connectionists cannot explain. The\nsystematicity of language refers to the fact that the ability to\nproduce/understand/think some sentences is intrinsically connected to\nthe ability to produce/understand/think others of related structure.\nFor example, no one with a command of English who understands\n\u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d can fail to understand \u201cMary loves\nJohn.\u201d From the classical point of view, the connection between\nthese two abilities can easily be explained by assuming that masters\nof English represent the constituents (\u201cJohn\u201d,\n\u201cloves\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d) of \u201cJohn loves\nMary\u201d and compute its meaning from the meanings of these\nconstituents. If this is so, then understanding a novel sentence like\n\u201cMary loves John\u201d can be accounted for as another instance\nof the same symbolic process. In a similar way, symbolic processing\nwould account for the systematicity of reasoning, learning and\nthought. It would explain why there are no people who are capable of\nconcluding P from P & (Q &\nR), but incapable of concluding P from P\n& Q, why there are no people capable of learning to\nprefer a red cube to green square who cannot learn to prefer a green\ncube to the red square, and why there isn\u2019t anyone who can think\nthat John loves Mary who can\u2019t also think that Mary loves\nJohn.\n\nFodor and McLaughlin (1990) argue in detail that connectionists do not\naccount for systematicity. Although connectionist models can be\ntrained to be systematic, they can also be trained, for example, to\nrecognize \u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d without being able to\nrecognize \u201cMary loves John.\u201d Since connectionism does not\nguarantee systematicity, it does not explain why systematicity is\nfound so pervasively in human cognition. Systematicity may exist in\nconnectionist architectures, but where it exists, it is no more than a\nlucky accident. The classical solution is much better, because in\nclassical models, pervasive systematicity comes for free.\n\nThe charge that connectionist nets are disadvantaged in explaining\nsystematicity has generated a lot of interest. Chalmers (1993) points\nout that Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s argument proves too much, for it\nentails that all neural nets, even those that implement a classical\narchitecture, do not exhibit systematicity. Given the uncontroversial\nconclusion that the brain is a neural net, it would follow that\nsystematicity is impossible in human thought. Another often mentioned\npoint of rebuttal (Aizawa 1997b; Matthews 1997; Hadley 1997b) is that\nclassical architectures do no better at explaining systematicity.\nThere are also classical models that can be programmed to recognize\n\u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d without being able to recognize\n\u201cMary loves John,\u201d for this depends on exactly which\nsymbolic rules govern the classical processing. The point is that\nneither the use of connectionist architecture alone nor the use of\nclassical architecture alone enforces a strong enough constraint to\nexplain pervasive systematicity. In both architectures, further\nassumptions about the nature of the processing must be made to ensure\nthat \u201cMary loves John\u201d and \u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d\nare treated alike.\n\nA discussion of this point should mention Fodor and McLaughlin\u2019s\nrequirement that systematicity be explained as a matter of nomic\nnecessity, that is, as a matter of natural law. The complaint against\nconnectionists is that while they may implement systems that exhibit\nsystematicity, they will not have explained it unless it follows from\ntheir models as a nomic necessity. However, the demand for nomic\nnecessity is a very strong one, and one that classical architectures\nclearly cannot meet either. So the only tactic for securing a telling\nobjection to connectionists along these lines would be to weaken the\nrequirement on the explanation of systematicity to one which classical\narchitectures can and connectionists cannot meet. A convincing case of\nthis kind has yet to be made.\n\nAs the systematicity debate has evolved, attention has been focused on\ndefining the benchmarks that would answer Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s\nchallenge. Hadley (1994a, 1994b) distinguishes three brands of\nsystematicity. Connectionists have clearly demonstrated the weakest of\nthese by showing that neural nets can learn to correctly recognize\nnovel sequences of words (e.g., \u201cMary loves John\u201d) that\nwere not in the training set. However, Hadley claims that a convincing\nrebuttal must demonstrate strong systematicity, or better, strong\nsemantical systematicity. Strong systematicity would require (at\nleast) that \u201cMary loves John\u201d be recognized even if\n\u201cMary\u201d never appears in the subject position in any\nsentence in the training set. Strong semantical systematicity would\nrequire as well that the net show abilities at correct semantical\nprocessing of the novel sentences rather than merely distinguishing\ngrammatical from ungrammatical forms. Niklasson and van Gelder (1994)\nhave claimed success at strong systematicity, though Hadley complains\nthat this is at best a borderline case. Hadley and Hayward (1997)\ntackle strong semantical systematicity, but by Hadley\u2019s own\nadmission it is not clear that they have avoided the use of a\nclassical architecture. Boden and Niklasson (2000) claim to have\nconstructed a model that meets at least the spirit of strong\nsemantical systematicity, but Hadley (2004) argues that even strong\nsystematicity has not been demonstrated there. Whether one takes a\npositive or a negative view of these attempts, it is safe to say that\nno one has met the challenge of providing a neural net capable of\nlearning complex semantical processing that generalizes to a full\nrange of truly novel inputs.\n\nResearch on nets that clearly demonstrate strong systematicity has\ncontinued. Jansen and Watter (2012) provide a good summary of more\nrecent efforts along these lines, and propose an interesting basis for\nsolving the problem. They use a more complex architecture that\ncombines unsupervised self-organizing maps with features of simple\nrecurrent nets. However, the main innovation is to allow codes for the\nwords being processed to represent sensory-motor features of what the\nwords represent. Once trained, their nets displayed very good accuracy\nin distinguishing the grammatical features of sentences whose words\nnever even appeared in the training set. This may appear to be\ncheating since the word codes might surreptitiously represent\ngrammatical categories, or at least they may unfairly facilitate\nlearning those categories. Jansen and Watter note however, that the\nsensory-motor features of what a word represents are apparent to a\nchild who has just acquired a new word, and so that information is not\noff-limits in a model of language learning. They make the interesting\nobservation that a solution to the systematicity problem may require\nincluding sources of environmental information that have so far been\nignored in theories of language learning. This work complicates the\nsystematicity debate, since it opens a new worry about what\ninformation resources are legitimate in responding to the challenge.\nHowever, this reminds us that architecture alone (whether classical or\nconnectionist) is not going to solve the systematicity problem in any\ncase, so the interesting questions concern what sources of\nsupplemental information are needed to make the learning of grammar\npossible.\n\nKent Johnson (2004) argues that the whole systematicity debate is\nmisguided. Attempts at carefully defining the systematicity of\nlanguage or thought leaves us with either trivialities or falsehoods.\nConnectionists surely have explaining to do, but Johnson recommends\nthat it is fruitless to view their burden under the rubric of\nsystematicity. Aizawa (2014) also suggests the debate is no longer\ngermane given the present climate in cognitive science. What is needed\ninstead is the development of neurally plausible connectionist models\ncapable of processing a language with a recursive syntax, which react\nimmediately to the introduction of new items in the lexicon without\nintroducing the features of classical architecture. The\n\u201csystematicity\u201d debate may have already gone as Johnson\nadvises, for Hadley\u2019s demand for strong semantical systematicity\nmay be thought of as the requirement that connectionists exhibit\nsuccess in that direction.\n\nRecent work (Loula, Baroni, & Lake 2018) sheds new light on the\ncontroversy. Here recurrent neural nets were trained to interpret\ncomplex commands in a simple language that includes primitives such as\n\u201cjump\u201d, \u201cwalk\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d,\n\u201cright\u201d, \u201copposite\u201d and \u201caround\u201d.\n\u201cOpposite\u201d is interpreted as a request to perform a\ncommand twice, and \u201caround\u201d to do so four times. So\n\u201cjump around left\u201d requests a left jump four times. The\nauthors report that their nets showed very accurate generalization at\ntasks that qualify for demonstrating strong semantic systematicity.\nThe nets correctly parsed commands in the test set containing\n\u201cjump around right\u201d even though this phrase never appeared\nin the training set. Nevertheless the net\u2019s failures at more\nchallenging tasks point to limitations in their abilities to\ngeneralize in ways that would demonstrate genuine systematicity. The\nnets exhibited very poor performance when commands in the test set\nwere longer (or even shorter), than those presented in the training\nset. So they appeared unable to spontaneously compose the meaning of\ncomplex expressions from the meanings of their parts. New research is\nneeded to understand the nature of these failures, whether they can be\novercome in non-classical architectures, and the extent to which\nhumans would exhibit similar mistakes under analogous\ncircumstances.\n\nIt has been almost thirty years since the systematicity debate first\nbegan, with over 3,000 citations to Fodor and Pylyshyn\u2019s\noriginal paper. So this brief account is necessarily incomplete.\nAizawa (2003) provides an\nexcellent view of the literature, and Calvo and Symons (2014) serves\nas another more recent resource. \n",
