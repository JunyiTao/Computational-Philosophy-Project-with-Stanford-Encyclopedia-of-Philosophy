    "main_text": "Five Problems\n2. Five Problems\nIn contemporary philosophy of mathematics, nominalism has been\nformulated in response to difficulties faced by platonism. But in\ndeveloping their responses to platonism, nominalists also encounter\ndifficulties of their own. Five problems need to be addressed in this\ncontext:\n\nThe epistemological problem of mathematics,\nThe problem of the application of mathematics,\nThe problem of uniform semantics,\nThe problem of taking mathematical discourse literally, and\nThe ontological problem.\n\nUsually, problems (1) and (5) are considered as raising\ndifficulties for platonism, whereas problems (2), (3), and (4) are\noften taken as yielding difficulties for nominalism. (I will discuss\nbelow to what extent such an assessment is accurate.) Each of these\nproblems will be examined in turn.\n",
