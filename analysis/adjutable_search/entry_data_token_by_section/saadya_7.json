    "main_text": "Revelation as Praxis\n8. Revelation as Praxis\n\n In considering the possibility of revelation as ground, consider the\nsense in which, for Saadya, revelation entails praxis. In addition to\ndescribing knowledge as that which God has placed within him, Saadya,\nin the above \u2018salvific diver\u2019 quote, sees that in having\nreceived the divine gift of knowledge, he has become a locus of\nobligation: in having divinely received reason's fruit, he has, at one\nand the same time, been called to take on the God-given responsibility\nto help save those who are drowning. Acting on his responsibility to\nsnatch the lost drifters from the watery graves of doubt and error,\nSaadya hopes that\n\n [t]he knowledge of God and\nHis law will spread in the world like the spreading of water in all\nparts of the sea, as is said, \u2018For the earth shall be full of the\nknowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea\u2019\n(Isa. 11.9)\u201d (Altmann, 31)\n \n\n\n As is already evident in these sentiments at the very start of the\nAm\u00e2n\u00e2t, and as becomes clearer throughout the\ncourse of the text, for Saadya there is always an immediate\ncorrelation between the ability to think (or reason) on the one hand,\nand, on the other hand, both (a) a receptivity to divine giving,\ncoupled with (b) an obligation of moral responsiveness in the face of\nthe Other. In this (as in other ideas of his), we find an intimate and\ninextricable link between the human capacity to manifest reason, the\nhuman capacity to receive revelation, and the human responsibility to\nbe ethically responsive. In this sense, \u2018receiving\nrevelation\u2019 must itself be understood as a person's \u2014 or\ncommunity's \u2014 joint resolution to hearing and\nacting-in-accordance-with the voice of God, itself manifest in\nhearing and acting-in-accordance-with the voice of\ntradition. tradition in this sense emerges in Saadya as a communal\nreceptacle for revelation, parallel, though on a larger scale, to the\nreceptive heart of the individual prophet who receives the word of\nGod. Along these lines, we might say that\nrevelation-cum-tradition emerges as the key ingredient to\nSaadya's epistemological prescription for truth and certainty, and as\nsuch, as the key ingredient to Saadya's prescription for living\n\u2014 his prescription, that is, for how to live life with the sort\nof fullness that only truth and certainty can provide, and which only\nfaith-with-reason can hope to attain.\n",
