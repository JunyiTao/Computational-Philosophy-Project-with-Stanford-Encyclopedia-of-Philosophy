    "main_text": "\n\nInformation and communication technology (simply referred to as\n\u2018information technology\u2019 here) is changing many aspects of\nhuman endeavour and existence. This is beyond dispute for most. What\nare contested are the social and ethical implications of these\nchanges. Possible sources of these disputes are the multiple ways in\nwhich one can conceptualize and interpret the information\ntechnology/society interrelationship. Each of these ways of\nconceptualization and interpretation enables one to see the\ninformation technology/society relationship differently and therefore\nconstrue its social and ethical implications in a different manner. At\nthe center of this technology/society interrelationship we find many\ncomplex questions about the nature of the human, the technical,\nagency, autonomy, freedom and much more. This is indeed a vast\nintellectual landscape, which can obviously not be explored here in\nits fullness. This entry is about just one particular perspective on\nthis landscape. It is primarily concerned with the phenomenological\napproach to interpreting information technology and its social and\nethical implications. It should be noted from the start that there is\nnot a unified phenomenological tradition or approach to information\ntechnology in particular, or other phenomena more generally. The\nphenomenological tradition consists of many different approaches that\nshare certain characteristics (certain family resemblances, one might\nsay) but not all. We may however suggest, with Don Ihde (2003,133),\nthat they all accept that \u201cphenomenology investigates the\nconditions of what makes things appear as such [as that which we take\nthem to be].\u201d Differently stated, phenomenology suggests that\nthere is a co-constitutive relationship between us and the phenomena\nwe encounter in our engagement with the world. In this sense\nphenomenologists would suggest that to understand the\ntechnology/society relationship we need to reveal how they\nco-constitute each other\u2014i.e. draw on each other for their\nongoing meaning and sense. We will elaborate more precisely what this\nmeans in\n section 2\n below. However, in order to understand the distinctiveness of the\nphenomenological approach other possible ways of interpreting this\ntechnology/society relationship will also be outlined briefly\nbelow.\n\nIt can be said that information technology has become in a very real\nsense ubiquitous. Most everyday technologies such as elevators,\nautomobiles, microwaves, watches, and so forth depend on\nmicroprocessors for their ongoing operation. Most organizations and\ninstitutions have become reliant on their information technology\ninfrastructure to a lesser or greater degree. Indeed information\ntechnology is seen by many as a cost-efficient way to solve a\nmultitude of problems facing our complex contemporary society. One can\nalmost say that information technology has become construed as the\ndefault technology for solving a whole raft of technical and social\nproblems such as health provision, security, governance, etc. One\ncould also argue that it has become synonymous with society\u2019s\nview of modernization and progress. For most it seems obvious that\ninformation technology has made it possible for humans to continue to\nconstruct increasingly complex systems of coordination and social\nordering\u2014systems without which contemporary society would not be\nable to exist in its present form. To say the least, we, as\ncontemporary human beings, have our manner of being made possible\nthrough a rather comprehensive entanglement with information and\ncommunication technology. Indeed, the economic, organizational and\nsocial benefit of information technology is not widely disputed. The\ndispute is more often about the way information technology is changing\nor transforming the social domain, and in particular, the ethical\ndomain. This dispute is largely centered around different ways of\nconceptualizing and interpreting the nature of our entanglement with\ninformation technology. This debate is not merely an academic debate\nabout different and competing theoretical \u2018models.\u2019\nRather, these different ways of conceptualizing it is central to our\nunderstanding of how we go about managing our increasingly entangled\nrelationship with information technology. \n",
