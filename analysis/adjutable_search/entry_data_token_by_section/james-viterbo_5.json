    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Distinction of Being and Essence\n3.2 The Distinction of Being and Essence\n\nThe question of how being and essence are related to each other, and\nin particular whether they are really identical or not, attracted\nconsiderable interest in the last quarter of the thirteenth century,\nwith all major masters devoting some discussion to it. James of\nViterbo is no exception. Drawing his inspiration from Anselm\u2019s\nsemantics, he attempts to articulate a compromise solution (Gossiaux\n2018) between the main competing solutions on offer in his day.\n\nJames\u2019 most detailed discussion of the distinction between being\nand essence occurs in the context of a question that asks whether\ncreation could be saved if being (esse) and essence were not\ndifferent (Quodl. I, q. 4). His answer is that although he\nfinds it difficult to see how one could account for creation if being\nand essence were not really different, he does not believe it is\nnecessary to conceive of the real distinction in the way in which\n\u201ccertain Doctors\u201d do. Which Doctors does he have in mind?\nIn Quodl. I, q. 4, he summarizes the views of three authors:\nGodfrey of Fontaines, according to whom the distinction is only\nconceptual (secundum rationem); Henry of Ghent, for whom\nesse is only intentionally different from essence, a\ndistinction that is less than a real distinction but greater than a\nverbal distinction; and finally, Giles of Rome, for whom esse\nis one thing (res), and essence another. Thus, James agrees\nwith Giles, and disagrees with Henry and Godfrey, that the distinction\nbetween being and essence is real; however, he disagrees with Giles\nabout the proper way of understanding the real distinction.\n\nThe starting point of his analysis is Anselm\u2019s statement in the\nMonologion that the substantive lux (light), the\ninfinitive lucere (to-emit-light), and the present participle\nlucens (emitting light) are related to each other in the same\nway as essentia (essence), esse (to be), and\nens (being). The relation of lucere to lux,\nJames tells us, is the relation of a concrete term to an abstract one;\nbut this is just the relation that obtains between being and essence.\nNow, a concrete term signifies more things than the corresponding\nabstract term; for an abstract term signifies only a form, whereas the\nconcrete term signifies the form and the \u201csubject\u201d, i.e.,\nthe bearer of the form; it is said to signify the former principally,\nand the latter secondarily. So it is in the case of being and essence:\nesse signifies the form (principally) and the subject\n(secondarily), while essence signifies the form only. What is taken\nfor granted in this analysis is that the distinction between a form\nand its bearer is a real one, at least in creatures. This is how James\nachieves his compromise solution: pace Godfrey of Fontaines\nand Henry of Ghent there is a real distinction (that between the\nsubject and the form) but pace Giles, it is real only in\nqualified sense, since being principally signifies the same thing as\nessence. \n",
