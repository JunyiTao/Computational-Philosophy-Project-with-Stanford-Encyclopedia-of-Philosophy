Were this not the case, a\nright to \u03c6 would be wholly negative, excluding reasons against\n\u03c6 but not counting in its favor. For instance, one\u2019s right\nto privacy in one\u2019s home is not only reason not to act on\ncertain (even if weighty) reasons favoring invading people\u2019s\nhomes, but also a reason not to do so. This dual reason-giving nature\nof rights is captured in Dworkin\u2019s \u201ctrumping\u201d\nmetaphor. \n\nAccordingly, even if a right to \u03c6 is not sufficiently stringent to\nexclude certain conflicting reasons, it remains a (non-exclusionary)\nreason to \u03c6, to be straightforwardly weighed along with other\nrelevant reasons that the right does not trump. Moreover, the outcomes\nof such weighing can involve compromises and partial consideration of\nthe different conflicting reasons (Aleinikoff 1987: 946).\n\nIt is here where jurists sometimes get rights wrong. That a right is\nalso a straightforward reason to be balanced against other reasons on\nthe basis of their respective weight does not entail rights are wholly\nnon-preemptory. Treating rights only as straightforward reasons\ndistorts the primary role that rights occupy within practical and\nlegal reasoning\u2014that is, rights\u2019 preemptory quality. \n",
