    "preamble": "\n\nThe notions of mental representation and intentionality are\nintrinsically related in contemporary philosophy of mind, since it is\nusually thought that a mental state has content or is about something\nother than itself due to its representational nature. These notions\nhave a parallel history in medieval philosophy as well and are now\nwell studied, at least up to Buridan (see, for example, in Knudsen\n1982, Tweedale 1990, Pasnau 1997, Perler 2001, Perler 2002, King 2007,\nLagerlund 2007a, Black 2010, Amerini 2011, and Klima 2015).\n\nOne reason for the interest in intentionality and representation in\nmedieval philosophy is that it has been widely recognized that Franz\nBrentano was reviving a scholastic notion when he introduced\nintentionality as \u201cthe mark of the mental\u201d (Brentano\n1874). But Brentano never used the terminology of representation to\nexplicate intentionality. This was done much later, in\npost-Wittgensteinian philosophy of mind. In later medieval philosophy,\nit was, however, standard to explain the content of a thought by\nreferring to its representational nature.\n\nThere are a variety of theories of mental representation in medieval\nphilosophy, which were intensely discussed from the twelfth century up\nto the time of Descartes. This article will briefly trace the history\nof the terminology and also give a brief outline of the main theories\ndeveloped during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Ancient Background and the Formation of the Concept\n\nThe English words \u2018representation\u2019 and \u2018to\nrepresent\u2019 derive via Old French from the Latin words\n\u2018repraesentatio\u2019 and \u2018repraesentare,\u2019 but\nthese are by no means commonly used words in classical Latin. In late\nancient thought it is foremost Quintilian and Tertullian that uses the\nterms in a philosophically interesting way. It was not until the\ntwelfth century Latin translation of Avicenna\u2019s De\nanima that these terms became frequently used in connection with\ncognition and the mind or the intellective soul (see Lagerlund\n2007b).\n\nThe Latin translators of Avicenna rendered several related terms in\nArabic all related to cognition and the internal senses with the Latin\n\u2018repraesentatio\u2019. In doing so they, intentionally or not,\nformed the concept of representations in the soul. Representation in\nthe Latin translation of Avicenna is associated with all five\nfaculties. Forms received through the common sense and stored in the\nphantasia are called representations. The imaginative or cogitative\nfaculty combines and divides representations collected in the\nphantasia to make new representations, which might not have any real\nobject corresponding to them. The senses apprehend the sensible forms\nof the objects perceived and the estimative faculty apprehends the\n\u2018intentio\u2019 or \u2018ma\u2019na\u2019 of the perceived\nobject. Representations in the imagination are also the basis for\nintellectual activity, according to this view of cognition:\n\nIn the intellect, the form of animal is of the sort that agrees with\none and the same definition of many particular [things]. Thus, one\nform in the intellect will be related to many things, and it is in\nthis respect that it is universal, because it is one intention in the\nintellect \u2026 which is evident since, of those [things]\nrepresented by the form in the imagination, the intellect has\nplundered the intention of its accidents [and] acquired the form in\nthe intellect. (Liber de philosophia prima sive scientia\ndivina V, cap. 1, p. 237)\n\n\nAvicenna here describes the process of abstraction, or how the\nrepresentation in the imagination of particular things becomes\nuniversal in the intellect. The universal forms are abstracted from\nrepresentations in the imagination and flow from the active intellect\ninto the passive. Note, however, that the terminology of\nrepresentation is never used in relation to the intellect. It is\nalways the internal senses that represent in Avicenna and not the\nintellect or the external senses (see Lagerlund 2007b, for a table of\nthe whole range of terms translated by \u2018representation\u2019 in\nAvicenna\u2019s works.)\n\nOne of the reasons \u2018representation\u2019 is only used for the\ninternal senses is that representations are thought of as images. The\nnotion of linguistic representations or representations as signs is\nnot present in Avicenna\u2019s work or any other work of the time. It\nseems instead to derive from logic. Early logic works like Garlandus\nCompotista\u2019s Dialectica (17) and Abelard\u2019s\nDialectica (II, 188) discussed a distinction between a\nword\u2019s signification by imposition and representation. A\ndenominative term such as \u2018white\u2019 signifies by imposition\na substance that is white, but it signifies by representation the\nwhiteness inhering in the substance. The white thing stands in for or\nis an instantiation of whiteness; white is re-presented in the object.\nGarlandus mentions the example of a traveler\n(\u2018viator\u2019) who can be said to represent a road\n(\u2018via\u2019). The term \u2018traveler\u2019\nsignifies by imposition the human being who is a traveler, but also\nrepresents the road the traveler travels on. It is exactly this usage\nof representation applied to mental signs that becomes important with\nOckham and Buridan.\n2. Thomas Aquinas and Formal Sameness\n\nThe most influential theory of thought in the thirteenth century goes\nback to Aristotle and has its foremost medieval defender in Thomas\nAquinas. It rests on viewing mental representations or intelligible\nspecies, as Aquinas calls them, as sameness of form. The explanation\nfor why thoughts are about something, exhibit intentionality, or\nrepresent is that the form of the object thought about is in the mind\nof the thinker. According to a popular metaphor, thinking something,\non this view, is being the object thought about in the sense that the\nintellect becomes the object or takes on its form.\n\nFollowing Aristotle in De anima III.4, Aquinas argues, that\nthe mind or the intellective part of the soul has no nature or rather\nit is nothing before it thinks of something. The active intellect\nabstracts the intelligible species from the sensitive species in the\ninternal senses and places it in the potential intellect. Aquinas is\nhere very close to the view we saw Avicenna defend above. The species\nactualizes the potential intellect as a form actualizes a potency. The\nintelligible species in the potential intellect constitutes the\nthought. The intellect is immaterial, according to Aquinas, and since\nhe also famously thinks that matter is the principle of individuation,\nthe intelligible species in the potential intellect is not individual,\nbut universal. This is why Aquinas holds that a thought is always\nuniversal. \n\nThere are many problems associated with this view of mental\nrepresentation. A famous problem is: why are the daffodils outside my\nsoul not about my thought of the daffodils? The forms inside and\noutside my mind are the same, suggesting that mental representation is\nsymmetrical. Aquinas has a famous answer to this problem, which is\nthat the daffodils in the garden are not about my thought because of\nthe mode of the form\u2019s presence in them. The forms in the\ndaffodils are really or naturally present whereas in my mind the\nuniversal form is spiritually or intentionally present.\n\nThe distinction between forms being really/naturally or\nspiritually/intentionally present is central to Aquinas\u2019s theory\nof cognition. A form may be present somewhere without literally making\nwhatever substance it informs into something else. Colors in the air,\nfor example, do not make the air really colored: we see colors in the\nobjects around us but not in the intervening air, although they must\nbe there spiritually if sensation is to be a causal process. This\nmeans, of course, that the air must somehow contain the color, which\nentails that intentionality is not a mark of the mental for Aquinas.\nThe air is not in itself a mind (for discussion, see Pasnau 1997,\nChap. 2, and for a completely different take see Brower and\nBrower-Toland 2008).\n3. Peter Olivi and the Rejection of Formal Sameness\n\nOne of the first to criticize the species theory of cognition, in the\nlate thirteenth century, was Peter Olivi. He argued, contrary to\nAristotle and Aquinas, that the mind is active in its cognition of the\nworld; it attends to the object, and it is this move on his part that\nputs the species theory of cognition in a completely different light.\nIn fact, there seems little point in postulating a species through\nwhich the object is cognized. He argues:\n\nThird, because the attention will tend toward the species either in\nsuch a way that it would not pass beyond so as to attend to the\nobject, or in such a way that it would pass beyond. If in the first\nway, then the thing will not be seen in itself but only its image will\nbe seen as if it were the thing itself. That is the role of a memory\nspecies, not a visual one. If in the second way, then after the\ninspection of the species it will inspect the object in itself. In\nthis way it will cognize the object in two ways, first through the\nspecies and second in itself. It will indeed be like when someone sees\nan intervening space and then beyond that sees the fixed object.\n(Peter John Olivi, Quaestiones in secundum librum\nSententiarum, III, q. 74, 123.)\n\n\nIn this passage, it seems clear that for Olivi the species is a thing\nin itself and that there really are three things involved in the\ncognition of an object: the object, the species, and the cognizer. The\nspecies is on his view a representation, namely a thing that stands in\nfor the object in the mind. The main problem he sees with the theory\nis hence epistemological. How can we be sure we are cognizing the\nobject and not the species (see Toivanen 2009, Chap. 4 and Adriaenssen\n2011). Olivi hence argues that this third representing thing is not\nneeded and that the mind can attend to the object directly. Ockham is\nlater on in the early fourteenth century to repeat a similar argument\nagainst the species theory.\n\nBoth Olivi and Ockham seem to take it for granted that species are\nrepresentations and hence a thing added to the object and the\ncognizer. There were, however, two versions of the species theory of\ncognition in the thirteenth century. The most influential one was\nforemost associated with Roger Bacon. According to him, species are\nrepresentations, that is, real extended images like objects\nrepresenting the thing cognized to the cognizer. The other version of\nthe theory was defended by Aquinas. According to him, species were not\nrepresentations but the forms themselves of the objects cognized under\na different mode of being. The species were not real but spiritual and\nas such there are no physical change of for example the eye in a\nvisual perception; only a spiritual one.\n\nOlivi\u2019s objection mentioned above does not apply to\nAquinas\u2019 theory since species are not real representations on\nthat view. Olivi himself seems aware of this, however, and says that\nif the species has spiritual being, then they cannot: \u201ctruly and\nnaturally flow from a natural, corporeal form, [and] not really and\ntruly inform a natural body, e.g. the air or the eye.\u201d\n(Sententiarum II, q. 73, 87.) On Aquinas\u2019 theory the\nspecies cannot affect the sense organ and cause a cognition, he seems\nto think. The species cannot hence fulfill the role they are supposed\nto play in a theory of cognition or a theory of vision.\n\nOlivi does not straight our reject all species, however, since he\nthinks memory utilizes species. These species are representations and\nthey are constructed by us. He explains it in the following\npassage:\n\nCognitive acts are effected by the [cognitive] power \u2014 not,\nhowever, through its nude essence. Rather, in all [cognitive acts] an\nactual attention, actually terminated upon the object, is\nrequired\u2026. And therefore, when the exterior thing\nin-and-of-itself (per se) is not placed before the attention, there\nmust be a memorative species placed before it in lieu of the object,\nwhich [the species] is not the origin of the cognitive act, except\ninsofar as it serves as a term for or representative of the object.\n(Sententiarum II, q. 74, 113.)\n\n\nThis is the most common usage of species after Olivi, that is, that\nspecies are representative (see Adriaenssen 2017).\n4. Henry of Ghent and John Duns Scotus on Mental Content\n\nFor various reasons, the late thirteenth century saw an increased\ninterest in epistemology. One reason for this was the development of\nnew theories of mental representations and intentionality. Some of\nthese developments were due to problematic features of, on the one\nhand, Aquinas\u2019s view of mental representation and on the other,\nof Henry of Ghent\u2019s interpretation of Augustine\u2019s view of\ndivine cognition. Aquinas seems to have held that the intelligible\nspecies is supposed to play a dual role both as a universal common to\nall of us thinking it and as my individual thought. It is hard to see\nhow such a view can be maintained without the introduction of some\nkind of distinction. Henry on the other hand reinterprets\nAugustine\u2019s doctrine of divine ideas and introduces a\ndistinction between the ideas and the divine nature. The ideas are\npossibilia or the natures of possible things to be created (de Rijk\n2005: 81\u201384).\n\nBoth of these views contribute to the introduction of a distinction\nbetween the vehicle and the content of a representation. The\ndistinction developed by Henry in relation to the divine nature was\nalmost immediately taken up into the debates about human cognition. It\nwas applied to Aquinas\u2019s theory of mental representation, taking\nit a step further by introducing a distinction between the thing\nrepresenting and the thing represented. \n\nJohn Duns Scotus was instrumental in adapting this view to human\ncognition. Scotus\u2019s implemented Henry\u2019s distinction and\ntreated the thing that does the representing as a mental act or\nconcept, which ontologically speaking is an accident of the mind, and\nthe thing represented as the form of the object thought about. Scotus\nclaimed that the accident or mental act is subjectively in the soul,\nwhereas the object being represented is present objectively, or has\nobjective being in the mind. He also said that the object exists as\nrepresented to express the content side of the mental representation\n(Ord. I, d. 3, pars 3, q. 1, n. 382) Scouts can through this\ndistinction also maintain that all spiritual change supervenes on a\nreal change (see Cross 2014). \n\nScotus thus had a clear way of expressing what Brentano later called\nintentionality, that is, the way the object of thought exists in the\nmind. It has objective existence in the mind on his view, which later\ncame to be regarded as the mark of the mental (see Normore 1986;\nPasnau 2003; King 2007; Cross 2014). Although the advantages of this\napproach over Aquinas\u2019s are clear, problems remains concerning\nthe ontological status of these mental contents. The medieval debate\nhere is famous and features a wide variety of opinions (for a survey,\nsee Tachau 1988). Scotus himself says that thought objects have a\ndiminished kind of being, which is supposed to be a state between real\nbeing and no being at all. Although first accepting a similar view,\nOckham would later subject this view to much criticism.\n6. William Ockham and Mental Language\n\nThe theory of mental language in the fourteenth century was foremost\ndeveloped by William Ockham. It rests on a theory of mental\nrepresentation that combined the notions of cause and signification. A\nconcept or a mental term on this view represents because it is caused\nefficiently by a thing in the world. It signifies that thing also\nbecause of the causal relation between them. On Ockham\u2019s view, a\nmental representation or concept is caused by an intuitive cognition.\nHe explains:\n\nIntuitive cognition is the proper cognition of a singular not because\nof its greater likeness to one thing more than another but because it\nis naturally caused by one thing and not by another; nor can it be\ncaused by another. If you object that it can be caused by God alone, I\nreply that this is true: such a visual apprehension is always apt to\nbe caused by one created object and not by another; and if it is\ncaused naturally, it is caused by one thing and not by another, and it\nis not able to be caused by another. (Quodlibeta Septem 1.13)\n\n\nAccording to Ockham\u2019s metaphysics there are only individuals in\nthe world so that when an individual causes a concept to exist in the\nmind, it causes an individual concept and hence a singular conception\nof itself. Nothing else can cause that concept (except perhaps God).\nThe singular concept functions as the word of the object that caused\nit in our language of thought. It is an atomic constituent that can\nthen be combined to form more complex concepts or sentences in the\nlanguage.\n\nOckham\u2019s notion of concept acquisition and mental representation\nis developed as part of a very sophisticated theory of thought\ninvolving not only a theory of signification, but also a whole range\nof logico-semantic properties such as connotation and supposition. It\nexplains how concepts, which in turn are the direct objects of belief\nand knowledge, are assembled into mental sentences describing the\nworld (for the details, see Panaccio 2004).\n5. John Buridan and Vague Concepts\n\nOckham and John Buridan\u2019s accounts of thought are on the one\nhand very similar, but on the other hand there are fundamental\ndifferences between them. This is particularly true about their view\nof mental representation. A case in point is their views of singular\nthought. They both start out from the same idea, that is, that\nthinking something singular is having a singular concept in mind, but\nthey disagree fundamentally on what a singular concept looks like and,\nforemost, on how it manages to latch onto the world. On Ockham\u2019s\naccount a concept is singular because its cause is proper, as he calls\nit, and proper causes are necessarily tied to one object. But on\nBuridan\u2019s account, a singular concept is singular because of its\nsemantic complexity (see Klima 2001: xxxviii\u2013xlii and 2009:\n40\u201356). It has a descriptive content that enables it to narrow\ndown its signification. However, Buridan retains Ockham\u2019s view for\nsome terms (for the significance of this difference from Ockham, see\nKlima 2009: 69\u201389).\n\nBuridan thinks that we always in the first instance cognize or\nconceive of something as singular. There are, however, two kinds of\nsingular concepts, namely, vague and determinate singular concepts.\nThere are also two ways a singular concept or mental term can be\nacquired. The vague terms are acquired through perception and involves\na direct acquaintance with the perceived object. Buridan describes how\nwe see something approaching from a distance and cognize it as\n\u2018this thing\u2019, then as \u2018this body\u2019, then as\n\u2018this animal\u2019, then as \u2018this donkey\u2019, and\nfinally as \u2018Brunellus.\u2019 (For more on this and its\nsignificance see Normore 2007, Black 2011, Lagerlund 2006, and\nLagerlund 2014.) These demonstratives describe circumstances in which\nwe cognize something singularly, and they come together under a\ndescription of a singular thing, which we impose on it ourselves or\nhave learned the name of, in this case, \u2018Brunellus.\u2019 The\nvague singular term is a name for a circumstance in which we cognize a\nnon-determinate singular thing as something, for example, an\nindividual thing, body, donkey, etc. There is, however, another way a\nsingular can be formed and that is by imposing or associating it with\na name of some descriptions or properties that we never have had a\ncorresponding vague singular cognition of, since we have no actual\nacquaintance with the thing through sense perception. These are\nsingular terms like \u2018Socrates\u2019 or \u2018Plato.\u2019\nThey have never directly existed before our senses and intellect. We\nonly know them through descriptions. Buridan explains the difference\nin Summulae de Dialectica 8.2.1 (Buridan SD, 633): \n\nAnother reason is that things cannot be cognized as singular unless\nthey are cognized as something in the prospect of the cognizer.\nTherefore, if I did not perceive Socrates, you cannot tell me what I\nshould understand by \u2018Socrates,\u2019 except by using common\nterms, the aggregate of which can just as well apply to something else\nas to Socrates. So, should another thing be created similar to\nSocrates in all of its external features [circumstantiis], this\n[aggregate] would no longer be the definition of\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, for it would not be proper to it, nor\nconvertible with it.\n\n\nAs explained above, only terms that derive from actual sense\ncognitions (what he here calls cognition in \u2018the prospect\u2019) are\nproperly singular. They have an element that fixes them to the thing\ncognized.\n\nHe seems to think that all proper singular terms are collections of\ndescriptions of a thing under a name. This goes for singulars that I\nam acquainted with as well as singulars I have no sense acquaintance\nwith. Assume that I have the concept \u2018Brunellus\u2019 in my\nmental language, which I have formed through vague singulars, that is,\nthrough circumstances in which I have perceived him as this or that.\nThese vague singulars express the demonstrative aspect of my\nexperience of Brunellus. They come together under the singular term\n\u2018Brunellus\u2019 with all the things I \u2018know\u2019 about\nhim. I have no such demonstrative element in my singular terms of\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 and \u2018Plato,\u2019 since they have never\nand cannot exist in a direct sense cognition. In that respect, there\nis nothing part of such singular terms that discriminate them from\nother term than the sum of descriptions I have sorted under these\nterms. They will, to use Saul Kripke\u2019s terminology, never\nrigidly pick out what they signify. \u2018Brunellus\u2019 on the\nother hand will, because of the demonstrative element derived from my\nactual interactions with him. (For a slightly different take on this preserving the rigid designation of terms like 'Socrates' or 'Plato' see Klima 2009, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.)\n\nBuridan is defending an internalist semantics for singular terms. It\nis not internalist because of the two different kinds of singular\nterms or that they both are collections of descriptions and\ncircumstances in which we have interacted with something, but instead\nbecause the imposition of these terms describes a process that is\ncompletely internal to the agent. It is up to us to sort names with\ndescriptions and circumstances and, hence, impose certain names on\nthese descriptions and circumstances. Give this, two speakers of the\nsame language could have the same name for an individual and even be\nusing it for the same individual despite the fact that the names they\nuse have different content or meaning because they have different\ndescriptions in mind during the conversation. Meaning is, hence, in\nthe head for Buridan. A position quite different from Ockham (for more\non this see Panaccio 2017 and Lagerlund 2024).\n",
