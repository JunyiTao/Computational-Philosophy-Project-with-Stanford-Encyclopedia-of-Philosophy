Mixed Accounts\n\nGiven the challenges faced by pure consequentialist and pure\nretributivist accounts, some theorists have sought to make progress on\nthe question of punishment\u2019s justification by incorporating\nconsequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements into their\naccounts.\n\nPerhaps the most influential example of a mixed account begins by\nrecognizing that the question of punishment\u2019s justification is\nin fact several different questions, which may be answered by appeal\nto different considerations. In particular, Hart (1968: 9\u201310)\npointed out that we may ask about punishment, as about any social\ninstitution, what compelling rationale there is to maintain the\ninstitution (that is, what values or aims it fosters) and also what\nconsiderations should govern the institution. The compelling rationale\nwill itself entail certain constraints: e.g., the rationale of\ndeterrence would rule out punishments that had no deterrent effect or,\nworse, tended to exacerbate crime levels. What distinguishes hybrid\ntheories such as Hart\u2019s, however, is the claim that there may be\nconstraining considerations that do not flow from punishment\u2019s\nrationale. On Hart\u2019s account, the compelling rationale for\npunishment (what he termed its \u2018general justifying aim\u2019)\nlies in its beneficial effects, but our pursuit of that aim must be\nconstrained by nonconsequentialist principles that preclude the kinds\nof injustice alleged to flow from a purely consequentialist account:\nprinciples that forbid, for instance, the deliberate punishment of the\ninnocent, or the excessively harsh punishment of the guilty. (See most\nfamously Hart 1968, and Scheid 1997 for a sophisticated Hartian\ntheory; on Hart, see Lacey 1988: 46\u201356; Morison 1988; Primoratz\n1999: ch. 6.6.)\n\nAlthough analysis of \u2018the hybrid theory\u2019 of punishment has\ntended to focus on Hart\u2019s version of it, one might endorse\nhybrid views that vary significantly from Hart\u2019s. For example,\nwhereas Hart endorsed a consequentialist rationale for punishment and\nnonconsequentialist side-constraints, one might instead endorse a\nretributivist rationale constrained by consequentialist considerations\n(punishment should not tend to exacerbate crime, or undermine offender\nreform, etc.), or constrained by nonconsequentialist (but not\nretributivist) considerations such as human rights or respect for\npersons. Alternatively, one might endorse an account on which both\nconsequentialist and retributivist considerations features as\nrationales but for different branches of the law: on such an account,\nthe legislature determines crimes and establishes sentencing ranges\nwith the aim of crime reduction, but the judiciary makes sentencing\ndecisions based on retributivist considerations of desert (M. C.\nAltman 2021; Rawls\u2019s account (1955) has also been characterised\nas a hybrid view of this sort, but in fact it is a version of rule\nutilitarianism; on the variety of hybrid views, see Hoskins 2021).\n\nCritics have charged that hybrid accounts are ad hoc or internally\ninconsistent (see Kaufman 2008: 45-49). In addition, retributivists\nargue that hybrid views that integrate consequentialist rationales\nwith retributivist side-constraints thereby relegate retributivism to\na merely subsidiary role, when in fact giving offenders their just\ndeserts is a (or the) central rationale for punishment (see Wood 2002:\n303).\n\nAlso, because hybrid accounts incorporate consequentialist and\nretributivist elements, they may be subject to some of the same\nobjections raised against pure versions of consequentialism or\nretributivism. For example, insofar as they endorse retributivist\nconstraints on punishment, they face the thorny problem of explaining\nthe retributivist notion of desert (see s. 4 above): but it is not\nclear whether they can be justified without such an appeal to\nretributivist desert (see Hart 1968: 44\u201348; Feinberg 1988:\n144\u201355; Walker 1991, ch. 11). Even if such side-constraints can\nbe securely grounded, however, consequentialist theories of punishment\nface the broadly Kantian line of objection discussed earlier (s. 3),\nthat punishing with the aim of serving some desirable social ends\ntreats those punished merely as means to those further ends, which\ndenies them the respect, the moral standing, that is their due as\nresponsible agents.\n\nSome have contended that punishment with a consequentialist rationale\ndoes not treat those punished merely as means as long as it is\nconstrained by the retributivist prohibitions on punishment of the\ninnocent and disproportionate punishment of the guilty (see Walker\n1980: 80\u201385; Hoskins 2011a). Still, a critic may argue that if\nwe are to treat another with the respect due to her as a rational and\nresponsible agent, we must seek to modify her conduct only by offering\nher good and relevant reasons to modify it for herself. Punishment\naimed at deterrence, incapacitation, or offender reform, however, does\nnot satisfy that demand. A reformative system treats those subjected\nto it not as rational, self-determining agents, but as objects to be\nre-formed by whatever efficient (and humane) techniques we can find.\nAn incapacitative system does not leave those subjected to it free, as\nresponsible agents should be left free, to determine their own future\nconduct, but seeks to preempt their future choices by incapacitating\nthem. And although a deterrent system does, unlike the others, offer\npotential offenders reason to obey the law, it offers them the wrong\nkind of reason: instead of addressing them as responsible moral\nagents, in terms of the moral reasons which justify the law\u2019s\ndemands on them, it addresses them as merely self-interested beings,\nin the coercive language of threat; deterrence treats \u2018a man\nlike a dog instead of with the freedom and respect due to him as a\nman\u2019 (Hegel 1821: 246. For these objections, see Lewis 1953; H\nMorris 1968; Duff 1986: 178\u201386; von Hirsch 1993: 9\u201314; von\nHirsch and Ashworth 1998, chs. 1, 3).\n\nOne strategy for dealing with them is to posit a two-step\njustification of punishment. The first step, which typically appeals\nto nonconsequentialist values, shows how the commission of a crime\nrenders the offender eligible for, or liable to, the kinds of coercive\ntreatment that punishment involves: such treatment, which is normally\ninconsistent with the respect due to us as rational agents or as\ncitizens, and inconsistent with the Kantian means principle, is\nrendered permissible by the commission of the offence. The second step\nis then to offer positive consequentialist reasons for imposing\npunishment on those who are eligible for it or liable to it: we should\npunish if and because this can be expected to produce sufficient\nconsequential benefits to outweigh its undoubted costs. (Further\nnonconsequentialist constraints might also be placed on the severity\nand modes of punishment that can be permitted: constraints either\nflowing from an account of just what offenders render themselves\nliable to, or from other values external to the system of\npunishment.)\n\nThus, for instance, some argue that those who voluntarily break the\nlaw thereby forfeit at least some of the rights that citizens can\nnormally claim: their wrongdoing therefore legitimises kinds of\ntreatment (reformative or incapacitative treatment, for instance, or\ndeterrent punishment) that would normally be wrong as violating\ncitizens\u2019 rights (see Goldman 1982; C Morris 1991; Wellman 2012;\nfor criticisms, see Lippke 2001a; Boonin 2008: 103\u201319). We must\nask, however, whether we should be so quick to exclude fellow citizens\nfrom the rights and status of citizenship, or whether we should not\nlook for an account of punishment (if it is to be justified at all) on\nwhich punishment can still be claimed to treat those punished as full\ncitizens. (The common practice of denying imprisoned offenders the\nright to vote while they are in prison, and perhaps even after they\nleave prison, is symbolically significant in this context: those who\nwould argue that punishment should be consistent with recognised\ncitizenship should also oppose such practices; see Lippke 2001b;\nJournal of Applied Philosophy 2005; see also generally s.\n9.)\n\nAnother view holds that punishment does not violate offenders\u2019\nrights insofar as they consent to their punishment (see Nino 1983).\nThe consent view holds that when a person voluntarily commits a crime\nwhile knowing the consequences of doing so, she thereby consents to\nthese consequences. This is not to say that she explicitly\nconsents to being punished, but rather than by her voluntary action\nshe tacitly consents to be subject to what she knows are the\nconsequences. Notice that, like the forfeiture view, the consent view\nis agnostic regarding the positive aim of punishment: it purports to\ntell us only that punishing the person does not wrong her, as she has\neffectively waived her right against such treatment. The consent view\nfaces formidable objections, however. First, it appears unable to\nground prohibitions on excessively harsh sentences: if such sentences\nare implemented, then anyone who subsequently violates the\ncorresponding laws will have apparently tacitly consented to the\npunishment (Alexander 1986). A second objection is that most offenders\ndo not in fact consent, even tacitly, to their sentences, because they\nare unaware either that their acts are subject to punishment or of the\nseverity of the punishment to which they may be liable. For someone to\nhave consented to be subject to certain consequences of an act, she\nmust know of these consequences (see Boonin 2008: 161\u201364). A\nthird objection is that, because tacit consent can be overridden by\nexplicit denial of consent, it appears that explicitly nonconsenting\noffenders could not be justifiably punished on this view (ibid.:\n164\u2013165; but see Imbrisevic 2010).\n\nOthers offer contractualist or contractarian justifications of\npunishment, grounded in an account not of what treatment offenders\nhave in fact tacitly consented to, but rather of what rational agents\nor reasonable citizens would endorse. The punishment of those who\ncommit crimes is then, it is argued, rendered permissible by the fact\nthat the offender himself would, as a rational agent or reasonable\ncitizen, have consented to a system of law that provided for such\npunishments (see e.g., Dolovich 2004; Brettschneider 2007; Finkelstein\n2011; for criticism, see Dagger 2011; see also Matravers 2000). Still\nothers portray punishment (in particular deterrent punishment) as a\nspecies of societal (self-) defence \u2014 and it seems clear that to\ndefend oneself against a wrongful attack is not to use the attacker\n\u2018merely as a means\u2019, or to fail to show him the respect\nthat is his due. (For versions of this kind of argument, see Alexander\n1980; Quinn 1985; Farrell 1985, 1995; Montague 1995; Ellis 2003 and\n2012. For criticism, see Boonin 2008: 192\u2013207. For a\nparticularly intricate development of this line of thought, grounding\nthe justification of punishment in the duties that we incur by\ncommitting wrongs, see Tadros 2011; for critical responses, see the\nspecial issue of Law and Philosophy, 2013.)\n\nOne might argue that the Hegelian objection to a system of deterrent\npunishment overstates the tension between the types of reasons, moral\nor prudential, that such a system may offer. Punishment may\ncommunicate both a prudential and a moral message to members of the\ncommunity. Even before a crime is committed, the threat of punishment\ncommunicates societal condemnation of an offense. This moral message\nmay help to dissuade potential offenders, but those who are\nunpersuaded by this moral message may still be prudentially deterred\nby the prospect of punishment. Similarly, those who actually do commit\ncrimes may be dissuaded from reoffending by the moral censure conveyed\nby their punishment, or else by the prudential desire to avoid another\nround of hard treatment. What\u2019s more, even if punishment itself\ndid provide solely prudential reasons not to commit crimes,\nthe criminal legal system more generally may communicate with citizens\nin moral terms. Through its criminal statutes, a community declares\ncertain acts to be wrong and makes a moral appeal to community members\nto comply, whereas trials and convictions can communicate a message of\ndeserved censure to the offender. Thus even if a system of deterrent\npunishment is itself regarded as communicating solely in prudential\nterms, it seems that the criminal law more generally can still\ncommunicate a moral message to those subject to it (see Hoskins\n2011a).\n\nA somewhat different attempt to accommodate prudential as well as\nmoral reasons in an account of punishment begins with the\nretributivist notion that punishment is justified as a form of\ndeserved censure, but then contends that we should communicate censure\nthrough penal hard treatment because this will give those who are\ninsufficiently impressed by the moral appeal of censure prudential\nreason to refrain from crime; because, that is, the prospect of such\npunishment might deter those who are not susceptible to moral\npersuasion. (See Lipkin 1988, Baker 1992. For a sophisticated revision\nof this idea, which makes deterrence firmly secondary to censure, see\nvon Hirsch 1993, ch. 2; Narayan 1993. For critical discussion, see\nBottoms 1998; Duff 2001, ch. 3.3. For another subtle version of this\nkind of account, see Matravers 2000.) This kind of account differs\nfrom the accounts just discussed, on which retributivist prohibitions\non punishment of the innocent or excessive punishment of the guilty\nconstrain the pursuit of consequentialist aims, since in the current\naccount the (retributivist) imposition of deserved censure is part of\nthe positive justifying aim of punishment; and it can claim, in\nresponse to the Hegelian objection to deterrence, that it does not\naddress potential offenders merely \u2018like dogs\u2019, since the\nlaw\u2019s initial appeal to the citizen is in the appropriate moral\nterms: the prudential, coercive reasons constituted by penal hard\ntreatment as deterrence are relevant only to those who are deaf, or at\nleast insufficiently attentive, to the law\u2019s moral appeal. It\nmight be objected that on this account the law, in speaking to those\nwho are not persuaded by its moral appeal, is still abandoning the\nattempt at moral communication in favour of the language of threats,\nand thus ceasing to address its citizens as responsible moral agents:\nto which it might be replied, first, that the law is addressing us,\nappropriately, as fallible moral agents who know that we need the\nadditional spur of prudential deterrence to persuade us to act as we\nshould; and second, that we cannot clearly separate the (merely)\ndeterrent from the morally communicative dimensions of punishment\n\u2014 that the dissuasive efficacy of legitimate punishment still\ndepends crucially on the moral meaning that the hard treatment is\nunderstood to convey.\n\nOne more mixed view worth noting holds that punishment is justified as\na means of teaching a moral lesson to those who commit crimes, and\nperhaps to community members more generally (the seminal articulations\nof this view are H. Morris 1981 and Hampton 1984; for a more recent\naccount, see Demetriou 2012; for criticism, see Deigh 1984,\nShafer-Landau 1991). Like standard consequentialist accounts, the\nmoral education view acknowledges that punishment\u2019s role in\nreducing crime is a central part of its rationale (see, e.g., Hampton\n1984: 211). But education theorists also take seriously the Hegelian\nworry discussed earlier; they view punishment not as a means of\nconditioning people to behave in certain ways, but rather as a means\nof teaching them that what they have done should not be done because\nit is morally wrong. Thus although the education view sets offender\nreform as an end, it also implies certain nonconsequentialist\nconstraints on how we may appropriately pursue this end. Another\ndistinctive feature of the moral education view is that it conceives\nof punishment as aiming to confer a benefit on the offender: the\nbenefit of moral education. Critics have objected to the moral\neducation view on various grounds, however. Some are sceptical about\nwhether punishment is the most effective means of moral education.\nOthers deny that most offenders need moral education; many offenders\nrealise what they are doing is wrong but are weak-willed, impulsive,\netc. Also, may liberal theorists object that the education view is\ninappropriately paternalistic in that it endorses coercively\nrestricting offenders\u2019 liberties as a means to confer a benefit\non them.\n\nEach of the theories discussed in this section incorporates, in\nvarious ways, consequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements.\nWhether any of these is more plausible than pure consequentialist or\npure retributivist alternatives is, not surprisingly, a matter of\nongoing philosophical debate. One possibility, of course, is that none\nof the theories on offer is successful because punishment is,\nultimately, unjustifiable. The next section considers penal\nabolitionism.\n",
