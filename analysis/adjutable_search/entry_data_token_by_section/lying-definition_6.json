    "main_text": "Deceptionism vs. Non-Deceptionism About Lying\n2. Deceptionism vs. Non-Deceptionism About Lying\n\n\nThere are two positions held by those who write on the definition of\nlying: Deceptionism and Non-Deceptionism (Mahon 2014). The first\ngroup, Deceptionists, hold that an intention to deceive is necessary\nfor lying. Deceptionists may be divided further in turn into Simple\nDeceptionists, who hold that lying requires the making of an\nuntruthful statement with an intention to deceive; Complex\nDeceptionists, who hold that lying requires the making of an\nuntruthful assertion with the intention to deceive by means of a\nbreach of trust or faith; and Moral Deceptionists, who hold that lying\nrequires the making of an untruthful statement with the intention to\ndeceive, as well as the violation of a moral right of another or the\nmoral wronging of another. The second group, Non-Deceptionists, hold\nthat an intention to deceive is not necessary for lying. They see the\ntraditional definition as both incorrect and\ninsufficient. Non-Deceptionists may be further divided into Simple\nNon-Deceptionists, who hold that the making of an untruthful statement\nis sufficient for lying, and Complex Non-Deceptionists, who hold that\na further condition, in addition to making an untruthful statement, is\nrequired for lying. Some Complex Non-Deceptionists hold that lying\nrequires warranting the truth of what is stated, and other Complex\nNon-Deceptionists hold that lying requires the making of an untruthful\nassertion.\n",
