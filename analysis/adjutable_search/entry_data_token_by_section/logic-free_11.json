    "main_text": "Semantics || Supervaluations\n3.4 Supervaluations\n\nNeutral semantics can be made to validate all the theorems of standard\nfree logics by augmenting them with supervaluations. Supervaluations\nwere first formalized by van Fraassen (1966). The version presented\nhere is a variant of Bencivenga\u2019s approach (1981 and 1986).\n\nThe fundamental idea is this: when empty terms deprive a formula of\ntruth-value, supervaluational semantics nevertheless accounts it true\n(or false) if all possible ways of assigning referents to those terms\nagree in making it true (or false). This strategy restores validity to\nmany principles that would lose it in an ordinary neutral semantics.\nThe following instance of the law of noncontradiction:\n\n\\[ {\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt), \\]\n\n\nfor example, is truth-valueless when \\(t\\) is nondenoting (assuming an\nordinary neutral semantics that makes the negation of a\ntruth-valueless formula truth-valueless). Hence in such a semantics\nthe law itself is invalid. Yet were we to assign a referent to \\(t\\),\nthat referent would either be in the extension of \\(P\\) or not. If it\nwere, then \\(Pt\\) would be true. If it were not, then \\(Pt\\) would be\nfalse. In either case \\({\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) would be true. Thus,\nsince all possible ways of assigning referents to \\(t\\) agree in\nmaking \\({\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) true, we should count \\({\\sim}(Pt\n\\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) itself as true. In this way the law of\nnoncontradiction can be preserved.\n\nMore explicitly, a supervaluation begins with a neutral model \\(\\bM\\)\nwith a single, possibly empty domain. We then construct the set of\ncompletions of \\(\\bM\\). These may be regarded as bivalent\ndual-domain positive models whose inner domain is the domain of\n\\(\\bM\\), but which also have an outer domain \\(\\bD_o\\) to provide\nreferents for the empty terms. In each completion, singular terms that\nare nonempty in \\(\\bM\\) retain their referents, and those\nthat are empty in \\(\\bM\\) denote a member of \\(\\bD_o - \\bD\\). For each\n\\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\), the extension of \\(P\\) is a subset of\n\\(\\bD_o^n\\) and a superset of \\(P\\text{'s}\\) extension in \\(\\bM\\).\n\nFrom these completions we now construct a supervaluation. A\nsupervaluation of \\(\\bM\\) is a partial assignment of\ntruth-values to formulas that makes a formula true if all completions\nof \\(\\bM\\) make it true, false if they all make it false, and\ntruth-valueless if they disagree. A formula is valid on a\nsupervaluational semantics if and only if it is true on all\nsupervaluations. This semantics validates all and only the theorems of\nPFL (Bencivenga 1981, Morscher & Simons 2001, pp.\n14\u201318).\n\nSupervaluations employ what Bencivenga (1986) calls a\n\u201ccounterfactual theory\u201d of truth: an empty-termed\nstatement is true if it would be true on any\nassignment of referents to its empty terms. This has struck many\ncritics as simply false. Moreover, the logic itself leaves much to be\ndesired. For one thing, supervaluational consequence is too strong.\nThus, for example, although the formula \\(Pt \\rightarrow \\rE!t\\) is\n(quite properly) not valid on a supervaluational semantics,\nnevertheless since \\(\\rE!t\\) is true on every supervaluation on which\n\\(Pt\\) is true, the sequent (derivability statement) \\(Pt \\vdash\n\\rE!t\\) is improperly semantically valid. Therefore, although\nPFL is sound on supervaluational semantics and every semantically\nvalid formula is a theorem of PFL, not all semantically valid sequents\nare provable in PFL. In fact, supervaluational consequence is not\naxiomatizable by any extension of free logic. This follows from a\nresult of Woodruff (1984), who has shown that supervaluational\nsemantics has many of the undesirable properties of second-order\nsemantics. Jerry A. Fodor and Ernest Lapore (1996) argue, furthermore,\nthat the completions needed to construct supervaluations are not\nmeaning-preserving. Hence, they conclude, two alleged advantages of\nsupervaluations\u2014that they explain the meaningfulness of\nsentences with truth value gaps and that they allow us to preserve\nclassical logic\u2014are illusory. Finally, since supervaluations are\nbuilt from completions that are in effect positive dual-domain models,\nwe may wonder whether the detour through supervaluations is worth the\ntrouble, since positive dual-domain models alone are simpler and more\nadequate to PFL.\n",
