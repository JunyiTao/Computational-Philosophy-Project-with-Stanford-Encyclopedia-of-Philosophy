    "main_text": "The Logic of Grundgesetze || The Rules of Inference of Grundgesetze\n3.4 The Rules of Inference of Grundgesetze\n\nDespite frequent claims that Frege\u2019s logic is unwieldy and\ndifficult to use, the rules of inference that Frege formulates\ndemonstrate the opposite: the resulting system, which takes advantage\nof the systematic ambiguity present in Frege\u2019s way of reading\nconditionals, is in many ways more powerful and more elegant than\nmodern deductive systems.\n\nFirst, we remind the reader of the three rules of inference that have\nalready been discussed, and which can be applied in derivations within\nthe logic of Grundgesetze without any comment or label. These\nare the permutation of subcomponents, the fusion of identical\nsubcomponents, and the fusion of horizontals. In addition to these,\nFrege introduces six rules of inference.\n3.4.1 Generalized Modus Ponens\n\nThe first is Generalized Modus Ponens (the term\n\u201cGeneralized Modus Ponens\u201d is not Frege\u2019s, he calls\nthis inference \u201cInferring(a)\u201d), which Frege describes\nthusly:\n\n\nIf a subcomponent of a proposition differs from a second\nproposition only in lacking the judgement-stroke, then one may infer a\nproposition which results from the first by suppressing that\nsubcomponent. (1893/1903: \u00a714)\n\n\nSimply put, if one has proven a Grundgesetze conditional, and\none has also proven a subcomponent of that conditional, then one may\ninfer the result of deleting that subcomponent from the conditional.\nAssume that we have proven the Grundgesetze proposition: \n\n\n\n\n\nThen, if we also have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, then we can conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\nOn this application, we are parsing the conditional in question such\nthat \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is the\nrelevant subcomponent, and: \n\n\n\n\n\nthe supercomponent. If, on the other hand, we have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, then we would instead conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\ntreating both \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d as subcomponents,\nand \u201c\\(\\Theta\\)\u201d as\nsupercomponent. Applications of Generalized Modus Ponens are indicated\nby a solid horizontal line. This is the first instance of a\ntransition sign (1893/1903: \u00a714).\n\nThis rule is an incredibly powerful generalization of the simple\nversion of modus ponens found in Begriffsschrift, or\nincluded in modern deductive systems that use linear notation.\nConsider how many steps would be needed to transition from: \n\n\\[A_1 \\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow\n(A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5 \\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow (A_8\n\\rightarrow B)))))))\\]\n\n\nand \\(A_8\\) to:  \n\\[A_1\n\\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow (A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5\n\\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow B))))))\\]\n\n\nin a typical natural deduction system. Within the logic of\nGrundgesetze, Frege can carry out the analogous deduction in\none step. Similar comments regarding the power of Frege\u2019s rules\nof inference apply to the other rules that take advantage of the fact\nthat Grundgesetze formulas can be parsed into subcomponent(s)\nand supercomponent in more than one way (that is, to Generalized\nHypothetical Syllogism, Generalized Contraposition, and Generalized\nDilemma).\n\nFrege allows for multiple, simultaneous applications of the\ngeneralized form of Generalized Modus Ponens. Thus, if we\nhave proven: \n\n\n\n\n\nand we then prove both \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, and \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, we may eliminate both subcomponents\nsimultaneously, marking the transition with a double horizontal line\n(1893/1903: \u00a714).\n3.4.2 Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism\n\nThe next rule of inference is Generalized Hypothetical\nSyllogism (This is again novel terminology\u2014Frege calls this\nrule \u201cInferring(b)\u201d):\n\n\nIf the same combination of signs occurs in one proposition as\nsupercomponent and in another as subcomponent, then a proposition may\nbe inferred in which the supercomponent of the latter features as\nsupercomponent and all subcomponents of both, save that mentioned,\nfeature as subcomponents. However, subcomponents that occur in both\nneed only be written once. (1893/1903: \u00a715)\n\n\nThis is a generalized, and more powerful, version of familiar rule\nhypothetical syllogism that takes advantage of the\n\u201cequal\u201d status of subcomponents: Given a\nGrundgesetze proposition, and a second proposition whose\nsupercomponent is a subcomponent of the first, we can infer the\nproposition that results from replacing the relevant subcomponent in\nthe first proposition with the subcomponents of the second\nproposition. For example, if we have derived both of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen we can combine these to obtain: \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have combined the two occurrences of \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\ninto a single occurrence.\nApplications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are indicated by\nnew type of transition sign, a dashed horizontal line\n\u201c\u2014\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u201d, and multiple\nsimultaneous applications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are\nindicated by the double dashed horizontal line \u201c= = = =\u201d.\nGeneralized Hypothetical Syllogism is a much more powerful rule-based\nform of Axiom 2 from the logic of Begriffsschrift.\n3.4.3 Generalized Contraposition\n\nThe third rule of inference is Generalized Contraposition\n(Frege calls this rule merely \u201ccontraposition\u201d).\n\n\nOne may permute a subcomponent with a supercomponent provided one\nsimultaneously reverses the truth-value of each. (1893/1903:\n\u00a715)\n\n\nGeneralized contraposition allows us to \u201cswitch\u201d the\nsupercomponent of a Grundgesetze proposition with\nany subcomponent of it, provided one \u201csimultaneously\nreverses the truth-value of each\u201d. Recalling the fact\nthat Frege describes negation as \u201ca sign by means of which every\ntruth-value is transformed into its opposite\u201d (1893/1903:\n\u00a76), this amounts to either adding a single negation to, or\nremoving a single negation from (if at least one negation is present),\neach of the formulas in question. Thus, if we have derived: \n\n\n\n\n\nthen Generalized Contraposition would allows us to obtain any of the\nfollowing: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\nApplications of generalized contraposition are represented using the\ntransition sign \u201c\\(\\Large\n\\times\\)\u201d. Generalized Contraposition is a much more\npowerful rule-based version of Axiom 4 from the logic of\nBegriffsschrift.\n3.4.4 Generalized Dilemma\n\nThe fourth rule of inference is Generalized Dilemma (Frege\ncalls this \u201cInferring(c)\u201d):\n\n\nIf two propositions agree in their supercomponents while a\nsubcomponent of the one differs from a subcomponent of the other only\nby a prefixed negation stroke, then we can infer a proposition in\nwhich the common supercomponent features as supercomponent, and all\nsubcomponents of both propositions with the exception of the two\nmentioned feature as subcomponents. In this, subcomponents which occur\nin both propositions need only be written down once. (1893/1903:\n\u00a716)\n\n\nThus, if we have derived Grundgesetze propositions of the\nform: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nwe can infer: \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is indicated by the dot-dashed line \u201c\\(\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\)\u201d.\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is the only official axiom or rule found in the\nlogic of Grundgesetze, other than those that explicitly\ninvolve value-ranges, that does not have some clear (even if much\nweaker) analogue in the logic of Begriffsschrift, (assuming\nwe count Axioms 5 and 6 as at least very loose analogues of Basic Law\nIV\u2014see above), although an analogue of the rule is of course\nderivable in the earlier system (to put it in contemporary\nterms). After noting, in the Preface to Begriffsschrift, that\nhe has limited himself to as few axioms and rules of inference as\npossible, Frege writes that:\n\n\nThis does not rule out, later, transitions from several\njudgements to a new one, which are possible by this single mode of\ninference only in an indirect way, being converted into direct ones\nfor the sake of abbreviation. In fact, this may be advisable for later\napplications. In this way, then, further modes of inference would\narise. (1879a: Preface)\n\n\nIn the Foreword to Grundgesetze, however, Frege notes a\nrather notable shift in strategy:\n\n\nIn order to attain more flexibility and to avoid excessive length, I\nhave allowed myself tacit use of permutation of subcomponents\n(conditions) and fusion of equal subcomponents, and have not reduced\nthe modes of inference and consequence to a minimum. Anyone acquainted\nwith my little book Begriffsschrift will gather from it how\nhere too one could satisfy the strictest demands, but also that this\nwould result in a considerable increase in extent. (1893/1903:\nForeword)\n\n\nPresumably it is Generalized Dilemma, in particular, that Frege has in\nmind here.\n3.4.5 Concavity Introduction\n\nFrege\u2019s next rule of inference, which we will (following our\ndiscussion of the analogous rule in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift) call Concavity Introduction (Frege\ncall this rule \u201cTransformation of a Roman letter into a German\nletter\u201d), governs the interactions between the two devices for\nexpressing generality within Grundgesetze, the Roman letter\ngenerality device and the concavity:\n\n\nA Roman letter may be replaced whenever it occurs in a proposition\nby one and the same German letter. At the same time, the latter has to\nbe placed above a concavity in front of one such supercomponent\noutside of which the Roman letter does not occur. If in this\nsupercomponent the scope of a German letter is contained and the Roman\nletter occurs within this scope, then the German letter that is to be\nintroduced for the latter must be distinct from the former.\n(1893/1903: \u00a717)\n\n\nMechanically speaking, this is the same rule as the version of\nConcavity Introduction given in the logic of Begriffsschrift.\nThe transition symbol used to label applications of concavity\nintroduction is \u201c\\(\\raise\n1ex{\\underparen{\\hspace{1.5em}}}\\)\u201d.\n3.4.6 Roman Letter Elimination\n\nWhile Concavity Introduction allows us to move from a generality\nexpressed with Roman letters to a generality expressed with the\nconcavity, and Basic Law II (combined with generalized modus\nponens) allows us to move from a generality expressed with the\nconcavity to a generalization expressed with Roman letters, as of yet\nwe have no way to move from a proposition expressing a generality (of\neither sort) to an particular instance (the logic of\nBegriffsschrift contains no names, hence this lack was not a\nshortcoming in that earlier system). Frege rectifies this by\nintroducing what we shall call the Roman Letter Elimination\nrule (Frege calls this rule \u201cCiting Propositions\u201d), which\nhe describes as follows:\n\n\nWhen citing a proposition by its label, we may effect a simple\ninference by uniformly replacing a Roman letter within the proposition\nby the same proper name or the same Roman object-marker.\n\nLikewise, we may replace all occurrences in a proposition of a Roman\nfunction letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(h\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(G\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(H\\)\u201d\nby the same name or Roman\nmarker of a first-level function with one or two arguments, depending\non whether the Roman letter indicates a function with one or two\narguments.\n\nWhen we cite law (IIb), we may replace both occurrences of\n\u201c\\(M_\\beta\\)\u201d by the same name or Roman marker of a\nsecond-level function with one argument of the second kind.\n(1893/1903: \u00a748) \n\n\nRoman Letter Elimination allows for two sorts of application. The\nfirst, and simplest, involves uniformly replacing a particular Roman\nletter with a proper name. But the Roman letter elimination rule also\nallows us to replace a single Roman letter with a Roman object marker.\nHence, using this rule we can also obtain \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(\\)\n\n\\(y)\\)\u201d from \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman object marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(y\\)\u201d. Likewise, given a Grundgesetze\nproposition of the form  \u201c\n\n\\(f(\\Delta)\\)\u201d we can infer either \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the function name \u201c\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\n\\(g(\\)\n\n\\(\\Delta)\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman function marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(g\\)\n\n\u201d). One of the most visible and most important\napplications of the Roman letter elimination rule is when introducing\n\u201cinstances\u201d of axioms, since Frege does not require that\nwe write the axiom explicitly. Instead, we can cite any\n\u201cinstance\u201d of the axiom that results from applying the\nRoman letter elimination rule (one or more times) to the axiom\nitself.\n\nThere is no transition symbol for this inference, since it is applied\nwhen a previously derived formula is used as a premise in an\napplication of one of the other rules listed above.\n\nThis concludes our survey of the logical systems found in\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift and Grundgesetze. But\nit is far from the conclusion of Frege\u2019s thinking on logic.\nAlthough Frege eventually abandoned his logicist project, and those\nparts of his logical system that led to the contradiction (Basic Laws\nV and VI, and the notion of value ranges more generally) in light of\nthe Russell paradox, he continued to teach courses on logic for many\nyears. The reader interested in Frege\u2019s later views should\nconsult the supplementary essay\n Frege\u2019s Logic After the Paradox.",
