    "main_text": "Philosophical Works || Kallias Letters\n2.1 Kallias Letters\n\nSchiller began his philosophical retreat with a thorough study of Kant\nand was immediately inspired by Kant\u2019s description of human\nfreedom. In 1793, he wrote to his friend Christian Gottfried\nK\u00f6rner: \u201cIt is certain that no mortal has spoken a\ngreater word than this Kantian word \u2026 determine yourself from\nwithin yourself\u201d (NA XXVI, 191/KL 153). But Schiller was left\ndissatisfied with two of Kant\u2019s claims as regards aesthetics:\none, that there could be no objective principle of beauty, and two,\nthat aesthetic experience refers only to pleasure felt by the subject,\nnot to any property of the object. In letters to K\u00f6rner, which he\nnever published but after his death became known as the \u201cKallias\nLetters\u201d [\u201cKalliasbriefe\u201d], he set out to\ncorrect these Kantian claims and to place aesthetics on a more secure,\nindependent, and critical foundation.\n\nSchiller proposes to discover the objective principle of beauty\nfollowing the procedure of Kant\u2019s transcendental deduction: by\nasking what our ability to perceive beauty reveals about our mental\nfaculties. He concludes that humans must possess two forms of reason:\ntheoretical and practical. Theoretical reason connects\n\u201crepresentation with representation to gain knowledge\u201d (NA\nXXVI, 179/KL 149). If theoretical reason is applied to concepts, it\nproduces logical judgments. If it is applied to intuitions, it\nproduces teleological judgments. Practical reason, by contrast,\nconnects \u201crepresentation with the will in order to act\u201d\n(NA XXVI, 179/KL 149). Its principle is autonomy or freedom. If\npractical reason is applied to free actions, it produces moral\njudgments. If it is applied to \u201cunfree effects\u201d\u2014in\nother words, to objects in the world\u2014it produces\naesthetic judgments (NA XXVI, 183/KL 152). Judging something\nbeautiful implies that we have encountered the appearance of freedom\nin empirical experience. As Schiller puts it: since practical\nreason\u2019s principle is freedom, beauty is \u201cthus nothing\nless than freedom in appearance\u201d (NA XXVI, 183/KL 152; Schindler\n2008: 93\u20134).\n\nBut what would freedom in appearance actually look like, and how could\nwe identify it? Schiller names two qualities that appear in the object\nitself that prompt us to judge it beautiful. The first, he says, is\nthe \u201cbeing-determined-through-itself of the thing\u201d: a\nsense that it is not determined by outside forces but is rather\nself-determining, existing only \u201cthrough itself\u201d (NA XXVI,\n192/KL 154). As an example, Schiller contrasts a workhorse to a\nSpanish palfrey. The workhorse\n\n\ntrots just as tiredly and clumsily as if it were still pulling a\nwagon, even when it is not pulling one. Its movement no longer springs\nfrom its nature but rather reveals the pulled weight of the wagon. (NA\nXXVI, 204/KL 163\u20134)\n\n\nThe palfrey, by contrast, moves lightly and appears to weigh nothing:\nits movements are \u201can effect of its nature than has been left to\nitself\u201d (NA XXVI, 205/KL 164). This, Schiller says, is a kind of\nautonomy: the palfrey is determined by its own nature, not by gravity\nor function. The beauty of animals generally decreases the more they\nappear determined by gravity, not form: in the case of a light-footed\nhorse, form masters matter; in the case of a duck, matter masters form\n(NA XXVI, 205/KL 164). This analysis allows Schiller to extend his\nclaim that aesthetic judgments are, like moral judgments, a product of\npractical, not theoretical, reason. Moral actions are self-determining\nbecause they follow the form of the moral law, never accounting for\nexternal factors. If something in the sensible world appears to be\nsimilarly self-determining, it will be \u201can analogy of\nthe pure determination of the will\u201d and so an\n\u201cexhibition of freedom\u201d (NA XXVI, 192/KL 154).\nSchiller concludes that\n\n\n[s]elf-determination of the rational is pure determination of reason,\nmorality; self-determination of the sense-world is pure determination\nof nature, beauty. (NA XXVI, 195/KL 156)\n\n\nBut such self-determination is not yet enough to distinguish the\nhighest beauty: the beautiful object\u2019s form must not only be\nself-determining according to some external form but determine that\nform as well. Schiller articulates this distinction in Kantian terms:\nacting freely according to one\u2019s form is autonomous; being the\nsource of the form according to which one acts is heautonomous,\nliterally self self-governing (Beiser 2005: 67; Roehr 2003: 120;\nSchindler 2008: 95). Heautonomy in other words occurs when the rule in\nquestion is \u201cboth given and obeyed by the thing\u201d\n(NA XXVI, 208/KL 167). Beauty is thus found in a landscape \u201cif\nall of the particular parts out of which it is constituted play along\ntogether so well that they set their own limitations\u201d (NA XXVI,\n213/KL 171), or in a dance in which dancers interact \u201cso\nskillfully and yet so artlessly that both seem merely to be following\ntheir own mind\u201d (NA XVI, 216\u20137/KL 174). The qualities of being\nautonomous and heautonomous, Schiller claims, persist in the object\nwhether it is being observed or not. This assertion allows Schiller to\nachieve his second goal of locating beauty in the object rather than\nonly in the observing subject.\n\nSchiller also suggests that when we call an action beautiful, it is\nbecause it too exhibits a spontaneous self-determination that seems to\nspring from the actor\u2019s essence. To illustrate this claim, he\noffers five variations on Jesus\u2019 parable of the Good Samaritan.\nA man has been beaten, robbed, and left to die on the side of the\nroad. Four strangers offer assistance, but in each case, their offer\nis badly motivated: by prudence or greed or out of a tortured sense of\nduty. The fifth man by contrast offers, of his own accord, to abandon\nhis own belongings and carry the wounded man to safety. We call this\nman\u2019s action beautiful, Schiller says, because he \u201cforgot\nhimself in his action\u201d and \u201cfulfilled his duty with the\nease of someone acting out of mere instinct\u201d. In a word,\nSchiller concludes,\n\n\na free action is a beautiful action, if the autonomy of the mind and\nautonomy of appearance coincide. For this reason the highest\nperfection of character in a person is moral beauty brought about by\nthe fact that duty has become its nature. (NA 198/KL 159;\nSchindler 2008: 93\u20134; Winegar 2013: 283\u20134)\n\n\nSchiller himself did not consider this deduction of beauty a success,\nand most of his critics have agreed (Beiser 2005: 61). The status of\nhis claim that beauty is freedom in appearance is also not clear:\nBeiser for instance claims it is regulative since neither autonomy nor\nheautonomy can appear in the natural world, while Houlgate claims that\nthe quality of being \u201cnot-determined-from-the-outside\u201d can\nactually be found in the object (Beiser 2005: 63; Houlgate 2008:\n37\u201349; Schindler 2008: 87). But Schiller\u2019s contention that\naesthetic judgment falls in the provenance of practical rather than\ntheoretical reason laid the groundwork for his later depiction of\naesthetic aspects to moral action, and his use of form as a dynamic\nconcept is credited with offering a plausible alternative to\nKant\u2019s subjectivist description of aesthetic experience\n(Schindler 2008, Falduto 2020).\n",
