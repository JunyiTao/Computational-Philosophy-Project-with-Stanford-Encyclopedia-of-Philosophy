Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers have identified and debated several meanings of\n\u201cprivacy\u201d deployed in medical contexts. Respect for\nrecognized forms of privacy \u2014informational\n (Section 1),\n physical\n (Section 2),\n associational\n (Section 3),\n proprietary\n (Section 4)\n and decisional\n (Section 5)\u2014is\n an ideal of biomedical ethics for the conduct of clinical research\nand administrative practices relating to physical and behavioral\nhealth. There is wide philosophical consensus about the importance of\nmedical confidentiality, modesty and bodily integrity in all health\nsettings; but substantial philosophical disagreement about the limits\nof personal autonomy or individual choice in fields relating to\ncontagious diseases, human reproduction and genetics. Recently,\nsharing medical information with family friends and the general public\nvoluntarily has supplanted norms of secrecy prompted by shame and\nstigma. Moreover, voluntarily sharing medical data is widely\nencouraged by researchers and officials to promote public health and\nprecision medicine. As digital medical data technologies, mobile\nhealth care apps, telemedicine, public health surveillance, and brain\nimaging technologies expand, the range and complexity of important\nprivacy questions in medicine will also expand. \n",
