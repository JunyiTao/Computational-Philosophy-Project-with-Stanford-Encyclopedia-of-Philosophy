Larger Formations and Historical A Prioris: The Germanic and French Traditions\n\nWe pass now from the smaller-scale revolutions of Kuhn\u2019s later\nwork to large-scale movements that, in several cases, exceed the\nbounds of the early Kuhnian paradigms and the revolutionary\ntransformations linking them. Other thinkers have gone even further\nthan Kuhn, by positing the existence of cognitive formations that are\nboth broader and deeper than his. One prominent line of thought here\nis the neo-Kantian one up through Reichenbach and Carnap, discussed\nand further developed by Michael Friedman (2001, 2003). Another, not\nentirely distinct, idea is that of a thought style or discursive\nformation found variously in such writers as Ludwik Fleck (1935),\nAlistair Crombie (1994), Michel Foucault (1969), and Ian Hacking\n(1990, 2002, 2012). Especially in the accounts of Foucault and\nHacking, new conceptual spaces are constructed and may\n\u201ccrystallize\u201d (Hacking) rapidly. Once they become\ncanonical, they seem to be such obvious frameworks for making true or\nfalse claims that the corresponding categories of thought and action\nappear to be given as part of the nature of things, as\nwritten in the language of nature, so to speak, when they are in fact\na product of the cultural conditioning of our socio-cognitive systems.\nIn the limit we project our deeply ingrained cultural categories not\nonly onto our world as we encounter it but also onto all\n(historically) conceivable worlds. The historical change in question,\nonce called to our attention, seems revolutionary\u2014in a manner\nthat is both broader and deeper than the transition to a new paradigm\nwithin a particular scientific specialty. Once again, the magnitude of\nthe change is practically invisible to all but the most sensitive\narcheologist of knowledge. Feyerabend was alive to this perspective in\nhis work on Galileo. But, unlike his treatment of the Copernican\nRevolution (Kuhn 1957), Kuhn\u2019s revolutions in Structure\nand beyond are more limited in scope, typically occurring more or less\nwholly within a single discipline. Nor is it obvious that the\nemergence of a new thought style must overturn a distinct predecessor.\nOf course, we should not regard social constructionist /\ndeconstructionist projects (whether or not deliberately designed) as,\nautomatically, ongoing, enlightened processes that\n\u201cunfreeze\u201d the stones inherited from the past; for it was\nthese very processes that created essentialist constructions in the\nfirst place. The claim is that our constructions today are no\ndifferent.\n\nThe four main characteristics of Hacking\u2019s \u201cbig\nrevolutions\u201d are that they lead to whole new interdisciplinary\ncomplexes, replete with new social institutions and corresponding\nsocial changes, and they alter that period\u2019s overall take on, or\n\u201cfeel\u201d for, the universe. For critical discussion of\nHacking on styles of reasoning, see Kusch (2010) and Scortino (2016).\nFor more on Hacking, see section 5.3 below.\n",
