    "main_text": "The Nature of Logical Truth || Formality\n1.2 Formality\n\nOn most views, even if it were true that logical truths are true in\nall counterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic,\nthis would not give sufficient conditions for a truth to be a logical\ntruth. On most views, a logical truth also has to be in some sense\n\u201cformal\u201d, and this implies at least that all truths that\nare replacement instances of its form are logical truths too (and\nhence, on the assumption of the preceding sentence, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic). To use\na slight modification of an example of Albert of Saxony (quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a730.07), \u201cIf a widow runs, then a\nfemale runs\u201d should be true in all counterfactual circumstances,\na priori, and analytic if any truth is. However, \u201cIf a\nwidow runs, then a log runs\u201d is a replacement instance of its\nform, and in fact it even has the same form on any view of logical\nform (something like \u201cIf a \\(P\\) \\(Q\\)s, then an \\(R\\)\n\\(Q\\)s\u201d), but it is not even true simpliciter. So on\nmost views, \u201cIf a widow runs, then a female runs\u201d is not a\nlogical truth.\n\nFor philosophers who accept the idea of formality, as we said above,\nthe logical form of a sentence is a certain schema in which the\nexpressions that are not schematic letters are widely applicable\nacross different areas of\n discourse.[6]\n If the schema is the form of a logical truth, all of its replacement\ninstances are logical truths. The idea that logic is especially\nconcerned with (replacement instances of) schemata is of course\nevident beginning with Aristotle and the Stoics, in all of whom the\nword usually translated by \u201cfigure\u201d is precisely\nschema. In Aristotle a figure is actually an even more\nabstract form of a group of what we would now call\n\u201cschemata\u201d, such as (2\u2032). Our schemata are closer to\nwhat in the Aristotelian syllogistic are the moods; but there seems to\nbe no word for \u201cmood\u201d in Aristotle (except possibly\nptoseon in 42b30 or tropon in 43a10; see Smith 1989,\npp. 148\u20139), and thus no general reflection on the notion of\nformal schemata. There is explicit reflection on the contrast between\nthe formal schemata or moods and the matter (hyle) of\nsyllogismoi in Alexander of Aphrodisias (53.28ff., quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a724.06), and there has been ever since. The\nmatter are the values of the schematic letters.\n\nThe idea that the non-schematic expressions in logical forms, i.e. the\nlogical expressions, are widely applicable across different areas of\ndiscourse is also present from the beginning of logic, and recurs in\nall the great logicians. It appears indirectly in many passages from\nAristotle, such as the following: \u201cAll the sciences are related\nthrough the common things (I call common those which they use in order\nto demonstrate from them, but not those that are demonstrated in them\nor those about which something is demonstrated); and logic is related\nto them all, as it is a science that attempts to demonstrate\nuniversally the common things\u201d (Posterior Analytics,\n77a26\u20139); \u201cwe don't need to take hold of the things of all\nrefutations, but only of those that are characteristic of logic; for\nthese are common to every technique and ability\u201d\n(Sophistical Refutations, 170a34\u20135). (In these texts\n\u201clogic\u201d is an appropriate translation of\ndialektike; see Kneale and Kneale 1962, I, \u00a73, who\ninform us that logike is used for the first time with its\ncurrent meaning in Alexander of Aphrodisias.) Frege says that\n\u201cthe firmest proof is obviously the purely logical, which,\nprescinding from the particularity of things, is based solely on the\nlaws on which all knowledge rests\u201d (1879, p. 48; see also 1885,\nwhere the universal applicability of the arithmetical concepts is\ntaken as a sign of their logicality). The same idea is conspicuous as\nwell in Tarski (1941, ch. II, \u00a76).\n\nThat logical expressions include paradigmatic cases like\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc., and that they must be widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse is what we might call \u201cthe\nminimal thesis\u201d about logical expressions. But beyond this there\nis little if any agreement about what generic feature makes an\nexpression logical, and hence about what determines the logical form\nof a sentence. Most authors sympathetic to the idea that logic is\nformal have tried to go beyond the minimal thesis. It would be\ngenerally agreed that being widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is only a necessary, not sufficient property of logical\nexpressions; for example, presumably most prepositions are widely\napplicable, but they are not logical expressions on any implicit\ngeneric notion of a logical expression. Attempts to enrich the notion\nof a logical expression have typically sought to provide further\nproperties that collectively amount to necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an expression to be logical.\n\nOne idea that has been used in such characterizations, and that is\nalso present in Aristotle, is that logical expressions do not,\nstrictly speaking, signify anything; or, that they do not signify\nanything in the way that substantives, adjectives and verbs signify\nsomething. \u201cLogic [dialektike] is not a science of\ndetermined things, or of any one genus\u201d (Posterior\nAnalytics, 77a32\u20133). We saw that the idea was still present\nin Kant and the early Wittgenstein. It reemerged in the Middle Ages.\nThe main sense of the word \u201csyncategorematic\u201d as applied\nto expressions was roughly this semantic sense (see Kretzmann 1982,\npp. 212 ff.). Buridan and other late medieval logicians proposed that\ncategorematic expressions constitute the \u201cmatter\u201d of\nsentences while the syncategorematic expressions constitute their\n\u201cform\u201d (see the text quoted by Boche\u0144ski 1956,\n\u00a726.11). (In a somewhat different, earlier, grammatical sense of\nthe word, syncategorematic expressions were said to be those that\ncannot be used as subjects or predicates in categorical propositions;\nsee Kretzmann 1982, pp. 211\u20132.) The idea of syncategorematicity\nis somewhat imprecise, but there are serious doubts that it can serve\nto characterize the idea of a logical expression, whatever this may\nbe. Most prepositions and adverbs are presumably syncategorematic, but\nthey are also presumably non-logical expressions. Conversely,\npredicates such as \u201care identical\u201d, \u201cis identical\nwith itself\u201d, \u201cis both identical and not identical with\nitself\u201d, etc., which are resolutely treated as logical in recent\nlogic, are presumably categorematic. (They are of course categorematic\nin the grammatical sense, in which prepositions and adverbs are\nequally clearly syncategorematic.)\n\nMost other proposals have tried to delineate in some other way the\nAristotelian idea that the logical expressions have some kind of\n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d meaning, so as to use it as a necessary\nand sufficient condition for logicality. One recent suggestion is that\nlogical expressions are those that do not allow us to distinguish\ndifferent individuals. One way in which this has been made precise is\nthrough the characterization of logical expressions as those whose\nextension or denotation over any particular domain of individuals is\ninvariant under permutations of that domain. (See Tarski and Givant\n1987, p. 57, and Tarski 1966; for related proposals see also McCarthy\n1981, Sher 1991, ch. 3, McGee 1996, Feferman 1999, Bonnay 2008, Woods\n2016 and Griffiths and Paseau 2022, among others.) A permutation of a\ndomain is a one-to-one correspondence between the domain and itself.\nFor example, if \\(D\\) is the domain {Aristotle, Caesar, Napoleon,\nKripke}, one permutation is the correspondence that assigns each man\nto himself; another is the correspondence \\(P\\) that assigns Caesar to\nAristotle (in mathematical notation,\n\\(P(\\text{Aristotle})=\\text{Caesar}\\)), Napoleon to Caesar, Kripke to\nNapoleon, and Aristotle to Kripke. That the extension of an expression\nover a domain is invariant under a permutation of that domain means\nthat the induced image of that extension under the permutation is the\nextension itself (the \u201cinduced image\u201d of an extension\nunder a permutation \\(Q\\) is what the extension becomes when in place\nof each object \\(o\\) one puts the object \\(Q(o)\\)). The extension of\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d over \\(D\\) is not invariant under the\npermutation \\(P\\) above, for that extension is \\(\\{\\text{Aristotle},\n\\text{Kripke}\\}\\), whose induced image under \\(P\\) is\n\\(\\{\\text{Caesar}, \\text{Aristotle}\\}\\). This is favorable to the\nproposal, for \u201cphilosopher\u201d is certainly not widely\napplicable, and so non-logical on most views. On the other hand, the\npredicate \u201care identical\u201d has as its extension over \\(D\\)\nthe set of pairs \n\n\\(\\{ \\langle \\text{Aristotle, Aristotle} \\rangle, \\langle\n\\text{Caesar, Caesar} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{Napoleon, Napoleon}\n\\rangle, \\langle \\text{Kripke, Kripke} \\rangle\\};\\)\n\n\nits induced image under \\(P\\), and under any other permutation of\n\\(D\\), is that very same set of pairs (as the reader may check); so\nagain this is favorable to the proposal. (Other paradigmatic logical\nexpressions receive more complicated extensions over domains, but the\nextensions they receive are invariant under permutations. For example,\non one usual way of understanding the extension of \u201cand\u201d\nover a domain, this is the function that assigns, to each pair\n\\(\\langle S_1, S_2 \\rangle\\), where \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sets of\ninfinite sequences of objects drawn from \\(D\\), the intersection of\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\); and this function is permutation invariant.) One\nproblem with the proposal is that many expressions that seem clearly\nnon-logical, because they are not widely applicable, are nevertheless\ninvariant under permutations, and thus unable to distinguish different\nindividuals. The simplest examples are perhaps non-logical predicates\nthat have an empty extension over any domain, and hence have empty\ninduced images as well. \u201cMale widow\u201d is one example;\nversions of it can be used as counterexamples to the different\nversions of the idea of logicality as permutation invariance (see\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002), and it's unclear that the proponent of\nthe idea can avoid the problem in any non ad hoc way.\n\nAnother popular recent way of delineating the Aristotelian intuition\nof the semantic \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d of logical expressions\nappeals to the concept of \u201cpure inferentiality\u201d. The idea\nis that logical expressions are those whose meaning, in some sense, is\ngiven by \u201cpurely inferential\u201d rules. (See Kneale 1956,\nHacking 1979, Peacocke 1987, Hodes 2004, among others.) A necessary\nproperty of purely inferential rules is that they regulate only\ninferential transitions between verbal items, not between extra-verbal\nassertibility conditions and verbal items, or between verbal items and\nactions licensed by those items. A certain inferential rule licenses\nyou to say \u201cIt rains\u201d when it rains, but it's not\n\u201cpurely inferential\u201d. A rule that licenses you to say\n\u201cA is a female whose husband died before her\u201d when someone\nsays \u201cA is a widow\u201d, however, is not immediately\ndisqualified as purely inferential. Now, presumably in some sense the\nmeaning of \u201cwidow\u201d is given by this last rule together\nperhaps with the converse rule, that licenses you to say \u201cA is a\nwidow\u201d when someone says \u201cA is a female whose husband died\nbefore her\u201d. But \u201cwidow\u201d is not a logical\nexpression, since it's not widely applicable; so one needs to\npostulate more necessary properties that \u201cpurely\ninferential\u201d rules ought to satisfy. A number of such conditions\nare postulated in the relevant literature (see e.g. Belnap 1962 (a\nreply to Prior 1960), Hacking 1979 and Hodes 2004). However, even when\nthe notion of pure inferentiality is strengthened in these ways,\nproblems remain. Most often the proposal is that an expression is\nlogical just in case certain purely inferential rules give its whole\nmeaning, including its sense, or the set of aspects of its use that\nneed to be mastered in order to understand it (as in Kneale 1956,\nPeacocke 1987 and Hodes 2004). However, it seems clear that some\nparadigmatic logical expressions have extra sense attached to them\nthat is not codifiable purely inferentially. For example, inductive\nreasoning involving \u201call\u201d seems to be part of the sense of\nthis expression, but it's hard to see how it could be codified by\npurely inferential rules (as noted by Sainsbury 1991, pp. 316\u20137;\nsee also Dummett 1991, ch. 12). A different version of the proposal\nconsists in saying that an expression is logical just in case certain\npurely inferential rules that are part of its sense suffice to\ndetermine its extension (as in Hacking 1979). But it seems clear that\nif the extension of, say, \u201care identical\u201d is determined by\na certain set of purely inferential rules that are part of its sense,\nthen the extension of \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is equally determined by the same rules, which arguably\nform part of its sense; yet \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is not a logical expression (see G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2002).\n\nIn view of problems of these and other sorts, some philosophers have\nproposed that the concept of a logical expression is not associated\nwith necessary and sufficient conditions, but only with some necessary\ncondition related to the condition of wide applicability, such as the\ncondition of \u201cbeing very relevant for the systematization of\nscientific reasoning\u201d (see Warmbro\u0304d 1999 for a position of\nthis type). Others (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2021) have proposed that\nthere may be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, if these\nare not much related to the idea of semantic\n\u201cinsubstantiality\u201d and are instead pragmatic and suitably\nvague; for example, many expressions are excluded directly by the\ncondition of wide applicability; and prepositions are presumably\nexcluded by some such implicit condition as \u201ca logical\nexpression must be one whose study is useful for the resolution of\nsignificant problems and fallacies in reasoning\u201d. To be sure,\nthese proposals give up on the extended intuition of semantic\n\u201cinsubstantiality\u201d, and may be somewhat unsatisfactory for\nthat reason.\n\nSome philosophers have reacted even more radically to the problems of\nusual characterizations, claiming that the distinction between logical\nand non-logical expressions must be vacuous, and thus rejecting the\nnotion of logical form altogether. (See e.g. Orayen 1989, ch. 4,\n\u00a72.2; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 9; Read 1994; Priest 2001.) These\nphilosophers typically think of logical truth as a notion roughly\nequivalent to that of analytic truth simpliciter. But they\nare even more liable to the charge of giving up on extended intuitions\nthan the proposals of the previous paragraph.\n\nFor more thorough treatments of the ideas of formality and of a\nlogical expression see the entry\n logical constants,\n and MacFarlane 2000.\n",
