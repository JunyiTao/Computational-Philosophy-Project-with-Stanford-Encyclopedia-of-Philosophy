    "main_text": "Non-Transactional Theories || Necessity and Natural Duty\n5.2 Necessity and Natural Duty\n\nArguments based on necessity may be motivated by just that worry. On\nthis account, it is not enough that someone be able to help others\ntrack right reason, he must be able to do so within a certain domain.\nLocke thought the most urgent question for political philosophy was to\n\u201cdistinguish exactly the business of civil government\u201d\n(Locke 1689 [1983: 26]), to determine what things are properly\nCaesar\u2019s. Some contemporary writers take a related view.\nElizabeth Anscombe argues that the domain of authority is the domain\nof necessary social functions.\n\n\nIf something is necessary, if it is, for example, a necessary task in\nhuman life, then a right arises in those whose task it is, to have\nwhat belongs to the performance of the task. (Anscombe 1978: 17)\n\n\nBut what tasks are necessary? Some, as we have seen, point to the\nproduction of \u201cpresumptively beneficial public goods\u201d,\ngoods that anyone would want and which require social co-operation to\nproduce (Klosko 1991). Other views are more expansive. Finnis, for\nexample, believes that law must provide a comprehensive framework for\nrealizing a list of supposedly self-evident values including life,\nknowledge, play and religion (Finnis 1979: 81\u201397,\n154\u2013156). In between, we find a range of nuanced intermediate\npositions (see, for example, Copp 1999 and Perry 2012). An influential\nintermediate position ties political authority to the realm of justice\nand grounds obedience in a natural duty. According to John Rawls,\n\n\n[t]his duty requires us to support and comply with just institutions\nthat exist and apply to us. It also constrains us to further just\narrangements not yet established, at least when this can be done\nwithout too much cost to ourselves. (Rawls 1971: 115)\n\n\nThe basis of Rawls\u2019s theory in necessity becomes evident if we\nexplore what it might be for a just institution to \u201capply to\nus\u201d. An Institute for the Advancement of Philosophers\ncannot benefit us, however justly, and then demand that we pay its\ndues (Simmons 1979: 148). If so, it looks as if we need to accept the\nbenefits provided by a given institution before the institution in\nquestion can be said to \u201capply to us\u201d. But that is to\ntransform a natural duty account into a weakly voluntarist one like\nfairness (see above,\n \u00a74.2).\n One way to diagnose the force of such counterexamples is to notice\nthat, although operating justly, the Institute is\nnot something whose activities are required by justice: they\nare optional, not necessary (Waldron 1993).\n\nThis line of argument is one of the most popular in the contemporary\ndebate. Some have developed Rawls\u2019 somewhat vague idea of a duty\nto \u201csupport and comply with just institutions that exist and\napply to us\u201d by drawing on Kant\u2019s political philosophy,\nwhose central idea is that political authority is necessary to give\nconcrete content and shape to moral rights that are otherwise\nindeterminate in the state of nature (Christiano 2008; Ripstein 2009;\nStilz 2009). Others have drawn instead on Locke\u2019s political\nphilosophy, whose central idea is that even if fully determined rights\ndo exist in the state of nature, they cannot be adequately protected\nwithout authoritative mechanisms designed to adjudicate and punish\ntheir violations (Buchanan 2002; Wellman 2005). On either of these\nviews, we have a natural duty to leave the state of nature and enter\ncivil society in order to be able to live next to each other on\npeaceful terms, respecting each other\u2019s rights.\n\nThis duty is often conceived as a positive duty, for example as a duty\nto do our part in saving others from the dangers of the state of\nnature by supporting just institutions (Wellman 2005). But this view\nseems problematic if we accept that the dangers of the state of nature\nare primarily the product of a range of coordination problems which\nare generated by the fact that we live next to each other without\nbeing subject to the same political authority. These are not dangers\nthat we can save others from by subjecting ourselves to the political\nauthority; these are dangers that we expose others to if we live next\nto them without being subject to the political authority (Renzo 2008).\nIf so, the duty to support just institutions is best understood as\ngrounded in a negative duty not to threaten others, rather than in a\npositive one. Political authority is necessary to neutralize the\nthreat we pose to each other when we live in physical proximity while\nlacking mechanisms to set and enforce shared norms (Kant 1797; Renzo\n2011; but see Steinhoff 2016).\n\nThe main challenge for Natural Duty views is, once again, that\nit\u2019s unclear how we should make sense of the idea that certain\ninstitutions \u201capply to us\u201d. For even if we rule out just\ninstitutions whose activities are not required by justice (like\nSimmons\u2019 Institute for the Advancement of\nPhilosophers), we are still left with a large number of\ncandidates that, in principle, seem to have authority over us. At\nleast when we think about the political authority of states, we\nnormally think that the scope of the authority is limited to the\nindividuals living on the territory of each state (or individuals\nrelated in special ways to those living in their territory). And we\nnormally think that those individuals owe political obligations to\ntheir state in particular, obligations that they do not owe to other\nstates, regardless of how just they are. But how can we vindicate this\nidea, if what grounds political authority is our duty to support just\ninstitutions? Why couldn\u2019t we discharge this duty by obeying and\nsupporting some state other than the one which claims authority over\nthe territory where we live? (See Waldron 1993 for an influential\nanswer to this question; and Simmons 2005 for further criticism.)\n\nAnother challenge concerns a second component of Anscombe\u2019s\nclaim that\n\n\n[i]f something is necessary, if it is, for example, a necessary task\nin human life, then a right arises in those whose task it is, to have\nwhat belongs to the performance of the task.\n\n\nSuppose we have adequately answered the question of which tasks states\nought to be perform in order to perform their socially necessary\nfunctions. We then need to identify which rights they needed in order\nto be able to perform such tasks? Anscombe refers to the right to have\nwhat is necessary for the role, but what is that? Hume thought it\nobvious that political society could not exist without \u201cexact\nobedience of the magistrate\u201d but this is surely empiricism\nwithout the facts. Legal systems do tolerate a certain amount of\ndisobedience without this hampering their capacity to function (Green\n1988: 228\u2013230).\n",
