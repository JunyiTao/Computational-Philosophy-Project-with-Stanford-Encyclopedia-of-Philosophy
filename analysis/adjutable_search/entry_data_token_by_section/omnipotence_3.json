Omnipotence and the Shared Histories Approach\n\nThe alternative approach to analyzing omnipotence in terms of two\nworlds sharing their histories up to a time is exemplified by the\naccounts of Flint and Freddoso, and Wierenga. As we shall see,\nalthough these two accounts are similar, they differ in certain\nsignificant respects.\n\nFlint and Freddoso\u2019s account of what it is for an agent \\(S\\)\nat a time \\(t\\) to be omnipotent in a\npossible world \\(W\\) is formulated as follows.\n\n\n\\(S\\) is omnipotent at \\(t\\) in \\(W\\)\nif and only if for any state of affairs \\(p\\)\nand world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) such\nthat \\(p\\) is not a member of \\(Ls\\), if there is a\nworld \\(W^*\\) such that\n\n\\(Ls\\) is true in both \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\), and\n\\(W^*\\) shares the same history with \\(W\\) at \\(t\\),\nand\nat \\(t\\) in \\(W^*\\) someone actualizes \\(p\\),\nthen \\(S\\) has the power at \\(t\\)\nin \\(W\\) to actualize \\(p\\)\n(Flint & Freddoso 1983, p. 99).\n\n\n\nThe notion of a world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) is to be\nunderstood in the following way. A world-type is \u201ca set\nwhich is such that for any counterfactual of freedom, i.e.,\nany proposition which can be expressed by a sentence of the form\n\u2018If individual essence \\(P\\) were instantiated in\ncircumstances \\(C\\) at time \\(t\\) and\nits instantiation were left free with respect to action \\(A\\),\nthe instantiation of \\(P\\) would\nfreely do \\(A\\)\u2019\u2014either that counterfactual\nor its negation is a member of the set\u201d (Flint & Freddoso\n1983, p. 96). It may also be stipulated \u201cthat for any two\nmembers of the set, the conjunction of those two members is a member\nof the set as well\u201d (Flint & Freddoso 1983, pp.\n96\u201397). Moreover, \u201ca world-type is true just in\ncase every proposition which is a member of it is true\u201d (Flint\n& Freddoso 1983, p. 97). In addition, it is presupposed that\n\u201cfor any free agent \\(x\\), there will be a set of\nall and only those true counterfactuals of freedom (or true negations\nof such counterfactuals) over whose truth-value \\(x\\)\nhas no control\u201d (Flint & Freddoso 1983, p. 97). A set of\nthis kind is referred to as the world-type-for-x. Finally,\n\u2018\\(Lx\\)\u2019 designates the true-world-type-for-\\(x\\).\n\nThe notion of actualization employed in this account of omnipotence\ncalls for some explanation. If an agent, \\(S\\), brings\nabout a state of affairs, \\(p\\), then \\(S\\)\nactualizes \\(p\\). However, this\naccount presupposes that an agent may [weakly] actualize\nanother agent\u2019s making a free decision without\nbringing about or causing that decision. In\nparticular, it is assumed that an agent may weakly actualize a\ndecision that is free in the libertarian sense by bringing about the\nantecedent of a true \u201ccounterfactual of freedom.\u201d\n\nThe basic idea of this account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent just when he can actualize any state of affairs that it is\npossible for someone to actualize, except for certain\n\u201ccounterfactuals of freedom\u201d, their consequents, and\ncertain states of affairs that are \u201caccidentally\nimpossible\u201d because of the past.\n\nWith respect to so-called counterfactuals of freedom, this account\npresupposes that some of them, for example,\n\nIf Jessica were offered the grant, then she would freely decide to\naccept it,\n\nare true. Some philosophers hold the contrary view that a\nsubjunctive conditional of this kind is necessarily\nfalse. Why do these philosophers reject the claim that some\n\u201ccounterfactuals of freedom\u201d are true? Presumably, what\ndistinguishes a subjunctive conditional from a corresponding material\nconditional is that only the former expresses a strong or necessary\nconnection of some sort between the conditions specified by the\nantecedent and the consequent. Seemingly, the only kinds of strong or\nnecessary connections available in this case are relations [broadly\nspeaking] of either causation or entailment.\nConsequently, it appears that the subjunctive conditional under\ndiscussion is necessarily false, since if Jessica freely\ndecides to accept the grant [in the relevant libertarian sense], then\nher making that decision is neither caused nor\nentailed by her being offered the grant. If the foregoing\nline of reasoning is correct, then the notion of a true\n\u201ccounterfactual of freedom\u201d is incoherent. Since Flint and\nFreddoso\u2019s account of omnipotence presupposes that there are\nsuch \u201ccounterfactuals of freedom,\u201d it can be argued that\nthis account is incoherent.\n\nMoreover, it can be argued that a state of affairs discussed earlier\nprovides a counter-example to Flint and Freddoso\u2019s account of\nomnipotence, namely:\n\n(e)\nA snowflake falls\nand no omnipotent agent ever exists. \n\n\nA non-omnipotent agent can bring about or actualize (e) by bringing it\nabout that a snowflake falls when in fact no omnipotent agent ever\nexists. But, it is clear that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about\nor actualize (e). For although an omnipotent agent can bring it about\nthat a snowflake falls, surely, an omnipotent agent cannot bring it\nabout that no omnipotent ever exists, nor would this conjunct\nof (e) obtain if there were an omnipotent agent. Moreover, we may\nassume that there are possible worlds, \\(W\\) and\n\\(W^*\\), such that \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\) share the same\nhistory up to a time \\(t\\), no omnipotent agent ever\nexists in \\(W^*\\), and a contingently omnipotent agent, Oscar, is\nomnipotent for the first time at \\(t\\) in \\(W\\).\nWe may also assume that \\(W^*\\) is a world in which\nat \\(t\\) some non-omnipotent agent actualizes (e). On\nthe other hand, evidently, if in \\(W\\), Oscar is\nomnipotent at \\(t\\), then at \\(t\\) Oscar\ncannot actualize (e). Note that since the second conjunct of (e) is\nnot unrestrictedly repeatable, this is consistent with Hoffman and\nRosenkrantz\u2019s account of omnipotence; their account does not\nrequire an omnipotent agent to be able to bring about a conjunctive\nstate of affairs one of whose conjuncts is not unrestrictedly\nrepeatable. On the other hand, Flint and Freddoso\u2019s account of\nomnipotence implies that in \\(W\\), at \\(t\\)\nOscar has the power to actualize (e). This\nimplication holds for the following reasons. First, (e) is not a\nmember of a world-type-for-Oscar, inasmuch as (e) is neither a\n\u201ccounterfactual of freedom,\u201d the negation of one, nor a\nconjunction of such \u201ccounterfactuals of freedom.\u201d Second,\nwe may assume that a world-type-for-Oscar is true in both \\(W^*\\) and\n\\(W\\), since the assumption that an agent is not\nomnipotent in one possible world, and is omnipotent for a time in\nanother possible world, does not necessitate any difference in the\nworld-type for that agent which is true in those worlds. Third, it is\npossible for someone at \\(t\\) to actualize (e) in a\nworld, \\(W^*\\), that has the same history up to \\(t\\)\nas W.[5]\n Thus, arguably, Flint and Freddoso\u2019s account of omnipotence\nrequires that in \\(W\\) an omnipotent agent, Oscar, at\n\\(t\\) has the power to actualize (e), when Oscar lacks\nthis power. If this is right, then their account does not provide a\nlogically necessary condition on\n omnipotence.[6]\n\nA counter-example of this kind assumes that an analysis of omnipotence\nshould allow for the possibility of an omnipotent agent other than\nGod. Given this assumption, (e) seems to provide a counter-example to\nFlint and Freddoso\u2019s account of omnipotence, but not to the\naccount of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz.\n\nLet us now turn to Wierenga\u2019s account of omnipotence. The basic\nidea of Wierenga\u2019s account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent if and only if he can do anything that it is possible for\nhim to do, given the past. According to this account, we can analyze\nwhat it is for an agent, \\(A\\), to be omnipotent at \\(t\\)\nin a world \\(W\\) in terms of what it\nis possible for A to strongly actualize at \\(t\\)\nin worlds having the same history as \\(W\\)\nup to \\(t\\).\n\nWierenga\u2019s account of omnipotence, like Flint and\nFreddoso\u2019s, relies on the intuitive idea that two possible\nworlds can share the same past or history up to a certain point in\ntime, and then diverge. According to Wierenga\u2019s account, two\nworlds of this kind share an initial segment, where \\(S (W,\nt)\\) is an initial segment of a possible world \\(W\\) up\nto a time \\(t\\) (Wierenga 1989, pp. 18\u201320).\nUnlike Flint and Freddoso\u2019s account, Wierenga\u2019s account is\nnot stated in terms of what an agent can actualize, but rather in\nterms of the narrower notion of what an agent can strongly\nactualize. An agent, \\(A\\), strongly actualizes\njust those states of affairs that \\(A\\) brings about\ndirectly or those actions that \\(A\\) does not\ndo by doing something else (Wierenga 1989, pp. 20\u201323).\nOf course, an agent may actualize a state of affairs\nindirectly by strongly actualizing another state of\naffairs. Wierenga\u2019s account of omnipotence is formulated as\nfollows.\n\nA being \\(x\\) is omnipotent in a world \\(W\\)\nat a time \\(t =_{df}\\) In \\(W\\) it is\ntrue both that (i) for every state of affairs \\(A\\), if\nit is possible that both \\(S (W, t)\\) obtains and that \\(x\\)\nstrongly actualizes \\(A\\) at \\(t\\),\nthen at \\(t, x\\) can strongly actualize \\(A\\),\nand (ii) there is some state of affairs which \\(x\\)\ncan strongly actualize at \\(t\\).\n(Wierenga 1989, p. 25)\n\n\nThis account of omnipotence may be vulnerable to a counter-example of\nthe following kind. Arguably, there could be an agent, \\(x\\),\nsuch that: \\(x\\) has a wide range of\npowers, \\(x\\) is essentially limited to these powers,\nand \\(x\\) essentially lacks a power, \\(P\\),\nwhich an omnipotent agent ought to possess. Of\ncourse, \\(x\\) would not be omnipotent. Yet,\nWierenga\u2019s account of omnipotence paradoxically implies that \\(x\\)\nwould be omnipotent. Hence, it can be argued that\nWierenga\u2019s account does not provide a logically sufficient\ncondition for omnipotence. The assumption that there could be a\nnon-omnipotent agent that is essentially limited in its powers can be\ndefended as follows. An omnipotent agent has the power to overrule (or\nsupersede) any law of nature (a mere physical necessity). For\nexample, God has the power to overrule the law of gravity by bringing\nit about that a mountain floats in midair without any physical cause.\nYet, arguably, it is possible for there to be a non-omnipotent agent\nwho essentially lacks the power to overrule any law of nature. For\nexample, it can be argued that there could be a physical or material\nagent who is essentially subject to certain laws of nature.\nSurely, such an agent would lack the power to overrule any law of\nnature, and so would not be omnipotent.\n\nA similar, though weaker, sort of objection concerns McEar, a\nhypothetical agent who essentially has the power to do only\none thing, namely, scratch his ear. It may be objected that\nWierenga\u2019s analysis of omnipotence falsely implies that McEar\nwould be omnipotent. But it might be replied that an agent such as\nMcEar is impossible. It can be cogently argued that, necessarily, if\nMcEar has the power to scratch his ear, then he also has the\npower to move a part of his body to scratch his ear, for instance, his\narm (Wierenga 1989, pp. 28\u201329). So, it appears that there could\nnot be an agent that has the power to do only one thing. In reply to\nthe stronger sort of objection discussed earlier, it may be suggested\nthat, necessarily, for any power, if an agent lacks that\npower, then an omnipotent being could give that agent that power\n(Wierenga 1989, p. 29). The difficulty with such a reply is that there\ncould be a non-omnipotent agent who essentially lacks the\npower to overrule any law of nature, and hence that not even an\nomnipotent agent could give this non-omnipotent agent that power.\n",
