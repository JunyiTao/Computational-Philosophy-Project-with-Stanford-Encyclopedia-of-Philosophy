    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nAs has been frequently noted, the ancient Greeks did not have terms or\nconcepts that correspond to the contemporary dichotomy of\n\u2018heterosexual\u2019 and \u2018homosexual\u2019 (e.g.,\nFoucault, 1980). There is a wealth of material from ancient Greece\npertinent to issues of sexuality, ranging from dialogues of Plato,\nsuch as the Symposium, to plays by Aristophanes, and Greek\nartwork and vases. What follows is a brief description of ancient\nGreek attitudes, but it is important to recognize that there was\nregional variation. For example, in parts of Ionia there were general\nstrictures against same-sex eros, while in Elis and Boiotia\n(e.g., Thebes), it was approved of and even celebrated (cf. Dover,\n1989; Halperin, 1990).\n\nProbably the most frequent assumption about sexual orientation, at\nleast by ancient Greek authors, is that persons can respond erotically\nto beauty in either sex. Diogenes Laeurtius, for example, wrote of\nAlcibiades, the Athenian general and politician of the 5th\ncentury B.C., \u201cin his adolescence he drew away the husbands from\ntheir wives, and as a young man the wives from their husbands.\u201d\n(Quoted in Greenberg, 1988, 144) Some persons were noted for their\nexclusive interests in persons of one gender. For example, Alexander\nthe Great and the founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium, were known for\ntheir exclusive interest in boys and other men. Such persons, however,\nare generally portrayed as the exception. Furthermore, the issue of\nwhat biological sex one is attracted to is seen as an issue of taste\nor preference, rather than as a moral issue. A character in\nPlutarch\u2019s Erotikos (Dialogue on Love) argues\nthat \u201cthe noble lover of beauty engages in love wherever he sees\nexcellence and splendid natural endowment without regard for any\ndifference in physiological detail\u201d (ibid., 146).\nGender just becomes irrelevant \u201cdetail\u201d and instead the\nexcellence in character and beauty is what is most important.\n\nEven though the gender that one was erotically attracted to (at any\nspecific time, given the assumption that persons will likely be\nattracted to persons of both sexes) was not important, other issues\nwere salient, such as whether one exercised moderation. Status\nconcerns were also of the highest importance. Given that only free men\nhad full status, women and male slaves were not problematic sexual\npartners. Sex between freemen, however, was problematic for status.\nThe central distinction in ancient Greek sexual relations was between\ntaking an active or insertive role, versus a passive or penetrated\none. The passive role was acceptable only for inferiors, such as\nwomen, slaves, or male youths who were not yet citizens. Hence the\ncultural ideal of a same-sex relationship was between an older man,\nprobably in his 20s or 30s, known as the erastes, and a boy\nwhose beard had not yet begun to grow, the eromenos or\npaidika. In this relationship there was courtship ritual,\ninvolving gifts (such as a rooster), and other norms. The\nerastes had to show that he had nobler interests in the boy,\nrather than a purely sexual concern. The boy was not to submit too\neasily, and if pursued by more than one man, was to show discretion\nand pick the more noble one. There is also evidence that penetration\nwas often avoided by having the erastes face his beloved and\nplace his penis between the thighs of the eromenos, which is\nknown as intercrural sex. The relationship was to be temporary and\nshould end upon the boy reaching adulthood (Dover, 1989). To continue\nin a submissive role even while one should be an equal citizen was\nconsidered troubling, although there certainly were many adult male\nsame-sex relationships that were noted and not strongly stigmatized.\nWhile the passive role was thus seen as problematic, to be attracted\nto men was often taken as a sign of masculinity. Greek gods, such as\nZeus, had stories of same-sex exploits attributed to them, as did\nother key figures in Greek myth and literature, such as Achilles and\nHercules. Plato, in the Symposium, argues for an army to be\ncomprised of same-sex lovers. Thebes did form such a regiment, the\nSacred Band of Thebes, formed of 500 soldiers. They were renowned in\nthe ancient world for their valor in battle.\n\nAncient Rome had many parallels to ancient Greece in its understanding\nof same-sex attraction, and sexual issues more generally. This is\nespecially true under the Republic. Yet under the Empire, Roman\nsociety slowly became more negative in its views towards sexuality,\nprobably due to social and economic turmoil, even before Christianity\nbecame influential.\n\nExactly what attitude the New Testament has towards sexuality in\ngeneral, and same-sex attraction in particular, is a matter of sharp\ndebate. John Boswell argues, in his fascinating Christianity,\nSocial Tolerance, and Homosexuality, that many passages taken\ntoday as condemnations of homosexuality are more concerned with\nprostitution, or where same-sex acts are described as\n\u201cunnatural\u201d the meaning is more akin to \u2018out of the\nordinary\u2019 rather than as immoral (Boswell, 1980, ch.4; see also\nBoswell, 1994). Yet others have criticized, sometimes persuasively,\nBoswell\u2019s scholarship, arguing that the conventional\ncontemporary reading is more plausible (see Greenberg, 1988, ch.5).\nWhat is clear, however, is that while condemnation of same-sex\nattraction is marginal to the Gospels and only an intermittent focus\nin the rest of the New Testament, early Christian church fathers were\nmuch more outspoken. In their writings there is a horror at any sort\nof sex, but in a few generations these views eased, in part due no\ndoubt to practical concerns of recruiting converts. By the fourth and\nfifth centuries the mainstream Christian view allowed only for\nprocreative sex.\n\nThis viewpoint, that procreative sex within marriage is allowed, while\nevery other expression of sexuality is sinful, can be found, for\nexample, in St. Augustine. This understanding of permissible sexual\nrelationships leads to a concern with the gender of one\u2019s\npartner that is not found in previous Greek or Roman views, and it\nclearly forbids homosexual acts. Soon this attitude, especially\ntowards homosexual sex, came to be reflected in Roman Law. In\nJustinian\u2019s Code, promulgated in 529, persons who engaged in\nhomosexual sex were to be executed, although those who were repentant\ncould be spared. Historians agree that the late Roman Empire saw a\nrise in intolerance towards homosexuality, although there were again\nimportant regional variations.\n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, and its replacement by various\nbarbarian kingdoms, a general tolerance (with the sole exception of\nVisigothic Spain) for homosexual acts prevailed. As one prominent\nscholar puts it, \u201cEuropean secular law contained few measures\nagainst homosexuality until the middle of the thirteenth\ncentury.\u201d (Greenberg, 1988, 260) Even while some Christian\ntheologians continued to denounce nonprocreative sexuality, including\nsame-sex acts, a genre of homophilic literature, especially among the\nclergy, developed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Boswell,\n1980, chapters 8 and 9).\n\nThe latter part of the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries,\nhowever, saw a sharp rise in intolerance towards homosexual sex,\nalongside persecution of Jews, Muslims, heretics, and others. While\nthe causes of this are somewhat unclear, it is likely that increased\nclass conflict alongside the Gregorian reform movement in the Catholic\nChurch were two important factors. The Church itself started to appeal\nto a conception of \u201cnature\u201d as the standard of morality,\nand drew it in such a way so as to forbid homosexual sex (as well as\nextramarital sex, nonprocreative sex within marriage, and often\nmasturbation). For example, the first ecumenical council to condemn\nhomosexual sex, Lateran III of 1179, stated \u201cWhoever shall be\nfound to have committed that incontinence which is against\nnature\u201d shall be punished, the severity of which depended upon\nwhether the transgressor was a cleric or layperson (quoted in Boswell,\n1980, 277). This appeal to natural law (discussed below) became very\ninfluential in the Western tradition. An important point to note,\nhowever, is that the key category here is the \u2018sodomite,\u2019\nwhich differs from the contemporary idea of \u2018homosexual\u2019.\nA sodomite was understood as act-defined, rather than as a type of\nperson. Someone who had desires to engage in sodomy, yet did not act\nupon them, was not a sodomite. Also, persons who engaged in\nheterosexual sodomy were also sodomites. There are reports of persons\nbeing burned to death or beheaded for sodomy with a spouse (Greenberg,\n1988, 277). Finally, a person who had engaged in sodomy, yet who had\nrepented of his sin and vowed to never do it again, was no longer a\nsodomite. The gender of one\u2019s partner is again not of decisive\nimportance, although some medieval theologians single out same-sex\nsodomy as the worst type of sexual crime (Crompton, 2003, ch.6).\n\nFor the next several centuries in Europe, the laws against homosexual\nsex were severe in their penalties. Enforcement, however, was\nepisodic. In some regions, decades would pass without any\nprosecutions. Yet the Dutch, in the 1730s, mounted a harsh anti-sodomy\ncampaign (alongside an anti-Roma pogrom), even using torture to\nobtain confessions. As many as one hundred men and boys were executed\nand denied burial (Greenberg, 1988, 313\u20134). Also, the degree to\nwhich sodomy and same-sex attraction were accepted varied by class,\nwith the middle class taking the most restrictive view, while the\naristocracy and nobility often accepted public expressions of\nalternative sexualities. At times, even with the risk of severe\npunishment, same-sex oriented subcultures would flourish in cities,\nsometimes only to be suppressed by the authorities. In the\n19th century there was a significant reduction in the legal\npenalties for sodomy. The Napoleonic code decriminalized sodomy, and\nwith Napoleon\u2019s conquests that Code spread. Furthermore, in many\ncountries where homosexual sex remained a crime, the general movement\nat this time away from the death penalty usually meant that sodomy was\nremoved from the list of capital offenses.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries an overtly\ntheological framework no longer dominated the discourse about same-sex\nattraction. Instead, secular arguments and interpretations became\nincreasingly common. Probably the most important secular domain for\ndiscussions of homosexuality was in medicine, including psychology.\nThis discourse, in turn, linked up with considerations about the state\nand its need for a growing population, good soldiers, and intact\nfamilies marked by clearly defined gender roles. Doctors were called\nin by courts to examine sex crime defendants (Foucault, 1980;\nGreenberg, 1988). At the same time, the dramatic increase in school\nattendance rates and the average length of time spent in school,\nreduced transgenerational contact, and hence also the frequency of\ntransgenerational sex. Same-sex relations between persons of roughly\nthe same age became the norm.\n\nClearly the rise in the prestige of medicine resulted in part from the\nincreasing ability of science to account for natural phenomena on the\nbasis of mechanistic causation. The application of this viewpoint to\nhumans led to accounts of sexuality as innate or biologically driven.\nThe voluntarism of the medieval understanding of sodomy, that\nsodomites chose sin, gave way to the prevailing though contested\nmodern notion of homosexuality as a deep, unchosen characteristic of\npersons, regardless of whether they act upon that orientation. The\nidea of a \u2018latent sodomite\u2019 would not have made sense, yet\nunder this new view it does make sense to speak of a person as a\n\u2018latent homosexual.\u2019 Instead of specific acts defining a\nperson, as in the medieval view, an entire physical and mental makeup,\nusually portrayed as somehow defective or pathological, is ascribed to\nthe modern category of \u2018homosexual.\u2019 Although there are\nhistorical precursors to these ideas (e.g., Aristotle gave a\nphysiological explanation of passive homosexuality), medicine gave\nthem greater public exposure and credibility (Greenberg, 1988, ch.15).\nThe effects of these ideas cut in conflicting ways. Since\nhomosexuality is, by this view, not chosen, it makes less sense to\ncriminalize it. Persons are not choosing evil acts. Yet persons may be\nexpressing a diseased or pathological mental state, and hence medical\nintervention for a cure is appropriate. Hence doctors, especially\npsychiatrists, campaigned for the repeal or reduction of criminal\npenalties for consensual homosexual sodomy, yet intervened to\n\u201crehabilitate\u201d homosexuals. They also sought to develop\ntechniques to prevent children from becoming homosexual, for example\nby arguing that childhood masturbation caused homosexuality, hence it\nmust be closely guarded against.\n\nIn the 20th century sexual roles were redefined once again.\nFor a variety of reasons, premarital intercourse slowly became more\ncommon and eventually acceptable. With the decline of prohibitions\nagainst sex for the sake of pleasure even outside of marriage, it\nbecame more difficult to argue against gay sex. These trends were\nespecially strong in the 1960s, and it was in this context that the\ngay liberation movement took off. Although gay and lesbian rights\ngroups had been around for decades, the low-key approach of the\nMattachine Society (named after a medieval secret society) and the\nDaughters of Bilitis had not gained much ground. This changed in the\nearly morning hours of June 28, 1969, when the patrons of the\nStonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, rioted after a police\nraid. In the aftermath of that event, gay and lesbian groups began to\norganize around the country. Gay Democratic clubs were created in\nevery major city, and one fourth of all college campuses had gay and\nlesbian groups (Shilts, 1993, ch.28). Large gay urban communities in\ncities from coast to coast became the norm. The American Psychiatric\nAssociation removed homosexuality from its official listing of mental\ndisorders. The increased visibility of gays and lesbians has become a\npermanent feature of American life despite the two critical setbacks\nof the AIDS epidemic and an anti-gay backlash (see Berman, 1993, for a\ngood survey). The post-Stonewall era has also seen marked changes in\nWestern Europe, where the repeal of anti-sodomy laws and legal\nequality for gays and lesbians has become common. In the 21st century,\nthe legal recognition of same-sex marriage has become widespread.\n\nThe increasing acceptance of same-sex relations has prompted new\ntheoretical debates, such as whether a \u201cpost-gay\u201d culture\nwill emerge due to widespread assimilation of gays and lesbians\n(Anderson, 2016). Generally what is meant by the term\n\u201cpost-gay\u201d is that if LGBTQ persons have full legal and\nsocial equality, that level of acceptance makes it so sexual\norientation is no longer a defining aspect of one\u2019s identity or\nsocial position. While it seems unlikely that gay, lesbian, or queer\npersons of color, or who live in rural areas, or are otherwise in a\nmarginalized position will achieve such assimilation in the\nforeseeable future, the debate is still of theoretical interest. For\ninstance, post-gay can be conceptualized as either a specific\npolitical order, characterized by equality across sexual orientations,\nor it can be seen as a specific type of identity, where persons\nunderstand and accept themselves as same-sex oriented but as not in\nany way defined by that. Post-gay can also be a time, an era marked by\nwidespread assimilation, or a space, where persons are fully treated\nas equals. Some regard the variety of meanings given to the term as\nevidence of confusion (Kampler and Connell, 2018). A better\nunderstanding, however, is that the term is being used to rival ends.\nFor some, post-gay marks the culmination of the gay rights movement,\nwhich all along, they contend, was an effort to be treated as equals.\nFor others, it opens a space where sexual labels can be resisted,\nrenegotiated, and made fluid and non-binary (Coleman-Fountain,\n2014).\n",
