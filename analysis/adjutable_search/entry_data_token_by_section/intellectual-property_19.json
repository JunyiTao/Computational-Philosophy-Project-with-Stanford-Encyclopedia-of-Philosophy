    "main_text": "General Critiques of Intellectual Property || The Social Nature of Information Argument\n4.4 The Social Nature of Information Argument\n\nAccording to this view, information is a social product and enforcing\naccess restrictions unduly benefits authors and inventors. Individuals\nare raised in societies that endow them with knowledge which these\nindividuals then use to create intellectual works of all kinds. On\nthis view the building blocks of intellectual\nworks\u2014knowledge\u2014is a social product. Individuals should\nnot have exclusive and perpetual ownership of the works that they\ncreate because these works are built upon the shared knowledge of\nsociety. Allowing rights to intellectual works would be similar to\ngranting ownership to the individual who placed the last brick in a\npublic works dam. The dam is a social product, built up by the efforts\nof hundreds, and knowledge, upon which all intellectual works are\nbuilt, is built up in a similar fashion (Proudhon 1840; Grant 1987;\nShapiro 1991; Simmons 1992, Boyle 1997).\n\nBeyond challenging whether the notion of \u201csociety\u201d\nemployed in this view is clear enough to carry the weight that the\nargument demands, critics have questioned the view that societies can\nbe owed something or that they can own or\ndeserve something (Spooner 1855; Nozick 1974; Moore\n2012). Lysander Spooner writes:\n\n\u201cWhat rights society has, in ideas, which they did not\nproduce, and have never purchased, it would probably be very difficult\nto define; and equally difficult to explain how society\nbecame possessed of those rights. It certainly requires something more\nthan assertion, to prove that by simply coming to a knowledge of\ncertain ideas\u2014the products of individual labor\u2014society\nacquires any valid title to them, or, consequently, any\nrights in them\u201d (Spooner 1855).\n\n\nThe problem of how individuals acquire property rights (personality,\nutilitarian, Lockean, etc.) now applies to how societies obtain these\nrights. \n\nMoore charges that defenders of the social nature argument against\nintellectual property fail to see that it may prove too much.\n\nBut like the defender of the first cause argument for the existence of\nGod who rides the principle of sufficient causation to a certain point\nand then conveniently abandons it (every event or object needs a\nsufficient cause and nothing is self-caused except God) the\nproponent of the \u201cshared culture\u201d view is guilty of a\nsimilar trick. \u201cShared culture\u201d or the social nature of\nintellectual property view is sufficient for undermining intellectual\nproperty rights or robust control of intellectual works, but\nconveniently not strong enough to undermine student desert for a\ngrade, criminal punishment, or other sorts of moral evaluation (Moore\n2012).\n\n\nFinally, even if a defender of this view can justify societal\nownership of general pools of knowledge and information, it could be\nargued that we have already paid for the use of this collective wisdom\nwhen we pay for education and the like.\n",
