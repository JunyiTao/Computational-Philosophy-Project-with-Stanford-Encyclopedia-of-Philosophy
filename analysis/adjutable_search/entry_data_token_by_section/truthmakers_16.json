    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || Truth-making and Conceptual Explanation\n3.6 Truth Making and Quantification\n\nA final supporting suggestion: that the grand truth-maker projects of\nthe late twentieth century arose (partly) out of a failure to\nappreciate the logical variety of natural language quantifiers that we\nunreflectively employ when expressing the intuitions that speak in\nfavour of truth- makers.\n\nConsider how Armstrong expressed himself when he started out: \n\n\nIt seems obvious that for every true contingent proposition there must\nbe something in the world (in the largest sense of\n\u201csomething\u201d) which makes the proposition true. For\nconsider any true contingent proposition and imagine that it is false.\nWe must automatically imagine some difference in the world. (Armstrong\n1973: 11) \n\n\nBigelow asks us to compare two worlds, one in which A is\ntrue, the other in which it is false. According to Bigelow, \n\n\nThere must surely be some difference between these two possible\nworlds! They are clearly different in that A is true in one\nbut not the other. So there must be something in one of these worlds\nwhich is lacking in the other and which accounts for the difference in\ntruth. (1988: 126) \n\n\nArmstrong and Bigelow make the same assumption about the\n\u201csome\u201d they employ in their expression of what makes the\ndifference between the world in which A is true and the world\nin which A is false; they assume it is an objectual\nquantifier in name position.\n\nWith this assumption in place it is an easy move to make to think that\nthere must be some thing that we quantify over that\nconstitutes the difference between these circumstances,\nviz. the truth-maker for A. But as Williamson\nremarks \u201cWe should not assume that all quantification is either\nobjectual or substitutional\u201d (1999: 262\u20133; cf.\nPrior 1971: 31\u20134). Williamson argues that that the truth maker\nprinciple in fact \n\n\ninvolves irreducible non-substitutional quantification into sentence\nposition\u2026 We should not even assume that all non-substitutional\nquantification is interpreted in terms of assignments of values to the\nvariables. For \u201cvalue\u201d is a noun, not a sentence. (1999:\n263)\n\n\nBut suppose the \u201csome\u201d Armstrong and Bigelow employ is\nunderstood not as an objectual quantifier that comes equipped with a\ndomain of entities over which it ranges but is understood in some\nother way. Then it would be open to us to acknowledge the force of\nArmstrong and Bigelow\u2019s intuition that the circumstances in\nwhich A is true are somehow different from those in which it\nisn\u2019t, but without our having to think that there exists\nsomething that we\u2019ve quantified over than makes it so. Evidently\nit will not be until we have arrived at a settled view of the\nadmissible interpretations our quantifiers may bear that this issue\ncan be settled in a principled rather than dogmatic manner.\n",
