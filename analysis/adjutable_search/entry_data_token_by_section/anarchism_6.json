Anarchism in Political Philosophy\n\nAnarchism in political philosophy maintains that there is no\nlegitimate political or governmental authority. In political\nphilosophy anarchy is an important topic for consideration\u2014even\nfor those who are not anarchists\u2014as the a-political background\ncondition against which various forms of political organization are\narrayed, compared, and justified. Anarchy is often viewed by\nnon-anarchists as the unhappy or unstable condition in which there is\nno legitimate authority. Anarchism as a philosophical idea is not\nnecessarily connected to practical activism. There are political\nanarchists who take action in order to destroy what they see as\nillegitimate states. The popular imagination often views anarchists as\nbomb-throwing nihilists. But philosophical anarchism is a theoretical\nstandpoint. In order to decide who (and whether) one should act upon\nanarchist insight, we require a further theory of political action,\nobligation, and obedience grounded in further ethical reflection.\nSimmons explains that philosophical anarchists \u201cdo not take the\nillegitimacy of states to entail a strong moral imperative to oppose\nor eliminate states\u201d (Simmons 2001: 104). Some anarchists remain\nobedient to ruling authorities; others revolt or resist in various\nways. The question of action depends upon a theory of what sort of\npolitical obligation follows from our philosophical, moral, political,\nreligious, and aesthetic commitments.\n",
