    "main_text": "The Syntactic View || Taking Stock: Syntactic View\n2.4 Taking Stock: Syntactic View\n\nTo summarize, the Syntactic View holds that there are three kinds of\nterms or vocabularies: logical, theoretical, and observational; three\nkinds of sentences: \\(T_S\\), \\(C_S\\), and \\(O_S\\); and two languages:\n\\(L_T\\) and \\(L_O\\). Moreover, the structure of scientific theories\ncould be analyzed using the logical tools of metamathematics. The goal\nis to reconstruct the logic of science, viz. to articulate an\naxiomatic system.\n\nInterestingly, this perspective has able and active defenders today,\nwho discuss constitutive and axiomatized principles of the historical\n\u201crelativized a priori\u201d (Friedman 2001, cf. 2013), argue\nthat \u201cthe semantic view, if plausible, is syntactic\u201d\n(Halvorson 2013), and explore \u201clogicism\u201d for, and in, the\nphilosophy of science (Demopulous 2003, 2013; van Benthem 2012).\nFurthermore, for purposes of the syntactic reconstruction of\nscientific theories, some continue espousing\u2014or perhaps plea for\nthe resurrection of\u2014predicate logic (e.g., Lutz 2012, 2014),\nwhile other contemporary syntacticists (e.g., Halvorson 2012, 2013,\n2019) endorse more recently developed metamathematical and\nmathematical equipment, such as category theory, which \u201cturns\nout to be a kind of universal mathematical language like set\ntheory\u201d (Awodey 2006, 2; see Eilenberg and MacLane 1945).\nImportantly, Halvorson (2019) urges that interlocutors adopt\n\u201cstructured\u201d rather than \u201cflat\u201d views of\ntheories. For the case of the syntactic view this would mean that\nrather than accept the usual formulation that a theory is a\nset of sentences, \u201c\u2026 [we] might say that a\ntheory consists of both sentences and inferential relations between\nthose sentences\u201d (Halvorson 2019, 277\u20138). Classical\nsyntacticists such as Rudolf Carnap (Friedman 1999, 2011; Carus 2007;\nBlatti and Lapointe 2016; Koellner ms. in Other Internet Resources)\nand Joseph Henry Woodger (Nicholson and Gawne 2014) have recently\nreceived increasing attention.\n",
