    "main_text": "The Unity and Development of Nishida\u2019s Philosophy || The Attempt to Unify the Varying Themes\n8.1 The Attempt to Unify the Varying Themes\n\n\nA grasp of both the unity and the development of Nishida\u2019s thought is\nalso crucial to understanding it. As should be obvious, Nishida\u2019s\nthought underwent extensive changes over the course of four\ndecades. Less evident is that the varying themes are united by a\ndeepening of the same basic insights. The Preface to the third volume\nof his Philosophical Essays published in 1939 gives us his\nown view of the unity of his progression: \u201cIt is said that that\nI repeatedly discuss the same problems, and [indeed] from An\nInquiry into the Good on, my objective has been to see things and\nthink things from the most direct and fundamental standpoint\u2014to\ngrasp all things from the standpoint of whence they come and whither\nthey go\u201d (NKZ IX, 3). A Preface written three years earlier to\nthe reprint of An Inquiry into the Good identifies some of\nthe crucial connections in the changing thematic: the standpoint of\npure experience articulated in that maiden work developed into that of\nabsolute will, and later into the notion of place or topos,\nconcretized further as a dialectical universal, which in turn gets\nexpressed as action-intuition. \u201cThat which I called...the\nworld of pure experience I have now come to think of as the world of\nhistorical reality. The world of enactive intuition\u2014the world of\npoiesis\u2014is none other than the world of pure experience\u201d\n(Nishida 1990, xxxiii).\n\n\nSince Nishida composed his essays in a language and for a culture that\nhad known philosophy as a distinct discipline for little more than\nhalf a century, his view of that discipline is equally crucial for\nunderstanding the unity and progression of his thought. Although his\nview likewise evolved over the course of his life, it reveals one\nabiding feature: philosophy should be not only the articulation but\nalso the awareness of the most fundamental unities of experience,\nknowledge, action, and ultimately self and world.\n\n\nRelatively early in\nhis career, when he was still under the sway of Fichte, the\nNeo-Kantians, and Bergson, he defined philosophy as science\n[gakumon], i.e. unified conceptual knowledge, more\nspecifically the first and universal science that \u201creflects on\nthe basic concepts of the particular sciences in general and\nconstructs of them one system of knowledge.\u201d Yet \u201cits\nobject of study is not simply the fundamental concepts of\nreality. Basic normative notions such as truth, goodness and beauty\nmust of course enter into philosophical study. Philosophy not only\nclarifies basic notions of reality, but must also elucidate the ideals\nof human life, the \u2018ought\u2019 itself. Philosophy is not\nsimply a worldview; it is a view of human life.\u201d Within his\nextended definition Nishida, commenting on Bergson, clarifies the role\nof intuition so crucial to his own thought: \u201c\u2018intuition\u2019 as\nsuch cannot be called philosophy. Even if its contents can derive from\nintuition, philosophy has its raison d\u2019\u00eatre when intuition takes\nthe form of conceptual knowledge.\u201d (NKZ 13, 254).\n\n\nThen, later in his career, Nishida paradoxically formed concepts of the\nlimits of such knowledge and formulated his philosophy of absolute\nnothingness that is ultimately mirrored in self-awareness. Such\nawareness became a task for philosophy or, more specifically, for the\nphilosopher. Throughout his life Nishida\u2019s own practice of philosophy\nattempted to realize an abiding insight expressed in the various\nterms he recounts in the Preface cited above.  In that sense his\nthought is systematic, while not forming a closed system. It is a\nconsistent attempt to re-conceptualize philosophy, to reframe the\nterms in which many philosophers think about self and world. This is, in part, \nwhat is meant by saying that Nishida would have us think from the\nperspective of the world rather than the \u201cI.\u201d\n",
