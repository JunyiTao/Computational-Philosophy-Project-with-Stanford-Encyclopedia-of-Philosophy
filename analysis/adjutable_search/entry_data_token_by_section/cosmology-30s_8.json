In a series of\nlectures given at Harvard in late 1932 and published early in the new\nyear as The Expanding Universe, Eddington denied the efficacy\nof both operationalism and hypothetico-deductivism, and not only\ndefended explanatory realism, but strengthened his ontological\nposition heroically: the theoretical entities of relativistic\ncosmology were not just plausible, they were so necessary to\nunderstanding the universe, that cosmological knowledge was\nessentially impossible without them (Eddington 1933, p. 19).\n",
