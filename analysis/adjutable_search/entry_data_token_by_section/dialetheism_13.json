    "main_text": "Objections to Dialetheism || The Argument from Negation\n4.3 The Argument from Negation\n\nArguments against dialetheism are often focused on the concept of\nlogical negation. The main one goes as follows. The truth conditions\nfor negation are: \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true. Hence, if\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) were true, \\(A\\) would be both true and not true,\nwhich is impossible.\n\nWhat to make of this argument? First, the truth conditions for\nnegation employed here are contentious. An alternative view has it\nthat \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is false, and \\(\\neg A\\) is false\niff \\(A\\) is true\u2014and in the semantics of many paraconsistent\nlogics (for instance, the logic of First Degree Entailment), truth and\nfalsity may overlap. Such an account preserves our intuition that\nnegation is the operator which (truth-functionally) switches truth and\nfalsity. It also preserves our intuition on contradictoriness, in the\nform: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are contradictories iff, if \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\)\nis false, and if \\(A\\) is false, \\(B\\) is true. What has to go, on\nthis proposal, is the assumption that truth and falsity are exclusive\nin all cases: there exist dialetheias, that is, sentences falling\nsimultaneously under both categories.\n\nSecondly, a dialetheist can point out that the argument against\ndialetheism based on the truth conditions for (classical) negation\nbegs the question at its last step: why should we assume that it is\nimpossible for \\(A\\) to be both true and not true? Well, because it is\na contradiction. But that is precisely what is at issue; the critic\nwas supposed to be arguing for the impossibility of any contradiction\nholding to begin with. In fact, the dialetheist may even\naccept a characterisation of the truth conditions for\nnegation as: \u2018\\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true\u2019.\nFor if the \u2018metalanguage\u2019 in which the characterisation is\nexpressed can be inconsistent in its turn, as a thoroughgoing\ndialetheist is likely to allow (as in Weber et al 2016), then there is\nno guarantee that the \u2018not\u2019 in that clause behaves\nconsistently. So the debate comes back to the basic question of\nwhether or not consistency can be presupposed.\n\nA variant on the anti-dialetheic argument from negation comes from a\nQuinean conception of logical vocabulary. It goes as follows. Even\ngranting that there is an operator, say, \\(*\\), which behaves as\ndialetheists claim (namely, such that in particular in some cases\n\\(A\\) is true together with \\(*A)\\), it is still perfectly possible to\ndefine a negation with all the properties of classical\nnegation; in particular, the property of being explosive. And since\nclassical negation is the standard operator in logic, it is misleading\nto translate anything non-classical as \u2018not\u2019: such a\ntranslation risks simply calling \u2018negation\u2019 something\ndifferent. A change in logical vocabulary is a \u201cchange of\nsubject\u201d, as the Quinean slogan goes. A version of this\nobjection to dialetheism is due to Slater (1995); see also Restall\n1993.\n\nOne line of reply to the Quinean objection available to the\ndialetheist is that the objection is confused between a logical theory\nand what the theory is a theory of. There are many different and\nwell-worked out logical theories of negation (minimal negation,\nintuitionistic negation, De Morgan negation, etc.). Insofar as each\none of them characterizes its own theoretical object, there is no\nrivalry between logics. Rivalry begins when we wonder whether some\naccount or other captures the meaning and functioning of negation as\nit is used in the vernacular. An applied account of negation is a\ntheory of something, and the theoretical object has to fit\nthe real object. Now, to assume beforehand that the classical account\nof negation is the correct one, in the sense that it captures how\nnegation works in the vernacular, again begs the question against the\ndialetheist (and, indeed, against most non-classical logicians): it is\ncircular just to assume that classical negation gets it\nright. People who propose a treatment of negation alternative to the\nclassical one are not thereby proposing to revise negation,\nbut to revise an account of it, which they consider incorrect.\n\nIf it is agreed that a fair discussion between dialetheists and\nnon-dialetheists cannot presuppose one account of negation over the\nother, then this suggests a simpler reply from dialetheists to the\njust-true/exclusion problems from 4.2 above. The reply now is to demur\nfrom the presuppositions of the just-true/exclusion objections.\nWithout begging any questions one way or the other, this reply goes,\nall agree that for a sentence to be just-true amounts to it being true\nand not false, and just-false being false and not true. Then as Priest\nputs it (Priest 1987, p.291 of 2006 edition),\n\nA dialetheist can express the claim that something, \\(A\\), is not\ntrue\u2014in those very words, \\(\\neg Tr\\langle A \\rangle\\). What she\ncannot do is ensure that the words she utters behave consistently:\neven if \\(\\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\) holds, \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg Tr\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) may yet hold.\n\n\nIn the exclusion objection, it appears that the dialetheist is being\nasked to ensure that the words she utters behave\nconsistently\u2014which is exactly what is at issue. (See Restall\n2010 and the reply in Beall et al 2011 for one round of this sort of\ndiscussion.) A dialetheist goes on to question why one should think\nthat commitment to an explosive logic is, in itself, a guard against\ncontradiction, and therefore why dialetheists are supposed to be in\nspecial difficulty with respect to the exclusion question any more\nthan a non-dialetheist. Filling in the details here will vary, but the\nreply, in short, is for a dialetheist as with anyone else,\n\u2018just-true\u2019 is just \u2018true\u2019 (Beall 2009, p.\n54). For elaboration of a dialetheic solution to the \u2018just\ntrue\u2019 problem see Omori and Weber 2019. \n\nOne final way this same sort of objection is expressed is by asking\ndialetheists for some way to sort the true-only sentences from the\ntrue-and-false sentences:\n\nI often find myself being asked the following question: \u2018Since\nyou believe some contradictions, but not all, you must have a\ncriterion for deciding between those that are true and those that are\nnot. What is it?\u2019 In reply I usually point out that the\nquestioner believes some things are true, but not all, and ask them\nwhat criterion they have for deciding between those things that are\ntrue and those that are not. The answer, I think, is the same in both\ncases. Nice as it would be to have a criterion of truth, to expect one\nwould seem utopian. One has to treat each case on its merits, whether\nthe proposition concerned is a contradiction or some other thing\n(Priest 2006 p. 56).\n\n\nPriest\u2019s suggestion is that dialetheists are working with truth\nand falsity, just like non-dialetheists. Accounts of negation differ,\nbut this on its own does not create any special obligations on the\npart of dialetheists.\n",
