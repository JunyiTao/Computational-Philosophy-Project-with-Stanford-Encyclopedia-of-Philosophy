    "main_text": "Late Writings || The Historicity of Things\n5. Alexander\u2019s Legacy\n\nAlexander\u2019s work impacted a wide variety of thinkers, and he was\nespecially widely read from the 1910s to the 1930s. His work was\nused and referenced by the likes of British new realists Bertrand\nRussell, G. E. Moore, and G. F. Stout, John Laird, C. D. Broad;\nand by American realists Edwin B. Holt, and George P. Adams;\nfor a longer list, see Fisher (2021a). \n\nThe last decade has seen increasing scholarly interest in tracing\nAlexander\u2019s influence on other philosophers. For example, his work was\nalso picked up by John Anderson, who attended Alexander\u2019s\n1917\u20131918 Gifford lectures. Lines of thought stemming from\nAlexander can be found in Anderson\u2019s Australian student, D.M.\nArmstrong; and in American philosopher Donald C. Williams. On\nAlexander\u2019s influence on Anderson and Armstrong, see Gillett\n(2006), Fisher (2015), Cole (2018, \u00a71; \u00a75.2); and Weblin\n(2021). On Williams, see Fisher (2015) and Williams (2021).\nMetaphysician Dorothy Emmet\u2019s (2021) piece shows her work also\nowed a lot to Alexander.\n\nThe extent of Alexander\u2019s intellectual relationship with\nphilosopher of history R. G. Collingwood is only recently coming to be\nappreciated; see O\u2019Neill (2006), Connelly (2021), and Kobayashi\n(2021). Unusually for a realist, Alexander\u2019s work was also\npicked up by at least two British idealists, May Sinclair and Hilda\nOakeley; see Thomas (2015; 2019).\n",
