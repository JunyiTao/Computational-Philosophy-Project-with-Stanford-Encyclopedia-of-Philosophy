    "main_text": "Historical Outline || The Early Translations\n1.1 The Early Translations\n\nThe Syriac Christians adopted a teaching tradition which included\na truncated version of the Alexandrian Organon\n(Porphyry's Eisagoge followed by\nthe Categories, On Interpretation, and the first\nseven chapters of the Prior Analytics). This teaching\ntradition continued without disruption through the Arab conquests and\nunder the Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750). During this period, however, it\nevoked little if any interest on the part of the Muslim\nconquerors.\nIt was the advent of the Abbasid Caliphate (750\u20131258) that\nsignalled the beginnings of an interest in philosophy on the part of\nthe ruling elite. This was to usher in a translation movement which in\nthe first place translated the Syriac decoctions of philosophy into\nArabic, but which later turned to the Aristotelian texts themselves\nand the commentaries written on them in late\nantiquity.[2] An\nexample of an Arabic translation produced before the Aristotelian turn\nis the translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa\u2018 (ex.\u00a0756) of a logic\ntreatise that probably came to him from the Syriac via the Pahlavi\n(probably from a late antique introduction to philosophy; see Gutas\n1993: 44 fn. 68). The treatise gestures towards the Eisagoge,\nthen turns to the Categories, On Interpretation, and\nthe introductory parts of the Prior Analytics on assertoric\nsyllogisms (Danishpazhuh 1978). As Pines pointed out long ago, this\nmaterial corresponds to the Old Logic (logica vetus) of the\nLatin West (Pines 1996). One must bear\nin mind, however, that there are important differences between\neighth-century Arabic logic and the Old Logic of the Latin tradition.\nFirst, there were Syriac translations of other Aristotelian logical\ntexts available throughout this period (e.g., the Posterior\nAnalytics; Elamrani-Jamal and Hugonnard-Roche\n1989), so\nthere were scholars about who had a good idea of what later texts in\nthe Organon had to offer. Secondly, soon after Ibn\nal-Muqaffa\u2018 had produced his treatise, other scholars were\ntranslating complete Aristotelian works into Arabic. We know, for\nexample, that the Caliph al-Mahd\u00ee (reg.\u00a0775\u2013785) had\ncommissioned translations of the Topics and\nthe Sophistical Fallacies (Gutas 1993: 43).\n\nThe translation movement continued to pick up momentum through the\nninth century, and by the 830s a circle of translators were loosely\ncoordinated around Ab\u00fb Y\u00fbsuf Ya\u2018q\u00fbb b.\nIsh\u00e2q al-Kind\u00ee (d.\u00a0c.\u00a0870). Kind\u00ee produced\na short overview of the whole of the Organon (translated in\nRescher 1963a), and members of his circle produced: an epitome of and\ncommentary on the Categories; an epitome of On\nInterpretation; a version of the Sophistical Fallacies;\nand probably an early translation of the\n Rhetoric.[3] \n\nSomewhat later, perhaps from the 850s, the great Syriac Christian\ntranslators Hunayn ibn Ish\u00e2q (d.\u00a0873) and his son\nIsh\u00e2q ibn Hunayn (d.\u00a0910) began to produce integral\ntranslations of complete works from the Organon, generally by\nway of Syriac translations, some of which dated back to before the Arab\nconquests. One or the other (it is uncertain from the sources)\ntranslated the Categories, Ish\u00e2q translated On\nInterpretation, Hunayn seems to have collaborated with the\notherwise unknown Theodorus to translate the Prior Analytics,\nfather and son both seem to have had a hand in producing a new Syriac\ntranslation of the Posterior Analytics, and Ish\u00e2q\nprovided revised translations of\nthe Topics and the Rhetoric. Perhaps it was someone\nin this circle who translated the Poetics into\n Syriac.[4] \n\nIn spite of these achievements, Hunayn's circle is not unequivocally\nAristotelian. Hunayn himself was interested above all in Galen, and\nwhat we know of Galen's greatest logical work we know from citations in\nHunayn's reverential listing (Boudon 2000: 458 On Demonstration).\n",
