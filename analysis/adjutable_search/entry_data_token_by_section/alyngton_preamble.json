    "main_text": "\n\nRobert Alyngton was one of the most important authors of the\ngeneration after John Wyclif. He was deeply influenced by Walter\nBurley\u2019s logico-ontological system and Wyclif\u2019s\nmetaphysics. His major extant work, a commentary on the\nCategories, heavily depends on Burley\u2019s last commentary\non the Categories and Wyclif\u2019s De ente\npraedicamentali. Yet he was able to develop new logical and\nsemantic theories as well as the general strategy adopted by the\nOxford Realists, as he methodically substituted reference to external\nobjective realities for reference to linguistic and/or mental\nactivities.\n",
