    "main_text": "The Reach of Embodied Cognition || Social Cognition\n6.1 Social Cognition\n\n\nSocial cognition is the ability to understand and interact with other\nagents. A wide variety of cognitive capacities are involved in social\ncognition, such as attention, memory, affective cognition, and\nmetacognition (Fiske and Taylor 2013). Traditionally, however, the\nphilosophical discussion of social cognition has narrowly conceived of\nit in terms of mentalizing (also called theory of mind or\nmindreading). Mentalizing refers to the attribution of mental\nstates, often restricted to propositional attitudes, and typically for\nthe purpose of explaining and predicting others\u2019 behavior. Thus,\nalthough social cognition is enabled by and involves numerous and\ndiverse cognitive processes, many philosophers have tended to think of\nit simply as involving the attribution of propositional attitudes in\norder to predict and explain behavior. For canonical expressions of\nthis view of social cognition, see Davies and Stone (1995a) and\n(1995b). More recently, philosophers have begun to conceive of social\ncognition more broadly. See Andrews, Spaulding, and Westra (2020) for\na survey of Pluralistic Folk Psychology.\n\n\nEmbodied cognition theorists have rejected this narrow construal of\nsocial cognition. Though they do not deny that neurotypical adult\nhumans have the capacity to attribute beliefs and desires and to\nexplain and predict behavior, they argue that this is a specialized\nand rarely used skill in our ordinary social interactions (Gallagher\n2020; Gallagher 2008; Hutto and Ratcliffe 2007). Most social\ninteractions require only basic underlying social cognitive capacities\nthat are known as primary and secondary intersubjectivity (Trevarthen\n1979).\n\n\nPrimary intersubjectivity is the pre-theoretical, non-conceptual,\nembodied understanding of others that underlies and supports the\nhigher-level cognitive skills involved in mentalizing. It is\n\u201cthe innate or early developing capacity to interact with others\nmanifested at the level of perceptual experience\u2014we see or more\ngenerally perceive in the other person\u2019s bodily movements,\nfacial gestures, eye direction, and so on, what they intend and what\nthey feel\u201d (Gallagher 2005, 204). Primary intersubjectivity is\npresent from birth, but it continues to serve as the basis for our\nsocial cognition in adulthood. It manifests as the capacity for facial\nimitation, the capacity to detect and track eye movement, detect\nintentional behavior, and \u201cread\u201d emotions from actions and\nexpressive movements of others. Primary intersubjectivity consists in\ninformational sensitivity and appropriate responsiveness to specific\nfeatures of one\u2019s environment. It does not, embodied cognition\ntheorists argue, involve representing and theorizing about those\nfeatures. It simply requires certain practical abilities that have\nbeen shaped by selective pressures, e.g., sensitivity to certain\nbodily cues and facial expressions.\n\n\nAround one year of age, neurotypical children develop the capacity for\nsecondary intersubjectivity. This development enables a subject to\nmove from one-on-one, immediate intersubjectivity to shared attention.\nAt this stage, children learn to follow gazes, point, and communicate\nwith others about objects of shared attention. According to embodied\ncognition, the cognitive skills acquired through secondary\nintersubjectivity are not rich, meta-cognitive representations about\nother minds. Rather, children learn practical skills when getting\nothers to attend to an object and when learning to attend to objects\nothers are attending to. This allows for a richer understanding of\nother agents, but it is still meant to be a behavioral, embodied\nunderstanding rather than a representation of others\u2019\npropositional attitudes (Gallagher 2005, 207).\n\n\nAlthough primary and secondary intersubjectivity are described in\ndevelopmental terms, according to embodied cognition these\nintersubjective practices constitute our primary mode of social\ncognition even as adults (Fuchs 2012; Gallagher 2008). For example,\nHutto claims, \u201cOur primary worldly engagements are\nnonrepresentational and do not take the form of intellectual\nactivity\u201d (2008, 51). One can see in Hutto\u2019s description\nof social cognition a tendency toward the Replacement theme insofar as\nhe seeks to minimize or reject completely a role for representation in\nthe human capacity for understanding others\u2019\nbehavior. Mentalizing, it is argued, is a late developing, rarely\nused, specialized skill.  Primary and secondary intersubjectivity are\nfundamental insofar as they are sufficient for navigating most typical\nsocial interactions and insofar as they enable the development of\nhigher-level social cognition, like mentalizing. Although, see\nSpaulding (2010) for a critique of these arguments.\n\n\nMirror neurons may be an important mechanism of social cognition on\nthis kind of view. Mirror neurons are neurons that activate both\nendogenously in producing a behavior and exogenously in observing that\nvery same behavior. For instance, neurons in the premotor cortex and\ninferior parietal lobule activate when a subject uses, say, a\nwhole-handed grasp to pick up a bottle. These very same neurons\nselectively activate when a subject observes a target using a\nwhole-handed grasp to pick up an object. Neuroscientists have\ndiscovered similar patterns of activation in neurons in various parts\nof the brain, leading to the proposal that there are mirror neuron\nsystems for action, fear, anger, pain, disgust, etc. Though the\ninterpretation of these findings is subject to a great deal of\ncontroversy (Hickok 2009), many theorists propose that mirror neurons\nare a basic mechanism of social cognition (Gallese 2009; Goldman 2009;\nGoldman and de Vignemont 2009; Iacoboni 2009). The rationale is that\nmirror neurons explain how a subject understands a target\u2019s\nmental states without needing complicated, high-level inferences about\nbehavior and mental states. In observation mode, the subject\u2019s\nbrain activates as if the subject is doing, feeling, or experiencing\nwhat the target is doing, feeling, or experiencing. Thus, the\nobservation of the target\u2019s behavior is automatically meaningful\nto the subject. Mirror neurons are a possible mechanism for embodied\nsocial cognition. If the findings and interpretations are upheld, they\nsubstantiate the claim that we can understand and interact with others\nwithout engaging in mentalizing. For a survey of the reasons to be\ncautious about these interpretations of mirror neurons, see Spaulding\n(2011; 2013).\n",
