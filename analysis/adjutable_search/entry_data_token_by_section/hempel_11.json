But if \u201c\\(Fx\\)\u201d stands for\nan uninstantiated property, such as being a vampire, then,\nsince \u201c\\(\\neg Fx\\)\u201d is satisfied by everything, regardless\nof the attribute \u201c\\(Gx\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(\\neg Gx\\)\u201d,\netc., that hypothesis\u2014and its logical equivalents\u2014are not\nonly universally confirmed but even qualify as \u201claws\u201d.\nThis is not surprising, from a logical point of view, since\nextensional logic is purely truth functional, where the truth value of\nmolecular sentences is a function of the truth values of its atomic\nconstituents. But it implies that an empirical generalization that\nmight be true of the world\u2019s history may or may not be\n\u201clawful\u201d, since it could be the case that its truth was\nmerely \u201caccidental\u201d. Hempel\u2019s endorsement of\nGoodman\u2019s approach to select generalizations that support\nsubjunctive conditionals, therefore, was not only consistent with the\ntradition of Hume\u2014who believed that attributions of natural\nnecessity in causal relations are merely \u201chabits of mind\u201d,\npsychologically irresistible, perhaps, but logically\nunwarranted\u2014but circumvented a disconcerting consequence of his\nexplication.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between sentences that\n\u201csupport subjunctives\u201d and those that \u201centail\nsubjunctives\u201d, when the selection of those that support\nsubjunctives is made on pragmatic grounds. Popper captured the crucial\ndifference between material (extensional) generalizations and\nsubjunctive (intensional) generalizations as follows:\n\n\nA statement may be said to be naturally or physically\nnecessary if, and only if, it is deducible from a statement\nfunction which is satisfied in all worlds that differ from our own, if\nat all, only with respect to initial conditions. (Popper 1965:\n433)\n\n\nIndeed, the existence of irreducibly ontic probabilistic phenomena,\nwhere more than one outcome is possible under the same initial\nconditions, would mean that the history of an indeterministic world\nmight be identical with the history of a deterministic one, where\ntheir differences were concealed \u201cby chance\u201d. Even a\ncomplete description of the history of the actual world might not\nsuffice to distinguish between them, where fundamental aspects of\ntheir causal structure would remain beyond empirical detection.\n\nThe difference between Popper\u2019s universal predicates and\nGoodman\u2019s paradoxical ones may derive from the consideration\nthat incorporating specific times into his definitions entails\nreference to specific moments of time \\(t\\), such as\nmidnight tonight, during the history of the actual world, a\npoint to which we are going to return. It follows that they cannot be\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in Popper\u2019s sense and do not even\nqualify as \u201cpurely qualitative\u201d in Hempel\u2019s, either.\nReliance upon material conditionals within first-order symbolic logic,\nmoreover, forfeits the benefits of synthetic subjunctives. If the\nhypothesis, \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d, is more adequately\nformalized as a subjunctive of the form, \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\rightarrow\nBx)\\)\u201d, where the truth of a subjunctive hypothetically assumes\nthat its antecedent condition is satisfied, that obviates the paradox:\nwhite shoes are not ravens, and Nicod\u2019s criteria apply Instances\nof \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(Bx\\)\u201d thereby confirm the\nhypothesis; instances of \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\neg\nBx\\)\u201d disconfirm it; and instances of \u201c\\(\\neg Rx\\)\u201d\nare epistemically neutral, precisely as Nicod said.\n",
