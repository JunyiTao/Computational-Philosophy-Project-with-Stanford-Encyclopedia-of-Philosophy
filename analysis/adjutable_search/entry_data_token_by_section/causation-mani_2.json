    "main_text": "Interventions\n4. Interventions\n\nExamples like those just described show that if we wish to follow\nMenzies and Price in defending the claim that if an association\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) persists when \\(A\\) is given the right sort of\n\u201cindependent causal history\u201d or is\n\u201cmanipulated\u201d in the right way, then \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\),\nwe need to be more precise by what we mean by the quoted phases. There\nhave been a number of attempts to do this in the recent literature on\ncausation. The basic idea that all of these discussions attempt to\ncapture is that of a \u201csurgical\u201d change in \\(A\\) which is\nof such a character that if any change occurs in \\(B\\), it occurs only\nas a result of its causal connection, if any, to \\(A\\) and not in any\nother way. In other words, the change in \\(B\\), if any, that is\nproduced by the manipulation of \\(A\\) should be produced only via a\ncausal route that goes through \\(A\\). Manipulations or changes in the\nvalue of a variable that have the right sort of surgical features have\ncome to be called interventions in the recent literature\n(e.g., Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000; Meek and Glymour 1994;\nHausman 1998; Pearl 2009; Woodward 1997, 2000, 2003; Woodward and\nHitchcock 2003; Cartwright 2003) and this entry will follow this\npractice. The characterization of the notion of an intervention is\nrightly seen by many writers as central to the development of a\nplausible version of a manipulability theory. One of the most detailed\nattempts to think systematically about interventions and their\nsignificance for understanding causation is due to Pearl 2009 and is\ndiscussed in the following section.\n",
