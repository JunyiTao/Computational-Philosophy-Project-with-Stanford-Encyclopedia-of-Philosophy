    "main_text": "Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist\n1. Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist\nWomen are capable of education, but they are not made for\nactivities which demand a universal faculty such as the more advanced\nsciences, philosophy and certain forms of artistic production. ...\nWomen regulate their actions not by the demands of universality, but by\narbitrary inclinations and opinions. \n\n(Hegel 1973: 263)\n\n\n\nThe idea that the gender of philosophers is important or even relevant\nto their work is a thought that runs counter to the self-image of\nphilosophy. So, it is interesting to explore how and why feminist\nphilosophers came to the realization that gender is a useful analytic\ncategory to apply to the history of philosophy. We can distinguish two\naspects to this process although, in many cases, the two aspects merge\ninto a single project. The first stage of realizing the importance of\ngender consisted of the cataloguing of the explicit misogyny of most of\nthe canon. The second stage consisted of probing the theories of\ncanonical philosophers in order to uncover the gender bias lurking in\ntheir supposedly universal theories. The second stage, the discovery\nthat a philosopher's supposedly universal and objective theories were\ngender specific, raised the further question of whether or not the\ntheoretical gender bias was intrinsic to the theory or extrinsic to it.\nLet me illustrate these points with Aristotle. \n",
