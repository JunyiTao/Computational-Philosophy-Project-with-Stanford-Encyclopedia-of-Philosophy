The Port Royal Logic\nof the following (seventeenth) century seems typical in its approach:\nits authors frequently suggest that logic is trivial and\nunimportant. Its doctrine includes that of the square of opposition,\nbut the discussion of the O form is so vague that\nnobody could pin down its exact truth conditions, and there is\ncertainly no awareness indicated of problems of existential\nimport, in spite of the fact that the authors state that\nthe E form entails the O form (4th\ncorollary of chapter 3 of part 3). This seems to typify popular texts\nfor the next while. In the nineteenth century, the apparently most\nwidely used textbook in Britain and America was Whately\u2019s Elements\nof Logic. Whately gives the traditional doctrine of the square,\nwithout any discussion of issues of existential import or of empty\nterms. He includes the problematic principles of contraposition (which\nhe calls \u201cconversion by negation\u201d):\n\n\n\nEvery S is P\n=\nEvery not-P is not-S\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also endorses\n obversion:[23]\n\nSome A is not B is equivalent to Some A is\nnot-B, and thus it converts to Some not-B is A.\n\n\n\nHe says that this principle is \u201cnot found in Aldrich,\u201d but that it is\n\u201cin frequent\n use.\u201d[24]\n This \u201cfrequent use\u201d continued; later\nnineteenth and early twentieth century text books in England and\nAmerica continued to endorse obversion (also called \u201cinfinitation\u201d or\n\u201cpermutation\u201d), and contraposition (also called \u201cillative\n conversion\u201d).[25]\n This full nineteenth century tradition is consistent only on the\nassumption that empty (and universal) terms are prohibited, but\nauthors seem unaware of this; Keynes 1928, 126, says generously \u201cThis\nassumption appears to have been made implicitly in the traditional\ntreatment of logic.\u201d De Morgan is atypical in making the assumption\nexplicit: in his 1847 text (p. 64) he forbids universal terms (empty\nterms disappear by implication because if A is empty,\nnon-A will be universal), but later in the same text (p. 111) he\njustifies ignoring empty terms by treating this as an idealization, adopted\nbecause not all of his readers are\n mathmeticians.[26]\n\nIn the twentieth century \u0141ukasiewicz also developed a version\nof syllogistic that depends explicitly on the absence of empty terms;\nhe attributed the system to Aristotle, thus helping to foster the\ntradition according to which the ancients were unaware of empty\nterms.\n\n\nToday, logic texts divide between those based on contemporary logic\nand those from the Aristotelian tradition or the nineteenth century\ntradition, but even many texts that teach syllogistic teach it with the\nforms interpreted in the modern way, so that e.g. subalternation is\nlost. So the traditional square, as traditionally interpreted, is now\nmostly abandoned.\n",
