    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Broader Significance of Kant\u2019s Aesthetics\n2.9 The Broader Significance of Kant\u2019s Aesthetics\n\nKant himself clearly takes his aesthetic theory to be of central\nimportance for the understanding of the so-called \u201cfaculty of\njudgment\u201d generally (see\n Section 1\n above): this implies that he takes it to be of importance for\nunderstanding empirical scientific enquiry, and in particular for our\nunderstanding of biological phenomena. As noted in\n Section 2.8\n above, there are also significant connections between Kant\u2019s\nviews on aesthetics and his views on ethics, and, as noted in\n Section 1,\n a number of commentators have, in addition, laid special weight on\nthe connection between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his views on\nempirical cognition. Some commentators have also drawn on Kant\u2019s\naesthetic theory to illuminate specific aspects of Kant\u2019s views\non cognition; for example, Heidemann (2016) draws on Kant\u2019s\naesthetic theory to defend the view that Kant\u2019s theory of\ncognition is nonconceptualist.\n\nMany philosophers have seen Kant\u2019s aesthetics as having\nsignificance for domains of philosophical enquiry outside both\naesthetics and the study of Kant. An important example is Cavell\n(1976: ch. 3), who connects the subjective universality which Kant\nascribes to judgments of beauty with the appeal made, in ordinary\nlanguage philosophy, to \u201cwhat we should say\u201d (see\nespecially 94\u201396). This connection is explored further in Baz\n(2016) and Makkai (2021), both of which draw on Cavell for their\nunderstanding of the philosophical significance of Kant\u2019s\naccount of judgments of beauty. Somewhat relatedly, Bell (1987) draws\na connection between Kant\u2019s view of aesthetic judgment and\nWittgenstein\u2019s rule-following considerations; Ginsborg 2011\ninvokes Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory as a basis for a response to the\nskepticism about rules and meaning which Saul Kripke attributes to\nWittgenstein (Kripke 1982).\n\nIn an influential discussion, Arendt (1982) applies Kant\u2019s\ntheory of aesthetic judgment within the sphere of political\nphilosophy; relatedly, Fleischacker (1999) draws connections between\naesthetic judgment for Kant and moral and political judgment\ngenerally.\n\nThe implications of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory for the philosophy\nof mathematics and the philosophy of science have been explored in\nBreitenbach 2013 and Breitenbach 2018 respectively;\nBreitenbach argues that, although Kant does not explicitly claim that\nmathematical proofs or scientific theories can be beautiful, we can\nnonetheless, on a Kantian view, feel pleasure in both. As noted in\n Section 1,\n Breitenbach (2021) also argues that the imaginative reflection\ncharacteristic of aesthetic experience also characterizes creativity\nin scientific cognition.\n\nKant\u2019s aesthetic theory has been extensively discussed within\nliterary theory, where there has been particular emphasis on\nKant\u2019s theory of the sublime. See for example Weiskel (1976) and\nHertz (1978), both of which interpret Kant\u2019s account of the\nsublime in psychoanalytic terms, as well as the discussions of the\nKantian sublime in de Man (1990) and Lyotard (1991 [1994]).\nKant\u2019s aesthetic theory more generally is discussed in Derrida\n(1975 [1981] and 1978 [1987]); while the work of Derrida and other\ndeconstructionists has been largely ignored or dismissed by\ncommentators within the analytic tradition of philosophy, it has been\ninfluential among literary theorists.\n",
