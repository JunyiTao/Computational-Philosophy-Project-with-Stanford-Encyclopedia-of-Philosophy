    "main_text": "The Reach of Embodied Cognition || Moral Cognition\n6.2 Moral Cognition\n\n\nEmbodied moral cognition takes moral sentimentalism as a starting\n point. \n Moral sentimentalism\n is the view\nthat our emotions and desires are, in some way, fundamental to\nmorality, moral knowledge, and moral judgments. A particular version\nof moral sentimentalism holds that emotions, moral attitudes, and\nmoral judgments are generated by our \u201cgut reactions,\u201d and\nany moral reasoning that occurs is typically post-hoc rationalization\nof those gut reactions (Haidt 2001; Nichols 2004; Prinz\n2004). Embodied moral cognition takes inspiration from this kind of\nmoral sentimentalism. It holds that many of our moral judgments stem\nfrom our embodied, affective states rather than abstract\nreasoning.\n\n\nVarious sources of empirical evidence support this kind of view.\nConsider, for example, pathological cases, such as psychopaths or\nindividuals with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC).\nSuch individuals are impaired in making moral judgments. Psychopaths\nfeel little compunction about behaving immorally and sometimes have a\nhard time differentiating moral from conventional norms (Hare 1999).\nIndividuals with damage to the vmPFC retain knowledge of abstract\nmoral principles but struggle in making specific, everyday moral\ndecisions (Damasio 1994). In both cases, individuals lack the\nphysiological responses that accompany neurotypical moral\ndecision-making. Lacking these \u201csomatic markers\u201d that\nguide moral judgments, these individuals behave in impulsive, selfish,\nand immoral ways (Damasio 1994). Embodied cognition would predict this\nconnection between physiological responses (like increased heartrate\nand palm sweating) and moral decision-making.\n\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have observed the influence of\nembodied cues on moral judgments in neurotypical individuals, as well.\nFor instance, experimentally manipulated perception of one\u2019s\nheartrate seems to influence one\u2019s moral judgments, with\nperceptions of faster heartrates leading to feelings of higher moral\ndistress and more just moral judgments (Gu, Zhong, and Page-Gould\n2013). Relatedly, there is some evidence that eliciting a feeling of\ndisgust leads to harsher moral judgments (Schnall et al. 2008).\nPerceptions of cleanliness seem to lead to less severe moral judgments\n(Schnall, Benton, and Harvey 2008). In each of these cases, perception\nof embodied cues seems to mediate moral judgments. Moral\nsentimentalists have observed that many people have strong aversive\nreactions to harmless actions that violate taboos, such as consensual\nprotected sex between adult siblings, cleaning a toilet with the\nnational flag, eating one\u2019s pet that had been run over, etc. In\nthese cases, the strong negative affective response precedes the moral\njudgment, and often people have a difficult time articulating\nwhy they think these victimless, harmless actions are morally\nwrong (Strejcek and Zhong 2014; Haidt 2001; Haidt, Koller, and Dias\n1993; Cushman, Young, and Hauser 2006). From the perspective of\nembodied cognition, this ordering confirms the notion that we make\nmoral judgments on the basis of embodied cues.\n\n\nDual process theories of moral psychology reject the moral\nsentimentalism claim that all moral judgments are made in the same\nway.  Dual process theories maintain that we have two systems of moral\ndecision-making: a system for Utilitarian reasoning that is driven by\naffect-less, abstract deliberation, and system for Deontological\nreasoning that is driven by automatic, intuitive, emotional heuristics\nlike gut feelings (Greene, 2014). Dual process theories are meant to\nexplain the seemingly inconsistent moral intuitions ordinary folks\nhave about moral dilemmas. For example, in a standard trolley case\nwhere an out-of-control trolley is heading toward five innocent,\nunaware individuals on the track ahead, most people have the intuition\nthat we ought to throw the switch so that the trolley goes onto a spur\nof the track, thereby killing one person on the spur but saving five\nlives.  However, in the footbridge variation of the trolley problem\nwhere saving the five lives requires pushing an individual off a\nfootbridge to derail the trolley, most people have the intuition that\nwe should not do this even though the consequences are the same as in\nthe standard trolley dilemma. The dual process theory holds that in\nthe former case, our reasoning is guided by a System-2 type of\nabstract reasoning. However, in the latter case, our moral reasoning\nis guided by an aversive physiological response triggered by imagining\npushing an individual off a footbridge. The dual process view\npartially vindicates the moral sentimentalist position insofar as it\nposits a distinctive System 1 type of moral reasoning that is based on\nembodied gut instincts. However, it maintains that there is a separate\nsystem operating on different inputs and processes for more abstract\nmoral reasoning.\n\n\nRecently, theorists have challenged dual process theories\u2019\nstrict dichotomy between reason and emotion (Huebner 2015; Maibom\n2010; Woodward 2016). On the one hand, brain areas that are associated\nwith emotions like fear, anger, and disgust are implicated in complex\nlearning and inferential processing. On the other hand, individuals\nwho are clearly impaired in moral decision-making\u2014psychopaths\nand those with damaged vmPFC\u2014also suffer deficits in other kinds\nof learning and inferential processing. Abstract reasoning is not, as\nit turns out, cut off from affective processes. Somatic markers,\naffective cues, and physiological responses are central to reasoning,\nlearning, and decision-making. For the proponent of embodied moral\ncognition, this serves as further confirmation of the idea that all\ncognition, including moral cognition, is deeply shaped by embodied\ncues. Though see May (2018), May and Kumar (2018) and Railton (2017)\nfor a moral rationalist take on these findings.\n",
