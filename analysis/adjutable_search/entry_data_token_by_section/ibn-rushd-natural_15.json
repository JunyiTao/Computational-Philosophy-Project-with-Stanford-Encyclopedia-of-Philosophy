    "main_text": "Q\u00fbwa as Force\n16. Q\u00fbwa as Force\n\nPhysics VII.5 (249b27\u2013250b10) discusses some problems\nof simple mechanics (Lettinck 1994: 559\u2013561). The moving-agent\nis always moving something in a certain time and a certain distance,\nand Aristotle presumes here that motion here is at a constant\nvelocity. There is a relationship between the four factors, for\ninstance if A sets B in motion over a distance\nC in time D, A will move half B\nover the distance C in half the time D, because\nthere is a proportion between the force of A and the load of\nB. Aristotle sees limits to the interchange because \u201cit\nmay well happen that it [a fraction of A] cannot move\nB at all\u201d (250a15\u201316). Thirty men can tow a ship\nover a distance and in a time, but one man cannot tow it either over\nany distance or in any time. He also faces Zeno\u2019s contention\nthat every grain of millet must make a sound when it falls as the\nwhole measure does stirring the air and answers that the grain is part\nof a whole and that the whole is the moving-agent.\n\nThe wording was not clear and the commentators made their contribution\nto explain it. Averroes, in his turn, insisted that Zeno\u2019s\ndiscourse is fallacious because \u201cone part does not set in motion\nin actuality, but it does in potentiality within the whole\u201d (LC\n336F TC37; LC Schmieja7 79:7\u20138). Moreover, he set two\nconditions, the movable has to be \u201cprepared\u201d\n(pr\u00e6paratum) and the power of the mover has to be\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (terminatum).\n\n\nOne man out of the thirty does not set the ship in motion on his own,\n[but] when his moving action (motio) joins the preparation\nand the\n power[17]\n coming from the 29 men, [he] will necessarily set in motion the whole\nship; therefore each of the 29 gives to the ship a preparation to move\n(moveri) that it did not have before. (LC 336G; LC Schmieja7\n79:8\u201312)\n\n\nAverroes sees the same process in the falling grain of\n millet.[18]\n Each grain cannot move the air on its own and make a sound. But each\ngrain gives the necessary preparation to the air. When the last added\ngrain passes the threshold and power is complete, the air is stirred\nand a sound is made. This last part is not stronger than the others,\nbut it definitely causes motion \u201cbecause of the preparation made\nin the movable\u201d (LC 336H; LC Schmieja7 79:8). Although he does\nnot explain what \u201cpreparation\u201d is, we can gather that it\nis a kind of potential energy. And as for the notion of\n\u201ccomplete power\u201d, Averroes seems to intend kinetic\nenergy.\n",
