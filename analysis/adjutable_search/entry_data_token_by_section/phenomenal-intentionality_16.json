    "main_text": "Cognitive phenomenology\n5. Cognitive phenomenology\n\nMany defenses and elaborations of PIT maintain that occurrent thoughts\nhave a rich and varied phenomenology. Such a view of thought is\nrequired by versions of PIT that claim that the contents we normally\nattribute to thoughts are phenomenal contents (see\n section 6.2).\n Cognitive phenomenology is also a widely debated topic independently\nof any connection to PIT (see, e.g., Cognitive Phenomenology,\nedited by Bayne and Montague 2011).\n\nAdvocates of PIT that take thought content to be phenomenal content\nmainly focus on arguing for the following two claims: \n\n\n(Proprietary)\nThoughts have proprietary phenomenal characters. \n\n(Individuative)\n Thoughts have individuative phenomenal characters. \n\n\nThe term \u201cproprietary\u201d is due to David Pitt (2004).\nThought has a proprietary phenomenal character just in case\nthe phenomenal characters of thoughts are special or unique to\nthought, i.e., they are not perceptual, verbal, bodily, or affective\nphenomenal characters, or other phenomenal characters that are present\nin mental states other than thoughts. Following current usage, we call\nall of the aforementioned kinds of phenomenology sensory\nphenomenology and the putative proprietary phenomenology of\nthought cognitive phenomenology. The claim that thought has a\nproprietary phenomenology is then just the claim that it has a\nnon-sensory phenomenology.\n\nThoughts have individuative phenomenal characters just in\ncase thoughts with different intentional contents have different\nphenomenal characters and thoughts with different phenomenal\ncharacters have different intentional contents. (We use\n\u201cindividuative\u201d in the way Bayne and Montague (2011: ch.\n1) use it. Pitt (2004) uses the term \u201cdistinctive\u201d for a\nsimilar notion and the term \u201cindividuative\u201d to mean\nsomething else.) \n\n\nWhile most advocates of PIT take thoughts to have individuative\nphenomenal characters, this isn\u2019t required by PIT. Grounding PIT can allow\nthat there is a one-many grounding relation between contents and\nphenomenal characters. For example, phenomenal properties r1\nand r2 might both ground the intentional property of\nrepresenting red421. If all intentional properties\nwere grounded in this way, PIT would be true, but (Individuative)\nmight not be.\n\nIt is possible for thoughts to have proprietary but not individuative\nphenomenal characters. For example, suppose every thought came with\neither a generic feeling of understanding or a generic feeling of\nconfusion. These phenomenal characters might be proprietary in that\nthey do not occur outside of thoughts, but they are not individuative,\nsince thoughts with different intentional contents might have the same\nphenomenal characters.\n\nIt is also possible for thoughts to have individuative but not\nproprietary phenomenal characters. For example, suppose every thought\ncame with a different kind of perceptual imagery. Then thoughts with\ndifferent contents would have different phenomenal characters, but\nthese phenomenal characters would not be special to thoughts, since\nperceptual states could have them too.\n\nIn addition to the claims that there is a proprietary and an\nindividuative phenomenology of thought, advocates of PIT usually aim\nto establish that thought\u2019s content is phenomenal intentional\ncontent and thus that thought\u2019s intentional properties are\nobtained in the requisite way from phenomenal properties. \n\nWhile much of the discussion of the phenomenology of thought involves\ncareful argumentation and consideration of cases, it is worth\nmentioning that many advocates of a proprietary phenomenology of\nthought find the view obvious and the negation of the view clearly\nfalse or even absurd. Strawson writes:\n\n\nTo deny this [cognitive phenomenology], one must hold that the total\nlifelong character of our lived experience\u2014everything that life\nis to us experientially\u2014consists entirely of bare or pure\nsensation or feeling of one kind or another. It must, for example, be\nfalse to say that anguish at someone\u2019s death includes\nconscious comprehending believing entertaining of the\nproposition that he is dead. (Strawson 2011a: 295, italics in\noriginal) \n\n\nIn a similar vein, Kriegel writes:\n\n\nFor my part, I am persuaded of the existence of cognitive experience\n[\u2026] most vividly by something like everyday experiential\noverwhelm: it simply seems that my inner life is much more interesting\nto me than it would be if my conscious experience consisted merely in\nperceptual experiences. (Kriegel 2011a: 50) \n\n\nIn what follows we discuss the main arguments that have been offered\nto supplement such appeals to the alleged obviousness of cognitive\nphenomenology.\n",
