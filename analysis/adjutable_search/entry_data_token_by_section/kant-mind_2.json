    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It || Transcendental Aesthetic\n2.1 Transcendental Aesthetic\n\n\nKant calls the first stage the Transcendental\n Aesthetic.[3]\n It is about what space and time must be like, and how we must handle\nthem, if our experience is to have the spatial and temporal properties\nthat it has. This question about the necessary conditions of\nexperience is for Kant a \u2018transcendental\u2019 question and the\nstrategy of proceeding by trying to find answers to such questions is,\nas we said, the strategy of transcendental argument.\n\n\nHere Kant advances one of his most notorious views: that whatever it\nis that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come\nlocated in a spatial nor even a temporal matrix\n(A37=B54fn.). Rather, it is the mind that organizes this\n\u2018manifold of raw intuition\u2019, as he called it, spatially and\ntemporally. The mind has two pure forms of intuition, space and time,\nbuilt into it to allow it to do so. (\u2018Pure\u2019 means\n\u2018not derived from experience\u2019.)\n\n\nThese claims are very problematic. For example, they invite the\nquestion, in virtue of what is the mind constrained to locate a bit of\ninformation at one spatial or temporal location rather than another?\nKant seems to have had no answer to this question (Falkenstein 1995;\nBrook 1998). Most commentators have found Kant\u2019s claim that space and\ntime are only in the mind, not at all in the mind-independent world, to\nbe implausible.\n\n\nThe activity of locating items in the \u2018forms of\nintuition\u2019, space and time, is one of the three kinds of what\nKant called synthesis and discussed in the chapter on the\nTranscendental Deduction. It is not entirely clear how the two\ndiscussions relate.\n",
