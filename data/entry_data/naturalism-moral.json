    "main_text": "\n1. What is Moral Naturalism?\n\nMoral naturalism is the view that moral facts are stance-independent,\nnatural facts. It can also be characterized as the view that moral\nproperties are stance-independent, natural properties.\n\nFact Naturalism: Moral facts are natural facts.\n\nProperty Naturalism: Moral properties are natural\nproperties.\n\nThese two views are subtly different because there are different kinds\nof moral facts. Particular facts are instantiations of some property;\nparticular moral facts are instantiations of some moral property;\nparticular natural facts are instantiations of some natural property.\nSo Fact Naturalism entails Property Naturalism: if all moral facts are\nnatural, then all particular moral facts are instantiations of natural\nmoral properties. But not all moral facts are particular facts.\nGeneral moral facts, like the fact that genocide is wrong, consist in\neither patterns of instantiations of moral properties or underlying\nlawlike moral principles which explain those patterns of\ninstantiations. Underlying moral principles do not consist in\ninstantiations of moral properties; it is possible that genocide is\nwrong but never committed, in which case there would be no\ninstantiation of a moral property of wrongness to correspond to the\nprinciple that genocide is wrong. So while Property Naturalism entails\nthat all particular moral facts are natural facts, Property\nNaturalism does not entail Fact Naturalism because it\u2019s possible\nthat moral principles are non-natural. For ease of\nexposition, I\u2019ll mostly ignore this complication in what\nfollows, and treat Fact Naturalism and Property Naturalism as\ninterchangeable while focusing on Fact Naturalism as the stronger\nthesis. But moral principles will cause trouble at a few points.\n\nA fact is stance-independent just in case it doesn\u2019t depend on\nthe beliefs or attitudes of any agent. Moral realism is the view that\nmoral principles are stance-independent; this is a more precise way of\ncapturing the common idea that, for a realist, morality is a matter of\nfact rather than a matter of opinion. But what does it mean for a fact\n(or property) to be natural? The usual answer is that natural\nfacts/properties are the kinds of facts/properties that scientific\nmethods tell us about (see, e.g., Shafer-Landau 2003, Chapter 3; Smith\n1994, 17; Copp 2007, 27\u201328). To say that moral facts are natural\nfacts, then, is to say that moral facts are part of the naturalistic\npicture of the world that is revealed by empirical science.\n\nMoral naturalism is opposed to moral supernaturalism, which holds that\nmoral facts are a kind of supernatural (typically, divine) facts. It\nis also opposed to moral non-naturalism, which holds that moral facts\nare neither natural nor supernatural, but are rather their own, third\nkind of thing. And as a version of moral realism, moral naturalism is\nopposed to all varieties of anti-realist views in metaethics,\nincluding constructivism, relativism, expressivism, and error theory.\nWhile anti-realists are usually naturalists in the sense that they\nwant to account for morality in naturalistic terms, anti-realists hold\nthat stance-independent moral facts can\u2019t be reconciled with a\nnaturalistic worldview. Moral naturalists hold that they can be.\n\nFor the naturalist, moral facts are the kinds of facts that can be\ninvestigated by (broadly) scientific methods. But what kinds of facts\ncan be investigated by scientific methods? There is much less\nagreement on how to answer this further question. One common view is\nthat facts can be empirically investigated just in case they are\ncapable of entering into causal explanations of our experiences, and\nthereby be investigated through those experiences (e.g., Bedke 2009;\nEnoch 2010; Lutz 2020). And while most (perhaps all) moral naturalists\nwould say that moral facts can feature in causal explanations, this\nmay not be a good characterization of natural facts, since\nsupernatural facts could, perhaps, also feature in causal explanations\n(Sturgeon 2009; McPherson 2015). We could try to solve this problem\nwith brute force, by defining a natural fact as any fact that features\nin causal explanations that is not a supernatural fact. But this is ad\nhoc; and now we need to characterize supernatural facts. We might also\nworry about what it means for a fact to feature in a causal\nexplanation, which is itself a vexed and controversial issue. Perhaps\nit is best, then, to just leave it at \u201cnatural facts are facts\nthat are known scientifically.\u201d\n\nBut even this minimal characterization faces difficulties. For one\nthing, it is extremely controversial which methods count as\n\u201cscientific.\u201d The \u201cdemarcation problem\u201d of\ndistinguishing science from non-science (or\n\u201cpseudoscience\u201d) is a perennial puzzle in the philosophy\nof science, with many philosophers doubting that there is any general\nway of characterizing scientific methodology (Feyerabend 1975). A\nsecond problem is that this is a methodological or epistemological\ncharacterization of the natural; rather say what kinds of facts moral\nfacts are, moral naturalism would be a view about how moral\nfacts are known. This is, in fact, how some characterize\nmoral naturalism and non-naturalism. In Moral Realism: A\nDefense, Russ Shafer-Landau affirms a number of metaphysical\ntheses that are commonly associated with moral naturalism, most\nnotably saying that moral facts are entirely constituted by more\nfundamental natural facts (Shafer-Landau 2003, 74\u20138). Yet he\nstill calls himself a non-naturalist, because he thinks that we have\nmoral knowledge by intuition and reflective equilibrium rather than by\nscientific methods (Shafer-Landau 2003, 56\u201358ff). Some critics\nhave argued that Shafer-Landau is actually a naturalist in virtue of\nhis metaphysical commitments (Bedke 2012, fn 1). But if a\nmethodological characterization of the natural is best, then\nShafer-Landau has labeled his view correctly.\n\nSo far, we have characterized moral naturalism in terms of four\nclaims:\n\nMoral Realism: There are stance-independent moral\nfacts.\n\nFact Naturalism: Moral facts are natural facts.\n\nProperty Naturalism: Moral properties are natural\nproperties.\n\nMethodological Naturalism: We know about moral claims\nin the same way that we know about claims in the natural sciences.\n\nBut moral naturalism is sometimes associated with a fifth,\nlinguistic claim, about the nature of moral language. That\nclaim is:\n\nAnalytic Naturalism: Our moral claims are\nsynonymous with certain (highly complex) claims in the\nnatural sciences.\n\nIt might be tempting to say that moral naturalism is the conjunction\nof these five claims, but there is a strong tension between\nMethodological Naturalism and Analytic Naturalism. If Analytic\nNaturalism is true, then it should be possible to analyze moral claims\nand show what claims in the natural sciences they are synonymous with.\nBut if this is possible, then substantive moral principles are\nknowable not via scientific methods but via a priori conceptual\nanalysis. Analytic Naturalism therefore seems to entail that\nMethodological Naturalism is false, and vice versa. Naturalists who\naccept Analytic Naturalism are called, appropriately enough, analytic\nnaturalists. Naturalists who reject Analytic Naturalism are synthetic\nnaturalists.\n\nThis distinction between analytic naturalism and synthetic naturalism\ncreates further trouble for our ability to characterize moral\nnaturalism. If moral naturalism is the view that moral facts are known\nby empirical methods, then analytic naturalism is not a version of\nnaturalism at all (Flanagan, Sarkissian, and Wong 2016). Yet many\nwould resist the suggestion that analytic naturalists aren\u2019t\nnaturalists, since the term \u201cmoral naturalism\u201d was coined\nto refer to analytic naturalism; synthetic naturalism is a relatively\nrecent entrant to the metaethical scene.\n\nPerhaps we can resolve this conflict by recalling the difference\nbetween particular moral facts and moral principles. Analytic\nnaturalists agree with synthetic naturalists that we should be able to\ninvestigate particular moral facts empirically. An analytic naturalist\nwho held that \u2018good\u2019 was synonymous with\n\u2018pleasurable\u2019 (e.g.) would agree that whether or not a\nparticular action instantiates goodness/pleasure is the sort of thing\nwe can investigate empirically. And synthetic naturalists agree with\nanalytic naturalists that certain claims about the relations between\nour moral concepts, like \u201cif it is morally required to help\nothers, then it is not morally forbidden to help others,\u201d can be\nanalytic and knowable a priori (although see Howard and Laskowski\n2021). What is primarily at issue in the debate between analytic and\nsynthetic naturalists is the status of claims about moral principles.\nAnalytic naturalists hold that these claims are analytic; synthetic\nnaturalists hold that they are not. So if we define moral naturalism\nin terms of Property Naturalism and remain neutral on Fact Naturalism,\nthis sidesteps the question of the nature of moral principles; perhaps\nthis can mend the rift between analytic and synthetic naturalists. But\nquestions about the nature of moral principles seem awfully to the\nmetaphysics of morality, so perhaps we don\u2019t want to sidestep\nthem. And Property Naturalism doesn\u2019t help answer the earlier\nworries we had about how to characterize moral naturalism: What\nproperties are the kinds of properties that can be investigated by\nscientific methods, and what methods for investigating those\nproperties are the scientific ones?\n\nOne more characterization of moral naturalism is worth mentioning. It\nis increasingly popular to think that appeals to the notion of\n\u201cgrounding\u201d can help clear up what is at stake in a\nvariety of metaphysical debates, and so some believe that we can\nexplain naturalism in terms of grounding:\n\nGrounded Naturalism: All moral facts are fully\ngrounded in non-normative facts (Rosen 2017a).\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if this draws the line between naturalism and\nnon-naturalism in the right place. One problem is that it\u2019s\ncontroversial what the relationship between \u201cnatural\nfacts\u201d and \u201cnon-normative facts\u201d is (see Section 4.2\nbelow). Another problem is that \u201cgrounding\u201d is itself a\nhighly contested notion. \u201cGrounding\u201d refers to some sort\nof asymmetric determination relation which is supposed to be\n\u201calmost maximally intimate\u201d (Rosen 2017a, 157). It is\n\u201calmost\u201d maximally intimate because the maximally intimate\nrelation is identity, but grounding is not identity; unlike identity,\ngrounding is asymmetric. Non-naturalists would reject the idea that\nmoral facts are identical to non-normative facts. But grounding is\nnot identity; so why can\u2019t non-naturalists say\nthat the relationship between the moral and the non-normative is\nalmost maximally intimate? Some self-described\nnon-naturalists say that moral facts are entirely grounded in\nnon-normative facts (Moore 1942; Bader 2017; compare Leary ms \u2013\nsee Other Internet Resources). What\u2019s wrong with that? What does\nit mean for a relation to be \u201calmost\u201d maximally intimate\nin the first place?\n\nSometimes philosophers clarify the notion of grounding by saying that\nthe grounded facts are \u201cnothing over and above\u201d the\ngrounding facts (Rosen 2017a, 157). But putting things this way\nthreatens to show too much. If moral facts are \u201cnothing over and\nabove\u201d the non-normative facts, then moral facts would\napparently have to be non-normative facts; normativity seems to count\nas something \u201cover and above\u201d non-normativity. But many\nmoral naturalists say that moral facts are normative (again, see\nSection 4.2). Perhaps it is coherent to say that the normative is\n\u201cnothing over and above\u201d the non-normative; many good\nphilosophers speak this way and we shouldn\u2019t write them off as\nconfused. But \u201cnothing over and above\u201d is no more clear\nthan \u201calmost maximally intimate.\u201d So we lack a clear\npicture of what grounding consists in, and it\u2019s consequently\nunclear why non-naturalists can\u2019t say that moral facts are fully\ngrounded in non-normative facts but naturalists can.\n\nWe could say that naturalism is the view that moral facts are grounded\nin natural facts rather than in non-normative facts\n(Chilovi and Wodak 2022). It\u2019s (arguably) clearer why this is\nthe sort of thing that naturalists would want to say and\nnon-naturalists wouldn\u2019t, but this formulation doesn\u2019t\nhelp us understand what natural facts are in the first place.\n\nAll moral naturalists will agree with the claim that morality is\nnatural. But there\u2019s depressingly little agreement on how to\nunderstand the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of morality. It\u2019s all a\nbit of a muddle.\n2. Descriptivism and Reductivism\n\nThis section will look at two views closely associated with\nnaturalism, descriptivism and reductivism. Many philosophers who call\nthemselves descriptivists or reductivists also call themselves\nnaturalists (or at least end up taking the same side as self-described\nnaturalists in many metaethical debates). Perhaps we can usefully\ncharacterize naturalism in terms of either of these views.\n\nNaturalism as Descriptivism: Moral facts are natural\nfacts if and only if (and because) descriptivism is true.\n\nNaturalism as Reductivism: Moral facts are natural\nfacts if and only if (and because) reductivism is true.\n\nMore modestly, even if Naturalism as Descriptivism and Naturalism as\nReductivism don\u2019t pan out, we might prefer to just focus on\ndescriptivism or reductivism as interesting views that capture many of\nthe same ideas that incline philosophers toward naturalism.\n2.1 Descriptivism\n\nMany philosophers have found it intuitive that there is a distinction\nbetween terms like \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018bad,\u2019\n\u2018right,\u2019 \u2018wrong,\u2019 or \u2018reason,\u2019 on\nthe one hand and terms like \u2018pink,\u2019 \u2018shiny,\u2019\n\u2018bigger than a bread box,\u2019 or \u2018pleasurable\u2019 on\nthe other. The terms on the first list are called normative\nterms while the terms in the second list are descriptive\nterms. It is (mostly) uncontroversial that moral terms are\nnormative terms; so, if we refer to moral properties using moral terms\n(contra some expressivists and some error theorists), some normative\nterms refer to moral properties. Moral descriptivism is the\nview that some descriptive terms refer to moral properties as well\n(Heathwood 2009).\n\nMoral descriptivism is closely related to moral naturalism. Let us\nassume, as seems plausible, that the things that scientists\ninvestigate are things that can be referred to with descriptive\nlanguage. Good science doesn\u2019t moralize, it just says how things\nare. If this assumption is correct, then analytic naturalism entails\ndescriptivism. If moral claims are synonymous with scientific claims\nand scientific claims are made using descriptive language, then moral\nclaims are synonymous with descriptive claims. Moral terms refer to\nmoral properties; any synonymous terms would refer to those same\nproperties; therefore, there are descriptive terms that refer to moral\nproperties.\n\nSynthetic naturalists can be descriptivists, too. According to\nsynthetic descriptivism, there are descriptive terms that refer to\nmoral properties, but this is not so in virtue of any analytic\nrelation between normative and descriptive terminology. Rather, the\nsynthetic descriptivist argues for the existence of synthetic property\nidentity claims. The paradigm synthetic property identity is\n\u201cwater is H2O.\u201d \u2018Water\u2019 and\n\u2018H2O\u2019 are just two different labels for the\nsame thing. But \u2018H2O\u2019 is not the definition of\n\u2018water;\u2019 that water is H2O was not, and could\nnot have been, discovered by pure conceptual analysis. It is a\nsynthetic truth known a posteriori. Synthetic descriptivists hold that\ndescriptive terms which refer to moral properties reveal synthetic\nproperty identities, just as in the case of water and\nH2O.\n\nHowever, even though analytic naturalism entails descriptivism and\nsynthetic naturalism is consistent with descriptivism, Naturalism as\nDescriptivism is false. The first problem is that many supernatural\nterms are descriptive. So it\u2019s possible that moral properties\nare supernatural (e.g. divine) properties and descriptive terms refer\nto those moral, supernatural properties. In this case, descriptivism\nwould be true and naturalism false (Sturgeon 2009).\n\nAnother serious problem for Naturalism as Descriptivism is that, while\nanalytic naturalism entails descriptivism, synthetic naturalism\ndoesn\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason why facts that can be\nempirically investigated and fit comfortably with a scientific\nworldview must be referred to with descriptive terminology. A\nnaturalist can say that goodness is a natural property that is known\nvia empirical methods and features in causal explanations, and the\nonly term that refers to goodness is \u2018goodness.\u2019 Jonathan\nDancy calls this non-descriptivist naturalism \u201cone-term\nnaturalism,\u201d since one-term naturalists say that there is only\none term \u2013 a moral term \u2013 that refers to moral properties\n(Dancy 2006).\n\nIncidentally, because naturalism doesn\u2019t entail descriptivism,\none common challenge to naturalism fails: \u201cYou say that goodness\n(e.g.) is a natural property, but which natural property is it?\u201d\nFor a naturalist may reply: \u201cGoodness is a natural property. The\nonly natural property that goodness is identical to is itself:\ngoodness.\u201d This is a coherent and complete answer to the\nchallenge (Sturgeon 2003). The challenger seems to be demanding that\nthe naturalist pick out the property of goodness using descriptive\nterminology. This is an apt challenge to descriptivism but not to\nnaturalism. One-term naturalists are not descriptivists (V\u00e4yrynen\n2021).\n\nBut while Naturalism as Descriptivism seems like a non-starter,\nperhaps descriptivism is an interesting view in its own right. We\nmight even prefer to talk about descriptivism rather than naturalism\nin light of our difficulties with characterizing naturalism.\nUnfortunately, there are also problems with characterizing\ndescriptivism.\n\nOne problem is that it\u2019s actually rather easy to refer to moral\nproperties with descriptive terminology. Goodness was the primary\nsubject of G.E. Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica. So the phrase\n\u2018the subject of Principia Ethica\u2019 refers to\ngoodness, and that phrase uses only descriptive terminology. But this\nisn\u2019t a proof of descriptivism; descriptivists want some\nstronger relation between descriptive language and moral properties.\nBut it\u2019s hard to say what that stronger relation might be.\n\nA second problem is the existence of \u201cthick\u201d normative\nterminology, which apparently expresses both descriptive and normative\nconcepts, or perhaps concepts that are both descriptive and normative.\nCommon examples include \u2018brave\u2019 (and other virtue terms),\n\u2018cruel,\u2019 or even, perhaps, \u2018pleasurable\u2019\n(Roberts 2017, 212). Frank Jackson (1998) proposes that thick\nterminology, and any other terminology about which there could be\ndoubt as to classification, should be considered normative. Perhaps\nthat solves the problem.\n\nA third problem concerns our method for characterizing normative and\ndescriptive terminology. We started out with two contrasting lists of\nterminology, saying that one of the lists was a list of normative\nterminology and the other list, the \u201ceverything else\u201d\nlist, was a list of descriptive terminology. But our list of normative\nterminology was incomplete. Normative terminology includes everything\non that list and all other terminology that is similar. But what does\nall this normative terminology have in common in the first place? What\nmakes a term normative? One way of characterizing normative\nterminology is broadly functional: normative terminology expresses\nthoughts which regulate our actions in certain ways. But embracing a\nfunctional account of normative terminology cedes much ground to\nexpressivists, who hold that the meaning of normative terminology just\nis to express action-regulating states. And characterizing normative\nterminology in functional terms also deprives moral realists (and thus\nmoral naturalists) of one of their main arguments for realism, since\nthe existence of moral facts may no longer be read directly off of the\nsemantics of moral terms (Eklund 2017). For that reason, some realists\nprefer to characterize normative terminology in referential terms:\nnormative terminology is terminology that refers to normative\nproperties (Hernandez and Laskowski 2021). But if we give a\nreferential characterization of normative terminology, it\u2019s no\nlonger obvious how to draw our distinction between normative and\ndescriptive terminology. If a bit of terminology that we would\nintuitively put on the list of descriptive terminology ends up\nreferring to a moral property (which happens, according to\ndescriptivists!), then that terminology is ipso facto normative. So on\na referential account, which terms count as normative and which count\nas descriptive is not discoverable by simple reflection on the\nmeanings of the terms, but must instead involve substantial ethical\nand metaethical theorizing. A referential account of normative\nterminology would also threaten to render descriptivism incoherent,\nsince any terminology which referred to a moral property would be\nnormative rather than descriptive.\n2.2 Reductivism\n\nAnother view that is often closely associated with naturalism is\n\u201creductivism.\u201d The reductivist says that moral properties\nreduce to some other kind of property. Again, we might be interested\neither in Naturalism as Reductivism as an ambitious attempt to\ncharacterize moral naturalism, or just in reductivism as an\ninteresting view in its own right. Unfortunately, it is unclear what\nit means for one property to reduce to another. \u2018Reduce\u2019\nis a philosopher\u2019s term of art, but it is used in very different\nways by different philosophers. We\u2019re in for another muddle; but\nlet\u2019s try to clear things up a bit.\n\nWe should note at the outset that there is a paradigm example of a\nreductive view, which is used almost every time a metaethicist\ndiscussing reductivism needs a toy example to play with. That paradigm\nis the hedonic reduction: that goodness is pleasure and\ntherefore reduces to pleasure. This introduces a key\ndesideratum of any account of reduction: that it should count the\nhedonic reduction as a reductive view.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s begin with one of the clearest things written\nabout reduction. Here\u2019s Nicholas Sturgeon:\n\n\nNaturalism is in one clear sense a \u2018reductionist\u2019 doctrine\nof course, for it holds that moral facts are nothing but natural\nfacts. What I deny, however, is that from this metaphysical doctrine\nabout what sort of facts moral facts are, anything follows about the\npossibility of reduction in another sense (to which I shall henceforth\nconfine the term) more familiar from the philosophical literature:\nthat is, about whether moral expressions can be given reductive\ndefinitions in some distinctive nonmoral vocabulary, in which any\nplausible moral explanations could then be recast (Sturgeon 1988,\n239\u2013240).\n\n\nSturgeon here distinguishes two distinct senses of the term\n\u2018reduction.\u2019 One is linguistic. A term can be reduced to\nanother term just in case the first term can be defined in terms of\nthe second. In this sense, reductivism is just another name for\nanalytic naturalism. In later work, Sturgeon mentions the possibility\nof \u201csynthetic reductions\u201d (Sturgeon 2009), so I think\nit\u2019s more accurate to say that Sturgeon\u2019s reductivism is\nanother name for descriptivism. Note that the hedonic reduction is a\ndescriptivist view since it states that the descriptive term\n\u2018pleasure\u2019 refers to the moral property of goodness. So\nthe linguistic sense of \u2018reduction\u2019 as another name for\ndescriptivism satisfies our key desideratum.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a second to clear up another perennial source of\nconfusion about how metaethical terminology is used. Sturgeon and the\nother Cornell realists (see Section 6) call themselves\n\u201cnon-reductive\u201d naturalists; but when they say this, they\naren\u2019t describing any distinctive metaphysical commitments of\ntheir view. They are simply rejecting descriptivism. Sturgeon, at\nleast, is perfectly clear about this in the above quote. There are\nmetaphysical doctrines associated with Cornell realism, of course,\n(again, see Section 6). But as the Cornell realists used that term,\n\u201cnon-reductive\u201d naturalism is just naturalism without\ndescriptivism, i.e. one-term naturalism.\n\nIf we understand \u2018reduction\u2019 in its linguistic sense,\nreductivism is synonymous with descriptivism, and so we have a\nredundant bit of terminology. That\u2019s a good reason to understand\nreductivism as a distinct, metaphysical doctrine. So: what is a\nmetaphysical reduction? We might look to general metaphysics for help\nhere. Unfortunately, metaphysicians use the term \u2018reduce\u2019\nin lots of different ways; there is no one standard account for us to\nborrow (Stoljar 2010, 161\u2013162; McPherson 2015). But perhaps we\ncan get a sense of the general idea. In recent years, there has been a\nproliferation of terms within metaphysics that all seem to be aimed at\ncapturing the same idea: we can say what something is composed of, or\nwhat it is grounded in, or what it reduces to, or what the real\ndefinition of a thing is, and all of those locutions seem to be aimed\nat capturing the same thought (Rosen 2015). All of these locutions are\nways of articulating what it is to be some thing by saying\nwhat it is made of (compare Schroeder 2005; Schroeder 2016).\nOne key idea here is that if A reduces to B, then A is less\nfundamental than B (Laskowski 2020). Let\u2019s call this the\nFundamentality Platitude.\n\nIf we understand reductivism as a metaphysical thesis about\nfundamentality, per the Fundamentality Platitude, we can make a\nplausible case for Naturalism as Reductivism. Any naturalist will say\nthat the fundamental entities are the sorts of objects and properties\nthat are the subject matter of fundamental physics: bosons and leptons\n(etc.) with their spin and mass (etc.). Goodness is not one of those\nfundamental physical properties; goodness is a higher-level property\nwhich is ultimately composed of fundamental physical properties, the\nsame as any other natural property. Naturalists are, in this way,\nmetaphysical reductivists. And because non-naturalists deny that moral\nproperties are natural, their account of the nature of moral\nproperties is not constrained by the physicist\u2019s account of\nfundamental properties. A non-naturalist might well say that some\nmoral properties are metaphysically fundamental. So naturalists say,\nwhereas non-naturalists may deny, that all moral properties reduce to\nnon-moral, physical properties. That\u2019s Naturalism as\nReductivism..\n\nHowever, there are problems with this argument. First, supernatural\nproperties cause trouble again. If moral properties are reducible to\nsupernatural properties, then reductivism is true and naturalism false\n(Sturgeon 2009). As before, we could try to finesse this by talking\nabout \u201creductive naturalism,\u201d the view that moral\nproperties reduce to natural properties, in particular. Many\nphilosophers do speak this way. But we can\u2019t characterize\nnaturalism as the view that moral properties reduce to natural\nproperties unless we already know what natural properties are. So talk\nof reductive naturalism means giving up on Naturalism as\nReductivism.\n\nSo let\u2019s set aside the more ambitious Naturalism as Reductivism\nand just focus on reductivism as a potentially interesting and\nimportant view in its own right. Unfortunately, there are problems\nwith giving a useful metaphysical characterization of reductivism.\nConsider the hedonic reduction: that goodness reduces to pleasure in\nvirtue of being identical to pleasure. Some philosophers defend the\nidea that pleasure is metaphysically fundamental. If we combine\npleasure fundamentalism with the hedonic reduction, we end up with the\nview that goodness is both reducible and fundamental (McPherson and\nPlunkett forthcoming). So depending on what we say about the\nmetaphysics of pleasure, the hedonic reduction may not be consistent\nwith the Fundamentality Platitude..\n\nThere\u2019s a larger problem lurking here. We\u2019ve characterized\ntwo different ideas as key to contemporary discussions of reduction in\nmetaethics: the Fundamentality Platitude and the hedonic reduction.\nThe hedonic reduction counts as a reductive view because of another\nplatitude about reduction: that identity entails reduction. Call that\nthe Identity Platitude. Here\u2019s Graham Oddie:\n\n\nExactly what is reduction? Take two kinds of entities, Type-A entities\nand Type-B entities. Although reduction is a contested notion, here is\nan undeniably sufficient condition for the reducibility of\ntype-A entities to type-B entities: every type-A entity is\nidentical to some type-B entity. (Oddie 2005, 15, italics in\noriginal)\n\n\nThe larger problem is that the Identity Platitude and the\nFundamentality Platitude are inconsistent. Identity is a symmetric\nrelation, but being-less-fundamental-than is an asymmetric relation,\nso nothing can satisfy both of those platitudes. If reduction is\nasymmetric, then reduction is not entailed by identity, and so the\nIdentity Platitude is false. If reduction is not asymmetric, then the\nfact that A reduces to B doesn\u2019t entail that A is less\nfundamental than B, and so the Fundamentality Platitude is false.\n\nHere\u2019s another way to demonstrate the point. Consider a close\ncousin of the hedonic reduction, the view that rightness is identical\nto conducing-to-pleasure. Conducing-to-pleasure is a complex property,\ncomposed of pleasure, conducing, and perhaps some abstract structural\nelements. On this view, rightness is identical to\nconducing-to-pleasure, and rightness is composed of and less\nfundamental than conducing and pleasure. So rightness stands in a\ndifferent relation to the complex conducing-to-pleasure than it does\nto the simpler elements. Which of those two relations is the reduction\nrelation? \u2018Reduction\u2019 is a term of art; it means whatever\nphilosophers mean by it. And, unfortunately, philosophers use the term\n\u2018reduction\u2019 to refer to both of those relations. So not\nonly is \u2018reduction\u2019 ambiguous between a linguistic and a\nmetaphysical concept, there\u2019s a further ambiguity in the\nmetaphysical use of the term.\n\nLet\u2019s sum up the discussion thus far. We were looking for an apt\ncharacterization of moral naturalism, and had a hard time finding one.\nWe then looked at two ways of characterizing naturalism in terms of\nother theses associated with naturalism: descriptivism and\nreductivism. We found that there are substantial problems with\ncharacterizing naturalism in terms of either descriptivism or\nreductivism, and that there are further problems with trying to\ncharacterize descriptivism and reductivism themselves. So while\nphilosophers frequently use the terms \u2018naturalism,\u2019\n\u2018descriptivism,\u2019 and \u2018reductivism\u2019 when\ndescribing various metaethical views, there\u2019s no way to define\nthose terms that isn\u2019t highly controversial. In light of this\ndepressing and distressing realization, there\u2019s only one thing\nto be done: ignore all of this and press on as though we know what\nwe\u2019re talking about when we use these terms. That is,\nunfortunately, what philosophers in this area tend to do. So even\nthough there\u2019s little agreement about what naturalism is,\nlet\u2019s see what philosophers have said about naturalism.\n3. Why be a Moral Naturalist?\n\nMoral naturalism is a very popular view (although it might be more\naccurate to say that \u201cmoral naturalism\u201d is a popular\nlabel\u2026). That\u2019s because moral naturalism is the\nconjunction of two views that are themselves very popular. The first\nis naturalism: that everything which exists is natural. The second is\nmoral realism: that stance-independent moral facts exist. Combine\nthese two, and we get the conclusion that moral facts (exist and) are\nstance-independent natural facts. Thus:\n\nThe Basic Argument for Moral Naturalism\n\n1.\nNaturalism\n2.\nMoral Realism\n3.\nTherefore, Moral Naturalism\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll look at more technical arguments for moral naturalism\nshortly, but the Basic Argument is the reason why so many\nmetaethicists have a default sympathy for moral naturalism. It\u2019s\na popular conjunction of two popular views. Naturalism has proven to\nbe the most successful project, ever, for advancing human knowledge\nand understanding. The success of naturalism doesn\u2019t entail that\nthat nothing exists which can\u2019t be accounted for\nnaturalistically, nor does it entail that there are no other projects\nthat could successfully advance human knowledge and understanding. But\nmany philosophers suspect that empirical methods have been so\ndramatically successful in shedding light on so many different areas\nof inquiry because some version of naturalism is correct.\n(Non-naturalists disagree, of course!)\n\nSimilarly, moral realism is a popular view. There are many different\nmoral claims \u2013 that rape and murder are wrong, for instance, or\nthat helping others in need is good \u2013 that have the status of\ncommon sense. We treat these common sense moral claims, at least\nimplicitly, as accurately describing reality and not being mere\nmatters of opinion. Moral realism is popular precisely because it\npromises to do justice to this common attitude towards our moral\ncommitments. (Anti-realists disagree, of course!)\n3.1 Arguments from Supervenience\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the more technical arguments for naturalism. There\nare two distinct arguments for moral naturalism that begin from the\npremise that the moral supervenes on the natural.\n\nSupervenience: There are no two metaphysically\npossible worlds where the natural facts are the same but the moral\nfacts are different.\n\nAs we saw in Section 1, any two worlds that are identical with respect\nto the moral facts are identical with respect to both moral principles\nand instantiations of moral properties. So Supervenience entails the\nrelated claim that no two metaphysically possible worlds have the same\ndistribution of natural properties and a different distribution of\nmoral properties.\n\nThe first argument, the Direct Argument, comes from Frank Jackson\n(Jackson 1998, 118ff. See also Streumer 2008; Brown 2011; Clarke\n2019). Supervenience is the first premise of the Direct Argument. The\nsecond is\n\nIntensionalism: If it is metaphysically necessary\nthat something has property F if and only if it has property\nG, then F and G are the same property.\n\nIntensionalism and Supervenience together entail naturalism. Consider\nthe moral property of wrongness. Every wrong action has some natural\nfeatures; call the features of a given wrong action \\(N_1\\).\nSupervenience entails that any action with \\(N_1\\) is necessarily\nwrong. Of course, there is more than one action that is wrong, but the\nargument generalizes. Call the natural features of a second wrong\naction \\(N_2\\). Supervenience entails that any action with \\(N_2\\) is\nnecessarily wrong. And so on, for all natural features of wrong\nactions \\(N_1 \\ldots N_n\\). Now consider the disjunctive property\n(\\(N_1\\) or \\(N_2\\) or \u2026 \\(N_n\\)). Let\u2019s call that\ndisjunctive property \\(N\\). Because \\(N\\) is a disjunction of natural\nproperties, it is itself a natural property. Any action that has \\(N\\)\nis necessarily wrong. And because \\(N\\) is the disjunction of the\nnatural features of all morally wrong actions, any action that is\nwrong necessarily has \\(N\\). So, necessarily, an action is wrong if\nand only if it has \\(N\\). Therefore, by Intensionalism, wrongness is\nidentical to \\(N\\). And because \\(N\\) is a natural property, wrongness\nis a natural property. QED.\n\nThe most obvious way to object to the Direct Argument is to reject\nIntensionalism (see, e.g., Bader 2017). A common example in the debate\nover Intensionalism is the pair of properties being\ntriangular and being trilateral. Necessarily, anything\nthat has one property has the other: if a figure has three angles, it\nalso has three sides (Bealer 1982). Enemies of Intensionalism say the\ntwo properties aren\u2019t the same: one property is a property\nfigures have in virtue of the number of angles they possess, while the\nother is a property figures have in virtue of the number of sides they\npossess. Defenders of Intensionalism say that these are the same\nproperty: there\u2019s no difference between being three-sided and\nbeing three-angled, and that\u2019s precisely because those\nproperties are necessarily co-instantiated. This is an ongoing debate\nin metaphysics.\n\nThe Direct Argument also relies on the assumption that disjunctions of\nnatural properties are natural properties, but that\u2019s a dubious\nassumption. Many would claim that disjunctions of properties\naren\u2019t properties at all, or at least not the right kind of\nproperties (Kim 1993; Majors 2005; McPherson 2015; Klocksiem 2019).\nFor other criticisms of the Direct Argument, see Wedgwood (2007, Ch.\n9) and Dunaway (2015).\n\nThe second argument from Supervenience is the Explanatory Argument.\nThis argument was developed by RM Hare and Simon Blackburn (Hare 1952;\nBlackburn 1993), but the contemporary canonical formulation comes from\nTristram McPherson (2011). According to the Explanatory Argument,\nsupervenience is a striking phenomenon that must be explained. An\ninability to explain supervenience counts strongly against a view.\nNaturalists are well-positioned to explain supervenience: if moral\nfacts are natural facts, then, trivially, there can be no difference\nin the moral facts without a difference in the natural facts. But\nit\u2019s not clear how other views \u2013 particularly\nnon-naturalism, but perhaps also quasi-realist expressivism (Sturgeon\n2009; Dreier 2015) \u2013 can explain supervenience.\n\nThe most obvious way to respond to the Explanatory Argument is to\noffer an explanation of supervenience that doesn\u2019t trade on\nnaturalist assumptions. For example, Russ Shafer-Landau (2003, Ch 4)\nand David Enoch (2011, Ch 6) have argued that supervenience can be\nexplained by the fact that there are moral laws. Ralf Bader (2017)\nargues that there is a distinct sort of normative grounding relation\nwhich both explains supervenience and doesn\u2019t entail property\nidentity (but see Morton (2020)). And Stephanie Leary (2017) has\nargued that there are hybrid normative properties whose essences\nexplain supervenience (but see Faraci (2017); Toppinen (2018)).\n\nA bolder response denies supervenience altogether. Supervenience is\nwidely accepted, but not uncontroversial (Roberts 2018). Sturgeon\n(2009) accepts supervenience, but his reasons for doing so are\n\u201cparochial:\u201d he is a naturalist and naturalism entails\nsupervenience. But Sturgeon sees no reason why anyone who\u2019s not\na naturalist should accept the doctrine. Several non-naturalists,\nincluding, most notably, Gideon Rosen (2017b) and Kit Fine (2002),\nhave shared this assessment of the dialectical situation and rejected\nSupervenience. Fine and Rosen argue that moral principles are not\nmetaphysically necessary but are, instead,\nnormatively necessary, where normative necessity is weaker\nthan metaphysical necessity but still quite strong. It\u2019s easy\nfor non-naturalists to explain the normative necessity of moral\nprinciples, so non-naturalists can explain everything that needs to be\nexplained. If Supervenience is false, then both the Direct Argument\nand the Explanatory Argument fail.\n3.2 Arguments from Anti-Skepticism\n\nA second family of arguments for naturalism are epistemic. Scientific\nmethods (broadly construed) are very powerful tools for coming to have\nknowledge of the world so, if moral facts are the kinds of facts that\nwe can know about by scientific methods, then we have powerful tools\nfor obtaining moral knowledge. Non-naturalists, by contrast, say that\nwe know about moral facts via non-empirical methods, typically\nintuition. This seems like a much less firm footing for our moral\nknowledge than the scientific method. This is controversial, of\ncourse. Intuitionist moral epistemology is popular (Huemer 2005;\nChudnoff 2013; Bengson, Cuneo, and Shafer-Landau 2020). And it\u2019s\nnot clear how we can use empirical methods to learn about moral facts\n(although we\u2019ll look at some proposals in Sections 5\u20137)\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, Ch 3). But it\u2019s widely believed that moral\nnaturalists have an easier time answering moral skeptics than\nnon-naturalists, and that\u2019s a reason to be a moral\nnaturalist.\n\nLet\u2019s sharpen this point by looking at one influential family of\nskeptical challenges: explanationist challenges. Explanationist\nchallenges begin from the premise that our moral beliefs are explained\nby something other than the moral facts. What else? Different versions\nof the explanationist challenge focus on different things. According\nto the traditional version of the challenge from Gilbert Harman, our\nmoral beliefs are explained by our personal psychological attitudes\n(Harman 1977, Ch 1). Other versions of the explanationist challenge\nfocus on more distant causes of our moral beliefs. Disagreement\narguments note that moral beliefs tend to cluster along cultural\nlines, which suggests that our moral beliefs are explained by cultural\npressures (Mackie 1977, 37). Evolutionary debunking arguments posit\nthat our moral beliefs are ultimately explained by evolutionary\npressures (Joyce 2006; Street 2006). The common thought is that our\nmoral beliefs are not explained by the moral facts; they\u2019re\nexplained by a tangle of other naturalistic factors. Exactly why this\nwould lead to a skeptical conclusion is controversial, but many\nphilosophers think that explanationist challenges make a strong case\nfor skepticism. (For critical discussion, see, e.g., Enoch 2009;\nFitzPatrick 2015; Vavova 2015; Schechter 2017).\n\nNaturalists have an easy way to answer explanationist challenges. The\nnaturalist claims our moral beliefs are indeed explained by a tangle\nof naturalist facts, but they hold that some of those natural facts\nare the moral facts. For instance, Sturgeon argues that we think\nHitler was evil because Hitler was evil. Hitler\u2019s evil is a\nnatural feature of his character, and that feature both explains why\nHitler did the things that he did and why we judge him harshly as a\nresult (Sturgeon 1988). Similarly, David Copp argues that to be good\njust is to be conducive to social cooperation. So when the\nevolutionary debunker claims that we are naturally inclined, by\nevolution, to think that things which are conducive to social\ncooperation are good, this just amounts to the observation that we\njudge that things are good because they\u2019re good (Copp 2008).\nThis is a compelling enough response that many advocates of\nexplanationist challenges construe them as challenges for\nnon-naturalists, but not for naturalists (Joyce 2006; Bedke 2009; Lutz\n2018).\n4. Objections to Naturalism\n\nWe\u2019ve just seen that there is some reason to think that, if\nthere are any moral properties, those properties are natural. In this\nsection, we\u2019ll look at the most prominent objections to moral\nnaturalism.\n4.1 The Open Question Argument\n\nI said at the beginning of the article that contemporary metaethics\nbegan with G.E. Moore\u2019s rejection of moral naturalism. The\nargument that he deployed against naturalism is known as the Open\nQuestion Argument (OQA). The OQA is perhaps the most influential\nargument in metaethics, although today it is widely held to have\ncrippling flaws. Inevitably, this has inspired many critics of\nnaturalism to find ways to fix up or extend Moore\u2019s argument in\none way or another.\n\nExplaining Moore\u2019s argument is complicated by the fact that his\noriginal statement of the argument, in Sections 5\u201315\n(particularly 13\u201314) of Principia Ethica, is famously\nunclear. Moore himself admitted as much, in an unfinished forward to a\nsecond edition (Sinclair 2019). I won\u2019t engage in Moore exegesis\nhere. I\u2019ll just give a version of the OQA that most contemporary\nmetaethicists would recognize as \u201cthe Open Question\nArgument.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s OQA takes aim at theories of the form \u201cEverything\nthat is N is good,\u201d where \u2018N\u2019 is a\nbit of descriptive terminology that refers to a natural property, and\nwhere claims like this are true in virtue of the meanings of\n\u2018good\u2019 and \u2018N.\u2019 Moore is concerned\nwith goodness because he regards goodness as the most fundamental\nmoral concept, and holds that all moral inquiry is, in the end,\ninquiry into what sorts of things are good. And he\u2019s concerned\nwith theories that are true in virtue of meaning because he believes\nthat there are true claims of the form \u201cEverything that is\nN is good\u201d (for some potentially rather complicated\nN). He just denies that it is analytic that being N\nis the same thing as being good. \u201cIf I am right, then nobody can\nfoist upon us such an axiom as that \u2018Pleasure is the only\ngood\u2019 or that \u2018The good is the desired\u2019 on the\npretense that \u2018this is the very meaning of the\nword.\u2019\u201d (Moore 1903, Sec 6.)\n\nThe OQA relies on a test for theories of the form \u201cAll\nAs are Bs.\u201d The first step is to turn the\nstatement of the theory into a question: \u201cAll As are\nBs\u201d becomes \u201cGiven that x is A,\nis x also B?\u201d Some questions of this kind are\nclosed questions: one can know the answer simply by understanding the\nquestion. \u201cGiven that x is a bachelor, is x\nunmarried?\u201d is a closed question. Anyone who understands the\nmeanings of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and \u2018unmarried\u2019 is in a\nposition to see that the answer to that question must be yes. Anyone\nwho expressed doubt about that question must be incompetent with\neither the concept of bachelor or of unmarried. So\n\u201cAll bachelors are unmarried\u201d passes the test. That claim\nis true in virtue of the meanings of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and\n\u2018unmarried,\u2019 and so being unmarried is part of the essence\nof what it is to be a bachelor. Now consider the theory that pleasure\nis goodness. We can ask \u201cGranted that x is pleasurable,\nis x good?\u201d And this question is open. Someone can\nunderstand it perfectly and still reasonably doubt the answer. So the\ntheory that pleasure is goodness fails the open question test;\npleasure cannot be identical to goodness. The argument generalizes:\nFor any natural property N and any moral property M,\n\u201cGranted that x is N, is x\nM?\u201d will be an open question. Therefore, no moral\nproperty M is identical to any natural property\nN.\n\nThe most obvious problem with this argument is that it\u2019s not\nreally an argument against naturalism at all. It is, instead, an\nargument against analytic descriptivism. That is, it\u2019s an\nargument against the claim that there is some descriptive term\n\u2018N\u2019 that necessarily refers to a moral property\nM in virtue of the fact that there is a normative term\n\u2018M\u2019 that refers to M, and\n\u2018N\u2019 follows from a conceptual analysis of\n\u2018M\u2019 (Feldman 2005; Vessel 2020). But as we saw in\nSection 2.1, analytic descriptivism is not the same thing as\nnaturalism. Some naturalists are synthetic descriptivists, who hold\nthat \u2018N\u2019 necessarily refers to M, but\nthat this is established empirically rather than by conceptual\nanalysis (Brink 1989, Ch 6; Brink 2001). And one-term naturalists hold\nthat there is no descriptive term that necessarily refers to any moral\nproperty (Sturgeon 2003; V\u00e4yrynen 2021). The OQA has no force\nagainst either of these views. For these reasons, the common verdict\ntoday among metaethicists is that \u2013 unless it can be\nsubstantially modified or extended in some way \u2013 the OQA has no\nforce against naturalism.\n\nIn Moore\u2019s defense, even though he overlooked the possibility of\nsynthetic descriptivism and one-term naturalism, those views were not\nyet developed at the time he first outlined the OQA. Indeed, they were\ndeveloped by naturalist philosophers who recognized the force of the\nOQA against analytic descriptivism and so set out looking for other\nnaturalistic views that could evade the OQA. Rather than thinking of\nthese other naturalistic views as an oversight of Moore\u2019s, we\ncould just as easily give him credit for pointing others in their\ndirection.\n\nMost philosophers think that the OQA does succeed in refuting analytic\ndescriptivism, yet analytic descriptivists have developed several\nresponses to the OQA. One traditional response, from William Frankena\n(1939), says that the OQA begs the question. To an analytic\ndescriptivist who sincerely holds that, e.g., pleasure is the\ndefinition of goodness, the question \u201cGiven that X is\npleasurable, is it good?\u201d will seem closed. So whether that\nquestion is open or closed is precisely what is at issue, so Moore\nshouldn\u2019t claim that it is open without further argument.\nAnother traditional response appeals to the idea of the Paradox of\nAnalysis: if all analytic claims are obvious, then it\u2019s\nimpossible for there to be an interesting, informative conceptual\nanalysis. Since some conceptual analyses are interesting and\ninformative (we philosophers tell ourselves, desperately), not all\nanalytic claims are obvious. The OQA is a test of obvious analyticity,\nbut the correct definitions of moral terms might just be non-obvious\n(Smith 1994, 37\u201339). Another response begins from the\nobservation that Moore gives only a handful of examples of\nnaturalistic analyses and generalizes to the conclusion that any\nproposed analysis of moral terms must be wrong. That\u2019s an\nawfully hasty generalization. It\u2019s not clear that this worry can\nbe addressed by providing any finite number of additional failed\nanalyses. If \u2018goodness\u2019 (e.g.) can be analyzed, it can\npresumably be analyzed in one correct way, and all of the infinite\nother possible analyses are false. So the hypothesis that\n\u2018goodness\u2019 can be analyzed predicts that there are an\ninfinite number of incorrect analyses of \u2018goodness.\u2019 A\nhypothesis can\u2019t be refuted by data that it predicts, so even an\ninfinite number of incorrect analyses doesn\u2019t refute analytic\ndescriptivism (Finlay 2014, Ch 1).\n4.2 The Normativity and Triviality Objections\n\nAlthough Moore\u2019s version of the Open Question Argument today has\nfew defenders, there have been a number of recent attempts to\nrefashion it into a more compelling form. One popular version of the\nOpen Question Argument, called the Normativity Objection (see, e.g.,\nParfit 2011; Scanlon 2014), sidesteps questions about the cognitive\nsignificance of moral and descriptive terminology and appeals to\nconsiderations regarding the natures of natural and normative facts.\nMoral facts are normative. They concern what is good and what we have\nreasons or obligations to do. Natural facts \u2013 the kinds of facts\nthat scientists study \u2013 are facts about the innate physical\nstructure of the universe and the causal principles that govern the\ninteraction of matter. Those are obviously just two different kinds of\nfacts; moral facts are normative but natural facts are not. In trying\nto give a naturalistic account of morality, naturalists forgot the\nmost important thing: that moral facts aren\u2019t purely facts about\nthe way the world is; they are facts about what\nmatters.\n\nThere are, generally, two ways in which a naturalist might respond to\nthis objection. First, a naturalist could say that moral facts\naren\u2019t essentially normative; it may be the case that we\ntypically have reasons to act morally, but reason-giving force is not\npart of the essence of moral facts. That suggestion might have the\nfeeling of an absurdity \u2013 of course moral facts are the kinds of\nthings that provide reasons; if an action is morally required,\nthat\u2019s a good reason to do it! But according to some\n\u201creforming definitions\u201d of morality (Brandt 1979; Railton\n1986), this thought is a defect in our conception of morality. It\nwould be more accurate and fruitful to define moral facts in terms\nthat are typically reason-providing but not\nnecessarily reason-providing.\n\nThe biggest problem for reforming definitions is that reason-giving\nnormativity is (arguably) essential to morality. As Joyce\n(2000, Ch. 1) argues, normativity is a non-negotiable commitment of\nour moral discourse. If the only kinds of facts that exist are\nnatural, and natural facts are not a source of reasons for everyone,\nthen this amounts to a proof that moral facts don\u2019t exist (see\nalso Luco 2016). Reformers may respond by calling into question\nJoyce\u2019s notion of \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d commitments. It\nis controversial whether any of our concepts have commitments that are\nnon-negotiable in this way (compare Prinzing 2017). Reformers may also\nreply by pointing out that they\u2019re not entirely giving up on\nnormativity. If moral facts are the kinds of facts that we typically\nhave reason to care about, and there are strong forces in human\nsociety and psychology that lead us to care about moral facts, then\nthey\u2019re normative enough for all practical purposes.\n\nThe second way to respond to the Normativity Objection is to say that\nnormativity is itself a natural phenomenon. The most popular strategy\nfor substantiating natural normativity proceeds in two steps. First,\nshow that all normative concepts can be analyzed in terms of one,\nfundamental normative concept. Second, show that that fundamental\nnormative concept picks out a natural property. There are a number of\nways that such an account could proceed: here are two recent,\ninfluential examples:\n\nMark Schroeder (2005; 2007) accepts the \u201cbuck-passing\u201d\nor \u201creasons first\u201d account of normativity (Scanlon 1998),\nwhich says that all normative concepts can be analyzed in terms of the\nconcept of a reason. Schroeder also accepts the \u201cHumean\u201d\ntheory of reasons (as a substantive, synthetic truth), which says\nthat, roughly, S has a reason to \u03a6 just in case \u03a6-ing will\npromote the satisfaction of one of S\u2019s desires. If the Humean\ntheory is correct, then being a reason is a natural property. And, if\nall other moral facts are to be analyzed in terms of reasons, then all\nmoral facts are natural facts.\nPhillipa Foot (2001) accepts a \u201cvalue first\u201d account\nof normativity, which says that goodness is the fundamental normative\nconcept. She also accepts a neo-Aristotelian account of goodness (see\nSection 5 below for more on neo-Aristotelianism.) If\nneo-Aristotelianism is correct, goodness is a natural property. And if\nall moral facts are to be analyzed in terms of goodness, then all\nmoral facts are natural facts.\n\n\nThis two-step strategy is popular but controversial. Those moved by\nthe Open Question Argument and the Normativity Objection are skeptical\nthat the second step of the naturalizing strategy could ever be\ncompleted. Non-naturalists doubt that it could ever be shown that the\nfundamental normative concept picks out some natural property because\nnormative properties and natural properties just seem to obviously be\ndifferent kinds of properties. Wittgenstein claimed to \u201csee\nclearly, as it were in a flash of light, not only that no description\nthat I can think of would do to describe what I mean by absolute\nvalue, but that I would reject every significant description that\nanybody could possibly suggest, ab initio, on the ground of its\nsignificance\u201d (Wittgenstein 1965). David Enoch (2011) is more\npithy, saying simply that natural properties and normative properties\nare just too different for any natural account of a\nfundamental normative property to be satisfying.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear what this \u201cjust too different\u201d\nintuition amounts to (Laskowski 2019). In what sense are the natural\nand the normative \u201cjust too different?\u201d Schroeder thinks\nthat the intuition has force only if there is \u201ca perfectly\ngeneral single truth about which any reductive view would be forced\ninto error\u201d (Schroeder 2005, 14). The existence of such a truth\nwould be the proof that the natural and normative are just too\ndifferent; without such a truth, the non-naturalist hasn\u2019t\nreally offered an argument against naturalism. But because all\nnormative claims conceptually reduce to claims about reasons, argues\nSchroeder, there will be no such truth, provided that we have a\ncoherent account of the foundational notion of a reason. So a coherent\naccount of normative reasons can explain all normative claims. These\nfundamental normative facts about reasons are themselves explained by\nthe natural facts to which reasons reduce. But because this reduction\nof reasons will take the form of a synthetic reduction, there end up\nbeing no conceptual connections between the normative and the natural.\nThis general lack of conceptual connections between the normative and\nthe natural is what explains the \u201cjust too different\u201d\nintuition, and it is fully compatible with moral naturalism as a\nsynthetic metaphysical truth (see also Copp 2020).\n\nSchroeder\u2019s response may succeed in providing a\nnaturalist-friendly explanation of the \u201cjust too\ndifferent\u201d intuition, but it seems strange to say that the\nexistence of numerous analytic relations between different normative\nconcepts, combined with a lack of analytic relations between normative\nand natural concepts, supports the thesis that the normative is\nnatural. The lack of conceptual connections between the natural and\nnormative may be better explained by non-naturalism (Enoch 2011).\n\nDerek Parfit\u2019s Triviality Objection (Parfit 2011) is another\ncontemporary extension of the Open Question Argument. If moral\nnaturalism is true, says Parfit, then it will be possible to make\nmoral claims and natural claims and have those two claims be about the\nsame fact. Parfit worries that if the two claims are about the same\nfact, then those two claims must contain all the same information. And\na statement of equivalence between any two claims that contain the\nsame information must be trivial. But moral claims that describe the\nrelationships between moral facts and natural facts are not trivial at\nall \u2013 they are highly substantive.\n\nDerek Parfit\u2019s Triviality Objection (Parfit 2011) is another\ncontemporary extension of the Open Question Argument. If moral\nnaturalism is true, says Parfit, then it will be possible to make\nmoral claims and natural claims and have those two claims contain all\nthe same information. And a statement of equivalence between any two\nclaims that contain the same information must be trivial. But moral\nclaims that describe the relationships between moral facts and natural\nfacts are not trivial at all \u2013 they are highly substantive. So\nmoral naturalism is false. However, it is not clear that this\nTriviality Objection is any more forceful than the Open Question\nArgument. Parfit\u2019s central motivating thoughts are that\nnatural-moral identity claims are substantive rather than trivial, and\ntherefore moral claims concern a different kind of fact than natural\nclaims. These are exactly the central thoughts behind Moore\u2019s\nOpen Question Argument, and so naturalists to respond to this\nobjection in largely the same way that they respond to the Open\nQuestion Argument. Naturalists typically respond by adopting a version\nof synthetic naturalism, and arguing that moral-natural identities are\ninformative in the same way that other synthetic property identity\nclaims (like water = H2O) are (Copp 2017).\n\nHaving discussed moral naturalism in general terms, we\u2019ll now\nexamine three of the most popular naturalistic metaethical views in\ndetail. As we go, it will be worth keeping the normativity objection\nin mind. A version of the normativity objection will end up being one\nof the most pressing objections to all of these views.\n5. Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism\n\nAristotelianism has had adherents since\u2026 well, since Aristotle.\nEven in the dark times of the mid-20th century, when naturalism was in\ndisrepute, post-Moore, Aristotelians like Elizabeth Anscombe kept the\nflame alive (Anscombe 1958). Neo-Aristotelianism has both ethical and\nmetaethical commitments. We\u2019ll primarily be looking at the\nmetaethical aspects of neo-Aristotelian naturalism, but first-order\nethics will make an appearance as well.\n\nWe can characterize Aristotelian naturalism by four major ideas. The\nfirst is that there is no one property of goodness. The goodness of a\ngood toaster is different from the goodness of a good movie, which is\ndifferent from the goodness of a good time to dance, which is\ndifferent from the goodness of a good person. To be a good thing is to\nbe a good thing of its kind. The second is that this fact is mirrored\nin our language. The semantics for goodness is attributive rather than\npredicative (more on this shortly). The third is that the most\nfundamental ethical concept is the concept of a good person. Good\nactions are the actions a good person will do, good things are the\nthings that good people will desire or pursue, and good practical\nreasoning is reasoning in the way that good people reason. And the\nfourth is that the standards that make something good are derivable\nfrom the nature of the kind of thing it is. So what makes someone a\ngood person is derivable from the kind of thing a human person is.\nThis implies that morality is derivable from biology \u2013 although\nthis biological conception of human goodness is quite controversial,\neven among Aristotelians.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking what Aristotelians say about the\nsemantics of \u2018good.\u2019 Contemporary Aristotelians follow\nPeter Geach (1956) in distinguishing between two different kinds of\nadjective: attributive and predicative. The difference between the two\ncomes from whether they validate the following inference pattern:\n\nX is an F G.\nX is an H.\nTherefore, X is an F H.\n\n\nIf F is a predicative adjective, that inference will be\nvalid. If F is an attributive adjective, then it won\u2019t.\nTo make this concrete, consider the following instances of this\nschema:\n\nJerry is a brown mouse.\nJerry is an animal.\nTherefore, Jerry is a brown animal.\n\n\n4\u20136 is valid. If Jerry is a brown mouse, then he\u2019s a brown\nanimal. Therefore, \u2018brown\u2019 is a predicative adjective.\nPredicative adjectives refer to the same property in all contexts.\nCompare this to:\n\nJerry is a large mouse.\nJerry is an animal.\nTherefore, Jerry is a large animal.\n\n\n7\u20139 is not valid. A large mouse is still a very small animal.\nTherefore, \u2018large\u2019 is an attributive adjective. The\nmeaning of an attributive adjective in any given context is determined\nby the noun that it is modifying. \u201cLarge mouse\u201d means\n(something like) \u201cLarge for a mouse.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, consider the following argument:\n\nFrank is a good tennis player.\nFrank is a husband and father.\nFrank is a good husband and father.\n\n\nThis is clearly invalid. Frank might have a powerful serve and a\nwicked backhand, yet neglect his family. This indicates that\n\u2018good\u2019 is attributive (although see Szab\u00f3 2001).\n\u2018Good\u2019 does not refer to the same property of goodness in\nall contexts. Instead, \u2018good K\u2019 means something like\n\u2018good-for-a-K.\u2019\n\nJudith Jarvis Thomson has influentially expanded on Geach\u2019s\nbasic idea. According to Thomson, there is a property of being a good\nK only if K is a goodness-fixing kind (Thomson 2008,\n21). For instance, \u201cknife\u201d is a goodness-fixing kind;\nthus, there is the property of being a good knife. Goodness need not\nalways be understood in terms of goodness-fixing kinds. Things can be\ngood in other respects, such as \u201cgood for use in making\ncheesecake\u201d or \u201cgood for Alfred\u201d (Thomson 1997,\n278). Thomson calls things that are good in this way\n\u201cgood-modified.\u201d There is no such thing as \u201ca good\nsmudge,\u201d full stop, because \u201csmudge\u201d is not a\ngoodness-fixing kind in the way \u201cknife\u201d is. But there\nmight be a smudge that is good for using in a Rorschach test, because\n\u201cbeing used in a Rorschach test\u201d is a way that smudges can\nbe good-modified (Thomson 2008, 21\u201322).\n\nThomson holds that it makes no sense to ask whether an act is good or\nnot, because \u201cact\u201d, like \u201csmudge\u201d, is not a\ngoodness-fixing kind. Accordingly, acts can only be good-modified;\nthey can be good in some respect \u2013 e.g., a moral respect. Acts\nare morally good when they spring from an agent\u2019s morally\nvirtuous traits. A moral virtue is any trait such that an individual\nof a kind K is as morally good as a K can be only if it has that trait\n(and it\u2019s possible for to either have or lack that trait)\n(Thomson 2008, 79).\n\nSo what makes a person as good as a person can be? The fourth major\nAristotelian idea is that the standards of goodness for a thing are\ndetermined by the kind of thing it is. But how can a thing\u2019s\nkind determine the standards for that thing? The traditional\nanswer, from Aristotle, says that kinds of things have a particular\nform, or shape. The form of hammers is just their hammer-shape. The\nform of a thing determines its function: the function of a hammer is\nto hammer because hammers are shaped in a way that makes them good for\nhammering. And function thus determines the telos (purpose or\nend) of the thing: hammers are for hammering, and a good hammer is one\nthat hammers well. All of this can be understood in unmysterious,\nnaturalistic terms. We can apply this same model to human beings. The\nform of a human determines what the specific human function is. And a\ngood person is, therefore, someone who performs that function well by\nsatisfying the characteristic ends of human life. \n\nThe most influential account of human ends comes from Rosalind\nHursthouse. Hursthouse says that human life is characterized by four\nends: survival, reproduction, characteristic enjoyment and freedom\nfrom pain, and the good functioning of the group. Survival and\nreproduction are common to all living things, including plants. But\nthe manner in which these ends should be pursued are characteristic of\nthe species. Penguins have one characteristic way of reproducing and\nlions have another (Hursthouse 1999, Ch 9). The characteristically\nhuman way of pursuing these four human ends is by the use of\nrationality. Humans alone among the animals act not from mere\ninstinct, but from a rational capacity of deliberation and choice. So\ngood, \u201cflourishing\u201d humans are those who pursue the four\nends in accordance with reason. Like many other neo-Aristotelians,\nHursthouse uses the word \u201cflourishing\u201d as an English\ntranslation of Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonia, since it nicely\ncaptures the analogy with other kinds of living organism that is\ncentral to Aristotelian naturalism. But \u2018flourishing\u2019\nmight not be the best word, since it may misleadingly imply an\nuntroubled life (Foot 2001, Ch 6).\n\nA common objection at this point is that the notion of an end or\ntelos, while central to Aristotle\u2019s conception of\nbiology, is much more controversial in a Darwinian biological paradigm\n(Millum 2006; compare Moosavi 2022a). This is particularly true if we\nare talking about the telos of an organism as a whole; many\nphilosophers of biology will still be happy to say that the purpose of\nthe heart is to pump blood, but it\u2019s not clear that it makes\nsense to talk about the purpose of a human being. For this reason,\nmany neo-Aristotelians prefer to avoid (or at least de-emphasize) the\nidea of a human telos and instead talk in terms of what\nMichael Thompson has called \u201cAristotelian categoricals\u201d\n(Thompson 2008, Ch 4). These are claims like like \u201cOak trees\nhave deep, sturdy roots\u201d or \u201cHumans have 32 teeth.\u201d\nAristotelian categoricals are not necessarily true of all, or even\nmost, members of a species; most humans have less than 32 teeth\n(Anscombe 1958). Rather, they describe something important about the\nnature, or the characteristic form of life, of different\nkinds of living things (McDowell 1998). They say what\n\u201cshould\u201d be the case for a member of a species, or what\nwill be true of an organism insofar as it is flourishing. In this way,\nAristotelian categoricals are both descriptive biological claims but\nalso, in a way, evaluative.\n\nAristotelian categoricals allow us to evaluate organisms in a\nstraightforwardly naturalistic way. An oak tree with deep, sturdy\nroots is (at least in this respect) flourishing, while one without\ndeep, sturdy roots is defective. Similarly, then, a good person is\nflourishing insofar as they participate in characteristically human\nways of life, and bad people are defective in the same sense that an\noak without deep, sturdy roots is defective. \u201cA bad tree.\u201d\nThe only difference is that humans and oak trees participate in very\ndifferent ways of life. The aptness of the comparison is better\nillustrated by looking at other social animals, like wolves. Wolves\nhunt in packs; that is their characteristic way of life. A wolf that\nhunts in a pack flourishes, while a wolf that hunts by itself is\ndefective. A good life for a wolf is partly a matter of cooperating\nwith others of its kind to achieve further ends which are constitutive\nof a flourishing life (Foot 2001, 16). So, too, with humans. The\ncharacteristic ways of life for any given thing are what we might call\nthe virtues of that thing; deep, sturdy roots are virtues in an oak.\nThe distinctively human virtues are the virtues that are particular to\nhuman life, which is a social life governed by rational deliberation.\nAnd those are just the traditional virtues of moral philosophy:\ncourage, humility, generosity, and so on (Foot 2001, Ch 5). Humans\nwith those virtues are, in that respect, flourishing. Those that lack\nthe virtues are defective.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to some objections. First, consider the\nAristotelian\u2019s claim that goodness is an attributive adjective.\nIt\u2019s quite plausible that goodness functions like an attributive\nadjective sometimes: a good tennis player might be a bad father. But\nthere might also be a predicative use of the word \u2018good.\u2019\nFor instance, consider the idea of a \u201cgood state of\naffairs.\u201d It is hard to give the \u2018good\u2019 in\n\u201cgood state of affairs\u201d an attributive reading: states of\naffairs aren\u2019t what Thomson calls a good-fixing kind. Thomson\nargues that this means that it\u2019s incoherent to say that there\ncould be such a thing as a good state of affairs; she takes this to be\na strong challenge to consequentialism (Thomson 2008, 62). But if the\nnotion of a good state of affairs is intelligible, perhaps\n\u201cgood\u201d sometimes serves as a predicative adjective that\nrefers to a property of (moral) goodness (Sturgeon 2010).\n\nSecond, whether we evaluate human organisms in terms of a\ntelos or a characteristic form of life, it\u2019s not clear\nhow these kinds of evaluations are relevant to ethics. Even if there\nis a characteristic way of human life, why should we live that way\nourselves? What is normative about \u201cnatural\ngoodness\u201d (Prinz 2009)? Living a characteristic human life might\nbe a very bad way to live. There are some characteristic ways of human\nlife that seem to be quite bad: for example, destroying the\nenvironment, fighting ideological wars, and having a sense of altruism\nthat is limited to a relatively small circle of family and friends.\nNeo-Aristotelians seem to assume a rather rosy picture of human nature\nthat\u2019s hard to square with a serious study of history or\nsociology (Williams 1972; Millgram 2009).\n\nNeo-Aristotelians typically answer this worry by appealing to the role\nof reason (Hacker-Wright 2009; Lott 2012; Jordan 2020). The supreme\nhuman virtue that characterizes a flourishing human life is\nphronesis, the virtue of being able to reason well about how\nto act (Hursthouse 1999, Ch 4). So fighting ideological wars is not\ncharacteristic of human life because it\u2019s not reasonable to\nfight ideological wars; that\u2019s not how a good person, one with\nphronesis, would act. This way of operationalizing\nAristotelianism throws out the idea that discerning natural goodness\nis a matter of applied biology (Hursthouse 1999, 178\u2013191). The\ncharacteristic form of human life is defined ethically, not\nbiologically (Nussbaum 1995).\n\nOne might well worry that this abandons the naturalistic character of\nAristotelianism. Aristotelians typically reply that to be a good\nperson is just to be a certain sort of human organism with certain\nmental characteristics (which amounts to having a brain that is\nfunctionally organized in a certain way). So (recalling our\ndistinctions from Section 1), while neo-Aristotelians accept Property\nNaturalism and most accept Fact Naturalism, many end up rejecting\nMethodological Naturalism (Hursthouse 1999, Ch 10; Moosavi 2022b). But\nJohn McDowell has argued that the human virtues are\n\u201cnatural\u201d only insofar as they relate to the\n\u201cnature\u201d of human beings, and human nature is not a\nsubject for scientific investigation (McDowell 1998). Micah Lott has\nargued that neo-Aristotelians should give up on pretensions to\nnaturalism (Lott 2020).\n\nThree further problems linger. First, appealing to practical reason to\nsolve the problem of normativity seems to undermine the core\nAristotelian idea that we can define a good person in terms of what is\ndistinctive of human life. Kant argued that Aristotle was wrong to\nground ethics in the form of a human life, since what matters for\nethics is the form of pure practical reason. Contemporary\nAristotelianism seems to concede this point to Kant (Woodcock 2018;\nbut see Jordan 2020 or McKracken 2021). Second, neo-Aristotelianism\nlooks circular. One of the main ideas of Aristotelianism is that the\ngoodness of a good person is the fundamental moral concept, but if we\ndefine a good person in ethical terms, we\u2019ve gone in a circle.\nBrown (2016) responds that a good person is defined in teleological\nrather than ethical terms, but this just raises the question of how we\ndefine teleology. Biological definitions seem inadequate, but\nnormative definitions make the account circular once again. Third,\neven if the circularity concerns can be answered, we might worry that\na larger epistemological problem remains. How can we identify virtuous\nagents? Abandoning Methodological Naturalism might create more\nproblems than it solves (but see Jordan 2016).\n6. Cornell Realism\n\nIf moral naturalism is the view that moral facts are the kinds of\nfacts that can be investigated in a broadly scientific way, then no\nview captures the spirit of naturalism better than Cornell realism.\nCornell realism was developed in the 1980s by Richard Boyd (1988),\nDavid Brink (1986), Nicholas Sturgeon (1985), and Peter Railton\n(1986a; 1986b); the view gets its name from the fact that Boyd, Brink,\nand Sturgeon were working or studying at Cornell University at the\ntime. It is a comprehensive metaethical system, with interrelated\nlinguistic, metaphysical, and epistemological commitments, that\ndeliberately mirrors scientific methodology in ethics as closely as\npossible.\n\nIt might seem odd to suggest that we can know things about morality by\nusing scientific methodology. Scientific methods are all, ultimately,\ngrounded in an epistemology of observation. And as Gilbert Harman\n(1977, Ch. 1) famously argued, it does not seem that we can observe\nmoral facts in anything like the same way that we can observe other\nkinds of natural facts. It\u2019s rather obvious how we can have\nempirical knowledge of natural properties such as redness or\nroundness; they are directly observable. But goodness doesn\u2019t\nseem to be directly observable, and that looks like an important\ndisanalogy between moral properties and natural properties.\n\nBut not all natural properties are directly observable. Some kinds of\nnatural properties are complex, and knowable only through the\nfunctional role they occupy. Consider, for instance, the property of\nbeing healthy. Being healthy isn\u2019t like being red; there\u2019s\nno one way that healthy people look. Of course, there may be some\ncharacteristic visual signs of healthiness \u2013 rosy cheeks, a\nspring in one\u2019s step \u2013 but these visual signs are neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for healthiness. These directly observable\nproperties are only indications of healthiness. Healthiness is a\ncomplex natural property, wholly constituted by an organism\u2019s\nbody being in the \u201cproper\u201d configuration, with a robust\ncausal profile. There are many things that can cause or impede health\nby their presence or absence: food, water, disease, etc. And there are\nmany things that will result from health in typical circumstances:\nenergy, long life, etc. Rosy cheeks and a spring in one\u2019s step\nare indications of healthiness because these are properties that are\n\u2013 typically \u2013 caused by health. Our awareness of the\ncausal profile of healthiness thus gives us a way of figuring out\nwhich things have or do not have the complex property of\nhealthiness.\n\nCornell realists hold that goodness is exactly like healthiness in all\nof these ways (Boyd 1988). Like healthiness, goodness is a complex\nnatural property that is not directly observable, but nonetheless has\na robust causal profile. Like \u201chealthiness,\u201d\n\u201cgoodness\u201d is not synonymous with any simpler empirical\ndescription. Instead, \u201cgoodness\u201d describes the\nfunctionally complex natural property that is the effect of certain\ncharacteristic causes, and the cause of certain characteristic\neffects. Many different things contribute to or detract from goodness\n\u2013 things like pleasure or pain, honesty or untruthfulness\n\u2013 and there are many things that will result from goodness in\ntypical circumstances \u2013 things like human flourishing, or\npolitical peace. Because goodness is a natural property with a complex\ncausal profile, the property of goodness can enter into explanatory\nrelations. Thus, contra Harman, it is possible for goodness to explain\nour observations (Sturgeon 1985). We can, accordingly, observe whether\nsomething is good by looking for indications of goodness. This is\nexactly the same way that we observe whether something is healthy.\n\nAnother way that goodness is like healthiness is that both are\nmultiply realizable. We could, perhaps, give a more or less complete\ndescription of what it takes for a human body to be healthy, although\nsuch a description might be quite long and complicated. But it\u2019s\nalso possible that aliens with a very different biology exist, and for\nthose aliens to be healthy, even though a healthy alien body is\nnothing like a healthy human body. But despite their radical physical\ndifferences, both a healthy alien and a healthy human are healthy. The\nsame might be true of goodness, or other moral properties. As a\nnatural property, any particular instance of goodness is fully\nconstituted by a complex of more fundamental physical properties. But\ngoodness might be constituted by an indefinitely large number of\nradically distinct physical configurations: the goodness of a promise\nkept is quite different from the goodness of a delicious and\nnutritious meal. This motivates the Cornell realists to call\nthemselves non-reductive naturalists (by which they mean that they are\none-term naturalists rather than descriptivists). Goodness is\nrealizable in too many physical structures to give a usable definition\nof morality in descriptive terms.\n\nThe great asset of Cornell realism is that it directly adopts widely\naccepted views about the nature of natural properties and scientific\nknowledge in order to answer the foundational questions of moral\nmetaphysics and moral epistemology. What are moral properties? Highly\ncomplex natural properties, multiply realizable in more fundamental\nstructures, and individuated by their causal profiles. Are there,\ngenerally, properties like this? Yes; these are known as\n\u201chomeostatic cluster properties.\u201d Healthiness is one;\nmoral properties are properties like that. How do we know about moral\nproperties? By looking for directly observable properties that are\ncharacteristically functionally upstream or downstream from the moral\nproperty that we are interested in (provided that we have justified\nbackground beliefs about the functional roles of moral properties). Do\nwe, generally, have knowledge like this? Yes: this is how we have\nscientific knowledge; moral knowledge is knowledge like that. In this\nway, the theoretical resources of scientific realism also turn out to\nsupport moral realism (Boyd 1988).\n\nA skeptic might object that it\u2019s impossible to have justified\nbackground beliefs about the functional profile of moral properties.\nBut this objection would prove too much. We are entitled to rely on\nbackground beliefs in moral theory development because we\u2019re\nentitled to do so in science, generally (Boyd 1988, 189\u2013191).\nOur theories and background beliefs are justified together, by their\noverall coherence and empirical adequacy, in both science and\nethics.\n\nIt is not essential to Cornell realism that goodness be identified\nwith any particular complex natural property \u2013 different Cornell\nrealists have different first-order normative commitments. The most\ninfluential of these accounts is due to Railton (1986a; 1986b).\nRailton, like Thomson, holds that moral goodness is defined in terms\nof what is non-morally good for agents. Whereas Thomson, as a\nneo-Aristotelian, defines what is good for a human in terms of human\nbiology, Railton defines non-moral goodness for an agent as what a\nfully-informed counterpart would advise us to desire, or, (perhaps)\nequivalently, what a fully-informed counterpart of ourselves would\ndesire if they were in our actual position (see also Brandt 1979;\nSmith 1994). To illustrate, Railton asks us to imagine a traveler,\nLonnie, who feels terrible because he is badly dehydrated. Lonnie does\nnot know that he is dehydrated, and so is not taking appropriate steps\nto make himself feel better. But imagine a fully-informed version of\nLonnie \u2013 \u201cLonnie-Plus\u201d \u2013 who knows about his\ndehydration and knows that drinking clear liquids will make him feel\nbetter. Lonnie-Plus, who (like Lonnie) desires to feel better but who\n(unlike Lonnie) knows the best means to that end, would recommend that\nLonnie drink clear fluids, and would drink clear fluids himself if he\nwere in Lonnie\u2019s position. The fact that Lonnie-Plus would\nadvise Lonnie to want to to drink clear fluids means that drinking\nclear fluids is good for Lonnie. This is not a relativist view of\ngoodness, because the fact that Lonnie-Plus would choose to drink\nclear liquids is determined by Lonnie\u2019s circumstances and\nconstitution, and facts about Lonnie\u2019s circumstances and\nconstitution are objective facts. In general: the complex natural\nproperty of being good for an agent is identical to the complex\nnatural property that agent\u2019s fully-informed counterpart would\nchoose. This makes goodness \u201cobjective, though relational\u201d\n(Railton 1986b, 167).\n\nThis account is highly controversial. Railton\u2019s case of\nLonnie-Plus presents a counterpart who knows just a few more salient\nbits of information than Lonnie. But a counterpart who is truly\nfully-informed will know vastly more than we\nourselves do, and would, accordingly, be quite different from us. A\nfully-informed counterpart might be suicidally depressed, or made\nneurotic by their full awareness of all the oddities and dangers in\nthe world, or might in some other way have been driven quite mad by\nthe process of becoming omniscient. It\u2019s far from clear what a\nfully informed person would desire, and, given that fully-informed\nindividuals are so radically different from ourselves, it\u2019s not\nclear why we should think that the advice of such an agent would have\nanything to do with our own personal well-being (Loeb 1995). It might\nalso be impossible to be fully-informed in this way. It\u2019s\nplausible that our knowledge affects the nature of our experiences,\nand so a \u201cfully-informed\u201d agent would be incapable of\nknowing what it is like to have experiences in a condition of\nignorance, and thus could not be truly fully informed (Sobel 1994;\nRosati 1995). We might also worry that full information accounts get\nthings backwards; advice attends to our interests, our interests\ndon\u2019t attend to advice, even ideal advice (see Risberg 2018 and\ncitations therein). Railton heads off this objection by denying that\npersonal good depends on an ideal advisor\u2019s advice:\n\u201cthe existence of an individual\u2019s objective interest can\nexplain why his ideally informed self would pick out for his\nless-informed self a given objectified subjective interest, but not\nvice versa\u201d (Railton 1986b, fn 17). This answers the\nworry, but leaves us somewhat adrift. If the advice of a\nfully-informed counterpart doesn\u2019t make a certain complex of\nnatural properties count as good for an agent, what does?\n\nWith this account of personal, non-moral goodness in hand, Railton\nthen defines a moral standard as a standard that takes all\nagents\u2019 interests equally into account. To act rightly is to act\nin accordance with this standard. Railton\u2019s moral standard is\n\u201cconsequentialist, aggregative, and maximizing, [but it] is not\nequivalent to classical utilitarianism,\u201d since Railton does not\nassume that personal, non-moral goodness consists in happiness\n(Railton 1986, fn. 31). This moral standard has explanatory power; for\ninstance, if a society does not take the interests of all into\naccount, it might be more prone to revolution, and so a revolution in\nan immoral society might be explained by that immorality. Because the\nmoral standard is one that takes the interests of all into account,\nthe right thing for an agent to do may fail to serve her interests.\nAssuming that practical reasons are grounded solely in self-interest\n(as Railton does), people who don\u2019t care about the moral\nstandard might have no reason to act morally. As we saw in Section\n4.2, Railton accepts a \u201creforming definition\u201d of morality\nthat sacrifices the intrinsic normativity of moral standards. As we\nalso saw in Section 4.2, many consider this to be an unacceptable\nconsequence of the view.\n\nThere may, in practice, be substantial overlap between the\nmetaphysical commitments of neo-Aristotelianism and Cornell realism.\nCornell realists say that the good is a certain higher-order natural\nproperty. Neo-Aristotelians say that goodness has something to do with\nhuman flourishing, which is also a higher-order natural property. Both\nCornell realists (Boyd) and neo-Aristotelians (Thomson) have found the\nanalogy with healthiness illuminating when explaining the nature of\nmoral properties (see also Bloomfield 2001). So Cornell realists and\nneo-Aristotelians do tend to be similar in the way that they conceive\nof normative properties. But they differ with respect to what they say\nabout language.\n\nWhile neo-Aristotelians favor an attributive semantics for\n\u2018good,\u2019 Cornell realists accept causal regulation\nsemantics for moral terms, which is the view that moral terms refer to\nwhatever property causally regulates their use. Adopting causal\nregulation semantics is a sensible thing for the Cornell realists to\ndo, for two reasons. First, it continues their foundational commitment\nto treating moral properties as natural properties that we know and\ntalk about in the same way that we know and talk about other natural\nproperties. Causal regulation semantics are the standard semantic\naccount for natural kind terms. And second, it helps them evade the\nOpen Question Argument (Brink 2001). According to causal regulation\nsemantics, moral terms cannot be defined in any verbal way. They\nsimply refer to the (complex higher-order natural) property that\ncausally regulates their use. This makes Cornell realism a form of\nsynthetic naturalism. As we saw in 1.2, Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument shows, at most, that analytic descriptivism is false.\n\nBut the Cornell realist\u2019s semantics is also the source of the\nmost influential objection to Cornell realism. According to this\nobjection \u2013 Horgan and Timmons\u2019s Moral Twin Earth\nObjection (Horgan and Timmons 1991) \u2013 we do not use moral terms\nin the way that the Cornell realist predicts. To understand the Moral\nTwin Earth Objection, we need to first understand how causal\nregulation semantics are supposed to work. The following thought\nexperiment, from Putnam (1975), has been highly influential: Imagine a\nworld \u2013 Twin Earth \u2013 where there is no H2O, but\nthere is another substance called XYZ. This substance XYZ, while\ndistinct from H2O, fills the rivers and lakes, is clear and\ntasteless, etc. XYZ even has the property of being called\n\u2018water\u2019 \u2013 when residents of Twin Earth fill up a\nglass with XYZ from the tap, they will say \u201cI have a cup of\nwater.\u201d Yet for all this, we would not say that Twin Earth is a\nplanet where water is XYZ. We would say that this is a planet where\nthere is no water. There is, instead, another substance \u2013 XYZ\n\u2013 that plays the same functional role. Yet when the person on\nTwin Earth fills a cup from the tap and declares \u201cI have a cup\nof water\u201d, we shouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re mistaken. What\ncould account for that? Putnam argues that the word\n\u2018water\u2019 just means something different on Twin Earth than\nit does in the actual world. In the actual world, \u2018water\u2019\nmeans H2O because, in the actual world, H2O is\nthe stuff that causally regulates our use of the term\n\u2018water.\u2019 But on Twin Earth, \u2018water\u2019 means XYZ\nbecause, on Twin Earth, it is XYZ that causally regulates Twin\nEarthlings use of the term \u2018water.\u2019 That is why the word\n\u2018water\u2019 literally means something different on Twin Earth\nthan it does on Earth.\n\nAccording to the Moral Twin Earth Objection, things don\u2019t work\nthis way for moral terms. Imagine a world \u2013 Moral Twin Earth\n\u2013 that is exactly like the actual world, except on Moral Twin\nEarth, people\u2019s use of moral terminology is causally regulated\nby different properties from those in the actual world. People use\nmoral terminology to praise and blame and to guide action, but they\ntake different kinds of actions to be worthy of praise or blame and\nthey guide their actions in different ways. Thus, if causal regulation\nsemantics is true for moral terms, the word \u2018right\u2019\nliterally means something different on Moral Twin Earth than it does\nin the real world \u2013 this is the intuition that drives\nPutnam\u2019s original Twin Earth case. But we do not have the same\njudgment about how people use moral language on Moral Twin Earth! If\npeople on Moral Twin Earth take different actions to be worthy of\npraise or blame, we don\u2019t conclude that our words\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 mean different things. We\nconclude that there is a substantive moral disagreement between the\ndenizens of Moral Twin Earth and the people in our world, and that\nsuch disagreement is possible only because we and the Twin Earthers\nmean the same thing by our moral terms. Horgan and Timmons argue that\nthis proves that moral terms like \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018wrong\u2019 do not refer to whatever it is that causally\nregulates their use. So much the worse for Cornell realism. See Copp\n(2000), Dowell (2016), Dunaway and McPherson (2016), and V\u00e4yrynen\n(2018) for recent criticisms of this argument. Wisdom (2021)\ncriticizes the whole debate on the grounds that our intuitions about\nTwin Earth and Moral Twin Earth are not stable enough to draw any\nmeaningful conclusions one way or the other.\n\nThe deep problem here is that causal regulation semantics implies a\nkind of relativism. Indeed, some relativists, like Prinz (2007) and\nWong (2006), have argued that their view follows from the Cornell\nrealists\u2019 empirical methodology and moral semantics. If words\nrefer to whatever causally regulates their use, and the same word is\nregulated by different things in different communities, then that word\nrefers to different things in different communities. So if\n\u2018wrong\u2019 refers to whatever causally regulates its use, and\nif two communities have a word \u2018wrong\u2019 that is causally\nregulated by different things, then \u2018wrong\u2019 means\ndifferent things in those communities. This saddles Cornell realists\nwith a classical problem for relativism. If \u2018wrong\u2019 just\nmeans something like \u2018whatever my community disapproves\nof,\u2019 as the relativist says, then \u201cMy community\ndisapproves of this act, but they shouldn\u2019t, because\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with it at all\u201d is\nself-contradictory. But that\u2019s not self-contradictory; so much\nthe worse for relativism (see, e.g., Schroeder 2010, Ch 1). Similarly,\nif words refer to whatever causally regulates their use within a\ncommunity, then \u201cThis action regulates the use of the term\n\u2018wrong\u2019 in my community, but it shouldn\u2019t, since\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong about that action\u201d would be\nself-contradictory. But that\u2019s not self-contradictory; so much\nthe worse for Cornell realism (Sinhababu 2019).\n\nOne might think that Cornell realists can respond by offering a new\naccount of moral language. But this response faces difficulties on two\nfronts. First, causal regulation semantics is the Cornell\nrealists\u2019 way of avoiding a commitment to analytic naturalism\nand the accompanying Open Question Argument. If the causal reference\ntheory is false for moral terms, the naturalist may be forced to\naccept a theory of moral semantics that would re-introduce the Open\nQuestion Argument. Second, the causal reference theory for moral\nlanguage is essential to the Cornell realists\u2019 methodological\nand epistemological commitments. If moral goodness is the thing that\nregulates our use of moral terminology, then the terms of our\nempirical investigation are simple: we just investigate what regulates\nthe use of our moral language. But if the moral facts are not\n(necessarily) the facts that regulate the use of our moral language,\nthen we need a new methodology for moral investigation.\n\nBecause of this, the Moral Twin Earth objection is often presented as\na kind of extension of Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument. The Open\nQuestion Argument is, in Moore\u2019s formulation, an attack on the\nidea that there can be analytic natural-normative property identity\nclaims. But in a larger sense, the Open Question Argument picks out a\nkind of epistemic shortcoming for moral naturalists. Moral naturalists\nare committed to the idea that moral facts are a kind of natural fact\n\u2013 but which natural facts are the moral facts? More simply, how\ndo we know good from bad? If moral claims are synonymous with certain\nnatural claims, we can know by conceptual analysis which things are\ngood. And if moral facts are the facts that causally regulate our use\nof moral terminology, that provides us with another way of\ninvestigating which facts are the moral facts. But if neither of those\nstories is available, it seems that we have no way of identifying\nwhich natural facts are the moral ones (Huemer 2005, chapter 4; Bedke\n2012). This would be a serious methodological problem for moral\nnaturalists, and would also mark a critical disanalogy between moral\nepistemology and scientific epistemology. This disanalogy would be\ncrippling to Cornell realists, who hold that there is no such\ndisanalogy.\n7. Jackson\u2019s Analytic Functionalism\n\nThe final version of naturalism that we\u2019ll look at is Frank\nJackson\u2019s moral functionalism. Jackson is an analytic\ndescriptivist. While his is not the only contemporary version of\nanalytic descriptivism (see Smith 1994; Finlay 2014; Rawlette 2020),\nit is the most influential. This view is typically described as\nJackson\u2019s, and the canonical statement of the view comes from\nhis book From Metaphysics to Ethics, though many of the ideas\nin that book were developed with Philip Pettit (Jackson and Pettit\n1995).\n\nAs we saw in Section 3.1, Jackson endorses the Direct Argument from\nsupervenience to naturalism. Because moral facts supervene on natural\nfacts, they are identical to natural facts. (Jackson talks about\n\u201cdescriptive\u201d facts rather than \u201cnatural\u201d\nfacts, but I\u2019ll continue to use \u201cnatural\u201d for the\nsake of consistency.) The problem now is to say which natural facts\nthe moral facts supervene on and are therefore identical to. Jackson\ncalls this the \u201clocation problem.\u201d The location problem\nisn\u2019t unique to ethics. Jackson expresses sympathy for\nphysicalism, the view that we could, in principle, give a complete\naccount of everything that exists in terms of the kinds of things that\nphysics does (or could) tell us about. Everything else that exists\nsupervenes on (and is therefore identical to) complexes of these\nfundamental physical things. But which complexes of fundamental\nphysical things are the various non-fundamental things identical to?\nLocation problems abound. Solving them is the task of \u201cserious\nmetaphysics\u201d (Jackson 1998, 1\u20138).\n\nSo how can we solve location problems? What is the method of serious\nmetaphysics? The first step is conceptual analysis. If we want to know\nwhat the Fs are, we need to have some idea of what we\u2019re talking\nabout when we\u2019re talking about \u201cthe Fs,\u201d and this\nunderstanding will frame our subsequent investigation. The first step\nin figuring out that water is H2O was understanding that\nwater is the clear, tasteless stuff that fills the rivers and lakes\nand falls from the sky as rain, rather than the intoxicating stuff\nfound in beer, wine, and liquor. If you thought that water was the\nintoxicating stuff in wine, you\u2019d end up drawing a very\ndifferent \u2013 and incorrect \u2013 conclusion about the\ncomposition of water (Jackson 1998, 28\u201331ff).\n\nBut wait! Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought experiment is supposed to\nshow that we can\u2019t discover the meaning of \u2018water\u2019\nby a process of conceptual analysis; the people on Twin Earth have the\nsame concept of \u2018water\u2019 as we do, but their word means\nsomething different. Jackson responds that Putnam and his followers\nhave drawn the wrong lesson from the Twin Earth case. The Twin Earth\nthought experiment doesn\u2019t show us that the concept of water\ncan\u2019t be analyzed; it shows that the concept can be analyzed,\nsince the Twin Earth thought experiment is itself a nice bit of\nconceptual analysis. Twin Earth \u2013 and all other thought\nexperiments \u2013 are nothing more than ways to elicit intuitions\nabout how to deploy our concepts in a variety of counterfactual\ncircumstances. The intuitions that we elicit from thought experiments\nare the stuff that conceptual analyses are made of. Putnam\u2019s\nconclusion that \u2018water\u2019 refers to whatever causally\nregulates the use of the term \u2018water\u2019 within a linguistic\ncommunity is itself a partial analysis of the concept of water\n(Jackson 1998, 39\u201379). Of course, merely having a conceptual\nanalysis like this in hand is not the end of our investigation. Now\nthat we know what we\u2019re looking for, empirical investigation\ntakes over and we investigate what the stuff is that causally\nregulates the use of the term \u2018water\u2019 within our\nlinguistic community. It turns out that that stuff is H2O.\nThat\u2019s how we solved the location problem for\n\u2018water.\u2019\n\nNow we have a general outline for how to solve location problems.\nFirst, consider cases where we would, on reflection, deploy some\nconcept (e.g. \u2018water.\u2019) The result of this reflection will\nbe some set of platitudes about that concept. Next, we turn this set\nof platitudes into a \u201cRamsay sentence.\u201d Take every\ninstance of the word \u2018water\u2019 (or whatever), and replace it\nwith a variable, X. So instead of \u201cWater falls from the sky as\nrain,\u201d we will have a collection of sentences that say things\nlike \u201cX falls from the sky as rain.\u201d This collection of\nRamsay sentences is a description of a functional role; in this case,\nthe water-role. Finally, we empirically investigate what, if anything,\nfulfills that role. We know that water is H2O because we\nfound, through empirical investigation, that H2O is the\nstuff that satisfies the water-role. In general, we know what Fs are\nby using conceptual analysis to figure out what the F-role is, and\nthen empirically investigating what, if anything, satisfies the F-role\n(Jackson 1998, Ch 2\u20133).\n\nWe can perform this process to solve the location problem in ethics.\nBegin with some moral concept, say \u201cgoodness.\u201d Then\nconsider a variety of cases where we would judge that something is\ngood. The result will be some set of platitudes about goodness. We can\nthen take those platitudes about goodness and turn them into a Ramsay\nsentence which describes the goodness-role. Finally, we investigate\nwhat, if anything, satisfies the goodness-role. That thing is goodness\n(Jackson 1998, Ch 5\u20136).\n\nWhat about multiple realizability? Jackson is attempting to provide a\nconceptual analysis of our moral concepts, but the Cornell realists\nthought that no such analysis is possible in part because goodness\n(e.g.) is realizable in a large number of very different things.\nJackson is unconcerned by this. If goodness supervenes on a large\nnumber of different descriptive properties, then goodness is identical\nto the disjunction of all of those descriptive properties on which it\nsupervenes. Goodness might be identical to a disjunction \u2013\nperhaps an infinitely large disjunction! \u2013 of other natural\nproperties (see also Sinhababu 2018).\n\nMany have found the suggestion that goodness is identical to an\ninfinite disjunction of natural properties to be metaphysically and\nepistemologically suspicious. Can an infinite disjunction of natural\nproperties really be a property? And how could we have knowledge of an\nugly gerrymandered property? Jackson replies that excessively\ndisjunctive properties are suspect, because they cannot play a causal\nrole (Jackson 1998, 106). But not all disjunctive properties \u2013\neven infinitely disjunctive properties \u2013 are excessively\ndisjunctive. Consider the property of baldness. Baldness supervenes on\n(and is therefore identical to) having a certain distribution of hair\non one\u2019s head. Well-known vagueness concerns about the predicate\n\u2018bald\u2019 may prevent us from giving a more compact\ndescription of what it takes for someone to be bald. But there is some\nlarge \u2013 perhaps infinitely large \u2013 set of hair\ndistributions which we would, on reflection, definitely consider to be\nbald. Baldness is therefore identical to an infinitely large\ndisjunction of hair distributions. But that doesn\u2019t mean that\nthere\u2019s anything metaphysically or epistemically weird about\nbeing bald. Many people are bald, many claims to the effect that\nsomeone is bald are true, and in most cases it is not particularly\ndifficult to ascertain whether or not someone is bald. Jackson urges\nus to say precisely the same thing about moral properties (124).\n\nA second worry: When we assemble the platitudes about our concept of\n\u201cgoodness,\u201d we will find that many of them implicate other\nmoral concepts. \u201cIf something is good, then you have a reason to\npursue it.\u201d \u201cVirtuous character traits are good.\u201d\nAnd so on. So we can\u2019t analyze the concept of goodness into\nplatitudes and then investigate what satisfies those platitudes, since\nmany of those platitudes will concern moral concepts that are equally\nin need of analysis. Jackson\u2019s solution to this problem is to\nanalyze all of the moral concepts together. Take all of the platitudes\nconcerning goodness or value or wrongness or virtue, etc. Replace\nevery instance of \u201cgood\u201d with a variable (g), replace\nevery instance of \u201cvalue\u201d with another variable (v),\nreplace every instance of \u201cwrong\u201d with another variable\n(w), etc. The result is the functional role description of the\nnetwork of our moral concepts. Goodness and value and\nwrongness are then the g, the v, and the w (etc.) that satisfy all of\nthe platitudes concerning g, v, and w (etc.).\n\nA final worry: Which platitudes are we to select as the platitudes\nthat appear in our analysis? The ones that we endorse on reflection?\nBut who is the \u201cwe\u201d who would endorse these platitudes on\nreflection? How much reflection must we undergo? Jackson answers this\nworry by appeal to the concept of a mature folk morality. A\nfolk morality is \u201cthe network of moral opinions, intuitions,\nprinciples and concepts whose mastery is part and parcel of having a\nsense of what is right and wrong, and of being able to engage in\nmeaningful debate about what ought to be done\u201d (130). This folk\nmorality is then revised by hunting out inconsistencies within\none\u2019s moral commitments and engaging in moral discussion with\nothers, identifying disagreements, and hammering out any differences.\nThe resulting mature moral theory will be both individually and\ninterpersonally coherent. That\u2019s the final statement of the\nview: The moral properties are whatever satisfies the network analysis\nof the platitudes that make up mature folk morality.\n\nJackson\u2019s appeal to a mature folk morality is his main ward\nagainst the Open Question Argument. To ask \u201cX is\npleasurable, but is X good?\u201d is, in effect, to ask\nwhether \u201cPleasure is good\u201d is one of the platitudes that\nwill feature in our mature folk morality. But we don\u2019t have a\nmature folk morality yet \u2013 we may not have one for a very long\ntime \u2013 and we have no way of knowing at this point what\nplatitudes will feature in it. Of course the question remains\nopen.\n\nThe fact that we don\u2019t know what the mature folk morality looks\nlike also shows that Jackson\u2019s idea of an infinitely disjunctive\nproperty isn\u2019t a core commitment of the view. If our mature folk\nmorality is a vast, heterogeneous collection of principles and cases,\nthen only an infinitely disjunctive property could satisfy it. But our\nmature folk morality could well be simple and compact. Whether we end\nup with a compact formulation or an infinite disjunction depends on\nthe outcome of a process we have not yet seen the end of.\n\nNow to some harder objections. One objection holds that\nJackson\u2019s view isn\u2019t really a version of analytic\nnaturalism, because the process of refining our mature folk morality\nwill be the result of not just moral discussion and reflection, but\nalso our observations of the real world (Lane 2018). Relatedly, one\nmight worry whether the platitudes of mature folk morality are really\nconceptual truths. Someone might disagree with a mature consensus not\nas a result of conceptual confusion but as a matter of genuine moral\ndisagreement (Zangwill 2000).\n\nA second objection concerns how we should understand\n\u201cmature\u201d folk morality. We don\u2019t want any endpoint\nof moral theorizing to count as \u201cmature;\u201d if mature folk\nmorality is just the theory we end up with in the future, whatever\nthat might be, then why should we care about it? Maybe people in the\nfuture will have the wrong moral beliefs! But if we define maturity in\nnormative terms, as the outcome of a good process of deliberation (or\nsomething similar), Jackson hasn\u2019t really succeeded in providing\nthe reductive naturalistic account of normativity that he was hoping\nfor (Yablo 2000).\n\nWe might also worry that no mature folk morality will ever emerge. If\nmoral disagreement persists into the indefinite future, just as it has\npersisted throughout human history, there is no mature folk morality\nand thus no set of platitudes that determines the moral facts. Jackson\nconcedes that this is a real problem: if there is no convergence in\nmoral attitudes, his methodology would imply moral relativism. He can\nonly offer hope that convergence will occur some day (137\u20138).\nAnd so Jackson\u2019s ambitious metaethical project turns out to rest\non an appeal to optimism.\n",
