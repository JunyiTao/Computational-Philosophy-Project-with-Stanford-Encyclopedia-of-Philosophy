    "main_text": "Hilbert's old axiomatic proof theory\n2. Hilbert's old axiomatic proof theory\n\n\nHilbert's book Grundlagen der Geometrie of 1899 set the stage\nfor the central foundational problems of mathematics of the early\ndecades of the 20th century. We can list these problems as\nfollows:\n\nThe formalization of a mathematical theory. This includes a choice\nof its basic objects and relations, and a choice of the axioms.\nA proof of the consistency of the axioms.\nThe question of the mutual independence and completeness of the\naxioms.\nThe decision problem: is there a method for answering any question\nthat could be raised within the theory?\n\n\n\nAs to Hilbert's geometry, its attempted formalization fell short of\nthe ideal to which it gave birth. Hilbert found a much more important\nfield to which his \u201cmetamathematics\u201d was to be applied,\nnamely arithmetic and analysis. The groundwork was a study of the four\nfoundational problems in axiomatic formulations of pure logic.\nPropositional logic was thus formalized, found to be consistent and\ncomplete, and decidable. The first results about predicate logic are\nfrom 1915, when Leopold L\u00f6wenheim gave his version of what later\nbecame the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem for predicate logic (see the entry\non classical logic).\nHe also solved special cases of the decision problem. This development\nwas independent of the Frege-Russell tradition, and was instead based\non the algebraic approach to logic of Ernst Schr\u00f6der. Around 1920, the\n\u201cHilbert style\u201d axiomatic approach, as it is often called,\nwas known to everyone and dominated the logical scene; the algebraic\napproach merged almost without notice with lattice theory. By 1928, in\nHilbert and Ackermann's Grundz\u00fcge der theoretischen Logik, an\naxiomatic formal system for predicate logic was presented, together\nwith the problem of its completeness. The latter was solved by G\u00f6del\nin 1929, published a year later (G\u00f6del 1930). The fourth\nfoundational problem, the decision problem for predicate logic, was\nshown to have a negative solution in a short paper by Church in 1936\nas a corollary to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem.\n\n\nHilbert and his school, with Bernays, Ackermann and von Neumann as \nforemost, as well as young Herbrand in France, pursued the \nmetamathematical study of arithmetic in the latter part of the 1920s.\nHilbert developed a method for the study of consistency problems, \ncalled the \n epsilon substitution method,\n to deal with the quantifiers. He felt that indirect inferences with \nquantifiers in cases with an infinity of objects were the crucial \npoint of consistency proofs and needed a justification. Say, if the \nassumption that all natural numbers have the property P \nleads to an impossibility, the existence of a number with the \ncontrary property not-P can be inferred. The central problem\nwas thus to justify the use of classical logic in mathematical \nproofs, arithmetical ones in the first place. Ackermann was very \nclose to a solution towards the end of the 1920s and optimism reigned\nin the Hilbert school. Then, of course, the unexpected happened when \nG\u00f6del proved the impossibility of a complete formalization of \nelementary arithmetic, and, as it was soon interpreted, the \nimpossibility of proving the consistency of arithmetic by finitary \nmeans, the only ones judged \u201cabsolutely reliable\u201d by \nHilbert.\n",
