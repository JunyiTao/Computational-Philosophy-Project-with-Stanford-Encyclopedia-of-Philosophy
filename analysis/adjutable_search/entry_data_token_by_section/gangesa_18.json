    "main_text": "Testimony || The meaning of a statement\n7.3 \u201cIndirect indication,\u201d lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\n\nThe longest section in the testimony chapter and indeed in the\nentirety of the Jewel is devoted to\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, which is a second mode of meaning\ndependent on the first or primary called \u201cdenotation,\u201d\nabhidh\u0101na, i.e. reference. Ny\u0101ya-sutra\n2.2.62 gives about a dozen examples of semantic transference, for\nexample, \u201cThe stands are shouting,\u201d where it is not the\nstands but the people in them who are shouting. And with \u201cUsher\nin the sticks,\u201d it is ascetics who carry walking sticks who are\nto be ushered in. In this example, the primary, denotative meaning is\nnot entirely transferred since the ascetics would carry their sticks\nin with them into the dining room, it is presumed. The most common\nexample in the Jewel is \u201cThe village is\nin-the-Ga\u1e45g\u0101,\u201d where we understand the village to be\non the river\u2019s bank (the indicated) because we know\nthat no village is actually built in the Ga\u1e45g\u0101,\nwhich is very deep.\n\nThe inherited view is that a violation of yogyat\u0101,\n\u201csemantic fit,\u201d triggers a hearer to understand a\nsecondary sense. But one of the first comments Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nmakes about lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 rejects this view,\nbringing up the phenomenon\u2019s relevance to the debate about\nsentential unity, anvaya. He writes (2020: 1250):\n\n\n\u2026 [lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101] is not triggered by a\nviolation of semantic fit (as is commonly held) but rather by a\nviolation of anvaya itself, of the overall connection of\nwords, the overall construction. For example, by force of context we\nunderstand from a violation of anvaya with the word\n\u2018stick\u2019 in connection with \u2018usher in\u2019\n(\u201cUsher in the sticks\u201d) that the speaker\u2019s purpose\nis to feed certain ascetics (who typically carry walking sticks) who\nwould be ushered in along with their sticks.\n\nIn a case where a secondary usage does not involve entire\nrelinquishment of the primary meaning but retains it in part, as (with\nthe previous example but also) in \u201cThe umbrella-holders are\ncoming,\u201d it is precisely the context that tells us that the\ncoming is on the part of an umbrella-holder and also\nthose who are not umbrella-holders (important people over\nwhose heads a large umbrella is being held). Because of the violation,\nthe agency of the movement is understood. There would be a violation\nof anvaya in taking the meaning to apply only to a\nholder.\n\n\nSince it is entirely possible that several umbrella-holders are\ncoming, it must be something broader than \u201csemantic fit\u201d\nthat is violated in this and similar cases.\n\n\u201cIndirect indication\u201d does a lot of work for\nreferentialism, since there are many, many examples where no direct\nreferent is meant but a hearer comprehends a statement and acquires\ntestimonial knowledge. And although Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba resists\noveremployment of the notion, he uses it extensively. Further examples\nconcern the meaning of certain Sanskrit compounds and grammatical\nnumber, when, for instance, a plural form is used while what is meant\nis a single something or other.\n\nNaiy\u0101yikas are hardly the only theorists who employ the tool.\nSome M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas argue that reference is to the\nuniversal, the individual being indicated by\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba considers the\nview that it is the universal that is known by\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, not the individual, the universal\nas specifying the character of the individual. On the dispute about\nreference to universals or individuals, Naiy\u0101yikas want to agree\nwith all parties, it seems. Importantly, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees\nreference to an individual as invariably to an individual of a kind,\nfor example \u201c(A) cow,\u201d would be to one qualified by\ncowhood: \u201cthe referent is an entity as qualified by a\nuniversal\u201d (2020: 1576). To focus just on the cowhood would be\n\u201cindirect indication,\u201d he says, with the indicator being\nthe individual cow referred to. Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas tend to find no\nuse for lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, since according to them\nreference is holistic, a matter of the entire sentence, and the\nmeanings of the individual words are united in the hearer\u2019s\nmind. Thus it is the radical referentialists who seem to need it\nmost.\n\nIn a remarkable passage, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba puts forth a core argument\nfor lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 (2020: 1631):\n\n\nObjection:\n\nReference (\u015bakti = abhidh\u0101) is alone\nsufficient (with no need to posit an additional mode of meaning),\nsince the conventional practice that supports anyone's understanding\nmeaning is common to both (what you call) primary and indicated\nsenses. For, the words (that make up a sentence and statement) having\nbeen put together, an etymological analysis can inform us of the\noverall connection because \u015bakti, the power of\nreference, has accomplished a setting in mind, or settings in mind,\nproduced by the words. Otherwise, there could be neither testimony as\na knowledge source nor speaker\u2019s intention, since this power\ngoverns and regulates them both.\n\nMoreover, if the speaker\u2019s intention is understood (by anyone\nhearing \u201cThe village is in-the-Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u201d), then\nonly reference need be imagined as accounting for the communication\n(no indirect meaning, lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), since that\nis the economical position. Like homonyms such as\n\u2018ak\u1e63a\u2019 (\u201ceye/dice\u201d) and\ncompany, multiplicity of meaning is alone the right view. No\nuneconomical additional mode need be supposed.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba:\n\nWe answer. If we had to imagine that the word\n\u2018Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u2019 is used (as you claim) for the\nthousands of things that could be indicated by using the word for such\na thing as a bank, then in order to understand a usage we would have\nto be familiar with another conventional practice of older persons\n(who have taught us the conventions of language) in each case among\nall the innumerable things that could be indicated. And so this view\nis uneconomical, and it is not borne out by experience.\n\nIndirect meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), on the other\nhand, is single, unitary, by nature to be related to what is picked\nout. And it does not require us to be familiar with another\nconventional practice of of older persons having the indicated as\nintentional object. Thus to have an economical position, it alone is\nappropriately posited.\n\n\nWithout lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, reference would have to do\ntoo much work and could not tie use of a word to a certain type of\nthing. It is to save the fixity of the referential tie that\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 has to be posited. Its usefulness as\na concept depends on its flexibility.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba also swims against the mainstream by eschewing\nknowledge of speaker\u2019s intention to explain the triggering of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. He points out that typically one\nhas to understand a statement before knowing the speaker\u2019s\nintention in making it. A hearer\u2019s knowing the speaker\u2019s\nintention is not a necessary factor in the generation of the\nhearer\u2019s testimonial knowledge through indirect indication, he\nsays, but he admits that knowing a speaker\u2019s intention could be\nsufficient.\n\nAbout the principles of transference, he has little to say other than\nto point to \u201crelevant context\u201d and \u201cbeing set in\nmind quickly.\u201d Indirect indication is preceded by comprehension\nof conventional meaning and is directed toward something that is\nrelated to the conventional meaning. But some cases,\n\u201cfrozen metaphors,\u201d are reconventionalizations where the\nprimary, original meaning has been forgotten. A \u201cwindfall\u201d\nseems to be a good example in modern English. There is a long and\nintricate discussion of this. Can we refer to a water-lily by using\nthe word \u2018mud-born\u2019? No, says Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba. The word\nhas been reconventionalized to mean in a primary way only lotuses and\nif used for a water-lily we would have a case of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101.\n",
