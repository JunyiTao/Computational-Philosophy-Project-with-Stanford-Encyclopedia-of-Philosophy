    "main_text": "Historical Antecedents to Current Views: Frege\n5. Historical Antecedents to Current Views: Russell\n\nBertrand Russell, to whom many current structured propositions\ntheorists attribute the idea of structured propositions, held various\nviews about the nature of propositions over the course of his career.\nHowever, the account of propositions held by Russell that is thought\nby many to be the progenitor of current accounts of structured\npropositions is the one Russell defended in Russell [1903]. We shall\nconfine our attention to that account here. Russell differed with\nFrege both on what the constituents of structured propositions are and\non what binds them together in the proposition. Russell uses the word\n\u2018term\u2019 for constituents of propositions. Thus he\nwrites:\n\nWhatever may be an object of thought, or may occur in any true or\nfalse proposition \u2026I call a term\u2026.A man, a moment, a\nnumber, a class, a relation, a chimaera, or anything else that can be\nmentioned, is sure to be a term; and to deny that such and such a\nthing is a term must always be false. (Russell [1903] p. 43)\n\n\nThus we already see that Russell differs from Frege on what kinds of\nthings can be constituents of propositions. For Frege, all\nconstituents of propositions are senses. For Russell, a man or a\nmountain can be a constituent of a proposition. In a now famous\ncorrespondence with Frege, Russell replied to Frege\u2019s assertion\nthat the sense of the name \u2018Mont Blanc\u2019, and not Mont\nBlanc itself \u201cwith all its snowfields\u201d, occurs in the\nproposition/thought that Mont Blanc is 4,000 meters high, by saying:\n\n\nI believe that in spite of all its snowfields Mont Blanc itself is a\ncomponent part of what is actually asserted in the proposition\n\u2018Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high\u2019. (Frege [PMC]\np. 169)\n\n\nRussell goes on to distinguish two kinds of terms or propositional\nconstituents:\n\nAmong terms, it is possible to distinguish two kinds, which I shall\ncall respectively things and concepts. The former are the terms\nindicated by proper names, the latter those indicated by all other\nwords. (Russell [1903] p. 44)\n\n\nSo for Russell, all propositional constituents are things or concepts.\nOn Russell\u2019s view, a sentence such as:\n\nSocrates is human\n\nexpresses a proposition with three constituents, corresponding to the\nthree words in the sentence. Socrates himself is one of the\nconstituents, the other two constituents being the concepts\ncontributed by \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018human\u2019.\n\nHaving seen that Russell held different kinds of things to be\nconstituents of propositions than did Frege, we shall turn to his\nviews on what binds together the constituents of structured\npropositions. Russell appears to hold that the propositional\ncontributions of verbs (which contributions Russell often calls verbs)\nhold together the constituents of propositions. Thus he writes:\n\nConsider, for example, the proposition \u2018A differs from\nB\u2019. The constituents of this proposition, if we analyze\nit, appear to be only A, difference, B. Yet these\nconstituents, thus placed side by side, do not reconstitute the\nproposition. The difference which occurs in the proposition actually\nrelates A and B, whereas the difference after analysis\nis a notion which has no connection with A and B.\n(Russell [1903] p. 49)\n\n\nAnd later Russell writes:\n\nOwing to the way in which the verb [propositional contribution of a\nverb] actually relates the terms of a proposition, every proposition\nhas a unity which renders it distinct from the sum of its\nconstituents. (Russell [1903] p. 52)\n\n\nRussell\u2019s idea that a proposition is something beyond the sum of\nits constituents certainly seems correct. The collection, or\nmereological sum, of A, difference and B is not the\nproposition that A differs from B. Different\npropositions may have the same Russellian constituents, as with the\npropositions expressed by the following sentence pair:\n\nJason loves Patti.\n\nPatti loves Jason.\n\nHowever, Russell\u2019s idea that the propositional contribution of\nthe verb binds the constituents together (in different ways in the\ncase of our pair of sentences) is hard to understand. In the next to\nlast quotation from Russell above, he suggests that the proposition\nexpressed by \u2018A differs from B\u2019, whose\nconstituents are A, difference and B, is held together\nby difference actually obtaining between A and B. If we\ncall difference a relation, the proposition would consist of A\nstanding in the relation of difference to B. Russell makes a\nnumber of remarks that suggest that this is his view. But it would\nseem that this cannot be correct. Intuitively, A standing in\nthe relation of difference to B is what makes the proposition\nthat A differs from B true. It is not the proposition\nitself. For if it were, it would seem that if A doesn\u2019t\nstand in the difference relation to B, then there is no (false)\nproposition to the effect that A differs from B. And\nquite generally, for the same reason it would appear that there are no\nfalse propositions. Perhaps Russell meant that propositional\ncontributions of verbs hold propositional constituents together in\nsome other manner. But it certainly is not clear what that manner\nwould be. Or perhaps he held a view similar to Zalta\u2019s discussed\nabove.\n",
