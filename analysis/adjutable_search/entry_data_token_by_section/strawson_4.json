    "main_text": "Individuals\n5. Individuals\n\nIn 1959 Strawson published his second book Individuals. It is\nambitious, abstract, wide ranging and original, and it has continued\nto be read and discussed, especially the first half. Strawson coined\nthe terms \u2018descriptive metaphysics\u2019 to capture his task\nand opposed that to what he called \u2018revisionary\nmetaphysics\u2019. By using \u2018metaphysics\u2019 Strawson was\nprimarily emphasising the abstractness and generality of his\nquestions. A consequence of this generality, Strawson suggests, is\nthat the methods needed for settling them are different in kind from\nthose employed in debating less abstract conceptual or philosophical\nquestions. One such method, employed in chapter 2, when exploring the\nsound world, involves imagining creatures with quite different\nexperiences from our own, and trying to determine their capacities for\nthinking about objects. By calling it \u2018descriptive\u2019\nStrawson means, in part, that he is not recommending revisions or\nadditions to how we think. But the term also signals Strawson\u2019s\nconviction that there is a shared and universal conceptual scheme\nwhich we human beings have, and know that we have, and for which no\njustification in terms of more fundamental concepts or claims can be\ngiven. He writes:\n\n[T]here is a massive central core of human thinking which has no\nhistory\u2014or none recorded in histories of human thought; there\nare categories and concepts which, in their most fundamental\ncharacter, change not at all. Obviously these are not the specialities\nof the most refined thinking. They are the commonplaces of the least\nrefined thinking; and yet are the indispensable core of the conceptual\nequipment of the most sophisticated human beings. (Strawson 1959, 10)\n\n\nThe claim that there are a shared set of concepts which are at the\nindispensable core of human thinking is a recognisably Kantian thesis.\n(We say more about Strawson\u2019s relation to Kant below.)\nDescriptive metaphysics aims to describe and analyse this universal\nconceptual scheme. In particular, Strawson aims to focus on\none part of that total structure, namely our ability to\ndirect our thoughts, and speech, onto items in the world. It is\npossible therefore to see Individuals as, in part, a\ndevelopment of Strawson\u2019s interest in reference.\n\nIndividuals is very much a book of two halves. In the first\nfour chapters Strawson\u2019s focus is on our ability to refer to and\nthink about items in our environment, including ourselves. In the\nsecond part, again of four chapters, the aim is to elucidate the\ndistinction between subject expressions and predicate expressions.\nThis latter task belongs more to philosophical logic or the philosophy\nof language than to metaphysics, but the link is, according to\nStrawson, that the central cases of subject expressions are those\npicking out the entities to which we basically refer, the character of\nwhich it has been the task of the first half to determine. Since, in\nfact, the book\u2019s colossal and immediate impact was due primarily\nto the brilliance and originality of its first three chapters, we\nshall describe them in somewhat more detail than the rest of the book.\nThe truth is that reading the argument developed in those chapters\ngenerates a continuous intellectual excitement, which the later\nchapters do not quite match. It is also true that issues to do with\nthe subject-predicate distinction appeal to fewer people than do the\nissues focused on in the early part.\n\nChapter 1 focuses on the question of whether there is a category of\nentities which we can think about without depending on thought about\nentities of other categories. The focus initially is not so much on\nthought as on linguistically referring to something when in\nconversation with an audience, and Strawson clarifies the relevant\nidea of talking about an item by invoking the notion of identifying\nreference which emerged in his theory of reference. Strawson proposes\nthe following model of latching onto an identifying reference. One\ncase is where the referent is picked out as a currently perceived item\n\u2013 say, this page. In such a case the audience succeeds\nwhen they pick out the same item in their own field of experience. The\nother is where it is picked out as falling under a description.\nStrawson\u2019s idea is that ultimately such descriptions need to\nrelate the item in some way to currently perceived items \u2013 say,\nas the author of this page \u2013 for otherwise the\npossibility of reduplication would prevent us from picking out a\nunique item. (Such a two\u2013fold structure of thought was also\naccepted by Russell, but arguments in the theory of perception\npersuaded him that the perceived scene was private rather than, as\nStrawson holds, public.)\n\nHow should we think of these descriptive relations? Strawson claims in\nchapter 1 that these descriptive relations are fundamentally\nspatio-temporal. That is, my ability to think of James I rests on\nthinking of him as the person ascending the throne in 1603, the\npresent time being 2018. Ultimately I fix on him via his place in a\nspatio-temporal framework which is centred on my currently perceived\nenvironment. Strawson further points out that since we need to update\nthis relational framework over time as we move around, we need to be\nable to re-identify objects and places encountered at different times.\nStrawson draws an epistemological conclusion from this. Since our\nability to maintain a grasp on the spatio-temporal framework depends\non acceptance of such identifications it is incoherent to be sceptical\nabout the procedures we rely on to confirm them while still thinking\nin terms of the spatio-temporal framework itself. With these\nconclusions in place, Strawson returns to his fundamental question as\nto whether there is a basic category of items of reference. Some forms\nof reference seem parasitic on other forms of reference: reference to\ntheoretical entities is dependent on reference to material\nparticulars; reference to experiences, such as Mary\u2019s pain in\nher leg, are dependent on references to their subjects.\nStrawson\u2019s assumption seems to be that putting these two\ncategories to one side leaves us with two candidates for the basic\nitems of reference: material bodies (in a broad sense) and\noccurrences. Occurrences, however, cannot be basic since they too are\nstandardly picked out dependently \u2013 e.g., the fire in that\nhouse \u2013 and, moreover, according to Strawson, they do not\nform a structured framework allowing the spatio-temporal framework to\nbe grounded. Thus Strawson\u2019s conclusion: bodies (in a fairly\ninclusive sense) are referentially basic.\n\nStrawson next asks, in chapter 2, whether it is possible that there\nshould be a conceptual scheme that acknowledges the existence of\nobjective particulars but in which material bodies are not the basic\nparticulars. Since, according to the initial argument, referential\nthought rests on a spatio-temporal framework only if it rests on\nthought about bodies, this question becomes: can there be thought\nabout objective entities which doesn\u2019t involve thinking of them\nin spatial terms? To investigate this question, Strawson considers\nwhether the notion of an objective particular would be comprehensible\nto a creature with only auditory experience, the assumption being that\nauditory experience on its own is non-spatial and thus that a creature\nin such a situation wouldn\u2019t have access to spatial ways of\nthinking. What objective notions would be available to such a\ncreature? Strawson imaginatively enters into the sound world to see\nhow far ideas analogous to those that space makes available can be\nfound. The best option relies on relating individual sounds to a\ncontinuous \u2018master sound\u2019 which, as it were, defines\nsomething analogous to space. Strawson himself appears to think this\nmight work. His view thus seems to be that although spatio-temporal\nthinking rests on bodies, objective thinking cannot be shown to\nrequire spatio-temporal thinking per se, but even in cases where there\ncan be objective thought without spatio-temporal thinking, there must\nbe something in in the subject\u2019s way of thinking which performs\na role analogous to the role that thought about space performs for us.\nStrawson\u2019s argument was influentially discussed by Gareth Evans\nin \u2018Things Without the Mind\u2019 (1980), a commentary on\nchapter 2 of Individuals; further commentary can be found in\nSnowdon 2006 and Cassam 2005.\n\nIn the next chapter, entitled \u2018Persons\u2019, Strawson leaves\nbehind speculation about concepts based on attenuated experiences, and\nfocuses on our rich thought about ourselves. His argument involves a\ncomparison between three conceptions of such thought. The first is\nwhat he calls the no-ownership view. This is the view that we do not\nreally refer to ourselves when we use the first-person pronoun, even\nthough we seem to. There is nothing that owns or has the experiences\nto which to refer. Strawson\u2019s response is to argue that once\nthis view is developed, genuine self-reference emerges as involved in\nthe theory\u2019s explanation of the illusion of ownership of\nexperiences. One question for this response is whether it is a\ndecisive objection to the no-ownership theory that an incoherence\nemerges in its standard explanation as to why we tend to believe that\nour experiences are owned. Why must the no-ownership view supply such\nan explanation? The second conception is that deriving from Descartes,\naccording to which, the item that \u2018I\u2019 picks out is\nsomething distinct from the physical body. Strawson argues that this\nconception is incompatible with the principle that one can ascribe\nexperiences to oneself only if one is prepared to ascribe them to\nothers. This is because a subject can meet this requirement only if\nthey are able to pick out other subjects, and, Strawson holds, one\ncannot pick out non-spatial subjects. Strawson concludes that when we\nself-refer we refer to an entity which has two sides or aspects, the\nphysical and the mental, and not to a thing which possesses only the\nmental sort of feature, something else having the physical features.\nIn effect, Strawson is representing ordinary thought as having the\nstructure of what others have called a dual-aspect theory. Persons are\nthings with two aspects \u2013 bodily and mental. He famously\ndescribes this as the idea that the concept of a person is a\nprimitive concept. Second, since we can self-ascribe we must\nbe able to other-ascribe, and that means that our methods for doing so\nmust be adequate. As Strawson puts it, the criteria we employ for\npsychological ascription to others must be \u2018logically\nadequate\u2019. There cannot, therefore, be a genuine\nproblem of other minds. Again, as in the first chapter, Strawson\nderives a significant epistemological consequence from his conceptual\ninvestigations. This famous chapter has exercised a fascination on\nphilosophers thinking about ourselves and has been, perhaps, as much\ndiscussed as any piece of philosophical argument that Strawson wrote.\n(For interesting discussion of this chapter see Ayer 1963, Martin\n1969, and Snowdon 2009.)\n\nFinally, Strawson takes Leibniz as an opponent of some of his\nmajor theses and considers whether Leibniz might be able to avoid his\nconclusions. He argues, displaying considerable ingenuity in\nsuggesting different interpretations of Leibniz, that Leibniz does not\nescape the problems.\n\nIndividuals then shifts focus to the subject-predicate\ndistinction. Strawson\u2019s initial aim is, in effect, to show that\na novel theory is required. There are two reasons. First, we lack a\nproper explanation as to why absolutely anything can be the reference\nof a subject expression but only universals can be what predicates\nexpress. Second, he classifies the different accounts on offer and\nargues that they are either open to objection, or open to the demand\nfor further explanation. The contrast between subjects and predicates\nthat Strawson himself proposes for the central cases is that\nunderstanding a subject expression depends on the possession of\nempirical information, whereas the understanding of predicates does\nnot. For example, to understand the name \u2018James I\u2019 I need\nto know something like; there was a king who ascended the throne in\n1603. But to understand the predicate \u2018\u2026 is\ntriangular\u2019, there is no empirical information about the world\nthat I need to grasp. There need not be, or have been, any triangles\nat all. I have, rather, to grasp the principle of classification\nlinked to the term. Strawson\u2019s proposal is ingenious, but faces\na number of questions. First, is it clear that all predicates express\nprinciples of classification the grasp of which involves no empirical\nknowledge? Consider such natural kind involving predicates as\n\u2018is gold\u2019 or \u2018is a dog\u2019. Second, is it obvious\nthat understanding subject expressions requires accepting the\nempirical claims, as opposed to merely knowing what the assumptions\nare? Third, what entitles Strawson to attach a priority within his\naccount to empirical claims? Why is non-empirical discourse, such as\nmathematics, to be regarded as secondary? Strawson then attempts to\nexplain some other elucidations of the subject-predicate distinction\nas deriving from his own suggestion, and to develop a more general\ncriterion on the basis of his own account having captured the core\ncases. In the next chapter Strawson asks the very interesting and\nnovel question whether, just as the employment of (the core type of)\nsubject expressions presupposes empirical information, there is a type\nof proposition the truth of which is presupposed by subject-predicate\npropositions in general. He picks out what he calls\nfeature-placing sentences, such as \u2018It is\nraining\u2019. Such a sentence does not designate an object and\ndescribe it, rather the sentence affirms the presence of a feature.\nStrawson argues that where there are true subject-predicate\npropositions there must also be true feature-placing sentences. That\nis his answer to the question.\n\nIndividuals is far richer in argument than we have been able\nto convey. It occasioned, more or less immediately, considerable\ndebate, and has continued to do so ever since. The epistemological\nconclusions that Strawson advanced, both about bodies and about other\nminds, were closely scrutinized. The overall arguments of the chapter\non persons and the chapter on bodies were closely analysed. The\ncontrast between descriptive and revisionary metaphysics, although\nbriefly presented by Strawson, entered into the folk taxonomy of\nphilosophy. As well as occasioning disagreement, Strawson\u2019s book\nstimulated, over time, a series of books all of which could be\ndescribed as essays in descriptive metaphysics with a similar focus\nto, though not with identical conclusions to, Individuals.\nThese include Gareth Evans\u2019 The Varieties of Reference,\nJohn Campbell\u2019s Past, Space and Self, and David\nWiggins, Sameness and Substance.
