    "main_text": "Punishment\n4. Punishment\n\nThis failure of mutual recognition is taken up next at the end of\nAbstract Right in a section entitled \u201cWrong\u201d\n[Unrecht]. This section has been widely interpreted by many\nscholars to offer a clear retributivist theory of crime and punishment\n(Cooper 1971, Primoratz 1989). At first glance, it is easy to see\nwhy.\n\nHegel distinguishes three kinds of wrongs. The first is\nunintentional (PR \u00a784\u201386). This is where both individuals\nare adhering to what they believe has been mutually recognized, but one\nis unwittingly incorrect. This kind of wrong is thought to be\nunpunishable \u2013 and the reason is because both sides see\n\u201cthe recognition of right as the universal and deciding\nfactor\u201d (PR \u00a785). One side is in error, but there\nis a strict appeal to the proper recognition of right.\n\nThe second kind of wrong is deception (PR \u00a787\u201389).\nThis is more serious than unintentional wrongs because while both\nparties claim to each other that they appeal to right, one side does so\ninsincerely. Thus deception has a different and more serious character\nthan unintentional wrongs.\n\nThe third and final kind of wrong is described as\n\u201ccrime\u201d (PR \u00a790). This is where one party\nmakes no appeal at all to right. The wrong [Unrecht] that they\nseek is to deny an appeal to right. This is a direct and tangible\nthreat to mutual recognition as one party is not merely insincere, but\nacts regardless of right \u2013 and to that extent acts arbitrarily,\nand so unfreely.\n\nHegel describes crime as an infringement of right, of mutual\nrecognition (PR \u00a795 Remark). This requires what Hegel\ncalls punishment as \u201cthe restoration of right\u201d whereby what\nwas infringed is reasserted and reaffirmed (PR \u00a799). For\nexample, the punishment of theft sends a message to the thief and wider\ncommunity that this crime should not have happened \u2013 and in\npunishing the crime Hegel believes it can help to restore the right\nviolated.\n\nHis theory of punishment is widely characterized as retributivist\nand it is easy to see why. In this section, Hegel is critical of\ndeterrence and rehabilitation approaches claiming \u201cthey take it\nfor granted that punishment in and for itself is just\u201d\n(PR \u00a799 Remark). Indeed, Hegel says the cancellation of\ncrime \u201cis retribution\u201d (PR \u00a7101).\n\nBut this commonly held view is controversial for several reasons.\nHegel may call this third kind of wrong \u201ccrime,\u201d but this\nview of crime is understood in a specific way (Nicholson 1982). There\nis no state or laws, no police or judiciary (Stillman 1976). A\nhypothetical scenario lacking prisons is hardly any complete theory of\npunishment. In fact, there is neither judge nor jury in Abstract Right\nto say who is right or wrong. This is because, when we view this\nsection in its systematic context, Hegel is drawing attention to\ncertain foundational ideas about wrongs more generally (e.g., that they\nare of three kinds) and how we should respond (e.g., that crimes can\ndeserve punishment) without yet giving his full view at this point in\nthe PR.\n\nHowever, Hegel does foreshadow his later and more substantive\ndiscussion of punishment with a non-retributivist character at this\npoint (Brooks 2017a). He highlights how determinations of crimes\n\u201csuch as danger to public security\u201d have relevance in\ndetermining what punishment is ultimately justified (PR\n\u00a796 Remark). While he says crimes \u201cmore dangerous in\nitself\u201d are a more serious infringement of right, Hegel is clear\nfrom the start that consequentialist factors are relevant to the\ndetermination of punishment related to crime\u2019s impact on society\nalthough he says little more at this point (PR \u00a796\nRemark). Hegel also rejects the view he is offering a\nfull theory of punishment at this point claiming \u2013 in the absence\nof laws and courtrooms \u2013 any action taken by an individual\nagainst another to punish takes the form of \u201crevenge\u201d which\n\u201cbecomes a new infringement\u201d creating new problems\n(PR \u00a7102). It is important to note at this point that\nthese sections discussing commonly used concepts like property and\ncontract as well as crime and punishment in uncommon ways all reappear\nwhen Hegel turns his attention to the final part of Ethical Life.\n",
