Cosmopolitan Right\n\nRelations among the states of the world, covered above, are not\nexhaustive of possible political relations outside one domestic state.\nIndividuals can relate to states of which they are not members and to\nother individuals who are members of other states. In this they are\nconsidered \u201ccitizens of a universal state of human beings\u201d\nwith corresponding \u201crights of citizens of the world\u201d\n(8:349, footnote). The rights individuals have as citizens of the\nworld form the basis of cosmopolitan right. Based on these lofty\nsounding pronouncements, some writers inspired by Kant discuss\ncosmopolitan right as if it were equivalent to general human rights\nand as if it formed the foundation for worldwide progress. But general\nhuman rights in Kant would have to be found in the innate right to\nfreedom, not specifically in cosmopolitan right, and progress toward\npeace is driven more by republicanism and the behavior of states as\ndiscussed in the previous section. Kant\u2019s particular discussion\nof cosmopolitan right is restricted to the right of hospitality. Since\nall peoples share a limited amount of living space due to the\nspherical shape of the earth, the totality of which they must be\nunderstood to have originally shared in common, they must be\nunderstood to have a right to possible interaction with one another.\nThis cosmopolitan right is limited to a right to offer to engage in\ncommerce, not a right to actual commerce itself, which must always be\nvoluntary trade. A citizen of one state may try to establish links\nwith other peoples; no state is allowed to deny foreign citizens a\nright to travel in its land. And in an emergency such as a shipwreck,\nstates must provide non-citizens with temporary shelter; this\nprovision is sometimes understood as a basis for a state duty to\naccept refugees.\n\nColonial rule and settlement is another matter entirely. In his\npublished writings in the 1790s, Kant is strongly critical of the\nEuropean colonization of other lands already inhabited by other\npeoples. Settlement in these cases is allowed only by uncoerced\ninformed contract. Even land that appears empty might be used by\nshepherds or hunters and cannot be appropriated without their consent\n(6:354). These positions represent a change in Kant\u2019s thought,\nfor he had previously indicated acceptance if not endorsement of the\nEuropean colonial practices of his time and the racial hierarchy\nbehind them. Kant himself produced a theory of human racial\nclassifications and origins and thought that non-Europeans were\ninferior in various ways. Kant thought that the course of world\nprogress involved the spread of European culture and law throughout\nthe world to what he considered to be less advanced cultures and\ninferior races. By the mid-1790s, however, Kant appears to have given\nup beliefs about racial inferiority and no longer discusses it in his\nlectures. He publicly criticized European colonial practices as\nviolations of the rights of indigenous peoples who are capable of\ngoverning themselves (8:358\u201360).\n\nCosmopolitan right is an important component of perpetual peace.\nInteraction among the peoples of the world, Kant notes, has increased\nin recent times. Now \u201ca violation of right on one place of the\nearth is felt in all\u201d as peoples depend upon one another and\nknow about one another more and more (8:360). Violations of\ncosmopolitan right would make more difficult the trust and cooperation\nnecessary for perpetual peace among states. And for Kant, perpetual\npeace is the \u201chighest political good\u201d (6:355).\n",
