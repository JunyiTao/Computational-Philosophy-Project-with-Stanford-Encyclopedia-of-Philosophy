The\nfirst issue involves the correct definition of molecular structure.\nTextbooks typically describe a molecule\u2019s structure as the equilibrium\nposition of its atoms. Water\u2019s structure is thus characterized by\n104.5\u00ba angles between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom. But\nthis is a problematic notion because molecules are not static\nentities. Atoms are constantly in motion, moving in ways that we might\ndescribe as bending, twisting, rocking, and scissoring. Bader\ntherefore argues that we should think of molecular structure as the\ntopology of bond paths, or the relationships between the atoms that\nare preserved by continuous transformations (Bader 1991).\n\nA second issue concerning molecular structure is even more\nfundamental: Do molecules have the kinds of shapes and directional\nfeatures that structural formulas represent? Given the history we have\ndiscussed so far it seems like the answer is obviously yes. Indeed, a\nnumber of indirect experimental techniques including x-ray\ncrystallography, spectroscopy, and product analysis provide converging\nevidence of not only the existence of shape, but specific shapes for\nspecific molecular species.\n\nDespite this, quantum mechanics poses a challenge to the notion of\nmolecular shape. In quantum mechanical treatments of molecular\nspecies, shape doesn\u2019t seem to arise unless it is put in by hand.\n(Woolley 1978; Primas 1981; Sutcliffe & Woolley 2012).\n\nThis tension the between the familiar theories of chemical structure\nand quantum- mechanical accounts of molecules might be resolved in\nseveral ways. One might embrace eliminativism about molecular\nstructure: Quantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory, we might\nargue, and its ontology has no place for molecular structure.\nTherefore, molecular structure doesn\u2019t exist. No philosopher or\nchemist that we are aware of has endorsed this option. Another\npossible response makes a different appeal to the underlying physics.\nSomething must be breaking the wavefunction symmetries and giving\natoms locations in molecules. This might be interactions with other\nmolecules or interactions with measuring devices. Thus, molecular\nshape is partially constituted by interaction and is a relational, not\nintrinsic property (Ramsey 1997).\n\nA related option is a kind of pragmatism. Hans Primas argues that,\nstrictly speaking, a quantum mechanical description of a molecule has\nto be a whole-universe description. No matter how we draw the\nboundaries of interest around some target molecular system, in\nreality, the system is open and interacting with everything else in\nthe universe. Thus the shape of any particular molecule could be the\nresult of its interactions with anything else in the universe. We only\nget the paradox of molecules having no shape when we treat systems as\nclosed\u2014say a single methane molecule alone in the universe. It\nis fine to treat open systems as closed for pragmatic purposes, but we\nshould always understand that this is an idealization. We shouldn\u2019t\ntreat our idealizations, such as open systems being closed, as\nveridical. Hence there is no incompatibility between quantum mechanics\nand molecular shape (Primas 1981).\n\nSo despite the ubiquity of structural representations of molecules, it\nturns out that even the notion of molecular shape is not ambiguous.\nPrimas\u2019 approach, which points to the idealization in many quantum\nmechanical models, is accepted by many chemists. But there is nothing\nlike a consensus in the philosophical literature about how to\nunderstand molecular shape.\n",
