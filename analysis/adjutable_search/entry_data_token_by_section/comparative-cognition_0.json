Evolution, Development, and Culture\n\nResearch in comparative cognition takes place against a backdrop of\nevolutionary, developmental, and socioecological considerations.\nNatural selection leads to the convergence and divergence of cognitive\ntraits over evolutionary time. Cognitive traits might converge because\ntwo species face similar socioecological problems, such as navigating\na similar foraging environment. Alternatively, two species might share\ncognitive abilities because they have inherited them from a shared\nancestor or have developmental modules in common. Finally, cognitive\nabilities interact with evolution in ways that not only alter a\nspecies trajectory through phenotypic space, but their evolvability\n(Brown 2013). Considerations such as these help researchers predict\nand explain cognitive and behavioral abilities across taxa:\n\n\nOnly by investigating proximate (mechanism and ontogeny) and ultimate\n(phylogeny and function) causes can we fully understand the nature and\norigin of behavior. (Krupenye & Call 2019: 16)\n\n\nThis section presents several key ways in which evolutionary,\ndevelopmental, and socioecological considerations shape methods in\ncomparative cognition.\n",
