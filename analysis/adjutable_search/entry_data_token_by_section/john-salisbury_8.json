    "main_text": "The Body Politic\n9. Practical Philosophy\n\nJohn\u2019s supposedly non-philosophical works\u2014two substantial\nletter collections, two hagiographies, and a (brief)\nhistory\u2014attest, in various ways, to his central commitment to a\npractical philosophy. John\u2019s contemporary readers shared his\nunderstanding that all of his works both partake in the moral and\nphilosophical and have immediate, real-world relevance. Upon receiving\na copy of John\u2019s first letter collection, his close friend and\nfrequent correspondent Peter of Celle described it as \u201cseasoned\nwith philosophy, clothed in the characters of rhetoric\u201d (quoted\nin JL1, x). In myriad ways within and across his non-theoretical\ntexts, John addresses the nature of philosophy, provides examples of\nmoderate skepticism at work, outlines the parameters of moderation and\nimmoderation as to both virtues and vices, and examines the\nrelationship between the secular body politic and its ecclesiastical\nsoul.\n\nJohn often drew attention to the practical dimensions of philosophy.\nIn a passage in John\u2019s Life of Saint Anselm, for\ninstance, he expands on his critique of what he viewed as the sterile\napproach to learning\u2014both philosophy for its own sake and for a\npurpose not oriented toward the cultivation of virtue\u2014then\ndominant in the schools. John reports that Anselm, having been perhaps\noverly diligent in his studies, \u201cc[ame] back to his senses and\nwisely examin[ed] his ways\u201d, a pedagogical practice recommended\nin the Metalogicon. He then realized \u201cthat a stream of\neloquence or this world\u2019s philosophy does not confer true\nhappiness. These often produce pride \u2026\u201d (A&B: 21). In\nlight of John\u2019s sustained indictment of rampant Epicurean\ntendencies, as well as his judgment that Epicureanism is incapable of\nleading to the summum bonum, it is likely that \u201cthis\nworld\u2019s philosophy\u201d represents a retroactive reference to\nJohn\u2019s present.\n\nA number of the letters John wrote during his Becket-related exile in\nFrance include meditations on the true purpose of philosophy and the\nrole of the true philosopher. In a letter to his fellow churchman\nGerard of Pucelle, John characterizes his exile as \u201cthe trial of\nthe purpose of true philosophers \u2026 those who suffer in\ninnocence and for the defence of faith and justice\u201d (JL2:\n68\u201369). In light of the very real constraints on John\u2019s\nfinances, it is not surprising that he found comfort in the\nphilosophic tradition of rejecting worldly possessions, claiming that\n\u201c[n]othing is more fitting for a philosopher than to profess the\ntruth, reverence justice, despise the world, and, when necessary, to\nlove poverty\u201d (JL2: 68\u201369). In a letter dating to the same\nperiod, John explains to his friend Hugh, abbot of Bury St. Edmunds,\nthat philosophy is the \u201cfoster parent of virtues and governess\nof duty \u2026 She lays down that the useful and the honourable are\nlinked together by mutual predication \u2026\u201d (JL2:\n264\u201365), a distinctively Ciceronian theme. To fellow philosopher\nJohn Saracen, John casts his state of exile\u2014in language that\nboth echoes the Policraticus and calls to mind\nBoethius\u2014as conducive to philosophy, writing that he now views\nhis present condition as a\n\n\nfriend, who opened my eyes, formerly dazzled by the absurd fantasies\nof fortune, drove away courtly trifles and alluring pleasures, urged\nme on the path of virtue, and numbered me among the throngs of the\nphilosophers. (JL2: 270\u201371)\n\n\nOccupying the pinnacle of this throng, in John\u2019s estimation, is\nhis former teacher, Gilbert of Poitiers, \u201cthe most learned man\nof our day\u201d (HP: 15), whose heresy trial at the 1148 Council of\nRheims John attended and reports at length in his Historia\nPontificalis (for an analysis of John\u2019s account of the\ntrial and its aftermath, see Bollermann and Nederman 2014). Among the\nqualities that single Gilbert\u2014and, hence, the ideal (Christian)\nphilosopher\u2014out, John notes that he possessed\n\n\nthe very keenest intelligence \u2026 had read most things and\n\u2026 after spending almost sixty years in reading and close study,\nwas so learned in the liberal arts that \u2026 he was held to\nsurpass all in every subject \u2026 [and was] thoroughly conversant\nwith the [church] doctors. (HP: 16, 27)\n\n\nWhile displaying \u201cthe great moderation always habitual to\nhim\u201d, Gilbert \u201cmade use of every branch of learning as\noccasion demanded, knowing that all were consistent with each other,\nand mutually illuminating\u201d (HP: 26\u201327). These sentiments\necho and reinforce the Metalogicon\u2019s lessons on\nscholars and study.\n\nFinally, in the prologue to the Historia Pontificalis, John\ndelineates a philosophy of history firmly rooted in the practical: A\nchronicle such as his will \u201cprofit my contemporaries and future\ngenerations\u201d because it generates a record\n\n\nvaluable for establishing or abolishing customs, for strengthening or\ndestroying privileges; and nothing \u2026 teaches the living more\nsurely and soundly than knowledge of the deeds of the departed. (HP:\n3)\n\n\nJohn\u2019s mention of customs and privileges is particularly\nnoteworthy, as he wrote the Historia early in his exile, when\nKing Henry II was insisting that Becket and the English church submit\nto the so-called ancient customs and privileges his royal predecessors\nhad purportedly enjoyed.\n\nIn sum, John does not embrace the traditional doctrine that\ncontemplation is inherently superior to and more praiseworthy than\naction. Quite to the contrary, he adopts the position that the entire\npoint of philosophical inquiry is to provide guidance in the conduct\nof one\u2019s affairs. John\u2019s principles of philosophical\ninquiry should thus be viewed in the context of his broadly humanistic\nproject, namely, the identification of the features conducive to human\nhappiness. Throughout his writings, he stresses that philosophy ought\nnot to be a specialized, dry, and obscure pursuit, but rather an\nintegral feature of an active, dutiful, and devout life within the\npolitical arena. Philosophical investigation is to be valued because\nknowledge and its by-products (including social order and virtue)\npromote the earthly summum bonum of humanity. In contrast to\nthe Epicureans, whom he observes abounding at court, John\u2019s\nstandard of living well is not found in the physical comfort\nassociated with wealth, power, status, and luxury. Rather, he proposes\nthat wisdom, properly attained, promotes the useful goods of virtue,\nqualities of the human soul that ultimately generate the highest\ndegree of happiness. We should desire to be wise and virtuous, John\nbelieves, because we will thereby fulfill our natural (and divinely\nordained) purpose as human beings. And when we flourish in this way,\nwe cannot fail to become happy in the way God intended.\n\nThis basic orientation of mind constitutes the core of John\u2019s\nmain contributions to philosophy. The Metalogicon is meant to\nbe a practical guidebook to such happiness through a morally-guided\nquest for knowledge, a goal that John regards to be of far greater\nworth and far more befitting the philosopher than the technical\npursuits too commonly found in the schools. Likewise, in proposing the\npolitical ideas of the Policraticus, he sought to illustrate\nthe principle that philosophy provides invaluable aid in achieving the\ngood life of both the individual and the entire community. The\nvitality of John\u2019s thought consists primarily in its\nconfrontation with the tensions between the demands of everyday life,\nwhether in the classroom or at court, and the requirements of living\nwell in a moral and religious sense. His vision of philosophy is the\nself-consciously practical one of revealing how our moral and\nintellectual characteristics may help us to navigate toward lives that\nare fulfilling on earth, while also attaining the ultimate heavenly\nreward. Much of John\u2019s career proves a testament to his\nconviction that philosophy only possesses value to the extent that it\nshapes our choices and actions.\n\nTracing the philosophical lineage of John\u2019s thought through his\nlater works illustrates the essential unity of his intellectual\nperspective. He did not discriminate radically between his speculative\nand his practical work. On the contrary, he seems to have\nenthusiastically incorporated philosophical principles into the\nconduct of his everyday life as well as his analysis of contemporary\nevents and personalities. Philosophy for John was not to be left at\nthe schoolhouse door, for it ought to occupy an important place in the\nworld at large. The task of philosophical discourse is to aid in\ndiscerning the good from the evil, the true from the false, and so to\nilluminate the path toward happiness by navigating the tricky by-ways\nof public life.\n",
