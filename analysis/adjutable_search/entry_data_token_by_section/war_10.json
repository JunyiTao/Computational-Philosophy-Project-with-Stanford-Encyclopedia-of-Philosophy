    "main_text": "Jus ad Bellum || Last Resort (Necessity)\n3.5 Last Resort (Necessity)\n\nAre pre-emptive wars, fought in anticipation of an imminent enemy\nattack, permissible? What of preventive wars, in which the assault\noccurs prior to the enemy having any realistic plan of attack (see, in\ngeneral, Shue and Rodin 2007)? Neoconservatives have recently argued,\nsuperficially plausibly, that the criterion of last resort can be\nsatisfied long before the enemy finally launches an attack (see\nPresident 2002). The right answer here is boringly familiar. In\nprinciple, of course this is possible. But, in practice, we almost\nalways overestimate the likelihood of success from military means and\noverlook the unintended consequences of our actions. International law\nmust therefore retain its restrictions, to deter the kind of\noverzealous implementation of the last-resort principle that we saw in\nthe 2003 invasion of Iraq (Buchanan and Keohane 2004; Luban 2004).\n\nAnother frequently discussed question: what does the\n\u201clast\u201d in last resort really mean? The idea is simple, and\nis identical to in bello necessity. Going to war must be\ncompared with the alternative available strategies for dealing with\nthe enemy (which also includes the various ways in which we could\nsubmit). Going to war is literally a last resort when no other\navailable means has any prospect of averting the threat. But our\ncircumstances are not often this straitened. Other options always have\nsome chance of success. So if you have a diplomatic\nalternative to war, which is less harmful than going to war, and is at\nleast as likely to avert the threat, then going to war is not a last\nresort. If the diplomatic alternative is less harmful, as well as less\nlikely to avert the threat, then the question is whether the reduction\nin expected harm is great enough for us to be required to accept the\nreduction in likelihood of averting the threat. If not, then war is\nyour last\n resort.[13]\n",
