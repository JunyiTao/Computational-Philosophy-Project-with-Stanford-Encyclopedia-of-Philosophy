    "main_text": "Touch and Action\n8. Pleasant Touch\nA final area of increasing philosophical investigation concerns the\nrole of pleasure and pain in perception, something typically referred\nto as\n \u201caffect\u201d.[5]\n The question is central to our full\nunderstanding of the richness and complexity of perceptual\nexperience. While perception is often assumed to be entirely receptive\nand descriptive, it is just as often evaluative and motivational. When\nwe smell something awful or see something graphic, we have intense\nreactions to these experiences, and are directly motivated to act in\nvarious ways. These forms of affective perceptual experience seemingly\nbridge the gap between experience, emotion, and evaluative\njudgment. For these reason, there are many importantly different\naccounts available for explaining the valenced nature of these\nexperiences.\nTouch again is an excellent source for such investigation. Our\ntactual experiences often seem to have a felt pleasant or unpleasant\ncharacter. This isn\u2019t simply an\nassociated but distinct state of pleasure or pain that accompanies the\nperceptual experience, but part of the perceptual experience\nitself. Paradigm examples include the pleasure derived from delicious\nfood or the awfulness of certain bad smells. Here again, touch is\nready for increased investigation. In recent\nyears, researchers have discovered a specialized class of afferent\nnerve channels that seem to be responsible for the experience of\npleasantness (L\u00f6ken et al. 2009; McGlone et al. 2012). These\nchannels, called CT-Afferents, are maximally responsive to\nslow, regular activations like those generated by a feather pulled\ngently across the arm. These channels seem like pleasant versions of\nthe famous C-fibers implicated in pain experiences.\nWhile the discovery of these afferents has been an exciting\ndevelopment in our understanding of affective perceptual experience,\nthey also raise many questions. How can a receptor \u201ccode for\npleasantness\u201d? Are there other similar receptors for pleasant\ntouch in glabrous skin (the smooth, hairless skin of the lips and\npalms where they are no CT\u2013afferents). What do these receptors\nmean for our understanding of pleasure and pain and affective\nexperience more generally? And returning to where we started, we can\nseriously wonder whether and to what extent the CT system seems to be\na part of touch. The CT system seems, unlike that for cutaneous pain,\nto be a genuine component of the touch system; on the other hand, the\nCT system also doesn\u2019t appear to have any direct discriminative\nfunction. CT interactions reveal much about the complex ways in which\nemotions and motivation can come to be closely connected to perceptual\nexperience. They can also be seen as a bridge to a better\nunderstanding of affiliative touch, the close form of caring touch\nthat forms an essential element of social bonding and human\ndevelopment, especially of the immune system (Field 2003). This should\nprove to be an area of increasing research.\n\nIn addition, the unique aesthetic properties of touch have recently been explored by Korsmeyer (2019, 2020). In particular she has, explored the ways in which direct contact with objects mediated by touch can confer a sense of authenticity and value to an object that it cannot get through any other modality. This connects with recent trends in tangible art installations that encourage rather than prohibit direct contact and exploration. \n\n",
