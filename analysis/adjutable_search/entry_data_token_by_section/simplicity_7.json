    "main_text": "Other Issues Concerning Simplicity || Principles of Plenitude\n6.2 Principles of Plenitude\n\nRanged against the principles of parsimony discussed in previous\nsections is an equally firmly rooted (though less well-known)\ntradition of what might be termed \u201cprinciples of explanatory\n sufficiency.\u201d[22]\n These principles have their origins in the same medieval\ncontroversies that spawned Occam\u2019s Razor. Ockham\u2019s contemporary,\nWalter of Chatton, proposed the following counter-principle to Occam\u2019s\nRazor:\n\n[I]f three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition\nabout things, a fourth must be added, and so on (quoted in Maurer\n1984, p. 464).\n\n\nA related counter-principle was later defended by Kant:\n\nThe variety of entities should not be rashly diminished (Kant\n1781/1787, p. 541).\n\nEntium varietates non temere esse minuendas.\n\n\nThere is no inconsistency in the coexistence of these two families of\nprinciples, for they are not in direct conflict with each other.\nConsiderations of parsimony and of explanatory sufficiency function as\nmutual counter-balances, penalizing theories which stray into\nexplanatory inadequacy or ontological\n excess.[23]\n What we see here is an historical echo of the contemporary debate\namong statisticians concerning the proper trade-off between simplicity\nand goodness of fit.\n\nThere is, however, a second family of principles which do appear\ndirectly to conflict with Occam\u2019s Razor. These are so-called\n\u2018principles of plenitude.\u2019 Perhaps the best-known version\nis associated with Leibniz, according to whom God created the best of\nall possible worlds with the greatest number of possible entities.\nMore generally, a principle of plenitude claims that if it is\npossible for an object to exist then that object\nactually exists. Principles of plenitude conflict with\nOccam\u2019s Razor over the existence of physically possible but\nexplanatorily idle objects. Our best current theories presumably do\nnot rule out the existence of unicorns, but nor do they provide any\nsupport for their existence. According to Occam\u2019s Razor we ought\nnot to postulate the existence of unicorns. According to a\nprinciple of plenitude we ought to postulate their\nexistence.\n\nThe rise of particle physics and quantum mechanics in the\n20th Century led to various principles of plenitude being\nappealed to by scientists as an integral part of their theoretical\nframework. A particularly clear-cut example of such an appeal is the\ncase of magnetic\n monopoles.[24]\n The 19th-century theory of electromagnetism postulated\nnumerous analogies between electric charge and magnetic charge. One\ntheoretical difference is that magnetic charges must always come in\noppositely-charged pairs, called \u201cdipoles\u201d (as in the\nNorth and South poles of a bar magnet), whereas single electric\ncharges, or \u201cmonopoles,\u201d can exist in isolation. However,\nno actual magnetic monopole had ever been observed. Physicists began\nto wonder whether there was some theoretical reason why monopoles\ncould not exist. It was initially thought that the newly developed\ntheory of quantum mechanics ruled out the possibility of magnetic\nmonopoles, and this is why none had ever been detected. However, in\n1931 the physicist Paul Dirac showed that the existence of monopoles\nis consistent with quantum mechanics, although it is not required by\nit. Dirac went on to assert the existence of monopoles, arguing that\ntheir existence is not ruled out by theory and that \u201cunder these\ncircumstances one would be surprised if Nature had made no use of\nit\u201d (Dirac 1930, p. 71, note 5). This appeal to plenitude was\nwidely\u2014though not universally\u2014accepted by other\nphysicists.\n\nOne of the elementary rules of nature is that, in the absence of laws\nprohibiting an event or phenomenon it is bound to occur with some\ndegree of probability. To put it simply and crudely: anything that\ncan happen does happen. Hence physicists must assume\nthat the magnetic monopole exists unless they can find a law barring\nits existence (Ford 1963, p. 122).\n\n\nOthers have been less impressed by Dirac\u2019s line of argument:\n\nDirac\u2019s\u2026line of reasoning, when conjecturing the existence of\nmagnetic monopoles, does not differ from 18th-century\narguments in favour of mermaids\u2026[A]s the notion of mermaids was\nneither intrinsically contradictory nor colliding with current\nbiological laws, these creatures were assumed to\n exist.[25]\n\n\nIt is difficult to know how to interpret these principles of\nplenitude. Quantum mechanics diverges from classical physics by\nreplacing of a deterministic model of the universe with a model based\non objective probabilities. According to this probabilistic model,\nthere are numerous ways the universe could have evolved from its\ninitial state, each with a certain probability of occurring that is\nfixed by the laws of nature. Consider some kind of object, say\nunicorns, whose existence is not ruled out by the initial conditions\nplus the laws of nature. Then one can distinguish between a weak and a\nstrong version of the principle of plenitude. According to the weak\nprinciple, if there is a small finite probability of unicorns existing\nthen given enough time and space unicorns will exist. According to the\nstrong principle, it follows from the theory of quantum mechanics that\nif it is possible for unicorns to exist then they do exist. One way in\nwhich this latter principle may be cashed out is in the\n\u2018many-worlds\u2019 interpretation of quantum mechanics,\naccording to which reality has a branching structure in which every\npossible outcome is realized.\n",
