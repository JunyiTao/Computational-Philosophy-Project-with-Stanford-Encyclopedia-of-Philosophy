    "main_text": "Life and Works || Paris\n1.4 Paris\n\nUpon returning to Europe, Humboldt spent a short time in Berlin, but\nquickly decided to move to Paris, which he made his home from the end\nof 1807 until 1827. It was in Paris that he compiled and published his\nworks on the Americas, which were mainly in French. But he also\npublished in German during this period, most notably the work he later\ndescribed as his \u201cfavorite\u201d, Ansichten der Natur\n(BVE: 244). Ansichten der Natur, a collection of essays,\noriginally contained only three essays (1808) but in its final\niteration (1846) included eight essays. In each new edition, Humboldt\nalso added annotations, which in some instances became longer than the\noriginal text. The annotations sought to updated readers with new\nfindings, draw on Humboldt\u2019s later expeditions, or, in the case\nof the \u201cRhodische Genius\u201d, recant earlier\nviews.\n\nIn 1811, Humboldt published Essai politique sur le royaume de la\nNouvelle-Espagne [Political Essay on the Kingdom of New\nSpain](2 vols, 1811), in which he criticizes the Spanish colonial\nadministration for its mismanagement of the natural world, points to\nthe variety of injustices faced by the Indigenous peoples of Mexico\n(Nouvelle-Espagne 2: 128\u20139; KNS 1: 328), and argues\nthat the destruction of nature will inevitably result in the\ndestruction of culture. It was around the same time that he published\nVues des Cordill\u00e8res, et monumens des peuples\nindig\u00e8nes de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique (1810\u20131813),\nwhich includes sixty-nine expensive artistic plates that present\nartifacts of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, and thereby\nchallenges the view that the Americas are a \u201crealm of\nnature\u201d with neither culture, nor agriculture. As in the\nEssai politique sur le royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne, so\nalso in this text, Humboldt criticizes claims concerning the\ninferiority of Indigenous American cultures. \n\nBetween 1805 and 1834 Humboldt published Voyage aux regions\n\u00e9quinoxiales du nouveau continent, fait en 1799, 1800, 1802,\n1803 et 1804 [Voyage to the Equinoctial Regions of the New\nContinent, from the years 1799\u20131804], which includes thirty\nfolio and quarto volumes. This work is a compilation of some of\nHumboldt\u2019s major writings alongside his unfinished narrative of\nthe American journey, Relation historique du voyage aux regions\n\u00e9quinoxiales du Nouveau Continent (3 volumes: 1814)\n[Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the\nNew Continent during the Years 1799\u20131804].\n\nIn 1826, Humboldt published Essai politique sur l\u2019ile de\nCuba [Political Essay on the Island of Cuba]. In Chapter\n6 Humboldt highlights Cuba\u2019s growing dependency on slavery, and\nargues for the need to change the policy: \n\n\nTo remedy evil, to avoid public danger, to console the misfortunes of\na race who suffer, and who are feared more than is acknowledged, the\nwound must be probed. (L\u2019ile de Cuba 1: 123; DA 3: 66;\nPN 7: 106) \n\n\nImportantly, Humboldt did not simply call for the end of slavery, but\nalso provided insights into how this can be brought about\n(L\u2019ile de Cuba 1: 317\u20138, 333; DA 3: 157\u20138,\n167\u20139; see also Walls 2009\u20135).\n",
