    "main_text": "Philosophy of Economics\n5. Philosophy of Economics\n\n Jevons seems to be a mathematical, deductive economist. Market\nprices are derived directly from a series of fundamental motive forces,\nsuch as \u201cthe mechanics of utility and self-interest\u201d. Markets are\ndepicted in the most abstract fashion and economic agents are perfectly\nrational, perfectly foresighted and in possession of perfect\ninformation. A perfectly rational human being would anticipate\nfuture feelings and include discounted future utility in his\ncalculations. However, this ability varies according to certain\ncircumstances, as there are \u201cthe intellectual standing of the race, or\nthe character of the individual\u201d (Jevons 1879: 34). The ability\nof foresight depends on the state of civilisation: the class or race\nwith the most foresight will work most for the future, because a\npowerful feeling for the future is the main incentive to industry and\nsaving. Moreover, even the \u2018quality\u2019 of tastes increases with\nevery improvement of civilisation. Jevons' conception of an\neconomic agent should therefore be altered according to the\ninstitutional setting in which the agent appears (the class or race to\nwhich the individual belongs).\n\n Michael White elaborates on Jevons' use of the concepts of\n\u2018character\u2019 (White 1994a), \u2018gender\u2019 (White\n1994b) and \u2018race\u2019 (White 1993). Jevons' work was not\ndirected to the explanation of the behaviour of specific individuals\nper se, unless these individuals were representative for all market\nparticipants of a certain uniform character. The science of economics\ndeals with the lowest motives, and the Theory contains\n\u2018representative individuals\u2019, which behave in the way\nrequired by the Theory. All economic actors do not have to\nbehave in exactly the same way, but disturbing causes would balance\nand therefore the \u2018representative individual\u2019 may be an\nappropriate model for the Theory. The theory is however\nindeterminate in cases when more information is required. For example,\nit is unclear whether an increase in the real wage rate, proportionate\nto an increase in labour productivity, results in increased or reduced\nhours of work. More information about the \u2018character\u2019 of\nthe person under consideration is required: whereas learned\nprofessionals might be expected to work more severely, common\nlabourers might prefer idleness over labour and prefer greater\n\u2018ease\u2019 in the case of rising real incomes. Irish labourers\nare said to be responsible for the higher mortality rates in several\ndistricts, because Jevons considered the Irish to be a race that would\nbecome more easily subject to drunkenness. The proper place of women\nis the home: women with children younger than three years should not\nbe allowed to work, as this would only give rise no a neglect of the\nchildren, and would encourage the males to choose for idleness. In all\nthese cases, the characters of labourers, Irish people or women are\ntaken for granted, and are not in need of further explanation. The\nVictorian middle-class is used as a yardstick for evaluation.\n",
