Monads are more or less perfect depending\nupon the clarity of their perceptions, and a monad is dominant over\nanother when the one contains reasons for what happens in the other.\nBut some monads can also rise to the level of souls when, for\nexample, they experience sensations, that is, when their\nperceptions are very distinct and accompanied by memory. This is a\nposition occupied by animals. Furthermore, some souls are sometimes\nalso in a position to engage in apperception, that is, to\nreflect on their inner states or perceptions. As Leibniz tells us in\nthe Principles of Nature and Grace, \u201cit is good to\ndistinguish between perception, which is the internal state of\nthe monad representing external things, and apperception,\nwhich is consciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this\ninternal state, something not given to all souls, nor at all times to a\ngiven soul\u201d (G VI 600/AG 208). The point that Leibniz wants to\nmake is clearly an anti-Cartesian one: it is not the case that animals\nlack souls and are mere machines. There is a continuum here from God,\nangels, and human beings through animals to stones and the dull monads\nwhich underlie the muck and grime of the world; and this continuum is\nnot solely to be understood in terms of the comparative clarity of the\nmind's perceptions but also in terms of the kinds of mental\nactivity possible for a particular being. Indeed, according to Leibniz,\nanimals operate not as mere automata as they do in the Cartesian\nphilosophy, but rather have fairly sophisticated mental faculties. Even\na dog, for example, is capable, by virtue of its memory, of having a\nperception of a prior perception: \u201c[t]hat is why a dog runs away\nfrom the stick with which he was beaten, because his memory represents\nto him the pain which the stick caused him\u201d (G VI 600/AG 208).\nWhile this resembles reasoning, it is not the kind of reasoning that\nhuman beings are capable of; for the mental processes of the dog are\n\u201conly founded in the memory of facts or effects, and not\nat all in the knowledge of causes\u201d (ibid.). At the same\ntime, Leibniz is quick to add that the mental activity of the dog is\nthe same as the mental activity of human beings in three\nfourths of their actions, for most of us most of the time are not\nactually reasoning from causes to effects. And yet we are different\nfrom the beasts, Leibniz believes. Some creatures are capable of\nknowing the necessary and eternal truths of logic and mathematics and\na priori truths (from cause to effect), and they \u201care\nproperly called rational animals, and their souls are called\nminds.\u201d (G VI 601/AG 209) As Leibniz says, \u201cThese\nsouls are capable of performing reflective acts, and capable of\nconsidering what is called \u201dI\u201c, substance, soul, mind\n\u2013 in brief, immaterial things and immaterial truths. And that is\nwhat makes us capable of the sciences of demonstrative\nknowledge\u201d (ibid.). Thus, what makes human beings (and higher\nminds) special is the capacity, via apperception, to formulate a\nconception of the self. Indeed, as we see in this passage,\nLeibniz suggests that rationality itself follows from the capacity for\nreflection: we begin with a conception of the self; we move from this\npoint to thinking of being, of substance, of God; and we become aware\nas well of eternal and necessary truths. Rationality, however, is\nreally only the ability to form \u201cindubitable connection[s] of\nideas\u201d and to follow them to their \u201cinfallible\nconsequences\u201d (ibid.). In other words, animals and most human\nbeings most of the time are purely empiricists; a rational person,\nhowever, is one who can engage in genuine a priori reasoning,\nmoving from knowledge of a true cause via deduction to necessary\neffects.\n",
