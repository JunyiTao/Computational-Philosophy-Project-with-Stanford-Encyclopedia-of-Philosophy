    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Cognitivism and Non-Cognitivism\n1.3 Cognitivism and Non-Cognitivism\n\nWe can divide metaethical positions into two kinds: cognitivist and\nnon-cognitivist. Cognitivists hold that moral\nstatements\u2014statements such as \u201cLying is wrong\u201d and\n\u201cCourage is a virtue\u201d\u2014have truth-values, being\neither true or false. Cognitivists maintain that when one sincerely\nmakes a moral statement in an ordinary context, one believes the\nproposition expressed by the statement. Non-cognitivists hold that\nmoral statements are not truth-evaluable: moral statements are neither\ntrue nor false, being more akin to utterances such as (a)\n\u201cHaggis, YUCK!\u201d or (b) \u201cTake the haggis away!\u201d\nJust as, when one sincerely utters (a) or (b), one does not express a\nbelief, but does something else, non-cognitivists maintain that one\ndoes something other than express a belief when one makes a moral\nstatement. The early non-cognitivists A.J. Ayer (1936) and R.M. Hare\n(1952) maintained that moral statements were akin to utterances (a)\nand (b) respectively, that is, they express either emotive reactions\nor commands. Other forms of non-cognitivism propose different accounts\nof exactly what one does when one makes a moral statement (see entry\non\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism).\n Since non-cognitivism holds that we do not express beliefs when we\nmake moral statements, there is no reason for non-cognitivists to\nthink that there are any moral beliefs\u2014according to\nnon-cognitivism, even though moral statements typically have the form\nof declarative sentences, there are no moral propositions that\ncorrespond to them. If there are no moral beliefs or propositions,\nthere is no a priori moral justification or a priori\nmoral knowledge. So, the question of whether some moral propositions\ncan be justified a priori really comes up only in the context\nof cognitivism.\n\nHowever, many non-cognitivists want to vindicate as much of actual\nmoral thought and practice as possible, particularly quasi-realists\nsuch as Simon Blackburn (1993) and Alan Gibbard (2003). While denying\nthat there are, strictly speaking, moral propositions that are true or\nfalse (or moral beliefs, or moral arguments that are valid or\ninvalid), they would at the same time maintain that in the moral realm\nthere are things close enough to propositions, truth, belief, and\nvalidity that our practice of speaking of such things as moral beliefs\nand these beliefs being true or false makes sense. And such theorists\nwould certainly want to allow that moral beliefs can be better or\nworse in a way that closely corresponds to beliefs being more or less\nepistemically justified, strictly understood. So there are interesting\nquestions about whether there is something closely akin to a\npriori moral justification (and knowledge) on these views. But in\nthis entry we will limit ourselves to cognitivist theories.\n\nMoreover, serious questions regarding a priori moral\nknowledge and justification arise only for non-error-theoretic\nversions of cognitivism. Error theories, such as J.L. Mackie\u2019s,\nhold that moral statements express propositions, and hence are true or\nfalse, but that these propositions are all false. Moral propositions\nare systematically false because they presuppose something radically\nmistaken. Mackie claims they presuppose the existence of objectively\nprescriptive moral facts, when there are no such facts (1977: Ch. 1;\nbut see Berker 2019, which contests the standard interpretation of\nMackie presented here). A person could be justified in believing a\nfalse proposition, but one could not know it. And it is difficult to\nsee how one could even be justified a priori in believing a\nproposition of a type that is systematically false because it makes a\nradically mistaken presupposition. Thus, this entry focuses on\nnon-error-theoretic versions of cognitivism.\n\nHaving discussed some metaethical theories such as cognitivism and\nnon-cognitivism, we should pause to distinguish claims regarding a\npriori knowledge or justification of moral evaluations from\nclaims regarding a priori knowledge or justification of\nmeta-ethical propositions, such as that moral statements do not\nexpress propositions. Much meta-ethical theorizing is presented as an\nanalysis of moral language, and it seems likely that those involved\nthink of themselves as conducting an a priori inquiry. It\nwould be interesting to devote more specific attention to a\npriori meta-ethical epistemology, but we are concerned\nmostly with a priori knowledge or justification of moral\npropositions.\n\nWe focus almost exclusively on moral theories from the 20th\ncentury and later; the exception is Kant, with whom we begin. After\nbriefly discussing Kant, we move on to the non-naturalist moral\ntheories presented in the early part of the 20th century by\nMoore and Ross. We then consider naturalist moral theories developed\nmuch later in the 20th century, and close by considering\nparticularism and more recent versions of intuitionism that are\ndescendants of the positions developed by Moore and Ross.\n",
