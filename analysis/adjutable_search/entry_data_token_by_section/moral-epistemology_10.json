Quine, who introduced naturalized\nepistemology five decades ago (Quine 1969a), urges epistemologists to\nrenounce the project of explaining knowledge a priori, from first\nprinciples, thus independently of science. The traditional approach to\nknowledge had been to reason about the possibility of knowledge and\nabout the kinds of things that can be known without assuming from the\noutset that we already possess considerable knowledge through science.\nEven the classical empiricists, who argued that knowledge derives\nultimately from sense experience, defended this perspective without\nrelying primarily on scientific theories to establish their\nconclusions. Hume, in particular, was led to a skeptical conclusion\nregarding the possibility of justifying the methods used in reasoning\nfrom experience. He thought any justification of inductive reasoning\nthat uses such reasoning would be circular (Hume, An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, Book I, Sections IV-V). Quine,\nhowever, dismisses such circularity as a problem for two reasons.\nFirst, the prospect of reasoning independently of all empirical\nassumptions is a will-o-the-wisp, and second, the most troubling source\nof skepticism arises from the present scientific understanding of how\nperception works and hence should be resolved by science itself. Thus,\nQuine advocates that epistemology be carried out within science.\n\n\nThough this suggestion is highly controversial and not all who\nfollow Quine\u2019s lead are prepared to endorse the radical form of\nnaturalized epistemology in which epistemology becomes part of science,\nthe idea of enlisting science in the task of understanding how\nknowledge is possible has gained wide acceptance (Kornblith 1994). We\nneed to consider, then, what the implications are for moral\nepistemology in particular. Does naturalized epistemology logically\nentail moral naturalism? In fact, their relationship is more complex.\nIt is possible to accept the former but reject the latter without\nevident contradiction. Many philosophers who are attracted to\nnaturalized epistemology believe that the natural world is morally\nneutral in itself. From their standpoint the project of naturalizing\nepistemology is only to understand how non-moral knowledge is possible\nby drawing on the resources of science. Quine himself is in this\ncategory. On the other hand, it is possible to believe that moral\nproperties are natural properties but hold that the principles of\nreasoning that allow one to reach this conclusion are not themselves to\nbe explained by science. It is one thing to think, for example, that\nacting rightly is the same as maximizing pleasure over pain; it is\nquite another to think that science can tell us whether these\nproperties of actions are at bottom the same.\n\n\nNevertheless, while naturalized epistemology and moral naturalism\nare logically distinct, it is arguable that anyone who subscribes to\nnaturalized epistemology and believes that moral knowledge is possible\nshould be a moral naturalist. For if moral knowledge is part of\nknowledge and all knowledge is to be explained within science, then\nmoral knowledge itself must be explainable within science, and that\nwould be possible, it would seem, only if moral properties were natural\nproperties that we learn to identify empirically. There exist, however,\nseveral major problems for anyone who endorses both moral naturalism\nand naturalized epistemology, at least in the radical form advocated by\nQuine. The reason is that the strategies that seem promising for\naddressing standard objections to naturalized epistemology are in\ntension with the possibility of moral knowledge. Consideration of two\nstandard objections shows how strategies for coping with them can lead\nto difficulty.\n5.1.1 Losing the normative dimension of moral knowledge\n\n\nOne standard objection to including epistemology within science is\nthat science is committed to providing only an adequate description of\nthe natural world and cannot tell us the world ought to be.\nEpistemology, in marked contrast, is a normative enterprise. It is\nsupposed to tell us how we ought to reason from evidence and\nhow we ought to justify our beliefs, not merely tell us how we\ndo reason or how we do go about justifying them. By\nincluding epistemology within science, therefore, we rob it of\nnormative content that is essential to its being epistemology (Kim\n1988). A promising reply is to dispute the assumption that science is\nmerely a descriptive enterprise, lacking in any normative content. It\nmay be argued that in science the normative and the descriptive are\nboth present. Not only are normative assumptions implicit in scientific\npractice, but these assumptions can be the subject of intense debate\nand reflection within science. Indeed, any adequate description of\nscientific practice bears out this sociological observation. The\nobjection rests on a false premise (Campbell 1998).\n\n\nThe problem is to work out this line of reply for naturalized moral\nepistemology. What is often a matter of intense debate is what\nstandards of evidence are appropriate for testing a certain type of\ntheory. Normative concerns are present in the form of worries about\nepistemic standards, such as the role of statistical significance in\npsychological experiments. But epistemic standards are not moral\nstandards. To develop a parallel defense to the charge that the moral\ndimension is missing from naturalized moral epistemology, we would have\nto argue that moral values are operating in science and further that we\ncan decide which moral values are appropriate for science through\nscientific debate. Many would agree that moral values, such as honesty,\ntrust, and loyalty, do operate in science, but not many are prepared to\nconcede that matters critical to moral epistemology can be decided by\nthe methods of science. Can science tell us, for example, how we would\nknow when honesty should be sacrificed for the sake of loyalty?\n\n\nIn the face of this challenge it may be tempting for a believer in\nthe possibility of moral knowledge simply to reject the project of\nnaturalizing moral epistemology. An immediate difficulty in taking this\nway out is the close connection between this project and moral\nnaturalism, together with the role that the latter theory plays in\naddressing the ontological problems raised in section 3. Earlier\nwe noted how the naturalizing project in moral epistemology can lead a\nbeliever in moral knowledge toward moral naturalism. The reverse is\nalso true for a person who accepts a naturalized epistemology for\nnon-moral knowledge. If such a person thinks that moral features of the\nworld can be found among its natural properties and that these\nproperties can be investigated empirically, she will have a hard time\nexplaining why science is incapable of explaining what these moral\nproperties are and how we can know them. In sum, we may need moral\nnaturalism to address the ontological problems for moral knowledge, but\nthen we are led to a naturalized moral epistemology and to the\nchallenge now before us.\n\n\nOne source of resistance to moral epistemology being part of science\nmay be the picture of scientists trying to decide moral questions by\nreference to graphs, lab reports, and print-outs from machines, as if\nthe answer to moral questions might be read off of data sheets. We have\nalready noted that his picture of scientific practice is excessively\nnarrow. It fails to reflect the fact that scientists debate the\nimplications of their data and debate the merits of the epistemic\nstandards used in their debates. The key issue then is whether it is\npossible to draw a line between these debates and moral ones and to\ndeclare moral debates to lie outside of science proper. Although Quine\napparently thought this possible, his holistic approach to matters of\nevidence suggests otherwise. If moral beliefs have truth-value, as\nmoral naturalism implies, then the \u201cweb of belief\u201d to which Quine often\nalludes would include moral beliefs (White 1986, Jack Nelson 1996).\nRecall that a moral naturalist will invoke moral facts to explain\ncertain non-moral facts, for example, the fact that American chattel\nslavery was so morally repugnant to explain, in part, the extent of the\nresistance to it at the time of the American civil war (Sturgeon 1985).\nIf this kind of interaction between the moral and the non-moral is on\nthe cards, it would be odd to preclude moral questions a priori from\nscientific discussion.\n\n\nA number of recent articles and books have defended a holistic\napproach to the place of moral value within scientific and other\nempirical investigations, recognizing moral claims as being\nepistemically interdependent with claims about non-moral facts (White\n1981, Sturgeon 1985, Miller 1992, Lynn Nelson 1996, Rottschaefer 1998,\nCampbell 1998). Though a review of that literature is beyond the scope\nof this essay, it is worth stressing that this conception of science is\nnot widely held and that if it were generally accepted by scientists,\nthen the practice of science would change significantly. The position\nthat is entertained here in response to the last difficulty is not that\ncurrent science routinely and effectively engages in moral discussion,\nmuch less that current science provides a model for such discussion.\nThe point is that there may be no principled reason to exclude this\npossibility for the future direction of science and that there may be\nprincipled reasons to allow it, given the epistemological implications\nof moral naturalism.\n5.1.2 Global skepticism and the problem of circularity\n\n\nA second standard objection to naturalized epistemology is that it\ngives up the project of answering the global skeptic and as a\nconsequence fails to address, much less resolve, a central issue in\nepistemology. It must surrender this project because by operating\nwithin science it assumes that we already have some knowledge and hence\nbegs the question against the global skeptic. For example, Quine\nappeals to Darwin to explain why our native inductive tendencies (used\nsay in tracking the location of middle-sized objects moving in our\nimmediate vicinity) must do better than chance in getting the right\nanswer or else the tendencies would have been selected against long ago\n(Quine 1969b). Yet in assuming that we have good inductive grounds to\nbelieve Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, we justify induction by assuming\nthat it is justified and thereby reason in a circle.\n\n\nTwo kinds of replies to this objection are worth considering. The\nfirst, suggested in the brief statement of Quine\u2019s new methodology, is\nto reject the old problem as based on the false presupposition that one\ncan vindicate scientific and other knowledge on the basis of\npropositions that are knowable a priori. The difficulty with this\nresponse is that it raises the difficult issues of whether a priori\nknowledge is possible and whether we can determine an answer to that\nquestion a posteriori. Another reply, perhaps more in keeping with the\nspirit of naturalized epistemology, is not to dismiss global skepticism\nout of hand, but to allow science to attempt to explain science within\nits own terms, recognizing that the effort will be circular but\ndefending its legitimacy. The effort is legitimate, it might be argued,\nbecause the circularity does not guarantee the success of the effort.\nThe appeal to Darwin, for example, may not succeed, either because\nDarwin\u2019s theory is overthrown or because a necessary background\nassumption (say that our native inductive tendencies are gene linked)\nis contradicted by the evidence. In fact, Quine allowed that the\nproject to explain science from within science could defeat itself, in\nthe end vindicating the skeptic (Quine 1981, p. 22). On this approach\nknowledge claims are always open to questioning and perhaps rejection\ndown the road. Any justification that is offered for induction or\nclaims of knowledge based on induction is ultimately fallible and\nrevisable.\n\n\nCan this kind of answer to the circularity charge be extended to\nnaturalized moral epistemology? Can we offer the moral skeptic the same\nkind of reply? It may be that we cannot, since the two cases appear to\nbe importantly different. While we may consider global skepticism an\ninteresting theoretical challenge, few of us feel the need to address\nit before getting on with our lives. We may be content to follow the\nadvice that we assume that we already know many things and then (if we\nare so inclined) attempt to explain how we know so much, relying on\nwhat we already think we know. With moral skepticism the situation\nappears different. Most of us are far more prone to doubt the\npossibility of moral knowledge than we are to question whether we know\nanything at all. Moral doubts affect our confidence in making daily\nmoral decisions. Thus, to follow the former advice and assume for now\nthat we know what we believe we know in order to justify our decisions\nmay seem to be illegitimately circular. The need for justification is\nmore pressing in the moral case; hence, the methodology of justifying\nour moral beliefs by allowing ourselves to believe about moral matters\nwhat we have been raised to believe is more questionable (Campbell and\nHunter 2000).\n\n\nThe defender of naturalized moral epistemology can reply that\nhowever urgent justification may be, no alternative exists to relying\non background assumptions when we try to justify specific claims. At\ntimes the justification of non-moral knowledge claims can be similarly\nurgent, as in deciding political, economic, or environmental policy.\nWhat is in doubt need not be the moral importance of, for example,\npreventing certain harms, but rather the means to achieve this end. In\nthese cases we will seek statistical and other evidence to support our\nbeliefs, but there exists now a firm consensus among philosophers of\nscience that the justification provided by evidence for a hypothesis\nwill depend for its credibility on theoretical background assumptions.\nThese in turn may require defense, but in general there is no way to\nproceed but to assume something that we think we know until we have\nsufficient reason to reject the assumption. In this respect, the\ndefender of naturalized epistemology can say that moral knowledge and\nnon-moral knowledge are on a par. This response is of a piece with the\nreply to the last challenge in that it appeals to the holistic nature\nof justification. Unless this appeal is blocked somehow, moral\nknowledge remains a viable possibility when moral epistemology is\nnaturalized.\n",
