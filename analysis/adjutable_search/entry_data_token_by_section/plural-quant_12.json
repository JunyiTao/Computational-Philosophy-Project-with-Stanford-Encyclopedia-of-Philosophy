    "main_text": "Applications of Plural Quantification || Set Theory\n4.3 Set Theory\n\nAnother application of the Logicality Thesis is concerned with set\ntheory. One may for a variety of reasons want to talk about and\nquantify over collections of sets (Uzquiano 2003). For instance, one\nmay want to assert\n\n(13)\n There are some sets which are all and only the non-self-membered\nsets.\n\n\nIf we formalize this as \n\n\\[\n\\tag{\\(13'\\)}\n\\Exists{R} \\Forall{x} (Rx \\leftrightarrow x\\not\\in x),\n\\]\n\n\nhow is the quantifier \\(\\exists{R}\\) to be understood? It clearly\ncannot be taken to range over all sets, as this would lead straight to\nRussell\u2019s paradox: (13\u2032) would then assert the existence\nof the Russell-set. Three other responses are prominent in the\nliterature.\n\nThe first response is that \\(\\exists{R}\\) ranges over classes\nbut that some classes are too large (or otherwise unsuited) to be\nsets. In particular,\n (13)\n asserts the existence of the Russell-class, which isn\u2019t a set.\nThis response has been found problematic because it postulates the\nexistence of different kinds of \u201cset-like\u201d entities\n(Boolos 1984: 442 [1998a: 66] and 1998b: 35). It has also been\nobjected that this response only postpones the problem posed by\n (13).\n For it would also be true that\n\n(14)\n There are some classes which are all and only the\nnon-self-membered classes.\n\n\nWhat kind of entity would this collection of classes be? A\nsuper-class? If so, we will be forced to postulate higher and higher\nlevels of classes. Lewis (1991: 68) argues that Russell\u2019s\nparadox is still inescapable because, when we consider all set-like\nentities, we realize that the following is true:\n\n(15)\n There are some set-like things which are all and only the\nnon-self-membered set-like things.\n\n\nHowever, Hazen (1993: 141\u20132) has pointed out that Lewis\u2019s\nobjection violates essential type-restrictions. Classes of different\nlevels belong to different logical types, just as concepts of\ndifferent levels do. So Lewis\u2019s attempt to talk about all\nset-like entities in one fell swoop involves an attempt to quantify\nacross different logical types. But this violates type restrictions in\nthe same way as an attempt to quantify simultaneously over objects and\nconcepts of all different levels. Although we can quantify over\neach level of classes, we can never quantify over all\nlevels simultaneously.\n\nThe second response is that\n (13)\n asserts the existence of a set \\(R\\), but that \\(R\\) isn\u2019t in\nthe range of the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\). This prevents us from\ninstantiating the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\) with respect to \\(R\\),\nwhich means that we cannot draw the fatal conclusion that \\(R\\) is a\nmember of itself just in case it isn\u2019t. However, this response\nentails that the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\) cannot be chosen to range\nover absolutely all sets; for if it could be so chosen, we would not\nbe able deny that \\(R\\) is in this range of quantification. This means\nthat the universe of sets has a certain inexhaustibility:\nwhenever we have formed a conception of quantification over some range\nof sets, we can define a set which isn\u2019t in this range (Dummett\n1981: ch. 15 and 1991: ch. 24; Glanzberg 2004; Parsons 1977). However,\nthis response has been criticized for being, at best hard to state,\nand at worst self-refuting (Boolos 1998b: 30; Lewis 1991: 68;\nWilliamson 2003: sect. V). (See also Rayo and Uzquiano 2006 for a\nnumber of essays discussing whether absolutely general quantification\nis possible.)\n\nBecause of the difficulties involved in the first two responses, a\nthird response has become popular in recent years (Boolos 1984 and\n1985a; Burgess 2004; Cartwright 2001; Rayo and Uzquiano 1999; Uzquiano\n2003). This is that the quantifier \\(\\exists{R}\\) is a plural\nquantifier (and would thus be better written as \\(\\exists{rr})\\) and\nthat plural quantification is ontologically innocent. Therefore\n (13)\n does not assert the existence of any \u201cset-like\u201d entity\nover and above the sets in the range of the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\).\nBut as we will see in\n Section 5,\n the claim about ontological innocence is controversial.\n\nA entirely different application of plural logic to set theory seeks\nto use plurals to explain sets. Kurt G\u00f6del famously wrote of the\noperation \u201cset of\u201d, which can be applied to any\n\u201cwell-defined objects\u201d to form their set and whose\niterated application yields the cumulative hierarchy of sets (1964:\n180). A key question is how to understand the notion of some\n\u201cwell-defined objects\u201d. Suppose we accept that any objects\n\\(xx\\) qualify as such. Then any objects \\(xx\\) give rise to a set\n\\(\\{xx\\}\\). Since the cumulative hierarchy contains no universal set,\nit follows that there cannot be a universal plurality comprising\nabsolutely all objects. Florio and Linnebo 2020 and 2021, ch. 12\ndevelop a critical plural logic that is suited for being\ncombined with such an unrestricted \u201cset of\u201d operation.\nThus, this approach forsakes the power of this logic to talk about\narbitrary collections of sets and instead uses plurals to account for\nthe nature of, and our knowledge of, sets. \n",
