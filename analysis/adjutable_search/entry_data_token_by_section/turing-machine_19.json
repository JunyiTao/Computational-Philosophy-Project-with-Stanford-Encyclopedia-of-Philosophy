    "main_text": "Impact of Turing Machines on Computer Science || Turing Machines and the Modern Computer\n5.2 Turing Machines and the Modern Computer\n\nIn several accounts, Turing has been identified not just as the father\nof computer science but as the father of the modern computer. The\nclassical story for this more or less goes as follows: the blueprint\nof the modern computer can be found in von Neumann\u2019s EDVAC\ndesign and today classical computers are usually described as having a\nso-called von Neumann architecture. One fundamental idea of the EDVAC\ndesign is the so-called stored-program idea. Roughly speaking this\nmeans the storage of instructions and data in the same memory allowing\nthe manipulation of programs as data. There are good reasons for\nassuming that von Neumann knew the main results of Turing\u2019s\npaper (Davis 1988). Thus, one could argue that the stored-program\nconcept originates in Turing\u2019s notion of the universal Turing\nmachine and, singling this out as the defining feature of the modern\ncomputer, some might claim that Turing is the father of the modern\ncomputer. Another related argument is that Turing was the first who\n\u201ccaptured\u201d the idea of a general-purpose machine through\nhis notion of the universal machine and that in this sense he also\n\u201cinvented\u201d the modern computer (Copeland & Proudfoot\n2011). This argument is then strengthened by the fact that Turing was\nalso involved with the construction of an important class of computing\ndevices (the Bombe) used for decrypting the German Enigma code and\nlater proposed the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine)\nwhich was explicitly identified as a kind of physical realization of\nthe universal machine by Turing himself:\n\n\nSome years ago I was researching on what might now be described as an\ninvestigation of the theoretical possibilities and limitations of\ndigital computing machines. [\u2026] Machines such as the ACE may be\nregarded as practical versions of this same type of machine. (Turing\n1947)\n\n\nNote however that Turing already knew the ENIAC and EDVAC designs and\nproposed the ACE as a kind of improvement on that design (amongst\nothers, it had a simpler hardware architecture).\n\nThese claims about Turing as the inventor and/or father of the\ncomputer have been scrutinized by some historians of computing\n(Daylight 2014; Haigh 2013; Haigh 2014; Mounier-Kuhn 2012), mostly in the wake of the Turing centenary and\nthis from several perspectives. Based on that research it is clear\nthat claims about Turing being the inventor of the modern computer\ngive a distorted and biased picture of the development of the modern\ncomputer. At best, he is one of the many who made a contribution to\none of the several historical developments (scientific, political,\ntechnological, social and industrial) which resulted, ultimately, in\n(our concept of) the modern computer. Indeed, the \u201cfirst\u201d\ncomputers are the result of a wide number of innovations and so are\nrooted in the work of not just one but several people with diverse\nbackgrounds and viewpoints.\n\nIn the 1950s then the (universal) Turing machine starts to become an\naccepted model in relation to actual computers and is used as a tool\nto reflect on the limits and potentials of general-purpose computers\nby both engineers, mathematicians and logicians. More particularly,\nwith respect to machine designs, it was the insight that only a few\nnumber of operations were required to built a general-purpose machine\nwhich inspired in the 1950s reflections on minimal machine\narchitectures. Frankel, who (partially) constructed the MINAC stated\nthis as follows:\n\n\nOne remarkable result of Turing\u2019s investigation is that he was\nable to describe a single computer which is able to compute\nany computable number. He called this machine a universal\ncomputer. It is thus the \u201cbest possible\u201d computer\nmentioned.\n\n[\u2026] This surprising result shows that in examining the question\nof what problems are, in principle, solvable by computing machines, we\ndo not need to consider an infinite series of computers of greater and\ngreater complexity but may think only of a single machine. \n\nEven more surprising than the theoretical possibility of such a\n\u201cbest possible\u201d computer is the fact that it need not be\nvery complex. The description given by Turing of a universal computer\nis not unique. Many computers, some of quite modest complexity,\nsatisfy the requirements for a universal computer. (Frankel 1956:\n635)\n\n\nThe result was a series of experimental machines such as the MINAC,\nTX-0 (Lincoln Lab) or the ZERO machine (van der Poel) which in their\nturn became predecessors of a number of commercial machines. It is\nworth pointing out that also Turing\u2019s ACE machine design fits\ninto this philosophy. It was also commercialized as the BENDIX G15\nmachine (De Mol, Bullynck, & Daylight 2018).\n\nOf course, by minimizing the machine instructions, coding or\nprogramming became a much more complicated task. To put it in\nTuring\u2019s words who clearly realized this trade-off between code\nand (hard-wired) instructions when designing the ACE: \u201c[W]e have\noften simplified the circuit at the expense of the code\u201d (Turing\n1947).\nAnd indeed, one sees that with these early minimal designs, much\neffort goes into developing more efficient coding strategies. It is\nhere that one can also situate one historical root of making the\nconnection between the universal Turing machine and the important\nprinciple of the interchangeability between hardware and programs.\n\nToday, the universal Turing machine is by many still considered as the\nmain theoretical model of the modern computer especially in relation\nto the so-called von Neumann architecture. Of course, other models\nhave been introduced for other architectures such as the Bulk\nsynchronous parallel model for parallel machines or the persistent\nTuring machine for modeling interactive problems.\n",
