    "main_text": "Types of Arguments || Abduction\n2.3 Abduction\n\nAn abductive argument is one where, from the observation of a few\nrelevant facts, a conclusion is drawn as to what could possibly\nexplain the occurrence of these facts (see entry on\n abduction).\n Abduction is widely thought to be ubiquitous both in science and in\neveryday life, as well as in other specific domains such as the law,\nmedical diagnosis, and explainable artificial intelligence (Josephson\n& Josephson 1994). Indeed, a good example of abduction is the\nclosing argument by a prosecutor in a court of law who, after\nsummarizing the available evidence, concludes that the most plausible\nexplanation for it is that the defendant must have committed the crime\nthey are accused of.\n\nLike induction, and unlike deduction, abduction is not necessarily\ntruth-preserving: in the example above, it is still possible that the\ndefendant is not guilty after all, and that some other, unexpected\nphenomena caused the evidence to emerge. But abduction is\nsignificantly different from induction in that it does not only\nconcern the generalization of prior observation for prediction (though\nit may also involve statistical data): rather, abduction is often\nbackward-looking in that it seeks to explain something that has\nalready happened. The key notion is that of bringing together\napparently independent phenomena or events as explanatorily and/or\ncausally connected to each other, something that is absent from a\npurely inductive argument that only appeals to observed frequencies.\nCognitively, abduction taps into the well-known human tendency to seek\n(causal) explanations for phenomena (Keil 2006).\n\nAs noted, deduction and induction have been recognized as important\nclasses of arguments for millennia; the concept of abduction is by\ncomparison a latecomer. It is important to notice though that\nexplanatory arguments as such are not latecomers; indeed,\nAristotle\u2019s very conception of scientific demonstration is based\non the concept of explaining causes (see entry on\n Aristotle).\n What is recent is the conceptualization of abduction as a special\nclass of arguments, and the term itself. The term was introduced by\nPeirce as a third class of inferences distinct from deduction and\ninduction: for Peirce, abduction is understood as the process of\nforming explanatory hypotheses, thus leading to new ideas and concepts\n(whereas for him deduction and induction could not lead to new ideas\nor theories; see the entry on\n Peirce). Thus seen,\nabduction pertains to contexts of discovery, in which case it\nis not clear that it corresponds to instances of arguments, properly\nspeaking. In its modern meaning, however, abduction pertains to\ncontexts of justification, and thus to speak of abductive\narguments becomes appropriate. An abductive argument is now typically\nunderstood as an inference to the best explanation (Lipton\n1971 [2003]), although some authors contend that there are good\nreasons to distinguish the two concepts (Campos 2011).\n\nWhile the main ideas behind abduction may seem simple enough, cashing\nout more precisely how exactly abduction works is a complex matter\n(see entry on\n abduction).\n Moreover, it is not clear that abductive arguments are always or even\ngenerally reliable and cogent. Humans seem to have a tendency to\novershoot in their quest for causal explanations, and often look for\nsimplicity where there is none to be found (Lombrozo 2007; but see\nSober 2015 on the significance of parsimony in scientific reasoning).\nThere are also a number of philosophical worries pertaining to the\njustification of abduction, especially in scientific contexts; one\ninfluential critique of abduction/inference to the best explanation is\nthe one articulated by van Fraassen (Fraassen 1989). A frequent\nconcern pertains to the connection between explanatory superiority and\ntruth: are we entitled to conclude that the conclusion of an abductive\nargument is true solely on the basis of it being a good (or even the\nbest) explanation for the phenomena in question? It seems that no\namount of philosophical a priori theorizing will provide justification\nfor the leap from explanatory superiority to truth. Instead, defenders\nof abduction tend to offer empirical arguments showing that abduction\ntends to be a reliable rule of inference. In this sense, abduction and\ninduction are comparable: they are widely used, grounded in very basic\nhuman cognitive tendencies, but they give rise to a number of\ndifficult philosophical problems.\n",
