    "main_text": "Event Metaphysics and Semantics || Identity\n3.2 Identity\n\nAnother issue that appears to be undecided concerns so-called identity\ncriteria for events, which has been the focus of an intense debate\n(Bradie 1983; Pfeifer 1989; Mackie 1997). Is Anita\u2019s walk the\nsame event as her pleasant walk? Was Brutus\u2019s stabbing of Caesar\nthe same event as his killing of Caesar? Was it the same as his\nkilling of the last Roman dictator? Was it the same as the one and\nonly assassination that took place in the Roman Senate on the Ides of\nMarch, 44 BCE? (Or again, with reference to the conceptual distinction\nbetween actions and bodily movements: is someone\u2019s raising of\ntheir arm the same event as the rising of their arm?)\n\nSome philosophers take these to be metaphysical\nquestions\u2014questions whose answers call for adequate identity\ncriteria, which must be provided before we are allowed to take our\nevent talk seriously (cf. Quine 1958: \u201cNo entity without\nidentity\u201d). In this sense, different conceptions of events tend\nto suggest different answers, and widely varying ones. In the\ninfluential terminology of Thalberg (1971), we find at one extreme the\nradical \u201cunifiers\u201d, who take events to be as\ncoarse-grained as ordinary objects (Lemmon 1967; Quine 1985), while\nthe other extreme corresponds to the radical\n\u201cmultipliers\u201d, who take events to be as fine-grained as\nfacts (Kim 1966; Goldman 1971; Chisholm 1971). In between we find\nseveral moderate variants. Davidson (1969), for example, relies on a\ncriterion of causal extensionality: x and y are the\nsame event if and only if they have the same causes and the same\neffects. This allows him to identify the killing of Caesar with his\nstabbing while distinguishing between, say, the rotation and the\nheating up of a metal ball that is simultaneously rotating and heating\nup. (Strictly speaking, this criterion is formally circular, or\nimpredicative, if causes and effects are themselves treated as\nevents\u2014as noted by Sher 1974, Wilson 1974, and others, including\nQuine 1985\u2014and Davidson 1985 eventually rejected it.) Other\n\u201cmoderate\u201d identity criteria deliver slightly different\nverdicts, relying e.g. on mereological, locational, modal, or\nhierarchical considerations, inter alia (Davis 1970; Thalberg\n1971; Thomson 1971; Beardsley 1975; Brand 1977; Cleland 1991; Savellos\n1992; Engel 1994; Unwin 1996; Jones 2013).\n\nThere are, however, philosophers who take questions of identity to be\nmainly semantic questions\u2014not metaphysical questions but\nquestions about the referents of our event-referring expressions. No\nmetaphysical theory, it is said, can settle the semantics of ordinary\nevent talk, hence there is no way of determining the truth or falsity\nof an event identity statement exclusively on the basis of one\u2019s\nmetaphysical views. Which events a statement speaks of depends heavily\n(more heavily than with ordinary material objects) on local context\nand unprincipled intuitions (Bennett 1988). If so, then the whole\nidentity issue is undecidable, since one is demanding metaphysical\nanswers to questions that are in large part semantical.\n",
