    "preamble": "\n\nSomeone displays instrumental rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends. Instrumental rationality, by virtually any\nreckoning, is an important, and presumably indispensable, part of\npractical rationality. However, philosophers have been interested in\nit for further reasons. To take one example, it has been suggested\nthat instrumental rationality, or some tendency toward it, is partly\nconstitutive of intention, desire, or action. To take another, more\nimportant, example, it has been argued that instrumental rationality\nis not only a part, but a special part, or even the whole, of\npractical rationality. This thesis appears to threaten the\n\u201crational authority\u201d of morality. It seems possible that\nacting morally on some occasion might not be a suitable means to an\nagent\u2019s ends. If so, then according to this thesis, it would not\nbe irrational for her to refuse to act morally on such an\noccasion.\n\nWe should note two restrictions on the scope of this article. First,\nthis article focuses on contemporary discussions of the subject, apart\nfrom some brief discussions of Hume and Kant. Notable omissions, for\nexample, are Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the practical syllogism\nand his claim that deliberation is of means (Nicomachean\nEthics, Book III, Chapter 3).\n\nSecond, this article doesn\u2019t focus on decision theory, which\nsome may view as containing, or just being, a theory of instrumental\nrationality: what means to take to achieve certain ends (the\nsatisfaction of preferences, or the realization of valuable states of\naffairs) given credences, or beliefs, or information, about the\nprobabilities that various means will achieve those ends. In this\narticle, we begin\n (\u00a71)\n by noting a distinction that frames the discussion that follows: very\nroughly, a distinction between the question of whether some attitude\nis such that an agent ought, or (more weakly) has reason, to have it,\nand the question of whether that attitude rationally coheres with her\nother attitudes. We first\n (\u00a72)\n discuss the importance of means-end relations for what one ought, or\nhas reason, to intend: specifically, for how reasons for ends\n\u201ctransmit\u201d to reasons for means. We then\n (\u00a73)\n discuss instrumental rationality understood as a norm of rational\ncoherence. Lastly, we consider\n (\u00a74)\n the \u201cHumean\u201d thesis that instrumental rationality is the\nonly kind of practical rationality.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Rational Coherence and Reason\n\nSomeone displays instrumentally rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends. But how should \u201crationality\u201d\nbe understood? Here it is important to distinguish between two things\nthat the casually phrased question, \u201cWhat would it be rational\nfor an agent to do or intend?\u201d could mean:\n\nBy doing or intending what would the agent make her responses\n(i.e., her attitudes and actions) cohere with one another?\nCall the answer, stipulatively, what it would be rationally\ncoherent for the agent to do or intend.\nWhat does the agent have reason, or ought she, to do or intend?\nThis is the question that an agent characteristically asks when she is\ndeliberating about what to do or intend, or when someone else is\nadvising her what to do or intend. (Note that claims about reasons are\nweaker than claims about \u201coughts\u201d. One could have a reason\nto do something without it being the case that one ought to do it, as\nwhen the reason is outweighed by competing reasons. However, it is\ngenerally thought that if one ought to do something, then one has a\nreason to do it.)\n\n\nAs with any philosophical distinction, this contrast between\n\u201crational coherence\u201d and \u201creason\u201d might be\nquestioned. But it is accepted by many of the authors who have written\non the subject, and it will help to organize the discussion of the\nsubject matter.\n\nIn principle, the answers to these questions might perfectly coincide:\nthat what agents have reason, or ought, to do just is what it would be\nrationally coherent for them to do, and vice versa. In several ways,\nhowever, the answers might be expected to diverge.\n\nFirst, even if what one ought to do is just to make one\u2019s\nresponses globally coherent, what it takes to make\none\u2019s responses locally coherent might differ from what\nit takes to make them globally coherent. According to the Subjective\nDesire-Based Theory, for example, what agents have reason, or ought,\nto do or intend is just what, given what they believe their\ncircumstances to be, would best satisfy their strongest, present\nintrinsic desires taken as a whole. Suppose that the agent\u2019s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desire is for health. Nevertheless, out\nof habit, he intends to have a smoke, believing that lighting up is a\nnecessary means. According to the Subjective Desire-Based Theory, it\nis not the case that he ought to intend to light up. And it might be\nsaid that if he were globally coherent, the agent would not intend to\nlight up. But if he does form an intention to light up, he at least\nachieves a kind of local coherence.\n\nSecond, what the agent has reason, or ought, to do or intend may\ndepend not on what she believes her circumstances to be, but\non something more \u201cobjective.\u201d There are several\npossibilities. What an agent has reason, or ought, to do, might be\nwhat the evidence (where this depends on something other than her\nattitudes) available to the agent suggests about her circumstances,\nwhat the evidence of the person making the reason- or ought-claim\nsuggests about the agent\u2019s circumstances, what the evidence of\nthe person assessing the claim suggests about the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances, or all of the relevant facts about the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances. Consider the Objective Desire-Based Theory, which says\nthat agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend just what, given\nwhat their circumstances actually are, would best satisfy their\nstrongest, present intrinsic desires taken as a whole. Suppose the\nagent\u2019s strongest, present intrinsic desire is to drink a gin\nand tonic, and she so intends. However, she mistakenly believes that\nthe stuff in this bottle is gin, when it is in fact petrol. So she\nbelieves that mixing the stuff with tonic is a means to drinking a gin\nand tonic. According to the Objective Desire-Based Theory, she does\nnot have reason to intend to mix the stuff with tonic and drink it.\nBut if she does so intend, she might be said to have achieved a kind\nof rational coherence, both local and global.\n\nThird, one might hold not a Desire-Based Theory, but a Value-Based\nTheory, according to which whatever ultimate ends an agent\nhas reason, or ought, to achieve depend not on what she\ndesires or wills, but instead on what is of\nindependent value. Suppose the madman\u2019s strongest, present\nintrinsic desire is to set off a nuclear war, and he so intends.\nMoreover, the madman knows that intending to press this button is a\nnecessary and sufficient means to setting off a nuclear war. It might\nbe said that, in intending to press this button, the madman would\nachieve a kind of coherence, both local and global. And according to\nthe Desire-Based Theories, the madman ought so to intend. According to\na Value-Based Theory, however, it presumably is not the case that he\nought so to intend.\n\nThere are several reasons, therefore, to expect at least some\ndivergence between what one has reason, or ought, to do or intend, and\nwhat it would be rationally coherent for one to do or intend. But that\nis perfectly compatible with partial convergence, even of a\nnon-accidental character. As we will discuss below, some suggest that\namong the things that agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend is\nprecisely to make their responses rationally coherent. Just as we\nought not to torture, or ought to care for our children, we ought to\nbe rationally coherent.\n2. Instrumental Transmission\n\nWe\u2019ll begin by discussing how means-end relations matter for\nwhat one ought, or has reason, to do or intend. (For an opinionated\nsurvey, see Kolodny 2018.) But we should first consider how\n\u201cmeans\u201d is understood. While \u201cmeans\u201d are often\ntaken to be tools or resources, for our purposes, we will view means\nas actions, intentions, choices, decisions, etc. that might make use\nof such tools or resources. It is natural to think of means to an end,\nso understood, as actions that help to cause the end to\noccur. But often philosophers count as means to an end whatever may\nhelp to bring it about. M may bring about E by\ncausing it, as flicking this switch causes the illumination of this\nroom, but M may also bring about E by helping to\nconstitute it, as playing this measure partially constitutes the\nplaying of this sonata, or fulfilling preconditions for it, as\nregistering for this conference fulfills preconditions for attending\nit, or preventing things that might prevent it, as vaccination\nprevents disease that might prevent successful completion of the\nschool year. Means are also often probabilistic. Something may also\ncount as a means to an end even if it is not guaranteed to help to\nbring about the end, but only has some chance of doing so. Usage of\n\u201cend\u201d is also often ambiguous. Sometimes \u201cend\u201d\nis used to refer to an action, such as the action of\nilluminating this room. But sometimes \u201cend\u201d is used to\nrefer to a state of affairs that is either desired or\nvaluable, such as the state of affairs of this room\u2019s being\nilluminated. We\u2019ll here use \u201cend\u201d to refer to an\naction.\n\nReasons for action are often said to \u201ctransmit\u201d from ends\nto means, in the sense that if there is reason for an end, then,\nbecause of this, there is reason for the means. This idea is captured\nin Joseph Raz\u2019s Facilitative Principle:\n\n\n[w]hen we have an undefeated reason to take an action, we have reason\nto perform any one (but only one) of the possible (for us) alternative\nplans that facilitate its performance. (Raz 2005b)\n\n\nInsofar as what one ought to do depends on what one has reason to do,\none might expect a similar transmission of \u201cought\u201d from\nend to means. If one ought to achieve an end, then one ought to take\nthe means, or at least means of certain kinds.\n\nPrinciples of instrumental transmission of this kind are compatible\nwith different views about what ends we have reason to achieve. For\nexample, it may be accepted by either a Desire-Based, or a\nValue-Based, Theory.\n\nWhat the correct principle, or principles, of instrumental\ntransmission are is controversial. Most commonly, principles describe\ntransmission to necessary means. However, some speak of sufficient\nmeans, and others speak of neither. For example, Raz\u2019s\nFacilitative Principle speaks of \u201cfacilitating plans.\u201d\nSome transmission principles say that \u201coughts\u201d transmit\nfrom end to means, others say that the full force of the reason for\nthe end transmits to the means, others say that the strength of the\nreason for the end that transmits to the means is proportional to\nother factors, and others, like Raz\u2019s Facilitative Principle,\nsay only that some reason for the end transmits to the means.\n\nTo illustrate the problems facing an account of instrumental\ntransmission, it may be useful to work with some very simple\nprinciples, which lack many of the qualifications and nuances of\nRaz\u2019s Facilitative Principle and other principles discussed in\nthe literature:\n\nOught Necessity:\nIf one ought to E, and M is a necessary means to\nE-ing, then one ought to M.\nStrong Reasons Necessity:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a necessary\nmeans to E-ing, then that is as strong a reason to\nM.\nWeak Reasons Necessity:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a necessary\nmeans to E-ing, then that is some reason to M.\nOught Sufficiency:\nIf one ought to E, and M is a sufficient means\nto E-ing, then one ought to M.\nStrong Reasons Sufficiency:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a sufficient\nmeans to E-ing, then that is as strong a reason to\nM.\nWeak Reasons Sufficiency:\nIf one has reason to E, and M is a sufficient\nmeans to E-ing, then that is some reason to M.\n\n\nThere are several problems that principles of instrumental\ntransmission need to avoid. First, means to an end can be\ncostly, or otherwise objectionable. Suppose that I ought to\ntake a job in Alaska. One (sufficient) means is to fly there; another\n(sufficient) means is to take free passage on a merchant ship. But\nflying costs more than I would earn there. Presumably, I ought not\nfly. It may be said that I have some reason to fly, but that it is\noutweighed. This is an argument against Ought Sufficiency.\n\nHowever, with other kinds of costs, or objectionable features, it may\nsound wrong to say even that one has reason for the means. Suppose I\nhave reason to alleviate pangs of hunger. One sufficient means to this\nis eating a sandwich; another sufficient means is killing myself\n(Broome 2005b). Some will resist the conclusion that I have any reason\nat all to kill myself. This is an argument against Strong Reasons\nSufficiency and Weak Reasons Sufficiency. Or suppose I have reason to\nimprove college policy. But a necessary means to this is to kill the\nold don who resists any change (because unanimous approval is\nrequired). Some will resist the conclusion that I have any reason at\nall to kill the don. This is an argument against Strong Reasons\nNecessity and Weak Reasons Necessity. However, it may not be an\nargument against Ought Necessity. It may be said that the fact that\nimproving policy requires killing the don is itself a strong reason\nagainst improving policy, in light of which it is not true that one\nought to improve it. In that case, Ought Necessity does not imply that\none ought to kill the don, which seems intuitive. In any event, the\nforce of the intuition on which the argument rests may be resisted.\nGranted, it sounds odd to say that one has reason to kill oneself. But\nthis may have a pragmatic explanation. Why bother to identify any\nreason to kill oneself when it is vastly outweighed by the reasons\nagainst doing so? (Raz 2005a; Schroeder 2005a, 2007; for objection to\nthe pragmatic explanation, see Gertken and Kiesewetter 2021.)\n\nSecond, problems arise from repeated applications of\ntransmission principles. For one thing, means to means to an\nend may actually undermine the end. Suppose, to take an example of\nRyan Millsap\u2019s, Kenny has reason to bake both a loaf of bread\nand a cake for a display on Marie Antoinette. A (necessary) means to\nthat end is baking a loaf of bread. Plausibly, he has reason to bake a\nloaf of bread. A (sufficient) means to that means is baking a\ngiant loaf, which uses all of the flour. But that would prevent him\nfrom baking a cake, and so prevent him from achieving the end. So,\npresumably, he does not have reason to bake a giant loaf, even though\nit is a means to something that he has reason to do. For another\nthing, if we accept both Weak Reasons Necessity and Weak Reasons\nSufficiency, then repeated applications of these principles may imply\nthat if there is reason for something, then there is reason for\neverything. To take another example from Ryan Millsap, suppose there\nis reason to E, and let F be\nanything. If E-ing or F-ing is a necessary means\nto E-ing, and if F-ing is a sufficient means\nto E-ing or F-ing, then, repeated application of\nthose principles implies that there is reason to F. Note that\nsimilar problems arise if we accept both Ought Necessity and Ought\nSufficiency.\n\nThird, a means to an end might have a very low probability of\nhelping to bring that end about. Suppose, to take an example from\nJackson and Pargetter 1986, Professor Procrastinate has been asked to\nreview a book, which he both ought, and has reason, to do. A\n(necessary) means to reviewing it is accepting the commission to\nreview it. However, even if he accepts the commission, he is very\nunlikely to review it. Professor Dispatch, in a parallel universe, is\nin the same situation, except that he is very likely to review it if\nhe accepts. Perhaps Procrastinate, like Dispatch, has some reason to\nreview it. But Procrastinate may not have as much reason as Dispatch\nto accept; not all of the reason for the end may be transmitted to\nthis (necessary) means. And it may not be the case that Procrastinate\nought to accept. This is an argument against Strong Reasons Necessity\nand Ought Necessity, since even if one takes a necessary means, there\nmay still be a low probability of helping to bring that end about.\nHowever, it is not an argument against the Sufficiency principles,\nassuming that sufficient means, if taken, are sure to help to bring\nthe end about.\n\nIn response to this problem, one might argue that Procrastinate both\nought to write the review and ought to accept the invitation. After\nall, if we follow Jackson and Pargetter in thinking that Procrastinate\nboth ought to [write the review and accept the invitation]\nand ought to decline the invitiation, then it would no longer\nbe possible for Procrastinate to do everything that he ought to do. As\nBenjamin Kiesewetter (2015) argues, we would then have to reject\n\nJoint Satisfiability:\nIf A ought to x and A ought to\ny, then it is possible for A to [x and\ny].\n\n\nwhich might prove costly. It may be that such counterexamples to Ought\nNecessity (and Strong Reasons Necessity) rely on such costly views.\n(For further discussion, see Kiesewetter 2015, White 2017, and\nKiesewetter 2018.)\n\nThe fourth and final problem is that a sufficient means may be\nsuperfluous to an end, where this means that the end would\nstill be achieved, even if those means were omitted. Suppose that Drug\n1 is a sufficient means to relieving the patient\u2019s pain. A\ndoctor is sure to give Drug 1. Giving Drug 2, in addition, would at\nfirst neutralize the effect of Drug 1, but then recombine with it to\nproduce a third drug, which will relieve the patient\u2019s pain.\nGiving Drug 2 would be superfluous to relieving the patient\u2019s\npain, although it would help to bring it about, by being part of the\ncause of the relief of the patient\u2019s pain. Does the doctor then\nalso have any reason to give Drug 2? At first, one might be tempted to\nsay that the doctor does indeed have reason to give Drug 2, but that\nthis reason is outweighed by the cost of giving Drug 2. But observe\nthat no matter how low we make that cost, it still outweighs any\nreason to give it. This suggests that there is no reason at all to\ngive it. Note that necessary means cannot be superfluous, since if\nnecessary means were left out, the end would not be achieved.\n3. Instrumental Coherence\n\nNow we consider instrumental rationality understood as a matter of\nrational coherence. It is often said that someone is being locally\ninstrumentally incoherent insofar as he intends an end, believes,\nroughly, that something is a means to it, but refuses to intend that\nmeans. More precisely, it seems that this is so only when the relevant\nbelief is about necessary means. Suppose that I intend to go\nto Alaska, but believe that flying there is a sufficient, but not\nnecessary, means to going to Alaska. Am I being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend to fly there? Not obviously: perhaps\nI believe that going by sea is cheaper, and I intend that.\n\nSome suggest that this focus, on intentions and beliefs about\nnecessary means, inspired by Kant\u2019s initial discussion of\nhypothetical imperatives (see\n \u00a74.4\n below), is overly narrow (see Smith 2004 and Wedgwood 2011). Not\nsimply intentions, but also desires, should be considered, and not\nsimply beliefs about necessary means, but also beliefs about\nnon-necessary means should be considered. And others have developed\ntheories of instrumental rationality focused on (intentional) actions,\nas opposed to intentions (see Tenenbaum 2021).\n\nMore precisely still, the relevant belief must be that\nintending the means is itself necessary. Suppose your dentist\nintends to remove your tooth, and believes that a necessary means to\nremoving your tooth is causing you pain. Is she being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend to cause you pain? Not necessarily:\nshe might believe that she will remove your tooth even if she does not\nintend to cause you pain. But she will, presumably, believe that she\nwill remove your tooth only if she intends to use her\ninstruments. So, though she wouldn\u2019t be irrational in not\nintending to cause you pain, she would be irrational in not intending\nto use her instruments (Kamm 2000, 2007; Searle, 2001; Broome\n2003).\n\nMoreover, the relevant belief must be that intending the means\nnow is necessary. Suppose a beginning student intends to earn\na doctoral degree and believes that, when the dissertation is\ncompleted, intending to submit the final paperwork is necessary for\nearning the degree. It is not clear that she is being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend, now, to submit that paperwork. She\nmay trust that, when the time comes, she will intend it (Setiya 2007).\nThis suggests, as Raz notes, that opportunities for instrumental\nincoherence may actually be very rare.\n\nEven with the content of the relevant belief being restricted in these\nways, worries might still arise given that (all-out) belief falls\nshort of certainty. Suppose I believe the only way to arrive on time\nis to steal my neighbor\u2019s car, which I\u2019m unwilling to. But\nI also think there\u2019s a very small chance I could bike in and\narrive on time. (This is compatible with my all-out believing\nI\u2019ll arrive on time only if I steal my neighbor\u2019s car.)\nOne might argue that it\u2019s rationally permissible to intend to\narrive on time in such a case (Nu\u00f1ez 2020). However, perhaps we\nshould instead say here that it\u2019s rationally permissible to have\nthe goal, or aim, of arriving on time, not the\nintention to arrive on time.\n\nThere seems to be considerable agreement, then, on what we might call\nthe:\n\nViolation Claim:\nIf one is instrumentally incoherent\u2014i.e., one intends at\nt to E, believes at t that one will\nE only if one intends at t to M, but does\nnot (or, more restrictively, refuses to) intend at t to\nM\u2014then one violates some requirement.\n\n\nBut it is unclear exactly what requirement one violates. Additionally,\nit is unclear whether the requirement violated would be\n\u201cnormative\u201d in the sense that one ought not to violate it.\nIn other words, it is unclear whether, in being instrumentally\nincoherent, one violates a requirement of reason, in the\nsense of \u201creason\u201d identified earlier. In the remainder of\nthis section, we\u2019ll consider some possible answers to these\nquestions.\n\nFirst,\n (\u00a73.1)\n we might say that there isn\u2019t any requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such, but whenever one is\ninstrumentally incoherent, one violates some independent\nrequirement of reason. Second,\n (\u00a73.2)\n we might say that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. Third,\n (\u00a73.3)\n we might deny that one necessarily violates a requirement of reason\nin being instrumentally incoherent; perhaps the normativity of\ninstrumental coherence is merely apparent, or the requirement merely\nevaluative (it may be a standard of proper functioning without giving\nanyone reason to comply with it). Fourth,\n (\u00a73.4)\n one might think, given the ways in which intention is thought to\ninvolve belief, that in being instrumentally incoherent, one violates\na requirement of theoretical rationality.\n\nThere are, of course, other answers that could be given. (For\ninstance, we briefly discuss a constitutivist approach to instrumental\nincoherence, attributed to Kant, in\n \u00a74.4)\n But consideration of these approaches will give a reasonably\ncomprehensive picture of the recent attempts to explain the Violation\nClaim.\n3.1 Independent Requirements of Reason\n\nOne answer is that when one is instrumentally incoherent one violates\nsome independent requirement of reason. That is, either one\nhas some specific attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nthat one ought not to have or one lacks some\nspecific attitude (or pattern of attitudes) that one ought to have.\nThe source of the problem, according to this answer, is not\nthat when one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates some\nrequirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.\nThe source of the problem is instead that when one is instrumentally\nincoherent, then it is guaranteed that one\u2019s having (or lacking)\none attitude (or pattern of attitudes) violates some\nindependent requirement of reason. (See Kolodny 2007b, 2008a;\nKiesewetter 2017, esp. Ch. 10; Lord 2018, esp. Ch. 2. For criticism,\nsee Brunero 2020, Ch. 4; Fogal and Worsnip 2021; Worsnip 2021, Ch. 3,\nLee 2021.)\n\nCertainly, this can happen in some cases, at least accidentally.\nSuppose our madman intends to start World War III, believes that he\nwill start World War III only if he intends to launch a nuclear\nmissile, but refuses to intend to launch a nuclear missile. The\nViolation Claim might be explained in this case by pointing out that,\nwhatever his other attitudes may be, he ought not to have the\nintention to start World War III, but does have that intention. But\nwhy should we suppose that, in general, whenever one has an\ninstrumentally incoherent set, one either has an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought not to have, or lacks an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought to have?\n\nThis would be so, in general, if the following were the case:\n\nOught Pattern 1:\nIn any situation, either\n\n\none ought not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends to M, or\none ought not to intend to E, or\none ought to intend to M.\n \n\n\nIt would also be so, in general, if the following were the case:\n\nOught Pattern 2:\nIn any situation, either\n\n\none ought not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends to M, or\nwhatever pattern of intention one ought to have, it is not one\nintends to E and does not intend to M; i.e.,\neither\n\n\none ought not to intend to E and not to intend to\nM, or\none ought not to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and not to intend\nto M or not to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and not to intend\nto M or to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and to intend to\nM or to intend to E and to intend to\nM, or\none ought either not to intend to E and to not to\nintend to M or not to intend to E and to\nintend to M or to intend to E and to intend\nto M.\n \n \n\n\nOught Pattern 2 speaks of \u201coughts\u201d for patterns of\nintention, rather than for single intentions. The reason for this is\nthat one\u2019s having an intention to X can affect\none\u2019s reason for having an intention to Y. This can\nhappen in the following way. First, one\u2019s reason to intend to\nY plausibly depends, among other things, on how likely one is\nto succeed in it. Second, how likely one is to succeed in it in turn\ndepends on how the future is likely to be. I am more likely to succeed\nin drying the laundry if there is no rain. Third, how the future is\nlikely to be can depend on how some person is likely to act. I am more\nlikely to succeed in drying the laundry if the children are unlikely\nto be playing with the hose at the same time. Fourth, the relevant\nperson may be the agent himself. I am more likely to succeed in drying\nthe laundry if I am unlikely to be at the same time watering the\ngarden. Finally, the fact that an agent intends to X can make\nit more likely that the agent will X in the future. The fact\nthat I intend to water the garden can make it more likely that I will\nbe watering the garden. Thus, the fact that an agent intends to\nX can make it more likely that the agent will not succeed in\nan intention to Y, and so that the agent has less reason to\nintend to Y. Given that one\u2019s intending to X\ncan affect one\u2019s reason to Y and vice versa, the\nquestions, \u201cWhat reason do I have to intend to Y? What\nreason do I have to intend to X?\u201d may be insufficiently\ndeterminate. Better questions may instead be \u201cWhat reason do I\nhave (to intend to X and to intend to Y)? What\nreason do I have (to intend to X and not to intend to\nY)? What reason do I have (not to intend to X and to\nintend to Y)? What reason do I have (not to intend to\nX and not to intend to Y)?\u201d\n\nThis phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the presence of one\nintention can affect one\u2019s reason to have another intention,\nshould be distinguished from the phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon,\nthat the presence of one intention and the presence or absence of\nanother can make it the case that one violates or satisfies a rational\nrequirement of instrumental coherence as such. First, what matters for\nrational requirements is what we believe about the relations\nbetween the intentions, whereas what matters for reason would seem to\nbe how they are likely to affect one another, which may be\nindependent of what we believe. Second, what matters for rational\nrequirements is intending to X as such, whereas what matters\nfor reason is what intending to X means for the future. In\nsome cases, intending to X (e.g., intending to become King of\nFrance in 2023), may not affect the likely future. In other\ncases, conditions other than intending to X (e.g., my\nself-trust that I will X even if I don\u2019t intend it now,\nor my knowledge that I will be tortured or coerced into\nX-ing) may affect the likely future in the same way.\nFinally, rational requirements are usually taken to be wide-scope, as\nwe will see below. That is, one never needs to have or lack any\nparticular attitude in order to satisfy them. By contrast, one usually\nneeds to have or lack a particular attitude in order to conform to\none\u2019s reason to have a certain pattern of intentions. If one\nought, for example, (to intend to X and not to intend to\nY), then one can comply with this requirement of reason only\nby intending to X and not intending to Y.\n\nOne might argue for Ought Pattern 1 in the following way. Suppose that\nit is not the case that one ought not to believe that one will\nE only if one intends to M. Then by:\n\nEpistemic Strictness:\nIf one believes P or is considering whether P,\nand it is not the case that one ought not to believe P, then\nit is the case that one ought to believe P.\n\n\none ought to believe it. Suppose further that it is not the case that\none ought not to intend to E. Then by:\n\nPractical Strictness:\nIf it is not the case that one ought not to intend to E,\nthen one ought to intend to E.\n\n\none ought to intend to E. Suppose further that:\n\nOught Intention:\nOne ought to intend to E only if one ought to\nE.\n\n\nThen one ought to E. Then by:\n\nVariant of Ought Necessity:\nIf one ought to E, and one ought to believe that one will\nE only if one intends to M, then one ought to intend\nto M.\n\n\none ought to intend to M. In other words, either one ought\nnot to believe that one will E only if one intends to\nM, or one ought not to intend to E, or one ought to\nintend to M.\n\nOne problem is that the objections to Ought Necessity that we saw in\n \u00a72\n seem to apply to Variant as well. Another is that Practical\nStrictness seems untenable (Way 2012a; Cheng-Guajardo 2014). It might\nbe the case neither that one ought not to intend to E, nor\nthat one ought to intend to E; intending to E might\nbe merely permitted. Suppose I ought to take a can of beans. I can\ntake the can of beans on the left, or I can take the equally good can\non the right. It is neither the case that I ought not to intend to\ntake the can on the left, nor that I ought to intend to take the can\non the left.\n\nBut perhaps in such cases one\u2019s intending to take the\ncan on the left provides a reason that tips the scales, thereby making\nit the case that one ought to intend the means to that end. (See\nSchroeder 2009, \u00a74.1; For criticism of the view that intentions\nprovide reasons in this way, see Broome 2001 and Brunero 2007.) If\nthat\u2019s true, then these cases of \u201cpicking\u201d\nwouldn\u2019t pose a special problem for Ought Pattern 1; in all such\ncases, one ought to intend to M.\n\nOne might argue for Ought Pattern 2 in the following way. Again,\nsuppose that it is not the case that one ought not to have the belief.\nThen, by Epistemic Strictness, one ought to have the belief. For the\ntime being, suppose that one does not intend to M. Then\nby:\n\nRequired Self-Knowledge:\nIf one does not intend to M, then one ought to believe\nthat one does not intend to M,\n\n\none ought to believe that one does not intend to M. Then\nby:\n\nReverse Closure:\nIf one ought to believe not Q and one ought to believe\nP only if Q, then one ought to believe not\nP,\n\n\none ought to believe that one will not E. Then by:\n\nEffectiveness:\nSo long as one ought to believe that one will not E, one\nhas no reason to intend to E, since the evidence suggests\nthat doing so is pointless.\n\n\none has no reason to intend to E. In other words, so long as\none does not intend to M, one has no reason to intend to\nE. If we also accept:\n\nCost:\nThere is reason not to intend to E,\n\n\nthen, so long as one does not intend to M, one has no reason\nto intend to E and reason not to intend to E. This\nmakes it plausible that there is more reason (not to intend to\nM and not to intend to E) than (not to intend to\nM and to intend to E). This does not mean\nthat one ought (not to intend to M and not to intend to\nE) all things considered. For example, it might be the case\nthat one ought (to intend to M and to intend to E).\nBut it does mean that whatever pattern of intention one ought to have,\nit is not to (not to intend to M and to intend to\nE). There is a superior alternative.\n\nOne question, of course, is whether we should accept these\nassumptions, in particular Required Self-Knowledge.\n\nAnother problem is that even if this explains Ought Pattern 2, and so\nthe Violation Claim, it does not explain the:\n\nSatisfaction Claim:\nOne satisfies a requirement by avoiding or escaping instrumental\nincoherence (of a kind which one would not satisfy by entering or\nremaining in instrumental incoherence) no matter how one does it.\n\n\nSuppose that one ought to have the means-end belief and one ought (to\nintend to E and to intend to M). However, one avoids\nincoherence by dropping the means-end belief, not intending to\nE, and not intending to M. Intuitively, one has\nsatisfied some requirement. This is what the Satisfaction Claim\nreflects. But one hasn\u2019t adopted the particular attitudes (or\npatterns) that one ought to adopt. How, then, are we to explain the\nSatisfaction Claim?\n\nA quick answer might be this. One might suggest, first, that one ought\nto be instrumentally coherent, because it is a necessary means to, or\nat least a necessary condition of, having the particular attitudes (or\npattern) that one independently ought to have, or not having the\nparticular attitudes (or pattern) that one independently ought not to\nhave. Suppose that one ought to intend to M, but does not.\nJust as (P or Q) is a necessary condition of\nP, so too a necessary condition of intending to M is\n(either not to intend to E, or not to believe that one will\nE only if one intends now to M, or to intend to\nM). Now suppose that instead of intending to M, one\ndrops one\u2019s intention to E. While one hasn\u2019t\nintended to M, which one ought to do, one has fulfilled a\nnecessary means, or at least a necessary condition, of that. Assume\nOught Necessity of\n \u00a72,\n perhaps slightly strengthened: that one ought to take any necessary\nmeans to, or at least fulfill any necessary condition of, what one\nought. In that sense, by dropping one\u2019s intention to E,\none has done something that one ought, and so satisfied a requirement.\nAnalogously, if one ought to post the letter, then, by similar\nreasoning, one ought (either to post the letter or to burn it). So, if\none burns the letter, one has done something that one ought, and so\nsatisfied a requirement.\n\nNote that this response assumes that either Ought Pattern 1 or Ought\nPattern 2 is correct. Otherwise, we have no guarantee that, in any\ngiven case, a necessary condition of having the particular attitudes\nthat one ought to have, or not having the particular attitudes that\none ought not to have, is (either not to intend to E, or not\nto believe that one will E only if one intends now to\nM, or to intend to M). So it inherits all of the\nchallenges in defending Ought Pattern 1 or Ought Pattern 2.\n\nAnother problem with this response is that it is not obvious that\nOught Necessity is true, as the Professor Procrastinate example of\n \u00a72\n suggested.\n\nA third problem is that necessary conditions of intending to\nM are easy to come by. Another necessary condition is (either\nintending to M or being instrumentally incoherent)!\nTherefore, in exactly the same way, one satisfies a requirement by\nremaining incoherent. But the intuitive Satisfaction Claim is\nprecisely that in escaping incoherence one satisfies a requirement of\na kind which one would not satisfy by remaining instrumentally\nincoherent.\n3.2 Requirements of Reason to be Instrumentally Coherent As Such\n\nThe Violation and Satisfaction Claims would be explained by a\nrequirement of reason to avoid or escape instrumental incoherence\nas such. Just as we ought not to torture, or ought to care\nfor our children, we ought to be instrumentally coherent as such.\n\nOne might instead suggest a weaker view: we have a reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. But this weaker version faces a\ndifficulty in explaining the \u201cstrictness\u201d of the Violation\nClaim. One could have a reason to X without being under any\nrequirement to X, as when that reason to X\nis outweighed. But, according to the Violation Claim, whenever one is\ninstrumentally incoherent, one violates some requirement. This\n\u201cstrictness\u201d would thus remain unexplained by the weaker\nview (Broome 1999). Of course, the weaker view\u2014that we have a\nreason to be instrumentally coherent as such\u2014could be true even\nthough it fails to explain the Violation and Satisfaction Claims.\n(However, some philosophers have raised important challenges to the\n\u201cstrictness\u201d of rational requirements. Most notably, Fogal\n2020 suggests replacing a \u201crequirements-based\u201d account of\nstructural rationality with a \u201cpressure-based\u201d\naccount.)\n\nSo, let\u2019s work with the stronger view, according to which we\nought to be instrumentally coherent as such. One worry about this\nanswer is \u201cbootstrapping.\u201d Suppose that this requirement\nto be instrumentally coherent as such is stated in\n\u201cnarrow-scope\u201d form: if one intends to E and\nbelieves that one will E only if one intends to M,\nthen one is required to intend to M. Now suppose that one\nintends to stay in power and believes that one will do so only if one\nintends to kill one\u2019s rival. If one ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent as such, it would follow that one ought to intend to kill\none\u2019s rival. But that seems implausible. So, one may conclude,\nwe cannot understand \u201cone is rationally required\u201d as\nimplying \u201cone ought.\u201d\n3.2.1 Wide-Scoping and its Problems\n\nA natural reply, however, is that there is another way to be\ninstrumentally coherent: namely, to abandon the intention to stay in\npower. Thus, a requirement of instrumental coherence as such should\ntake \u201cwide-scope.\u201d It should say: one is required to\neither revise one\u2019s intention to E, or revise\none\u2019s belief that one will E only if one intends to\nM, or intend to M. (See especially Broome 1999 and\nWallace 2006. For earlier defenses of the wide-scope view, see Hill\n1973 and Darwall 1983.) So even if \u201cone is rationally\nrequired\u201d is taken to imply \u201cone ought,\u201d all that\nfollows is that one ought to either revise the intention to stay in\npower, or revise the belief that one will do so only if one intends to\nkill one\u2019s rival, or intend to kill one\u2019s rival. It does\nnot follow that one ought to intend to kill one\u2019s rival.\n\nHowever, there are some problems facing this approach, which we\noutline in the supplemental document\n Problems for Wide-Scoping.\n Some of those problems concern the allegedly implausible consequences\nthat emerge when we apply some of the transmission principles we\ndiscuss in\n \u00a72\n above\u2014specifically, Ought Necessity, Weak Reasons Necessity,\nand Weak Reasons Sufficiency\u2014to the relevant wide-scope ought in\ncertain cases. Other problems concern whether the wide-scope\nformulation is adequate as a formulation of the rational\nrequirement.\n3.2.2 What is the Reason?\n\nThere are other challenges facing the view that the Violation and\nSatisfaction Claims are explained by a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. The proponent of this view,\npresumably, should be able to say what the reason is to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such (see Kolodny 2005, \u00a72).\n\nKeep in mind that it won\u2019t be enough to state a reason to be\ndisposed to be instrumentally coherent. It doesn\u2019t\nfollow from one\u2019s having a reason to have a disposition that one\nhas a reason to manifest that disposition on every particular\noccasion. And so pointing to a reason to be disposed to be coherent\nwouldn\u2019t yield a reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.\n(As we\u2019ll see in\n \u00a74.4,\n a similar problem confronts the Kantian constitutivist view that\ncontinued instrumental incoherence threatens our status as agents.\nSince our agency isn\u2019t at risk with every instance of\ninstrumental incoherence, this account won\u2019t yield a reason to\nbe instrumentally coherent on every particular occasion; it would only\nprovide a reason to do so when one\u2019s incoherence is extreme\nenough to threaten one\u2019s status as an agent.) Furthermore, it is\nnot clear what reasons there are to be disposed to be instrumentally\ncoherent. It might be thought that being disposed to be instrumentally\ncoherent will make one more likely to conform to reason over the long\nrun. But given that instrumental coherence may just as soon be gained\nby revising one\u2019s attitudes against reason as in conformity to\nreason, one might doubt that this is so (Kolodny 2008b).\n\nThere\u2019s a reason to be skeptical that such a reason could be\nprovided. A reason to be instrumentally coherent as such would have to\napply at once to beliefs and intentions. But one might think that this\ncannot be the case: that reasons for belief and reasons for intention\nare fundamentally different in kind. Reasons for belief are\nconsiderations that show that the belief is likely to be true, whereas\nreasons for action are considerations that show that the action would\nrealize one\u2019s desires, or promote or respect something of\nvalue.\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to meet this challenge. Jonathan Way\n(2012a) has developed an account which points to the costs necessarily\ninvolved in intending to E without also intending to\nM, specifically the psychological resources that would be\nwasted (one\u2019s monitoring one\u2019s progress towards\nE-ing, being disposed to take means towards E-ing,\netc.). And Michael Bratman (2009c) has suggested that we have a reason\nto be instrumentally coherent as such because doing so is a necessary,\nconstitutive component of self-governance, and we have an intrinsic\nreason to govern ourselves. In his view, just as we have a reason not\nto torture, and a reason to care for our children, we have a reason to\ngovern ourselves. And one\u2019s being instrumentally incoherent on\nany particular occasion would be a way of failing to govern oneself.\nAlso, Alex Worsnip (2021, Ch.8) has argued that consideration about\ncoherence constitute (non-derivative) reasons to structure\ndeliberation in certain ways \u2014 in particular, they\nconstitute reasons to treat certain options as\n\u201coff-limits\u201d in one\u2019s deliberations. On this view,\nwe would have reason to treat the instrumentally incoherent\ncombination [intending to X, not intending to Y, believing intending\nto Y is necessary for X-ing] as off-limits. Why is there such a\nreason? For Worsnip, it\u2019s simply fitting to stucture\ndeliberation in a way that respects coherence constraints.\n3.3 Instrumental Incoherence without Violating Requirements of Reason\n\nA third approach to instrumental incoherence holds that one need not\nviolate any requirement of reason in being instrumentally incoherent.\nOne version of this view\n (\u00a73.3.1)\n holds that instrumental coherence is to be explained in terms of\nappropriate responses to one\u2019s beliefs about\nindependent requirements of reason, where these beliefs could be\nfalse. Another version of this view\n (\u00a73.3.2)\n holds that instrumental incoherence is nothing more than an indicator\nthat one is not functioning well as an agent, where this evaluation\ndoesn\u2019t entail any particular conclusions about what one ought,\nor has reason, to do.\n3.3.1 Responsiveness to Beliefs about Independent Requirements of Reason\n\nOn this first approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction\nClaims, what one does \u201cwrong\u201d in being instrumentally\nincoherent is violate one\u2019s own judgments about one\u2019s\nreasons (or fail to be attentive enough to form such judgments in the\nfirst place), and what one does \u201cright\u201d in becoming\ninstrumentally coherent is respond appropriately to one\u2019s\njudgments about one\u2019s reasons.\n\nSuppose one is instrumentally incoherent. Plausibly, one is in a\nposition to know this, that one is instrumentally incoherent.\nPlausibly, one is also in a position to know Ought Pattern 2: the\ngeneral fact that, when one is instrumentally incoherent, there is\nsome specific change that one ought to make. So, one is in a position\nto know that there is some specific change that one ought to make. So,\nplausibly, one ought to give some thought to what this specific change\nis. In other words,\n\nSelf-Monitoring:\nIf one is instrumentally incoherent, then one ought to arrive at\nsome belief about which attitude (or pattern of attitudes) one ought\nto have.\n\n\nSuppose one arrives at some such belief. And suppose one revises\none\u2019s attitudes in accordance with that belief. If one becomes\ninstrumentally coherent in this way, then, even if one\nrevises one\u2019s attitudes in the wrong way (i.e., against reason),\none still satisfies:\n\nSelf-Monitoring, and\nKrasia: If one believes that reason requires one to X (or\nnot to X), then one is rationally required to X (or\nnot to X).\n\n\nThis would explain the Satisfaction Claim.\n\nIt might be thought that it\u2019s not much of an improvement to\nexplain the requirement to be instrumentally coherent in terms of\nSelf-Monitoring and Krasia, since we are still appealing to a\nrequirement of coherence: namely, Krasia. The only difference is that\nit requires us not to be instrumentally coherent, but instead\nto be kratically coherent: i.e., to follow one\u2019s\njudgment about one\u2019s reasons. Indeed, if we thought that it\nwere a requirement of reason to comply with Krasia, then\nsimilar challenges to those we discussed in\n \u00a73.2.\n would reappear, and so it would not be much of an improvement.\n\nBut, the view considered here naturally suggests a new strategy:\npresenting a Transparency Account according to which the normativity\nof instrumental coherence is merely apparent (Kolodny 2005, \u00a75).\nAccording to the Transparency Account of rational requirements in\ngeneral, when we point out to people that rationality requires\nsomething of them, we aren\u2019t presenting them with some\nrequirement of reason; rather, we\u2019re pointing out to them what\nthey already think reason requires of them. And, so, when we point out\nto someone that rationality requires they be instrumentally coherent\nwith respect to some end, we\u2019re pointing out to them that (on\nthe assumption that Self-Monitoring is satisfied) they already think\nthat reason requires some specific change in their attitudes. Of\ncourse, the instrumentally incoherent agent could be mistaken in these\nthoughts; perhaps he thinks reason requires him to intend the means\nwhen reason actually requires that he abandon the end instead. It is\nthis possibility for false belief that restricts us to saying that the\nnormativity of rational requirements is merely apparent.\n\nHowever, one might challenge whether the Satisfaction Claim is\nadequately explained by an appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia.\nSuppose an instrumentally incoherent agent knows that she ought to\ngive up her intention to kill her boss, but instead she comes to\nintend to poison the office coffee, which she believes to be a\nnecessary means to killing her boss. She clearly violates a\nrequirement of reason and she clearly violates Krasia, but it still\nseems that she satisfies some requirement in coming to intend the\nmeans to her immoral end. The appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia\ncan\u2019t explain our thinking that she satisfies some requirement\nin proceeding this way.\n3.3.2 Proper Functioning\n\nPerhaps a violation of a requirement of instrumental coherence is\nmerely an indicator that an agent is not functioning well in the\nexercise of her rational capacities, where this evaluation\ndoesn\u2019t entail that she ought, or has reason, to be\ninstrumentally coherent on any particular occasion (see Raz 2005a,b).\nIn holding this view, one could also say that there is value in being\na properly functioning agent, and that this value is explained by the\nways in which functioning properly as a agent tends to bring one into\nconformity with what reason requires. But, it doesn\u2019t follow\nfrom this that there is value in functioning properly, or that one has\nany reason to function properly, in every particular occasion.\n(Similar things could be said about the value of having\nwell-functioning perceptual capacities.) For instance, when one has\nthe unalterable intention to kill one\u2019s boss (for more on\nunalterable ends, see\n Section 1\n of the supplementary document\n Problems for Wide Scoping),\n there is nothing valuable in one\u2019s functioning properly, so far\nas instrumental rationality goes, on that particular occasion, and one\nwould have no reason to do so (see Raz 2005a, especially pp.\n10\u201313, and Bratman 1987).\n\nBut one might worry about how well this account explains the Violation\nand Satisfaction Claims. On this view, the requirements violated, or\nsatisfied, are simply standards of proper rational functioning. These\nstandards can be used to evaluate how well particular agents are\nfunctioning, in the same way that standards of what makes for a\nwell-functioning perceptual apparatus can be used to evaluate how well\nparticular perceivers are functioning. But, rational requirements also\nseem to call for some response. For instance, when we advise\nothers who are in violation of rational requirements, such as those\nwho are instrumentally incoherent, we say that some change in attitude\nis called for. And, when we ourselves are instrumentally\nincoherent, we feel some \u201cnormative pressure\u201d to change\nour attitudes in some way (see Kolodny 2005, \u00a74). It\u2019s\nunclear how these features of rational requirements could be explained\nby a view that takes them to be merely evaluative.\n\nAnother related view attempts to explain instrumental incoherence in\nterms of the success conditions of the relevant individual\nattitudes. If your belief that intending to Y is necessary for X-ing\nis successful (true), then your failure to intend to Y ensures that\nyour intending to X will not be successful (in that it won\u2019t\nresult in your X-ing). In other words, your being instrumentally\nincoherent ensures that either your instrumental belief is false, or\nthat your intention will not be successfully executed (Brunero 2020,\nCh.7). Some philosophers have recently argued that the impossibility\nof joint attitudinal success can explain coherence requirements in\ngeneral, not just instrumental rationality (Fullhart and Martinez,\nforthcoming; Fink, forthcoming).\n3.4 \u201cCognitivist\u201d Requirements on Belief\n\nA fourth approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction Claims\nargues that the requirement violated, or satisfied, is, or is\nexplained by, requirements on belief exclusively. There are\ntwo components to this \u201ccognitivist\u201d approach: first,\nthere is some thesis about how intention involves belief, and, second,\nthere is some account of how the requirements governing those involved\nbeliefs constitute, or explain, the requirement to be instrumentally\ncoherent.\n\nHere are some candidates for the first component:\n\nStrong: If one intends to E, then one believes that one\nwill E.\nMedium: If one intends to E, then one believes that it is\npossible that one will E.\nWeak: If one intends to E, then one does not believe that\none will not E.\n\n\n(Cognitivist accounts developed with Strong, or a variant of it, are\nfound in Harman 1976, 1986; Velleman 1989, 2007; Setiya 2007; Broome\n2009; and Archer 2018. Earlier defenses of Strong can be found in\nHampshire and Hart 1958 and Grice 1971. Wallace 2006 develops a\ncognitivist account with Medium, and Binkley 1965 does so with\nWeak.)\n3.4.1 Strong\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Strong. Suppose I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. According to Strong, I believe\n\nI will E.\n\n\nWhen we pair this with my instrumental belief\n\nIf I will E, then I intend to M,\n\n\nand apply the theoretical rational requirement\n\nClosure:\nRationality requires that [if one believes P, and one\nbelieves P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q, then one believes\nQ].\n\n\nwe get the result that I am required to believe\n\nI intend to M,\n\n\nor drop either (1) or (2). If I drop (1), I would cease to intend to\nE (according to Strong) and thereby cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent, and if I drop my instrumental belief (2), I\nwould also cease to be instrumentally incoherent.\n\nBut is coming to believe (3) enough to cease to be instrumentally\nincoherent? What if my belief is false? There are two options for the\ncognitivist at this point. The first would be to defend\n\nSelf-Fulfillment:\nIf one believes that one intends to M, then one intends\nto M.\n\n\nBut we might doubt that we are infallible in our beliefs about our own\nintentions (Bratman 2009b, \u00a74,5). After all, it seems that we can\nbe mistaken in our beliefs about other attitudes we have (see\nSchwitzgebel 2010, \u00a74).\n\nA second option for the cognitivist would be to say that having false\nbeliefs about one\u2019s own intentions is possible, but\ntheoretically irrational. (On this option, the cognitivist\napproach to instrumental coherence appeals to two theoretical\nrequirements: Closure plus some other requirement not to have false\nbeliefs about one\u2019s own intentions.) However, there is usually\nnothing necessarily incoherent about one\u2019s having a\nfalse belief. So, the challenge for cognitivists is to\nexplain why, in this particular case, there is. (This strategy is\npursued by Setiya 2007, 670\u2013671. For criticism, see Bratman\n2009a, \u00a74 and Brunero 2009, \u00a72.)\n\nAdditionally, one might worry that Strong is too strong. Suppose you\nintend to go shopping on Thursday but don\u2019t believe you intend\nthis and instead believe that you intend to go shopping on Friday.\nMaybe you\u2019ve temporarily forgotten that you\u2019ve recently\nchanged your mind, deciding to go on Thursday instead of Friday\n(Bratman 2009a, \u00a75). In this case, you might not believe you will\ngo shopping on Thursday. In light of this example, John Broome (2009,\n\u00a77) suggests the following\n\nVariant of Strong:\nIf one believes one intends to E, then one\nbelieves one will E.\n\n\nBut this wouldn\u2019t help the cognitivist if she aims to account\nfor the application of instrumental coherence to all intentions,\nincluding those we don\u2019t believe we have (Bratman 2009b,\n\u00a72). Additionally, both Strong and Variant of Strong seem\nvulnerable to counterexamples. Suppose I intend, and believe I intend,\nto carry out a difficult task. Knowing the difficulty involved, I\ncould intend to carry out the task but remain agnostic about whether I\nwill do so. Here\u2019s another counterexample: suppose I intend to\nstop by a bookstore on the way home, but know that once I\u2019m\nriding on my bicycle, I tend to go on \u201cautopilot.\u201d Aware\nof my absentminded tendencies, I might intend to stop by the bookstore\nwithout believing I will (Bratman 1987, 38\u201339; also discussed in\nHolton 2008, \u00a72). Since such intentions make applicable a\nrequirement of instrumental coherence, but don\u2019t involve a\nbelief in success, the cognitivist cannot explain why requirements of\ninstrumental coherence apply to these intentions.\n3.4.2 Medium\n\nNext, let us consider Medium. Suppose again that I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. By\n\nSelf-Knowledge:\nIf one does not intend to M, then one believes that one\ndoes not intend to M.\n\n\nI believe:\n\nI do not intend to M.\n\n\nLet us now suppose that the instrumental belief takes this form:\n\nIf I do not intend to M, then it is not possible for me\nto E.\n\n\nIf I satisfy Closure, then I believe:\n\nIt is not possible for me to E.\n\n\nHowever, since I intend to E, then, by Medium, I believe:\n\nIt is possible for me to E.\n\n\nThus, in believing (3) and (4), I violate:\n\nBelief Consistency:\nRationality requires that [if one believes not P, then\none does not believe P]\n\n\nThus, if one satisfies Closure, then one violates Belief Consistency\n(Wallace 2006).\n\nOne might object to Self-Knowledge, arguing that we aren\u2019t\nalways aware of what we fail to intend. One might falsely believe one\nintends the means (Bratman 2009a) or one might simply fail to notice\nthat one hasn\u2019t intended the means (Brunero 2005a). One response\navailable to the cognitivist would be to say that such lapses in\nself-awareness are possible, but are theoretically\nirrational. And so instrumental coherence would be explained\nby Closure, Belief Consistency, and the requirement to be aware of\none\u2019s absent intention in this context. While it wouldn\u2019t\nbe plausible to claim that rationality requires, in general, awareness\nof what one does not intend, it might be plausible to say that\nawareness of what one does not intend is rationally required in this\nspecific context (Wallace 2006, 118).\n\nOne might also object that if one is going to be a cognitivist about\npractical requirements in general, one must account for both\ninstrumental coherence and\n\nIntention Consistency:\nOne is required [if one intends not to E, then one does\nnot intend to E].\n\n\nBut Medium, on its own, does not seem sufficient to account for\nIntention Consistency. Such a conflict of intentions would involve the\nfollowing beliefs:\n\nIt is possible for me not to E,\nIt is possible for me to E,\n\n\nBut unlike those beliefs involved according to Strong, namely,\n\nI will not E,\nI will E,\n\n\n(5) and (6) are perfectly consistent with one another. I could\nconsistently believe it\u2019s possible that I not go to the game\ntonight, and possible that I go to the game tonight. So, we are still\nin need of an explanation of why I\u2019m rationally required to not\nboth intend not to go and intend to go (Bratman 2009b, \u00a73).\n\nOne might also raise doubts about Medium. Suppose I know I\nhaven\u2019t yet investigated whether the stores are closed for the\nholiday on Thursday, and so I haven\u2019t yet formed any beliefs\nabout whether I can go shopping then. Couldn\u2019t I still intend to\ngo shopping on Thursday? That might be irrational or careless planning\non my part, but it seems possible. (The example might prove even more\nconvincing if we add the feature of Bratman\u2019s example above:\nsuppose, forgetting about my change of mind, I believe I intend to go\nshopping on Friday, not on Thursday.) Perhaps doubts could even be\nraised, not just about whether intending to E involves\nbelieving E is possible, but also about whether intending to\nE involves not believing E is impossible.\nRichard Holton (2008), drawing on Anscombe\u2019s example from\nIntention (\u00a752) of a man who is certain he\u2019ll\nbreak down under torture but is determined not to break down, has\nargued that one could intend some end while believing that end\nisn\u2019t a \u201clive possibility.\u201d Such combinations,\nHolton argues, may be irrational, but aren\u2019t impossible.\n3.4.3 Weak\n\nNext, let us consider Weak. Suppose again that I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. By Self-Knowledge, I believe:\n\nI do not intend to M.\n\n\nWhen this belief is paired with the contrapositive of my instrumental\nbelief\n\nIf I do not intend to M, I will not E,\n\n\nClosure requires that I believe\n\nI will not E,\n\n\nor cease to believe (1) or (2). But since I intend to E, it\nfollows, by Weak, that I do not believe (3). Were I to comply with\nClosure by forming the belief (3), I would, according to Weak, thereby\ncease to intend to E. In ceasing to believe (2), I would\ncease to be instrumentally incoherent. And in ceasing to believe (1)\n(which, if Self-Knowledge is true, would mean that it is no longer the\ncase that I do not intend to M) I would also cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent.\n\nSome of the objections mentioned above would also apply to this\naccount. There is the objection to Self-Knowledge. And\nAnscombe\u2019s example, exploited by Holton, also presents a\nchallenge to Weak, since the torture victim intends not to break down\nbut believes that he will.\n\nAdditionally, one might raise questions concerning the rationality of\nresponding to the violation of Closure in this context.\nUsually, if one discovers that one believes P,\nP\u2009\u2192\u2009Q, but does not believe\nQ, the rational way to proceed depends upon one\u2019s\nassessment of the relevant reasons for belief (where these are\nevidential, not pragmatic, reasons). Let us assume, for simplicity,\nthat P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q is a fixed background\nbelief. If one thinks there are really strong reasons for believing\nP and not strong reasons for not believing Q, then\nit would be irrational for one to refuse to believe Q and\ninstead to drop one\u2019s belief that P. Now, according to\nthis cognitivist account, when I\u2019m instrumentally incoherent, I\nbelieve (1) and (2) but not (3). How should I proceed? If I currently\ndo not intend to M, and if, as Self-Knowledge holds,\nI\u2019m infallibly aware of what I do not intend, then it seems that\nthe evidence I have for my belief that I do not intend to M\nis really quite strong. Let\u2019s assume (2) is a fixed background\nbelief. In revising in light of my assessment of the evidence, it\nseems that the revision could only proceed in one direction: by\nmodus ponens, coming to believe I will not E. It\nwould be irrational for me instead to proceed by modus\ntollens, ceasing to believe that I do not intend to M.\nSo, if we respond to violations of Closure in the usual way, we are\nleft with the counterintuitive result that there is only one way to\nescape a state of instrumental incoherence: by abandoning the end.\n\nFinally, one might also cast doubt on the general cognitivist strategy\nbeing employed here, whether it appeals to Weak, Medium, or Strong.\nMany of the same questions that we\u2019ve raised about instrumental\nincoherence could be raised about rational requirements on belief,\nincluding Belief Consistency and Closure. There are analogues of the\nViolation and Satisfaction Claims for these rational requirements that\nwould need to be defended and explained. For example, Joseph Raz\nquestions whether the analogue of the Violation Claim for Belief\nConsistency is even true (see Raz 2005b, \u00a73; Raz 2005a, \u00a75).\nIf one has a set of beliefs that is inconsistent, then at least one of\nthe beliefs in that set is false. But, Raz argues, it does not follow\nthat there is any revision in one\u2019s beliefs that one ought to\nmake. (Reflection on logical paradoxes, like the sorities paradox,\nshows that having an inconsistent set of beliefs doesn\u2019t imply\nthat there is any belief in the set that one ought to give up.)\nAlthough Raz objects to the cognitivist\u2019s appeal to Belief\nConsistency in particular, similar questions might be raised about the\ncognitivist\u2019s appeal to Closure.\n4. The Status of Instrumental Rationality\n\nMuch discussion of instrumental rationality has taken place in the\ncontext of a debate about whether instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality or, alternatively, there are other\nrequirements of practical rationality as well, such as requirements of\nprudence and morality. Typically, the former view is called a\n\u201cHumean\u201d one and the latter a \u201cKantian\u201d one.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll consider some possible understandings of\nthe thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality\n (\u00a74.1),\n and whether some version of this thesis is given any support by an\ninstrumental analogue of Lewis Carroll\u2019s famous paradox\nconcerning modus ponens\n (\u00a74.2).\n We\u2019ll also consider the views of Hume\n (\u00a74.3)\n and Kant\n (\u00a74.4)\n on instrumental rationality.\n4.1 The Only Kind of Practical Rationality?\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that instrumental rationality is the only kind\nof practical rationality. But what exactly is being claimed?\n\nIs the claim about rational incoherence? Then it would seem to be the\nclaim that the only kind of practical, rational incoherence is\ninstrumental incoherence. But this claim would have to contend with\nthe idea that there are other kinds of practical, rational\nincoherence. For example, it seems incoherent to refuse to intend what\none believes one ought to intend. It also seems incoherent to intend\nto X and to intend to Y when one believes that if\none Xs, one will not Y.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be about reason: that all (practical)\nreason is, in some sense, instrumental. On one interpretation, the\nclaim would say that the only true claim about reason is some\nprinciple of instrumental transmission. But this would seem to\nimply that there are no practical reasons at all. Unless there is some\nother true claim about reasons for \u201cends\u201d understood as\nactions, there is nothing to be transmitted. (For arguments that there\nwould need to be another kind of rationality, see Nozick 1993;\nKorsgaard 1997; Hampton 1998; Hubin 1999; Lavin 2004.)\n\nA different interpretation is that all reasons are\ninstrumental. In other words, the reason for any action (or\nintention) can be expressed as: the action will help to bring about\nsome \u201cend,\u201d where \u201cend\u201d is understood not as\nan action, but instead as some valuable or desired state of affairs.\nThe Desire-Based Theory is committed to this claim. But not all\nValue-Based Theories are. The reason for an action, for example, might\nbe that it honors or respects something of value, even though it does\nnot help to bring it about.\n\nA final interpretation is that all deliberation is of means.\nIn other words, there is no place for significant evaluative or\nnormative reflection on the ultimate ends that one has reason to bring\nabout. The Desire-Based Theory seems committed to this claim, at least\nto some extent. According to the Desire-Based Theory, reflection on\nthe ultimate ends that one has reason to bring about is just\nreflection on the non-normative matter of what one in fact desires,\nplus grasp of the Desire-Based Theory itself. On the other hand,\nValue-Based theories seem committed to rejecting this claim, even\nthose Value-Based Theories that accept that all reasons are\ninstrumental in the sense discussed in the previous paragraph. For\nwhether a certain state of affairs is valuable, and so an end that one\nhas reason to bring about, is itself the object of significant\nevaluative thought. (Note that it is a mistake to express the present\nidea, that all deliberation is of means, as the idea that one cannot\nbe criticized for ends. According to the Desire-Based Theory,\none can be criticized for what one intends or acts\nto bring about, insofar as it is not the realization of one\u2019s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desires. And even according to\nValue-Based theories, one cannot be criticized for what one has\nreason to bring about.)\n\nNotice that the Desire-Based Theory is committed to the claim that\npractical reason is exclusively instrumental, on these two last\ninterpretations. This may explain why the Desire-Based Theory is often\nsimply identified with \u201cinstrumental rationality,\u201d and why\nthe claim that \u201cthe only kind of practical rationality is\ninstrumental rationality\u201d is sometimes just meant as an\nassertion of the Desire-Based Theory.\n4.2 The Relevance of Carroll\u2019s Paradox\n\nLewis Carroll (1895) introduced a famous paradox concerning modus\nponens. Some philosophers have argued that an instrumental\nanalogue of this paradox shows there to be something special about\ninstrumental rationality, and perhaps even provides support for some\nversion of the thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind\nof practical rationality.\n\nCarroll imagined a conversation between Achilles and a Tortoise\nregarding the following valid argument:\n\n(A)\nThings that are equal to the same are equal to each other.\n(B)\nThe two sides of the Triangle are equal to the same.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n(Z)\nThe two sides are equal to each other.\n\n\nThe Tortoise adopts a skeptical position, asking how he can be\nlogically forced into accepting (Z) when he accepts (A) and (B).\nAchilles attempts to supply him with the missing premise:\n\n(C)\nIf (A) & (B) are true, (Z) must be true.\n\n\nBut the Tortoise grants (C), and resumes his skepticism, asking how he\ncan be logically forced to accept (Z) when he accepts (A), (B), and\n(C). It soon dawns on Achilles that the mere addition of further\npremises (like \u201cIf (A), (B), and (C) are true, (Z) must be\ntrue\u201d, and so on) won\u2019t help resolve the Tortoise\u2019s\nskepticism. One could keep on adding such premises ad\ninfinitum and yet not get the Tortoise to accept (Z).\n\nMuch has been written about what lessons to draw from Carroll\u2019s\nparadox, but this much seems clear: the Tortoise refuses to accept (Z)\nbecause he refuses to apply modus ponens to the premises he\naccepts. So, if modus ponens itself is merely\naccepted by him as yet another premise, that won\u2019t suffice to\nget him to accept (Z).\n\nNow, imagine we confront someone who holds some end E,\nbelieves some means M is necessary for E-ing, yet\ndoesn\u2019t intend to M, and, like the Tortoise,\ndoesn\u2019t intend to M because he refuses to\napply instrumental rationality to the ends he has, including\nE. If we suggest that he remedy this defect by adopting yet\nanother end (namely, the end of doing what instrumental rationality\nrequires), this wouldn\u2019t help matters. Since his problem is that\nhe doesn\u2019t apply instrumental rationality to the ends he has, he\nwouldn\u2019t apply instrumental rationality to this new end as well,\nand so still wouldn\u2019t intend to M (or drop the\nintention to E). So, the mere addition of instrumental\nrationality as another end would be futile.\n\nWhat should we conclude from this instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox? Railton (1997) argues that it shows that a\ncertain form of skepticism about rationality\u2014specifically,\none\u2019s asking \u201cWhy should I comply with the norms of\npractical rationality?\u201d\u2014can be answered. First, the asking\nof this skeptical question reveals a commitment to at least\ninstrumental rationality, since one is here questioning whether being\npractically rational would advance one\u2019s ends. And,\nsecond, the instrumental analogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox shows\nthat we can\u2019t think of this commitment to instrumental\nrationality as merely another end the agent accepts and could dismiss\nat will. If the skeptic thinks it is, Railton suggests that \u201cwe\ncan answer \u2018No, on pain of regress, it cannot be just another\nend of yours\u2019\u201d (p. 317).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not clear why the skeptic would have to think of\ninstrumental rationality as just another end she has. Couldn\u2019t\nshe think of it instead as (or also as) a disposition that she\nmanifests, or a capacity that she exercises, with respect to the ends\nthat she accepts? (If so, she would avoid the particular problem that\nconfronts the character in the instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox, who merely accepts instrumental rationality\nas another end without applying it to her ends.) And then\ncouldn\u2019t she request some philosophical explanation of why she\nshould exercise that capacity? That she already has the capacity is of\ncourse no barrier to posing such a question (Wedgwood 2005). Indeed,\nas we\u2019ve seen in\n \u00a73.3,\n some philosophers have denied that we always ought, or have\nreason, to be instrumentally coherent; they\u2019ve argued that\nrational requirements are only apparently normative, or are merely\nevaluative.\n\nDreier (2001) concludes that the instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox shows that instrumental rationality has a\nspecial status. In Carroll\u2019s original paradox, the Tortoise\nwould be such that we couldn\u2019t give him reasons to believe in\nsome proposition. In the normal case, I can provide you with a reason\nto believe Q by getting you to believe P and to\nbelieve P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q. But this simply\nwon\u2019t work for the Tortoise, who refuses to apply modus\nponens. Likewise, Dreier observes, we would be incapable of\ngiving reasons to someone who refused to draw \u201cpractical\ninferences\u201d between ends and means. The acceptance of\ninstrumental rationality is thus, he argues, a necessary condition for\nbeing receptive to reasons at all. And this supports his conclusion\nthat \u201cthe only ultimate sort of reasons are instrumental\nreasons\u201d (p. 43). This seems to be an endorsement of the\nDesire-Based Theory.\n\nDoes the conclusion follow? Even if a disposition to be instrumentally\nrational is indispensable in the way Dreier suggests to\nhaving a practical reason, nothing follows about\nwhat one has practical reason to do. Additionally, it\u2019s\nworth noting that it\u2019s doubtful that Carroll\u2019s original\nparadox would license a restriction on the scope of\ntheoretical reasons analogous to the Humean restriction on\nthe scope of practical reasons that Dreier thinks the instrumental\nanalogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox supports. That is, it is not\nobvious that I have reason to believe Q only if I am disposed\nto come to believe it by applying modus ponens. Perhaps my\nmerely believing, with reason, both P and\nP\u2009\u2192\u2009Q provides me with a reason\nfor believing Q. Or perhaps the mere fact the available\nevidence supports Q is enough (Jollimore 2005).\n\nKorsgaard (2009) argues that we can draw a conclusion about the\nmetaethical status of instrumental rationality by considering\nan instrumental analogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox. Specifically, she\nappeals to it to argue against metaethical realism about instrumental\nrationality (and about other normative principles as well).\nLet\u2019s suppose that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent. A realist would claim that there is some\nnormative fact, according to which we ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent. But a skeptic might ask, \u201cWhy ought I apply that\nfact\u2014that I ought to be instrumentally coherent\u2014to my\nactions?\u201d The realist might answer, \u201cBecause\u2014and\nhere\u2019s another normative fact\u2014it just is the case that you\nought to apply the fact that you ought to be instrumentally coherent\nto your actions.\u201d But one might resume one\u2019s skepticism\nand ask why one must apply that normative fact to one\u2019s\nactions. One could keep adding normative facts ad infinitum\nwithout providing an answer to the question, in the same way that\nAchilles could keep adding premises without meeting the\nTortoise\u2019s challenge.\n\nA full discussion of the metaethical issues raised by this argument\nwould take us too far afield (see Parfit 2006). But one strategy of\nreply is to argue that the realist has already answered the question.\nWhat it is for such normative facts to be normative just is\nthat they require that you act in some way. If you\u2019re asking of\nnormative facts in general why you should act in accordance with them,\nthen you don\u2019t fully understand what normative facts are.\n4.3 Hume on Instrumental Rationality\n\nThe thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality is often taken to be a \u201cHumean\u201d thesis,\nthough, as we\u2019ve seen\n (\u00a74.1),\n there are several ways in which this thesis could be understood. One\ncould take the thesis just to be an assertion of the Desire-Based\nTheory. One could also take the thesis to specify that instrumental\ncoherence is the only requirement of practical rationality. However,\nit is doubtful that Hume held either of these views.\n\nThere are some passages which might seem to suggest these views. In\nBook II of the Treatise (1739\u201340), Hume denies that a\nperson\u2019s ends, however immoral or imprudent, can be unreasonable\n(\u201ccontrary to reason,\u201d to use his exact phrase) if\nthey\u2019re not based on a false belief:\n\nWhere a passion is neither founded on false suppositions, nor chuses\nmeans insufficient for the end, the understanding can neither justify\nnor condemn it. \u2019Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the\ndestruction of the world to the scratching of my finger. \u2019Tis\nnot contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the\nleast uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me.\n\u2019Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own\nacknowledg\u2019d lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent\naffection for the former than the latter. (p. 416)\n\n\nHere he seems to claim that one\u2019s choosing means insufficient\nfor one\u2019s end can be deemed unreasonable, even though the end\nitself is not subject to such rational assessment.\n\nHowever, this wouldn\u2019t support the Desire-Based Theory, since\nthe Desire-Based Theory allows that ends can be unreasonable when they\ndon\u2019t promote the satisfaction of one\u2019s strongest, present\nintrinsic desires. For instance, choosing one\u2019s total ruin, when\ndoing so runs counter to one\u2019s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesires, even when doing so isn\u2019t based on a false belief, can\nbe criticized as unreasonable on the Desire-Based Theory.\n\nSoon after this passage, Hume is careful to note that it\nwouldn\u2019t be one\u2019s intending of means insufficient\nfor one\u2019s ends that\u2019s unreasonable, but the false\nbelief on which this intention is based. For example, when I\nfalsely believe that staying on 95N will get me to Memphis, which is\nwhere I intend to go, and so I intend to stay on 95N, it\u2019s my\nbelief that 95N will get me to Memphis that\u2019s unreasonable, not\nthe intention, based on this belief, to stay on 95N.\n\nWhy did Hume think this? Hume holds that \u201creason is the\ndiscovery of truth and falsehood\u201d (p. 458). Since beliefs aim to\ncorrectly represent the world\u2014and the beliefs that succeed in\nrepresenting the world are true, while the beliefs that fail to do so\nare false\u2014they can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\nBut passions, as well as intentions and actions, are \u201coriginal\nexistences.\u201d They don\u2019t purport to represent or\n\u201ccopy\u201d some other \u201cexistence\u201d (p. 415).\nSpecifically, they don\u2019t aim to correctly represent the world,\nand so they can\u2019t be true or false. Hence, they can\u2019t be\nassessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\n\nIn light of such considerations, many philosophers have argued that\nHume doesn\u2019t endorse an instrumentalist conception of practical\nreason, but instead, more radically, is a skeptic about all of\npractical reason. (See, for instance, Hampton 1995; Millgram 1995;\nKorsgaard 1997. For objections to this skeptical interpretation of\nHume, see Setiya 2004.) On this interpretation, Hume acknowledges the\nexistence of requirements of theoretical reason, since\nbeliefs can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable, but is\nskeptical about the existence of requirements of practical\nreason, including instrumental reason, since desires, intentions, and\nactions can\u2019t be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable. (Even a\npreference for \u201cone\u2019s own acknowledg\u2019d lesser\ngood\u201d wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable, on his view.) Since, on\nthis interpretation, Hume was skeptical about practical reason in\ngeneral, we can\u2019t appeal to his view to establish a special\nplace for instrumental rationality among the requirements of practical\nrationality.\n\nVarious challenges could be raised against Hume\u2019s rather narrow\nconception of reason. But our primary interest here is in whether Hume\ncan provide us with a plausible account of instrumental\nrationality. On Hume\u2019s view, our intentions are subject to\nrational criticism when, and only when, they are based on false\nbeliefs (and, again, it\u2019s the belief that\u2019s to blame,\nstrictly speaking). As an account of instrumental rationality,\nHume\u2019s view would face two serious objections.\n\nFirst, it seems that one can be instrumentally irrational without\nhaving any intentions based on false beliefs (or lacking any\nintentions because of false beliefs). John Broome provides an example:\nsuppose I know the hotel is on fire and that the only escape involves\nmy intending to go through the open window, and, though I intend to\nlive, I sit on the windowsill singing happily until the flames consume\nme. This is a clear case of instrumental irrationality, despite my not\nhaving any false beliefs (Broome 1997). Indeed, one could fail to\nintend the means believed necessary for one\u2019s ends because of\nrage, depression, distraction, grief, or other causes which\ndon\u2019t necessarily involve any false beliefs (Korsgaard 1986).\nHume would have to conclude either that such cases are impossible, or\nthat they involve no instrumental irrationality.\n\nSecond, it seems that one can have intentions based on false beliefs\nwithout being instrumentally irrational, or irrational in any other\nway. Instrumental rationality, as it\u2019s usually understood, is a\nrequirement of coherence governing one\u2019s intentions and\nbeliefs\u2014a requirement that is in place regardless of the\ntruth of those beliefs. The person who intends to get to\nMemphis, believes that he must intend to stay on 95N to get there, and\ndoes intend to stay on 95N, displays coherence in his attitudes,\ndespite having a false belief. So, an accusation of instrumental\nirrationality here would be misplaced. (Additionally, it would also be\ninappropriate to accuse him of any theoretical irrationality,\nif we suppose that this belief isn\u2019t inconsistent with any other\nbeliefs he holds, and he also believes there\u2019s conclusive\nevidence for it, and so forth.) Hume would have to conclude either\nthat such cases are impossible, or that they involve instrumental\nirrationality.\n4.4 Kant on Hypothetical Imperatives\n\nAn alternative to the narrow instrumentalism associated with Hume is\nfound in the work of Immanuel Kant, who thought that rationality\nrequired us not only to be instrumentally rational, but also to obey\nthe moral law. In his Groundwork for the Metaphysics of\nMorals (1785), Kant distinguishes two kinds of imperatives:\n\nNow all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically.\nThe former represent the practical necessity of a possible action as a\nmeans for attaining something else one wants (or may possibly want).\nThe categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as\nobjectively necessary in itself, without reference to another end.\n(4:414\u2014citations use volume and pages from the Akademie Edition)\n\n\nFor example, \u201cIf you intend to go to law school, take the\nLSAT\u201d would be a hypothetical imperative since it commands an\naction (taking the LSAT) as a means to some end (going to law school).\nIf you didn\u2019t have any ends that would be served by taking the\nLSAT, the command for you to do so would be withdrawn. Categorical\nimperatives, such as \u201cIf someone is drowning nearby, offer\nassistance,\u201d differ in two ways. First, the command to offer\nassistance applies to you regardless of whether offering assistance\nserves any of your (desired or intended) ends. Second, you have a\nreason to offer assistance regardless of whether doing so serves any\nof your (desired or intended) ends. (Philippa Foot has argued that\nthis second feature doesn\u2019t follow from the first: a rule of\netiquette, or a club rule, may apply to you regardless of whether\ncompliance with it serves any of your ends, but you may nonetheless\nhave no reason to comply with it. See Foot 1972.)\n\nBy \u201cone wants\u201d in the passage above, Kant means \u201cone\nwills\u201d: something closer to \u201cone intends\u201d than\n\u201cone desires.\u201d (After all, it wouldn\u2019t be plausible\nto suggest that one is instrumentally irrational in not intending the\nnecessary means to what one merely wants. I want to own a\nBMW, but I don\u2019t intend to work the kind of job that would allow\nme to buy one. But there\u2019s nothing incoherent about my\ncontinuing to desire to own one.) According to Kant:\n\nHow an imperative of skill is possible requires no special discussion.\nWhoever will the end, wills (so far as reason has decisive influence\non his actions) also the means that are indispensably necessary to his\nactions and that lie in his power. This proposition, as far as willing\nis concerned, is analytic. (4:417)\n\n\nBut if Kant\u2019s view is to provide a plausible account of\ninstrumental coherence, it should instead refer to the means\nbelieved to be indispensably necessary, since there is\nnothing incoherent about not willing necessary means of which you are\nunaware, and something incoherent about not willing the means you\nbelieve are necessary, even when they actually aren\u2019t (Korsgaard\n1997, 236).\n\nKant\u2019s parenthetical remark in the passage above is important.\nFor Kant, when one fails to will the necessary means to one\u2019s\nends, then reason has failed to have decisive influence. In other\nwords, one is irrationally incoherent. Less guardedly, Kant says\n\u201cthe proposition (if I fully will the effect, then I will the\naction required of it) is analytic\u201d (4:417). But it is puzzling\nhow this proposition could be analytic. If it were analytic, then it\nwould be conceptually impossible to be instrumentally\nincoherent since whenever one doesn\u2019t will the means, then one\ndoesn\u2019t will the end. (For defense of this conceptual\nimpossibility, see Finlay 2009 and Lee 2022.) And if it\u2019s\nconceptually impossible to be instrumentally incoherent, we\u2019d be\nunable to make sense of why Kant formulates his account of\ninstrumental incoherence in terms of imperatives, which, on\nKant\u2019s view, are commands addressed to a will that is capable of\nboth following and not following the commands (Kant 1785, 4:414; Hill\n1973, 430; Korsgaard 1997, 236). So, perhaps we should read\nKant\u2019s claim as that if one wills the end, rationality\nrequires that one will the means. (For an alternative reading,\nsee Lee 2018.)\n\nEven so, there is a debate over the interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nclaim, particularly about the logical scope of \u201crequires.\u201d\nAccording to the wide-scope interpretation of Kant\u2019s claim, what\nreason requires is that one either will the means or\nnot will the end. In contrast, according the narrow-scope\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s claim, if one wills the end, then what\nreason requires is that one will the means. The wide-scope\ninterpretation posits a disjunctive requirement (that one either not\nwill the end or will the means) that, like Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative, applies to every rational agent, regardless of\nthe particular ends she wills. But it\u2019s hard to square the\nexistence of such a universally applicable requirement with some other\nclaims Kant makes about how hypothetical imperatives are to be\ndistinguished from categorical ones, and how hypothetical imperatives\ncould be derived from an analysis of the concept of willing an end.\n(See Schroeder 2005b. For a defense of the wide-scope interpretation\nagainst Schroeder\u2019s objections, see Rippon 2014. For a related\ndiscussion of these issues, see Schwartz 2008.)\n\nBut the narrow-scope interpretation appears to leave Kant\u2019s view\nvulnerable to \u201cdetachment\u201d objections. Suppose you will\nsome immoral end but, irrationally, don\u2019t will the immoral means\nyou believe necessary to carry out this immoral end. On the\nnarrow-scope interpretation, reason would require that you will the\nimmoral means. But that seems implausible. At the very least, it would\nlead to something Kant wouldn\u2019t accept: reason issuing\ncontradictory commands. Your willing the immoral means would be\nrequired by a hypothetical imperative but forbidden by the categorical\nimperative (Hill 1973, 436).\n\nKant could avoid the detachment problem if he holds, as some\ninterpreters claim, that it is impossible to will (Wille)\nimmoral ends (Schroeder 2005b, \u00a73). If this interpretation is\nright, then reason would never require one to will immoral means. But\nit would also leave Kant without an account of instrumental\nincoherence, at least as we have been understanding it. After all,\nagents can display instrumental incoherence in the pursuit of\nboth moral and immoral ends. To use Kant\u2019s own\nexamples, the doctor who doesn\u2019t intend the means believed\nnecessary to making his patient healthy is instrumentally incoherent\nin the same way as is the poisoner who doesn\u2019t intend the means\nbelieved necessary to kill his victim (4:415). So, this interpretation\nwould have Kant avoiding the detachment objection, but at the cost of\nno longer presenting an account of instrumental incoherence that holds\nregardless of whether the end is reasonable or good.\n\nLet\u2019s now turn to Kant\u2019s explanation of the normative\nauthority of hypothetical imperatives. While Kant presents a\ncomplicated and intricate argument to explain the normative authority\nof the categorical imperative, he claims that hypothetical imperatives\nrequire \u201cno special discussion,\u201d and spends comparatively\nlittle time discussing them (4:417). Kant\u2019s approach\nhere\u2014which might seem to play into the hands of instrumentalists\n(see\n \u00a74.1\n above) who, while skeptical of the rational authority of the\ncategorical imperative, follow Kant in thinking that the authority of\nhypothetical imperatives is obvious and unproblematic\u2014has been\nchallenged. Although the \u201cought\u201d of a hypothetical\nimperative is contingent on an agent\u2019s ends, that\n\u201cought\u201d still needs to be explained. Additionally,\nit\u2019s not clear that a hypothetical \u201cought\u201d is any\nmore compatible with a naturalistic worldview than a categorical one.\nSpecifically, some of the same metaethical challenges that have been\nraised about the status of the categorical \u201cought\u201d could\nbe raised about normative claims in general, including the\nhypothetical \u201cought\u201d (Hampton 1998, Ch. 4; Shafer-Landau\n2006, \u00a76).\n\nSo, what is Kant\u2019s explanation of the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives? According to Korsgaard (1997), Kant\u2019s\nviews changed over the course of his philosophical development.\nKant\u2019s early \u201cdogmatic rationalist\u201d view (evident in\nthe Groundwork) held that we should comply with these\nhypothetical imperatives simply because they express what a perfectly\nrational agent would do. But the mature Kantian view\u2014which\nKorsgaard endorses\u2014explains the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives in terms of the commitments that are\nconstitutive of willing. According to this view, what\u2019s involved\nin willing some end (as opposed to merely desiring it) is\nbeing committed to taking the means to that end. It\u2019s not that\ncomplying with this commitment is constitutive of intention\n(this would render instrumental irrationality conceptually impossible)\nbut that having this commitment is constitutive of intention.\nSo, when one is instrumentally irrational, one fails to live up to\none\u2019s own commitments. Korsgaard writes:\n\n\u2026willing an end just is committing yourself to realizing the\nend. Willing an end, in other words, is an essentially first-personal\nand normative act. To will an end is to give oneself a law, hence, to\ngovern oneself. \u2026 What is constitutive of willing the end is\n\u2026 the inward, volitional act of prescribing the end along with\nthe means it requires to yourself. (Korsgaard 1997, 245)\n\n\nBut is Korsgaard right that willing an end necessarily involves\nprescribing that end to yourself? Korsgaard argues that to\nwill some end, you must at least take that end to be good in some\nsense, and you must also think that there is a reason for pursuing\nthat end (246, 250\u20131). But it seems possible for one to have\nsome akratic end while failing to see anything even pro tanto\ngood about it, or any reason to pursue it (Wallace 2006, \u00a71). And\nit\u2019s clear that one could display instrumental rationality or\nirrationality relative to these akratic ends. So, Korsgaard\u2019s\nview seems unable to explain the authority of instrumental rationality\nwith respect to such ends\u2014ends that an agent has but\ndoesn\u2019t prescribe to herself.\n\nKorsgaard offers a second Kantian explanation of the authority of\ninstrumental rationality. She argues that incessant instrumental\nirrationality threatens one\u2019s status as an agent:\n\nSo the reason that I must conform to the instrumental principle is\nthat if I don\u2019t conform to it, if I always allow myself\nto be derailed by timidity, idleness, or depression, then I never\nreally will an end. The desire to pursue the end and\nthe desires that draw me away from it each hold sway in their turn,\nbut my will is never active. The distinction between my will\nand the operation of the desires and impulses in me does not exist and\nthat means that I, considered as an agent, do not exist. (1997, 247)\n\n\nBut this argument doesn\u2019t provide a reason to conform to the\ninstrumental principle in every case in which the instrumental\nprinciple is applicable. Rather, it provides a reason to do so only\nwhen accompanied by enough other instances of non-conformity to\nthreaten one\u2019s status as an agent (Kolodny 2005, 544; Shaver\n2006, 342). So, like the previous Kantian argument, and like the\nHume\u2019s skepticism discussed in\n \u00a74.3,\n this argument also fails to explain why instrumental rationality\napplies in every case in which it does.\n",
