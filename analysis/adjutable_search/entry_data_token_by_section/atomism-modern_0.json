    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nVersions of atomism developed by seventeenth-century mechanical\nphilosophers, referred to hereafter as mechanical atomism, were\nrevivals of Ancient Greek atomism, with the important difference that\nthey were presumed to apply only to the material world, and not to the\nspiritual world of the mind, the soul, angels and so on. Mechanical\natomism was a totally general theory, insofar as it offered an account\nof the material world in general as made up of nothing other than\natoms in the void. The atoms themselves were characterised in terms of\njust a few basic properties, their shape, size and motion. Atoms were\nchangeless and ultimate, in the sense that they could not be broken\ndown into anything smaller and had no inner structure on which their\nproperties depended. The case made for mechanical atomism was largely\nprior to and independent of empirical investigation.\n\n\nThere were plenty of seventeenth-century versions of atomism that were\nnot mechanical. These tended to be less ambitious in their scope than\nmechanical atomism, and properties were attributed to atoms with an\neye to the explanatory role they were to play. For instance, chemicals\nwere assumed by many to have least parts, natural minima, with those\nminima possessing the capability of combining with the minima of other\nchemicals to form compounds.\n\n\nThe flexibility and explanatory potential of mechanical atomism was\nincreased once Newton had made it possible to include forces in the\nlist of their properties. However, there was no way of specifying\nthose forces by recourse to general philosophical argument and they\nwere remote from what could be established empirically also. Newtonian\natomism was not fruitful as far as eighteenth-century experimental\nscience is concerned.\n\n\nIt was only in the nineteenth century that atomism began to bear\nsignificant fruit in science, with the emergence of atomic chemistry\nand the kinetic theory of gases. The way in which and the point at\nwhich atomic speculations were substantiated or were fruitful is\ncontroversial but by the end of the century the fact that the\nproperties of chemical compounds are due to an atomic structure that\ncan be represented by a structural formulae was beyond dispute. The\nkinetic theory of gases met with impressive empirical success from\n1860 until 1885 at least. However, it also faced\ndifficulties. Further, there was the emergence and success of\nphenomenological thermodynamics, which made it possible to deal with a\nrange of thermal and chemical phenomena without resort to an\nunderlying structure of matter. Atomism was rejected by leading\nscientists and philosophers such as Wilhelm Ostwald, Pierre Duhem and\nErnst Mach up to the end of the nineteenth century and beyond. By that\ntime atomism had been extended from chemistry and the kinetic theory\nto offer explanations in stereochemistry, electro-chemistry,\nspectroscopy and so on. Any opposition from scientists that remained\nwas removed by Jean Perrin's experimental investigations of Brownian\nmotion. However, the task of explaining chemical properties in terms\nof atoms and their structure still remained as a task for twentieth\ncentury science.\n\n\nTwentieth-century atomism in a sense represents the achievement of the\nAncient Greek ideal insofar as it is a theory of the properties of\nmatter in general in terms of basic particles, electrons, protons and\nneutrons, characterised in terms of a few basic properties. The major\ndifference is that the nature of the particles and the laws governing\nthem were arrived at empirically rather than by a priori philosophical\nargument.\n\nSuggested Reading: Melson (1952) is a somewhat dated but\nstill interesting and useful overview of the history of atomism from a\nphilosophical point of view.Chalmers (2009) is a history of atomism\nthat focuses on the relationship between philosophical and scientific\ntheories about atoms.\n",
