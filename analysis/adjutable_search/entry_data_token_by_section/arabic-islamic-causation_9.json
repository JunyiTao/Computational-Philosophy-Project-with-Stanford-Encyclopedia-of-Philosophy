    "main_text": "Knowledge of causal powers || Avicenna on induction and experience\n4.1 Avicenna on induction and experience\n\nAristotelian natural philosophy relies in part on sensory observation\nin its attribution of causal powers to natural bodies. So, it is not\nsurprising that Arabic and Islamic thinkers raise objections to\nAristotelian science, which anticipate later philosophical accounts of\nthe problem of induction. Some of these emerge from within\nAristotelianism. Avicenna provides a sustained critique of induction\n(istiqr\u0101\u02be) in his treatise On\nDemonstration (al-Burh\u0101n), the logical part of the\nBook of Healing. As he sees it, part of the problem is that\ninduction may be supposed to lead to absolute, universal, and certain\npremises, while in reality it leads to merely probable belief. On the\nother hand, he holds that sensory observation together with a\n\u201chidden syllogism\u201d gives rise to certitude. Avicenna\nelaborates this cognitive process under the heading of\n\u201cexperience\u201d (tajribah). Tajribah is the\nArabic translation of the Greek empeiria. Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of experience is derived in part from remarks by Aristotle and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b on empeiria/tajribah,\nthough it goes beyond these sources (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b AMIF:\n24\u201325; McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 66\u201367; McGinnis 2003;\nJanssens 2004; Black 2006).\n\nAs Avicenna describes it, experience involves repeated sensation of\nsome phenomenon that is preserved in memory, e.g., that purging of\nbile follows ingestion of scammony. It also involves a\n\u201chidden\u201d or implicit process of reasoning. We infer that\nthe repeated connection involves an essential relation between two\nthings: e.g., it is not accidental that the purging of bile follows\nthe ingestion of scammony, for regularities cannot be due to chance.\nThis implicit process of reasoning removes doubt. So, experience gives\nrise to certitude. Avicenna defines certitude in terms of second-order\nbelief: one is certain when one knows that what one has assented to\ncannot be otherwise (Black 2013b: 122). Certitude is not wholly\nsubjective, since knowledge of a proposition requires its truth (Black\n2013b: 125). On the other hand, though experience gives rise to\ncertitude, it does not yield knowledge in the strict sense. For\nknowledge in the strict sense is both necessary and\nexplanatory. From experience we derive our certitude that\nmembers of a certain species cause something; but experience does not\nshow why (McGinnis 2003: 320\u20131).\n\nAvicenna also addresses the objection that experience may lead to\nfalse generalizations. He uses the following example. Suppose we had\nseen only black humans and had observed without exception that\nprocreation issues in black children. By experience, we would conclude\nthat all humans are black, i.e., that blackness is essential to\nhumanity. In response to this objection, Avicenna says that knowledge\nderived from experience is conditional,\n\n\nwhich is to say that the character of this thing that is repeatedly\nperceived is necessarily joined to something that holds always in the\ndomain in which the thing is repeatedly perceived, unless there is an\nobstacle. (McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 150)\n\n\nThis point is applied to the example of the Sudanese as follows:\n\n\nwhen procreation is taken to be procreation by black people, or people\nof one such country, then experience will be valid. If procreation is\ntaken to be that of any given people, then experience will not end\nwith the aforementioned particular instances; for that experience\nconcerned a black people, but people absolutely speaking are not\nlimited to black people. (McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 150; McGinnis\n2003: 322\u2013325)\n\n\nSo, in response to the objection that experience could lead to false\ngeneralizations, Avicenna advises that proper use of experience would\ninclude careful attention to the domain of a species, which was\nsubject to repeated observation.\n",
