    "main_text": "Faith and Reason || Reason and religious knowledge\n1.1 Reason and religious knowledge\n\nThe first way that the faith-reason question may be understood\ninvolves the extent, if any, to which the unaided human intellect can\ndiscover the various claims of a religion, whether theological or\nethical. In answer to this question, Muslim philosophers and\ntheologians defended three major positions. One is that unaided human\nreason is sufficient to reach true knowledge about what can (or needs\nto) be known about God and our moral duties. A second position is that\nunaided reason can discover at least the basic claims of a religion,\nlike God exists and is absolutely perfect, but this basic knowledge\nmust be augmented by truths that only a prophet can provide. The third\nposition is that human reason cannot reach the knowledge that religion\nprovides, and so a religious source is required for true knowledge\nabout God and what God demands of us.\n\nA purported representative of the first position is the physician and\nphilosopher Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (865\u2013925; see entry\non\n al-R\u0101z\u012b).\n He is reported to have held that human reason is sufficient to\nunderstand all that is necessary for a devout life, and thus scripture\nis at best superfluous and at worse deceptive and a source of\ndissension (A. H. R\u0101z\u012b Proofs of Prophecy: 2.1 and\n5.1, pp. 24\u20136 & 131\u20134). This is an extreme\n position.[1]\n At the other extreme some Muslim scholars in general dismissed the\nuse of unaided reason in religious matters. There must be religious\nauthority in the form of a prophet who teaches others what they should\nknow about God and who establishes rules that must be observed in\nindividual and social life. Such a position not only dismissed\nindependent reasoning about one\u2019s religion, but also discouraged\nmetaphorical interpretations of sacred writ. Between these extremes,\nMuslim philosophers and theologians believed that while there is a\nplace for unaided reason in acquiring certain religious beliefs, a\nneed for scripture is also essential to that understanding, albeit\nthey disagreed about the nature and extent of that need. Let us begin\nwith the position of most of the Muslim philosophers.\n\nPhilosophers most generally defended the view that at least\nindividuals of sufficient intellect could independently acquire a\nknowledge of all the fundamental claims of religion.They maintained\nthat non-philosophers who constitute the majority of people, in\ncontrast, must rely on religious sources. Those sources, however, the\nphilosophers continue, ultimately agree with what can be rationally\nknown, albeit in a way that describes philosophically correct views in\nmetaphors and symbols so as to be accessible to the masses. One may\ninclude al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 950), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (or\nAvicenna, d. 1037), Ibn \u1e6cufayl (d. 1185) and Ibn Rushd (or\nAverroes, d. 1198) among these philosophers.\n\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b appears to be the originator of the general view\nof the Muslim philosophers (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect\nState: 276\u201385 & al-Milla & b, \u00b6\u00b6\n4\u20136). Humans divided into three classes based on their\nintellectual capacities. One class is persuaded of divine truths\nsolely on the basis of demonstrative proofs. These proofs produce a\nbelief that is certain and are discovered independent of scripture.\nThe second class is persuaded on the basis of dialectical proofs.\nThese proofs produce a belief that is highly probable, and so\nscripture is necessary to confirm the true beliefs and correct any\nfalse ones. The final and the most numerous class consists of those\nwho are easily persuaded by rhetorical proofs involving images that\nhold out threats of torment for non-belief and promises of pleasures\nfor belief. Scripture is of most use for this class, for it provides a\nsimplified version of the religious truths necessary for a devout\nlife, but now put into a language that captures the imagination of\neven the most dull-witted. Thus, F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nposition has two elements:\n\nthe truths relevant to religion can be rationally known, and\nyet\nreligious authority is also needed, albeit not by all.\n\n\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s view can be found in Ibn\n\u1e6cufayl\u2019s philosophical novel \u1e24ayy ibn\nYaq\u1e93\u0101n (HIY, especially 161\u20135). The novel\nrelates the story of a child raised by a deer on a desert island, and\nwhat he was able to learn through unaided reason, and then his\nsubsequent encounter with a religious community. The story concludes\nwith the protagonist resigning himself to the fact that some people do\nnot want to be intellectually challenged. Ibn Rushd also endorses\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s tripartite division of humanity in his\nlegal treatise, The Decisive Treatise (Ibn Rushd\nDecisive: 1\u201312, esp. 8).\n\nSome theologians gave a similar, but different, answer to this\nquestion. They asked whether one who is mentally sound and has reached\nthe age of discernment is accountable before God for their religious\nbeliefs and practices, even if they have never heard the message of\nIslam. Answering this question, the Mu\u02bftazilite theologian,\nal-Q\u0101d\u012b \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r (d. 1025) and Ab\u016b\nMan\u1e63\u016br al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b (d. 944), the eponymous\nfounder of the M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b school of theology, held that\nindividuals at the age of discernment are responsible in believing,\nfor example, that God exists, that God is just, that God sends\nmessengers, that there is life after death and that one should lead a\nmorally good life (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 62\u20138,\n122\u20134, 563\u20136 and M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 3\u20137,\n156\u201362; also see Hourani 1971: 129\u201339). A common position\namong later M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b and Ash\u02bfar\u012b theologians\nslightly modified this view: In addition to the fundamental truths\nabout God and his relation to the world just mentioned, human reason\ncan verify that Muhammad was a genuine prophet. Having verified\nMuhammad\u2019s prophecy, one now can go on to endorse all the claims\nrevealed in the Qur\u2019an, which is different than merely\n\u2018believing by faith\u2019 (taql\u012bd) since the\nacceptance of the Quranic claims are grounded in an initial proof for\nthe veracity of the Qur\u2019an as a revelatory source of knowledge\n(Nasaf\u012b TA: II 12\u201328; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n165\u20137; Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, treatises\n3\u20134; also see Frank 1989).\n",
