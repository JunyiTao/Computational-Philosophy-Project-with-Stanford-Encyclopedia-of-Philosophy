    "main_text": "Four Forms of Recognition || Love and Friendship\n2.4 Love and Friendship\n\n\nRelationships of loving care are deemed important within\npsychologically oriented recognition theories (Benjamin 1988, Honneth\n1992) because such emotionally fulfilling interactions are supposed to\ndisplay the first form of recognition humans experience. The\nunconditional care by a parent provides the baby with the feeling of\nsecurity and of being loved, and thus of being worthy of love. This world-\nand self-trust is taken to later enable the child to value her own\nprojects and align the role standards that grow increasingly more\ncomplicated in the course of her development and to critically question\nthem (Mead 1934, Habermas 1988). Most of those who endorse the\nrelevance of love also stress the importance of the affective\ndimension for all subsequent forms of recognition (Honneth 2014, ch. 6.1).\n\n\nFollowing the idea that recognition should always affirm certain\naspects of the other person, there has been some controversy about what\nexactly we recognize in other persons when we love them or regard them\nas friends. After all, we seem to embrace them in their entire (and\nchanging) personality and could not just replace them with others who\nmay have similar characteristics. Whereas some think that we still\nrespond to some valuable trait, namely the autonomous core of the loved\none\u2019s personality (Velleman 1999, 366\u2013374), others think that the\nrelationship itself creates a value that is worth caring for (Frankfurt\n2004).\n\n\nFurthermore, as love embraces the entire\npersonality of individuals it has been proposed that it is this\nexperience, anchored in early childhood, that provides subjects with a\npermanent motivational resource for demanding recognition for ever more\naspects of their identity, and thus for further moral progress. This\nmay, of course, in its extreme form of desiring to be recognized in all\none\u2019s features by all persons be a mere utopia (along these lines\nHonneth 2002, 504). Theories such as those of Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas\n(1961, section III) or Jacques Derrida (1990, 959) depict concrete\nothers as demanding an infinite sensibility and care toward them.\nAlthough we often have to relativize these \u201cdemands\u201d in\nlight of competing claims of others and for reasons of\noverdemandingness (Forst 2011, 36\u201337), these theories generally point\nto the possibility of having to redraw the boundaries between different\nspheres of recognition. This could, for example, lead to a revised\nunderstanding of solidarity being not only a task of families or close\nfriends but of entire societies, namely in the form of a welfare\nstate.\n\n\nAlthough politics might not be directly responsible for\nthis form of recognizing concrete individuality, there are nevertheless\nindirect possibilities to protect and to shape its basic conditions. By\nmeans of effective law enforcement politics assures the individual that\nthe trust (in one\u2019s environment as well as one\u2019s own body),\nacquired in intimate relations since childhood (see Taylor 1992, 36\u201337),\nis not forcibly destroyed from the outside, e.g., by maltreatment,\ntorture or rape (some, as Owen 2007, 308, even mention natural\ndisasters although these catastrophes do not damage interpersonal\ntrust). Additionally, some of the social conditions that make it more\nchallenging to succeed in intimate relations can be improved\npolitically. This is, for example, valid for inflexible or very long\nworking hours for parents and bad child care offers, for demands of\nhigh mobility which endanger intimate relationships, or for the\ncultural patterns that devalue reciprocity between partners, e.g., by\nfavoring negligence and recklessness as \u201cmasculine.\u201d\n",
