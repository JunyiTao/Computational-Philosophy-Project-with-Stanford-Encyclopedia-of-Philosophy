Newton considered a\npair of identical spheres, connected by a cord, too far from any\nbodies to observe any relative motions; he pointed out that their rate\nand direction of rotation could still be experimentally determined by\nmeasuring the tension in the cord, and by pushing on opposite faces of\nthe two globes to see whether the tension increased or decreased. He\nintended this simple example to demonstrate that the project he\nintended in the Principia, of determining the absolute\naccelerations and hence gravitational forces on the planets from their\nrelative motions, was possible. However, if we further specify that\nthe spheres and cord are rigid and that they are the only\nthings in their universe, then the example can be used to point out\nthat there are infinitely many different rates of rotation all of\nwhich agree on the relations between bodies. Since there are no\ndifferences in the relations between bodies in the different\nsituations, it follows that the observable differences\nbetween the states of rotation cannot be explained in terms of the\nrelations between bodies. Therefore, a theory of the kind attributed\nto the folk\u2019s Leibniz cannot explain all the phenomena of\nNewtonian mechanics, and again we can argue abductively for absolute\n space.[13]\n\nThis argument is not Newton\u2019s, neither the premises nor\nconclusion, and must not be taken as a historically accurate reading,\nHowever, that is not to say that the argument is fallacious, and\nindeed many have found it attractive, particularly as a defense not of\nNewton\u2019s absolute space, but of Galilean spacetime. That is,\nNewtonian mechanics with Galilean spacetime can explain the phenomena\nassociated with rotation, while theories of the kind proposed by Mach\ncannot explain the differences between situations allowed by Newtonian\nmechanics; but these explanations rely on the geometric structure of\nGalilean spacetime \u2013 particularly its affine connection, to\ninterpret acceleration. And thus \u2013 the argument goes \u2013\nthose explanations commit us to the reality of spacetime: a manifold\nof points whose properties include the appropriate geometric ones.\nThis final doctrine, of the reality of spacetime with its component\npoints or regions, distinct from matter, with geometric properties, is\nwhat we earlier identified as \u2018substantivalism\u2019.\n7.3.2 Relationist Responses\n\nThere are two points to make about this line of argument. First, the\nrelationist could reply that they need not explain all situations\nwhich are possible according to Newtonian mechanics, because that\ntheory is to be rejected in favor of one which invokes only distance\nand time relations between bodies, but which approximates to\nNewton\u2019s if matter is distributed suitably. Such a relationist\nwould be following Mach\u2019s proposal, which we will discuss in the\nsequel article. Such a position would be satisfactory only to the\nextent that a suitable concrete replacement theory to Newton\u2019s\ntheory is developed; Mach never offered such a theory, but recently\nmore progress has been made (again, see the companion article for\ndiscussion).\n\nSecond, one must be careful in understanding just how the argument\nworks, for it is tempting to gloss it by saying that in Newtonian\nmechanics the affine connection is a crucial part of the explanation\nof the surface of the water in the bucket, and if the spacetime which\ncarries the connection is denied, then the explanation fails too. But\nthis gloss tacitly assumes that Newtonian mechanics can only be\nunderstood in a substantial Galilean spacetime; if an interpretation\nof Newtonian mechanics that does not assume substantivalism can be\nconstructed, then all Newtonian explanations can be given without\npostulating a connection in an ontologically significant sense. Both\nSklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1970) have made proposals along these\nlines.\n\nSklar proposes interpreting \u2018true\u2019 acceleration as a\nprimitive quantity not defined in terms of motion relative to\nanything, be it absolute space, a connection or other bodies. (Ray\n1991 points out the family resemblance between this proposal and\nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion that vis viva addresses\nNewton\u2019s Scholium arguments.) Van Fraassen proposes\nformulating mechanics as \u2018Newton\u2019s Laws hold in\nsome frame\u2019, so that the form of the laws and the\ncontingent relative motions of bodies \u2013 not absolute space or a\nconnection, or even any instantaneous relations \u2013 pick out a\nstandard of true motion, namely with respect to such an\n\u2018inertial frame\u2019. These proposals aim to keep the full\nexplanatory resources of Newtonian mechanics, and hence admit\n\u2018true acceleration\u2019, but deny any relations between bodies\nand spacetime itself. Like the actual Leibniz, they allow absolute\nquantities of motion, but claim that space and time themselves are\nnothing but the relations between bodies.\n\nSome may question how the laws can be such as to privilege frames\nwithout prior spacetime geometry. In reply, Huggett 2006 proposes that\nthe laws be understood as a Humean \u2018best system\u2019 (see the\nentry on\n laws of nature)\n for a world of bodies and their relations; the laws don\u2019t\nreflect prior geometric structure, but systematic regularities in\npatterns of relative motions. For obvious reasons, this proposal is\ncalled \u2018regularity relationism\u2019. (Several authors have\ndeveloped a similar approach to a variety of physical theories: for\ninstance, Vassallo & Esfeld 2016.) This approach is committed to\nthe idea that in some sense Newton\u2019s laws are capable of\nexplaining all the phenomena without recourse to spacetime geometry;\nthat the connection and the metrical properties are explanatorily\nredundant. This idea is also at the core of the \u2018Dynamical\nApproach\u2019, discussed in the companion article.\n\nAnother approach is to consider fully spatiotemporal relations. For\ninstance, Maudlin 1993 discusses the possibility of a \u2018Newtonian\nrelationism\u2019 which adds cross-temporal distance\nrelations, i.e., distances between bodies at distinct moments of time.\nWith such distances, relationists can capture (almost) the full\nstructure of Newtonian space, and time, including the affine structure\nrequired for Newton\u2019s first and second laws.\n",
