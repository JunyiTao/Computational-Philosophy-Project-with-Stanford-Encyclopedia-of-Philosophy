Epistemic issues I: Representing cells\n\nWe turn now from questions about the ontological status of cells to\nepistemic questions about how scientists study them. We begin with how\nscientists represent cells and information about them. Traditionally,\nphilosophy of science has focused on linguistic representations of\nscientific knowledge. But in many fields of biology and especially in\ncell biology, information is often presented in images.\nScientists\u2019 very familiarity with cells results from visual\nrepresentations generated using microscopes. Developing microscopes\nand techniques for using them to produce interpretable images\npresented a number of challenges. We begin in section 4.1 with the\nchallenges in generating images (micrographs) at all and in section\n4.2 consider challenges in evaluating the reliability of the resulting\nimages. Beyond these replete (highly detailed) representations, cell\nbiologists rely on a variety of less replete diagrams. (The\ncharacterization of images as \u201creplete\u201d is due to Perini,\n2013. Drawing on Goodman, she uses relative repleteness to\ndifferentiate diagrams from pictures.) In particular, as discussed in\n section 4.3,\n when they are developing mechanistic hypotheses about cells, cell\nbiologists rely on cell diagrams that represent types of cell\ncomponents and mechanism diagrams that represent select components\nwithin cells that are hypothesized to constitute parts of the\nmechanism responsible for a given phenomenon (Downes 1992).\n",
