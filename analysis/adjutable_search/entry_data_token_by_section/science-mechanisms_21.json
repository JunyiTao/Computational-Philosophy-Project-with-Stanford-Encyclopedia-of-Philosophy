In\nintegrating their results, scientists are not simply building theories\nsimpliciter; they are building theories about mechanisms. Mechanisms\ncan perhaps be described using formal accounts of\ntheories\u2014perhaps they can be axiomatized in predicate logic or\nreconstructed as set theoretic predicates. But such formal accounts of\nthe structures of scientific theories gloss over the mechanistic\nstructures crucial for understanding how these theories are\nconstructed and evaluated (Craver 2001b).\nMechanists also challenge the idea that disciplines are related by\nway of the relationship between their theories. Darden and\nMaull (1977) argued that disciplinary fields often integrate their\nfindings through the construction of interfield theories, appealing to\ndiverse material relationships between items in the different\nfields\u2019 domains: relations such as cause and effect, part and\nwhole, or structure and function. Darden and Maull did not offer a\ngeneral account of interfield theories, but Bechtel presciently\nsuggested that such theories often take the form of descriptions of\nmechanisms (Bechtel 1988: 101\u2013102).\nThe mechanistic approach also has been claimed to have many\nadvantages over reduction for thinking about interlevel forms of\ninterdisciplinary integration. First, it provides a straightforward\nway to interpret the talk of levels (see\nSections 2.4.5  and 4.2). Second, it offers\nsignificantly more insight into what interlevel integration is, into\nthe evidential constraints by which interlevel bridges are evaluated,\nand into the forces driving the co-evolution of work at different\nlevels. Constraints on the parts, their causal interactions, and their\nspatial, temporal, and hierarchical organization all help to flesh out\nan interlevel integration. Finally, mechanists repeatedly recognize\nthe need to not only look down to the constitutive mechanisms\nresponsible for a given phenomenon (emphasized by classical reduction\nmodels), but also to look up and around to the context within which\nthe phenomenon is embedded: interlevel integration is an effort to see\nhow phenomena at many different levels are related to one another\n(Bechtel 2009a; Craver 2007).\nMechanists have developed several extended examples of the many\nforms of mechanism integration pursued in mechanistic research\nprograms. Darden (2005), for example, suggests that philosophers in\nthe grip of classical reduction fundamentally misunderstood the\nrelationship between Mendelian and molecular genetics. While\nreductionists see it as an instance of interlevel explanation, she\nargues, it is in fact a case in which different scientists worked on\ndifferent parts of a mechanism that are etiologically (not\nconstitutively) related to one another. Mendelian genetics did not\nreduce to molecular biology; rather, classical geneticists and\nmolecular biologists integrated their work by focusing on different\nworking entities in the sequentially operating chromosomal and\nmolecular hereditary mechanisms. Examples have also been drawn from\nthe discovery of the mechanisms of protein synthesis (Darden 2006) and\ncell biology (Bechtel 2006). Craver (2007) uses examples from\nthe neuroscience of memory to explore how multilevel integration does\nand ought to proceed. In each case, the search for mechanisms serves\nas an abstract scaffold onto and around which the findings of diverse\nscientists converge.\n5.2.1 Integrative Pluralism\nThe mechanistic perspective tends to emphasize integrative\npluralism in scientific research (Mitchell 2003, 2009). The goal is\nnot to explain the less fundamental in terms of the more fundamental\nin a step-wise relating of monolithic theories at one level to\nmonolithic theories at another. Rather, such scientific achievements\nare collaborative and piecemeal, adding incremental constraints to an\nemerging picture of how a mechanism works both at a level and across\nlevels. The many scientific disciplines that investigate a phenomenon\npluralistically co-exist and co-inform one another by integratively\ncontributing to the etiological, constitutive, and contextual\nmechanistic explanations of that phenomenon (Bechtel\n2009a; Tabery 2014a).\n5.3 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nThe Nagel model of theory reduction offers a clear vision of the\n\u201cunity of science\u201d\n(see the entry on unity of science).\nAccording to the model, the unity among scientific disciplines is\nachieved by reducing theories of higher-level disciplines to the\ntheories of lower-level disciplines. Integration, on that vision, is\nunderstood as progress toward a grand, unified body of scientific\nknowledge. For mechanists, in contrast, integration is piecemeal,\nlocal, and pluralistic. What sort of unity could such an\n\u201cintegration\u201d sustain? This question plays out in a\nback-and-forth between Longino and Tabery concerning disciplinary\nrelationships in the behavioral sciences. Tabery argues that\ndisciplines as disparate as neurobiology and quantitative genetics\ncould pluralistically co-exist and co-inform one another\u2019s causal\nexplanations of complex behaviors by way of mechanism integration.\nLongino counters that Tabery\u2019s pluralism is only a\n\u201cmoderate\u201d sort because the push for integration\nultimately is a push for unification (Longino 2013, 2014; Tabery\n2014a,b).  Sullivan (2009) also challenges the push for mechanism\nintegration; she argues that there are significant barriers to the\nkind of integration mechanists envision. Different laboratories use\ndifferent experimental protocols to study what they assume to be the\nsame phenomenon; however, these different protocols often in fact\ntarget different phenomena, so the integration achieved by combining\nresults is only illusory. These discussions are symptomatic of more\ngeneral philosophical questions faced by mechanists: How are mechanism\nintegrations actually achieved (as opposed to just asserted)? And what\nis the relationship between mechanism integration and unification? The\nnew mechanical philosophy stands to benefit from future efforts to\nsituate mechanistic integration into more general philosophical views\nof integration and pluralism.\n6. Discovery: From A-ha Moments to Discovery Strategies\n6.1 Discovery via A-ha Moments\nWhat can philosophers say about scientific discovery? Many logical\nempiricists had a simple answer: Nothing. According to Popper, for\nexample, philosophers can illuminate the epistemology of testing, but\nthey can say nothing of substance about how scientists generate the\nideas to be tested (Popper 1959). Such \u201cA-ha!\u201d moments of\ncreativity are in the province of psychology, not philosophy.\nReichenbach distinguished the context of discovery from the context of\njustification (the \u201ccontext distinction\u201d) (Reichenbach\n1938; but see the entry on \n Hans Reichenbach for an alternate\n interpretation of this\ndistinction). The process of scientific discovery was thus largely off\nlimits to philosophers.\nNot all philosophers of science agreed. Hanson, for example,\narticulated a logic of discovery involving abductive inferences from\nanomalous data to new hypotheses designed to account for them (Hanson\n1958). Others focused on methodologies of discovery that could either\nallow one to rationally reconstruct why something was discoverable at\na given time (Nickels 1985) or to explain why a new hypothesis is\nconsidered promising and worthy of further investigation (Schaffner\n1993). Early contributions to the new mechanical philosophy followed\nthis path and characterized investigative strategies scientists use to\ndiscover mechanisms (see the entry on \n scientific discovery).\n6.2 Discovery via Strategies\nBechtel and Richardson\u2019s Discovering Complexity (2010\n[1993]) is organized around a flowchart representing choice-points in\nthe discovery of a mechanism. The process of searching for mechanisms\nbegins with a provisional characterization of the phenomenon. Then\nfollow strategies of localizing the mechanism within the\nsystem, and decomposing the phenomenon into distinct\nsub-functions. Localization of function involves determining which of\nthese sub-functions of the system is performed by which parts. Bechtel\nand Richardson further characterize the use of excitatory and\ninhibitory experiments to obtain these kinds of information. Bechtel\nand Abrahamsen (2013) add a subsequent stage, in which\nscientists recompose what they have learned about the\nfunctional parts by putting them back together to produce the\nphenomenon in question (perhaps using simulations). \nDarden also emphasized mechanisms as an important framework concept\nin scientific discovery (Darden 1980, 1982, 1986, 1991). In the\ndiscovery of protein synthesis (jointly investigated by molecular\nbiologists and biochemists in the 1950s and 1960s), scientists didn\u2019t\nsimply have an \u201cA-ha\u201d moment. Rather, they deployed\nstrategies for revealing how a mechanism works (Darden 2006; Craver\nand Darden 2013). Darden characterizes the process of mechanism\ndiscovery as an \u201cextended, piecemeal process with hypotheses\nundergoing iterative refinement\u201d; that process occurs via the\nconstruction, evaluation, and revision of mechanism schemas in light\nof observational and experimental constraints (Darden 2006: 272).\nDarden\u2019s construction strategies are strategies for generating new\nhypotheses about a mechanism. In addition to decomposition and\nlocalization, Darden shows that scientists often borrow a schema\ntype from another area of science, as when selection-type\nmechanisms were borrowed to understand how the immune system works, or\nassemble a mechanism from known modules of functional activity\n(modular sub-assembly), as is common in biochemistry and\nmolecular biology. Sometimes, scientists know one part of the\nmechanism and attempt to work forward or backward through to the other\nparts and activities. In the discovery of the mechanism of protein\nsynthesis, for example, molecular biologists worked forward from the\nstructure of DNA to figure out what molecules could interact with it\n(forward chaining), and biochemists worked backward from\nproteins to figure out what chemical reactions would be necessary to\ncreate them (backward chaining). They met in the middle at\nRNA. Protein synthesis is now understood to involve transcribing DNA\ninto RNA and then translating RNA into proteins. Far from being\nphilosophically inscrutable, Darden points out that scientists used\nwhat they knew about the working entities and activities in the\nmechanism to infer what could come next or before in the mechanism of\nprotein synthesis (Darden 2006; see\nalso the entry on \nmolecular biology).\nEvaluation strategies, for Darden, involve constraint-based\nreasoning to limn the contours of the space of possible\nmechanisms for a given phenomenon. Often scientists reason about how a\nmechanism works by building off basic findings concerning the spatial\nand temporal organization of its parts. Harvey, for example, reasoned\nhis way to the circulation of the blood by considering the locations\nof the valves of the veins and their orientation with respect to the\nheart. These organizational constraints, and many others, combined to\nnarrow the space of possible mechanisms to a small region containing a\nmodel in which the blood completes a circuit of the body (Craver and\nDarden 2013).\nDarden and Craver also discuss experimental strategies for learning\nhow a mechanism works. These strategies reveal how different entities\nand activities in a mechanism act, interact, and are organized\ntogether. For example, one might intervene to remove a putative\ncomponent to see if and how the mechanism functions in its absence\n(inhibitory experiments). Or one might stimulate\nthat component to see if it can drive the mechanism or modulate its\nbehavior. Or one might activate a mechanism by placing it in\nthe precipitating conditions for the phenomenon and observe how the\nentity or activity changes as the mechanism works. Craver (2002)\ndiscusses these under the heading of \u201cinterlevel\nexperiments\u201d (see also Harinen forthcoming). \nCraver and Darden (2013) also discuss more complex\nkinds of experiments for learning what sort of entity or activity\ncontributes to a process and for learning more complex features of a\nmechanism\u2019s organization.\nDatteri (2009; Datteri and Tamburrini 2007), explores the use of\nrobotic simulations for the purposes of testing mechanisms. They\ndiscuss both how assumptions are built into robotic models and how\nexperiments can be designed to reveal how mechanisms work. This work\nextends the mechanistic framework into the area of bio-robotics and\nreveals a set of strategies distinct from those explored in Darden\u2019s\nwork.\nRather than focusing on the process by which mechanism schemas are\nconstructed, evaluated, and revised, Steele focuses on the question of\nhow one extrapolates from a sample population or a model organism to\nthe structure of a mechanism in the target. Will a treatment proven to\nsuppress tumors in mice (a model organism) also suppress tumors in\nhumans (the target population)? After developing a probabilistic\naccount of mechanisms, Steele considers how researchers get around\nwhat he calls the extrapolator\u2019s circle: determining\n\nhow we could know that the model and the target are\nsimilar in causally relevant respects without already knowing the\ncausal relationship in the target. (Steel 2008: 78)\n\n Steel breaks the extrapolator\u2019s circle by\ndeveloping a mechanisms-based extrapolation strategy\u2014the\nstrategy of comparative process tracing. Once a mechanism for\nsome phenomenon has been elucidated in a model (such as a particular\nprocess of carcinogenesis in rats), scientists (toxicologists in this\ncase) then compare key stages (particularly downstream stages) of the\nmodel with the stages in the target, paying particular attention to\npoints in the process where differences are most likely to arise. The\ngreater the similarities of the entities, activities, and organization\nof the mechanisms in both populations, the stronger is the basis for\nextrapolation; the greater the differences, the weaker the basis (but\nsee Howick et al. 2013; see also the sections on extrapolation in the\nentries on\n molecular biology\nand\n experiment in biology).\n6.3 Mechanistic Evidence in Medical Discoveries\nDiscovery in medicine is another domain where the mechanical\nphilosophy has been applied. Thagard draws on the case of H.\npylori as a cause of ulcers to provide an account of how\ninvestigating mechanisms contributes to scientific discovery.\nThagard draws attention to both statistical evidence that suggests\nulcers are somehow associated with H. pylori, as well as\nmechanistic evidence that can explain how the agent of infection could\npersist in a hostile environment long enough to cause an ulcer. More\nrecently, philosophers interested in evidence-based medicine have\nprobed the relationship between these two types of evidence in the\nhealth sciences. Russo and Williamson argue that both types of\nevidence are necessary to justify causal inference; the correlational\nevidence establishes that there is a difference-making relation\nbetween some cause and some effect, while the mechanistic evidence\nestablishes how exactly the cause produces its effect\u2014the\n\u201cRusso-Williamson Thesis\u201d (Russo and Williamson\n2007). Philosophers have since refined the Russo-Williamson Thesis,\npointing out, for instance, that \u201ctype of evidence\u201d could\nrefer to different methodologies for gathering evidence or to\ndifferent objects of evidence.  Difference-making methodologies\ninclude observational studies and randomized controlled trials, while\nmechanistic methodologies include interventionist experiments such as\nthose described above; likewise, the object of evidence could be the\nevidence of an associated difference or it could be the evidence\nconcerning the mechanism linking the cause and effect (Illari 2011;\nsee also Campaner 2011).  Evidence-based medicine hierarchies, which\nrank different kinds of evidence in terms of its epistemic strength,\ntend to prioritize evidence from difference-making methodologies (such\nas randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) over mechanistic\nevidence; in reply, these philosophers argue that the different types\nof evidence are on a par (each with its own strengths and weaknesses)\nand advocate for integrating difference-making and mechanistic\nevidence, a sentiment which aligns with the emphasis on mechanism\nintegration discussed in Section 5.2 above\n(Clarke et al. 2013, 2014). \n6.4 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nMany mechanists have explored the strategies that scientists use in\ndiscovery. Bechtel and Richardson attended to decomposition and\nlocalization; Darden and Craver highlighted forward and backward\nchaining; Russo and Williamson emphasized drawing on both\ndifference-making and mechanistic evidence. These strategies were\nfound in specific, experimental sciences, such as neuroscience and\nmolecular biology. So one task for philosophers moving forward is to\nassess whether or not similar strategies exist in other sciences,\nespecially those that operate outside the traditional laboratory, both\nin the human sciences (such as sociology and economics) and in the\nphysical sciences (such as cosmology).\nWe also expect tremendous development to come from bridging the gap\nbetween the qualitative accounts of mechanisms and mechanistic\nexplanation developed in the new mechanism and quantitative theories\nof discovery from the discipline of machine learning and causal\nmodeling (Spirtes et al. 2000; Pearl 2009). The latter offer tools to\nmine correlational data for causal dependencies. Such tools might\nescape more qualitative, historical approaches and might, in fact, go\nbeyond the common strategies that scientists traditionally use. Such\ntools also offer a means to assess discovery strategies by exploring\nthe conditions under which they succeed and fail and the efficiency\nwith which they deliver verdicts on causal hypotheses.\n7. Conclusion\nThe new mechanical philosophy and, more generally, attention to the\nframework concept of \u201cmechanism\u201d has expanded rapidly over\nthe last two decades bringing with it new orientations toward a wide\nrange of issues in the philosophy of science. Yet it is clear that\nmany of the major topics are only beginning to develop, leaving a lot\nof work for scholars to elaborate the basic commitments of this\nframework and to consider what it means to do science outside of that\nframework.  The near future is likely to see continued discussion of\nthe implications and limits of this framework for thinking about\nscience and scientific practice.",
