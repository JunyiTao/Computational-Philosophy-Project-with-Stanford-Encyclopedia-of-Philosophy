    "main_text": "Conjectural history and moral psychology || Morality\n2.1 Morality\n\nAmour de soi, amour propre and piti\u00e9\nare not the full complement of passions in Rousseau\u2019s thinking.\nOnce people have achieved consciousness of themselves as social\nbeings, morality also becomes possible and this relies on the further\nfaculty of conscience. The fullest accounts of Rousseau\u2019s\nconception of morality are found in the Lettres Morales and\nin sections of the Confession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,\na part of Emile. In the most primitive forms of human\nexistence, before the emergence of amour propre,\npiti\u00e9 balances or restrains self-interest. It is, to\nthat extent, akin to a moral sentiment such as Humean sympathy. But as\nsomething that is merely instinctual it lacks, for Rousseau, a\ngenuinely moral quality. Genuine morality, on the other hand, consists\nin the application of reason to human affairs and conduct. This\nrequires the mental faculty that is the source of genuinely moral\nmotivation, namely conscience. Conscience impels us to the\nlove of justice and morality in a quasi-aesthetic manner. As the\nappreciation of justice and the desire to act to further it,\nconscience is based in a sentiment of love for the well-orderedness of\na benign God\u2019s plan for the world. However, in a world dominated\nby inflamed amour propre, the normal pattern is not for a\nmorality of reason to supplement or supplant our natural proto-moral\nsympathies. Instead, the usual course of events in civil society is\nfor reason and sympathy to be displaced while humans\u2019 enhanced\ncapacity for reasoning is put at the service, not of morality, but of\nthe impulse to dominate, oppress and exploit. (For recent discussion\nof Rousseau on conscience and reason, see Neidleman, 2017, ch. 7.)\n\nA theme of both the Discourse on Inequality and the\nLetter to d\u2019Alembert is the way in which human beings\ncan deceive themselves about their own moral qualities. So, for\nexample, theatre audiences derive enjoyment from the eliciting of\ntheir natural compassion by a tragic scene on the stage; then,\nconvinced of their natural goodness, they are freed to act viciously\noutside the theater. Philosophy, too, can serve as a resource for\nself-deception. It can give people reasons to ignore the promptings of\npiti\u00e9 or, as in Rousseau\u2019s essay Principles\nof the Right of War, it can underpin legal codes (such as the law\nof war and peace) that the powerful may use to license oppressive\nviolence whilst deadening their natural feelings of compassion.\n",
