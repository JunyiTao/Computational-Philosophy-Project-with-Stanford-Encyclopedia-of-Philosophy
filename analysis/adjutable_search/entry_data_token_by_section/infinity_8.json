These limits are the first\ninfinite operation that we define on numbers.\n3.2.1 Limits of sequences\n\nA sequence of numbers is an ordered list of numbers, which we\nmay symbolize: \n\\[a_1, a_2, \\dots\\]\n\n\nor \n\\[\\langle a_n\\rangle.\\]\n\n\nThe members of a sequence are indexed by the natural numbers, \\(n=1,\n2, \\dots\\).\n\nThe formal definition of a limit says the sequence \\(\\langle\na_n\\rangle\\) converges to \\(l\\), or has limit \\(l\\)\nif and only if the terms of the sequence eventually stay arbitrarily\nclose to \\(l\\). Formally: \n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n=l\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor each real number \\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a natural number\n\\(N\\), such that for every natural number \\(n>N\\),\n\\(|a_n-l|<\\epsilon\\).\n\n\nWe will say a bit more about the symbol \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019 that\nappears in this definition later, but for now it just indicates the\nbehavior of the sequence beyond any particular finite point.\n\nAs we will demonstrate shortly, not every sequence has a limit, but we\ncan define an important class of sequences that do. A sequence is\nincreasing if each term in the sequence is at least as large\nas the previous term. A sequence is bounded if there is some\nreal number that is larger than every term in the sequence. It turns\nout that every bounded, increasing sequence has a limit. The\nsuccessive approximations to the measurement of some physical quantity\nwith a finer and finer measuring unit will amount to a bounded,\nincreasing sequence of numbers, and thus this definition of a limit\nallows us to give a numerical representation of any physical\nquantity.\n\nTo show that every bounded, increasing sequence has a limit, consider\nthe Dedekind cuts defining the individual real numbers in the\nsequence. Let us define a new Dedekind cut by taking its left set to\ncontain every rational in the left set of at least one of these terms\nof the sequence, and taking its right set to contain every rational\nthat is in all of the right sets of these terms. Because the\nsequence is bounded, we know that the right set is non-empty, and the\nrest of the properties of a Dedekind cut are not hard to check.\n\nIt is not hard to check that the real number constructed in this way\nis the limit of the sequence. To see how this works in a specific\ncase, we can consider the sequence \\(1/2, 3/4, 7/8, \\dots, 1-1/2^n,\n\\dots\\) This sequence is increasing, since each term is greater than\nthe one that came before, and it is bounded, since 2 is a number that\nis strictly greater than every term in the sequence. The Dedekind cut\nconstructed as above will correspond to the number 1. To see this,\nnote that for any rational number q less than 1, we can let\n\\(\\epsilon=1-q\\). Then there is some \\(N\\) such that\n\\(1/2^N<\\epsilon\\). The \\(N\\)th term in the sequence will then be\ngreater than \\(q\\), so \\(q\\) will be in its left set, and thus in the\nleft set we constructed above. But 1 itself, and every rational number\ngreater than it, are all in the right set constructed above. This\nreasoning also shows that the sequence converges to 1 according to the\ndefinition of a limit. For any \\(\\epsilon\\), and an \\(N\\) such that\n\\(1/2^N<\\epsilon\\), the \\(N\\)th term in the sequence is within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of 1, and all later terms of the sequence are greater\nthan the \\(N\\)th term, but still less than 1, so they must also all be\nwithin \\(\\epsilon\\) of 1.\n\nThis fact about bounded, increasing sequences also underlies the use\nof infinite decimal notation for real numbers. When we say that the\nnumber \\(\\pi=3.1415926\\dots\\), we just mean that \\(\\pi\\) is the limit\nof the sequence \\(3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, \\dots\\). One fact about this\nnotation that many people find surprising is that the decimal notation\n\\(0.99999\\dots\\) is the limit of the sequence \\(.9, .99, .999,\n\\dots\\), and thus is precisely 1. Some people feel the intuition that\n\\(0.9999\\dots\\) should somehow denote a number \u2018infinitely\nclose\u2019 to 1, but not equal to it. We will be able to make sense\nof an idea like this in section\n 3.4,\n but it turns out that decimal notation is not the way to do it. For a\nuseful demonstration of this point, see Vi Hart\u2019s video\n 9.999... reasons that .999... = 1.\n\nMany sequences that are not increasing have limits as well. For\ninstance, the sequence \\(1, -1/2, 1/3, -1/4, \\dots, (-1)^n/n, \\dots\\)\ncan be seen to converge to the value 0, even though it is not\nincreasing. However, if a sequence is not bounded, like the sequence\n\\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\), it does not have a limit\u2014if it had a limit,\nthere would have to be some values \\(l\\), \\(\\epsilon\\), and \\(N\\),\nsuch that all terms in the sequence beyond the first \\(N\\) are within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(l\\). But then any number that is larger than the\nfirst \\(N\\) terms of the sequence, and also larger than\n\\(l+\\epsilon\\), would be a bound for the sequence. And some sequences\nthat are not increasing also fail to have a limit\u2014for instance,\nthe sequence \\(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots\\) does not have a limit,\nbecause there is no value such that all terms of the sequence are\neventually within \\(1/3\\) of that value.\n3.2.2 Infinite sums and products\n\nWith the definition of the limit of a sequence, we can now also often\ndefine infinitary versions of the operations of addition and\nmultiplication. For a finite number of terms, we define the\n\u2018partial sum\u2019 \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=a_1+\\dots+a_n\\) and\n\u2018partial product\u2019 \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i=a_1\\cdot\\dots\\cdot\na_n\\). For an infinite sequence of numbers \\(a_n\\), their\ninfinite sum or product (when it is defined) is the limit of the\npartial sums or products: \n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty a_i=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i.\\]\n\n\nThus,\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2^i}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{2^i}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1-\\frac{1}{2^n})=1\\).\nWe can show that if an infinite sequence of terms has a sum that\nconverges, then the terms themselves must converge to 0. That\u2019s\nbecause the terms \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) must converge, so that for any\n\\(\\epsilon\\), there must be \\(N\\), such that every one of the\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of the limit whenever\n\\(n>N\\). Thus, every such \\(a_n\\) must have absolute value less\nthan \\(2\\epsilon\\), so that both successive partial sums can be within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of this limit. (A similar condition holds also for\ninfinite products, but from now on we will focus only on infinite\nsums.)\n\nHowever, just having the terms \\(a_n\\) converge to 0 is not sufficient\nfor the sum to converge. A deep and important fact about infinite sums\nis that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{i}\\) fails to converge, because\nthe partial sums eventually exceed any finite bound. To see this, note\nthat the first term is greater than \\(1/2\\), the next two terms are\nboth greater than \\(1/4\\), the next four terms are all greater than\n\\(1/8\\), and in general there are \\(2^{n-1}\\) terms that are each\ngreater than \\(1/2^n\\). So to get a partial sum greater than \\(n\\), it\nis sufficient to add the first \\(2^{2n}\\) terms.\n\nBut if the terms \\(a_n\\) converge to 0, and each one is smaller in\nabsolute value and has the opposite sign as the previous term, then\nthe infinite sum must converge. If the first term in the sequence is\npositive, this is because the even numbered partial sums form a\nbounded, increasing sequence, and the odd numbered partial sums form a\nbounded, decreasing sequence, and the difference between successive\nterms of these two sequences is a term of the original sequence and\nthus converges to 0. Thus, the sum\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^{i+1}}{i}\\) converges (in particular, to\nthe natural logarithm of 2). But a somewhat surprising fact, known as\nthe Riemann rearrangement theorem, states that if the positive terms\nof a sequence have no finite sum, and the negative terms of the\nsequence have no finite sum, but the individual terms themselves\nconverge to 0, then for any real number \\(x\\), the terms of the\nsequence can be put into some order so that \\(x\\) is the sum of the\nsequence in that order! To prove this, just rearrange the terms by\nbeginning with enough positive terms to bring a partial sum above\n\\(x\\), then enough negative terms to bring a partial sum below \\(x\\),\nthen enough partial sums to bring a partial sum above \\(x\\) again, and\nso on. This process must be able to be carried out, because the\npartial sum of the positive terms eventually exceeds any finite bound,\nand similarly with the partial sum of the negative terms. Since the\nindividual terms of the sequence are all eventually within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of 0, these partial sums must eventually never differ\nfrom \\(x\\) by more than \\(\\epsilon\\), and so the sum of this\narrangement of the terms must converge to \\(x\\).\n\nThus, infinite summation has some importantly different features from\nfinite summation. For any finite set of real numbers, the sum of those\nnumbers is well-defined, and doesn\u2019t depend on the order you add\nthem. But with an infinite sequence of real numbers, there may be no\nnumber that is the sum of that sequence in that order. And even if\nthere is, it may be possible to rearrange the terms of the sequence so\nthat they sum to another value.\n\nBut there are some cases in which the sum can be known to behave\nnicely. If all the terms in the sequence are positive, and there is\nsome order in which their sum converges, then their sum must\nconverge to this value in any order. This is because the\npartial sums form an increasing sequence, and for any two orderings of\nthe terms, and any partial sum of one of those orderings, there must\nbe some partial sum of the other ordering that includes all of the\nterms in that partial sum, and vice versa. Similarly, the value of the\nsum doesn\u2019t depend on the order of summation if all the terms\nare negative. And if the positive terms have a convergent sum, and the\nnegative terms of a series also do, then the sum of the series taken\nin any order must be equal to the sum of these two sums. Such a\nsequence is said to be absolutely convergent, as the sum of\nthe absolute values of the terms converges.\n3.2.3 Limits of functions and the extended real numbers \\(\\pm\\infty\\)\n\nInfinite sequences and sums aren\u2019t the only ways that limits\nappear in mathematics. Functions of a real value can also have limits.\nThe limit of a function of a real value \\(x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to\ninfinity is defined in a similar way to the limit of a sequence\nindexed by natural numbers. To say \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=l\\]\n\n\nis to say that for every \\(\\epsilon\\), there is an \\(N\\), such that\nwhenever \\(x>N\\), \\(f(x)\\) is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(l\\). For\nexample, \\(\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty}e^{-x}=0\\), because \\(e^{-x}\\) can be\nmade as small as one likes by choosing large enough \\(x\\). (Note that\nthe inputs to a function can be positive or negative, so we need to\nspecify that \\(x\\) approaches positive infinity to\ndistinguish this from the limit at the other end of the axis.)\n\nBut it is also often useful to be able to define the limit of a\nfunction at some particular finite real-valued input. For instance, we\nmight be interested in the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}\\) as\n\\(x\\) approaches 3. (As we will see in section\n 3.4,\n this sort of calculation is particularly important in defining the\nconcept of \u2018derivative\u2019 of a function, giving the slope of\na continuous curve at a point.) This particular function is defined\nfor all real numbers other than 3, and at any such input\n\\(x\\) it takes the value \\(x+3\\). We would like to be able to say that\nthe limit of this function as \\(x\\) approaches 3 is 6. The way we make\nthis precise is to say that \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=l\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor each real number \\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a \\(\\delta\\),\nsuch that for every \\(x\\) with \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\),\n\\(|f(x)-l|<\\epsilon.\\)\n\n\nThat is, for any degree of approximation to the limit that we want,\nthere is some degree of approximation for the input that suffices to\nguarantee that the function is that close. In the initial definition\nof a limit as \\(x\\) goes to \\(+\\infty\\), we required \\(x\\) to\n\u2018approximate\u2019 \\(+\\infty\\) by being sufficiently large, but\nnow we require it to approximate \\(a\\) by having a difference from\n\\(a\\) that is sufficiently small, just as the values of the sequence\nor function approximate the limit \\(l\\).\n\nWe can do the reverse to put \\(\\infty\\) on the right side of the limit\nas well. That is, we say \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)=+\\infty\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor every \\(M\\), there exists a \\(\\delta\\), such that for every \\(x\\)\nwith \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(f(x)>M\\),\n\n\nand similarly \n\\[\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=+\\infty\\]\n\n\niff\n\n\nfor every \\(M\\), there exists an \\(N\\), such that for every\n\\(x>N\\), \\(f(x)>M\\).\n\n\nSince \\(\\infty\\) (or more precisely\n\u2018\\(+\\infty\\)\u2019\u2014similar methods work for\n\u2018\\(-\\infty\\)\u2019) can appear in each place where a real\nnumber can appear in this limit notation, it is natural to see if we\ncan extend the definition of real numbers so that it can be\nincluded.\n\nAnd in fact, if we take the definition of a Dedekind cut, and relax\nthe requirement that the left and right sets be non-empty, we get two\nnew elements\u2014the one with an empty right set is greater than\nevery rational number, and called \u2018\\(+\\infty\\)\u2019, while the\none with an empty left set is less than every rational number, and\ncalled \u2018\\(-\\infty\\)\u2019. Within these \u2018extended real\nnumbers\u2019, not only does every bounded increasing\nsequence have a limit, but every increasing sequence has a\nlimit.\n\nJust as the real numbers emerge naturally as the tools to measure\nfinite quantities, as the limits of rational approximations, the\nextended real numbers emerge naturally as the tools to measure\npotentially infinite quantities that can be approximated by finite\nquantities. \\(+\\infty\\) can be taken to be the area of an infinite\nregion, the length of an infinite line, the limit of \\(1/x^2\\) as\n\\(x\\) goes to 0, and so on. Although we are used to thinking of\nlengths and areas as positive numbers, it is sometimes useful to\nconsider them as negative as well, when we care about the direction\nthat they are pointing, and in this sort of situation \\(-\\infty\\) is\nuseful as well. Just as the real number operations of addition,\nmultiplication, subtraction, and division correspond to certain\noperations on the quantities they measure, these operations can often\nbe extended to these extended real numbers, as long as we are careful\nabout a few cases.\n\nAdding or subtracting a finite area from an infinite area leaves it\ninfinite. Adding a shape with infinite area to another shape of the\nsame infinite area leaves the total area unchanged, and subtracting a\nnegative infinite one from a positive one or vice versa is similar.\nBut \\((+\\infty) + (-\\infty)\\) cannot be meaningfully evaluated; nor\ncan \\((+\\infty) - (+\\infty)\\). If you take one infinitely large\nregion, and remove an infinitely large region, you might be left with\nnothing, or a positive region, but you might still be left with an\ninfinitely large region; or if the region you subtracted was larger\nthan the original region, you might be left with a negative\nregion\u2014even an infinite negative region.\n\nThese restrictions also apply to the use of these extended real\nnumbers as the limits of sequences or functions. Whenever two\nsequences or functions both have a finite limit, their sum or\ndifference will have a limit that is the sum or difference of their\nlimits. When one has a finite limit and the other is infinite, then\ntheir sum or difference will be determined by the one that is\ninfinite. But when both are infinite, there are problems. We can see\nthat \\(1/x^2\\), \\(2+1/x^2\\), and \\(1/x^4\\) are all functions that go\nto \\(+\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) goes to 0. If we add or subtract any of these\nfunctions from a function with a finite limit, the resulting function\nstill has limit of \\(+\\infty\\). If we add them to each other in any\ncombination, the result still has limit \\(+\\infty\\). But if we\nconsider their differences, we see that \\(1/x^2 - 1/x^2\\) has 0 as its\nlimit, \\(1/x^2 - 1/x^4\\) has \\(-\\infty\\) as its limit, and \\(1/x^2\n-(2+1/x^2)\\) has \\(-2\\) as its limit. So \u201c\\(\\infty -\n\\infty\\)\u201d is said to be an \u201cindeterminate form\u201d that\ncan\u2019t be evaluated.\n\nMultiplying or dividing an infinite number by a finite positive number\nleaves it unchanged, and multiplying or dividing by a finite negative\nnumber reverses its sign. Similarly for multiplying the infinite\nnumbers by themselves or each other. But an infinite number divided by\nan infinite number, or an infinite number multiplied by 0, are also\nindeterminate forms. As \\(x\\) approaches 0, the function\n\\(\\frac{1/x^2}{1/x^2}\\) has limit 1, while the function\n\\(\\frac{1/x^2}{1/x^4}\\) has limit \\(+\\infty\\). If we take the function\n\\(1/x^2\\) whose limit is \\(+\\infty\\) and multiply it by the function\n\\(x\\) whose limit is 0, we get the function \\(1/x\\), that has no limit\nas \\(x\\) approaches 0 (since it takes on both large positive and large\nnegative values in any small interval around 0\u2014this is why we\nhave used \\(1/x^2\\) and \\(1/x^4\\) as the paradigms of functions with\nlimit \\(+\\infty\\), rather than \\(1/x\\) or \\(1/x^3\\)). For similar\nreasons, these extended real numbers don\u2019t provide a way to\ndivide by 0. So although the extended real numbers have some nice\nproperties, and can be used for measurement in various cases,\narithmetic involving them is not as nice as the standard real\nnumbers.\n3.2.4 Related infinities\n\nThe Dedekind cut construction was done as a way to make sense of\nlimits of the rational numbers. This first created the real numbers,\nwhich can be thought of as the limits of bounded infinite sequences of\nrational numbers. We then considered all limits that made\nsense, including towards the ends of the real line, yielding the\nextended reals, including the standard reals as well as \\(+\\infty\\)\nand \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nVersions of this process can be carried out with other mathematical\nentities as well. Projective geometry adds additional points \u2018at\ninfinity\u2019 to the Euclidean plane, one for each family of\nparallel lines, to help explain features of visual geometry, like the\nway that parallel railroad tracks appear to meet at the horizon,\ninfinitely far away. Riemannian geometry extends the complex numbers\nby adding just a single number \\(\\infty\\) that one can\napproach simultaneously \u2018in all directions\u2019 in the complex\nplane. These alternate geometries provide foundations for material\ndiscussed in section\n 2.2,\n and also section\n 8.2.\n Several of these are discussed in the entry on\n nineteenth century geometry,\n and others are discussed in topology textbooks under the topic of\n\u2018compactification\u2019.\n\nBecause these infinities are inherently considered as limits of finite\napproximations, there is no way for one infinite element to lie\n\u201cbeyond\u201d another\u2014at most it can lie in a\n\u201cdifferent direction\u201d, the way that the points of\nconvergence of different families of parallel lines do, or the way\n\\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\) do in the extended reals.\n\nBut as we will shortly see, there are other notions of infinity for\nwhich one infinity can lie \u201cbeyond\u201d another. In section\n 3.3,\n we will discuss the ideas of infinity that we get from generalizing\nthe use of the natural numbers for counting, rather than generalizing\nthe use of the real numbers for measuring. And in section\n 3.4,\n we will discuss yet another mathematical theory of infinity, which\narises from an alternate formulation of calculus, where the\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\u2019s and \\(\\delta\\)\u2019s are treated as actually\nbeing infinitely small, rather than just being arbitrary finite\nmeasures of smallness.\n",
