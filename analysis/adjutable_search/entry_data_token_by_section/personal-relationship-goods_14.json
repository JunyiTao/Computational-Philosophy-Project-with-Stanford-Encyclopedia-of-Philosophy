    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods for Children || The Right to Familial Relationship Goods\n4.1 The Right to Familial Relationship Goods\n\nIt is undeniable that children have claims with respect to their\nwellbeing against adults\u2014whether collectively or specifically\nagainst their parents\u2014and many think these are claims of\njustice. Brighouse and Swift (2014) influentially defend the\ninstitution of the family by appeal to family relationship goods, many\nof which are relational: parental love, trustworthy and spontaneous\nintimacy and being subject to beneficial authority from an individual\nwho loves, knows and is responsible for the child.\n\nBeing part of a family relationship, and enjoying its goods is also\ngood for adults, and possibly part of the distribuenda of\njustice for both children and adults. Brighouse and Swift believe that\nadults\u2019 entitlement is to an opportunity to enjoy family life,\nand it is conditional on them being adequate parents. For children,\npresumably, the entitlement to familial relationship goods is\nunconditional and it is to the actual outcomes rather than to mere\nopportunities. Brighouse and Swift make an exception for one of the\ngoods, namely love; they\u2014like many other\nphilosophers\u2014believe there cannot be a right to be loved. This\nissue deserves a separate discussion.\n",
