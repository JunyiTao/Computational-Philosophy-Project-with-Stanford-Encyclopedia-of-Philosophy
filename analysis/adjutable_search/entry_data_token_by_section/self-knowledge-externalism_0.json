    "main_text": "Why Externalism?\n1. Why Externalism?\n\nGiven the tension with SK, why should we accept EXT in the first\nplace? One reason is that EXT is more or less entailed by many\ncontemporary theories of content. For instance, several theories say\n(in short) that a\n concept[5]\n has its content in virtue of certain causal relations the concept\nbears to an environmental referent (Dretske 1981, Millikan 1984; 1989,\nFodor 1987; 1990; also, cf. Kripke 1972 and Evans 1982, ch. 6). Others\nsee mental content as posited when interpreting a subject\nvis-\u00e0-vis objects in her environment (Davidson 1973; 1987,\nDennett 1975). Still others see content as determined by the\ninferences that feature the relevant concept. Such an inference,\nmoreover, is often defined partly by the environmental object which\nnormally prompts the inference, or in which the inference normally\nterminates (Sellars 1954).\n\nPredictably, such theories face various difficulties\u2014so none\nprovide a decisive case for EXT. Yet the foremost arguments for the\nview are not so parochial. These arguments instead rest on various\nthought experiments, purporting to show that internally identical\nsubjects can host different thought contents, solely because of\nenvironmental differences (Putnam 1973; 1975, McGinn 1977, Stich 1978,\nBurge 1979; 1982; 1986). If the thought experiments are right about\nthis, then internal states do not wholly determine thought content.\nThe environment would play a part as well.\n\nThe most famous experiment imagines a remote planet called \u201cTwin\nEarth,\u201d a planet which is superficially indiscernible from Earth\n(so that even its events parallel the events on Earth). But there is\none key difference: The compound H2O occurs nowhere on Twin\nEarth. In its place is a different compound that looks, tastes, etc.,\nexactly the same, which we may call \u201cXYZ\u201d. Now consider\nOscar, a normal adult English speaker, along with his Twin Earth\ndoppelg\u00e4nger, Twin Oscar. (Ignore that people are mostly\nH2O; that\u2019s an accident of this example.) The\nexternalist intuition is that, even if these \u201ctwins\u201d are\nunschooled in chemistry, Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to refer to\nH2O yet Twin Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to refer to\nXYZ. After all, when Oscar asserts \u201cwater is scrumptious,\u201d\nthis is directed at water, yet Twin Oscar\u2019s parallel assertion\nis in reference to XYZ, a.k.a. twin\n water.[6]\n\nMoreover, suppose we accept the Fregean view that the meaning of a\nterm determines what the term refers to (or in Carnap\u2019s words,\nthat \u201cintension determines\n extension\u201d).[7]\n Then, given the different referents, the twins\u2019 terms must have\ndifferent meanings as well. But Oscar and Twin Oscar are\nphysical duplicates; so it appears the meaning of \u2018water\u2019\nis not wholly fixed by speakers\u2019 internal states. Rather, the\nenvironment also figures into\n it.[8]\n\nThis claim about linguistic meaning is then extended to the content of\nmental representations for natural kinds like water, and for\nnon-natural kinds like sofas (where the latter are defined by\nsocial convention) (McGinn 1977, Stich 1978, Burge 1979; 1982; 1986).\nConsider that when Oscar says \u201csofas are delightful,\u201d he\nexpresses a thought that references sofas. But suppose that\nTwin Oscar\u2019s community defines a \u201csofa\u201d slightly\ndifferently, so that broad, overstuffed armchairs count as\n\u201csofas.\u201d Consequently, when Twin Oscar asserts\n\u201csofas are delightful,\u201d he differs from Oscar in\nexpressing a thought that refers to (among other things) broad,\noverstuffed armchairs. But again, if content determines reference, the\ndifference in reference demonstrates a difference in intension or\ncontent, in spite of identical internal\n states.[9]\n Thus we arrive at EXT.\n\nSome might find these science fiction stories extravagant, and it may\nbe unclear whether they teach us anything about the real world. Yet\nthere are actual examples which also illustrate the point (Ludlow\n1995b; see also Butler 1997, Tye\n 1998).[10]\n Consider that \u2018chicory\u2019 and \u2018endive\u2019 have\ntheir denotations switched between Standard American English and\nBritish English. The two types of salad green also seem identical to\nthe untrained eye (or palate, as the case may be). Thus a Brit and an\nAmerican, both untrained, might be internally the same in all relevant\nrespects, yet refer to different greens when asserting \u201cchicory\nis scrumptious.\u201d So \u2018chicory\u2019 will express a concept\nwith different content, despite the subjects being internally alike.\n(Notably, \u2018water\u2019 itself might vary in content among\ndifferent locations in the actual world. What flows from taps contains\ndifferent admixtures in different municipalities. Cf. Malt 1994.)\n\nNevertheless, some philosophers reject these considerations for a\nvariety of reasons (Zemach 1976, Mellor 1977, Searle 1983, ch. 8, Bach\n1988; 1998, Crane 1991, Rosenberg 1994, Chomsky 1995; 2000, Segal\n2000, Martinich & Stroll 2007, ch. 5, Farkas 2008, Pollock 2015;\nsee also Fine 1975). Other philosophers do not reject EXT as much as\nrestrict it: They posit a kind of content\u2014so called\n\u201cnarrow\u201d content\u2014which is determined independently\nof the environment (Block 1986, Loar 1988, Georgalis 1994; 1999,\nChalmers 1996; 2002, Jackson 1998, Siewart 1998, Horgan & Tienson\n2002, Wikforss 2007, Mendola 2008; see also the entry on\n narrow content).\n As one illustration, two-dimensionalists characterize narrow content\nas a function that takes an environment as input and outputs the\n\u201cwide\u201d content of the concept in that environment, i.e.,\nthe content of which EXT is true (Chalmers 1996; 2002). And\nputatively, the problem with armchair self-knowledge does not arise\nwith narrow content. (For more, see Fernandez 2004 as well as the\nentry on\n two-dimensional semantics.)\n\nThe debate on whether EXT is unrestrictedly true is important, but\nthis is not the place to discuss it. (Yet see the entry on\n externalism about mental content.)\n For our purposes, the main point is that EXT is not without support,\nand so there is some reason to hold onto the view despite the apparent\ntension with SK.\n",
