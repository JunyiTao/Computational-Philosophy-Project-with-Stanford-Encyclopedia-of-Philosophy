    "main_text": "\n\nRichard Price (1723\u20131791) was a prominent dissenting minister\nand a leading figure in philosophical and political thought in the\nsecond half of the eighteenth century. As well as publishing on a wide\nrange of subjects, including ethics, politics, theology, and\nprobability theory, he also greatly advanced work on actuarial tables,\nwhich enabled insurers to predict more accurately the life-expectancy\nof people in their differing circumstances. His passionate commitment\nto the cause of liberty led him to take a prominent public role in\nvarious campaigns, including a remission of the penalties on\nnon-conformists, and in support of both the American and the French\nrevolutions. His defense of the latter prompted a famous reply by\nBurke, as well as defenses by his friends Paine and\nWollstonecraft.\n",
