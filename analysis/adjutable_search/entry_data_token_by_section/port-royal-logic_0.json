    "main_text": "Antoine Arnauld, Jansenism, and the Port-Royal Abbey\n1. Antoine Arnauld, Jansenism, and the Port-Royal Abbey\n\nAntoine Arnauld, the primary author of the Logic, was born in\nParis, on 8 February 1612, to Antoine and Catherine Arnauld. His\nfather was one of the most famous lawyers of his time. The son\nAntoine, the youngest of their 20 children, originally wanted to study\nlaw, but because his father had died in 1619, he decided to honor his\nmother\u2019s wish that he study theology. He entered the Sorbonne,\nbecoming a disciple of Lescot, the confessor of Cardinal Richelieu. In\naddition to the Port-Royal Grammar and the Logic,\nArnauld is best known as the author of the Fourth Objections to\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations. He also engaged in lengthy\ncorrespondence with Leibniz, carried on a polemic against Malebranche\nin the Treatise on True and False Ideas, and wrote several\ntheological essays, including The Perpetuity of the Faith.\nPierre Nicole, the secondary author, was born at Chartres in 1625. His\nfather was also a prominent lawyer, with ties to literary circles in\nParis. Nicole studied theology at the Sorbonne, where he came into\ncontact with teachers inclined towards Jansenism. When Jansenism came\nunder attack at the Sorbonne, he withdrew and went to the abbey at\nPort-Royal-des-Champs. He eventually became one of the most prominent\nJansenist writers of the seventeenth century; his Moral\nEssays (1671\u20137) was at that time his most famous work.\n\nJansenism was a radical reform movement within French Catholicism\nbased on Augustine\u2019s views of the relation between free will and\nthe efficacy of grace. The movement was named after Cornelis Jansen\n(or Cornelius Jansenius), a Dutch theologian born in 1585 who studied\nat the Sorbonne. He became the Bishop of Ypres in the Spanish\nNetherlands in 1636 and died two years later. His major work\nAugustinus was published posthumously in 1640. A second\nfigure in Jansenism was the Abbot of Saint-Cyran, born Jean Duvergier\nde Hauranne in 1581. He received his M.A. in theology at the Sorbonne\nin 1600, where he met Jansen. The two worked together from\n1611\u20131617 on scriptural questions. The issues bringing Jansenism\ninto conflict with Catholic orthodoxy concerned the efficacy of grace,\nthe role of free will in salvation, and the nature of penitence. The\nattack on Jansen began with Isaac Habert\u2019s sermons and writings\nduring 1643\u201344. By 1653 Pope Innocent X issued an encyclical,\nCum occasione, declaring five propositions in\nAugustinus to be heretical. They expressed the views that a\njust person who wishes to obey God\u2019s commandments cannot do so\nwithout the necessary grace to carry them out; that in the state of\ncorrupt nature one can never resist interior grace; and that\nmeritorious actions require only a liberty exempt from constraint\nrather than one exempt from necessity.\n\nAlthough he did not agree with all of Jansen\u2019s views on grace\nand free will, Arnauld devoted several major works to defending\naspects of Jansenism, including On Frequent Communion, the\nDefense of Monsieur Jansenius and a Second Defense.\nThese writings resulted in a trial and his expulsion from the Sorbonne\nin 1656. In 1661 the Council of State decreed that all churchmen must\nsign a formulary drawn up in 1657, condemning the heretical\npropositions in Jansen\u2019s work Augustinus. Arnauld and\nNicole had taken the position that the propositions were heretical but\ndid not appear in the Augustinus. From 1669 to the late 1670s\nthere was a truce between the Catholic Church and the Jansenists. But\nin 1679, after attacks had resumed, Arnauld went into exile in the\nNetherlands; he died at Brussels on 8 August 1694. Nicole had joined\nArnauld in exile, but he returned to Paris in 1683 where he reconciled\nwith the authorities. He died in Paris in 1695.\n",
