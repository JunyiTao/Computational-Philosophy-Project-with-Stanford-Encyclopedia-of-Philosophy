    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Critique of Set Theory: Non-Enumerability vs. Non-Denumerability\n3.4 Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Critique of Set Theory: Non-Enumerability vs. Non-Denumerability\n\nLargely a product of his anti-foundationalism and his\ncriticism of the extension-intension conflation, Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater critique of set theory is highly consonant with his intermediate\ncritique (PR \u00a7\u00a7109, 168; PG 334, 369, 469;\nLFM 172, 224, 229; and RFM III, \u00a743, 46, 85,\n90; VII, \u00a716). Given that mathematics is a \u201cMOTLEY of\ntechniques of proof\u201d (RFM III, \u00a746), it does not\nrequire a foundation (RFM VII, \u00a716) and it cannot be\ngiven a self-evident foundation (PR \u00a7160;\nWVC 34 & 62; RFM IV, \u00a73). Since set theory\nwas invented to provide mathematics with a foundation, it is,\nminimally, unnecessary.\n\nEven if set theory is unnecessary, it still might constitute a solid\nfoundation for mathematics. In his core criticism of set theory,\nhowever, the later Wittgenstein denies this, saying that the diagonal\nproof does not prove non-denumerability, for \u201c[i]t means nothing\nto say: \u2018Therefore the X numbers are not\ndenumerable\u2019\u201d (RFM II, \u00a710). When the diagonal is\nconstrued as a proof of greater and lesser infinite sets it\nis a \u201cpuffed-up proof\u201d, which, as Poincar\u00e9 argued\n(1913: 61\u201362), purports to prove or show more than \u201cits\nmeans allow it\u201d (RFM II, \u00a721).\n\n\nIf it were said: Consideration of the diagonal procedure shews you that the\nconcept \u2018real number\u2019 has much less analogy with\nthe concept \u2018cardinal number\u2019 than we, being misled by\ncertain analogies, are inclined to believe, that would have a good and honest sense. But just the\nopposite happens: one pretends to compare the\n\u2018set\u2019 of real numbers in magnitude with that of cardinal\nnumbers. The difference in kind between the two conceptions is\nrepresented, by a skew form of expression, as difference of extension.\nI believe, and hope, that a future generation will laugh at this hocus\npocus. (RFM II, \u00a722)\n\nThe sickness of a time is cured by an alteration in the mode of life\nof human beings\u2026 (RFM II, \u00a723)\n\n\nThe \u201chocus pocus\u201d of the diagonal proof rests, as always\nfor Wittgenstein, on a conflation of extension and intension, on the\nfailure to properly distinguish sets as rules for generating\nextensions and (finite) extensions. By way of this confusion \u201ca\ndifference in kind\u201d (i.e., unlimited rule vs. finite extension)\n\u201cis represented by a skew form of expression\u201d, namely as a\ndifference in the cardinality of two infinite\nextensions. Not only can the diagonal not prove that one\ninfinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set,\naccording to Wittgenstein, nothing could prove this, simply\nbecause \u201cinfinite sets\u201d are not extensions, and\nhence not infinite extensions. But instead of interpreting\nCantor\u2019s diagonal proof honestly, we take the proof to\n\u201cshow there are numbers bigger than the infinite\u201d, which\n\u201csets the whole mind in a whirl, and gives the pleasant feeling\nof paradox\u201d (LFM 16\u201317)\u2014a \u201cgiddiness\nattacks us when we think of certain theorems in set\ntheory\u201d\u2014\u201cwhen we are performing a piece of logical\nsleight-of-hand\u201d (PI \u00a7412; \u00a7426; 1945). This\ngiddiness and pleasant feeling of paradox, says Wittgenstein\n(LFM 16), \u201cmay be the chief reason [set theory] was\ninvented\u201d.\n\nThough Cantor\u2019s diagonal is not a proof of\nnon-denumerability, when it is expressed in a constructive\nmanner, as Wittgenstein himself expresses it at (RFM II,\n\u00a71), \u201cit gives sense to the mathematical proposition that\nthe number so-and-so is different from all those of the system\u201d\n(RFM II, \u00a729). That is, the proof proves\nnon-enumerability: it proves that for any given\ndefinite real number concept (e.g., recursive real), one\ncannot enumerate \u2018all\u2019 such numbers because one can always\nconstruct a diagonal number, which falls under the same concept and is\nnot in the enumeration. \u201cOne might say\u201d, Wittgenstein\nsays, \n\n\nI call number-concept X non-denumerable if it has been stipulated\nthat, whatever numbers falling under this concept you arrange in a\nseries, the diagonal number of this series is also to fall under that\nconcept. (RFM II, \u00a710; cf. II, \u00a7\u00a730, 31,\n13)\n\n\nOne lesson to be learned from this, according to Wittgenstein\n(RFM II, \u00a733), is that \u201cthere are diverse\nsystems of irrational points to be found in the number\nline\u201d, each of which can be given by a recursive rule, but\n\u201cno system of irrational numbers\u201d, and \u201calso no\nsuper-system, no \u2018set of irrational numbers\u2019 of\nhigher-order infinity\u201d. Cantor has shown that we can construct\n\u201cinfinitely many\u201d diverse systems of irrational numbers,\nbut we cannot construct an exhaustive system of all\nthe irrational numbers (RFM II, \u00a729). As Wittgenstein\nsays at (MS 121, 71r; Dec. 27, 1938), three pages after the passage\nused for (RFM II, \u00a757): \n\n\nIf you now call the Cantorian procedure one for producing a new real\nnumber, you will now no longer be inclined to speak of a system of\nall real numbers. (italics added) \n\n\nFrom Cantor\u2019s proof, however, set theorists erroneously conclude\nthat \u201cthe set of irrational numbers\u201d is greater in\nmultiplicity than any enumeration of irrationals (or the set of\nrationals), when the only conclusion to draw is that there is no such\nthing as the set of all the irrational numbers. The\ntruly dangerous aspect to \u2018propositions\u2019 such as\n\u201cThe real numbers cannot be arranged in a series\u201d and\n\u201cThe set\u2026 is not denumerable\u201d is that they make\nconcept formation [i.e., our invention] \u201clook like a\nfact of nature\u201d (i.e., something we discover)\n(RFM II \u00a7\u00a716, 37). At best, we have a vague idea of\nthe concept of \u201creal number\u201d, but only if we restrict this\nidea to \u201crecursive real number\u201d and only if we recognize\nthat having the concept does not mean having a set\nof all recursive real numbers.\n",
