    "main_text": "Requests and Questions || Questions Seeking Information\n4.2 Questions Seeking Information\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s treatment of information-seeking\nquestions is strongly influenced by two contexts in which\nAristotle\u2019s Organon uses question words. The first of\nthese is in Categories, where Aristotle (at least as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b reads him) classifies primary concepts under\nthe ten supreme genera. Aristotle explains his classification partly\nthrough question words: \u201chow much\u201d (Arabic kam),\n\u201chow\u201d (kayfa), \u201cwhere\u201d\n(ayna), \u201cwhen\u201d (mat\u0101).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b takes note of most of these question words,\nand adds two more: \u201cwhat\u201d (m\u0101) and\n\u201cwhich\u201d (ayyu) ([Letters] (166) 165.17,\n(183) 181.16.) In [Expressions] 47.5\u201312 he notes that\nthe answers to some of these questions can be classified by the\nquestion word or a word derived from it: \u201cquantity\u201d\n(kamiyya), \u201cquality\u201d (kayfiyya),\n\u201cquiddity\u201d or \u201cwhatness\u201d\n(m\u0101hiyya). (See the discussion of these questions in\nDiebler 2005.)\n\nThe second context is the second book of Posterior Analytics.\nIn the opening lines of this book Aristotle lists the four\n\u201cthings that we seek\u201d, namely that it is so (annahu\ny\u016bjadu), why it is (li-m\u0101dh\u0101), what it is\n(m\u0101) and which it is (ayyu). In\n[Letters] (210) 200.16 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b adds the\nquestion \u201cis it the case that\u201d (hal), which turns\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cthat it is\u201d into a question.\n\nLarge parts of both [Expressions] and [Letters] are\ndevoted to explaining how we can elicit philosophical information by\nasking these and similar\n questions.[12]\n Thus for each primary concept we can ask \u201cWhat is it\u201d?\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b defines the genus (jins) of the\nconcept to be the answer to this question. By asking \u201cwhich\nthing\u201d (in that genus), we get a more specific description that\nprovides the species (naw\u2018) below the genus.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains how further questions can elicit the\ndifferentiae and the definitions of concepts. The\n\u201cessence\u201d (dh\u0101t) of a concept consists of\nthe concepts included in the definition of the concept; these concepts\nin the essence are also described as \u201cconstitutive\u201d\n(muqawwim) for the concept. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tries hard to convince us that the\nphilosophers\u2019 questions are a natural extension of everyday\nquestions. (Diebler 2005 draws a plausible comparison with ordinary\nlanguage philosophy.) But the effort hardly succeeds. In what everyday\ncontext would we ask, about a date-palm, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d and\naccept the answer \u201cIt\u2019s a body\u201d? ([Letters]\n(167) 166.16) The outcome is that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nunintentionally raises problems that are still resonant in the\nphilosophy of questions. Compare \u201cIt\u2019s a body\u201d with\nthe answer \u201c[He] is a person who is over three inches\ntall\u201d discussed by Cross and Roelofsen 2018.\n",
