    "main_text": "\n\nQuestions about animal consciousness \u2014 in particular, which\nanimals have consciousness and what (if anything) that consciousness\nmight be like \u2014 are  both  scientific and\nphilosophical. They are scientific because answering them will require\ngathering information using scientific techniques \u2014 no amount of\narm-chair pondering, conceptual analysis, logic, a priori\ntheory-building, transcendental inference or introspection will tell\nus whether a platypus, an iguana, or a squid (to take a few examples)\nenjoy a life of subjective experience \u2014 at some point we\u2019ll have\nto learn something about the animals. Just what sort(s) of science can\nbear on these questions is a live question, but at the least this will\ninclude investigations of the behavior and neurophysiology of a wide\ntaxonomic range of animals, as well as the phylogenetic relationships\namong taxa. But these questions are deeply philosophical as well, with\nepistemological, metaphysical, and phenomenological\ndimensions. Progress will therefore ultimately require\ninterdisciplinary work by philosophers willing to engage with the\nempirical details of animal biology, as well as scientists who are\nsensitive to the philosophical complexities of the issue.\n\n",
