    "main_text": "\n\nWhile Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) is well-known as one of\nthe founders of modern philosophy, his influential role in the\ndevelopment of modern physics has been, until the later half of the\ntwentieth century, generally under-appreciated and under-investigated\nby both historians and philosophers of science. Not only did Descartes\nprovide the first distinctly modern formulation of laws of nature and\na conservation principle of motion, but he also constructed what would\nbecome the most popular theory of planetary motion of the late\nseventeenth century. As the renowned historian of science Clifford\nTruesdell has observed, \u201c[Descartes\u2019 physics] is the\nbeginning of theory in the modern sense\u201d (Truesdell 1984, 6).\nYet, for all of the forward-looking, seemingly modern, aspects of\nDescartes\u2019 physics, many of Descartes\u2019 physical hypotheses\nbear a close kinship with the Aristotelian-influenced science of\nlate-Medieval and Renaissance Scholasticism. It is this unique amalgam\nof both old and new concepts of the physical world that may account\nfor the current revival of scholarly interest in Descartes\u2019\nphysics.\n",
