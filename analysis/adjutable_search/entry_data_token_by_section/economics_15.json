    "main_text": "Influential approaches to economic methodology || Popperian approaches\n4.1 Popperian approaches\n\nKarl Popper\u2019s\n philosophy of science has been influential among economists, as among\nother scientists. Popper defends what he calls a falsificationist\nmethodology (1968, 1969). Scientists should formulate theories that\nare \u201clogically falsifiable\u201d \u2014 that is, inconsistent\nwith some possible observation reports. \u201cAll crows are\nblack\u201d is logically falsifiable; it is inconsistent with (and\nwould be falsified by) an observation report of a red crow.\n(Probabilistic claims are obviously not in this sense falsifiable.)\nPopper insists on falsifiability on the grounds that unfalsifiable\nclaims that rule out no observations are uninformative. They provide\nno guidance concerning what to expect, and there is nothing to be\nlearned from testing them. Second, Popper maintains that scientists\nshould subject theories to harsh test and should be willing to reject\nthem when they fail the tests. Third, scientists should regard\ntheories as at best interesting conjectures. Passing a test does not\nconfirm a theory or provide scientists with reason to believe it. It\nonly justifies on the one hand continuing to employ the hypothesis\n(since it has not yet been falsified) and, on the other hand, devoting\nincreased efforts to attempting to falsify it (since it has thus far\nsurvived testing). Popper has defended what he calls\n\u201csituational logic\u201d (which is basically rational choice\ntheory) as the correct method for the social sciences (1967, 1976).\nThere appear to be serious tensions between Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism and his defense of situational logic, and his\ndiscussion of situational logic has not been as influential as his\nfalsificationism. For discussion of how situational logic applies to\neconomics, see Hands (1985a).\n\nGiven Popper\u2019s falsificationism, there seems little hope of\nunderstanding how extreme simplifications can be legitimate or how\ncurrent economic practice could be scientifically reputable. Economic\ntheories and models are almost all unfalsifiable, and if they were,\nthe widespread acceptance of Friedman\u2019s methodological views\nwould insure that they are not subjected to serious test. When models\napparently fail tests, they are rarely repudiated. Economists conclude\ninstead merely that they chose the wrong model for the task, or that\nthere were disturbing causes. Economic models, which have not been\nwell tested, are often taken to be well-established guides to policy,\nrather than merely conjectures. Critics of neoclassical economics have\nmade these criticisms (Eichner 1983), but most of those who have\nespoused Popper\u2019s philosophy of science have not repudiated\nmainstream economics and have not been harshly critical of its\npractitioners.\n\nMark Blaug (1992) and Terence Hutchison (1938, 1977, 1978, 2000), who\nare the most prominent Popperian methodologists, criticize particular\nfeatures of economics, and they both call for more testing and a more\ncritical attitude. For example, Blaug praises Gary Becker (1976) for\nhis refusal to explain differences in choices by differences in\npreferences, but criticizes him for failing to go on and test his\ntheories severely (1980a, chapter 14). However, both Blaug and\nHutchison understate the radicalism of Popper\u2019s views and take\nhis message to be little more than that scientists should be critical\nand concerned to test their theories.\n\nBlaug\u2019s and Hutchison\u2019s criticisms have sometimes been\nchallenged on the grounds that economic theories cannot be\ntested, because of their ceteris paribus clauses and the many\nsubsidiary assumptions required to derive testable implications\n(Caldwell 1984). But this response ignores Popper\u2019s insistence\nthat testing requires methodological decisions not to attribute\nfailures of predictions to mistakes in subsidiary assumptions or to\n\u201cinterferences.\u201d For views of Popper\u2019s philosophy\nand its applicability to economics, see de Marchi (1988), Caldwell\n(1991), Boland (1982, 1989, 1992, 1997), and Boylan and O\u2019Gorman\n(2007), Backhouse (2009), and Thomas (2017).\n\nApplying Popper\u2019s views on falsification literally would be\ndestructive. Not only neoclassical economics, but all significant\neconomic theories would be condemned as unscientific, and there would\nbe no way to discriminate among economic theories. One major problem\nwith a naive reading of Popper\u2019s views is that\none cannot derive testable implications from theories by themselves.\nTo derive testable implications, one also needs subsidiary assumptions\nconcerning probability distributions, measurement devices, proxies for\nunmeasured variables, the absence of interferences, and so forth. This\nis the so-called \u201cDuhem-Quine problem\u201d (Duhem 1906, Quine\n1953, Cross 1982). These problems arise generally, and Popper proposes\nthat they be solved by a methodological decision to regard a failure\nof the deduced testable implication to be a failure of the theory. But\nin economics the subsidiary assumptions are dubious and in many cases\nknown to be false. Making the methodological decision that Popper\nrequires is unreasonable and would lead one to reject all economic\ntheories.\n\nImre Lakatos (1970), who was for most of his philosophical career a\nfollower of Popper, offers a broadly Popperian solution to this\nproblem. Lakatos insists that testing is always comparative. When\ntheories face empirical difficulties, as they always do, one attempts\nto modify them. Scientifically acceptable (in Lakatos\u2019\nterminology \u201ctheoretically progressive\u201d) modifications\nmust always have some additional testable implications; otherwise they\nare purely ad hoc. If some of the new predictions are\nconfirmed, then the modification is \u201cempirically\nprogressive,\u201d and one has reason to reject the unmodified theory\nand to employ the new theory, regardless of how unsuccessful in\ngeneral either theory may be. Though progress may be hard to come by,\nLakatos\u2019 views do not have the same destructive implications as\nPopper\u2019s. Lakatos appears to solve the problem of how to\nappraise mainstream economic theory by arguing that what matters is\nempirical progress or retrogression rather than empirical success or\nfailure. Lakatos\u2019 views have thus been more attractive to\neconomic methodologists than Popper\u2019s.\n\nDeveloping Thomas Kuhn\u2019s notion of a \u201cparadigm\u201d\n(1970) and some hints from Popper, Lakatos also presented a view of\nthe global theory structure of whole theoretical enterprises, which he\ncalled \u201cscientific research programmes.\u201d Lakatos\nemphasized that there is a \u201chard core\u201d of basic\ntheoretical propositions that define a research programme and that are\nnot to be questioned within the research programme. In addition\nmembers of a research programme accept a common body of heuristics\nthat guide them in the articulation and modification of specific\ntheories. These views have also been attractive to economic\nmethodologists, since theory development in economics is sharply\nconstrained and since economics appears at first glance to have a\n\u201chard core.\u201d The fact that economists do not give up basic\ntheoretical postulates that appear to be false might be explained and\njustified by regarding them as part of the \u201chard core\u201d of\nthe \u201cneoclassical research programme\u201d.\n\nYet Lakatos\u2019 views do not provide a satisfactory account of how\neconomics can be a reputable science despite its reliance on extreme\nsimplifications. For it is questionable whether the development of\nneoclassical economic theory has demonstrated empirical progress. For\nexample, the replacement of \u201ccardinal\u201d utility theory by\n\u201cordinal\u201d utility theory (see below\n Section 5.1)\n in the 1930s, which is generally regarded as a major step forward,\ninvolved the replacement of one theory by another that had no\nadditional empirical content. Furthermore, despite his emphasis on\nheuristics as guiding theory modification, Lakatos still emphasizes\ntesting. Science is for Lakatos more empirically driven than\nmainstream economics has been (Hands 1992). It is also doubtful whether\nresearch enterprises in economics have \u201chard cores\u201d\n(Hoover 1991, Hausman 1992, ch. 6). For attempts to apply\nLakatos\u2019 views to economics see Latsis (1976), and Weintraub\n(1985). As is apparent in de Marchi and Blaug (1991), writers on\neconomic methodology have in recent years become increasingly\ndisenchanted with Lakatos\u2019 philosophy (Backhouse 2009).\n\nThere is a second major problem with Popper\u2019s philosophy of\nscience, which plagues Lakatos\u2019 views as well. Both maintain\nthat there is no such thing as empirical confirmation (for some late\nqualms, see Lakatos 1974). Popper and Lakatos maintain that evidence\nnever provides reason to believe that scientific claims are true, and\nboth also deny that results of tests can justify relying on statements\nin practical endeavours or in theoretical inquiry. There is no better\nevidence for one unfalsified proposition than for another. On this\nview, someone who questions whether there is enough evidence for some\nproposition to justify relying on it in theoretical studies or for\npolicy purposes would be making the methodological \u201cerror\u201d\nof supposing that there can be evidence in support of hypotheses. With\nthe notable exception of Watkins (1984), few philosophers within the\nPopperian tradition have faced up to this challenging consequence.\n",
