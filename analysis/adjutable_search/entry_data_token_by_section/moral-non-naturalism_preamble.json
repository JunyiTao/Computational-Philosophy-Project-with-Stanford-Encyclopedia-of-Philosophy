    "main_text": "\n\n\nThere may be as much philosophical controversy about how to\ndistinguish naturalism from non-naturalism as there is about which\nview is correct. In spite of this widespread disagreement about the\ncontent of naturalism and non-naturalism there is considerable\nagreement about the status of certain historically influential\nphilosophical accounts as non-naturalist. In particular, there is\nwidespread agreement that G.E. Moore\u2019s account of goodness in\nPrincipia Ethica is a paradigmatically non-naturalist\naccount. Indeed, if a representative sample of contemporary\nphilosophers were asked to name a non-naturalist in meta-ethics then\nMoore\u2019s name almost certainly would predominate.  For better or worse,\nMoore\u2019s discussion of non-naturalism profoundly shaped 20th\ncentury meta-ethics. Thomas Baldwin was not exaggerating much when he\nclaimed that, \u201ctwentieth century British ethical theory is\nunintelligible without reference to Principia Ethica; its\nhistory until 1960 or so being, in brief, that although Moore was\ntaken to have refuted \u2018ethical naturalism\u2019, Moore\u2019s own\nbrand of \u2018ethical non-naturalism\u2019 was thought to make\nunacceptable metaphysical and epistemological demands; so the only\nrecourse was to abandon belief in an objective moral reality and\naccept an emotivist, prescriptivist or otherwise anti-realist, account\nof ethical values.\u201d (Baldwin 1990: 66) More recent defenders of\nnon-naturalist theories (e.g. Shafer-Landau 2003, Enoch 2011, and\nParfit 2011) often distinguish their accounts from Moore\u2019s in a number\nof ways, but few if any would dispute that Moore\u2019s account is a\nparadigmatically non-naturalist one.\n\n\nNonetheless, simply characterizing non-naturalism in terms of\nMoore\u2019s view is not very helpful for at least three reasons. First, we\nstill need some way of determining which dimensions of similarity to\nMoore\u2019s views are the relevant ones. This is a standard problem with\ntrying to understand a genus in terms of a particularly salient species\nthereof. Second, Moore defended a variety of theses about goodness in\nPrincipia which have been referred to as forms of\nnon-naturalism, so we are then left with the question what these views\nhave in common in virtue of which they are all forms of non-naturalism.\nThird, Moore\u2019s non-naturalist account of goodness in Principia\nis itself unclear in certain crucial respects. Indeed, his later \u201cReply\nto My Critics,\u201d Moore himself admitted that his attempts in\nPrincipia to explain in what sense goodness was a non-natural\nproperty were untenable (Moore 1942: 582). Nonetheless, Moore\u2019s account\nin Principia is important to bear in mind when trying to\ncharacterize non-naturalism in meta-ethics. For a plausible constraint\non any such characterization is that it not imply that Moore clearly\ndid not put forward a form of non-naturalism in Principia.\nWith this constraint in hand, we are in a position to develop a more\ngeneral characterization of non-naturalism.\n\n\nVery roughly, non-naturalism in meta-ethics is the idea that moral\nphilosophy is fundamentally autonomous from the natural sciences. More\naccurately, a family of related but distinct doctrines has gone under\nthe heading \u2018non-naturalism\u2019. In some contexts,\n\u2018non-naturalism\u2019 denotes the semantic thesis that moral\npredicates cannot be analyzed in non-normative terms (see Shaver 2000\nand Gibbard 2002: 153). In other contexts, \u2018non-naturalism\u2019\ndenotes the epistemological thesis that knowledge of basic moral\nprinciples and value judgements are in some sense self-evident (see\nFrankena 1963: 85\u201386). However, this view (which some self-styled naturalists would actually accept) is more often and more usefully referred to as\n\u2018intuitionism\u2019 and I shall henceforth also refer to it as\nsuch. Most often, \u2018non-naturalism\u2019 denotes the\nmetaphysical thesis that moral properties exist and are not identical\nwith or reducible to any natural property or properties in some\ninteresting sense of \u2018natural\u2019. However, just which sense\nof \u2018natural\u2019 is most apt in this context is highly\ncontroversial and I shall return to this point shortly. Understood in\nthis way, non-naturalism is a form of moral realism and is opposed to\nnon-cognitivist positions according to which moral utterances serve to\nexpress non-cognitive attitudes rather than beliefs that provide their\ntruth conditions and is also opposed to error-theoretical positions\naccording to which there are no moral facts. Moreover, each of these\ndifferent conceptions of non-naturalism bears interesting relations of\nsupport to the others. For example, a prima facie plausible explanation\nof the alleged immunity of moral predicates from analysis in\nnon-normative terms (non-naturalism in the first sense) would be that\nmoral predicates denote non-natural properties (which entails\nnon-naturalism in the third sense). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Moore\naccepted non-naturalism in all three of these senses. Because\nnon-naturalism is far more often understood in the third of these three\nways I shall henceforth use \u2018non-naturalism\u2019 with the third\nof these three meanings unless otherwise noted.\n\n\nIt is also sometimes suggested that non-naturalism is the thesis\nthat moral properties are sui generis and irreducible (see,\ne.g. Pigden 1993: 421\u2013422), and indeed this is one of the most\ndistinctive aspects of Moore\u2019s account of goodness. However, this is\nnot the best way to understand non-naturalism. For intuitively whether\na property is natural is orthogonal to whether it is sui\ngeneris. We should preserve conceptual space for properties that\nare natural and irreducible (fundamental properties of physics are\nperhaps the least controversial examples, but many would argue that the\nfundamental properties of psychology and sociology are also irreducible\nbut natural) as well as properties that are non-natural but reducible\nto other non-natural properties (perhaps rightness is reducible to\ngoodness or vice versa even if both are non-natural). Indeed, Moore\nhimself was at one stage a non-naturalist about rightness but\nnonetheless thought that rightness was reducible to the property of\nbeing the action with the best outcome, though he later abandoned this\nview. Furthermore, a number of self-styled contemporary naturalists\nhold that moral properties are both natural and irreducible (Richard\nMiller and Nicholas Sturgeon, for example) and we\nshould try to accommodate this characterization of their view. In\nPrincipia Moore often (though not always \u2013 he considers\nthe example of yellowness) seems to ignore the fact that a property\nmight be both natural and irreducible.  Undoubtedly this has led to\nsome confusion in later discussions of naturalism and non-naturalism\n(for useful discussion of Moore on this point, see Baldwin 1990:\n83\u201384).\n\n\nPerhaps the most vexing problem for any general characterization of\nnon-naturalism is the bewildering array of ways in which the\ndistinction between natural and non-natural properties has been drawn.\nNatural properties have variously been characterized as properties that\n(i) are the subject matter of the natural sciences (Moore 1903: 40),\n(ii) are invoked in scientific explanations (Little 1994: 226), (iii)\nwould be identified by the best scientific theory and can be described\nin conceptual terms available to a being occupying a non-local point of\nview on the world (Crisp 1996: 117), (iv) can be known only a\nposteriori (Copp 2002, Moore 1903: 39), (v) can exist by themselves in\ntime (Moore 1903: 41), (vi) confer causal powers (Lewis 1983), (vii)\nfigure in the laws of nature (Vallentyne 1998), or (viii) explains\nsimilarity relations (Lewis 1983), e.g. why a black cat is more similar\nto a white cat than to a black dog. The first four of these\ncharacterizations are epistemological, and three of those four are cast\nexplicitly in terms of scientific inquiry; the remaining three are\nmetaphysical.\n\n\nSome of these characterizations can be put to one side rather\neasily. For example, the thesis that natural properties must be capable\nof existing by themselves in time [(v) above] seems to make the very\nidea of a natural property deeply problematic. As C.D. Broad argued\n(see Broad 1942), it is unclear how the roundness and brownness of a\npenny, for example, could exist in time by themselves. In light of this\nobjection, Moore himself eventually abandoned this way of\ncharacterizing natural properties (Moore 1942: 581\u2013582). Understanding\nnatural properties as those studied by the natural sciences [(i) above]\nthreatens to make our characterization of the natural implausibly\ndependent on what the actual objects of scientific investigation happen\nto be, as if there could not be natural properties our actual\nscientific investigation somehow never discovered. It also makes it\nunclear why moral philosophy is not one of the sciences (Baldwin 1985:\n26). We could try to finesse this point by holding that natural\nproperties need not actually be the subject matter of the natural\nsciences but instead only must be fit for investigation by the natural\nsciences but this characterization is simply not very illuminating. For\nit cries out for a characterization of what makes something fit for\nstudy by the natural sciences, and that further characterization seems\nlikely to do all the work in explaining what is involved in a property\nbeing natural.\n\n\nSo we can narrow down the list of candidate ways of characterizing\nthe natural/non-natural distinction. Still, it would be very difficult\nand perhaps impossible to determine just which of the remaining\ncharacterizations of natural properties would provide \u201cthe\u201d best way of\ncharacterizing the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism in\nmeta-ethics. More likely, there are advantages and disadvantages to\neach of the remaining taxonomies on offer. Moreover, which\nunderstanding of the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism\nis the most helpful will vary depending on the context and indeed on\none\u2019s more substantive philosophical commitments. I shall therefore not\nhere undertake the fool\u2019s errand of privileging one particular way of\nmaking the distinction between natural and non-natural properties.\nInstead I shall simply try to indicate in the discussion of the\narguments for and against non-naturalism where these differences might\nmatter.\n",
