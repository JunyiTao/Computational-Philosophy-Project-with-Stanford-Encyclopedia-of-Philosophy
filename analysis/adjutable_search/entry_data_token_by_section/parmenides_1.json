    "main_text": "Overview of Parmenides\u2019 Poem || The Proem\n2.1 The Proem\n\nParmenides\u2019 poem began with a proem describing a journey he\nfiguratively once made to the abode of a goddess. He described how he\nwas conveyed on \u201cthe far-fabled path of the divinity\u201d (fr.\n1.3) in a chariot by a team of mares and how the maiden daughters of\nHelios, the sun-god, led the way. These maidens take Parmenides to\nwhence they themselves have come, to \u201cthe halls of Night\u201d\n(fr. 1.9), before which stand \u201cthe gates of the paths of night\nand day\u201d (fr. 1.11). The maidens gently persuade Justice,\nguardian of these gates, to open them so that Parmenides himself may\npass through to the abode within. Parmenides thus describes how the\ngoddess who dwells there welcomed him upon his arrival:\n\nAnd the goddess received me kindly, and in her hand she took / my\nright hand, and she spoke and addressed me thus: / \u201cO young man,\naccompanied by immortal charioteers / and mares who bear you as you\narrive at our abode, / welcome, since a fate by no means ill sent you\nahead to travel / this way (for surely it is far from the track of\nhumans), / but Right and Justice.\u201d (Fr. 1.22\u201328a)\n\n\nParmenides\u2019 proem is no epistemological allegory of\nenlightenment but a topographically specific description of a mystical\njourney to the halls of Night. In Hesiod, the \u201chorrible dwelling\nof dark Night\u201d (Th. 744) is where the goddesses Night\nand Day alternately reside as the other traverses the sky above the\nEarth. Both Parmenides\u2019 and Hesiod\u2019s conception of this\nplace have their precedent in the Babylonian mythology of the sun\ngod\u2019s abode. This abode also traditionally served as a place of\njudgment, and this fact tends to confirm that when Parmenides\u2019\ngoddess tells him that no ill fate has sent him ahead to this place\n(fr. 1.26\u201327a), she is indicating that he has miraculously\nreached the place to which travel the souls of the dead.\n\nIn the proem, then, Parmenides casts himself in the role of an\ninitiate into the kind of mysteries that were during his day part of\nthe religious milieu of Magna Graecia. The motif of the initiate is\nimportant, for it informs Parmenides\u2019 portrayal of himself as\none whose encounter with a major divinity has yielded a special\nknowledge or wisdom. The divinity in this instance would seem to be\nNight herself: Parmenides goes to \u201cthe halls of Night\u201d\n(fr. 1.9), and the goddess who greets him welcomes him to \u201cour\nhome\u201d (fr. 1.25). The goddess Night serves as counselor to Zeus\nin some of the major Orphic cosmologies, including the Derveni\ncosmology (col. XI.10). In the closely related Orphic\nRhapsodies, Night instructs Zeus on how to preserve the unity\nproduced by his absorption of all things into himself as he sets about\ninitiating a new cosmogonic phase. It is thus appropriate that Night\nshould be the source of Parmenides\u2019 revelation, for Parmenidean\nmetaphysics is very much concerned with the principle of unity in the\ncosmos.\n",
