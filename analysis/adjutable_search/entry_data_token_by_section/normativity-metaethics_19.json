    "main_text": "Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity || Explaining Normativity via Categorical requirements\n4.6 Explaining Normativity via Categorical requirements\n\nA similar problem arises for attempts to explain normativity in terms\nof the idea of a categorical requirement of rationality. There is a\nstandardly accepted distinction between hypothetical requirements and\ncategorical ones (Kant 1785 [1981]). Hypothetical requirements\nare, roughly, requirements that are grounded in, or hold in virtue of,\nthe contingent desires or attitudes of the agent who is so required.\nAn example might be the requirement to maintain your car, which\npresumably presupposes that you want your car to continue running.\nCategorical requirements have no such presupposition. It might seem\nthat any genuinely robust normative requirement would be categorical,\nsince all other requirements depend on, and so are hostage to, facts\nabout person\u2019s contingent psychology.\n\nThe challenge is to explain the nature of, and the grounding of, these\ncategorical requirements. If we try to explain this in terms of what\none could rationally will to serve as requirements incumbent on all\nagents, or in terms of what one could rationally will everyone to do,\nwe run up against the same problem as afflicted the account that\ninvokes the idea of self-legislation, which we just discussed. A\nnormative naturalist might propose a naturalistic explanation of\ncategorical requirements but would need to take a very different\napproach (see Copp 2015)\n",
