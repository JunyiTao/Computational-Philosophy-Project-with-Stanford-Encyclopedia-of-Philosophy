The starting point of this approach is\nthe notion that much of human reasoning, including probabilistic and\ncausal reasoning as well as problem solving takes place through mental\nmodeling rather than through the application of logic or\nmethodological criteria to a set of propositions (Johnson-Laird 1983;\nMagnani et al. 1999; Magnani and Nersessian 2002). In model-based\nreasoning, the mind constructs a structural representation of a\nreal-world or imaginary situation and manipulates this structure. In\nthis perspective, conceptual structures are viewed as models and\nconceptual innovation as constructing new models through various\nmodeling operations. Analogical reasoning\u2014analogical\nmodeling\u2014is regarded as one of three main forms of model-based\nreasoning that appear to be relevant for conceptual innovation in\nscience. Besides analogical modeling, visual modeling and simulative\nmodeling or thought experiments also play key roles (Nersessian 1992,\n1999, 2009). These modeling practices are constructive in that they\naid the development of novel mental models. The key elements of\nmodel-based reasoning are the call on knowledge of generative\nprinciples and constraints for physical models in a source domain and\nthe use of various forms of abstraction. Conceptual innovation results\nfrom the creation of new concepts through processes that abstract and\nintegrate source and target domains into new models (Nersessian\n2009).\n\nSome critics have argued that despite the large amount of work on the\ntopic, the notion of mental model is not sufficiently clear. Thagard\nseeks to clarify the concept by characterizing mental models in terms\nof neural processes (Thagard 2010). In his approach, mental models are\nproduced through complex patterns of neural firing, whereby the\nneurons and the interconnections between them are dynamic and\nchanging. A pattern of firing neurons is a representation when there\nis a stable causal correlation between the pattern or activation and\nthe thing that is represented. In this research, questions about the\nnature of model-based reasoning are transformed into questions about\nthe brain mechanisms that produce mental representations.\n\nThe above sections again show that the study of scientific discovery\nintegrates different approaches, combining conceptual analysis of\nprocesses of knowledge generation with empirical work on creativity,\ndrawing heavily and explicitly on current research in psychology and\ncognitive science, and on in vivo laboratory observations, as\nwell as brain imaging techniques (Kounios & Beeman 2009, Thagard\n& Stewart 2011).\n",
