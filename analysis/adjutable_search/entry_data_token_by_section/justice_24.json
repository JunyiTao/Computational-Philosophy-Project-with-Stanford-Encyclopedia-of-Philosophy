    "main_text": "Egalitarianism and Justice || Responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism\n6.2 Responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism\n\nAs noted above, justice as simple equality of treatment seems open to\nthe objection that it fails to acknowledge the agency of the\nrecipients, who may have acted in ways that appear to qualify them to\nreceive more (or less) of whatever benefit is being distributed. To\nanswer this objection, several recent philosophers have presented\nalternative versions of \u2018responsibility-sensitive\negalitarianism\u2019 \u2013 a family of theories of justice that\ntreat equal distribution as a starting point but allow for departures\nfrom that baseline when these result from the responsible choices made\nby individuals (see Knight and Stemplowska 2011 for examples). These\ntheories differ along several dimensions: the \u2018currency of\njustice\u2019 used to define the baseline of equality, the conditions\nthat must be fulfilled for a choice to qualify as responsible, and\nwhich among the consequences that follow from a choice should count\nwhen the justice of an outcome is being assessed (it may in particular\nappear unjust to allow people to suffer the full consequences of bad\nchoices that they could not reasonably have anticipated). The label\nthat is often used to describe a sub-class of these theories is\n\u2018luck egalitarianism\u2019. According to luck egalitarians,\njustice requires that no-one should be disadvantaged relative to\nothers on account of \u2018brute\u2019 bad luck, whereas\ninequalities that arise through the exercise of personal\nresponsibility are permissible (for a full discussion of luck\negalitarianism, see the entry on\n justice and bad luck).\n \u2018Brute\u2019 luck is interpreted widely to include not only\nexternal circumstances such as one person\u2019s initially having\naccess to more resources than another, but also internal factors such\nas possessing natural abilities or disabilities, or having\ninvoluntarily acquired expensive tastes. All such inequalities are to\nbe ironed out by redistribution or compensation, while people\u2019s\nchoices about how to use the assets they are granted should be\nrespected, even if this leads to significant inequality in the long\nrun.\n\nLuck egalitarianism has proved surprisingly influential in recent\ndebates on justice, despite the evident difficulties involved in, for\nexample, quantifying \u2018brute luck disadvantage\u2019 in such a\nway that a compensatory scheme could be established. There are,\nhowever, a number of problems it has to face. By giving scope to\npersonal responsibility, it seeks to capture what is perhaps the most\nattractive part of the conventional idea of desert \u2013 that people\nshould be rewarded for making good choices and penalised for making\nbad ones \u2013 while filtering out the effects of having\n(undeserved) natural talents. But in reality the choices that people\nmake are influenced by the talents and other qualities that they\nhappen to have already. So if we allow someone to reap advantages by,\nfor example, devoting long hours to learning to play the piano at a\nhigh level, we must recognize that this is a choice that she would\nalmost certainly not have made unless early experiment showed that she\nwas musically gifted. We cannot say what she would have chosen to do\nin a counterfactual world in which she was tone deaf. There seems then\nto be no coherent half-way house between accepting full-blooded desert\nand denying that people can justly claim relative advantage through\nthe exercise of responsibility and choice (see further Miller 1999,\nch. 7) .\n\nA second problem is that one person\u2019s exercise of responsibility\nmay prove advantageous or disadvantageous to others, even though they\nhave done nothing to bring this change about, so from their point of\nview it must count as \u2018brute\u2019 luck. This will be true, for\nexample, in any case in which people are competing to excel in some\nfield, where successful choices made by A will worsen the\ncomparative position of B, C, and D. Or again, if\nA acts in a way that benefits B, but does nothing\ncomparable to improve the position of C and D, then an\ninequality is created that counts as \u2018brute bad luck\u2019 from\nthe perspective of the latter. One of the most influential exponents\nof luck egalitarianism seems to have recognized the problem in a late\nessay: \u2018unlike plain egalitarianism, luck egalitarianism\nis paradoxical, because the use of shares by people is\nbound to lead to a distribution flecked by luck\u2019 (Cohen\n2011, p. 142).\n",
