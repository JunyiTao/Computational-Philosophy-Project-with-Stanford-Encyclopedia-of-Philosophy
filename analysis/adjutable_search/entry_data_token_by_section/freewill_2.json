    "main_text": "The Nature of Free Will || Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n2.1 Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n\nAs should be clear from this short discussion of the history of the\nidea of free will, free will has traditionally been conceived of as a\nkind of power to control one\u2019s choices and actions. When an\nagent exercises free will over her choices and actions, her choices\nand actions are up to her. But up to her in what sense? As\nshould be clear from our historical survey, two common (and\ncompatible) answers are: (i) up to her in the sense that she is able\nto choose otherwise, or at minimum that she is able not to choose or\nact as she does, and (ii) up to her in the sense that she is the\nsource of her action. However, there is widespread controversy both\nover whether each of these conditions is required for free will and if\nso, how to understand the kind or sense of freedom to do otherwise or\nsourcehood that is required. While some seek to resolve these\ncontroversies in part by careful articulation of our experiences of\ndeliberation, choice, and action (Nozick 1981, ch. 4; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 1), many seek to resolve these\ncontroversies by appealing to the nature of moral responsibility. The\nidea is that the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness involved in\nfree will is the kind of control or sense of up-to-meness relevant to\nmoral responsibility (Double 1992, 12; Ekstrom 2000, 7\u20138;\nSmilansky 2000, 16; Widerker and McKenna 2003, 2; Vargas 2007, 128;\nNelkin 2011, 151\u201352; Levy 2011, 1; Pereboom 2014, 1\u20132).\nIndeed, some go so far as to define \u2018free will\u2019 as\n\u2018the strongest control condition\u2014whatever that turns out\nto be\u2014necessary for moral responsibility\u2019 (Wolf 1990,\n3\u20134; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele 2006, 17). Given this connection, we\ncan determine whether the freedom to do otherwise and the power of\nself-determination are constitutive of free will and, if so, in what\nsense, by considering what it takes to be a morally responsible agent.\nOn these latter characterizations of free will, understanding free\nwill is inextricably linked to, and perhaps even derivative from,\nunderstanding moral responsibility. And even those who demur from this\nclaim regarding conceptual priority typically see a close link between\nthese two ideas. Consequently, to appreciate the current debates\nsurrounding the nature of free will, we need to say something about\nthe nature of moral responsibility.\n\nIt is now widely accepted that there are different species of moral\nresponsibility. It is common (though not uncontroversial) to\ndistinguish moral responsibility as answerability from moral\nresponsibility as attributability from moral responsibility\nas accountability (Watson 1996; Fischer and Tognazzini 2011;\nShoemaker 2011. See Smith (2012) for a critique of this taxonomy).\nThese different species of moral responsibility differ along three\ndimensions: (i) the kind of responses licensed toward the responsible\nagent, (ii) the nature of the licensing relation, and (iii) the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for licensing the relevant kind of\nresponses toward the agent. For example, some argue that when an agent\nis morally responsible in the attributability sense, certain\njudgments about the agent\u2014such as judgments concerning\nthe virtues and vices of the agent\u2014are fitting, and\nthat the fittingness of such judgments does not depend on whether the\nagent in question possessed the freedom to do otherwise (cf. Watson\n1996).\n\nWhile keeping this controversy about the nature of moral\nresponsibility firmly in mind (see the entry on\n moral responsibility\n for a more detailed discussion of these issues), we think it is fair\nto say that the most commonly assumed understanding of moral\nresponsibility in the historical and contemporary discussion of the\nproblem of free will is moral responsibility as\naccountability in something like the following sense:\n\nAn agent \\(S\\) is morally accountable for performing an action\n\\(\\phi\\) \\(=_{df.}\\) \\(S\\) deserves praise if \\(\\phi\\) goes beyond\nwhat can be reasonably expected of \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) deserves blame if\n\\(\\phi\\) is morally wrong.\n\nThe central notions in this definition are praise,\nblame, and desert. The majority of contemporary\nphilosophers have followed Strawson (1962) in contending that praising\nand blaming an agent consist in experiencing (or at least being\ndisposed to experience (cf. Wallace 1994, 70\u201371)) reactive\nattitudes or emotions directed toward the agent, such as gratitude,\napprobation, and pride in the case of praise, and resentment,\nindignation, and guilt in the case of blame. (See Sher (2006) and\nScanlon (2008) for important dissents from this trend. See the entry\non\n blame\n for a more detailed discussion.) These emotions, in turn, dispose us\nto act in a variety of ways. For example, blame disposes us to respond\nwith some kind of hostility toward the blameworthy agent, such as\nverbal rebuke or partial withdrawal of good will. But while these\nkinds of dispositions are essential to our blaming someone, their\nmanifestation is not: it is possible to blame someone with very little\nchange in attitudes or actions toward the agent. Blaming someone might\nbe immediately followed by forgiveness as an end of the matter.\n\nBy \u2018desert\u2019, we have in mind what Derk Pereboom has called\nbasic desert:\n\n\nThe desert at issue here is basic in the sense that the agent would\ndeserve to be blamed or praised just because she has performed the\naction, given an understanding of its moral status, and not, for\nexample, merely by virtue of consequentialist or contractualist\nconsiderations. (2014, 2)\n\n\nAs we understand desert, if an agent deserves blame, then we have a\nstrong pro tanto reason to blame him simply in virtue of his\nbeing accountable for doing wrong. Importantly, these reasons can be\noutweighed by other considerations. While an agent may deserve blame,\nit might, all things considered, be best to forgive him\nunconditionally instead.\n\nWhen an agent is morally responsible for doing something wrong, he is\nblameworthy: he deserves hard treatment marked by resentment\nand indignation and the actions these emotions dispose us toward, such\nas censure, rebuke, and ostracism. However, it would seem unfair to\ntreat agents in these ways unless their actions were up to\nthem. Thus, we arrive at the core connection between free will\nand moral responsibility: agents deserve praise or blame only if their\nactions are up to them\u2014only if they have free will.\nConsequently, we can assess analyses of free will by their\nimplications for judgments of moral responsibility. We note that some\nmight reject the claim that free will is necessary for moral\nresponsibility (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; Stump 1988), but even for these\ntheorists an adequate analysis of free will must specify a\nsufficient condition for the kind of control at play in moral\nresponsibility.\n\nIn what follows, we focus our attention on the two most commonly cited\nfeatures of free will: the freedom to do otherwise and sourcehood.\nWhile some seem to think that free will consists exclusively in either\nthe freedom to do otherwise (van Inwagen 2008) or in sourcehood\n(Zagzebski 2000), many philosophers hold that free will involves both\nconditions\u2014though philosophers often emphasize one condition\nover the other depending on their dialectical situation or\nargumentative purposes (cf. Watson 1987). In what follows, we will\ndescribe the most common characterizations of these two\nconditions.\n",
