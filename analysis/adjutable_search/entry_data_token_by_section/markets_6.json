Central among these are property\nrights and the legal institutions needed for enforcing\n contracts.[9]\n The question of enforceable property rights plays as an important\nrole for evaluating markets in countries with weak governance\nstructures. There, the ability to enforce one\u2019s rights can be\ndistributed very unequally, so that free markets can exacerbate these\nprevious injustices. The question of which property rights can be\nenforced is one of the main determinants (apart from outright bans) of\nwhich markets can exist in a society. For example, in most countries\none cannot sell oneself into slavery, as courts of law would not\nenforce such a contract. An area where this question about property\nrights and hence marketability is fiercely contested are intellectual\nproperty rights, where some people argue that our traditional notions\nof property rights are not suitable for goods that can be reproduced\nat extremely low costs, such as digital contents (e.g., Shiffrin 2007;\nBoutang 2011, ch. 4).\n\nWhile the existence of property rights \u2013 and hence of a minimal\nstate that enforces them \u2013 has been recognized as a precondition\nfor markets even by most libertarian thinkers, other preconditions are\noften not made explicit in economic approaches to markets, and are\nmore controversial. As has been emphasized in particular by the\nmembers of the German \u201cFreiburg School\u201d of\n\u201cordoliberalism\u201d, for markets to remain competitive there\nneed to be anti-trust laws that prevent cartels and monopolies (see\ne.g., Eucken 1939; on how this view was replaced by more\nthorough-going laissez-faire views in the US see Crouch 2011, ch. 3).\nSociologists have long pointed out the crucial importance of trust for\nthe existence of market exchanges, as contracts in markets often\ninclude implicit elements that cannot be spelled out in terms of\nproperty rights and hence not be legally enforced (see e.g., the\nclassic account by Durkheim 1997 [1893] or more recently Beckert\n2002). Certain forms of social ethos, e.g., a commitment to keep\npromises, can facilitate market transactions (Rose 2011). Research in\neconomic sociology also puts emphasis on the dependence of markets on\nother social relations. For example, Granovetter shows how market\nrelations are often embedded in personal relationships, such as the\nrelationships between the experts for certain technologies in\ndifferent companies (1985). Fligstein emphasizes how the rules set by\nstates, including, for example, rules about governance structures and\nother regulatory institutions, influence the behavior of companies in\nmarkets and make markets \u201ca social construction that reflect the\nunique political-cultural construction of their firms and\nnations\u201d (1996, 670; on the \u201clegal construction\u201d of\nfinancial markets see Pistor 2013). Some sociologists, notably Callon,\nalso argue that markets depend on the performative power of economic\ntheories about what markets are: these help individuals to frame\nsituations as market exchanges (e.g., 1998). For example,\nMacKenzie argues that market participants in certain financial markets\nuse theoretical models to determine their own behavior (e.g., 2009).\nSuch examples make particularly clear that the markets we know are not\nsomething independently \u201cgiven\u201d, but depend on other norms\nand institutions in society, and sometimes even on certain forms of\ninformation technology. Even the ability of markets to deal with\ndecentralized knowledge (Hayek 1945) often works in conjunction with\n\u201cepistemic infrastructures\u201d for markets provided by other private\nor public institutions (Herzog 2020). \n",
