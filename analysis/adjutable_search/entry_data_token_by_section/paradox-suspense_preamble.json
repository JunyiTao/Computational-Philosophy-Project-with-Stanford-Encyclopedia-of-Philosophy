    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe ultimate success of Hollywood blockbusters is dependent upon \nrepeat viewings. Fans return to theaters to see films multiple times \nand buy DVDs so they can watch movies yet again. Although it is \nsomething of a received dogma in philosophy and psychology that \nsuspense requires uncertainty, many of the biggest box office \nsuccesses are action movies that fans claim to find suspenseful on \nrepeated viewings. The conflict between the theory of suspense and \nthe accounts of viewers generates a problem known as the paradox \nof suspense, which we can boil down to a simple question: If \nsuspense requires uncertainty, how can a viewer who knows the outcome\nstill feel suspense? \n\n\nThere is a related problem concerning \u201cmusical suspense\u201d: How can one\ncan feel suspense in response to sonic movements with which one is \nintimately acquainted? Unlike paradigmatic suspense, musical suspense\nis typically unaccompanied by fear. Accordingly, it is better \ndescribed as mere tension. Given the controversy over the nature of \nthe response to music, this entry will deal solely with the paradox of\nsuspense in regard to narrative artworks. \n\n\nI will consider four different solutions to the paradox of suspense: \n(1) the thought theory of entertained uncertainty, (2) the \ndesire-frustration theory of suspense, (3) the \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory, and (4) the emotional \nmisidentification view. The thought theory of entertained \nuncertainty explains the paradox by denying that actual \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense; instead, all that is required \nis for viewers to engage the fiction as they normally \nwould\u2014entertaining thoughts of the story as if they were \nundecided. The desire-frustration theory holds that \nuncertainty, entertained or actual, is not necessary for suspense. To\ncreate suspense, one merely needs to frustrate a desire to affect the\noutcome of an imminent event. The moment-by-moment forgetting \nview is the position that while viewers are immersed in a fictional \nscenario, they effectively cannot remember the outcome. The \nemotional misidentification view holds that it is impossible \nfor viewers who know the outcome to feel suspense, and the best \nexplanation of the claims of audiences to the contrary is that \nviewers must be confusing their actual fear and anxiety with what \nthey take to be suspense. \n\n\nRather than provide an exhaustive survey of the literature on \nsuspense, in what follows I discuss representatives of the four types\nof solutions to the paradox. I begin with a description of the \nparadox of suspense and then explain which claims the various \nsolutions reject. \n",
