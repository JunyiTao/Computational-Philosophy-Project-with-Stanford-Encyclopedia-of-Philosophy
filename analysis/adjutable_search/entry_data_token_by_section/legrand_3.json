    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Ethics\n\nLe Grand\u2019s early ethical and political writings are not\nCartesian. In Le Sage des Sto\u00efques, ou l\u2019Homme sans\nPassions, Selon les Sentiments de S\u00e9n\u00e8que (1662),\nlater translated and published as Man Without Passions\n(1675), he expounds the Stoical doctrines of Seneca, for which the\ngoal of the moral person is to expunge the passions. He later rejected\nthis view of the passions and argued the Cartesian view that the\npassions ought to be trained (not expunged) in the moral life. Le\nGrand also wrote a curious political treatise, Scydromedia\n(1669), which is a semi-fictional, utopian work describing his vision\nof the ideal state.\n\nThere is nothing innovative in Le Grand\u2019s moral theory, yet his\ndiscussions are rich with references to ancient and contemporary\ntheories. He borrows from the ancient Atomists, the Stoics, the\nScholastics, and the \u201cMoralists\u201d of his time, and frames\nit, where possible, in Cartesian terms. Le Grand acknowledges that\nDescartes himself wrote little on ethics, but he argues that\nDescartes\u2019s treatment of the soul and the passions provides a\nsolid foundation for the treatment of moral matters. According to Le\nGrand, the object of ethics is right reason, its end is the perfection\nof man, and it is an active not a speculative science. An example of\nhis reconciling project can be seen in Book I, Part X of his\nEntire Body of Philosophy (1694), where Le Grand attempted to\nreconcile the doctrines of Seneca and Epicurus on the role of pleasure\nin the virtuous life, by drawing on Descartes\u2019s theory of the\npassions. (1694, p. 347) He argues that pleasure has a role to play in\nthe moral life, since virtue depends on free will (as the Stoics held)\nand pleasure derives from the satisfaction of the mind in possessing\nthe good (as Epicurus held). What Descartes\u2019s theory provided\nwas an explanation of how pleasure (a passion) could aid the will in\nchoosing the right course of action, while maintaining the voluntary\nnature of the will and virtue.\n\nIn summary, Le Grand is worthy of study for his contribution to the\nreception and development of Cartesianism in the latter half of the\nseventeenth century. He expanded the application of Descartes\u2019s\nnatural philosophy to a variety of observations and experiments of his\nday, and advanced Descartes\u2019s ideas regarding the mechanization\nof nature, the causal interaction and union of minds and bodies, the\nnature of representation and truth, and in the realm of morals, how\nDescartes\u2019s theory of the passions provides an important account\nof virtue. No less important is the fact that he spent most of his\nlife in England, where his contact with members of the Royal Society\nand the universities of Cambridge and Oxford had a lasting impact on\nthe reception of Descartes\u2019s ideas in England, Germany, and\nFrance.\n",
