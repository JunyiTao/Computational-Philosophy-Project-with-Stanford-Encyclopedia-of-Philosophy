    "main_text": "Reliabilism and the Meno Problem\n2. Reliabilism and the Meno Problem\n\nThe first contemporary wave of work on the value problem largely\nconcerned whether this problem raised a distinctive difficulty for\nreliabilist accounts of knowledge\u2014i.e., those views which\nessentially define knowledge as reliably-formed true belief. In\nparticular, the claim was that reliabilism was unable to offer an\nanswer even to the primary value problem.\n\nA fairly clear statement of what is at issue here is given in a number\nof places by Linda Zagzebski (e.g., 2003a; cf. DePaul 1993; Zagzebski\n1996; Jones 1997; Swinburne 1999, 2000; Riggs 2002a; Kvanvig 2003;\nSosa 2007: ch. 4; Carter & Jarvis 2012). To begin with, Zagzebski\nargues that the reliability of the process by which something is\nproduced does not automatically add value to that thing, and thus that\nit cannot be assumed that the reliability of the process by which a\ntrue belief is produced will add value to that true belief. In defense\nof this claim, she offers the analogy of a cup of coffee. She claims\nthat a good cup of coffee which is produced by a reliable coffee\nmachine\u2014i.e., one that regularly produces good cups of\ncoffee\u2014is of no more value than an equally good cup of coffee\nthat is produced by an unreliable coffee machine.\n\nFurthermore, as this line of objection goes, true belief is in the\nrelevant respects like coffee: a true belief formed via a reliable\nbelief-forming process is no more valuable than a true belief formed\nvia an unreliable belief-forming process. In both cases, the value of\nthe reliability of the process accrues in virtue of its tendency to\nproduce a certain valuable effect (good coffee/true belief), but this\nmeans that where the effect has been produced\u2014where one has a\ngood cup of coffee or a true belief\u2014then the value of the\nproduct is no greater for having been produced in a reliable way.\n\nElsewhere in the literature (e.g., Kvanvig 2003), this problem has\nbeen called the \u201cswamping problem\u201d, on account of how the\nvalue of true belief \u2018swamps\u2019 the value of the true belief\nbeing produced in a reliable (i.e., truth-conducive) way. So\nexpressed, the moral of the problem seems to be that where\nreliabilists go awry is by treating the value of the process as being\nsolely captured by the reliability of the process\u2014i.e., its\ntendency to produce the desired effect. Since the value of the effect\nswamps the value of the reliability of the process by which the effect\nwas achieved, this means that reliabilism has no resources available\nto it to explain why knowledge is more valuable than true belief.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not clear that this is a problem that is specific\nto reliabilism. That is, it seems that if this is a bona fide\nproblem, then it will affect any account of the value of knowledge\nwhich has the same relevant features as reliabilism\u2014i.e., which\nregards the greater value of knowledge over true belief as\ninstrumental value, where the instrumental value in question is\nrelative to the valuable good of true belief. In particular, it will\naffect veritist proposals about epistemic value which treat\ntruth as the fundamental epistemic good.\u00a0See\u00a0Kvanvig (2003:\nCh. 3)\u00a0for discussion of how internalist approaches to epistemic\njustification interface with the swamping problem;\u00a0see Pettigrew\n(2018) and Pritchard (2019) for responses to the swamping argument on\nbehalf of the veritist.\n\nFurthermore, as J. Adam Carter and Benjamin Jarvis (2012) have argued,\nthere are reasons to be suspicious of a key premise driving the\nswamping argument. The premise in question, which has been referred to\nas the \u201cSwamping Thesis\u201d (Pritchard 2011), states that if\nthe value of a property possessed by an item is instrumentally\nvaluable only relative to a further good, and that good is already\npresent in that item, then it can confer no additional value. Carter\nand Jarvis contend that one who embraces the Swamping Thesis should\nalso, by parity of reasoning, embrace a corollary thesis which they\ncall the Swamping Thesis Complement, according to which, if the value\nof a property possessed by an item is instrumentally valuable only\nrelative to a further good, and that good has already failed\nto be present in that item, then it can confer no additional value.\nHowever, as they argue, the Swamping Thesis and the Swamping Thesis\nComplement, along with other plausible premises, jointly entail the\nunpalatable conclusion that non-factive epistemic\nproperties\u2014most notably, justification\u2014are never\nepistemically valuable properties of a belief. See Dutant (2013) and\nBjelde (2020) for critical responses to Carter and Jarvis\u2019 line\nof reasoning and Sylvan (2018) for a separate challenge to the\nswamping argument, which rejects its tacit commitment to epistemic\ninstrumentalism (cf., Bjelde 2020). For an overview of the key moves\nof the argument, see Pritchard (2011).\n\nHowever, even granting the main elements of the swamping argument,\nthere are moves that the reliabilist can make in response (see, e.g.,\nGoldman & Olsson 2009; Olsson 2011; Bates 2013; Roush 2010; cf.\nBrown 2012; Davis, & J\u00e4ger 2012; Hovarth 2009; Piller 2009).\nFor example, it is surely open to the reliabilist to argue that the\ngreater instrumental value of reliable true belief over mere true\nbelief does not need to be understood purely in terms of instrumental\nvalue relative to the good of true belief. There could, for instance,\nbe all sorts of practical benefits of having a reliable true\nbelief which generate instrumental value. Indeed, it is worth noting\nthat the line of response to the Meno problem sketched by\nPlato, which we noted above, seems to specifically appeal to the\ngreater practical instrumental value of knowledge over mere true\nbelief.\n\nMoreover, there is reason to think that this objection will only at\nbest have an impact on process reliabilist\nproposals\u2014i.e., those views that treat all reliable\nbelief-forming processes as conferring a positive epistemic standing\non the beliefs so formed. For example, agent reliabilism\n(e.g., Greco 1999, 2000) might be thought to be untouched by this sort\nof argument. This is because, according to agent reliabilism, it is\nnot any sort of reliable process that confers positive epistemic\nstatus to belief, but only those processes that are stable features of\nthe agent\u2019s \u201ccognitive character\u201d. The main\nmotivation for this restriction on reliable processes is that it\nexcludes certain kinds of reliable but nonetheless strange and\nfleeting processes which notoriously cause problems for the view (such\nas processes where the reliability is due to some quirk in the\nsubject\u2019s environment, rather than because of any cognitive\ntrait possessed by the agent herself). Plausibly, however, one might\nargue that the reliable traits that make up an agent\u2019s cognitive\ncharacter have some value independently of the instrumental value they\npossess in virtue of being reliable\u2014i.e., that they have some\nfinal or intrinsic value. If this is right, then this opens up the\npossibility that agent-reliabilists can evade the problem noted for\npure reliabilists.\n\nZagzebski\u2019s diagnosis of what is motivating this problem for\nreliabilism seems, however, explicitly to exclude\nsuch a counter-response. She argues that what gives rise to this\ndifficulty is the fact that the reliabilist has signed up to a\n\u201cmachine-product model of belief\u201d\u2014see especially,\nZagzebski (2003a)\u2014where the product is external to the cause. It\nis not clear what exactly Zagzebski means by this point, but she\nthinks it shows that even where the reliable process is independently\nvaluable\u2014i.e., independently of its being reliable\u2014it\nstill doesn\u2019t follow that the value of the cause will transfer\nto add value to the effect. Here again the coffee analogy is appealed\nto: even if a reliable coffee machine were independently valuable, it\nwould not thereby confer additional value on a good cup of coffee.\n\nPerhaps the best way to evaluate the above line of argument is to\nconsider what is required in order to resolve the problem it\nposes. Perhaps what is needed is an \u2018internal\u2019 connection\nbetween product and cause, such as the kind of internal connection\nthat exists between an act and its motive which is highlighted by how\nwe explicitly evaluate actions in terms of the motives that led to\nthem (Zagzebski 2003a). On this picture, then, we are not to\nunderstand knowledge as a state consisting of a known belief, but\nrather as a state which consists of both the true belief and\nthe source from which that true belief was acquired. In short, then,\nthe problem with the machine-product model of belief is that it leads\nus to evaluate the state of the knowledge independently of the means\nby which the knowledge was acquired. If, in contrast, we have a\nconception of knowledge that incorporates into the very state of\nknowledge the way that the knowledge was acquired, we can avoid this\nproblem.\n\nOnce one effects this transition away from the machine-product model\nof belief, one can allow that the independent value of the reliable\nprocess can ensure that knowledge, by being produced in this way, is\nmore valuable than mere true belief (Zagzebski 2003a). In particular,\nif the process by which one gained the true belief is an epistemic\nvirtue\u2014a character trait which is both reliable and\nintrinsically valuable\u2014then this can ensure that the value of\nthe knowing state in this case is more valuable than any corresponding\nstate which simply consisted of a true belief.\n\nOther commentators in the virtue epistemology camp, broadly conceived,\nhave put forward similar suggestions. For example, Wayne Riggs (2002a)\nand Greco (e.g., 2003) have argued for a \u2018credit\u2019 version\nof virtue epistemology, according to which the agent, in virtue of\nbringing about the positively valuable outcome of a true belief, is\ndue credit as a result. Rather than treating the extra value of\nknowledge over true belief as deriving simply from the agent\u2019s\nattainment of the target true belief, however, Riggs and Greco instead\nargue that we should regard the agent\u2019s knowing as the state the\nagent is in when she is responsible for her true belief. Only in so\ndoing, they claim, can we answer the value problem. Jason Baehr\n(2012), by contrast with Riggs and Greco, has argued that credit\ntheories of knowledge do not answer the value problem but, rather,\n\u2018provide grounds for denying\u2019 (2012: 1) that knowledge has\nvalue over and above the value of true belief.\n\nInterestingly, however, other virtue epistemologists, most notably\nErnest Sosa (2003), have also advocated a \u2018credit\u2019 view,\nyet seem to stay within the machine-product picture of belief. That\nis, rather than analyze the state of knowing as consisting of both the\ntrue belief and its source, they regard the state of knowing as\ndistinct from the process, yet treat the fact that the process is\nintrinsically valuable as conferring additional value on any true\nbelief so produced. With Sosa\u2019s view in mind, it is interesting\nto ask just why we need to analyze knowledge in the way that Zagzebski\nand others suggest in order to get around the value problem.\n\nThe most direct way to approach this question is by considering\nwhether it is really true that a valuable cause cannot confer value on\nits effect where cause and effect are kept separate in the way that\nZagzebski claims is problematic in the case of knowledge. One\ncommentator who has objected to Zagzebski\u2019s argument by querying\nthis claim on her part is Berit Brogaard (2007; cf. Percival 2003;\nPritchard 2007: \u00a72), who claims that a valuable cause can indeed\nconfer value on its effect in the relevant cases. Brogaard claims that\nvirtue epistemologists like Zagzebski and Riggs endorse this claim\nbecause they adhere to what she calls a \u201cMoorean\u201d\nconception of value, on which if two things have the same intrinsic\nproperties, then they are equally valuable. Accordingly, if true\nbelief and knowledge have the same intrinsic properties (which is what\nwould be the case on the view of knowledge that they reject), it\nfollows that they must have the same value. Hence, it is crucial to\nunderstand knowledge as having distinct intrinsic properties from true\nbelief before one can hope to resolve the value problem.\n\nIf one holds that there is only intrinsic and instrumental value, then\nthis conception of value is compelling, since objects with the same\nintrinsic properties trivially have the same amount of intrinsic\nvalue, and they also plausibly have the same amount of instrumental\nvalue as well (at least in the same sort of environment). However, the\nMoorean conception of value is problematic because\u2014as Wlodek\nRabinowicz & Toni R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (1999, 2003) have\npointed out\u2014there seem to be objects which we value for their\nown sake but whose value derives from their being extrinsically\nrelated to something else that we value. That is, such objects are\nfinally\u2014i.e., non-instrumentally\u2014valuable without\nthereby being intrinsically valuable. For criticism of this account of\nfinal value, see Bradley (2002).\n\nThe standard example in this regard is Princess Diana\u2019s dress.\nThis would be regarded as more valuable than an exact replica simply\nbecause it belonged to Diana, which is clearly an extrinsic property\nof the object. Even though the extra value that accrues to the object\nis due to its extrinsic properties, however, it is still the case that\nthis dress is (properly) valued for its own sake, and thus valued\nnon-instrumentally.\n\nGiven that value of this sort is possible, then it follows that it\ncould well be the case that we value one true belief over another\nbecause of its extrinsic features\u2014i.e., that the one true\nbelief, but not the other, was produced by a reliable cognitive trait\nthat is independently valuable. For example, it could be that we value\nforming a true belief via a reliable cognitive trait more than a mere\ntrue belief because the former belief is produced in such a way that\nit is of credit to us that we believe the truth. There is thus a\ncrucial lacuna in Zagzebski\u2019s argument.\n\nA different response to the challenge that Zagzebski raises for\nreliabilism is given by Michael Brady (2006). In defense of\nreliabilism, Brady appeals to the idea that to be valuable is to be a\nfitting or appropriate object of positive evaluative attitudes, such\nas admiration or love (e.g., Brentano 1889 [1969]; Chisholm 1986;\nWiggins 1987; Gibbard 1990; Scanlon 1998). That one object is more\nvaluable than another is thus to be understood, on this view, in terms\nof the fact that that object is more worthy of positive evaluation.\nThus, the value problem for reliabilism on this conception of value\ncomes down to the question why knowledge is more worthy of positive\nevaluation on this view than mere true belief. Brady\u2019s\ncontention is that, at least within this axiological framework, it\nis possible for the reliabilist to offer a compelling story\nabout why reliable true belief\u2014and thus knowledge\u2014is more\nvaluable than mere true belief.\n\nCentral to Brady\u2019s argument is his claim that there are many\nways one can positively evaluate something, and thus many different\nways something can be valuable. Moreover, Brady argues that we can\ndistinguish active from passive evaluative\nattributes, where the former class of attitudes involve pursuit of the\ngood in question. For example, one might actively value the truth,\nwhere this involves, for instance, a striving to discover the truth.\nIn contrast, one might at other times merely passively value the\ntruth, such as simply respecting or contemplating it.\n\nWith this point in mind, Brady\u2019s central thesis is that on the\nreliabilist account knowledge is more valuable than true belief\nbecause certain active positive evaluative attitudes are fitting only\nwith regard to the former (i.e., reliable true belief). In particular,\ngiven its intrinsic features, reliable true belief is worthy of active\nlove, whereas an active love of unreliable (i.e., accidental) true\nbelief because of its intrinsic features would be entirely\ninappropriate because there is nothing that we can do to attain\nunreliable true belief that wouldn\u2019t conflict with love of\ntruth.\n\nThis is an intriguing proposal, which opens up a possible avenue of\ndefense against the kind of machine-product objection to reliabilism\nconsidered. One problem that such a move faces, however, is that it is\nunclear whether we can make sense of the distinction Brady draws\nbetween active and passive evaluative attitudes, at least in the\nepistemic sphere. When Brady talks of passive evaluative attitudes\ntowards the truth, he gives examples like contemplating, accepting,\nembracing, affirming, and respecting. Some of these attitudes are not\nclearly positive evaluative attitudes, however. Moreover, some of them\nare not obviously passive either. For example, is to contemplate the\ntruth really to evaluate it positively, rather than simply to\nconsider it? Furthermore, in accepting, affirming or embracing the\ntruth, isn\u2019t one actively positively evaluating the\ntruth? Wouldn\u2019t such evaluative attitudes manifest themselves in\nthe kind of practical action that Brady thinks is the mark of active\nevaluative attitudes? More needs to be said about this distinction\nbefore it can do the philosophical work that Brady has in mind.\n\nA further, albeit unorthodox, recent approach to the swamping problem\nis due to Carter and Rupert (2020). Carter and Rupert point out that\nextant approaches to the swamping problem suppose that if a solution\nis to be found, it will be at the personal level of description, the\nlevel at which states of subjects or agents, as such, appear. They\ntake exception to this orthodoxy, or at least to its unquestioned\nstatus. They maintain that from the empirically justified premise that\nsubpersonal states play a significant role in much epistemically\nrelevant cognition, we should expect that they constitute a domain in\nwhich we might reasonably expect to locate the \u201cmissing\nsource\u201d of epistemic value, beyond the value attached to mere\ntrue belief.\n",
