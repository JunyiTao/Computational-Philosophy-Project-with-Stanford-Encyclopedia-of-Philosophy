Temporal reasoning from antiquity to modern days\n\nDiscussions of temporality and reasoning about time go back to\nantiquity, and examples can be found even in the Bible (Boyd 2014).\nZeno\u2019s famous flying arrow paradox refers to the nature of time\nand broaches the corresponding notion of change. Much of the early\ntemporal discussion, however, centered around the problem of\nfuture contingents, that is, the question whether statements\nabout future events that are neither necessary nor impossible can have\ndefinite truth values. The most widely known and probably most cited\nexample is the sea-fight scenario discussed by Aristotle in On\nInterpretation (Chapter 9). Aristotle argued that statements such\nas \u201cThere will be a sea-fight tomorrow\u201d, as well as the\ncontrary prediction \u201cThere will not be a sea-fight\ntomorrow\u201d, do not hold of necessity and hence lack definite\ntruth values at present, while conceding that it is necessary that\neither there will be a sea-fight tomorrow or not. A few decades later,\nthe philosopher Diodorus Chronus demonstrated the problem of future\ncontingents in his famous Master Argument, which led him to\ndefine the possible as \u201cwhat is or will be the case\u201d. A\ndetailed discussion of Diodorus\u2019 argument is provided in e.g.\nRescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVII) and the entry on\n future contingents.\n\nPhilosophical discussions concerning time and the contingent future\ncontinued in the Middle Ages, where the theme was taken up by writers\nsuch as Peter Aureole, William of Ockham, and Luis Molina. In the\ncenter of focus here was the question how to reconcile God\u2019s\nforeknowledge with the idea of human freedom. Ockham, for example,\nembraced the idea of a true or actual future, holding that future\ncontingent statements are either true or false even though only God\nknows their truth values. According to Ockham, this is not to say,\nhowever, that future contingents are necessary, meaning that there are\nalternative possibilities for humans to choose from. Later, several\nphilosophers and logicians engaged in the problem of relating\ntemporality with free will, indeterminism, and the open future,\nproposing various different solutions. C.S. Peirce objected to the\nidea that future contingents can have definite truth values. He\nadvanced the view that only the present and the past are actual\nwhereas the future is the realm of possibility and necessity. In a\nsimilar spirit, J. \u0141ukasiewicz devised a three-valued logic,\ntreating the truth values of future contingent statements as\nundetermined. For a more recent philosophical discussion on free will,\nindeterminism, and the open future, see e.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and\nM\u00fcller (2014).\n\nThe modern era of formal temporal logic was initiated by the seminal\nwork of Arthur N. Prior, with important precursors such as H.\nReichenbach, J. Findlay, J. \u0141ukasiewicz, and J.\n \u0141o\u015b.[1]\n From the early 1950s, Prior introduced and analyzed in detail over\nmore than a decade several different versions of Tense Logic, many of\nwhich are discussed below. Prior\u2019s invention of Tense Logic was\nlargely driven by philosophical considerations. In particular, the\nMaster Argument of Diodorus Chronus and the intricate relationship\nbetween time, (in)determinism, God\u2019s foreknowledge, and human\nfreedom played a pivotal role in his work. Prior was convinced that a\nproper logical approach could help to clarify and solve such\nphilosophical problems. He introduced temporal operators, studied\nmetric tense logic, was a pioneer in hybrid temporal logic, devised\ntwo versions of branching time temporal logic, which he took to reflect the\nviews of Ockham and Peirce, respectively, etc. His work paved the way\nfor the development of the vast and diverse field of temporal logic,\nwith numerous important applications not only in philosophy, but also\nin computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. For\nmore on Prior\u2019s views and work, see Hasle et al. (2017);\nBlackburn et al. (2019); and the entry on\n Arthur Prior.\n A comprehensive overview of the history of temporal reasoning and\nlogics is provided in \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995). See\nalso \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (2006) and Dyke and Bardon\n(2013, Part I).\n",
