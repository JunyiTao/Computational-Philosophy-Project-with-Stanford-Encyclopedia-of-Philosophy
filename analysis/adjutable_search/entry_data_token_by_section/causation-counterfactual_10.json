    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework || SEF and Chancy Causation\n5.4 SEF and Chancy Causation\n\nAs we saw in\n \u00a71.4\n above, Lewis revised his 1973 account of causation to take account of\nchancy causation. Any account of causation that is based on the idea\nthat causes increase the chances of their effects encounters two main\nproblems: chance-increase is neither necessary nor sufficient for\ncausation. (Case 1: The doctor reduces the patient\u2019s very high\nchance of a heart attack by drastic surgery. Unfortunately, the\nsurgery itself causes the patient to have a heart attack. The surgery\nlowers the chance of, but causes, the heart attack. Case 2: Billy and\nSuzy are throwing rocks at the bottle again. Each of their throws\nincreases the chance of the bottle shattering, but Suzy\u2019s throw\npre-empts Billy\u2019s. Billy\u2019s throw raises the chance of, but\ndoes not cause, the bottle\u2019s shattering.)\n\nThe first kind of case can (perhaps) be dealt with by Lewis\u2019s\nmodified 1973 account, by finding some intermediate event d\nsuch that the surgery raises the chance of d and d in\nturn raises the chance of the heart attack. But it can\u2019t deal\nwith the second kind of case: Billy\u2019s throw meets Lewis\u2019s\nsufficient condition for chancy causation and so the modified 1973\naccount erroneously counts it as a cause (Menzies 1996). This is a\nproblem that Lewis saw for his own account and never solved: his\nlater, 2000 account of causation as \u2018influence\u2019 assumes\ndeterminism (2000: n.1; Lewis 2004a: 79\u201380) and so ignores the\nproblem. Examples of both kinds have been the subject of extensive\ndiscussion in the context of both counterfactual and probabilistic\ntheories of causation. (For discussions about how best to deal with\nthem within theories that don\u2019t assume determinism, see Barker\n2004; Beebee 2004a; Dowe 2000, 2004; Hitchcock 2004; Kvart 2004;\nNoordhof 1999, 2004; Ramachandran 1997, 2004.)\n\nSEF accounts similarly overwhelmingly assume determinism: as with\nLewis\u2019s original 1973 account, the basic building block of such\naccounts is non-chancy counterfactual dependence. However there have\nbeen recent attempts to extend SEF-based analyses to cover chancy\ncausation by Fenton-Glynn (Glynn 2011, Fenton-Glynn 2017; see also the\nentry on\n Probabilistic Causation,\n \u00a74.4).\n",
