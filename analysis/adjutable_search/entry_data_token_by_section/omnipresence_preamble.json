    "main_text": "\n\nThe psalmist asks God,\n\nWhere can I go from your spirit?\n\nOr where can I flee from your presence?\n\nIf I ascend to heaven, you are there;\n\nIf I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n(Psalms 139: 7\u20138, NRSV)\n\n\nPhilosophers and theologians have taken such texts to affirm that God\nis present everywhere. This passage suggests, first, that God is\nreally present at or located at various particular\nplaces. Second, it suggests that there is no place where God is not\npresent, that is, that God is present everywhere. This is the\nclaim that God is omnipresent. Divine omnipresence is thus\none of the traditional divine attributes, although it has attracted\nless philosophical attention than such attributes as\n omnipotence,\n omniscience, or\n being eternal.\n\nPhilosophers who have attempted to give an account of omnipresence\nhave identified several interesting philosophical questions that an\nadequate account of omnipresence must address: How can a being who is\nsupposed to be immaterial be present at or located in space?\nIf God is located in a particular place, can anything else be located\nthere, too? If God is present everywhere, does it follow that he has\nparts in each of the particular places in which he is located? Various\nphilosophers have proposed accounts of omnipresence in terms that are\nsupposed to apply to an immaterial being. This essay will examine some\nof these proposals.\n",
