    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nTo die is to cease to be alive. To clarify death further, then, we\nwill need to say a bit about the nature of life.\n\nSome theorists have said that life is a substance of some sort. A more\nplausible view is that life is a property of some sort, but we should\nalso consider the possibility that lives are events. If we say that\nlives are events, we will want to know something about how to\ndistinguish them from other events, and how they are related to the\nindividuals that are alive. It would also be useful to know the\npersistence conditions for a life. If instead we conclude that life\n(or alive) is a property, we will want to clarify it, and\nidentify what sorts of things bear it. Let us briefly discuss each of\nthese views\u2014that life is a substance, a property, or an event.\n\n",
