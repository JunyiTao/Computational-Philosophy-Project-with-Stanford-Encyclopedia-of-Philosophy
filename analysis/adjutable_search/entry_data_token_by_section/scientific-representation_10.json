    "main_text": "The Inferential Conception || The DDI Account\n5.1 The DDI Account\n\nAccording to Hughes\u2019 Denotation, Demonstration, and\nInterpretation (DDI) account of scientific representation (1997,\n2010: ch. 5), models denote their targets; are such that\nmodel users can perform demonstrations on them; and\ninterpret the results of such demonstrations in terms of the\ntarget. The last step is necessary because demonstrations establish\nresults about the model itself, and in interpreting these results the\nmodel user draws inferences about the target from the model (1997:\n333). Unfortunately Hughes has little to say about what it means to\ninterpret a result of a demonstration on a model in terms of its\ntarget system, and so one has to retreat to an intuitive (and\nunanalysed) notion of drawing inferences about the target based on the\n model.[10]\n\nHughes is explicit that he is not attempting to answer the ER-problem,\nand that he does not offer denotation, demonstration, and\ninterpretation as individually necessary and jointly sufficient\nconditions for scientific representation. He prefers the more\n\n\nmodest suggestion that, if we examine a theoretical model with these\nthree activities in mind, we shall achieve some insight into the kind\nof representation that it provides. (1997: 339)\n\n\nThis is unsatisfactory because it ultimately remains unclear what\nallows scientists to use a model to draw inferences about the target,\nand it raises the question of what would have to be added to the DDI\nconditions to turn them into a full-fledged response to the\nER-problem. If, alternatively, the conditions were taken to be\nnecessary and sufficient, then the account would require further\nelaboration on what establishes the conditions.\n",
