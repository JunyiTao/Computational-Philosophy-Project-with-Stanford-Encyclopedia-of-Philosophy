    "main_text": "Anarchist Challenges to Political Obligation || Philosophical Anarchism\n3.1 Philosophical Anarchism\n\nThe arguments of these philosophical anarchists take either an\n\u201ca priori\u201d or an \u201ca posteriori\u201d form (Simmons\n2001, pp. 104\u2013106). Arguments of the first kind maintain that it\nis impossible to provide a satisfactory account of a general\nobligation to obey the law. According to Robert Paul Wolff, the\nprincipal advocate of this view, there can be no general obligation to\nobey the law because any such obligation would violate the\n\u201cprimary obligation\u201d of autonomy, which is \u201cthe\nrefusal to be ruled\u201d (1998 [1970], p. 18). As Wolff defines it,\nautonomy combines freedom with responsibility. To be autonomous,\nsomeone must have the capacity for choice, and therefore for freedom;\nbut the person who has this capacity also has the responsibility to\nexercise it \u2013 to act autonomously. Failing to do so is to fail\nto fulfill this \u201cprimary obligation\u201d of autonomy.\n\nThis primary obligation dooms any attempt to develop a theory of\npolitical obligation, Wolff argues, except in the highly unlikely case\nof a direct democracy in which every law has the unanimous approval of\nthe citizenry. Under any other form of government, autonomy and\nauthority are simply incompatible. Authority is \u201cthe right to\ncommand, and correlatively, the right to be obeyed\u201d (p. 4),\nwhich entails that anyone subject to authority has an obligation to\nobey those who have the right to be obeyed. But if we acknowledge such\nan authority, we allow someone else to rule us, thereby violating our\nfundamental obligation to act autonomously. We must therefore reject\nthe claim that we have an obligation to obey the orders of those who\npurport to hold authority over us and conclude that there can be no\ngeneral obligation to obey the laws of any polity that falls short of\na unanimous direct democracy.\n\nArguments of the second, a posteriori form are more modest in their\naims but no less devastating in their conclusions. In this case the\naim is not to show that a satisfactory defense of political obligation\nis impossible but that no defense has proven satisfactory, despite the\nefforts of some of the best minds in the history of philosophy. All\nsuch attempts have failed, according to those who take this line, so\nwe must conclude that only those relatively few people who have\nexplicitly committed themselves to obey the law, perhaps by swearing\nallegiance as part of an oath of citizenship, have anything like a\ngeneral obligation to obey the laws under which they live (e.g., Smith\n1973; Raz 1979, chap. 12; Simmons 1979, 2001, chap. 6, and 2005; Green\n1988, pp. 220\u201347, and 1996).\n",
