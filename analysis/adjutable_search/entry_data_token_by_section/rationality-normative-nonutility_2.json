    "main_text": "Infinite and Unbounded Utility || The Challenge from Infinite and Unbounded Utility\n2.1 The Challenge from Infinite and Unbounded Utility\n\nThe first challenge to EU maximization stems from two ways that\ninfinite utility can arise in decision situations.\n\nFirst, some particular outcome might have infinite utility or\ninfinite disutility. For example, Pascal\u2019s Wager is\nmotivated by the idea that eternal life with God has infinite value,\nso one should \u201cwager for God\u201d as long as one assigns some\nnon-zero probability to God\u2019s existence (Pascal 1670). If a\nparticular outcome has infinite (dis)value, then the Continuity Axiom\nor the Archimedean Axiom will not hold. (See discussions in Hacking\n1972 and H\u00e1jek 2003, and a related issue for utilitarianism in\nVallentyne 1993, Vallentyne & Kagan 1997, and Bostrom 2011.)\n\nSecond, all outcomes might have finite utility value, but this value\nmight be unbounded, which, in combination with allowing that\nthere can be infinitely many states, gives rise to various\nparadoxes. The most famous of these is the St. Petersburg\nParadox, first introduced by Nicolas Bernoulli in a 1713 letter\n(published in J. Bernoulli DW). Imagine a gamble whose\noutcome is determined by flipping a fair coin until it comes up\nheads. If it lands heads for the first time on the\nnth flip, the recipient gets $\\(2^n\\); thus the\ngamble has infinite expected monetary value for the person who takes\nit (it has a \\(\\lfrac{1}{2}\\) probability of yielding $2, a\n\\(\\lfrac{1}{4}\\) probability of yielding $4, a \\(\\lfrac{1}{8}\\)\nprobability of yielding $8, and so forth, and \n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(4) + \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)(8) + \\ldots \\rightarrow \\infty.\\]\n\n\nWhile this version can be resolved by allowing utility to diminish\nmarginally in money\u2014so that the gamble has finite expected\nutility\u2014if the payoffs are in utility rather than money, then\nthe gamble will have infinite expected utility.\n\nRelated paradoxes and problems abound. One centers around a pair of\ngames, the Pasadena game and the Altadena game\n(Nover & H\u00e1jek 2004). The Pasadena game is also played by\nflipping a fair coin until it lands heads; here, the player receives\n\\(\\$({-1})^{n-1}(2^n/n)\\) if the first heads occurs on the\nnth flip. Thus, its payoffs alternate between\npositive and negative values of increasing size, so that its terms can\nbe rearranged to yield any sum whatsoever, and its expectation does\nnot exist. The Altadena game is identical to the Pasadena game, except\nthat every payoff is raised by a dollar. Again, its terms can be\nrearranged to yield any value, and again its expectation does not\nexist. However, it seems (contra EU maximization) that the Altadena\ngame should be preferred to the Pasadena game, since the former\nstate-wise dominates the latter\u2014it is better in every\npossible state of the world (see also Colyvan 2006, Fine 2008,\nH\u00e1jek & Nover 2008). Similarly, it seems that the\nPetrograd game, which increases each payoff of the St.\nPetersburg game by $1, should be preferred to the St. Petersburg game,\neven though EU maximization will say they have the same (infinite)\nexpectation (Colyvan 2008).\n\n(See also Broome\u2019s (1995) discussion of the two-envelope\nparadox; Arntzenius, Elga, and Hawthorne\u2019s (2004) discussion of\ndiachronic puzzles involving infinite utility; and McGee\u2019s\n(1999) argument that the utility function ought to be bounded, which\nwill dissolve the above paradoxes.)\n",
