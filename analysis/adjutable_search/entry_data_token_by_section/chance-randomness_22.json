    "main_text": "Chance, Randomness, and Determinism || Chance and Determinism\n7.1 Chance and Determinism\n\n\nIt is very nearly a piece of philosophical orthodoxy that\nnon-trivial objective chances require indeterminism. The view is seldom\ndefended; even those who trouble to state the view explicitly (Lewis,\n1980: 120) don\u2019t go to the further effort of justifying it, perhaps\nbecause it seems obvious. After all, under determinism, someone who\nknew the past and the laws would be in a position to know with\ncertainty every future outcome. So our use of probability under\ndeterminism must be purely subjective, a side-effect of our (perhaps\nunavoidable) ignorance of the past or the laws. If this orthodoxy is\ncorrect, at least the left-to-right direction of P1 would be true.\n\n\nHowever, there has recently been a considerable amount of work by\nphilosophers defending the thesis that chance and determinism are\nconsistent. Many of the topics dealt with above feature in their\narguments. Loewer (2001) draws on the best systems analysis of chance\nto argue that, in worlds like ours (with entropy-increasing processes,\nand apparently fair coin tosses, etc.), the best description involves\nsome probabilistic component which deserves to be called chance. Clark\n(1987) draws on how we use the phase space measure \\(\\mu\\) to\ngovern our expectations about the behaviour of Bernoulli and mixing\nsystems in classical statistical mechanics, and argues (in effect) that\nthis is an objective probability function despite the deterministic\nunderlying physics. Various other proposals for deterministic chance\nhave been developed (Eagle 2011; Glynn, 2010; Hoefer, 2007;\nIsmael, 2009; Sober, 2010). The general technique is to argue that\nthere are probability distributions over outcomes that can play the\nchance role, even in impeccably deterministic theories. Many of these\nphilosophers are sympathetic to reductionism about chance, which\npermits the compatibility of chance and determinism. For the fact that\nthe entire history of a world supervenes on any moment of its history,\nas determinism states, apparently entails nothing one way or another\nabout whether the best description of that entire history involves\nchances (this is related to the \u2018no-connection\u2019 argument of\nSchaffer 2007: 115). If there is such a thing as deterministic chance,\nhowever, P1 is false.\n\n\nAnti-reductionists about chance have generally found these arguments\nless persuasive (Popper 1992; Black 1998; Weiner and Belnap 2006). In\nparticular, it is in many ways hard to reconcile the BCP (and RP) with\ndeterministic chance. Doing so will require that there is a physically\npossible world (sharing the same laws) which matches ours in occurrent\nfacts up until \\(t\\) but diverges thereafter; but if determinism\nis true, such a divergence is not possible. If that world matches ours\nat any time, it matches it at all times. So, it seems, \u2018only an\nincompatibilist function can fit the RP\u2019 (Schaffer 2007: 130). In\nany case, the debate over whether deterministic \u2018chance\u2019,\nand reductionism about chance more generally is ongoing (see further\nthe discussion in supplement\n A);\n the status\nof the left-to-right direction of P1 is at best unsettled.\n\n\nThe same cannot be said for the right-to-left direction. For the\ndiscussion in\n \u00a75.3\n showed that there are\nindeterministic theories without chances, those where indeterminism is\nsecured by the existence of alternative future possibilities, but where\nthose possibilities collectively do not permit or require a probability\ndistribution over them. A more controversial class of cases of\nindeterminism without chances comes from those who reject\nuniversalism about chance: the thesis \u2018that chance of\ntruth applies to any proposition whatever\u2019 (Lewis, 1980: 91). If\nuniversalism is false, there may be indeterministic situations where\nthe alternative outcomes are those to which chance does not apply. Von\nMises rejected universalism, because he thought that chance applied\nproperly only to \u2018mass phenomena\u2019; in an indeterministic\nworld where the indeterministic process occurs only once, for example,\nthe theory of probability does not apply. Hoefer (2007) also holds a\nview something like this, rejecting chances for those processes which\ndon\u2019t have stable enough outcome\n patterns.[25]\n",
