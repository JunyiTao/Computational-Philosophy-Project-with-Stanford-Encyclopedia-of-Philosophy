    "main_text": "Absolute or Conditional Necessity in Nature\n5. Absolute or Conditional Necessity in Nature\n\nPurposiveness and necessity are interrelated and Aristotle analyses\nthe matter in Phys. II.9, introducing the distinction between\nabsolute and conditional necessity. Conditional necessity is always\nsubject to achieving an end. A well-known instance is given by\nAristotle in 200a10\u201315: a saw must necessarily be made of iron\nto do its work. The material, iron, is necessary but does not lead to\nthe production of a saw. Purpose precedes deliberative actions and\nimposes necessity upon the materials. As for natural events, Aristotle\nonly says: \u201cnecessity in the natural [events] is limited to what\nis called their matter and their motions\u201d (Phys. II.9,\n200a30\u201332), not to the results, and the question arises whether\nnecessity is absolute or conditional.\n\nAverroes pays attention to the division between that which results\nfrom an intended action and that which results from having a certain\nmatter. He quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, whose commentary on the\nPhysics, as already noted, is not extant: \u201cThose [causes]\nthat are before the purpose in something (in re) are not said\nto be cause of the purpose except in the way that matter is cause of\nthe purpose\u201d (LC 82M TC88).\n\nWe know that Alexander had to defend the Aristotelian position against\nthe Stoics in such an important matter as destiny or fate. In his book\nOn Destiny Alexander admits fate in Nature but not as\ngoverning human acts. While the final cause appears in planned changes\nas external to them, \u201cthe creations of Nature have the principle\nand cause of such generation within themselves\u201d (De\nfato 168). Alexander\u2019s treatise On Providence was\nwell known to Averroes who paraphrased part of it in his \u201cShort\nCommentary on the Metaphysics\u201d, as R. Arnzen has proved (Arnzen\n2010: 331\u2013335). This is the context within which we may\ninterpret the short quotation Averroes makes of Alexander and Averroes\nends it adding \u201cpurpose is indeed the main cause\u201d (LC 83A\nTC88).\n\nAverroes also reflects upon necessity of that which follows matter.\nOne example is death which is necessary for animals as a consequence\nof their matter. Is this an absolute necessity? Averroes denies it,\npointing out that these instances of necessity are caused by the\nsubstantial form or essential definition of the beings, here the\nanimals. Averroes claims that both cases of necessity\u2014according\nto matter or according to purpose\u2014have conditional characters\nsince \u201cthey are because of the form and essence\n(definitio) and they are not unconditionally necessary\u201d\n(LC 83C TC88).\n\nAverroes finally reflects on absolutely necessary, which seemed to be\nexcluded by Aristotle in the passage. Whenever we ask for the reason\nof products of Nature or of the arts, the answer we get is their final\ncause, for instance, why does a saw have sharp teeth? To cut wood. The\nanswer however is completely different in the case of the eternal\nbeings. An eternal being acts because of its essence, its activity is\nbecause of itself, propter ipsum, and necessity is\nunconditional (LC 83F TC88).\n",
