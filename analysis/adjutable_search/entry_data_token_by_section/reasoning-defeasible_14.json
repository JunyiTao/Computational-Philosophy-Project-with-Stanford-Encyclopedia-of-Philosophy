    "main_text": "Epistemological Approaches || Formal Epistemology\n4.1 Formal Epistemology\n\nJohn Pollock\u2019s approach to defeasible reasoning consists of\nenumerating a set of rules that are constructive and effectively\ncomputable, and that aim at describing how an ideal cognitive agent\nbuilds up a rich set of beliefs, beginning with a relatively sparse\ndata set (consisting of beliefs about immediate sensory appearances,\napparent memories, and such things). The inferences involved are not,\nfor the most part, deductive. Instead, Pollock defines, first, what it\nis for one belief to be a prima facie reason for believing\nanother proposition. In addition, Pollock defines what it is for one\nbelief, say in \\(p\\), to be a defeater for \\(q\\) as\na prima facie reason for \\(r\\). In fact. Pollock distinguishes\ntwo kinds of defeaters:\n rebutting defeaters,\n which are themselves prima facie reasons for believing the negation\nof the conclusion, and undercutting defeaters, which provide\na reason for doubting that \\(q\\) provides any support, in the actual\ncircumstances, for \\(r\\). (Pollock 1987, 484) A belief is\nultimately warranted in relation to a data set (or\nepistemic basis) just in case it is supported by some\nultimately undefeated argument proceeding from that epistemic\nbasis.\n\nIn Pollock 1995, Pollock uses a directed graph\nto represent the structure of an ideal cognitive state. Each directed\nlink in the network represents the first node\u2019s being a prima\nfacie reason for the second. The new theory includes an account of\nhypothetical, as well as categorical reasoning, since each\nnode of the graph includes a (possibly empty) set of hypotheses.\nSomewhat surprisingly, Pollock assumes a principle of monotonicity\nwith respect to hypotheses: a belief that is warranted relative to a\nset of hypotheses is also warranted with respect to any superset of\nhypotheses. Pollock also permits conditionalization and reasoning by\ncases.\n\nAn argument is self-defeating if it supports a defeater for\none of its own defeasible steps. Here is an interesting example: (1)\nRobert says that the elephant beside him looks pink. (2)\nRobert\u2019s color vision becomes unreliable in the presence of pink\nelephants. Ordinarily, belief 1 would support the conclusion that the\nelephant is pink, but this conclusion undercuts the argument, thanks\nto belief 2. Thus, the argument that the elephant is pink is\nself-defeating. Pollock argues that all self-defeating arguments\nshould be rejected, and that they should not be allowed to defeat\nother arguments. In addition, a set of nodes can experience mutual\ndestruction or collective defeat if each member of the set is\ndefeated by some other member, and no member of the set is defeated by\nan undefeated node that is outside the set.\n\nIn formalizing the undercutting rebuttal, Pollock introduces a new\nconnective, \\(\\otimes\\), where \\(p \\otimes q\\) means that it is not\nthe case that \\(p\\) wouldn\u2019t be true unless \\(q\\) were\ntrue. Pollock uses rules, rather than conditional propositions, to\nexpress the prima facie relation. If he had, instead, introduced a\nspecial connective \\(\\Rightarrow\\), with \\(p \\Rightarrow q\\) meaning\nthat \\(p\\) would be a prima facie reason for \\(q\\), then undercutting\ndefeaters could be represented by means of negating this\nconditional. To express the fact that \\(r\\) is an undercutting\ndefeater of \\(p\\) as a prima facie reason for \\(q\\), we could state\nboth that \\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\) and \\(\\neg((p \\amp r) \\Rightarrow\nq)\\).\n\nIn the case of conflicting prima facie reasons, Pollock rejects the\nprinciple of specificity, a widely accepted principle\naccording to which the defeasible rule with the more specific\nantecedent takes priority over conflicting rules with less specific\nantecedents. Pollock does, however, accept a special case of\nspecificity in the area of statistical syllogisms with projectible\nproperties. (Pollock 1995, 64\u201366) So, if I know that most\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, and the most \\(AC\\)s are not\n\\(B\\)s, then I should, upon learning that individual \\(b\\)\nis both \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), give priority to the \\(AC\\)\ngeneralization over the \\(A\\) generalization (concluding that\n\\(b\\) is not a \\(B)\\).\n\nPollock\u2019s theory of warrant is intended to provide normative\nrules for belief, of the form: if you have warranted beliefs that are\nprima facie reasons for some further belief, and you have no\nultimately undefeated defeaters for those reasons, then that further\nbelief is warranted and should be believed. For more details of\nPollock\u2019s theory, see the following supplementary document:\n\nJohn Pollock\u2019s System\n\n\nWolfgang Spohn (Spohn 2002) has argued that Pollock\u2019s system is\nnormatively defective because, in the end, Pollock has no\nnormative standard to appeal to, other than ad hoc intuitions about\nhow a reasonable person would respond to this or that cognitive\nsituation. Spohn suggests that, with respect to the state of\ndevelopment of the study of defeasible reasoning, Pollock\u2019s\ntheory corresponds to C. I. Lewis\u2019s early investigations into\nmodal logic. Lewis suggested a number of possible axiom systems, but\nlacked an adequate semantic theory that could provide an independent\ncheck on the correctness or completeness of any given list (of the\nkind that was later provided by Kripke and Kanger). Analogously, Spohn\nargues that Pollock\u2019s system is in need of a unifying normative\nstandard. This very same criticism can be lodged, with equal justice,\nagainst a number of other theories of defeasible reasoning, including\nsemantic inheritance networks and default logic.\n",
