    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam || Eschatology\n2.3 Eschatology\nKhayyam has been accused of believing in the transmigration of the soul and even corporeal resurrection in this world. This is partially due to some of the inauthentic quatrains attributed to him. Khayyam\u2019s philosophical treatises indicate that he did believe in life after death, and in this regard his views were in line with traditional Islamic eschatological doctrine. Khayyam the poet, however, plays with the notion of life after death in a variety of ways. First, he casts doubt on the very existence of a life beyond our earthly existence; second, he says that based on our very experience in this world, all things seem to perish and not return. Some of his poems play with the idea of the transmigration of the soul (tan\u0101sukh). This can be taken symbolically, rather than literally; in numerous poems he tells us that we turn to dust and it is from our dust that other living beings rise. Khayyam\u2019s comments regarding the possibility of life after death may well have been an indirect criticism of the orthodox jurists who spoke of the intricacies of heaven and hell with certainty.[5]\nKhayyam\u2019s ideas about the human soul and its persistence are scarce and scattered in his philosophical writings. Toward the end of The Necessity of Contrariety (N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (ed.) 2000, 169\u201370), he explains the notion of persistence as existence through time, and rejects the view that the concept of existence itself implies duration (in time). It seems to follow that if an entity exists atemporally, its ontological status cannot be described as \u201cpersisting.\u201d In his translation of Avicenna\u2019s treatise, Khayyam is explicit that \u201cwhen it [the rational soul] is separated from the matter, it becomes like the angels, in simplicity and apprehension of the intelligible [meanings], till immortal persistence inevitably accompanies it\u201d (Lucid Discourse, Malik (ed.) 1998, 317). Describing the fate of the rational soul as \u201cimmortally persisting\u201d suggests that for Khayyam, like Avicenna, the rational soul is an incorporeal entity with temporal existence.\n",
