    "main_text": "The Conditions, again || Non-Dictatorship\n4.4 Non-Dictatorship\nSomeone is a dictator, in Arrow\u2019s sense, if whenever he strictly\nprefers one alternative to another the society always prefers it as\nwell. The preferences of people other than the dictator can still make\na difference, and so can non-welfare factors, but only when the\ndictator is indifferent between two alternatives, having no strict\npreference one way or the other. Arrow\u2019s non-dictatorship\ncondition D says that there is to be no dictator. Plainly it\nrules out many undemocratic arrangements, such as identifying social\npreferences in every case with the individual preferences of some one\nperson. This apparently straightforward condition has attracted very\nlittle attention in the literature. \nIn fact there is more to the non-dictatorship condition than meets\nthe eye. An Arrovian dictator is just someone whose strict preferences\ninvariably are a subset of the society\u2019s strict preferences, and that\nby itself doesn\u2019t mean that his preferences form a basis for social\npreferences, or that the dictator has any power or control over\nthese. Aanund Hylland once made a related point while objecting to the\nunreflective imposition of D in single profile analyses of\nsocial choice:\n\nIn the single-profile model, a dictator is a\nperson whose individual preferences coincide with the social ones in\nthe one and only profile under consideration. Nothing is necessarily\nwrong with that; the decision process can be perfectly democratic, and\none person simply turns out to be on the winning side on all\nissues. (Hylland 1986: 51, footnote 10) \nThe non-dictatorship condition for this reason sometimes goes too\nfar. Even pairwise majority voting, that paradigm of a democratic\nprocedure, is in Arrow\u2019s sense sometimes a dictatorship. Consider\nZelig. He has no tastes, values or preferences of his own but\ntemporarily takes on those of another, whoever is close at hand. He is\na human chameleon, the ultimate\nconformist.[6]\nZelig one day finds himself on a committee of three that will choose\namong several options using the method of pairwise majority voting\nand, given his peculiar character, the range of individual orderings\nthat can arise is somewhat restricted. In each admissible profile, two\nof the three individual orderings are identical: Zelig\u2019s and that of\nwhoever is seated closest to him at the committee\nmeeting.[7] Now\nsuppose it so happens that Zelig strictly prefers one option \\(x\\) to\nanother, \\(y\\). Then someone else does too; that makes two of the\nthree and so, when they vote, the result is a strict collective\npreference for \\(x\\) above \\(y\\). The committee\u2019s decision procedure\nis, in Arrow\u2019s sense, a dictatorship, and Zelig is the dictator. But\nof course really Zelig is a follower, not a leader, and majority\nvoting is as democratic as can be. It\u2019s just that this one mad little\nfellow has a way of always ending up on the winning side.\nArrow imposed D in conjunction with the\nrequirement U that the domain is completely\nunrestricted. Perhaps this condition expresses something closer to its\nintended meaning then. With an unrestricted domain, a dictator, unlike\nZelig, is someone whose preferences conflict with everybody else\u2019s in\na range of cases, and it is in each instance his preferences that\nagree with social preferences, not theirs. However this may be, the\nexample of Zelig shows that whether it is appropriate to\nimpose D on social welfare functions depends on the details\nof the choice problem at hand.  The name of this condition is\nmisleading. Sometimes there is nothing undemocratic about having a\n\u201cdictator\u201d, in Arrow\u2019s technical sense.\n",
