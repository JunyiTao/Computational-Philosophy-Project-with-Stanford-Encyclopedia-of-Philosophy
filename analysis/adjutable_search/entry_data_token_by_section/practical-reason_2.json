    "main_text": "Reasons and Motivation\n3. Reasons and Motivation\n\n The capacity of practical reason to give rise to intentional action\ndivides even those philosophers who agree in rejecting the\nexpressivist strategy discussed above. Such philosophers are prepared\nto grant that there are normative and evaluative facts and truths, and\nto accept the cognitive credentials of discourse about this\ndistinctive domain of facts and truths.  But they differ in their\naccounts of the truth conditions of the normative and evaluative\nclaims that figure in such discourse. We may distinguish the following\ntwo approaches. \n\n The first of these, often referred to as internalism, holds that\nreasons for action must be grounded in an agent\u2019s prior motivations\n(Williams 1981; cf. Finlay 2009).  According to this influential position, a given\nagent s can have reason to do x only if x-ing\nwould speak to or advance some element in s\u2019s \u2018subjective\nmotivational set\u2019. There must be some rational connection\nbetween s\u2019s x-ing and the subjective motivations to\nwhich s is actually already subject; otherwise the claim\nthat s has reason to x must be rejected, as false or\nincoherent.  Behind this internalist position lies the idea that\npractical reason is practical in its issue. Internalists contend that\nwe can make sense of the generation of new intentions through\nreasoning only if we assume that such reasoning is conditioned by\nmotivational resources that are already to hand. Practical reason, on\nthe internalist account, is the capacity to work out the implications\nof the commitments contained in one\u2019s existing subjective motivational\nset; the upshot is that motivation is prior to practical reason, and\nconstrains it.\n\n Externalists reject this picture, contending that one can have\nreasons for action that are independent of one\u2019s prior\nmotivations. They typically agree that practical reasoning is capable\nof generating new motivations and actions. They agree, in other words,\nthat if agent s has reason to do x, it must be possible\nfor s to acquire the motivation to x through reflection\non the relevant reasons. But they deny that such reasoning must in any\nsignificant way be constrained by s\u2019s subjective motivations\nprior to the episode of reasoning.  On this approach, practical reason\nis not conceived merely as a capacity for working out the implications\nof one\u2019s existing desires and commitments; it equally involves the\ncapacity to reason about what it would objectively be good to do, and\nto act on the basis of this kind of evaluative reflection.  Normative\nreflection is thus taken to be independent of one\u2019s prior motivations,\nand capable of opening up new motivational possibilities (Parfit\n1997).\n\nThis disagreement is conventionally understood to be driven by\ndiverging approaches to the explanation of intentional\naction. Internalists are impressed by the differences between\nintentions and the cognitive states that figure in paradigmatic\nexamples of theoretical reasoning. Pointing to these differences, they\nask how practical reason can succeed in producing new intentions if it\nis not based in something of the same basic psychological type: a\nmotivation or desire that is already part of the agent\u2019s subjective\nmotivational equipment. Many externalists find this contrast between\nintentions and cognitive states overdrawn.  They observe that we need\nto postulate basic dispositions of normative responsiveness to account\nfor the capacity of theoretical reflection about reasons to affect our\nbeliefs, and question why these same dispositions cannot explain the\nfact that practical reasoning is practical in its consequences.\nCognitive or not, intentions belong to the broad class of attitudes\nthat are sensitive to judgments, and this may account for the capacity\nof practical reflection to generate new intentions (Scanlon 1998,\nchap. 1). A third possibility is that intentions result from\ndispositions or capacities distinct from the psychic mechanisms that\nrender theoretical rationality possible. Depending on how it is\ndeveloped, this approach may offer a different way of accounting for\nthe practical consequences of practical reflection, without assuming\nthat reasons for action are grounded in an agent\u2019s subjective\nmotivations (Velleman 2000, chap. 8, Wallace 1999). \nMore recently, it has been maintained that the Humean approach has\nits basis not in a philosophical account of motivation, but rather in\nour understanding of what explains peoples\u2019 reasons for action\n(Schroeder 2007). There are cases in which features of a person\u2019s\npsychology make an obvious difference to what the person has reason to\ndo. Some people like to dance, others detest this activity, and this\ndifference in their \u201cdesires\u201d appears to determine a corresponding\ndifference in their reasons. Even in cases of this kind, however, it\nis far from obvious that differences in the agent\u2019s \u201cdesires\u201d are what\nultimately explain their differing reasons (Scanlon 2014). Moreover,\nthe fact that psychological factors might sometimes be relevant to the\nexplanation of a person\u2019s reasons does not entail that they always\nhave explanatory relevance.\n",
