    "main_text": "The moral issue || Complicity of the victims\n2.1 Complicity of the victims\n\nIf the former line of argument is successful, will it prove too much?\nIn showing that an instance of violence was justified because those\ntargeted were not really innocent, we will have shown that the act or\ncampaign of violence at issue was actually not a case of terrorism.\nThis may be merely a matter of semantics. There is a much more\ndamaging objection. A terrorist act is characteristically the killing\nor injuring of a random collection of people who happen to be in a\ncertain place at a certain time. Arguments to the effect that those\npeople are not innocent of the wrongs the terrorist fights against\nwill therefore have a very wide reach, and accordingly will\nbe based on some simplistic conception of collective responsibility.\nThese arguments will be of the sort offered, for example, by the 19th\ncentury anarchist Emile Henry. He planted a bomb at the office of a\nmining company which, if it had exploded, would have killed or injured\na number of people who did not work for the company, but lived in the\nsame building. He also planted a bomb in a caf\u00e9 that did go\noff, injuring twenty people, one of whom later died of his injuries.\nAt his trial, Henry explained: \u201cWhat about the innocent victims?\n[\u2026] The building where the Carmeaux Company had its offices was\ninhabited only by the bourgeois; hence there would be no innocent\nvictims. The whole of the bourgeoisie lives by the exploitation of the\nunfortunate, and should expiate its crimes together\u201d (Henry\n1977: 193). When commenting on the second attack, he said:\n\nThose good bourgeois who hold no office but who reap their dividends\nand live idly on the profits of the workers\u2019 toil, they also\nmust take their share in the reprisals. And not only they, but all\nthose who are satisfied with the existing order, who applaud the acts\nof the government and so become its accomplices \u2026 in other\nwords, the daily clientele of Terminus and other great caf\u00e9s!\n(Henry 1977: 195)\n\n\nThis is an utterly implausible view of responsibility and liability.\nIt claims that all members of a social class\u2014men and women,\nyoung and old, adults and children\u2014are liable to be killed or\nmaimed: some for operating the system of exploitation, others for\nsupporting it, and still others for benefiting from it. Even if, for\nthe sake of argument, we grant the anarchist\u2019s harsh moral\ncondemnation of capitalist society, not every type and degree of\ninvolvement with it can justify the use of extreme violence. Giving\nthe system political support, or benefiting from it, may be morally\nobjectionable, but is surely not enough to make one liable to be blown\nto pieces.\n\nAnother, more recent example, is provided by Osama Bin Laden. In an\ninterview in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001 he\nsaid:\n\nThe American people should remember that they pay taxes to their\ngovernment and that they voted for their president. Their government\nmakes weapons and provides them to Israel, which they use to kill\nPalestinian Muslims. Given that the American Congress is a committee\nthat represents the people, the fact that it agrees with the actions\nof the American government proves that America in its entirety is\nresponsible for the atrocities that it is committing against Muslims\n(Bin Laden 2005: 140\u2013141).\n\n\nThis, too, is a preposterous understanding of responsibility and\nliability. For it claims that all Americans are eligible to be killed\nor maimed: some for devising and implementing America\u2019s\npolicies, others for participating in the political process, still\nothers for paying taxes. Even if, for the sake of argument, we grant\nBin Laden\u2019s severe condemnation of those policies, not every\ntype and degree of involvement with them can justify the use of lethal\nviolence. Surely voting in elections or paying taxes is not enough to\nmake one fair game.\n\nAttempts at justification of terrorism that concede that its victims\nare innocent seem more promising. They fall into two groups, depending\non the type of ethical theory on which they are based.\n",
