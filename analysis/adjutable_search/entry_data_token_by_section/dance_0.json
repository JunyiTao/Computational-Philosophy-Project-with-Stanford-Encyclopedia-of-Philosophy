    "main_text": "Analytic Ontology of Dance as Art\n1. Analytic Ontology of Dance as Art\n\nThe dance philosophy that is a subset of philosophical aesthetics is\ninterested in the question, \u201cwhat is the nature of dance as\nart?\u201d Here one set of philosophical problems center on\nidentifying what the art product of dance is\u2014whether it is an\nobject or structure of some or a more fluid process or event. Dance\nphilosophers differ on which features of dance as art should have\nprimary of place for purposes of ontology. Some philosophers with\ncommitments to dancework structure and repeatability (notably Nelson\nGoodman (1976) and Graham McFee (1992b, 2011b, and 2018)) treat the\nart-relevant aspect of dance as its abstract structure, looking to an\nactual or in-principle score for guidance even if they deny (as McFee\ndoes) that this is an attempt to find a true definition or\n\u201cessence\u201d of dance. It is important to these philosophers\nthat there be an object of appreciation that can be evaluated\nindependently of any particular subjective experience or perspective\nof it, in this way hoping to identify something \u201ctrue\u201d\nabout dance as art that is subject to the sort of rational appraisal,\nanalysis, and what McFee calls \u201creconstruction\u201d that\nanalytic philosophy does well (see McFee 2018).\n\nThere are dance works of art that are relatively stable throughout\ndance history in terms of historical identification despite variations\n(the perennial Swan Lake, for example) and McFee points to\nthese as support for his perspective on dance as a practice that\ncreates dance works of are that are \u201cperformables\u201d\ninstantiated in repeatable performances. There are dance philosophers,\nhowever, who think that the art-relevant focus of dance might lie\nelsewhere than in the structure of the \u201cdancework\u201d treated\nas art object. Mark Franko, for example, points out that \n\n\ncontemporary thought on dance is frequently split between a concept of\ndance-as-writing and a concept of dance as beyond the grasp of all\nlanguage, especially written language. (2011a: 322; see also Franko\n2011b) \n\n\n(For more on the idea of dance as texts see Franko 1993.) Other dance\nphilosophers think that dance can be characterized by words and\nconcepts but that these either apply to features of performance or to\ndance practices or events rather than to texts or structures. The\nnon-structuralist dance philosophers observe that dances usually lack\nwords or texts and are often developed without the use of a written\nplan, script or score of any kind (see Franko 1989 and 2011a; see also\nFranko 2017 for a recent anthology of dance and reconstruction, in\nparticular the essay by Pakes [2017b] within it). They also note that\neven when there is a score, this score is not always used as an\nessential recipe for the performances but can instead just serve as\nthe inspiration for a performance that is completely different (see\nFranko 1989). In addition, standardized notation forms are\ncontroversial, and no one form is universally accepted (see Franko\n2011a and Van Camp 1998). Finally, there are dance philosophers who\nthink that what makes dance special and worthy of philosophers\u2019\ninterest lies in dance\u2019s bodily, tactile, dynamic, felt,\nperceived and intuited aspects (sometimes referred to as its\nkinaesthetic or somatic elements). (See this entry\u2019s\n Sections 2 and 3\n for more on these latter aspects of dance. See\n Sections 1.1\u20131.2\n  below for more on focus\non dance\u2019s structural vs. non-structural features. See also\nPakes 2006 for one account of the \u201cmind-body\u201d problem in\ndance.)\n\nFor more on the general question, \u201cWhat is dance?\u201d, see D.\nCarr 1987; Carroll 2003, Copeland and Cohen 1983; McFee 1998a and\n2013a; Pakes 2019; Sparshott 1988; and Van Camp 1981. For more on\nmeaning, expression, authenticity and communication in dance see D.\nCarr 1997; Best 1974; Franko 2014b; Hanna 1983 and 1979 [1987]; Martin\n1933a, 1939, and 1946; and Van Camp 1996b.\n",
