    "main_text": "Some Definitions of Pragmatics\n5. Glossary\n\nAmbiguity\n\nIn general, an expression is ambiguous if it has more than one\nmeaning. When a word (e.g., \u2018bank\u2019) has multiple meanings,\nwe have lexical ambiguity. A sentence can be ambiguous even if none of\nits words is ambiguous. Sometimes the ambiguity is considered\nsyntactic because the alternative meanings correspond to alternative\nsyntactic configurations (e.g., \u2018Mary saw John with a\ntelescope\u2019). If there is only one syntactic configuration, the\nambiguity is structural (e.g., \u2018Every man admires a\nwoman\u2019). It is not always clear what kind ambiguity is at stake,\nor even if there is any ambiguity at all (Grice\u2019s theory of\nimplicatures and his Ockham\u2019s modified razor had a\ngreat impact on this issue). In any case, ambiguity \u2014 the\nexistence of several meanings for an expression \u2014 should be\ndistinguished from nambiguity (the existence of many\ndifferent bearers of a proper name), from vagueness (meanings with\nunclear boundaries of application), and underdetermination (failure to\nfully specify a meaning). It is usually assumed that resolving\nambiguity is a pragmatic process, involving determining which meaning\nthe speaker intends to be exploiting, although ambiguity itself is a\nsemantic condition.\n\nAttitude report\n\n\u2018Propositional attitude\u2019 is Bertrand Russell\u2019s term\nfor designating mental states with propositional content, conceived as\nrelations between an agent and a proposition. Propositional attitude\nverbs include \u2018believes,\u2019 \u2018wants,\u2019\n\u2018desires,\u2019 \u2018intends\u2019 or \u2018knows\u2019\nand many others \u2014 basically, the core of our vocabulary for\ndescribing minds and language.\n\nSentences like \u2018Kepler thought that the Earth was\nspherical\u2019 embed other sentences \u2014 \u2018the earth was\nspherical\u2019 \u2014 in oblique (or opaque or\nintensional (with an \u2018s\u2019)) contexts. Oblique\ncontexts are not truth-functional. Substituting other true sentences\nfor \u2018the earth was spherical\u2019 will not necessarily\npreserve truth. Moreover, even substituting co-designative terms for\n\u2018the earth\u2019 may not preserve truth. Kepler did not, one\nsupposes, think that Frege\u2019s favorite planet was spherical\n(assuming the earth was Frege\u2019s favorite planet). \n\nAccording to Frege, in such contexts the usual sense of the sentence,\nthe \u2018Gedanke\u2019 or proposition expressed, becomes the\nreference. Since Frege\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber Sinn und\nBedeutung\u201d (1892) and Russell\u2019s \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\n(1905) the study of reports of these attitudes has been one of the\ncentral topics of the philosophy of language, semantics and\npragmatics.\n\nCharacter/Content\n\nSince Kaplan\u2019s work on indexicals and demonstratives, (Kaplan\n1989) it is commonplace to distinguish between the character of an\nexpression and the content of an utterance of an expression. For\nexample, the character of the word \u2018I\u2019 in English\ndoesn\u2019t change from context to context, although the content\ndoes. Knowing the character of a sentence like \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply knowing the content of a\nparticular utterance of that sentence; for the latter, you need to\nknow the \u2018semantic\u2019 context of the utterance. Character is\na property of linguistic expressions (types); content is a property of\nutterances \u2014sentences-in-context; tokenings of them.\n\nContext\n\n\u2018Context\u2019 is an all-pervasive term in pragmatics. For some\nauthors \u2018context\u2019 is the defining concept of pragmatics.\nBut many, perhaps too many, different concepts are included under this\nterm.\n\nIn Linguistics, \u2018context\u2019 commonly means the previous and\nsubsequent linguistic material in a given text. In Kaplan\u2019s\nscheme, the context is objective, it comprises the actual basic facts\nabout an utterance: the speaker, time, place, and possible world in\nwhich it occurs. In Stalnaker\u2019s scheme, context is basically\nsubjective: a matter of common ground: that is, shared beliefs that\nserve as common presuppositions for the interpretation of assertions.\nOften the term is used for anything in the indefinitely large\nsurrounding of an utterance, from the intentions of the speaker to the\nprevious topics of conversation to the objects discernible in the\nenvironment.\n\nHere are a number of distinctions that have been made with respect to\nthe concept(s) of context that the reader may find helpful. The list\nis not intended to be exhaustive, mutually exclusive, or to represent\na single coherent view of pragmatic phenomena.\n\nLinguistic context versus extralinguistic context\n\nConsidering the context of an utterance, one of the most intuitive\ndistinctions is between the context as consisting of its previous and\nsubsequent utterances \u2014 the linguistic contexts \u2014 and any\nother extra-linguistic circumstance surrounding the utterance. In the\ncase of ellipsis and anaphoric (and cataphoric) pronouns the\ndesignation is determined, or at least constrained, by the linguistic\ncontext of the utterance, while the designation of deictic\ndemonstratives is fixed by contextual extralinguistic facts.\n\nNarrow versus broad\n\nNarrow context is usually understood as the list of parameters for\nbasic indexicals, parameters that correspond to basic facts about the\nutterance. Speaker, place and time are on almost everyone\u2019s\nlist, as required for the interpretation of \u2018I,\u2019\n\u2018here,\u2019 \u2018now\u2019 and tense. Kaplan adds the\npossible world, for the interpretation of \u2018actual.\u2019\nArguably, every utterance occurs in a world, at a time, in a place,\nand with a speaker. \n\nIn contrast, wide or broad context is understood as all other kinds of\ninformation, in particular, information relative to the\nspeaker\u2019s communicative intention, used for the interpretation\nof \u2018pragmatic aspects\u2019 of the utterance. In Bach\u2019s\nwords:\n\n\n\nWide context concerns any contextual information relevant to\ndetermining the speaker\u2019s intention and to the successful and\nfelicitous performance of the speech act\u2026 Narrow context\nconcerns information specifically relevant to determining the semantic\nvalues of [indexicals]\u2026 (Bach 1999a)\n\n\nBach goes on to say,\n\nNarrow context is semantic, wide context pragmatic.\n\n\nBut on this there would be some disagreement, as many would hold that\ninformation about the speaker\u2019s intentions, and perhaps also\nabout causal and informational chains, ongoing topics of\nconversations, and much else, are needed for semantics.\n\nEpistemic versus doxastic\n\nIt is sometimes assumed, particularly by writers with a psychological\norientation, that, together with speaker\u2019s intentions, it is\nspeaker\u2019s beliefs what determine the content of expressions in\nher utterance, with the issue of the truth (or falsity) of her beliefs\nhaving no relevance. So, belief rather than knowledge is the relevant\nconcept to characterize context. According to this view, there would\nnot be a significant difference between \u2018intending to say\u2019\nand \u2018saying,\u2019 which goes about some truths of intentions\nin general: one usual way of failing to perform an action comes from\nthe falsity of some agent\u2019s belief. This is related to another\npossible distinction between objective and subjective contexts.\n\nObjective versus subjective\n\nThere are a number of cases, however, in which the speaker\u2019s\nbeliefs, even if shared by everyone in the conversation, do not seem\nto determine content. Suppose, for example, that Elwood\u2019s hero\nworship of John Searle has reached such a point that he now takes\nhimself to be John Searle. He introduces himself to the new class of\nStanford graduate students by saying, \u201cI\u2019m John Searle,\nfrom across the Bay.\u201d It seems that even if he and everyone in\nthe conversation believes he is Searle, what he has said is the\nfalsehood that Elwood is John Searle. Or, suppose a group of golfers\nis standing on the small portion of the Stanford golf course that juts\ninto San Mateo County, but none of them realize it. \u201cThe county\nseat of this county is San Jose,\u201d one of them says, for some\nreason or other. He believes he has informed them of the truth that\nthe county seat of Santa Clara County is San Jose, and in fact the\nother members of the foursome learn this fact from what he says.\nNevertheless, many would argue, what he said was false, and only\nfortuitous ignorance led his partners to learn a truth from the\nfalsehood he uttered.\n\nPre-semantic context\n\nPre-semantic context provides information for identifying the\nutterance: which words in which language with which syntactic\nstructure, and with which meanings are being used.\n\nSemantic context\n\nSemantic context comprises those contextual features that determine or\npartly determine the content of context-sensitive expressions. This is\nthe case of pronouns, whose linguistic meanings do more or less\nstrictly constrain but do not determine their designata. Their\nmeanings direct us to the context (linguistic context, in cases of\nanaphoric co-designation; extra-linguistic context in cases of\nindexicals and deictic uses of demonstratives) to look for the\ndesignation of the pronoun. But there are more context-sensitive\nexpressions than indexical, deictic and anaphoric pronouns. Sentence\nmood, for instance, is an indicator of illocutionary point, but it\ndoes not determine the precise illocutionary force of an utterance\nwithout the help of contextual factors. The contribution to\nutterance-content of some particles like \u2018but\u2019 (that,\naccording to Grice, produce \u2018conventional implicatures) are\nanother case in point.\n\nPost-semantic context\n\nThird, there is (or may be) what Perry (2001) calls post-semantic\ncontext. This comprises facts that provide unarticulated\ncontent. For example, the fact that a conversation is about Palo\nAlto may determine, perhaps together with speaker intentions, that the\nstatement \u201cIt is raining,\u201d has the content that it is\nraining in Palo Alto. Arguably, such contextual contributions are not\ntriggered by the meaning-rules of the words used, but more global\nconsiderations. The fact that we usually are talking about rain in a\nparticular place has to do with the nature of rain and the way humans\nare concerned with it and conceptualize the phenomena, rather than the\nsyntax of \u2018rain.\u2019\n\n(Far-side) Pragmatic Context\n\nThis comprises those contextual factors needed to get at (calculate,\ninfer) what is communicated or done in and by saying\nwhat one says. This importantly concerns the speaker\u2019s\nintentions regarding indirect speech acts, implicatures, and\nnon-literal contents. It may also include institutional facts and\nindeed, all sorts of other things relevant to the effects of the\nutterance.\n\nCommunicative intention\n\nCommunicative intention is what characterizes, an action as\ncommunicative. Following Grice\u2019s definition of\nM(eaning)-intention, it is widely agreed that communicative intentions\nhave three particular properties: (i) it is perlocutionary,\nthat is, it is an intention that seeks a mental effect (certain\nbelief(s) or intention(s)) on the part of the addressee; (ii) it is\novert, that is, the speaker wants the addressee to recognize her\ncommunicative intention; and (iii) the satisfaction of a communicative\nintention consists precisely in its recognition by the addressee.\nCommunicative intentions need not be carried out by linguistic means\n(see Clark 2003). In human linguistic communication planning and\ninference processes have a role at least as important as coding and\ndecoding processes. The speaker plans her speech act according to her\ncommunicative intention; the addressee uses, among other sources, the\ninformation decoded to infer (recognize) the speaker\u2019s\ncommunicative intention.\n\nImplicature (conventional, conversational, particularized,\ngeneralized)\n\nGrice distinguished what the speaker says from what she implicates by\nan utterance. The category of implicature refers to what the speaker\nsuggests, implies or communicates beyond what she says. Among\nimplicatures he made a further distinction between conventional,\ngenerated by the conventional meaning of certain words, and\nnon-conventional ones. Within non-conventional implicatures, he\ndistinguished between conversational, affected, among other factors,\nby conversational principles and maxims, and non-conversational. And\nfinally, among conversational implicatures between particularized,\ndepending on particular features of contexts, and generalized ones.\nGrice pointed out that conversational implicatures have the following\nproperties: (i) they are calculable, that is, inferable from, among\nother things, the cooperative principle and the conversational maxims;\n(ii) they are cancelable either explicitly (adding something like\n\u201cbut I did not meant that\u201d) or contextually, by changing\nthe context; and (iii) except those implicatures based on the maxims\nof manner, they are non-detachable, i.e., there is no way of saying\nthe same thing that would not carry the implicature. The last two\nfeatures, cancelability and non-detachability are known as the\n\u2018tests\u2019 for the presence of an alleged implicature.\n\nImplicit/explicit meaning\n\nIn the traditional Gricean picture, \u2018explicit meaning\u2019\ncorresponds to the sentence\u2019s conventional meaning; or to the\nmeaning obtained by the combination of conventional meaning and those\ncontextual aspects required by the conventional meaning; in other\nwords, to the result of sentence conventional\nmeaning+disambiguation+reference fixing, i.e., what is said.\nThe remaining of utterance meaning, in particular presuppositions and\nimplicatures, would be regarded as implicit meaning within the Gricean\npicture. Grice\u2019s categories of conventional implicature and\ngeneralized conventional implicatures, however, pose problems to the\ndistinction between the explicit and the implicit. After Grice, the\nlimits between them are not very clear yet, despite relevance\ntheorists\u2019s notion of \u2018explicature\u2019 or Bach\u2019s\n\u2018impliciture.\u2019\n\nIndexical\n\nTo determine the reference of an indexical expression (that is, to\ndetermine what a speaker is referring to by the utterance of an\nindexical expression), the interpreter must resort to context. This is\nthe most prominent property of indexical expressions: without varying\ntheir meaning, they can change their content from context to context.\nParadigmatic indexical expressions are personal pronouns\n(\u2018I,\u2019 \u2018you,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019\u2026),\ndemonstratives (\u2018this,\u2019 \u2018that\u2019), time and\nplace adverbs (\u2018here,\u2019 \u2018there,\u2019\n\u2018now,\u2019 \u2018yesterday,\u2019\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019\u2026). But indexicality is a more general\nphenomenon: verb tense and aspect point to context for determining the\nrelevant temporal point or interval. The semantic information of some\nindexical expression leaves little room for doubts about what to look\nfor in context: \u2018I\u2019 refers to the speaker,\n\u2018here\u2019 refers to the place the speaker is in,\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019 to the day starting at midnight of the day of\nutterance. These are called \u2018pure\u2019 or\n\u2018automatic\u2019 indexicals, in contrast to\n\u2018discretionary\u2019 indexicals, whose semantic information\ndoes not determine the referent, and it is necessary to appeal to\nspeaker\u2019s intentions to do so (Perry 2001). Indexical\nexpressions have been called \u2018deictic,\u2019 \u2018egocentric\nparticulars\u2019 and \u2018token-reflexive expressions.\u2019\n\nIntention\n\nIt is a kind of mental state, like belief and desire, for example.\nFrom the point of view of the mental cause theory of action,\nintentions cause actions.\n\nBeing caused by an intention distinguishes movements (or absences of\nmovement) which are actions from mere events, and so, among bodily\nmovements, intentional actions from mere reflexes. The object of\nintention can be represented as a proposition representing the\nmovements (she moved her arm on purpose), or as various results\nexpected or hoped for as a result of the movement (she checkmated her\nopponent, and made him cry, on purpose).\n\nIntentionality\n\nThe word \u2018intention\u2019 is relatively unambiguous outside of\nphilosophy. But philosophers use the word \u2018intention\u2019 and\nespecially the adjective \u2018intentional\u2019 to refer to a\nfeature of a class of mental states that includes but is not limited\nto intentions ordinarily understood. This is the property of being\nabout or directed at objects, including not only\nreal concrete objects, but also abstract and fictional objects,\nproperties, and states of affairs. Thus believing that it is\nraining, hoping to get a computer for Christmas, talking\nabout Sherlock Holmes, figuring out the square root of\nsix hundred and twenty five, are all intentional states and\nactivities, as is intending to bake a cake. It is often\nassumed that minds, mental states, have intrinsic intentionality, and\nthat utterances and sentences have only intentionality in a derived\nsense: they have it from the intentionality of the mental state they\nexpress. \n\nIntentionality (with a \u2018t\u2019) should not be confused with\nintensionality (with an \u2018s\u2019). The latter\nis another technical expression of logic and philosophy; intensions\nare opposed to extensions. Russell\u2019s example is that the\nintension of \u2018featherless biped that is not a plucked\nchicken\u2019 is quite different than the intension of \u2018human\nbeing,\u2019 although their extensions are (perhaps) the same.\nExtensions include classes, sets, and functions considered as sets of\nordered pairs and truth-values. Intensions are meaning, rules,\nproperties, functions as ordinarily conceived, and propositions. In\npossible-worlds semantics intensions are often identified\nwith sets of possible worlds or functions that take possible worlds as\narguments. A property, for example, might be identified with a\nfunction from worlds to set of objects (those that have the property\nin the world), and a proposition with a set of worlds (those in which\nit is true). Whether such an identification is meant as a reduction or\nexplanation of intensions as extensions, or simply as a way of\nmodeling intensions as extensions, varies from theorist to\ntheorist.\n\nLiteral/non-literal\n\nSome take this to be a distinction about word meaning. According to\nthis view, beyond their conventional or literal meaning, words can\nhave figurative or non-literal meanings: metaphoric, ironic, metonymic\nmeanings. After the rise of pragmatic studies, the distinction is\nconsidered mostly to be one at the speaker\u2019s meaning level. When\nthe speaker\u2019s meaning is closed to the conventional meaning of\nthe sentence uttered the speaker is said to be speaking literally.\nWhen it departs from conventional meaning is considered non-literal.\nOf course, the distinction is not clear cut: how much must the\nspeaker\u2019s meaning depart from conventional meaning to be\nconsidered as non-literal? Some authors prefer to talk about a\ncontinuum rather than a two-sided distinction.\n\nLocutionary, illocutionary, perlocutionary\n\nIn terms of Austin\u2019s speech act theory these are three main\nlevels to be distinguished in a speech act. Every speech act is an act\nof saying something. This is the locutionary level. Within it\nAustin distinguished three more: the phonetic act (the act of\nproducing some sounds), the phatic act (the act of uttering\nsome words pertaining to the vocabulary of a certain language\norganized according to the rules of its grammar), and the\nrhetic act (the act of using those words with a certain sense\nand reference). But in saying something one does\nsomething. This is the illocutionary level. And, finally,\nby saying something one gets some (intended or unintended)\neffects in the audience. This is the perlocutionary level.\nSearle casts doubt on the distinction between locutionary and\nillocutionary acts, not seeing the necessity of the former category.\nAs it has developed, speech act theory has been almost entirely\ndevoted to study of the illocutionary level.\n\nPerformative utterance\n\nAustin contrasted between statements, traditionally considered as the\nonly utterances with any philosophical importance, with performative\nutterances that would not be considered as being true or false, and\nrather than merely saying something are better considered as acts of\ndoing something. He further distinguished between explicit\nand implicit performative utterances. The first are those whose main\nverb, called \u2018performative verb,\u2019 makes explicit the\nparticular act that the speaker is performing in producing the\nutterance. These verbs usually present a canonical form: (in English)\nthe first person singular in the present active, or the second person\nof the passive. Not all implicit performative utterances can be made\nexplicit through a performative utterance. Following Austin\u2019s\ndiscussion, all utterances end up being performative, so that the\ncontrast between them and statements seems to make no sense any more.\nThe concept of performative utterance was supplanted in the\ndevelopment of speech act theory by the concept of speech act.\n\nSentence\n\nIt is traditionally defined as the (grammatical) complex expression\ncapable of expressing a complete thought or proposition. This\ndefinition is questioned by the assumption that thoughts or\npropositions are expressed by utterances (or speakers). According to\nthe contextualist thesis, no sentence expresses a complete\n(truth-evaluable) proposition; i.e., there are no\n\u2018eternal\u2019 sentences. From the viewpoint of pragmatics,\nsentences can be conceived as utterance-types, resulted from\nabstracting all elements except the linguistic expressions used. The\nissue of what counts as a complete (grammatical) sentence opposed to a\nsub-sentential complex expression pertains to syntax, rather than to\nsemantics or pragmatics.\n\nSpeech act\n\nSpeech acts are communicative acts performed through the oral or\nwritten use of language. Within speech acts, Austin distinguished\namong locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary levels, but speech\nact theory has been devoted almost exclusively to the illocutionary\nlevel, so that \u2018speech act\u2019 and \u2018illocutionary\nact\u2019 are in practice synonymous terms. An elementary speech act\nconsists of a propositional content and an illocutionary force.\nIllocutionary force concerns the act the speaker intends to do in\nperforming the speech act. All illocutionary forces, in Searle\u2019s\nversion of speech act theory, can be grouped into five classes,\naccording to their basic intention or illocutionary point: assertives,\ncommissives, directives, declaratives and expressives. The\nillocutionary force and the propositional content of a speech act\ndetermine its conditions of success and satisfaction.\n\nType-Token\n\n\u2018Alabama\u2019: how many letters does this word have? If we\ncount letter tokens, the answer is 7. If we count letter types, the\nanswer could be 4 (\u2018a,\u2019 \u2018l,\u2019 \u2018b,\u2019\n\u2018m\u2019) or 5 (if we distinguish between capital and small\nletters). If you say \u201cYou are wrong\u201d to me, and I say\n\u201cYou are wrong\u201d to you, we have produced different tokens\nof the same type. Usually tokens are conceived as marks on paper, or\nsounds that travel through space.\n\nTokens can be typed in various ways. We might consider \u201cLife is\nfun\u201d and \u201cLife is fun\u201d as two tokens of the\nsame type, if fonts are not relevant, or different if they are. In\nsemantics and pragmatics, the default way of typing tokens is by the\nsyntax and semantics of the phrases produced according to the language\nused.\n\nAt the time the distinction was made by Peirce (1931\u201358, sec.\n4.537), it was pretty straightforward, with just spoken and written\ntokens to worry about. If I mail you a letter, you see the same token\nI produced. If I speak to you, you hear the same token I produced.\n\nThings are more complicated now. Suppose I send you an email. It seems\nI produce one token on my screen and another of the same type appears\non your screen, with the same content, at least in ordinary cases.\nSimilarly if I send you a recording. The extension of type/token\ndistinction to modern technology is not a settled issue, however.\n\nSo conceived, token are objects, and written tokens, at least, can be\nre-used. A department might have a reusable note, \u201cI am at\nlunch,\u201d that various faculty can put on their doors at different\ntimes. The same token is used; the type is the same, but the content\nchanges from door to door and time to time.\n\nUtterances are usually taken to be intentional acts, and not the\ntokens produced. But some thinkers take utterances to simply be\ntokens. More commonly those who want to emphasize the importance of\ntokens refer to utterances conceived as acts, as a tokening;\na number of writers use this terminology. \n\nUtterance\n\nConceived as acts, utterances have properties that are crucial to\npragmatics. An utterance is most often taken to be a linguistic action\nperformed by a certain speaker in a certain place at a certain moment.\nIt has, then, the ontological status of actions: each utterance is a\nunique historical event; it is a token, not a type; an utterance made\nby one speaker cannot be made by another one; an utterance made here\nand now cannot be made there later. In Linguistics,\n\u2018utterance\u2019 is often used for the action of pronouncing\norally a sentence, but philosophers tend to also include writing,\nsigning, and other modes of language use, and for the action of using\na sub-sentential expression. It is the view of many but not all\npragmatists that the primary bearers of truth-conditional contents are\nutterances, not sentences; or, even better, that truth-conditional\ncontents or propositions are expressed by the speakers who utter\nsentences, not by the sentences themselves. Utterances of declarative\nsentences are called \u2018statements.\u2019\n",
