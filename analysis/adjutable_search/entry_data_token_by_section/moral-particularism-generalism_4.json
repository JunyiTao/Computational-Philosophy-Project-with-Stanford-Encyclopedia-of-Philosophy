    "main_text": "Semantic/Conceptual Arguments\n5. Semantic/Conceptual Arguments\n\nGeneralists sometimes invoke premises about the nature of moral\nconcepts or about the meanings of moral words to argue for their view.\nUltimately these arguments appeal to what can be derived from a\ncertain kind of competence\u2014either semantic or conceptual\ncompetence. It is probably no accident that purely semantic/conceptual\narguments to settle the debate over particularism/generalism have been\nmonopolized by generalists. If the generalist could show that\nsemantic/conceptual competence commits one to some specific moral\nprinciple(s), or to the existence and availability of some such\nprinciples, then that would already be enough to establish an\nambitious form of generalism. By contrast, a particularist who showed\nonly that such competencies do not yet commit one either to some\nspecific moral principle(s) or to the existence and availability of\nsuch principles would not yet have established a very ambitious form\nof particularism. For that negative conclusion is logically consistent\nwith the availability of a convincing epistemological, practical or\nmetaphysical argument for the existence and availability of suitable\nmoral principles.\n\nGeneralists can and have proceeded in one of two main ways here.\nFirst, they might argue that semantic/conceptual competence directly\ncommits one to the truth of some specific moral principle(s). Second,\nthey might argue that such competence commits one only to the weaker\nthesis that if there are any substantive moral truths then\nthere must be some true moral principle(s). This second thesis is\nweaker both in that it takes a conditional form, so that an error\ntheorist could endorse it but deny the existence of any true moral\nprinciples and in that it does not entail that there is some\nspecific moral principle(s) to which one is committed insofar as one\nthinks there are substantive moral truths. Consider each of these\nstrategies in turn.\n\nThe most ambitious and straightforward version of the first strategy\nis effectively just to argue for a form of analytic naturalism in\nmeta-ethics. For example, consider the meta-ethical theory that\n\u201cis morally right\u201d just means \u201cis an action\nwhich maximizes happiness\u201d, where \u201chappiness\u201d is\nitself cashed out in purely naturalistic terms. Any convincing\nargument for that theory would provide a way of carrying out a very\nambitious version of the first of the two strategies discussed above.\nClearly, insofar as that theory is correct, semantic competence with\n\u201cis morally right\u201d is enough to commit one to the thesis\nthat, necessarily, an action is morally right if and only if it\nmaximizes happiness, and that certainly looks like just the\nright sort of generalization to function as a principle qua\nstandard in the sense laid out in\n section 2.\n\nOf course, this strategy for defending generalism is for good reason a\nhighly controversial one. For a start, nobody has come close to\noffering a fully reductive definition of predicates like \u201cis\nmorally right\u201d which has met with widespread assent. Moreover,\nsome philosophers are sceptical of the very idea that knowing the\nmeaning of a word (or possessing a concept) is already enough, in\nprinciple, to know how to live a good life. In way, this concern about\npulling a highly substantive rabbit out of a purely\nsemantic/conceptual hat can be seen as what lies behind one of the\nhistorically most influential arguments against analytic naturalism,\nnamely G.E. Moore\u2019s \u201cOpen Question Argument\u201d (Moore\n1922 [1903]). Finally, anyone who is initially sympathetic to\nparticularism is very unlikely to find analytic naturalism an ex\nante plausible view, given how trivially it entails a very robust\nform of generalism. There is a sense, then, in which this strategy for\ndefending generalism, however sound it might turn out to be, is\nunlikely to convince anyone who needs convincing (cf. Jackson, Pettit,\n& Smith 2000\u2014the argument there seems ultimately to turn\ninto a version of this first strategy).\n\nA less ambitious form of the first strategy focuses on so-called\n\u201cthick\u201d evaluative words or concepts. Such words/concepts\nin some sense have both specific descriptive and normative contents.\nConcepts associated with virtues and vices are classic examples of\nthick evaluative concepts\u2014concepts like courage, justice,\nfairness and generosity are all paradigm cases. The argument for\ngeneralism focusing on these concepts takes the same form as the more\nambitious argument just canvassed. That is, the argument derives a\ncommitment to moral principle(s) from mere conceptual/semantic\ncompetence.\n\nHowever, the intended conclusion of an argument in this style is more\nmodest. For here the relevant principles do not take one from a purely\ndescriptive antecedent to a purely normative all things considered\nconsequent, as with (e.g.) the principle of utility. Rather, the\nrelevant principles here take one from an antecedent deploying a thick\nevaluative concept (like the concept of justice) to a consequent\ndeploying a thin normative concept (like the concept of a reason).\nSuch an argument might maintain, for example, that competence with the\nconcept of justice commits one to a moral principle of the form,\n\u201cif an action is just then there is at least some reason to\nperform it (namely, its justice)\u201d.\n\nEven this modest form of generalism is not uncontroversial. Dancy, for\nexample, argues that even thick evaluative features can vary in their\nnormative valence from one context to another, going so far as to\nmaintain that \u201calmost all the standard thick concepts\u2026are\nof variable relevance\u201d (Dancy 2004: 121). Insofar as this sort\nof view is as much as semantically/conceptually coherent, there can be\nno straightforward derivation of moral principles of the sort\ncanvassed above from mere semantic/conceptual competence. Of course,\nthere may be more \u201chedged\u201d principles linking thick\nevaluative concepts with thin normative concepts\u2014principles\nwhich either enumerate or quantify over further conditions which must\nbe met before the application of a thick evaluative predicate entails\nthe application of a thin normative predicate. In effect, this is just\nthe point about holism not entailing particularism again. However, it\nis also unclear just how one would plausibly argue that insofar as\nsuch hedged principles are not vacuous, they really do follow from\nmere semantic/conceptual competence.\n\nThere may also be some interesting asymmetries between virtue concepts\nand vice concepts which are relevant to how we should think about\nthese arguments. In an interesting series of papers, Rebecca Stangl\nhas argued for a view she calls \u201casymmetrical virtue\nparticularism\u201d (Stangl 2010). On this view, an action is right,\nall things considered, insofar as it is overall virtuous. However, the\nvirtues of an action in any specific respect (justice, courage, or\nwhatever) can vary in normative valence. However, vices on\nthis view are invariable\u2014they always count against an action.\nThe deeper explanation of this asymmetry, on Stangl\u2019s view, is\nthat virtues have \u201ctargets\u201d at which they aim, whereas\nvices are simply tendencies to miss the relevant targets. Vices are\nthus parasitic on virtues but not vice-versa. Thus a given virtue\n(e.g., mercy) can sometimes be wrong-making because it helps explain\nwhy the agent (badly) misses the target associated with some other\nvirtue (e.g., justice). By contrast, Stangl argues, a vice always is a\ntendency to miss some relevant target, and so is therefore always to\nthat extent wrong-making. Insofar as Stangl makes a convincing case\nfor this asymmetry (and obviously a lot more could be said about\nthis), we should be less sympathetic to arguments which hold that\nthere is a semantic/conceptual link between the virtuousness of an\naction in a specific way and the presence of an associated reason for\naction.\n\nA different take on the virtues in relation to particularism has been\ndeveloped by Constantine Sandis (Sandis 2021). Sandis argues that we\nshould be generalists about the moral virtues but particularists about\ndeontic concepts like the concept of what one ought to do, a reason\nfor action, moral duty, and the like. While a directive like \u201cbe\nkind\u201d might hold without exception on this view, Sandis argues\nthat this does not entail that you should always act kindly \u2013\nand that we should reject principles of the latter form. One advantage\nof this combination of views, according to Sandis, is that it can more\neasily explain our practices of moral education. If the virtues have\ninvariant moral value, then it is easier to see how moral education\ncan proceed. Sandis also discusses the relationship between\nexemplifying a virtue and acting virtuously on his view, which he\nargues more radical particularists must say implausible things\nabout.\n\nMoreover, this more modest form of generalism presupposes that our\nthick concepts of justice, courage, generosity, and the like must be\ngenuinely evaluative concepts. But this is controversial. Pekka\nV\u00e4yrynen (2013), for instance, argues that the evaluations we\ntypically associate with thick terms such as \u201cjust\u201d and\n\u201ccourageous\u201d are conversational implications which arise\nfrom our use of those words in a wide range of contexts. Very roughly,\nthe idea is that evaluative content is a kind of generalized content\nwhich is explained pragmatically. For example, it may become common\nknowledge that only people who disapprove of the sexually explicit\ntend to use the word \u201clewd\u201d. In that case, someone who\nuses that word thereby implies that she disapproves of the sexually\nexplicit \u2013 otherwise, why use the word \u201clewd\u201d\ninstead of \u201csexually explicit\u201d, given that one\u2019s\ninterlocutors will reasonably infer from the use of the former that\none disapproves of the sexually explicit.\n\nIf this is right, then the status of thick words as evaluative depends\non contingent facts about the pragmatics of our use of those words.\nThere is then an important sense in which thick terms are, on this\nview, descriptive in their semantic content. So although there is a\nbroader kind of speaker competence which involves understanding the\nconversational defaults associated with the relevant words, this is\nnot the kind of semantic competence that could ground an argument for\ngeneralism or particularism. Semantic competence with thick words is\nalso unlikely to commit one to any interesting moral principles.\nDepending on our views of concepts, this view about thick language can\nallow that some thinkers\u2019 concepts of justice, generosity, and courage\nmay be evaluative. But that is unlikely to be essential to those\nconcepts, nor will the capacity forthought about justice and other\nthick notions depend on having genuinely evaluative thick concepts\n(V\u00e4yrynen 2013: 123\u20134, 206). In that case, competence with\nconcepts like justice, courage, and generosity is also unlikely to\ncommit us to any interesting moral principles. Moreover, the more\nmodest form of generalism may require that a concept isn\u2019t a concept\nof justice, or courage, or generosity, unless it is evaluative. In\nthat case the pragmatic view of thick evaluative language would\nsupport the view that there are no thick evaluative concepts and,\ntherefore, no such thing as competence with thick evaluative\nconcepts.\n\nHowever, generalists do not have a monopoly on arguments which take\ntheses about thick evaluative concepts/predicates as their main\npremise. Some particularists argue that thick evaluative concepts are\n\u201cshapeless\u201d with respect to the descriptive (see\nespecially McDowell 1981). Others take a more metaphysical approach,\nand argue that thick evaluative properties are \u201cirreducibly\nthick\u201d in a way that puts pressure on the generalist. Indeed,\nsome go so far as to suggest that this even undermines some important\nforms of supervenience (see, e.g., Roberts 2011). Whether these\narguments are forceful may depend on the extent to which the argument\nthat there really are thick evaluative concepts or properties\nin the needed sense can avoid begging the question. In this context,\nit is not enough that no \u201cshape\u201d at the descriptive level\nis built into the meaning of evaluative concepts. Such a weaker\nshapelessness thesis would seem to rule out only principles that are\nboth analytic and reductive. But it seems compatible with the\npossibility that someone who did know the extension of evaluative\nconcepts could then discover a unity or \u201cshape\u201d to that\nextension which could be expressed using descriptive concepts. To rule\nout this possibility would seem to require a stronger shapelessness\nthesis according to which the extension of evaluative terms, properly\nunderstood, has no shape at all. Generalists will want to see an\nargument for this stronger thesis. Perhaps more importantly, though,\nsettling whether this stronger version of the shapelessness thesis is\ntrue would seem to require more than a priori theorizing\nabout moral concepts and more than semantic theorizing about\nevaluative terms. (For discussion of shapelessness and the metaethical\nlessons to be drawn from it see V\u00e4yrynen 2014 and Miller\n2003.)\n\nSo much for the first of the two strategies for giving a\nsemantic/conceptual argument for generalism canvassed above. What\nabout the second? Recall that the second strategy is less ambitious\ninsofar as it aims to establish only a conditional thesis linking\nsubstantive moral truth to the existence of some moral principle(s) or\nother. The guiding idea here is that a proper analysis of our moral\nconcepts will reveal that deploying those concepts to make a\nsubstantive moral judgment commits one to the existence and truth of\nsome moral principle(s) or other which somehow explains the truth of\nthat judgment. Crucially, though, this commitment to the existence of\nsome such moral principle(s) does not entail that the speaker is\ncommitted to any particular moral principle(s), or even to\nthe possibility in principle of discovering what the relevant\nprinciple(s) are.\n\nA modified version of T.M. Scanlon\u2019s contractualist theory of\n\u201cwhat we owe one another\u201d (Scanlon 1998) helps to\nillustrate this strategy. Scanlon himself does not intend his theory\nas a conceptual analysis, in part because there are strands of moral\nthinking, like our thoughts about the moral status of nonhuman animals\nand the environment and certain forms of moralizing about human\nsexuality, which do not fit very well into his proposed framework.\nHowever, a version of his theory which was offered as an analysis of\nour moral concepts would provide a clear illustration of the strategy\nfor defending generalism under consideration. On Scanlon\u2019s view,\nto be morally wrong in the sense of \u201cwrong\u201d associated\nwith what he calls the \u201cmorality of what we owe one\nanother\u201d is to be forbidden by principles for the general\nregulation of human behaviour which nobody could reasonably reject.\nThe notion of the \u201creasonable\u201d is a thick evaluative\nconcept, so the view is not a reductive one. If the view were to be\nunderstood as following directly from an analysis of our moral\nconcepts, then it would follow that anyone who makes a substantive\nmoral judgment that some action is morally wrong would thereby be\ncommitted to the existence of at least a range of moral principles\n(the \u201creasonable\u201d ones) which are such that they all\nforbid the action in question. At the same time, making such a\njudgment does not entail that one can articulate what the relevant\nprinciple(s) is (are), or even that they are such that one could in\nprinciple discover them.\n\nAnother way of arguing for this sort of view is to take a broader\nfocus on normative and evaluative language. On some views (e.g., Ridge\n2014), all uses of \u201cgood\u201d, \u201creason\u201d,\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d advert to\nstandards of some kind, but the context of utterance\ndetermines the relevant kind of standards. Sometimes, as in moral\ncontexts, the relevant standards will be normative in some rich sense.\nOther times, the relevant standards will be purely conventional, as\nwhen we discuss what one ought to do as a matter of etiquette. In\nother contexts the standards will be purely strategic/instrumental, as\nwhen we discuss what move one ought to make in a game of chess, say,\nor what military strategy is best, but where one can sincerely make\nthese judgments while finding chess a total waste of time or being a\ncommitted pacifist. The view aims to accommodate the\ncontext-sensitivity of the relevant words without implausibly\npostulating a brute ambiguity across the wide variety of contexts in\nwhich such words are used. As with the conceptual version of\nScanlon\u2019s view, this view is also one on which making a\nsubstantive moral judgment commits one to the existence of a\nrange of moral standards which require the relevant action (or count\nthe relevant consideration as a reason, or whatever).\n\nAn attraction of this strategy is that it draws its plausibility from\nhigh level semantic features of words like \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201creason\u201d, \u201cought\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d which\nare not specific to normative contexts. It is therefore perhaps\nespecially unlikely to beg the question against the particularist.\nThis stands in sharp contrast with the attempt to derive specific\nmoral principles from mere competence with moral words or\nconcepts.\n",
