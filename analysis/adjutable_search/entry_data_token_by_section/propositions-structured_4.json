    "main_text": "Some Recent Accounts of Structured Propositions || The Structured Intension Approach\n3.2 The Structured Intension Approach\n\nHaving seen the main features of neo-Russellian approaches, let us\nturn to structured meaning accounts. The roots of these accounts can\nbe traced to Rudolf Carnap [1947], and his notion of intensional\nisomorphism. David Lewis [1972] and Max Cresswell [1985] have worked\nout similar, detailed versions of the structured meanings approach,\nthough there are important differences in their views.\nCresswell\u2019s [1985] version of the view will be discussed\n here.[29]\n Because our concern is with conceptions of structured propositions,\nthere are many features of Cresswell [1985] that will not be discussed\n(e.g. Cresswell\u2019s account of the semantics of verbs of\npropositional attitude).\n\nBoth Lewis [1972] and Cresswell [1985] are motivated by some of the\nsame considerations that motivated neo-Russellians like Salmon and\nSoames. Lewis and Cresswell both wish to find a more fine grained\n\u201csemantic value\u201d for sentences than functions from worlds\n(or, as in Lewis [1972], indices) to truth values or, equivalently,\nsets of worlds. For example, Cresswell [1985] claims that verbs of\npropositional attitude are (sometimes) sensitive to more than the\nintensions (functions from worlds/indices to truth values) of the\nsentences they embed. Thus Cresswell claims that\n\n\n\u2026one might easily have two sentences \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 that are true in exactly the same worlds and yet are\nsuch that\n\nx \u03c6s that \u03b1\n\nis true, but\n\nx \u03c6s that \u03b2\n\nis false. (Cresswell [1985] p. 73; \u03c6 of course is a verb of\npropositional attitude).\n\n\nThus Cresswell wishes to associate with a sentence (or more\naccurately, a \u2018that\u2019 clause) some semantic value that is\nmore fine grained than a set of worlds, so that attitude verbs may\n(sometimes) distinguish between sentences that are true in exactly the\nsame worlds. Strictly, Cresswell holds that sometimes attitude verbs\nare sensitive only to the sets of worlds in which the sentences they\nembed are true (i.e. their intensions); but sometimes attitude verbs\nare sensitive to more than this. In these latter cases, Cresswell\nwishes to associate a semantic value more fine grained than a set of\nworlds with the embedded sentence (or \u2018that\u2019 clause).\nCresswell accomplishes this by holding that \u2018that\u2019 in\nEnglish attaches to a sentence to form a name, and that\n\u2018that\u2019 in this role is highly ambiguous. In one of its\nmeanings, \u2018that\u2019 attaches to a sentence and forms a name\nof the intension of the sentence (i.e. the set of worlds in which it\nis\n true).[30]\n In such cases, the attitude verb is sensitive only to the intension\nnamed by the \u2018that\u2019 clause following it. However,\n\u2018that\u2019 has another meaning on which it combines with a\nsentence to form the name of a much more fine-grained entity (in the\nsense that sentences true in all the same worlds may be associated\nwith different fine-grained entities). In such cases, verbs of\nattitude are sensitive to differences in these fine-grained entities.\nSince our concern is with structured propositions, or with semantic\nvalues of sentences more fine grained than sets of worlds, the focus\nwill henceforth be on Cresswell\u2019s account of these fine-grained\nentities named by some \u2018that\u2019\n clauses.[31]\n Henceforth, then, when the fine grained entity associated with a\nsentence or \u2018that\u2019 clause on Cresswell\u2019s view is\ndiscussed, what is being discussed is what a \u2018that\u2019 clause\ncontaining the sentence names, given that the meaning of\n\u2018that\u2019 in the \u2018that\u2019 clause is the one that\nwhen combined with the sentence yields a name of the most fine grained\nentity named by any \u2018that\u2019 clause in which the sentence\noccurs. This is important to bear in mind, since for Cresswell,\nstrictly speaking, a sentence not in a \u2018that\u2019 clause does\nnot express this fine grained entity.\n\nConsider the sentence\n\n(7) Max\nruns.\n\n\nFor Cresswell, the meaning of a predicate like \u2018runs\u2019 is\nessentially its intension: a function from individuals to sets of\nworlds (it maps an individual to the worlds at which she\n runs).[32]\n Let Ir be this intension. The meaning of a\nname like \u2018Max\u2019 (in some cases at least) is simply its\nreferent: o. Thus, the fine grained entity associated with (7)\nis the ordered pair:\n\n(7a) <\u2009o,\nIr\u2009>\n\n\nThe negation of (7) will be associated with the following:\n\n(7b) <\u2009NOT,\n<\u2009o,\nIr\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere NOT is the function from sets of worlds to sets of worlds that\nmaps a set of worlds to its complement. Finally, the sentence:\n\n(8) Someone\nruns.\n\n\nis associated with\n\n(8a) <\u2009\u03a3,\nIr\u2009>\n\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the function from functions from individuals to sets\nof worlds to sets of worlds such that \u03a3(f)={w: for\nsome o, w is in f(o)}. \n\nIt should be clear that as on the neo-Russellian approach, sentences\nthat are true in all the same worlds may be associated with different\nfine grained entities of the sort posited by Cresswell. For example,\neven if \u2018All brothers are siblings\u2019 and \u2018All\nbachelors are male\u2019 are true in exactly the same worlds, the\nfine grained entity associated with the latter will contain the\nmeaning (function from individuals to sets of worlds) of\n\u2018male\u2019 and the fine grained entity associated with the\nformer will not. It should also be clear that the semantic values of\nexpressions are recoverable from the propositions expressed by\nsentences containing them. For example, the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as it occurs in (7) is a constituent of the\nfine-grained entity expressed by (7) (i.e. (7a)). Similar remarks\napply to (7b) and (8a).\n\nA final remark about Cresswell\u2019s view is in order. The\nfine-grained entities we have been discussing are what verbs of\npropositional attitude are sensitive to when they are sensitive to\nmore than the intension/set of worlds associated with a sentence they\nembed. However, they do not seem to be the primary bearers of truth\nfor Cresswell. For Cresswell, each sentence is associated with a set\nof worlds/intension, which Cresswell calls a proposition; and the\ntruth or falsity of a sentence at a world is determined by what\nproposition it expresses. So these seem to be the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsity for\n Cresswell.[33]\n Thus, it appears that for Cresswell, in contrast to the\nneo-Russellians, the primary bearers of truth and falsity and the fine\ngrained entities associated with the sentences (or \u2018that\u2019\nclauses) that verbs of attitude embed and to which they are\n(sometimes) sensitive are different.\n",
