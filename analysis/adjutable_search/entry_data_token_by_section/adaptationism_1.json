Different Flavors of Adaptationism\n\n\n Recent work in the philosophy of biology\n(Orzack and Sober 1994a, Sober 1996, Amundson 1988, 1990, Godfrey-Smith\n2001) has helped uncover three \u201cflavors\u201d of adaptationism;\nthese reflect differences in beliefs among current professional\ndevelopers and users of evolutionary arguments. They represent\ncommitments about the state of nature, about the way to do science, and\nabout what is important to study.\n\n\n The first flavor, \u201cempirical\u201d\nadaptationism, is the view that natural selection is ubiquitous, free\nfrom constraints, and provides a sufficient explanation for the\nevolution of most traits, which are \u201clocally\u201d optimal, that\nis, the observed trait is superior to any alternative that does not\nrequire \u201credefining\u201d the organism (Orzack and Sober 1994a).\nThis is a claim about the realized influence of natural selection on\nthe evolution of traits as compared to other evolutionary\ninfluences.\n\n\n The second flavor,\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d adaptationism, is the view that explaining\ntraits as adaptations resulting from natural selection is the central\ngoal of evolutionary biology. This is a claim about the greater\nimportance of some kinds of explanations. Opinions differ as to whether\nthis is a scientific claim or an aesthetic claim (see below).\n\n\n The third flavor,\n\u201cmethodological\u201d adaptationism, is the view that looking\nfirst for adaptation via natural selection is the most efficient\napproach when trying to understand the evolution of any given\ntrait. This could be true even if adaptations are rare (although\na substantial majority of biologists believe that adaptations are\ncommon). The belief that adaptations are common is quite\ndifferent from the claim that only natural selection need be invoked in\norder to explain these adaptations.\n\n\n The flavors of adaptationism are logically\nindependent. The truth of one claim does not necessarily imply the\ntruth of the other claims. For example, it could be true that most\ntraits are adaptations that can be explained by invoking no more than\nnatural selection (the first flavor) but still be false that it is most\nfruitful to look first for adaptation (the third flavor). In fact,\nrealized intellectual stances are more circumscribed in that most\nadaptationists are advocates of empirical, explanatory, and\nmethodological adaptationism (e.g., Charnov 1982, Dawkins 1976, Maynard\nSmith 1978). In addition, there are many biologists who are advocates\nof explanatory and methodological adaptationism, but who explicitly\nreject empirical adaptationism (e.g., Mayr 1983). On the other hand,\nsome biologists reject all three flavors of adaptationism (e.g.,\nCarroll 2005, Wagner et al. 2000, West-Eberhard 2003). There are many\ninstances of competing adaptationist and pluralist explanations of the\nsame biology. For example, Cain and Sheppard (1954) and Lamotte (1959)\nfamously present competing explanations of morphological traits in land\nsnails; Ackermann and Cheverud (2004) test adaptationist and\npluralist explanations of the diversification of morphological\nevolution of humans and their ancestors; Millstein (2007b)\nillustrates the differences between adaptationism and pluralism by\npresenting the same biology (of a heat-shock protein) from both\nperspectives.\n\n\n Distinguishing among the flavors of\nadaptationism was an important advance in our biological and\nphilosophical understanding. These flavors of adaptationism differ in\ntheir practical implications for evolutionary biology. We now\ndiscuss each in detail.\n",
