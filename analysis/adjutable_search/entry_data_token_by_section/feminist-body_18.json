    "main_text": "The Ethics of Embodiment\n9. Conclusion\n\nFeminist theorists of embodiment have made a central contribution to\nphilosophy of embodiment and ensured, along with critical race\ntheorists and theorists of (dis)ability, that attention to the body\nplays a central role in metaphysical, ethical, social and political\nthought. The theories which emerge are not simply of gendered\nembodiment. They provide a general account of the relations between\nbodies and selves. What is stressed within the feminist literature is\nthe range of philosophical theories which are required to make sense\nof the embodied self. Naturalising frameworks need supplementing with\nphenomenological, poststructuralist and psychoanalytic ones, in just\nway the feminist theorists have exemplified, if embodied subjectivity\nis to become intelligible.\n",
