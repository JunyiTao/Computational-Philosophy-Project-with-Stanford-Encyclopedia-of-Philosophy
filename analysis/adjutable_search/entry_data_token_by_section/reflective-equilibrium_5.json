Principles and Theories\n\nReflective equilibrium, at least on its classic construal, arises\nwhere judgments are brought together with their representation in\nprinciples. Theories play a dual role as agglomerations of the\nprinciples and priority rules that are the outputs of reflective\nequilibrium, and as sources of argument for selecting those\nprinciples. This section considers the role of principles and theories\nin reflective equilibrium.\n",
