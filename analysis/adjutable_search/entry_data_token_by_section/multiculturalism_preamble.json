    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea of multiculturalism in contemporary political discourse and\nin political philosophy reflects a debate about how to understand and respond to the\nchallenges associated with cultural diversity based on ethnic, national, and religious differences. The term \u201cmulticultural\u201d is often used as a descriptive term to\ncharacterize the fact of diversity in a society, but in what follows,\nthe focus is on multiculturalism as a normative ideal in the context of Western liberal\ndemocratic societies. While the term has come to encompass a variety\nof normative claims and goals, it is fair to say that proponents of\nmulticulturalism find common ground in rejecting the ideal of the \u201cmelting pot\u201d in\nwhich members of minority groups are expected to assimilate into the\ndominant culture. Instead, proponents of multiculturalism endorse an ideal in which members of minority groups can maintain their distinctive collective identities and\npractices. In the case of immigrants, proponents emphasize that\nmulticulturalism is compatible with, not opposed to, the integration\nof immigrants into society; multiculturalism policies provide fairer\nterms of integration for immigrants.\n\nModern states are organized around the language and culture of\nthe dominant groups that have historically constituted them. As a result, members\nof minority cultural groups face barriers in pursuing their social\npractices in ways that members of dominant groups do not. Some\ntheorists argue for tolerating minority groups by leaving them free of\nstate interference (Kukathas 1995, 2003). Others argue that mere\ntoleration of group differences falls short of treating members of\nminority groups as equals; what is required is recognition and\npositive accommodation of minority group practices through what the\nleading theorist of multiculturalism Will Kymlicka has called\n\u201cgroup-differentiated rights\u201d (1995). Some\ngroup-differentiated rights are held by individual members of minority\ngroups, as in the case of individuals who are granted exemptions from\ngenerally applicable laws in virtue of their religious beliefs or\nindividuals who seek language accommodations in education and in\nvoting. Other group-differentiated rights are held by the group qua\ngroup rather by its members severally; such rights are properly called\n\u201cgroup rights,\u201d as in the case of indigenous groups and\nminority nations, who claim the right of self-determination. In the\nlatter respect, multiculturalism is closely allied with\nnationalism.\n\nMulticulturalism is part of a broader political movement for greater inclusion of marginalized groups, including African Americans, women, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities (Glazer 1997, Hollinger 1995, Taylor 1992). This broader political movement is reflected in the \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d debates in the 1980s over whether and how to diversify school curricula to recognize the achievements of historically marginalized groups. But the more specific focus of contemporary theories of multiculturalism is the recognition and inclusion of minority groups defined primarily in terms of ethnicity, nationality, and religion. The main concern of contemporary multiculturalism are immigrants who are ethnic and religious minorities (e.g. Latinx people in the U.S., Muslims in Western Europe), minority nations (e.g. the Basque, Catalans, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Welsh) and indigenous peoples (e.g. Native peoples and indigenous groups in Canada, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand).\n",
