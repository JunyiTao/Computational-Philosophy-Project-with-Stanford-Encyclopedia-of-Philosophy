    "main_text": "Ontology and Logic || Discussing Mally\u2019s Theory\n2.3 Discussing Mally\u2019s Theory\n\n\nMally\u2019s theory of objects has been acknowledged and validated in Zalta\n1983 and 1988 (see also Rapaport 1978, for an informal development of\nsomething like Mally\u2019s view, though the ideas developed there are\ntraced to Meinong, not Mally). Zalta utilizes Mally\u2019s ideas and\nconceptions in order to establish a full-fledged axiomatic theory of\nabstract objects that ensures the existence of these objects with the\nhelp of comprehension principles. Zalta also translated Mally\u2019s\nterminology into modern terms by formulating the distinction between\nan object x instantiating and being determined by a property\nF in terms of the distinction between x\u2019s exemplifying\nproperty F (\u2018Fx\u2019) and x\u2019s encoding\nproperty F (\u2018xF\u2019). Zalta calls exemplifying\nand encoding two (different) \u201cmodes of predication\u201d. But\nthere is some controversy as to whether Mally\u2019s distinction in two\nmodes of predication can be reduced to the distinction between nuclear\nand extranuclear properties (recall, this is a distinction introduced\nby Mally but adopted by Meinong in his work). Dale Jacquette calls\nMally\u2019s introduction of these two modes of predication \u201cMally\u2019s\nheresy\u201d (see Jacquette 1989: 3). He tried to show that the\ndistinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties is \u201cmore\nfundamental\u201d than the distinction between two modes of\npredication in the sense that there is a reduction of the latter to\nthe former but not vice versa (see Jacquette 1989: 5).  However, Zalta\nshowed (1992) that a reduction of two modes of predication to two\nkinds of property has not yet been developed.  Moreover, Mally\u2019s\ntheory (in modern guise) can cope at least with all the problems\nMeinong\u2019s theory can solve. Along these lines, Mally\u2019s student Findlay\nwrote, \n\n[Mally\u2019s theory] removes many\ndifficulties in Meinong\u2019s theory, without abandoning the general\nstandpoint of the theory of objects. (Findlay 1963: 110)\n\n\nMally therefore established a real alternative to Meinong\u2019s theory\nof objects; his theory avoided different modes of being (such as\nMeinong\u2019s famous Au\u00dfersein) as well as the duplication required\nby the distinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties. (In\nreconstructions of Meinong\u2019s theory, e.g., Parsons 1980, every\npredicate has both a nuclear and an extranuclear version, and this is\navoided in Mally\u2019s theory.) Mally\u2019s theory, however, requires an\nontology with a sufficient number of properties\u2014enough to\njointly determine all the conceptual objects we might use to cognize\nand conceptualize ordinary everyday objects. And, of course, it also\npresupposes a kind of comprehension principle that guarantees the\n(abstract) existence of these conceptual objects determined by its\nproperties.\n\n\nWe have seen in detail now that even in his earlier ontological\nwritings Mally developed viable alternatives to Meinong\u2019s theory of\nobjects. Later he distanced himself from Meinong\u2019s philosophy. In\nunpublished letters to Hans Pichler, Mally writes:\n\n\n\nI realized that the theory of objects is based on a big mistake; it\ncan be described as a mix-up of intending and grasping. [\u2026]\nMeinong\u2019s fundamental error is his mistaking the (objective) meaning\nand content of a thought for an object (or the object) of the thought.\n[\u2026] Once you have realized this, you are done with the theory of\nobjects, and with the foundations of Meinong\u2019s philosophy as well.\n(Mally 1934a, January 5 1934)\n\n\nIt may well be that you [Hans Pichler] are already caught by\nMeinong\u2019s thoughts like by an infection, which has to take effect in\norder for its antidote to develop. That is how I experienced it. (Mally\n1934a, January 6 1934)\n\n\n\nMally\u2019s critical stance towards Meinong\u2019s philosophy paved the way\nto his new ontological conceptions, which we want to discuss in the\nnext section.\n",
