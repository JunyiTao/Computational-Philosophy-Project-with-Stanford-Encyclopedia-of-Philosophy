Brentano used that conception not only for\ndistinguishing mental from physical phenomena, but also for developing\na classification of mental phenomena. If intentionality is a\nfundamental feature of any mental act, Brentano argues, differences in\nthe way mental phenomena are directed toward something constitute\ndifferences in kind between mental acts. Judgements are one of the\nthree basic kinds of intentional phenomena with which Brentano deals\nat great length in his Psychology. That is not to say,\nhowever, that Brentano\u2019s theory of judgement is just concerned\nwith psychological issues. Brentano also aims to show how an\nexperience of judging, specifically the experience of judging\ncorrectly, can provide us with a basis for grasping concepts like\nexistence, truth, and logical inference. Brentano\u2019s\ninvestigation of the mental act of judgement promises therefore to\nadvance logic, epistemology, and ultimately metaphysics.\n\nMuch of that work which Brentano started in his Psychology\nremained unfinished. It was left to his students to further flesh out\nhis view by drawing on lecture notes, letters, and unpublished\nmaterial from Brentano\u2019s Nachlass. Whether all the\nclaims that have been ascribed to Brentano in this literature actually\nbelong to his theory remains a matter of debate in the\n literature.[1]\n From a contemporary perspective, an interesting question is which of\nthe following two claims find support in Brentano\u2019s theory:\n\n(A)\nSome judgements have a propositional content, others not.\n(B)\nNo judgement has a propositional content.\n\n\n(B) will sound to the ears of many contemporary readers surprising. We\nare, Brentano would say, in the grip of a misleading view of\njudgement. Consider an ascription of a judgement:\n\nOskar judges that 5 is prime number.\n\nAn influential analysis takes this sentence to put Oskar in a\nrelation, judgement, to an object designated by \u2018that 5 is a\nprime number\u2019, a proposition that can be true or false. This\nsuggests that judgement is an attitude towards a proposition; it is a\npropositional attitude.\n\nBrentano's student Carl Stumpf anticipated the surprise a reader of\n(B) will feel who has accepted the analysis above:\n\n[O]ne must always bear in mind that he [Brentano] used the term\n\u2018judgement\u2019 in a much more general way than most people in\nordinary usage. One must remember that for him every perception, inner\nas well as external, is a judgement, that he already finds in it an\nelementary assent, a positing [Setzung], and that for him any mental\nact seems from the very beginning connected with an evident\nself-affirmation, hence a judgement in this widest sense. This is of\ncourse nowhere near the view that only knows verbally framed\njudgements (statements) with subject and predicate. (Stumpf 1919, 133;\nauthor translation)\n\nFor Brentano the starting point of a theory of judgement is our\nconsciousness of our acceptance \u2014 in his terminology the\nacknowledgement (Annerkennung) \u2014 of our own mental acts and the\nobjects of (outer) perception. From this starting point he tries to\ncapture what seems to us to be a propositional attitude. As we will\nsee in section 5 Brentano held (at least for a time) the view that a\njudgement that something is so-and-so supervenes on some\nacknowledgments.\n", "toc": [{"#OutlBrenTheo": "1.

An Outline of Brentano\u2019s Theory\n\nIn this section, we start with an overview of Brentano\u2019s theory\nof judgement, as far as it is contained in the first edition of the\n Psychology.[2]\n It will be convenient to divide the material covered by Brentano in\nchapter 7 of this work (and the final section of chapter 6) into four\nparts. The first part tries to establish the fundamental difference\nbetween judgements (Urteile) and presentations\n(Vorstellungen); the second part pertains to the relation\nbetween judgement and truth; the third part deals with existential\njudgements and their intentional objects; and the fourth part proposes\na reduction of categorical and hypothetical judgements to the\nexistential form.\n1.1 Part I: Judgements Versus Presentations\n\nAs a philosopher of mind, Brentano takes it to be his task to develop\nspecific accounts of whatever phenomena one finds in inner experience.\nTo do so, one has to pay close attention to the different ways in\nwhich phenomena are directed toward something (see PES 197 [II 32; SVS\n1, 218]), and Kriegel 2017: 99ff). Applying this method to the case of\njudgement, Brentano arrives at the claim that judgements are clearly\ndistinguishable from presentations. The question that concerns him is\nhow precisely they differ. Brentano invokes three negative\nclaims to draw that distinction: \n\n(1)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale)[3]\n in thought is not sufficient for making a judgement.\n\n\nWhen someone asks me \u201cIs any tree red?\u201d I will combine\nthese ideas in pondering the question, but how much I combine them, I\nmight still remain undecided whether they exist together or not. That\nsuffices to make claim (1) plausible.\n\nClaim (1)\n is compatible with the view that judging always means to hold true a\nproposition. For Brentano, that is not the right way to understand\nclaim (1) however. In order to rule out that interpretation, Brentano\ninvokes the following pair of claims:\n\n(2)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale) in thought is not necessary\nfor making a judgement.\n(3)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale) is necessary in formulating a\nsentence or a proposition.\n\n\nTogether, claims (2) and (3) imply that judgements can be made without\njudging a sentence or proposition to be true. That is what Brentano\ntries to establish. Let us see how he tries to achieve this goal.\n\nBrentano considers three possible ways of conceiving of the difference\nbetween presentations and judgements. There may be (i) an intrinsic\ndifference between them, (ii) they may differ in their contents\n(Inhalte), or (iii) in a perfection [Vollkommenheit] with\nwhich these objects are thought (PES 204, [II 42f.; SVS 1, 226]).\n\nLet\u2019s start with (i). What would it mean that the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation is not intrinsic, i.e.,\nextrinsic? It would mean that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation consists in a relational property that one of these\nmental phenomena has while the other lacks it. In this sense the\ndistinction between a bachelor and a husband is extrinsic: bachelors\nlack the relational property of being married to someone; husbands\nhave it. Nothing else distinguishes bachelors and husbands from each\nother: there is no intrinsic property of husbands or bachelors that\ngrounds the relational difference. Is the distinction between\njudgement and presentation like the distinction between husbands and\nbachelors? According to Alexander Bain, it is. For Bain there are two\nkinds of ideas (presentations): those that dispose one to\nact\u2014this is the extrinsic or relational property\u2014and\nothers that don\u2019t. The former are judgements and beliefs, the\nlatter are mere presentations (see Bain 1872: 372f). Mill (1878:\n403\u20134) criticized Bain\u2019s proposal as incomplete. In\ngeneral, a dispositional property like disposing one to act on an\nobject is grounded in its categorical properties. Hence, the\nbelief-constituting disposition to act must be grounded in categorical\nproperties of ideas and these properties seem to be intrinsic. The\nrelational difference is not brute as in the husband/bachelor\ncase.\n\nBrentano finds Mill\u2019s line of thought persuasive (see PES 202f.\n[II 40; SVS 1,\n 224]).[4]\n By Brentano\u2019s lights, any explanation of the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation in terms of a difference in\n\u201cimpact\u201d on mental states or actions is\n unsatisfactory.[5]\n Like Mill, he goes for the first of the three options above: the\ndifference between presentations and judgement is an intrinsic\none.\n\nOn to (ii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement and\npresentation one that concerns the content of the mental mental\nphenomena under consideration? According to the view opposed by\nBrentano, every judgement is a combining or separating of marks\n[Merkmale]. The content of a judgement is the combination of at least\ntwo marks that are either divided or combined in it. Possessing a\ncontent is an intrinsic property of a judgement: every judgement must\nhave a content and the content distinguishes a judgement, in part,\nfrom other mental phenomena. Do judgements and presentations differ in\ncontent (cf. PES 205 [II 44; SVS 1, 227])? Again Brentano\u2019s\nanswer is NO. If I wonder whether there are red trees, the content of\nmy presentation is a combination of the marks redness and tree(hood).\nMy judgement that there are red trees has the same content as the mere\npresentation of a red\n tree.[6]\n\nThis brings us to (iii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement\nand presentation one that concerns a perfection in which mental\nphenomena that have the same object differ? Brentano identifies the\nperfection as strength, intensity or\nvivacity of the mental phenomena concerned. Is, as Brentano\nsays, \u201ca judgement a stronger presentation and a presentation a\nweaker judgement\u201d? (PES 204 [II 44; SVS 1, 226]; author\ntranslation) Brentano says NO. A strong presentation is no judgement.\nThis argument, while suggestive, is not persuasive because the notion\nof strength, vividness or intensity seems unclear. However, in the\nsecond edition Brentano adds an important consideration that improves\nthe argument. If presentation and judgement were distinguished in\nstrength, both would need to have positions on a scale of strength.\nHowever, Brentano now doubts that there is one scale of intensity or\nstrength on which presentations and judgements both lie. Different\ndegrees of conviction that may accompany an act of judgement should\nnot be confused with the degrees of intensity with which an object can\nbe presented to the mind, e.g., in sensation (PES 286f. [II 151ff.;\nSVS 1, 401). If there is not one dimension of strength in which both\njudgement and presentation can differ, strength cannot distinguish\nbetween them.\n\nBrentano concludes that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation is intrinsic and irreducible to other distinctions\nbetween these mental phenomena. Hillebrand (1891: 26\u20137) called\nBrentano\u2019s view therefore an \u201cidiogenetic\u201d theory of\njudgement\u2014it takes judgement to be a fundamental kind of mental\nphenomenon\u2014while \u201callogenetic\u201d theories take\njudgements to be composed out of other mental phenomena that belong to\nfundamental kinds.\n1.2 Part II: Judgement and Truth\n\nBut are things not much easier? Brentano himself says:\n\n\nBy \u201cjudgement\u201d we mean, in accordance with common\nphilosophical usage, acceptance [annehmen](as true) or\nrejection [verwerfen] (as false). We have already noted,\nhowever, that such acceptance or rejection also occurs in cases in\nwhich many people would not use the term \u201cjudgement,\u201d as,\nfor example, in the perception of mental acts and in remembering. (PES\n198 [II 34; SVS 1, 219])\n\n\nBrentano acknowledges that \u201caccepting as true\u201d or\n\u201crejecting as false\u201d is the natural way to describe an act\nof judgement (PES 201 [II 38; SVS 1, 223]). Meanwhile philosophers\nhave changed their habits. While it is still true, of course, that\njudgements can be true or false, most philosophers are swayed by\nFrege\u2019s or Reinach\u2019s argument that all judgements are\nacceptances as\n true.[7]\n When one rejects a proposition as false, e.g., that there is\nextraterrestrial life, this is still a positive judgement for them,\nbecause in making the judgement one takes it to be true that\nno life exists beyond earth. Brentano would contest this by saying\nthat their point only concerns the linguistic expression of our\njudgements, not the judgements themselves. We can find for each\njudgement a sentence that is true if and only if the judgement\nexpressed in it is correct, but that does not show that the judgement\nitself always has a positive quality.\n\nWhy does the characterization of judgement as either an accepting as\ntrue or a rejecting as false not suffice to distinguish judgement from\npresentation? After all, one can present something without accepting\nit as true. Because saying that in judgement we take something to be\ntrue is potentially misleading. The following passage shows what\nBrentano is aiming at:\n\n\nIf we say that every acknowledging judgement [anerkennendes\nUrteil] is an act of taking something to be true, and every\nrejecting judgement [verwerfendes Urteil] an act of taking\nsomething to be false, this does not mean that the former consists in\npredicating truth of what is taken to be true and the latter in\npredicating falsity of what is taken to be false. Our previous\ndiscussions have shown, rather, that what the expressions denote is a\nparticular kind of intentional reception of an object, a distinctive\nkind of mental reference to a content of consciousness. The only\ncorrect interpretation is that anyone who takes something to be true\nwill not only acknowledge the object, but, when asked whether the\nobject is to be acknowledged, will also acknowledge the object\u2019s\nto-be-acknowledgedness [das Anzuerkennensein], i.e., its\ntruth (which is all that is meant by this barbarous expression).\n(PES 240 [II 89; SVS 1, 259]; emphasis added and translation\nimproved).\n\n\nThe point that Brentano wants to get across is a delicate one and\nrequires a careful wording. It is no coincidence that Brentano prefers\nhere the term \u201canerkennen\u201d over\n\u201cannehmen\u201d, which would be closer to common usage\nin philosophy. The reason is that Brentano thinks that the more common\nway of speaking wrongly suggests that one predicates truth when one\naccepts something as true. According to Brentano, as will become clear\nlater, judgement requires no predication (not even a predication of\nexistence). Hence, the difference in meaning between \u201caccepting\n(annehmen)\u201d and \u201cacknowledging\n(anerkennen)\u201d becomes important for\n him.[8]\n\nBrentano\u2019s observation leads to an important result: To say that\nsomething is true does not mean that there is an object, a\nproposition, of which one predicates a property, being true. Rather,\nwe can take the act of judgement itself as the vehicle which is true.\nTo say that a judgement is true means to make a judgement of\nhigher-order, namely to acknowledge that the object of the first\njudgement is worthy of either being acknowledged or rejected.\nPropositions are not needed for making sense of the concept of\ntruth.\n1.3 Part III: Existential Judgements\n\nExistential judgements play a fundamental role in Brentano\u2019s\narguments against other views of judgement as well as in his positive\naccount of judgement. Brentano\u2019s discussion of existential\njudgements aims to show that such judgements cannot be conceived as\npredications of properties (see\n section 1.1)\n and that such judgements are either acknowledgments or rejections of\nobjects.\n\nThe argument focuses on existential propositions and tries to\nestablish that a mental act of denial is on a par with an act of\nacceptance. Note, that by an existential proposition we do not mean\nhere the content of a judgement, but sentences of\nthe following form:\n\n\nA exists, an A exists, As exist.\n\nA does not exist, an A does not exist, As\ndo not exist.\n\n\nThe argument developed by Brentano relies on the following\nprinciple:\n\n\n[W]henever someone acknowledges [anerkennen] a combination of\nmarks he simultaneously acknowledges each particular element of the\ncombination. (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]; authors translation)\n\n\nApplying the principle to the case of judgement, Brentano says:\n\n\nIf this judgement were the acknowledgement of the combination of a\nmark \u201cexistence\u201d with A, then it would include\nthe acknowledgement of each individual element in the combination, and\nhence would include the acknowledgement of A. (ibid.)\n\n\nA note of caution: Brentano reiterates here his claim that combining\nmarks is not sufficient to make a judgement. He also raises a new\nquestion: what does \u2018A\u2019 stand for? If we combine two marks\nand then acknowledge each element of this combination, \u2018A\u2019\nmust stand for a mark. But sometimes he talks as if \u2018A\u2019\ndesignated a particular object. We take this way of talking therefore\nto be a convenient abbreviation. Now back to the main topic.\nAcknowledging A already does all the work that judging that\nA exists is supposed to do: to commit one to the existence of\nA. Since one cannot judge that A exists without\nacknowledging A, judging that A exists is\nnecessarily\n redundant.[9]\n Thus, we get as an intermediary conclusion of the argument the\nfollowing claim:\n\n(4)\nThere is no predication involved in existential judgements.\n\n\nWhat Brentano wants to show is this:\n\n(5)\nPositive and negative existential judgements do not differ in\ntheir \u2018objects\u2019.\n\n\nThe order in which we list the two claims might suggest that (5)\nsomehow follows from (4). But nothing said by Brentano actually\nwarrants this assumption. Brentano takes (5) to be an independent\nclaim supported by the testimony of inner experience:\n\n\nThe same object is present to consciousness whether a person affirms\nit, denies it, or uncertainly asks about it; in the last case it is\nmerely presented, in the first two cases it is simultaneously\npresented and acknowledged or denied. And every object which is the\ncontent of a presentation can possibly also become the content of a\njudgement. (PES 221 [II 63; SVS 1, 241]; in part authors\ntranslation)\n\n\nInner experience is supposed to show us that, when we reject,\nacknowledge or keeps an open mind about an object, we have \u2018the\nsame object in consciousness\u2019. Brentano then moves from\n\u2018same object\u2019 to the conclusion that a judgement, either\nnegative or positive, and a presentation can have exactly the same\ncontent so that the difference between judgement and content does not\nlie in a difference in content. As remarked before, Brentano sometimes\ntalks as if objects are contents. If we read Brentano\u2019s remark\ncharitably, he appeals to introspective knowledge that a presentation\ncan purport to be directed on an object in terms of marks. The\njudgement that is based on this presentation and rejects the object\nthe presentation purports to be directed on as well as the judgement\nthat acknowledges it, share the content of the presentation (the marks\nin terms of which the presentation is directed on something). Hence,\nnegative and positive judgements can have the same content. This gives\nBrentano a reason to endorse\n claim (5).\n His argument once more rules out a propositional analysis of these\njudgements, and may thus buttress his arguments in favor of\n claim (4).\n We will encounter further reasons that speak for accepting (5) later\n(in\n section 5),\n where we discuss Brentano\u2019s reasons for rejecting negative\nproperties.\n\nAt this stage, the structure of Brentano\u2019s theory already leaves\nopen several possible interpretations. Neither the significance of\n (4)\n nor of\n (5)\n in Brentano\u2019s theory are completely clear. That is to say: it\nis not completely clear that Brentano actually needs these two claims\nfor backing up his theory, in particular for backing up his claim that\ncombining two ideas in thought is not necessary for making a judgement\n(=\n claim 2).\n While Brentano presents his theory as a single whole in which claims\n(2), (4), and (5) form a tight package. one may unravel that package\nand accept (2) on the basis of (4) alone or independently of (4) and\n(5) altogether.\n1.4 Part IV: The Reductionist Claims\n\nIn the final part of his theory Brentano turns to so-called\ncategorical propositions. These are the sentences with which\ntraditional logic is primarily concerned: sentences of the form\n\u201cAll S are P\u201d, \u201cNo S is\nP\u201d, \u201cSome S are P\u201d and\n\u201cSome S are not P\u201d. With respect to\nthese propositions, Brentano takes the same view as Leibniz:\n\n\nIt can be shown with utmost clarity that every categorical proposition\ncan be translated without any change of meaning into an existential\nproposition (PES 214, [II 56; SVS 1, 236]).\n\n\nIn order to prove this claim, Brentano offers examples for the\nfollowing translation schemes:\n\n\nA proposition of the form \u201cAll S are P\u201d\nmeans the same as \u201cAn S that is not P does not\nexist.\u201d\n\nA proposition of the form \u201cNo S is P\u201d\nmeans the same as \u201cAn S that is P does not\nexist.\u201d\n\nA proposition of the form \u201cSome S are P\u201d\nmeans the same as \u201cAn S that is exists.\u201d\n\nA proposition of the form \u201cSome S are not\nP\u201d means the same as \u201cAn S that is not\nP exists.\u201d\n\n\nThese are semantic claims about the meanings of sentences. In this\ncase, Brentano trusts our linguistic intuitions and takes them to tell\nus something about the judgements expressed by these\npropositions. The translations are meant to reveal to us the true\nforms of judgement expressed by categorical propositions. Thus,\nBrentano advances the following reduction thesis:\n\n(6)\nCategorical propositions can be reduced to propositions of the\nform \u201cA exists\u201d and \u201cA does not\nexist\u201d. More explicitly: An utterance of a categorical\nproposition always expresses a judgement in which the existence of an\nobject is acknowledged or rejected.\n\n\nNotice that whereas the above translation schemes are symmetrical, the\nreduction thesis involves an asymmetry claim. It does not say\nthat existential propositions express categorical judgements, but\nconversely that categorical propositions express existential\njudgements. There is no explicit argument in Brentano for this\ninterpretation of the translation schemes. Rather, it is the context\nin which Brentano puts forward the reduction thesis that must provide\na justification for it.\n\nHow might this work? Well, consider the following argument which\nBrentano constructs with the help of\n claim (6):\n\n(7)\nEveryone agrees that in categorical propositions of the form\n\u201cAll S are P\u201d, \u201cSome S\nare P\u201d, \u201cNo S is P\u201d and\n\u201cSome S are not P\u201d the copula\n\u201cis\u201d or \u201cis not\u201d merely indicates the quality\nof the judgement and has no meaning of itself.\n(6)\nCategorical propositions can be reduced to propositions of the\nform \u201cA exists\u201d and \u201cA does not\nexist\u201d.\n(8)\nTherefore: The notion \u201cexists\u201d in existential\njudgements does not have a meaning of itself either.\n\n\nIn running this argument, Brentano advances from a claim about the\nmeaning of the copula \u201cis\u201d that he takes to be\nincontestable to a (contestable) claim about the meaning of\n\u201cexists\u201d. It is the direction of this argument that\nrequires the reduction claim made in the second premise. Thus, it is\nthe purpose of the argument that fixes for Brentano the direction in\nwhich the reduction has to go.\n\nIf one accepts the premises, the argument is sound. However, it still\nleaves open how one evaluates the entire argument because there are\nhidden assumptions in the premises that Brentano does not disclose. To\nmake them explicit, one has to read the argument as follows:\n\n\nThe copula does not add anything to the meaning of the terms\nS and P, and hence nothing to the subject matter of\nthe expressed judgement if the subject matter is fixed by these\nconcepts. Therefore, given (6), the term \u201cexists\u201d\nadds nothing to the subject matter of an existential judgement if\nthe subject matter is identified with the subject matter of the\ncategorical proposition which forms the basis of the\nreduction.\n\n\nThe parts in italics are the tacit assumptions that Brentano makes in\nthis argument. Anyone who takes the subject matter of judgements to be\npropositions would deny them and hence the soundness of the argument.\nThat would not immediately disprove the reduction\n claim (6),\n but it would deprive Brentano of a good reason for introducing an\nasymmetry into his translation schemes. Because of this problem, it\nseems questionable whether Brentano\u2019s reduction project in the\nthird part of his theory succeeds. Apparently, Brentano himself\nchanged his mind on the validity of his argument when he later\ndeveloped his theory of double judgement (see\n section 5\n below). That means that he no longer can make use of his initial\nargument to show that \u201cexistence\u201d has no meaning by\nitself.\n2. Brentano and His Precursors on Existential Judgement\n\nWe have seen that Brentano heavily relies on the special case of\nexistential judgements in developing a general account of judgement\nand criticizes other views because they do not work for those cases.\nWhile Brentano\u2019s approach is original, he also draws on a range\nof sources. He finds in Aristotle, Aquinas and Kant anticipations of\nthe idea that existential judgements involve no predication (=\n claim 4).\n However, none of the named philosophers goes as far as Brentano and\ntakes all judgements to be existential. Hence, Brentano can indeed\nclaim that his own theory fills a gap in the history of ideas.\nLet\u2019s consider what Brentano took from his predecessors in\nhistorical order.\n\nIn Psychology (PES 212 fn, [II 54 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 246])\nBrentano says in a long footnote that Aristotle hinted at the right\nconception of existential judgement in Metaphysics and in\nDe Interpretatione. In Metaphysics Book IX (\u03b8)\n10 Aristotle is faced with a problem. He has told his readers that one\njudges truly if one separates in thought what is separated in reality\nand combines in thought what is combined in reality. For example, if\nPlato and foolishness are separated\u2014the former does not have the\nlatter\u2014one judges truly if one separates Plato and foolishness\nin thought, that is, judges that Plato is not foolish. But now\nAristotle goes on to tell us that there are incomposites that\nare not combined with anything. How can one make true or false\njudgements pertaining to such\n things?[10]\n\nAristotle introduces in response a further, different notion of truth\nand judgement. Judgements pertaining to incomposites are\n\u201ctouchings\u201d of or put us into \u201ccontact\u201d with\nthese things, a notion that Brentano renders as\n\u201cperception\u201d:\n\n\nIn fact, as truth is not the same in these cases, so also being is not\nthe same; but truth or falsity is as follows\u2014contact and\nassertion are truth (assertion not being affirmation), and ignorance\nis non-contact. (Metaphysics,\n 1051b21\u201325)[11]\n\n\nIn Brentano\u2019s eyes, Aristotle\u2019s \u201credefinition\u201d\nof judgement and truth is highly suggestive. It shows that the\nstrategy to explain judgement and truth in terms of combining and\nseparating runs into a problem. Aristotle\u2019s appeal to the idea\nof touching an object suggests a non-propositional form of\njudgement\u2014good from Brentano\u2019s perspective\u2014while the\npostulation of two different kinds of judgement, propositional as well\nas non-propositional, results in a non-uniform account of\njudgement\u2014bad from Brentano\u2019s perspective. We want a\nuniform account of judgement. But such an account may not be\navailable, as Brentano later came to see. In his theory of double\njudgement he accepts, like Aristotle did, the pattern of recognition\nof non-predicative judgement combined with postulating other kinds of\njudgement (see\n section 5).\n\nBrentano refers also with approval to the third chapter of De\nInterpretatione. There Aristotle says about the copula \u201cto\nbe\u201d or \u201cto be not\u201d that \u201cby itself it is\nnothing, but it additionally signifies some combination, which cannot\nbe thought of without the components.\u201d Brentano renders this\nas\n\n\nthe \u201cbeing\u201d of the copula does not in itself signify\nanything, as a name does, but simply completes the expression of a\njudgement.\n\n\nAs a correct reading of Aristotle this is dubious. Aristotle has the\ncopula signifying some combination. It is not merely\n\u201ccompleting\u201d the expression of a judgement, that is,\n\u201cto be\u201d is not only a syncategorematic expression. But we\ncan use Brentano\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle to shed further\nlight on his own positive view. He wants to say that the meaning of\n\u201cis\u201d is the same in the following sentences:\n\n(a)\nGod is almighty.\n(b)\nGod is.\n\n\nIn both sentences \u201cis\u201d has meaning or reference of its\nown. Hence, one cannot understand the judgement expressed by (b) as a\npredication of a property: \u201cis\u201d does not name the property\nof being.\n\nWhat does \u201cis\u201d then do in \u201cGod is\u201d? In his\nanswer of this question Brentano took inspiration from St. Thomas and\nKant:\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, St. Thomas came as close as Kant to the truth,\nremarkably enough by reflecting upon the same proposition, \u201cGod\nexists\u201d. According to him, the \u201cis\u201d is not a real\npredicate but merely a sign of affirmation (Summa Theologica,\nP. I, Q. 3, A. 4 ad 2). (PES 211 fn, [II 53 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn\n244])\n\n\nWhat is telling here is Brentano\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cmerely\u201d. It implies that one can use a sign for\naffirmation without using that very same sign also as a sign for\npredication. Following Brentano\u2019s own suggestion, we can make\nthis clear by introducing a simple formalism. Let us use the sign\n\u201c+\u201d as a sign for a mere affirmation (like a question mark\nis a mere sign for asking a question), and let us use\n\u201c+is\u201d as a sign that expresses both a judgement and a\npredication. Then we can symbolize the two judgements above as\nfollows:\n\n(a)\nGod (+is) almighty\n(b)\nGod\n (+)[12]\n\n\nThat is the inspiration that Brentano gets from St. Thomas. But,\nagain, there is something in St. Thomas that Brentano finds\n objectionable.[13]\n As Brentano notes, Aquinas wants to uphold Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof truth which requires that every judgement is a comparison between a\nrepresentation and its object. He does not admit that existential\njudgements simply do not fit this description.\n\nIt is important to note that \u201c+\u201d is a sign of affirmation\nand not a predicate. For example, Sundholm (2009: 274) argues that\nBrentano simply \u201crediscovered\u201d an idea of Bolzano.\nAccording to Sundholm, Bolzano takes \u201cA exists\u201d to express\nthe propositions that the idea [A] has an object; \u201cA does not\nexist\u201d expresses the negation of this property. The appearance\nthat Brentano recycles this view is dispelled when we notice that\n\u201c+\u201d does not express a presentation, but only determines\nin which mode a content is to be thought.\n\nLet us now turn to Kant. Brentano disagrees with Kant\u2019s\nepistemology on almost every single point. With respect to the nature\nof judgement, Brentano points out that Kant overlooks their essential\ncharacter by putting them together with presentations into a single\ncategory: acts of thinking. He also takes Kant to task for holding on\nto the mistaken view that a judgement always unifies several\nrepresentations (Critique of Pure Reason, A\n68\u20139/B93\u20134). Thus it may come as a surprise that there is\nalso a strong agreement between their views. Kant anticipates\nBrentano\u2019s claim that a \u201csingle mark [einzelnes Merkmal]\nwhich is the object of a presentation can be acknowledged or denied,\ntoo\u201d (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 230]; translation changed). The\ninsight can be found in Kant\u2019s seminal discussion of\nexistence:\n\n\nBeing is obviously not a real predicate, i.e., a concept of something\nthat could add to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing of\na thing or of certain determinations in themselves. (Critique of\nPure Reason, A 598)\n\n\nKant\u2019s slogan \u201cbeing is not a real predicate\u201d has\nbeen interpreted as saying that \u201cexists\u201d is no first-order\npredicate of objects, but a second-order predicate true of concepts.\nWhether this is the correct interpretation is not important for our\npurposes. Primed by Aquinas\u2019s remarks on \u201cto be\u201d,\nBrentano reads Kant\u2019s remark\n differently.[14]\n When I judge that God exists, I posit an omniscient being, but I do\nnot add something to the concept of an omniscient being. Instead of\nsaying \u201cexists\u201d is not a real predicate, Kant should have\nsaid that it is not a predicate at all, but a force-indicator: it has\npositing force.\n\nFrom Brentano\u2019s point of view, Kant commits the same mistake as\nSt. Thomas. He too tries to make existential judgements agree with the\ntraditional view that every judgement is a combination of\nrepresentations. To fit into Kant\u2019s category of synthetic\njudgement, the existential judgement that God exists must add\nsomething to the concept of God. \u201cThis is,\u201d remarks\nBrentano, \u201can unclear and contradictory semi-truth\u201d (PES\n211 [II 54; SVS 1, 234]; translation improved).\n\nKant may be forgiven his oversight, if one realizes how many logicians\nfollowed his path and found it equally incomprehensible to reach the\nposition that Brentano advocates. A telling example of such\nincomprehension is provided by John Stuart Mill in his letter to\nBrentano:\n\n\n1. I agree with you that Belief is the essential constituent in a\nDifferentia of judgment, and that the putting together of two ideas is\nmerely a prerequisite or antecedent condition.\n\n2. I cannot, however, think that one idea is a sufficient prerequisite\nfor a judgment. I cannot see how there can be Belief without both a\nsubject and a predicate. If you say that the idea of an elephant\nsuffices for belief in an elephant, belief in an elephant can only\nmean belief that there is such a thing as an elephant\u2014that an\nelephant exists: or, in other words, that under some circumstances,\nand in some place known or unknown, I should perceive by my senses a\nthing answering the definition of an elephant. Now this, which is the\ntruth really believed, is a fact, in two terms, not in one\n only.[15]\n (Mill 1872 [1972: 1928\u20139])\n\n\nThe one philosopher that came closest to Brentano\u2019s view on\njudgement was Johann Friedrich\n Herbart.[16]\n Herbart does not try to assimilate existential and so-called\n\u201csubjectless\u201d statements (\u201cIt rains\u201d) to\ncategorical one\u2019s of the form \u201cS is\n P\u201d.[17]\n And he takes \u201cis\u201d in \u201cGod is\u201d to be the sign\nof \u201cabsolute positing\u201d (unbedingte Aufstellung)\n(Herbart 1813: 49). While Brentano praises Herbart for holding this\nview, he does not pick up his terminology, expecting little insight\nfrom the associations it encourages.\n\nThese comparisons are not only historically instructive. They give us\na good sense of how radical Brentano\u2019s position really is. It is\nradical in its demand that a theory of judgement must accommodate and\nnot explain away existential judgements. And it is even more radical\nin its refusal to make existential judgements satisfy any version of\nthe view of judging as a combinatory or synthetic act, which would\nnicely fit with the correspondence theory of truth. In refusing to\ntake this step that most philosophers considered to be inevitable,\nBrentano put a heavy burden on a theory of judgement that tries to\ngive a uniform account of existential and subjectless judgements as\nwell as categorical judgements. Brentano thought that he can pull off\nthis trick by turning the traditional approach to this problem inside\nout: instead of trying to show that in fact all judgements are\ncategorical ones, he tries to show that all judgements are\nexistential. If all judgements are reducible to existential ones, no\njudgement applies a property or concept to an object. That may sound\nludicrous, but it is the only alternative left, unless one is willing\nto sacrifice the goal of giving a uniform account of judgement as a\ndistinct mental category.\n3. Brentano\u2019s Argument from Perception\n\nWe have now introduced the idea that animates Brentano\u2019s theory\nof judgement: predication is one thing, judgement another. We have\nseen which views inspired Brentano to disentangle judgement and\npredication. However, so far we lack a reason to follow\nBrentano\u2019s lead. How can he convince his readers that\npredication is not necessary for judgement, since we already judge\nwhen we merely acknowledge or reject an object?\n\nSometimes Brentano simply trusts his readers to agree with him if they\npay sufficient attention to their own judgements and compare them\nwith, for example, presentations. Consider, for instance, the\nfollowing passage from the opening section of Brentano\u2019s\ndiscussion of judgement in PES:\n\n\nIt is [\u2026] true that nothing is an object of judgement which is\nnot an object of presentation, and we maintain that when the object of\npresentation becomes the object of an affirmative or negative\njudgement, our consciousness enters into a completely new kind of\nrelationship with the object. [\u2026] This, we maintain, is\nrevealed clearly to us by inner perception and the attentive\nobservation of the phenomena of judgement in memory. (PES 201 [II\n38\u20139; SVS 1, 223, emphasis added)\n\n\nSo, if we are able to episodically remember judging something, we can\ncome to know that the same object given in a presentation can be\nacknowledged or rejected in judgement and that acknowledging and\nrejecting are distinct in kind from presentation.\n\nBut merely encouraging a philosopher who is in the grip of the idea\nthat judging is predication to pay more attention when recalling his\njudgements will not yield the intended results. Is there an argument\nthat will establish Brentano\u2019s view on the basis of\nuncontroversial premises? Brentano thinks there is an argument that is\nbased on premises his opponents find\n compelling:[18]\n\n\nThat predication is not the essence of every judgement emerges quite\nclearly from the fact that all perceptions are judgements. For it\n[perception] is either knowledge [Erkenntnis] or at least a\nmistaken taking to be true [F\u00fcrwahrnehmen]. And this is\nnot denied by those thinkers who hold that every judgement consists in\na conjunction of subject and predicate. [\u2026] [I]t is hard to\nthink of anything more obvious and unmistakable than the fact that a\nperception is not a [connection] of a concept of the subject and a\nconcept of a predicate, nor does it refer to such a connection.\nRather, the object of an inner perception is simply a mental\nphenomenon, and the object of an external perception is\nsimply a physical phenomenon, a sound, odor, or the like. We have\nhere, then, a quite obvious justification of the truth of our\nassertion. (PES 209 [II 50\u201351; SVS 1, 232], translation\nchanged.)\n\n\nEveryone\u2014even predication theorists of\njudgement\u2014believe that in perceiving we don\u2019t connect the\nconcept of a subject with that of a predicate. No\none\u2014even predication theorists of judgement\u2014denies\nthat every perception is a judgement. So, everyone accepts that there\nare some judgements that don\u2019t predicate a property of something\n(connect a concept of a subject with a concept of a predicate). A\nfortiori the predication theorist of judgement is rationally\ncompelled to accept that there are non-predicational judgements. If he\ndoes not do so, his view of judgement is not in harmony with the right\nview of perception. Hence, the view of judgement as predication must\nbe revised.\n\nHow obvious is Brentano\u2019s \u201cquite obvious\u201d\njustification? Let\u2019s consider Brentano\u2019s first premise\nfirst: perception does not involve predication. A charitable reading\nof Brentano should assume that by \u201cperception\u201d he means\nwhat philosophers following Fred Dretske now call \u201cnon-epistemic\nperception\u201d. I can see something without having any\nbeliefs about it to the effect that it is so-and-so. I see the yellow\ncanary because it looks distinct from its immediate environment; I\ncan\u2019t see the chameleon because it does not look distinct from\nits environment. Note that it does not matter at this point whether\none takes ordinary material objects such as birds or, as Brentano\nhimself prefers, physical phenomena such as colours and shapes to be\nthe (primary) objects of perception.\n\nIs non-epistemic seeing a form of predication? Prima facie,\nit isn\u2019t. When I see the yellow canary, I am directed towards an\nobject and it appears distinct from its environment. The canary is\ngiven to me in such a way that I can attend to it in perception, but I\nmight abstain from making any predicative judgement about it for the\ntime being.\n\nBrentano takes it to be beyond doubt that such a perception is a\njudgement, only not a predicative one. This is controversial. For\nexample, Brentano\u2019s modus ponens is Moritz\nSchlick\u2019s (1925, 80/1974, 87) modus tollens: perception\nis not judgement, hence, a perception cannot be knowledge. So\nwhy should one think of seeing a yellow canary or hearing a\nsound as a judgement in the first place? Consider again your\nperception of the yellow canary. The canary looks different from its\nsurroundings to you and you can train your attention on it. In this\nsituation you will, to use a non-committal phrase, \u201ctake the\ncanary to be real\u201d. Seeing the canary is a particular kind of\n\u201ctaking the canary to be\u201d, namely as something real; in\nBrentano\u2019s terminology that is \u201can acknowledging of the\ncanary\u201d. If this is right, there are judgements that do not\npredicate any properties of an object and merely acknowledge it.\n\nLet us consider three objections to firm up our understanding of\nBrentano\u2019s line of thought.\n\nObjection 1: But one cannot \u201ctake something to be real\u201d,\nyet not predicate any property of it. Taking something to be real is\njust predicating existence of it. Brentano considers this objection\n himself:[19]\n\n\nBecause we say not only that we perceive a color, a sound, an act of\nseeing, an act of hearing, but also that we perceive the existence of\nan act of seeing or of an act of hearing, someone might be led to\nbelieve that perception, too, consists in the acknowledgement\n[Anerkennung] of the conjunction of the attribute\n\u201cexistence\u201d with the phenomenon in question. Such a\nmisunderstanding of obvious facts seems to me almost inconceivable.\n(PES 210 [II 51\u201352; SVS 1, 232])\n\n\nAs said before, Brentano\u2019s claim that the facts are obvious\nbears little argumentative weight. But the view that every\n(non-epistemic) perception is a judgement to the effect that something\nexists over-intellectualizes non-epistemic perception. Infants and\ndogs see and hear things. Does Brentano\u2019s opponent really want\nto say that they make judgements to the effect that the objects\nperceived exist? Yet, a dog certainly takes the canary to be real when\nit chases it.\n\nBrentano also provides a more theoretical reason against the view that\n(non-epistemic) perception consists in predications of existence (PES\n210 [II 51\u201352; SVS 1, 232]). The view makes it difficult to\nexplain how we manage to acquire the concept of existence. If we\nexercise the concept in every (non-epistemic) perception, the concept\nof existence must come with the capacity to perceive objects and\nqualities. Brentano finds this unbelievable.\n\nIn turn, if acknowledging an object does not presuppose possession of\nthe concept of existence, our introspective knowledge of\nacknowledgement may be used to introduce the concept of existence.\nBrentano pursued this strategy following Aristotle:\n\n\nAristotle had already recognized that [the concept of existence] is\nacquired by reflection on the acknowledging judgement. (TE 27 [45],\ntranslation\n improved)[20]\n\n\nObjection 2: Seeing the yellow canary is not the same thing as\nacknowledging it. For instance, one can see an object without\nacknowledging it \u201cif one does not trust one\u2019s eyes.\u201d\nI see the canary before me, but since you have given me misleading\nevidence that I am now hallucinating, I do not trust my senses and do\nnot take the canary to be real. So, seeing and judging are\nrelated\u2014maybe (consciously) seeing something prompts one to\njudge that it is\u2014but these mental acts are distinct.\n\nIn later work Brentano suggested that in such cases we do acknowledge\nthe bird as well as judge that there is no object in the scene\nperceived. Just as we can love and hate an object, we can accept and\nreject an object at the same time:\n\n\nAn affect that is reined in by a contradicting higher love still truly\npersists. Similarly, an acceptance of an object given in sensation,\nwhich is disapproved of by a higher judgement, could persist. Indeed,\nit is not at all clear, how the lower activity should be changed in\nits intrinsic character because of the occurrence of the higher\nactivity; if the lower activity had a relation of acceptance to the\nouter object before, it will have it later. (VNV 26, author\ntranslation.)\n\n\nIt is thus possible to acknowledge and reject an object at the same\ntime, although this is clearly not a mental state one prefers to be\nin. But sometimes things are not as we like them to be.\n\nWith this in mind Brentano can say that when we mistrust our senses we\nacknowledge an object, but this judgement conflicts with other\njudgements or beliefs that we have with regard to this matter.\n\nObjection 3: We have already seen that Brentano subscribes to a\nPolarity Thesis: Acknowledging an object x has an opposite:\nrejecting x (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n These attitudes are directed towards the same object, yet only one of\nthem can be correct even if they may co-exist, as Brentano allows. The\ncorrectness of acknowledging x is incompatible with the\ncorrectness of rejecting it. Hence, if non-epistemic perception is a\nkind of acknowledgement, it must have an opposite. But what could be\nthe opposite of\n seeing?[21]\n According to Peter Geach, there is nothing here to be found except\nthe exclusion relation between (instances of) properties that we\nsee:\n\n\nBelieving, like seeing, has no polar opposite, though contrary dogmas\nmay be believed, as contrary colours may be seen. (Geach 1965:\n455)\n\n\nHowever, Brentano\u2019s view of perception could gain plausibility\nby contrasting it with a form of doubt that is also non-epistemic and\ndirectly opposed to it. If I see a yellow canary, that very act could\nmake it incorrect to raise a doubt of a non-epistemic kind. If\ndoubting can be like acknowledging an object-directed act with a\nnon-propositional content, then Brentano\u2019s Polarity thesis\nstands. If not, we must either revise the Polarity Thesis or\nBrentano\u2019s view of perception.\n\nLet us sum up the discussion and put its result into perspective.\nBrentano tells us that perceiving an object is acknowledging it. Such\nperceptions are for Brentano the prime example of existential\njudgements. In such judgements we acknowledge an object without\npredicating anything of it. Based on this observation, Brentano argues\nthat simple existential judgements are not of the categorical form\n\u201cS is P\u201d or \u201cS has the\nproperty P\u201d. In other words, simple judgements do not\nhave a propositional content. In making such judgements we may\nacknowledge a content, a combination of marks or a single mark and\nthereby an object that possesses these marks, but we do not affirm\nthat the object that is so-and-so exists.\n\nThe consequences of this move are indeed far reaching. Even when we\npredicate a property of an object, Brentano can say that the\npredication need not change the character of the judgement\nthat we are making. One may conceive of predication as a two-step\nprocess: one first connects the property P with the subject\nS, thus forming a complex representation of an\nS-that-is-P; then one acknowledges the complex\ncontent and thus forms a judgement. The content is complex, but the\njudgement itself is the same simple act of acknowledgement.\n\nIf judging is either acknowledging or rejecting of contents, the\nnotion of acknowledgement/rejection is fundamental in philosophy of\nmind. In response to Brentano\u2019s move, philosophers at the end of\nthe 19th and beginning of 20th century engaged with his view of\nacknowledgement. Wilhelm Jerusalem (1895, 67\u201372) discussed\nBrentano\u2019s and Marty\u2019s view of judgement and argues for a\nview of judgement as a complex \n activity.[22] \nAdolf Reinach (1911, sect. I) distinguished different related notions of\n\u2018acknowledgement\u2019 and criticises Brentano for running them\ntogether. Karelitzki (1914) is a (short) monograph devoted to find a\nplausible concept of acknowledgement and takes Brentano\u2019s as its\nstarting point (see ibid., 13\u201328). The central figure of the\nVienna circle, Moritz Schlick (1925, 50/1974, 43) took Brentano to be\nright about the psychological nature of judgement, but not its logical\nrole. For this reason he argues against the reduction thesis that we\nwill examine below.\n4. The Reduction Thesis and Brentano\u2019s Logic Reform\n\nSo far Brentano\u2019s theory seems to have a sound footing. Now we\nneed to make a big step when we consider Brentano\u2019s most radical\nthesis: what we called his reduction thesis (see\n section 1, claim 6):\n \u201cThe reducibility of categorical propositions, indeed the\nreducibility of all propositions which express a judgement, to\nexistential propositions is therefore indubitable\u201d (PES 218 [II\n60; SVS 1, 239). Before we can ask on what basis Brentano makes this\nclaim, we need to get clear about its meaning.\n\nBrentano introduces the notion of \u201creduction\u201d at a\nlinguistic level, applying it to sentences (or\n\u201cpropositions\u201d), but what he is aiming at is a reduction\nat the level of mental phenomena. At the linguistic level, the claim\nis that any categorical proposition can be transformed without change\nof meaning into an existential proposition. At the level of judgement,\nthe claim is that all judgements are in fact existential in character\n(and hence non-propositional). That shows for Brentano how language\ndisguises the true nature of our judgements. When somebody asserts,\nfor instance, that all S are P, he seems to\nmake a positive judgement about all S. In fact, however, his\njudgement is negative and of the form \u201cNo\nS-that-is-not-P exists\u201d. The point of the\nreduction thesis is to remove the linguistic disguise and to uncover\nthe true form of our judgements. It also ensures that the judgements\nexpressed by categorical and existential propositions are of the same\nkind. While such unification could also be achieved by saying that\nexistential propositions express categorical judgement,\nBrentano\u2019s thesis reverses that claim by declaring categorical\npropositions to express existential judgements.\n\nThat is the view that Brentano puts forth in the first edition of his\nPsychology (1874). However, Brentano had second thoughts on\nthis matter. While holding on to his view that existential\npropositions express categorical judgements, and that categorical\npropositions can express existential judgements, Brentano\nlater dropped the reduction thesis. At least since 1889, Brentano no\nlonger thought that categorical propositions only express\nexistential judgements. He states the result of this change of view in\nprint first in Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis:\n\n\nThe judgement expressed in the sentence \u201cThe rose is a\nflower\u201d is composed out of two judgements of which one is the\nacknowledgement of the subject [\u2026] (OKRW fn. 22 [SVS 3,\n67f.])\n\n\nIt turns out that I make two judgements in one\u2014a \u201cdouble\njudgement\u201d\u2014when I seem to make only one: the judgement\nthat the rose is a flower. Furthermore, higher-order judgements about\nthe correctness and incorrectness of judgements exhibit the same\ncomplexity and come to play a prominent role in Brentano\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nThese new ideas complicate Brentano\u2019s theory and force one to\nrethink the entire project of reducing categorical propositions to\nexistential ones. We will do this in two steps. In this section, we\ntake a closer look at the reduction thesis in the context in which it\noriginally appears. In\n section 5\n we explain why Brentano gave up this project.\n\nWe already noted that Brentano\u2019s Psychology is not just\na book about mental phenomena. It also includes fundamental\nconsiderations pertaining to logic and epistemology. In that sense\nBrentano is no doubt a \u201cpsychologist\u201d. He takes judgements\nto be the primary bearers of truth, he defines logical inferences as\nrelations between judgements, and he considers validity to emerge from\nthe evidence of our judgements about such relations. In taking this\napproach, Brentano sets himself apart from the rising\n\u201cmathematical logic\u201d (see PES Appendix x). Instead of\napplying mathematical tools in logic, Brentano believed that logic\nwill advance better by applying the tools of descriptive psychology.\nTo prove his case, Brentano sketches a reform of traditional logic\nbased on his reduction thesis.\n\nTo begin with, Brentano challenges the logic contained in the\ntraditional square of opposition. This square is made up of the four\ncategorial propositions:\n\nA (\u201cAll S are P\u201d),\nE (\u201cNo S are P\u201d),\nI (\u201cSome S are P\u201d), and\nO (\u201cSome S are not P\u201d).\n\n\nAmong others, the following logical relations have been claimed to\nhold among these propositions (see Parsons 2017):\n\nA contradicts O, and vice versa.\nE contradicts I, and vice versa.\nA and E can be false but not true together (= law of\ncontrariety)\nI and O can be true but not false together (= law of\nsubcontrariety)\nA implies I (= subalternation)\nE implies O (= subalternation)\nI converts into \u201cSome P are S\u201d\n(simple conversion)\nE converts into \u201cNo P is S\u201d (simple\nconversion)\n\n\nBrentano rejects almost all these principles. After translating the\ncategorical propositions into existential form, he concludes that (i)\nand (ii) are the only rules correctly identified by traditional logic.\n(iii) to (vi) turn out to be mistaken if S is an empty term.\n(vii) and (viii) are correct principles, but no real conversion of a\njudgement takes place. The converted propositions simply express\none judgement in two ways. This is why Brentano says that his\ntheory\n\n\nleads to nothing less than a complete overthrow, and at the same time,\na reconstruction of elementary logic. Everything then becomes simpler,\nclearer, and more exact. (PES 230 [II 77; SVS 1, 251])\n\n\nThe core idea from which Brentano starts is very simple: traditional\nlogic takes the A-form and the I-form to express positive judgements,\nand the E-form and the O-form to express negative ones. According to\nBrentano, that is a confusion. All universal propositions (both A and\nE) express negative judgements and therefore lack existential import,\nwhereas all particular propositions (both I and O) express positive\njudgements with existential import. The reduction thesis fits in\nnicely with this idea, or so it seems. It helps us to correctly\ninterpret the principles of traditional logic and to see which of them\none should retain. In turn, the simplification of the square of\nopposition lends support to the reduction thesis. Everything seems to\nfit\n nicely.[23]\n\nBut a closer look reveals that this tight fit between Brentano\u2019s\ntheory of judgement and his reform of logic is illusory. With the\nadvance of quantificational logic, it became clear that in order to\ncorrect the square of oppositions in the way in which Brentano\nsuggests, all one needs to do is to use existentially quantified\nformulas instead of categorical propositions (see Church 1947: 56).\nThis observation contains both good and bad news for Brentano. The\ngood news is that Brentano\u2019s logical intuitions find support in\nquantificational logic. The bad news is that his reduction thesis\nceases to play a role in reforming logic. Surely, a quantified formula\nmay express an existential judgement with a non-propositional\ncontent, as Brentano conceived it, but it may also express a judgement\nwith a propositional content. To put it in other words:\nBrentano\u2019s revision of traditional logic can be replicated\nwithout making use of his reduction thesis.\n5. The Theory of Double Judgements\n\nWhen one reads the first edition of Brentano\u2019s\nPsychology, the reduction thesis appears to be the backbone\nof Brentano\u2019s theory of judgement. But that is in fact not so.\nIn the second edition (1911) Brentano added several appendices, one of\nwhich is entitled \u201cOn genuine and fictitious objects\u201d (PES\nappendix ix). Here Brentano recapitulates his theory of judgement and\nturns his back on the reduction thesis. Neither is it true, Brentano\nnow says, that all categorical propositions can be transformed without\nchange of meaning into existential propositions. Nor is it true that\nall judgements are of existential form.\n\nIt takes a careful reading to fully appreciate the significance of\nBrentano\u2019s change of mind. While the change is dramatic, it does\nnot undermine Brentano\u2019s theory completely. On the contrary. All\nof the following claims still remain in place: in perception we make\nsimple existential judgements by affirming or rejecting an object that\nwe perceive (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1,\n 413]);[24]\n categorical propositions can be equivalent with existential\npropositions (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]; existential propositions\ncan express concepts with a complex subject matter (ibid.). While\nthese claims all remain unchanged, what Brentano gives up is the idea\nof uniformity in the realm of judgement. That is what Brentano\u2019s\nanti-reduction turn comes to:\n\nAnti-reduction\nIt is false that all judgements can be given a uniform\npsychological treatment.\n\n\nWhy did Brentano turn away from a unified theory of judgement?\nConsider first a line of reasoning that Brentano may have used in one\nof his\n lectures:[25]\n\n\n[\u2026] since Aristotle, the categorical form has been considered\nas the basic form of judgement, while the other doctrine that the\nbasic form of judgement is the existential form emerged only in recent\ntimes. Yet there can be no doubt that the absolute majority of our\njudgements take the form \u201cA is B\u201d, not the existential\nform, and that the Aristotelian logic made the right decision to\nground its logical developments on that form [of judgement]. This\napparent contradiction we must try to resolve. (LRU 113f., author\ntranslation)\n\n\nWhether it was Hillebrand or Brentano who made the point, it is a very\ngood question: Why should one bother to reduce categorical to\nexistential judgements, if most of our judgements are expressed in\ncategorical form? That is to say: Why not take such propositions at\nface value instead of claiming that language disguises the nature of\nour judgements?\n\nHowever, there is also a good answer to this question. We usually do\nnot make simple judgements, but what Brentano now calls \u201cdouble\njudgements\u201d, and in order to express such judgements we make use\nof the categorical form. In a double-judgement one affirms the\nexistence of some object and then adds a second judgement that\npresupposes that the first judgement has been made.\n\nThe novel idea here is that judgements become more complex when they\nare built up in three steps: First one presents an object\nS and acknowledges its existence. Then one presents a\nproperty P and identifies P with the object\nS in thought that one has acknowledged, and finally one\nacknowledges S with the addition of [mit der Zugabe]\nP. (see PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413]\n\nWhat is it to identify P with S in thought? Brentano\ntells us that identification is not a kind of judgement and that the\nresult of an identification is a presentation (PES 317, [II\n 206]).[26]\n A natural way to understand Brentano is to think of identification as\na way of forming complex presentations. Brentano seems mainly to have\nconjunction in mind. We can conjoin the presentation of [warm] and\n[round] to the presentation of [something warm & round].\nConjunction is here a primitive operation on presentations that is\nindependent of\n judgement.[27]\n\nBut what is the point of this complication? Why does Brentano not\nstick with the simpler two-step procedure that we are already familiar\nwith: first, one combines S and P in an act of\npresentation, prior to making any judgement, and then one acknowledges\n\u201cS-that-is-P\u201d as a complex object? Is\nthere a special way of identifying S and P which\npresupposes that the object S has to be acknowledged before\nsuch an identification can be\n made?[28]\n\nDemonstrative judgements are a good case to support Brentano\u2019s\nnew idea:\n\n\nA sentence of the form \u201cThat thing is P\u201d\nexpresses a double judgement consisting of (i) an acknowledgement of\nthe object picked out by the demonstrative \u201cthat thing\u201d\nand (ii) the conjoining of the idea [That] and [P] (read as\n\u201cthe thing which is that and P\u201d and (iii) an\nacknowledgement of the thing which is that and P.\n\n\nThe formulation of the second judgement must be chosen with care. One\nwould miss Brentano\u2019s point, if one took the second judgement to\nhave as content \u201cthat the thing just acknowledged is\nP\u201d. Acknowledging an object and judging that one\nacknowledges it are not the same thing. Therefore, one could make the\nlatter judgement without actually making the first affirmation. That\nis ruled out if one describes the second judgement as affirming of\nthat thing that has been acknowledged, that it is P.\nOnly thus one capture\u2019s Brentano idea that in a double-judgement\nthe second judgement is inseparable from the first: one can affirm\nsomething of an object only after one has actually affirmed its\nexistence (see PES 296 [II 165; SVS 1,\n 414]).[29]\n\nAnother possible misunderstanding is worth mentioning at this point.\nWe have earlier seen that Brentano, like Frege, distinguishes\npredication from judgement. Now it may seem that Brentano backtracks\non this agreement. On his new theory it seems that predication occurs\nwhen one affirms P of S, which means when one judges\nof S that it is P. But Brentano does not backtrack\non this point. He still holds that predication occurs prior to and\nindependently of judging. That is what the three-step process in a\ndouble-judgement guarantees: after acknowledging S, one must\nfirst identify P with S, i.e., predicate P\nof S, before one can judge that S is P,\ni.e., acknowledge S in conjunction with P.\n\nLet us now turn to a second line of reasoning with which Brentano\nmotivates his new theory. This line involves a thorough\nreconsideration of the categorical propositions of traditional logic.\nFollowing the model of singular propositions just elaborated, Brentano\nsuggests that propositions of the I-form and the O-form also express\ndouble-judgements:\n\n\nLooked at more closely [\u2026a judgement of the form \u201cSome\nS is P\u201d] signifies a double judgement\n(Doppelurteil), one part of which acknowledges the\nsubject, and, after the predicate has been identified in presentation\nwith the subject, the other part acknowledges the subject which had\nbeen acknowledged all by itself by the first part, but with this\naddition\u2014which is to say it ascribes to it the predicate\nP. (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413], translation amended)\n\n\nLikewise, the O-form \u201cSome S is not\nP\u201d:\n\n\nconsists of the acknowledgement of S, and this is the basic\nconstituent of the double judgements. The second part relates to it\nand presupposes it in such a way as to be inseparable from it. And\nthis second part is negative: it does not [\u2026] ascribe an\nattribute to the S, [\u2026] but rather denies one of it.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nWhat is the rationale behind these claims? It is obviously no\ncoincidence that Brentano makes them in the context of discussing the\ndistinction between genuine and fictitious objects. This distinction\nbecomes important for him because judgements are intentional mental\nacts, and as such they can be both about real things or about\ninventions of our own minds. These invented or\n\u201cfictitious\u201d objects can be of various kinds. We may\ninvent something in hallucination or by imagining it in our dreams,\nlike a magical island, or we may read about a mythological figure\ndescribed in a story, like Pegasus, or we may invent non-existing\nobjects by our way of speaking or as part of a metaphysical\ntheory.\n\nIn the present context, Brentano is concerned particularly with\nfictitious objects invented by language or metaphysics: he calls them\n\u201cnegatives\u201d, since they are denoted by negative terms\nwhich may occur either in the subject-position or the\npredicate-position of a categorical proposition. Such terms are\nregularly used in common language when one speaks of an\n\u201cunintelligent man\u201d, or an \u201cunattractive\nthing\u201d (PES 298 [II 169; SVS 1,\n 417].[30]\n Or they may be introduced by artificial terms like \u201ca non-white\nthing\u201d or a \u201cnon-human\u201d. Brentano denies that such\nterms actually have a denotative function and denote something that\ncould be made an object of judgement. The following consideration may\nbe taken as supporting Brentano\u2019s point: When we count the\nproperties of an object, only genuine properties should count. The\nproperties of a flower may include being red and being a rose; but in\naddition to that the rose does not also have the further properties of\nbeing not-black and being not a daisy. It is of course correct to\nsay that the flower is neither black nor a daisy, but in\nsaying this one does not ascribe negative properties to it. One simply\ndenies that it has the properties of being black and being a daisy.\nThat is why Brentano insists that negation belongs to the mode of\njudgement, not to its content (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n\nBrentano requires from a theory of judgement that it stays away from\npostulating fictitious entities of any kind. In this respect his\nearlier analysis of propositions of the O-form and the A-form turns\nout to be deficient. His claim about the O-form was that in judging\nthat S is not P, one affirms the existence of an\nS-that-is-not-P. That conflicts with his restriction\nagainst negative properties because when one affirms a complex like\nS-that-is-not-P, one affirms all of its parts (see\nPES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]). Thus, in affirming an\nS-that-is-not-P, one would affirm not only the\nentire complex, but also both of its \u201cparts\u201d: S\nand not-P. Note that the problem cannot be solved by joining\nthe negation with the copula \u201cis\u201d, because the copula\nindicates the quality of the judgement and propositions of the O-form\nexpress positive judgements according to Brentano.\n\nThe way out of this problem is provided by Brentano\u2019s theory of\ndouble-judgement. On the new analysis, judgements of the O-form are\npartially positive and partially negative. They affirm the existence\nof the subject S, and then deny the predicate P of\nthat subject. Now the negation belongs to the mode of judgement, not\nto its subject matter.\n\nBrentano considers this new analysis to provide a further insight into\nthe way how language disguises the nature of\n judgement.[31]\n Obviously, we cannot read off from the linguistic expression whether\na given proposition expresses a simple or a double-judgement. It takes\nthe scalpel of a philosopher to figure this out. In some cases,\nhowever, no decision may be reached. Then Brentano advises us to\nconsider the proposition to be homonymous. This seems to be the proper\nverdict with propositions of the I-form. They can be interpreted\neither as expressing a simple judgement (\u201can SP exists\u201d)\nor a double-judgement (\u201can S exists and that S\nis P\u201d) (see LRU 114, and Hillebrand 1891: 98).\n\nA further ambiguity of this kind arises in the case of propositions of\nthe E-form (\u201cNo S is P\u201d). Their explicit\nnegative quality speaks against an interpretation that takes them to\nexpress a double-judgement like propositions of the\n O-form.[32]\n Brentano therefore ventures another idea what these propositions\nexpress: judgements of higher-order or\n\u201cmeta-judgements\u201d:\n\n\nAnyone who says, \u201cNo S is P\u201d is thinking\nof someone judging that \u201cAn S is P\u201d, and\ndeclaring that in thinking of him in this way he is thinking of\nsomeone who judges incorrectly. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416])\n\n\nBrentano here exploits the principle that judgements of the E-form\ncontradict judgements of the I-form. Denying that someone judges\ncorrectly that S is P, therefore means to judge that\nno S is P. Likewise, Brentano exploits the principle\nthat A-judgements contradict O-judgements when he says that\npropositions of the A-form also express meta-judgements:\n\n\nIf the O-form means the double-judgement \u201cThere is an S\nand it is not P\u201d, then the proposition \u201cEvery\nS is P,\u201d says that anyone who makes both of\nthose judgements is judging falsely. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1,\n416])\n\n\nIn this way, Brentano again manages to satisfy the restriction on\nnegative properties. His earlier theory takes propositions of the\nA-form to express simple existential judgement. Brentano now considers\nthat to be a mistake because it introduces the complex\nS-that-is-not-P, which includes the negative part\n\u201cnot-P\u201d. Again, the \u201cnot\u201d here cannot be taken\nas an indicator of the quality of the judgement, since one would then\ndeny the existence of an S-that-is P. With\npropositions of the E-form this problem does not arise. In this case,\ntwo interpretations are admissible, which makes \u201cNo S\nis P\u201d an ambiguous proposition: it either expresses the\nsimple negative existential judgement that no\nS-that-is-P exists, or the higher-order judgement\nthat someone who accepts an S-that-is-P judges\nincorrectly.\n\nIn sum, Brentano\u2019s theory of double-judgement shows why a\nreduction of all categorical propositions to existential judgements is\n impossible.[33]\n On the other hand, there is no way for Brentano of reducing\nexistential propositions to propositions expressing double-judgements.\nBrentano is therefore forced to abandon the project of giving a\nuniform treatment of all judgements within the constraints of his\n theory.[34]\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Brentano", "Further Historical Texts", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Brentano": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt</em>, 2 books, 1874.
