Why does institutional practice matter?\n\n\nWe have been discussing the question which aspect of institutional\npractice is relevant to legal rights and obligations. But how is it\nthat some or other aspect of institutional practice is so relevant?\nThe pure interpretivist case would be severely undercut if at that\nabstract level morality played no role in the explanation of\nrelevance.\n\n\nPure interpretivism offers a thoroughly moral explanation of the\nnormative relevance of institutional practice, by identifying a moral\nconcern that gives the practice in the abstract such relevance. It characteristically\nbegins at some familiar, structural features of legal practice, whose\nexistence is usually tacitly assumed. The first concerns the\ninstitutional character of law.  It\u2019s an unspoken fundamental\nassumption in law that claims of legal right or obligation are claims\ngrounded, in some appropriate way, in past institutional decisions and\nstanding practices of government\u2014in actual not ideal\ninstitutional arrangements\u2014and that only claims so grounded\nshall be recognized and enforced. Call that kind of grounding\nthe legality of a claim. The second concerns the\nrole that the legality of a claim is supposed to play in relation to\nsome moral concern. It is not merely uncharacteristic but also\nimpermissible for legal institutions to enforce some claim against a\nperson, unless the claim meets the conditions of legality by being\nappropriately grounded in institutional practice.\n\n\nThis is not the discredited claim that what it is for a legal\nobligation to take some action to exist is for some sanction to be\nattached to not taking the action, or that a coercive clause must of\nnecessity be attached to every law. Rather, it is the claim that\nputative rights and obligations may be enforced through the\ninstitutions of government only when and because they bear a certain relation to\nthe institutions\u2019 practice. This is a normative constraint that is not\ndependent on whether occasion for enforcement ever arises. It is\ncloser to Kelsen\u2019s view that legality is at bottom a boundary\nseparating permissible coercion exercised in the name of the community\nand impermissible coercion not so exercised (though of course for\nKelsen this would be a moral boundary that only need exist in the eyes\nof the law, whether or not it exists outright; see Kelsen 1952).\n\n\nA familiar hypothesis is that the moral concern in play is raised by\ninstitutions\u2019 effective power to use force or otherwise coercively to\ndirect citizens\u2019 action. Legality is supposed to constrain or regulate\nthat power, by constituting a necessary condition that demands against\npersons must meet if they are to be permissibly enforced. Notice that\nin this role, legality is not a moral filter, a moral constraint on the\nvalidity of norms. In the hypothesis in discussion, there is no pool\nof candidate norms, identified by nonmoral tests, to be put through a\nfurther, moral test, before they are pronounced finally valid. Rather,\nlegality is a condition of permissible enforcement of demands against\na person, a special moral test that applies to any such demand,\nincluding those that are entirely unfounded as well as those that may\npass other moral tests. (This is the moral concern, and corresponding\nrole of legality, developed in Dworkin 1986, see also Dworkin\n2011. Alternative interpretivist hypotheses might assign to legality a\nsimilarly distinctive role in relation to some other moral\nconcern.)\n\n\nOn this view, it is essential to law that the legality of a\ndemand\u2014its being grounded in institutional history in the right\nway\u2014is a condition of its permissible enforcement. This is a\nclaim that is at once metaphysical\u2014a claim about the nature of\nlaw\u2014and normative\u2014a claim about the morality of\ncoercion. It says that the correct explanation of why\ninstitutional history should have the role of constraint on coercive\nenforcement (a substantive normative explanation of a political ideal\nthat makes history morally relevant to the permissible enforcement of\nclaims) determines the correct explanation of how\ninstitutional history determines legal rights and obligations (the\nconstitutive explanation of what it is, more precisely, for a claim of\nright and obligation to be grounded in institutional history in the\nlegally appropriate way).\n\n\nThis general explanatory template can be filled out in a number of\nways. The best known (Dworkin 1986, also 2006, 2011) begins at the\nclaim that what explains the role of institutional history in the\nidentification and enforcement of rights and obligations is that government\u2019s\naction should be consistent in principle\u2014some version of the\nvirtue of treating what\u2019s morally like alike, perhaps ultimately to be\nexplained by some combination of reasons of fairness and government\u2019s\nspecial duty to treat citizens as equals.\n\n\nThis approach is based on the view that, emergencies aside, it is\nwrong for government to exercise its power to coerce if such an\nexercise is not allowed by law. Here, the law is meant to work as a\nconstraint on government\u2019s action, and its role as a constraint is\nclaimed to be grounded in reasons of political morality. (Recall that the constraint follows from moral\nfact, not the logic of institutional action.) If government is to\nstand behind my request coercively to enforce my demand against you,\nit must justify its action by appeal to its institutional\npractice. The explanation of the role of legality in the exercise of\ncoercive power is that government is under a standing obligation\nalways to act in line with an honest conception of justice. It cannot\nbegin to meet this obligation unless it takes what it has said and\ndone on pertinent issues as relevant to what it may do now. Justice is\negalitarian in character. The familiar requirement of treating morally\nlike alike would bind government to use force on a given occasion in\nthe way it has used or would use it in any other actual or\nhypothetical circumstances relevantly similar to the instant one.\n\n\nPrincipled consistency in the use of force does not mean, in this,\nnonhybrid conception, that government is bound punctiliously to apply\nall norms promulgated by authorities or to repeat past mistakes. The claim is rather that the\nmorality of coercive interaction makes institutional practice relevant\nto what may or must be done now. Government must take its other action\n(legislation, cases, etc.) seriously and act now in a way that\u2019s\nconsistent in principle with that action, taken together.  Any past\naction that cannot be justified under the scheme that justifies the\nrest is action that is not after all relevant to what is to be done\nnow, and is to be set aside as mistake. We must revise our\nunderstanding of principles on which we acted in the past, which may\nhave led us to such mistakes.\n\n\nSince government must make its action consistent in principle (rather\nthan formally), the conclusion we should derive from this normative\nexplanation, suitably elaborated, is that certain moral principles\nthat together justify institutional decisions and settled practice\ndetermine legal rights and obligations. These are moral rights and\nobligations that bear the right relation to institutional practice,\nwhich therefore government may enforce, and must do so on demand,\nthrough its institutions (Dworkin 1986, 2011).\n\n\nOn this view, the morality of coercion fundamentally explains the\nnormative relevance of actual institutions (Stavropoulos 2009). A\nrelated familiar hypothesis in political philosophy assigns to the\nmorality of coercion a fundamental role in the explanation of duties\nof socioeconomic justice. On this hypothesis, duties of justice\n(whether egalitarian, as many philosophers suppose, or not) obtain in\nvirtue of the political relation that holds among those who are placed\nunder the coercive control of some government, and are discharged by\ndesigning institutions in a way that meets certain constraints (Nagel\n2005). Whether or not coercion matters in that way is a topic much\ndiscussed in political philosophy, where writers are concerned with\nideal arrangements. The question is underexplored in relation to law,\nwhere we are concerned with the normative effect of actual\narrangements.\n\n\nAs indicated above, nonhybrid interpretivism is not committed as such\nto appeal to egalitarian concerns related to coercive\nenforcement. Alternative explanations that vindicate the assumed role\nof institutional practice in grounding obligations might be built on\nthe basis of considerations of fair notice (cf. the doctrine Dworkin\ncalls \u201cconventionalism\u201d, Dworkin 1986) or other principles of political morality, perhaps including considerations\nrelated to authority.\n\n\nA further question concerns boundaries. This is a matter of the first\nimportance for the orthodox view, which purports to organize\nobligations by institutional source, but seems less urgent for pure\ninterpretivism, on which no obligations are explained by institutional\ncontingencies alone.\n\n\nRecall that, on the current approach, some moral\nconcern makes institutional practice relevant to rights and\nobligations, and the rights and obligations in question have genuine\nmoral force. But it doesn\u2019t follow that just any action of government\nthat has moral consequences, or even action that changes rights and\nobligations, and any change in rights or obligations that obtains in\nconsequence of such action, is to be regarded as falling within the\nlegal domain. The interpretivist says that the justifying connection\nbetween institutional practice and legal rights and obligations must\nbe such as to serve as an adequate response to the moral concern that\nis characteristic of legal practice. On the hypothesis we have been\ndiscussing, the concern is raised by coercive enforcement. A\nconception of law must therefore articulate the relation that must\nhold between some right or obligation and institutional practice if\nthe right or obligation is to be permissibly enforced. (Recall that\nthat moral relation is, on this hypothesis, the relation of legality,\nand rights and duties are legal when and because they bear that\nrelation to institutional practice). The requirement of legality so\nunderstood plausibly imposes procedural and other constraints on the\nkind of institutional action or other aspect of institutional practice\nthat may ground legal rights and obligations. Officials often make\npublic announcements about their future behavior designed to shape the\nexpectations and thereby the action of their intended audience (as did\nthe President of the European Central Bank when he announced, at a\nmajor investment conference organized by the British government, that\nthe ECB will \u201cdo whatever it takes to preserve\u201d the\ncurrency, Draghi 2012). Normally when we give assurances designed to\nraise expectations, we thereby change what we owe to those that we\nassure, often coming to have a duty to perform. But there is no reason\nto expect that action of this kind, taken by officials outside normal\nprocedures, should in itself affect any legal right or\nduty. Equally, there is no reason to rule out its playing\nsome role in the determination of the impact of other, procedurally\nproper institutional action or other aspect of the practice.\n For similar substantive reasons, it does not follow from its\nconception of legal rights and duties as moral consequences of\ninstitutional action, that interpretivism cannot distinguish between\nenforceable rights and duties that obtain in consequence of the kind\nof institutional action whose role as shaper of such rights and duties\nserves the value of legality, on the appropriate conception, on the\none hand; and further moral consequences, downstream of these rights\nand duties, on the other. On the hypothesis in discussion, the\ndetermination relation between rights or duties and institutional practice\nallays the relevant moral concern if it makes for principled\nconsistency in the practice (in the way discussed in more detail in\nthis Section and Section 4). On this basis, we can distinguish between\nthe legal duty of Albert, who owns a small business, to purchase a\nnew, more costly health insurance program for his employees following\nthe enactment of some new health care legislation that specifies a\ncertain minimum coverage, and his further, derivative duty, owed to\nhis family, to reduce his personal spending to make ends meet given\nthe increase in his business expenditure. By hypothesis, Albert comes\nto have the legal duty to purchase the new, more costly program\nbecause, once the new legislation is factored into institutional\npractice, that is what principled consistency in the practice now\ndictates. On this basis, we can say that the duty obtains because of\nthe difference that the legislation properly made to the law. On the\nother hand, Albert comes to have some duty of financial prudence\nbecause of the effect of these developments on Albert\u2019s finances,\ntogether with certain personal circumstances and standing obligations\nthat seem unrelated to the subject matter of legislation and to the\nprinciples that govern it. On these facts, there is no reason to\nsuppose that this duty bears the right relation to institutional\npractice, as that was changed by the legislation, which would qualify\nit is as genuine legal duty whose recognition and enforcement would\nserve principled consistency. We have no basis, in this case, to say\nthat the duty was due to the difference that the legislation properly\nmade to the law\u2014though it remains possible that the effect of\nthe difference the legislation did make on Albert\u2019s finances might\nbear on some aspect of antecedent legal rights or duties that he might\nhave, e.g. a duty of child maintenance.\n",
