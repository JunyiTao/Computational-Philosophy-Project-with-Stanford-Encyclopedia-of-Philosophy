    "main_text": "Paradigmatic Relational Situations || Non-Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n4.2 Non-Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nOf all the considerations favoring non-reductive realism, perhaps none\nis more compelling than the intuition that relations have a different\nnature or \u201cquiddity\u201d from that of ordinary categorial\naccidents. As we have seen, medieval philosophers recognize that\npredications involving relative terms (such as \u2018x is\ntaller\u2019) are incomplete in a way that monadic or absolute\npredications (such as \u2018x is white\u2019) are not. They\nalso recognize, moreover, that unlike absolute terms relative terms\ncome in pairs or sets. Every relative term has a correlative, and the\nmeaning of the one (say, \u2018taller\u2019) cannot be understood in\nisolation from the meaning of the other (\u2018shorter\u2019). These\nfacts about relative terms and predication are often thought to show\nthat their significata have a distinct nature or quiddity from the\nordinary, absolute accidents that serve as their foundations. Here\nagain it is useful to quote Harclay:\n\n\nAvicenna (Metaphysics III, the chapter on relation) says that\na relation has its own quiddity distinct from the quiddity of its\nfoundation. Therefore it is a distinct reality. Moreover, in the\nCategories Aristotle says that the being associated with\nrelatives is being-toward-something-else (ad aliud se\nhabere).  But it is not the case that the being of a foundation\nis being-toward-something-else. Therefore they are not the same.\n(\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 43.)\n\n\n\n\nReductive realists can, of course, explain the uniqueness of relative\nterms and predications without introducing relations over and above\ntheir foundations. For they can always (a) assert that relative terms\nare associated with concepts whose content is distinct from that of\nany non-relational or absolute concepts, and yet (b) insist that this\nis all that is required to explain the peculiar nature of relative\nterms and predications. Even so, the question remains: If Simmias\u2019s\nbeing taller than Socrates is nothing ontologically over and above\nSimmias\u2019s and Socrates\u2019s heights, why do we represent it as\nif it were? At this point, it would seem that reductive realists\nhave no choice but to appeal to our psychological make-up. We simply\ndo (or at least can) represent one and the same situation in two very\ndifferent ways. As Ockham says in one of his Quodlibetal\nquestions, using a slightly different example:\n\n\nSocrates is similar to Plato by the very fact that Socrates is white\nand Plato is white \u2026 Yet, despite this, the intellect can\nexpress these many absolute things by means of concepts in diverse\nways: in one way, by means of an absolute concept, as when one says\nsimply \u2018Socrates is white\u2019 or \u2018Plato is\nwhite\u2019; in a second way, by means of a relative concept, as when\none says \u2018Socrates is similar to Plato with respect to\nwhiteness\u2019. (Quodl. VI, q. 25 in Opera\nTheologica ix, 679.)\n\n\n\n\nEven if one does not find this sort of appeal to psychology\nimplausible, the non-reductive realists would seem to have a more\nsatisfying reply to our original question. For they can say that the\nreason we represent relational situations as distinct from\nnon-relational situation is because they are\ndistinct. Indeed, non-reductive realists can add that the logical\nincompleteness of predicates such as \u2018taller\u2019 (and its\ncorrelative, \u2018shorter\u2019) calls our attention to precisely\nwhat makes these situations distinct\u2014namely, the sui\ngeneris accidents that are possessed by Simmias and Socrates in\naddition to their respective heights.\n\n\nNow as most non-reductive realists recognize, there is a difficulty\nposed by their position\u2014namely, that of giving a perspicuous\naccount of the nature of paradigmatic relations or relational\naccidents. But they often attribute this difficulty to the fact that\nthe nature in question is sui generis. As Albert the Great\nsays, when he turns to the discussion of relations in his commentary\non Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics:\n\n\nIt is difficult for us to speak about [the category of] toward\nsomething or relation because it has a nature and being altogether\ndifferent from the genera of being which have been considered so far\n[namely, substance, quantity, and quality]. (Metaphysica,\n266a.)\n\n\n\n\nGiven that non-reductivists construe the nature of paradigmatic\nrelations as sui generis, it is not surprising that they feel\nthe need to resort to metaphors to describe it. Albert himself appeals\nmost often to a visual metaphor of outward-looking-ness\n(respectus), and describes individual relations as that in\nvirtue of which a subject \u201clooks out toward another\u201d\n(respicit ad aliud). Other philosophers, rely on other\nmetaphors and variously describe the nature of relations as a kind of\ndirectionality or toward-ness (aditas), as a type of\ndisposition or way of holding oneself (habitudo or\nrelativa habitudo), or again as the source or principle of\nstructure and order \n (ordinatio).[26]\n\n\nOf all these metaphors, the ones involving directionality\u2014or\nintentionality\u2014are likely to be the most helpful to us. For\nthere are contemporary philosophers who characterize\nintentionality, not in terms of a polyadic or many-place property, but\nas a sui generis type of monadic\n property.[27]\n According to these philosophers, intentionality is a property whose\nintrinsic nature is such that, when it is exemplified by a subject in\nappropriate circumstances, which include the presence of an\nappropriate object, it relates its subject to the object in\nquestion\u2014in particular, it relates the subject to it as thinker\nto object thought. This analogy is useful because non-reductive\nrealists typically regard intentionality as a special case (or type)\nof relation. According to them, all paradigmatic relations (or at\nleast all those that qualify as sui generis accidents) are\nproperties whose intrinsic nature is such that their exemplification\nin the appropriate circumstances will relate their subjects to\nsomething else. It is just that in certain cases, these properties\nrelate their subjects specifically as thinkers to objects thought.\n\n\nIn the end, therefore, it would appear that the non-reductive\nrealists do have something to say in response to the\nreductivists\u2019 worries about the mysterious nature of relations\nand their appeals to considerations of theoretical parsimony. But what\nabout the phenomenon of relational change?\n\n\nAs we said earlier, medieval philosophers share the intuition that\nthe acquisition (or loss) of relations can occur without\nany real change on the part of their subject. To explain this intuition,\nsome non-reductivists think it is enough to say that a relation can be\nacquired (or lost) without its subject undergoing any real change\nwith respect to its absolute accidents. Thus, the example of\nSocrates\u2019s coming to be shorter than Simmias is sometimes glossed\nby saying that, with respect to absolute accidents, it is true that\nSocrates comes to be shorter than Simmias solely in virtue of a real\nchange in Simmias. Nonetheless, if we consider Socrates\u2019s\nrelative accidents as well, such non-reductivists will say that\nSocrates has, in fact, undergone a real \u2018relative\u2019\nchange\u2014that is, a real change with respect to one of his\nrelations.\n [28]\n\n\nBut non-reductivists need not take this line. Some, more sympathetic\nto the reductive realist position on relational change, take cases\nlike that involving Simmias and Socrates as an opportunity to further\nclarify the nature of relations. Albert the Great, for example, argues\nthat relational accidents are so closely tied to their foundations\nthat they are acquired along with them (cf. Metaphysica,\n266b-267a, ad 1 and Brower 2001). Thus, if Socrates comes into\nexistence in a world all by himself at a height of\nfive-feet-ten-inches-tall, not only will he possess a certain quantity\n(namely, his height), but also, in virtue of it, he will possess a\nsui generis relational accident. Obviously, in such a world,\nthe relational accident will not actually relate Socrates to\nanyone or anything (since there\u2019s nothing for it to relate him\nto)\u2014though it will explain his being potentially\nrelated to other things.  Suppose, however, that Simmias now comes\ninto existence in this world at six-feet-tall. In that case,\nSocrates\u2019s relational accident will come actually to relate him to\nSimmias as shorter. Even so, Albert insists, Socrates himself will not\nhave undergone any real change, relative or absolute. Not surprisingly\nthese sorts of consideration lead Albert to distinguish sharply\nbetween relational accidents and relations (which are just relational\naccidents in certain circumstances), and to suggest that strictly\nspeaking we should think of the relevant Aristotelian category as\ncomprised, not of relations, but of relational accidents. These same\nconsiderations also help to explain why, in referring to the members\nof this category, Albert prefers the concrete terms \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 (ad aliquid) and \u2018relative\u2019\n(relativum) to the abstract term \u2018relation\u2019\n(relatio)\u2014for relational accidents are \u2018toward\nsomething\u2019 or outwardly directed even if they are not actually\nrelating their subject to anything.  (Metaphysica, 267a,\nad. 3.)\n\n\nLike Albert, Aquinas too suggests that there is a close connection\nbetween relational accidents and their foundations. Following Albert\u2019s\nterminology, he suggests that in virtue of possessing a specific\nheight or quantity, an individual such as Socrates is\npotentially equal to all those who have the same height, and\npotentially unequal to\u2014that is, shorter or\ntaller than\u2014all those with a different height (In V\nPhys., lect. 3, n. 8). Like Albert, moreover, Aquinas says that\nsuch an individual can come to be actually equal (or unequal)\nto another solely in virtue of a change in that other, and concludes\nfrom this that relations must be in their foundations as in a root\n(in radice) (In V Phys., lect. 3, n. 8). On some\ninterpretations, Aquinas\u2019s metaphor can be explicated by saying that\nalthough relations and their foundations differ formally\u2014that\nis, involve different accidental forms or properties\u2014nonetheless\ntheir act of being (esse) is the same. Thus, when Socrates\ncomes to be shorter than Simmias as a result of Simmias\u2019s growth,\nSocrates does not undergo a change properly speaking, since he does\nnot acquire any new act of being. Rather, the \u201cold\u201d act of\nbeing of his height (sometimes referred to as the\n\u2018esse-in\u2019 of the relation) merely acquires a new\ndetermination (sometimes referred to as the\n\u2018esse-ad\u2019 of the relation), in this case\n to\n Simmias.[29]\n\n\nWe have seen enough to appreciate the main ontological\ndifferences that divide reductive and non-reductive realists, and even\nsome of the differences that divide non-reductivists among themselves.\nAs we indicated earlier, in the later Middle Ages these differences tend\nto emerge in the context of the debate over whether relations are\nidentical with their foundations. As we also indicated, however, we have\nto be careful not to assume that how philosophers answer this\nquestion provides an infallible guide to their positions. For although\nreductivists typically affirm that relations are identical to their\nfoundations, and non-reductivists typically deny it, there are some\nreductivists who side, at least verbally, with the non-reductivists on\nthis question. Thus, the later Harclay, as we are interpreting him, is a\nreductive realist\u2014he not only rejects the existence of\nsui generis relational properties, but maintains that in\nparadigmatic relational situations, substances are related by their\nordinary, non-relational accidents. Nonetheless, Harclay denies that\nrelations are identical with their foundations, since he thinks this\nwould amount to saying that relations can be straightforwardly\nidentified either with ordinary accidents taken by themselves or with\npairs of such accidents taken jointly.\n \n\nAgain, as we shall point out in the next section, a number of later\nmedieval reductivists, including Ockham, eventually come to reject the\ntraditional Aristotelian characterization of relations as items that\nrelate substances in favor of the view that relations are items\nexisting only in the mind (as concepts). As we shall see, this does\nnot mean that Ockham and others deny that there are extramental\ngrounds for our relational concepts or even that things can be related\nby their foundations independently of the mind. On the contrary, it\nmeans only that, unlike their predecessors, they refuse to call\nanything a relation merely because it grounds a relational concept. The fact that\nthese reductivists regard relations as concepts, however, explains why\nthey too are unwilling to identity relations with their foundations:\nfor the relevant foundations, according to these philosophers, are\nordinary, extramental accidents, and obviously no concept (or act of\nthe mind) could be identical with them.\n\n\nFinally, it must be noted that even the notions of identity and real\ndistinction come to be the subject of controversy during the high and\nlater Middle Ages, and this too has the result of complicating the\ndebate over whether relations are identical to their\n foundations.[30]\n For all these reasons, therefore, we must be careful not to identify\ntoo closely the debate between reductive and non-reductive realists\nwith the debate over whether relations are identical to their\nfoundations.\n",
