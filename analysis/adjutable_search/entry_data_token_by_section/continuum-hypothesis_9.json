    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The \u03a9 Conjecture and the Generic Multiverse\n4.3 The \u03a9 Conjecture and the Generic Multiverse\nIs the generic multiverse conception of truth tenable? The answer\nto this question is closely related to the subject of\n\u03a9-logic. The basic connection between generic multiverse truth\nand \u03a9-logic is embodied in the following theorem: \n\nTheorem 4.1\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then, for each\n\u03a02-statement \u03c6 the\nfollowing are equivalent: \n\n \u03c6 is a generic multiverse truth. \n\u03c6 is\n\u03a9-valid. \n\nNow, recall that by Theorem 3.5, under our background assumptions,\n\u03a9-validity is generically invariant. It follows that given our\nbackground theory, the notion of generic multiverse truth is robust\nwith respect to \u03a02-statements. In particular, for\n\u03a02-statements, the statement \u201c\u03c6 is\nindeterminate\u201d is itself determinate according to the\ngeneric multiverse conception. In this sense the conception of truth\nis not \u201cself-undermining\u201d and one is not sent in a\ndownward spiral where one has to countenance multiverses of\nmultiverses. So it passes the first test. Whether it passes a more\nchallenging test depends on the \u03a9 Conjecture. \n The \u03a9 Conjecture has profound consequences for the generic\nmultiverse conception of truth. Let \n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 =\n{\u03c6 | \u2205 \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6}\n\n and, for any specifiable cardinal \u03ba, let \n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9(H(\u03ba+)) =\n{\u03c6 | ZFC \u22a7\u03a9\u201cH(\u03ba+) \u22a7 \u03c6\u201d},\n where recall that H(\u03ba+) is the collection of sets\nof hereditary cardinality less than \u03ba+. Thus,\nassuming ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals, the\nset \n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 is Turing equivalent to the set of\n\u03a02 generic multiverse truths and the\nset \n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9(H(\u03ba+)) is precisely\nthe set of generic multiverse truths of H(\u03ba+). \n To describe the bearing of the \u03a9 Conjecture on the\ngeneric-multiverse conception of truth, we introduce two Transcendence\nPrinciples which serve as constraints on any tenable conception of\ntruth in set theory\u2014a truth constraint and\na definability constraint. \n\nDefinition 4.2 (Truth\nConstraint).  Any tenable multiverse conception of\ntruth in set theory must be such that the \u03a02-truths\n(according to that conception) in the universe of sets are not\nrecursive in the truths about H(\u03ba) (according to that\nconception), for any specifiable cardinal. \nThis constraint is in the spirit of those principles of set\ntheory\u2014most notably, reflection principles\u2014which aim to\ncapture the pretheoretic idea that the universe of sets is so rich\nthat it cannot \u201cbe described from below\u201d; more precisely,\nit asserts that any tenable conception of truth must respect the idea\nthat the universe of sets is so rich that truth (or even just\n\u03a02-truth) cannot be described in some specifiable\nfragment. (Notice that by Tarski's theorem on the undefinability\nof truth, the truth constraint is trivially satisfied by the standard\nconception of truth in set theory which takes the multiverse to\ncontain a single element, namely, V.) \n There is also a related constraint concerning the definability of\ntruth. For a specifiable cardinal \u03ba, set Y \u2286 \u03c9\nis definable in H(\u03ba+) across the\nmultiverse if Y is definable in the structure\nH(\u03ba+) of each universe of the multiverse (possibly by\nformulas which depend on the parent universe). \n\nDefinition 4.3 (Definability\nConstraint).  Any tenable multiverse conception of\ntruth in set theory must be such that the \u03a02-truths\n(according to that conception) in the universe of sets are definable\nin H(\u03ba) across the multiverse universe, for any specifiable\ncardinal \u03ba. \nNotice again that by Tarski's theorem on the undefinability\nof truth, the definability constraint is trivially satisfied by the\ndegenerate multiverse conception that takes the multiverse to contain\nthe single element V. (Notice also that if one modifies the\ndefinability constraint by adding the requirement that the definition\nbe uniform across the multiverse, then the constraint would\nautomatically be met.) \n The bearing of the \u03a9 Conjecture on the tenability of the\ngeneric-multiverse conception of truth is contained in the following\ntwo theorems: \n\nTheorem 4.4\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the\n\u03a9 Conjecture holds. Then\n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 is recursive\nin\n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9(H(\u03b4+0)), where\n\u03b40 is the least Woodin cardinal. \n\nTheorem 4.5\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the\n\u03a9 Conjecture\nholds. Then\n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 is definable in\nH(\u03b4+0), where\n\u03b40 is the least Woodin cardinal. \nIn other words, if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and\nif the \u03a9 Conjecture holds then the generic multiverse conception\nof truth violates both the Truth Constraint (at \u03b40)\nand the Definability Constraint (at \u03b40). \n There are actually sharper versions of the above results that\ninvolve H(c+) in place of\nH(\u03b4+0). \n\nTheorem 4.6\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the\n\u03a9 Conjecture\nholds. Then\n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 is recursive\nin \ud835\udcb1\u03a9(H(c+)). \n\nTheorem 4.7\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the\n\u03a9 Conjecture holds and that the\nAD+ Conjecture\nholds. Then\n\ud835\udcb1\u03a9 is definable in\nH(c+). \nIn other words, if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and\nif the \u03a9 Conjecture holds then the generic-multiverse conception\nof truth violates the Truth Constraint at the level of third-order\narithmetic, and if, in addition, the AD+ Conjecture\nholds, then the generic-multiverse conception of truth violates the\nDefinability Constraint at the level of third-order arithmetic. \n",
