    "main_text": "\n\nIn ordinary conscious experience, consciousness of time seems\ncommonplace. For example, we are often aware of changes, movements,\nand successions unfolding over brief temporal intervals. How is this\npossible? Many different models of temporal consciousness have been\nproposed. Some philosophers have argued that consciousness is confined\nto a momentary interval and that we are not in fact directly aware of\nchange. Others have argued that although consciousness itself is\nmomentary, we are nevertheless conscious of change. Still others have\nargued that consciousness is itself extended in time. In this entry,\nthe motivations and merits of these and other positions will be\nexpounded and assessed.\n",
