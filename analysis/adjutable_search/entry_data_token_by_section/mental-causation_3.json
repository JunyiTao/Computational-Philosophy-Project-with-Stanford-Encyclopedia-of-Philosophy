    "main_text": "The Problem of Interaction || What is the Mind-Body Nexus?\n2.1 What is the Mind-Body Nexus?\n\nAccording to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of thing,\nor, in the technical terminology of the day, distinct kinds of\nsubstance. Bodies, he held, are spatially extended\nsubstances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are\nunextended, thinking, feeling substances: souls. (We use\n\u201csoul\u201d with no theological implications to designate minds\nconsidered in the Cartesian way as immaterial substances.) Despite\nrecognizing these deep differences, Descartes accepted the common\nbelief that mind and body causally interact: \u201cEveryone feels\nthat he is a single person with both body and thought so related by\nnature that the thought can move the body and feel the things which\nhappen to it\u201d (in Cottingham et al. 1991, p. 228). But if minds\nand bodies are so radically different, it is not easy to see how they\ncould interact. Descartes was well aware of the difficulty.\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia puts it forcefully to him in a 1643\nletter, pressing Descartes to tell her\n\nhow the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in\nthe body so as to perform voluntary acts\u2014being as it is merely a\nconscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to\ncome about from the moving body\u2019s being propelled\u2014to\ndepend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or\nagain, on the nature and shape of this latter thing\u2019s surface.\nNow the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves\nthat the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude\nextension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me\nincompatible with a thing\u2019s being immaterial (in Anscombe and\nGeach 1954, pp. 274\u20135).\n\n\nElisabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how\ncausation of bodies works: it must involve the cause\u2019s impelling\nthe body, where this requires contact between cause and effect. Since\na soul could never come into contact with a body\u2014souls have no\nspatial location\u2014an immaterial soul could never impel, and so\ncould never causally interact with, a body.\n\nElisabeth\u2019s worries might seem quaint and outdated. Causal\nrelations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms,\nnot all of which are of the push-pull variety. Why shouldn\u2019t\nsoul\u2013body interaction simply be included as another sort of\n\u201cnon-mechanistic\u201d causation (Richardson 1982)? But\nElisabeth\u2019s objection is in fact just one version of a more\ngeneral worry about soul\u2013body interaction, a worry that rests on\nthe following thesis about causation:\n\n(CN)  Any causal\nrelation requires a nexus, some interface by means of which\ncause and effect are connected.\n\n\nElisabeth presumes that when an effect is bodily motion, the required\nnexus is spatial contact. But even if she is wrong about this (Garber\n1983), (CN) nevertheless poses problems for the dualist: if contact is\nnot the mind\u2013body nexus, what is?\n\nOne line of thought appeals to the transference theory of causality.\nHere the idea is that identity\u2014the persistence of something from\ncause to effect\u2014provides the needed link. If something in a soul\ncould become present in a body, this could bridge the immaterial and\nmaterial. Descartes himself appears to accept such a theory, declaring\nin the Third Meditation that there could be nothing in an effect not\npresent in its total efficient cause (Descartes 1642/1996, p. 28). But\nnow the problem reasserts itself: if, as the substance dualist\ninsists, bodies and minds are radically different, they have no\nproperties in common. According to Descartes, a body\u2019s\nproperties are modes of extension, ways of being extended, while a\nsoul\u2019s properties are modes of something quite different,\nthought or consciousness. If causation involved transference, a\nCartesian soul could not interact with a body (but see Hart 1988;\nHoffman and Rosenkrantz 1991).\n\nDoes a dualist need to accept (CN), however? The notion of a causal\nnexus has come under criticism, often from philosophers working in the\nHumean tradition (Blackburn 1990). More generally, (CN) and kindred\nprinciples might be thought to rest on a conception of causality that\nis now obsolete, finding no place in modern physics (for further\ndiscussion, see\n the metaphysics of causation,\n \u00a72). But the next three versions of the problem can arise even\nfor those who reject the need for a causal nexus.\n",
