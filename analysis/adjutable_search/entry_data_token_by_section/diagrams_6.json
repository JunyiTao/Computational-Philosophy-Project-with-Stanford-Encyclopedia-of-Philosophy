The main revision from Euler to Venn\ndiagrams, introducing primary diagrams, allows us to represent partial\nknowledge about relations between sets. The extension from Venn to\nPeirce diagrams is made so that existential and disjunctive\ninformation may be represented more effectively.\n\nBoth Venn and Peirce adopted the same kind of solution in order to\nachieve these improvements: to introduce new syntactic objects, that\nis, shadings by Venn, and \u2018x\u2019s, \u2018o\u2019s, and\nlines by Peirce. However, on the negative side, these revised systems\nsuffer from a loss of visual clarity, as seen above, mainly because of\nthe introduction of more arbitrary conventions. The modifications from\nPeirce to Shin diagrams concentrate on restoring visual clarity, but\nwithout loss of expressive power.\n\nHammer and Shin take a different path from these revisions: To revive\nEuler\u2019s homomorphic relation between circles and\nsets\u2014containment among circles represents the subset relation\namong sets, and non-overlapping of regions represents the disjoint\nrelation\u2014and at the same time, to adopt Venn\u2019s primary\ndiagrams by default. On the other hand, this revised Euler system is\nnot a self-sufficient tool for syllogistic reasoning, since it cannot\nrepresent existential statements. For more details of this revised\nsystem, refer to (Hammer & Shin\n 1998).\n\nThis case study raises an interesting question for further research on\ndiagrammatic reasoning. Throughout the different developments of Euler\ndiagrams, increasing its expressive power and enhancing its visual\nclarity seem to be complementary to each other. Depending on purposes,\nwe need to give priority to one over the other. Hammer and\nShin\u2019s alternative system provides a simple model for the\ndevelopment of other efficient non-sentential representational\nsystems, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention in\ncomputer science and cognitive science.\n",
