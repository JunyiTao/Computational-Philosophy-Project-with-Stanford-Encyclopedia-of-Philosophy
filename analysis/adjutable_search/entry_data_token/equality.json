Defining the Concept\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 is a contested concept: \u201cPeople who\npraise it or disparage it disagree about what they are praising or\ndisparaging\u201d (Dworkin 2000, p. 2). Our first task is therefore\nto provide a clear definition of equality in the face of widespread\nmisconceptions about its meaning as a political idea. The terms\n\u2018equality\u2019 (Greek: isotes; Latin:\naequitas, aequalitas; French:\n\u00e9galit\u00e9; German Gleichheit),\n\u2018equal\u2019, and \u2018equally\u2019 signify a qualitative\nrelationship. \u2018Equality\u2019 (or \u2018equal\u2019)\nsignifies correspondence between a group of different objects,\npersons, processes or circumstances that have the same qualities in at\nleast one respect, but not all respects, i.e., regarding one specific\nfeature, with differences in other features. \u2018Equality\u2019\nmust then be distinguished from \u2018identity\u2019, which refers\nto one and the same object corresponding to itself in all its\nfeatures. For the same reason, it needs to be distinguished from\n\u2018similarity\u2019 \u2013 the concept of merely approximate\ncorrespondence (Dann 1975, p. 997; Menne 1962, p. 44 ff.; Westen 1990,\npp. 39, 120). Thus, to say that men are equal, for example, is not to\nsay that they are identical. Equality implies similarity rather than\n\u2018sameness\u2019.\n\nJudgements of equality presume a difference between the things\ncompared. According to this definition, the notion of\n\u2018complete\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 equality may be seen\nas problematic because it would violate the presumption of a\ndifference. Two non-identical objects are never completely equal; they\nare different at least in their spatiotemporal location. If things do\nnot differ they should not be called \u2018equal\u2019, but rather,\nmore precisely, \u2018identical\u2019, such as the morning and the\nevening star. Here usage might vary. Some authors do consider absolute\nqualitative equality admissible as a borderline concept (Tugendhat\n& Wolf 1983, p. 170).\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 can be used in the very same sense both to\ndescribe and prescribe, as with \u2018thin\u2019: \u201cyou are\nthin\u201d and \u201cyou are too thin\u201d. The approach taken to\ndefining the standard of comparison for both descriptive and\nprescriptive assertions of equality is very important (Oppenheim\n1970). In the descriptive case, the common standard is itself\ndescriptive, for example when two people are said to have the same\nweight. In the prescriptive use, the standard prescribes a\nnorm or rule, for example when it is said people ought to be equal\nbefore the law. The standards grounding prescriptive assertions of\nequality contain at least two components. On the one hand, there is a\ndescriptive component, since the assertions need to contain\ndescriptive criteria, in order to identify those people to which the\nrule or norm applies. The question of this identification \u2013 who\nbelongs to which category? \u2013 may itself be normative, as when we\nask to whom the U.S. laws apply. On the other hand, the comparative\nstandards contain something normative \u2013 a moral or legal rule,\nsuch as the U.S. laws \u2013 specifying how those falling under the\nnorm are to be treated. Such a rule constitutes the prescriptive\ncomponent (Westen 1990, chap. 3). Sociological and economic analyses\nof (in-)equality mainly pose the questions of how inequalities can be\ndetermined and measured and what their causes and effects are. In\ncontrast, social and political philosophy is in general concerned\nmainly with the following questions: what kind of equality,\nif any, should obtain, and with respect to whom and\nwhen? Such is the case in this article as well.\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 and \u2018equal\u2019 are incomplete\npredicates that necessarily generate one question: equal in what\nrespect? (Rae 1980,p. 132 f.) Equality essentially consists of a\ntripartite relation between two (or several) objects or persons and\none (or several) qualities. Two objects A and B are equal in a certain\nrespect if, in that respect, they fall under the same general term.\n\u2018Equality\u2019 denotes the relation between the objects\ncompared. Every comparison presumes a tertium comparationis,\na concrete attribute defining the respect in which the equality\napplies \u2013 equality thus referring to a common sharing of this\ncomparison-determining attribute. This relevant comparative standard\nrepresents a \u2018variable\u2019 (or \u2018index\u2019) of the\nconcept of equality that needs to be specified in each particular case\n(Westen 1990, p. 10); differing conceptions of equality here emerge\nfrom one or another descriptive or normative moral standard. There is\nanother source of diversity as well: As Temkin (1986, 1993, 2009)\nargues, various different standards might be used to measure\ninequality, with the respect in which people are compared remaining\nconstant. The difference between a general concept and different\nspecific conceptions (Rawls 1971, p. 21 f.) of equality may explain\nwhy some people claim \u2018equality\u2019 has no unified\nmeaning \u2013 or is even devoid of meaning. (Rae 1981, p. 127 f.,\n132 f.)\n\nFor this reason, it helps to think of the idea of equality or\ninequality, in the context of social justice, not as a single\nprinciple, but as a complex group of principles forming the basic core\nof today\u2019s egalitarianism. Different principles yield\ndifferent answers. Both equality and inequality are complex and\nmultifaceted concepts (Temkin 1993, chap. 2). In any real historical\ncontext, it is clear that no single notion of equality can sweep the\nfield (Rae 1981, p. 132). Many egalitarians concede that much of our\ndiscussion of the concept is vague, but they believe there is also a\ncommon underlying strain of important moral concerns implicit in it\n(Williams 1973). Above all, it serves to remind us of our common\nhumanity, despite various differences (cf. 2.3. below). In this sense,\negalitarianism is often thought of as a single, coherent normative\ndoctrine that embraces a variety of principles. Following the\nintroduction of different principles and theories of equality, the\ndiscussion will return in the last section to the question how best to\ndefine egalitarianism and its core value.\n2. Principles of Equality and Justice\n\nEquality in its prescriptive usage is closely linked to morality and\njustice, and distributive justice in particular. Since antiquity\nequality has been considered a constitutive feature of justice. (On\nthe history of the concept, cf. Albernethy 1959, Benn 1967, Brown\n1988, Dann 1975, Thomson 1949.) People and movements throughout\nhistory have used the language of justice to contest inequalities. But\nwhat kind of role does equality play in a theory of justice?\nPhilosophers have sought to clarify this by defending a variety of\nprinciples and conceptions of equality. This section introduces four\nsuch principles, ranging from the highly general and uncontroversial\nto the more specific and controversial. The next section reviews\nvarious conceptions of the \u2018currency\u2019 of equality.\nDifferent interpretations of the role of equality in a theory of\njustice emerge according to which of the four principles and metrics\nhave been adopted. The first three principles of equality hold\ngenerally and primarily for all actions upon others and affecting\nothers, and for their resulting circumstances. From the fourth\nprinciple onward, i.e., starting with the presumption of equality, the\nfocus will be mainly on distributive justice and the evaluation of\ndistribution.\n2.1 Formal Equality\n\nWhen two persons have equal status in at least one normatively\nrelevant respect, they must be treated equally with regard in this\nrespect. This is the generally accepted formal equality\nprinciple that Aristotle articulated in reference to Plato:\n\u201ctreat like cases as like\u201d (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, V.3. 1131a10\u2013b15; Politics, III.9.1280 a8\u201315,\nIII. 12. 1282b18\u201323). The crucial question is which respects are\nnormatively relevant and which are not. Some authors see this formal\nprinciple of equality as a specific application of a rule of\nrationality: it is irrational, because inconsistent, to treat equal\ncases unequally without sufficient reasons (Berlin 1955\u201356). But\nothers claim that what is at stake here is a moral principle of\njustice, one reflecting the impartial and universalizable nature of\nmoral judgments. On this view, the postulate of formal equality\ndemands more than consistency with one\u2019s subjective preferences: the\nequal or unequal treatment in question must be justifiable to the\nrelevantly affected parties, and this on the sole basis of a\nsituation\u2019s objective features.\n2.2 Proportional Equality\n\nAccording to Aristotle, there are two kinds of equality, numerical and\nproportional (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1130b\u20131132b; cf.\nPlato, Laws, VI.757b\u2013c). A way of treating others, or a\ndistribution arising from it, is equal numerically when it\ntreats all persons as indistinguishable, thus treating them\nidentically or granting them the same quantity of a good per capita.\nThat is not always just. In contrast, a way of treating others or a\ndistribution is proportional or relatively equal when it\ntreats all relevant persons in relation to their due. Just\nnumerical equality is a special case of proportional\nequality. Numerical equality is only just under special circumstances,\nnamely when persons are equal in the relevant respects so that the\nrelevant proportions are equal. Proportional equality further\nspecifies formal equality; it is the more precise and comprehensive\nformulation of formal equality. It indicates what produces an adequate\nequality.\n\nProportional equality in the treatment and distribution of goods to\npersons involves at least the following concepts or variables: Two or\nmore persons \\((P_1, P_2)\\) and two or more allocations of goods to\npersons \\((G)\\) and \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as the quantity in which\nindividuals have the relevant normative quality \\(E\\). This can be\nrepresented as an equation with fractions or as a ratio. If \\(P1\\) has\n\\(E\\) in the amount of \\(X\\) and if \\(P_2\\) has \\(E\\) in the amount\n\\(Y\\), then \\(P_1\\) is due \\(G\\) in the amount of \\(X'\\) and \\(P_2\\) is\ndue \\(G\\) in the amount of \\(Y'\\), so that the ratio \\(X/Y = X'/Y'\\)\nis valid. (For the formula to be usable, the potentially large variety\nof factors involved have to be both quantifiable in principle and\ncommensurable, i.e., capable of synthesis into an aggregate\nvalue.)\n\nWhen factors speak for unequal treatment or distribution, because the\npersons are unequal in relevant respects, the treatment or\ndistribution proportional to these factors is just. Unequal claims to\ntreatment or distribution must be considered proportionally: that is\nthe prerequisite for persons being considered equally.\n\nThis principle can also be incorporated into hierarchical,\ninegalitarian theories. It indicates that equal output is demanded\nwith equal input. Aristocrats, perfectionists, and meritocrats all\nbelieve that persons should be assessed according to their differing\ndeserts, understood in the broad sense of fulfillment of some relevant\ncriterion. Reward and punishment, benefits and burdens, should be\nproportional to such deserts. Since this definition leaves open who is\ndue what, there can be great inequality when it comes to presumed\nfundamental (natural) rights, deserts, and worth -\u2013 this is\napparent in both Plato and Aristotle.\n\nAristotle\u2019s idea of justice as proportional equality contains a\nfundamental insight. The idea offers a framework for a rational\nargument between egalitarian and non-egalitarian ideas of justice, its\nfocal point being the question of the basis for an adequate equality\n(Hinsch 2003). Both sides accept justice as proportional equality.\nAristotle\u2019s analysis makes clear that the argument involves those\nfeatures that decide whether two persons are to be considered equal or\nunequal in a distributive context.\n\nOn the formal level of pure conceptual explication, justice and\nequality are linked through these formal and proportional principles.\nJustice cannot be explained without these equality principles, which\nthemselves only receive their normative significance in their role as\nprinciples of justice.\n\nFormal and proportional equality is simply a conceptual schema. It\nneeds to be made precise \u2013 i.e., its open variables need to be\nfilled out. The formal postulate remains empty as long as it is\nunclear when, or through what features, two or more persons or cases\nshould be considered equal. All debates over the proper conception of\njustice \u2013 over who is due what \u2013 can be understood as\ncontroversies over the question of which cases are equal and which\nunequal (Aristotle, Politics, 1282b 22). For this reason,\nequality theorists are correct in stressing that the claim that\npersons are owed equality becomes informative only when one is told\nwhat kind of equality they are owed (Nagel 1979; Rae 1981;\nSen 1992, p. 13). Every normative theory implies a certain notion of\nequality. In order to outline their position, egalitarians must thus\ntake account of a specific (egalitarian) conception of equality. To do\nso, they need to identify substantive principles of equality, which\nare discussed below.\n2.3 Moral Equality\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, it was assumed that human beings are\nunequal by nature. This postulate collapsed with the advent of the\nidea of natural right, which assumed a natural order in which all\nhuman beings were equal. Against Plato and Aristotle, the classical\nformula for justice according to which an action is just when it\noffers each individual his or her due took on a substantively\negalitarian meaning in the course of time: everyone deserved the same\ndignity and respect. This is now the widely held conception of\nsubstantive, universal, moral equality. It developed among the Stoics,\nwho emphasized the natural equality of all rational beings, and in\nearly New Testament Christianity, which envisioned that all humans\nwere equal before God, although this principle was not always adhered\nto in the later history of the church. This important idea was also\ntaken up both in the Talmud and in Islam, where it was grounded in\nboth Greek and Hebraic elements. In the modern period, starting in the\nseventeenth century, the dominant idea was of natural equality in the\ntradition of natural law and social contract theory. Hobbes (1651)\npostulated that in their natural condition, individuals possess equal\nrights, because over time they have the same capacity to do each other\nharm. Locke (1690) argued that all human beings have the same natural\nright to both (self-)ownership and freedom. Rousseau (1755) declared\nsocial inequality to be the result of a decline from the natural\nequality that characterized our harmonious state of nature, a decline\ncatalyzed by the human urge for perfection, property and possessions\n(Dahrendorf 1962). For Rousseau (1755, 1762), the resulting inequality\nand rule of violence can only be overcome by binding individual\nsubjectivity to a common civil existence and popular sovereignty. In\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy (1785), the categorical imperative formulates\nthe equality postulate of universal human worth. His transcendental\nand philosophical reflections on autonomy and self-legislation lead to\na recognition of the same freedom for all rational beings as the sole\nprinciple of human rights (Kant 1797, p. 230). Such Enlightenment\nideas stimulated the great modern social movements and revolutions,\nand were taken up in modern constitutions and declarations of human\nrights. During the French Revolution, equality, along with freedom and\nfraternity, became a basis of the D\u00e9claration des droits de\nl\u2019homme et du citoyen of 1789.\n\nThe principle that holds that human beings, despite their differences,\nare to be regarded as one another\u2019s equals, is often also called\n\u2018human equality\u2019 or \u2018basic equality\u2019 or\n\u2018equal worth\u2019 or \u2018human dignity\u2019 (William\n1962, Vlastos 1962, Kateb 2014, Waldron 2017, Rosen 2018). Whether\nthese terms are synonyms is a matter of interpretation, but\n\u201cthey cluster together to form a powerful body of\nprinciple\u201d (Waldron 2017, p. 3).\n\nThis fundamental idea of equal respect for all persons and of the\nequal worth or equal dignity of all human beings (Vlastos 1962) is\nwidely accepted (Carter 2011, but see also Steinhoff 2015). In a\nperiod in which there is not agreement across the members of a complex\nsociety to any one metaphysical, religious, or traditional view\n(Habermas 1983, p. 53, 1992, pp. 39\u201344), it appears impossible to\npeacefully reach a general agreement on common political aims without\naccepting that persons must be treated as equals. As a result, moral\nequality constitutes the \u2018egalitarian plateau\u2019 for all\ncontemporary political theories (Kymlicka 1990, p. 5).\n\nFundamental equality means that persons are alike in important\nrelevant and specified respects alone, and not that they are all\ngenerally the same or can be treated in the same way (Nagel 1991). In\na now commonly posed distinction, stemming from Dworkin (1977, p.\n227), moral equality can be understood as prescribing treatment of\npersons as equals, i.e., with equal concern and respect, and not the\noften implausible principle of providing all persons with equal\ntreatment. Recognizing that human beings are all equally individual\ndoes not mean treating them uniformly in any respects other than those\nin which they clearly have a moral claim to be treated alike.\n\nDisputes arise, of course, concerning what these claims amount to and\nhow they should be resolved. Philosophical debates are concerned with\nthe kind of equal treatment normatively required when we mutually\nconsider ourselves persons with equal dignity. The principle of moral\nequality is too abstract and needs to be made concrete if we are to\narrive at a clear moral standard. Nevertheless, no conception of just\nequality can be deduced from the notion of moral equality. Rather, we\nfind competing philosophical conceptions of equal treatment serving as\ninterpretations of moral equality. These need to be assessed according\nto their degree of fidelity to the deeper ideal of moral equality\n(Kymlicka 1990, p. 44).\n2.4 Presumption of Equality\n\nMany conceptions of equality operate along procedural lines involving\na presumption of equality. More materially concrete, ethical\napproaches, as described in the next section below, are concerned with\ndistributive criteria \u2013 the presumption of equality, in\ncontrast, is a formal, procedural principle of construction located on\na higher formal and argumentative level. What is at stake here is the\nquestion of the principle with which a material conception of justice\nshould be constructed, particularly once the approaches described\nabove prove inadequate. The presumption of equality is a prima facie\nprinciple of equal distribution for all goods politically suited for\nthe process of public distribution. In the domain of political\njustice, all members of a given community, taken together as a\ncollective body, have to decide centrally on the fair distribution of\nsocial goods, as well as on the distribution\u2019s fair realization. Any\nclaim to a particular distribution, including any existing\ndistributive scheme, has to be impartially justified, i.e., no\nownership should be recognized without justification. Applied to this\npolitical domain, the presumption of equality requires that everyone\nshould get an equal share in the distribution unless certain types of\ndifferences are relevant and justify, through universally acceptable\nreasons, unequal shares. (With different terms and arguments, this\nprinciple is conceived as a presumption by Benn & Peters (1959,\n111) and by Bedau (1967, 19); as a relevant reasons approach by\nWilliams (1973); as a conception of symmetry by Tugendhat (1993, 374;\n1997, chap. 3); as default option by Hinsch (2002, chap. 5); for\ncriticism of the presumption of equality, cf. Westen (1990, chap.\n10).) This presumption results in a principle of prima facie equal\ndistribution for all distributable goods. A strict principle of equal\ndistribution is not required, but it is morally necessary to justify\nimpartially any unequal distribution. The burden of proof lies on the\nside of those who favor any form of unequal distribution. (For a\njustification of the presumption in favor of equality s. Gosepath\n2004, II.8.; Gosepath 2015.)\n\nThe presumption of equality provides an elegant procedure for\nconstructing a theory of distributive justice (Gosepath 2004). One has\nonly to analyze what can justify unequal treatment or unequal\ndistribution in different spheres. To put it briefly, the following\npostulates of equality are at present generally considered morally\nrequired.\n\nStrict equality is called for in the legal sphere of civil freedoms,\nsince \u2013 putting aside limitation on freedom as punishment\n\u2013 there is no justification for any exceptions. As follows from\nthe principle of formal equality, all citizens must have equal general\nrights and duties, which are grounded in general laws that apply to\nall. This is the postulate of legal equality. In addition, the\npostulate of equal freedom is equally valid: every person should have\nthe same freedom to structure his or her life, and this in the most\nfar-reaching manner possible in a peaceful and appropriate social\norder.\n\nIn the political sphere, the possibilities for political participation\nshould be equally distributed. All citizens have the same claim to\nparticipation in forming public opinion, and in the distribution,\ncontrol, and exercise of political power. This is the postulate\n\u2013 requiring equal opportunity \u2013 of equal political power\nsharing. To ensure equal opportunity, social institutions have to be\ndesigned in such a way that persons who are disadvantaged, e.g. have a\nstutter or a low income, have an equal chance to make their views\nknown and to participate fully in the democratic process.\n\nIn the social sphere, equally gifted and motivated citizens must have\napproximately the same chances to obtain offices and positions,\nindependent of their economic or social class and native endowments.\nThis is the postulate of fair equality of social opportunity. Any\nunequal outcome must nevertheless result from equality of opportunity,\ni.e., qualifications alone should be the determining factor, not\nsocial background or influences of milieu.\n\nThe equality required in the economic sphere is complex, taking\naccount of several positions that \u2013 each according to the\npresumption of equality \u2013 justify a turn away from equality. A\nsalient problem here is what constitutes justified exceptions to equal\ndistribution of goods, the main subfield in the debate over adequate\nconceptions of distributive equality and its currency. The following\nfactors are usually considered eligible for justified unequal\ntreatment: (a) need or differing natural disadvantages (e.g.\ndisabilities); (b) existing rights or claims (e.g. private property);\n(c) differences in the performance of special services (e.g. desert,\nefforts, or sacrifices); (d) efficiency; and (e) compensation for\ndirect and indirect or structural discrimination (e.g. affirmative\naction).\n\nThese factors play an essential, albeit varied, role in the following\nalternative egalitarian theories of distributive justice. These offer\ndifferent accounts of what should be equalized in the economic sphere.\nMost can be understood as applications of the presumption of equality\n(whether they explicitly acknowledge it or not); only a few (like\nstrict equality, libertarianism, and sufficiency) are alternatives to\nthe presumption.\n3. Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What?\n\nEvery effort to interpret the concept of equality and to apply the\nprinciples of equality mentioned above demands a precise measure of\nthe parameters of equality. We need to know the dimensions within\nwhich the striving for equality is morally relevant. What follows is a\nbrief review of the seven most prominent conceptions of distributive\nequality, each offering a different answer to one question: in the\nfield of distributive justice, what should be equalized, or what\nshould be the parameter or \u201ccurrency\u201d of equality?\n3.1 Simple Equality and Objections to Equality in General\n\nSimple equality, meaning everyone being furnished with the\nsame material level of goods and services, represents a strict\nposition as far as distributive justice is concerned. It is generally\nrejected as untenable.\n\nHence, with the possible exception of Babeuf (1796) and Shaw (1928),\nno prominent author or movement has demanded strict equality. Since\negalitarianism has come to be widely associated with the demand for\neconomic equality, and this in turn with communistic or socialistic\nideas, it is important to stress that neither communism nor socialism\n\u2013 despite their protest against poverty and exploitation and\ntheir demand for social security for all citizens \u2013 calls for\nabsolute economic equality. The orthodox Marxist view of economic\nequality was expounded in the Critique of the Gotha Program\n(1875). Marx here rejects the idea of legal equality, on three\ngrounds. First, he indicates, equality draws on a limited number of\nmorally relevant perspectives and neglects others, thus having unequal\neffects. In Marx\u2019s view, the economic structure is the most\nfundamental basis for the historical development of society, and is\nthus the point of reference for explaining its features. Second,\ntheories of justice have concentrated excessively on distribution\ninstead of the basic questions of production. Third, a future\ncommunist society needs no law and no justice, since social conflicts\nwill have vanished.\n\nAs an idea, simple equality fails because of problems that\nare raised in regards to equality in general. It is useful to review\nthese problems, as they require resolution in any plausible approach\nto equality.\n\n(i) We need adequate indices for the measurement of the equality of\nthe goods to be distributed. Through what concepts should equality and\ninequality be understood? It is thus clear that equality of material\ngoods can lead to unequal satisfaction. Money constitutes a typical,\nthough inadequate, index; at the very least, equal opportunity has to\nbe conceived in other terms.\n\n(ii) The time span needs to be indicated for realizing the desired\nmodel of equal distribution (McKerlie 1989, Sikora 1989). Should we\nseek to equalize the goods in question over complete individual\nlifetimes, or should we seek to ensure that various life segments are\nas equally provisioned as possible?\n\n(iii) Equality distorts incentives promoting achievement in the\neconomic field, and the administrative costs of redistribution produce\nwasteful inefficiencies (Okun 1975). Equality and efficiency need to\nbe balanced. Often, Pareto-optimality is demanded in this respect,\nusually by economists. A social condition is Pareto-optimal or\nPareto-efficient when it is not possible to shift to another condition\njudged better by at least one person and worse by none (Sen 1970,\nchap. 2, 2*). A widely discussed alternative to the Pareto principle\nis the Kaldor-Hicks welfare criterion. This stipulates that a rise in\nsocial welfare is always present when the benefits accruing through\nthe distribution of value in a society exceed the corresponding costs.\nA change thus becomes desirable when the winners in such a change\ncould compensate the losers for their losses, and still retain a\nsubstantial profit. In contrast to the Pareto-criterion, the\nKaldor-Hicks criterion contains a compensation rule (Kaldor 1939). For\npurposes of economic analysis, such theoretical models of optimal\nefficiency make a great deal of sense. However, the analysis is always\nmade relative to a starting situation that can itself be unjust and\nunequal. A society can thus be (close to) Pareto-optimality \u2013\ni.e., no one can increase his or her material goods or freedoms\nwithout diminishing those of someone else \u2013 while also\ndisplaying enormous inequalities in the distribution of the same goods\nand freedoms. For this reason, egalitarians claim that it may be\nnecessary to reduce Pareto-optimality for the sake of justice, if\nthere is no more egalitarian distribution that is also Pareto-optimal.\nIn the eyes of their critics, equality of whatever kind should not\nlead to some people having to make do with less, when this equalizing\ndown does not benefit any of those who are in a worse position.\n\n(iv) Moral objections: A strict and mechanical equal\ndistribution between all individuals does not sufficiently take into\naccount the differences among individuals and their situations. In\nessence, since individuals desire different things, why should\neveryone receive the same goods? Intuitively, for example, we can\nrecognize that a sick person has other claims than a healthy person,\nand furnishing each with the same goods would be mistaken. With simple\nequality, personal freedoms are unacceptably limited and distinctive\nindividual qualities insufficiently acknowledged; in this way they are\nin fact unequally regarded. Furthermore, persons not only have a moral\nright to their own needs being considered, but a right and a duty to\ntake responsibility for their own decisions and the resulting\nconsequences.\n\nWorking against the identification of distributive justice with simple\nequality, a basic postulate of many present-day egalitarians\nis as follows: human beings are themselves responsible for certain\ninequalities resulting from their free decisions; aside from minimum\naid in emergencies, they deserve no recompense for such inequalities\n(but cf. relational egalatarians, discussed in Section\n 4).\nOn the other hand, they are due compensation for inequalities that are\nnot the result of self-chosen options. For egalitarians, the world is\nmorally better when equality of life conditions prevail. This\nis an amorphous ideal demanding further clarification. Why is such\nequality an ideal, and what precise currency of equality does it\ninvolve?\n\nBy the same token, most egalitarians do not advocate an equality of\noutcome, but different kinds of equality of opportunity, due to their\nemphasis on a pair of morally central points: that individuals are\nresponsible for their decisions, and that the only things to be\nconsidered objects of equality are those which serve the real\ninterests of individuals. The opportunities to be equalized between\npeople can be opportunities for well-being (i.e. objective welfare),\nor for preference satisfaction (i.e., subjective welfare), or for\nresources. It is not equality of objective or subjective well-being or\nresources themselves that should be equalized, but an equal\nopportunity to gain the well-being or resources one aspires to. Such\nequality depends on their being a realm of options for each individual\nequal to the options enjoyed by all other persons, in the sense of the\nsame prospects for fulfillment of preferences or the possession of\nresources. The opportunity must consist of possibilities one can\nreally take advantage of. Equal opportunity prevails when human beings\neffectively enjoy equal realms of possibility.\n\n(v) Simple equality is very often associated with equality of results\n(although these are two distinct concepts). However, to strive only\nfor equality of results is problematic. To illustrate the point, let\nus briefly limit the discussion to a single action and the event or\nstate of affairs resulting from it. Arguably, actions should not be\njudged solely by the moral quality of their results, as important as\nthis may be. One must also consider the way in which the events or\ncircumstances to be evaluated have come about. Generally speaking, a\nmoral judgement requires not only the assessment of the results of the\naction in question (the consequentialist aspect) but, first and\nforemost, the assessment of the intention of the actor (the\ndeontological aspect). The source and its moral quality influence the\nmoral judgement of the results (Pogge 1999, sect. V). For example, if\nyou strike me, your blow will hurt me; the pain I feel may be\nconsidered bad in itself, but the moral status of your blow will also\ndepend on whether you were (morally) allowed such a gesture (perhaps\nthrough parental status, although that is controversial) or even\nobliged to execute it (e.g. as a police officer preventing me from\ndoing harm to others), or whether it was in fact prohibited but not\nprevented. What is true of individual actions (or their omission) has\nto be true mutatis mutandis of social institutions and\ncircumstances like distributions resulting from collective social\nactions (or their omission). Social institutions should therefore be\nassessed not only on the basis of information about how they affect\nindividual quality of life. A society in which people starve on the\nstreets is certainly marked by inequality; nevertheless, its moral\nquality, i.e., whether the society is just or unjust with regard to\nthis problem, also depends on the suffering\u2019s causes. Does the society\nallow starvation as an unintended but tolerable side effect of what\nits members see as a just distributive scheme? Indeed, does it even\ndefend the suffering as a necessary means, as with forms of Social\nDarwinism? Or has the society taken measures against starvation which\nhave turned out to be insufficient? In the latter case, whether the\nsociety has taken such steps for reasons of political morality or\nefficiency again makes a moral difference. Hence even for\negalitarians, equality of results is too narrow and one-sided a\nfocus.\n\n(vi) Finally, there is a danger of (strict) equality leading to\nuniformity, rather than to a respect for pluralism and democracy\n(Cohen 1989; Arneson 1993). In the contemporary debate, this complaint\nhas been mainly articulated in feminist and multiculturalist theory. A\ncentral tenet of feminist theory is that gender has been and remains a\nhistorically variable and internally differentiated relation of\ndomination. The same holds for so-called racial and ethnic\ndifferences, which are often still conceived of as marking different\nvalues. The different groups involved here rightly object to their\ndiscrimination, marginalization, and domination, and an appeal to\nequality of status thus seems a solution. However, as feminists and\nmulticulturalists have pointed out, equality, as usually understood\nand practiced, is constituted in part by a denial and ranking of\ndifferences; as a result it seems less useful as an antidote to\nrelations of domination. \u201cEquality\u201d can often mean the\nassimilation to a pre-existing and problematic \u2018male\u2019 or\n\u2018white\u2019 or \u2018middle class\u2019 norm. In short,\ndomination and a fortiori inequality often arises out of an inability\nto appreciate and nurture differences, not out of a failure to see\neveryone as the same. To recognize these differences should however\nnot lead to an essentialism grounded in sexual or cultural\ncharacteristics. There is a crucial debate between those who insist\nthat sexual, racial, and ethnic differences should become irrelevant,\non the one hand, and those believing that such differences, even\nthough culturally relevant, should not furnish a basis for inequality:\nthat one should rather find mechanisms for securing equality, despite\nvalued differences. Neither of these strategies involves rejecting\nequality. The dispute is about how equality is to be attained\n(McKinnon 1989, Taylor 1992).\n\nProposing a connection between equality and pluralism, Michael\nWalzer\u2019s theory (1983) aims at what he calls \u201ccomplex\nequality\u201d. According to Walzer, relevant reasons can only speak\nin favor of distributing specific types of goods in specific spheres,\nnot in several or all spheres. Against a theory of simple equality\npromoting equal distribution of dominant goods, which underestimates\nthe complexity of the criteria at work in each given sphere, the\ndominance of particular goods needs to be ended. For instance,\npurchasing power in the political sphere through means derived from\nthe economic sphere (i.e., money) must be prevented. Walzer\u2019s theory\nof complex equality is not actually aimed at equality per se, but at\nthe separation of spheres of justice; the theory\u2019s designation is\nmisleading. Any theory of equality should, however, as per Walzer,\navoid monistic conceptions and recognize instead the complexity of\nlife and the plurality of criteria for justice.\n\nThe preceding considerations yield the following desideratum: instead\nof simple equality, a more complex equality needs to\nbe conceptualized. That concept should resolve the problems discussed\nabove through a distinction of various classes of goods, a separation\nof spheres, and a differentiation of relevant criteria.\n3.2 Libertarianism\n\nLibertarianism and economic liberalism represent\nminimalist positions in relation to distributive justice. Citing\nLocke, they both postulate an original right to freedom and property,\nthus arguing against redistribution and social rights and for the free\nmarket (Nozick 1974; Hayek 1960). They assert an opposition between\nequality and freedom: the individual (natural) right to freedom can be\nlimited only for the sake of foreign and domestic peace. For this\nreason, libertarians consider maintaining public order the state\u2019s\nonly legitimate duty. They assert a natural right to self-ownership\n(the philosophical term for \u201cownership of oneself\u201d \u2013\ni.e., one\u2019s will, body, work, etc.) that entitles everybody to\nhitherto unowned bits of the external world by means of mixing their\nlabor with it. All individuals can thus claim property if\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d is left over for others (Locke\u2019s\nproviso). Correspondingly, they defend market freedoms and oppose the\nuse of redistributive taxation schemes for the sake of egalitarian\nsocial justice. A principal objection to libertarian theory is that\nits interpretation of the Lockean proviso \u2013 nobody\u2019s situation\nshould be worsened through an initial acquisition of property \u2013\nleads to an excessively weak requirement and is thus unacceptable\n(Kymlicka 1990, pp.108\u2013117). However, with a broader and more adequate\ninterpretation of what it means for one a situation to be worse than\nanother, it is much more difficult to justify private appropriation\nand, a fortiori, all further ownership rights. If the proviso\nrecognizes the full range of interests and alternatives that\nself-owners have, then it will not generate unrestricted rights over\nunequal amounts of resources. Another objection is that precisely if\none\u2019s own free accomplishment is what is meant to count, as the\nlibertarians argue, success should not depend strictly on luck,\nextraordinary natural gifts, inherited property, and status. In other\nwords, equal opportunity also needs to at least be present as\na counterbalance, ensuring that the fate of human beings is determined\nby their decisions and not by unavoidable social circumstances. Equal\nopportunity thus seems to be the frequently vague minimal formula at\nwork in every egalitarian conception of distributive justice. Many\negalitarians, however, wish for more \u2013 namely, an equality\nof (at least basic) life conditions.\n\nIn any event, with a shift away from a strictly negative idea of\nfreedom, economic liberalism can indeed itself point the way to more\nsocial and economic equality. For with such a shift, what is at stake\nis not only assuring an equal right to self-defense, but also\nfurnishing everyone more or less the same chance to actually make use\nof the right to freedom (e.g. Van Parijs 1995, Steiner 1994, Otsuka\n2005). In other words, certain basic goods need to be furnished to\nassure the equitable or \u201cfair value of the basic\nliberties\u201d (Rawls 1993, pp. 356\u201363).\n3.3 Utilitarianism\n\nIt is possible to interpret utilitarianism as concretizing moral\nequality \u2013 and this in a way meant to offer the same\nconsideration to the interests of all human beings (Kymlicka 1990, pp.\n31f., Hare 1981, p. 26, Sen 1992, pp. 13f.). From the utilitarian\nperspective, since everyone counts as one and no one as more than one\n(Bentham), the interests of all should be treated equally without\nconsideration of contents of interest or an individual\u2019s material\nsituation. For utilitarianism, this means that all enlightened\npersonal interests have to be fairly aggregated. The morally proper\naction is the one that maximizes utility (Hare 1984). This conception\nof equal treatment has been criticized as inadequate by many opponents\nof utilitarianism. At least in utilitarianism\u2019s classical form \u2013\nso the critique reads \u2013 the hoped for moral equality is flawed,\nbecause all desires are taken up by the utilitarian calculation,\nincluding \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d preferences\n(Dworkin 1977, p. 234) that are meant to all have equal weight, even\nwhen they diminish the \u2018rights\u2019 and intentions of others.\nThis conflicts with our everyday understanding of equal treatment.\nWhat is here at play is an argument involving \u201coffensive\u201d\nand \u201cexpensive\u201d taste: a person cannot expect others to\nsustain his or her desires at the expense of their own (Kymlicka 1990,\np. 40 f.). Rather, according to generally shared conviction, equal\ntreatment consistently requires a basis of equal rights and resources\nthat cannot be taken away from one person, whatever the desire of\nothers. In line with Rawls (1971, pp. 31, 564, cf. 450), many hold\nthat justice entails according no value to interests insofar as they\nconflict with justice. According to this view, unjustified preferences\nwill not distort the mutual claims people have on each other. Equal\ntreatment has to consist of everyone being able to claim a fair\nportion, and not in all interests having the same weight in disposal\nover my portion. Utilitarians cannot admit any restrictions on\ninterests based on morals or justice. As long as utilitarian theory\nlacks a concept of justice and fair allocation, it must fail in its\ngoal of treating everyone as equals. As Rawls (1971, pp. 27) also\nfamously argues, utilitarianism that involves neglecting the\nseparateness of persons does not contain a proper interpretation of\nmoral equality as equal respect for each individual.\n3.4 Equality of Welfare\n\nThe concept of welfare equality is motivated by an intuition that when\nit comes to political ethics, what is at stake is individual\nwell-being. The central criterion for justice must consequently be\nequalizing the level of welfare. But taking welfare as what is to be\nequalized leads to difficulties resembling those of utilitarianism. If\none contentiously identifies subjective welfare with preference\nsatisfaction, it seems implausible to count all individual preferences\nas equal, some \u2013 such as the desire to do others wrong \u2013\nbeing inadmissible on grounds of justice (the offensive taste\nargument). Any welfare-centered concept of equality grants people with\nrefined and expensive taste more resources \u2013 something\ndistinctly at odds with our moral intuitions (the expensive taste\nargument) (Dworkin 1981a). However, satisfaction in the fulfillment of\ndesires cannot serve as a standard, since we wish for more than a\nsimple feeling of happiness. A more viable standard for welfare\ncomparisons would seem to be success in the fulfillment of\npreferences. A fair evaluation of such success cannot be purely\nsubjective, but requires a standard of what should or could have been\nachieved. This itself involves an assumption regarding just\ndistribution, so it cannot stand as an independent criterion for\njustice. Another serious problem with any welfare-centered concept of\nequality is that it cannot take account of either desert (Feinberg\n1970) or personal responsibility for one\u2019s own well-being, to the\nextent this is possible and reasonable.\n3.5 Equality of Resources\n\nRepresented above all by both Rawls and Dworkin, resource equality\navoids such problems (Rawls 1971; Dworkin 1981b). It holds individuals\nresponsible for their decisions and actions, but not for circumstances\nbeyond their control, such as race, sex, skin-color, intelligence, and\nsocial position, thus excluding these as distributive criteria. Equal\nopportunity is insufficient because it does not compensate for unequal\ninnate gifts. What applies for social circumstances should also apply\nfor such gifts, as both are purely arbitrary from a moral point of\nview.\n\nAccording to Rawls, human beings should have the same initial\nexpectations of \u201cbasic goods,\u201d i.e., all-purpose goods;\nthis in no way precludes ending up with different quantities of such\ngoods or resources, as a result of personal economic decisions and\nactions. When prime importance is accorded an assurance of equal basic\nfreedoms and rights, inequalities are just when they fulfill two\nprovisos: on the one hand, they have to be linked to offices and\npositions open to everyone under conditions of fair equality of\nopportunity; on the other hand, they have to reflect the famous\n\u2018difference principle\u2019 in offering the greatest possible\nadvantage to the least advantaged members of society (Rawls 1993, p. 5\nf.; 1971, \u00a7 13). Otherwise, the economic order requires revision.\nDue to the argument of the moral arbitrariness of talents, the\ncommonly accepted criteria for merit (like productivity, working\nhours, effort) are clearly relativized. The difference principle only\nallows the talented to earn more to the extent this raises the lowest\nincomes. According to Rawls, with regard to the basic structure of\nsociety, the difference principle should be opted for under a\nself-chosen \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d regarding personal and\nhistorical circumstances and similar factors: the principle offers a\ngeneral assurance of not totally succumbing to the hazards of a free\nmarket situation; and everyone does better than with inevitably\ninefficient total equal distribution, whose level of well-being is\nbelow that of those worst off under the difference principle.\n\nSince Rawls\u2019 Theory of Justice is the classical focal point\nof present-day political philosophy, it is worth noting the different\nways his theory claims to be egalitarian. First, Rawls upholds a\nnatural basis for equal human worth: a minimal capacity for having a\nconception of the good and a sense of justice. Second, through the\ndevice of the \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d people are conceived as\nequals in the \u201coriginal position.\u201d Third, the idea of\nsharing this \u201coriginal position\u201d presupposes the parties\nhaving political equality, as equal participants in the process of\nchoosing the principles by which they would be governed. Fourth, Rawls\nproposes fair equality of opportunity. Fifth, he maintains that all\ndesert must be institutionally defined, depending on the goals of the\nsociety. No one deserves his or her talents or circumstances, which\nare products of the natural lottery. Finally, the difference principle\ntends toward equalizing holdings. However, it is important to keep in\nmind, as Scheffler (2003) has pointed out, that the main focus of\nRawls\u2019 theory is justice as such; it is only secondarily about an\negalitarian conception of justice. In addition, since the primary\nsubject is the basic structure, pure procedural justice has priority\nover distributive or allocative justice Equality is not the only or\nsingle value for Rawls.\n\nDworkin\u2019s equality of resources (1981b), on the other hand, is\nconcerned with equality as such. His theory stakes a claim to being\neven more \u2018ambition- and endowment-insensitive\u2019 than\nRawls\u2019 theory. Unequal distribution of resources is considered fair\nonly when it results from the decisions and intentional actions of\nthose concerned. Dworkin proposes a hypothetical auction in which\neveryone can accumulate bundles of resources through equal means of\npayment, so that in the end no one is jealous of another\u2019s bundle (the\nenvy test). The auction-procedure also offers a way to precisely\nmeasure equality of resources: the measure of resources devoted to a\nperson\u2019s life is defined by the importance of the resources to others\n(Dworkin 1981b, p. 290). In the free market, how the distribution then\ndevelops depends on an individual\u2019s ambitions. The inequalities that\nthus emerge are justified, since one has to take responsibility for\nhow one\u2019s choices turn out (i.e., one\u2019s \u201coption luck\u201d) in\nthe realm of personal responsibility. In contrast, unjustified\ninequalities based on different innate provisions and gifts, as well\nas on brute luck, should be compensated for through a fictive\ndifferentiated insurance system: its premiums are established behind\nDworkin\u2019s own \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d in order to then be\ndistributed in real life to everyone and collected in taxes. For\nDworkin, this is the key to the natural lottery being balanced fairly,\npreventing a \u201cslavery of the talented\u201d through excessive\nredistribution.\n3.6 Responsibility and Luck-Egalitarianism\n\nOnly some egalitarians hold inequality to be bad per se. Most of\ntoday\u2019s egalitarians are pluralistic, recognizing other values besides\nequality. So called luck-egalitarians regard the moral significance of\nchoice and responsibility as one of the most important values besides\nequality (for an overview over the debate see Lippert-Rasmussen 2015).\nThey hold that it is bad \u2013 unjust or unfair \u2013 for some to\nbe worse off than others through no fault or choice of their own\n(Temkin 1993, 13) and therefore strive to eliminate involuntary\ndisadvantages, for which the sufferer cannot be held responsible\n(Cohen 1989, 916).\n\nThe principle of responsibility provides a central normative vantage\npoint for deciding on which grounds one might justify which\ninequality. The positive formulation of the responsibility\nprinciple requires an assumption of personal responsibility and holds\nthat inequalities which are the result of self-chosen options are\njust. (See above all Dworkin, 1981b, p. 311; contra: Anderson, 1999.)\nUnequal portions of social goods are thus fair when they result from\nthe decisions and intentional actions of those concerned. Individuals\nmust accept responsibility for the costs of their decisions. Persons\nare themselves responsible for certain inequalities that result from\ntheir voluntary decisions, and they deserve no compensation for such\ninequalities, aside from minimal provisions in cases of dire need (see\nbelow). In its negative formulation, the responsibility\nprinciple holds that inequalities which are not the result of\nself-chosen options are to be rejected as unjust; persons\ndisadvantaged in this way deserve compensation. That which one can do\nnothing about, or for which one is not responsible, cannot constitute\na relevant criterion. Still, the initial assumption remains an\nascription of responsibility, and each individual case requires close\nscrutiny: one is responsible and accountable unless there is an\nadequate reason for being considered otherwise (but cf. Stemplowska\n2013 for a different interpretation)..\n\nIf advantages or disadvantages that are due to arbitrary and unearned\ndifferences are unfair, this holds for social circumstances as well as\nnatural endowments. The reasons favoring an exclusion of features like\nskin-color, size, sex, and place of origin as primarily discriminative\napply equally to other natural human qualities, like intelligence,\nappearance, physical strength, and so forth. The kind and the extent\nof one\u2019s natural abilities are due to a lottery of nature; considered\nfrom a moral standpoint, their distribution is purely arbitrary\n(Rawls, 1971, \u00a7 48). To sum up: natural and social endowment must\nnot count, and personal intentions and voluntary decisions should\ncount. Thus, a given social order is just when it equalizes as much as\npossible, and in a normatively tenable way, all personal disadvantages\nfor which an individual is not responsible, and accords individuals\nthe capacity to bear the consequences of their decisions and actions,\nas befits their capacity for autonomy.\n\nObjections to all versions of \u201cbrute-luck egalitarianism\u201d\ncome from two sides. Some authors criticize its in their view\nunjustified or excessively radical rejection of merit: The\nluck-egalitarian thesis of desert only being justifiably acknowledged\nif it involves desert \u201call the way down\u201d (Nozick 1974, p.\n225) not only destroys the classical, everyday principle of desert,\nsince everything has a basis that we ourselves have not created. In\nthe eyes of such critics, along with the merit-principle this argument\nalso destroys our personal identity, since we can no longer accredit\nourselves with our own capacities and accomplishments. (Cf. the texts\nin Pojman & McLeod 1998, Olsaretti 2003.) Other authors consider\nthe criterion for responsibility to be too strong, indeed inhuman (or\n\u201charsh\u201d) in its consequences, since human beings\nresponsible for their own misery would (supposedly) be left alone with\ntheir misery (Anderson 1999, also MacLeod 1998, Scheffler 2003, Wolff\n1998, Fleurbaey 1995, Voigt 2007, Eyal 2017, Olsaretti 2009,\nStemplowska 2009). However, pluralistic egalitarians should be able\nto argue that there are special cases, in which people are so badly\noff that they should be helped, even if they got into the miserable\nsituation through their own fault. But even when people are in\nterrible situations, which did not arise through their own fault\n(\u2018bad brute luck\u2019) \u2013 for instance, when they are\ndisabled from birth \u2013 and egalitarians therefore have reasons to\nhelp them, these reasons are supposedly stigmatizing, since in these\ncases the principles of distribution would be based on pity. In these\ncases, political institutions have to take certain decisions \u2013\nfor example, in which category a particular case of distress should be\nplaced \u2013 and gather relevant information on their\ncitizens. Against such a procedure, one could object that it subjects\nthe citizens to the tutelage of the state and harms their private\nsphere (Anderson 1999, also Hayek 1960: 85\u2013102).\n3.7 Equality of Opportunity for Welfare or Advantage\n\nApproaches based on equality of opportunity can be read as revisions\nof both welfarism and resourcism. Ranged against welfarism and\ndesigned to avoid its pitfalls, they incorporate the powerful ideas of\nchoice and responsibility into various, improved forms of\negalitarianism. Such approaches are meant to equalize outcomes\nresulting from causes beyond a person\u2019s control (i.e., beyond\ncircumstances or endowment), but to allow differential outcomes that\nresult from autonomous choice or ambition. But the approaches are also\naimed at maintaining the insight that individual preferences have to\ncount, as the sole basis for a necessary linkage back to the\nindividual perspective: otherwise, there is an overlooking of the\nperson\u2019s value. In Arneson\u2019s (1989, 1990) concept of equal\nopportunity for welfare, the preferences determining the measure\nof individual well-being are meant to be conceived hypothetically\n\u2013 i.e., a person would decide on them after a process of ideal\nreflection. In order to correspond to the morally central vantage of\npersonal responsibility, what should be equalized are not enlightened\npreferences themselves, but rather real opportunities to achieve or\nreceive a good, to the extent that it is aspired to. G.A. Cohen\u2019s\n(1989, p. 916 f.) broader conception of equality of access to\nadvantage attempts to integrate the perspectives of welfare\nequality and resource equality through the overriding concept of\nadvantage. For Cohen, there are two grounds for egalitarian\ncompensation. Egalitarians will be moved to furnish a paralyzed person\nwith a compensatory wheelchair independently of the person\u2019s welfare\nlevel. This egalitarian response to disability overrides equality of\n(opportunity to) welfare. Egalitarians also favor compensation for\nphenomena such as pain, independent of any loss of capacity \u2013\nfor instance by paying for expensive medicine. But, Cohen claims, any\njustification for such compensation has to invoke the idea of equality\nof opportunity to welfare. He thus views both aspects, resources and\nwelfare, as necessary and irreducible. Much of Roemer\u2019s (1998) more\ntechnical argument is devoted to constructing the scale to calibrate\nthe extent to which something is the result of circumstances. An\nincurred adverse consequence is the result of circumstances, not\nchoice, precisely to the extent that it is a consequence that persons\nof one or another specific type can be expected to incur.\n3.8 Capabilities Approaches\n\nTheories that limit themselves to the equal distribution of basic\nmeans, in the hope of doing justice to the different goals of all\nhuman beings, are often criticized as fetishistic, because they focus\non means as opposed to what individuals gain with these means (Sen\n1980). The value that goods have for someone depends on objective\npossibilities, the natural environment, and individual capacities.\nHence, in contrast to the resourcist approach, Amartya Sen proposes\norientating distribution around \u201ccapabilities to achieve\nfunctionings,\u201d i.e., the various things that a person manages to\ndo orbe in leading a life (Sen 1992). In other words, evaluating\nindividual well-being has to be tied to a capability for achieving and\nmaintaining various precious conditions and \u201cfunctionings\u201d\nconstitutive of a person\u2019s being, such as adequate nourishment, good\nhealth, the ability to move about freely or to appear in public\nwithout shame. The real freedom to acquire well-being is also\nimportant here, a freedom represented in the capability to oneself\nchoose forms of achievement and the combination of\n\u201cfunctionings.\u201d For Sen, capabilities are thus the measure\nof an equality of capabilities human beings enjoy to lead\ntheir lives. A problem consistently raised with capability approaches\nis the ability to weigh capabilities in order to arrive at a metric\nfor equality. The problem is intensified by the fact that various\nmoral perspectives are blended in the concept of capability (Cohen\n1993, p. 17\u201326, Williams 1987). Martha Nussbaum (1992, 2000) has\nlinked the capability approach to an Aristotelian, essentialistic,\n\u201cthick\u201d theory of the good \u2013 a theory meant to be,\nas she puts it, \u201cvague,\u201d incomplete, and open-ended enough\nto leave place for individual and cultural variation. On the basis of\nsuch a \u201cthick\u201d conception of necessary and universal\nelements of a good life, certain capabilities and functionings can be\ndesignated as foundational. In this manner, Nussbaum can endow the\ncapability approach with a precision that furnishes an index of\ninterpersonal comparison, but at the risk of not being neutral enough\nregarding the plurality of personal conceptions of the good, a\nneutrality normally required by most liberals (most importantly Rawls\n1993; but see Robeyns 2009 for a different take on the comparison with\nRawls). For further discussion, see the entry on the\n capability approach.\n4. Relational Equality\n\nSince the late 1990s, social relations egalitarianism has appeared in\nphilosophical discourse as an increasingly important competitor to\ndistribuitivist accounts of justice, especially its luck egalitarian\nversions (cf. Lippert-Rassmussen 2018). Proponents of social relations\negalitarianism include Anderson (1999), Miller (1997), Scanlon (1996,\n2018), Scheffler (2003, 2005, 2015), Wolff (1998, 2010) and Young\n(1990). Negatively, they are united in a rejection of the view that\njustice is a matter of eliminating differential luck. Positively, they\nclaim that society is just if, and only if, individuals within it\nrelate to one another as equals. Accordingly, the site of justice\n(i.e. that to which principles of justice apply) is society, not\ndistributions. Relational Egalitarianism has a certain overlap with\nmany theories of recognition and non-domination. Certain status\ndifferences are at the core of their objections, like those\nstigmatizing differences in status, whereby the badly off are caused\nto experience themselves as inferior, and are treated as inferiors, or\nwhen inequalities create objectionable relations of\npower(Honneth/Fraser 2003) and domination (Pettit 2001).\n\nWhat does it mean that (and when do) individuals within a society\nrelate to one another as equals? Racial discrimination, for example,\nis a paradigmatic instance of this condition?s violation. But once we\nmove beyond a handful of such examples things become much less\nclear.\n\nThese claims to social and political equality exclude all unequal,\nhierarchical forms of social relationships, in which some people\ndominate, exploit, marginalize, demean, and inflict violence upon\nothers:\n\nAs a social ideal, it holds that a human society must be conceived of\nas a cooperative arrangement among equals, each of whom enjoys the\nsame social standing. As a political ideal, it highlights the claims\nthat citizens are entitled to make on one another by virtue of their\nstatus as citizens, without any need for a moralized accounting of the\ndetails of their particular circumstances. (Scheffler 2003, p. 22)\n\n\nHowever, forms of differentiation that do not violate moral equality\n(see above) are not per se excluded from social equality, if they are\ncompatible with the recognition of the equal social status of\nconcerned parties, as with differences relating to merit, need, and,\nif appropriate, race, gender, and social background (as in cases of\naffirmative action or fair punishment).\n\nWhere there is social equality, people feel that each member of the\ncommunity enjoys an equal standing with all the rest that overrides\ntheir unequal ratings along particular dimensions. (Miller, 1997, p.\n232)\n\n\nThus the question has to be answered whether \u2013 and if so, why\n\u2013 other dimensions, such as a person\u2019s natural talents,\ncreativity, intelligence, innovative skills or entrepreneurial\nability, can be the basis for legitimate inequalities.\n\nRelational egalitarians need a certain conception of what an equal\nstanding in society amounts to and implies in terms of rights and\ngoods. One way to offer such an account would be to rely (like\nAnderson 1999) on the capabilities approach (\u00a73.8) and\nsufficitarianism (\u00a76.2.): In a democratic community that\npreserves the free and equal status of persons, at least three sets of\nconditions have to be fulfilled.\n\nFirst, certain political conditions are necessary to allow citizens to\nparticipate as equals in democratic deliberation. These include, among\nothers, the capabilities to vote, hold office, assemble, petition the\ngovernment, speak freely, and move about freely (Rawls 1999, p.53).\nThe principle of democratic equality (as asked for by Anderson 1999)\nrequires us to eliminate social hierarchies that prevent a\ndemocratically organized society, a society in which we cooperate and\ndecide upon state action as equals. Persons morally owe each other the\ncapabilities and conditions to live as equals in a democratic\ncommunity (Christiano 2008, Kolodny 2014). Democracy can be\ninterpreted as realizing public equality in collective\ndecision-making.\n\nSecond, to participate as an equal in civil society, certain civil\nconditions must obtain. These include the conditions that make it\nrobustly likely that injustices such as marginalization,\npowerlessness, cultural imperialism (Anderson 1999 with reference to\nYoung 1990), or domination (Pettit 2001) can be to avoided. Third,\ncertain social conditions and personal capabilities have to obtain\nthat enable people to enjoy equal standing in society. Citizens need,\nin this regard, adequate nutrition, shelter, clothing, education, and\nmedical care. This last point leads into the debate over whether a\nrelational egalitarian conception of social justice yields intrinsic\nand instrumental reasons of justice to care about distributive\ninequality in socially produced goods, despite its emphasis on just\nsocial relationships and not the distribution of goods per se\n(Schemmel 2011, Elford 2017).\n5. Equality Among Whom?\n\nJustice is primarily related to individual actions. Individual persons\nare the primary bearers of responsibility (the key principle of\nethical individualism). This raises two controversial issues in the\ncontemporary debate.\n\nOne could regard the norms of distributive equality as applying to\ngroups rather than individuals. It is often groups that rightfully\nraise the issue of an inequality between themselves and the rest of\nsociety, as with women and racial and ethnic groups. The question\narises of whether inequality among such groups should be considered\nmorally objectionable in itself, or whether even in the case of\ngroups, the underlying concern should be how individuals (as members\nof such groups) fare in comparative terms. If there is a worry about\ninequalities between groups of individuals, why does this not\ntranslate into a worry about inequalities between members of the\ngroup?\n\nA further question concerns whether the norms of distributive equality\n(whatever they are) apply to all individuals, regardless of where (and\nwhen) they live. Or rather, do they only hold for members of\ncommunities within states and nations? Most theories of equality deal\nexclusively with distributive equality among people in a single\nsociety. There does not, however, seem to be any rationale for that\nlimitation. Can the group of the entitled be restricted prior to the\nexamination of concrete claims? Many theories seem to imply this,\nespecially when they connect distributive justice or the goods to be\ndistributed with social cooperation or production. For those who\ncontribute nothing to cooperation, such as the disabled, children, or\nfuture generations, would have to be denied a claim to a fair share.\nThe circle of persons who are to be the recipients of distribution\nwould thus be restricted from the outset. Other theories are less\nrestrictive, insofar as they do not link distribution to actual social\ncollaboration, yet nonetheless do restrict it, insofar as they bind it\nto the status of citizenship. In this view, distributive justice is\nlimited to the individuals within a society. Those outside the\ncommunity have no entitlement to social justice. Unequal distribution\namong states and the social situations of people outside the\nparticular society could not, in this view, be a problem of social\ndistributive justice (Nagel 2005). Yet here too, the universal\nmorality of equal respect and the principle of equal distribution\ndemand that all persons consider one another as prima facie equally\nentitled to the goods, unless reasons for an unequal distribution can\nbe advanced. It may be that in the process of justification, reasons\nwill emerge for privileging those who were particularly involved in\nthe production of a good, but there is no prima facie reason to\nexclude from the outset other persons, such as those from other\ncountries, from the process of distribution and justification (Pogge\n2002). That may seem most intuitively plausible in the case of natural\nresources (e.g. oil) that someone discovers by chance on or beneath\nthe surface of his or her property. Why should such resources belong\nto the person who discovers them, or on whose property they are\nlocated? Nevertheless, in the eyes of many if not most people, global\njustice, i.e., extending egalitarian distributive justice globally,\ndemands too much from individuals and their states (Miller 1998; but\ncf. Caney 2005). Alternatively, one might argue that there are other\n\u2018special relations\u2019 between members of one society that do\nnot exist between members of different societies. Nationalism is an\nexample for such a (controversial) thesis that may provide a case for\na kind of local equality (Miller 1995). For further discussion,\nsee the entry on \n global justice.\n\nAnother issue is the relationship between generations. Does the\npresent generation have an egalitarian obligation towards future\ngenerations regarding equal living conditions? One argument in favor\nof this conclusion might be that people should not end up unequally\nwell off as a result of morally arbitrary factors. However, the issue\nof justice between generation is notoriously complex (Temkin\n1992). For further discussion, see the entry on \n intergenerational justice.\n6. The Value of Equality: Why Equality?\n\nDoes equality play a major role in a theory of justice, and if so,\nwhat is this role? A conception of justice is egalitarian\nwhen it views equality as a fundamental goal of justice. Temkin has\nput it as follows:\n\n\u2026 an egalitarian is any person who attaches some value\nto equality itself (that is, any person that cares at\nall about equality, over and above the extent it promotes other\nideals). So, equality needn\u2019t be the only value, or even the ideal she\nvalues most\u2026\u2009. Egalitarians have the deep and (for them)\ncompelling view that it is a bad thing \u2013 unjust and unfair\n\u2013 for some to be worse off than others through no fault of their\nown. (Temkin 1986, p. 100, cf. 1993, p. 7)\n\n\nIn general, the focus of the modern egalitarian effort to realize\nequality is on the possibility of a good life, i.e., on an equality of\nlife prospects and life circumstances \u2013 interpreted in various\nways according to various positions in the \u201cequality of\nwhat\u201d debate (see above).\n6.1. Kinds of Egalitarianism\n\nIt is apparent that there are three sorts of egalitarianism: intrinsic,\ninstrumental and constitutive. (For a twofold distinction cf. Parfit\n1997, Temkin 1993, p. 11, McKerlie, 1996, p. 275.)\n\nIntrinsic egalitarians view equality as a good in itself. As\npure egalitarians, they are concerned solely with equality, most of\nthem with equality of social circumstances, according to which it is\nintrinsically bad if some people are worse off than others through no\nfault of their own. But it is in fact the case that people do not\nalways consider inequality a moral evil. Intrinsic egalitarians\nregarde quality as desirable even when the equalization would be of no\nuse to any of the affected parties, such as when equality can only be\nproduced through depressing the level of well being of everyone\u2019s\nlife. But something can only have an intrinsic value when it is good\nfor at least one person, when it makes one life better in some way or\nanother.\n\nThe following \u201cleveling-down\u201d objection indicates\nthat doing away within equality in fact ought to produce better\ncircumstances; it is otherwise unclear why equality should be desired.\n(For such an objection, cf. Nozick 1974, p. 229, Raz 1986, chap. 9, p.\n227, 235, Temkin 1993, pp. 247\u20138.) Sometimes inequality can only be\nended by depriving those who are better off of their resources,\nrendering them as poorly off as everyone else. (For anyone looking for\na drastic literary example, Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s 1950 science-fiction story\nHarrison Bergeron is recommended.) This would have to be an\nacceptable approach according to the intrinsic conception. But would\nit be morally good if, in a group consisting of both blind and sighted\npersons, those with sight were rendered blind because the blind could\nnot be offered sight? That would be morally perverse. Doing away with\ninequality by bringing everyone down contains \u2013 so the objection\ngoes \u2013 nothing good. Such leveling-down objections would of\ncourse only be valid if there were indeed no better and equally\negalitarian alternatives available, but there are nearly always such\nalternatives: e.g. those who can see should have to help the blind,\nfinancially or otherwise. When there are no alternatives, in order to\navoid such objections, intrinsic egalitarianism cannot be strict, but\nneeds to be pluralistic. Then intrinsic egalitarians could\nsay there is something good about the change, namely greater equality,\nalthough they would concede that much is bad about it. Pluralistic\negalitarians do not have equality as their only goal; they also admit\nother values and principles, above all the principle of welfare,\naccording to which it is better when people are doing better. In\naddition, pluralistic egalitarianism should be moderate\nenough to not always grant equality victory in the case of conflict\nbetween equality and welfare. Instead, they must accept reductions in\nequality for the sake of a higher quality of life for all (as with\nRawls\u2019 difference principle).\n\nAt present, many egalitarians are ready to concede that equality in\nthe sense of equality of life circumstances has no compelling value in\nitself, but that, in a framework of liberal concepts of justice, its\nmeaning emerges in pursuit of other ideals, like universal freedom,\nthe full development of human capacities and the human personality,\nthe mitigation of suffering and defeat of domination and\nstigmatization, the stable coherence of modern and freely constituted\nsocieties, and so forth (Scanlon 1996, 2018). For those who are worse\noff, unequal circumstances often mean considerable (relative)\ndisadvantages and many (absolute) evils; as a rule, these (relative)\ndisadvantages and (absolute) evils are the source of our moral\ncondemnation of unequal circumstances. But this does not mean that\ninequality as such is an evil. Hence, the argument goes, fundamental\nmoral ideals other than equality stand behind our aspiring for\nequality. To reject inequality on such grounds is to favor equality\neither as a byproduct or as a means, and not as a goal or intrinsic\nvalue. In its treatment of equality as a derived virtue, the sort of\negalitarianism \u2013 if the term is actually suitable \u2013 here\nat play is instrumental.\n\nAs indicated, there is also a third, more suitable approach to the\nequality ideal: a constitutive egalitarianism. According to\nthis approach, to the aspiration to equality is rooted in other moral\ngrounds, namely because certain inequalities are unjust. Equality has\nvalue, but this is an extrinsic value, since it derives from another,\nhigher moral principle of equal dignity and respect. But it is not\ninstrumental for this reason, i.e., it is not only valued on account\nof moral equality, but also on its own account. (For the distinction\nbetween the origin of a value and the kind of value it is, cf.\nKorsgaard 1996.) Equality stands in relation to justice as does a part\nto a whole. The requirement of justification is based on moral\nequality, and in certain contexts, successful justification leads to\nthe above-named principles of equality, i.e., formal, proportional\nequality and the presumption of equality. Thus, according to\nconstitutive egalitarianism, these principles and the resulting\nequality are required by justice, and by the same token constitute\nsocial justice.\n\nIt is important to further distinguish two levels of egalitarianism\nand non-egalitarianism, respectively. On a first level, a constitutive\negalitarian presumes that every explication of the moral standpoint is\nincomplete without terms such as \u2018equal,\u2019\n\u2018similarly,\u2019 etc. In contrast, a non-egalitarianism\noperating on the same level considers such terms misplaced or\nredundant. On a second level, when it comes to concretizing and\nspecifying conceptions of justice, a constitutive egalitarian gives\nequality substantive weight. On this level, more and less egalitarian\npositions can be found, according to the chosen currency of equality\n(the criteria by which just equality is measured) and according to the\nreasons for unequal distributions (exemptions of the presumption of\nequality) that the respective theories regard as well grounded.\nEgalitarianism on the second level thus relates to the kind, quality\nand quantity of things to be equalized. Because of such variables, a\nclear-cut definition of second level egalitarianism cannot be\nformulated. In contrast, non-egalitarians on this second level\nadvocate a non-relational entitlement theory of justice.\n6.2 Equality vs. Priority or Sufficiency\n\nAlongside the often-raised objections against equality mentioned in\nthe section on \u201csimple equality\u201d (3.1. above) there is a\ndifferent and more fundamental critique formulated by first level\nnon-egalitarians: that equality does not have a foundational role in\nthe grounding of claims to justice. While the older version of a\ncritique of egalitarianism comes mainly from the conservative end of\nthe political spectrum, thus arguing in general against\n\u201cpatterned principles of justice\u201d (Nozick 1974, esp. pp.\n156\u2013157), the critique\u2019s newer version also often can be heard in\nprogressive circles (Walzer 1983, Raz 1986, chap. 9, Frankfurt 1987,\n1997, Parfit 1997, Anderson 1999). This first-level critique of\nequality poses the basic question of why justice should in fact be\nconceived relationally and (what is here the same) comparatively.\nReferring back to Joel Feinberg\u2019s (1974) distinction between\ncomparative and non-comparative justice, non-egalitarians object to\nthe moral requirement to treat people as equals, and the many demands\nfor justice emerging from it. They argue that neither the postulate\nnor these demands involve comparative principles, let alone any\nequality principles. They reproach first-level egalitarians for a\nconfusion between \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cuniversals.\u201d\nAs the non-egalitarians see things, within many principles of justice\n\u2013 at least the especially important ones \u2013 the\nequality-terminology is redundant. Equality is thus merely a byproduct\nof the general fulfillment of actually non-comparative standards of\njustice: something obscured through the unnecessary insertion of an\nexpression of equality (Raz 1986, p. 227f.). At least the central\nstandards of dignified human life are not relational but\n\u201cabsolute.\u201d As Harry Frankfurt puts it: \u201cIt is\nwhether people have good lives, and not how their lives compare with\nthe lives of others\u201d (Frankfurt 1997, p. 6). And again:\n\u201cThe fundamental error of egalitarianism lies in supposing that\nit is morally important whether one person has less than another\nregardless of how much either of them has\u201d (Frankfurt 1987, p.\n34).\n\nFrom the non-egalitarian perspective, what is really at stake in\nhelping those worse off and improving their lot is humanitarian\nconcern, a desire to alleviate suffering. Such concern is not\nunderstood as egalitarian, as it is not focused on the difference\nbetween the better off and the worse off as such (whatever the applied\nstandard), but on improving the situation of the latter. Their\ndistress constitutes the actual moral foundation. The wealth of those\nbetter off only furnishes a means that has to be transferred for the\nsake of mitigating the distress, as long as other, morally negative\nconsequences do not emerge in the process. The strength of the impetus\nfor more equality lies in the urgency of the claims of those worse\noff, not in the extent of the inequality. For this reason, instead of\nequality the non-egalitarian critics favor one or another\nentitlement theory of justice, such as Nozick\u2019s (1974)\nlibertarianism (cf. 3.2. above) and Frankfurt\u2019s (1987) doctrine of\nsufficiency, according to which \u201cWhat is important from the\nmoral point of view is not that everyone should have the same\nbut that each should have enough. If everyone had enough, it\nwould be of no moral consequence whether some had more than\nothers\u201d (Frankfurt 1987, p. 21).\n\nParfit\u2019s (1997) priority view accordingly calls for a focus\non improving the situation of society\u2019s weaker and poorer members, and\nindeed all the more urgently the worse off they are, even if they can\nbe less helped than others in the process. Parfit (1995) distinguishes\nbetween egalitarianism and prioritarianism. According to\nprioritarians, benefiting people is more important the worse off those\npeople are. This prioritising will often increase equality, but they\nare two distinct values, since in an important respect equality is a\nrelational value while priority is not. However, egalitarians and\nprioritarians share an important feature, in that both hold that the\nbest possible distribution of a fixed sum of goods is an equal one. It\nis thus a matter of debate whether prioritarianism is a sort of\negalitarianism or a (decent) inegalitarianism. In any case,\nentitlement-based non-egalitarian arguments can practically result in\nan equality of outcome as far-reaching as egalitarian theories. Hence\nthe fulfillment of an absolute or non-comparative standard for\neveryone (e.g. to the effect that nobody should starve) frequently\nresults in a certain equality of outcome, where such a standard\ncomprises not only a decent but a good life. Consequently, the debate\nhere centers on the basis \u2013 is it equality or something else?\n\u2013 and not so much on the outcome \u2013 are persons or groups\nmore or less equal, according to a chosen metric? Possibly, the\ndifference lies even deeper, in their respective conceptions of\nmorality in general.\n\nEgalitarians can respond to the anti-egalitarian critique by conceding\nthat it is the nature of some (however certainly far from all)\nessential norms of morality and justice to be concerned primarily with\nthe adequate fulfillment of the separate claims of individuals.\nHowever, whether a claim can itself be considered suitable can be\nascertained only by asking whether it can be agreed on by all those\naffected in hypothetical conditions of freedom and equality. (See,\ne.g., Casal 2007 for a deeper discussion and critique of the doctrine\nof sufficiency.) This justificatory procedure is more necessary if it\nis less evident that what is at stake is actually suffering, distress,\nor an objective need. In the view of the constitutive egalitarians,\nall the judgments of distributive justice should be approached\nrelationally, by asking which distributive scheme all concerned\nparties can universally and reciprocally agree to. As described at\nsome length in the pertinent section above, many egalitarians argue\nthat a presumption in favor of equality follows from this\njustification requirement. In the eyes of such egalitarians, this is\nall one needs for the justification and determination of the\nconstitutive value of equality.\n\nSecondly, even if \u2013 for the sake of argument \u2013 the\nquestion is left open as to whether demands for distribution according\nto objective needs (e.g. alleviating hunger) involve non-comparative\nentitlement-claims, it is nonetheless always necessary to resolve the\nquestion of what needy individuals are owed. And this is tied in a\nbasic way to the question of what persons owe one another in\ncomparable or worse situations, and how scarce resources (money,\ngoods, time, energy) must be invested in light of the sum total of our\nobligations. While the claim on our aid may well appear\nnon-relational, determining the kind and extent of the aid must always\nbe relational, at least in circumstances of scarcity (and resources\nare always scarce). Claims are either \u201csatiable\u201d (Raz\n1986, p. 235) \u2013 i.e., an upper limit or sufficiency level can be\nindicated, after which each person\u2019s claim to X has been fulfilled\n\u2013 or they are not. For insatiable claims, to stipulate any level\nat which one is or ought to be sufficiently satisfied is arbitrary. If\nthe standards of sufficiency are defined as a bare minimum, why should\npersons be content with that minimum? Why should the manner in which\nwelfare and resources are distributed above the poverty level not also\nbe a question of justice? If, by contrast, we are concerned solely\nwith claims that are in principle \u201csatiable,\u201d such claims\nhaving a reasonable definition of sufficiency, then these standards of\nsufficiency will most likely be very high. In Frankfurt\u2019s definition,\nfor example, sufficiency is reached only when persons are satisfied\nand no longer actively strive for more. Since people find themselves\nourselves operating, in practice, in circumstances far beneath such a\nhigh sufficiency level, they (of course) live under conditions of\n(moderate) scarcity. Then the above mentioned argument holds as well\n\u2013 namely, that in order to determine to what extent it is to be\nfulfilled, each claim has to be judged in relation to the claims of\nall others and all available resources. In addition, the moral urgency\nof lifting people above dire poverty cannot be invoked to demonstrate\nthe moral urgency of everyone having enough. In both forms of scarcity\n\u2013 i.e., with satiable and insatiable claims \u2013 the social\nright or claim to goods cannot be conceived as something absolute or\nnon-comparative. Egalitarians may thus conclude that distributive\njustice is always comparative. This would suggest that distributive\nequality, especially equality of life-conditions, should play a\nfundamental role in any adequate theory of justice in particular, and\nof morality in general.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albernethy, Georg L.
