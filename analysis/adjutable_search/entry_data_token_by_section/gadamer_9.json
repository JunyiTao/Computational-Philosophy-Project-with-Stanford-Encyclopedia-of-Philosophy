    "main_text": "Literature and Art\n6. Practical Philosophy\n\nThere is, according to Gadamer, a continuity between a hermeneutics\n\u2018that is aware of its philosophic implications\u2019 and \u2018the great\ntradition of practical philosophy\u2019 (Gadamer, 2007, p.245), and such a\nclaim would already seem to be implicit in the idea that\ninterpretation and application are tied together through the\nembeddedness of interpretation in the hermeneutical situation. Gadamer\nhas himself engaged, however, in direct reflection on a range of\nconcrete contemporary issues (see Gadamer 1976a, 1989a, 1993b, 1998b,\n1999, 2001, see also Krajewski 2003). Gadamer\u2019s discussion of\nthese issues draws directly upon his more theoretical discussions of\nhermeneutics elsewhere, sometimes serving to provide further\nelaboration and illumination of the ideas at work in those\ndiscussions. A central concern in many of Gadamer\u2019s essays is\nthe role of Europe, and European culture, in the contemporary\nworld\u2014something that was especially pressing for Gadamer with\nthe advent of German reunification and the expansion of the European\ncommunity (see especially Gadamer 1989a). Here, however, a number of\nother closely connected issues also come into view: the nature and\nrole of modern science and technology (see especially 1976a, 1998b),\nand together with this, the role of the humanities; the question of\neducation and, in particular, of humanistic education (1992); the\nissue of understanding between cultures, and especially between\nreligions, and the issue of world literature (see especially George\n2020).  In addition, Gadamer has written on matters concerning law,\nethics, the changing character of the modern university, the\nconnection between philosophy and politics, and the nature of medical\npractice and the concept of health (see especially Gadamer 1993b, see\nalso see Aho 2022).\n\nIn almost all of these areas, Gadamer\u2019s approach is\ncharacterized, not by the attempt to apply pre-existing theory to the\ndomain in question, but rather by the attempt to think from within\nthat domain, and in a way that is attentive to it, that also entails a\nreciprocity between the theoretical and the applied. As Gadamer\ncomments in Truth and Method, \u2018application is neither a\nsubsequent nor merely an occasional part of the phenomenon of\nunderstanding, but co-determines it as a whole from the\nbeginning\u2019 (Gadamer 1989b, 324). Theory and application do not\noccur, then, in separation from one another, but are part of a single\nhermeneutical \u2018practice\u2019. The interdependence of\nphilosophical theory and practical application, often in the form of\nan interdependence between theoretical engagement in one domain and\nengagement in another, is evident to a degree in some of the very\nearly responses to Gadamer\u2019s work by thinkers from outside of\nphilosophy who had interests in the implications of hermeneutic\nthinking within their own specific domains. Thus Gadamer\u2019s work\nwas famously taken up in the 1960s by the Italian jurist Emilio Betti\n(see Betti, 2021[1964], pp. 45\u201361), and Betti\u2019s work was also\ndrawn upon by E. D. Hirsch whose concerns came from the direction of\nliterary theory (see Hirsch, 1965, 1967). Theology was another area\nwhere Gadamer had an early impact (see eg. Robinson. and Cobb, 1964),\npartly reinforced through connections between his work and that of the\ntheologian Bernard Lonergan (see Lawrence, 1984).\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking has continued to be influential in legal\ntheory and jurisprudence (see Mootz 2007), in literary theory (see\nWeinsheimer, 1991), and theology (see Lawrence, 2006), but the\ninterconnection of philosophical and practical hermeneutics that is\nevident in Gadamer\u2019s own work has itself been reflected in the\nway that work has been taken up in relation to practical and applied\nissues within many other domains\u2014within, for instance, health\nand medical practice (see e.g., Svenaueus 2003), intercultural studies\n(see e.g., Garfield 2002, Lammi 2008)), education (see e.g., Fairfield\n2012), environmental education and ecology (see e.g., Gr\u00fcn\n2005),architecture (see e.g. Snodgrass and Coyne 2006), and political\ntheory (see e.g. Walhof, 2022)(on many of these topics, see also the\nvarious chapters in Malpas & Gander 2014). Gadamer\u2019s work\nhas also seen application, though not uncontentiously, within feminism\n(see Homan, 2022) and contemporary race theory (Botts, 2022).\n\nThat practical engagement is an essential element in Gadamer\u2019s\nthinking implies that it cannot be seen to stand aside from questions\nof ethics. Gadamer never developed a book-length treatment that\naddresses such questions, but there is clearly an ethical current that\nruns throughout his thinking, and that is discernible, for instance,\nin his emphasis on the conversational character of hermeneutic\nengagement as well as his later reflections on the relation to the\nother (including on themes of friendship and solidarity) (see Gadamer\n1999). It is also clearly evident in the engagement with Aristotle\nthat runs throughout Gadamer\u2019s work as well as his engagement\nwith Plato (notably Gadamer, 1991). Despite the absence of a fully\ndeveloped account, Gadamer has addressed the matter of ethics directly\nin, most notably, \u2018On the Possibility of a Philosophical\nEthics\u2019 (Gadamer, 1999, pp. 18\u201336 and 2007, pp. 274\u2013289), in which\nGadamer argues against Kantian formalism in favor of a more\nAristotelian approach. The issue of the ethical dimension in\nGadamer\u2019s thought and in hermeneutics more generally has also\nbeen taken up in the work of others (see especially Schmidt, 2015;\nGeorge, 2020).\n",
