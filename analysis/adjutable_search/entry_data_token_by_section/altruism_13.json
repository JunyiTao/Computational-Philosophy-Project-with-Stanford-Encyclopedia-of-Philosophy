    "main_text": "Why care about others?\n4. Why care about others?\n\nRadically different ways of answering these questions can be found in\nmoral philosophy. The first makes self-interested motivation\nfundamental; it holds that we should be altruistic because it is in\nour interest to be so moved. That strategy is often attributed to the\nGreek and Roman philosophers of antiquity\u2014Plato, Aristotle, the\nStoics, and the Epicureans (see Annas 1993).\n\nIn the modern era, a second approach has come to the fore, built on\nthe notion that moral thinking is not self-centered but impartial and\nimpersonal. Its basic idea is that when we think morally\nabout what to do, reason takes a god\u2019s-eye perspective and sets\naside the emotional bias we normally have in our own favor, or in\nfavor of our circle of friends or our community. Here Kant 1785 is a\nrepresentative figure, but so too are the utilitarians\u2014Jeremy\nBentham 1789, John Stuart Mill 1864, and Henry Sidgwick 1907. \n\nA third approach, championed by David Hume (1739), Adam Smith (1759),\nand Arthur Schopenhauer (1840), gives sympathy, compassion, and\npersonal affection\u2014rather than impartial reason\u2014a central\nrole to play in the moral life. It holds that there is something\nextraordinarily valuable in the sentimental bonds that take hold among\nhuman beings\u2014a feature of human life that is overlooked or\ndistorted when morality is understood solely or primarily in\nimpersonal terms and from a god\u2019s-eye point of view. In\nfavorable conditions, we naturally and emotionally respond to the weal\nand woe of others; we do not and should not look for reasons to do so.\n(The assorted ideas labeled \u201csentimentalism\u201d in this entry\nare an amalgam of ideas derived loosely from the writings of Blum\n1980; Noddings 1986; Slote 1992, 2001 2010, 2013; and others. The term\nis sometimes applied to a family of meta-ethical views that ground the\nmeaning or justification of moral propositions in attitudes rather\nthan response-independent facts (Blackburn 2001). Here, by contrast,\nsentimentalism is a ground-level thesis about what is most valuable in\nhuman relationships. It could be combined with meta-ethical\nsentimentalism, but need not be.)\n\nThese three approaches are hardly an exhaustive survey of all that has\nbeen said in the Western philosophical tradition about altruism. A\nfuller treatment would examine the Christian conception of love, as\ndeveloped by thinkers of the medieval period. To a large extent, such\nfigures as Augustine and Aquinas work within a eudaimonistic\nframework, although they are also influenced by the Neoplatonic\npicture of the visible world as an outpouring of the bountifulness of\ndivine goodness. To the extent that rewards of heaven and the\nsufferings of hell play a role in a theocentric framework, there are\ninstrumental reasons, for those who need them, to care for others. But\nthere are other reasons as well. Other-regarding virtues like charity\nand justice are perfections of the human soul and are therefore\ncomponents of our earthly well-being. Christian philosophy rejects\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine that divine being has no ethical qualities\nand makes no interventions in human life. God is a person who loves\nhis creation, human beings above all. When we love others for\nthemselves, we imitate God and express our love for him (Lewis\n1960).\n",
