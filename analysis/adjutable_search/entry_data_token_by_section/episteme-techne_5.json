    "main_text": "Alexander of Aphrodisias\n6. Plotinus\n\nAs might be expected, Plotinus\u2019 philosophy does not have much\nuse for the concept of techn\u00ea. Its account of knowledge\nis fuller than that of craft and is close to Aristotle\u2019s idea of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strong sense. In the\nEnneads, epist\u00eam\u00ea is not directly\nassociated with techn\u00ea. In the first place,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea refers to the particular cognitive state\nof the first hypostasis from the One, Nous, in which there is an\nidentity between knowledge and what is known (VI. 6. 15). Our souls\ngain true knowledge by the presence of Nous, although Nous knows\nnon-discursively while our souls characteristically know in a\ndiscursive way (V. 9. 7; IV. 3.18). Discursive knowledge is the sort\nof knowing that moves from, e.g., premise to conclusion;\nnon-discursive thought, then, is a unitary grasp or understanding.\nDiscursive knowledge, through dialectic, is able to speak in a\nreasoned way about each thing, say what it is and in what way it\ndiffers from others, and what it has in common with those with which\nit exists, and so on. It does all these things with certain knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and not by opinion (I. 3. 4). Plotinus\nalso uses epist\u00eam\u00ea in another sense to refer to\nthe various branches of knowledge which are articulated in theorems\n(e.g., IV. 3. 2). Since the ideal state for a human is to enjoy the\nknowledge which is found in Nous and then, beyond that, the\ncontemplation of the One, Plotinus gives short shrift to the civic\nvirtues of courage, justice, and moderation. Once one attains the\nhigher levels, he gives up the civic virtues in their usual sense. At\nthis level, moderation, for instance, is not measure and limit but\nrather separation from one\u2019s lower nature (I. 2. 7. 25).\n\nTechn\u00ea, then, is even further down Plotinus\u2019 list\nof concerns. He gives as examples of technai grammar,\nrhetoric, lyre playing, music, housebuilding, medicine, and farming\n(II. 3. 2. 10\u201315; IV. 4. 31. 15\u201320). The most important\nuse of the nature of techn\u00ea is to illustrate points\nabout the coming to be of the universe. Plotinus holds that Nous gives\nrise to the rational principle (logos) which is responsible\nfor the existence of our universe (III. 2. 2) although the rational\nprinciple does not create the universe because the universe neither\ncomes into existence nor perishes (III. 2. 1). Still, Plotinus uses\nanalogies with techn\u00ea to explain the work of the\nrational principle. In the treatise on beauty, he says that beauty in\nthe material world comes from shape or form and rational principle;\ninsofar as matter is ordered by these it is beautiful. As an\nillustration of this point he cites the way techn\u00ea can\nbestow beauty on a house and its parts (I. 6. 2). In justifying the\npresence of both good and evil in the universe, he cites the way a\npainter includes varying and contrasting elements in painting (III. 2.\n11). In another very striking passage, Plotinus invokes the\ntechnai of dance, music, and drama to explain the way\ncontrasting elements in the life of the universe are blended (III. 2.\n16). Nevertheless, there are ways in which the activity of the\nrational principle is different from techn\u00ea. The most\nimportant is that rational principle does not reason that the universe\nshould exist; the creative power of rational principle is the power to\nmake another thing without striving for its being made. This power is\nnot acquired or learnt the way a techn\u00ea is (III. 2. 2).\nIn explaining the way nature works, Plotinus says that nature is\nproductive because of its contemplation of realities in Nous. Its act\nof contemplation makes what it contemplates\u2014 as though the very\nact of contemplation were automatically productive (III. 8. 4). In a\nsimilar vein he says that the universe is an image of reality but does\nnot exist by discursive thought (dianoia) nor by contrivance\nof craft (epitechn\u00easis) (II. 9. 8). Plotinus, then, is\nproposing the interesting notion that pure thought, while distinct\nfrom craft, can be productive in its own right.\n\nHence Plotinus can dismiss techn\u00ea as later than soul\nand imitating it, making unclear and weak copies, childish things not\nworth much, stacking up many devices in making an image of nature (IV.\n3. 10). Still, Plotinus makes some interesting claims about craft when\nhe is being less severe. Making an analogy with the beauty in Nous,\nPlotinus says that the statue is beautiful not because of the stone\nbut because of the form which craft puts in it. Moreover, this beauty\nwhich exists in the craft is much better than the beauty expressed in\nthe stone (V. 8. 1). Drawing another analogy between Nous and\ntechn\u00ea, he says that the forming principles of the\nuniverse come from Nous the way the forming principles in the souls of\ncraftsmen come from their crafts (V. 9. 3). Finally he raises the\nquestion whether techn\u00ea might be based somehow in the\nintelligible world. In answer, he distinguishes those crafts which\nimitate nature from those which consider proportion in general. The\nformer are painting, sculpture, dance, and mime. However, music deals\nwith proportion of an intelligible kind (V. 9. 11). Music, then, has\nsome grasp of purely intelligible proportion.\n",
