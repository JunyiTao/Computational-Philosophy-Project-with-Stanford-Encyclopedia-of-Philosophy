    "main_text": "Justice and the Politics of Work || Gender, Care, And Emotional Labor\n3.4 Gender, Care, And Emotional Labor\n\nWork\u2019s role in justice is further complicated by the fact that\nwork is a highly gendered phenomenon in many societies. For one, women\ntypically perform much of the housekeeping and child care that\ntraditionally have not been recognized with monetary compensation.\nWithin the formal labor market, many societies have a wage gap wherein\nwomen are paid less than men for similar work, and there are\nsignificant differences in gender representations in different\nprofessions (traditionally, women highly represented in fields such as\nprimary school teaching, nursing, and social work, men highly\nrepresented in fields such as engineering and finance). Feminist\nphilosophers have detected in these differentials an undervaluation of\nthe kinds of work, particularly care work, that women have often\nperformed (Gurtler and Smith 2005) as well as a blind spot in\nphilosophical theorizing about justice wherein\n\u2018relational\u2019 goods that matter to our life prospects but\nare usually not provided via market exchange are ignored (Gheaus\n2009). One intricate set of issues here is understanding the\nunderlying relations of cause and effect: Are women in societies with\nsexist norms pushed toward low pay or low prestige jobs because they\nare women, or are these low pay or low prestige jobs because women\ntend to perform them (or both)? In a similar vein, we may wonder how\nnorms of gender intersect with the gendered division of labor\n(whether, for example, the stereotype that women are more eager to\ncare for children feeds the gendered division of labor or whether the\ngendered division of labor reinforces that stereotype, or both).\n\nThe gendered division of labor is open to objections of different\nkinds: On the one hand, it appears to result in distributions of\nwork-related goods (such as income, free time, etc.) in which women\nare systematically shortchanged. In addition, the gendered division of\nlabor may be unjust because it contributes to hierarchies between the\ngenders that render them unequal. (Hartley and Watson 2018) Schouten\n(2019) argues that, although many individuals embrace traditional\ngender norms and the gendered division of labor these entail, those\nwho instead favour gender-egalitarian ways of life have a reasonable\nground to complain when societies create institutions and policies\nthat support expectations \u2014 the gendered division of labor chief\namong these \u2014 that serve as impediments to such ways of life.\nAccording to Schouten then, a just society will regulate work time,\nfamily leave, and dependent care so as to foster gender-egalitarian\nways of life and a non-gendered division of labor. (See also Wright\nand Brighouse 2008, Gheaus 2012.)\n\nA further strand in feminist thought about work arises from\nHochschild\u2019s scholarship (2012) on emotional labor.\nSome work involves intensive monitoring or management of one\u2019s\nown emotions in order to engage or manipulate the emotions of others.\nAlthough Hochschild offers examples of such emotional labor undertaken\nboth by women and men, some professions in which women predominate are\nsaturated with emotional labor. Hochschild notes that female flight\nattendants, for instance, are subject to a wide array of emotional\nexpectations vis-\u00e0-vis air travellers (smiling, friendly\nbanter, interest in travellers\u2019 destinations or professions,\netc.). Scholars have highlighted a number of ethically salient\nfeatures of emotional labor (see Barry, Olekalns, and Rees 2019 for a\nuseful overview), but the phenomenon has been subject to little\nsystematic philosophical analysis. Hochschild primarily emphasizes the\ndetrimental effects of emotional labor on workers themselves, arguing\nthat it can estrange workers from their own emotions and lead to\nstruggles to identify or express authentic emotion both within and\noutside the workplace. Furthermore, when emotional labor results in\nemployees\u2019 \u201csurface acting,\u201d that is, displaying\nemotions at odds with their own internal feelings, employees\u2019\nhealth suffers. Other ethical concerns are more interpersonal \u2014\nfor example, that emotional labor is deceptive or lacks integrity.\nBarry, Olekalns, and Rees (2019) offer a useful starting point by\nnoting that emotional labor raises the prospect of conflicts between\nworkers\u2019 rights and the rights of their employers, between\nworkers\u2019 rights and workers\u2019 duties, and between employer\nrights and employer duties.\n",
