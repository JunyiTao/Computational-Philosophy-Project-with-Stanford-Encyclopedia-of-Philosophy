    "main_text": "Violence and Self-Defense\n5. Violence and Self-Defense\n\nDouglass remained active in the years leading up to the U.S. Civil\nWar. He advocated for the abolition of slavery, worked against the\nexpansion of slavery into new U.S. territories, and vigorously\nprotested the Dred Scott decision and related laws that protected the\nproperty rights of slaveholders over slaves who escaped to the Free\nStates in the North.\n\nHe was a member of the Liberty party, was involved in other political\nparties, including the Radical and Free Soil parties, and eventually\nbecame involved with the Republican party\u2014all for the sake of\nabolition and the support of equal citizenship for all Americans\n(Blight 1989 and 2018). Douglass even met the militant abolitionist,\nJohn Brown. Although Douglass declined to join Brown\u2019s\nmilitia\u2014he sensed the deadly potential of Brown\u2019s zealotry\nand the likelihood of its failure\u2014he defended Brown\u2019s\nideals and denounced claims that Brown was merely mad. Although\nDouglass distanced himself from Brown\u2019s plans and destructive\nactions, he appropriated Brown as a symbol of righteous violence\nagainst the national sin of slavery and used the raid at\nHarper\u2019s Ferry to criticize President Lincoln\u2019s reluctance\nto support abolitionism (1859 [FDSW: 372\u2013376]; 1860b [FDSW:\n417\u2013421]; Myers 2008: 63\u201373; Blight 1989:\n95\u2013100).\n\nDouglass\u2019s rejection of pacifism and his support for Federal\nmilitary intervention to end slavery was a significant turning point\nin his thought about natural law, divine providence and manifest\ndestiny, and constitutional interpretation. Douglass\u2019s defense\nof jus ad Bellum greatly affected his contemporaries and the\nresulting debate on slavery, struggle, and self-respect. The modern\ndebate over violence and self-respect in African American philosophy,\ncritical race theory, and black political theory begins with\nDouglass\u2019s narratives, particularly his famous fight with the\n\u201cNegro breaker\u201d, Edward Covey. This incident plays a\nsignificant role in all of Douglass\u2019s narratives: Covey\nrepresents the brutalizing institution of American slavery, and\nDouglass\u2019s fight and victory represent the assertion of manhood,\nself-respect, dignity, and freedom. However, Douglass\u2019s time\nwith Covey and the suffering he endured by Covey\u2019s hand is given\na lengthier description in My Bondage and My Freedom than in\nthe Narrative. In the former, the depiction of the fight\nexplicitly draws parallels between Douglass\u2019s battle with Covey\nand the struggles of black Americans against slavery and racial\ndegradation.\n\nAdditionally, his fight has explicit national political connotations\n(Gooding-Williams 2009; Myers 2008). The scene\u2019s depiction in\neach autobiography is powerful and indicates its narrative brilliance\n(literary, rhetorical, and philosophical), so it deserves to be quoted\nat length. In the Narrative (1845), Douglass wrote:\n\n\nThe battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a\nslave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived\nwithin me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed\nself-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be\nfree. The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full\ncompensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He\nonly can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has\nhimself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never\nfelt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery,\nto the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice\ndeparted, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that,\nhowever long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed\nforever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it\nbe known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in\nwhipping, must also succeed in killing me. (FDAB: 65)\n\n\nIn My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he gives the following\nexpanded interpretation:\n\n\nWell, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey,\u2014undignified as\nit was, and as I fear my narration of it is\u2014was the turning\npoint in my \u201clife as a slave\u201d. It rekindled in my\nbreast the smouldering embers of liberty; it brought up my Baltimore\ndreams, and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being\nafter that fight. I was nothing before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It\nrecalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence, and\ninspired me with a renewed determination to be a FREEMAN. A man,\nwithout force, is without the essential dignity of humanity. Human\nnature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a helpless\nman, although it can pity him; and even this it cannot do\nlong, if the signs of power do not arise. (FDAB: 286, original\nemphases)\n\n\nThe first passage displays Douglass\u2019s romantic and religious\ninfluences; it swells with the longing for the freedom of the soul.\nThe second passage, written without the demands of Garrison\u2019s\npacifist politics directing his pen, screams independence and force.\nIt recommends violence\u2014it advocates for the coming U.S. Civil\nWar\u2014to throw off tyranny and claim, defend, and even fulfill\none\u2019s honor and humanity.\n",
