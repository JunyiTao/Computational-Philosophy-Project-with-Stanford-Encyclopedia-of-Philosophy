However, in context, it can be pretty easy\nto make them pass some of the tests for ambiguity. For example,\nconsider James, who wants to meet a man who is is tall for a\nphilosopher, and Jane who wants to meet a man who is tall for a\nhorse jockey (who tend to be a fair bit shorter on average). Let\u2019s\nconjunction reduce and see what happens:\n\n?James and Jane want to meet a tall man.\n\n\nAdmittedly, (65) strikes me as meriting a \u2018?\u2019 rather than\na \u2018#\u2019, but I am unwilling to let it escape\nunmarked. Let\u2019s try another case.  Consider, James speaking to\nJill and disagreeing over the relevant height required to be tall:\n\n?That mani is tall but hei\u2019s not\ntall.\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible, I think, to get a non-contradictory reading of\n(66). But it requires, to my ear, adding a good helping of\nfocal stress on the second \u2018tall\u2019. Of course, putting\nfocal stress on a word has semantic effects of its own. So we\ndon\u2019t have clear counter-examples to the tests here. But we do have\nsome evidence that running the tests requires controlling for\nvariables.\n\nSimilarly, speaker\u2019s reference and semantic reference\ndistinctions mentioned above can interfere with the proper operation\nof the tests. Let\u2019s consider a variant on Kripke\u2019s famous\ncase. We see someone who looks like Smith (but is Jones) raking the\nleaves and someone else sees Smith (the actual Smith) raking leaves.\nCan we hear the following as non-zeugmatic?\n\nWe saw Smith raking the leaves and he did too.\n\n\nIn context, this sounds awfully bad to me. It doesn\u2019t seem,\nhowever, that the word \u2018Smith\u2019 is ambiguous in sometimes\nreferring to Jones, sometimes Smith. The utterance of the word \u2018Smith\u2019\nhowever, may well be used with referential intentions that lead to\nutterance ambiguity. \n\nThe bottom line is that in clear cases, the tests work great. In\ncontroversial cases, one must be very careful and run many of them and\nhope for the best; it will sometimes involve sifting through degrees\nof zeugma rather than triumphantly producing an indisputable\nresult.\n",
