    "main_text": "Information as Code || Substructural logics and information flow\n3.2 Substructural logics and information flow\n\nCategorial information theory is precipitated by giving the Lambek\ncalculi an informational semantics. At a suitable level of\nabstraction, the Lambek calculi is seen to be a highly expressive\nsubstructural logic. Unsurprisingly, by giving an\ninformational semantics for substructural logics in general, we get a\nfamily of logics that exemplify the information as code approach. This\nlogical family is organised by expressive power, with the expressive\npower of the logics in question being captured by the presence of\nvarious structural rules.\n\nA structural rule is of the following general form: \n\\[\\tag{11} X \\Leftarrow Y \\]\n\n\nWe may read (11) as any information generated by processing on\n\\(X\\) is generated by processing on \\(Y\\) also. Hence the\nlong-form of (11) is as follows: \n\\[\\tag{12} \\frac{X \\vdash A}{Y \\vdash A} \\]\n\n\nHence \\(X\\) is a structured body of information, or \u201cdata\nstructure\u201d as Gabbay (1996: 423) puts it, where the actual\narrangement of the information plays a crucial role. The\nstructural rules will fix the structure of the information encoded by\n\\(X\\), and as such impact upon the granularity of the information\nbeing processed.\n\nConsider Weakening, the most familiar of the structural rules\n(followed by its corresponding frame condition: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Weakening} &A \\Leftarrow A \\otimes B \\\\\n &x\\bullet y \\sqsubseteq z \\rightarrow x \\sqsubseteq z \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWith Weakening present, we loose track of which pieces of information\nwere actually used in an inference. This is precisely why it is that\nthe rejection of Weakening is the mark of relevant logics, where the\npreservation of bodies of information relevant to the derivation of\nthe conclusion is the motivation. By rejecting Weakening, we highlight\na certain type of informational taxonomy, in the sense that\nwe know which bodies of information were used. To preserve\nmore structural detail than simply which bodies of information were\nused, we need to consider rejecting further structural rules.\n\nSuppose that we want to record not only which pieces of information\nwere used in an inference, but also how often they were used. In this\ncase we would reject Contraction: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Contraction} &A \\otimes A \\Leftarrow A \\\\\n &x \\bullet x \\sqsubseteq x \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nContraction allows the multiple use, without restriction, of a piece\nof information. So if keeping a record of the \u201cinformational\ncost\u201d of the execution of some information processing is a\nconcern, Contraction will be rejected. The rejection of Contraction is\nthe mark of linear logics, which were designed for modelling just such\nprocessing costs (see Troelstra 1992).\n\nIf we wish to preserve the order of use of pieces of\ninformation, then we will reject the structural rule of\nCommutation: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Commutation} &A \\otimes B \\Leftarrow B \\otimes A \\\\\n &x \\bullet y \\sqsubseteq z \\rightarrow y \\bullet x \\sqsubseteq z \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nInformation-order will be of particular concern in temporal settings\n(consider action-composition) and natural language semantics (Lambek\n1958), where non-commuting logics first appeared. Commutation comes\nalso in a more familiar strong form: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Strong Commutation} &(A \\otimes B) \\otimes D \\Leftarrow(A \\otimes D) \\otimes B \\\\\n &\\exists u(x \\bullet z \\sqsubseteq u \\wedge u \\bullet y \\sqsubseteq w) \\rightarrow\\\\\n &\\qquad \\exists u(x \\bullet y \\sqsubseteq u \\wedge u \\bullet z \\sqsubseteq w) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe strong form of Commutation results from its combination with the\nstructural rule of\n Association:[7]\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Association} &A \\otimes(B \\otimes C) \\Leftarrow(A \\otimes B) \\otimes C \\\\\n &\\exists u(x \\bullet y \\sqsubseteq u \\wedge u \\bullet z \\sqsubseteq w) \\rightarrow \\\\\n &\\qquad \\exists u(y \\bullet z \\sqsubseteq u \\wedge x \\bullet u \\sqsubseteq w) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRejecting Association will preserve the precise fine-grained\nproperties of the combination of pieces of information.\nNon-associative logics were introduced originally to capture the\ncombinatorial properties of language syntax (see Lambek 1961).\n\nIn the presence of Commutation, a double implication pair\n\\((\\rightarrow , \\leftarrow)\\) collapses into single implication\n\\(\\rightarrow\\). In the presence of all of the structural rules,\nfusion, \\(\\otimes\\), collapses into Boolean conjunction, \\(\\wedge\\).\nIn this case, the residuation conditions outlined in (5) and (6)\ncollapse into a mono-directional function.\n\nThe choice of which structural rules to retain obviously depends on\njust what informational phenomena is being modelled, so there is a\nstrong pluralism at work. By rejecting Weakening say, we are\nspeaking of which data were relevant to the process, but are\nsaying nothing about its multiplicity (in which case we would reject\nContraction), its order (in which case we would reject Commutation),\nor the actual patterns of use (in which case we would reject\nAssociation). By allowing Association, Commutation, and Contraction,\nwe have the taxonomy locked down. We might not know the order or\nmultiplicity of the data that were used, but we do know what types,\nand exactly what types, were relevant to the successful processing.\nThe canonical contemporary exposition of such an information-based\ninterpretation of propositional relevant logic is Mares (2004). Such\nan interpretation allows for an elegant treatment of the\ncontradictions encoded by relevant logics. By distinguishing between\ntruth conditions and information conditions, we\nallow for an interpretation of \\(x \\Vdash A \\wedge \\neg A\\) as\n\\(x\\) carries the information that \\(A\\) and not \\(A\\). For\nan exploration of the distinction between truth-conditions and\ninformation-conditions within quantified relevant logic, see\nMares (2009).\n\nAt such a stage, things are still fairly static. By shifting\nour attention from static bodies of information, to the manipulation\nof these bodies, we will reject structural rules beyond\nWeakening, arriving ultimately at categorial information theory, as it\nis encoded by the very weakest substructural logics. Hence the weaker\nwe go, the more \u201cprocedural\u201d the flavour of the logics\ninvolved. From a dynamic/procedural perspective, linear logics might\nbe thought of as a \u201chalf way point\u201d between static\nclassical logic, and fully procedural categorial information theory.\nFor a detailed exposition of the relationship between linear logic and\nother formal frameworks in the context of modelling information flow,\nsee Abramsky (2008).\n\nRecent important work by Dunn (2015) ties substructural logics and\nstructural rules together with informational relevance in the\nfollowing way. Dunn makes a distinction between programs and\ndata, with the former being dynamic and the latter static. We\nmay think of programs as conditional statements of the form \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\), and of data as atomic propositions \\(A, B\\) etc.\nGiven these two types of information artefacts, we have three possible\ncombinations, program to data combination, program to program\ncombination, and data to data combination. For program to data\ncombination, commutation will hold whilst weakening and association\nwill fail, and contraction not applying. For program to program\ncombination association will hold, whilst commutation, weakening fail.\nAs demonstrated in Sequoiah-Grayson (2016), the case of contraction\nfor program to program combination is more complicated. The exact\nproperties of data to data combination remain an interesting open\nissue. The connection with informational relevance is made by\ninterpreting the partial order relation \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) as marking\ninformation relevance itself. In this case, \\(x \\sqsubseteq y\\) is\nread as the information x is relevant to the\ninformation y. To what it is exactly that informational relevance\namounts will depend on the precise context of information processing\nin question. Sequoiah-Grayson (2016) extends the framework about to\ncontexts of information processing by an agent as the agent reasons\nexplicitly. Given that the combination of information states \\(x\n\\bullet y\\) may sit on the left hand side of the partial order\nrelation, the extension is an account of the epistemic relevance of\nepistemic actions.
