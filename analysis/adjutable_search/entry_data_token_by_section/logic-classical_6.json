    "main_text": "The One Right Logic? || Rivals to classical, first-order logic\n6.1 Rivals to classical, first-order logic\nApproximations\n\nIn recent years, some work has been done to \"approximate\" classical\nlogic. The idea is to get as close to classical logic as possible, in\norder to preserve some of the benefits, while at the same time\nremoving some limitations of classical logic, like being closer to\nintuitive inference or applying to things like vagueness and\nparadoxes. \n\nFor example, Barrio, Pailos and Szmuc [2020] show that we can\napproximate classical logic in something called the ST-hierarchy (ST\nfor strict-tolerant, from Cobreros, Egre, Ripley and van Rooij\n[2012a,b]). This allows them to avoid certain classical problems at\neach level of the hierarchy, like some of the paradoxes, while at the\nsame time maintaining many of the benefits of the strength of\nclassical logic when considering the full hierarchy.\n\nDave Ripley [2013] provides a multi-sequent calculus version of\n\u201cclassical logic\u201d that he argues solves some of the\nparadoxes. Notably, he claims it solves at least the Sorites and Liar\nParadoxes (see the entries on the\n sorites paradox\n and\n liar Paradox).\n The system conservatively extends classical logic. Ripley claims that\nthis is what makes it classical. However, the system is not\ntransitive, and does not have a Cut rule.\n\nThere are, of course, some questions about whether these new logics\nare really classical, but it is informative work\nnonetheless.\nExpansions\n\nOne way to extend classical, first-order logic is to add additional\noperators to the underlying formal language. Modal logic adds\noperators which designate necessity and possibility. So, we can say\nthat a proposition is possibly true, or necessarily true, rather than\njust true.\n\nW. V. O Quine [1953] once argued that it is not coherent for\nquantifiers to bind variables inside modal operators, but opinion on\nthis matter has since changed considerably (see, for example, Barcan\n[1990]). There is now a thriving industry of developing modal logics\nto capture various kinds of modality and temporal operators. See the\nentry on\n modal logic.\n \n\nAll of the formal languages sketched above have only one sort of\nvariable. These are sometimes called first-order variables.\nEach interpretation of the language has a domain, which is the range\nof these first-order variables. It is what the language is about,\naccording to the given interpretation. Second-order variables\nrange over properties, sets, classes, relations, or functions of the\nitems in that domain. Third-order variables range over\nproperties, classes, relations of whatever is in the range of the\nsecond-order variables. And it goes on from there.\n\nA formal language is called second-order if it has\nsecond-order variables and first-order variables, and no others;\nThird-order if it has third-order, second-order, and\nfirst-order variables and no others, etc. A formal language is\nhigher-order if it is at least second-order.\n\nAs noted, it is not an exaggeration to say that classical, first-order\nlogic is the paradigm of contemporary logical theory. Most textbooks\ndo not mention higher-order languages at all, and most of the rest\ngive it scant treatment.\n\nA number of different deductive systems and model-theoretic semantics\nhave been proposed for second- and higher-order languages. For the\nsemantics, the main additional feature of the model-theory is to\nspecify a range of the higher-order variables.\n\nIn Henkin semantics, each interpretation specifies a specific\nrange of the higher-order variables. For monadic second-order\nvariables, each interpretation specifies a non-empty subset of the\npowerset of the domain, for two-place second-order variables, a\nnon-empty set of ordered pairs of members of the domain, etc. The\nsystem has all of the above limitative meta-theoretic results. There\nis a deductive system that is sound and complete for Henkin semantics;\nthe logic is compact; and the downward and upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems all hold.\n\nIn so-called standard semantics, sometimes called full\nsemantics, monadic second-order variables range over the entire\npowerset of the domain; two-place second-order variables range over\nthe entire class of ordered pairs of members of the domain, etc. It\ncan be shown that second-order languages, with standard semantics, can\ncharacterize many mathematical notions and structures, up to\nisomorphism. Examples include the notions of finitude, countability,\nwell-foundedness, minimal closure, and structures like the natural\nnumbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers. As a result, none\nof the limitative theorems of classical, first-order logic hold: there\nis no effective deductive system is both sound and complete, the logic\nis not compact, and both L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems fail. Some,\nsuch as Quine [1986], argue that second-order logic, with standard\nsemantics is not really logic, but is a form of mathematics, set\ntheory in particular. For more on this, see Shapiro [1991] and the\nentry on\n higher-order logic,\n along with the many references cited there.\n\nOne might also consider generalized quantifiers as an expansion of\nclassical first-order logic (see the entry on\n generalized quantifiers).\n These quantifiers allow from an expansion between the classical\n\u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d , and can accommodate\nquantifiers like \u201cmost\u201d , \u201cless than half\u201d ,\n\u201cusually\u201d , etc. They are useful from both a logical and\nlinguistic perspective. For example, Kennedy and\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen [2021] use generalized quantifiers to argue\nthat \u201c uncountable\u201d is a logical notion.\n",
