Allozyme Variation and the Drift vs Selection Controversy\n\nThe central problem with using conspicuous polymorphisms for\ninvestigating the relative roles of the variety of different\nevolutionary forces is that they not an unbiased sample of genetic\ndiversity with respect to either adaptive function or amount of\ngenetic variation. Indeed, the definition of genetic polymorphism\nadopted by Ford (see above) incorporates the essence of both of these\nbiases. For a period, it was believed that \u201cThe solution to our\ndilemma lies in the development of molecular genetics\u201d (Lewontin\n1974: 99). With the advent of electrophoresis, the amino acid sequence\nof a random sample of proteins from almost any organism could be\nstudied and, for the first time, the level of genetic diversity, in\nthe form of amino acid substitutions, across the genome could be\nquantified.\n\nTwo measures of genetic diversity were possible using electrophoresis:\n\n\n the number of loci polymorphic; and, \n the average heterozygosity per locus per individual. \n\n\nFrom studies across a number of species, it was estimated that\n15\u201340% of all loci were polymorphic and the average individual\nwas heterozygous at 5\u201315% of its genome. Since this technique\nmeasured primarily amino acid substitutions resulting in charge\nchanges, i.e., only one third of all possible amino acid\nsubstitutions, one could infer that these were minimal levels of\ngenetic diversity which significantly underestimated the actual\nlevels. The conclusion that genetic variation was ubiquitous, with\nmost genes being polymorphic, was inescapable. The search for the\nadaptive function of allozyme variants and balancing selection at the\nphysiological level ensued, just as it had in the earliest studies in\necological genetics.\n\nHowever, the observed levels of genetic polymorphism presented an\ninsurmountable problem for the mathematical theory of evolutionary\ngenetics. The amount of genetic variation was much too large to be\nexplained by the type of balancing selection observed by Ford and his\ncolleagues for conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms in natural\npopulations. The basic problem was that the numbers of selective\ndeaths necessary to account for the observed levels of allozyme\npolymorphism exceeded the reproductive excess of almost all species.\nThis where the focus on genetics must be coupled with the ecology of\nreproduction and viability. Haldane (1957) called this the \u201ccost\nof natural selection\u201d and it is also referred to as the\nsubstitutional load. Differently put, the mortality of homozygous\ngenotypes, if independently selected, (also known as the\n\u201csegregation load\u201d) would exceed the total numbers of\noffspring produced by a population. For this reason, Kimura (1983)\nproposed his neutral theory of molecular evolution, founded on the\ntheoretical observation that the probability of fixation of a novel\nmutant allele with selective coefficient, \\(s \\gt 0\\), was\napproximately \\(2s\\) (Wright 1931: 133). Since \\(s\\) was generally\nbelieved to be in the range of 0.001 to 0.0001, the likelihood of loss\nof a new favorable mutation by chance is quite high, only slightly\nsmaller than the probability of loss by chance for a truly neutral\nallele.\n\nStudies of protein structure revealed that the functional,\nnon-synonymous sites of a protein, which constitute the minority of\nits amino acids, evolved several times more slowly than the\nnon-functional, synonymous or structural sites. Kimura\u2019s view\nthat much, if not most, of evolutionary change at the molecular level\nwas determined by random genetic drift and not natural selection was\nhighly controversial. As Kimura noted, \n\n\n\u2026if a certain doctrine is constantly being spoken of favorably\nby the majority, endorsed by top authorities in their books and taught\nin classes, then a belief is gradually built up in one\u2019s mind,\neventually becoming the guiding principle and the basis of value\njudgment. At any rate, this was the time when the panselectionist or\n\u201cneo-Darwinian\u201d position was most secure in the history of\nbiology: the heyday of the traditional \u201csynthetic theory\u201d\nof evolution. (1983: 22)\n\n\nIt was soon recognized that a more reductionistic approach (DNA\nsequence studies) might help to resolve the issue of whether or not\nevery amino acid was of some functional value because the redundant\npositions in the code of life were assumed to provide an estimate of\nthe true \u201cneutral\u201d rate of evolution, owing to random\ngenetic drift acting in the absence of selection.\n",
