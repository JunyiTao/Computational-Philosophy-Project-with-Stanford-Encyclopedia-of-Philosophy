    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Essay on Taste\n5. Hume\u2019s Essay on Tragedy\n\n\u201cOf Tragedy\u201d grapples with a very different set of\nproblems than \u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d The motivating\nissue in \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is that of unpleasant emotion as a\npositive feature of a work. Hume proposes to explain how \u201ca\nwell-written tragedy\u201d is pleasing when that pleasure appears to\ndepend on \u201csorrow, terror, anxiety,\u201d and other naturally\ndisagreeable emotions (OT, 258). Hume had visited this topic before,\nin the Treatise, where his account of the pleasure of tragedy\ninvokes pity and sympathy (T, 369). \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d replaces\nthis earlier account with a complex proposal about the mental workings\nof imagination in relation to our negative passions.\n\nOriginally published beside \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d in\nFour Dissertations, \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is a peculiar\nessay. Its direct engagement with Bernard de Fontenelle and the\nAbb\u00e9 Jean-Baptiste Dubos confirms Hume\u2019s acquaintance\nwith French aesthetics. Hume makes passing reference to catharsis in\nhis mention of spectator cries and sobs that \u201cgive vent to their\nsorrow\u201d (OT, 258), but there is no evidence of familiarity with\nAristotle\u2019s Poetics. On the whole, the essay says\nsurprisingly little about the nature of tragedy, and what it says is\ncombined with discussions of melodramas and historical writing. Its\nreal topic is the experience of conflicting emotions directed\nsimultaneously at a single object, a topic treated in the\nTreatise. Because the pleasure offered by tragedy and\nmelodrama depends on and is proportionate with their capacity to\narouse grief, fear, and other unpleasant passions, Hume uses\nliterature and theater as an occasion to elaborate on his theory of\nmixed emotions. As Hume formulates it, the problem is to explain the\nnature of the relationship between our approbation, which is\npleasurable, and the presence of \u201csorrow, terror,\nanxiety,\u201d and other naturally disagreeable emotions (OT, 258).\nThe solution, Hume claims, is that any emotion \u201cwhich attends a\npassion, is easily converted into it, though in their natures they be\noriginally different from, and even contrary to each other\u201d (T,\n419).\n\nAlthough published side by side, \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d and\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d may offer conflicting\ndoctrines. In the essay on taste, the unchallenged appearance of vice\nis treated as a flaw, and unpleasant emotion is a defect. But when\n\u201cOf Tragedy\u201d identifies a flaw in Nicholas Rowe\u2019s\nThe Ambitious Stepmother, the play\u2019s defect is not the\nendorsement of vice. Instead, its flaw is the staging of action that\nis \u201ctoo bloody and atrocious\u201d (OT, 264). But why is\n\u201cshocking\u201d spectacle a flaw that leads to general\ndisapprobation? Is it simply a question of the degree of shock? But\nwhy should that prevent the audiences from \u201cconverting\u201d\nthe shock into a \u201ccontrary\u201d and pleasurable experience, as\nHume claims happens with terror and anxiety? The obstacle does not\nseem to be moral in nature, of the sort explored in \u201cOf the\nStandard of Taste\u201d where Hume discusses a work\u2019s failure\nto direct proper disapprobation at vicious manners. The essay on taste\nsuggests that the same content would not be a flaw if proper\nadjustments were made. But \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d does not call\nattention to the moral dimension of Rowe\u2019s play. So \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d is a discourse on an interesting puzzle about human\npsychology, namely the fact that unpleasant elements can be either\nstrengths or ruinous defects. \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d says nothing\nabout moralism and art.\n\nHume\u2019s account of tragic pleasure has two components. First,\ndifferent features of the work must generate the viewer\u2019s\nagreeable and disagreeable responses. Disagreeable aspects contribute\nto our general approbation because those properties are balanced by\nnaturally agreeable properties. Second, a general psychological\nprinciple explains how it is possible for competing emotions to\nproduce a complex, pleasing sentiment. Borrowed from the\nTreatise (T, 419), that principle holds that when the same\nobject produces different passions, even those \u201cof a contrary\nnature,\u201d then the subordinate passion can be\n\u201cconverted\u201d into the predominant (OT, 262). \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d combines these two ideas. Our natural delight in\n\u201cimitation\u201d provides a strong and predominant passion. The\nnaturally disagreeable emotions aroused by the plot provide a\nsubordinate and contrary emotion, the \u201cmovement\u201d of which\n\u201cfortifies\u201d the predominant passion. Unless the negative\nemotion becomes predominant, the overall effect of a well-written\ntragedy will be an audience \u201cpleased in proportion as they are\nafflicted\u201d (OT 258). The details of Hume\u2019s theory are\nexplored by Cohen (1962), Budd (1991), Neill (1992, 1999), and Dadlez\n(2004, 2016).\n\nAlthough Hume illustrates his general principle with numerous\nexamples, few of his contemporaries or modern interpreters endorse his\ntheory. A rare exception is Galgut (2001). Famously, the theory faces\nmultiple objections. It offers no working definition of tragedy and\nits examples are not, for the most part, genuine tragedies, points\nnoted by Neill (1999). The details of Hume\u2019s examples raise\nfurther issues. For example, Hume thinks it is obvious that\nRowe\u2019s play fails due to its gory and shocking spectacle, which\ntips the balance in the wrong direction. But the obvious reply is that\nmany viewers enjoy the spectacle of violence. Hume basically says so:\n\u201cThe English theatre abounds too much with such shocking\nimages\u201d (OT, 265). How can Hume contend that the play is ruined\nwhen so many viewers enjoy it? For there is no appeal except to\nsentiment.\n\nPerhaps Hume thinks that shocking spectacle satisfies vulgar taste but\nnot refined taste. \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d posits\ndifferences in audience members to account for different responses.\nHume\u2019s sketchy theory in \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is compatible\nwith most people enjoying aesthetically uninteresting works, for\nroutine design readily delights most people (SOT, 276). But a refined\ntaste is equally sensitive to all facets of the work, including formal\ndesign. Just as the wine tasted funny to Sancho\u2019s kinsmen (SOT,\n272\u201373), a run-of-the-mill work \u201cgives pain\u201d to true\ncritics (SOT, 276). Only the best critics worry about the absence of\ngenius.\n\nThe rules of taste endorsed in \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d\nfacilitate habituated expectations based on previous experiences with\nsimilar art. Aesthetic pleasure frequently depends on\n\u201ccustom\u201d (T, 299) and on associations and expectations\ndeveloped by the life experiences of the intended audience. If\naudience expectations are violated by excessive violence, and if there\nis no compensating reward for its inclusion, then the work has been\nimproperly staged for its intended audience. But works that merely\nsatisfy expectations will please the less discerning critics. Hence\n\u201cshocking images\u201d that are routine in English theater will\nplease the audience. The same gory spectacle and \u201cdismal\u201d\nstories, insufficiently \u201csoftened\u201d by genius and\neloquence, will displease a refined taste (OT, 265).\n\nUnfortunately, this interpretation merely heightens the problem. What\nis it that rewards vulgar taste? Why does violent spectacle attract\nanyone to routine, predictable potboilers? Natural sympathy should\narouse uneasiness at the gory spectacle, yet the vulgar have no\ncompensating reward. Brilliant language is surely an attraction of\nShakespeare\u2019s Othello, but no such achievement is to be\nfound in most of the popular fiction that reliably delights its\naudience. Hume even implies that the vulgar do not attend to\n\u201celoquence\u201d and similar formal achievement. However, the\nmere fact of \u201cimitation\u201d seems insufficient to explain the\npredominant pleasure in the face of this material. Is it the\nspectacle\u2019s \u201cexactness of imitation\u201d (SOT, 276)? But\nthat would seem to be a compensating pleasure in all but the most\ninept production, and would lead us to expect that vulgar audiences\nwould respond with equal pleasure to almost any inferior work that\nmeets their expectations. But this is simply not the case. \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d does not meet the standards of argument and insight set\nby Hume\u2019s other contributions to aesthetics.\n",
