    "main_text": "Justification and Beyond || Forgetting\n3.5 Forgetting\n\nForgetting is normatively significant. Not only does some of it invite\nmoral blame (Bernecker 2018), but it is essential to the\nepistemological problems of forgotten evidence and forgotten defeat.\nBut it is not entirely clear what forgetting is. And surprisingly\nlittle work addresses the nature of forgetting. Some forgetting is a\nprocess, other forgetting is a mental state; forgetting might have\ndifferent types of content (e.g., a proposition or an event or an\nexperience); forgetting involves some characteristic relation to its\ncontent that distinguishes it from other processes or states with the\nsame content; forgetting has some scale, either binary or a further\ngraded range (Frise 2018b).\n\nIt might seem commonsensical that forgetting, whatever it is exactly,\nis incompatible with knowing. What you forget, you no longer know. But\nperhaps sometimes a subject forgets what she still knows (Moon 2012b;\nPappas 1983, 1987). The forgetting may involve trying but failing to\nmentally access previously learned information. The information may be\nmentally accessible to the subject via her memory. The subject fails\nto access it, however. She still dispositionally knows what\nshe\u2019s forgetting. Other ways of forgetting are harder to square\nwith knowing. For example, some forgetting involves information being\nlost. And it\u2019s plausible that a subject does not still know\ninformation that she has lost.\n\nForgetting appears to be an epistemic defect, in part because some\nforgetting appears incompatible with knowing. It would be better not\nto forget, because not forgetting would allow for more\nknowing.\u00a0However forgetting might be a feature of a virtuously\nfunctioning memory system (Michaelian 2011a). Not forgetting, or too\nlittle forgetting, would be a problem. The problem wouldn\u2019t be\nthat human memory would run out of storage space, hampering further\nlearning. Rather, human memory works better by clearing out clutter,\nsuch as learned information we don\u2019t care about. Forgetting\nallows faster, more reliable recall, and perhaps a greater ratio of\nrecall for what we do care about.\n",
