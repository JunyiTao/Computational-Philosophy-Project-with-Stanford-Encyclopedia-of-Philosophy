    "main_text": "Historical Accounts || Curry\n3.4 Curry\n\nA more recent version of deductivism was defended by Haskell Curry in\nhis 1951 Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics.\nAs he sees it, \u201cmathematics is the science of formal\nsystems\u201d (1951: 56). For Curry, formal systems are to be\nunderstood deductively\u2014they are comprised of a formal language,\naxioms and inference rules called \u201crules of procedure\u201d\n(1951: 11\u201313). Writing after the discovery of incompleteness,\nCurry has this to say about its implications:\n\n\nThe incompleteness theorems [\u2026] show that it is hopeless to\nfind a single formal system which will include all of mathematics as\nordinarily understood. Moreover the arbitrary nature of the\ndefinitions which can constitute the primitive frame of a formal\nsystem shows that, in principle at least, all formal systems stand on\na par. The essence of mathematics lies, therefore, not in any\nparticular kind of formal system, but in formal structure as such.\n(Curry 1951: 56)\n\n\nCurry calls his conception formalist. But by formalism, Curry\njust means the science of what can be deduced in formal systems.\nFormalism and deductivism (as understood in this entry) are similar in\ntheir focus on syntax over semantics. However, deductivism holds that\nmathematical claims have truth-conditions, unlike games; and it\nregards only logical inferences as permissible, whereas a formalist\ncan in principle condone any symbol-derivation practice. In line with\nthe deductivist rather than the formalist interpretation, Curry uses\nthe notion of truth extensively in his writings and rejects the view\nthat formal systems are to be conceived of as a game:\n\n\nThere must be an objective criterion of truth, and the first\ntask of the mathematical logician is to find it. The first thesis of\nthis book is that such a definition can be found. (1951: 3)\n\nBefore we proceed to the discussion of the formalist definition of\nmathematics, it will be necessary to consider the definition of its\nfundamental notion, that of a formal system. [\u2026] The conception\nhere expounded differs superficially from the usual one in that\nsuch a system is conceived not as a game but as a body of\npropositions. [\u2026] The first point is that the words\n\u201cproposition\u201d, \u201ctrue\u201d,\n\u201cpredicate\u201d, etc., used in the following, are intended in\nthe sense of ordinary discourse. [\u2026] [A proposition] indicates\ncertain conditions for verification; when the proposition is\nasserted\u2014taken as true \u2014, that means that these conditions\nare fulfilled, so that processes of verification are what determine,\nessentially, the meaning of the proposition. (1951: 8)\n\nFor the purposes of mathematics it is sufficient to have criteria for\nrecognising a formal system as such, and for deciding which\npropositions are true. (1951: 31)\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of this perspective, according to Curry, is\nthe absence of metaphysical speculation\u2014a key motivation for\ndeductivism (see\n \u00a72):\n\n\nThe formalist conception of mathematics is thus free from\nmetaphysical bias, and is therefore compatible with practically\nany sort of philosophy. It is the only conception so far proposed\nwhich has that character. (1951: 58; our emphasis)\n\n",
