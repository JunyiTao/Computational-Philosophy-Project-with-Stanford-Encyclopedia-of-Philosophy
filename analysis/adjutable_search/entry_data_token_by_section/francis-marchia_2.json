    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n3. Natural Philosophy\n\n Since the time of Pierre Duhem in the early twentieth century,\nFrancis of Marchia has been known to historians as a scientist. In\nfact, to a large extent Marchia had gained such a reputation in his\nown lifetime. It is in the question commentary on the Physics of Francis Marbres (a.k.a. John the Canon; Schabel 2014) that we find him paraphrasing Marchia on future contingents, for\nexample, and Marbres\u2019 commentary is full of references to Marchia\u2019s own\ncommentaries on the Sentences and the Metaphysics\n(Friedman-Schabel 2006, 8\u201310). Looking through the titles of Marchia\u2019s\nquestions, one finds an abundance of scientific topics related to such\nthings as the infinite and the psychology of willing\n(Friedman-Schabel, 2001). In general, Marchia displays a great\ninterest in the causal process. One thing that helps explain his\npopularity among historians of medieval science, and perhaps his own\ninterest in scientific matters, is his clear and sharp distinction\nbetween natural causation that works necessarily and the contingent\ncausation of human and divine free will. In an influential passage\ncontaining echoes of Siger of Brabant, a passage to which Anneliese\nMaier first drew attention (Scriptum I, d. 36: Maier 1949;\nMarchia 2000), Marchia explains that there are two types of\ncontingency in the world: first, there is contingency per se,\nsimpliciter, positiva, and intrinseca. This\nis the contingency by which something is still able to occur or not\noccur even when all the required accidental, natural causes have been\nposited. There is only one source of such contingency: free\nwill. Second, there is contingency per accidens, secundum\nquid, privativa, and extrinseca. This is the\ncontingency of natural causation. A natural effect takes place as the\nresult of many accidental causes. Some of these causes may be impeded\nby other natural, accidental causes, and so with respect to a small,\nlimited number of causes a natural effect may be considered\n\u2018contingent\u2019. This does not mean that the natural effect\nis really and truly contingent without qualification in the first way,\nhowever, because if we take all of the natural effect\u2019s\ncauses into account, the effect will necessarily follow, or\nnot follow, as the case may be. That is, assuming God\u2019s contingent\ncreation in the first place, and His \u2018general influence\u2019\nthat keeps the chain of causation in existence, natural causation\nworks necessarily, and so with all of an effect\u2019s causes taken\ntogether, what happens in nature is necessary. Of crucial important\nfor science is Marchia\u2019s further assertion that these\n\u2018contingent\u2019 effects can even be known by a\ncreated intellect. This is because the number of natural\ncauses is not infinite. Thus a finite, created intellect can know the\nnatural future with certainty. The only problem, says Marchia, is that\nwe humans have a short life and an intellect that is bound with the\nbody.\n\n Interestingly, one of the debates that has arisen recently\nsurrounding Marchia\u2019s scientific ideas concerns his concept of natural\ncausation and predictability. In giving an analysis similar to the one\nabove, one scholar remarked that \u201cMarchia in essence is laying down\none of the bases of modern science, at least before Heisenberg:\npredictability is theoretically obtainable in natural systems because\nnatural causes are finite and act necessarily\u201d (Marchia 2000, 22;\nSchabel 2000, 196\u20137). A second scholar replied that Marchia is\nnot a natural determinist, that for him, while \u201cgenerally it\u2019s\npossible to achieve merely the habit of foreseeing the development of\ncausal chains, \u2026 physical events happen because causes and\neffects have dispositiones or aptitudines that make\nmore probable some chains than different ones.\u201d According to this\nresponse, Marchia was more in line with \u201cHeisenberg\u2019s principle of\nindetermination\u201d than with post-Galilean physics (Zanin 2006a). It\nseems clear, however, that Marchia\u2019s analysis of\ndispositiones and aptitudines in this context is\nfocused entirely on the problem of knowing causes that are fully\ncontingent in themselves, that is, human free will, as outlined above\nin the section on\n Philosophical Theology.\n By Marchia\u2019s time, treatments of divine foreknowledge of future\ncontingents, where Marchia\u2019s discussion occurs, had become almost\nexclusively concerned with the reconciliation of human free will and\ndivine omniscience. Thus Marchia explains that the seemingly\ncontingent effects of the natural world are not the issue here, since\nthey are not really contingent at all, but necessary, given God\u2019s\ngeneral influence and understanding all natural causes taken\ntogether. Outside of human and divine free will, there are no sources\nof contingency. Indeed, the only reason the natural world can be\ncalled contingent at all is because God acts freely and contingently\nin the world as creator and sustainer, not because there is any real\ncontingency in natural causation:\n\n Everything per accidens is brought back to something per\nse; but the contingency per accidens of natural causes\ncannot be brought back to their per se necessary causality,\nbecause the causality of contingency does not follow from necessary\ncausality alone, since a contingent effect does not follow from\nnecessary causes alone; therefore this contingency per accidens\nis brought back to some per se contingency. But not to the\nper se contingency of the human will, since it is not dependent\non the human will; therefore it is brought back to the per se\ncontingency of a separate cause. Therefore the First Cause acts\ncontingently, because if it did not act contingently, nothing in\nthings would come about contingently, but all things would come about\nnecessarily. (d 36, a. 1: Marchia 2000, 34)\n\n Accordingly, were Marchia alive today, he might very well have great\nconfidence in the ability of scientists and their computers to predict\nnatural phenomena, since he would see that to some extent the\n\u201cimperfection of our intellect\u201d and the \u201cbrevity of life\u201d have been\nneutralized:\nTherefore I maintain differently that, as was said, there\nare two kinds of contingent effects: one natural, one voluntary. And\naccording to this I posit two conclusions. The first conclusion is\nthat a contingent natural effect, given the general influence of the\nFirst Cause, can be known determinately by a created intellect,\nalthough not by a human intellect, through its contingent causes. Let\nme explain: every effect that is dependent on a finite number of\ncauses necessarily bringing it about can be known determinately\nthrough its causes by some finite intellect. (This is clear, because\nsince the causes are finite, they can all be comprehended by a finite\nintellect, and if they necessarily cause the effect, the effect can be\nconcluded determinately on the basis of such causes.) But every\ncontingent natural effect is dependent on a finite number of causes\nconcurring and necessarily causing it in a finite number of ways,\ngiven [God\u2019s] general influence. Therefore, every contingent natural\neffect, given [God\u2019s] general influence, can be known determinately by\nsome finite intellect though its contingent causes... [For] although a\ncontingent effect compared to one particular cause can be impeded by\nanother natural cause, compared to the entire order of natural causes\nthat concur all at once the effect cannot be impeded by any natural\ncause. (d. 36, a. 2: Marchia 2000, 38)\n\n\nOne thing is certain: it is hard to resist comparing the scientific\nideas of a medieval scholar to those of later thinkers, even when one\nis vehemently opposed to doing so. Another debate that has arisen over\nMarchia\u2019s scientific theories further illustrates this. One of the\nmost important innovations of the mature Galileo was the assertion\nthat the celestial and terrestrial realms are made of the same\nfundamental matter and therefore follow the same basic natural\nlaws. In the book that inaugurated the renaissance, or rather birth,\nof Marchia studies, Notker Schneider declared that Francis of Marchia\nput forth a hypothesis similar to Galileo\u2019s in his commentary on book\nII of the Sentences, qq. 29\u201332 (Schneider 1991). On the basis\nof texts he himself edited, Schneider maintained that, contrary to\ncontemporary Aristotelian theory, Marchia argues that the heavens are\nnot made up of matter so completely different from terrestrial matter\nthat it radically differentiates the supralunar realm from the\nsublunar one. On the contrary, the basic matter is the same\neverywhere, and just as Marchia considers the natural world to follow\npredictable patterns, he also thinks that those patterns are\nuniversally applicable. These two tenets have important implications\nfor the practice of natural philosophy (Schneider 1991).\n\n Recently, however, it has been argued convincingly that Marchia\u2019s\nadmittedly complicated texts could be read in a different, less\nradical way. Marchia may say that at the most fundamental level the\nmatter in the celestial and the terrestrial realms is the same, since\nthey share \u201cthe same prime matter and thus the same bare\npotentiality,\u201d but practically speaking he drew such strong\ndistinctions that, since their natural potencies are different, the\nlaws applying to each are different (Thakkar 2006). In response to\nthis reinterpretation, one could point out that, even in the\npost-Galilean world, we still think that the celestial and terrestrial\nrealms are really different, just as water and air are radically\ndifferent realms on earth. The search for the luminiferous ether went\non until comparatively recently, and it is still common sense that\nobjects in deep space behave differently from those in our\natmosphere. All agree that the question for future research is whether\nand to what extent Marchia went further than his predecessors and\ncontemporaries.\n\n\nGiven these fascinating debates, it is no wonder that Marchia\u2019s\nphysical theories drew the attention of medieval and modern scholars\nalike. The first important study on Marchia\u2019s thought was Anneliese\nMaier\u2019s partial edition and analysis of book IV, q. 1, of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary (Maier 1940; critical edition Marchia\n2006b; version from Vat. lat. 943 in Marchia 2006c). There Marchia\nputs forth his famous forerunner to John Buridan\u2019s impetus theory of\nprojectile motion. Aristotle had not provided a satisfactory\nexplanation for why, when we throw a ball, for example, the ball keeps\ngoing even after we have released it. Marchia\u2019s explanation was that\nwe leave behind a force in the ball \u2014 a virtus\nderelicta \u2014 that keeps the ball in motion. The fact that\nthis force was temporary rather than permanent meant that it was not\nakin to the inertia theory of classical mechanics, but, as Marchia\nstated explicitly, it was a simple theory and did explain the\nphenomena in temporary projectile motion.\n\n As part of the recent \u201cupsurge\u201d in Marchia studies, his theory of\nvirtus derelicta has also been reconsidered (Zanin 2006b;\nMarchia 2006b, 2006c). It is clear that the basic idea of a force left\nbehind had been circulating for several decades, so Marchia did not\ndevelop the theory ex nihilo. Nevertheless, Marchia appears\nto have spent much more time and energy on projectile motion than his\npredecessors. Aristotle himself did not go on at great length and in\nmuch detail, which probably explains why his theory was so flawed. It\nseems, then, that the scientific problem only became a significant\nissue among natural philosophers with Francis of Marchia. Despite its\nobvious improvement on Aristotle, before the 1330s Marchia\u2019s theory\nwas opposed by his Franciscan successor at Paris Francis of Meyronnes\nand by Meyronnes\u2019 follower Himbert of Garda, another Franciscan,\nalthough it was treated more favorably by Francis Marbres (a.k.a. John the Canon) and the\nFranciscan Nicholas of Bonet. But none of them analyzed it\nextensively. Already in the mid-1320s, however, Gerard Odonis embraced\nit wholeheartedly and in detail. Therefore, although the famous\ntheories put forth by John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the following\ndecades in lengthy discussions differ in some ways from Marchia\u2019s, the\nsimilarities between the theories and the mere fact that Buridan and\nOresme took the issue of projectile motion so seriously surely point\nto Marchia\u2019s impact. In this way, Marchia most probably had an impact\non the development of the theory of inertia.\n\n Yet Marchia did not come up with the theory of inertia, Buridan\u2019s\ntheory of impetus, or Oresme\u2019s modifications to Buridan\u2019s\ntheory. Part of the reason for this is that Marchia presented his idea\nin the context of a discussion of the sacraments. This is not unusual\nfor Marchia: in developing his doctrine on the nature of accidents,\nfor example, the Franciscan theologian began with the miracle of the\nEucharist and modified Aristotelian metaphysics accordingly (Amerini\n2006). Thus for Marchia, projectile motion was just one of many\ninstances where a force was left behind. In essence Marchia wanted a\nunified theory of virtus derelicta that would explain a\nnumber of phenomena, including speaking, seeing, celestial motion, and\nthe conversation of the saints in heaven, in addition to the power of\nthe sacraments and projectile motion. Since some of these phenomena\nwere temporary and not permanent, exhausting themselves without\nexternal resistance, Marchia applied this to the general theory:\nvirtus derelicta is a self-expending and therefore temporary\nforce. Accordingly, Marchia believed that celestial motion was\nprobably not perpetual based on an initial virtus derelicta,\nperhaps left behind by God, although he asserted that it was at least\npossible that, in the heavens, without resistance, the virtus\nderelicta could be incorruptible. Making it a permanent force is\nthe step that Buridan would take. But Buridan was not concerned with\nall those other phenomena. For all we know, Marchia would have\napproved of Buridan\u2019s notion. As it stands, Marchia\u2019s theory,\nespecially in its particular details, \u201cis neither an Aristotelian\nsolution to the problem of projectile motion nor a new development on\nthe road to early modern science; it belongs to a new (but\nsubsequently undeveloped) understanding of motion\u201d (Zanin 2006b,\n81). Nevertheless, if we consider that Marchia appears to have been\nthe first in the West to break with Aristotle so clearly, decisively,\nand prolixly, it is more than likely that his virtus\nderelicta was Buridan\u2019s inspiration.\n\n\nPerhaps medieval scholars did not arrive at inertia because of their\nreluctance to accept and then analyze at length motion in a\nvacuum. One of Aristotle\u2019s arguments for the impossibility of a vacuum\nwas the lack of resistance of the medium. If velocity was a function\nof the proportion of force to the resistance of the medium, then with\nno resistance there would be motion in an instant, something usually\nconsidered an impossibility. In\n book II, q. 16, a. 5\n of his Sentences commentary, however, Marchia has to\nwonder why an angel, which is not a \u201ccorpus quantum,\u201d or\nbodily mass, cannot move instantaneously, i.e. from one place to\nanother without any temporal duration. Part of the answer is simply\nthat it is a contradiction to be two places at once, but Marchia adds\nthat there must be some sort of internal resistance in angels that\nmakes instantaneous motion impossible. The notion of internal\nresistance unrelated to natural place (even though no corpus\nquantum is involved) and the concept of impetus (Buridan\u2019s making\nthe virtus derelicta permanent) appear to be primitive\nversions of the ingredients of a theory of inertial mass. Since\nMarchia\u2019s writings predate those of his more famous successors, the\nOxford Calculators and Buridan and Oresme at Paris, and some of\nhis ideas at least resemble Galileo\u2019s in some way, Marchia\u2019s possible\nimpact on later scientists is a good topic for future research.\n",
