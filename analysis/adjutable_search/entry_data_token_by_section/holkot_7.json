    "main_text": "Divine Command Ethics || Covenantal Theology\n5.1 Covenantal Theology\n\nIn a system of divine command ethics, human beings are obliged to do\nwhat God asks them to do because God commands it, not because there is\nsome underlying system of absolute goodness that ethical precepts\nshould ideally mirror. William Ockham had subscribed to such a view.\nHe had argued that no contradiction would arise if God were to command\nthat the Ten Commandments, the precepts fundamental to both the Old\nand New Laws, were no longer in effect and that from then on people\nwould be obliged to obey their opposites. Most of Ockham\u2019s\nsympathizers backed away from the idea that God could command people\nto hate him, on the grounds that that command, at least, would be\ncontradictory. But Holkot followed Ockham in subscribing to the\nultimate contingency of the decalogue.\n\nWith no act having intrinsic worth, the meritoriousness of human\nbehavior was grounded in a covenant between God and the human\nfaithful. Within the terms of the New Law, God would not deny\nsalvation to all those who did their best to obey his commands and\nadhere to the Articles of the Faith. The causal effect of meritorious\nacts in effecting salvation was a secondary form of causality,\nfunctioning like money, as an agreed upon medium of exchange in the\neconomy of salvation. Because God\u2019s goodness was not a guarantee\nof covenant, however, Holkot stressed that human adherence to the\nterms of the covenant constituted an act of faith that God would\nindeed uphold his promises, even knowing that nothing compels God to\ndo so (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 30\u201332).\n",
