In order to incorporate\nthis thesis into his general epistemology and philosophy of mind,\nLeibniz develops his account of \u201cpetites\nperceptions\u201d or \u201cminute perceptions\u201d mentioned\nbriefly in the section on pre-established harmony. As he puts it in the\nPreface to the New Essays, \u201cat every moment there is in\nus an infinity of perceptions, unaccompanied by awareness or\nreflection; that is, of alterations in the soul itself, of which we are\nunaware because these impressions are either too minute and too\nnumerous, or else too unvarying, so that they are not sufficiently\ndistinctive on their own\u201d (A VI vi 53/RB 53). In other words,\neverything that takes place in the universe really is expressed by each\nfinite mind, but the infinite perceptions present in the mind \u2013\nfrom the butterfly's flight in the Amazonian jungle to the\npenguin's waddling in Antarctica \u2013 are usually too minute\nor too indistinct to outweigh, for example, the appearance of this\ncomputer screen or the feeling of hunger. Indeed, this infinity of\nperceptions is likened by Leibniz to the roar of the sea. \u201cTo\nhear this noise as we do,\u201d Leibniz says, \u201cwe must hear the\nparts which make up this whole, that is the noise of each wave,\nalthough each of these little noises makes itself known only when\ncombined confusedly with all the others, and would not be noticed if\nthe wave which made it were by itself\u201d (A VI vi 54/RB 54). The\ninfinity of petites perceptions is, then, simply epistemological white\nnoise.\n\n\nFor Leibniz, the simplicity and unity of the mind still allows for the\nmultiplicity of perceptions and appetitions. The multiplicity, however,\nshould not only be interpreted as diachronous but also\nsynchronous; that is, the mind despite its simplicity and\nunity has within it at any time an infinity of different\npetites perceptions. A human being, in a waking state, is\nconscious of particular perceptions, but never all. And here we see\nthat Leibniz's doctrine is important, insofar as it offers a\ncontrast to the Cartesian theory of the mind. According to Leibniz, the\nmind is always active, for there are always perceptions\npresent to it, even if those perceptions are minute and do not rise to\nsuch a level that we are cognizant of them. Thus, even in a deep and\ndreamless sleep, the mind is active, and perceptions are in the mind.\nMoreover, if Descartes really did advocate the perfect transparency of\nthe mind, then it should be clear that Leibniz allows for a subtler\npicture of mental contents: there are many things in the mind that are\nconfused and minute and to which we do not always have complete\naccess.\n",
