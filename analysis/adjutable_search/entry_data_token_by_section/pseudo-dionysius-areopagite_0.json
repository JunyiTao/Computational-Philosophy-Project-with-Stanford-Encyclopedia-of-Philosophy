    "main_text": "Dionysius: Persona\n1. Dionysius: Persona\n\nThough Pseudo-Dionysius lived in the late fifth and early sixth\ncentury C.E., his works were written as if they were composed by St.\nDionysius the Areopagite, who was a member of the Athenian judicial\ncouncil (known as \u2018the Areopagus\u2019) in the 1st century C.E.\nand who was converted by St. Paul. Thus, these works might be regarded\nas a successful \u2018forgery\u2019, providing Pseudo-Dionysius with\nimpeccable Christian credentials that conveniently antedated Plotinus\nby close to two hundred years. So successful was this stratagem that\nDionysius acquired almost apostolic authority, giving his writings\nenormous influence in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, though his\nviews on the Trinity and Christ (e.g., his emphasis upon the single\ntheandric activity of Christ (see Letter 4) as opposed to the\nlater orthodox view of two activities) were not always accepted as\northodox since they required repeated defenses, for example, by John\nof Scythopolis and by Maximus Confessor. Dionysius\u2019 fictitious\nidentity, doubted already in the sixth century by Hypatius of Ephesus\nand later by Nicholas of Cusa, was first seriously called into\nquestion by Lorenzo Valla in 1457 and John Grocyn in 1501, a critical\nviewpoint later accepted and publicized by Erasmus from 1504 onward.\nBut it has only become generally accepted in modern times that instead\nof being the disciple of St. Paul, Dionysius must have lived in the\ntime of Proclus, most probably being a pupil of Proclus, perhaps of\nSyrian origin, who knew enough of Platonism and the Christian\ntradition to transform them both. Since Proclus died in 485 CE, and\nsince the first clear citation of Dionysius\u2019 works is by Severus\nof Antioch between 518 and 528, then we can place Dionysius\u2019\nauthorship between 485 and 518\u201328 CE. These dates are confirmed\nby what we find in the Dionysian corpus: a knowledge of Athenian\nNeoplatonism of the time, an appeal to doctrinal formulas and parts of\nthe Christian liturgy (e.g., the Creed) current in the late fifth\ncentury, and an adaptation of late fifth-century Neoplatonic religious\nrites, particularly theurgy, as we shall see below.\n\nIt must also be recognized that \u201cforgery\u201d is a modern\nnotion. Like Plotinus and the Cappadocians before him, Dionysius does\nnot claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a\ntradition. Adopting the persona of an ancient figure was a long\nestablished rhetorical device (known as declamatio), and\nothers in Dionysius\u2019 circle also adopted pseudonymous names from\nthe New Testament. Dionysius\u2019 works, therefore, are much less a\nforgery in the modern sense than an acknowledgement of reception and\ntransmission, namely, a kind of coded recognition that the resonances\nof any sacred undertaking are intertextual, bringing the diachronic\nstructures of time and space together in a synchronic way, and that\nthis theological teaching, at least, is dialectically received from\nanother. Dionysius represents his own teaching as coming from a\ncertain Hierotheus and as being addressed to a certain Timotheus. He\nseems to conceive of himself, therefore, as an in-between figure, very\nlike a Dionysius the Areopagite, in fact. Finally, if Iamblichus and\nProclus can point to a primordial, pre-Platonic wisdom, namely, that\nof Pythagoras, and if Plotinus himself can claim not to be an\noriginator of a tradition (after all, the term Neoplatonism is just a\nconvenient modern tag), then why cannot Dionysius point to a\ndistinctly Christian theological and philosophical resonance in an\nearlier pre-Plotinian wisdom that instantaneously bridged the gap\nbetween Judaeo-Christianity (St. Paul) and Athenian paganism (the\nAreopagite)?
