In its more moderate forms, however,\nmoral Evidentialism is much more attractive and widespread. \u201cYou\nsimply shouldn't believe that about your\nfriend!\u201d\u2014expressed in a context where the friend's\ndisloyalty is not conclusively supported by the evidence\u2014sounds\nto many ears like the expression of a plausible moral obligation (see\nWood 2002, ch. 1\u20133).\n\nMoral rightness and wrongness is analyzed in many different ways, of\ncourse; a moral Evidentialist will presumably either adopt one of\nthose analyses and develop her position accordingly, or show that the\nethics of belief swings free of debates between deontologists,\nconsequentialists, virtue theorists, and the like. No matter which\ntheory of moral rightness and wrongness she adopts, however, there\nwill be the usual questions to settle about whether there are\nthresholds of harm beyond which Evidentialist principles are\nsuspended, even in a deontological context, about whether the\nfundamental objects of moral appraisal in the doxastic context are\nacts or rules, and about whether there is a \u2018unity\u2019 to the\nmoral as well as the intellectual virtues. Again, it is an open and\ninteresting question whether these issues need to be dealt with\ndifferently in an ethics of belief than they are in an ethics of\naction.\n",
