    "main_text": "Life || The turn to natural philosophy\n1.2 The turn to natural philosophy\n\nAt Stalbridge, about 1649, Boyle began to be interested in\nexperimenting, but was hindered by the fact that he could not obtain a\nfurnace. Stalbridge was far enough away from tradespeople who could\nmake such an item and the furnaces Boyle ordered tended to arrive\n\u201ccrumbled into as many pieces, as we into sects,\u201d leaving\nBoyle to attempt \u201csuch experiments, as the unfurnishedness of\nthe place, and the present distractedness of my mind, will permit\nme\u201d (BC 1:50).\n\nBoyle was troubled throughout his life by the fragmentation of\nChristianity. Among \u201cthe giddy multitude \u2026 this\nmultiplicity of religions will end in none at all,\u201d he wrote to\nJohn Mallet in\n 1652,[14]\n and at the very end of his life he expressed in his Will the wish\nthat the Boyle lecturers should, when \u201cproveing the Christian\nReligion against notorious Infidels (viz), Theists, Pagans,\nJews and Mahometans, not [descend] lower to any Controversies that are\namong Christians\n themselves.\u201d[15]\n\nEventually, however, a furnace did arrive, and Boyle found himself\n\u201cso transported and bewitch\u2019d [as to] fancy my Laboratory\na kind of Elysium \u2026 . I there forget my Standish and my Bookes\nand allmost all things\u201d (Boyle to Katherine Ranelagh, Aug 31,\n1649, BC 1:83).\n\nBoyle was never a student at a university. Nor was he ever a fellow of\nan Oxford College, though that too has been claimed on his behalf\n(Dutton 1951, 20), but it was to Oxford that he removed after his time\nat Stalbridge, and it was there that his interest in natural\nphilosophy flowered. Before taking up residence in Oxford however he\npaid two lengthy visits to Ireland during the early 50s (for a year\nfrom June 1652, and then for eight months from Oct 1653), and it was\nfrom that \u201cilliterate country\u201d that he wrote to Clodius,\nprobably toward the end of his second Irish visit, in the spring of\n1654:\n\nFor my part, that I may not live wholly useless, or altogether a\nstranger in the study of nature, since I want glasses and furnaces to\nmake a chemical analysis of inanimate bodies, I am exercising myself\nin making anatomical dissections of living animals: wherein (being\nassisted by your father-in-law\u2019s friend Dr Petty, our\ngeneral\u2019s physician) I have satisfied myself of the circulation\nof the blood, and the (freshly discovered and hardly discoverable)\nreceptaculum chyli, made by the confluence of the venae\n lactae;[16]\n and have seen (especially in the dissections of fishes) more of the\nvariety and contrivances of nature, and the majesty and wisdom of her\nauthor, than all the books I ever read in my life could give me\nconvincing notions of (BC 1:167).\n\n\nIt was also during this period, no doubt in large part due to\nCromwell\u2019s extremely harsh treatment of the Irish, that\nBoyle\u2019s Irish properties were made secure and began returning\nrents to him, ultimately reaching almost \u00a33000 p.a., Hooke told\nAubrey. The fact that Boyle\u2019s friend Petty conducted the survey\non which the disposal of the lands was based can hardly have been to\nBoyle\u2019s disadvantage.\n\nOn October 12, 1655, Katherine was in Oxford investigating the\nsuitability of possible lodgings for Boyle. He was to lodge with the\napothecary John Crosse, whom Birch felt worthy of mention because he\nhad \u201ca great acquaintance with Dr. John\n Fell,\u201d[17]\n and the question was, which was the best room for his purposes, and\nhow was it to be furnished?\n\nMy Brother,\n\nIt has pleased god to bring us safe to oxford & I am lodged at Mr\nCrosses with designe to be able to give you from experience an\naccoumpt which is the warmest roome, & indeed I am satisfied with\nneither of them as to that poynt, because the doores are placed soe\njust by the Chimeys that if you have the benifit of the fier you must\nventure haveing the inconvenience of the wind, which yet may be helped\nin either by a folding skreen & then I think that which lookes\ninto the garden wilbe the more Comfortable\u2026 (BC 1:193).\n\n\nThe house in question stood on the site where the Shelley Memorial now\nstands, and his two rooms there seem to have served Boyle admirably,\nthough he later set up a retreat at Stanton St John\u2019s, where he\ncould retire when the press of society grew too great in Oxford.\n\nIn Oxford Boyle\u2019s tremendous output of works in philosophy,\ntheology, and experimental philosophy began. It was here that he\npublished New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring\nof Air and its Effects, Certain Physiological Essays, The Sceptical\nChymist, Some Considerations touching the Usefulness of Experimental\nNatural Philosophy, and a number of others including The\nOrigine of Forms and Qualities.\n\nBoyle\u2019s years in London (from 1668 to his death) saw the\ncontinuation of his experimental work, along with a number of works on\nphilosophy and theology, including The Excellency of Theology,\nCompar\u2019d with Natural Philosophy, Considerations About\nthe Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis, the\nFree Enquiry into the Vulgarly Receiv\u2019d Notion of\nNature, the Discourse of things above Reason, Disquisition\nabout the Final Causes of Natural Things, and The Christian\nVirtuoso.\n\nIn 1691 Katherine died, and Boyle, whose health throughout his life\nhad been poor, died the following week.\n",
