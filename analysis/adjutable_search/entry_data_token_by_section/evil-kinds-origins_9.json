    "main_text": "Radical Evil: Four Conceptions\n7. Radical Evil: Four Conceptions\n\nKant is the source of \u201cradical evil\u201d, but his way of using\nthe term is now out of favor. In fact, most people writing on this\nissue use the term in a precisely non-Kantian way to refer to\nsomething spectacularly excessive\u2014an act or event whose badness\nis deeper and more mysterious than the badness of ordinary states or\nactivities (Bernstein 2002).\n\nIn her famous account of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem,\nArendt (1963) promoted the idea that even the worst evils can be\n\u201cbanal\u201d and bureaucratical. A decade earlier, however, she\nconceived of \u201cradical evil\u201d quite differently. In a March\n1951 letter to Karl Jaspers she wrote:\n\n\nWe know that the greatest evils or radical evil has nothing to do\nanymore with humanly understandable, sinful motives. What radical evil\nis I don\u2019t know, but it seems to me to somehow have to do with\nthe following phenomenon: making human beings as human beings\nsuperfluous. (Arendt & Jaspers 1992: 166, emphasis added)\n\n\nArendt went on in the letter to insist that \u201cmaking human beings\nas human beings superfluous\u201d is not the same as treating them as\n\u201cmere means to an end\u201d. She thus rejected the Kantian view\nthat radical evil\u2014no matter how benign or awful the\neffects\u2014has its root (Latin: radix) in the willful\nviolation of the categorical imperative by individual free agents (see\nLouden 2010: 98).\n\nJaspers\u2019s view of radical evil, by contrast, was consistently\nnon-exotic and Kantian: \u201cthere is evil because there is freedom.\nIt is only possible for the will alone to be evil\u201d\n(Jaspers 1947 [1958: 532], emphasis added). According to one\ncommentator, this focus on human freedom as the root of all\nevil is \u201csignificant and commendable\u201d:\n\n\nKant [and following him Jaspers] refuses to cater to our prurient\ncraving for a special account that applies especially to the most\nextreme cases of evil\u2026. He fears that occupying our\nimaginations with extreme cases of evil may be merely a way of\nindulging some of our nastier human traits\u2014rationalizing our\nresentment and vindictiveness by supplying it with an object that\nwould seem to justify it. (Wood 2010: 157)\n\n\nThe concerns expressed in these passages are common in discussions of\nthe nature and origins of evil. Call them Jaspersian concerns\nfor short. They are second-order concerns about how we should conceive\nand speak of evil, especially when calling it \u201cradical\u201d.\nThe concerns fall into two broad kinds: (1) concerns about\nexoticizing wrongdoing with excess-locutions like\n\u201cevil\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d; and (2) concerns about\ntainting people and things that are touched by such evil,\nbeyond the straightforward condemnation of the perpetrators (for more\non such concerns, see Card 2002, Cole 2006, and Calder 2013\n[2018]).\n\nThe Kantian conception of radical evil is considered in the next\nsub-section. Sections 7.2\u20137.4 survey three other conceptions and\nlook at how each might raise Jaspersian concerns.\n",
