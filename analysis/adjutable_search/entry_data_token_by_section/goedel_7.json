G\u00f6del\u2019s Philosophical Views\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views can be broadly characterized by\ntwo points of focus, or, in modern parlance, commitments. These are:\nrealism, namely the belief that mathematics is a descriptive science\nin the way that the empirical sciences are. The second commitment is\nto a form of Leibnizian rationalism in philosophy; and in fact\nG\u00f6del\u2019s principal philosophical influences, in this regard\nparticularly but also many others, were Leibniz, Kant and Husserl.\n(For further discussion of how these philosophers influenced\nG\u00f6del, see van Atten and Kennedy 2003.)\n\nThe terms \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s realism\u201d and\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism\u201d must be prefaced with a\ndisclaimer: there is no single view one could associate with each of\nthese terms. G\u00f6del\u2019s realism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, in both the nature of its ontological claims as\nwell as in G\u00f6del\u2019s level of commitment to those claims.\nSimilarly G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism underwent a complex\ndevelopment over time, from a tentative version of it at the\nbeginning, to what was adjudged to be a fairly strong version of it in\nthe 1950s. Around 1959 and for some time afterward G\u00f6del fused\nhis rationalistic program of developing exact philosophy with the\nphenomenological method as developed by Husserl.\n\nWe examine these two strains of G\u00f6del\u2019s thinking below:\n",
