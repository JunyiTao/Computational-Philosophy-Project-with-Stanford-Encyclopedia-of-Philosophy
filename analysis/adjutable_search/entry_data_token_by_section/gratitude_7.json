    "main_text": "The Elements of the Grateful Response || Ingratitude and Overgratitude\n3.5 Ingratitude and Overgratitude\n\nClarity on the elements of the grateful response is critical for\ndeveloping an accurate account of what gratitude actually is (see\n section 4\n below); but it also helps clarify several ways in which a beneficiary\nwho owes gratitude can fail to be properly grateful. In the first\nplace, knowing the elements of the grateful response sheds light on\nall the ways a beneficiary can be ungrateful.\nIngratitude (the state of being ungrateful) can be thought of\nas the absence or deficiency of one or more of the elements of the\ngrateful response when gratitude is in fact called for in a particular\nbeneficiary. A beneficiary, then, can be ungrateful in one (or more)\nof several ways. Forgetfulness, apathy, pride and laziness, for\ninstance, are all generally characterized as vices or shortcomings in\nthemselves; but when they result in the absence or deficiency of\ngrateful memory, grateful feelings, a willingness to acknowledge a\nbenefactor\u2019s benevolence, or grateful reciprocity in a\nbeneficiary, they may very well also amount to species of ingratitude\n(Aquinas II\u2013II, q. 104, art. 2; Manela 2019). We might label\nthese species of ingratitude with reference to the shortcomings in the\nelements by which they are constituted: cognitive\ningratitude for the inattentive or forgetful beneficiary;\naffective ingratitude for the coldhearted or apathetic\nbeneficiary; expressive ingratitude for the overly prideful\nbeneficiary, and conative or motivational\ningratitude for the lazy beneficiary. Ungrateful beneficiaries\nmay, of course, instantiate more than one species of ingratitude in\nresponse to the same instance of beneficence.\n\nWithin the category of ingratitude, Aquinas (II\u2013II, q. 104, art.\n3) points to another helpful distinction. A beneficiary can be\nungrateful by having a certain element of the grateful response to an\ninsufficient degree (e.g., not being willing enough to help a\nbenefactor in need; not being quite pleased enough when a benefactor\nfares well; etc.). Manela (2019) calls this sub-gratitude. A\nbeneficiary can also be ungrateful by having and instantiating the\nopposite or negation of some particular element. For\ninstance, in response to a genuine act of benevolence, a beneficiary\nmight actually come to resent his benefactor; and rather than feeling\nany motivation to benefit her in the future, he may find himself\ninclined to set back her interests. These tendencies might arise out\nof envious reflection on how morally superior a benefactor\u2019s\nbenevolence makes her. Manela (2019) labels this type of ingratitude\nanti-gratitude. \n\nIngratitude is not the only way a beneficiary might reprehensibly fail\nto have an appropriate degree of the elements of the grateful\nresponse. Several philosophers have noted that an\noverabundance of any of the elements of gratitude, beyond the\nlevel called for by some genuine act of benevolence, might also\nconstitute a moral failing of a certain kind. Card (1988), for\ninstance, writes that grateful beliefs or feelings toward someone who\nhas not earned them might be a mark of servility, or a lack\nof self-respect, on the part of the beneficiary who has them. Manela\n(2018; 2019) calls this moral failing overgratitude. It is\nimportant to note, however, that a beneficiary may go beyond what\ngratitude calls for without being servile. An extravagant thank-you\ngift might not necessarily signal servility on the part of a\nbeneficiary, if he did not sacrifice excessively in giving it, or\noverestimate the favor his benefactor did for him, even if he might\nhave been properly grateful in presenting his benefactor with a less\nextravagant gift.\n",
