    "main_text": "Space, Time and Motion || Space (dik)\n3.1 Space (dik)\n\nThe Manual of Reason\u2019s remarks on the nature of space\nand time are sketchy in the extreme. We must supplement them with\ndetails from other Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Ny\u0101ya authors. Even\nthen, the theories of space and time found in\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika texts have been studied very little,\nand we can only form a rough and inadequate picture at the present\ntime. The Manual of Reason\u2019s observations concerning\nthe notion of space are as follows:\n\nSpace is a substance (TS3)\nSpace is the \u2018ground\u2019 for statements such as\n\u201cthis is east of that\u201d etc. (TS 16)\nSpace is unique, ubiquitous, and eternal (TS16).\nSpace is an instrumental cause of every effect (TSD16).\n\u2018Nearness\u2019 (aparatva) and\n\u2018farness\u2019 (paratva) are spatial qualities of\nobjects.\n\n\nSpace is conceived of as that substance in virtue of which statements\nattributing distance and direction, such as \u201cA is to\nthe east of B\u201d (or \u201cA is near to\nB\u201d, \u201cA is nearer to B than to\nC\u201d, etc.) are objectively true or false. Space is thus\nan explanatory postulate: it is argued that we must postulate the\nexistence of a new (spatial) substance to explain the fact that\nobjects stand in spatial relations with one another. The problem is to\nmake sense of this claim. Bhaduri (1947: 216\u20137) does so as\nfollows (I paraphrase his account):\n\nImagine a sequence of objects A, B, C,\nD, \u2026, F, each in contact with the next,\narranged in a line. Now A is to the left of B, and\nB is to the left of C, and since \u201cbeing to the\nleft of\u201d is a transitive relation, A is to the left of\nC, etc. But, although A is in contact with\nB, and B is in contact with C, it is not\ntrue that A is in contact with C\u2014contact is\natransitive. Thus contact cannot be what spatially relates objects.\nWhat then? \u201cAccording the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, it is space\nwhich brings [A and C] into relation. Both are in\nconjunction with space and thus with each other through its mediation.\nSpace is that which turns the relation of conjunction into a\ntransitive relation\u201d (Bhaduri).\n\n\nThis explanation has a problem. It assumes that between any two bodies\nthere is a chain of touching material objects. But, given this\nassumption, we do not need to postulate a new substance with which\neverything is in contact, in order to create a transitive relation\nfrom contact. For we can define \u201cbeing to the left of\u201d\nthus: x is to the left of y iff there are distinct\nobjects p, q, r,\u2026t such\nthat x is in contact with p, p is in\ncontact with q, \u2026, t is in contact with\ny.\n\nPotter (1977: 92) refines the argument. We say that A is\nnearer to D than to F because there are more\nintervening objects between A and F than there are\nbetween A and D. Suppose however that between\nD and F there is no chain of material objects. How\nis it that we can still say \u201cA is nearer to D\nthan to F\u201d? Potter answers: \u201cIn order to provide\nthe material to explain this comparative judgement we must postulate\nan intervening series of entities, and these must be spatial\u201d.\nNote that this explains, not the transitivity of directional relations\nlike \u201cto the left of\u201d, but rather the magnitude of\ndistance relations like \u201cnear to\u201d. \u201cNear to\u201d\nis not a transitive relation. It accepts the basic premise that the\ndistance between two objects is measured in terms of the number of\nintervening entities, and postulates a series of \u201cspatial\nentities\u201d when there are no material ones present.\n\nThis explanation also has a problem, for space is supposed to be a\nsingle entity. Perhaps it should say that the two objects are in\ncontact with a \u2018segment\u2019 of space, and spatial segments\nhave magnitude.\n\nPerhaps the best way to construe the argument is as offering an\nexplanation of spatial separation without having to postulate\na series of mediating bodies. Thus, if A is nearer to\nD than F, and there is nothing either between\nA and D or between A and F, the\nbest explanation is that D is in contact with a nearer part\nof space than F.\n\nThe Manual of Reason says that space is\n\u2018ubiquitous\u2019 (vibhu), which it defines as\n\u2018being in contact with every sample of earth, air, fire, water\n(and \u2018mind\u2019) (TS14). This raises the question: is space\ninfinite in dimension, or the same size as the cosmos? If space is\ndefined in terms of the relations between physical objects, then it\nwould seem to have the same size as the cosmos. There are however\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika arguments that it is infinite. The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas say that most bodies are either\n\u2018long\u2019 (d\u012brgha) or \u2018short\u2019\n(hrasva) in dimension (TS25, Bhaduri 1947: 118), but that a\nbody\u2019s having \u2018long\u2019 or \u2018short\u2019\ndimension is unintelligible unless it has bounding, perimeter parts.\nSpace, however, has no parts and hence no boundary. Some\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas conclude that space has no finite dimension\n(i.e. is infinite); others that it has a special dimension called\n\u2018paramad\u012brgha\u2019 or \u2018maximal\nlength\u2019.\n",
