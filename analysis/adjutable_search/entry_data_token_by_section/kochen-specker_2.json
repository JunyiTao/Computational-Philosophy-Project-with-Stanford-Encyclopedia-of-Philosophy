    "main_text": "Statement and Proof of the KS Theorem || Statement of the KS Theorem\n3.1 Statement of the KS Theorem\n\n\nAn explicit statement of the KS theorem runs thus: \nLet H be a Hilbert space of QM state vectors of\n dimension x \u2265 3. There is a set M of observables on H, \ncontaining y elements, such that the following two assumptions are\ncontradictory: \n\n\n\n(KS1) All y members of M simultaneously have values,\ni.e.  are unambiguously mapped onto real numbers (designated, for\nobservables A, B, C, \u2026, by\nv(A), v(B),\nv(C), \u2026).\n\n\n(KS2) Values of all observables in M conform to the following\nconstraints:\n(a) If A, B, C are all\ncompatible and C = A+B, then\nv(C) =\nv(A)+v(B);\n\n\n\n(b) if A, B, C are all compatible and\nC = A\u00b7B, then v(C)\n= v(A)\u00b7v(B).\n\n\n\n\nAssumption KS1 of the theorem obviously is an equivalent of VD.\nAssumptions KS2 (a) and (b) are called the Sum Rule and the\nProduct Rule, respectively, in the literature. (The reader\nshould again note that, in opposition to von Neumann\u2019s implicit\npremise, these rules non-trivially relate the values of\ncompatible observables only.) Both are consequences of a\ndeeper principle called the functional composition principle (FUNC),\nwhich in turn is a consequence of (among other assumptions) NC. The\nconnection between NC, FUNC, Sum Rule and Product Rule will be made\nexplicit in Section 4.\n\nThe KS Theorem claims the existence of a set M with a certain property \n(i.e. being such that KS1 and KS2 are \ncontradictory)[6] \nand the proof proceeds by explicitly presenting such a set, for different\nchoices of x and y.  In the original KS proof x=3\nand y=117. More\nrecently proofs involving less observables have been given by (among\nmany others) Peres (1991, 1995) for x=3 and y=33, by\nKernaghan (1994) for x=4 and y=20 and by Cabello\net al. (1996) for x=4 and y=18. The KS\nproof is notoriously complex, and we will only sketch it in Section\n3.4. The Peres proof establishes the KS result in full strength, with\ngreat simplicity, and, moreover, in an intuitively accessible way,\nsince it operates in three dimensions; we refer the reader to Peres\n(1995: 197\u201399). The proofs by Kernaghan and Cabello et\nal. each establish a contradiction in four dimensions. These are\nweaker results, of course, than the KS theorem (since every\ncontradiction in 3 dimensions is also a contradiction in higher\ndimensions, but not conversely). However, these other proofs are very\nsimple and instructive. Moreover, it can be shown (Pavi\u010di\u0107\net al. 2005) that y=18 is the lowest number for\nwhich the KS theorem holds true, so we start by presenting the proof\nof Cabello and his co-workers in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.5,\nwe explain an argument by Clifton (1993) where x=3 and\ny=8 and an additional statistical assumption yields an easy\nand instructive KS argument.\n",
