    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Neurons and Brain\n1.2 Neurons and Brain\n\nA neuroscientific explanation of consciousness adduces properties of\nthe brain, typically the brain\u2019s electrical properties. A\nsalient phenomenon is neural signaling through action\npotentials or spikes. A spike is a large change in\nelectrical potential across a neuron\u2019s cellular membrane which\ncan be transmitted between neurons that form a neural circuit. For a\nsensory neuron, the spikes it generates are tied to its receptive\nfield. For example, in a visual neuron, its receptive field is\nunderstood in spatial terms and corresponds to that area of external\nspace where an appropriate stimulus triggers the neuron to spike.\nGiven this correlation between stimulus and spikes, the latter carries\ninformation about the former. Information processing in sensory\nsystems involves processing of information regarding stimuli within\nreceptive fields.\n\nWhich electrical property provides the most fruitful explanatory basis\nfor understanding consciousness remains an open question. For example,\nwhen looking at a single neuron, neuroscientists are not interested in\nspikes per se but the spike rate generated by a neuron per unit time.\nYet spike rate is one among many potentially relevant neural\nproperties. Consider the blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD)\nmeasure in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The BOLD\nsignal is a measure of changes in blood flow in the brain when neural\ntissue is active and is postulated to be a function of electrical\nproperties at a different part of a neuron than that part tied to\nspikes. Specifically, given a synapse which is the connection\nbetween two neurons to form a basic circuit motif, spikes are tied to\nthe presynaptic side while the BOLD signal is thought to be a\nfunction of electrical changes on the postsynaptic side\n(signal flow is from pre to post). Furthermore, neuroscientists are\ntypically not interested in the response of a single neuron but rather\nthat of a population of neurons, of whole brain regions, and/or their\ninteractions. Higher order properties of brain regions include the\nlocal field potential generated by populations of neurons and\ncorrelated activity such as synchrony between activity in\ndifferent areas of the brain (neural oscillations were postulated to\nbe central to consciousness by Crick & Koch 1990).\n\nThe number of neural properties potentially relevant to explaining\nmental phenomena is dizzying. This review focuses on the facts that\nneural sensory systems carry information about the subject\u2019s\nenvironment and that neural information processing can be tied to a\nnotion of neural representation. How precisely to understand\nneural representation is itself a vexed question (Cao 2012, 2014; Shea\n2014), but we will deploy a simple assumption with respect to spikes\nwhich can be reconfigured for other properties: where a sensory neuron\ngenerates spikes when a stimulus is placed in its receptive field, the\nspikes carry information about the stimulus (strictly speaking, about\na random variable). Information as used in neuroscience is\ntypically not a semantic notion, but bearing in mind that caveat, it\nwill simplify matters to speak of a sensory neuron\u2019s activity as\nrepresenting the relevant aspect of the stimulus that drives\nthe neuron\u2019s response (e.g., direction of motion or intensity of\na\n sound).[2]\n This way of speaking is imprecise, so we shall return to neural\nrepresentation in the final section when discussing how neural\nrepresentations might explain conscious contents.\n",
