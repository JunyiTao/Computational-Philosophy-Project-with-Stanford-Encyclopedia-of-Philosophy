    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logic || Nominalism\n4.3 Nominalism\n\n \nWe noted that Le\u015bniewski, persuaded by his argument against\nTwardowski\u2019s general objects, was a nominalist. It was no doubt part\nof his antipathy towards set theory. His friend Kotarbi\u0144ski\nformulated a very extreme nominalism, called variously reism,\npansomatism, and concretism, according to which the only things that\nexist are material bodies. Le\u015bniewski would not go this far,\nbecause he did not see how after-images and dreamt things, which he\nthought existed, could be material bodies. But in elaborating his\nlogic he emphatically rejects anything which is not concrete,\nindividual, located in space and time. This goes for the logical\nsystems themselves. His view, which would nowadays be called\ninscriptionalism, is that logical systems are actual\ncollections of concrete marks, whether printed on paper in books and\njournals, or in handwritten notes, or more ephemerally as spoken\nwords, chalk marks on blackboards, or (nowadays) patterns on computer\nscreens. Leaving aside the non-trivial metaphysical question of what\ncan in principle count as a logical inscription, we must consider what\neffect this stance had on his attitude to logic and logic systems.\n\n The effect is far-reaching and radical. If a logical system is a\nconcrete complex of signs, then it cannot be infinite. Also, to\nconform to logical practice, it has to be admitted that logical\nsystems change over time. Ideally, they change by being added to, as\nnew theorems are proved. In practice, they may degrade or be wholly\ndestroyed, which was indeed the sad fate of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own\npersonally written systems in November 1944. If a logical system is\npublished in a book or journal, and there are several copies, then\nthere are as many such systems as there are copies. Assuming the\ncopies are all faithful, then each copy is typographically exactly\nlike all the others. They are, in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s parlance, all\nequiform. In practice of course, equiformity is not quite\nexact, even in printed works, but the minute variations are\ninsignificant, and in any case we wish to recognize handwritten\nmanuscripts and other variants to be equiform for logical purposes\nwith systems which are physically somewhat different. Again the\nmetaphysical fine detail is less important that the fact that we get\nby most of the time with constrainedly inexact similarity.\n\n Almost all metalogical ways of dealing with logical systems are\nplatonistic. They assume that the simple and complex expressions are\nabstract types, that they are infinite in number, that an axiom system\nhas infinitely many logical theorems, and so on. Le\u015bniewski can\nadmit none of this. So he has to find a way to deal with logical\nsystems as something organic, growing and changing with time. He does\nso by employing a complex system of metalogical definitions, which he\ncalls \u2018terminological explanations\u2019, and inference rules,\nwhich he calls \u2018directives\u2019. In effect Le\u015bniewski\ngives a schematic grammatical and logical framework for an\nindefinitely extensible language, decades in advance of the advent of\nformal descriptions of computer programming languages, which are the\nnearest equivalent elsewhere.\n\n It is hard to give a flavor of the terminological explanations (TEs)\nin a short space: their complexity and cumulative effect has to\nappreciated at first hand. The most thorough account is in the TEs for\nProtothetic in Grundz\u00fcge, Section 11, and there is also\na compressed account of TEs for Ontology. A somewhat more manageable\nset for a version of propositional calculus with definitions, based on\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s bracketless notation, is given in the 1931 paper\n\u2018\u00dcber Definitionen in der sogenannten Theorie der\nDeduktion\u2019, and based on lectures from 1930\u201331. There\nLe\u015bniewski gives TEs in words rather than symbolic abbreviations,\nand with copious examples. Nevertheless, it is intellectually\nchallenging, since for all the complex TEs (metalogical definitions),\nLe\u015bniewski demanded logical independence of all the various\nclauses, to be shown by suitable models. As a result, it took graduate\nstudents three semesters to work through a set of TEs in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s seminar (personal information from Czes\u0142aw\nLejewski) .\n\nThe TEs are a means to an end: that of formulating a system\u2019s\ndirectives. A directive sounds like an imperative, but its\nillocutionary force is subtler. Assume a logical system has been\ndeveloped up to a certain point, that is, up to a certain last written\nthesis (Le\u015bniewski\u2019s word covering axioms, theorems and\ndefinitions). At the very least, the axiom or axioms will have been\nwritten down. Assume for the sake of argument that the development has\nbeen fine up to now. There is no categorical imperative to extend the\nsystem by adding another thesis, but let us suppose the system\u2019s\nauthor (or indeed any assistant) wishes to do so. He or she writes\ndown a new collection of marks. Not just anything goes however. The\nmarks have to be legible (obviously), unequivocally dissectible into\nelementary symbols (that Le\u015bniewski calls words),\ngrammatically well-formed as a sentence (no unbound variables are\nallowed), and finally admissible according to the\ndirectives. The directives lay down what may be admitted next\nafter a given sequence of theses. For example, the next thesis may be\nan instantiation from a previous universally quantified thesis, or a\nmodus ponens from two previous theses, or a quantifier\ndistribution from a previous thesis, or a definition acceptable\naccording to the canons, or a thesis of extensionality. Admissibility\nis always relativized to the prior sequence: the order of introduction\nmatters. If the new candidate thesis is admissible according to one of\nthe directives, it passes the test and becomes part of the system,\nwhich can then be extended still further. Otherwise it is rejected and\nthe system is not extended.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s supreme achievement as a logician, in his own eyes,\nwas to formulate the metalogical requirements for extending a concrete\nsystem by directives, relative to the previous state of the\nsystem. Since the system is not planned or fixed in advance, the TEs\nand directives have to be schematically flexible enough to accommodate\nany future additions, while not being so liberal as to allow\ncontradictions or nonsense to arise. Finding that balance, most\nespecially in the rules for admissible definitions, was a considerable\nfeat. The definition of \u2018definition\u2019 for Protothetic run\nto 18 separate complex clauses, and in Ontology, which adds a second\nstyle of definition, another 18 clauses.\n\n Definitions, which seem so peripheral to most logical systems, are in\nfact key to the potential power of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logic. The axioms\nof a system generally use very few semantic categories near the bottom\nof the recursive hierarchy. It is by definitions that new semantic\ncategories are introduced into the system; once a new category is in,\nvariables for it may be introduced and quantified, a thesis of\nextensionality formulated for it, and it can provide arguments for\nfurther, higher-level functors. So although, unlike a typed logic\nconceived platonistically, only finitely many types or categories are\nactually in play in any one system, the potential to go on is\nrestricted only by contingent limitations.\n\n The easiest way to get an idea of how definitions work in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logic is not to look at the published work on\nMereology or Protothetic, but at the extended list of\n\u201cDefinitions and Theses of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Ontology\u201d\nfrom S. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Lecture Notes on Logic, published\nin 1988. Taken from student notes of a 1929\u201330 lecture\ncourse \u2018Elementary Outline of Ontology\u2019, they comprise one\naxiom, 59 definitions and 633 listed (not proved) theorems, covering\nsyllogistic, Boolean algebra, the notions of property(-predicate) and\nhigher-order property, relations, higher-order epsilons, and several\nchunks of the theory of relations including converses, fields and\nrelative products, as known from Peirce, Schr\u00f6der, Whitehead and\nRussell. Not coincidentally, the sketched development includes a large\nnumber of styles of parentheses.\n",
