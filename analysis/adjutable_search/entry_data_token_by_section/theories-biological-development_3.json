    "main_text": "Eighteenth-Century Debates\n4. Eighteenth-Century Debates\n\nShirley Roe\u2019s discussion of the eighteenth-century debates is an\nexcellent examination of the context. Enthusiasm for scientific study\nof natural phenomena of all sorts was combined with particular\ninterest in natural history and changes over time and with newly\navailable microscopic methods to stimulate interest in development\n(Roe 1981). Aristotelian epigenesis still provided the background\nassumptions about individual development as the eighteenth century\nbegan, and researchers sought to observe the gradual emergence of form\nfrom non-form. Yet Aristotelian accounts called for the efficacy of\nthe causes, acting through the process of ensoulment. In effect, this\ninterpretation of epigenesis depended on a life force within the\norganism driving its emergence of form. Those who accepted epigenesis\nalso accepted a form of vitalism (see Detlefsen 2006, Zammito 2018 for\nmore on early modern vitalism debates).\n\nMatter in motion, by itself, would not seem to have the capacity to\nproduce these results. How could unformed matter become formed? How\ncould the emerging form acquire capacity to function without some\nvital force or factor that was not strictly material? This was the\nproblem for materialists. Those who began with a materialist\nmetaphysics, assuming that all that can exist is matter in motion,\ncould not see how gradual epigenetic emergence of form could occur.\nThe early modern period brought debates between those who started from\nmetaphysical assumptions of materialism and those who started from\nepistemological assumptions that empirical observation should provide\nthe basis for scientific knowledge.\n\nOne popular representation of the alternative, preformationist view\nwas the homunculus. Whether initially intended seriously or as a way\nto capture alternative ideas, the idea of a tiny preformed little\nperson did capture attention. Nicolaas von Hartsoeker gave us the\nimage in 1694 of a tiny man in the sperm, which became the starting\npoint for spermists. Others, ovists, accepted the idea of a preformed\norganism\u2014but in the egg rather than sperm. Both views are\npreformationism taken quite literally. The form that the individual\nadult organism would assume was, physically and materially, preformed\nfrom the earliest stages of development. The subsequent process was\njust growth.\n\nNot all preformationists took their preformationism quite so literally\nor graphically. But that view did present a competing alternative to\nAristotelian epigenesis by the eighteenth century (see Bowler 1971,\nPinto-Correia 1997). As Iris Fry has argued in her study of origins of\nlife debates, only with preformation could a materialistic mechanist\nbe a good Christian in the eighteenth century (Fry 2000: 26, citing\nFarley 1977: 29). This debate played out, for example, in the work of\nCaspar Friedrich Wolff and Charles Bonnet, both looking at chick\ndevelopment (Detlefsen 2006). They looked at the same thing and even\nfundamentally agreed about what they saw, but their conclusions were\nquite different. This story can be seen as a debate about scientific\ntheory. Wolff was an epigenesist, maintaining that form emerges only\ngradually. Bonnet was a preformationist, insisting that form exists\nfrom the beginning of each individual organism and only experiences\ngrowth over time. In addition to these theoretical and epistemological\nissues, there is also a story about metaphysics. The eighteenth\ncentury brought debates between metaphysical materialists who were\nforced into preformationism, and epistemological epigenesists who\nobserved form emerging only gradually and who were willing to accept\nvitalism as the only apparent causal explanation for the emergence of\nform from the not-formed (Roe 1981; Maienschein 2000; Nicoglou &\nWolfe 2018 [and references therein]; Wolfe 2021).\n",
