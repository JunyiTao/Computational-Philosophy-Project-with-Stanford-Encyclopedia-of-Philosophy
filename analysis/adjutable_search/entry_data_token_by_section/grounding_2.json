    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Regimentation\n1.2 Regimentation\n\nTo regiment grounding discourse is to adopt a formal language in which\nwe can precisely formulate grounding claims. A regimentation includes\nvarious linguistic policies, including ones specifying which syntactic\nforms we should use to express grounding relationships. There are two\ngeneral approaches to regimentation. On the first approach,\nregimentation is chiefly pragmatic in nature. In this case, we might\nregiment in one way rather than another merely because doing so will,\nsay, make a certain complicated argument or idea easier to follow or\nunderstand. On the second approach, our choices concerning\nregimentation are guided by the goal of accurately describing the\nstructure of reality.\n\nAs for the regimentations themselves, two general frameworks have\nemerged: predicationists formulate grounding claims with a\nrelational predicate, one corresponding to the English predicate\ngrounds (Audi 2012a; Schaffer 2009; Rosen 2010).\nConnectivists use a non-truth-functional sentential\nconnective instead, one corresponding to the English operator\nbecause (Fine 2012a; Correia 2010; Schneider 2011). Full\nblown connective regimentations will include a logic of grounding,\nwhich on Fine\u2019s (2012a, 2012b) development includes structural\nrules and properties (e.g., transitivity) and logical rules including\nintroduction and elimination rules. (See Poggiolesi 2020 for a general\ndiscussion of the logic of grounding.) Note that each of these\napproaches to regimentation is compatible with both separatism and\nunionism (Kovacs 2018: note 28). For further context, note that there\nis corresponding discussion regarding the proper formulation of\ntruthmaking claims (Melia 2005).\n\nSome claim that a potentially relevant consideration here concerns\nontological commitment (Correia 2010). All other things being equal,\nif one way of formulating grounding claims has fewer ontological\ncommitments than another, then the former is preferable to the latter.\nSuppose that the connectivist\u2019s connective is understood to be\nnon-committal, so as not to commit us to a grounding operation. And\nsuppose that the predicationist\u2019s predicate is understood to\ncommit us to a grounding relation between facts. In this case, it may\nbe that connectivism has an advantage over predicationism\u2014this\ndepends on whether there are countervailing considerations (e.g., the\nconnective treatment may be relatively cumbersome to work with). But\nnote that the predicationist, of course, might claim that their\npredicate is non-committal (nominalists, for example, dispute that\nrelational terms commit us to properties and relations), and perhaps\nthere are reasons to think that the connectivist\u2019s connective\ncommits us to a grounding operation. The moral is that we need to\nestablish which terms are committal before any claims of minimizing\ncommitment can be made. (Also, note that, with respect to the\npotential commitments of predicationism, we may have different\nattitudes about relations and facts\u2014you might be happy to\ncountenance facts but not relations or vice versa.)\n\nWhile we will introduce some symbols for expressing facts below, we\nwon\u2019t adopt any particular formal language for expressing\ngrounding relationships, so we needn\u2019t adopt either\npredicationism or connectivism. For ease of presentation, however, we\nwill formulate grounding claims with the predicate grounds\nand speak as if this predicate expresses a relation\u2014the\ngrounding relation\u2014such that collections of one or more facts\nground particular facts. (See, however, Dasgupta 2014b and Litland\n2018a for bicollective conceptions of grounding according to which\ncollections of facts can be non-distributivity grounded.) Where\nP is an English sentence, let \\([P]\\) be a function from\nP to the fact it corresponds to. So [Gomer is a good dog] is\nthe fact that Gomer is a good dog. (We will also indicate propositions\nin the same manner using angle rather than square brackets.) We assume\nthat grounding is factive in the following sense: \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\) only if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 and\n\\([Q]\\) obtain. Much of what we go on to say can be captured without\nrecourse to relations and facts, but we won\u2019t attempt to provide\nsuch translations.\n\nBefore proceeding, we should note that some formulate grounding claims\nin such a way that all manner of things potentially ground one\nanother, not just facts (Cameron 2008; Schaffer 2009; Wilhelm 2020).\nThe theses of separatism and unionism are relevant here (see\n \u00a71.1).\n Given unionism (grounding is explanationG), the\nrestriction to facts seems quite reasonable. While it makes sense to\nsay, for example, that [The truck exists] explains something,\nit\u2019s unclear what it might mean to say that the truck itself\ndoes so (Raven 2015; Trogdon 2013a). But, given separatism (grounding\nis determinationG), the alternative view is a\ngenuine option. We can coherently maintain that the truck determines\nits particular redness (a mode), and this, in turn, backs an\nexplanation of the existence of the mode in terms of the existence of\nthe truck.\n\nMoreover, some treat grounding as a quaternary rather than binary\nrelation. One such view is that the grounding relation includes two\nslots for facts and two slots for modes of presentation of those facts\n(Jenkins 2011). Another such view is that grounding is contrastive in\nnature, so it includes two slots for facts and two slots for contrasts\nof those facts (Schaffer 2012). Consider, again, the claim that [The\ntruckers are picketing] grounds [The truckers are striking]. Depending\non the context, we might read the claim as follows: [The truckers are\npicketing] rather than [They\u2019re working as normal] grounds [The\ntruckers are striking] rather than [It\u2019s not the case that\nthey\u2019re striking]. Schaffer argues that his version of the\nquaternary view is preferable to the binary view insofar as we can\nreasonably maintain that grounding is transitive given the former but\nnot the latter (see\n \u00a72.3\n for further discussion of transitivity). Schaffer also suggests that\nthe contrastive treatment of grounding is plausible insofar as it\ncasts grounding in an apt form to back explanation, which is itself\ncontrastive in nature.\n",
