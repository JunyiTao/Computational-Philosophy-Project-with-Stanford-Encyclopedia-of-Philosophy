    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nWhat is narrow mental content? Mental content simply means\nthe content of a mental state such as a thought, a belief, a desire, a\nfear, an intention, or a wish. Content is a deliberately\nvague term; it is a rough synonym of another vague term,\n\u2018meaning\u2019. A state with content is a state that\nrepresents some part or aspect of the world; its content is\nthe way it represents the world as being. For example, consider my\nbelief that water is a liquid at room temperature. The content of this\nbelief is what it says about the world, namely that a certain\nsubstance, water, has a certain property, being a liquid, under\nspecified conditions, namely being at room temperature. Whether a\nbelief is true or false depends on its content: it is true if the\nworld really is the way the belief represents it as being; otherwise\nit is false.\n\nA narrow content of a particular state is a content of that\nstate that is completely determined by the individual\u2019s\nintrinsic properties. An intrinsic property of an individual\nis a property that does not depend at all on the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. For example, having a certain shape is, arguably, an\nintrinsic property of a particular penny; being in my pocket is not an\nintrinsic property of the penny. This is because the penny\u2019s\nshape depends only on internal properties of the penny, whereas the\nfact that it is in my pocket depends on where it happens to be, which\nis an extrinsic property. The shape of the penny could not be\ndifferent unless the penny itself were different in some way, but the\npenny could be exactly the way it is even if it were not in my pocket.\nAgain, there could not be an exact duplicate of the penny that did not\nshare its shape, but there could be an exact duplicate that was not in\nmy pocket. Similarly, a narrow content of a belief or other mental\nstate is a content that could not be different unless the subject who\nhas the state were different in some intrinsic respect: no matter how\ndifferent the individual\u2019s environment were, the belief would\nhave the same content it actually does. Again, a narrow content of an\nindividual\u2019s belief is a content that must be shared by any\nexact duplicate of the individual. (If some form of dualism is true,\nthen the intrinsic properties of an individual may include properties\nthat are not completely determined by the individual\u2019s physical\nproperties. In that case an \u201cexact duplicate\u201d must be\nunderstood to be an individual who shares all intrinsic nonphysical\nproperties as well as physical ones.)\n\n(The notion of an intrinsic property turns out to be surprisingly\ndifficult to define precisely. A good guide to the various approaches\nthat have been taken, and their difficulties and refinements, is the\nentry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties.)\n\nOn first encounter, it may seem strange that the idea of narrow\ncontent should be controversial, or even that we should need a special\nterm for it. Most people, if they were ever to explicitly consider the\nissue of whether mental content is narrow or broad, would probably\nhold that all mental content is narrow, i.e. that all of the contents\nof our mental states are entirely determined by our intrinsic\nproperties. It seems conceivable, for example, as Descartes argued in\nhis First Meditation, that our perceptual states and beliefs could be\nexactly as they are even if the world were nothing like we think it\nis. This seems to presuppose that no difference in our environment,\nhowever radical, could make a difference to the contents of our\nbeliefs so long as our intrinsic properties remained the same.\n\nWhy, then, have philosophers believed they need to define narrow\ncontent and argue for its existence? The reason is that many\nphilosophers have been convinced by some influential arguments that,\nin the most ordinary or typical sense of \u2018content\u2019, most\nor even all of the contents of our mental states are broad rather than\nnarrow. If this conclusion is correct, if ordinary content is broad,\nthen it requires some work to define an alternative, narrow conception\nof content, and it requires arguments to show that there is any such\nthing. To understand the issues about narrow content, then, it is\nessential to first understand the arguments that most ordinary content\nis broad.\n2. Arguments for Broad Content\n2.1 Putnam\u2019s Argument: Twin Earth and Natural Kinds\n\nAmong the earliest and most influential arguments for broad content\nwere Hilary Putnam\u2019s arguments in such essays as \u201cThe\nMeaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d (1975). Putnam\u2019s\narguments were not designed specifically with mental content\nin mind. They applied in the first instance to linguistic\ncontent, more specifically to the reference of terms in a natural\nlanguage. However, they have been widely applied to mental content. I\nwill first discuss Putnam\u2019s argument concerning linguistic\ncontent, and then note how it can be extended to mental content.\n\nPutnam\u2019s most famous examples involve \u201cTwin Earth,\u201d\nan imaginary planet which is molecule-for-molecule identical to Earth,\nincluding having exact duplicates of Earth\u2019s inhabitants,\nexcept for a systematic change in certain parts of the\nnatural environment. In a particularly well-known version of this\nexample, we consider Earth as it was around 1750, before the chemical\nstructure of water was discovered, and we consider an inhabitant of\nEarth named \u201cOscar\u201d who is a competent user of the term\n\u2018water\u2019. We then imagine a Twin Earth which is exactly\nlike Earth in every way, including having an exact duplicate of Oscar,\nwith one exception: for every place on Earth that contains\nH2O, the Twin Earthly duplicate of that place instead\ncontains XYZ, a substance with a different microstructure from water\nbut with similar observable properties. On Twin Earth, it is XYZ, not\nH2O, that falls from the skies and fills the lakes and\noceans.\n\nPutnam argues that the stuff that falls from the skies and fills the\nlakes on Twin Earth is not water. According to Putnam, when\npeople used the term \u2018water\u2019, even in 1750, they intended\nto refer to a natural kind, a kind of thing whose instances\nshare a common nature, not directly observable, which explains the\nobservable properties of instances of the kind. They identified water\nby observable characteristics like colorlessness and odorlessness, but\nthey also assumed that there was a microstructure which explains these\nobservable properties. Since 1750, we have learned what this\nmicrostructure is, namely that water consists of molecules of\nH2O. But water was H2O even in 1750,\nbefore we learned this. (Other natural kind terms work in the same\nway. For instance, we identify diseases by their symptoms, but we\nassume that there is an underlying cause of these symptoms, for\nexample a particular microorganism, and that even before we know what\nthis underlying cause is, it makes the disease what it is.)\n\nNow Twin Oscar, being an exact duplicate of Earth\u2019s Oscar, will\nhave many of the same properties Oscar has. For instance, he will be\ndisposed to accept a sentence of Twin English that is written and\npronounced exactly like the English sentence \u201cWater is\nwet.\u201d However, Putnam argues, Twin Oscar\u2019s word\n\u2018water\u2019 does not refer to water. There\nis no water on Twin Earth, only XYZ; Twin Oscar has never seen water,\ntalked about water, or interacted with water in any way. So it seems\nthat he cannot possibly refer to water.\n\n(Two points should be made parenthetically about this example. (1) The\nobservable properties of XYZ do not need to be identical to\nthose of water; all that is needed is that Oscar and Twin Oscar have\nnot observed the differences. (2) In some ways it is unfortunate that\nthe water/XYZ example has become Putnam\u2019s best known example,\nbecause it has a failing that many of his other examples lack, namely\nthat most of the human body consists of water. This has the\nconsequence that Twin Oscar cannot be an exact duplicate of Oscar\nunless Twin Oscar also consists largely of water. Other examples\nPutnam considers involve switching aluminum and molybdenum, beeches\nand elms, diseases, and so on, and these examples do not suffer from\nthe same problem.)\n\nIt is important for this example that, although 1750 residents of\nEarth did not yet realize this, all water was in fact H2O.\nHad it turned out instead that some of the stuff called\n\u201cwater\u201d was H2O while other stuff called\n\u201cwater\u201d was XYZ, then water would not have turned out to\nbe a single \u201cnatural kind.\u201d In that case the English word\n\u201cwater\u201d would refer to anything that was either\nH2O or XYZ, and we could say that the Earthly and\nTwin-Earthly \u2018water\u2019-words referred to the same thing.\nAgain, if it had turned out that there were a huge number of different\nmicrostructures that produced the observable properties of water, then\nwater would not have been a natural kind at all. In that case we would\nprobably say that anything with the right observable properties was\nwater, and in that case again we could say both\n\u2018water\u2019-words were coreferential. In fact, though, neither\nof these possibilities obtains. Water is a natural kind whose\nessential nature is that it has the chemical structure H2O;\nsince there is no H2O on Twin Earth, there is no water\nthere. Twin Earthlings never had occasion to give a label to water,\nsince there is none on their planet, so their word \u201cwater\u201d\ndoes not refer to water.\n\nSince Oscar and Twin Oscar have exactly the same intrinsic properties,\nyet refer to different substances when they use their\n\u2018water\u2019-words, their intrinsic properties cannot suffice\nto determine what they refer to. If the meaning of a word suffices to\ndetermine its reference, then meaning cannot be determined by\nintrinsic properties either. As Putnam famously puts it,\n\u201c\u2018meanings\u2019 just ain\u2019t in the\nhead!\u201d (1975, p. 227).\n\nAlthough the argument as presented so far concerns the reference of\n\u2018water\u2019 and other natural kind terms, it is natural to\nextend it to mental content as well (McGinn 1977; Burge 1979, note 2).\nNot only does Twin Oscar not refer to water when he uses the term\n\u2018water\u2019, he does not have beliefs about water either. To\nbe sure, he has beliefs that play the same role in his mental life\nthat Oscar\u2019s water-beliefs play in his. But in Twin\nOscar\u2019s case, those beliefs are not about water. In particular,\nwhile Oscar believes that water is wet, Twin Oscar does not. Since\nOscar and Twin Oscar have identical intrinsic properties, yet Oscar\nbelieves that water is wet while Twin Oscar does not, mental content\ncannot be determined solely by intrinsic properties.\n2.2 Burge\u2019s Argument: Semantic Deference\n\nThe second main source of arguments that ordinary mental content is\nbroad is a series of influential articles by Tyler Burge, including\n\u201cIndividualism and the Mental\u201d (1979). Burge has offered\nseveral lines of argument for the externalist view he calls\n\u201canti-individualism.\u201d These are helpfully distinguished\nand described in the Introduction to Burge 2007. One line of argument,\nclosely related to Putnam\u2019s water example, emphasizes the role\nof the environment in thought about natural kinds. Another line of\nargument defends anti-individualism about perceptual content. I will\nconsider a third much-discussed line of argument, which relies on the\nfact that in many cases we intend what we are thinking or talking\nabout to depend to some extent on the beliefs of others in our\ncommunity, especially those more expert than we.\n\nBurge\u2019s most famous example involves the concept of arthritis.\nHe considers an individual who is unaware that arthritis is a disease\nspecifically of the joints. His subject believes that he has arthritis\nin his thigh. This belief is false, since one cannot have arthritis in\nthe thigh. However, Burge argues, in a world in which all the\nintrinsic facts about the subject were exactly the same as they\nactually are, but in which the term \u2018arthritis\u2019 is\ngenerally used in the subject\u2019s community to refer to rheumatoid\nailments in general, the subject\u2019s belief would have a different\ncontent. It would be a belief that the subject had a rheumatoid\nailment in the thigh, and this is a belief which could possibly be\ntrue. Burge offers a wide variety of other examples making the same\npoint, involving beliefs about such things as sofas and contracts.\nThese latter examples are important because, if successful, they show\nthat broad content extends far beyond beliefs about natural kinds.\n\nThe idea that mental content is broad is the idea that it is not\ndetermined entirely by an individual\u2019s intrinsic properties, but\nis determined in part by features of the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. But if the content of my beliefs is not determined\nentirely by my internal states, what else could determine it? How\ncould anything other than my intrinsic properties determine what I\nthink and believe? The examples just discussed point to two different\nsorts of environmental factor. Putnam\u2019s example of Oscar and his\nTwin Earth duplicate focuses on the contribution of the\nnatural environment. The crucial idea here is that when we\nhave thoughts or beliefs about natural kinds, we often do not know\nwhat the essential features of those kinds are, even though we assume\nthat there are such essential features. In such cases, what we are\nthinking about depends not only on internally available factors, but\nalso on facts about the physical, chemical, or biological makeup of\nthe kinds we are thinking about. Burge\u2019s arthritis example, by\ncontrast, focuses on the contribution of the social\nenvironment. In our thoughts about many kinds of things, including\nnatural kinds but also including kinds invented by humans, such as\nfurniture or contracts, we assume that others may have more expertise\nthan we do about what is and what is not included in the kind in\nquestion. Thus, what we are thinking about depends not only on our\nintrinsic properties, but also on expert opinion. We defer to\nthe experts with regard to what exactly we are thinking about. For\nthis reason, this sort of contribution of the social environment is\nsometimes referred to as \u201csemantic deference.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon of semantic deference is closely related to what Putnam\nmemorably termed \u201cthe linguistic division of labor.\u201d\nPutnam\u2019s idea was that as long as there are experts on what\ncertain words refer to, we do not all need to have that specialized\nknowledge; we can rely on the knowledge of the experts. In\nBurge\u2019s treatment, however, the phenomenon is not merely\nlinguistic: it is not just that we defer to the experts on the meaning\nof the word \u2018arthritis\u2019; we also defer to the\nexperts on the nature of the disease arthritis. Thus, for\nBurge, the phenomenon affects not only what we mean by the words we\nuse, but also the very contents of our thoughts.\n2.3 Responses to the Arguments\n\nWe can distinguish between three broad categories of response to the\nexamples of Putnam and Burge. On one extreme, to use the terminology\nof Segal (2000), we have the unqualified acceptance of the extreme\nexternalist. Many philosophers have been persuaded by examples\nlike those of Putnam and Burge that all or nearly all mental\ncontent is broad. Such philosophers are highly skeptical about the\nusefulness of any notion of narrow content. Burge himself is a\nnoteworthy proponent of extreme externalism; other extreme\nexternalists include Robert Stalnaker (1989, 1990, 2008) and Robert A.\nWilson (1995).\n\nA second response takes us to the opposite extreme, extreme\ninternalism. According to this response, Putnam\u2019s and\nBurge\u2019s examples do not succeed in showing that any\ncontent is broad. This position has been defended by, among others,\nKent Bach (1987), Tim Crane (1991), and Gabriel Segal (2000). These\nauthors question the externalist interpretation of the examples we\nhave discussed. For example, in response to Putnam, Segal points out\nthat we have some empty natural kind concepts \u2014 that\nis, we have concepts which we intend to be natural kind concepts, but\nwhich in fact do not succeed in referring to a real kind. Possible\nexamples include the concepts of witches, ghosts, and phlogiston. In\nthese examples, the environment cannot make the sort of contribution\ndiscussed by Putnam, because the environment contains no relevant\nkind. Nevertheless, people who have them use these concepts in their\nreasoning, and their behavior is partly explained by these concepts.\nIf so, then we can have natural kind concepts that do not have an\nenvironmental component. Now, it seems that with respect to\nexplanations of our reasoning and action, it does not make a\ndifference whether the kinds we think we are reasoning about actually\nexist: so long as we think they exist, we will make the same\ninferences and perform the same actions regardless of whether we are\ncorrect or not. This may lead us to suspect that even in the case of\nnon-empty natural kind concepts, our reasoning and action are best\nexplained in terms of concepts whose content is not environmentally\ndetermined \u2014 in short, in terms of concepts whose content is\nnarrow.\n\nWith respect to Burge\u2019s examples, Segal suggests that it is odd\nto regard someone who thinks it possible to have arthritis in the\nthigh as having the concept of arthritis at all. Arthritis just\nis an inflammation of the joints; it seems peculiar to say\nthat someone who does not realize this has the concept of arthritis.\nInstead, we should say that the subject in Burge\u2019s example has a\ndifferent concept, a concept he mistakenly associates with\nthe English word \u2018arthritis\u2019. Thus we might want to deny\nthat Burge\u2019s subject really believes he has arthritis in his\nthigh. What he really believes is something it is hard to express in\nEnglish, since we do not have a word that applies to all and only the\ncases he would regard as cases of arthritis. (For a careful\npresentation and critique of this sort of \u201cdual concepts\u201d\nobjection to externalism, see Frances 2016.)\n\n\n(Segal takes these arguments to undermine the idea that Putnam\u2019s\nand Burge\u2019s examples establish that thoughts and beliefs about\nkinds have only broad contents. He does not take them to\nrefute \u201ctwo-factor\u201d theories according to which beliefs\nhave both broad and narrow contents, although he does offer additional\narguments specifically targeted against two-factor theories.)\n\nAlthough extreme internalists advocate narrow content, they also hold\nthat ordinary content is already narrow, so that we do not need a\nspecial or technical notion of narrow content. Thus, much of the\nliterature in favor of narrow content is written by those who accept\nthe third response to Putnam\u2019s and Burge\u2019s arguments,\nmoderate internalism (which we could equally well call\n\u201cmoderate externalism,\u201d since it is a compromise between\nthe two extreme views). This is the view that, while Putnam\u2019s\nand Burge\u2019s examples do show that ordinary content is broad,\nthere are also contents that are narrow. On a moderate\ninternalist view, many beliefs have both broad and narrow contents.\nSince, on this view, ordinary content is often broad, we need a\ndistinctive, specialized notion of narrow content as different in some\nway from ordinary content.\n3. Arguments for Narrow Content\n\nWhy do moderate internalists believe that, despite the success of\narguments that ordinary content is often or always broad, we\nnevertheless need a notion of narrow content? There are four main\nkinds of arguments they have found persuasive.\n3.1 Causal Arguments\n\nOne influential argument for narrow content (Fodor 1987; a recent\ndefense of this kind of argument, with relies to criticisms, is\nGaukroger, 2017) appeals to considerations involving causal\nexplanation. We might outline the argument like this. A first premise\nis that mental states causally explain behavior by virtue of the\ncontent they have. Although this has been denied by some, it certainly\nseems to be a central part of commonsense psychology. Our behavior\nseems to be a causal consequence of our beliefs and desires; moreover,\nthe content of those beliefs and desires seems to be centrally\ninvolved in the causation of behavior. We behave the way we do because\nof what we want and what we believe, and this seems to be just another\nway of saying that we behave as we do because of the contents of our\nbeliefs and desires. A second premise is that the causal powers of an\nentity, its capacity to produce effects, must be intrinsic features of\nthe entity. Thus twins, who share all their intrinsic properties, must\nshare their causal powers. This premise seems plausible for at least\ntwo reasons. First, causation is local. It seems that\nfeatures of the environment can affect an individual\u2019s actions\nonly by way of effects on the individual\u2019s intrinsic properties.\nSecond, causal powers should be evaluated across contexts. If an\nastronaut on the Moon can easily lift a one-hundred-kilogram weight\nand I, on Earth, cannot, this does not mean that the astronaut is\nstronger; the crucial issue is whether the astronaut can lift more\nthan I can in the same environments. This appears to show that my Twin\nEarth counterpart and I have the same causal powers even though I can\nobtain water by turning on the faucet and he cannot, since our\nparallel actions will achieve parallel results provided that our\nenvironments are the same. A third and final premise is that broad\ncontent does not characterize intrinsic features, at least not\nessentially; thus twins need not share broad contents. According to\nthe first premise, mental states must have a kind of content that\ncausally explains behavior. Taken together, the second and third\npremises show that broad content cannot fulfill this role. The\nconclusion of the argument, then, is that mental states must have\nnarrow contents, contents that are shared between twins.\n\nExternalists have attacked this argument at its second premise, the\npremise that causal powers must be intrinsic properties. Against the\nargument that causal powers must be intrinsic because causation is\nlocal, Burge (1986, 1989) has argued that local causation is\nentirely compatible with broad individuation. Against the\nargument that the cross-context test for sameness of causal powers\nshows that they are intrinsic, Burge (1989) suggests that causal\npowers are typically identified relative to a normal environment;\nthus, for example, it would be reasonable to distinguish between a\nheart and a similar organ whose function is to pump waste even if one\nof these organs could be successfully surgically replaced by the\nother. Burge (1986) also argues that actual psychological theories,\nsuch as Marr\u2019s theory of vision, do not satisfy internalist\nconstraints. (For criticisms of Burge\u2019s interpretation of Marr,\nsee Segal 1989 and Egan 1991. Burge 2010 is a book-length defense of\nthe claim that perceptual psychology is anti-individualistic.)\n\nIn a later essay (Fodor 1991), Fodor defends a weaker and more\ncomplicated version of the second premise. He suggests that there are\nsome extrinsic properties, such as being a planet, that\naffect causal powers, and others, like being part of a universe in\nwhich a certain coin toss comes out heads, that are irrelevant to\ncausal powers. He then offers a criterion for distinguishing between\ncausally relevant extrinsic properties and causally irrelevant\nextrinsic properties: roughly, an extrinsic property is causally\nirrelevant to outcomes that it is logically connected to. He then\nargues that broad content does not satisfy the criterion for being a\ncausally relevant extrinsic property. (It should be noted that in\nstill more recent work (Fodor 1995, Chapter 2), Fodor has abandoned\nthe idea that narrow content is important for psychology.)\n3.2 Arguments from Introspective Access\n\nA somewhat different motivation for narrow content (Loar 1988) appeals\nto the idea that we have introspective access to the contents of our\nown thoughts. In particular, it seems that we should be able to\ndetermine introspectively whether two of our thoughts have the same\ncontent or not. But the kind of difference in content that\ndistinguishes Oscar\u2019s thoughts from Twin Oscar\u2019s thoughts\nseems to be the sort of difference that they could not in principle be\nintrospectively aware of. From the inside, so to speak, there is no\nway for Oscar and Twin Oscar to tell whether they are thinking\nXYZ-thoughts or H2O-thoughts. (Recall that they are unaware\nof what the microstructure of the substance they call\n\u201cwater\u201d is, although they assume that it has one.) The\ndifference in broad content between the beliefs of Oscar and Twin\nOscar seems to be a difference to which they themselves have no\naccess.\n\nIt is difficult to formulate this point precisely, however. For\ninstance, Oscar can think that water is wet and then think the\nmeta-level thought, \u201cthat thought I just had was about\nwater!\u201d, referring thereby to H2O and thus\nexpressing the very aspect of his original thought which distinguishes\nhis content from Twin Oscar\u2019s. Since neither Oscar nor Twin\nOscar has thoughts about the substance his twin has thoughts about, it\nis not clear what it means to say that they cannot introspectively\ndistinguish between these different thoughts. One way to try to\nclarify and reinforce the argument is to consider the phenomenon of\n\u201cslow switching\u201d (introduced in Burge 1988, and used by\nBoghossian 1989 to pose difficulties for self-knowledge). Suppose\nOscar moves to Twin Earth. Initially his water-thoughts will continue\nto be about water, but it seems that gradually, the longer he\ninteracts with XYZ and the longer he is out of touch with\nH2O, his thoughts will come to be about XYZ rather than\nH2O. If this is correct, then his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts will have come over time to have a\ndifferent broad content than they previously had. However, this change\nin content will be completely invisible to Oscar himself. From his own\nsubjective point of view, his thoughts appear to have exactly the same\ncontent as before. If there is a kind of mental content to which we\nhave introspective access, and if introspective access must include\nthe ability to recognize when contents are the same or different, then\nthe sort of content to which we have introspective access cannot be\nbroad content. This suggests that we need a concept of narrow content\nto capture the kind of content that we are immediately aware of.\n\nBurge\u2019s response to this sort of argument is to accept that we\nhave introspective knowledge of the contents of our own thoughts, but\ndeny that this entails that we can tell introspectively whether two\ncontents are the same or different (Burge 1988). In response, some\nsuggest that knowing that my thought is about water requires ruling\nout relevant alternative possibilities, and that in slow switching\ncases the possibility that my thought is instead about XYZ is in fact\na relevant alternative that we cannot rule out. (For further\ndialectical twists and turns, see Ludlow and Martin 1998, and\nNuccetelli 2003.)\n3.3 Arguments Concerning Rationality\n\nA related issue is that describing a subject\u2019s beliefs in terms\nof broad content can make them appear irrational even though they are\nnot: when beliefs are described in terms of broad content, they can be\ninconsistent with one another even though the inconsistency is in\nprinciple not discoverable by the subject. A famous example is due to\nSaul Kripke (1979). In Kripke\u2019s example, Pierre, a Frenchman,\ngrows up with a belief he expresses by saying \u201cLondres est\njolie.\u201d This belief has the (broad) content that London is\npretty. Later he moves to England, where he learns English by\nimmersion rather than by translation. He comes to have a second\nbelief, which he expresses in English by saying \u201cLondon is not\npretty.\u201d This belief has the broad content that London is not\npretty. Pierre never realizes that the city he thinks of as Londres\nand the city he thinks of as London are in fact the same city. His two\nbeliefs directly contradict one another, and yet he is not guilty of\nany sort of failure of rationality; it is impossible for him to\nascertain that the two beliefs are contradictory. Kripke himself does\nnot offer a solution to his puzzle and does not discuss narrow\ncontent. But a natural response to the example is to suppose that,\nwhile the belief Pierre accepts and the one he rejects have the same\nbroad content, they have different narrow contents. If so, then the\nsort of content most relevant to determining whether someone\u2019s\nbeliefs and inferences are rational is not broad content but narrow\ncontent.\n\nOne response to this sort of argument is offered by Stalnaker (1990)\nin a critique of Loar (1988). Stalnaker agrees that examples like that\nof Pierre require us to distinguish between the world as it is\naccording to Pierre, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the\npropositions ordinarily expressed by the sentences we use to describe\nthose beliefs, e.g. the proposition that London is pretty. However, in\nhis view it does not follow that an accurate description of the world\naccording to Pierre must be narrow: \u201cI don\u2019t think the\nbelief states themselves \u2014 the ways the world is according to\nthe thinker \u2014 are any less causally and socially infected than\nthe language in which beliefs are ascribed\u201d (p. 203). Jackson\n(2003) responds to Stalnaker\u2019s reasons for skepticism about\nnarrow content.\n3.4 Argument from Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nA more recent argument for the existence of narrow content is an\nargument from phenomenal intentionality (Loar 2003; Horgan and Tienson\n2002; Horgan, Tienson and Graham 2004; Kriegel 2013). To understand\nthis argument, we first need to understand what its proponents mean by\n\u201cphenomenal intentionality.\u201d (For a detailed overview of\nthe topic of phenomenal intentionality, including connections with\nnarrow content, see the entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.)\n Philosophers of mind have traditionally drawn a sharp distinction\nbetween two sorts of properties of mental states, phenomenal\nproperties and intentional properties. Phenomenal properties have to\ndo with the felt character of conscious experience, with \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like,\u201d in Thomas Nagel\u2019s famous phrase (Nagel\n1974). Intentional properties have to do with the representational\ncharacter of mental states, i.e. with their content. One view of the\nrelation between phenomenal and intentional properties, called\n\u201cseparatism\u201d by Horgan and Tienson (2002), is that they\nare independent of one another: any given phenomenal character could\nbe accompanied by any intentional properties (or none), and vice\nversa. According to Lycan (2008 \u00a79), this view was \u201cthe\nstandard attitude among philosophers of mind between the 1950s and the\n1980s.\u201d On another view of the relation between the intentional\nand the phenomenal, known as representationalism, the phenomenal\ncharacter of experience is completely determined by its intentional\nnature. The key thesis of phenomenal intentionality is that, while\nrepresentationalism is correct that there is an intimate connection\nbetween phenomenology and intentionality, the determination runs in\nthe opposite direction: there is a kind of intentional content,\nphenomenal intentionality, which is entirely constitutively determined\nby the phenomenal character of a mental state. \n\nThis thesis is one premise of the argument from phenomenal\nintentionality to narrow content. The other premise is that the\nphenomenal character of experience is itself narrow. Putting the two\npremises together, we get the following argument for the existence of\nnarrow content: \u201c(1) There is pervasive intentional content that\nconstitutively depends on phenomenology alone. (2) Phenomenology\nconstitutively depends only on narrow factors. So, (3) There is\npervasive intentional content that constitutively depends only on\nnarrow factors\u201d (Horgan and Tienson 2002, p. 527; cf. Horgan,\nTienson and Graham 2004, p. 300).\n\nBoth premises of this argument are controversial. The second premise,\nthat phenomenology is narrow, is rejected by phenomenal externalists\n(Lycan 2008, \u00a714), while the controversial character of the first\npremise, that there is intentional content that is entirely determined\nby phenomenology, can be seen in the fact that its proponents have\nadvanced it as a departure from orthodoxy. Defenders of phenomenal\nintentionality have supported both premises by appeal to brain-in-vat\nscenarios. Suppose that alien beings synthesize a structure identical\nto your own brain, and connect it to a computer-controlled apparatus\nthat provides inputs to this brain-like object which maintain its\nsimilarity to your brain over a substantial period of time. (See\nHorgan, Tienson and Graham 2004 for further details. This fairly\nelaborate brain-in-vat scenario avoids some of Burge\u2019s\nobjections (Burge 2003, pp. 443\u2013445) to Loar\u2019s\nless-fully-described version (Loar 2003).) Defenders of phenomenal\nintentionality find it intuitively plausible that by virtue of its\nphysical similarity with your brain, the brain-like object will also\nshare your phenomenology, supporting the narrowness of phenomenology;\nand that the brain-like object will, by virtue of sharing your\nphenomenology, also share many of the contents of your mental states,\nsupporting the existence of phenomenally-determined intentionality.\n(For these two uses of the brain-in-vat scenario, see Horgan, Tienson\nand Graham 2004, p. 302. For additional arguments for the existence of\nphenomenal intentionality, see Kriegel 2013, \u00a72.1. Criticisms of\nphenomenal intentionality may be found in Bailey and Richards 2014 and\nWerner 2015.)\n\nThe most immediately plausible purported example of phenomenal\nintentionality is the content of perceptual experience. If perceptual\nexperience is a genuine example of phenomenally determined\nintentionality, but also the only example, then the argument from\nphenomenal intentionality would show the existence of narrow contents\nof perceptual states, but would be silent on whether other mental\nstates such as beliefs and desires have narrow contents. However, some\ndefenders of phenomenal intentionality (e.g. Horgan, Tienson and\nGraham 2004 and several of the contributors to Bayne and Montague\n2011) would go further, arguing that there are distinctive\nphenomenologies of agency and of propositional attitudes including\nbeliefs and desires; that the phenomenal properties of these mental\nstates also constitutively determine intentional properties; and\nmoreover that all intentionality either is identical with, or\nis derived from, phenomenal intentionality. If these bolder theses are\ncorrect, then the argument from phenomenal intentionality would give\nreason to think that all of the propositional attitudes have narrow\ncontents, and that their wide contents, if any, are derived from these\nnarrow contents.\n4. Conceptions of Narrow Content\n\nSupposing that there is a sort of content of at least some mental\nstates that is narrow, how should we conceive of it? What sort of\nthing is narrow content? There are many different proposals in the\nliterature (although in some cases the differences between them may\nnot be as great as they first appear). We consider several.\n4.1 Descriptive Content\n\nPerhaps the most obvious suggestion is that the narrow content of a\nparticular belief can be understood as a more detailed description of\nwhat is believed. More specifically, the idea is that the narrow\ncontent of a particular concept is a description of what the concept\nexpresses or refers to.\n\nAn example will make this idea clearer. Consider Oscar, who believes\nthat water is wet. This belief involves the concept of water, and\narguments like Putnam\u2019s appear to show that the ordinary content\nof this concept is broad. The proposal we are considering is that\nthere is a more detailed description that captures the narrow content,\nfor Oscar, of the concept of water. This description might be\nsomething like \u201cclear, colorless, odorless liquid that falls\nfrom the sky and fills the lakes.\u201d Oscar and his Twin may share\nthis descriptive content even though their\n\u2018water\u2019-concepts do not have the same broad content. The\nsuggestion, then, is that, when Oscar thinks the thought that he would\nexpress by saying \u201cwater is wet,\u201d and when Twin Oscar\nthinks the thought that he would express by saying, in Twin English,\n\u201cwater is wet,\u201d both of them are expressing a thought with\nthe descriptive content \u201cthe clear, colorless, odorless liquid\nthat falls from the sky and fills the lakes is wet.\u201d This narrow\ncontent, the proposal continues, determines, on Twin Earth, the broad\ncontent that XYZ is wet, while on Earth it determines the broad\ncontent that water (i.e. H2O) is wet.\n\nNotice that if this description is to succeed in determining the\nappropriate broad content on Earth and on Twin Earth, then it must\nhave a subtle \u201cindexical\u201d component. An indexical is a\nterm, like \u2018I\u2019 or \u2018now\u2019, whose referent is\ncontext-relative. The referent of \u2018I\u2019 depends on who\nutters or thinks it; the referent of \u2018now\u2019 depends on the\ntime at which it is uttered or thought. The supposedly narrow content\n\u201ccolorless odorless liquid that falls from the sky and fills the\nlakes\u201d must have an implicit indexical component: the content in\nquestion is really something like \u201cthe colorless, odorless\nliquid that falls from the sky and fills the lakes around\nhere\u201d (Putnam 1975, p. 234).\n\nThere is an obvious and serious problem with the proposal that narrow\ncontent is descriptive content, however. The problem is simply that\nthe description which is intended to give the narrow content of a\nconcept such as Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-concept may itself\nbe broad (Lepore and Loewer, 1986; Taylor, 1989). In my example,\nseveral of the concepts involved in the descriptive content arguably\nhave broad contents. The notion of a liquid has a technical meaning\nthat need not correspond to the observable properties we associate\nwith it. And perhaps concepts like those of sky, lake, and color are\nalso broad.\n\nThis objection need not be entirely crushing, but it certainly makes\nthe descriptive content approach more difficult to spell out in\ndetail. If we specify the description that is supposed to capture a\nnarrow content in ordinary language, then we will need to use only\nordinary-language terms that do not have broad contents. If the moral\nof the arguments for broad content is as sweeping as philosophers like\nBurge believe, it may be difficult or impossible to find enough\nordinary-language expressions that satisfy this requirement. We could\nregard the description we have been discussing as a first step; the\nsecond step would be to replace the expressions \u2018liquid\u2019,\n\u2018sky\u2019, \u2018lake\u2019, and so on with their own\ndescriptive contents. But these descriptions in turn might well\ncontain expressions with broad contents, which would then need to be\nreplaced with still further descriptions. It is not clear that we will\nbe able to find enough purely narrow expressions to do all the\ndescriptive work we need. (Mendola 2008 is a recent attempt to develop\na detailed version of the descriptive approach that can overcome such\nworries.)\n4.2 Conceptual Role\n\nA second approach to narrow content identifies narrow contents with\n\u201cconceptual roles.\u201d This approach was laid out in a\nprogrammatic way by Ned Block in his essay \u201cAdvertisement for a\nSemantics for Psychology\u201d (Block 1986). The general idea is that\nthe conceptual role of a particular state is a matter of its causal\nrelations to other states. As Block puts it, conceptual role \u201cis\na matter of the causal role of the expression in reasoning and\ndeliberation and, in general, in the way the expression combines and\ninteracts with other expressions so as to mediate between sensory\ninputs and behavioral outputs\u201d (p. 93). However, conceptual role\nshould not be understood to include all the causal relations\nbetween a given state and other states: \u201cConceptual role\nabstracts away from all causal relations except the ones that mediate\ninferences, inductive or deductive, decision making, and the\nlike\u201d (p. 94).\n\nThe easiest way to get a feeling for conceptual role semantics is to\nconsider the kind of example that it seems to fit most naturally.\nSuppose that we have a mental representation we will symbolize as\n\u2018*\u2019. Suppose further that \u2018*\u2019 stands in the\nfollowing causal relations with other mental representations.\n\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to sentential mental\nrepresentations P and Q, then the subject is likely to also acquire\nthe belief relation to the compound representation P*Q.\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to P*Q, then the subject\nis likely to also acquire the belief relation to P.\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to P*Q, then the subject\nis likely to also acquire the belief relation to Q.\n\n\nIf the representation \u2018*\u2019 is related in these ways to\nother mental representations, it seems reasonable to say that it\nexpresses the relation of conjunction, i.e. that\n\u2018*\u2019 should be interpreted as \u2018and\u2019. In fact,\nwe might want to go so far as to say that satisfying the conditions\nabove constitutes meaning conjunction. It is worth noticing\nthat these three conditions closely resemble the rules that typically\ncharacterize conjunction in natural deduction systems of propositional\nlogic. Reflecting on this similarity may suggest some potential\nproblems for conceptual role semantics.\n\nThese potential problems include the following. (1) Rules of inference\nare normative rather than descriptive. They tell us what inferences\nare permissible; they do not purport to provide an empirical account\nof what inferences people actually make. It is not clear how a\ndescription of the causal interactions between mental states can\ncapture this normative element (Williams 1990; for a critique of the\nidea that mental content is normative, see Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\n2009). (2) One might wonder whether there is something backward about\nthe view that conceptual role determines meaning. In the case of\npropositional logic, a standard view is that the meaning of logical\nconnectives such as conjunction is given by a truth table,\nwhich shows how the truth or falsity of a compound sentence is\ndetermined by the truth values of its component sentences. The\nadequacy of a system of inference rules is then determined by whether\nit permits derivations of all and only those arguments that are\nsemantically valid. Similarly, perhaps the causal roles of mental\nstates should be explained in part by their semantics, instead of the\nother way around. (3) Conceptual role semantics seems more plausible\nfor logical connectives than for other sorts of representations. It is\none thing to regard the meaning of a mental symbol for conjunction as\ndetermined by the inferences a subject will make between mental\nrepresentations that contain the symbol and those that do not. After\nall, that is what conjunction is for. It is another and much\nbolder thing to regard more empirical mental representations as having\ntheir meanings determined in this way.\n\nTwo additional problems, already identified in Block\u2019s essay,\nhave been much discussed since. First, conceptual role semantics seems\nto lead to a very extreme holism. If all or nearly all of the\ninferential relations between mental representations are included in\ntheir conceptual role, then it seems that a change in the meaning of\nany representation will also change the meanings of all or nearly all\nthe others, and also that nearly any change in belief will result in a\nchange in the meaning of one\u2019s representations. We ordinarily\nthink that there is an important difference between changes of belief\nand changes of meaning, but it is hard to see how to capture this\ndifference within conceptual role semantics. Second, conceptual role,\nas understood by Block and others, may seem too\n\u201csyntactic\u201d to constitute a conception of content at all.\nIn particular, conceptual role does not naturally give rise to an\naccount of truth conditions. As Block puts it, \u201cis narrow\ncontent really content?\u201d Block himself regards conceptual role\nas a determinant of content, and leaves it an open question\nwhether it is also a kind of content. But if conceptual role\nis not actually a kind of content, then it does not satisfy all of the\noriginal motivations for introducing a notion of narrow content.\n4.3 The Mapping Conception\n\nWhite (1982) and Fodor (1987) have offered a rather different, and\nhighly influential, way of thinking about narrow content. This\nconception focuses on what narrow contents are supposed to accomplish.\nA narrow content is supposed to be something that Oscar and Twin Oscar\nshare, and by virtue of which Oscar believes that water is wet and\nTwin Oscar believes that XYZ is wet. Similarly, it should be something\nthat Art in his actual environment shares with Art in his envisioned\ncounterfactual environment, and by virtue of which he believes, in his\nactual environment, that he has arthritis in his thigh, and believes,\nin the counterfactual environment, that he has a different and broader\ndisease in his thigh. So one approach to narrow content is simply to\ndeclare that a narrow content is something that, given a particular\nenvironment, determines a particular broad content. Block (1991) calls\nthis the \u201cmapping theory,\u201d since on this account a narrow\ncontent maps environments into broad contents.\n\nSome care is required in determining what the relevant environments\nare. What matters is not only the environment the subject is currently\nin, but rather the environment in which the subject acquired the\nrelevant beliefs and other mental states. If we zipped Oscar to Twin\nEarth and Twin Oscar to Earth, we would not thereby change what their\nthoughts are about (at least not immediately). Oscar would still be\nthinking about water, and would probably misidentify XYZ as water;\nTwin Oscar would still be thinking about XYZ, and would probably\nmisidentify water as XYZ. What determines the broad content of their\nthoughts is not merely the environment they are in at the moment, but\nalso the environment in which they first acquired their thoughts and\nbeliefs about watery stuff. Provided we understand\n\u201ccontext\u201d to include both sorts of facts, we can describe\nthe mapping conception as a conception on which narrow content is a\nfunction from contexts to broad contents.\n\n(White (1982) actually distinguishes between \u201ccontexts of\nacquisition\u201d and \u201ccontexts of occurrence\u201d, and\ndefines a notion of \u201cpartial character\u201d as a higher-order\nfunction which takes a context of acquisition as argument and yields\nas the resulting value a function from contexts of occurrence to broad\ncontents. The relation between White\u2019s view and Fodor\u2019s is\neasier to see, however, if we employ a more inclusive conception of\ncontext that includes both one\u2019s current environment and\none\u2019s history of acquisition of the relevant concept. If we do,\nwe can collapse both levels of White\u2019s higher-order function\ninto one, yielding a lower-order function like Fodor\u2019s. The\nbroad content determined by a Fodorian narrow content applied to a\nparticular context is the same as the broad content determined by\napplying White\u2019s partial character to that context, and then\napplying the resulting function to the very same context.)\n\nThe mapping theory faces a number of difficulties. (1) As Fodor notes,\non the mapping view narrow content seems to be ineffable. We would\nlike to be able to say what the narrow content of a particular thought\nor belief is, but on Fodor\u2019s view this cannot be done. To\nexpress a narrow content we would presumably need to find an English\nexpression that is synonymous with it. But the content of English\nexpressions is broad, not narrow, so this seems to be impossible.\n\n(Valerie Walker (1990) and Stephen Stich (1991) propose that narrow\ncontents could be expressed if English were supplemented with a\n\u201cbracketing\u201d notation. For example, an expression of the\nform \u2018___ has the (narrow) content that [p]\u2019 is said to\nhave as its extension \u201cin any possible world the class of brain\nstate tokens whose (broad) content is p, along with physically\nidentical tokens in all doppelgangers of people who harbor tokens\nwhose broad content is p\u201d (Stich 1991, p. 247). The chief\ndifficulty with this proposal is that it has the consequence that\nevery token with a given broad content has the same narrow content.\nBut mental states with a particular broad content can be very unlike\none another: compare Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet with that\nof an expert in chemistry, or the very different ways in which Pierre\nis related to the proposition that London is pretty. If narrow content\nis to be useful in explaining behavior and rational inference, it must\nbe the case not only that Twins share their narrow contents despite\ntheir different broad contents, but also that individuals with the\nsame broad content may have different narrow contents (Brown\n1993).)\n\n(2) A second difficulty noted by Fodor is that, like conceptual role\nsemantics, the mapping conception may not deserve to be called\n\u201ccontent,\u201d because the narrow contents it yields do not\nsuffice to determine truth conditions. A central characteristic of\nbroad content is that a thought or belief with broad content thereby\nhas truth conditions: in some possible circumstances it is true, and\nin others it is false. On the mapping conception, narrow content does\nnot suffice to determine truth conditions in this sense. To determine\ntruth conditions, one needs to fix not only a narrow content but also\na context. For instance, given the narrow content shared by Oscar and\nTwin Oscar when they think, \u201cLake Superior is full of\nwater,\u201d we do not have enough information to say whether that\nthought is true or false in a particular situation. Suppose Lake\nSuperior is full of XYZ. Then Twin Oscar\u2019s thought is true but\nOscar\u2019s thought is false, even though both thoughts have the\nsame narrow content. So it seems that narrow content by itself is not\nenough to determine what truth conditions a thought has. (However, see\nthe following section on \u201cDiagonal Propositions.\u201d)\n\n(3) Finally, although the mapping conception gives us an abstract,\nformal conception of narrow content, it does not give us an algorithm\nfor finding the narrow content of a particular state.\nAlthough apparently any function from contexts to contents would count\nas a \u201cnarrow content\u201d in Fodor\u2019s sense, some of\nthese functions could not really be the content of a mental state. To\nuse a computational analogy, we are really interested only in\n\u201ccomputable\u201d functions from context to content, functions\nthat can be implemented somehow in a human mind, and this suggests\nthat it is not the function itself that is of interest but rather the\nalgorithm by means of which it is computed.\n4.4 Diagonal Propositions\n\nThe complaint that on the mapping conception, narrow contents are not\ntruth conditional, and hence perhaps should not be called\n\u201ccontents\u201d at all, can be met by an interesting twist on\nthe mapping conception. Instead of considering a function from\ncontexts of acquisition to broad contents in its full generality, we\ncan focus our attention on a narrower function, the \u201cdiagonal\nproposition\u201d determined by a Fodorian narrow content. The idea,\nand the term \u201cdiagonal proposition,\u201d were originally\nintroduced by Robert Stalnaker in a different context (Stalnaker 1999,\nespecially papers 4, 6, and 7), but it turns out to be useful here. It\nis not clear that anyone has actually proposed this idea as an account\nof narrow content, but Stalnaker has suggested it as an interpretation\nof Loar\u2019s view (Stalnaker 1990, discussing Loar 1988), and the\nview of Chalmers (1996) has sometimes been understood in this way\n(e.g. by Block and Stalnaker 1999).\n\nRecall that on the mapping conception, a narrow content is a function\nfrom environments or contexts of acquisition to broad contents. Broad\ncontents in turn are thought of as determining truth conditions; that\nis, a broad content will be true in some situations and false in\nothers. How should we think of the environments or contexts that\ndetermine broad content, and the situations in which broad contents\nare true or false? One reasonably natural suggestion is the following.\nOscar and Twin Oscar both actually exist (in Putnam\u2019s fantasy),\nbut they have different environments, different contexts of\nacquisition. We can think of their contexts as including all\nthe objective or nonperspectival facts about the actual world,\nplus a bit more, namely information about their locations in\nthat world. This may be more information than we need, but it gives us\na simple way to characterize contexts, and it is guaranteed to include\neverything relevant to the contribution of the natural and social\nenvironment to the contents of their beliefs. And of course, in\naddition to the actual contexts of Oscar and Twin Oscar, we can\nconsider other possible contexts, other environments that they might\nhave inhabited. In general, we can say that a context of an individual\nat a time is a centered world, a possible world that we\nregard as centered on the relevant individual and time.\n\nWith this background, we can consider a way to visualize the mapping\nconception. We will consider how the account applies to an example\nsimilar to that of Oscar and Twin Oscar. To keep things simple, we\nwill change the example slightly. Instead of regarding Earth and Twin\nEarth as two different planets both of which exist in the actual\nworld, we will consider them as different ways things could have\nturned out to be on our actual planet. In the actual world, the watery\nstuff on Earth is H2O; in a possible counterfactual world,\nit is XYZ instead. We will envision Oscar looking at a beaker full of\na colorless, odorless liquid and thinking a thought that he would\nexpress by saying \u201cthat beaker contains water.\u201d\n\nNow, we consider three possible environments or contexts, which we are\nthinking of as centered worlds. These are:\n\ncontext 1: Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts have been\nacquired in an environment in which the colorless, odorless liquid\nthat falls from the sky and fills the lakes is XYZ. For short, let us\nsay that Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are\nanchored in XYZ. Moreover, the substance in the beaker in\nfront of him is in fact XYZ.\ncontext 2: Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored\nin H2O. Moreover, the substance in the beaker in front of\nhim is in fact H2O.\ncontext 3: As in context 2, Oscar\u2019s\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in H2O. However,\nin context 3, the substance in the beaker is neither H2O\nnor XYZ, but sulfuric acid, H2SO4.\n\n\nIn context 2 and context 3, Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-thoughts\nare about water, i.e. H2O, while in context 1 they are\nabout XYZ. Whether Oscar\u2019s thought about the substance in the\nbeaker is true or not depends on two things: what his thought means,\ni.e. its broad content, and a certain fact about the world, namely\nwhat substance is in the beaker. Since a context includes all the\nobjective facts about a world plus additional information about the\n\u201ccenter\u201d of the world, each context determines a unique\npossible world. For example, if we take context 1 and subtract the\ninformation about the time and individual on which the context is\ncentered, we obtain a possible world we could call w(context 1).\n\nWe can summarize the situation in the following table:\n\n\n\n\nw(context 1)\n\nsubstance:\n\nXYZ\nw(context 2)\n\nsubstance:\n\nH2O\nw(context 3)\n\nsubstance:\n\nH2SO4 \n\n1\n anchor: XYZ;\n\nsubstance: XYZ\nT\nF\nF \n\n2\n anchor: H20;\n\nsubstance: H2O\nF\nT\nF \n\n3\n anchor: H2O;\n\nsubstance: H2SO4\nF\nT\nF \n\n\nThe items in the left-hand column of our table are contexts. The\nhorizontal row to the right of each context represents the truth\nconditions or broad content Oscar\u2019s thought has if it originated\nin the indicated context. For instance, in context 1, Oscar\u2019s\nthought has the broad content that there is XYZ in the beaker. This\nthought is true in the world of context 1, false in the world of\ncontext 2 (since the beaker contains H2O in that world),\nand false in the world of context 3. A suitably extended version of\nour table, then, could be regarded as visually representing the narrow\ncontent of Oscar\u2019s thought about the substance in the beaker, on\nthe mapping conception of narrow content, since it would illustrate,\nfor each context, the broad content associated with Oscar\u2019s\nthought by that context.\n\nNow we can say what the \u201cdiagonal proposition\u201d is. It is\nsimply the proposition represented by the diagonal from the upper left\nto the lower right of the above table. This represents the truth value\nOscar\u2019s belief has, for any context, in the world of that\ncontext. The truth conditions this gives us are different from\nany of the three broad contents Oscar\u2019s belief might have\ndepending on his context. But arguably they also give a better account\nof his narrow content than any of the horizontal propositions does.\nUnaware as he is of the chemical structure of water, Oscar has no\ndirect access to which possible context is his actual context, and\nthus in a sense does not know what broad content his thoughts have. He\nalso does not know for certain what liquid the beaker contains. What\nhe does know is that if his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in XYZ and the substance in\nthe glass is also XYZ, then his belief is true; and if his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in H2O and the\nsubstance in the glass is also H2O, then his belief is\ntrue; and if his \u2018water\u2019-thoughts are anchored in\nH2O and the substance in the glass is\nH2SO4, then his belief is false; and so on. In\nshort, although his internal state does not suffice to determine any\nof the horizontal propositions, it does suffice to determine the\ndiagonal proposition, which therefore seems to do a better job of\ncapturing Oscar\u2019s state of mind than the horizontal propositions\ndo.\n\nThe diagonal proposition view seems to avoid many of the difficulties\nof other approaches to narrow content. In particular, it does provide\ntruth conditions, and hence seems clearly to be a kind of content.\n(However, Kriegel (2008) points out that, while two-dimensional\naccounts like this one and the epistemic account to be discussed next\ncan provide truth conditions for \u201cthe mental analog of a\nsentence\u201d and thus explain how it \u201cputs us in cognitive\ncontact with a state of affairs that constitutes its potential truth\nmaker\u201d (305), it is not so clear how the account can associate\nthe mental analogs of subsentential expressions with worldly things\nand properties. Kriegel offers an account according to which concepts,\nthe mental analogs of predicate terms, denote response-dependent\nproperties.)\n\nThe main difficulties for the diagonal proposition account concern (1)\nhow to apply it in order to determine the narrow content of a given\nmental state, and (2) the fact that it gives a way of defining the\ntruth conditions of a mental state only in centered worlds in which\nthe state actually exists. In the example above, for instance, Oscar\nis presumed to be in the same mental state in each context, although\ndifferences in how he came to be in that state affect its content. But\nthis raises the problem of what we need to \u201chold constant\u201d\nin considering various counterfactual contexts in order to be\nconsidering a context in which Oscar is in the relevant state. These\nissues are considered briefly in section 5.1.\n4.5 Sets of Maximal Epistemic Possibilities\n\nA final view about the nature of narrow content has some striking\nstructural resemblances to the idea of a diagonal proposition, but is\nmotivated very differently. This is the view of David Chalmers (1996,\n2002); a related view has been defended by David Lewis (1979, 1994).\nIn a nutshell, the view construes narrow contents as sets of maximal\nepistemic possibilities, or scenarios. (Scenarios closely\nresemble the centered worlds used to define diagonal propositions.\nWhether there is a centered world for every scenario, and vice versa,\nare debated issues: see Chalmers 2006, section 3.4.) The motivation\nfor this view requires some development.\n\nNarrow content is intended to capture a subject\u2019s perspective on\nthe world, the way the world is according to the subject. A very\nnatural way to think of this is to consider the narrow content of a\nbelief or other thought to be a way of dividing up the ways things\ncould conceivably be into those that are compatible with the thought\nand those that are ruled out by it.\n\nOf course, broad contents also produce a kind of partitioning\nof possibilities. Any sort of content that determines truth\nconditions will rule in some possibilities and rule out others. But\nbroad content does not provide the kind of partitioning needed for\nnarrow content. Twin Earth is ruled out by the broad content of my\nbelief that the lakes are full of water, since the lakes on Twin Earth\ndo not contain water. But narrow content was introduced precisely in\norder to have a kind of content that my Twin and I share, so the\nnarrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water should come\nout true in a Twin Earth environment centered on my Twin, just as my\nTwin\u2019s parallel thought comes out true there. A related way to\nsee why Twin Earth is not ruled out by the narrow content of my\nthought is to notice that I can imagine finding out that all the\nwatery stuff in my actual environment is XYZ. In that case I\nwould not conclude that the lakes do not contain water; instead I\nwould conclude that water is XYZ. So the narrow content of my thought\nthat the lakes contain water does not rule out Twin Earth, even though\nits broad content does.\n\nChalmers develops this line of thought with the help of the following\napparatus. A thought is said to be epistemically possible if\nit cannot be ruled out a priori, i.e. if its negation cannot be\nconclusively established without any appeal to experience. Such a\nthought corresponds to an epistemic possibility, a way the world could\nbe for all one can tell a priori. A scenario is then defined\nto be a maximally specific epistemic possibility, an epistemic\npossibility with no detail left unspecified. Epistemic space\nis the set of all such scenarios. Any thought carves out a particular\nregion of epistemic space by endorsing some scenarios and\nexcluding others. A thought endorses a scenario when, if we\naccept that the scenario is actual, we should accept the thought as\ntrue. For instance, if we accept as actual a scenario in which the\nliquid that falls from the skies and fills the lakes is XYZ, we should\naccept as true the thought that water is XYZ. We can then think of the\nnarrow content of a thought as constituted by the way the thought\ndivides epistemic space into those scenarios it endorses and those it\nexcludes. More specifically, we can think of the narrow content of a\nthought as a function from scenarios to truth values, or (equivalently\nif we have only two truth values) simply as a set of scenarios, namely\nthose endorsed by the thought. (This paragraph closely follows\nChalmers 2002, p. 610. Chalmers gives related but somewhat more\ndetailed expositions in Chalmers 2003, especially pp. 47, 54, and in\nChalmers 2006, especially pp. 76ff. Note that a thought endorses a\nscenario iff the scenario verifies the thought: Chalmers 2006 uses the\nlatter terminology but not the former.)\n\nScenarios clearly have much in common with centered worlds. Indeed, it\nmay be possible to simply identify scenarios with centered worlds.\n(Chalmers is cautious about this, noting reasons that some might\nreject this identification, but makes use of it for some purposes.) If\nscenarios are thought of as centered worlds, then the idea that narrow\ncontent is a function from scenarios to truth values is obviously a\nclose cousin of the idea that narrow contents are diagonal\npropositions, which can also be thought of as functions from centered\nworlds to truth values. The differences between the two accounts\nshould not be underestimated, however. An immediate formal difference\nis that narrow contents on Chalmers\u2019 approach are defined over a\nlarger class of centered worlds than are diagonal propositions. On the\ndiagonal approach, the centered worlds with respect to which a thought\nis evaluated must include a token of that very thought at the center,\nwhile this is not the case on the approach we are now considering.\nAnother substantive difference between the two views is that they lead\nto very different strategies for determining narrow contents, as will\nemerge in sections 5.1 and 5.4.\n5. Strategies for Determining Narrow Content\n\nWe have seen that there are various sorts of thing a narrow content\ncould be: a description, a conceptual role, a function from contexts\nto broad contents, a diagonal proposition, or a set of maximal\nepistemic possibilities. It is a further question which items of the\nrelevant sort (which diagonal propositions or epistemic possibilities,\nfor example) constitute the narrow content of a particular state of a\nparticular subject.\n\nHow can we find out what the narrow content of a mental state\nis? Even more centrally, what is it about a mental state that makes it\nappropriate to describe it as having a particular narrow content? In\nthe remainder of this section, I consider several strategies for\ndetermining narrow content. I do not address the issue of whether\nthese strategies should be regarded as giving the essential nature of\nnarrow content, or merely as heuristic devices for approximating it in\npractice.\n\nArguably, it is these differences over the appropriate strategy for\ndetermining narrow contents that are the most important differences\nbetween rival views of narrow content. Although we have considered\nseveral different views about the sort of semantic entities narrow\ncontents might be, all these views, with the exception of conceptual\nrole semantics, are close cousins of the view that narrow contents are\nsets of centered worlds. The most substantive differences between\nrival views concern how to determine which centered worlds are\nincluded in the narrow content of a particular state of a particular\nsubject.\n5.1 Diagonalization Strategy\n\nA first strategy fits neatly with the view of narrow content as a\ndiagonal proposition. If we want to know the narrow content of a\nparticular mental state, we simply construct the diagonal proposition.\nThat is, we first envision a variety of situations or environments in\nwhich the mental state could be embedded, i.e. a set of contexts or\ncentered worlds that contain, at the center, the very mental state\nwhose content we are interested in. For each of these contexts, we use\nour knowledge of broad content and how it is determined to discover\nthe broad content that the mental state would have in that context.\nAnd then we determine whether, in the world of that context, a belief\nwith that broad content would be true.\n\nThere are three main problems with this strategy. First, it treats\nbroad content as fundamental, and narrow content as derivative.\nHowever, for many advocates of narrow content (e.g. Chalmers 2002),\nnarrow content is at least as fundamental as broad content. In fact,\nit is tempting to regard broad content as determined by narrow content\nin conjunction with facts about context. But the strategy we are\nconsidering can only be applied to determine narrow content if we\nalready have an independent way of determining broad content.\n\nA second problem for the diagonalization strategy is a problem of\nscope (Chalmers, 2002). Although the diagonalization strategy yields a\ntruth-conditional notion of content, the only centered worlds at which\nthe diagonal proposition is evaluated will be worlds that contain at\ntheir center the mental state we are interested in. In effect this\nmeans that every mental state represents itself as existing. But it is\npuzzling why I could not have mental states whose content has nothing\nto do with their own existence. Chalmers offers these examples\n(Chalmers 2002, p. 625): it seems that my thought that I am a\nphilosopher should be true in worlds centered on a philosopher even if\nhe is not currently thinking that he is a philosopher. Again, it seems\nthat the thought that someone is thinking should be false, not\nundefined, at centered worlds that do not contain a thinking\nperson.\n\nThird, there is the problem of what to \u201chold constant\u201d in\ndetermining which possible contexts to consider (Block and Stalnaker\n1999). The strategy requires us to consider contexts that include the\nmental state whose content we are interested in. But exactly what\ncounts as a context that includes a particular mental state? And how\nclosely, and in which respects, must the version of the state in the\nother worlds resemble the version in the actual world?\n\nBlock and Stalnaker argue in some detail that the likely candidates\nfor what to hold constant all give the wrong results. Consider how we\nmight find the diagonal proposition associated with Oscar\u2019s\nbelief that water is wet. Suppose that a belief is, or is associated\nwith, a mental analog of a sentence. We will suppose that, like a\nsentence, a mental token can be identified separately from its\nmeaning. Then Oscar\u2019s mental token, like the sentence\n\u201cWater is wet,\u201d could, in some possible mental language,\nmean that dogs have fur. Now if in diagonalizing we consider all\npossible worlds centered on someone who possesses the same mental\nsentence as Oscar\u2019s water-sentence, regardless of its meaning,\nwe get a diagonal proposition that is much too unconstrained to serve\nas a narrow content. We surely do not want to say that the narrow\ncontent of Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet has the value True\nin a world that contains no remotely watery substance, but in which\ndogs are furry and the mental token in question means that dogs are\nfurry.\n\nSo it is not sufficient to hold a syntactically identified mental\ntoken constant in deciding which worlds to include in the diagonal\nproposition. We must somehow consider worlds in which the token\ncarries the same meaning it carries in the actual world. However, if\nwe consider only worlds in which the token has the broad\nmeaning that water is wet, the diagonal proposition will be too\nconstrained to play the role of narrow content: it will be false, not\ntrue, in a world centered on Twin Oscar.\n\nStill another possibility is to hold constant, not the broad content\nof the mental token, but its narrow content. This will give the\nresults we want, but at the cost of making the account completely\ncircular; diagonalizing cannot be a useful strategy for discovering\nnarrow contents if we must already know the narrow content of a mental\ntoken in order to apply the strategy.\n5.2 Subtraction Strategy\n\nThe subtraction strategy (Brown 1992) is an attempt to identify the\nnarrow contents of a subject\u2019s beliefs by considering all of the\ncontents of the subject\u2019s belief and subtracting those that are\nnot narrow. The contents that remain must be narrow. More\nprecisely, if a content of my belief is something I believe, then a\nnarrow content of my belief is something that I believe\nand that is believed by every possible duplicate of me\n(possibly within some restricted class of worlds). I say\n\u201cordinary content\u201d instead of \u201cbroad content\u201d\nhere, since the subtraction strategy presupposes that not all ordinary\ncontents are broad.\n\nTo see why this strategy might be appealing, we can consider an\nanalogy with perception. (A similar analogy with action is also\npossible.) Consider the perceptual state of someone looking at an\napple. We can characterize this state in terms of what the person\nsees, just as we can characterize Oscar\u2019s belief state in terms\nof what he believes. In this case, our subject sees an apple, so one\nway to characterize her perceptual state is as \u201cseeing an\napple,\u201d just as one way to describe Oscar\u2019s belief state\nis as \u201cbelieving that water is wet.\u201d However, we can\neasily construct scenarios in which our perceiver is in exactly the\nsame narrow state, but does not see an apple \u2014 perhaps because\neverything except the apple\u2019s facing surface has been cut away.\nWe can easily find a content of the subject\u2019s perception that is\na content of the very same perceptual state but which characterizes it\nmore narrowly: the subject sees the facing surface of the apple, and\nit is by virtue of seeing the facing surface that she sees the apple\nas a whole. Characterizing the perceptual state as \u201cseeing the\nfacing surface of an apple\u201d is a narrower characterization in a\nvery simple sense: if we consider alternative situations in which the\nsubject is intrinsically exactly the same, but her environment is\ndifferent, we will observe that in every situation in which she sees\nan apple, she also sees its facing surface, but that there are\nadditional situations in which she sees the facing surface but does\nnot thereby see an entire apple. Similarly, if we consider\nOscar\u2019s belief that water is wet, we notice that a Twin\nEarth-like scenario provides a situation in which he is in the very\nsame cognitive state but does not believe that water is wet. So we\nlook for other contents of his belief, other things he believes, that\ncharacterize his state more narrowly. In this case we notice that in\nevery situation in which he is in exactly the same intrinsic state and\nbelieves that water is wet, he also believes that the colorless,\nodorless liquid called \u2018water\u2019 is wet, but not conversely.\nSo this latter belief seems to characterize his intrinsic state more\nnarrowly than does the content \u201cwater is wet.\u201d\n\nIt is important to notice that neither the perceptual content of\nseeing the facing surface of an apple, nor the belief content of\nbelieving that the colorless, odorless liquid called\n\u2018water\u2019 is wet, is completely narrow. We can find still\nmore remote possibilities in which the subject\u2019s perceptual or\nbelief state is exactly the same, but he or she does not have this\nperceptual or belief content. (The \u201capple\u201d could be a wax\nimitation or a holographic projection; Oscar\u2019s Twin could live\nin an environment in which the word \u2018liquid\u2019 refers to\nvery finely granulated solids.) To find truly narrow contents we will\nneed to press our subtraction strategy still further, and appeal to\nobjects that are very different from the ordinary objects of\nperception or belief \u2014 perhaps colored shapes or sense-data in\nthe case of perception; perhaps beliefs about the subject\u2019s\nperceptual inputs and behavioral outputs in the case of belief (cf.\nMcDermott 1986).\n\nThis suggests an important point which is rarely mentioned (but see\nRecanati 1994 for a related observation). Narrowness need not be\nconstrued as an all-or-nothing property. We can understand it instead\nas a matter of degree: one content of a mental state is narrower than\nanother the further away from the actual world we need to go in\nlogical space in order to find a world in which the subject\u2019s\nintrinsic properties are the same but the state does not have that\ncontent. (Alternatively, we could relativize the notion of narrow\ncontent to a set of possibilities; the more possibilities the set\nincludes, the fewer contents will count as narrow. For many purposes\nwe never consider Twin-Earth possibilities; for such purposes the\nproposition that water is wet may count as a narrow content of a\nsubject\u2019s belief.) On this way of thinking of things, narrowness\nas it is usually defined is a limiting case: narrowness relative to\nthe set of all metaphysically possible worlds. The concept of\nnarrowness may be useful even if the limiting case never occurs, just\nas the concept of flatness is useful even though in this world the\nlimiting case of absolute flatness never occurs.\n\nPossible problems for the subtraction strategy include the following.\n(1) The strategy presupposes that all the narrow contents of our\nbeliefs are included in the ordinary contents of belief, so that once\nwe have subtracted the non-narrow contents away the narrow contents\nwill remain. On many conceptions of narrow content, however, narrow\ncontent is a more specialized and technical notion than this, and we\ncannot suppose that the ordinary contents of belief will include\nnarrow contents. (2) The conception of narrow content with which the\nsubtraction strategy fits most naturally is the descriptive content\nconception discussed in section 2.1. It inherits the principal\nobjection to that view, namely that it is not clear that ordinary\nlanguage can offer a narrow vocabulary sufficient to describe the\nnarrow contents of our thoughts. Two points should be made in response\nto this worry. First, while the subtraction strategy assumes that the\nnarrow contents of belief are a subset of the ordinary contents of\nbelief, it need not be committed to the view that all of these\nordinary contents are describable in natural language. Second, as\nnoted above, we can think of completely narrow content as a limiting\nideal case. The subtraction strategy offers a way of relating broad\nbeliefs to the narrower beliefs on which they depend. This may be\nuseful even if the process does not terminate in beliefs which are\nabsolutely narrow. (3) Although the subtraction strategy offers a way\nof determining one\u2019s total narrow content, it is not clear\nwhether or how it could be applied to more specific belief states. (4)\nThe subtraction strategy also shares with the diagonalization strategy\nthe problem that it gives us a method of identifying narrow contents\nonly if we already have an independent method of identifying contents\nin general.\n5.3 Ideal Environment Strategy\n\nThis strategy is proposed by Dennett (1982). The idea is that a\n(centered) world is included in one\u2019s narrow content if and only\nif it is a world to which one is ideally suited. Place a subject in\nsome environments, and everything will work out extremely well: the\nsubject\u2019s attempts to satisfy his or her desires will succeed\nevery time. Other environments will be much less friendly; somehow the\nsubject\u2019s actions will never turn out to have quite the desired\neffects. Dennett\u2019s thought is roughly that we can capture the\nway the world is from the subject\u2019s point of view by taking the\nset of centered worlds to which the subject is ideally adapted. One\nattraction of this strategy is that it does not make narrow content\nparasitic on broad content; another is that it does not require the\nsubject to be able to answer questions or reflect on the content of\nthe subject\u2019s thoughts, so that it could easily be applied to\ncats and dogs as well as to humans.\n\nA possible problem for the ideal environment strategy is that, while\nit may give us a way to determine a subject\u2019s total view of the\nworld, it does not provide a way of parceling out narrow contents to\nmore specific states.\n\nA second problem is that the strategy does not seem to properly\ndiscriminate cognitive content from other sorts of information a\nsubject\u2019s body may carry. A baby is better adapted to worlds in\nwhich extreme heat can damage its body than to worlds in which it\ncannot. When the baby touches something hot it automatically jerks\naway. This action has a useful purpose in a world in which heat is\ndamaging, but would be pointless in a world in which it was not. But\nit does not follow that the baby believes that extreme heat\nis damaging. (See Stalnaker 1989, White 1991.)\n\nA third problem is that, in some cases in which an individual\u2019s\nstates do seem contentful, the ideal environment strategy, as stated\nabove, seems to yield the wrong content. In the most obvious sense, I\nam better suited to worlds that do not contain a homicidal maniac who\nwants to kill me than I am to worlds that do contain such a maniac,\neven if I believe that such a maniac exists. So it seems that the\nideal environment strategy will not correctly include the content of\nthis belief among those it attributes to me. (Related examples are\noffered by Stalnaker 1989, White 1991, and Chalmers 2002.) As\nStalnaker notes (1999: 182\u2013183), Dennett is better understood to\nmean, not that the worlds I am best suited to are those in which I\nwould do best, but rather that they are those with which I am best\nprepared to cope. But refining this account is a challenging task.\n(For instance, martial arts training might prepare me to cope with\ndangers that I do not believe to exist, raising the worry that the\nideal environment strategy on this interpretation will attribute to me\nbeliefs I do not in fact have.)\n5.4 Epistemic Strategy\n\nThe epistemic strategy is recommended by Chalmers (2002, 2003, 2006).\nThe framework that gives rise to this strategy was presented in\nsection 3.5. Narrow contents are to be thought of as effecting a\npartition of scenarios, which are similar to the centered worlds\nemployed by the diagonalization strategy, into those endorsed by the\nthought and those excluded by it. But how exactly are we to determine\nwhich scenarios are which? On the diagonalization strategy, we make\nuse of our preexisting grasp of ordinary content to determine what\nordinary content the thought would express if it were located at the\ncenter of a particular centered world, and then determine whether that\nordinary content is true at that centered world. The epistemic\nstrategy is radically different, and treats narrow content as at least\nas fundamental as ordinary content.\n\nSo, what function from scenarios to truth values constitutes the\nnarrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water? Put\nslightly differently, which scenarios does this narrow content include\nand which does it exclude? To find out whether the narrow content of\nthe thought that the lakes contain water includes a given scenario, I\nconsider the hypothesis that the scenario is actual. For example, if I\nconsider the hypothesis that a scenario in which the oceans and lakes\naround me contain H2O is actual, then I will be led by a\npriori reasoning to the conclusion that the lakes contain water;\nhence, the narrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water\nincludes this Twin Earthly scenario. Similarly, if I consider the\nhypothesis that a scenario in which the oceans and lakes contain XYZ\nis actual, I will still conclude that the lakes contain water, since\nin Twin Earth scenarios my water-thoughts are about XYZ. So the Twin\nEarthly scenario is also included in the narrow content of my thought\nthat the lakes contain water. By contrast, the narrow content of my\nthought that water is H2O will separate these two\nscenarios. If I consider the hypothesis that an Earthly scenario is\nactual, I will conclude that water is H2O, so the narrow\ncontent of the thought that water is H2O includes Earthly\nscenarios. However, if I consider the hypothesis that a Twin Earthly\nscenario is actual, I will conclude that water is not H2O\n(rather, it is XYZ), so the narrow content of my thought that water is\nH2O excludes Twin Earthly scenarios.\n\nIt is crucial that when I consider the hypothesis that the\nTwin-Earthly (or any other) scenario is actual, and ask whether, in\nthat case, my thought that lakes contain water is true, I am\nnot asking whether, had a Twin-Earthly world obtained, lakes\nwould have contained water. The answer to that question is\n\u201cno,\u201d but it is a different question. When I ask this\nlatter question, I am considering the Twin-Earthly world as\ncounterfactual. Presupposing that the world is not actually that way,\nI ask what would be true if it were that way. Such questions, in which\nwe consider alternative worlds as counterfactual, are the appropriate\nway to determine issues of metaphysical possibility. The sort\nof question relevant to epistemic possibility is different.\nIt involves considering scenarios as actual, not as\ncounterfactual: seeing what is the case if the world\nis that way, not seeing what would be the case if\nthe world were that way. Questions about epistemic\npossibility, in which we consider scenarios as actual, are naturally\nposed in indicative conditionals: if the substance in the lakes\nis XYZ, is it water?\n\nA full account must say much more than this about precisely what it is\nto consider a scenario as actual, and what it is for a scenario to be\nendorsed by a particular belief. In order to consider a scenario, we\nmust have a complete description of some sort. On the other hand,\nthere must be restrictions on the vocabulary in which the description\nis expressed. In particular, it cannot contain expressions like\n\u2018water\u2019, for which Twin Earth examples can be constructed.\nChalmers offers a detailed account that addresses such questions.\n(This is presented briefly in Chalmers 2002 and Chalmers 2003, and in\nmuch more detail in Chalmers 2006.) Here is the short version\n(Chalmers 2002, p. 611):\n\nTo consider a scenario W as actual is to consider the hypothesis that\nD is the case, where D is a canonical description of W. When\nscenarios are understood as centered worlds, a canonical description\nwill conjoin an objective description of the character of W\n(including its mental and physical character, for example), with an\nindexical description of the center\u2019s location within\nW. The objective description will be restricted to semantically\nneutral terms: roughly, terms that are not themselves vulnerable\nto Twin Earth thought experiments (thus excluding most names, natural\nkind terms, indexicals, and terms used with semantic deference). The\nindexical description will allow in addition indexical terms such as\n\u2018I\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019, to specify the center\u2019s\nlocation. We can then say that W verifies a thought T when a\nhypothesis that D is the case implies T. Or equivalently, where S is a\nlinguistic expression of T, W verifies T when a material conditional\n\u2018if D, then S\u2019 is a priori.\n\n\nUnlike the diagonalization strategy, the epistemic strategy does not\ndepend on a prior determination of the broad content of the expression\nor state. Moreover, it does not require that narrow contents be\nevaluated only in scenarios that contain a token of the mental state\nat their center.\n\nPotential problems for the epistemic strategy include: (1) whether it\ncan be applied to nonhuman animals, many of whom presumably also have\ncontentful mental states; (2) whether a canonical language that\nsatisfies the necessary constraints is possible (see e.g. Schroeter\n2004; Soames 2005, pp. 216\u2013218; Sawyer 2007); and (3) whether a\nversion of the \u201cwhat is held constant\u201d problem for the\ndiagonalization strategy also poses problems for the epistemic\nstrategy. (This last point is discussed a bit further in section\n6.2.)\n6. Types and Tokens\n\nWe have frequently considered the narrow content of Oscar\u2019s\nbeliefs about water, for instance his belief that water is wet. Is the\nmental state we are concerned with here a type or a token? That is,\nare we concerned with a particular instance of a mental state, which\noccurs at a particular place and time, namely Oscar\u2019s belief on\nthis particular occasion that water is wet, or are we concerned with a\ngeneral kind of belief, the belief that water is wet, which many\ndifferent people could have on many different occasions?\n\nIt seems that it cannot be the general type of belief that we are\ninterested in here, at least not if the type in question is\n\u201cbelief that water is wet,\u201d since different people (or\neven the same person on different occasions) could have beliefs of\nthis type which had different narrow contents. Oscar is ignorant of\nthe molecular structure of water; he identifies water as a clear,\nodorless, colorless substance that falls from the skies and fills the\nlakes. As we have already seen, Twin Oscar shares Oscar\u2019s narrow\ncontent, but in his environment this narrow content determines that he\nbelieves that XYZ is wet, not that water is wet. However, an earthly\nexpert chemist who has done years of laboratory research on water, and\nis well aware of its molecular structure, will have a different\nwater-concept than Oscar does, and his belief that water is wet will\nhave a different narrow content than Oscar\u2019s does. The\nchemist\u2019s Twin Earth duplicate does not believe that XYZ is wet,\nsince he is aware of the chemical composition of water and his beliefs\nexplicitly concern H2O. He believes that water is wet\n(though he also believes, falsely, that the substance that fills the\nlakes and emerges from the taps is water).\n\nAlthough Oscar and the chemist share the (broad) belief that water is\nwet, they have different narrow contents associated with this belief.\nSo when we say that it is a belief that has a particular narrow\ncontent, we cannot be speaking of a general type of belief, at least\nnot if the type is determined by the broad content of the belief.\nRather, we must be speaking of a particular token belief, in this case\nOscar\u2019s belief on a particular occasion that water is wet.\n\nWe cannot completely evade issues about the nature of the token mental\nstates we are considering, however. Even if the object of our concern\nis a particular token, we need to know how to identify the particular\ntoken we are interested in. Compare: suppose we decided we wanted to\nknow the weight of a certain animal. A first question would be whether\nwe are talking about a type of animal or a token animal. In this case\nwe almost certainly intend to refer to the token rather than the type.\n(If the token belongs to a type of animal all or most of whose tokens\nhave weights that fall in a fairly narrow range, we may later decide\nthat we can also assign a weight to the type, but it is the weight of\nthe tokens that is primary.) In this case there seems to be no\nproblem: we can easily determine the weight of this animal, and even\ndetermine what its weight would be in other environments, without\ndeciding whether the relevant type might be Pomeranians, or dogs, or\ncanines, for example.\n\nHowever, our ability to determine the weight of a token animal depends\non the fact that we already know what animals are and how to\nidentify them. If someone told us to find the weight of that\nthing over there, we would need a further specification of\nthe thing in question before we could find its weight. Which thing?\nThe dog? The dog\u2019s front leg? The dog\u2019s fur? The cat over\nthere next to the dog? Or possibly even the disjoint thing consisting\nof both the cat and the dog? It is not clear that asking about the\nnarrow content of Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet is a much\nmore clearly defined task than asking about the weight of that thing\nover there. Do we really have a means of picking out the mental state\nin question in a way that distinguishes it from other beliefs in the\nvicinity? What properties does it have? For example, does it have a\nsyntactic structure? Is it an intrinsic state? Does it have a\nparticular location in the brain? Is it entirely distinct from\nOscar\u2019s beliefs that water is a liquid, that water can form\ndroplets, and that water feels a certain way to the touch?\n\nThe problem of identifying the bearer of narrow content is obviously\nclosely related to the problem of what to hold constant when employing\nthe diagonalization strategy. But the problem may also affect views on\nwhich we do not need to require that a token state be present in a\ncounterfactual situation in order to determine whether its narrow\ncontent would be true in that situation. It still seems that in order\nto know exactly what question we are asking, we need to know what it\nis whose content we are evaluating in the counterfactual situations.\nWe need to know what the token state is in the actual world whether or\nnot we insist on its presence in the counterfactual one.\n7. A Critique of Narrow Content\n\nSince the first introduction of the term \u201cnarrow content,\u201d\nsome authors have doubted that there is any useful concept for it to\ncapture (see e.g. Stalnaker 1990; Burge 2007, pp. 11\u201313). The\nmost sustained critique of narrow content is a relatively recent book,\nNarrow Content, by Juhani Yli-Vakkuri and John Hawthorne\n(Yli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne 2018).\n7.1 Defining Narrow Content\n\nYli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne (hereafter YVH) begin by offering a rigorous\ndefinition of narrow content intended to capture mainstream ideas in a\nmore precise way. For YVH, \u201cthoughts\u201d are token\nrepresentational mental states \u201cwhich occur in an agent at a\ntime\u201d (18). A \u201ccontent assignment\u201d is a systematic\nassignment of contents to thoughts, i.e a function from thoughts to\ncontents. Narrowness is a property of content assignments: roughly, a\ncontent assignment is narrow if, for any thought, the content assigned\nto it is completely determined by the purely qualitative properties of\nthe thought and the purely qualitative relations it stands in to other\nthings going on in the agent (see YVH 2018, Chapter 2, for a more\ncareful and detailed account). A consequence of the definition is\nthat, given a narrow content assignment, if two agents are exact\nduplicates (like Oscar and Twin Oscar), then any thought of one of\nthem will be assigned the same content as the corresponding thought of\nthe other.\n\nYVH do not deny that narrow content assignments are possible, but they\ndo argue that there is unlikely to be any narrow content assignment\nthat plays a theoretically useful role. A plausible minimal\nrequirement for a narrow content assignment to be useful is that it be\n\u201ctruth conditional,\u201d in the following sense: for any\nthought, the content assigned to that thought should determine,\nrelative to the circumstances in which the thought actually occurs,\nthe truth value that the thought actually has. One of their central\narguments, the \u201cparameter proliferation argument,\u201d\nattempts to show that the only way for a narrow content assignment to\nbe truth conditional is for it to employ a problematic notion of\ncontent (specifically, a notion of content with inappropriate\n\u201cparameters,\u201d in a sense to be explained next).\n\nBy \u201ccontent,\u201d YVH mean a function from indices to truth\nvalues, where an \u201cindex\u201d is a sequence of parameters. In\nthe simplest case, an index will consist of a single parameter, namely\na possible world. In that case, a content will be a function from\npossible worlds to truth values. In the table used to illustrate the\ndiagonal proposition conception of narrow content in\n section 4.4\n of this entry, the rows of the table represent contents of this\nsort.\n7.2 The Parameter Proliferation Argument\n\nIt seems plausible that narrow contents must be more discriminating\nthan this. YVH introduce several examples to show that indices for\nnarrow contents must include an agent parameter as well as a world\nparameter (pp. 69\u201371). To take a slight variant of the simplest\none, suppose that Varnsen and Twin Varnsen are sitting in identical\noffices, and each is thinking \u201cI am in room 250.\u201d Varnsen\nis in room 250, but Twin Varnsen is in room 251, so their thoughts\nhave different truth values. The thoughts occur in the same possible\nworld and have (since the two are duplicates) the same (narrow)\ncontent. This is not possible if indices contain only a world\nparameter, but if there is also an agent parameter, then the differing\ntruth values are not a problem, since the thoughts occur in, and are\ntherefore evaluated at, different indices. Similar considerations show\nthe need for a time parameter in addition to world and agent\nparameters.\n\nIf we modify the conception of content by letting indices contain, in\naddition to a possible world parameter, parameters for an agent and a\ntime, we get a conception of content on which a content is a function\nfrom triples of a world, an agent, and a time to truth values. This\nconception is one way of capturing the kind of content represented by\nthe diagonal proposition in\n section 4.4.\n The diagonal proposition was a function from centered worlds to truth\nvalues, and a centered world can be thought of as a triple of a world,\nan agent, and a time (with the agent and time fixing the\n\u201ccenter\u201d of the centered world). On this conception,\nOscar\u2019s and Twin Oscar\u2019s thoughts can have different truth\nvalues even though they have the same content, since, although the\nworld and time parameters of the index in which their thoughts occur\nare the same, the agent parameter is different.\n\nMany writers have thought that this conception of content, or\nsomething very similar, is well suited to capture the notion of narrow\ncontent. Both the diagonal proposition conception, and the view of\nnarrow contents as sets of maximal epistemic possibilities, can be\nunderstood in this way. The parameter proliferation argument gives\nreasons to think that, unless we add still more parameters, content\nassignments will still not be able to determine the correct truth\nvalues for all thoughts.\n\nTo show that worlds, agents, and times do not suffice, YVH employ the\nmuch-discussed case of Mirror Man (YVH 2018, pp. 76\u201377). Mirror Man\nhas a completely symmetrical brain: his left hemisphere is a mirror\nimage of his right hemisphere. Mirror Man is thinking two\nqualitatively identical thoughts, one in his left hemisphere and one\nin his right hemisphere. Both thoughts would be expressed by\n\u201cKit is human,\u201d but in the first thought the mental analog\nof the name \u2018Kit\u2019 is related to a person on Mirror\nMan\u2019s left in such a way that it refers to that person, while in\nthe second thought the distinct but qualitatively identical name\n\u2018Kit\u2019 refers to a visually exact wax replica located on\nMirror Man\u2019s right. Mirror Man is of course qualitatively\nexactly like himself, and both thoughts stand in all the same\nqualitative relations to the rest of Mirror Man. So a narrow content\nassignment must assign both thoughts the same content. Yet the first\nthought is true and the second thought is false. If content is a\nfunction from world, agent, time triples to truth values, then a\nnarrow content assignment must assign one of the two thoughts the\nwrong truth value, since both occur in the same world, are thoughts of\nthe same agent, and occur at the same time.\n\nThis is not the end of the argument: further examples are introduced\nto show that adding further parameters (for example, for location)\nstill results in conceptions of content that are vulnerable to\ncounterexamples. In the end, YVH suggest that the only parameters\nwhose addition is capable of avoiding all the counterexamples (for\nexample, a parameter for thoughts) will result in an extreme and\nunattractive form of relativism.\n7.3 Responses to the Parameter Proliferation Argument\n\nHow much wiggle room have YVH left the narrow content advocate? A\nnumber of responses have been attempted (many of them already\nanticipated in YVH 2018).\n\nFirst, some critics focus on the Mirror Man example. One approach is\nto suggest that mirrored duplicates are not in fact qualitatively\nidentical (Chalmers 2018, Jerzak 2021). Another is to suggest that the\ntwo hemispheres of Mirror Man\u2019s brain are in effect two separate\nagents, so that the agent parameter is enough to give the two thoughts\ndifferent truth values (Hattiangadi 2019). One problem with this kind\nof response is that YVH have alternative examples that pose similar\nproblems but cannot be rejected in these ways (YVH 2018, pp.\n78\u201379, 93\u201394).\n\nSecond, one can question the idea that a content assignment should\nassign contents to individual thoughts. An alternative approach is to\nassign contents not to individual thoughts, but to an agent. YVH call\nthis a \u201ccoarse\u201d content assignment, and argue that such an\nassignment cannot serve the explanatory purposes of narrow content\nadvocates. Jerzak (2021) notes that assigning contents to thoughts\nassumes that thoughts are atomistic, and argues that on a more\nholistic view like that of Stalnaker (1990), coarse content\nassignments would be more appropriate. Byrne (2021) also defends\ncoarse content assignments, and criticizes YVH\u2019s objections to\nthem (though Byrne thinks that coarse assignments will only make\nthings worse for the defender of narrow content). In their reply to\nByrne (YVH 2021a), YVH concede that some of their criticisms of coarse\nassignments are not decisive, and go on to make some interesting\nsuggestions about how a narrow content advocate might try to construct\na suitable notion of narrow content for coarse content assignments.\nThey show that on one way of doing so, \u201cMirror Man would not\npose a threat\u201d (YVH 2021a, p. 3051). (Of course, they think that\nother threats remain.)\n\nThird, one can question YVH\u2019s definition of narrow content in a\ndifferent way. For YVH, a narrow content assignment must supervene on\nthe total qualitative state of an agent. As Chalmers points out, one\ncan be an internalist about mental content without requiring a content\nassignment to be this restrictive. Instead of requiring that content\nsupervene on the agent\u2019s qualitative properties, one could\nsimply require that it supervene on internal properties, where these\nmight include the agent\u2019s identity and the identities of\nparticular thoughts or experiences. As Chalmers puts it, the resulting\nview of content, although it would not have the consequence that exact\nduplicates must share all their mental contents, might still be\n\u201cinternalist enough to be interesting\u201d (Chalmers 2018).\nYVH call such views \u201cquasi-internalist,\u201d and this notion\nof content \u201cquasi-narrow\u201d (YVH 2018, Chapter 5).\n\nFourth, one might bite the bullet and embrace one of the two radical\nforms of relativism discussed by YVH. The simpler one is to add\nthoughts as parameters, resulting in the view that YVH call\n\u201cthought-relativism\u201d (pp. 80\u201381). (The other one is\n\u201cextension-assignment relativism.\u201d) YVH give detailed\narguments against such views, but Chalmers suggests that they might\nstill have promise (Chalmers 2018). As Chalmers notes, it seems that\nwe can have thoughts like \u201cthe thinker of this very thought is\nhuman,\u201d where the truth or falsity of the thought depends on the\nidentity of the thought token being evaluated. Speaks (2021) explores\nsome ways of developing thought-relativism, but argues that the view,\nif developed in such a way that it gives the right results about a\npriori knowledge, will \u201ccollapse into quasi-internalism\u201d\n(Speaks 2021, p. 3044).\n8. Conclusion\n\nIt should be evident that the idea of narrow content is highly\ncontroversial. Some thinkers reject the very idea of narrow content,\nwhile to others it seems an attractive way to think about the kind or\naspect of mental content that most closely captures the\nsubject\u2019s perspective on the world, the nature of rational\nbelief and inference, and the nature and extent of a priori knowledge.\nEven among its advocates, however, there has been substantial\ndisagreement on the precise form a theory of narrow content should\ntake. In their detailed and thorough critique of narrow content,\nYli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne (2018) have substantially clarified the\nissues and the possible forms a theory of narrow content might take.\nIt will be interesting to see whether their book will mark the end of\ndiscussions of narrow content, or whether it will instead reinvigorate\nthe discussion.\n",
