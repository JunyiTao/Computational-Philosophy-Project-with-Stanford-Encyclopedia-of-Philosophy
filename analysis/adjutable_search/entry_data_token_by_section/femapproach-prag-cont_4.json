    "main_text": "The Reality of Racial Identities\n5. The Reality of Racial Identities\n\nLike gender and sexuality, race is a social-material category that is\nnot simply given in nature. Scholars continue to debate precisely when\nmodern notions of race were created, but since at least the late\neighteenth century, general patterns of white privilege and supremacy\nand the domination of non-white people have existed. Given the\noppressive origins of the concept of race and of whiteness in\nparticular, it might seem that racial identity should be eliminated in\nthe name of eliminating racism. And given that no definitive\nbiological or genetic basis for dividing the human population into\ndiscreet racial groups exists, it might seem easy to eliminate racial\nidentity since it is not real in the ways that it popularly is thought\nto be. But racial identities have a lived reality to them that is not\ndependent on scientific categorizations. Their lived reality not only\nmakes it difficult to eliminate racial identities; it also makes it\nproblematic to unequivocally call for their abolition since their\nelimination could mean the loss of an important source of meaning in\none\u2019s life.\n\nLinda Mart\u00edn Alcoff warns feminists and others of this\npotential loss, arguing that the reasons for eliminating class and\nstatus differences do not necessarily apply to racial and other social\nidentities. In Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self\n(2006), she examines race and gender as historical-material formations\nthat are fundamental, rather than peripheral to the self. Analyzing\nphilosophical and political critiques of identity politics, Alcoff\nexplains how identity claims have become suspect because they are seen\nas necessarily divisive, exclusionary, and alienating. Appeals to\nracial and/or gender identities by Latinas, for example, allegedly are\npolitically problematic because they intensify conflict between groups\nand thus are destructive to larger communities or nations (2006, 36).\nAnd they allegedly are philosophically problematic because they\nalienate a person from herself by means of an oppressive and\nartificially imposed category or set of categories (2006, 80). Genuine\nfreedom and authenticity thus would seem to require the abandonment of\nsocial identities.\n\nAccording to Alcoff, however, hidden behind these attacks on identity\nis a closet individualism that mistrusts any form of sociality or\ncommunity and fears any influence of the Other on the self. \u201cWhy\nassume that if I am culturally, ethnically, sexually identifiable that\nthis is a process akin to Kafka\u2019s nightmarish torture machines in the\npenal colony?\u201d asks Alcoff (2006, 81). The answer is that\n\u201cidentity in any form [is seen by its critics as] foisted on the\nself from the outside by the Other\u201d (2006, 81). For the\nindividual who insists on his or her absolute independence, social\nidentities represent a loss of control and power through ontological\ndependency upon someone other than oneself. This loss of power is to\nbe feared, and so too then are racial and other social identities to\nbe resisted.\n\nAlcoff\u2019s responds to this fear by situating it as a very particular,\nrather than universal need to deflect the Other, one felt by\ncolonizers and other dominant groups who do not want to see themselves\nreflected in their victims\u2019 eyes (2006, 81). Antagonism and resistance\nare not the only forms that relationships between self and other can\ntake. The interdependency of self and other can be recognized in such\na way that \u201cthe Other\u2019s view of me\u2014that is, my identity in\nthe Other\u2019s presence\u2014is internalized and thus is constitutive of\nmy self\u201d (2006, 82). Drawing on the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg\nGadamer and the pragmatism of George Herbert Mead, Alcoff develops a\nconcept of social identity that constitutively situates the individual\nin a communal world. Social identities are not forced onto atomistic\nindividuals who then necessarily become alien to themselves. Racial\nand other identities are, borrowing from Gadamer, \u201chermeneutic\nhorizons comprised of experiences, basic beliefs, and communal values,\nall of which influence our orientation toward and responses to future\nexperiences\u201d (2006, 287). Or in Mead\u2019s terms, the self is formed\nin and through the context of the \u201cgeneralized other,\u201d\nwhich is a communal perspective by and through which an individual\ndevelops self-consciousness and thereby learns to perceive both\nherself and others (2006, 117). The hermeneutic notion of horizon\nallows feminists and others to appreciate how race and gender are real\nin that they are lived positions in which individual meaning is\ncreated in relationship to history and experience. An individual\nalways operates within specific horizons, but because horizons open\nout to indeterminacy, a range of interpretative meaning is available\nfrom within those horizons (2006, 43). And Mead\u2019s account of the\nsocial self enhances the notion of horizon by emphasizing its social\ndimensions (2006, 121). The horizon in and through which individual\nmeaning is created is always a world of shared meaning that helps\nconstitute an individual\u2019s self-consciousness and experience.\n\nFor Alcoff, raced, gendered, and other social identities can be\noppressive, but they are not inherently or necessarily so. The\nultimate question, in her view, \u201cis not how to overcome\nidentity, but how to transform our current interpretations and\nunderstandings of [it]\u201d (Alcoff 2006, 287). Shannon Sullivan\nasks a similar question about whiteness in Revealing Whiteness:\nThe Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege (2006). According to\nSullivan, white privilege increasingly operates in the form of\nunconscious habit, able to thrive in a world that generally frowns on\novert racism because that racism seems non-existent. With pragmatists\nW.E.B. Du Bois and John Dewey, Sullivan develops an account of\nwhiteness as a raced and racist habit that is constitutive of the self\nand formed through transaction with a raced and racist world. Habit as\nsuch is not a problem to be solved although some habits, such as white\nprivilege and domination, can be very harmful. For Sullivan, as a\nstyle or predisposition for engaging with/in the world, habit is\nsimultaneously malleable and durable, which means that habits can be\ntransformed but that such transformation tends to take a long\ntime.\n\nThis especially true in the case of habits of white privilege, given\ntheir increasingly unconscious operations. Developing a pragmatized\nnotion of the unconscious\u2014one that is sympathetic to de\nLauretis\u2019s work on Peirce and Freud\u2014Sullivan explains the\nunconscious as formed through transaction with its various social,\npolitical, material and other environments (2006, 47). Drawing on the\npsychoanalytic theory of Jean Laplanche, Sullivan also modifies the\npragmatist concept of habit to account for the ways that habits of\nwhiteness \u201coften are deviously obstructionist, actively blocking\nthe self\u2019s attempts to transform itself for the better\u201d (2006,\n44). Racist habits of whiteness can be changed, but only indirectly,\nthrough changes to the environments that help constitute those habits.\nAs Sullivan (2006, 10) argues, \u201crelocating out of geographical,\nliterary, political, and other environments that encourage the white\nsolipsism of living as if only white people existed or mattered can be\na powerful way of disrupting and transforming unconscious habits of\nwhite privilege.\u201d And yet even here a word of warning is in\norder, according to Sullivan. Habits of white privilege can and often\ncontinue to operate in the midst of the best intentions to undermine\nthem through control of one\u2019s environments. Since habits of white\nprivilege tend to be characterized by \u201contological\nexpansiveness,\u201d in which white people treat all spaces as\nrightfully inhabited by them, attempts to master one\u2019s environment in\nthe name of anti-racist struggle simultaneously can be a reinforcement\nof that privilege (2006, 144). Sullivan thus cautions that although\nstruggles to eliminate white privilege must continue, habits of racial\nprivilege will not quickly or easily be eliminated.\n",
