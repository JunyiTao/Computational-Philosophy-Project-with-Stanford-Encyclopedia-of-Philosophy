    "main_text": "The Private Language Argument Expounded || Are the Orthodox Objections Met?\n3.5 Are the Orthodox Objections Met?\n\nDoes the ruling out of memory-scepticism as irrelevant to the private\nlanguage argument mean that two associated Orthodox objections to it\nare likewise irrelevant? The first of these is that the argument,\nself-defeatingly, rules out a public language as well. The second\nrelies on the \u2018community view\u2019 interpretation: it is that\nthe argument, equally self-defeatingly, rules out as impossible\nsomething perfectly conceivable: namely, the case of a so-called\n\u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019, a human being who, unlike Defoe\u2019s\noriginal Crusoe, is isolated from birth but devises a language for his\nown purposes without his having first been taught another language by\nsomeone else. Wittgenstein\u2019s Orthodox defenders, faced with this\nsecond objection, looked to be on shaky ground, often being forced\ninto the position of conceding that the argument did indeed exclude\nthe case, but claiming (not very plausibly) that such a Crusoe is\nafter all impossible so that the concession was not damaging.\n\nThe question as it concerns the first objection has already been\nanswered. The supposed threat to public language arose entirely from\nthe claim that memory-scepticism could not be confined to the private\ncase. But since scepticism concerning memory is no part of the\nargument, there is no reason to suppose that any question of such\nconfinement arises, and thus there is no question of the argument\u2019s\nbeing self-defeating by excluding the possibility of something we know\nto be actual, i.e., the language we already have. Now showing the\nabsence of any appeal to memory-scepticism involved transferring the\nburden of the argument from the question of whether or not an\nostensive definition could be remembered or not to the question of\nwhether there could be an ostensive definition in the first place.\n\nThis enables us to answer the question as it concerns the second\nobjection. It is clear that an argument which has as its focus the\nquestion of ostensive definition is not committed to ruling out in\nadvance all hypothetical cases of \u2018Robinson Crusoes\u2019. For\nthere is no a priori barrier to imagining a form of life\ncomplex enough for us to be assured that a determinate ostensive\ndefinition had been accomplished by such a being. Such a Crusoe,\nunlike a private linguist, lives in a world independent of his\nimpressions of it, and thus there could be definite occurrences in it\nwhich he could remember or forget; and some of those occurrences could\nbe correlations of signs with objects. It is easy to describe such\nhypothetical cases (a clear example appears in pages 486\u20138 of\nCanfield [1996]), and difficult to give a plausible denial that in\nsome sense they are possible. There are, however, further\ncomplications here, described briefly in section 4 below.\n",
