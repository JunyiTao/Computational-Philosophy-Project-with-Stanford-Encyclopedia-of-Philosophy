    "main_text": "\u201cHumans\u201d, Slogans and the Traditional Package || On the Status of the Traditional Slogan\n1.4 On the Status of the Traditional Slogan\n\nThe traditional package specifies a set of conditions some or all of\nwhich substantial claims about \u201chuman nature\u201d are supposed\nto meet. Before we turn to the systematic arguments central to\ncontemporary debates on whether such conditions can be met, it will be\nhelpful to spend a moment considering one highly influential\nsubstantial claim. Aristotle\u2019s writings prominently contain two\nsuch claims that have been handed down in slogan form. The first is\nthat the human being (more accurately: \u201cman\u201d) is an animal\nthat is in some important sense social (\u201czoon politikon\u201d,\nHistory of Animals 487b; Politics 1253a;\nNicomachean Ethics 1169b). According to the second,\n\u201che\u201d is a rational animal (Politics 1253a, where\nAristotle doesn\u2019t actually use the traditionally ascribed\nslogan, \u201czoon logon echon\u201d).\n\nAristotle makes both claims in very different theoretical contexts, on\nthe one hand, in his zoological writings and, on the other, in his\nethical and political works. This fact, together with the fact that\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature and his practical philosophy\nare united by a teleological metaphysics, may make it appear obvious\nthat the slogans are biological claims that provide a foundation for\nnormative claims in ethics and politics. The slogans do indeed\nfunction as foundations in the Politics and the\nNicomachean Ethics respectively (on the latter, see\n section 5\n of this entry). It is, however, unclear whether they are to be\nunderstood as biological claims. Let us focus on the slogan that has\ntraditionally dominated discussions of human nature in Western\nphilosophy, that humans are \u201crational animals\u201d.\n\nFirst, if Pellegrin and Balme are right that Aristotelian zoology is\nuninterested in classifying species, then ascribing the capacity for\n\u201crationality\u201d cannot have the function of naming a\nbiological trait that distinguishes humans from other animals. This is\nsupported by two further sets of considerations. To begin with,\nAristotle\u2019s explicit assertion that a series of\ndifferentiae would be needed to \u201cdefine\u201d humans\n(Parts of Animals 644a) is cashed out in the long list of\nfeatures he takes to be their distinguishing marks, such as speech,\nhaving hair on both eyelids, blinking, having hands, upright posture,\nbreasts in front, the largest and moistest brain, fleshy legs and\nbuttocks (Lloyd 1983: 29ff.). Furthermore, there is in Aristotle no\ncapacity for reason that is both exclusive to, and universal among\nanthropoi. One part or kind of reason, \u201cpractical\nintelligence\u201d (phronesis), is, Aristotle claims, found\nin both humans and other animals, being merely superior in the former\n(Parts of Animals, 687a). Now, there are other forms of\nreasoning of which this is not true, forms whose presence are\nsufficient for being human: humans are the only animals capable of\ndeliberation (History of Animals 488b) and reasoning (to\nnoein), in as far as this extends to mathematics and first\nphilosophy. Nevertheless, these forms of reasoning are unnecessary:\nslaves, who Aristotle includes among humans (Politics 1255a),\nare said to have no deliberative faculty (to bouleutikon) at\nall (Politics 1260a; cf. Richter 2011: 42ff.). Presumably,\nthey will also be without the capacities necessary for first\nphilosophy.\n\nSecond, these Aristotelian claims raise the question as to whether the\nascription of rationality is even intended as an ascription to an\nindividual in as far as she or he belongs to a biological kind. The\nanswer might appear to be obviously affirmative. Aristotle uses the\nclaim that a higher level of reason is characteristic of humans to\nteleologically explain other morphological features, in particular\nupright gait and the morphology of the hands (Parts of\nAnimals 686a, 687a). However, the kind of reason at issue here is\npractical intelligence, the kind humans and animals share, not the\ncapacity for mathematics and metaphysics, which among animals is\nexercised exclusively by humans. In as far as humans are able to\nexercise this latter capacity in contemplation, Aristotle claims that\nthey \u201cpartake of the divine\u201d (Parts of Animals\n656a), a claim of which he makes extensive use when grounding his\nethics in human rationality (Nicomachean Ethics\n1177b\u20131178b). When, in a passage to which James Lennox has drawn\nattention (Lennox 1999), Aristotle declares that the rational part of\nthe soul cannot be the object of natural science (Parts of\nAnimals 645a), it seems to be the contemplative part of the soul\nthat is thus excluded from biological investigation, precisely the\nfeature that is named in the influential slogan. If it is the\n\u201csomething divine \u2026 present in\u201d humans that is\ndecisively distinctive of their kind, it seems unclear whether the\nrelevant kind is biological.\n\nIt is not the aim of this entry to decide questions of Aristotle\ninterpretation. What is important is that the relationship of the\nquestion of \u201chuman nature\u201d to biology is, from the\nbeginning of the concept\u2019s career, not as unequivocal as is\noften assumed (e.g., Hull 1986: 7; Richards 2010: 217f.). This is\nparticularly true of the slogan according to which humans are rational\nanimals. In the history of philosophy, this slogan has frequently been\ndetached from any attempt to provide criteria for biological\nclassification or characterisation. When Aquinas picks up the slogan,\nhe is concerned to emphasise that human nature involves a material,\ncorporeal aspect. This aspect is, however, not thought of in\nbiological terms. Humans are decisively \u201crational\nsubstances\u201d, i.e., persons. As such they also belong to a kind\nwhose members also number angels and God (three times) (Eberl 2004).\nSimilarly, Kant is primarily, indeed almost exclusively, interested in\nhuman beings as examples of \u201crational nature\u201d,\n\u201chuman nature\u201d being only one way in which rational nature\ncan be instantiated (Kant 1785, 64, 76, 85). For this reason, Kant\ngenerally talks of \u201crational beings\u201d, rather than of\n\u201crational animals\u201d (1785, 45, 95).\n\nThere is, then, a perspective on humans that is plausibly present in\nAristotle, stronger in Aquinas and dominant in Kant and that involves\nseeing them as instances of a kind other than the \u201chuman\nkind\u201d, i.e., seeing the human animal \u201cas a rational\nbeing\u201d (Kant 1785 [1996: 45]). According to this view, the\n\u201cnature\u201d of humans that is most worthy of philosophical\ninterest is the one they possess not insofar as they are human, but\ninsofar as they are rational. Where this is the relevant use of the\nconcept of human nature, being a specimen of the biological species is\nunnecessary for possessing the corresponding property. Specimens of\nother species, as well as non-biological entities may also belong to\nthe relevant kind. It is also insufficient, as not all humans will\nhave the properties necessary for membership in that kind.\n\nAs both a biologist and ethicist, Aristotle is at once a detached\nscientist and a participant in forms of interpersonal and political\ninteraction only available to contemporary humans living in large,\nsedentary subpopulations. It seems plausible that a participant\nperspective may have suggested a different take on what it is to be\nhuman, perhaps even a different take on the sense in which humans\nmight be rational animals, to that of biological science. We will\nreturn to this difference in\n section 5\n of the entry.\n",
