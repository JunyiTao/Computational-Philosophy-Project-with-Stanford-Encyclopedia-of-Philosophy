    "main_text": "Models\n4. Models\n\nCL has various kinds of models, three of which are exemplified in some detail\nin this section. Algebraic models (often called \u201cterm\nmodels\u201d) may be constructed without difficulty for both the inequational\nand the equational systems of CL that were introduced in section 2.1. The set\nof terms forms an algebra, and given a suitable equivalence relation (that is\nalso a congruence), the application operation can be lifted to the equivalence\nclasses of terms in the standard way. The quasi-inequational characterization\nof the so obtained algebra provides the basis for an algebraic semantics for\nthese logics. Isolating the Lindenbaum algebra and verifying that it is not a\ntrivial algebra constitutes a consistency proof for \\(\\text{CL}_\\triangleright\\) and\n\\(\\text{CL}_=\\).\n",
