    "main_text": "Priority among motions\n5. Movers and unmoved movers\n\nThe definition of motion as the actuality of a potentiality of the\nentity undergoing motion in so far as it is potential requires that in\neach case the passive potentiality for the change is present in the\nchanging object. The presence of the potentiality can, nevertheless,\nbe in accordance with the nature of the object\u2014in which case the\nchange is natural (phusei) or according to\nnature (kata phusin), or can happen in the face of a\ncontrary disposition on the part of the nature of the entity\u2014in\nwhich case the change is forced (bi\u00e2i) or\ncontrary to nature (para phusin). A major\npresupposition on Aristotle\u2019s part is that this division is\nexhaustive: there are no changes to which the nature of the entity\nwould be indifferent or\n neutral.[39]\n The major consideration behind such a presupposition is that natures\nregulate the behaviour of the entities to which they belong in a\ncomprehensive manner, and not merely partially. Any influence the\nentity is exposed to interacts with its nature in a substantive\nmanner. The entity does not possess potentialities for change which\nwould not be directly related to the tendencies emerging from its\nnature.\n\nNote, however, that even if we endorsed the exhaustiveness of the\ndichotomy of natural and forced motions, and accepted the thesis that\nsimple bodies possess a unique natural motion (De caelo 1.2,\n269a8\u20139), we would not need thereby to accept Aristotle\u2019s\nfurther major claim, that natural and forced motions come in pairs of\nopposites, with the result that if a motion is contrary to the nature\nof an entity, the opposite motion will be its natural motion (De\ncaelo 1.2, 269a9\u201318). Where there is room for some more\ncomplex relationships among the targets of changes than a simple\nopposition along an axis of a single dimension\u2014and this is\neminently so between locomotions along rectilinear and circular paths,\nrespectively\u2014there can be several forced translations in\ncontrast to the single natural motion of the elements endowed with\nrectilinear natural motion, as Aristotle also admits in some passages\nof the De caelo (see 1.2, 269a30\u2013b2 and\n269b10\u201312).\n\nAlthough this allows for several different motions that are contrary\nto the nature of the same entity, the natural motion will still have a\nsingle opposite motion, the one which is directed to the opposite\nlocation. Consequently, natural circular motion will have no motion\nthat is opposite to it (De caelo 1.4,\n 270b32\u2013271a5).[40]\n\nAristotle\u2019s classification of motions into those contrary to\nnature and those according to nature applies not only to the motions\nof the moved objects, but transfers also to the movers effecting\nmotions. A mover can effect a motion which is contrary to its own\nnature. Aristotle\u2019s example of such an unnatural mover is the\nlever, an object heavy by nature, with which loads can be lifted\n(Physics 8.4, 255a20\u201323). Although such movers can\neffect motions in the contrary direction to the motion at the head of\nthe causal chain (levers are operated by the downward push of\nsomething heavy at the other end), the crucial consideration for\nAristotle in this case is that the original, initiating cause of the\ncausal chain should effect the motion according to its nature. Taken\ntogether, these considerations imply that we have a complete account\nof the physical domain once we have a thorough description of what is\nnatural to the entities in that domain, together with a specification\nof all the circumstances in which they\n operate.[41]\n\nBk. 8 of the Physics argues for the additional thesis that\nfor each motion, whether natural or contrary to nature, there needs to\nexist a\n mover.[42]\n In cases of forced motion, movers are present in a conspicuous way.\nThis need not be so, however, in cases of natural motion. Apart from\nthe cases where the nature of the entity is at the same time a moving\nand efficient cause\u2014i.e., apart from living beings, whose\nnature, the soul, is both formal and efficient cause\u2014the mover\nmay be inconspicuous. This is eminently so in the remaining large\nclass of natural motions, the natural motions of the elements. The\nnature of these elements, their inner principle of motion and rest is\nnot the moving cause of the motions of the elements, Aristotle claims.\nIf it were, then it would be up to the elementary masses to determine\nwhen they should perform their motions, but plainly this is not so.\nMoreover, the principle of causational synonymy rules out that any\nhomogenous mass, without an internal demarcation into separate\ncomponents, one moving and the other being moved, could move itself\n(Physics 8.4, 255a5\u201318). This is so because, on the\nassumption that one part of a homogeneous body could move another\npart, the active component of change would be, in every aspect,\nindistinguishable from the part in which change is effected, and this\nin turn would mean that change would occur even though there would be\nno transmission of a causally relevant property from the active part\nto the passive. This implies that even though we may answer the\nquestion as to why the elements move to their natural places\u2014the\nlight bodies up and the heavy ones down\u2014by an appeal to their\nrespective natures as causes (\u201cthat it is simply their nature to\nmove\n somewhere,[43]\n and this is what it is to be light and to be heavy,\u201d\nPhysics 8.4, 255b13\u201317), we do not thereby specify\ntheir moving causes. Their thrust being in a single direction, the\nelements cannot circumvent even rather simple obstacles they may\nencounter on their way (a sealed container can retain air under water,\nthe roof stays put pressing down on the walls of a building etc.).\nHence, whoever removes an obstacle to an element\u2019s motion is\ncausally responsible for the ensuing elemental motions. But even such\na causally responsible agent will not qualify as the moving\ncause, without yet further qualifications. For the identification of\nthe moving cause of these locomotions Aristotle invokes his\ndistinction of two potentialities. Some heavy material can be\npotentially light, as it can be transformed into a light material in a\nprocess of generation, whereas the emerging light material is still\npotential in a sense until it has acquired its full-fledged status,\nwhich involves its having arrived at that region of the cosmos which\nis its natural place. This analysis, then, describes the natural\nlocomotion of the elements as a possibly postponed, completing stage\nwithin a single overarching process, and hence in these cases\nAristotle can identify the cause of the second stage of the process\nwith the efficient cause of the first stage, the entity which\ngenerated the element in the first place (Physics 8.4,\n256a1).\n\nOnce it is established that there is a mover for each change, the\nfinite causal\n chains[44]\n can be followed up to the primary instance of motion, which are\neternal circular motions. (In particular the Sun\u2019s course along\nthe ecliptic is responsible for many sublunar changes, the cycle of\nthe seasons being foremost among them.) Whether these circular motions\nrequire external movers, and ultimately, whether the universe is\ncausally closed or needs some external causal influence for its\npreservation, depends on the status of these revolutions.\n\nIn this regard the very first thing to establish is that they cannot\nbe constrained\n motions.[45]\n But natural motions are also in need of movers, as Physics\n8.4 argues. This does not apply only to the natural motions of living\nbeings, which are performed under the causal influence of their soul.\nThe natural motions of the four sublunary elements are also caused by\nspecific external causes responsible for these motions, and on the\nbasis of these considerations Aristotle feels entitled to assert that\nevery motion whatsoever\u2014including also, then, the eternal\ncircular motions\u2014require a mover.\n\nBut the entities performing these eternal circular motions cannot\npossibly be moved by moving causes of the same kind as the movers of\nsublunary elemental motions. These entities are eternal and\nungenerated bodies. Consequently, there is no entity that could\nproduce them. Nothing can be responsible for the circular motion on\naccount of generating these eternal and ungenerated bodies. Moreover,\nas they do not encounter any hindrance during their revolutions, there\nis no room for an accidental mover which would remove any obstacle in\ntheir way.\n\nAlthough Aristotle\u2019s physical treatises do not discuss in what\nparticular way their movers are causally responsible for these eternal\ncircular motions, the general framework set out apparently applies to\nthem as well. In accordance with this, motion is an incomplete\nactuality of the potentiality of what is movable (Physics\n8.5, 257b6ff). This incomplete actuality is always dependent on the\ncausal efficacy of the corresponding actuality of a mover. The example\npresented here is the process of heating a potentially hot item,\ncaused to be hot by an actually hot thing. The division of roles\nguarantees that the same item cannot possibly be the mover and the\nmoved entity at the same time. Consequently, these eternal circular\nmotions are envisaged as having a cause responsible for their motion,\nthe causal influence of which produces (and upholds) this motion\ncontinuously in them. Aristotle does not specify in any detail what\nexactly the actuality of the mover is; nor does he indicate what\nrelationship there is between this actuality and the actuality that is\nbeing continuously communicated by the mover to the entities in\neternal circular motion.\n\nA further requirement is that the mover of these eternal circular\nmotions has to be\n unmoved.[46]\n But then the actuality of this mover should not be restricted to a\ncausally efficacious single property. Rather, the mover should be\nactual all way through. Any potentiality it might have would carry\nwith it the jeopardy that it might undergo possible changes of its\n own.[47]\n This is ruled out to the extent that such a first cause cannot house\nmotion even\n accidentally.[48]\n In other words, the mover cannot be related to the moving object in\nthe way the soul of an animal is related to the moving animal; in the\ncase of an animal wherever the living being, the animal, moves, its\nsoul will follow suit and will also move,\u2014accidentally\u2014to\nthe same\n place.[49]\n\nMoreover, the entity causally responsible for the eternal circular\nmotions in the world has to possess an infinite\n power,[50]\n which it communicates to the bodies it moves. As a result, this\nentity cannot be divisible and cannot have extension. Moreover, it\nmust be located where the motion is quickest, at the periphery of the\nphysical realm (Physics 8.10).\n\nAll this testifies to the exceptional status of the first movement,\nand behind it, of the first mover in the universe. The mover of these\nspheres possesses nothing but actuality, but this actuality is not\nwhat is transmitted in the process of causation. As we have seen in\n Section 3\n above, this would not be exceptional as such: locomotion need not be\ncaused on the transmission model of causation. But locomotions,\nalthough caused without the transmission of an actuality of being\nlocated in any particular location, were understood to be embedded in\nlarger patterns of causation which observe the principle of\ncausational synonymy. It is precisely any such larger pattern of\ncausation which is missing in the case of celestial\n motions.[51]\n Note furthermore that what we hear in Metaphysics 12.6, that\nthe first mover moves as an object of love and\n striving,[52]\n comes perilously close to abandoning the claims of Physics\nbk. 8 to the effect that there is an unmoved mover serving as the\nefficient cause of the motions of the cosmos. Such doubts, however,\nshould be dismissed. In these two contexts Aristotle gives distinct\ndescriptions of some principle that is beyond the realm of physics.\nFirst, still connecting it to the framework of the Physics,\nhe is characterizing a supra-physical entity without which the\nuniverse could not function or persist, and then, second, in the\nMetaphysics, he is offering an account of the causal efficacy\nof the supra-physical substance in terms of what this entity itself\nis. Small wonder that these two accounts situate the mode of operation\nof this entity in two different frames of physical\ncausation.\nGlossary of Aristotelian terms\n\naction: poiein\nactivity: praxis\nactuality: energeia or entelecheia\nart, craft: techn\u00ea\ncapacity: dunamis\ncause: aitia or aition\nchange: kin\u00easis or metabol\u00ea\n\nto effect change or motion: kinein\n\nto undergo change or motion: kineisthai\n\nqualitative change: alloi\u00f4sis\n\nquantitative changes\u2014growth: aux\u00easis; decay:\nphthisis\n\nlocomotion: phora\nto come to be: gignesthai\ncoming to be: genesis\nforce: bia\n\nforced: bi\u00e2i\nform: eidos or morph\u00ea\nin so far as: h\u00eai\ngenus, kind: genos\ngoal: telos\nkind, species: eidos\nknown, knowable: gn\u00f4rimon\n\nmore known, more knowable: gn\u00f4rim\u00f4teron\nmatter: hul\u00ea\nmagnitude: megethos\nmotion: kin\u00easis\nnature: phusis\n\nnatural: phusikos, phusei\n\naccording to nature: kata phusin\n\ncontrary to nature: para phusin\npassion: paschein\nto perish: phtheirein\nperishing: phthora\nplace: pou (as one of the categories, literally: where)\nor topos\npotentiality: dunamis\npower: dunamis\nquality: poion\nquantity: poson\nsubstance: ousia\ntime: pote (as one of the categories, literally: when) or\nchronos\n\n",
