    "main_text": "\n\nEnvironmental ethics is the discipline in philosophy that studies the\nmoral relationship of human beings to, and also the value and moral\nstatus of, the environment and its non-human contents. This entry\ncovers: (1) the challenge of environmental ethics to the\nanthropocentrism (i.e., human-centeredness) embedded in traditional\nwestern ethical thinking; (2) the development of the discipline from\nthe 1960s and 1970s; (3) the connection of deep ecology, feminist\nenvironmental ethics, animism and social ecology to politics; (4) the\nattempt to apply traditional ethical theories, including\nconsequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, to support\ncontemporary environmental concerns; (5) the broader concerns of some\nthinkers with wilderness, the built environment and the politics of\npoverty; and (6) the ethics of sustainability and climate change.\n",
