He\npresented his economic ideas in commentaries on the Ethics,\nPolitics, and Economics, as well as an earlier\ntreatise, De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum,\nthe first comprehensive work upon money. In his De origine,\nnatura, jure et mutationibus monetarum, of which he himself made\na French translation under the title Traicti\u00e9 de la\npremiere invention des monnoies, Oresme argued that coinage\nbelongs to the public, not to the prince, who has no right to vary\narbitrarily the content or weight (Woodhouse 2017). By clearly\ndelineating the destructive effects on a nation\u2019s economy of a\ndebasement of the currency, he influenced Charles V\u2019s monetary\nand tax policies.\n\nOresme also stated that in a society in which two currencies with the\nsame designation but of different value circulate, the money of lower\nvalue drives out the money of higher value. This economic law was also\ndiscovered independently of Oresme by Nicolaus Copernicus\n(1473\u20131543), the famous astronomer, who wrote about a reform of\nthe Prussian coinage, and by Thomas Gresham (1519\u20131597). Today\nit is called Gresham\u2019s Law, or sometimes the Law of Oresme,\nCopernicus, and Gresham, but its oldest version can be found in\nAristophanes\u2019s poem \u2018The Frogs\u2019 (Balch 1908;\nSparavigna 2014).\n\nOresme\u2019s interest and engagement in economic problems should not\nbe seen as an isolated subject in his intellectual life. As Kaye\n(1998, 2) has argued, the preoccupation with measurement, gradation,\nand the quantification of qualities, so typical of Oresme and the\nnatural philosophy of his period, was strongly influenced by the\ncontemporary rapid monetization of European society.\n",
