    "main_text": "Zionism\n8. Contemporary Jewish Life and the Future of Jewish Civilization\n\n\nThroughout his career Scholem played the important role of public\nintellectual in Mandate Palestine/Israel. He often wrote in Israeli\nnewspapers, magazines, was frequently interviewed in print and radio,\nand weighed in on a variety of political, cultural, and social issues.\nMany of these essays were collected in the two-volume Devarim\nbe-Go published in 1976 and a third volume entitled \u2018Od\nDavar published in 1989. A selection of these and other essays\nwere published in English in Jews and Judaism in Crisis, 1976\nand more recently in On the Possibility of Jewish Mysticism\nToday, 1997. In these volumes Scholem reflects on everything from\nthe state of the university, general Israeli education, Israeli\npolitics, the state of the Diaspora, and personal reflections of his\nown on studying Jewish mysticism. These include book reviews, short\ncomments about his contemporaries, and letters he wrote to various\ncolleagues and friends. One of his most well-known, and revealing,\nletters about his own investment in the study of Kabbala was a 1925\nletter to the Israeli poet Hayyim Nahman Bialik that was published in\nHebrew in Devarim be-Go and now appears in German translation.\nScholem knew the importance of his stature as the founder of the modern\nstudy of Kabbala and he responded by engaging with issues of his day\nfrom that perch. He was often self-deprecating about his\n\u201cpopular\u201d essays but he took them very seriously and they\noccupied a fair amount of his psyche and energy.\n\n\nHe also wrote hundreds of letters to scholars and dignitaries around\nthe world that have recently been published in Gershom Scholem: A\nLife in Letters: 1914\u20131982. The correspondence between him and\nWalter Benjamin was published separately as The Correspondence of\nGershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin: 1932\u20131940. A volume of his\npoetry was published as In the Fullness of Time: Poems, 2003.\nA new volume of his early diaries has just been published as\nLamentations of Youth: the Diaries of Gershom Scholem,\n1913\u20131919, 2008.\n\n\nComing in Israel in the 1920's when Zionism was still a\nrevolutionary cultural project Scholem knew he was in the midst of a\nsecular revolution whose origins, according to him, extended back to\nthe distant esoteric past. His role was not simply to unearth but also\nto interpret, not only publish but to educate a generation. He was\narguably the most important Jewish Studies scholar in the twentieth\ncentury and surely one of its most important and influential\nvoices.\n\n\nThe hundreds of texts and personalities he brought to light from\nlate antiquity to modernity and the forcefulness and complexity of his\ngrand theses about Kabbala and Jewish history has fed more than three\ngenerations of scholars and will surely nurture many more. More\nrecently, he is being discovered in European circles as an important\nfigure in Weimar Jewish culture. Serious studies in German are\npresently being published by young scholars who know little about\nKabbala and do not have much interest in Zionism but view Scholem as an\nimportant intellectual and philosophical mind compared with such\nfigures as Benjamin, Strauss, Adorno, Horkheimer, and Arendt. His\nintellectual reach was, in fact, extraordinary, and thus this new\ninterest should be celebrated.\n",
