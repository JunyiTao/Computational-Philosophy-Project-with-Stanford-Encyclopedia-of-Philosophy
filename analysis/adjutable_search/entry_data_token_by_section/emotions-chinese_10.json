    "main_text": "Interpretations of Qing || Semantic Transition and Transformation of Qing\n3.4 Semantic Transition and Transformation of Qing\n\nFollowing this semantic divide and transition from the onto-objective\nto psycho-subjective meanings of qing, one can understand the\npolysemy of qing and its semantic change in early Chinese\nphilosophy. First, qing had or acquired many different\nmeanings over several centuries in ancient Chinese philosophy. Second,\nthere are two major semantic dimensions (onto-objective and\npsycho-subjective dimensions) of qing. Third, the meanings of\nqing had been expanded from the first dimension to the second\ndimension. Fourth, regarding the period of the semantic transition or\nexpansion of qing, different views are proposed: the semantic\ntransition had occurred during the Warring States period (specifically\naround the time of Mencius and Xunzi, i.e., 300 BCE) (Bruya 2003),\nafter the introduction of Buddhism to China (the Han Dynasty around\n250 CE) (Hansen 1995) or during the Song dynasty (around 960 CE)\n(Graham 1990). Regardless of the exact timeline of the semantic\ntransition, Chinese philosophy is greatly influenced by its\nphilosophical reflection on the nature of qing through its\nbroad semantic spectrum of objective nature and subjective feelings.\nCai (2020: 424\u2013425) summarizes the polysemy and the semantic\ntransition of qing in the following way. \n\n\nThe Chinese thinking about qing basically follows an\nobjective-to-subjective trajectory. It begins with philosophical\ninvestigations into the nature of the myriad things or wanwu\n\u842c\u7269 (ten thousand things) during the late Spring and Autumn period\nand the early Warring States period (roughly the late sixth and fifth\ncentury BCE). This is followed by a shift of attention from the\nobjective nature of the things to the subjective nature of\nhumans\u2014their emotion and moral nature\u2014during the middle\nand late Warring States period (roughly fourth and third centuries\nBCE). From the Han onward, the locus of qing discussions\nshifts from philosophy to music and literature, with emotion being\nqing\u2019s core referent.\n\n",
