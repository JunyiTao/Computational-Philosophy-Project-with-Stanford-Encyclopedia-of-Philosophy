    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || Hume\n3.3 Hume\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u20131776) explicitly professes a preference for\nancient ethics (Hume, Enquiries, 318), claiming that morals\nare the one science in which the ancients are not surpassed by the\nmoderns (Hume, Enquiries, 330). Like some of the Greek\nmoralists, Hume thought morality must be rooted in our passional\nnature. For morality moves us to action whereas reason alone, Hume\nthought, does not. His preference for ancient ethics is most obviously\nseen in his focus on the nature of the virtues and in his efforts to\nexplain how virtues arise from our feelings and desires.\n\nHume divides the virtues into two types: artificial and natural.\nArtificial virtues include justice, promise-keeping, and allegiance to\nlegitimate government. Natural virtues include courage, magnanimity,\nambition, friendship, generosity, fidelity, and gratitude, among many\nothers. Whereas each exercise of the natural virtues normally produces\ngood results, the good of artificial virtues is indirect in that it\ncomes about only as a result of there being an accepted practice of\nexercising these virtues.\n\nHume\u2019s discussion of justice illustrates how the artificial\nvirtues emerge from our feelings and desires. Hume notes that\nfollowing the rules of justice does not always produce good results.\nConsider the judges who \u201cbestow on the dissolute the labour of\nthe industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means of\nharming both themselves and others\u201d (Hume, Treatise,\n579). Hume thinks that as persons become aware that stability of\npossessions is advantageous to each individually, they also realize\nthat stability is not possible unless everyone refrains from\ndisturbing others\u2019 possessions. As this awareness becomes more\nwidespread and effective in people\u2019s behaviors, there arises a\nconvention to respect the possessions of others. This redirection of\nself-interest, aided by our natural tendency to sympathize with the\nfeelings of others who benefit from stability of possession, gives\nrise to our approval of justice. In this way, Hume argues, the virtue\nof obeying laws arises naturally from our feelings and desires.\n\nHume\u2019s indebtedness to Greek ethics can be seen even more\nclearly in his discussion of the natural virtues. Of these, one\nimportant group (consisting of courage, magnanimity, ambition, and\nothers) is based on, or may even be a form of, self-esteem:\n\u201c[W]hatever we call heroic virtue, and admire under the\ncharacter of greatness and elevation of mind, is either nothing but a\nsteady and well-established pride and self-esteem, or partakes largely\nof that passion. Courage \u2026 and all the other shining virtues of\nthat kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and\nderive a great part of their merit from that origin\u201d (Hume,\nTreatise, 599\u2013600). Yet these virtues based on\nself-esteem must be tempered by a second group that includes\ngenerosity, compassion, fidelity, and friendship; otherwise traits\nlike courage are \u201cfit only to make a tyrant and public\nrobber\u201d (Hume, Treatise, 603). This second group of\nvirtues is based on broadly-based feelings of good will, affection,\nand concern for others.\n\nHume acknowledges that his second group of natural virtues owes a debt\nto the Stoic view that a virtuous person ought to be concerned with\nthe welfare of all human beings, whether they be intimate or stranger;\nand in describing the first group of natural virtues, Hume looks to\nSocrates as someone who has achieved a kind of inner calm and\nself-esteem. In addition, his general approach to the natural virtues,\nthat some are based on self-esteem and others on friendly feelings and\ngood will, is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s exploration of the\npsychological foundations of virtue.\n\nHume believes that we develop self-esteem from what we do well, if\nwhat we do well expresses something distinctive and durable about us,\nand he seems to recognize that realized deliberative abilities are\namong the most durable features of ourselves. As we gain a facility at\ndeliberation, we come to develop self-esteem and enjoy who we are,\nlike Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person who enjoys most the exercise of\nhis developed deliberative powers. Moreover, Hume\u2019s recognition\nthat self-esteem must be tempered by benevolence is reflected in\nAristotle\u2019s argument that the development and preservation of\nproper self-love requires friendships in which persons come to care\nfor others for others\u2019 own sakes.\n\nIn addition to exploring these psychological foundations of virtue,\nHume seems to accord them a role that is reminiscent of the\nAristotelian view that virtue is a state in which reason and passion\nspeak with the same voice. Instead of making virtue and good character\nsubordinate to the requirements of reason, as we saw in the natural\nlaw theorists and in Kant, Hume appears to give virtue and good\ncharacter room to guide and constrain the deliberations of agents so\nas to affect what they determine to be best to do. By doing so, Hume\ngoes some way toward indicating how good character is different from\ncontinence.\n\nHume\u2019s account of how we determine what is right and wrong\nilluminates the role character plays. When Hume\u2019s\n\u201cjudicious spectator\u201d determines what is right and wrong,\nshe fixes on some \u201csteady and general\u201d point of view and\n\u201cloosens\u201d herself from her actual feelings and interests.\nIt appears that someone who has developed an enjoyment in the\nactivities of deliberating and reflecting, and whose self-esteem is\nbased on that enjoyment, will be more likely to take up the point of\nview of the judicious spectator and to perform the subtle corrections\nin response that may be necessary to loosen oneself from one\u2019s\nown perspective and specific passions. Someone whose self-esteem is\nbased on an enjoyment taken in deliberation will be attuned to wider\ncomplications and will have the wider imaginative powers needed for\ncorrect deliberation from a steady and general point of view.\nHume\u2019s view of the relation between passion and deliberation is\nreminiscent of the Aristotelian view that someone with proper\nself-love will also be practically wise, in that his self-love will\nenable him to size up practical situations correctly and determine\ncorrectly what it is best to do.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Hume\u2019s view of the virtues, see\nBaier (1991).
