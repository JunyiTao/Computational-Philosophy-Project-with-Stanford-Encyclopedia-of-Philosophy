    "main_text": "Definition of Omnipotence\n3. Definition of Omnipotence\n\n\nDamian\u2019s central interest in De divina omnipotentia is to\ndefend the doctrine of omnipotence against certain challenges. The\ndefense that Damian offers rests on a specific understanding of what\nconstitutes omnipotence.\n\n\nThe doctrine of omnipotence (omnipotentia) implies that God\n\u201cis capable of everything\u201d (omnia possit; e.g.,\n596C\u2013D, 610C\u2013D). In Damian\u2019s view, it does not follow from the doctrine\nthat we should think that God would be able to do anything whatsoever.\nAdmittedly, there are many things that God cannot do, e.g., God cannot\nlie (e.g., 597C). Lying is an evil thing. In Damian\u2019s view, an agent\nneed not be able to do evil in order to qualify as omnipotent because\nnot being able to do evil is no sign of impotence or inability.\nActually, God cannot do anything that is evil and he can do anything\nthat is good. By \u201comnipotence\u201d, Damian means this ability\nto do anything that is good. This ability can properly be characterized\nas \u201comnipotence\u201d because evil things are\n\u201cnothing\u201d (nihil). To be capable of\n\u201ceverything\u201d (omnia), an agent must be capable of\nanything that is \u201csomething\u201d (aliquid), but he\nneed not be capable of \u201cnothing\u201d (598D\u2013599A, 600A\u2013B,\n610C\u2013D).\n\n\nThe remarks about \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201csomething\u201d\nare related to Damian\u2019s conception of the major metaphysical division\namong things in the world. The things in the world can be divided into\nthe good (bona) and the bad or evil (mala), and these\nare quite different from each other (see 602A\u2013C, 608B\u2013610D, 618B\u2013C).\nWhat is characteristic of good things is that they are (esse)\nand that they are something (aliquid). The good things that\nare have been made by God and are willed by God. Evil things are not\nwilled by God, and they are far away from him. The being of evil is\napparent and not real. Evil things seem to be, but in the testimony of\nthe truth, they are not (non esse); they are not something but\nnothing (nihil). God is not the author of evil, for\n\u201cnothing was made without him\u201d (sine ipso factum est\nnihil, John 1:3).\n\n\nIn some passages, Damian assumes that divine omnipotence can be\ncharacterized as God\u2019s ability to bring about anything that he can\nwill. Because God can will anything that is good, and he cannot will\nanything that is evil, this amounts to the same as the characterization\nof omnipotence as God\u2019s ability to bring about anything that is good\n(cf. 596C\u2013597B, 599A, 600A\u2013B). However, the characterization of\nomnipotence as God's ability to bring about anything that he can will\nreveals an important aspect in Damian\u2019s view of divine power, viz.\ndivine freedom. Damian is very emphatic about God\u2019s freedom in his\ncreative activity. In his omnipotence, God can do anything that is\ngood, but he need not do everything that is good \u2014 he need not do\nanything at all (600B, 605C, 607A; for the Augustinian background, see\nKnuuttila 1993, 66\u201370).\n\n\nGiven Damian\u2019s understanding of omnipotence, it is, in principle,\neasy to determine whether God can do some given thing or not. One just\nhas to find out whether the thing in question is a good thing or a bad\nthing. If it is a good thing, then God can both will it and bring it\nabout. If it is evil, it is something that God cannot even will (cf.\n600B).\n",
