    "main_text": "The Philosophical Importance of Moral Reasoning || Defining \u201cMoral Reasoning\u201d\n1.1 Defining \u201cMoral Reasoning\u201d\n\nThis article takes up moral reasoning as a species of practical\nreasoning \u2013 that is, as a type of reasoning directed towards\ndeciding what to do and, when successful, issuing in an intention (see\nentry on\n practical reason).\n Of course, we also reason theoretically about what morality requires\nof us; but the nature of purely theoretical reasoning about ethics is\nadequately addressed in the various articles on\n ethics.\n It is also true that, on some understandings, moral reasoning\ndirected towards deciding what to do involves forming judgments about\nwhat one ought, morally, to do. On these understandings, asking what\none ought (morally) to do can be a practical question, a certain way\nof asking about what to do. (See\n section 1.5\n on the question of whether this is a distinctive practical question.)\nIn order to do justice to the full range of philosophical views about\nmoral reasoning, we will need to have a capacious understanding of\nwhat counts as a moral question. For instance, since a prominent\nposition about moral reasoning is that the relevant considerations are\nnot codifiable, we would beg a central question if we here defined\n \u201cmorality\u201d\n as involving codifiable principles or rules. For present purposes, we\nmay understand issues about what is right or wrong, or virtuous or\nvicious, as raising moral questions. \n\nEven when moral questions explicitly arise in daily life, just as when\nwe are faced with child-rearing, agricultural, and business questions,\nsometimes we act impulsively or instinctively rather than pausing to\nreason, not just about what to do, but about what we ought to do.\nJean-Paul Sartre described a case of one of his students who came to\nhim in occupied Paris during World War II, asking advice about whether\nto stay by his mother, who otherwise would have been left alone, or\nrather to go join the forces of the Free French, then massing in\nEngland (Sartre 1975). In the capacious sense just described, this is\nprobably a moral question; and the young man paused long enough to ask\nSartre\u2019s advice. Does that mean that this young man was\nreasoning about his practical question? Not necessarily. Indeed,\nSartre used the case to expound his skepticism about the possibility\nof addressing such a practical question by reasoning. But what is\nreasoning?\n\nReasoning, of the sort discussed here, is active or explicit thinking,\nin which the reasoner, responsibly guided by her assessments of her\nreasons (Kolodny 2005) and of any applicable requirements of\nrationality (Broome 2009, 2013), attempts to reach a well-supported\nanswer to a well-defined question (Hieronymi 2013). For Sartre\u2019s\nstudent, at least such a question had arisen. Indeed, the question was\nrelatively definite, implying that the student had already engaged in\nsome reflection about the various alternatives available to him\n\u2013 a process that has well been described as an important phase\nof practical reasoning, one that aptly precedes the effort to make up\none\u2019s mind (Harman 1986, 2).\n\nCharacterizing reasoning as responsibly conducted thinking of course\ndoes not suffice to analyze the notion. For one thing, it fails to\naddress the fraught question of reasoning\u2019s relation to\ninference (Harman 1986, Broome 2009). In addition, it does not settle\nwhether formulating an intention about what to do suffices to conclude\npractical reasoning or whether such intentions cannot be adequately\nworked out except by starting to act. Perhaps one cannot adequately\nreason about how to repair a stone wall or how to make an omelet with\nthe available ingredients without actually starting to repair or to\ncook (cf. Fernandez 2016). Still, it will do for present purposes. It\nsuffices to make clear that the idea of reasoning involves norms of\nthinking. These norms of aptness or correctness in practical thinking\nsurely do not require us to think along a single prescribed pathway,\nbut rather permit only certain pathways and not others (Broome 2013,\n219). Even so, we doubtless often fail to live up to them. \n",
