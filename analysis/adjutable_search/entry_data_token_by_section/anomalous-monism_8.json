    "main_text": "Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle || Objections to the Cause-Law Principle\n3.3 Objections to the Cause-Law Principle\n\nThe cause-law principle has come in for a lot of criticism since it\nreceived its canonical formulation in Hume\u2019s regularity theory\nof causation, and it is worth briefly reviewing some of the central\nobjections relevant to Davidson\u2019s own discussions. This will\nmake clear how important it is, for an argument such as\nDavidson\u2019s for Anomalous Monism, that some justification for the\nthesis ultimately be provided.\n\nAn initial objection is that Hume\u2019s analysis of singular causal\nstatements (\u2018a caused b\u2019 is true if and\nonly if \u2018whenever an A occurs, it is followed by an\noccurrence of a B\u2019), which articulates his own version\nof the cause-law principle, is not an accurate rendering of the way in\nwhich we typically use the term \u2018cause\u2019. We are confident\nin judgments such as \u2018Harry\u2019s smoking caused his lung\ncancer\u2019 while knowing that in fact not all smokers are stricken\nby lung cancer. This point is entirely general\u2014we make singular\ncausal judgments all the time without believing in (indeed, while\nknowing the falsity of) the associated universal generalization (see\nAnscombe 1971). However, Davidson\u2019s extensionalism about\ncausality provides a straightforward response to this concern. His\nview is that while we may not believe in the associated universal\ngeneralization, that is consistent with there being some\nuniversal generalization, stated in a different vocabulary than the\nsingular causal statement, which \u2018covers\u2019 that statement.\n(It is worth noting that Davidson rejects Hume\u2019s\nanalysis of singular causal statements in terms of universal\ngeneralizations\u2014he holds that the requirement of such a covering\ngeneralization is necessary but not sufficient for the truth of such a\nstatement (Davidson 1967).)\n\nWhile this response does appear to meet the objection, it raises the\nfollowing concern, which is behind a related objection to the\ncause-law principle: no one in fact seems to know any true predictive\n\u2018strict\u2019 laws (in the literal sense of that term). Now,\nwhile it is certainly consistent with this point that there are or\neven must be such laws, it becomes more pressing to know why we should\nthink this if we cannot even offer any examples. It is well and good\nfor Davidson to point to the possibility of strict covering laws that\ntranscend our current knowledge, but we need to know why we should\nbelieve in such things. Science seems to have done well for itself\nwithout any apparent use of them.\n\nAnother objection to the cause-law principle comes from the state of\ncontemporary physics. According to quantum mechanics, it is not simply\ndifficult or impossible for us to state such laws for quantum\nphenomena. Rather, quantum theory appears to entail that determinism\nfails to obtain at the level of microparticles. What the theory and\nthe behavior of such particles tells us is that causation, at least at\nthe level of micro phenomena, is indeterministic. And this\nindeterminism is claimed to be inconsistent with the requirement of\nstrict laws. This objection to the cause-law principle, then, is that\nphilosophy should never dictate to science on empirical matters.\nObservation of the world tells us that strict laws are impossible in\nthis domain even while causation is present, in direct contradiction\nof the cause-law principle.\n\nNow, we have already seen Davidson\u2019s own response to this sort\nof objection\n (3.1).\n As traditionally construed, strict laws are supposed to guarantee the\nconsequent condition on the basis of the antecedent condition. But\nthey do not need to provide such a guarantee. What strict laws require\nis that the antecedent include all conditions and events that could\npossibly prevent the occurrence of the consequent. If the consequent\ndoes not occur when all these conditions have been accounted for,\nthere is nothing else to be cited in explanation of the non-occurrence\nother than the sheer brute fact of an indeterministic universe. So\nindeterministic causation is entirely consistent with the cause-law\nprinciple (Davidson 1970, 219). The determinist/indeterminist and\nstrict/nonstrict law distinctions do not map neatly onto each other.\nAn indeterministic law can be universal, exceptionless and true. This\npoint does not appear to be recognized by central proponents of the\nindeterministic objection to strict laws (see Cartwright 1983).\n\nA final objection to the cause-law principle which is more internal to\nthe wider framework of Anomalous Monism has been put forth in McDowell\n1985. McDowell sees a tension between Davidson\u2019s allegiance to\nthe cause-law principle and his rejection of \u2018the dualism of\nscheme and content\u2019 (Davidson 1974a). Briefly, the dualism\nDavidson opposes is the idea that, for instance, a perceptual judgment\nis the rational upshot of an interaction between a concept and an\nnonconceptualized experiential element\u2014the sensory input. Given\nDavidson\u2019s systematic rejection of this idea, McDowell believes\nhe ought to disavow the cause-law principle. McDowell doesn\u2019t\nthink the principle is required for a minimal version of materialism\n(see the supplement on\n Related Views\n (Bare Materialism), and without the need to justify materialism\nMcDowell sees the principle as lacking any motivation in\nDavidson\u2019s framework. For discussion of this issue and others\nrelated to scheme-content dualism and Anomalous Monism, see the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism).\n",
