    "main_text": "What is Time Travel?\n1. What is Time Travel?\nThere is a number of rather different scenarios which would seem,\nintuitively, to count as \u2018time travel\u2019\u2014and a number\nof scenarios which, while sharing certain features with some of the\ntime travel cases, seem nevertheless not to count as genuine time\n travel:[1]\n\nTime travel\n\nDoctor. Doctor Who steps into a machine in\n2024. Observers outside the machine see it disappear. Inside the\nmachine, time seems to Doctor Who to pass for ten minutes. Observers\nin 1984 (or 3072) see the machine appear out of nowhere. Doctor Who\nsteps out.[2]\nLeap. The time traveller takes hold of a special device\n (or steps into a machine) and suddenly disappears; she appears at an\n earlier (or later) time. Unlike in Doctor, the time\n traveller experiences no lapse of time between her departure and\n arrival: from her point of view, she instantaneously appears at the\n destination \n time.[3]\nPutnam. Oscar Smith steps into a machine in 2024. From\n his point of view, things proceed much as in Doctor : time\n seems to Oscar Smith to pass for a while; then he steps out in\n 1984. For observers outside the machine, things proceed\n differently. Observers of Oscar\u2019s arrival in the past see a\n time machine suddenly appear out of nowhere and immediately divide\n into two copies of itself: Oscar Smith steps out of one; and (through\n the window) they see inside the other something that looks just like\n what they would see if a film of Oscar Smith were played backwards\n (his hair gets shorter; food comes out of his mouth and goes back\n into his lunch box in a pristine, uneaten state; etc.). Observers of\n Oscar\u2019s departure from the future do not simply see his time\n machine disappear after he gets into it: they see it collide with the\n apparently backwards-running machine just described, in such a way\n that both are simultaneously\n annihilated.[4]\nG\u00f6del.\n The time traveller steps into an ordinary rocket ship (not a special\ntime machine) and flies off on a certain course. At no point does she\ndisappear (as in Leap) or \u2018turn back in time\u2019\n(as in Putnam)\u2014yet thanks to the overall structure of\nspacetime (as conceived in the General Theory of Relativity), the\ntraveller arrives at a point in the past (or future) of her\ndeparture. (Compare the way in which someone can travel continuously\nwestwards, and arrive to the east of her departure point, thanks to\nthe overall curved structure of the surface of the\nearth.)[5] \nEinstein. The time traveller steps into an ordinary\n rocket ship and flies off at high speed on a round trip. When he\n returns to Earth, thanks to certain effects predicted by the Special\n Theory of Relativity, only a very small amount of time has elapsed\n for him\u2014he has aged only a few months\u2014while a great deal\n of time has passed on Earth: it is now hundreds of years in the\n future of his time of \n departure.[6] \n\nNot time travel\n\nSleep. One is very tired, and falls into a deep\n sleep. When one awakes twelve hours later, it seems from one\u2019s\n own point of view that hardly any time has passed. \nComa.\nOne is in a coma for a number of years and then awakes, at which point\nit seems from one\u2019s own point of view that hardly any time has\npassed. \nCryogenics. One is cryogenically frozen for hundreds of\nyears. Upon being woken, it seems from one\u2019s own point of view\nthat hardly any time has passed. \nVirtual. One enters a highly realistic, interactive\nvirtual reality simulator in which some past era has been recreated\ndown to the finest detail. \nCrystal. One looks into a crystal ball and sees what\nhappened at some past time, or will happen at some future\ntime. (Imagine that the crystal ball really works\u2014like a\nclosed-circuit security monitor, except that the vision genuinely\ncomes from some past or future time. Even so, the person looking at\nthe crystal ball is not thereby a time traveller.) \nWaiting. One enters one\u2019s closet and stays there\nfor seven hours. When one emerges, one has \u2018arrived\u2019 seven\nhours in the future of one\u2019s \u2018departure\u2019. \nDateline. One departs at 8pm on Monday, flies for\nfourteen hours, and arrives at 10pm on Monday. \n\n\nA satisfactory definition of time travel would, at least, need to\nclassify the cases in the right way. There might be some\nsurprises\u2014perhaps, on the best definition of \u2018time\ntravel\u2019, Cryogenics turns out to be time travel after\nall\u2014but it should certainly be the case, for example,\nthat G\u00f6del counts as time travel\nand that Sleep and Waiting do\nnot.[7]\n\n\nIn fact there is no entirely satisfactory definition of \u2018time\ntravel\u2019 in the literature. The most popular definition is the\none given by Lewis (1976, 145\u20136):\n What is time travel? Inevitably, it involves a\ndiscrepancy between time and time. Any traveller departs and then\narrives at his destination; the time elapsed from departure to\narrival\u2026is the duration of the journey. But if he is a time\ntraveller, the separation in time between departure and arrival does\nnot equal the duration of his journey.\u2026How can it be that the\nsame two events, his departure and his arrival, are separated by two\nunequal amounts of time?\u2026I reply by distinguishing time itself,\nexternal time as I shall also call it, from the personal time of a\nparticular time traveller: roughly, that which is measured by his\nwristwatch. His journey takes an hour of his personal time, let us\nsay\u2026But the arrival is more than an hour after the departure in\nexternal time, if he travels toward the future; or the arrival is\nbefore the departure in external time\u2026if he travels toward the\npast.\n\nThis correctly excludes Waiting\u2014where the length of\nthe \u2018journey\u2019 precisely matches the separation between\n\u2018arrival\u2019 and\n\u2018departure\u2019\u2014and Crystal, where there is no\njourney at all\u2014and it includes Doctor. It has trouble\nwith G\u00f6del, however\u2014because\nwhen the overall structure of spacetime is as twisted as it is in the\nsort of case G\u00f6del imagined, the notion of external time\n(\u201ctime itself\u201d) loses its grip.\n\n\nAnother definition of time travel that one sometimes encounters in the\nliterature (Arntzenius, 2006, 602) (Smeenk and W\u00fcthrich, 2011, 5,\n26) equates time travel with the existence of CTC\u2019s: closed\ntimelike curves. A curve in this context is a line in spacetime; it is\ntimelike if it could represent the career of a material object; and it\nis closed if it returns to its starting point (i.e. in\nspacetime\u2014not merely in space). This now includes\nG\u00f6del\u2014but it excludes Einstein.\n\n\nThe lack of an adequate definition of \u2018time travel\u2019 does\nnot matter for our purposes\n here.[8] \nIt suffices that we have clear cases of\n(what would count as) time travel\u2014and that these cases give rise\nto all the problems that we shall wish to discuss.\n\n\nSome authors (in philosophy, physics and science fiction) consider\n\u2018time travel\u2019 scenarios in which there are two temporal\ndimensions (e.g. Meiland (1974)), and others consider scenarios in\nwhich there are multiple \u2018parallel\u2019 universes\u2014each\none with its own four-dimensional spacetime (e.g. Deutsch and Lockwood\n(1994)). There is a question whether travelling to another version of\n2001 (i.e. not the very same version one experienced in the\npast)\u2014a version at a different point on the second time\ndimension, or in a different parallel universe\u2014is really time\ntravel, or whether it is more akin to Virtual. In any case,\nthis kind of scenario does not give rise to many of the problems\nthrown up by the idea of travelling to the very same past one\nexperienced in one\u2019s younger days. It is these problems that\nform the primary focus of the present entry, and so we shall not have\nmuch to say about other kinds of \u2018time travel\u2019 scenario in\nwhat follows.\n",
