The Timing Puzzle\n\nIf we cannot identify a time when something makes us worse off than we\notherwise would be, we might well doubt that it really was bad for us.\nWe might go so far as to say that what never makes us worse (better)\noff than we otherwise would be is not bad (good) for us. Call this the\nEpicurean presumption. Given this presumption, proponents of\nthe harm thesis need an answer to the timing question, which\nasks: if death is bad for us, at what time (or times) does it make us\nworse off than we otherwise would have been? In some cases in which\nthings are bad for us, it seems rather easy to identify times when we\nare made worse off, but in other cases, especially in some cases\ninvolving death, it seems more difficult, which may make us worry\nabout the deprivationist defense of the harm thesis. All this needs\nelaboration.\n",
