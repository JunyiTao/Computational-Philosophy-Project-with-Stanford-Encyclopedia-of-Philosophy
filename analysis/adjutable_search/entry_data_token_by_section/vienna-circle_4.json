    "main_text": "Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms\n3. Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms\n\nGiven only the outlines of Vienna Circle philosophy, its controversial\ncharacter is evident. The boldness of its claims made it attractive\nbut that boldness also seemed to be its undoing. Turning to the\nquestions of how far and, if at all, which forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy stand up to some common criticisms, both the synchronic\nvariations and the diachronic trajectories of its variants must be\ntaken into account. This will be attempted in the sections below.\n\nBefore expectations are raised too high, however, it must also\nremembered that in this article only the views of members of the\nVienna Circle can be discussed, even though the problematic issues\nwere pervasive in logical empiricism generally. (Compare the SEP article \u201cLogical Empiricism\u201d; for articles on\nReichenbach see, e.g, Spohn 1991 and Salmon and Wolters 1994,\nRichardson 2005, 2006, and, for the Berlin Group as a whole, Milkov and Peckhaus 2013.) Moreover, here\nthe emphasis must lie on the main protagonists: Schlick, Carnap and\nNeurath. (Neither Hahn or Frank, nor Waismann or Feigl, for instance,\ncan be discussed here as extensively as their work deserves; see,\ne.g., Uebel 2005b, 2011b, McGuinness 2011, Haller 2003, respectively.)\nWhat will be noted, however, is that Vienna Circle philosophy was by\nno means identical with the post-World War II logical empiricism that\nhas come to be known as the \u201creceived view\u201d of scientific\ntheories, even though it would be hard to imagine the latter without\nthe former. (For a systematic if schematic critical discussion of the\nreceived view, see Suppe 1977, for a partial defense Mormann\n2007a.)\n\nTo deepen the somewhat cursory overview of Vienna Circle philosophy\ngiven above, we now turn to the discussion of the following issues:\nfirst, the viability of the conceptions of empirical significance\nemployed by the Vienna Circle in its classical period; second, its uses of\nthe analytic-synthetic distinction; third, its supposedly reductionist\ndesigns and foundationalist ambitions for philosophy; fourth, its\nstances in the debate about realism or anti-realism with regard to the\ntheoretical terms in science; fifth, Carnap\u2019s later ideas in\nresponse to some of the problems encountered; sixth, the issue of the\nstatus of the meaning criterion itself (variably referred to also as \u201ccriterion of significance\u201d or \u201ccriterion of empirical significance\u201d) and of the point of their\ncritique of metaphysics; seventh, the Vienna Circle\u2019s attitude\ntowards history and of their own place in the history of\nphilosophy.\n\nThese topics have been chosen for the light their investigation throws\non the Circle\u2019s own agendas and the reception of its doctrines\namongst philosophers at large, as well as for the relative ease with\nwhich their discussion allows its development and legacy to be\ncharted. There can be little doubt about the enormous impact that the\nmembers of the Vienna Circle had on the development of\ntwentieth-century philosophy. What is less clear is whether any of its\ndistinctive doctrines are left standing once the dust of their\ndiscussion has settled or whether those of its teachings that were\ndeemed defensible merged seamlessly into the broad church that\nanalytic philosophy has become (and, if so, what those surviving\ndoctrines and teachings may be).\n\nIt must be noted, then, that the topics chosen for this article do not\nexhaust the issues concerning which the members of the Vienna Circle\nmade significant contributions (which continue to stimulate work in\nthe history of philosophy of science). Important topics like that of\nthe theory and practice of unified science, of the nature of the\nempirical basis of science (the so-called protocol-sentence debate)\nand of the general structure of the theories of individual sciences\ncan only be touched upon selectively. Likewise, while the general\ntopic of ethical non-cognitivism receives only passing mentions, the\nCircle\u2019s varied approaches to value theory cannot be discussed\nhere (for an overview see Rutte 1986, for detailed analyses see Siegetsleitner 2014). Other matters, like the\ncontributions made by Vienna Circle members to the development of\nprobability theory and inductive logic, the philosophy of logic and\nmathematics (apart from the guiding ideas of Carnap) and to the\nphilosophy of individual empirical sciences (physics, biology,\npsychology, social science), cannot be discussed at all (see Creath\nand Friedman 2007 and Richardson and Uebel 2007 for relevant essays with further references).\nBut it may be noted that with his \u201clogic of science\u201d\nCarnap counts among the pioneers of what nowadays is called\n\u201cformal epistemology\u201d.\n",
