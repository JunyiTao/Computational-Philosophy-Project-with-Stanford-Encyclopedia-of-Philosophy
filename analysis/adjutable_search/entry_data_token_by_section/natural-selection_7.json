An important challenge to the explanatory power of\nselection was made by Gould and Lewontin who impugn the veracity of\nselectionist accounts of the origin of traits whose correctness is\npinned on nothing more than their plausibility and capacity to explain\n(Gould & Lewontin 1979: 588). Gould and Lewontin offer several\nexamples of traits for which such \u201cjust so\u201d stories are\neasy to construct but nonetheless taken to be true on the basis of\nlittle or no evidence beyond the plausibility of the accounts and\ntheir consistency with the theory. Lennox argues that, when not taken\nas even purportedly true, \u201cjust so stories\u201d can play a\ngenuine, if modest, role in the evaluation of scientific theories as\nthought experiments used to assess the explanatory potential of the\ntheory (see also Mayr 1983; Lennox 1991; entry on\n adaptationism).\n In the debate over Darwin\u2019s theory, thought experiments of this\nsort were deployed by both Darwin and his critics in ways both\nlegitimate and rhetorically effective (Lennox 1991).\n\nAnother attack, or set of attacks, on the ability of natural selection\nto explain have to do with the threat that selectionist explanations\nare circular. This sort of problem with a would-be explanation arises\nwhen one must already know what one means to explain in order to\nconstruct one\u2019s (thereby failed) explanation of it. This problem\nsurfaces, in different ways, in the contexts of Lewontin\u2019s\nrequirements, type recursions, and the Price Equation.\n\nLewontin\u2019s requirements for evolution by natural selection\ncontain an ambiguity. \u201cFitness\u201d could refer either to\noffspring number or to fitness variables of the sort found in the\ngenotypic selection equation above (the \\(w\\)\u2019s).\nGodfrey-Smith, in noting that some formalisms do not feature fitness\nvariables at all, is using the term in the latter sense (2007: 496),\nwhile Okasha\u2019s treatment of Lewontin\u2019s requirements uses\nfitness in the former sense. Suppose fitness means offspring number\nand suppose further that the requirements play the role of determining\nunder what circumstances evolutionary theory may be deployed. If these\nthings hold, then the circularity problem arises: we must know that\nthe variants in the system have different numbers of offspring in\norder to apply Lewontin\u2019s requirements to deploy the theory that\nwould explain the very same offspring production despite such\nproduction serving to license the theory\u2019s deployment in the\nfirst place.\n\nConsider type recursions next. Suppose we must know actual\nreproduction rates to assign relative fitnesses values in type\nrecursions. Were this so, an alleged explanation of the extent of\nevolutionary change in the system that makes crucial use of type\nrecursions would be circular. The circularity problem does not come up\nfor practicing biologists deploying type recursions, as those workers\nrely upon fitness estimates that are inferred from statistical facts\nabout a target system during the estimation phase in order to assign\nvalues to variables in type recursions that are then deployed over the\nsystem during the projection phase. What such biologists mean to\nexplain, the behavior during the projection phase, is different from\nwhat they use to construct the explanation, the behavior during the\nestimation phase (Mills & Beatty 1979; Bouchard & Rosenberg\n2004; the estimation/projection phase contrast is due to Glymour\n2006).\n\nThat the scientists largely agree about the practice of statistical\nestimation shows that they largely share some tacit concepts of\nselection and fitness, ones it would be an advance for philosophers to\ndefine. Philosophers have developed definitions of fitness. Brandon\nwas the first to defend the propensity interpretation of fitness and\nit has earned much discussion since (Brandon 1978; Mills & Beatty\n1979; Rosenberg 1982; Brandon & Beatty 1984; Brandon 1990; Sober\n2000). Rosenberg and Bouchard have developed a recent definition of\nfitness based on the relationships between an individual and its\nenvironment that contribute to the individual\u2019s success\n(Bouchard & Rosenberg 2004; for more on \u201cfitness\u201d see\nentry on\n fitness).\n\nTurning finally to how the tautology problem surfaces in the context\nof the Price Equation, consider how that equation formally represents\nthe extent of evolution across some time period in which reproduction\noccurs. Assigning values to its statistical functions requires\ninformation that spans that time period, such as information about the\noffspring number of the parents and the phenotypes of the offspring.\nThe deployment of the Price Equation does not involve any\nestimation/projection period contrast. It cannot be used a source of\nnew information about some time period that remains otherwise\nunexamined. The Price Equation could not, for instance, be used to\nmake a prediction about the dynamics of some system into the future in\nthe same way that type recursions can do. This is because \u201can\napplication of the Price equation for the purpose of prediction would\npresuppose the very information you want to predict with it\u201d\n(Otsuka 2016: 466). For this reason, Otsuka claims that the equation\nis not explanatory (2016: 466).\n\nAnother difficulty faced by selectionist explanations has to do with\ntheir reliability. Glymour has argued against the reliability of\nexplanations constructed using type recursions: \u201cpopulation\ngenetics models evolving populations with the wrong variables related\nby the wrong equations employing the wrong kinds of parameters\u201d\n(Glymour 2006: 371). Glymour demonstrates that exogenous fitness\nvariables cannot be used to quantify environmental causes of\nreproduction that change in their influence during the projection\nperiod. Fitness cannot be a kind of summary variable that abstracts\naway from the causal details of the natural population while also\nfunctioning to reliably predict and explain the dynamics of the\nsystems to which type recursions apply. Gildenhuys (Gildenhuys 2011)\nprovides a response to Glymour, acceding that his arguments are valid\nbut contending that there are a variety of ways to complexify type\nrecursions to formally handle the influence of environmental causes;\nGlymour (2013) provides a reply.\n",
