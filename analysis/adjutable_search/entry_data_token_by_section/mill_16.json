    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || On Liberty and Freedom of Character and Action\n4.7 Authority and Democracy\n\nAs we have seen, Mill believes that we can have no genuine knowledge\na priori. One important result of this general claim, Mill\nholds, is that knowledge\u2014on political and ethical matters, as\nwell as within the physical sciences\u2014is more difficult to\nacquire than those who appeal directly to intuition or common sense\nmight wish. An individual\u2019s need for knowledge far outstrips the\npossibility of individual observation\u2014as such, the vast majority\nof our knowledge must be acquired on the basis of testimony.\n\n\nI yield to no one in the degree of intelligence of which I believe\n[the people] to be capable. But I do not believe that, along with this\nintelligence, they will ever have sufficient opportunities of study\nand experience, to become themselves familiarly conversant with all\nthe inquiries which lead to the truths by which it is good that they\nshould regulate their conduct, and to receive into their own minds the\nwhole of the evidence from which those truths have been collected, and\nwhich is necessary for their establishment. [\u2026] As long as the\nday consists but of twenty-four hours, and the age of man extends but\nto threescore and ten [\u2026] the great majority of mankind will\nneed the far greater part of their time and exertions for procuring\ntheir daily bread. (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 241)\n\n\nIn previous ages, the existence of a leisured and spiritual class\nmeant that it was relatively easy to establish who possessed\nthe intellectual authority to function as leaders in thought and\naction (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 304\u20135). But the\neighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers had discredited these\ntrusted forms of authority, making it increasingly difficult to\ndistinguish \u201cwell-grounded opinion\u201d from\n\u201ccharlatanerie\u201d (Civilization, XVIII: 132,\n 135).[8]\n The rise of the numerical majority in the modern-era meant that the\nindividual was liable to become \u201cso lost in the crowd, that\nthough he depends more and more upon opinion, he is apt to depend less\nand less upon well-grounded opinion\u201d (Civilization,\nXVIII: 132; cf. Liberty, VIII: 268).\n\nUltimately, Mill remains optimistic about the prospects of the modern\nindividual to successfully autonomously navigate that crowd and\nidentify voices worthy of respect.\n\n\nNo government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy [\u2026] ever\ndid or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign\nMany have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they\nalways have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly\ngifted and instructed One or Few. [\u2026] The honour and glory of\nthe average man is that he is capable of following that initiative;\nthat he can respond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to\nthem with his eyes open. (Liberty, XVIII: 269)\n\n\nHe is conscious, however, that effort is required to preserve and\ncultivate the individual\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to\nsuch voices. Formal education, of course, must play a significant role\nin maintaining an \u201can enlightened public\u201d who know enough\n\u201cto be able to discern who are those that know them\nbetter\u201d (Inaugural Address, XXI: 223; see Findlay\n2017). But Mill also looks to the institution of democracy\nitself to help solidify the influence of elites.\n\nMill held, as was noted above\n (section 4.4),\n that the democratic expansion of the franchise was inevitable, and to\nbe welcomed. Possessing the vote ensured that an individual\u2019s\ninterests would be represented\u2014and, equally importantly, it had\nan elevating and educative effect on the public. Active participation\nin collective decision making was, Mill held, part of the good and\nhappy life (Urbinati 2002). He was in favor, therefore, of extending\nthe vote to all those who were not reliant on public support and\npossessed a basic competency in reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\u201cBut though every one ought to have a voice\u2014that every one\nshould have an equal voice is a totally different proposition\u201d\n(Considerations, XIX: 473). In an ideal system of democracy,\nMill held, those whose opinions are \u201centitled to a greater\namount of consideration\u201d would be given more consideration, with\nlevel of education determining the number of votes a person could cast\n(Considerations, XIX: 474; see Miller 2015).\n\nA system of plural voting would not only counteract the tendency of\ndemocracy to descend into rule by the mob, but would embody and signal\nthe general principle that some opinions are more worthy of attention\nthan others.\n\n\nIt is not useful, but hurtful, that the constitution of the country\nshould declare ignorance to be entitled to as much political power as\nknowledge. The national institutions should place all things that they\nare concerned with, before the mind of the citizen in the light in\nwhich it is for his good that he should regard them: and as it is for\nhis good that he should think that every one is entitled to some\ninfluence, but the better and wiser to more than others.\n(Considerations, XIX: 478)\n\n\nMill\u2019s concern to ensure that the recognition of genuine\nexpertise is not lost in the age of democracy also underlies\nhis support for Thomas Hare\u2019s system of Proportional\nRepresentation. Instead of limiting the choice to local candidates,\nMill hoped to allow voters to join together and elect the most\ndistinguished candidates from throughout the nation, resulting in the\n\u201cvery \u00e9lite of the country\u201d being elected\nto, and exercising an influence within and beyond, Parliament\n(Considerations, XIX: 456). The desire for expertise also\nguides Mill\u2019s belief that a Second Chamber would, at best, be a\nSenate composed of those who had previously held high political\noffices or employments, and had thereby established their quality as\n\u201cnatural leaders\u201d (Considerations, XIX: 516).\n\nMill\u2019s attempt to secure conditions in which genuine authorities\ncan be identified and heard amongst the clamor of democratic society\nis not, of course, an attempt to stifle other voices. Neither\nis it an attempt to impose the will of experts on an unwilling\nmajority. At all points, Mill remains committed to the freedom of\nindividuals to hold and express their own opinions, and to the\nsovereignty of the majority will on public matters. His sensitivity\ntowards the very real dangers of populism in modern societies is, that\nis to say, never allowed to overshadow his basic commitment to liberal\ndemocracy as the political system most suited to the cultivation of a\nfree, active, and happy citizenry.\n",
