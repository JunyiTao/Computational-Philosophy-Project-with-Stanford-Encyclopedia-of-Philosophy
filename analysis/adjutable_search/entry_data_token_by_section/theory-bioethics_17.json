Feminist approaches to bioethics offer a framework\nfor approaching bioethics at least in the sense of developing and\nadhering to a certain set of theoretical commitments. Some of those\ncommitments address forms of moral reasoning, some address substantive\ncommitments about how to bring about a more just social order, and\nsome address questions about which perspective should take priority in\nthe analysis of a bioethical issue. Some contend that bioethics has\nlargely ignored work in feminist ethics more broadly, making it all\nthe more crucial that a feminist approach to bioethics act as a\ncorrective to various trends (such as an inattentiveness to social\ncontext, and an emphasis on liberal individualism) (Wolf\n1996a). Suggestions abound as to how a feminist approach can, and\nin fact does, do that.\n\nTo start, a feminist approach can pay special attention to the\nexperiences of women. Further, it can subject to critical scrutiny the\nemployment of the concept of a common morality, a concept which\nallegedly entrenches bioethics as a conversation amongst experts.\nBioethics as such a conversation excludes alternative viewpoints,\nincluding the viewpoints of laypeople, and of those on the margins. A\nfeminist approach might invoke standpoint theory, which would draw\nupon the insights of the most disadvantaged in society. Finally, a\nfeminist theoretical approach could demand attention to lived\nexperience, turning the emphasis away from the abstract theorizing of\nnon-feminist moral philosophy and bioethics (Wolf 1996a).\n\nTwo further benefits of a feminist approach to bioethics have been set\nout, apart from how it might directly correct for the effects of a\nmasculinist moral philosophy and bioethics. First, a feminist approach\nboth attunes us to the effects of androcentric reasoning in the\nanalysis of bioethical issues, and mitigates those effects. Second, it\ndraws our attention to the gendered nature of many concepts key to\nbioethical analysis. For instance, in looking at the concepts of\nreason and emotion, a feminist approach helps us to see that the\nconcepts themselves seem partly to be gendered concepts. Reason is, or\nat least traditionally has been, associated with the male, and emotion\nwith the female. The same holds true with the distinction between the\npublic and private spheres, with the public domain belonging to men,\nthe private the women\u2019s realm. But what\u2019s more, we see\nthat that which is associated with woman (emotion, for example) tends\nto be undervalued. As Margaret Little lays it out, traditional moral\nepistemology takes reason, and not emotion, to be critical to moral\nunderstanding. It is also important to notice the dualistic nature of\nthe picture presented above. Just as men and women have traditionally\noccupied different spheres, so too have gendered concepts occupied\nfixed places on either side of a divide. The domestic sphere, for\ninstance, is taken to have nothing instructive to offer the world of\neconomic or political relations, or bioethics (Little 1996).\n\nWe can see these sorts of commitments played out in Susan\nSherwin\u2019s approach to the abortion question. According to her, a\nrecognition of gender and sexual politics, and of women\u2019s\nvulnerability in general and to sexual coercion in particular, are on\nher view crucial aspects of a feminist approach. Further, a feminist\napproach takes as central the moral prerogative of the women\nconcerned, rather than focusing on such questions as fetal moral\nstatus, or on the task of formulating a set of general rules as to\nwhen abortion is or is not morally justified. In keeping with this, a\nfeminist approach denies the possibility of a gender-neutral account\nof pregnancy, or of abortion decisions. From a feminist perspective,\nthe most morally salient feature of pregnancy\n\n\nis that it takes place in women\u2019s bodies and has\nprofound effects on women\u2019s lives (Sherwin 1992:\n363).\n\n\nWhen we look at feminist treatments of physician-assisted dying (PAS),\nwe again see certain kinds of theoretical commitments come to the\nfore. For instance, an adherence to the feminist care perspective\nleads Leslie Bender to support PAS (Bender 1992). By contrast, Susan\nM. Wolf\u2019s application of a feminist approach as manifest by an\nemphasis upon the significance of gender leads her to conclude that\nPAS should not be legitimized. Pointing to the insidiousness of\ncertain familiar images\u2014images of feminine self-sacrifice, for\ninstance\u2014as well as to early prominent cases of\nphysician-assisted dying and euthanasia in which the physician was\nmale, the patient female, Wolf warns us of the dangers of the dynamic\nbetween the \u201cpowerful expert physician and the woman\nsurrendering to his care\u201d (Wolf 1996b: 293).\n\nIn thinking about feminist approaches to bioethics in connection to\nthe relation between theory and bioethics, it is not a uniform\napproach, seeing as its proponents will not always adhere to the same\nset of commitments. (For example, in her work referenced above Bender\nadheres to a care-oriented thinking, where other feminist bioethicists\nwill be more representative of liberal feminism.) A feminist approach\nis theoretical at least in its adherence to certain (feminist\nintellectual) commitments, even if there is not agreement across the\nboard as to what those should be. Overall, feminist approaches to\nbioethics have made a significant impact and have changed the course\nof the conversation in bioethics, even if those approaches are\nsomewhat varied and represent a theoretical approach to bioethics in\nless strictly defined a way than other approaches might. The preceding\ndiscussion focuses upon scholarly contributions; feminist scholars\nhave also addressed clinical ethics (Sherwin & Baylis 2003). It is\nto the clinical realm, and moral theory\u2019s role there, that we\nnow turn.\n",
