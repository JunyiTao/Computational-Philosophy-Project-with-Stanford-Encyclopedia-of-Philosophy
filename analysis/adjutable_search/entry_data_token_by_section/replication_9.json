    "main_text": "Challenges to the Replicator || Developmental Systems Theory\n5.1 Developmental Systems Theory\n\nIn the wake of Oyama\u2019s The Ontogeny of Information\n(1985, 2000) and other work, notably that of Daniel Lehrman (1953) and\nPatrick Bateson (2001), a view of biological evolution has arisen that\nemphasizes development (see also Griffiths & Gray 1994a). In the\nnineteenth century, development was an extremely active research\nprogram. The next great discoveries in biology were predicted to be in\nthe area of development; however, this was not to be. First\nMendelian genetics and then a version of evolutionary theory centered\non population genetics took over biology, and they did so while\navoiding development. Everyone knew that development was central to\nboth evolution and reproduction, but no one could see how to integrate\nthe masses of developmental data available into the emerging synthesis\nof evolutionary biology and genetics. As a result, development was\nleft out of the Modern Synthesis (Beurton, Falk, & Rheinberger\n2000; Gilbert 1991). Considering how central development actually is\nin metazoan and metaphyte biology, the advances made while ignoring it\nare staggering.\n\nEven so, developmental biology continued on its course until, at long\nlast, we seem to understand development well enough to begin\nintegrating it into the rest of biology. On the most conservative\nview, current versions of evolutionary theory can remain largely\nunchanged as development is grafted onto them. On a second view, both\nperspectives are likely to require some modification to achieve this\nintegration. Our understanding of development may have to be modified,\nbut so too for evolutionary theory (Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010).\nFinally, at the other extreme, development will all but replace\nevolutionary theory. In their more exuberant moments, some advocates\nof Developmental Systems Theory (DST) seem to be claiming just that.\nJust as some molecular biologists think that molecular biology is\nrapidly replacing all the rest of biology, some advocates of DST argue\nthat developmental theories will simply replace current versions of\nevolutionary theory.\n\nOn some versions of the DST view, genes have no uniquely privileged\nrole in repeated cycles of development (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths\n& Gray 1994b). In fact, no element of the developmental matrix\nplays any privileged causal role\u2014not genes, not organisms, not\nthe environment, not anything. Everything counts as a resource;\nhowever, in particular situations, certain resources will play\nmore important roles than other resources. In rejecting any privileged\nrole for genes, advocates of DST are especially skeptical of one\nparticular role supposedly played by genes\u2014the transmission of\ninformation. According to some, information is central to\ndevelopmentalism, but genes are not the only mechanisms for\ninformation transfer. According to others, information plays no role\nin the emerging developmentalist perspective. The developmental system\nas a whole is the unit of selection [see the entry on\n units and levels of selection].\n If genes have no special role and whole developmental cycles are\nreplicators, as some developmental systems theorists argue, the\ndistinction between replicator and interactor becomes blurred.\n\nIn the continuing debate over developmental versus traditional\ntheories of evolutionary biology, Sterelny et al. (1996) hold a fairly\nconservative position. They agree with the developmentalists that\ngenes play no privileged role in the development of phenotypes from\ngenotypes. Genes do play a role in this process, simply not a\nprivileged role. Genes can serve as a causal bridge from\nphenotype to phenotype, but other entities can do so as well. Genes\nare not the only replicators in biological evolution. The repeated\ncycles in inheritance include many different sorts of constancies and\nrepetitions\u2014genes, cellular machinery, phenotypic traits\nincluding behaviors, and social structures. Information remains\ncentral to selection processes, but genes are not the only carriers of\nsuch information. Genes predict phenotypic characters only in the same\nsense that environmental factors predict them. Sterelny (2000a) has\nargued that developmental considerations require no fundamental\nreevaluation of evolutionary conceptions along the lines of DST.\n",
