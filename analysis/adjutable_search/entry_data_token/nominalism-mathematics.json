Two views about mathematics: nominalism and platonism\nIn ontological discussions about mathematics, two views are\nprominent. According to platonism, mathematical objects (as well as\nmathematical relations and structures) exist and are abstract; that\nis, they are not located in space and time and have no causal\nconnection with us. Although this characterization of abstract\nobjects is purely negative\u2014indicating what such\nobjects are not\u2014in the context of mathematics it\ncaptures the crucial features the objects in questions are supposed to\nhave. According to nominalism, mathematical objects (including,\nhenceforth, mathematical relations and structures) do not exist, or at\nleast they need not be taken to exist for us to make sense of\nmathematics. So, it is the nominalist's burden to show how to\ninterpret mathematics without the commitment to the existence of\nmathematical objects. This is, in fact, a key feature of nominalism:\nthose who defend the view need to show that it is possible to yield at\nleast as much explanatory work as the platonist obtains, but invoking\na meager ontology. To achieve that, nominalists in the philosophy of\nmathematics forge interconnections with metaphysics (whether\nmathematical objects do exist), epistemology (what kind of knowledge\nof these entities we have), and philosophy of science (how to make\nsense of the successful application of mathematics in science without\nbeing committed to the existence of mathematical entities). These\ninterconnections are one of the sources of the variety of nominalist\nviews.\nDespite the substantial differences between nominalism and\nplatonism, they have at least one feature in common: both come in many\nforms. There are various versions of platonism in the philosophy of\nmathematics: standard (or object-based) platonism (G\u00f6del 1944,\n1947; Quine 1960), structuralism (Resnik 1997; Shapiro 1997), and\nfull-blooded platonism (Balaguer 1998), among other views. Similarly,\nthere are also several versions of nominalism: fictionalism (Field\n1980, 1989), modal structuralism (Hellman 1989, 1996),\nconstructibilism (Chihara 1990), the weaseling-away view (Melia 1995,\n2000), figuralism (Yablo 2001), deflationary nominalism (Azzouni\n2004), agnostic nominalism (Bueno 2008, 2009), and pretense views\n(Leng 2010), among others. Similarly to their platonist counterparts,\nthe various nominalist proposals have different motivations, and face\ntheir own difficulties. These will be explored in turn. (A critical\nsurvey of various nominalization strategies in mathematics can be\nfound in Burgess and Rosen (1997). The authors address in detail both\nthe technical and philosophical issues raised by nominalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics.)\nDiscussions about nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics in\nthe 20th century started roughly with the work that\nW. V. Quine and Nelson Goodman developed toward constructive\nnominalism (Goodman and Quine 1947). But, as Quine later pointed out,\nin the end it was indispensable to quantify over classes (Quine\n1960). As will become clear below, responses to this indispensability\nargument have generated a significant amount of work for\nnominalists. And it is the focus on the indispensability argument that\nlargely distinguishes more recent nominalist views in the philosophy\nof mathematics, which I will focus on, from the nominalism developed\nin the early part of the 20th century by the Polish school\nof logic (Simons 2010).\nMathematical nominalism is a form of anti-realism about abstract\nobjects. This is an independent issue from the traditional problem of\nnominalism about universals. A universal, according to a widespread\nuse, is something that can be instantiated by different\nentities. Since abstract objects are neither spatial nor temporal,\nthey cannot be instantiated. Thus, mathematical nominalism and\nnominalism about universals are independent from one another (see the\nentry on nominalism in\nmetaphysics). It could be argued that certain sets encapsulate the\ninstantiation model, since a set of concrete objects can be\ninstantiated by such objects. But since the same set cannot\nbe so instantiated, given that sets are individuated by their members\nand as long as their members are different the resulting sets are not\nthe same, it is not clear that even these sets are instantiated. I\nwill focus here on mathematical nominalism.\n2. Five Problems\nIn contemporary philosophy of mathematics, nominalism has been\nformulated in response to difficulties faced by platonism. But in\ndeveloping their responses to platonism, nominalists also encounter\ndifficulties of their own. Five problems need to be addressed in this\ncontext:\n\nThe epistemological problem of mathematics,\nThe problem of the application of mathematics,\nThe problem of uniform semantics,\nThe problem of taking mathematical discourse literally, and\nThe ontological problem.\n\nUsually, problems (1) and (5) are considered as raising\ndifficulties for platonism, whereas problems (2), (3), and (4) are\noften taken as yielding difficulties for nominalism. (I will discuss\nbelow to what extent such an assessment is accurate.) Each of these\nproblems will be examined in turn.\n2.1 The epistemological problem of mathematics\nGiven that platonism postulates the existence of mathematical\nobjects, the question arises as to how we obtain knowledge about\nthem. The epistemological problem of mathematics is the problem of\nexplaining the possibility of mathematical knowledge, given that\nmathematical objects themselves do not seem to play any role in\ngenerating our mathematical beliefs (Field 1989).\nThis is taken to be a particular problem for platonism, since this\nview postulates the existence of mathematical objects, and one would\nexpect such objects to play a role in the acquisition of mathematical\nknowledge. After all, on the platonist view, such knowledge is about\nthe corresponding mathematical objects. However, despite various\nsophisticated attempts by platonists, there is still considerable\ncontroversy as to how exactly this process should be\narticulated. Should it be understood via mathematical intuition, by\nthe introduction of suitable mathematical principles and definitions,\nor does it require some form of abstraction?\nIn turn, the epistemological issue is far less problematic for\nnominalists, who are not committed to the existence of mathematical\nobjects in the first place. They will have to explain other things,\nsuch as, how can the nominalist account for the difference between a\nmathematician, who knows a significant amount of mathematics, and a\nnon-mathematician, who does not? This difference, according to some\nnominalists, is based on empirical and logical knowledge\u2014not on\nmathematical knowledge (Field 1989).\n2.2 The problem of the application of mathematics\nMathematics is often successfully used in scientific theories. How\ncan such a success be explained? Platonists allegedly have an answer\nto this problem. Given that mathematical objects exist and are\nsuccessfully referred to by our scientific theories, it is not\nsurprising that such theories are successful. Reference to\nmathematical objects is just part of the reference to those entities\nthat are indispensable to our best theories of the world. This frames\nthe problem of the application of mathematics in terms of the\nindispensability argument.\nIn fact, one of the main reasons for belief in the existence of\nmathematical objects\u2014some claim this is the only\nnon-question begging reason (Field 1980)\u2014is given by the\nindispensable use of mathematics in science. The crucial idea,\noriginally put forward by W. V. Quine, and later articulated, in a\ndifferent way, by Hilary Putnam, is that ontological commitment should\nbe restricted to just those entities that are indispensable to our\nbest theories of the world (Quine 1960; Putnam 1971; Colyvan\n2001a). Mark Colyvan has formulated the argument in the following\nterms:\n\n(P1) We ought to be ontologically committed to all and only those\n  entities that are indispensable to our best theories of the\n  world.\n(P2) Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best theories\n  of the world.\nTherefore, (C) we ought to be ontologically committed to\n  mathematical entities.\n\nThe first premise relies crucially on Quine's criterion of\nontological commitment. After regimenting our best theories of the\nworld in a first-order language, the ontological commitments of these\ntheories can be read off as being the value of the existentially\nquantified variables. But how do we move from the ontological\ncommitments of a theory to what we ought to be ontologically\ncommitted to? This is the point where the first premise of the\nindispensability argument emerges. If we are dealing with our best\ntheories of the world, precisely those items that are indispensable to\nthese theories amount to what we ought to be committed\nto. (Of course, a theory may quantify over more objects than those\nthat are indispensable.) And by identifying the indispensable\ncomponents invoked in the explanation of various phenomena, and noting\nthat mathematical entities are among them, the platonist is then in a\nposition to make sense of the success of applied mathematics.\nHowever, it turns out that whether the platonist can indeed explain\nthe success of the application of mathematics is, in fact,\ncontroversial. Given that mathematical objects are abstract, it is\nunclear why the postulation of such entities is helpful to understand\nthe success of applied mathematics. For the physical world\u2014being\ncomposed of objects located in space-time\u2014is not constituted by\nthe entities postulated by the platonist. Hence, it is not clear why\nthe correct description of relations among abstract\n(mathematical) entities is even relevant to understand the\nbehavior of concrete objects in the physical world involved in the\napplication of mathematics. Just mentioning that the physical\nworld instantiates structures (or substructures) described in\ngeneral terms by various mathematical theories is not enough (see,\ne.g., Shapiro 1997). For there are infinitely many mathematical\nstructures, and there is no way of uniquely determining which of them\nis actually instantiated\u2014or even instantiated only in\npart\u2014in a finite region of the physical world. There is a\ngenuine underdetermination here, given that the same physical\nstructure in the world can be accommodated by very different\nmathematical structures. For instance, quantum mechanical phenomena\ncan be characterized by group-theoretic structures (Weyl 1928) or by\nstructures emerging from the theory of Hilbert spaces (von Neumann\n1932). Mathematically, such structures are very different, but there\nis no way of deciding between them empirically.\nDespite the controversial nature of the platonist claim to be able\nto explain the success of applied mathematics, to accommodate that\nsuccess is often taken as a significant benefit of platonism. Less\ncontroversially, the platonist is certainly able to describe the way\nin which mathematical theories are actually used in scientific\npractice without having to rewrite them. This is, as will become clear\nbelow, a significant benefit of the view.\nNominalism, in turn, faces the difficulty of having to explain the\nsuccessful use of mathematics in scientific theorizing. Since,\naccording to the nominalist, mathematical objects do not\nexist\u2014or, at least, are not taken to exist\u2014it becomes\nunclear how referring to such entities can contribute to the empirical\nsuccess of scientific theories. In particular, if it turns out that\nreference to mathematical entities is indeed indispensable to our best\ntheories of the world, how can the nominalist deny the existence of\nsuch entities? As we will see below, several nominalist views in the\nphilosophy of mathematics have emerged in response to the challenge\nraised by considerations based on the indispensability of\nmathematics.\n2.3 The problem of uniform semantics\nOne of the most significant features of platonism is the fact that\nit allows us to adopt the same semantics for both mathematical and\nscientific discourse. Given the existence of mathematical objects,\nmathematical statements are true in the same way as scientific\nstatements are true. The only difference emerges from their respective\ntruth makers: mathematical statements are true in virtue of abstract\n(mathematical) objects and relations among them, whereas scientific\nstatements are ultimately true in virtue of concrete objects and the\ncorresponding relations among such objects. This point is idealized in\nthat it assumes that, somehow, we can manage to distill the empirical\ncontent of scientific statements independently of the contribution\nmade by the mathematics that is often used to express such\nstatements. Platonists who defend the indispensability argument insist\nthat this is not possible to do (Quine 1960; Colyvan 2001a); even some\nnominalists concur (Azzouni 2011).\nMoreover, as is typical in the application of mathematics, there\nare also mixed statements, which involve both terms referring\nto concrete objects and terms referring to abstract ones. The\nplatonist has no trouble providing a unified semantics for such\nstatements either\u2014particularly if mathematical platonism is\nassociated with realism about science. In this case, the platonist can\nprovide a referential semantics throughout. Of course, the platonist\nabout mathematics need not be a realist about\nscience\u2014although it's common to combine platonism and realism in\nthis way. In principle, the platonist could adopt some form of\nanti-realism about science, such as constructive empiricism (van\nFraassen 1980; Bueno 2009). As long as the form of anti-realism\nregarding science allows for a referential semantics (and many do),\nthe platonist would have no trouble providing a unified semantics for\nboth mathematics and science (Benacerraf 1973).\nIt is not clear that the nominalist can deliver these benefits. As\nwill become clear shortly, most versions of nominalism require a\nsubstantial rewriting of mathematical language. As a result, a\ndistinct semantics needs to be offered for that language in comparison\nwith the semantics that is provided for scientific discourse.\n\n2.4 The problem of taking mathematical discourse literally\nA related benefit of platonism is that it allows one to take\nmathematical discourse literally, given that mathematical terms\nrefer. In particular, there is no change in the syntax of mathematical\nstatements. So, when mathematicians claim that \u2018There are\ninfinitely many prime numbers\u2019, the platonist can take that\nstatement literally as describing the existence of an infinitude of\nprimes. On the platonist view, there are obvious truth-makers for\nmathematical statements: mathematical objects and their corresponding\nproperties and relations (Benacerraf 1973).\nWe have here a major benefit of platonism. If one of the goals of\nthe philosophy of mathematics is to provide understanding of\nmathematics and mathematical practice, it is a significant advantage\nthat platonists are able to take the products of that\npractice\u2014such as mathematical theories\u2014literally and do\nnot need to rewrite or reformulate them. After all, the platonist is\nthen in a position to examine mathematical theories as they are\nactually formulated in mathematical practice, rather than discuss a\nparallel discourse offered by various reconstructions of mathematics\ngiven by those who avoid the commitment to mathematical objects (such\nas the nominalists).\nThe inability to take mathematical discourse literally is indeed a\nproblem for nominalists, who typically need to rewrite the relevant\nmathematical theories. As will become clear below, it is common that\nnominalization strategies for mathematics change either the syntax or\nthe semantics of mathematical statements. For instance, in the case of\nmodal structuralism, modal operators are introduced to preserve verbal\nagreement with the platonist (Hellman 1989). The proposal is that each\nmathematical statement S is translated into two modal\nstatements: (i) if there were structures of the suitable\nkind, S would be true in these structures, and (ii) it's\npossible that there are such structures. As a result, both the syntax\nand the semantics of mathematics are changed. In the case of\nmathematical fictionalism, in order to preserve verbal agreement with\nthe platonist despite the denial of the existence of mathematical\nobjects, fiction operators (such as, \u2018According to\narithmetic\u2026\u2019) are introduced (Field 1989). Once again,\nthe resulting proposal changes the syntax (and, hence, the semantics)\nof mathematical discourse. This is a significant cost for these\nviews.\n2.5 The ontological problem\nThe ontological problem consists in specifying the nature of the\nobjects a philosophical conception of mathematics is ontologically\ncommitted to. Can the nature of these objects be properly determined?\nAre the objects in question such that we simply lack good grounds to\nbelieve in their existence? Traditional forms of platonism have been\ncriticized for failing to offer an adequate solution to this\nproblem. In response, some platonists have argued that the commitment\nto mathematical objects is neither problematic nor mysterious (see,\ne.g., Hale and Wright 2001). Similarly, even though some nominalists\nneed not be committed to mathematical objects, they may be committed\nto other entities that may also raise ontological concerns (such as\npossibilia). The ontological problem is then the problem of assessing\nthe status of the ultimate commitments of the view.\nThree nominalization strategies will be discussed below:\nmathematical fictionalism (Field 1980, 1989), modal structuralism\n(Hellman 1989, 1996), and deflationary nominalism (Azzouni 2004). The\nfirst two reject the second premise of the indispensability\nargument. They provide \u2018hard roads\u2019 to nominalism (Colyvan\n2010), in the sense that the nominalist needs to develop the complex,\ndemanding work of showing how quantification over mathematical objects\ncan be avoided in order to develop a suitable interpretation of\nmathematics. The third strategy rejects the first premise of the\nargument, thus bypassing the need to argue for the dispensability of\nmathematics (in fact, for the deflationary nominalist, mathematics is\nultimately indispensable). By reassessing Quine's criterion of\nontological commitment, and indicating that quantification over\ncertain objects does not require their existence, this strategy yields\nan \u2018easy road\u2019 to nominalism.\nAlthough this survey is clearly not exhaustive, since not every\nnominalist view available will be considered here, the three views\ndiscussed are representative: they occupy distinct points in the\nlogical space, and they have been explicitly developed to address the\nvarious problems just listed.\n3. Mathematical Fictionalism\n3.1 Central features of mathematical fictionalism\nIn a series of works, Hartry Field provided an ingenious strategy\nfor the nominalization of science (Field 1980, 1989). As opposed to\nplatonist views, in order to explain the usefulness of mathematics in\nscience, Field does not postulate the truth of mathematical\ntheories. In his view, it is possible to explain successful\napplications of mathematics with no commitment to mathematical\nobjects. Therefore, what he takes to be the main argument for\nplatonism, which relies on the (apparent) indispensability of\nmathematics to science, is resisted. The nominalist nature of Field's\naccount emerges from the fact that mathematical objects are not\nassumed to exist. Hence, mathematical theories are false. (Strictly\nspeaking, Field notes, any existential mathematical statement is\nfalse, and any universal mathematical statement is vacuously true.) By\ndevising a strategy that shows how to dispense with mathematical\nobjects in the formulation of scientific theories, Field rejects the\nindispensability argument, and provides strong grounds for the\narticulation of a nominalist stance.\nPrima facie, it may sound counterintuitive to state that\n\u2018there are infinitely many prime numbers\u2019 is false. But if\nnumbers do not exist, that's the proper truth-value for that statement\n(assuming a standard semantics). In response to this concern, Field\n1989 introduces a fictional operator, in terms of which verbal\nagreement can be reached with the platonist. In the case at hand, one\nwould state: \u2018According to arithmetic, there are infinitely many\nprime numbers\u2019, which is clearly true. Given the use of a\nfictional operator, the resulting view is often\ncalled mathematical fictionalism.\nThe nominalization strategy devised by the mathematical\nfictionalist depends on two interrelated moves. The first is to change\nthe aim of mathematics, which is not taken to be truth, but something\ndifferent. On this view, the proper norm of mathematics, which will\nguide the nominalization program, is conservativeness. A\nmathematical theory is conservative if it is consistent with every\ninternally consistent theory about the physical world, where such\ntheories do not involve any reference to, nor quantification over,\nmathematical objects, such as sets, functions, numbers etc. (Field\n1989, p. 58). Conservativeness is stronger than consistency (since if\na theory is conservative, it is consistent, but not vice\nversa). However, conservativeness is not weaker than truth (Field\n1980, pp. 16\u201319; Field 1989, p. 59). So, Field is not\ncountenancing a weaker aim of mathematics, but only\na different one.\nIt is precisely because mathematics is conservative that, despite\nbeing false, it can be useful. Of course, this usefulness is explained\nwith no commitment to mathematical entities: mathematics is useful\nbecause it shortens our derivations. After all, if a mathematical\ntheory M is conservative, then a nominalistic\nassertion A about the physical world (i.e. an assertion which\ndoes not refer to mathematical objects) follows from a body N\nof such assertions and M only if it follows from N\nalone. That is, provided we have a sufficiently rich body of\nnominalistic assertions, the use of mathematics does not yield any new\nnominalistic consequences. Mathematics is only a useful instrument to\nhelp us in the derivations.\nAs a result, conservativeness can only be employed to do the\nrequired job if we have nominalistic premises to start with (Field\n1989, p. 129). As Field points out, it is a confusion to argue against\nhis view by claiming that if we add some bits of mathematics to a\nbody of mathematical claims (not nominalistic ones), we may\nobtain new consequences that could not be achieved otherwise (Field\n1989, p. 128). The restriction to nominalistic assertions is\ncrucial.\nThe second move of the mathematical fictionalist strategy is to\nprovide such nominalistic premises. Field has done that in one\nimportant case: Newtonian gravitational theory. He elaborates on a\nwork that has a respectable tradition: Hilbert's axiomatization of\ngeometry (Hilbert 1971). What Hilbert provided was a synthetic\nformulation of geometry, which dispenses with metric concepts, and\ntherefore does not include any quantification over real numbers. His\naxiomatization was based on concepts such\nas point, betweenness,\nand congruence. Intuitively speaking, we say that a\npoint y is between the points x and z\nif y is a point in the line-segment whose endpoints\nare x and z. Also intuitively, we say that the\nline-segment xy is congruent to the\nline-segment zw if the distance from the point x to the\npoint y is the same as that from the point z\nto w. After studying the formal properties of the resulting\nsystem, Hilbert proved a representation theorem. He showed, in a\nstronger mathematical theory, that given a model of the axiom system\nfor space he had put forward, there is a function d from pairs\nof points onto non-negative real numbers such that the following\n\u2018homomorphism conditions\u2019 are met:\n\nxy is congruent to zw iff d(x, y) = d(z,w), for all points x, y, z, and w;\ny is between x and z iff d(x, y) + d(y, z) = d(x, z), for all points x, y, and z.\n\nAs a result, if the function d is taken to represent\ndistance, we obtain the expected results about congruence and\nbetweenness. Thus, although we cannot talk about numbers in Hilbert's\ngeometry (there are no such entities to quantify over), there is a\nmetatheoretic result that associates assertions about distances with\nwhat can be said in the theory. Field calls such numerical\nclaims abstract counterparts of purely geometric assertions,\nand they can be used to draw conclusions about purely geometrical\nclaims in a smoother way. Indeed, because of the representation\ntheorem, conclusions about space, statable without real\nnumbers, can be drawn far more easily than we could achieve by a\ndeflationary proof from Hilbert's axioms. This illustrates Field's\npoint that the usefulness of mathematics derives from shortening\nderivations (Field 1980, pp. 24\u201329).\nRoughly speaking, what Field established was how to extend\nHilbert's results about space to space-time. Similarly to Hilbert's\napproach, instead of formulating Newtonian laws in terms of numerical\nfunctors, Field showed that they can be recast in terms of comparative\npredicates. For example, instead of adopting a functor such as\n\u2018the gravitational potential of x\u2019, which is taken\nto have a numerical value, Field employed a comparative predicate such\nas \u2018the difference in gravitational potential between x\nand y is less than that between z\nand w\u2019. Relying on a body of representation theorems\n(which plays the same role as Hilbert's representation theorem in\ngeometry), Field established how several numerical functors can be\n\u2018obtained\u2019 from comparative predicates. But in order to\nuse those theorems, he first showed how to formulate Newtonian\nnumerical laws (such as, Poisson's equation for the gravitational\nfield) only in terms of comparative predicates. The result (Field\n1989, pp. 130\u2013131) is the following extended representation\ntheorem. Let N be a theory formulated only in terms of\ncomparative predicates (with no recourse to numerical functors). For\nany model S of N whose domain is constituted by\nspace-time regions, there exists:\n\nA 1\u20131 spatio-temporal co-ordinate function f (unique up to a generalized Galilean transformation) mapping the space-time of S onto quadruples of real numbers;\nA mass density function g (unique up to a positive multiplicative transformation) mapping the space-time of S onto an interval of non-negative real numbers; and\nA gravitational potential function h (unique up to a positive linear transformation) mapping the space-time onto an interval of real numbers.\n\nMoreover, all these functions \u2018preserve structure\u2019, in\nthe sense that the comparative relations defined in terms of them\ncoincide with the comparative relations used in N. Furthermore,\nif f, g and h are taken as the denotation of the\nappropriate functors, the laws of Newtonian gravitational theory in\ntheir functorial form hold.\nNotice that, in quantifying over space-time regions, Field assumes\na substantivalist view of space-time, according to which there are\nspace-time regions that are not fully occupied (Field 1980,\npp. 34\u201336; Field 1989, pp. 171\u2013180). Given this result,\nthe mathematical fictionalist is allowed to draw nominalistic\nconclusions from premises involving N plus a mathematical\ntheory T. After all, due to the conservativeness of\nmathematics, such conclusions can be obtained independently\nof T. The role of the extended representation theorem is then\nto establish that, despite the lack of quantification over\nmathematical objects, precisely the same class of models is determined\nby formulating Newtonian gravitational theory in terms of functors (as\nthe theory is usually expressed) or in terms of comparative predicates\n(as the mathematical fictionalist favors). Thus, the extended\nrepresentation theorem ensures that the use of conservativeness of\nmathematics together with suitable nominalistic claims (formulated via\ncomparative predicates) does not change the class of models of the\noriginal theory: the same comparative relations are preserved. Hence,\nwhat Field provided is a nominalization strategy, and since it reduces\nontology, it seems a promising candidate for a nominalist\nstance vis-\u00e0-vis mathematics.\nHow should the mathematical fictionalist approach physical\ntheories, such as perhaps string theory, that do not seem to be about\nconcrete observable objects? One possible response, assuming the lack\nof empirical import of such theories, is simply to reject that they\nare physical theories, and as such they are not the sorts of\ntheories for which the mathematical fictionalist needs to provide a\nnominalistic counterpart. In other words, until the moment in which\nsuch theories acquire the relevant empirical import, they need not\nworry the mathematical fictionalist. Theories of that sort would be\nclassified as part of the mathematics rather than the physics.\n3.2 Metalogic and the formulation of conservativeness\nBut is mathematics conservative? In order to establish the\nconservativeness of mathematics, the mathematical fictionalist has\nused metalogical results, such as the completeness and the compactness\nof first-order logic (Field 1992, 1980, 1989). The issue then arises\nas to whether the mathematical fictionalist can use these\nresults to develop the program.\nAt two crucial junctures, Field has made use of metalogical\nresults: (a) in his reformulation of the notion of conservativeness in\nnominalistically acceptable terms (Field 1989, pp. 119\u2013120;\nField 1991), and (b) in his nominalist proof of the conservativeness\nof set theory (Field 1992). These two outcomes are crucial for Field,\nsince they establish the adequacy of conservativeness for the\nmathematical fictionalist. For (a) settles that the latter can\nformulate that notion without violating nominalism, and (b) concludes\nthat conservativeness is a feature that mathematics actually has. But\nif these two outcomes are not legitimate, Field's approach cannot get\noff the ground. I will now consider whether these two uses of\nmetalogical results are acceptable on nominalist grounds.\n3.2.1 Conservativeness and the compactness theorem\nLet me start with (a). The mathematical fictionalist has relied on\nthe compactness theorem to formulate the notion\nof conservativeness in an acceptable way, that is, without\nreference to mathematical entities. As noted above, conservativeness\nis defined in terms of consistency. But this notion is\nusually formulated either in semantic terms (as the existence of an\nappropriate model), or in proof-theoretic terms (in terms of suitable\nproofs). However, as Field acknowledges, these two formulations of\nconsistency are platonist, since they depend on abstract objects\n(models and proofs), and therefore are not nominalistically\nacceptable.\nThe mathematical fictionalist way out is to avoid moving to the\nmetalanguage in order to express the conservativeness of\nmathematics. The idea is to state, in the object-language, the claim\nthat a given mathematical theory is conservative by introducing a\nprimitive notion of logical consistency: \u25caA. Thus,\nif B is any sentence, B* is the result of\nrestricting B to non-mathematical entities,\nand M1, \u2026, Mn are\nthe axioms of a mathematical theory M, the conservativeness\nof M can be expressed by the following schema (Field 1989,\np. 120):\n\n(C) If \u25caB, then \u25ca(B*\n  \u2227 M1 \u2227 \u2026\n  \u2227 Mn).\n\nIn other words, a mathematical theory M is conservative if\nit is consistent with every consistent theory about the physical\nworld B*.\nThis assumes, of course, that M is finitely axiomatized. But\nhow can we apply (C) in the case of mathematical theories that\nare not finitely axiomatizable (such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory)? In this case, we cannot make the conjunction of all the\naxioms of the theory, since there are infinitely many of them. Field\nhas addressed this issue, and he initially suggested that the\nmathematical fictionalist could use substitutional quantification to\nexpress these infinite conjunctions (Field 1984). In a postscript to\nthe revised version of this essay (Field 1989, pp. 119\u2013120), he\nnotes that substitutional quantification can be avoided, provided that\nthe mathematical and physical theories in question are expressed in a\nlogic for which compactness holds. For in this case, the\nconsistency of the whole theory is reduced to the consistency of each\nof its finite conjunctions.\nThere are, however, three problems with this move.\n\nOne concern about the use of substitutional quantification in this context involves the nature of substitutional instances. If the latter turn out to be abstract, which would be the case if such substitutional instances were not mere inscriptions, they are not available to the nominalist. If the substitutional instances are concrete, the nominalist needs to show that there are enough of them.\nThe very statement of the compactness theorem involves set-theoretic talk: let G be a set of formulas; if every finite subset of G is consistent, then G is consistent. How can nominalists rely on a theorem whose very statement involves abstract entities? In order to use this theorem, an appropriate reformulation is required.\nLet us grant that it is possible to reformulate this statement without referring to sets. Can then the nominalist use the compactness theorem? As is well known, the proof of this theorem assumes set theory. The compactness theorem is usually presented as a corollary to the completeness theorem for first-order logic, whose proof assumes set theory (see, for example, Boolos and Jeffrey 1989, pp. 140\u2013141). Alternatively, if the compactness result is to be proved directly, then one has to construct the appropriate model of G\u2014which again requires set theory. So, unless mathematical fictionalists are able to provide an appropriate nominalization strategy for set theory itself, they are not entitled to use this result. In other words, far more work is required before a Field-type nominalist is able to rely on metalogical results.\n\nBut maybe this criticism misses the whole point of Field's\nprogram. As we saw, Field does not require that a mathematical\ntheory M be true for it to be used. Only\nits conservativeness is demanded. So, if M is added to\na body B* of nominalistic claims, no new nominalistic\nconclusion is obtained which was not obtained by B* alone. In\nother words, what Field's strategy asks for is the formulation of\nappropriate nominalistic bodies of claims to which\nmathematics can be applied. The same point holds for metalogical\nresults: provided that they are applied to nominalistic\nclaims, Field is fine.\nThe problem with this reply is that it involves the mathematical\nfictionalist program in a circle. The fictionalist cannot rely on\nthe conservativeness of mathematics to justify the use of a\nmathematical result (the compactness theorem) that is required for\nthe formulation of the notion of conservativeness itself. For\nin doing that, the fictionalist assumes that the notion of\nconservativeness is nominalistically acceptable, and this is exactly\nthe point in question. Recall that the motivation for Field to use the\ncompactness theorem was to reformulate conservativeness without having\nto assume abstract entities (namely, those required by the semantic\nand the proof-theoretic accounts of consistency). Thus, at this point,\nthe mathematical fictionalist cannot yet use the notion of\nconservativeness; otherwise, the whole program would not get off the\nground. I conclude that, similarly to any other part of mathematics,\nmetalogical results also need to be obtained nominalistically. Trouble\narises for nominalism otherwise.\n\n3.2.2 Conservativeness and primitive modality\nBut perhaps the mathematical fictionalist has a way out. As we saw,\nField spells out the notion of conservativeness in terms of a\nprimitive notion of logical consistency: \u25caA. And he also\nindicates that this notion is related to the model-theoretic concept\nof consistency\u2014in particular, to the formulation of this concept\nin von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del finitely axiomatizable set theory\n(NBG). This is done via two principles (Field 1989, p. 108):\n\n(MTP#) If \u2610(NBG \u2192 there is a model for\n  \u2018A\u2019), then \u25caA\n(ME#) If \u2610(NBG \u2192 there is no model for\n  \u2018A\u2019), then \u00ac\u25caA.\n\nI am following Field's terminology: \u2018MTP#\u2019\nstands for model-theoretic possibility, and\n\u2018ME#\u2019 for model existence. The symbol\n\u2018#\u2019 indicates that, according to Field, these\nprinciples are nominalistically acceptable. After all, they are modal\nsurrogates for the platonistic principles (Field 1989,\npp. 103\u2013109):\n\n(MTP) If there is a model for \u2018A\u2019, then\n  \u25caA\n(ME) If there is no model for \u2018A\u2019, then\n  \u00ac\u25caA.\n\nIt may be argued that, by using these principles, the mathematical\nfictionalist will be entitled to use the compactness theorem. First,\none should try to state this theorem in a nominalistically acceptable\nway. Without worrying too much about details, let us grant, for the\nsake of argument, that the following characterization will do:\n\n(Compact#) If \u00ac\u25caT, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1,\n  \u2026, An[\u00ac\u25ca(A1\n  \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 An)],\n\nwhere T is a theory and each Ai, 1\n\u2264 i \u2264 n, is a formula (an axiom of T). The\nexpression\n\u2018\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\u2019\nis to be read as \u2018there are finitely many\nformulas A1\u2026An\u2019. (This\nquantifier is not first-order. However, I am not going to press the\npoint that the nominalist seems to need a non-first-order\nquantifier to express a property typical of first-order\nlogic. This is only one of the worries we are leaving aside in this\nformulation.) This version is parasitic on the following platonistic\nformulation of the compactness theorem:\n\n(Compact) If there is no model for T, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1,\n  \u2026, An such that there is no model\n  for (A1 \u2227 \u2026\n  \u2227 An).\n\nIn order for mathematical fictionalists to be entitled to use the\ncompactness theorem, they will have to show that the nominalistic\nformulation (Compact#) follows from the platonistic one\n(Compact). In this sense, if the latter is adequate, so is the\nformer. More accurately, what has to be shown is that\n(Compact#) follows from a modal surrogate of\n(Compact). After all, since what is at issue is the legitimacy of the\ncompactness theorem on nominalist grounds, it would be\nquestion-begging to assume the full platonistic version from the\noutset. As we will see, there are two ways to try to establish this\nresult. Unfortunately, none of them works: both are formally\ninadequate.\nThe two options start in the same way. Suppose that\n\n(1) \u00ac\u25caT.\n\nWe have to establish that\n\n(2)\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  \u00ac\u25ca(A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An).\n\nIt follows from (1) and (MTP#) that\n\n(3) \u00ac\u2610(NBG \u2192 there is a model for\n  \u2018T\u2019),\n\nand thus\n\n(4) \u25ca(NBG \u2227 there is no model for\n  \u2018T\u2019).\n\nLet us assume the modal surrogate for the compactness theorem:\n\n(CompactM) \u2610(NBG \u2192 if there is no model for\n  \u2018T\u2019, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for\n  (A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An)).\n\nNote that, since the modal surrogate is formulated in terms of\nmodels (rather than in terms of the primitive modal operator), it is\nstill not what mathematical fictionalists need. What they need is\n(Compact#), but one needs to show that they can get it. At\nthis point, the options begin to diverge.\nThe first option consists in drawing from (4) and\n(CompactM) that\n\n(5)\n  \u25ca(\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for (A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An)).\n\nThere are, however, difficulties with this move. First, note that\n(5) is not equivalent to (2), which is the result to be\nachieved. Moreover, as opposed to (2), (5) is formulated in\nmodel-theoretic terms, since it incorporates a claim about the\nnonexistence of a certain model. And what is required is a similar\nstatement in terms of the primitive notion of consistency. In\nother words, we need the nominalistic counterpart of (5), rather than\n(5).\nBut (5) has a nice feature. It is a modalized formulation of the\nconsequent of (Compact). And since (5) only states\nthe possibility that there is no model of a particular kind,\nit may be argued that it is nominalistically acceptable. (As\nwill be examined below, modal structuralists advance a nominalization\nstrategy exploring modality along these lines; see Hellman (1989).)\nField, however, is skeptical about this move. On his view, modality is\nnot a general surrogate for ontology (Field 1989,\npp. 252\u2013268). And one of his worries is that by allowing the\nintroduction of modal operators, as a general nominalization strategy,\nwe modalize away the physical content of the theory under\nconsideration. However, since metalogical claims are not expected to\nhave physical consequences, the worry need not arise here. At any\nrate, given that (5) does not establish what needs to be established,\nit does not solve the problem.\nThe second option consists in moving to (5\u2032) instead of\n(5):\n\n(5\u2032) \u2610(NBG \u2192\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for (A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An)).\n\nNote that if (5\u2032) were established, we would have settled the\nmatter. After all, with a straightforward reworking of\n(ME#) (namely, If \u2610(NBG \u2192\n\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\nsuch that there is no model for\n(A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An)),\nthen \u00ac\u25ca(A1\n\u2227\u2026\u2227 An)), it follows from\n(5\u2032) and (ME#) that\n\n(2)\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  \u00ac\u25ca(A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An),\n\nwhich is the conclusion we need. The problem here is that\n(5\u2032) does not follow from (4) and\n(CompactM). Therefore, we cannot derive it.\nClearly, there may well be another option that establishes the\nintended conclusion. But, to say the least, the mathematical\nfictionalist has to present it before being entitled to use metalogic\nresults. Until then, it is not clear that these results are\nnominalistically acceptable.\n3.2.3 Metalogic and the proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nI should now consider issue (b): Field's nominalistic proof of the\nconservativeness of set theory. Let us grant that the concept of\nconservativeness has been formulated in some nominalistically\nacceptable way. If Field's proof were correct, he would have proved\nthat mathematics itself is conservative\u2014as long as one assumes\nthe usual reductions of mathematics to set theory. How does Field\nprove the conservativeness of set theory? It is by an ingenious\nargument, which adapts one of the Field's platonistic conservativeness\nproofs (Field 1980). For our present purposes, we need not examine the\ndetails of this argument, but simply note that at a crucial point the\ncompleteness of first-order logic is used to establish its conclusion\n(Field 1992, p. 118).\nThe problem with this move is that, even if mathematical\nfictionalists formulate the statement of the completeness theorem\nwithout referring to mathematical entities, the proof of this\ntheorem assumes set theory (see, for instance, Boolos and Jeffrey\n1989, pp. 131\u2013140). Therefore, fictionalists cannot use the\ntheorem without undermining their nominalism. After all, the point of\nproviding a nominalistic proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nis to show that, without recourse to platonist mathematics, the\nmathematical fictionalist is able to establish that mathematics is\nconservative. Field has offered a platonist argument for the\nconservativeness result (Field 1980)\u2014an argument that explicitly\ninvoked properties of set theory. The idea was to provide\na reductio of platonism: by using platonist mathematics,\nField attempted to establish that mathematics was conservative and,\nthus, ultimately dispensable. In contrast with the earlier strategy,\nthe goal was to provide a proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nthat a nominalist could accept. But since the nominalistic proof\nrelies on the completeness theorem, it is not at all clear that it is\nin fact nominalist. Mathematical fictionalists should first be able to\nprove the completeness result without assuming set\ntheory. Alternatively, they should provide a nominalization strategy\nfor set theory itself, which will then entitle them to use metalogical\nresults.\nBut it may be argued that the mathematical fictionalist only\nrequires the conservativeness of the set theory in which the\ncompleteness theorem is proved. It should now be clear that this reply\nis entirely question begging, since the point at issue is exactly\nto prove the conservativeness of set theory. Thus, the\nfictionalist cannot assume that this result is already established at\nthe metatheory.\nIn other words, without a broader nominalization strategy, which\nallows set theory itself to be nominalized, it seems difficult to see\nhow mathematical fictionalists can use metalogical results as part of\ntheir program. The problem, however, is that it is not at all obvious\nthat, at least in the form articulated by Field, the mathematical\nfictionalist program can be extended to set theory. For it only\nprovides a nominalization strategy for scientific theories,\nthat is, for the use of mathematics in science (e.g., in\nNewtonian gravitational theory). The approach doesn't address the\nnominalization of mathematics itself.\nIn principle, one may object, this shouldn't be a problem. After\nall, the mathematical fictionalists\u2019 motivation to develop their\napproach has focused on one issue: to overcome the indispensability\nargument\u2014thus addressing the use of mathematics\nin science. And the overall strategy, as noted, has been to\nprovide nominalist counterparts to relevant scientific theories.\nThe problem with this objection, however, is that given the nature\nof Field's strategy, the task of nominalizing science cannot be\nachieved without also nominalizing set theory. Thus, what is needed is\na more open-ended, broader nominalism: one that goes hand in hand not\nonly with science, but also with metalogic. As it stands, the\nmathematical fictionalist approach still leaves a considerable\ngap.\n3.3 Assessment: benefits and problems of mathematical fictionalism\n3.3.1 The epistemological problem\nGiven that mathematical objects do not exist, on the mathematical\nfictionalist perspective, the problem of how we can obtain knowledge\nof them simply vanishes. But another problem emerges instead: what is\nit that distinguishes a mathematician (who knows a lot about\nmathematics) and a non-mathematician (who does not have such\nknowledge)? The difference here (according to Field 1984) is not about\nhaving or lacking mathematical knowledge, but rather it is\nabout logical knowledge: of knowing which mathematical\ntheorems follow from certain mathematical principles, and which do\nnot. The epistemological problem is then solved\u2014as long as the\nmathematical fictionalist provides an epistemology\nfor logic.\nIn fact, what needs to be offered is ultimately an epistemology\nfor modality. After all, on Field's account, in order to\navoid the platonist commitment to models or proofs, the concept of\nlogical consequence is understood in terms of the primitive modal\nconcept of logical possibility: A follows logically\nfrom B as long as the conjunction of B and the negation\nof A is impossible, that is, \u00ac\u25ca(B \u2227\n\u00acA).\nHowever, how are such judgments of impossibility established? Under\nwhat conditions do we know that they hold? In simple cases, involving\nstraightforward statements, to establish such judgments may be\nunproblematic. The problem emerges when more substantive statements\nare invoked. In these cases, we seem to need a significant amount\nof mathematical information in order to be able to determine\nwhether the impossibilities in question really hold or not. Consider,\nfor instance, the difficulty of establishing the independence of the\naxiom of choice and the continuum hypotheses from the axioms of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Significantly complex mathematical models\nneed to be constructed in this case, which rely on the development of\nspecial mathematical techniques to build them. What is required from\nthe mathematical fictionalist at this stage is the nominalization of\nset theory itself\u2014something that, as we saw, Field still owes\nus.\n3.3.2 The problem of the application of mathematics\nSimilarly to the epistemological problem, the problem of the\napplication of mathematics is partially solved by the mathematical\nfictionalist. Field provides an account of the application of\nmathematics that does not require the truth of mathematical\ntheories. As we saw, this demands that mathematics be conservative in\nthe relevant sense. However, it is unclear whether Field has\nestablished the conservativeness of mathematics, given his restrictive\nway of introducing non-set-theoretic vocabulary into the axioms of set\ntheory as part of his attempted proof of the conservativeness of set\ntheory (Azzouni 2009b, p. 169, note 47; additional difficulties for\nthe mathematical fictionalist program can be found in Melia 1998,\n2000). Field was working with restricted ZFU, Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory with the axiom of choice modified to allow\nfor Urelemente, objects that are not sets, but not\nallowing for any non-set-theoretic vocabulary to appear in the\ncomprehension axioms, that is, replacement or separation (Field\n1980, p. 17). This is, however, a huge restriction, given that when\nmathematics is actually applied, non-set-theoretic vocabulary, when\ntranslated into set-theoretic language, will have to appear in the\ncomprehension axioms. As formulated by Field, the proof failed to\naddress the crucial case of actual applications of mathematics.\nMoreover, it is also unclear whether the nominalization program\nadvanced by the mathematical fictionalist can be extended to other\nscientific theories, such as quantum mechanics (Malament 1992). Mark\nBalaguer responded to this challenge by trying to nominalize quantum\nmechanics along mathematical fictionalist lines (Balaguer\n1998). However, as argued by Bueno (Bueno 2003), Balaguer's strategy\nis incompatible with a number of interpretations of quantum mechanics,\nin particular with Bas van Fraassen's version of the modal\ninterpretation (van Fraassen 1991). And given that Balaguer's strategy\ninvokes physically real propensities, it is unclear whether it is even\ncompatible with nominalism. As a result, the nominalization of quantum\nmechanics still remains a major problem for the mathematical\nfictionalist.\nBut even if these difficulties can all be addressed, it is unclear\nthat the mathematical fictionalist has offered an account of the\napplication of mathematics that allows us to make sense of how\nmathematical theories are actually applied. After all, the\nfictionalist account requires us to rewrite the relevant theories, by\nfinding suitable nominalistic versions for them. This leaves the issue\nof making sense of the actual process of the application of\nmathematics entirely untouched, given that no such reformulations are\never employed in actual scientific practice. Rather than engaging with\nactual features of the application process, the fictionalist creates a\nparallel discourse in an effort to provide a nominalist reconstruction\nof the use of mathematics in science. The reconstruction shows, at\nbest, that mathematical fictionalists need not worry about the\napplication of mathematics vis-\u00e0-vis increasing their\nontology. But the problem still remains of whether they are in a\nposition to make sense of the actual use of mathematics in\nscience. This problem, which is crucial for a proper\nunderstanding of mathematical practice, still remains.\nA similar difficulty also emerges for Balaguer's version of\nfictionalism (see the second half of Balaguer 1998). Balaguer relies\non the possibility of distinguishing between the mathematical and the\nphysical contents of an applied mathematical theory: in particular,\nthe truth of such a theory holds only in virtue of physical facts,\nwith no contribution from mathematics. It is, however, controversial\nwhether the distinction between mathematical and physical content can\nbe characterized without implementing a Field-like nominalization\nprogram. In this case, the same difficulties that the latter face also\ncarry over to Balaguer's account (Colyvan 2010; Azzouni 2011).\nMoreover, according to Azzouni (Azzouni 2009b), in order for\nscientists to use a scientific theory, they need to assert\nit. On his view, it is not enough for scientists simply to recognize\nthat a scientific theory is true (or exhibits some other theoretical\nvirtue). It is required that they assert the theory. In particular,\nscientists would then need to assert a nominalistic theory. They\ncannot simply contemplate such a theory; they need to be able to\nassert it as well (Azzouni 2009b, footnotes 31, 43, 53, and 55, and\np. 171). Thus, nominalists who grant this point to Azzouni need to\nshow that scientists are in a position to assert the relevant\nnominalistic theories in order to address the issue of the application\nof mathematics.\n3.3.3 Uniform semantics\nIn one respect, mathematical fictionalists offer a uniform\nsemantics for mathematical and scientific discourse, in another\nrespect, they don't. Initially, both types of discourse are assessed\nin the same way. Electrons and relations among them make certain\nquantum-mechanical statements true; in turn, mathematical objects and\nrelations among them make the corresponding mathematical\nstatements true. It just happens that, as opposed to electrons on a\nrealist interpretation of quantum mechanics, mathematical objects do\nnot exist. Hence, as noted, existential mathematical statements, such\nas \u2018there are infinitely many prime numbers\u2019, are\nfalse. Although the resulting truth-value assignments for existential\nstatements conflict with those found in mathematical practice, at\nleast the same semantics is offered for mathematical and scientific\nlanguages.\nIn an attempt to agree with the truth-value assignments that are\nusually displayed in mathematical discourse, the mathematical\nfictionalist introduces a fictional operator: \u2018According to\nmathematical theory M\u2026\u2019. Such an operator,\nhowever, changes the semantics of mathematical discourse. Applied to a\ntrue mathematical statement, at least one that the platonist\nrecognizes as true, the result will be a true statement\u2014even\naccording to the mathematical fictionalist. For instance, from both\nplatonist and fictionalist perspectives, the statement\n\u2018according to arithmetic, there are infinitely many prime\nnumbers\u2019 comes out true. But, in this case, the mathematical\nfictionalist can no longer offer a unified semantics for mathematical\nand scientific languages, given that the latter does not involve the\nintroduction of fictional operators. Thus, whether mathematical\nfictionalists are able to provide a uniform semantics ultimately\ndepends on whether fictional operators are introduced or not.\n3.3.4. Taking mathematics literally\nAn immediate consequence of the introduction of fiction operators\nis that mathematical discourse is no longer taken literally. As just\nnoted, without such operators, mathematical fictionalism produces\nnon-standard attributions of truth-values to mathematical\nstatements. But with fiction operators in place, the syntax of\nmathematical discourse is changed, and thus the latter cannot be taken\nliterally.\n3.3.5 The ontological problem\nThe ontological problem\u2014the problem of the acceptability of\nthe ontological commitments made by the mathematical\nfictionalist\u2014is basically solved. No commitment to mathematical\nobjects is, in principle, made. Although a primitive modal notion is\nintroduced, it has only a limited role in the nominalization of\nmathematics: to allow for a nominalist formulation of the crucial\nconcept of conservativeness. As we saw, however, without a proper\nnominalization of set theory itself, it is unclear whether the\nmathematical fictionalist program ultimately succeeds.\n\n4. Modal Structuralism\n4.1 Central features of modal structuralism\nModal structuralism offers a program of interpretation of\nmathematics which incorporates two features: (a) an emphasis on\nstructures as the main subject-matter of mathematics, and (b) a\ncomplete elimination of reference to mathematical objects by\ninterpreting mathematics in terms of modal logic (as first\nsuggested by Putnam (1967), and developed in Hellman (1989,\n1996)). Given these features, the resulting approach is called\na modal-structural interpretation (Hellman 1989,\npp. vii\u2013viii and 6\u20139).\nThe proposal is also supposed to meet two important requirements\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 2\u20136). The first is that mathematical\nstatements should have truth-values, and thus\n\u2018instrumentalist\u2019 readings are rejected from the\noutset. The second is that: \u2018a reasonable account should be\nforthcoming of how mathematics does in fact apply to the material\nworld\u2019 (Hellman 1989, p. 6). Thus, the applicability problem\nmust be examined.\nIn order to address these issues, the modal structuralist puts\nforward a general framework. The main idea is that although\nmathematics is concerned with the study of structures, this study can\nbe accomplished by focusing only on possible structures, and\nnot actual ones. Thus, the modal interpretation is not committed to\nactual mathematical structures; there is no commitment to their\nexistence as objects or to any objects that happen to\n\u2018constitute\u2019 these structures. In this way, the\nontological commitment to them is avoided: the only claim is that the\nstructures in question are possible. In order to articulate\nthis point, the modal-structural interpretation is formulated in a\nsecond-order modal language based on S5. However, to prevent\ncommitment to a set-theoretical characterization of the modal\noperators, Hellman takes these operators as primitive (1989, pp. 17,\nand 20\u201323).\nTwo steps are taken. The first is to present an appropriate\ntranslation scheme in terms of which each ordinary mathematical\nstatement S is taken as elliptical for a hypothetical\nstatement, namely: that S would hold in a structure of\nthe appropriate kind.\nFor example, if we are considering number-theoretic statements,\nsuch as those articulated in Peano arithmetic (PA, for short), the\nstructures we are concerned with are \u2018progressions\u2019 or\n\u2018\u03c9-sequences\u2019 satisfying PA's axioms. In this case,\neach particular statement S is to be (roughly) translated\nas\n\n\u2610\u2200X(X is an \u03c9-sequence\n  satisfying PA's axioms \u2192 S holds in X).\n\nAccording to this statement, if there were \u03c9-sequences\nsatisfying PA's axioms, S would hold in them. This is\nthe hypothetical component of the modal-structural\ninterpretation (for a detailed analysis and a precise formulation, see\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 16\u201324)). The categorical component\nconstitutes the second step (Helman 1989, pp. 24\u201333). The idea\nis to assume that the structures of the appropriate kind are logically\npossible. In that case, we have that\n\n\u25ca\u2203X(X is an \u03c9-sequence satisfying\n  PA's axioms).\n\nThat is, it is logically possible that there are \u03c9-sequences\nsatisfying PA's axioms. Following this approach, truth preserving\ntranslations of mathematical statements can be presented without\nontological costs, given that only the possibility of the\nstructures in question is assumed.\nThe modal structuralist then indicates that the practice of theorem\nproving can be regained in this framework (roughly speaking, by\napplying the translation scheme to each line of the original proof of\nthe theorem under consideration). Moreover, by using the translation\nscheme and appropriate coding devices, one can argue that arithmetic,\nreal analysis and, to a certain extent, even set theory are recovered\nin a nominalist setting (Hellman 1989, pp. 16\u201333, 44\u201347,\nand 53\u201393). In particular, \u2018by making use of coding\ndevices, virtually all the mathematics commonly encountered in current\nphysical theories can be carried out within [real analysis]\u2019\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 45\u201346). However, the issue of whether set\ntheory has been nominalized in this way is, in fact,\nproblematic\u2014as the modal structuralist grants. After all, it is\nno obvious matter to establish even the possibility of the existence\nof structures with inaccessibly many objects.\nWith the framework in place, the modal structuralist can then\nconsider the applicability problem. The main idea is to adopt the\nhypothetical component as the basis for accommodating the application\nof mathematics. The relevant structures are those commonly used in\nparticular branches of science. Two considerations need to be made at\nthis point.\nThe first is the general form of applied mathematical statements\n(Hellman 1989, pp. 118\u2013124). These statements involve three\ncrucial components: the structures that are used in applied\nmathematics, the non-mathematical objects to which the mathematical\nstructures are applied, and a statement of application that specifies\nthe particular relations between the mathematical structures and the\nnon-mathematical objects. The relevant mathematical structures can be\nformulated in set theory. Let us call the set theory used in applied\ncontexts Z. (This is second-order Zermelo set theory, which is\nfinitely axiomatizable; I'll denote the conjunction of the axioms\nof Z by \u2227Z.) The non-mathematical objects of\ninterest in the context of application can be expressed in Z\nas Urelemente, that is, as objects that are not sets. We will\ntake \u2018U\u2019 to be the statement that certain\nnon-mathematical objects of interest are included\nas Urelemente in the structures of Z. Finally,\n\u2018A\u2019 is the statement of application, describing the\nparticular relations between the relevant mathematical structures\nof Z and the non-mathematical objects described\nin U. The particular relations involved depend on the case in\nquestion. We can now present the general form of an applied\nmathematical statement (Hellman 1989, p. 119):\n\n\u2610\u2200X\u2200f ((\u2227Z\n  & U)X (\u2208f)\n  \u2192 A).\n\nIn the antecedent \u2018(\u2227Z\n& U)X (\u2208f)\u2019\nis an abbreviation for the results from writing out the axioms of\nZermelo set theory with all quantifiers relativized to the second\norder variable X, replacing each occurrence of the membership\nsymbol \u2018\u2208\u2019 with the two place relation variable\n\u2018f\u2019. According to the applied mathematical\nstatement, if there were structures satisfying the conjunction of the\naxioms of Zermelo set theory Z including some non-mathematical\nobjects referred to in U, A would hold in such\nstructures. The application statement A expresses the relations\nin questions, such as an isomorphism or a homomorphism between a\nphysical system and certain set theoretic structures. This is the\nhypothetical component interpreted to express which relations would\nhold between certain mathematical structures (formulated as structures\nof \u2227Z) and the entities studied in the world\n(the Urelemente).\nThe second consideration examines in more detail the relationships\nbetween the physical (or the material) objects studied and the\nmathematical framework. These are the \u201csynthetic\ndetermination\u201d relations (Hellman 1989, pp. 124\u2013135). More\nspecifically, we have to determine which relations among\nnon-mathematical objects can be taken, in the antecedent of an applied\nmathematical statement, as the basis for specifying \u201cthe actual\nmaterial situation\u201d (Hellman 1989, p. 129). The modal\nstructuralist proposal is to consider the models of a comprehensive\ntheory T\u2032. This theory embraces and links the vocabulary\nof the applied mathematical theory (T) and the\nsynthetic vocabulary (S) in question, which intuitively fixes\nthe actual material situation. It is assumed that T determines,\nup to isomorphism, a particular kind of mathematical structure\n(containing, for example, Z), and that T\u2032 is an\nextension of T. In that case, a proposed \u201csynthetic\nbasis\u201d will be adequate if the following condition holds:\n\nLet a be the class of (mathematically) standard models\n  of T\u2032, and let V denote the full vocabulary\n  of T\u2032: then S determines V in a\n  iff for any two models m and m\u2032 in a, and\n  any bijection f between their domains, if f is\n  an S isomorphism, it is also a V isomorphism. (Hellman\n  1989, p. 132.)\n\nThe introduction of isomorphism in this context comes, of course,\nfrom the need to accommodate the preservation of structure between the\n(applied) mathematical part of the domain under study and the\nnon-mathematical part. This holds in the crucial case in which the\npreservation of the synthetic properties and relations\n(S-isomorphism) by f leads to the preservation of the\nanalytic applied mathematical relations (V-isomorphism) of the\noverall theory T\u2032. It should be noted that the\n\u2018synthetic\u2019 structure is not meant to\n\u2018capture\u2019 the full structure of the mathematical\ntheory in question, but only its applied part. (Recall that\nHellman started with an applied mathematical\ntheory T.)\nThis can be illustrated with a simple example. Suppose that\nfinitely many physical objects display a linear order. We can describe\nthis by defining a function from those objects to an initial segment\nof the natural numbers. What is required by the modal structuralist's\nsynthetic determination condition is that the physical ordering among\nthe objects alone captures this function and the description it offers\nof the objects. It is not claimed that the full\nnatural number structure is thus captured. This example also provides\nan illustration of the applied mathematical statement mentioned\nabove. The Urelemente (objects that are not sets) are the\nphysical objects in question, the relevant mathematical relation is\nisomorphism, and the mathematical structure is a segment of natural\nnumbers with their usual linear order.\nOn the modal structural conception, mathematics is applied by\nestablishing an appropriate isomorphism between (parts of)\nmathematical structures and those structures that represent the\nmaterial situation. This procedure is justified, since such\nisomorphism establishes the structural equivalence between the\n(relevant parts of the) mathematical and the non-mathematical\nlevels.\nHowever, this proposal faces two difficulties. The first concerns\nthe ontological status of the structural equivalence between the\n(applied) mathematical and the non-mathematical domains. On what\ngrounds can we claim that the structures under consideration are\nmathematically the same if some of them concern \u2018material\u2019\nobjects? Of course, given that the structural equivalence is\nestablished by an isomorphism the material objects are already\nformulated in structural terms\u2014this means that some mathematics\nhas already been applied to the domain in question. In other words, in\norder to be able to represent the applicability of mathematics,\nHellman assumes that some mathematics has already been applied. This\nmeans that a purely mathematical characterization of the applicability\nof mathematics (via structure preservation) is inherently\nincomplete. The first step in the application, namely the\nmathematical modeling of the material domain, is not, and cannot, be\naccommodated, since no isomorphism is involved there. Indeed, given\nthat by hypothesis the domain is not articulated in\nmathematical terms, no isomorphism is defined there.\nIt may be argued that the modal structural account does not require\nan isomorphism between (applied) mathematical structures and those\ndescribing the material situation. The account only requires an\nisomorphism between two standard models of the overall\ntheory T\u2032, which links the mathematical theory T\nand the description S of the material domain. In reply, note\nthat this only moves the difficulty one level up. In order\nfor T\u2032 to extend the applied mathematical theory T\nand to provide a link between T and the material situation, a\nmodel of T\u2032 will have to be, in particular, a model of\nboth T and S. Thus, if the modal structuralist's\nsynthetic determination claim is satisfied, an isomorphism between two\nmodels of T\u2032 will determine an isomorphism between the\nmodels of S and those of T. In this way, an isomorphism\nbetween structures describing the material situation and those arising\nfrom applied mathematics is still required.\nThe second difficulty addresses the epistemological status of the\nclaim that there is a structural equivalence between the mathematical\nand the non-mathematical domains. On what grounds do we know\nthat such equivalence holds? Someone may say that the equivalence is\nnormatively imposed in order for the application process to get off\nthe ground. But this suggestion leads to a dilemma. Either it is just\nassumed that we know that the equivalence holds, and the\nepistemological question is begged (given that the grounds for this\nare in question), or it is assumed that we do not know that\nthe equivalence holds\u2014and that is why we have to impose\nthe condition\u2014in which case the latter is clearly\ngroundless. However, it may be argued that there is no problem here,\nsince we establish the isomorphism by examining the physical theories\nof the material objects under consideration. But the problem is that\nin order to formulate these physical theories we typically use\nmathematics. And the issue is precisely to explain this use, that is,\nto provide some understanding of the grounds in terms of which we come\nto know that the relevant mathematical structures are isomorphic to\nthe physical ones.\nThe main point underlying these considerations has been stressed\noften enough (although in a different context): isomorphism does not\nseem to be an appropriate condition for capturing the relation between\nmathematical structures and the world (see, e.g., da Costa and French\n2003). There is, of course, a correct intuition underlying the use of\nisomorphism at this level, and this relates to the idea of justifying\nthe application of mathematics: the isomorphism does guarantee that\napplied mathematical structures S and the structures M\nwhich represent the material situation are mathematically the\nsame. The problem is that isomorphism-based characterizations tend to\nbe unrealistically strong. They require that some mathematics has\nalready been applied to the material situation, and that we have\nknowledge of the structural equivalence between S\nand M. What is needed is a framework in which the relation\nbetween the relevant structures is weaker than isomorphism, but which\nstill supports the applicability, albeit in a less demanding way\n(e.g., Bueno, French and Ladyman 2002).\n4.2 Assessment: benefits and problems of modal structuralism\n4.2.1 The epistemological problem\nThe modal structuralist solves partially the epistemological\nproblem for mathematics. Assuming that the modal-structural\ntranslation scheme works for set theory, modal structuralists need not\nexplain how we can have knowledge of the existence of mathematical\nobjects, relations or structures\u2014given the lack of commitment to\nthese entities. However, they still need to explain our knowledge of\nthe possibility of the relevant structures, since the translation\nscheme commits them to such possibility.\nOne worry that emerges here is that, in the case of substantive\nmathematical structures (such as those invoked in set theory),\nknowledge of the possibility of such structures may require knowledge\nof substantial parts of mathematics. For instance, in order to know\nthat the structures formulated in Zermelo set theory are possible,\npresumably we need to know that the theory itself is consistent. But\nthe consistency of the theory can only be established in another\ntheory, whose consistency, in turn, also needs to be\nestablished\u2014and we face a regress. It would be arbitrary simply\nto assume the consistency of the theories in question, given that if\nsuch theories turn out to be in fact inconsistent, given classical\nlogic, everything could be proved in them.\nOf course, these considerations do not establish that the modal\nstructuralist cannot develop an epistemology for mathematics. They\njust suggest that further developments on the epistemological front\nseem to be called for in order to address more fully the\nepistemological problem for mathematics.\n4.2.2 The problem of the application of mathematics\nSimilarly, the problem of the application of mathematics is\npartially solved by the modal structuralist. After all, a framework to\ninterpret the use of mathematics in science is provided, and in terms\nof this framework the application of mathematics can be accommodated\nwithout the commitment to the existence of the corresponding\nobjects.\nOne concern that emerges (besides those already mentioned at the\nend of section 4.1 above) is that, similarly to what happens to\nmathematical fictionalism, the proposed framework does not allow us to\nmake sense of actual uses of the application of mathematics. Rather\nthan explaining how mathematics is in fact applied in scientific\npractice, the modal-structural framework is advanced in order to\nregiment that practice and dispense with the commitment to\nmathematical entities. But even if the framework succeeds at the\nlatter task, thus allowing the modal structuralist to avoid the\nrelevant commitment, the issue of how to make sense of the way\nmathematics is actually used in scientific contexts still\nremains. Providing a translation scheme into a nominalistic language\ndoes not address this issue. A significant aspect of mathematical\npractice is then left unaccounted for.\nThe status of the indispensability argument within the\nmodal-structural interpretation is quite unique. On the one hand, the\nconclusion of the argument is undermined (if the proposed translation\nscheme goes through), since commitment to the existence of\nmathematical objects can be avoided. On the other hand, a revised\nversion of the indispensability argument can be used to motivate the\ntranslation into the modal language, thus emphasizing the\nindispensable role played by the primitive modal notions introduced by\nthe modal structuralist. The idea is to change the argument's second\npremise, insisting that modal-structural translations of\nmathematical theories are indispensable to our best theories of the\nworld, and concluding that we ought to be ontologically committed to\nthe possibility of the corresponding structures. In this sense, modal\nstructuralists can invoke the indispensability argument in support of\nthe translation scheme they favor and, hence, the possibility of the\nrelevant structures, which are referred to in the conclusion of the\nrevised argument. But rather than supporting the existence of\nmathematical objects, the argument would only support commitment to\nmodal-structural translations of mathematical theories and the\npossibility of mathematical structures.\n4.2.3 Uniform semantics\nWith the introduction of modal operators and the proposed\ntranslation scheme, the modal structuralist is unable to provide a\nuniform semantics for scientific and mathematical theories. Only the\nlatter, as opposed to the former, requires such operators. In fact,\nField has argued that if modal operators were invoked in the\nformulation of scientific theories, not only their mathematical\ncontent, but also their physical content would be nominalized (Field\n1989). After all, in that case, instead of asserting that some\nphysical situation is actually the case, the theory would only state\nthe possibility that this is so.\nOne strategy to avoid this difficulty (of losing the physical\ncontent of a scientific theory due to the use of modal operators) is\nto employ an actuality operator. By properly placing this operator\nwithin the scope of the modal operators, it is possible to undo the\nnominalization of the physical content in question (Friedman\n2005). Without the introduction of the actuality operator, or some\nrelated maneuver, it is unclear that the modal structuralist would be\nin a position to preserve the physical content of the scientific\ntheory in question.\nBut the introduction of an actuality operator in this context\nrequires the distinction between nominalist and mathematical\ncontent. (That such a distinction cannot be drawn at all is argued in\nAzzouni 2011.) Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the application\nof the actuality operator will not yield more than what is physically\nreal.\nHowever, even with the introduction of such an operator, there\nwould still be a significant difference, on the modal-structural\ntranslation scheme, between the semantics for mathematical and\nscientific discourse. For the former, as opposed to the latter, does\nnot invoke such an operator. The result is that modal structuralism\ndoes not seem to be able to provide a uniform semantics for\nmathematical and scientific language.\n4.2.4 Taking mathematics literally\nGiven the need for introducing modal operators, the modal\nstructuralist does not take mathematical discourse literally. In fact,\nit may be argued, this is the whole point of the view! Taken\nliterally, mathematical discourse seems to be committed to abstract\nobjects and structures\u2014a commitment that the modal structuralist\nclearly aims to avoid.\nHowever, the point still stands that, in order to block such\ncommitment, a parallel discourse to actual mathematical practice is\noffered. The discourse is \u2018parallel\u2019 given that\nmathematical practice typically does not invoke the modal operators\nintroduced by the modal structuralist. For those who aim to understand\nmathematical discourse as it is used in the practice of mathematics,\nand who try to identify suitable features of that practice that\nprevent commitment to mathematical entities, the proposed translation\nwill make the realization of that goal particularly difficult.\n4.2.5 The ontological problem\nThe modal structuralist has solved, in part, the ontological\nproblem. No commitment to mathematical objects or structures seems to\nbe needed to implement the proposed translation scheme. The main\nconcern emerges from the introduction of modal operators. But as the\nmodal structuralist emphasizes, these operators do not presuppose a\npossible-worlds semantics: they are introduced as primitive terms.\nHowever, since the modal translation of mathematical axioms is\ntaken to be true, the question arises as to what makes such\nstatements true. For instance, when it is asserted that\n\u2018it is possible that there are structures satisfying the axioms\nof Peano Arithmetic\u2019, what is responsible for the truth of such\nstatement? Clearly, the modal structuralist will not ground the\npossibility in question on the actual truth of the Peano axioms, for\nthis move, on a reasonable interpretation, would require\nplatonism. Nor will the modal structuralist support the relevant\npossibility on the basis of the existence of a consistency proof for\nthe Peano axioms. After all, any such proof is an abstract object, and\nto invoke it at the foundation of modal structuralism clearly\nthreatens the coherence of the overall view. Furthermore, to invoke a\nmodalized version of such a consistency proof would beg the question,\nsince it assumes that the use of modal operators is already\njustified. Ultimately, what is needed to solve properly the\nontological problem is a suitable account of modal discourse.\n\n5. Deflationary Nominalism\n5.1 Central features of deflationary nominalism\nAccording to the deflationary nominalist, it is perfectly\nconsistent to insist that mathematical theories are indispensable to\nscience, to assert that mathematical and scientific theories are true,\nand to deny that mathematical objects exist. I am calling the view\n\u2018deflationary nominalism\u2019 given that it demands very\nminimal commitments to make sense of mathematics (Azzouni 2004), it\nadvances a deflationary view of truth (Azzouni 2004, 2006), and\nadvocates a direct formulation of mathematical theories, without\nrequiring that they be reconstructed or rewritten (Azzouni 1994,\n2004).\nDeflationary nominalism offers an \u2018easy road\u2019 to\nnominalism, which does not require any form of reformulation of\nmathematical discourse, while granting the indispensability of\nmathematics. Despite the fact that quantification over mathematical\nobjects and relations is indispensable to our best theories of the\nworld, this fact offers no reason to believe in the existence of the\ncorresponding entities. This is because, as Jody Azzouni points out,\ntwo kinds of commitment should be distinguished: quantifier\ncommitment and ontological commitment (Azzouni 1997; 2004,\np. 127 and pp. 49\u2013122). We incur a quantifier commitment\nwhenever our theories imply existentially quantified statements. But\nexistential quantification, Azzouni insists, is not sufficient for\nontological commitment. After all, we often quantify over objects we\nhave no reason to believe exist, such as fictional entities.\nTo incur an ontological commitment\u2014that is, to be\ncommitted to the existence of a given object\u2014a criterion for\nwhat exists needs to be satisfied. There are, of course, various\npossible criteria for what exists (such as causal efficacy,\nobservability, possibility of detection, and so on). But the criterion\nAzzouni favors, and he takes it to be the one that has been\ncollectively adopted, is ontological independence (2004, p. 99). What\nexist are the things that are ontologically independent of our\nlinguistic practices and psychological processes. The point is that if\nwe have just made something up through our linguistic practices or\npsychological processes, there's no need for us to be committed to the\nexistence of the corresponding object. And typically, we would resist\nany such commitment.\nDo psychological processes themselves exist, according to the\nontologically independence criterion? It may be argued that most\npsychological processes do exist, at least those we undergo rather\nthan those we make up. After all, the motivation underlying the\nindependence criterion is that those things we just made up verbally\nor psychologically do not exist. Having a headache or believing that\nthere is a laptop computer in front of me now are psychological\nprocesses that I did not make up. Therefore, it seems that at least\nthese kinds of psychological processes do exist. In contrast,\nimaginings, desires, and hopes are processes we make up, and thus they\ndo not exist. However, the underlying motivation for the criterion\nseems to diverge, in these cases, from what is entailed by the\ncriterion's actual formulation. For the criterion insists on the\nontological independence of \u201cour linguistic practices and\npsychological processes\u201d. Since headaches and beliefs are\npsychological processes themselves, presumably they are not\nontologically independent of psychological processes. Hence, they do\nnot exist. This means that if the criterion is applied as stated, no\npsychological process exists. For similar reasons, novels, mental\ncontents, and institutions do not exist either, since they are all\nabstract objects dependent on our linguistic practices and\npsychological processes, according to the deflationary nominalist\n(Azzouni 2010a, 2012).\nQuine, of course, identifies quantifier and ontological\ncommitments, at least in the crucial case of the objects that are\nindispensable to our best theories of the world. Such objects are\nthose that cannot be eliminated through paraphrase and over which we\nhave to quantify when we regiment the relevant theories (using\nfirst-order logic). According to Quine's criterion, these are\nprecisely the objects we are ontologically committed to. Azzouni\ninsists that we should resist this identification. Even if the objects\nin our best theories are indispensable, even if we quantify over them,\nthis is not sufficient for us to be ontologically committed to\nthem. After all, the objects we quantify over might be\nontologically dependent on us\u2014on our linguistic\npractices or psychological processes\u2014and thus we might have just\nmade them up. But, in this case, clearly there is no reason to be\ncommitted to their existence. However, for those objects\nthat are ontologically independent of us, we are\ncommitted to their existence.\nAs it turns out, on Azzouni's view, mathematical objects are\nontologically dependent on our linguistic practices and psychological\nprocesses. And so, even though they may be indispensable to our best\ntheories of the world, we are not ontologically committed to\nthem. Hence, deflationary nominalism is indeed a form of\nnominalism.\nBut in what sense do mathematical objects depend on our linguistic\npractices and psychological processes? In the sense that the sheer\npostulation of certain principles is enough for mathematical practice:\n\u2018A mathematical subject with its accompanying posits can be\ncreated ex nihilo by simply writing down a set of axioms\u2019\n(Azzouni 2004, p. 127). The only additional constraint that sheer\npostulation has to meet, in practice, is that mathematicians should\nfind the resulting mathematics interesting. That is, the consequences\nthat follow from the relevant mathematical principles shouldn't be\nobvious, and they should be computationally tractable. Thus, given\nthat sheer postulation is (basically) enough in mathematics,\nmathematical objects have no epistemic burdens. Such objects, or\n\u2018posits\u2019, are called ultrathin (Azzouni 2004,\np. 127).\nThe same move that the deflationary nominalist makes to distinguish\nontological commitment from quantifier commitment is also used to\ndistinguish ontological commitment to Fs from asserting\nthe truth of \u2018There are Fs\u2019. Although\nmathematical theories used in science are (taken to be) true, this is\nnot sufficient to commit us to the existence of the objects these\ntheories are supposedly about. After all, according to the\ndeflationary nominalist, it may be true that there\nare Fs, but to be ontologically committed to Fs, a\ncriterion for what exists needs to be satisfied. As Azzouni points\nout:\n\nI take true mathematical statements as literally true; I\n  forgo attempts to show that such literally true mathematical\n  statements are not indispensable to empirical science, and\n  yet, nonetheless, I can describe mathematical terms as referring to\n  nothing at all. Without Quine's criterion to corrupt them,\n  existential statements are innocent of ontology. (Azzouni 2004,\n  pp. 4\u20135.)\n\nOn the deflationary nominalist picture, ontological commitment is\nnot signaled in any special way in natural (or even formal)\nlanguage. We just don't read off the ontological commitment of\nscientific doctrines (even if they were suitably regimented). After\nall, without Quine's criterion of ontological commitment, neither\nquantification over a given object (in a first-order language) nor\nformulation of true claims about such an object entails the existence\nof the latter.\nIn his 1994 book, Azzouni did not commit himself to nominalism, on\nthe grounds that nominalists typically require a reconstruction of\nmathematical language\u2014something that, as discussed above, is\nindeed the case with both mathematical fictionalism (Field 1989) and\nmodal structuralism (Hellman 1989). However, no such reconstruction\nwas implemented, or needed, in the proposal advanced by Azzouni\n(Azzouni 1994). The fact that mathematical objects play no role in how\nmathematical truths are known clearly expresses a nominalist\nattitude\u2014an attitude that Azzouni explicitly endorsed in\n(Azzouni 2004).\nThe deflationary nominalist proposal nicely expresses a view that\nshould be taken seriously. And as opposed to other versions of\nnominalism, it has the significant benefit of aiming to take\nmathematical discourse literally.\n5.2 Assessment: benefits of deflationary nominalism and a problem\nOf the nominalist views discussed in this essay, deflationary\nnominalism is the view that comes closest to solving (or, in some\ncases, dissolving) the five problems that have been used to assess\nnominalist proposals. With the possible exceptions of the issue of\ntaking mathematical language literally and the ontological problem,\nall of the remaining problems are explicitly and successfully\naddressed. I will discuss each of them in turn.\n5.2.1 The epistemological problem dissolved\nHow can the deflationary nominalist explain the possibility of\nmathematical knowledge, given the abstract nature of mathematical\nobjects? On this version of nominalism, this problem\nvanishes. Mathematical knowledge is ultimately obtained from what\nfollows from mathematical principles. Given that mathematical objects\ndo not exist, they play no role in how mathematical results are known\n(Azzouni 1994). What is required is that the relevant mathematical\nresult be established via a proof. Proofs are the source of\nmathematical knowledge.\nIt might be argued that certain mathematical statements are known\nwithout the corresponding proof. Consider the G\u00f6del sentence\ninvoked in the proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem: the\nsentence is true, but it cannot be proved in the system under\nconsideration (if the latter is consistent). Do we have knowledge of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence? Clearly we do, despite the fact that the\nsentence is not derivable in the system in question. As a result, the\nknowledge involved here is of a different sort than the one\narticulated in terms of what can be proved in a given system.\nIn my view, the deflationary nominalist has no problem making sense\nof our knowledge of the G\u00f6del sentence. It is an intuitive sort\nof knowledge, which emerges from what the sentence in question\nstates. All that is required in order to know that the sentence is\ntrue is to properly understand it. But that's not how mathematical\nresults are typically established: they need to be proved.\nAccording to Azzouni, we know the G\u00f6del sentence as long as we\nare able to embed the syntactically incomplete system (such as Peano\narithmetic) in a stronger system in which the truth predicate for the\noriginal system occurs and in which the G\u00f6del sentence is proved\n(Azzouni 1994, pp. 134\u2013135; Azzouni 2006, p. 89, note 38, last\nparagraph, and pp. 161\u2013162).\nClearly, the account does not turn mathematical knowledge into\nsomething easy to obtain, given that, normally, it is no\nstraightforward matter to determine whether some result follows from a\ngiven group of axioms. Part of the difficulty emerges from the fact\nthat the logical consequences of a non-trivial group of axioms are\noften not transparent: significant work is required to establish such\nconsequences. This is as it should be, given the non-trivial nature of\nmathematical knowledge.\n5.2.2 Dissolving the problem of the application of mathematics\nThe deflationary nominalist offers various considerations to the\neffect that there is no genuine philosophical problem in the success\nof applied mathematics (Azzouni 2000). Once particular attention is\ngiven to implicational opacity\u2014our inability to see, before a\nproof is offered, the consequences of various mathematical\nstatements\u2014much of the alleged surprise in the successful\napplication of mathematics should vanish. Ultimately, the so-called\nproblem of the application of mathematics\u2014of understanding how\nit is possible that mathematics can be successfully applied to the\nphysical world should\u2014is an artificially designed issue rather\nthan a genuine problem.\nColyvan defends the opposing view (Colyvan 2001b), insisting that\nthe application of mathematics to science does present a genuine\nproblem. In particular, he argues that two major philosophical\naccounts of mathematics, Field's mathematical fictionalism and Quine's\nplatonist realism, are unable to explain the problem. Thus, he\nconcludes that the problem cuts across the realism/anti-realism debate\nin the philosophy of mathematics. The deflationary nominalist would\ninsist that what is ultimately at issue\u2014implicational\nopacity\u2014is not a special problem, even though to the extent that\nit is a problem, it is one that is equally faced by realists and\nanti-realists about mathematics.\nThis does not mean that the application of mathematics is a\nstraightforward matter. Clearly, it is not. But the difficulties\ninvolved in the successful application of mathematics do not raise a\nspecial philosophical problem, particularly as soon as the issue of\nimplicational opacity is acknowledged\u2014an issue that is common to\nboth pure and applied mathematics.\nThe issue of understanding the way in which mathematics in fact\ngets applied is something that the deflationary nominalist explicitly\naddresses, carefully examining the central features and the\nlimitations of different models of the application of mathematics\n(see, in particular, the second part of (Azzouni 2004)).\n5.2.3 Uniform semantics\nThe deflationary nominalist, as noted above, is not committed to\noffering a reconstruction, or any kind of reformulation, of\nmathematical theories. (The exception here is the case of inconsistent\nmathematical or scientific theories, which according to the\ndeflationary nominalist, ideally are regimented as consistent\nfirst-order theories.) No special semantics is required to make sense\nof mathematics: the same semantics that is used in the case of\nscientific theories is invoked for mathematical theories. It may seem\nthat the uniform semantics requirement is thus satisfied. But the\nsituation is more complicated.\nIt may be argued that the deflationary nominalist needs to provide\nthe semantics for the existential and universal claims in mathematics,\nscience and ordinary language. After all, it does sound puzzling to\nstate: \u201cIt is true that there are numbers, but numbers do not\nexist\u201d. What is such semantics? The deflationary nominalist will\nrespond by noting that this semantics is precisely the standard\nsemantics of classical logic, with the familiar conditions for the\nexistential and universal quantifiers, but without the assumption that\nsuch quantifiers are ontologically committing. The fact that no\nontological import is assigned to the quantifiers does not change\ntheir semantics. After all, the metalanguage in which the semantics is\ndeveloped already has universal and existential quantifiers, and these\nquantifiers need not be interpreted as providing ontological\ncommitment any more than the object language quantifiers do. As a\nresult, the same semantics is used throughout.\nIt may be argued that the deflationary nominalist needs to\nintroduce the distinction between ontologically serious (or\nontologically committing) uses of the quantifiers and ontologically\ninnocent (or ontologically non-committing) uses. If so, this would\npresumably require a different semantics for these quantifiers. In\nresponse, the deflationary nominalist will deny the need for such\ndistinction. In order to mark ontological commitment, an existence\npredicate, which expresses ontological independence, is used. Those\nthings that are ontologically independent of us (that is, of our\nlinguistic practices and psychological processes) are those to which\nwe are ontologically committed. The mark of ontological commitment is\nnot made at the level of the quantifiers, but via the existence\npredicate.\nThis means, however, that even though the semantics is uniform\nthroughout the sciences, mathematics and ordinary language,\ndeflationary nominalism requires the introduction of the existence\npredicate. But, at least on the surface, this predicate does not seem\nto have a counterpart in the way language is used in these domains. It\nis the same semantics throughout, but the formalization of the\ndiscourse requires an extended language to accommodate the existence\npredicate. As a result, the uniformity of the semantics comes with the\ncost of the introduction of a special predicate into the language to\nmark ontological commitment for formalization.\nPerhaps the deflationary nominalist will respond by arguing that\nthe existence predicate is already part of the language, maybe\nimplicitly via contextual and rhetorical factors (Azzouni 2007,\nSection III; Azzouni 2004, Chapter 5). What would be needed then is\nevidence for such a claim, and an indication of how exactly the\npredicate is in fact found in scientific, mathematical and ordinary\ncontexts. Consider, for instance, the sentences:\n\n(S) There is no set of all sets.\n(P) Perfectly frictionless planes do not exist.\n(M) Mice exist; talking mice don't.\n\nPresumably, in all of these cases the existence predicate is\nused. As a result, the sentences could be formalized as follows:\n\n(S) \u2200x(Sx \u2192\n  \u00acEx), where \u2018S\u2019 is (for\n  simplicity) the predicate \u2018set of all sets\u2019, and\n  \u2018E\u2019 is the existence predicate.\n(P) \u2200x(Px \u2192\n  \u00acEx), where \u2018P\u2019 is (for\n  simplicity) the predicate \u2018perfectly frictionless\n  plane\u2019, and \u2018E\u2019 is the existence\n  predicate.\n(M) \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ex)\n  \u2227 \u2200x((Mx \u2227 Tx)\n  \u2192 \u00acEx), where \u2018M\u2019 is the\n  predicate \u2018mice\u2019, \u2018T\u2019 is the\n  predicate \u2018to talk\u2019, and \u2018E\u2019 is the\n  existence predicate.\n\nIn all of these cases, the formalization requires some change in\nthe logical form of the natural language sentences in order to\nintroduce the existence predicate. And that is arguably a cost for the\nview. After all, in these cases, mathematical, scientific and ordinary\nlanguages do not seem to be taken literally\u2014a topic to which I\nturn now.\n5.2.4 Taking mathematical language literally\nWe saw that with the introduction of the existence predicate it is\nnot clear that the deflationary nominalist is in fact able to take\nmathematical language literally. After all, some reconstruction of\nthat language seems to be needed. It should be granted that the level\nof reconstruction involved is significantly less than what is found in\nthe other versions of nominalism discussed above. As opposed to them,\nthe deflationary nominalist is able to accommodate significant aspects\nof mathematical practice without the need for creating a full parallel\ndiscourse (in particular, no operators, modal or fictional, need to be\nintroduced). However, some level of reconstruction is still needed to\naccommodate the existence predicate, which then compromises the\ndeflationary nominalist's capacity to take mathematical language\nliterally.\nA related concern is that the deflationary nominalist introduces a\nnon-standard notion of reference that does not presuppose the\nexistence of the objects that are referred to (Bueno and Zalta\n2005). This move goes hand in hand with the understanding of the\nquantifiers as not being ontologically committing, and it does seem to\nlimit the deflationary nominalist's capacity to take mathematical\nlanguage literally. After all, a special use of \u2018refers\u2019\nis needed to accommodate the claim that \u201c\u2018a\u2019\nrefers to b, but b does not exist\u201d. The\ndeflationary nominalist, however, resists this charge (Azzouni 2009a,\n2010a, 2010b).\n5.2.5 The ontological problem\nThe ontological problem is also dissolved by the deflationary\nnominalism. Clearly, deflationary nominalism has no commitment either\nto mathematical objects or to a modal ontology of any kind (including\npossible worlds, abstract entities as proxy for possible worlds, or\nother forms of replacement for the expression of modal claims). The\ndeflationary nominalists not only avoid the commitment to mathematical\nobjects, they also claim that such objects have no properties\nwhatsoever. This means that the deflationary nominalist's ontology is\nextremely minimal: only concrete objects are ultimately\nassumed\u2014objects that are ontologically independent of our\npsychological processes and linguistic practices. In particular, no\ndomain of nonexistent objects is posited nor a realm of genuine\nproperties of such objects. By \u2018genuine properties\u2019 I mean\nthose properties that hold only in virtue of what the objects in\nquestion are, and not as the result of some external relations to\nother objects. For example, although Sherlock Holmes does not exist,\nhe has the property of being thought of by me as I write this\nsentence. This is not, however, a genuine property of Sherlock Holmes\nin the intended sense.\nDeflationary nominalism is not a form of Meinongianism (Azzouni\n2010a). Although the ontology of deflationary nominalism is not\nsignificantly different from that of the Meinongian, the ideology of\nthe two views\u2014at least assuming a particular, traditional\ninterpretation of Meinongianism\u2014is importantly different. The\ndeflationary nominalist is not committed to any subsisting objects, in\ncontrast to what is often claimed to be a distinctive feature of\nMeinongianism.\nIt is not clear to me, however, that this traditional reading of\nMeinongianism is correct. If we consider the subsisting objects as\nthose that are abstract, and if we take only concrete objects as\nexisting, the resulting picture ideologically is not significantly\ndifferent from the one favored by the deflationary nominalist. Still,\nthe deflationary nominalists distance themselves from Meinongianism\n(Azzouni 2010a).\nWith the meager ontological commitments, the deflationary\nnominalist fares very well on the ontological front. One source of\nconcern is how meager the deflationary nominalist's ontology\nultimately is. For instance, platonists would insist that mathematical\nobjects are ontologically independent of our psychological processes\nand linguistic practices, and\u2014using the criterion of ontological\ncommitment offered by the deflationary nominalist\u2014they would\ninsist that these objects do exist. Similarly, modal realists\n(such as Lewis 1986) would also argue that possible worlds are\nontologically independent of us in the relevant sense, thus concluding\nthat these objects also exist. Deflationary nominalists will try to\nresist these conclusions. But unless their arguments are successful at\nthis point, the concern remains that the deflationary nominalist may\nhave a significantly more robust ontology\u2014given the proposed\ncriterion of ontological commitment\u2014than advertised.\nIt may be argued that deflationary nominalists are changing the\nrules of the debate. They state that mathematicians derive statements\nof the form \u201cThere are Fs\u201d, but insist that the\nobjects in question do not exist, given that quantifier commitment and\nontological commitment should be distinguished. This strategy is\nfundamentally different from those found in the nominalist proposals\ndiscussed before. It amounts to the denial of the first premise of the\nindispensability argument (\u201cWe ought to be ontologically\ncommitted to all and only those entities that are indispensable to our\nbest theories of the world\u201d). Even though quantification over\nmathematical entities is indispensable to our best theories of the\nworld (thus, the deflationary nominalist accepts the second premise of\nthe argument), this fact does not entail that these entities\nexist. After all, we can quantify over objects that do not exist,\ngiven the rejection of the indispensability argument's first\npremise.\nBut are deflationary nominalists really changing the rules of the\ndebate? If Quine's criterion of ontological commitment provides such\nrules, then they are. But why should we grant that Quine's criterion\nplay such a role? Deflationary nominalists challenge this deeply held\nassumption in ontological debates. And by doing so, they pave the way\nfor the development of a distinctive form of nominalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Azzouni, J., 1994, <i>Metaphysical Myths, Mathematical Practice:\nThe Ontology and Epistemology of the Exact Sciences</i>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1997, \u201cApplied Mathematics,\nExistential Commitment and the Quine-Putnam Indispensability\nThesis\u201d, <i>Philosophia Mathematica</i>, 5:\n193\u2013209.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000, \u201cApplying Mathematics: An\nAttempt to Design a Philosophical Problem\u201d, <i>The Monist</i>,\n83: 209\u2013227.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2004, <i>Deflating Existential Consequence:\nA Case for Nominalism</i>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, <i>Tracking Reason: Proof,\nConsequence, and Truth</i>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2007, \u201cOntological Commitment in the\nVernacular\u201d, <i>No\u00fbs</i>, 41: 204\u2013226.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2009a, \u201cEmpty <i>de re</i> Attitudes\nabout Numbers\u201d, <i>Philosophia Mathematica</i>, 17:\n163\u2013188.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 2009b, \u201cEvading Truth Commitments: The\nProblem Reanalyzed\u201d, <i>Logique et Analyse</i>, 206:\n139\u2013176.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2010a, <i>Talking about Nothing: Numbers,\nHallucinations, and Fictions</i>, New York: Oxford University\nPress.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 2010b, \u201cOntology and the Word\n\u2018Exist\u2019: Uneasy Relations\u201d, <i>Philosophia\nMathematica</i>, 18: 74\u2013101.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2011, \u201cNominalistic Content\u201d,\nin Cellucci, Grosholtz, and Ippoliti (eds.) 2011,\npp. 33\u201351.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012, \u201cTaking the Easy Road Out of\nDodge\u201d, <i>Mind</i>, 121: 951\u2013965.
