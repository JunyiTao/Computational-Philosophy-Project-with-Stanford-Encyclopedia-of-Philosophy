If a\ntheory has, up to isomorphism, exactly one model, then it is said to\nbe categorical. So modulo isomorphisms, arithmetic and\nanalysis each have exactly one intended model. Half a century later\nZermelo proved that the principles of set theory are\n\u201calmost\u201d categorical or quasi-categorical: for\nany two models \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) of the principles of set theory,\neither \\(M_1\\) is isomorphic to \\(M_2\\), or \\(M_1\\) is isomorphic to a\nstrongly inaccessible rank of \\(M_2\\), or \\(M_2\\) is isomorphic to a\nstrongly inaccessible rank of \\(M_1\\) (Zermelo 1930). In recent years,\nattempts have been made to develop arguments to the effect that\nZermelo\u2019s conclusion can be strengthened to a full categoricity\nassertion (McGee 1997; Martin 2001), but we will not discuss these\narguments here.\n\nAt the same time, the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem says that every\nfirst-order formal theory that has at least one model with an infinite\ndomain, must have models with domains of all infinite cardinalities.\nSince the principles of arithmetic, analysis and set theory had better\npossess at least one infinite model, the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\nappears to apply to them. Is this not in tension with Dedekind\u2019s\ncategoricity theorems?\n\nThe solution of this conundrum lies in the fact that Dedekind did not\neven implicitly work with first-order formalizations of the basic\nprinciples of arithmetic and analysis. Instead, he informally worked\nwith second-order formalizations.\n\nLet us focus on arithmetic to see what this amounts to. The basic\npostulates of arithmetic contain the induction axiom. In first-order\nformalizations of arithmetic, this is formulated as a scheme: for each\nfirst-order arithmetical formula of the language of arithmetic with\none free variable, one instance of the induction principle is included\nin the formalization of arithmetic. Elementary cardinality\nconsiderations reveal that there are infinitely many properties of\nnatural numbers that are not expressed by a first-order formula. But\nintuitively, it seems that the induction principle holds for\nall properties of natural numbers. So in a first-order\nlanguage, the full force of the principle of mathematical induction\ncannot be expressed. For this reason, a number of philosophers of\nmathematics insist that the postulates of arithmetic should be\nformulated in a second-order language (Shapiro 1991).\nSecond-order languages contain not just first-order quantifiers that\nrange over elements of the domain, but also second-order quantifiers\nthat range over properties (or subsets) of the domain. In\nfull second-order logic, it is insisted that these\nsecond-order quantifiers range over all subsets of the\ndomain. If the principles of arithmetic are formulated in a\nsecond-order language, then Dedekind\u2019s argument goes through and\nwe have a categorical theory. For similar reasons, we also obtain a\ncategorical theory if we formulate the basic principles of real\nanalysis in a second-order language, and the second-order formulation\nof set theory turns out to be quasi-categorical.\n\nAnte rem structuralism, as well as the modal nominalist\nstructuralist interpretation of mathematics, could benefit from a\nsecond-order formulation. If the ante rem structuralist wants\nto insists that the natural number structure is fixed up to\nisomorphism by the Peano axioms, then she will want to formulate the\nPeano axioms in second-order logic. And the modal nominalist\nstructuralist will want to insist that the relevant concrete systems\nfor arithmetic are those that make the second-order Peano\naxioms true (Hellman 1989). Similarly for real analysis and set\ntheory. Thus the appeal to second-order logic appears as the final\nstep in the structuralist project of isolating the intended models of\nmathematics.\n\nYet appeal to second-order logic in the philosophy of mathematics is\nby no means uncontroversial. A first objection is that the ontological\ncommitment of second-order logic is higher than the ontological\ncommitment of first-order logic. After all, use of second-order logic\nseems to commit us to the existence of abstract objects: classes. In\nresponse to this problem, Boolos has articulated an interpretation of\nsecond-order logic which avoids this commitment to abstract entities\n(Boolos 1985). His interpretation spells out the truth clauses for the\nsecond-order quantifiers in terms of plural expressions, without\ninvoking classes. For instance, an second-order expression of the form\n\\(\\exists x F(x)\\) is interpreted as: \u201cthere are some\n(first-order objects) x such that they\nhave the property F\u201d. This interpretation is\ncalled the plural interpretation of second-order logic. It is\ncontroversial whether there is a real difference between the\nmathematical use of pluralities and of sets (Linnebo 2003).\nNevertheless it is clear that an appeal to the plural interpretation\nof second-order logic will be tempting for nominalist versions of\nstructuralism.\n\nA second objection against second-order logic can be traced back to\nQuine (Quine 1970). This objection states that the interpretation of\nfull second-order logic is connected with set-theoretical questions.\nThis is already indicated by the fact that most regimentations of\nsecond-order logic adopt a version of the axiom of choice as one of\nits axioms. But more worrisome is the fact that second-order logic is\ninextricably intertwined with deep problems in set theory, such as the\ncontinuum hypothesis. For theories such as arithmetic that intend to\ndescribe an infinite collection of objects, even a matter as\nelementary as the question of the cardinality of the range of the\nsecond-order quantifiers, is equivalent to the continuum problem.\nAlso, it turns out that there exists a sentence which is a\nsecond-order logical truth if and only if the continuum hypothesis\nholds (Boolos 1975). We have seen that the continuum problem is\nindependent of the currently accepted principles of set theory. And\nmany researchers believe it to be absolutely truth-valueless. If this\nis so, then there is an inherent indeterminacy in the very notion of\nsecond-order infinite model. And many contemporary philosophers of\nmathematics take the latter not to have a determinate truth value.\nThus, it is argued, the very notion of an (infinite) model of full\nsecond-order logic is inherently indeterminate.\n\nIf one does not want to appeal to full second-order logic, then there\nare other ways to ensure categoricity of mathematical theories. One\nidea would be to make use of quantifiers which are somehow\nintermediate between first-order and second-order quantifiers. For\ninstance, one might treat \u201cthere are finitely many x\u201d\nas a primitive quantifier. This will allow one\nto, for instance, construct a categorical axiomatization of\narithmetic.\n\nBut ensuring categoricity of mathematical theories does not require\nintroducing stronger quantifiers. Another option would be to take the\ninformal concept of algorithmic computability as a primitive notion\n(Halbach & Horsten 2005; Horsten 2012). A theorem of Tennenbaum\nstates that all first-order models of Peano Arithmetic in which\naddition and multiplication are computable functions, are isomorphic\nto each other. Now our operations of addition and\nmultiplication are computable: otherwise we could never have learned\nthese operations. This, then, is another way in which we may be able\nto isolate the intended models of our principles of arithmetic.\nAgainst this account, however, it may be pointed out that it seems\nthat the categoricity of intended models for real analysis, for\ninstance, cannot be ensured in this manner. For computation on models\nof the principles of real analysis, we do not have a theorem that\nplays the role of Tennenbaum\u2019s theorem.\n\nIf one accepts a certain open-endedness of the collection of\narithmetical predicates, then a categoricity theorem of sorts for\narithmetic can be obtained without overstepping the bounds of\nfirst-order logic and without appealing to an informal concept of\ncomputability. Suppose that there are two mathematicians, A and B, who\nboth assert the first-order Peano-axioms in their own idiolect.\nSuppose furthermore that A and B regard the collection of predicates\nfor which mathematical induction is permissible as open-ended, and are\nboth willing to accept the other\u2019s induction scheme as true.\nThen A and B have the wherewithal to convince themselves that both\nidiolects describe isomorphic structures (Parsons 1990b). Such\narguments are called internal categoricity arguments. They are widely\ndebated in contempory philosophy of mathematics: see for instance\n(Button & Walsh 2019).\n\nMany of those who are sceptical of the philosophical use of\ncategoricity argments in the philosophy of mathematics take all of our\nconsistent mathematical theories to have many structurally different\nmodels, and take all or many of those models to be on a par with one\nanother. As we saw in the previous sub-section, the set theoretic\nmultiverse view is a case in point, and so is set theoretic\npotentialism. But one can go further, and defend the thesis that any\nconsistent mathematical theory describes a free-standing mathematical\nuniverse, and that no such theory is more true than any other (Linsky\n& Zalta 1995, Bueno 2011).\n\nThese theories belong to a family of views that is called\nmathematical pluralism, which is an increasingly prominent\ntheme in the philosophy of mathematics. Historically, this\nconstellation of views has roots in the work of Hilbert and of Carnap.\nIn a debate with Frege, Hilbert insisted that consistency suffices for\na mathematical theory to have a subject matter (Resnik 1974); Carnap\nargued that choice between alternative large-scale theories\n(frameworks) is ultimately never more than a pragmatic matter\n(Carnap 1950).\n\nAs is everywhere the case in philosophy, there is disagreement here:\nfor a critique of the doctrine that mathematical truth is an\nirrevocably use-relative notion, see (Koellner 2009b), and for a\nretort, see (Warren 2015). Some react to mathematical pluralism by\ntaking it one step further still, and argue that also all inconsistent\nmathematical theories should be regarded as true (in a relativised\nsense). Moreover, some mathematical theories that are trivial in the\nsense of being inconsistent, are commonly taken to be just as\nvaluable as many venerable consistent ones:\n\u201cHistorically, there are three [to the author\u2019s knowledge]\nmathematical theories which had a profound impact on mathematics and\nlogic, and were found to be trivial. There are Cantor\u2019s naive\nset theory, Frege\u2019s formal theory of logic and the first version\nof Church\u2019s formal theory of mathematical logic. All three had\nprofound reprecussions on subsequent mathematics\u201d (Friend 2013,\np. 294).\n",
