    "main_text": "Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions || The modal problem\n5.1 The modal problem\n\nG. E. Moore drew attention to a point that might look (and has been\nheld to be) problematic for the identity theory (Moore 1953: 308; Fine\n1982: 46\u20137; K\u00fcnne 2003: 9\u201310). The proposition\nthat Socrates is wise exists in all possible worlds where\nSocrates and the property of wisdom exist, but in some of those worlds\nthis proposition is true and in others it is false. The fact that\nSocrates is wise, by contrast, only exists in those worlds where\nthe proposition both exists and is true. So it would seem that the\nproposition that Socrates is wise cannot be identical with\nthe fact that Socrates is wise. They have different modal\nproperties, and so by the principle of the indiscernibility of\nidenticals they cannot be identical.\n\nNote, first, that this problem, if it is a problem, has nothing\nespecially to do with the identity theory of truth or with facts. It\nseems to arise already for true propositions and propositions taken\nsimpliciter before ever we get to the topic of facts. That\nis, one might think that the proposition that Socrates is\nwise is identical with the true proposition that Socrates is\nwise (assuming, as we are doing, that this proposition\nis true); but we then face the objection that the proposition\ntaken simpliciter and the true proposition differ in their\nmodal properties, since (as one might suppose) the true proposition\nthat Socrates is wise does not exist at worlds where the\nproposition that Socrates is wise is false, but the\nproposition taken simpliciter does. Indeed the problem, if it\nis a problem, is still more general, and purported solutions to it go\nback at least to the Middle Ages (when it was discussed in connection\nwith Duns Scotus\u2019 formal distinction; see Gaskin 2002 [with\nreferences to further relevant literature]). Suppose that Socrates is\na cantankerous old curmudgeon. Now grumpy Socrates, one would think,\nis identical with Socrates. But in some other possible worlds Socrates\nis of a sunny and genial disposition. So it would seem that Socrates\ncannot be identical with grumpy Socrates after all, because in these\nother possible worlds, while Socrates goes on existing, grumpy\nSocrates does not exist\u2014or so one might argue.\n\nCan the identity theorist deal with this problem, and if so how? Here\nis one suggestion. Suppose we hold, staying with grumpy Socrates for a\nmoment, that, against the assumption made at the end of the last\nparagraph, grumpy Socrates does in fact exist in worlds where\nSocrates has a sunny disposition. The basis for this move would be the\nthought that, after all, grumpy Socrates is identical with\nSocrates, and Socrates exists in these other worlds. So\ngrumpy Socrates exists in those worlds too; it is just that he is not\ngrumpy in those worlds. (Suppose Socrates is very grumpy;\nsuppose in fact that grumpiness is so deeply ingrained in his\ncharacter that worlds in which he is genial are quite far away.\nSomeone surveying the array of possible worlds, starting from the\nactual world and moving out in circles, and stumbling at long last\nupon a world with a pleasant Socrates in it, might register the\ndiscovery by exclaiming, with relief, \u201cOh look! Grumpy Socrates\nis not grumpy over here!\u201d.) Similarly, one might contend, the\ntrue proposition, and fact, that Socrates is wise goes on\nexisting in the worlds where Socrates is not wise, because the true\nproposition, and fact, that Socrates is wise just is\nthe proposition that Socrates is wise, and that proposition\ngoes on existing in these other worlds, but in those worlds that true\nproposition, and fact, is not a true proposition, or a fact. (In\nScotist terms one might say that the proposition that Socrates is\nwise and the fact that Socrates is wise are really\nidentical but formally distinct.)\n\nThis solution was, in outline, proposed by Richard Cartwright in his\n1987 discussion of the identity theory (Cartwright 1987: 76\u20138;\ncf. David 2002: 128\u20139; Dodd 2008a: 86\u20138; Candlish &\nDamnjanovic 2018: 265\u20136). According to Cartwright, the true\nproposition, and fact, that there are subways in Boston\nexists in other possible worlds where Boston does not have subways,\neven though in those worlds that fact would be not be a fact.\n(Compare: grumpy Socrates exists in worlds where Socrates is genial\nand sunny, but he is not grumpy there.) So even in worlds where it is\nnot a fact that Boston has subways, that\nfact, namely the fact that Boston has subways, continues to\nexist. Cartwright embellishes his solution with two controversial\npoints. First, he draws on Kripke\u2019s distinction between rigid\nand non-rigid designation, suggesting that his solution can be\ndescribed by saying that the expression \u201cThe fact that\nBoston has subways\u201d is a non-rigid designator. But it is\nplausible that that expression goes on referring to, or being\nsatisfied by (depending on how exactly one wants to set up the\nsemantics of definite descriptions: see Gaskin 2008: 56\u201381), the\nfact that Boston has subways in possible worlds where Boston\ndoes not have subways; it is just that, though that fact exists in\nthose worlds, it is not a fact there. But that upshot does not appear\nto derogate from the rigidity of the expression in\nquestion. Secondly, Cartwright allows for a true\nreading of \u201cThe fact that there are subways in Boston\nmight not have been the fact that there are subways in\nBoston\u201d. But it is arguable that we should say that this\nsentence is just false (David 2002: 129). The fact that there are\nsubways in Boston would still have gone on being the same\nfact in worlds where Boston has no subways, namely the fact\nthat there are subways in Boston; it is just that in those\nworlds this fact would not have been a fact. You\nmight say: in that world the fact that there are subways\nin Boston would not be correctly described as a fact, but in\ntalking about that world we are talking about it from the point of\nview of our world, and in our world it is a fact. (Similarly with\ngrumpy Socrates.)\n\nNow, an objector may want to press the following point against the\nabove purported solution to the difficulty. Consider again the fact\nthat Socrates is wise. Surely, it might be said, it is more\nnatural to maintain that that fact does not exist in a\npossible world where Socrates is not wise, rather than that it exists\nthere all right, but is not a fact. After all, imagine a conversation\nabout a world in which Socrates is not wise and suppose that Speaker\nA claims that Socrates is indeed wise in that world. Speaker\nB might counter with \n\n\nNo, sorry, you\u2019re wrong: there is no such fact in that world;\nthe purported fact that Socrates is wise simply does not\nexist in that world. \n\n\nIt might seem odd to insist that B is not allowed to say this\nand must say instead \n\n\nYes, you\u2019re right that there is such a fact in that world,\nnamely the fact that Socrates is wise, but in that world\nthat fact is not a fact;. \n\n\nHow might the identity theorist respond to this objection? One\npossible strategy would be to make a distinction between fact\nand factuality, as follows. Factuality, one might\nsay, is a reification of facts. Once you have a fact, you also get, as\nan ontological spin-off, the factuality of that fact. The\nfact, being a proposition, exists at all possible worlds where the\nproposition exists, though in some of these worlds it may not be a\nfact: it will not be a fact in worlds where the proposition is false.\nThe factuality of that fact, by contrast, only exists at those worlds\nwhere the fact is a fact\u2014where the proposition is true.\nSo factuality is a bit like a trope. Compare grumpy Socrates again.\nGrumpy Socrates, the identity theorist might contend, exists at all\nworlds where Socrates exists, though at some of those worlds he is not\ngrumpy. But Socrates\u2019 grumpiness\u2014that particular\ntrope\u2014exists only at worlds where Socrates is grumpy. That seems\nto obviate the problem, because the suggestion being canvassed here is\nthat grumpy Socrates is identical not with Socrates\u2019\ngrumpiness\u2014so that the fact that these two entities have\ndifferent modal properties need embarrass no one\u2014but rather with\nSocrates. Similarly, the suggestion is that the proposition\nthat Socrates is wise is identical not with the\nfactuality of the fact that Socrates is wise, but\njust with that fact. So the identity theorist would\naccommodate the objector\u2019s point by insisting that\nfacts exist at possible worlds where their\nfactualities do not exist.\n\nThe reader may be wondering why this problem was ever raised against\nthe identity theory of truth in the first place. After all, the\nidentity theorist does not say that propositions simpliciter\nare identical with facts, but that true propositions are\nidentical with facts, and now true propositions and facts surely have\nexactly the same modal properties: for regardless how things\nare with the sheer proposition that Socrates is wise, at any\nrate the true proposition that Socrates is wise must\nsurely be thought to exist at the same worlds as the fact that\nSocrates is wise, whatever those worlds are. However, as against\nthis quick way with the purported problem, there stands the intuition,\nmentioned and exploited above, that the true proposition that\nSocrates is wise is identical with the proposition that\nSocrates is wise. So long as that intuition is in play, the\nproblem does indeed seem to arise\u2014for true propositions, in the\nfirst instance, and then for facts by transitivity of identity. But\nthe identity theorist will maintain that, as explained, the problem\nhas a satisfactory solution.\n",
