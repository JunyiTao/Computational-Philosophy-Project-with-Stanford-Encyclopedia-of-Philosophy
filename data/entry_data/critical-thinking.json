    "preamble": "\n\nCritical thinking is a widely accepted educational goal. Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\n\n\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\n\n\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\n\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\n\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\n Supplement on Assessment.\n Educational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\n\nFor details on this history, see the\n Supplement on History.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\n\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\n\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\n\nTransit: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down on a\nsurface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I returned\nthe same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway express. But was\nthere a station near? If not, I might lose more than twenty minutes in\nlooking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and I saw there was\nsuch a line within two blocks. But where was the station? If it were\nseveral blocks above or below the street I was on, I should lose time\ninstead of gaining it. My mind went back to the subway express as\nquicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered that it went\nnearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I wished to\nreach, so that time would be saved at the end of the journey. I\nconcluded in favor of the subway, and reached my destination by one\no\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369; 1933: 91\u201392)\n\nFerryboat: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of the\nboat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he would\nneed some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also need\npoles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more probable\nthan the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion that the\npole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the direction in\nwhich the boat pointed, to enable him to steer correctly.\u201d\n(Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\n\nBubbles: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\n\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\n\nWeather: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\n\nDisorder: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\n\nTyphoid: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\n\nBlur: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\n\nSuction pump: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\n\nDiamond: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\n\nRash: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\n\nCandidate: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\n\n\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\n\n\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\n\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\n\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\n\n\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\n\n\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\n\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\n\n\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\n\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\n\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\n\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\n\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\n\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\n\nsuggestions, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem to be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (reasoning, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\n\n\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\n\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\n Transit\n might have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\n Typhoid\n as avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\n\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\n\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\n\nObserving: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\n Weather,\n bubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\n Bubbles,\n a moving blur in the distance in\n Blur,\n a rash in\n Rash).\n Or one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\n Disorder,\n no suction without air pressure in\n Suction pump)\nFeeling: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\n Transit,\n why the diamonds vary in spacing in\n Diamond).\n One wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond).\nWondering: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\n Bubbles,\n how suction pumps work in\n Suction pump,\n what caused the rash in\n Rash).\nImagining: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\n Transit,\n flagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\n Ferryboat,\n allergic reaction or heat rash in\n Rash).\nInferring: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\n Disorder,\n earlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\n Rash).\n Or one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\n Transit,\n burglary in\n Disorder,\n discontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\n Rash).\nKnowledge: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\n Transit,\n of the requirements for a flagpole in\n Ferryboat,\n of Boyle\u2019s law in\n Bubbles,\n of allergic reactions in\n Rash).\nExperimenting: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\n Ferryboat,\n putting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\n Bubbles,\n measuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\n Suction pump,\n noticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\n Diamond).\nConsulting: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\n Candidate\n includes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\n Candidate.\n It is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\n Ferryboat\n that the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\n Transit\n to take the subway.\n\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\n\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\n\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\n\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\n\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\n\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\n\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\n\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\n\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\n\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\n\nAttentiveness: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\n Weather\n would not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\n Bubbles\n could easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\n Rash\n lacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\n\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\n Supplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\n\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\n Transit,\n has some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\n\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\n\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\n section 6\n as components of the critical thinking process described in\n section 5.\n The derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\n\nObservational abilities: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\n\nEmotional abilities: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at achieving the desired resolution. Children\nexperience these emotions at an early age, without being trained to do\nso. Education that takes critical thinking as a goal needs only to\nchannel these emotions and to make sure not to stifle them.\nCollaborative critical thinking benefits from ability to recognize\none\u2019s own and others\u2019 emotional commitments and\nreactions.\n\nQuestioning abilities: A critical thinking process needs\ntransformation of an inchoate sense of perplexity into a clear\nquestion. Formulating a question well requires not building in\nquestionable assumptions, not prejudging the issue, and using language\nthat in context is unambiguous and precise enough (Ennis 1962: 97;\n1991: 9).\n\nImaginative abilities: Thinking directed at finding the\ncorrect causal explanation of a general phenomenon or particular event\nrequires an ability to imagine possible explanations. Thinking about\nwhat policy or plan of action to adopt requires generation of options\nand consideration of possible consequences of each option. Domain\nknowledge is required for such creative activity, but a general\nability to imagine alternatives is helpful and can be nurtured so as\nto become easier, quicker, more extensive, and deeper (Dewey 1910:\n34\u201339; 1933: 40\u201347). Facione (1990a) and Halpern (1998)\ninclude the ability to imagine alternatives as a critical thinking\nability.\n\nInferential abilities: The ability to draw conclusions from\ngiven information, and to recognize with what degree of certainty\none\u2019s own or others\u2019 conclusions follow, is universally\nrecognized as a general critical thinking ability. All 11 examples in\n section 2\n of this article include inferences, some from hypotheses or options\n(as in\n Transit,\n Ferryboat and\n Disorder),\n others from something observed (as in\n Weather\n and\n Rash).\n None of these inferences is formally valid. Rather, they are licensed\nby general, sometimes qualified substantive rules of inference\n(Toulmin 1958) that rest on domain knowledge\u2014that a bus trip\ntakes about the same time in each direction, that the terminal of a\nwireless telegraph would be located on the highest possible place,\nthat sudden cooling is often followed by rain, that an allergic\nreaction to a sulfa drug generally shows up soon after one starts\ntaking it. It is a matter of controversy to what extent the\nspecialized ability to deduce conclusions from premisses using formal\nrules of inference is needed for critical thinking. Dewey (1933)\nlocates logical forms in setting out the products of reflection rather\nthan in the process of reflection. Ennis (1981a), on the other hand,\nmaintains that a liberally-educated person should have the following\nabilities: to translate natural-language statements into statements\nusing the standard logical operators, to use appropriately the\nlanguage of necessary and sufficient conditions, to deal with argument\nforms and arguments containing symbols, to determine whether in virtue\nof an argument\u2019s form its conclusion follows necessarily from\nits premisses, to reason with logically complex propositions, and to\napply the rules and procedures of deductive logic. Inferential\nabilities are recognized as critical thinking abilities by Glaser\n(1941: 6), Facione (1990a: 9), Ennis (1991: 9), Fisher & Scriven\n(1997: 99, 111), and Halpern (1998: 452). Items testing inferential\nabilities constitute two of the five subtests of the Watson Glaser\nCritical Thinking Appraisal (Watson & Glaser 1980a, 1980b, 1994),\ntwo of the four sections in the Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level X\n(Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985, 2005),\nthree of the seven sections in the Cornell Critical Thinking Test\nLevel Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005), 11 of the 34 items on Forms A and B of the California Critical\nThinking Skills Test (Facione 1990b, 1992), and a high but variable\nproportion of the 25 selected-response questions in the Collegiate\nLearning Assessment (Council for Aid to Education 2017).\n\nExperimenting abilities: Knowing how to design and execute an\nexperiment is important not just in scientific research but also in\neveryday life, as in\n Rash.\n Dewey devoted a whole chapter of his How We Think (1910:\n145\u2013156; 1933: 190\u2013202) to the superiority of\nexperimentation over observation in advancing knowledge. Experimenting\nabilities come into play at one remove in appraising reports of\nscientific studies. Skill in designing and executing experiments\nincludes the acknowledged abilities to appraise evidence (Glaser 1941:\n6), to carry out experiments and to apply appropriate statistical\ninference techniques (Facione 1990a: 9), to judge inductions to an\nexplanatory hypothesis (Ennis 1991: 9), and to recognize the need for\nan adequately large sample size (Halpern 1998). The Cornell Critical\nThinking Test Level Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, &\nTomko 1985, 2005) includes four items (out of 52) on experimental\ndesign. The Collegiate Learning Assessment (Council for Aid to\nEducation 2017) makes room for appraisal of study design in both its\nperformance task and its selected-response questions.\n\nConsulting abilities: Skill at consulting sources of\ninformation comes into play when one seeks information to help resolve\na problem, as in\n Candidate.\n Ability to find and appraise information includes ability to gather\nand marshal pertinent information (Glaser 1941: 6), to judge whether a\nstatement made by an alleged authority is acceptable (Ennis 1962: 84),\nto plan a search for desired information (Facione 1990a: 9), and to\njudge the credibility of a source (Ennis 1991: 9). Ability to judge\nthe credibility of statements is tested by 24 items (out of 76) in the\nCornell Critical Thinking Test Level X (Ennis & Millman 1971;\nEnnis, Millman, & Tomko 1985, 2005) and by four items (out of 52)\nin the Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level Z (Ennis & Millman\n1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985, 2005). The College Learning\nAssessment\u2019s performance task requires evaluation of whether\ninformation in documents is credible or unreliable (Council for Aid to\nEducation 2017).\n\nArgument analysis abilities: The ability to identify and\nanalyze arguments contributes to the process of surveying arguments on\nan issue in order to form one\u2019s own reasoned judgment, as in\n Candidate.\n The ability to detect and analyze arguments is recognized as a\ncritical thinking skill by Facione (1990a: 7\u20138), Ennis (1991: 9)\nand Halpern (1998). Five items (out of 34) on the California Critical\nThinking Skills Test (Facione 1990b, 1992) test skill at argument\nanalysis. The College Learning Assessment (Council for Aid to\nEducation 2017) incorporates argument analysis in its\nselected-response tests of critical reading and evaluation and of\ncritiquing an argument.\n\nJudging skills and deciding skills: Skill at judging and\ndeciding is skill at recognizing what judgment or decision the\navailable evidence and argument supports, and with what degree of\nconfidence. It is thus a component of the inferential skills already\ndiscussed.\n\nLists and tests of critical thinking abilities often include two more\nabilities: identifying assumptions and constructing and evaluating\ndefinitions.\n10. Required Knowledge\n\nIn addition to dispositions and abilities, critical thinking needs\nknowledge: of critical thinking concepts, of critical thinking\nprinciples, and of the subject-matter of the thinking.\n\nWe can derive a short list of concepts whose understanding contributes\nto critical thinking from the critical thinking abilities described in\nthe preceding section. Observational abilities require an\nunderstanding of the difference between observation and inference.\nQuestioning abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nambiguity and vagueness. Inferential abilities require an\nunderstanding of the difference between conclusive and defeasible\ninference (traditionally, between deduction and induction), as well as\nof the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.\nExperimenting abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nhypothesis, null hypothesis, assumption and prediction, as well as of\nthe concept of statistical significance and of its difference from\nimportance. They also require an understanding of the difference\nbetween an experiment and an observational study, and in particular of\nthe difference between a randomized controlled trial, a prospective\ncorrelational study and a retrospective (case-control) study. Argument\nanalysis abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nargument, premiss, assumption, conclusion and counter-consideration.\nAdditional critical thinking concepts are proposed by Bailin et al.\n(1999b: 293), Fisher & Scriven (1997: 105\u2013106), Black\n(2012), and Blair (2021).\n\nAccording to Glaser (1941: 25), ability to think critically requires\nknowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning. If we\nreview the list of abilities in the preceding section, however, we can\nsee that some of them can be acquired and exercised merely through\npractice, possibly guided in an educational setting, followed by\nfeedback. Searching intelligently for a causal explanation of some\nphenomenon or event requires that one consider a full range of\npossible causal contributors, but it seems more important that one\nimplements this principle in one\u2019s practice than that one is\nable to articulate it. What is important is \u201coperational\nknowledge\u201d of the standards and principles of good thinking\n(Bailin et al. 1999b: 291\u2013293). But the development of such\ncritical thinking abilities as designing an experiment or constructing\nan operational definition can benefit from learning their underlying\ntheory. Further, explicit knowledge of quirks of human thinking seems\nuseful as a cautionary guide. Human memory is not just fallible about\ndetails, as people learn from their own experiences of misremembering,\nbut is so malleable that a detailed, clear and vivid recollection of\nan event can be a total fabrication (Loftus 2017). People seek or\ninterpret evidence in ways that are partial to their existing beliefs\nand expectations, often unconscious of their \u201cconfirmation\nbias\u201d (Nickerson 1998). Not only are people subject to this and\nother cognitive biases (Kahneman 2011), of which they are typically\nunaware, but it may be counter-productive for one to make oneself\naware of them and try consciously to counteract them or to counteract\nsocial biases such as racial or sexual stereotypes (Kenyon &\nBeaulac 2014). It is helpful to be aware of these facts and of the\nsuperior effectiveness of blocking the operation of biases\u2014for\nexample, by making an immediate record of one\u2019s observations,\nrefraining from forming a preliminary explanatory hypothesis, blind\nrefereeing, double-blind randomized trials, and blind grading of\nstudents\u2019 work. It is also helpful to be aware of the prevalence\nof \u201cnoise\u201d (unwanted unsystematic variability of\njudgments), of how to detect noise (through a noise audit), and of how\nto reduce noise: make accuracy the goal, think statistically, break a\nprocess of arriving at a judgment into independent tasks, resist\npremature intuitions, in a group get independent judgments first,\nfavour comparative judgments and scales (Kahneman, Sibony, &\nSunstein 2021). It is helpful as well to be aware of the concept of\n\u201cbounded rationality\u201d in decision-making and of the\nrelated distinction between \u201csatisficing\u201d and optimizing\n(Simon 1956; Gigerenzer 2001).\n\nCritical thinking about an issue requires substantive knowledge of the\ndomain to which the issue belongs. Critical thinking abilities are not\na magic elixir that can be applied to any issue whatever by somebody\nwho has no knowledge of the facts relevant to exploring that issue.\nFor example, the student in\n Bubbles\n needed to know that gases do not penetrate solid objects like a\nglass, that air expands when heated, that the volume of an enclosed\ngas varies directly with its temperature and inversely with its\npressure, and that hot objects will spontaneously cool down to the\nambient temperature of their surroundings unless kept hot by\ninsulation or a source of heat. Critical thinkers thus need a rich\nfund of subject-matter knowledge relevant to the variety of situations\nthey encounter. This fact is recognized in the inclusion among\ncritical thinking dispositions of a concern to become and remain\ngenerally well informed.\n11. Educational methods\n\nExperimental educational interventions, with control groups, have\nshown that education can improve critical thinking skills and\ndispositions, as measured by standardized tests. For information about\nthese tests, see the\n Supplement on Assessment.\n\nWhat educational methods are most effective at developing the\ndispositions, abilities and knowledge of a critical thinker? In a\ncomprehensive meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental\nstudies of strategies for teaching students to think critically,\nAbrami et al. (2015) found that dialogue, anchored instruction, and\nmentoring each increased the effectiveness of the educational\nintervention, and that they were most effective when combined. They\nalso found that in these studies a combination of separate instruction\nin critical thinking with subject-matter instruction in which students\nare encouraged to think critically was more effective than either by\nitself. However, the difference was not statistically significant;\nthat is, it might have arisen by chance.\n\nMost of these studies lack the longitudinal follow-up required to\ndetermine whether the observed differential improvements in critical\nthinking abilities or dispositions continue over time, for example\nuntil high school or college graduation. For details on studies of\nmethods of developing critical thinking skills and dispositions, see\nthe\n Supplement on Educational Methods.\n12. Controversies\n\nScholars have denied the generalizability of critical thinking\nabilities across subject domains, have alleged bias in critical\nthinking theory and pedagogy, and have investigated the relationship\nof critical thinking to other kinds of thinking.\n12.1 The Generalizability of Critical Thinking\n\nMcPeck (1981) attacked the thinking skills movement of the 1970s,\nincluding the critical thinking movement. He argued that there are no\ngeneral thinking skills, since thinking is always thinking about some\nsubject-matter. It is futile, he claimed, for schools and colleges to\nteach thinking as if it were a separate subject. Rather, teachers\nshould lead their pupils to become autonomous thinkers by teaching\nschool subjects in a way that brings out their cognitive structure and\nthat encourages and rewards discussion and argument. As some of his\ncritics (e.g., Paul 1985; Siegel 1985) pointed out, McPeck\u2019s\ncentral argument needs elaboration, since it has obvious\ncounter-examples in writing and speaking, for which (up to a certain\nlevel of complexity) there are teachable general abilities even though\nthey are always about some subject-matter. To make his argument\nconvincing, McPeck needs to explain how thinking differs from writing\nand speaking in a way that does not permit useful abstraction of its\ncomponents from the subject-matters with which it deals. He has not\ndone so. Nevertheless, his position that the dispositions and\nabilities of a critical thinker are best developed in the context of\nsubject-matter instruction is shared by many theorists of critical\nthinking, including Dewey (1910, 1933), Glaser (1941), Passmore\n(1980), Weinstein (1990), Bailin et al. (1999b), and Willingham\n(2019).\n\nMcPeck\u2019s challenge prompted reflection on the extent to which\ncritical thinking is subject-specific. McPeck argued for a strong\nsubject-specificity thesis, according to which it is a conceptual\ntruth that all critical thinking abilities are specific to a subject.\n(He did not however extend his subject-specificity thesis to critical\nthinking dispositions. In particular, he took the disposition to\nsuspend judgment in situations of cognitive dissonance to be a general\ndisposition.) Conceptual subject-specificity is subject to obvious\ncounter-examples, such as the general ability to recognize confusion\nof necessary and sufficient conditions. A more modest thesis, also\nendorsed by McPeck, is epistemological subject-specificity, according\nto which the norms of good thinking vary from one field to another.\nEpistemological subject-specificity clearly holds to a certain extent;\nfor example, the principles in accordance with which one solves a\ndifferential equation are quite different from the principles in\naccordance with which one determines whether a painting is a genuine\nPicasso. But the thesis suffers, as Ennis (1989) points out, from\nvagueness of the concept of a field or subject and from the obvious\nexistence of inter-field principles, however broadly the concept of a\nfield is construed. For example, the principles of\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning hold for all the varied fields in\nwhich such reasoning occurs. A third kind of subject-specificity is\nempirical subject-specificity, according to which as a matter of\nempirically observable fact a person with the abilities and\ndispositions of a critical thinker in one area of investigation will\nnot necessarily have them in another area of investigation.\n\nThe thesis of empirical subject-specificity raises the general problem\nof transfer. If critical thinking abilities and dispositions have to\nbe developed independently in each school subject, how are they of any\nuse in dealing with the problems of everyday life and the political\nand social issues of contemporary society, most of which do not fit\ninto the framework of a traditional school subject? Proponents of\nempirical subject-specificity tend to argue that transfer is more\nlikely to occur if there is critical thinking instruction in a variety\nof domains, with explicit attention to dispositions and abilities that\ncut across domains. But evidence for this claim is scanty. There is a\nneed for well-designed empirical studies that investigate the\nconditions that make transfer more likely.\n\nIt is common ground in debates about the generality or\nsubject-specificity of critical thinking dispositions and abilities\nthat critical thinking about any topic requires background knowledge\nabout the topic. For example, the most sophisticated understanding of\nthe principles of hypothetico-deductive reasoning is of no help unless\naccompanied by some knowledge of what might be plausible explanations\nof some phenomenon under investigation.\n12.2 Bias in Critical Thinking Theory and Pedagogy\n\nCritics have objected to bias in the theory, pedagogy and practice of\ncritical thinking. Commentators (e.g., Alston 1995; Ennis 1998) have\nnoted that anyone who takes a position has a bias in the neutral sense\nof being inclined in one direction rather than others. The critics,\nhowever, are objecting to bias in the pejorative sense of an\nunjustified favoring of certain ways of knowing over others,\nfrequently alleging that the unjustly favoured ways are those of a\ndominant sex or culture (Bailin 1995). These ways favour:\n\nreinforcement of egocentric and sociocentric biases over\ndialectical engagement with opposing world-views (Paul 1981, 1984;\nWarren 1998)\ndistancing from the object of inquiry over closeness to it (Martin\n1992; Thayer-Bacon 1992)\nindifference to the situation of others over care for them (Martin\n1992)\norientation to thought over orientation to action (Martin\n1992)\nbeing reasonable over caring to understand people\u2019s ideas\n(Thayer-Bacon 1993)\nbeing neutral and objective over being embodied and situated\n(Thayer-Bacon 1995a)\ndoubting over believing (Thayer-Bacon 1995b)\nreason over emotion, imagination and intuition (Thayer-Bacon\n2000)\nsolitary thinking over collaborative thinking (Thayer-Bacon\n2000)\nwritten and spoken assignments over other forms of expression\n(Alston 2001)\nattention to written and spoken communications over attention to\nhuman problems (Alston 2001)\nwinning debates in the public sphere over making and understanding\nmeaning (Alston 2001)\n\n\nA common thread in this smorgasbord of accusations is dissatisfaction\nwith focusing on the logical analysis and evaluation of reasoning and\narguments. While these authors acknowledge that such analysis and\nevaluation is part of critical thinking and should be part of its\nconceptualization and pedagogy, they insist that it is only a part.\nPaul (1981), for example, bemoans the tendency of atomistic teaching\nof methods of analyzing and evaluating arguments to turn students into\nmore able sophists, adept at finding fault with positions and\narguments with which they disagree but even more entrenched in the\negocentric and sociocentric biases with which they began. Martin\n(1992) and Thayer-Bacon (1992) cite with approval the self-reported\nintimacy with their subject-matter of leading researchers in biology\nand medicine, an intimacy that conflicts with the distancing allegedly\nrecommended in standard conceptions and pedagogy of critical thinking.\nThayer-Bacon (2000) contrasts the embodied and socially embedded\nlearning of her elementary school students in a Montessori school, who\nused their imagination, intuition and emotions as well as their\nreason, with conceptions of critical thinking as\n\n\nthinking that is used to critique arguments, offer justifications, and\nmake judgments about what are the good reasons, or the right answers.\n(Thayer-Bacon 2000: 127\u2013128)\n\n\nAlston (2001) reports that her students in a women\u2019s studies\nclass were able to see the flaws in the Cinderella myth that pervades\nmuch romantic fiction but in their own romantic relationships still\nacted as if all failures were the woman\u2019s fault and still\naccepted the notions of love at first sight and living happily ever\nafter. Students, she writes, should\n\n\nbe able to connect their intellectual critique to a more affective,\nsomatic, and ethical account of making risky choices that have sexist,\nracist, classist, familial, sexual, or other consequences for\nthemselves and those both near and far\u2026 critical thinking that\nreads arguments, texts, or practices merely on the surface without\nconnections to feeling/desiring/doing or action lacks an ethical depth\nthat should infuse the difference between mere cognitive activity and\nsomething we want to call critical thinking. (Alston 2001: 34)\n\n\nSome critics portray such biases as unfair to women. Thayer-Bacon\n(1992), for example, has charged modern critical thinking theory with\nbeing sexist, on the ground that it separates the self from the object\nand causes one to lose touch with one\u2019s inner voice, and thus\nstigmatizes women, who (she asserts) link self to object and listen to\ntheir inner voice. Her charge does not imply that women as a group are\non average less able than men to analyze and evaluate arguments.\nFacione (1990c) found no difference by sex in performance on his\nCalifornia Critical Thinking Skills Test. Kuhn (1991: 280\u2013281)\nfound no difference by sex in either the disposition or the competence\nto engage in argumentative thinking.\n\nThe critics propose a variety of remedies for the biases that they\nallege. In general, they do not propose to eliminate or downplay\ncritical thinking as an educational goal. Rather, they propose to\nconceptualize critical thinking differently and to change its pedagogy\naccordingly. Their pedagogical proposals arise logically from their\nobjections. They can be summarized as follows:\n\nFocus on argument networks with dialectical exchanges reflecting\ncontesting points of view rather than on atomic arguments, so as to\ndevelop \u201cstrong sense\u201d critical thinking that transcends\negocentric and sociocentric biases (Paul 1981, 1984).\nFoster closeness to the subject-matter and feeling connected to\nothers in order to inform a humane democracy (Martin 1992).\nDevelop \u201cconstructive thinking\u201d as a social activity\nin a community of physically embodied and socially embedded inquirers\nwith personal voices who value not only reason but also imagination,\nintuition and emotion (Thayer-Bacon 2000).\nIn developing critical thinking in school subjects, treat as\nimportant neither skills nor dispositions but opening worlds of\nmeaning (Alston 2001).\nAttend to the development of critical thinking dispositions as\nwell as skills, and adopt the \u201ccritical pedagogy\u201d\npractised and advocated by Freire (1968 [1970]) and hooks (1994)\n(Dalgleish, Girard, & Davies 2017).\n\n\nA common thread in these proposals is treatment of critical thinking\nas a social, interactive, personally engaged activity like that of a\nquilting bee or a barn-raising (Thayer-Bacon 2000) rather than as an\nindividual, solitary, distanced activity symbolized by Rodin\u2019s\nThe Thinker. One can get a vivid description of education\nwith the former type of goal from the writings of bell hooks (1994,\n2010). Critical thinking for her is open-minded dialectical exchange\nacross opposing standpoints and from multiple perspectives, a\nconception similar to Paul\u2019s \u201cstrong sense\u201d critical\nthinking (Paul 1981). She abandons the structure of domination in the\ntraditional classroom. In an introductory course on black women\nwriters, for example, she assigns students to write an\nautobiographical paragraph about an early racial memory, then to read\nit aloud as the others listen, thus affirming the uniqueness and value\nof each voice and creating a communal awareness of the diversity of\nthe group\u2019s experiences (hooks 1994: 84). Her \u201cengaged\npedagogy\u201d is thus similar to the \u201cfreedom under\nguidance\u201d implemented in John Dewey\u2019s Laboratory School of\nChicago in the late 1890s and early 1900s. It incorporates the\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring that Abrami (2015) found\nto be most effective in improving critical thinking skills and\ndispositions.\n12.3 Relationship of Critical Thinking to Other Types of Thinking\n\nWhat is the relationship of critical thinking to problem solving,\ndecision-making, higher-order thinking, creative thinking, and other\nrecognized types of thinking? One\u2019s answer to this question\nobviously depends on how one defines the terms used in the question.\nIf critical thinking is conceived broadly to cover any careful\nthinking about any topic for any purpose, then problem solving and\ndecision making will be kinds of critical thinking, if they are done\ncarefully. Historically, \u2018critical thinking\u2019 and\n\u2018problem solving\u2019 were two names for the same thing. If\ncritical thinking is conceived more narrowly as consisting solely of\nappraisal of intellectual products, then it will be disjoint with\nproblem solving and decision making, which are constructive.\n\nBloom\u2019s taxonomy of educational objectives used the phrase\n\u201cintellectual abilities and skills\u201d for what had been\nlabeled \u201ccritical thinking\u201d by some, \u201creflective\nthinking\u201d by Dewey and others, and \u201cproblem solving\u201d\nby still others (Bloom et al. 1956: 38). Thus, the so-called\n\u201chigher-order thinking skills\u201d at the taxonomy\u2019s top\nlevels of analysis, synthesis and evaluation are just critical\nthinking skills, although they do not come with general criteria for\ntheir assessment (Ennis 1981b). The revised version of Bloom\u2019s\ntaxonomy (Anderson et al. 2001) likewise treats critical thinking as\ncutting across those types of cognitive process that involve more than\nremembering (Anderson et al. 2001: 269\u2013270). For details, see\nthe\n Supplement on History.\n\nAs to creative thinking, it overlaps with critical thinking (Bailin\n1987, 1988). Thinking about the explanation of some phenomenon or\nevent, as in\n Ferryboat,\n requires creative imagination in constructing plausible explanatory\nhypotheses. Likewise, thinking about a policy question, as in\n Candidate,\n requires creativity in coming up with options. Conversely, creativity\nin any field needs to be balanced by critical appraisal of the draft\npainting or novel or mathematical theory.\n",
