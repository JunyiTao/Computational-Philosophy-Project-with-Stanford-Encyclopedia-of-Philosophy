    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || The dependence solution\n2.5 The dependence solution\n\nOne of the best-known Ockhamist proposals after Adams was made by\nAlvin Plantinga (1986), who defined the accidentally necessary in\nterms of lack of counterfactual power. For someone, Jones, to have\ncounterfactual power over God\u2019s past beliefs, the following must\nbe true:\n\n(CPP) It was within\nJones\u2019 power at t2 to do something such that\nif he did it, God would not have held the belief he in fact held at\nt1.\n\n\nPlantinga argued that counterfactual power over God\u2019s past\nbeliefs about human free choices is coherent and if it occurs, these\nbeliefs are not accidentally necessary; they do not have the kind of\nnecessity the past is alleged to have in premise (2) of the basic\nargument.\n\nNotice that counterfactual power over the past is not the same thing\nas changing the past. Under the assumption that there is only one time\nline, changing the past is incoherent since it amounts to there being\none past prior to t2 in which God has a certain\nbelief at t1, and then Jones does something to\nmake a different past. That requires two pasts prior to\nt2, and that presumably makes no sense. What (CPP)\naffirms instead is that there is only one actual past, but there would\nhave been a different past if Jones acted differently at\nt2. (CPP) also does not require the assumption\nthat what Jones does at t2 causes God to have the\nbelief he has at t1. There is much debate about\nthe way to analyze the causal relation, but it is generally thought\nthat causation does not reduce to a counterfactual dependency of an\neffect on its cause. The dependency of God\u2019s belief on\nJones\u2019 act need not be a causal dependency. (CPP) is therefore\nweaker than the claim that Jones\u2019 act at t2\ncauses God\u2019s belief at t1. A discussion of\nthe counterfactual dependence of God\u2019s past belief on human\nfuture acts is given in Zagzebski (1991, chap 4).\n\nThe idea that God\u2019s past beliefs depend upon our future free\nacts has been enlivened by Trenton Merricks (2009), who argues that\nthe idea appears in Molina (see section 2.6). There is some question\nhow distinct Merricks\u2019 approach is from classic Ockhamism:\nFischer and Todd (2011, 2013) argue that Merricks\u2019 solution is\nsimply a form of Ockhamism and suffers from the same defects, while\nMerricks (2011) replies that the dependency relation between\nGod\u2019s past beliefs and human acts is different from the one at\nwork in Ockham\u2019s approach. The idea, in any case, is that the\ndependence of God\u2019s foreknowledge of future contingents on the\nforeknown events themselves, including future exercises of human free\nwill, along with the independence of human actions from\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of them, is the key to defending the\ncompatibility of divine foreknowledge and human freedom. This\n\u201cDependence Solution\u201d has gained sufficient currency that\nit deserves a section of its own, regardless of its relationship to\nthe original Ockhamist strategy.\n\nThe Ur-text for this approach is the following passage in\nOrigen of Alexandria\u2019s Commentary on the Epistle to the\nRomans:\n\nit will not be because God knows that an event will occur that it\nhappens; but, because something is going to take place it is known by\nGod before it happens.\n\n\nThe because-relationship in question is stronger than counterfactual\ndependence, because it can be absent even when counterfactual\ndependence is present, as in the case of divine foreknowledge. (Though\nyou won\u2019t answer the phone tomorrow at 9 am because God\nforeknew you would do so, your answering it at 9 tomorrow is\nnevertheless counterfactually dependent on God\u2019s foreknowledge:\nwere God to have believed yesterday that you won\u2019t answer the\nphone at 9 tomorrow, you wouldn\u2019t answer the phone at 9\ntomorrow, and were God to have believed that you will answer at 9, you\nwould answer at 9.) What\u2019s needed is the stronger relationship\nof explanatory dependence.\n\nFischer and Tognazzini (2014), in a response to Merricks (2009, 2011),\nMcCall (2011), and Westphal (2011), ask how the dependence point alone\nshows that the hard past isn\u2019t fixed. That would require that\nthe agent upon whose action the past depends really can act otherwise,\nand this is just asserted rather than argued. After all, this is the\nvery point at issue, so simply assuming it is to beg the question. Cyr\nand Law (forthcoming) defend the dialectical appropriateness of the\nassumption that doing and refraining are both open to the agent.\n\nTodd (2013) challenges the courage of dependence theorists\u2019\nconvictions with a scenario in which, instead of simply foreknowing\nthat you will perform a certain action tomorrow, God prepunished you\nfor it yesterday. The explanatory relations are the same in the two\ncases, but your undergoing that punishment yesterday is surely a fixed\nfact about the past, and your performing that action tomorrow is\nsurely unavoidable. We have no less reason to think that God\u2019s\nforeknowledge belongs to the fixed past and that foreknown actions are\nunavoidable. Swenson (2016) and Law (2020) dispute the moral Todd\ndraws from his prepunishment case, appealing to time travel scenarios\nin which some fact about the past depends on what might yet happen in\nthe future, where our intuitions are supposedly more open to the\npossibility that the past isn\u2019t entirely fixed.\n\nSwenson (2016) argues that what\u2019s fixed isn\u2019t the past\nin toto, but so much of the past as isn\u2019t dependent on\nthe future. Rather than modifying the principle of the fixity of the\npast, Law (2020) advocates junking it altogether and replacing it with\nthe principle of the fixity of the independent. Law (2021) continues\nthe case for replacing the fixity of the past with the fixity of the\nindependent by arguing that the former, insofar as the past\nis fixed, is derivative from the latter. In two recent\npapers, Ryan Wasserman stakes out positions that differ from most\nother defenders of the dependence solution. After reviewing modal,\ncounterfactual, metaphysical, and logical analyses of explanatory\ndependence, and taking in lessons from time travel cases, Wasserman\n(2021) concludes that causal dependence is the best model for\nunderstanding how God can foreknow what you will do because\nyou will do it, and in Wasserman (forthcoming) he argues that the\ndefense of libertarian freedom against theological fatalism is best\nserved by emphasizing the independence of future actions from\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge rather than the dependence of God\u2019s\nforeknowledge on the foreknown actions.\n\nThe dependence solution redirects attention from the temporal to the\nexplanatory order, in which divine foreknowledge depends on future\nevents while future events do not depend on divine foreknowledge. It\nthen proposes that what\u2019s relevant to assessing libertarian\nagency is the explanatory order--the temporal order is relevant only\ninsofar as it follows the explanatory order, and (when it does follow\nit) because it follows it. Thus a fact about the past, such\nas God\u2019s believing yesterday that T, is irrelevant to\nthe libertarian status of a future action if that fact does not\nexplain, and is instead explained by, that future action. This much is\nconsistent with the past\u2019s being fixed and necessary in just the\nway that premise (2) requires, and consistent with the solution\nwe\u2019ll look at in\n 2.8.\n What the dependence solution adds is that openness in the explanatory\norder overrides the necessity of the past: any facts about the past\nthat aren\u2019t yet explanatorily fixed, aren\u2019t yet temporally\nfixed either. So (2) isn\u2019t true in its full generality, and\ndivine foreknowledge is one of the exceptions, blocking the inference\nto (3).\n\nWhether this additional move is plausible depends on the strength of\none\u2019s intuitions about the necessity of the past. If the police\nare already on the way, summoned by the tachyonic alarm system the\nbank teller is about to activate, not everyone will share the\nintuition that the teller still has the option not to press the alarm\nbutton.\n",
