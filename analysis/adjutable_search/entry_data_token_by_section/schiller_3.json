Later Life and Influence\n\nIn 1796, Schiller\u2019s intensive period of philosophical output\nended and he returned to playwriting. For his first dramatic work in\nten years, the tragic trilogy Wallenstein, Schiller chose a\nhistorical topic with the explicit goal of shifting his writing from\nthe sentimental towards the na\u00efve (Berman 1986; Moland 2011). The\nplays were widely hailed as a success and were followed by four other\nmajor dramas, among them Maria Stuart and Wilhelm\nTell. Schiller continued to write poetry and intensified his\ncollaborations with Goethe, including the co-production of a series of\nepigrams, entitled Xenien, whose sardonic critique of their\ncontemporaries ignited a widespread literary feud (Mohr 2007: 217).\nThis extraordinarily productive period, however, lasted less than a\ndecade, at which point Schiller\u2019s always weak health failed him,\nand he died at the age of forty-five.\n\nSince his death, Schiller\u2019s thought has steadily influenced some\nof philosophy\u2019s most prominent debates. Hegel and Wilhelm von\nHumboldt were early promoters of Schiller\u2019s aesthetic and\npolitical theorizing (Hegel Aesthetics, 89\u201391/62;\nHumboldt, \u201c\u00dcber Schiller\u201d; Price 1967). His influence\non British Romanticism especially through the enthusiasm of Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge was also substantial (Kooy 2002). Marx and Engels\npraised his revolutionary spirit and diagnosis of the modern age but\ncriticized his perceived idealism (Kain 1982: chs. 3, 4; Saranpa 2002:\nch. 5). Schiller\u2019s reputation suffered greatly from its\ndeployment in the 1914 \u201cWar of the Intellectuals\u201d between\nEngland and Germany and from misuse of his thought by National\nSocialists in subsequent decades (Koepke 2005: 276\u2013279; Martin\n2011; Sharpe 1995: chs. 2 and 3; Sponsel 2011). A divided post-war\nGermany saw Schiller\u2019s fame employed in support of competing\npolitical philosophies in the German Democratic Republic and the\nFederal Republic of Germany (Sharpe 2005: 58; Saranpa 2002: ch. 6).\nMore recently, his vision of an \u201caesthetically permeated\nculture\u201d has been cited as a predecessor to \u201cmodern\nmass-media studies\u201d (Fischer 2011: 133); his analysis of\nthe French Revolution has been mined for its lessons on the\nuse of aesthetics in marketing and political propaganda (Mandoki\n2019); his thought has also been used in philosophical work on\nthe emotions (Bennett 2017). A 2018 volume on Schiller and\nphilosophy highlights his importance to other philosophical\nfigures, including the development of German Romanticism and\nphilosophical pessimism, and to the thought of French philosopher\nJacques Ranci\u00e8re (Acosta L\u00f3pez and Powell 2018). Also in\n2018, a special issue of Kant-Studien was devoted to\n\u201cFriedrich Schiller's Challenge to Moral\nPhilosophy.\u201d  Schiller's was, in short, a vision of\nthe centrality of aesthetic experience to daily and political life\nthat has resonated through the centuries since his death and continues\nto shape philosophical thought today.\n",
