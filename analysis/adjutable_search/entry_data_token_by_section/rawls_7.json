    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Legitimacy: The Liberal Principle of Legitimacy\n3.1 Legitimacy: The Liberal Principle of Legitimacy\n\nIn a democracy, political power is always the power of the people as a\ncollective body. In light of the diversity within a democracy, what\nwould it mean for citizens legitimately to exercise coercive political\npower over one another? Rawls\u2019s test for the acceptable use of\npolitical power in a democracy is his liberal principle of\nlegitimacy:\n\nOur exercise of political power is fully proper only when it is\nexercised in accordance with a constitution the essentials of which\nall citizens as free and equal may reasonably be expected to endorse\nin the light of principles and ideals acceptable to their common human\nreason (PL, 137).\n\n\nAccording to this principle, political power may only be used in ways\nthat all citizens can reasonably be expected to endorse. The use of\npolitical power must fulfill a criterion of reciprocity:\ncitizens must reasonably believe that all citizens can reasonably\naccept the enforcement of a particular set of basic laws. Those\ncoerced by law must be able to endorse the society\u2019s fundamental\npolitical arrangements freely, not because they are dominated or\nmanipulated or kept uninformed.\n\nThe liberal principle of legitimacy intensifies the challenge of\nlegitimacy: how can any particular set of basic laws legitimately be\nimposed upon a pluralistic citizenry? What constitution could all\ncitizens reasonably be expected to endorse? Rawls\u2019s answer to\nthis challenge begins by explaining what it means for citizens to be\nreasonable.\n",
