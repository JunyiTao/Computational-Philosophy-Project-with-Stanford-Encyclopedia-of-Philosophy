    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Non-rational Minds\n5.2 Non-rational Minds\n\nIn the discussion of perception in\n \u00a72\n we saw that the case of non-rational animals raises a variety of\ninterpretive challenges. But the animal case also raises special\nchallenges for Intellectualism, for it is not clear how\nIntellectualism is compatible with attributing representations of\nany sort to non-rational beings.\n\nKant is extremely clear on the point that non-rational animals lack an\nintellect, in the sense that they lack the capacity for use of the\nfirst-person concept, and with it any of the \u2018higher\u2019\ncognitive faculties of understanding, judgment, or reason (An\n7:127; LM 28:277 (c. 1777\u201380); LA 25:1215 (c. 1784/5)). Hence,\nif one were to deny that, according to Kant, sensibility alone is\ncapable of producing mental states that were cognitively significant\nin character, then it would seem that any animal that lacks a faculty\nof understanding, and thus the capacity for any intellectual or\nconceptual synthesis, would thereby lack not only a capacity for\nthought but also any capacity for perceptual experience. The mental\nlives of non-rational animals would thus, at best, consist of\nessentially unconscious, non-cognitive sensory states that causally\ncorrelate with changes in the animal\u2019s environment. It is not\nclear that we should characterize such states as representations, in\nKant\u2019s sense, at all.\n\nAside from what we now consider to be a straightforwardly false\ncharacterization of the cognitive capacities of animals, this\nnon-cognitive reading faces textual hurdles. Kant claims that animals\nenjoy mental representations, and that postulating such\nrepresentations is necessary for explaining sophisticated animal\nbehavior. Kant is on record in various places as saying that animals\nhave sensory representations of their environment (CPJ 5:464; cf. An\n7:212), that they have intuitions (LM 28:449 (c. 1784/85); LM 28:594\n(c. 1790/91); LL 24:702 (c. 1792); OP 21:82), and that they are\nacquainted with objects though they do not cognize them (JL\n9:64\u20135; see also Notes on Logic 16:342\u20134 (c.\nmid/late 1760s); LL 24:845ff (c. 1780\u20131); LL 24:730\u20131 (c.\n1792)). However, interpretation of these texts, and others, is not\nuncontested (e.g., Fisher 2017; van den Berg 2018; see also the\nsources cited in\n \u00a72\n above). It is also not entirely clear that Kant\u2019s views on this\nmatter remain consistent throughout his career, with some arguing that\nat least his pre-critical views are clearly incompatible with a\ncognitivist position regarding animal minds (Leland 2018a,b).\n\nIf it is correct to read Kant as at least entertaining the possibility\nof a cognitivist position regarding animal minds, then Intellectualism\nfaces a challenge. Intellectualism construes Kant as claiming that\nsynthetic acts carried out by the intellect are necessary for the\ncognitive standing of a mental state. But if this is correct\nthen\u2014on the cognitivist reading of the animal mind\u2014Kant is\ncontradicting fundamental elements of his own position in crediting\nintuitions (or their possibility) to non-rational animals. In contrast\nSensibilism has no problem accommodating the possibility that animals\nhave representations of their environment, and that these\nrepresentations are (potentially) conscious and thus count as\nintuitions.\n\nOne way of replying to this challenge that may not require endorsing\nnon-cognitivism with respect to animal minds is to allow that\nnon-rational minds may well have some way of representing the world,\nbut posit that rational minds constitute an altogether different\nkind of mind than their non-rational counterparts. On this view,\nrational and non-rational animality are conceived as two completely\ndifferent species of animality whose generic similarity does not\nrequire that there share any of the same fundamental mental capacities\n(Herder 1772 [2002: 81\u201387]; Hegel 1830/1991: \u00a72; McDowell\n1996: ch. 6; Boyle 2012, 2016, 2017; Conant 2016; Land 2018). On this\nview, \u201crational\u201d does not specify some characteristic\namong others of a creature, but rather its \u201cdistinctive manner\nof having characteristics\u201d (Boyle 2012: 410). Thus rationality\n\u201ctransforms\u201d the manner in which a rational creature has\nother kinds of mental state (e.g., experience and desire) and is not\nmerely added to an otherwise independently characterizable stock of\nthe creature\u2019s mental powers.\n\nMoreover, according to its proponents, a central reason for holding\nthis \u201ctransformative\u201d view of rationality is that it is\nthe only way to explain how sensory experience and desire can play\nproperly rationalizing roles in our cognition and action (Boyle 2016;\nsee also\n \u00a75.1).\n And since rational and non-rational minds are construed as radically\ndifferent, this view allows that non-rational minds might have their\nown sorts of (non-rational) intuitive representations, thus avoiding\nany attribution of contradictory claims to Kant.\n",
