A good human life is one that\nexercises one\u2019s higher capacities (I 11, 20; III 1\u201310); a\nperson\u2019s higher capacities include her deliberative capacities,\nin particular, capacities to form, revise, assess, select, and\nimplement her own plan of life. This kind of self-government requires\nboth positive and negative conditions. Among the positive conditions\nit requires is an education that develops deliberative competence by\nproviding understanding of different historical periods and social\npossibilities, developing cultural and aesthetic sensibilities,\ndeveloping skills essential for critical reasoning and assessment, and\ncultivating habits of intellectual curiosity, modesty, and\nopen-mindedness (V 12\u201315). Among the negative conditions that\nself-government requires are various liberties of thought and action.\nIf the choice and pursuit of projects and plans is to be deliberate,\nit must be informed as to the alternatives and their grounds, and this\nrequires intellectual freedoms of speech, association, and press that\nexpand the menu of deliberative options and allow for the vivid\nrepresentation of the comparative merits of options on that menu. If\nthere is to be choice and implementation of choices, there must be\nliberties of action such as freedom of association, freedom of\nworship, and freedom to choose one\u2019s occupation.\n\nIndeed, liberties of thought and action are importantly related. This\nis apparent in the pre-eminent value Mill assigns to diversity and\nexperimentation in life-style. Indeed, in his Autobiography\nMill describes this as the central truth of On Liberty:\n\n\nThe importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of\ncharacter, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself\nin innumerable and conflicting directions. (Autobiography\n259)\n\n\nDiversity and experimentation in life-style are important not only\ninsofar as they are expressions of self-government but also insofar as\nthey enhance self-government. For experimentation and diversity of\nlife-style expand the deliberative menu and bring out more clearly the\nnature and merits of options on the menu (OL II 23, 38; III\n1).\n",
