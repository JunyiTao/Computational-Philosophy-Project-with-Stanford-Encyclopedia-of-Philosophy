Transforming Traditional Theism and Process Theism\n\nWhitehead says that, \u201cPhilosophy never reverts to its old\nposition after the shock of a great philosopher\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 11]). Whether or not Whitehead and Hartshorne are considered\ngreat philosophers, they seem to have occasioned a seismic shift in\ncontemporary discussions of the philosophy of religion in which\nphilosophers take the doctrine of real relations in God more\nseriously. For example, some Neo-Thomists have taken the criticisms of\nprocess theism to heart and admitted real relations in God, contrary\nto the teaching of the angelic doctor (Whitney 1985, 75\u201381). The\nJesuit philosopher W. Norris Clarke advises Thomists to \u201csimply\ndrop\u201d the doctrine of the lack of real relations in God and to\nadopt the view that, \u201c[God\u2019s] consciousness is\ncontingently and qualitatively different because of what we\ndo\u201d (Clarke 1979, 92). At times, Clarke almost sounds like a\nWhiteheadian or a Hartshornean: \u201cGod is the supreme\nReceiver, gathering together in His consciousness all that\ncreatures do and responding appropriately to it\u201d (Ibid., 93).\nAnother example of a group of theists influenced by process thinking,\nare those Evangelical Christian philosophers calling themselves\n\u201copen theists\u201d or \u201cfree will theists.\u201d While\ncareful to distance themselves from the more heretical dimensions of\nprocess metaphysics, they have stirred controversy in their\ncommunities of faith by defending aspects of process theism (Pinnock\net al. 1994; Enxing 2013, ch. 5; Rice 2020).\n\nThe extent to which theists outside the process camp accept the\nelements of the doctrine of dual transcendence varies greatly.\nNeo-Thomists like Clarke and some other theists, like William Alston,\naccept real relations in God but retain the timelessness,\nimmutability, and non-corporeality of God. Clarke and Alston also\naffirm creation ex nihilo. Alston, who was Hartshorne\u2019s\nstudent at Chicago, refers to his view as a \u201cvia\nmedia\u201d (a middle path) between Hartshorne and Aquinas (Cobb\n& Gamwell 1984, 78f). Hartshorne responded to both Clarke and\nAlston (Sia 1990, 269f; Cobb & Gamwell 1984, 98f). In both replies\nhe emphasizes, among other things, what he takes to be arbitrary\ndivisions among contingency, potentiality, and change in their\ntheories. To admit real relations in God is to admit contingency in\nGod. To admit this, but to retain the concept of the non-temporality\nof deity, requires belief in contingencies eternally fixed in the\nbeing of God. The ordinary sense of \u201cW is\ncontingent\u201d is \u201cW could have been\notherwise,\u201d which presupposes that the future was once open with\nrespect to W. Since there is no future in eternity, to speak\nof contingency in eternity is to lose one\u2019s anchor in ordinary\nlanguage which is saturated with temporal reference. Likewise, the\nconcept of an eternal \u201cnow\u201d has lost all moorings with\nexperience where the present is invariably nested between past and\nfuture. Hartshorne also maintains that there are forms of\nvalue\u2014specifically, aesthetic values\u2014that do not admit of\na maximum. It may be no more meaningful to speak of greatest possible\naesthetic value than it is to speak of a greatest positive integer\n(Hartshorne 1970, 38 and 310; cf. Whitehead 1929 [1978, 111]). If this is the\ncase, and if the creatures contribute to the aesthetic value of the\nworld, then there must be respects in which, as the aesthetic value of\nthe world increases, God increases with it. We have already touched\nupon this aspect of process theism which Hartshorne refers to as\nGod\u2019s relative perfection (R-perfection).\n\nOpenness or free will theists are closer to process theism than the\nNeo-Thomists or than Alston. They concur with process theists that God\ncannot determine a creature\u2019s decisions without depriving it of\nits freedom. They also accept the process view of the nature of time;\nthus, for God to be influenced by the creatures means that in some\nrespects the future is yet to be determined and God knows it as such.\nThis provides for a straightforward concept of God responding to the\ncreatures and for an interpretive scheme for the dominant Scriptural\nmotif that God is in dynamic interaction with people (in answering\nprayer, for example). On the other hand, it is this aspect of process\ntheism which seems most disturbing to more traditionally minded\nEvangelicals, for the lack of knowledge of a detailed future\ncompromises or at least complicates the doctrine of divine providence.\nHow, they ask, can history be the working out of a divine plan if the\nfuture is uncertain for God (cf. Hall and Sanders, 2003). Open theists\nbelieve that they can mitigate this criticism by not following process\ntheism in the denial of creation ex nihilo. Open theists like\nWilliam Hasker and John Sanders can speak of God as \u201ca\nrisk-taker,\u201d but they insist that God can still perform miracles\nand guarantee the ultimate triumph of good over evil (Pinnock, et al.,\n1994, 151; Sanders 1998).\n\nTo speak of open theism as a school of thought distinct from process\ntheism is ironic since God\u2019s openness to creaturely influence is\nprecisely the shared content of their views. Hartshorne referred to\n\u201cthe openness of God\u201d in 1963, more than thirty years\nbefore the openness controversy erupted (Hartshorne 1987, 92). In any\nevent, these controversies began too late for Hartshorne to respond to\nthem. It is noteworthy, however, that he was instrumental in bringing\na little known forerunner of open theism, Jules Lequyer [or Lequier],\nto the attention of philosophers (Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000,\n227\u2013230]). Because of the dominance historically of classical\ntheism, Hartshorne viewed free will or open theists more as allies\nthan foes, although he was fully aware of his differences from them\nand was not without arguments against those aspects of their views\nwith which he disagreed (Viney 1998, 214\u2013230). A vigorous\ndialogue between process theists and free will theists is on-going\n(Cobb and Pinnock 2000; Ramal 2010, part II).\n\nThe most contentious issue is creation ex nihilo. Whitehead\nand Hartshorne share a commitment to the idea that God is the supreme\ncreative power among many lesser creators. Hartshorne is adamant that\nnothing is gained by endowing God with the ability to create\nnon-creative actualities or to refrain from creating altogether.\nNevertheless, process theists are criticized for failing to consider\nthe alternative that God, the sole origin of creative power,\ngraciously shares that power with others. Lequyer speaks of\n\u201cGod, who created me creator of myself\u201d\u2014words that\nHartshorne often quotes with approval (Lequier 1952, 70; Hartshorne\n1970, xi). Lequyer\u2019s view is similar to what Nelson Pike calls\n\u201cover-power,\u201d the power to \u201ccompletely determine\nwhich, if any, powers are possessed by agents other than\noneself\u201d (Pike 1983, 19). Pike avers that over-power is\nprecisely what most classical theists ascribe to deity. Process\ntheists generally disagree (cf. Griffin 1991, 67\u201368). For\nexample, Aquinas views God as having the ability to determine the free\ndecisions of others, but this ability is not entailed by\nover-power, although Pike sometimes defines over-power in these terms\n(Pike 1982, 151). If God has over-power in the sense of being able to\ndetermine the extent to which others can make free decisions and\nexecute them, it does not follow that God can also determine a\ncreature\u2019s free decisions. The latter claim is much stronger,\nand it is the one that process theists attribute to most classical\ntheists.\n\nThe process God has what might be called a second cousin to\nover-power. As we have seen, in process theism, God is responsible for\nthe laws of nature and these laws determine the limits of non-divine\ncreativity. Whitehead and Hartshorne deny, however, that God could\ncreate actual entities devoid of creative activity. Moreover,\ndevelopmental and evolutionary categories are central to their\nthinking. It is contrary to process philosophy to imagine God with the\nability to create a fully grown man or woman who did not grow to\nadulthood from having been a child. One\u2019s being actual\nis inseparable from one\u2019s having become actual\n(Hartshorne 1941, 233\u2013234). Hartshorne would say that this is\nalso true of God\u2019s actual states, though not of God\u2019s\nexistence. These qualifications notwithstanding, one philosopher\nworking within the process tradition advocates revisions in process\ntheism that would move it in the direction that the critics suggest.\nRem Edwards speaks of divine self-limitation in creating the\ncreatures. For Edwards, God could create a universe of uncreative\nbeings but chooses not to. He thinks that God could \u201cwork an\noccasional miracle or two.\u201d Edwards acknowledges that, from the\nstandpoint of \u201corthodox\u201d process thought, these ideas are\n\u201cprocess heresy,\u201d but he prefers revising process theism\nin these ways in order to avoid the charge, which he regards as\nlegitimate, that there is a \u201cdivine power-deficit\u201d in\nprocess theism that makes its outlook \u201creligiously\nintolerable\u201d (Edwards 2001, 256).\n\nThe claim that deity sharing its creative power is an instance of\nself-limitation can perhaps be clarified and placed more in the spirit\nof process theism by referring to it as divine\nself-augmentation. A self-imposed handicap is one that prevents\none from achieving a goal or performing a task that one could\naccomplish without the limitation. As Inbody notes, any divine\nself-limitation can be \u201cself-unlimited\u201d (Inbody 1997,\n149). For example, a governor on a truck can be designed to inhibit\nthe velocity it could attain without the governor. In creating other\ncreators, however, the deity imposes no limits on what it could\nachieve without them. To be sure, God could have unerring knowledge of\na determinate future if the creatures had no freedom, but this would\nnot be knowledge of a future with free creatures in it. To imagine a\nlimitation in this case would require that God could know the future\ndecisions of free creatures, but chooses instead to put on a\nblindfold, so to speak. On the other hand, the existence of non-divine\ncreators opens opportunities for cooperative effort (and conflict)\nthat would be impossible without them. One cannot use persuasion on\ncompletely unfree beings. Thus, in creating other creators, other\nbeings with some degree of freedom, God would be perfecting the divine\npower and the uses to which it can be put.\n\nEdwards also affirms a version of the doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo and believes that this is compatible with process theism.\nInspired by developments in speculative cosmology among\nastrophysicists\u2014which he insists is really\nmetaphysics\u2014Edwards asks whether our universe may not be one of\nmany actual universes existing within an infinite Superspacetime. This\nsuper matrix of co-existing but independent universes could be\ninterpreted by process theism as the divine body, much as Hartshorne\nviews our universe as God\u2019s body. Edwards maintains that these\nideas allow for a concept of creation ex nihilo. Within the\ndivine Superspacetime, God can create universes from no pre-existing\nmaterial. Thus, it is not necessary to conceive our own universe as\ncreated from the dying embers of a previous cosmic epoch. The initial\nsingularity of our universe could represent an absolute beginning.\nThis does not mean that one must jettison the claims of process theism\nthat God is necessarily social, embodied, and creative. In\nEdwards\u2019 words:\n\nWithin infinite Divine Superspacetime, God could be infinitely loving,\nsocial, embodied, and creative without being tied to a single temporal\nstrand of spatially finite antecedent-and-successive universes. Within\ninfinite Superspace and throughout infinite Supertime, God could\ncreate many co-existing universes out of nothing \u2026. (Edwards\n2001, 262)\n\n\nEdwards notes that his suggestions are not as far removed from the\nmetaphysics of Whitehead and Hartshorne as one might suppose.\nWhitehead speaks of cosmic epochs and Hartshorne argues that this\ninvolves a time beyond what is available to physics that connects\nvarious cosmic epochs (Hartshorne 1970, 53\u201354). Edwards views\nhimself as amending Hartshorne\u2019s idea to include super space as\nwell as super time.\n\nEdwards\u2019 treatment of creation ex nihilo retains the\nessential meaning of the idea\u2014creation from no pre-existing\nmaterial\u2014but it also suggests both less and more than the\nconcept as it was expressed in classical theism. It suggests less in\nthe sense that God\u2019s creative act in traditional theism takes\nplace in eternity. Superspacetime differs from the Boethian idea of\neternity in at least this much: it is complex whereas eternity has no\nparts. Edwards also wishes to avoid the deterministic connotations of\nthe traditional idea of creation. To create another creator is\nnot to create that creator\u2019s decisions; this is one\nreason Aquinas denies that God creates other creators, for he regards\nGod as creating, with us, the decisions we make in such a way that\nGod\u2019s activity is a sufficient explanation of our decisions\n(although he denies, contrary to the charge of process theism, that\nthis deprives us of our freedom). Finally, Edwards imports more into\nthe idea of creation ex nihilo than was traditionally in the\ndoctrine. As we noted in the opening section, the idea that the\nuniverse had a first temporal moment is not to be identified with\ncreation ex nihilo since, according to traditional theism,\nGod could have created a temporally infinite universe ex\nnihilo.\n\nEdwards\u2019 revisions of process theism are made largely, though\nnot exclusively, in light of criticisms from those who do not share\nhis commitment to process metaphysics. Lewis Ford revises process\ntheism in a very different direction, mostly in response to\ndifficulties within process metaphysics that he finds insurmountable.\nWe have already seen that in Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics, the way\nthat one actual entity influences another is by means of prehensions.\nAccording to Ford, an additional mode of influence must be posited,\nfor one must account for an actual entity\u2019s ability to\nprehend. This ability to prehend is precisely its portion of\ncreativity. Ford remains within the parameters of process metaphysics\nby denying that the entity\u2019s allotment of creativity has its\nsource outside of time in an eternal being. This leaves only three\npossible sources for the entity\u2019s creativity, the past, the\npresent, or the future. Ford maintains that past actual entities,\nbecause they are past, are devoid of any inner creativity\u2014thus,\nthey cannot be the source of an actual entity\u2019s creativity. Nor\ncan creativity simply \u201cwell up\u201d from within the present.\nIt is precisely an actual occasion\u2019s present creativity\nthat needs explanation, and it cannot pull itself up by its own\nbootstraps, so to speak. Ford argues, by elimination, that a future\ncreativity must be the source of an occasion\u2019s ability to\nprehend.\n\nIn process metaphysics, the future is infinite, indeterminate, and its\npossibilities for actualization are inexhaustible. Ford identifies God\nwith the future so conceived, but with one important departure from\nstandard accounts in process thought. According to Ford, God is\nthe activity of the future. This is contrary to the views of\nWhitehead and Hartshorne for whom the future is the arena of\npossibility awaiting decision. Creative activity is confined to the\npresent actual entity (called its concrescence) and to its effects on\nsubsequent actual entities (called transitional creativity) (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 211]). In Ford\u2019s view, however, the future is a soundless\ndepth of creativity that endlessly \u201cpluralizes itself into the\nmany finite regions of the present\u201d (Ford 2000, 248). This is a\nprocess whereby divine future activity is \u201cinfused\u201d into\nthe present actual occasion (Ibid., 253). In Ford\u2019s view,\npresent activity makes the past in the sense that what is\ndone today adds to what will be the accomplished past of tomorrow. The\npresent is not made by the past but by the divine activity of the\nfuture.\n\nBecause the divine is indeterminate, it cannot be an object of an\nactual entity\u2019s prehensions. This is dangerously close to saying\nthat God cannot be known, except that Ford understands God to fill a\ndefinite role in his metaphysics, to wit, the infusion of creativity\ninto the present, providing for an immediacy of the divine presence in\nall actualities. Ford also recognizes the difficulty that his view\nposes for God\u2019s knowledge of the past, and hence for divine\nomniscience. The physical prehensions of actual occasions are not only\nthe means whereby the present takes account of the past, but they are\nalso the means whereby the past persists into the present. As\nHartshorne notes, Whitehead\u2019s concept of prehension brings\nefficient causation and perception under a single category (Hartshorne\n1984b, chapter 9). If the past were to persist into the future so as\nto impart knowledge to God, it would co-opt the present\u2019s\nfunction of preserving the past. In order to avoid the idea that God\nis ignorant of the past, Ford posits a kind of knowledge of the past\nthat abstracts from efficient causation. In the interstices separating\nthe death of the past moment and the birth of the present moment,\n\u201cGod immediately perceives the recently emergent past and\nretains that memory forever\u201d (Ford 2000, 284). Since divine\nmemory, on Ford\u2019s account, abstracts from efficient causal\nrelations, it is clear that it records sequences and correlations of\nevents; it is a fair question whether it also contains information\nabout causal chains.\n\nFord recognizes that his revisions of process theism will strike some\nthinkers as contrary to the metaphysics that first inspired it. He\ncorrectly observes, \u201cThe notion of an active future may be\nregarded as oxymoronic, even as bizarre, but it is certainly\nunique\u201d (Ford 2000, 316). It is indeed unique; it bears a\nresemblance to the Thomistic doctrine of participated being, albeit\ntailored to the categories of process philosophy, as modified in\nvarious ways by Ford. In Thomism, the creatures can exist only by\nparticipating in and channeling the infinite creativity of God. In\nFord\u2019s revised process theism, non-divine actual entities can\nexist only by borrowing the influx of future divine activity into the\npresent. The parallel with Thomism breaks down insofar as Ford denies\nthat God\u2019s activity explains what the actual entities do with\ntheir portion of creativity. Ford can affirm the freedom of the\ncreatures vis-a-vis God\u2019s activity since deity does not function\nas a deterministic efficient cause as it does in Thomism and other\nforms of traditional theism. In Whitehead\u2019s and\nHartshorne\u2019s theism, there is an efficient causal dimension to\nGod\u2019s creativity, but it is not deterministic. We have already\nnoted that the process God\u2019s fixing of the laws of nature is a\nform of efficient causation, but Whitehead and Hartshorne agree with\nmost current scientific thinking that those laws are stochastic.\n",
