Critical Reactions to Quine\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the radical character of the view defended,\nQuine\u2019s \u201cEpistemology Naturalized\u201d has been\nsubjected to heavy\n criticism.[7]\n In this Section, we briefly consider a number of specific objections\nto it that have been presented. As we will see, some of these are more\neasily met, at least prima facie, than others. Others, geared\nas they are towards Quine\u2019s arguments and position in particular, are of\nless general interest. Others still raise issues facing all versions\nof NE\u2014they remain front and center in current discussions of NE\nand its prospects.\n",
