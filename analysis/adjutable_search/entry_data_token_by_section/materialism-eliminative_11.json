    "main_text": "Arguments Against Eliminative Materialism || Rejecting the Theory-Theory\n4.2 Rejecting the Theory-Theory\n\nIn section 2, we saw that eliminative materialism typically rests upon\na particular understanding of the nature of folk psychology. The next\ncriticism of eliminative materialism challenges the various\ncharacterizations of folk psychology provided by its\nadvocates\u2014in particular the view set forth by advocates of the\ntheory-theory. This criticism comes from two very distinct traditions.\nThe first tradition is at least partly due to the writings of\nWittgenstein (1953) and Ryle (1949), and insists that (contra many\neliminativists) common sense psychology is not a quasi-scientific\ntheory used to explain or predict behavior, nor does it treat mental\nstates like beliefs as discrete inner causes of behavior (Bogdan,\n1991; Haldane, 1988; Hannan, 1993; Wilkes, 1993). What folk psychology\nactually does treat beliefs and desires as is much less clear in this\ntradition. One perspective (Dennett, 1987) is that propositional\nattitudes are actually dispositional states that we use to adopt a\ncertain heuristic stance toward rational agents. According to this\nview, our talk about mental states should be interpreted as talk about\nabstracta that, although real, are not candidates for straightforward\nreduction or elimination as the result of cognitive science research.\nMoreover, since beliefs and other mental states are used for so many\nthings besides the explanation of human behavior, it is far from clear\nthat our explanatory theories about inner workings of the mind/brain\nhave much relevance for their actual status.\n\nDefenders of eliminative materialism often point out that folk\ntheories typically have many functions beyond explaining and\npredicting, but that doesn\u2019t alter their theoretical status nor\ninoculate their posits from elimination (P.M. Churchland, 1993).\nMoreover, as we saw at the end of Section 2.1, while eliminativists\nhave typically framed the vulnerability of commonsense mental notions\nin terms of a false folk psychological theory, it is important to note\nthat, at least in principle, eliminativism does not require such an\nassumption. Indeed, eliminativism only requires two basic claims: 1)\nthat we share concepts of mental states that include some\nsort of requirements that any state or structure must meet to qualify\nas a mental state of that sort, and 2) the world is such that nothing\ncomes close to meeting those requirements. The first of these claims\nis not terribly controversial and while the requirements for beliefs\nmight come as part of an explanatory theory, they don\u2019t need to.\nHence, one common criticism of eliminativism\u2014that our invoking\nof beliefs and desires is not a theoretical or quasi-scientific\nendeavor\u2014has very limited force. Cherubs, presumably, are not\npart of any sort of quasi-scientific theory, yet this alone is no\nreason to think they might exist. Even if it should turn out that we\ndo not (or do not simply) posit beliefs and other propositional\nattitudes as part of some sort of explanatory-predictive framework, it\nmay still turn out that there are no such things.\n\nThe second perspective criticizing the theory-theory is based on\nresearch in contemporary cognitive science, and stems from a different\nmodel of the nature of our explanatory and predictive practices\n(Gordon, 1986, 1992; Goldman, 1992). Known as the\n \u201csimulation theory\u201d,\n this alternative model holds that we predict and explain behavior not\nby using a theory, but by instead running an off-line simulation of\nhow we would act in a comparable situation. That is, according to this\npicture, we disconnect our own decision-making sub-system and then\nfeed it pretend beliefs and desires (and perhaps other relevant data)\nthat we assume the agent whose behavior we are trying to predict is\nlikely to possess. This allows us to generate both predictions and\nexplanations of others by simply employing cognitive machinery that we\nalready possess. In effect, the simulation theory claims that our\nreasoning about the minds and behavior of others is not significantly\ndifferent from putting ourselves in their shoes. Thus, no full-blown\ntheory of the mind is ever needed. Simulations theorists claim that,\ncontrary to the assumptions of eliminative materialism, no theory of\nthe mind exists that could one day prove false.\n\nBoth sides of this debate between the theory-theory and the simulation\ntheory have used empirical work from developmental psychology to\nsupport their case (Stich and Nichols, 1992; Gordon, 1992). For\nexample, theory-theorists have noted that developmental psychologists\nlike Henry Wellman and Alison Gopnik have used various findings to\nsuggest that children go through phases that are analogous to the\nphases one would go through when acquiring a theory (Gopnik and\nWellman, 1992). Moreover, children appear to ascribe beliefs to\nthemselves in the same way they ascribe beliefs to others.\nTheory-theorists have used considerations such as these to support\ntheir claim that our notion of belief is employed as the posit of a\nfolk theory rather than input to a simulation model. At the same time,\nsimulation theorists have employed the finding that 3-year-olds\nstruggle with false belief ascriptions to suggest that children are\nactually ascribing their own knowledge to others, something that might\nbe expected on the simulation account (Gordon, 1986).\n\nHowever the debate between simulation theorists and theory theorists\nturns out, or whether some sort of hybrid combination of the two\nproves correct, we should once again bear in mind the point made at\nthe end of Section 2.1. Since even the most ardent simulation theorist\nwill allow that we have mental concepts, it is doubtful that the\nsimulation perspective actually poses a significant threat to\neliminativism, and it seems possible for there to be a version of\neliminative materialism that could be reconstructed within the\nsimulation framework, even for beliefs and desires. For example, it is\nat least conceivable that the decision-making machinery that is taken\noff-line to simulate the reasoning of another person could take as\ninput cognitive states other than beliefs and desires, but that we\nsomehow mistakenly conceptualize as beliefs and desires. On\nthis admittedly speculative scenario, our ability to predict and\nexplain the behavior of others would be simulation-based, and yet our\nconception of how minds work would be so far off that an eliminativist\nverdict would be appropriate.\n",
