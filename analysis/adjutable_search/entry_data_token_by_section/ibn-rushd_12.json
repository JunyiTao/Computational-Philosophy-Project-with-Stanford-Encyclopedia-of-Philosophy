    "main_text": "Reception || Hebrew\n9.2 Hebrew\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophy quickly found a second home in Judaism,\nwhere it became so prominent as even to supplant Aristotle as the\nparamount authority in philosophy and science (Harvey 2000). The first\nand critical event was Maimonides\u2019 acquisition of Ibn\nRushd\u2019s commentaries, perhaps around 1190. His subsequent praise\nof this work precipitated a four-century fascination with Ibn Rushd\namong Jewish philosophers (Harvey 1992), especially focusing on his\ncommentaries but even extending to some of his religious\ntreatises.\n\nAs Jewish authors began to write increasingly in Hebrew, Ibn\nRushd\u2019s texts followed, thanks to a series of Arabic-to-Hebrew\ntranslations from 1230 onward (see Zonta 2010 and, in more detail,\nTamani and Zonta 1997, 31\u201349). By 1340, virtually all of the\ncommentaries were available in Hebrew, even while very little of\nAristotle himself was translated. In parallel with this process,\nJewish authors began to write commentaries on Ibn Rushd, giving rise\nto a extensive series of \u201csupercommentaries\u201d (Glasner\n2011). The leading example of this phenomenon is\n Gersonides\u2019\n series of supercommentaries on Ibn Rushd in the 1320s (Glasner\n1995).\n\nThe extent to which Ibn Rushd took precedence over other sources of\nAristotelianism is quite startling. A typical example is Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera, whose introduction to his thirteenth-century encyclopedia\nclarifies that \u201call that I write are the words of Aristotle as\nexplained in the commentaries of the scholar Averroes, for he was the\nlast of the commentators and he incorporated what was best from the\n[earlier] commentaries\u201d (in\n Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera \u00a74).\n Each of the various types of Rushdian commentary had their champions\nat different times. Here is the advice of Moses Almosnino from the\nsixteenth-century: \u201cdo not squander your time with the epitomes\nand middle commentaries of Averroes, but read only the long\ncommentaries, for if you read the long commentaries carefully you will\nhave no need to read any other book in order to understand anything of\nnatural science\u201d (in Harvey 1985, 61).\n\nOther important figures from the thirteenth century are\n Isaac Albalag\n and\n Isaac Polqar.\n Prominent fourteenth-century figures are Gersonides and Moses Narboni\n(see Hayoun 2005), whose commentary on Ibn Rushd\u2019s theory of\nconjunction has been translated into English along with Ibn\nRushd\u2019s epistle. Prominent names from the fifteenth century\ninclude Abraham Bibago and\n Elijah Del Medigo\n (see Hayoun 2005). Sixteenth-century figures such Abraham de Balmes\nattempt more accurate Latin translations of Ibn Rushd, drawing on\nearlier Arabic-to-Hebrew translations (Ivry 1983, Hasse 2016).\n\nSee also the entries on the\n influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on Judaic thought\n and the\n influence of Islamic thought on Maimonides.\n",
