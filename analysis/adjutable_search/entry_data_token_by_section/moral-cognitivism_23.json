    "main_text": "Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained? || Minimalism as Undermining Non-cognitivism\n5.2 Minimalism as Undermining Non-cognitivism\n\nAnother line of argument with a similar upshot proceeds from\nminimalism of the sort we have already canvassed. Deflationism about\ntruth or truth-aptness can be used to argue that there is no room for\nnon-cognitivism of the sort that succeeds in vindicating much of moral\npractice. If there is no more robust understanding of truth conditions\nthan can be secured by minimalism about truth conditions, it will be\ndifficult for the quasi-realist non-cognitivist to make the\ndistinctive negative semantic claim \u2013 that moral judgements are\nnever true and not the kind of thing that can be true or false. Simple\nmoral sentences may be truth apt if all there is to having truth\nconditions is to meet minimal requirements of having a meaningful use,\nbeing in the right mood, and combining grammatically with other\nsentences to yield more complex embeddings. Furthermore, if the\nminimalist strategy extends to beliefs, so that all there is to being\na belief is to be a state of mind expressible by such minimally\ntruth\u2013apt sentences, moral judgements will be beliefs. The\nquasi-realist program to vindicate as much of ordinary moral practice\nmight thus endanger non-cognitivism when carried to this extreme.\nSuccess would leave us with no way to distinguish plausible\nnon-cognitivism from cognitivism.\n\nMore concretely, some semantic theorists have proposed that all that\nis needed to have minimal truth conditions is for a set of judgments\nto satisfy two constraints: (1) Sentences composed of the relevant\nexpressions must exhibit the syntactic surface features of\nparadigmatic truth-apt sentences such as those used to express\nordinary assertions, and they must embed grammatically in more complex\nsentences such as conditionals, propositional attitude ascriptions,\nand so on. (2) Use of these expressions must exhibit a certain amount\nof discipline so that there are clearly appropriate and inappropriate\nconditions for using them in sentences of the form noted in the first\ncondition (Boghossian 1990, Wright 1993; Divers and Miller 1994).\nNormative discourse seems to meet both of these constraints relatively\nstraightforwardly, and this may mean that moral sentences are\ntruth-apt and that some of them are true (Divers and Miller 1994).\n\nEarly critics of the collapse argument resisted on the basis of an\nalleged constitutive connection between truth-aptness and genuinely\ncognitive states. Such theorists regard it as a platitude about\nindicative sentences that they are conventionally apt for making\nassertions and that assertions express beliefs. If belief-expression\nis one of the criteria for truth-aptness, non-cognitivists will be in\na position to use psychological non-cognitivism as a reason to deny\nthat moral judgments are genuinely representational even when they\nmeet minimalist requirements (Jackson, Oppy, Smith 1994). So-called\nminimal truth conditions can remain part of the quasi-realist program\nonly so long as this is compatible with denying that moral judgements\nexpress beliefs.\n\nPartly in response to this move, minimalist defenders of the collapse\nargument have moved to the notion of minimal belief. They can say that\na state of mind is a belief and hence cognitive if and only if it is\none expressed by a sentence with truth conditions. Since minimalism\nsecures minimal truth conditions, indicative moral sentences have\ntruth conditions and the states they express are beliefs. Yet if the\nargument works, quasi-realist non-cognitivism would undermine its own\nright to employ both of the negative constitutive claims distinctive\nof non-cognitivism.\n\nMinimalist non-cognitivists have regrouped in various ways. One way is\nto resist the extension of the minimalist strategy to belief (Sinclair\n2007). Another is to distinguish minimal and robust notions of belief\nand representation. Minimal beliefs would need only to be states of\nmind expressed in assertions by indicative sentences, while robust\nbeliefs would meet some stronger requirement of representationality\n(Blackburn 2006). Non-cognitivism would then be committed to the view\nthat moral judgements did not express robust belief (Sinclair 2006;\nMcDonald 2012). The hope would be to contrast the entire minimalist\npackage with robust truth, robust truth-conditionality, and robust\nbelief. Such quasi-realist minimalists would be trying to find truth\nconditions which are (1) sufficient to make sense of using sentences\nhaving such truth-conditions in all of the ways that we use\nparadigmatically truth-apt sentences, and (2) which still fall short\nof robust representational truth conditions.\n\nOne might be a bit worried about the dialectic. If there are minimal\nand non-minimal readings of all the distinctive claims that can be\nused to distinguish cognitivism from non-cognitivism, we may lose our\ngrip on the distinction between the positions (Dreier, 2004b). Dreier\n(2018) suggests that the distinction between genuinely realist\ntheories (of which nonrelativist cognitivism is an instance) and\nanti-realist theories (of which noncognitivism and relativism are\ninstances) has to do with the order of explanation. According to\nanti-realist theories, entities or properties such as proposition,\nproperty, truth, truth conditions, and representation are explained by\nour use of terms for them in our thought and talk. Realists on the\nother hand think that our thought and talk is explained by these\nentities or properties. If this can be defended, we can distinguish\nminimalist and nonminimalist uses of the terms and ideas in question.\nThe distinction between cognitivists and noncognitivists can then be\nmade using the non-minimalist reading. But this may undercut the\nability of noncognitivists to use minimalism beyond making sense of\nseemingly realist linguistic constructions. For minimal propositions,\nproperties, and so on will likely not be suited to do much explanatory\nwork of the sort that robust propositions, properties, and so on are\nsuited for. The discussion continues. (Golub 2017, 2021; Simpson 2018,\n2020)\n\nIt is in any case controversial whether the minimalist proposal is\nviable, either for truth conditionality or for belief, let alone for\nfurther extensions beyond these (Dreier 2006; Dunaway 2010).\n",
