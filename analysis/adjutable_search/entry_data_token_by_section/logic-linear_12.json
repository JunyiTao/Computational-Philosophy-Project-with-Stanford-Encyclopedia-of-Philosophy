    "main_text": "Variations || Non-commutative linear logic\n6.3 Treatment of unbounded behavior\n\nWhile the MALL logic is an expressive and novel logic, it is also\ndecidable and, thus, not capable of capturing the unbounded behaviors\nfound in, say, iteration and recursion. As described above,\nthe addition of the exponentials ! and ? enriches MALL to full linear\nlogic and to a setting where unbounded behaviors can be captured. A\nsecond approach to extending MALL to capture unbounded behaviors\ninvolves the addition of the least and greatest fixed point operators\nas logical connectives directly into MALL. In order to properly\ncharacterize fixed points as being either the least or the greatest,\nit is necessary for the inference rules for fixed points to be\n\u201chigher-order\u201d in the sense that they involve invariants.\nSuch an extension to MALL (also with first-order quantification and\nterm equality) has been developed by Baelde\n (Baelde & Miller, 2007;\n Baelde 2012) and has been used to provide a proof-theoretic\nfoundation for model checking\n (Heath & Miller 2018).\n \n",
