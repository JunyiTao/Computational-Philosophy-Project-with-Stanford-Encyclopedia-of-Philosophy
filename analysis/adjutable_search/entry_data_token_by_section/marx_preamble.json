    "main_text": "\n\nKarl Marx (1818\u20131883) is often treated as a revolutionary, an\nactivist rather than a philosopher, whose works inspired the\nfoundation of many communist regimes in the twentieth century. It is\ncertainly hard to find many thinkers who can be said to have had\ncomparable influence in the creation of the modern world. However,\nMarx was trained as a philosopher, and although often portrayed as\nmoving away from philosophy in his mid-twenties\u2014perhaps towards\nhistory and the social sciences\u2014there are many points of contact\nwith modern philosophical debates throughout his writings.\n\nThe themes picked out here include Marx\u2019s philosophical\nanthropology, his theory of history, his economic analysis, his\ncritical engagement with contemporary capitalist society (raising\nissues about morality, ideology, and politics), and his prediction of\na communist future.\n\nMarx\u2019s early writings are dominated by an understanding of\nalienation, a distinct type of social ill whose diagnosis looks to\nrest on a controversial account of human nature and its flourishing.\nHe subsequently developed an influential theory of history\u2014often\ncalled historical materialism\u2014centred around the idea that forms\nof society rise and fall as they further and then impede the\ndevelopment of human productive power. Marx increasingly became\npreoccupied with an attempt to understand the contemporary capitalist\nmode of production, as driven by a remorseless pursuit of profit,\nwhose origins are found in the extraction of surplus value from the\nexploited proletariat. The precise role of morality and moral\ncriticism in Marx\u2019s critique of contemporary capitalist society\nis much discussed, and there is no settled scholarly consensus on\nthese issues. His understanding of morality may be related to his\naccount of ideology, and his reflection on the extent to which certain\nwidely-shared misunderstandings might help explain the stability of\nclass-divided societies. In the context of his radical journalism,\nMarx also developed his controversial account of the character and\nrole of the modern state, and more generally of the relation between\npolitical and economic life. Marx sees the historical process as\nproceeding through a series of modes of production, characterised by\n(more or less explicit) class struggle, and driving humankind towards\ncommunism. However, Marx is famously reluctant to say much about the\ndetailed arrangements of the communist alternative that he sought to\nbring into being, arguing that it would arise through historical\nprocesses, and was not the realisation of a pre-determined plan or\nblueprint.\n",
