    "main_text": "Models and Other Debates in the Philosophy of Science || Models, realism, and laws of nature\n5.1 Models, realism, and laws of nature\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 1,\n models typically provide a distorted representation of their targets.\nIf one sees science as primarily model-based, this could be taken to\nsuggest an antirealist interpretation of science. Realists, however,\ndeny that the presence of idealizations in models renders a realist\napproach to science impossible and point out that a good model, while\nnot literally true, is usually at least approximately true, and/or\nthat it can be improved by de-idealization (Laymon 1985; McMullin\n1985; Nowak 1979; Brzezinski and Nowak 1992).\n\nApart from the usual worries about the elusiveness of the notion of\napproximate truth (for a discussion, see the entry on\n truthlikeness),\n antirealists have taken issue with this reply for two (related)\nreasons. First, as Cartwright (1989) points out, there is no reason to\nassume that one can always improve a model by adding de-idealizing\ncorrections. Second, it seems that de-idealization is not in\naccordance with scientific practice because it is unusual that\nscientists invest work in repeatedly de-idealizing an existing model.\nRather, they shift to a different modeling framework once the\nadjustments to be made get too involved (Hartmann 1998). The various\nmodels of the atomic nucleus are a case in point: once it was realized\nthat shell effects are important to understand various subatomic\nphenomena, the (collective) liquid-drop model was put aside and the\n(single-particle) shell model was developed to account for the\ncorresponding findings. A further difficulty with de-idealization is\nthat most idealizations are not \u201ccontrolled\u201d. For example,\nit is not clear in what way one could de-idealize the MIT bag model to\neventually arrive at quantum chromodynamics, the supposedly correct\nunderlying theory.\n\nA further antirealist argument, the \u201cincompatible-models\nargument\u201d, takes as its starting point the observation that\nscientists often successfully use several incompatible models of\none and the same target system for predictive purposes\n(Morrison 2000). These models seemingly contradict each other, as they\nascribe different properties to the same target system. In nuclear\nphysics, for instance, the liquid-drop model explores the analogy of\nthe atomic nucleus with a (charged) fluid drop, while the shell model\ndescribes nuclear properties in terms of the properties of protons and\nneutrons, the constituents of an atomic nucleus. This practice appears\nto cause a problem for scientific realism: Realists typically hold\nthat there is a close connection between the predictive success of a\ntheory and its being at least approximately true. But if several\nmodels of the same system are predictively successful and if these\nmodels are mutually inconsistent, then it is difficult to maintain\nthat they are all approximately true.\n\nRealists can react to this argument in various ways. First, they can\nchallenge the claim that the models in question are indeed\npredictively successful. If the models are not good predictors, then\nthe argument is blocked. Second, they can defend a version of\n\u201cperspectival realism\u201d (Giere 2006; Massimi 2017; Rueger\n2005). Proponents of this position (which is sometimes also called\n\u201cperspectivism\u201d) situate it somewhere between\n\u201cstandard\u201d scientific realism and antirealism, and where\nexactly the right middle position lies is the subject matter of active\ndebate (Massimi 2018a,b; Saatsi 2016; Teller 2018; and the\ncontributions to Massimi and McCoy 2019). Third, realists can deny\nthat there is a problem in the first place, because scientific models,\nwhich are always idealized and therefore strictly speaking false, are\njust the wrong vehicle to make a point about realism (which should be\ndiscussed in terms of theories).\n\nA particular focal point of the realism debate are laws of nature,\nwhere the questions arise what laws are and whether they are\ntruthfully reflected in our scientific representations. According to\nthe two currently dominant accounts, the best-systems approach and the\nnecessitarian approach, laws of nature are understood to be universal\nin scope, meaning that they apply to everything that there is in the\nworld (for discussion of laws, see the entry on\n laws of nature).\n This take on laws does not seem to sit well with a view that places\nmodels at the center of scientific research. What role do general laws\nplay in science if it is models that represent what is happening in\nthe world? And how are models and laws related?\n\nOne possible response to these questions is to argue that laws of\nnature govern entities and processes in a model rather than\nin the world. Fundamental laws, on this approach, do not state facts\nabout the world but hold true of entities and processes in\nthe model. This view has been advocated in different variants:\nCartwright (1983) argues that all laws are ceteris paribus\nlaws. Cartwright (1999) makes use of \u201ccapacities\u201d (which\nshe considers to be prior to laws) and introduces the notion of a\n\u201cnomological machine\u201d. This is \n\n\na fixed (enough) arrangement of components, or factors, with stable\n(enough) capacities that in the right sort of stable (enough)\nenvironment will, with repeated operation, give rise to the kind of\nregular behavior that we represent in our scientific laws. (1999: 50;\nsee also the entry on\n ceteris paribus laws)\n \n\n\nGiere (1999) argues that the laws of a theory are better thought of,\nnot as encoding general truths about the world, but rather as\nopen-ended statements that can be filled in various ways in the\nprocess of building more specific scientific models. Similar positions\nhave also been defended by Teller (2001) and van Fraassen (1989).\n",
