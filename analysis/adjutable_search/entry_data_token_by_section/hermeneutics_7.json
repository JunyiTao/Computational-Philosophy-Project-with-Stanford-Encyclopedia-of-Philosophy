    "main_text": "Hermeneutics as Historical Movement || Contemporary Hermeneutics\n2.3 Contemporary Hermeneutics\n\nContemporary hermeneutics is demarcated from the modern historical\norigins of hermeneutics by the influence of a new use Heidegger makes\nof hermeneutics in his early phenomenological inquiries into human\nexistence. In turn, contemporary hermeneutics remains largely shaped\nby Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s \u2018philosophical\nhermeneutics,\u2019 which he describes as an attempt further to develop\nand expand on Heidegger\u2019s influential breakthrough. Contemporary\nhermeneutics also receives contour from Paul Ricoeur\u2019s\ncontributions to hermeneutics, from philosophical controversies with\ncritical theory and deconstruction, and from the emergence of\npostmodern hermeneutics. Further developments include innovations in\nhermeneutics made by some philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition\nand the development of hermeneutics in ethical and political\nphilosophy. Most recently, further developments include a renewal of\ninterest in normative dimensions of interpretive experience, and\nresponses in hermeneutics to a recent rise of interest in realism.\n",
