    "main_text": "Development of EPR || Spin and The Bohm version\n3.1 Spin and The Bohm version\n\nFor about fifteen years following its publication, the EPR paradox was\ndiscussed at the level of a thought experiment whenever the conceptual\ndifficulties of quantum theory became an issue. In 1951 David Bohm, a\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Robert Oppenheimer and then an untenured\nAssistant Professor at Princeton University, published a textbook on\nthe quantum theory in which he took a close look at EPR in order to\ndevelop a response in the spirit of Bohr. Bohm showed how one could\nmirror the conceptual situation in the EPR thought experiment by\nlooking at the dissociation of a diatomic molecule whose total spin\nangular momentum is (and remains) zero; for instance, the dissociation\nof an excited hydrogen molecule into a pair of hydrogen atoms by means\nof a process that does not change an initially zero total angular\nmomentum (Bohm 1951, Sections 22.15\u201322.18). In the Bohm\nexperiment the atomic fragments separate after interaction, flying off\nin different directions freely to separate experimental wings.\nSubsequently, in each wing, measurements are made of spin components\n(which here take the place of position and momentum), whose measured\nvalues would be anti-correlated after dissociation. In the so-called\nsinglet state of the atomic pair, the state after dissociation, if one\natom\u2019s spin is found to be positive with respect to the orientation of\nan axis perpendicular to its flight path, the other atom would be\nfound to have a negative spin with respect to a perpendicular axis\nwith the same orientation. Like the operators for position and\nmomentum, spin operators for different non-orthogonal orientations do\nnot commute. Moreover, in the experiment outlined by Bohm, the atomic\nfragments can move to wings far apart from one another and so become\nappropriate objects for assumptions that restrict the effects of\npurely local actions. Thus Bohm\u2019s experiment mirrors the entangled\ncorrelations in EPR for spatially separated systems, allowing for\nsimilar arguments and conclusions involving locality, separability,\nand completeness. Indeed, a late note of Einstein\u2019s, that may have\nbeen prompted by Bohm\u2019s treatment, contains a very sketchy spin\nversion of the EPR argument \u2013 once again pitting completeness\nagainst locality (\u201cA coupling of distant things is\nexcluded.\u201d Sauer 2007, p. 882). Following Bohm (1951) a paper by\nBohm and Aharonov (1957) went on to outline the machinery for a\nplausible experiment in which entangled spin correlations could be\ntested. It has become customary to refer to experimental arrangements\ninvolving determinations of spin components for spatially separated\nsystems, and to a variety of similar set-ups (especially ones for\nmeasuring photon polarization), as \u201cEPRB\u201d\nexperiments\u2014\u201cB\u201d for Bohm. Because of technical\ndifficulties in creating and monitoring the atomic fragments, however,\nthere seem to have been no immediate attempts to perform a Bohm\nversion of EPR.\n",
