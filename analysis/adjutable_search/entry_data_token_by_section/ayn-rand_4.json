    "main_text": "Ethics || Survival as the Ultimate Value\n2.2 Survival as the Ultimate Value\n\nThe survivalist view holds that just as literal survival is the\nultimate value for other living entities, so it is for human beings\n(Kelley & Thomas 1999; Gotthelf 1999; Smith 2000). Survival is the\nsource and final goal of all the actions of an entity, that which\ngives point to all its other values. For human beings, morality and\nhappiness are both instrumental means to survival. The vicious can\n\u201cachieve their goals [only] for the range of a moment\u201d, as\nevidenced by \u201cany criminal or any dictatorship\u201d (1961b:\n26).\n\n\u201cNon-survivalists\u201d make the following objections:\n\nThe biological premise that survival is the ultimate goal of all\nliving things is mistaken. Animals of many species risk their own\nlives for the sake of reproduction, or for protecting their young or\neven their group. But even if survival were the ultimate goal of other\nspecies, it need not be ours.\nEven if our own survival needs were the source of all our\nvalues, it would not follow that survival must be the ultimate\npsychological and moral goal to which all our other values\nare merely necessary means. The genesis of x does not\nlogically determine the ultimate goal of x. For example, the\nsource of sexual desire is our reproductive capacity but, as Rand\nwould agree, it doesn\u2019t follow that we ought to satisfy our\nsexual desires only if we want to reproduce.\nThe survivalist view that turns happiness into a mere means to\nsurvival entails, quite implausibly, that a long, unhappy life is\nbetter than a somewhat shorter but happy life, and just as good as a\nlong and happy one.\nMany dictators, including the Pharaohs of the past and the Stalins\nand Maos of the 20th century, have survived by making\nelaborate plans to preserve their lives and their power by using a\ncombination of terror, myth, and bribery. Their gross injustice poses\na far greater threat to the lives of their subordinates than to their\nown. Morality enhances the individual\u2019s chances of survival\nunder normal circumstances, but it is not necessary for\nsurvival. And in some circumstances, such as in a dictatorship, acting\nmorally decreases the individual\u2019s chances of survival, a\npoint that Rand herself convincingly dramatizes in We the\nLiving and\nAnthem.\nA survivalist ethics can support, at best, a bare-bones Hobbesian\nmorality, not a virtue ethics. If Rand\u2019s virtues were necessary\nfor survival, the human species would have perished a long time ago,\ninstead of expanding exponentially. Her rich and challenging picture\nof human life and virtue in her novels points to a richer and more\nchallenging conception of the final end than mere survival.\nMany of Rand\u2019s heroes, from Kira (We the Living) to\nPrometheus (Anthem) to John Galt (Atlas Shrugged),\nrisk their lives for the sake of the values that make their lives\nworth living.\n Like Hobbes, Rand rightly points out that if everyone or most\npeople were to start preying on each other, then no one would survive\nfor long\u2014literally, and that generations of predators\nwould end up destroying or driving away the producers, and thus\ndestroying themselves (Anthem and Atlas\nShrugged). But this doesn\u2019t show that a few predators in a\nsociety of producers cannot survive by predation. Indeed, Rand herself\nsometimes acknowledges that evil people can survive by free-riding\n(\u201chitch-hiking\u201d, as she calls it) on rational, productive\npeople:\n\n\n  If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud\n  \u2026 it still remains true that their survival is made possible\n  only by their victims, only by the men who choose to think and to\n  produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing. (1961b:\n  25)\n\n\nRand often says that the final end is survival proper to a human\nbeing (1961b: 26), or that the final end is happiness (1961b: 27, 30).\nNeither can be reduced to survival simpliciter.\nIn \u201cMan\u2019s Rights\u201d, Rand explains an\nindividual\u2019s right to his own life as \n\n\n  the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a\n  rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and\n  the enjoyment of his own life. (1963b: 93 and 1967a: 321\u201322)\n  \n\n\n\u201cLife\u201d here is explicated in terms of not only continued\nsurvival but also of fulfillment and enjoyment. \n\n\nFor all these reasons, a more plausible interpretation of Rand\u2019s\nview is that morality is required for surviving qua human being, that\nis, for living a life proper to a human being.\n",
