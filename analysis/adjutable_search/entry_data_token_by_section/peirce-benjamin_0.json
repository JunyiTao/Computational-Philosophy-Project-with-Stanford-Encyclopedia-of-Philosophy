    "main_text": "Career\n1. Career\n\n\nBorn in 1809, Peirce became a major figure in mathematics and the\nphysical sciences during a period when the U.S. was still a minor\ncountry in these areas (Hogan 1991). A student at Harvard College, he\nwas appointed tutor there in 1829. Two years later he became Professor\nof Mathematics in the University, a post which was changed in 1842 to\ncover astronomy also; he held it until his death in 1880. He played a\nprominent role in the development of the science curriculum of the\nuniversity, and also acted as College librarian for a time. However, he\nwas not a successful teacher, being impatient with students lacking\nstrong gifts; but he wrote some introductory textbooks in mathematics,\nand also a more advanced one in mechanics (Peirce 1855). Among his\nother appointments, the most important one was Director of the U.S.\nCoast Survey from 1867 to 1874. Peirce also exercised influence through\nhis children. By far the most prominent was\n Charles Sanders Peirce\n (1839\u20131914), who became a remarkable though maverick polymath,\nas mathematician, chemist, logician, historian, and many other\nactivities. In addition, James Mills (1834\u20131906) became in turn\nprofessor of mathematics at Harvard, Benjamin Mills (1844\u20131870)\na mining engineer, and Herbert Henry Davis (1849\u20131916) a\ndiplomat. Harvard professor Benjamin Osgood Peirce (1854\u20131914),\nmathematician and physicist was a cousin.  Benjamin Peirce did not\nthink of himself as a philosopher in any academic sense, yet his work\nmanifests interests of this kind, in two different ways. The first was\nrelated to his teaching. \n",
