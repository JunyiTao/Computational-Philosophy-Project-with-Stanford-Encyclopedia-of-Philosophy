    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Dispositionalism\n1.2 Dispositionalism\n\nWhile representationalists like Fodor, Dretske, and Mandelbaum contend\nthat having the right internal, representational structure is\nessential to having beliefs, another group of philosophers treats the\ninternal structure of the mind as of only incidental relevance to the\nquestion of whether a being is properly described as believing. One\nway to highlight the difference between this view and\nrepresentationalism is this: Imagine that we discover an alien being,\nof unknown constitution and origin, whose behavior and overall\nbehavioral dispositions are perfectly normal by human standards.\n\u201cRudolfo\u201d, say, emerges from a spacecraft and integrates\nseamlessly into U.S. society, becoming a tax lawyer, football fan, and\nDemocratic Party activist. Even if we know next to nothing about what\nis going on inside his head, it may seem natural to say that Rudolfo\nhas beliefs much like ours\u2014for example, that the 1040 is\nnormally due April 15, that a field goal is worth 3 points, and that\nlabor unions tend to support Democratic candidates. Perhaps we can\ncoherently imagine that Rudolfo does not manipulate sentences in a\nlanguage of thought or possess internal representational structures of\nthe right sort. Perhaps it is conceptually, even if not physically,\npossible that he has no complex, internal, cognitive organ, no real\nbrain. But even if it is granted that a creature must have human-like\nrepresentations in order to behave thoroughly like a human being, one\nmight still think that it is the pattern of actual and potential\nbehavior that is fundamental in belief\u2014that representations\nare essential to belief only because, and to the extent to, they\nground such a pattern. Dispositionalists and\ninterpretationists are drawn to this way of thinking.\n\nTraditional dispositional views of belief assert that for someone to\nbelieve some proposition P is for that person to possess one\nor more particular behavioral dispositions pertaining to P.\nOften cited is the disposition to assent to utterances of P\nin the right sorts of circumstances (if one understands the language,\nwishes to reveal one\u2019s true opinion, is not physically\nincapacitated, etc.). Other relevant dispositions might include the\ndisposition to exhibit surprise should the falsity of P make\nitself evident, the disposition to assent to Q if one is\nshown that P implies Q, and the disposition to\ndepend on P\u2019s truth in executing one\u2019s plans.\nPerhaps all such dispositions can be brought under a single heading,\nwhich is, most generally, being disposed to act as though P\nis the case. Such actions are normally taken to be at least pretty\ngood prima facie evidence of belief in P;\nthe question is whether being disposed, overall, so to act is\ntantamount to believing P, as the dispositionalist\nthinks, or whether it is merely an outward sign of belief. Braithwaite\n(1932\u20131933) and Marcus (1990) are prominent advocates of the\ntraditional dispositional approach to belief (though Braithwaite\nemphasizes in his analysis another form of belief, rather like\n\u201coccurrent\u201d belief as described in \u00a72.1 below).\n\nThere are two standard objections to traditional dispositional\naccounts of belief. The first, tracing back at least to Chisholm\n(1957), assumes that the dispositionalist\u2019s aim is to\nreduce or analyze facts about belief entirely into\nfacts about outward behavior, facts specifiable without reference to\nother beliefs, desires, inner feelings, and so forth (see the entry on\nphilosophical\n behaviorism).\n Such a reduction or analysis appears impossible for the following\nreason: People with the same belief may behave very differently,\ndepending on their other beliefs, desires, and so forth. For example,\na person who believes that it will rain will only be disposed to take\nan umbrella if they also believe that the umbrella will ward off the\nwater and if they don\u2019t want to get wet. Change the surrounding\nbeliefs and desires and very different behavior may result. A\ndispositionalist attempting to specify the particular behavioral\ndispositions associated with, for example, the belief that it\u2019s\nraining will then either get it wrong about the dispositions of some\npeople (such as those who like to get wet) or will be forced to\nincorporate into their dispositional analysis conditional antecedents\ninvoking the very ideas they are trying to analyze or reduce\naway\u2014saying, for example, that the person who believes that\nP will behave in such-and-such a way if they also\nbelieve X and desire Y\u2014apparently dooming the\nreductionist project. (It may be possible to avoid this objection by\ninvoking a \u201cRamsey\u201d-like approach to the reduction [see\nthe section on Functional States and Ramsey Sentences in the entry on\n functionalism\n and Lewis 1972], but this type of analysis was not widely discussed\nuntil after traditional dispositional approaches to belief had gone\nlargely out of fashion.)\n\nThe second standard objection to traditional dispositional accounts of\nbelief is to note the loose connection between belief and behavior in\nsome cases\u2014for example, in a recently paralyzed person, or in\nsomeone who wants to keep a private opinion (e.g., a Muscovite who\nbelieves, in 1937, that Stalin\u2019s purges are morally wrong), or\nin matters of very little practical relevance (e.g., an American\nhomebody\u2019s belief that there is at least one church in Nice).\nAgain, the traditional dispositionist seems faced with a choice\nbetween oversimplifying (and thus mischaracterizing some\npeople\u2019s dispositions) and loading the dispositions with\npotentially problematic or unwieldy conditional antecedents (e.g.,\nthey\u2019d get the umbrella if their paralysis healed;\nthey\u2019d speak up if the political climate changed). On\nthe other hand, however, the demand for an absolutely precise\nspecification of the conditions under which a disposition will be\nmanifested, without exception, may be excessive. As Cartwright (1983)\nhas noted, even perfectly respectable claims in the physical sciences\noften hold only ceteris paribus or \u201call else being\nequal\u201d.\n\nIn light of these concerns and others, most recent philosophers\nsympathetic with the view described in the first paragraph of this\nsection have abandoned traditional dispositionalism. They divide into\nroughly two classes, which we may call liberal\ndispositionalists and interpretationists. Liberal\ndispositionalists avoid the first objection by abandoning the\nreductionist project associated with traditional dispositionalism.\nThey permit appeal to other mental states in specifying the\ndispositions relevant to any particular belief\u2014possibly\nincluding other beliefs and desires. They also broaden the range of\ndispositions considered relevant to the possession of a belief so as\nto include at least some dispositions to undergo private mental\nepisodes that do not manifest in outwardly observable\nbehavior\u2014dispositions, for example, for the subject to feel (and\nnot just exhibit) surprise should they discover the falsity of\nP, for them privately to draw conclusions from P, to\nfeel confidence in the truth of P, to utter P\nsilently in inner speech, and so forth. This appears also to mitigate\nthe second objection to some extent (though see Moore and Botterill\n2023): The Muscovite possesses their belief about Stalin\u2019s\npurges at least as much in virtue of the things they says silently in\ninner speech and the disapproval they privately feel as in virtue of\ntheir disposition to express that opinion were the political climate\nto change. Advocates of views of this sort include Price (1969), Baker\n(1995), Schwitzgebel (2002, 2013), and arguably Ryle (1949) and Ramsey\n(1926 [1990], 1927\u20131929 [1991]; see Wright 2017). Smithies\n(forthcoming) sheds the behavioral focus of traditional\ndispositionalism entirely, arguing that to believe is to be disposed\nto feel (or to occurrently feel) conviction (see also Cohen 1992).\n\nHowever, a philosopher approaching belief with the specific goal of\ndefending physicalism or materialism\u2014the view that everything in\nthe world, including the mind, is wholly physical or material (see\n physicalism)\u2014might\n have reason to be dissatisfied with liberal dispositionalism, for the\nvery reason that it abandons the reductionist project. Although\nliberal dispositional accounts of belief are consistent with\nphysicalism, they do not substantially advance that thesis,\nsince they relate belief to other mental states that may or may not be\nseen as physical. The defense of physicalism was one of the driving\nforces in philosophy of mind in the period during which the most\ninfluential approaches to belief in contemporary analytic philosophy\nof mind were developed\u2014the 1960s through the 1980s\u2014and it\nwas one of the principal reasons philosophers were interested in\naccounts of propositional attitudes such as belief. Consequently, the\nfailure of liberal dispositionalism to advance the physicalist project\nmight be seen as an important drawback.\n",
