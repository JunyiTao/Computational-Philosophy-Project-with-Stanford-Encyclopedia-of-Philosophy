    "main_text": "Types of Events || Mental and Physical Events\n2.4 Mental and Physical Events\n\nA similar story applies to the distinction between mental\nevents (Anita\u2019s decision to wear boots) and physical or\nphysiological events (such and such neurons firing). One may\nthink that this distinction is real insofar as events of the latter\nsort are expected to fall naturally into the nomological net of\nphysical theories whereas the former seem to escape it. But one may\nalso want to resist this line of thought and maintain that the\ndistinction between the mental and the physical concerns exclusively\nthe vocabulary with which we describe what goes on. These options have\nimportant ramifications for various issues in the philosophy of\nmind\u2014e.g., issues of mental causation (Heil & Mele 1993;\nWalter & Heckmann 2003; Gibb et al. 2013). If the\ndistinction between mental and physical events is ontologically\nsignificant, then the question arises of how these two sorts of event\ncausally interact with each other, leading to various forms of\nnomological or anomalous dualism (Foster 1991). By contrast, the claim\nthat the distinction is purely semantic is congenial to a monist\nposition, whether nomological or anomalous (Macdonald 1989).\n\nAnomalous monism has been popular especially among philosophers who\naccept a particularist conception of events as widely redescribable\nentities, for such a conception allows one to accept the materialist\nclaim that all events are physical (regardless of whether one\ndescribes them in mentalistic terms) while rejecting the seeming\nconsequence that mental goings-on can be given purely physical\nexplanations (precisely because only a physicalistic vocabulary is\nsuited to such explanations) (Nagel 1965; Davidson 1970, 1993). Some\nauthors, however, have argued that this line of argument falls prey to\nthe charge of epiphenomenalism, to the effect that mental events would\nlack causal or explanatory powers altogether (Honderich 1982; Robinson\n1982; Kim 1989; Campbell 1998, 2005; Welshon 1999).\n",
