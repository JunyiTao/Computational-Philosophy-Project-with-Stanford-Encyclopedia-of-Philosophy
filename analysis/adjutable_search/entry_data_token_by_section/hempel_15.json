    "main_text": "Inductive-Statistical Explanation\n6. Inductive-Statistical Explanation\n\nIn his studies of inductive reasoning, Hempel (1960, 1962a, 1966b)\ndiscusses the ambiguity of induction, which arises because\nincompatible conclusions can appear to be equally-well supported by\ninductive arguments, where all the premises of both arguments are\ntrue. This problem has no analogue for deductive arguments:\ninconsistent conclusions cannot be validly derived from consistent\npremises, even if they are false. Inconsistent conclusions can receive\ninductive support from consistent premises, however, even when they\nare all true. Consider Hempel\u2019s illustration of conflicting\npredictions for a patient\u2019s recovery:\n\n(e1)\nJones, a patient with a sound heart, has just had an appendectomy,\nand of all persons with sound hearts who underwent appendectomy in the\npast decade, 93% had an uneventfully recovery.\n\n\nThis information, taken by itself, would surely lend strong support to\nthe hypothesis,\n\n(h1)\nJones will have an uneventful recovery. \n\n\nBut suppose that we also have the information:\n\n(e2)\nJones is an octogenarian with serious kidney failure; he just had\nan appendectomy after his appendix had ruptured; and in the past\ndecade, of all cases of appendectomy after rupture of the appendix\namong octogenarians with serious kidney failure, only 8% had an\nuneventful recovery.\n\n\nThis information by itself would lend strong support to the\ncontradictory of (h1):\n\n\\((\\neg\\)h1)\nJones will not have an uneventful recovery. (Hempel\n1966b) \n\n\nThus, Hempel observed, (e1) and (e2) are logically compatible and\ncould all be part of the evidence available when Jones\u2019\nprognosis is being considered. The solution Hempel endorsed was\nthe requirement of total evidence, according to which, in\nreasoning about the world, arguments must be based upon all the\navailable evidence, though he noted that evidence can be omitted when\nit is irrelevant and its omission does not affect the level of\nsupport. Here, when (e1) is combined with (e2), \\((\\neg\\)h1) is better\nsupported than (h1).\n",
