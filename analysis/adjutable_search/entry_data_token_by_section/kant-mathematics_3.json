    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Philosophy of Mathematics || Kant\u2019s conception of the role of mathematics in Transcendental Idealism\n2.3 Kant\u2019s conception of the role of mathematics in Transcendental Idealism\n\nKant\u2019s theory of mathematical practice connects not only with\nhis theory of intuition and sensibility (as described above) but also\nwith other aspects of the doctrine of Transcendental Idealism, as it\nis articulated throughout Kant\u2019s critical works.\n\nIn the Transcendental Analytic, Kant deduces the table of twelve\ncategories, or pure concepts of the understanding, the first six of\nwhich he describes as \u201cmathematical\u201d (as opposed to\n\u201cdynamical\u201d) categories because of their concern with\nobjects of intuition (B110). The concept of number is treated as\n\u201cbelonging\u201d to the category of \u201callness\u201d or\ntotality, which is itself thought to result from the combination of\nthe concepts of unity and plurality (Parsons 1984; see 2.2 above for\nother topics related to Kant\u2019s account of number). But, Kant\nclaims further that difficulties that arise in the representation of\ninfinities\u2014in which one allegedly represents unity and plurality\nwith no resulting representation of number\u2014reveal that\na concept of number must require the mediation of \u201ca special act\nof the understanding\u201d (B111). (This special act is presumably\nthe synthesis that Kant describes as a function of both\nimagination and understanding, and which it is the business of the\nfull theory of judgment\u2014including the Transcendental Deduction\nand the Schematism\u2014to explain (Carson 2017; Longuenesse 1998).)\nSo, though he also claims that arithmetic \u201cforms its concepts of\nnumbers through successive addition of units in time\u201d (4:283),\nit is misleading to infer that arithmetic is to time as geometry is to\nspace, since a formal intuition of time is inadequate to explain the\ngeneral and abstract science of\n number.[5]\n In fact, Kant declares mechanics to be the mathematical science that\nis to time what geometry is to space (Sutherland 2014).\n\nIn the Schematism, Kant undertakes to identify the particular\nmechanism that enables the pure concepts of the understanding to\nsubsume sensible intuitions, with which they are heterogeneous. The\ncategories must be \u201cschematized\u201d because their\nnon-empirical origin in pure understanding prevents their having the\nsort of sensible content that would connect them immediately to the\nobjects of experience; transcendental schemata are mediating\nrepresentations that are meant to establish the connection between\npure concepts and appearances in a rule-governed way. Mathematical\nconcepts are discussed in this context since they are unique in being\npure but also sensible concepts: they are pure because they are\nstrictly a priori in origin, and yet they are sensible since\nthey are constructed in concreto. (Kant further complicates\nthis issue by identifying number as the pure schema of the category of\nmagnitude (Longuenesse 1998).) There arises an interpretive question\nas to whether mathematical concepts, whose conceptual content is given\nsensibly, require schematization by a distinguishable \u201cthird\nthing\u201d, and, if so, what it amounts to (Leavitt 1991; Young\n1984). More broadly, the question arises as to how the transcendental\nimagination, the faculty responsible for schematism, operates in\nmathematical contexts (Domski 2010).\n\nFinally, in the Analytic of Principles, Kant derives the synthetic\njudgments that \u201cflow a priori from pure concepts of the\nunderstanding\u201d and which ground all other a priori\ncognitions, including those of mathematics (A136/B175). The principles\nof pure understanding that are associated with the categories of\nquantity (i.e., unity, plurality and totality) are the Axioms of\nIntuition. Whereas mathematical principles proper are \u201cdrawn\nonly from intuition\u201d and so do not constitute any part of the\nsystem of principles of pure understanding, the explanation for the\npossibility of such mathematical principles (outlined above) must be\nsupplemented by an account of the highest possible transcendental\nprinciples (A148\u20139/B188\u20139) (Shabel 2017). Accordingly, the\nAxioms of Intuition provide a meta-principle, or principle of\nthe mathematical principles of quantity, namely that \u201cAll\nintuitions are extensive magnitudes\u201d (A161/B202). Most\ncommentators interpret Kant here to be indicating why the principles\nof mathematics, which have to do with pure space and time, are\napplicable to the appearances: the appearances can only be represented\n\u201cthrough the same synthesis as that through which space and time\nin general are determined\u201d (A161/B202). So, all\nintuitions, whether pure or empirical, are \u201cextensive\nmagnitudes\u201d that are governed by the principles of mathematics.\n(For an alternative view of the Axioms, see Sutherland\n2005b).\n\nIt is also notable that key passages in the Critique of the Power\nof Judgment deal with mathematics and the \u201cmathematical\nsublime\u201d (Fugate 2014; Breitenbach 2015).
