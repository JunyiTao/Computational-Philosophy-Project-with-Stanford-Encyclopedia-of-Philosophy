Another version of this view\n (\u00a73.3.2)\n holds that instrumental incoherence is nothing more than an indicator\nthat one is not functioning well as an agent, where this evaluation\ndoesn\u2019t entail any particular conclusions about what one ought,\nor has reason, to do.\n3.3.1 Responsiveness to Beliefs about Independent Requirements of Reason\n\nOn this first approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction\nClaims, what one does \u201cwrong\u201d in being instrumentally\nincoherent is violate one\u2019s own judgments about one\u2019s\nreasons (or fail to be attentive enough to form such judgments in the\nfirst place), and what one does \u201cright\u201d in becoming\ninstrumentally coherent is respond appropriately to one\u2019s\njudgments about one\u2019s reasons.\n\nSuppose one is instrumentally incoherent. Plausibly, one is in a\nposition to know this, that one is instrumentally incoherent.\nPlausibly, one is also in a position to know Ought Pattern 2: the\ngeneral fact that, when one is instrumentally incoherent, there is\nsome specific change that one ought to make. So, one is in a position\nto know that there is some specific change that one ought to make. So,\nplausibly, one ought to give some thought to what this specific change\nis. In other words,\n\nSelf-Monitoring:\nIf one is instrumentally incoherent, then one ought to arrive at\nsome belief about which attitude (or pattern of attitudes) one ought\nto have.\n\n\nSuppose one arrives at some such belief. And suppose one revises\none\u2019s attitudes in accordance with that belief. If one becomes\ninstrumentally coherent in this way, then, even if one\nrevises one\u2019s attitudes in the wrong way (i.e., against reason),\none still satisfies:\n\nSelf-Monitoring, and\nKrasia: If one believes that reason requires one to X (or\nnot to X), then one is rationally required to X (or\nnot to X).\n\n\nThis would explain the Satisfaction Claim.\n\nIt might be thought that it\u2019s not much of an improvement to\nexplain the requirement to be instrumentally coherent in terms of\nSelf-Monitoring and Krasia, since we are still appealing to a\nrequirement of coherence: namely, Krasia. The only difference is that\nit requires us not to be instrumentally coherent, but instead\nto be kratically coherent: i.e., to follow one\u2019s\njudgment about one\u2019s reasons. Indeed, if we thought that it\nwere a requirement of reason to comply with Krasia, then\nsimilar challenges to those we discussed in\n \u00a73.2.\n would reappear, and so it would not be much of an improvement.\n\nBut, the view considered here naturally suggests a new strategy:\npresenting a Transparency Account according to which the normativity\nof instrumental coherence is merely apparent (Kolodny 2005, \u00a75).\nAccording to the Transparency Account of rational requirements in\ngeneral, when we point out to people that rationality requires\nsomething of them, we aren\u2019t presenting them with some\nrequirement of reason; rather, we\u2019re pointing out to them what\nthey already think reason requires of them. And, so, when we point out\nto someone that rationality requires they be instrumentally coherent\nwith respect to some end, we\u2019re pointing out to them that (on\nthe assumption that Self-Monitoring is satisfied) they already think\nthat reason requires some specific change in their attitudes. Of\ncourse, the instrumentally incoherent agent could be mistaken in these\nthoughts; perhaps he thinks reason requires him to intend the means\nwhen reason actually requires that he abandon the end instead. It is\nthis possibility for false belief that restricts us to saying that the\nnormativity of rational requirements is merely apparent.\n\nHowever, one might challenge whether the Satisfaction Claim is\nadequately explained by an appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia.\nSuppose an instrumentally incoherent agent knows that she ought to\ngive up her intention to kill her boss, but instead she comes to\nintend to poison the office coffee, which she believes to be a\nnecessary means to killing her boss. She clearly violates a\nrequirement of reason and she clearly violates Krasia, but it still\nseems that she satisfies some requirement in coming to intend the\nmeans to her immoral end. The appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia\ncan\u2019t explain our thinking that she satisfies some requirement\nin proceeding this way.\n3.3.2 Proper Functioning\n\nPerhaps a violation of a requirement of instrumental coherence is\nmerely an indicator that an agent is not functioning well in the\nexercise of her rational capacities, where this evaluation\ndoesn\u2019t entail that she ought, or has reason, to be\ninstrumentally coherent on any particular occasion (see Raz 2005a,b).\nIn holding this view, one could also say that there is value in being\na properly functioning agent, and that this value is explained by the\nways in which functioning properly as a agent tends to bring one into\nconformity with what reason requires. But, it doesn\u2019t follow\nfrom this that there is value in functioning properly, or that one has\nany reason to function properly, in every particular occasion.\n(Similar things could be said about the value of having\nwell-functioning perceptual capacities.) For instance, when one has\nthe unalterable intention to kill one\u2019s boss (for more on\nunalterable ends, see\n Section 1\n of the supplementary document\n Problems for Wide Scoping),\n there is nothing valuable in one\u2019s functioning properly, so far\nas instrumental rationality goes, on that particular occasion, and one\nwould have no reason to do so (see Raz 2005a, especially pp.\n10\u201313, and Bratman 1987).\n\nBut one might worry about how well this account explains the Violation\nand Satisfaction Claims. On this view, the requirements violated, or\nsatisfied, are simply standards of proper rational functioning. These\nstandards can be used to evaluate how well particular agents are\nfunctioning, in the same way that standards of what makes for a\nwell-functioning perceptual apparatus can be used to evaluate how well\nparticular perceivers are functioning. But, rational requirements also\nseem to call for some response. For instance, when we advise\nothers who are in violation of rational requirements, such as those\nwho are instrumentally incoherent, we say that some change in attitude\nis called for. And, when we ourselves are instrumentally\nincoherent, we feel some \u201cnormative pressure\u201d to change\nour attitudes in some way (see Kolodny 2005, \u00a74). It\u2019s\nunclear how these features of rational requirements could be explained\nby a view that takes them to be merely evaluative.\n\nAnother related view attempts to explain instrumental incoherence in\nterms of the success conditions of the relevant individual\nattitudes. If your belief that intending to Y is necessary for X-ing\nis successful (true), then your failure to intend to Y ensures that\nyour intending to X will not be successful (in that it won\u2019t\nresult in your X-ing). In other words, your being instrumentally\nincoherent ensures that either your instrumental belief is false, or\nthat your intention will not be successfully executed (Brunero 2020,\nCh.7). Some philosophers have recently argued that the impossibility\nof joint attitudinal success can explain coherence requirements in\ngeneral, not just instrumental rationality (Fullhart and Martinez,\nforthcoming; Fink, forthcoming).\n",
