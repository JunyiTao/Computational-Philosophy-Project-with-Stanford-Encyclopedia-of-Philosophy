Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art \n\n\n\u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\u2014an essay Heidegger\ndelivered repeatedly between 1935 and 1936, rewriting and expanding it\ninto three lectures (which became the three main sections of the\npublished essay, to which Heidegger then added a brief\n\u201cAfterword\u201d near the end of the 1930s and a slightly longer\n\u201cAddendum\u201d in 1957)\u2014is far and away the most\nimportant source for understanding his attempt to articulate an\nalternative to the aesthetic understanding of art, although several\nother works (contemporaneous as well as later) also provide important\nclues to his\n view.[30]\nIn the final version of this famous\nessay, Heidegger meditates on three different works of art in\nsuccession: A painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d by\nVincent van Gogh; a poem entitled \u201cThe Roman Fountain\u201d by\nC. F. Meyer, and an unspecified Greek temple at Paestum (most likely\nthe temple to Hera). Leading Heidegger scholars such as Hubert\nDreyfus and Julian Young rely almost entirely on Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation of the ancient Greek temple in order to explicate his\n\u201cpromethean\u201d view of art\u2019s historically revolutionary\npotential, its ability to focus and transform our sense of what is and\nwhat matters (as we saw in section 1.1). Young (2001, p. 22) and\nDreyfus (2005, p. 409) suggest that Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of\nVan Gogh is \u201canomalous\u201d and \u201clargely\nirrelevant\u201d to this view, despite the fame generated by the\nlongstanding controversy surrounding it (a controversy to which we will\nreturn at the\n end).[31]\nLike almost all other scholars,\nmoreover, Dreyfus and Young simply overlook Heidegger\u2019s\nintroduction of Meyer\u2019s poem\u2014even as they recognize that\nfor Heidegger, like Plato, \u201cpoetry\u201d names the very essence\nof art (namely, poi\u00easis or \u201cbringing into\nbeing\u201d), hence Heidegger\u2019s claim that: \u201cAll\nart [that is, all bringing-into-being] \u2026 is essentially\npoetry\u201d (PLT 73/GA5 59). We thus have to wonder:\nIs the only complete poem Heidegger included in the essay that advances\nthis view of poetry as the essence of art really of no\n significance?[32]\n\n\nIn my view, Heidegger\u2019s analysis of each of these three works\ncontributes something important to his overarching attempt to guide\nreaders into a phenomenological encounter with art that is capable of\nhelping us transcend modern aesthetics from within. To put it\nsimply, the temple motivates and helps develop the details of\nHeidegger\u2019s larger project; the poem implicitly contextualizes\nand explains it; and the painting (and only the painting) directly\nexemplifies it. In order to see how, let us take these points in\norder. Heidegger\u2019s imaginative reconstruction of the lost\ntemple helps motivate his quest for a non-aesthetic encounter with art,\nbut not (as is often said) because he seeks some nostalgic return to\nthe Greek world. Heidegger dismisses such a revival as an\nimpossibility because the ancient temple\u2014just like the medieval\ncathedral\u2014no longer gathers its historical world around it and\nthus no longer works as great art, and such \u201cworld-withdrawal and\nworld-decay can never be reversed\u201d (PLT 41/GA5 26).\nInstead, the Greek temple shows that art was once encountered in a way\nother than as a subject\u2019s intense aesthetic experience of an\nobject, and thus suggests that, while those ancient and medieval worlds\nhave been lost irretrievably, other works of art might yet be\nencountered non-aesthetically in our late-modern world. Heidegger\nthus elaborates his philosophical vision of how the temple worked for a\ntime to unify a coherent and meaningful historical world around itself\n(by inconspicuously focusing and illuminating its people\u2019s sense\nof what is and what matters) in order to suggest that a non-aesthetic\nencounter with art might yet do the same thing once again: A work\nof art might yet help to gather a new historical world around itself by\nfocusing and illuminating an understanding of being that does not\nreduce entities either to modern objects to be controlled or to\nlate-modern resources to be optimized.\n\n\nWhile Heidegger\u2019s project is thus undeniably inspired by the\npast, this inspiration serves his goal of helping us move historically\ninto the future. His guiding hope, we have seen, is that a\nnon-aesthetic encounter with a contemporary artwork will help us learn\nto understand the being of entities not as modern objects\n(\u201csubjectivism\u201d) or as late-modern resources\n(\u201cenframing\u201d) but in a genuinely post-modern way, thereby\nmaking another historical beginning. So, which work of art does\nHeidegger think can help us late moderns learn to transcend modern\naesthetics from within and thereby discover a path leading beyond\nmodernity? There are only two viable candidates to fill this\ncrucial role in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d:\nMeyer\u2019s poem and Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting.[33]\n\n\nSo, why does Heidegger give such pride of place to Meyer\u2019s\npoem? The answer to this puzzle (which too few readers even\nnotice) is that the poem introduces the broader philosophical context\nof Heidegger\u2019s project by conveying his emerging understanding of\nhistoricity, the doctrine according to which our fundamental\nsense of reality changes over\n time.[34]\nThe ontological \u201ctruth\u201d\nthat Meyer\u2019s poem embodies\u2014and \u201csets to work,\u201d\nin Heidegger\u2019s creative appropriation of the poem\u2014is that\ntruth itself is essentially historical and, moreover, that this\nessential history of truth forms three successive \u201cepochs,\u201d\nin the same way that the \u201cjet\u201d of water fills the three\nconsecutive \u201cbasins\u201d in Meyer\u2019s eponymous\n fountain.[35]\nFor\nHeidegger, to put it more precisely, the relations Meyer\u2019s poem\ndescribes between the fountain\u2019s original \u201cjet\u201d and\nits three successive water basins illuminate the relations between\n\u201cbeing\u201d itself (that is, as we will see, the inexhaustible\nontological source of historical intelligibility) and the three main\nhistorical \u201cepochs\u201d or ages in Western humanity\u2019s\nunderstanding of being (as Heidegger conceived of this \u201chistory\nof being\u201d in 1936), namely, ancient \u201cGreece,\u201d\n\u201cthe middle ages,\u201d and \u201cthe modern age\u201d (PLT\n76\u20137/GA5\n 64\u20135).[36]\n\n\nThus, for example, just as the original \u201cjet\u201d of water\n\u201cfalls\u201d into the fountain\u2019s successive basins, so the\n\u201coverflowing\u201d ontological riches concealed in the ancient\nworld were first diminished in the medieval world. \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Work of Art\u201d make the contentious case that this\nontological diminution \u201cbegins\u201d when concepts central to\nthe ancient Greek understanding of being get translated into Latin\nwithout a full experience of what those concepts originally revealed\n(PLT 23/GA5 8). Hence the obvious appeal for Heidegger of\nMeyer\u2019s suggestive line: \u201cVeiling itself, this [first\nbasin] overflows / Into a second basin\u2019s ground\u201d (PLT\n37/GA5 23). What remained of these ontological\n\u201criches\u201d in the medieval world was then transposed into and\nreduced further in the modern epoch which, like the fountain\u2019s\nthird basin, stands at the furthest remove from its original source.\nIt thus seems clear that Heidegger included Meyer\u2019s poem\nbecause he believed it suggestively illuminated the way the history of\nbeing unfolds as an epochal history of decline, a \u201cfall\u201d which\nresults from this history\u2019s increasing forgetting of the source\nfrom which it ultimately springs\u2014the Ur-sprung or\n\u201corigin\u201d of Heidegger\u2019s essay\u2019s title\u2014in\na word: \u201cBeing\u201d (Sein), Heidegger\u2019s\nfamous name for the source from which all historical intelligibility\noriginates (by way of the disclosive \u201cnaming-into-being\u201d which\nHeidegger understands as the \u201cpoetic\u201d essence of art, as we\nwill see in the next section). In other words, Heidegger uses\nMeyer\u2019s poem to allude to the broader philosophical context that\nhelps explain and motivate the new historical beginning he hopes art\nwill help us inaugurate. Heidegger\u2019s use of this particular\npoem suggests, moreover, that in order to accomplish this \u201cother\nbeginning,\u201d Western humanity needs to learn to tap back into that\noriginal, ontological source (the overflowing \u201cjet\u201d of\nbeing), and that such a reconnection with the source of historical\nintelligibility is something art can still teach us. (Although\ninterpreters also overlook this, the quiet presence of a homophonous\n\u201cthird reich\u201d in Meyer\u2019s poem reminds us of the\ndeeply-troubling dimension of Heidegger\u2019s thinking in the\nmid-1930s, the fact that his philosophical hopes for the future were\nfor a brief time deeply entwined with his idiosyncratic understanding\nof the direction that the burgeoning National Socialist\n\u201crevolution\u201d might yet\n take.)[37]\n\n\nWhile both the temple and the poem thus remain quite important, only\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting directly exemplifies what Heidegger thinks it\nmeans to encounter art in a way that allows us to transcend modern\naesthetics from within. This means that Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting, far from being irrelevant,\nis actually the most important part of his essay. For, it is only\nfrom Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation of Van\nGogh\u2019s artwork that we late moderns can learn how to transcend\nmodern aesthetics from within, and thereby learn from art what it means\nto encounter being in a post-modern way. Since we have already\nsummarized Heidegger\u2019s \u201cpromethean\u201d view of the\nhistorically-revolutionary work accomplished by the ancient Greek\ntemple (in section 1.1), we will expand on the point of his return to\nGreece only briefly (in section 3.1), saying more about how this return\nto the past is supposed to help lead us into the future. The rest\nof what follows will be dedicated primarily to explaining\nHeidegger\u2019s pivotal understanding of Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting.[38]\nOur\nultimate objective will be to show how Heidegger\u2019s interpretation\nof Van Gogh allows him to move phenomenologically from the analysis of\na particular, individual (\u201contic\u201d) work of art to the\nontological structure of artwork in general. Along the way, we will\npresent the main details of the postmodern understanding of being that\nHeidegger thinks we can learn from a non-aesthetic encounter with the\nwork of art (section 3.7). Once we understand the ordered\nsequence of steps in the phenomenological interpretation whereby\nHeidegger thinks we can transcend modern aesthetics from within,\nmoreover, we will finally be able to resolve the long-standing\ncontroversy surrounding Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\n(as we will see in section 4).\n",
