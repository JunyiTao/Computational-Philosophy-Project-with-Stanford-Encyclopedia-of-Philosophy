    "main_text": "The Original Position and Social Contract Doctrine\n2. The Original Position and Social Contract Doctrine\n\nHistorically the idea of a social contract had a more limited role\nthan Rawls assigns to it. In Thomas Hobbes and John Locke the social\ncontract serves as an argument for the legitimacy of political\nauthority. Hobbes argues that in a pre-social state of nature it would\nbe rational for all to agree to authorize one person to exercise the\nabsolute political power needed to maintain peace and enforce laws\nnecessary for productive social cooperation. (Hobbes, 1651) By\ncontrast, Locke argued against absolute monarchy by contending that no\nexisting political constitution is legitimate or just unless it\ncould be contracted into starting from a position of equal\nright within a (relatively peaceful) state of nature, and without\nviolating any natural rights or duties. (Locke, 1690) For Rousseau and\nperhaps Kant too, the idea of a social contract plays a different\nrole: It is an \u201cidea of reason\u201d (Kant) depicting a point\nof view that lawmakers and citizens should adopt in their reasoning to\nascertain the \u201cgeneral will,\u201d which enables them to assess\nexisting laws and decide upon measures that promote justice and\ncitizens\u2019 common good. (Rousseau, 1762; Kant, 1793, 296\u20137;\nKant 1797, 480) Rawls generalizes on Locke\u2019s, Rousseau\u2019s\nand Kant\u2019s natural rights theories of the social contract (TJ\nvii/xviii rev.; 32/28 rev.): The purpose of his original position is\nto yield principles to determine and assess the justice of political\nconstitutions and of economic and social arrangements and the laws\nthat sustain them. To do so, he seeks in the original position\n\u201cto combine into one conception the totality of conditions which\nwe are ready upon due reflection to recognize as reasonable in our\nconduct towards one another\u201d (TJ 587/514 rev.).\n\nWhy does Rawls represent principles of justice as originating in a\nkind of social contract? Rawls says that \u201cjustice as fairness\nassigns a certain primacy to the social\u201d (CP 339). Unlike\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative procedure, the original position\nis designed to represent the predominantly social bases of justice. To\nsay that justice is predominantly social does not mean that people do\nnot have \u201cnatural\u201d moral rights and duties outside society\nor in non-cooperative circumstances\u2014Rawls clearly thinks there\nare human rights (see LP, \u00a710) and certain \u201cnatural\nduties\u201d (TJ, \u00a7\u00a719, 51) that apply to all human beings\nas such. But whatever our natural or human rights and duties may be,\nthey do not provide an adequate basis for ascertaining the rights and\nduties of justice that we owe one another as members of the same\nongoing political society. It is in large part due to \u201cthe\nprofoundly social nature of human relationships\u201d (PL 259) that\nRawls sees political and economic justice as grounded in social\ncooperation on terms of reciprocity and mutual respect. For this\nreason Rawls eschews the idea of a state of nature where pre-social\nbut fully rational individuals agree to cooperative terms (as in\nHobbesian views), or where pre-political persons with antecedent\nnatural rights agree on the form of a political constitution (as in\nLocke). Rawls regards us as social beings in the sense that in the\nabsence of society and social development we have but inchoate and\nunrealized capacities, including our capacities for rationality,\nmorality, even language itself. As Rousseau says, outside society we\nare but \u201cstupid and shortsighted animals\u201d (Rousseau, 1762,\nbk.I, ch.8, par. 1). This draws into question the main point of the\nidea of a state of nature in Hobbesian and Lockean views, which is to\ndistinguish the rights, claims, duties, powers and competencies we\nhave prior to membership in society from those we acquire as members\nof society. Not being members of some society is not an option for us.\nIn so far as we are rational and reasonable beings at all, we have\ndeveloped as members of some society, within its social framework and\ninstitutions. Accordingly Rawls says that no sense can be made of the\nnotion of that part of an individual\u2019s social benefits that\nexceed what would have been that person\u2019s situation in a state\nof nature (PL 278). The traditional idea of pre-social or even\npre-political rational moral agents thus plays no role in\nRawls\u2019s account of justice and the social contract; for him the\nstate of nature is an idea without moral significance (PL\n278\u2013280). The original position is set forth largely as an\nalternative to the state of nature and is regarded by Rawls as the\nappropriate initial situation for a social contract. (Below we\nconsider a further reason behind Rawls\u2019s rejection of the state\nof nature: it does not adequately allow for impartial judgment and the\nequality of persons.)\n\nAnother way Rawls represents the \u201cprofoundly social\u201d bases\nof principles of justice is by focusing on \u201cthe basic structure\nof society.\u201d The \u201cfirst subject of justice,\u201d Rawls\nsays, is principles that regulate the basic social institutions that\nconstitute the \u201cbasic structure of society\u201d (TJ sect.2).\nThese basic institutions include the political constitution, which\nspecifies political offices and procedures for legislating and\nenforcing laws and the system of trials for adjudicating disputes; the\nbases and organization of the economic system, including laws of\nproperty, its transfer and distribution, contractual relations, etc.\nwhich are all necessary for economic production, exchange, and\nconsumption; and finally norms that define and regulate permissible\nforms of the family, which is necessary to reproduce and perpetuate\nsociety from one generation to the next. It is the role of principles\nof justice to specify and assess the system of rules that constitute\nthese basic institutions, and determine the fair distribution of\nrights, duties, opportunities, powers and positions of office, and\nincome and wealth realized within them. What makes these basic social\ninstitutions and their arrangement the first subject for principles of\nsocial justice is that they are all necessary to social cooperation\nand have such profound influences on our circumstances, aims,\ncharacters, and future prospects. No stable, enduring society could\nexist without certain rules of property, contract, and transfer of\ngoods and resources, for they make economic production, trade, and\nconsumption possible. Nor could a society long endure without some\npolitical mechanism for resolving disputes and making, revising,\ninterpreting, and enforcing its economic and other cooperative norms;\nnor without some form of the family, to reproduce, sustain, and\nnurture members of its future generations. This is what distinguishes\nthe social institutions constituting the basic structure from other\nprofoundly influential social institutions, such as religion; religion\nand other social institutions are not basic in Rawls\u2019s sense\nbecause they are not generally necessary to social cooperation among\nmembers of society. (Even if certain religions have been ideologically\nnecessary to sustain the norms of particular societies, many societies\ncan and do exist without the involvement or support of religious\ninstitutions).\n\nAnother reason Rawls regards the original position as the appropriate\nsetting for a social contract is implicit in his stated aim in A\nTheory of Justice: it is to discover the most appropriate moral\nconception of justice for a democratic society wherein persons regard\nthemselves as free and equal citizens (TJ viii/xviii rev.). Here he\nassumes an ideal of citizens as \u201cmoral persons\u201d who regard\nthemselves as free and equal, have a conception of their rational\ngood, and have a \u201csense of justice.\u201d \u201cMoral\npersons\u201d (an 18th century term) are not all\nnecessarily morally good persons. Instead moral persons are persons\nwho are capable of being rational since they have the\ncapacities to form, revise and pursue a rational conception of their\ngood; moreover, moral persons also are capable of being\nreasonable since they have a moral capacity for a sense of\njustice\u2014to cooperate with others on terms that are fair and to\nunderstand, apply, and act upon principles of justice and their\nrequirements. Because people have these capacities, or \u201cmoral\npowers,\u201d (as Rawls calls them, following Kant) we hold them\nresponsible for their actions, and they are regarded as capable of\nfreely pursuing their interests and engaging in social cooperation.\nRawls\u2019s idea is that, being reasonable and rational, moral\npersons (like us) who regard ourselves as free and equal should be in\na position to accept and endorse as both rational and morally\njustifiable the principles of justice regulating our basic social\ninstitutions and individual conduct. Otherwise, our conduct is coerced\nor manipulated for reasons we cannot (reasonably or rationally) accept\nand we are not fundamentally free persons. Starting from these\nassumptions, Rawls construes the moral point of view from which to\ndecide moral principles of justice as a social contract in\nwhich (representatives of) free and equal persons are given the task\nof coming to an agreement on principles of justice that are to\nregulate their social and political relations in perpetuity. How\notherwise, Rawls contends, should we represent the justification of\nprinciples of justice for free and equal persons who have different\nconceptions of their good, as well as different religious,\nphilosophical, and moral views? There is no commonly accepted moral or\nreligious authority or doctrine to which they could appeal in order to\ndiscover principles of justice that all could agree to and accept.\nRawls contends that, since his aim is to discover a conception of\njustice appropriate for a democratic society, it should be justifiable\nto free and equal persons in their capacity as citizens on terms which\nall can endorse and accept. The role of the social contract is to\nrepresent this idea, that the basic principles of social cooperation\nare justifiable hence acceptable to all reasonable and rational\nmembers of society, and that they are principles which all can commit\nthemselves to support and comply with.\n\nHow is this social contract to be conceived? It is not an historical\nevent that must actually take place at some point in time (TJ 120/104\nrev.ed.). It is rather a hypothetical situation, a kind of\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d (JF 17), that is designed to uncover\nthe most reasonable principles of justice. Rawls maintains (in LHPP,\ncf. p.15) that the major advocates of social contract\ndoctrine\u2014Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant\u2014all regarded\nthe social contract, as a hypothetical event. Hobbes and Locke thus\nposited a hypothetical state of nature in which there is no political\nauthority, and where people are regarded as rational and (for Locke)\nalso reasonable. The purpose of this hypothetical social contract is\nto demonstrate what types of political constitutions and governments\nare politically legitimate, and determine the nature of\nindividuals\u2019 political obligations (LHPP p.16). The\npresumption is that if a constitution or form government could be\nagreed to by rational persons subject to it according to principles\nand terms they all accept, then it should be acceptable to rational\npersons generally, including you and me, and hence is legitimate and\nis the source of our political obligations. Thus, Hobbes argues that\nall rational persons in a state of nature would agree to authorize an\nabsolute sovereign to enforce the \u201claws of nature\u201d\nnecessary for society; whereas Locke comes to the opposite conclusion,\ncontending that absolutism would be rejected in favor of\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative assembly. Similarly, in\nRousseau and Kant, the social contract is a way to reason about the\nGeneral Will, including the political constitution and laws that\nhypothetical moral agents would all agree to in order to promote the\ncommon good and realize the freedom and equality of citizens.\n(Rousseau, 1762, I:6, p.148; II:1, p.153; II:11, p.170; Kant, 1793,\n296\u20137; Kant 1797, 480; cf. Rawls, LHPP, 214\u201348).\n\nRawls employs the idea of a hypothetical social contract for more\ngeneral purposes than his predecessors. He aims to provide principles\nof justice that can be applied to determine not only the justice of\npolitical constitutions and the laws, but also the justice of the\ninstitution of property and of social and economic arrangements for\nthe production and distribution of income and wealth, as well as the\ndistribution of educational and work opportunities, and of powers and\npositions of office and responsibility.\n\nSome have objected that hypothetical agreements cannot bind or\nobligate people; only actual contracts or agreements can impose\nobligations and commitments (Dworkin, 1977, 150ff). But the original\nposition is not intended to impose new obligations on us; rather it is\na device for discovery and justification: It is to be used, as Rawls\nsays, \u201cto help us work out what we now think\u201d (CP 402); it\nincorporates \u201cconditions\u2026we do in fact accept\u201d (TJ\n587/514 rev.) and is a kind of \u201cthought experiment for the\npurpose of public- and self-clarification\u201d (JF, p.17).\nHypothetical agreement in the original position does not then bind\nanyone to duties or commitments they do not already have. Its point\nrather is to help discover and explicate the requirements of our moral\nconcepts of justice and enable us to draw the consequences of\nconsidered moral convictions of justice that we all presumably share.\nWhether we in turn consciously accept or agree to these consequences\nand the principles and duties they implicate once brought to our\nawareness does not undermine their moral justification. The point\nrather of conjecturing the outcome of a hypothetical agreement is\nthat, if the premises underlying the original position correctly\nrepresent our most deeply held considered moral convictions and\nconcepts of justice, then we are morally and rationally committed to\nendorsing the resulting principles and duties whether or not we\nactually accept or agree to them. Not to do so implies a failure to\naccept and live up to the consequences of our own moral convictions\nabout justice.\n\nHere critics may deny that the original position incorporates\nall the relevant reasons and considered moral convictions for\njustifying principles of justice (e.g. it omits beneficence,\nor the parties\u2019 knowledge of their final ends), and/or that some\nreasons it incorporates are not relevant to moral justification to\nbegin with (such as the publicity of fundamental principles,\nas utilitarians argue, Sidgwick, 1907, or the separateness or\npersons, temporal neutrality and rationality of the\nparties in promoting their own conception of the good). (Parfit,\n1985, 163, 336; Cohen, G.A., 2009; Cohen, J., 2015,). Or they may\nargue that the state or nature, not the original position, is the\nappropriate perspective from which to ascertain fundamental principles\nof justice, since individuals moral and property rights are pre-social\nand not dependent upon social cooperation.
