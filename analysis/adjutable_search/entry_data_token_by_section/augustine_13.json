    "main_text": "History and Political Philosophy\n8. History and Political Philosophy),\n it may be asked how individual bishops can be sure of their good\nintentions when they use religious force (Rist 1994: 242\u2013245).\nAugustine does not address this problem, presumably because most of\nhis relevant texts are propagandistic defenses of coercion against the\nDonatists.\n7.4 Will and Freedom\n\nThough other Latin philosophers, especially Seneca, had made use of\nthe concept of will (voluntas) before Augustine, it has a\nmuch wider application in his ethics and moral psychology than in any\npredecessor and covers a broader range of phenomena than either\nAristotelian boulesis (roughly, rational choice) or Stoic\nprohairesis (roughly, the fundamental decision to lead a good\nlife). Augustine comes closer than any earlier philosopher to positing\nwill as a faculty of choice that is reducible neither to reason nor to\nnon-rational desire. It has therefore been claimed that Augustine\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d the will (Dihle 1982: ch. 6; Kahn 1988;\ncontrast Frede 2011: 153\u2013174 who, mainly on the basis of De\nlibero arbitrio, emphasizes Augustine\u2019s indebtedness to\nStoicism). Augustine admits both first-order and second-order\nvolitions, the latter being acts of the liberum voluntatis\narbitrium, the ability to choose between conflicting first-order\nvolitions (Stump 2001; Horn 1996; den Bok 1994). Like desires,\nfirst-order volitions are intentional or object-directed and operate\non all levels of the soul. Like memory and thought, will is a\nconstitutive element of the mind (see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God).\n It is closely related to love and, accordingly, the locus of moral\nevaluation. We act well or badly if and only if our actions spring\nfrom a good or evil will, which is equivalent to saying that they are\nmotivated by right (i.e., God-directed) or perverse (i.e.,\nself-directed) love (De civitate dei 14.7).\n With this basic idea in view, Augustine defends the passions or\nemotions against their Stoic condemnation as malfunctions of rational\njudgment by redefining them more neutrally as volitions\n(voluntates) that may be good or bad depending on their\nintentional objects (De civitate dei 9.4\u20135; 14.9;\nWetzel 1992: 98\u2013111; Byers 2012b). The mechanics of the will in\nAugustine\u2019s moral psychology is strongly indebted to the Stoic\ntheory of assent, which it however modifies in at least one respect.\nAs in Stoicism, the will to act is triggered by an impression\ngenerated by an external object (visum). To\nthis the mind responds with an appetitive motion that urges us to\npursue or to avoid the object (e.g., delight or fear). But only when\nwe give our inner consent to this impulse or withhold it, does a will\nemerge that, circumstances permitting, results in a corresponding\naction. The will is the proper locus of our moral responsibility\nbecause it is neither in our power whether an object presents itself\nto our senses or intellect nor whether we take delight in it (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.74; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.21), and our\nattempts to act externally may succeed or fail for reasons beyond our\ncontrol. The only element that is in our power is our will or inner\nconsent, for which we are therefore fully responsible. Thus, a person\nwho has consented to adultery is guilty even if his attempt actually\nto commit it is unsuccessful, and a victim of rape who does not\nconsent to the deed keeps her will free of sin even if she feels\nphysical pleasure (De civitate dei 1.16\u201328). Augustine\ntherefore defines sin as \u201cthe will to keep or pursue something\nunjustly\u201d (De duabus animabus 15). The second stage in\nthe above structure, the involuntary appetitive motion of the soul, is\nreminiscent of the Stoic \u201cfirst motions\u201d, but it also\ncorresponds to the \u201cimpulse\u201d, which in Stoicism does not\nprecede consent but follows it and immediately results in action.\nTemptations of this kind are, in Augustine, not personal sins but due to\noriginal sin, and they haunt even the saints. Our will must be freed\nby divine grace to resist them (Contra Iulianum 6.70; see, on\nthis theory and its Stoic and Platonic background, Byers 2013:\n100\u2013150; J. M\u00fcller 2009: 157\u2013161; Sorabji 2000:\n372\u2013384; Rist 1994: 176\u2013177).\n\nAugustine\u2019s thinking about free will (liberum arbitrium\nor liberum voluntatis arbitrium) undergoes some development\nduring his career. In the 390s, opposing the dualistic fatalism of the\nManicheans, he uses the cogito-like argument (see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n to demonstrate that we are responsible for our volitions because we\nare as certain that we will as we are certain that we exist and think\n(De duabus animabus 13; De libero arbitrio 3.3;\nConfessiones 7.5; S. Harrison 1999). A contemporaneous\ndefinition of will as a movement of soul toward some object of desire\nemphasizes the absence of external constraint, and the ensuing\ndefinition of sin as an unjust volition (see above) seems to endorse\nthe principle of alternative possibilities (De duabus\nanimabus 14\u201315). In De libero arbitrio, free will\nappears as the condition of possibility of moral goodness and hence as\na great good itself; but as it is not an absolute good (which is God\nalone) but only an intermediate one, it is liable to misuse and,\nhence, also the source of moral evil (De libero arbitrio\n2.47\u201353). In his early exegesis of Paul\u2019s chapter on\ndivine election (Romans 9), Augustine is keen to establish that Paul\ndid not abolish free will (Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13\u201318). With all this,\nAugustine is basically in harmony with the traditional view of early\nChristian theology and exegesis, which is still adopted in the 420s by\nJulian of Aeclanum when he blames Augustine for having fallen back\ninto Manichean fatalism and quotes his early definitions against him\n(Julian, Ad Florum, in Contra Iulianum opus\nimperfectum 1.44\u201347). Things change with Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2 and the Confessiones. By c. 400 CE,\nAugustine had come to the conclusion that our ability to make choices\nwas seriously impaired by the fallen condition of humankind and that\nit made little sense to talk about free will without reference to\ngrace. The optimistic-sounding claim in the first book of De\nlibero arbitrio (1.25\u201326; 29) that it is in our power to be\ngood as soon as we choose to be good because \u201cnothing is as\ncompletely in our will as will itself\u201d was probably never the\nwhole story; already in book 3 of the same work Augustine says that\nthe cognitive and motivational deficiencies caused by Adam\u2019s sin\n(\u201cignorance and difficulty\u201d, ib. 3.52; S. Harrison 2006:\n112\u2013130) seriously compromise our natural ability to choose the\ngood, and in his later, especially anti-Pelagian work he radicalizes\nthis to the idea that original sin makes us unable to completely\nsubdue our sinful volitions as long as we live, so that we live in a\npermanent state of \u201cakrasia\u201d or weakness of will (De\nnatura et gratia 61\u201367; De civitate dei 19.4;\nDe nuptiis et concupiscentia 1.35). But he never questions\nthe principle that we have been created with the natural ability to\nfreely and voluntarily choose the good, nor does he ever deny the\napplicability of the cogito argument to the will (cf. De civitate\ndei 5.10) or doubt that our volitions are imputable to us. What\ngrace does is to restore our natural freedom; it does not compel us to\nact against our will. What this means is best illustrated by the\nnarrative of Confessiones 8 (for particularly lucid\ninterpretations, see Wetzel 1992: 126\u2013138; J. M\u00fcller 2009:\n323\u2013335). Immediately before his conversion Augustine suffers\nfrom a \u201cdivided will\u201d, feeling torn apart between the will\nto lead an ascetic Christian life and the will to continue his\nprevious, sexually active life. Though he identifies with the former,\nbetter will rather than with the latter that actually torments him, he\nis unable to opt for it because of his bad habits, which he once\nacquired voluntarily but which have by now transformed into a kind of\naddictive necessity (ib. 8.10\u201312). Earlier philosophical\ntraditions would have interpreted this \u201cakratic\u201d state as\na conflict of reason and desire, and Manichean dualism would have\nattributed Augustine\u2019s bad will to an evil substance present in\nbut foreign to the soul, but Augustine insists that both wills were\nindeed his own. Using medical metaphors reminiscent of Hellenistic\nmoral philosophy, he argues that his will lacked the power of free\nchoice because the disease of being divided between conflicting\nvolitions had weakened it (ib. 8.19; 21). His ability to choose is\nonly restored when, in the garden scene at the end of the book, his\nwill is reintegrated and healed by God\u2019s call, which immediately\nfrees him to opt for the ascetic life (ib. 8.29\u201330). Before,\nwhen he had just continued his habitual way of life, this had been a\nnon-choice rather than a choice, even though, as Augustine insists, he\nhad done so voluntarily. In substance, this remained his line of\ndefense when, in the Pelagian controversy, he was confronted with the\ncharge that his doctrine of grace abolished free will (De spiritu\net littera 52\u201360; cf. De correptione et gratia 6).\nWhile the Pelagians thought that the principle of alternative\npossibilities was indispensable for human responsibility and divine\njustice, Augustine accepts that principle only for the first humans in\nparadise (Contra Iulianum opus imperfectum 1.47; 5.28;\n5.40\u201342 etc.). In a way, by choosing wrongly Adam and Eve have\nabandoned free will both for themselves and for all humankind.\nOriginal sin transformed our initial ability not to sin into an\ninability not to sin; grace can restore ability not to sin in this\nlife and will transform it into inability to sin in the next (De\ncivitate dei 22.30; De correptione et gratia 33).\n7.5 Will and Evil\n\nAugustine\u2019s notion of will is closely related to his thinking on\nevil. The problem of the origin of evil (unde malum), he\nclaims, had haunted him from his youth (Confessiones 7.7). At\nfirst, he accepted the dualist solution of the Manicheans, which freed\nGod from the responsibility for evil but compromised his omnipotence\n(ib. 3.12; 7.3). After having encountered the books of the Platonists,\nAugustine rejected the existence of an evil substance and endorsed the\nNeoplatonic view (argued e.g., in Plotinus, Enneads I.8) that\nevil is in fact unsubstantial and a privation or corruption of\ngoodness. In his mature view, which was largely developed during his\nanti-Manichean polemics, everything that has being is good insofar as\nit has been created by God. There are of course different degrees of\ngoodness as well as of being (Letter 18.2),\n but everything that is real is good \u201cin its degree\u201d, and\nthe hierarchical order of reality is itself a good creation of God\n(Bouton-Touboulic 2004). Augustine therefore rejects Plotinus\u2019\nview that prime matter is equivalent to prime evil, because the\nformlessness of matter is not pure negativity but a positive, and\nhence divinely created, capacity to receive forms\n(Confessiones 12.6; see\n 10. Creation and Time).\n A created being can be said to be evil if and only if it falls short\nof its natural goodness by being corrupted or vitiated; strictly\nspeaking, only corruption itself is evil, whereas the nature or\nsubstance or essence (for the equivalence of the terms see De\nmoribus 2.2) of the thing itself remains good\n(Confessiones 7.18; Contra epistulam fundamenti\n35.39 etc.; for a systematic account, De natura boni\n1\u201323; Sch\u00e4fer 2002: 219\u2013239). While this theory can\nexplain physical evil relatively easily either as a necessary feature\nof hierarchically ordered (corporeal) reality (De ordine\n2.51), as a just punishment of sin, or as part of God\u2019s pedagogy\nof salvation (Letter 138.14), it leaves open the question of\nmoral evil or sin itself. Augustine answers by equating moral evil\nwith evil will\n and claims that the seemingly natural question of what causes evil\nwill is unanswerable. His most sustained argument to this effect is\nfound in his explanation of the fall of the devil and the evil angels,\na case that, being the very first occurrence of evil in the created\nworld, allows him to analyze the problem in its most abstract terms\n(De civitate dei 12.1\u20139; cf. already De libero\narbitrio 3.37\u201349; Sch\u00e4fer 2002: 242\u2013300;\nMacDonald 1999). The cause can neither be a substance (which, qua\nsubstance, is good and unable to cause anything evil) nor a will\n(which would in turn have to be an evil will in need of explanation).\nTherefore, an evil will has no \u201cefficient\u201d but only a\n\u201cdeficient\u201d cause, which is none other than the\nwill\u2019s spontaneous defection from God. The fact that evil agents\nare created from nothing and hence are not, unlike God, intrinsically\nunable to sin is a necessary condition of evil but not a sufficient\none (after all the good angels successfully kept their good will). In\nthis context Augustine, in an interesting thought experiment, imagines\ntwo persons of equal intellectual and emotional disposition of whom\none gives in to a temptation while the other resists it; from this he\nconcludes that the difference must be due to a free, spontaneous and\nirreducible choice of the will (De civitate dei 12.6). Here\nat least Augustine virtually posits the will as an independent mental\nfaculty.\n7.6 Grace, Predestination and Original Sin\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, Augustine\u2019s theology of grace has\nbeen regarded as the heart of his Christian teaching, and with good\nreason. As he points out himself, his conviction that human beings in\ntheir present condition are unable to do or even to will the good by\ntheir own efforts is his most fundamental disagreement with ancient,\nespecially Stoic, virtue ethics (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012). After and because of the disobedience of Adam and\nEve, we have lost our natural ability of self-determination, which can\nonly be repaired and restored by the divine grace that has manifested\nitself in the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ and works inwardly\nto free our will from its enslavement to sin.\n Confession of sins and humility are, therefore, basic Christian\nvirtues and attitudes; the philosophers\u2019 confidence in their own\nvirtue that prevents them from accepting the grace of Christ is an\nexample of the sinful pride that puts the self in the place of God and\nwas at the core of the evil angels\u2019 primal sin (De civitate\ndei 10.29).\n\nThe main inspiration for Augustine\u2019s doctrine of grace is, of\ncourse, Paul (even though remarks on human weakness and divine help\nare not absent from the ancient philosophical tradition and especially\nfrom Platonism which had had a strong religious side from the\nbeginning; Augustine claims that with such utterances the Platonists\ninadvertently \u201cconfess\u201d grace, cf. De civitate\ndei 10.29; 22.22). The radical view that the gifts of grace\ninclude not only external good works and the internal volitional\ndisposition that allows us to perform them but even the very first\nbeginnings of faith\u2014in later technical terminology: that grace\nis not \u201ccooperative\u201d but radically\n\u201cprevenient\u201d\u2014is however his own, and it took several\nyears to take shape in his thought. There is some debate on the stages\nof this development (for diverging reconstructions, see\nKarf\u00edkov\u00e1 2012; Cary 2008a; Drecoll 2004\u20132010;\nDrecoll 1999; emphasis on the shifts in Augustine\u2019s thinking:\nLettieri 2001; Flasch 1995; emphasis on continuity: C. Harrison 2006),\nbut it is generally agreed that Augustine\u2019s doctrine of grace\nreached its mature form c. 395\u2013397 with Ad Simplicianum\n1.2, after several years of intense reading and exegesis of Paul, and\ngained higher profile during the Pelagian controversy after 412.\nAugustine emphasizes the necessity of grace for both intellectual\nunderstanding and moral purification already in his earliest works\n(cf. esp. Soliloquia 1.2\u20136), but seems to have been\nconcerned to leave room for human initiative at least with respect to\nfaith and will (which would be in line with his concern, prominent\nthroughout the 390s, to safeguard human responsibility against\nManichean fatalism). In his early exegesis of Paul, he explains\nGod\u2019s apparently gratuitous election of Jacob and rejection of\nEsau (Romans 9:10\u201313) with God\u2019s foreknowledge of\nJacob\u2019s faith and Esau\u2019s infidelity (De diversis\nquaestionibus 68.5; Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 60), a \u201csynergistic\u201d\nreading that relies on the assumption that salvation results from the\ncooperation of divine grace and human initiative and that had been\nstandard in early Christianity since Origen. This explanation is\nexplicitly rejected in Ad Simplicianum (1.2.5\u20136; 8;\n11). In this pivotal text, Augustine, true to his program of\n\u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d,\n attempts an exegesis of Romans 9:9\u201329 that satisfies the\nphilosophical requirements of God\u2019s justice and benevolence\nwhile taking seriously the Pauline point that God\u2019s election is\nentirely gratuitous and not occasioned by any human merit. The guiding\nintention of Romans 9, Augustine now says, is to preclude vainglory\nand pride (ib. 1.2.2) rather than to safeguard human responsibility\n(as had been his view in Expositio quarundam propositionum ex\nepistula apostoli ad Romanos 13\u201318). Augustine rehearses\nall possible reasons for God\u2019s election of Jacob\u2014his good\nworks, his good will, his faith and God\u2019s foreknowledge of\neach\u2014and discounts them all as amounting to an election from\nmerit rather than from grace. Starting from the primordial willingness\nto heed God\u2019s call to faith, then, everything that is good in\nJacob must be considered a gift of divine grace. Free will has nothing\nto do with the reception of that gift because nobody can will to\nreceive a divine call to faith nor to respond positively to it so as\nto act accordingly and perform good works out of love (Ad\nSimplicianum 1.2.21; for the Stoically-inspired theory of agency\nbehind this see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom).\n While gratuitous election is, apart from being consoling,\ncomparatively easily squared with the axioms of divine benevolence,\njustice and omnipotence, its corollary, the equally gratuitous\nreprobation and damnation of Esau, is a serious philosophical problem\n(ib. 1.2.8). If it is not to violate the principle of God\u2019s\njustice, it obliges us to assume some kind of evil in Esau, which is\nhowever excluded by Paul\u2019s explicit statement to the contrary\n(Romans 9:11). Augustine\u2019s solution is his doctrine of original\nsin. Both Jacob and Esau have inherited Adam\u2019s guilt that his\nsin has spread over all humankind\u2014a debt that God remits for\nJacob but exacts from Esau for reasons that, Augustine admits,\nnecessarily elude human understanding but are certainly just. Since\nthe Fall, humankind is nothing but a \u201clump of sin\u201d that\nGod might justly have damned as a whole but from which he has chosen\nto save some individuals and to transform them into \u201cvessels of\nmercy\u201d (ib. 1.2.16, cf. Romans 9:23). The notion of original sin\nwas not invented by Augustine but had a tradition in African\nChristianity, especially in Tertullian.\n The view that original sin is a personally imputable guilt that\njustifies eternal damnation is, however, new with Ad\nSimplicianum and follows with logical necessity from the\nexegetical and philosophical claims made there about divine grace and\nelection (Flasch 1995; contrast De libero arbitrio\n3.52\u201355). The theory of Ad Simplicianum is illustrated,\nwith great philosophical acumen and psychological plausibility, in the\nConfessiones (especially bk. 8) and remains in place during\nthe Pelagian controversy till the end of Augustine\u2019s life.\nCuriously, however, there are passages even in his anti-Pelagian work\nthat seem aimed at safeguarding freedom of choice and, accordingly,\nadmit of a \u201csynergistic\u201d reading (De spiritu et\nlittera 60; Cary 2008a: 82\u201386 and, for a different\ninterpretation, Drecoll 2004\u20132010: 207\u2013208). After 412,\npressed by his Pelagian opponents, Augustine paid increasing attention\nto the mechanics of the transmission of original sin. The result was a\nquasi-biological theory that associated original sin closely with\nsexual concupiscence (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality).\n\nAn obvious implication of Augustine\u2019s theory of grace and\nelection is predestination, a subject prominent in his last treatises\nagainst the Pelagians (e.g., De praedestinatione sanctorum,\nwritten after 426) but already implied in Ad Simplicianum.\nGod decides \u201cbefore the constitution of the world\u201d\n(Ephesians 1:4), i.e., (in Neoplatonic terms) in the non-temporal way\nthat matches his transcendent, eternal being (De civitate dei\n11.21; see also\n 10. Creation and Time),\n who will be exempted from the damnation that awaits fallen humankind\nand who will not (\u201cdouble predestination\u201d). This knowledge\nis however hidden to human beings, to whom it will only be revealed at\nthe end of times (De correptione et gratia 49).\n Until then, nobody, not even a baptized Christian, can be sure\nwhether grace has given her true faith and a good will and, if so,\nwhether she will persevere in it till the end of her life so as to be\nactually saved (De correptione et gratia 10\u201325; cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n Like the Stoic determinists before him, Augustine was confronted with\nthe objection that his doctrine of predestination made all human\nactivity pointless (\u201cLazy Argument\u201d). While in Hellenism\nthis had largely been a theoretical issue, it acquired practical\nrelevance under the circumstances of monastic life: some North African\nmonks objected to being rebuked for their misbehavior with the\nargument that they were not responsible for not (yet) enjoying the\ngift of divine grace (De correptione et gratia 6). Taking up\nideas from De magistro\n and from Ad Simplicianum, Augustine replies that rebuke may\nwork as an external admonition, even as a divine calling, that helps\npeople turn to God inwardly and hence must not be withheld (De\ncorreptione et gratia 7\u20139). To the query that\npredestination undermines free will, Augustine gives his usual answer\nthat our freedom of choice has been damaged by original sin and must\nbe liberated by grace if we are to develop the good will necessary for\nvirtue and happiness. The medieval and modern debate on whether grace is\n\u201cirresistible\u201d is, therefore, to some extent\nun-Augustinian (cf. Wetzel 1992: 197\u2013206); some, especially\nlater, texts do however present prevenient grace as converting the\nwill with coercive force (Contra duas epistulas Pelagianorum\n1.36\u201337; cf. already Ad Simplicianum 1.2.22; Cary\n2008a: 105\u2013110). A problem related to predestination but not\nequivalent to it is divine foreknowledge (Matthews 2005: 96\u2013104;\nWetzel 2001; for general discussion, Zagzebski 1991). Augustine\ninherits it from the Hellenistic discussion on future contingents and\nlogical determinism that is best documented in Cicero\u2019s De\nfato. His solution is that while external actions may be\ndetermined, inner volitions are not. These are certainly foreknown by\nGod but exactly as what they are, i.e., as ours and as volitions and\nnot as external compulsions (De civitate dei 5.9\u201310;\ncf. De libero arbitrio 3.4\u201311). This argument is\nindependent of the doctrine of grace and original sin; it applies not\njust to fallen humankind but also to Adam and Eve and even to the\ndevil, whose transgression God had, of course, foreseen (De\ncivitate dei 11.17; 14.11).\n8. History and Political Philosophy\n\nAugustine\u2019s City of God is not a treatise of political\nor social philosophy. It is an extended plea designed to persuade\npeople \u201cto enter the city of God or to persist in it\u201d\n(Letter 2*.3). The criterion of membership in the city of God\n(a metaphor Augustine takes from the Psalms, cf. Psalm 86:3 quoted,\ne.g., in De civitate dei 11.1) and its antagonist, the\nearthly city, is right or wrong love.\n A person belongs to the city of God if and only if he directs his\nlove towards God even at the expense of self-love, and he belongs to\nthe earthly city or city of the devil if and only if he postpones love\nof God for self-love, proudly making himself his greatest good (De\ncivitate dei 14.28). The main argument of the work is that true\nhappiness, which is sought by every human being (ib. 10.1),\n cannot be found outside the city of God founded by Christ (cf. ib. 1,\nprologue). The first ten books deconstruct, in a manner reminiscent of\ntraditional Christian apologetics, the alternative conceptions of\nhappiness in the Roman political tradition (which equates happiness\nwith the prosperity of the Empire, thus falling prey to evil demons\nwho posed as the defenders of Rome but in fact ruined it morally and\npolitically) and in Greek, especially Platonic, philosophy (which,\ndespite its insight into the true nature of God, failed to accept the\nmediation of Christ incarnate out of pride and turned to false\nmediators, i.e., deceptive demons; bks. 8\u201310 have an interesting\ndisquisition on Platonic demonology). Augustine\u2019s approach in\nthe second, positive half is Scriptural, creationist and\neschatological; this fact accounts for the specific character of its\nhistorical dimension. The history of the two cities begins with the\ncreation of the world and the defection of the devil and the sin of\nAdam and Eve (bks. 11\u201314); it continues with the\nprovidentially-governed vicissitudes of the People of Israel (the\nfirst earthly representative of the city of God) and, after the coming\nof Christ, of the Church (bks. 15\u201317, supplemented by a survey\nof the concurrent secular history from the earliest Eastern empires to\ncontemporary Rome in bk. 18); and it ends with the final destination\n(finis, to be understood both ethically as \u201cultimate\ngoal\u201d and eschatologically as \u201cend of times\u201d) of the\ntwo cities in eternal damnation and eternal bliss (bks. 19\u201322;\nfor the structure and basic ideas of the City of God see\nO\u2019Daly 1999). To a great extent, Augustine\u2019s approach is\nexegetical; for him, the history of the city of God is, in substance,\nsacred history as laid down in Scripture (Markus 1970: 1\u201321).\nObviously, however, the heavenly and earthly cities must not be\nconfounded with the worldly institutions of the church and the state.\nIn history, each of these, and the Church in particular, is a mixed\nbody in which members of the city of God and the earthly city coexist,\ntheir distinction being clear only to God, who will separate the two\ncities at the end of times (ib. 1.35; 10.32 etc.). While the city of\nGod is a stranger or, at best, a resident alien (peregrinus:\nib. 15.1; 15.15) in this world and yearns for its celestial homeland,\nthe earthly city is not a unified body at all but lies in continuous\nstrife with itself because it is dominated by lust for power, the most\nwidespread form of the archetypal sin of pride in political and social\nlife (ib. 18.2). All this is in agreement with Augustine\u2019s ideas\non predestination and grace;\n the history of the two cities is essentially the history of fallen\nhumanity. This dualistic account is however qualified when, in the\npart of the work that moves closest to social philosophy, Augustine\nanalyzes the attitude a Christian ought to adopt to the earthly\nsociety she inevitably lives in during her existence in this world.\nStarting, again, from the axiom that all human beings naturally desire\nwhat is good for them, he innovatively determines the goal that every\nindividual and every community in fact pursues as \u201cpeace\u201d\n(pax), which, in his view, is largely equivalent with natural order and subordination. There are higher and lesser degrees of both individual\nand collective peace, e.g., the control of the emotions through\nreason, the subordination of body to soul, the subordination of\nchildren to parents in the family or a functioning hierarchical order\nin the state; at the top is \u201cpeace with God\u201d or the\nsubordination of the human mind to God (ib. 19.13; Weissenberg 2005).\nThe lower forms of peace are relative goods and, as such, legitimately\npursued as long as they are not mistaken for the absolute good.\nPolitical peace and order is sought by members of the city of God and\nthe earthly city alike, but whereas the latter \u201cenjoy\u201d it\nbecause it is the greatest good they can attain and conceive of, the\nformer \u201cuse\u201d it for the sake of their peace with God,\ni.e., in order that they and others may enjoy an unhindered Christian\nreligious life (ib. 19.17; 19.26; for \u201cenjoyment\u201d and\n\u201cuse\u201d see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n Political peace is thus morally neutral insofar as it is a goal\ncommon to Christians and non-Christians. Augustine criticizes Cicero\nbecause he included justice in his definition of the state (Cicero,\nDe re publica 1.39) and thereby gave the earthly state an\ninherent moral quality that in reality is the privilege of the city of\nGod (De civitate dei 19.21). He himself prefers a more\npragmatic definition that makes the consensus about a common object of\n\u201clove\u201d (i.e., a common good agreed on by all members of\nthe community) the criterion of a state; the moral evaluation is not a\nmatter of the definition but depends on the evaluation of the goal it\npursues (cf.\n 7.3 Love).\n The early Roman Empire, which strove for glory, was more tolerable\nthan the Oriental empires that were driven by naked lust for power;\nthe best imaginable goal pursued by an earthly society would be\nperfect earthly peace (ib. 19.24; Weithman 2001: 243\u20134).\nChristians are allowed and even called to work for the well-being of\nthe societies they live in as long as they promote earthly peace for\nthe sake of their citizens\u2019 and their own true happiness; in\npractice, this will usually mean furthering Christian religion (ib.\n5.25\u20136, on the Christian emperors Constantine and Theodosius;\nLetter 155.12; 16; Dodaro 2004b; Tornau 2013). But the doctrine\nof the two cities deliberately precludes any promotion of\nthe emperor or the empire to a providential and quasi-sacred rank. Not\neven Christians in power will be able to overcome the inherent\nwretchedness of fallen humanity (De civitate dei 19.6). Like\nthe vast majority of ancient Christian theologians, Augustine has\nlittle or no interest in social reform. Slavery, meaning unnatural\ndomination of humans over humans, is a characteristic stain of\npostlapsarian human life and, at the same time, an evil that is put to\ngood effects when it secures social order (ib. 19.15; Rist 1994:\n236\u2013239). War results from sin and is the privileged means of\nsatisfying lust for power (ib. 18.2; 19.7). Nevertheless, Augustine\nwrote a letter to refute the claim that Christianity advocated a\npolitically impracticable pacifism (Letter 138). His\nChristian reinterpretation of the traditional Roman Just War Theory\nshould be read in the framework of his general theory of virtue and\npeace (Holmes 1999). To be truly just according to Augustinian\nstandards, a war would have to be waged for the benefit of the\nadversary and without any vindictiveness, in short, out of love of\nneighbor, which, in a fallen world, seems utopian (Letter\n138.14). Wars may however be relatively just if they are defensive and\nproperly declared (cf. Cicero, De officiis 1.36\u201337) or\ncommanded by a just authority even short of the special case of the\nwars of the People of Israel that were commanded by God himself\n(Contra Faustum 22.74\u201378).\n",
