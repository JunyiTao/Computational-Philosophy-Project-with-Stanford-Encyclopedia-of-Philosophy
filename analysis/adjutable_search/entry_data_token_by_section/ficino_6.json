    "main_text": "Philosophical themes || The \u201cancient theology\u201d\n3.1 The \u201cancient theology\u201d\n\n\nFicino considered himself a Platonist, but a Platonist in a very\nspecific mold: as part of a long tradition of which Plato was a key\npart but which needed interpreters to keep it going. This\n\u201cancient theology\u201d included figures who, divinely\ninspired, advanced true philosophy. One of the key figures in this\nsequence was the ancient sage Hermes \u201cTrismegistus\u201d\n(\u201cthrice great,\u201d because he was considered the greatest\nking, philosopher, and priest). For Ficino, as for the late ancient\nPlatonists he admired, Hermes was an ancient Egyptian, roughly\ncontemporary with Moses. In the early seventeenth century, Isaac\nCasaubon would prove that the writings attributed to Hermes could not\nhave been as ancient as they were believed to be (they are considered\nnow to be products of late antiquity). Ficino described the ancient\ntheology in this fashion in his Preface to his Latin translation of\nthe Hermetic Corpus, discussing Hermes as first in this chain\nof sages (Ficino 1576, 1836, cit. and tr. in Copenhaver and Schmitt\n1992, 147):\n\n\nAmong philosophers he first turned from physical and mathematical\ntopics to contemplation of things divine, and he was the first to\ndiscuss with great wisdom the majesty of God, the order of demons, and\nthe transformations of souls. Thus, he was called the first author of\ntheology, and Orpheus followed him, taking second place in the ancient\ntheology. After Aglaophemus, Pythagoras came next in theological\nsuccession, having been initiated into the rites of Orpheus, and he\nwas followed by Philolaus, teacher of our divine Plato.  In this way,\nfrom a wondrous line of six theologians emerged a single system of\nancient theology, harmonious in every part.\n\n\nAfter the year 1469, Ficino changed the order and placed Zoroaster\nfirst, linking him to the Magi who visited the infant Christ (Allen\n1998, 1\u201349). Unphilosophical though such speculations might seem\nto modern readers, there are at least two ways in which Ficino\u2019s\nancient theology manifested ties to what, in his era, could be\nconsidered part of philosophy. First, the model of\n\u201csuccessions\u201d (Latin \u201csuccessiones\u201d, Greek\n\u201cdiadochai\u201d) would have been intuitively familiar to many\nthinkers. At its most emblematic in Diogenes Laertius\u2019s\nLives of the Philosophers, the \u201csuccession\u201d model\nposited the notion that a powerful initial figure, whose style of life\nand doctrines were considered exemplary, would have founded a\n\u201cschool\u201d in which many others had followed. (The 1433\ntranslation into Latin of Diogenes Laertius\u2019 Lives\nvaulted it onto Renaissance thinkers\u2019 desks; it had a significant\npredecessor in the Middle Ages in a series of Lives then attributed to\nWalter Burley, though see now Grignaschi). Second, and more\npowerfully, like medieval thinkers before him, Ficino saw\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d as linked domains,\nwith philosophy as subordinate to theology (Marenbon 2000, esp.\nstudies XII and XV). \u201cPhilosophers\u201d could only be\nconsidered authentic lovers of wisdom if they graduated from\ndisputatious word games, which Ficino thought were commonly taught as\ndialectic, to the source of ultimate truth.\n",
