    "main_text": "Epistemology: Direct realism and the doctrine of immediate justification || Early M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas on the epistemic status of Vedic testimony\n2.1 Early M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas on the epistemic status of Vedic testimony\n\n\nIt is relevant to begin with Kum\u0101rila\u2019s characteristic\nepistemological doctrine not only because this is widely thought to be among his most characteristic philosophical contributions, but also\nbecause Kum\u0101rila appeals to the epistemological intuitions\nelaborated in this doctrine in arguing, as well, for a great many of\nhis other claims; indeed, the commonsense realism reflected in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology represents a useful way into his overall\nphilosophical project, which is shot through with essentially realist\ncommitments. Thus, for example, Kum\u0101rila was strongly critical of\nthe doctrine of svasa\u1e43vitti\n(\u201cself-awareness\u201d), which is arguably foundational for the\nBuddhists Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti; it is particularly\ninsofar as that doctrine figures in a generally representationalist\nepistemology\u2014one that is to be understood as part of a larger\nBuddhist case for epistemic and perhaps even metaphysical\nidealism\u2014that Kum\u0101rila will have no truck with the idea,\ninstead affirming that what we are immediately aware of is just the\nordinary objects we typically take ourselves to be aware of.\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s guiding intuition, then, is that we are generally\njustified in taking awareness as veridically disclosing precisely the\nkind of world it seems to us to disclose.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s development of a comprehensive epistemological\norientation along these lines is occasioned by \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on the second of Jaimini\u2019s\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras. So, having announced\nin the first s\u016btra that the \u201cdesire to know\ndharma\u201d is the constitutive concern of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Jaimini then says in the second\ns\u016btra that \u201cdharma is a goal defined by [Vedic]\ninjunction (codan\u0101)\u201d\u2014that, in other words,\nwhat is epistemically authoritative with respect to what\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas take to be the summum bonum is just\nthe texts of the Vedas (and more precisely, those injunctive passage\nthat enjoin the execution of particular ritual acts). This amounts to\nthe generally epistemological claim that among the various ways of\nknowing available to us, the linguistic items that are Vedic texts\nuniquely represent \u201creliable epistemic warrants\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) with regard to dharma.\n\n\nIndian philosophers, particularly under the influence of the Ny\u0101ya\ntradition of thought (and of the appropriation and systematization of\nits main terms of art by the Buddhists Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti), were generally preoccupied by Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ntime with the issue of pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2014with the\nquestion of which doxastic practices (perception, inference, testimony,\netc.) should be reckoned as \u201cepistemic criteria\u201d or\n\u201creliable doxastic practices\u201d (as we might render\npram\u0101\u1e47a), and with characterizing the criteria so\nidentified. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s Buddhist opponents\ncharacteristically affirmed, in this regard, that only perception and\ninference had this status, and that all other ways of arriving at\nbeliefs were somehow reducible to one of these. Proponents of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 chiefly affirmed, in contrast, not\nonly that there is an irreducibly and distinctively linguistic\nway of knowing, but indeed that it is this (and not perception) that\nshould be understood as most significant. For while it is in\nthe nature of perception to bear only on actually present states of\naffairs\u2014the salient point of Jaimini\u2019s fourth s\u016btra,\non perception, is that this consists in the kind of sensory cognition\nhad when there is contact with something present\n(satsa\u1e43prayoge)\u2014language alone has the capacity\nto engender awareness of future, or \u201cto-be-realized\u201d\n(bh\u0101vya), states of affairs. Insofar, then, as the\ndharma that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas are most interested in\nis just such a state of affairs, the fact of perception\u2019s bearing\nonly on what is (as it were) ready-to-hand is to be reckoned a\ndeficiency. The epistemological project for proponents of this school\nthus becomes that of making sense of the unique epistemic authority of\nthe kinds of Vedic injunctions (paradigmatically, \u201cone desirous\nof heaven should perform the agnihotra sacrifice\u201d) that\nwould not fare well on any account that instead privileged\nperception.\n\n\nTo that end, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s predecessor \u015aabara argued that\nlinguistic utterances engender some cognition\n(avabodhayati), and that as long as the idea thus engendered\nis clear or \u201cdeterminate\u201d (ni\u015bcita), one is\nentitled to accept it as a basis for action. Of a sentence such as\n\u201cone desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice,\u201d then,\n\u015aabara would mainly ask:\u00a0 do you understand the\nsentence? If not, then the sentence is reasonably disregarded\nowing to its engendering an essentially doubtful\n(sa\u1e43digdham) cognition; but insofar as the sentence\nmakes an epistemically contentful claim, we are entitled to judge the\nprima facie unambiguous cognition thus brought about to be\nfalse only if it is explicitly falsified\u2014only if we have, that is, knowledge to the effect that someone has not gone\nto heaven as a result of having performed the agnihotra\nsacrifice. Determinately contentful linguistic cognitions that have not\nbeen falsified are reasonably taken, then, as bases for action.\n",
