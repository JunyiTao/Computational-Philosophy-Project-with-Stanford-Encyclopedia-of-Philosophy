    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Providence\n6.6 Providence\n\n\nOn the importance of the active intellect not only for a Maimonidean\ntheory of epistemology and psychology, but theology and ethics as\nwell, we might note that for Maimonides, as for his Islamic\npredecessors and contemporaries, the active intellect, in its intimate\nrelationship with human intellects, lies also the heart of a theory of\nprovidence:\n\n\n\u2026providence watches over everyone endowed with intellect\nproportionately to the measure of his intellect\u2026The providence\nof God, may He be exalted, is constantly watching over those who have\nobtained this overflow\u2026For the thing that necessarily brings\nabout providence and deliverance from the sea of chance consists in\nthat intellectual overflow\u2026 (G 3.51, 624-5)\n\n\n\n\nWhile not here mentioned explicitly, it is indeed the active intellect\nthat, in the context of Maimonides' Neoplatonized Aristotelian\ncontext, is the cosmic source of the \u201cintellectual\noverflow\u201d under discussion in this passage. As such, the active\nintellect emerges as the cosmic underpinning for Maimonides' mechanics\nof providence: The more in touch a person's intellect is with the\nactive intellect, the more we may say of her that she is \u201cliving\nprovidentially.\u201d As Maimonides notes, \u201cprovidence watches\nover everyone endowed with intellect proportionately to the measure of\nhis intellect\u2026\u201d (G 3.51, 624). Taken in the context of\nMaimonides' theory of active intellect as that cosmic intermediary\nresponsible for human intellectual actualization, the above claim\nsuggests that \u201cdivine providence\u201d is found in one's\nability to conjoin to the active intellect. This, of course, is a\ndecidedly naturalized understanding of providence: far from a hand of\nGod intervening in the lives of men, divine providence here emerges as\nthe properly directed life that one who conjoins with active\nintellect\u2014and who, as such, attains the heights of knowledge\navailable to the human mind\u2014will be more readily able to\nlive.\n\n\nStressing further the theological and ethical import of the active\nintellect, we find him, at the very end of his treatise, speaking of\nthis overflow in urgent tones:\n\n\nA call to attention. We have already made it clear to you that that\nintellect which overflowed from Him, may He be exalted, toward us is\nthe bond between us and Him. You have the choice: if you wish to\nstrengthen and to fortify this bond, you can do so; if, however, you\nwish gradually to make it weaker and feebler until you cut it, you can\nalso do that. You can only strengthen this bond by employing it in\nloving Him and in progressing toward this\u2026And it is made weaker\nand feebler if you busy your thought with what is other than\nHe\u2026 (G 3.51, P 621)\n\n\n\n\nPlacing Maimonides in his Islamic philosophical context, we can say\nthat Maimonides is here\u2014in his reference to \u201cthat\nintellect which overflowed from Him\u201d\u2014adverting to the\ndoctrine of active intellect as key to human knowledge:\n\n\nIt is fitting that your attention be roused to the nature of that\nwhich exists in the divine overflow coming toward us, through which we\nhave intellectual cognition\u2026 (G 2.37, P 373)\n\n\n\n\nWe might here also note the strong affinity between Maimonides\u2019 and\nAverroes\u2019 naturalized views of providence. As we saw above (see\nsection 3 on God), for Averroes God is the final cause who moves the\nseparate intellects which in turn move the heavens which in turn gives\nrise to the natural heat which, by actualizing forms, activates the\nentire motion and reality of nature. It is precisely this set of ideas\nthat lies at the heart of Averroes\u2019 conception of divine providence\n(\u2018in\u0101ya All\u0101h) as the well-ordered functioning\nof species (and of individuals under their species) as a result of\nGod\u2019s functioning as the final cause in this way. While there are\ndifferent ways to read Maimonides\u2019 final view on providence, this\nAverroean view ought be treated as a serious possibility.
