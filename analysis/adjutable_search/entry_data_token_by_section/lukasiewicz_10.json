    "main_text": "Many-Valued Logic || Second Thoughts on Modality: System \u0141\n5.5 Second Thoughts on Modality: System \u0141\n\nFrom 1917, \u0141ukasiewicz had been happy with the three-valued logic\nas formulating adequate notions of modality, with the noted preference\nfor the infinite-valued system as optimally precise. At some time,\nprobably around 1951\u201352, when he was working on\nAristotle\u2019s modal logic, \u0141ukasiewicz changed his mind.\nThere are a number of reasons behind the change of mind but the\neasiest to identify is \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s concern that in \u0141\\(_3\\)\nthere are theorems of the form\n\\(L\\alpha\\), for example \\(LCpp\\). Why should this be a concern, given\nthat most \u201cstandard\u201d modal logics recognize the principle\nthat if \\(\\alpha\\) is a theorem, so is \\(L\\alpha\\)? \u0141ukasiewicz\ngives two examples to justify the worry. If \\({=}ab\\) is the\nproposition that \\(a\\) is identical with \\(b\\), then basing identity\non the two axioms of self-identity and extensionality \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& {=}aa \\\\\n & C{=}abC{\\phi}a{\\phi}b \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nthen instantiating \\(L{=}a\\apos\\) for \\(\\phi\\) gives \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& C{=}abCL{=}aaL{=}ab \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nand if we accept \\(L{=}aa\\) we are forced to conclude that \\(L{=}ab\\),\nwhich \u0141ukasiewicz thinks is false (SW 392, AS\n171), citing Quine\u2019s (1953) example (now outdated because the\nnumber has changed) that while it\u2019s true that 9 = the number of\nplanets, this is not necessarily true, although necessarily 9 = 9.\nDually, we have \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& CMN{=}abN{=}ab \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nthat is, if \\(MN{=}ab\\) then \\(N{=}ab\\). But suppose a is\nreplaced by \u201cthe number thrown on this throw of this die\u201d\nand b by \u201cthe number thrown on the next throw of this\ndie\u201d the antecedent can be true and the consequent false.\n\nIn the wake of much subsequent discussion of such examples by Quine,\nKripke and others, these examples are hardly convincing, but there is\nanother more general reason why \u0141ukasiewicz rejects necessities\nas theorems:\n\nit is commonly held that apodeictic propositions have a higher dignity\nand are more reliable than corresponding assertoric ones. This\nconsequence is for me by no means evident. [\u2026] I am inclined to\nthink that all systems of modal logic which accept asserted apodeictic\npropositions are wrong. (SW 395\u20136).\n\n\nSince \\(LCpp\\) is a theorem of all the systems of many-valued logic to\ndate, \u0141ukasiewicz needed to come up with something new. This he\ndid in his 1953 paper \u201cA System of Modal Logic\u201d.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz begins the paper by laying out the conditions that a\nmodal logic needs to satisfy. These include axiomatic rejections as\nwell as assertions, as follows: \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& \\vdash CpMp \\\\\n & \\dashv CMpp \\\\\n & \\dashv Mp \\\\\n & \\vdash CLpp \\\\\n & \\dashv CpLp \\\\\n & \\dashv NLp \\\\\n & \\vdash EMpNLNp \\\\\n & \\vdash ELpNMNp \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nTo obtain a system of modal logic respecting extensionality for\npropositional functors, \u0141ukasiewicz takes Meredith\u2019s axiom\nfor \\(C\\)-\\(N\\)-\\(\\delta\\) propositional calculus \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& \\vdash C\\delta pC\\delta Np\\delta q \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nand adds one more axiomatic assertion and two axiomatic rejections\n\n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& \\vdash CpMp \\\\\n & \\dashv CMpp \\\\\n & \\dashv Mp \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\ntogether with rules of substitution and detachment for both assertion\nand rejection, to obtain his logic. The principles for assertion are\nas usual, while those for rejection are:\n\n\\(\\dashv\\) Substitution: Any formula which has a rejected substitution\ninstance is rejected.\n\n\\(\\dashv\\) Detachment: If \\(Cab\\) is asserted and \\(b\\) is rejected\nthen \\(a\\) is rejected.\n\nFrom these he can derive all the desired principles and\nextensionality.\n\nThis is the logic \u0141. Unlike standard modal logics, it has a\nfinite characteristic matrix, as follows, where like \u0141ukasiewicz\nwe now replace \u2018\\(M\\)\u2019 by a new symbol\n\u2018\\(\\Delta\\)\u2019, with 1 as the designated (true) value and 4\nthe antidesignated (false) value:\n\n\n\n\\(C\\)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\\(N\\)\n\\({\\Delta}\\) \n\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n4\n1 \n\n2\n1\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1 \n\n3\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n3 \n\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3  \n\n\nThe matrix was proved characteristic by Smiley in 1961. Functors of\nnecessity (\\(\\Gamma\\)) and conjunction are definable in the standard\nway. More intriguingly, \u0141ukasiewicz notes that there is another\npossibility operator \\(\\nabla\\) with the truth-table also given\nbelow:\n\n\n\n\\(K\\)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\n\\({\\nabla}\\) \n\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n2\n1 \n\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\n2 \n\n3\n3\n4\n3\n4\n4\n1 \n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n2  \n\n\nTaken in isolation, this is indistinguishable from \\(\\Delta\\), but the\ntwo operators together interact differently, for while \\(\\dashv\n\\Delta\\Delta p\\) and \\(\\dashv \\nabla\\nabla p\\), both \\(\\vdash\n\\Delta\\nabla p\\) and \\(\\vdash \\nabla\\Delta p\\). \u0141ukasiewicz\ncompares them to twins which are indistinguishable separately but\ndistinguishable together. Similar twins are the necessity operator\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and its counterpart (with values 3434), and indeed the two\nintermediate truth-values 2 and 3.\n\nThe logic is very unlike \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s earlier multivalent\nsystems and also very unlike other modal systems. It is unlike his own\nsystems in that it is an extension of classical bivalent logic and\nincludes all bivalent tautologies. This is less surprising when we\nnote that the four-valued matrices for the standard connectives are\nsimply the Cartesian product of the standard bivalent matrices with\nthemselves. It is the modal operators that make the difference.\nSeveral features make this very unlike standard modal systems. One is\nthe complete lack of any truths, let alone theorems, of the form\n\\(\\Gamma a\\), in line with \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s rejection of\ntruths of \u201chigher dignity\u201d. Other odd theorems are:\n\n\\(\\vdash CK{\\Delta}p{\\Delta}q{\\Delta}Kpq\\)\n\nall possible propositions are compossible\n\n\\(\\vdash CEpqC{\\Delta}p{\\Delta}q\\)\n\nmaterially equivalent propositions are both possible if one is\n\n\\(\\vdash C{\\Delta}pC{\\Delta}Np{\\Delta}q\\)\n\nif a proposition and its negation are both possible, anything is\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz was aware of many of these odd consequences, but\ncontinued to uphold his system. Despite a number of attempts to make\nsense of the system, it has generally been concluded that because of\nthese oddities it is not really a system of modal logic. If there is\none dominant reason for this it is \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s adherence\nto the principle of extensionality (truth-functionality) even for\nmodal operators, which forced his account of modality to go\nmultivalent in the first place.\n",
