They\nserved as the vehicle through which he conveyed his critical\nassessment of Spanish and European cultures. Upon his departure for\nGermany in 1905, the dominant intellectual issue among the\nintelligentsia had been the regeneration of Spain and the fundamental\nquestion, \u201cwhat is to be done: \u2018Hispanization or\nEuropeanization?\u2019\u201d Upon his return in 1908, the question\nremained the central theme of protracted discussions, the only\naddition being the critical ideas of Ortega. In a 1908 issue of\nFaro, the Conservative historian and politician Gabriel Maura\ny Gamazo (1879\u20131963) first coined the designation\n\u201cGeneration of 1898\u201d, which was popularized by the\nnovelist Azor\u00edn (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ru\u00edz,\n1873\u20131967), a member of the group, in subsequent newspaper\narticles in 1910 and 1913. On February 23, 1908, Maura engaged in\npolemical exchanges with Ortega and referred to \u201cthe generation\nthat arrives today; a generation born intellectually at the root of\nthe disaster\u201d (Obras, X: 31\u201338). The Generation\nof 1898 acquired their name as the events of the Spanish American War\nunfolded, which presented the perception of national catastrophe and\nprovided a context for their national and social criticisms. Spaniards\nperceived the war as a national disaster, and the Generation of 1898\ncame together to discuss what they considered to be the degeneration\nof Spain.\n\nIn June 1908 Ortega was appointed professor of ethics, logic and\npsychology at La Escuela Superior del Magisterio (Normal School),\nwhich he had helped found. In late October, at the Assembly for the\nProgress of Science held in Zaragoza, he spoke vehemently in favor of\nregenerating Spain by broadening her horizons within European thought.\nOrtega pursued these issues with his former professor of Greek at the\nUniversity of Salamanca, Unamuno, but reproached him for preferring to\n\u201cAfricanize\u201d Europe than to \u201cEuropeanize\u201d\nSpain, a conviction that led to a parting of ways the following year\n(Obras, I: 64). On October 8, 1910, in an open competition,\nOrtega appeared before a jury established to select a successor to the\nchair of metaphysics, left vacant after the death of Nicol\u00e1s\nSalmer\u00f3n (1838\u20131908). A month later, he received the\nprofessorship at the Central University of Madrid, at the remarkable\nage of twenty-seven. Six months earlier, on April 7, 1910, Ortega\nmarried his fianc\u00e9e, Rosa Spottorno y Topete, and from January\nto October 1911, the couple spent a delayed honeymoon in Germany,\nassisted by a grant issued through the Ministry of Public Education\nfor further study and research. His first son, Miguel Germ\u00e1n,\nwas born in Marburg on May 28, 1911. The symbolic name reveals the\nimportance of Cervantes and Germany for Ortega. At the end of\nDecember 1911, Ortega returned to Madrid to assume his teaching\nduties, and in January 1912, took up the position of professor of\nmetaphysics, a chair he occupied for twenty-four years, with only two\nbrief interruptions: once in 1929, when he resigned to protest the\nencroachments on academic freedom during the dictatorship of Miguel\nPrimo de Rivera; and again, in 1931, when Ortega become one of the\nfirst members of the Constituent Cortes at the beginning of the second\nSpanish Republic until he was exiled from Spain at the outbreak of the\nSpanish Civil War in 1936.\n",
