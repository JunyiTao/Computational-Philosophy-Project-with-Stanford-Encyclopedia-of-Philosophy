    "main_text": "\n\nLa Logique ou l\u2019art de penser (Logic, or the Art of\nThinking) is better known as the Port-Royal Logic\n(hereinafter Logic). It was one of the most influential\npieces of philosophy written in the early modern period. This\ninfluence took two main forms. It was in many ways the most widely\nread text in formal logic from Aristotle to the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. It emphasized general principles of careful thinking over the\nmemorization of complicated formal rules found in traditional texts.\nThe result is a relatively compact work written in vernacular instead\nof the imposing Latin tomes otherwise available. Its readability is\nenhanced by long digressions devoted to moralizing and to recent\nadvances in scientific understanding. As a result serious readers,\n\u201ccan read and understand in seven or eight days\u201d, or so\nthe authors claim (Logic, 13). It also served as a kind of\nhandbook of some basic aspects of Cartesian and post-Cartesian science\nand philosophy.\n\nThe authors were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, philosophers and\ntheologians associated with the Port-Royal Abbey, a center of the\nheretical Catholic Jansenist movement in seventeenth-century France.\nThe first edition appeared in 1662; during the authors\u2019\nlifetimes four major revisions were published, the last and most\nimportant in 1683. The 1981 critical edition by Pierre Clair and\nFran\u00e7ois Girbal lists 63 French editions and 10 English\neditions (the 1818 English edition served as a text at the\nUniversities of Cambridge and Oxford). The work treats topics in what\nare now regarded as the theory of knowledge, metaphysics, philosophy\nof language, grammar, philosophical logic, and both formal and\ninformal logic. The Logic is a companion to General and\nRational Grammar: The Port-Royal Grammar, written primarily by\nArnauld and \u201cedited\u201d by Claude Lancelot, which had\npreviously appeared in 1660.\n\nSection 1 of this article briefly explains Arnauld\u2019s connection\nto the Port-Royal Abbey and the Jansenist movement. This is important\nbackground for understanding the outlook Logic adopts toward\nits subject matter. For the same reason, general aspects of the\nLogic\u2019s relationship of Cartesian philosophy are\nreviewed in Section 2. An overview of the work\u2019s four part\nstructure follows in Section 3. Each part of the book is then covered\nin turn.\n\nIn this article, references to the Logic are given by the\nPart, Chapter, and page number in Buroker\u2019s 1996 English\ntranslation listed in the Bibliography.\n",
