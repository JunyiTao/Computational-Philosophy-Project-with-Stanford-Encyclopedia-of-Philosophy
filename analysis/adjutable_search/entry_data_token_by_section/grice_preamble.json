    "main_text": "\n\nHerbert Paul Grice, universally known as Paul, was born on March 13,\n1913 in Birmingham, England and died on August 28, 1988 in Berkeley\nCA. Grice received firsts in classical honours moderation (1933) and\nliterae humaniores (1935) from Corpus Christi College,\nOxford. After a year teaching in a public school, he returned to\nOxford where, with a nearly five year interruption for service in the\nRoyal Navy, he taught in various positions until 1967 when he moved to\nthe University of California-Berkeley. He taught there past his\nofficial 1979 retirement until his death in 1988. He was\nphilosophically active until his death\u2014holding discussions at\nhis home, giving lectures and editing a collection of his work that\nwas posthumously published as Studies in the Way of Words. He\nis best known for his innovative work in philosophy of language, but\nalso made important contributions to metaphysics, ethics and to the\nstudy of Aristotle and Kant. His work continues to be influential (and\ncontroversial) outside of philosophy in linguistics and artificial\nintelligence. Although relatively little work was published during his\nlife, he had a very wide influence via lectures and unpublished\nmanuscripts. The best known of these were the William James Lectures\nwhich he gave at Harvard in early 1967 and which circulated widely in\nunauthorized manuscript form until they were published as part of\nStudies in the Way of Words. He also played cricket, chess\nand piano, each at a very high level of accomplishment. A useful\nbiography including both Grice\u2019s personal and professional life\nis Chapman 2005; the review by Potts provides more perspective on some\nof the points.\n",
