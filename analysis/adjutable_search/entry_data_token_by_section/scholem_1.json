    "main_text": "Early Work\n2. Early Work\n\n\nScholem's early work consists of two main areas of research.\nFrom 1921 (while still in Germany) until around 1936 Scholem spent\nuntold hours collecting and analyzing every kabbalistic manuscript he\ncould locate. This required traveling to various libraries in Europe.\nOnce he arrived in Palestine he concentrated on the growing collection\nof Hebrew manuscripts located at the new National Library. This taxing,\narduous, and tedious work created a data base for Scholem that would\nserve his entire career. During this same period he undertook a series\nof highly critical reviews and essays on previous scholars who dealt\nwith Kabbala, most of which were published in the German-Jewish journal\nDer Jude and some in Hebrew Keriat Sefer a\njournal of Jewish Bibliography centered in Jerusalem. These early book\nreviews constitute an important \u2014 and often overlooked\u2014part of\nScholem's career. It is here that he distinguishes himself from\nhis predecessors and develops the beginning of his historiographical\napproach that would only emerge in the next period of his research. His\ndissertation Das Buch Bahir was published in Leipzig in1923.\nHis first major publications after his dissertation were Kitvei Yad\nha-Kabbala, 1930; Perakim le-Toldot sifrut\nha-Kabbala,1931; and Bibliographia Kabbalistica, 1927,\nall bibliographical works examining his discoveries. In addition he\npublished more theoretical studies such as \u201cKabbalat R.\nYa'akov ve-R. Yizhak [ha-Cohen],\u201d 1927; \u201cHa-Mekubal\nR. Avraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi\u201d 1925, 26 and \u201cDie Theologie\ndes Sabbatianismus im Lichte Abraham Cardosos\u201d in 1928. Parts of\nthese studies would appear later in more expanded works dealing with\nvarious kabbalistic periods. In short, Scholem began his publishing\ncareer by first absorbing the entire scope of the history of Kabbala\nand then slowly putting it together from the earliest period until the\nlatest (Hasidism).\n",
