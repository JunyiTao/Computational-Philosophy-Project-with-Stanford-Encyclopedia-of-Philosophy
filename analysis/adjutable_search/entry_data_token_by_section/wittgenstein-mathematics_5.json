Thus, on Wittgenstein\u2019s account, a particular\nproof by mathematical induction should be understood in the following\nway.\n\n\n\nInductive Base:\n\\(\\phi(1)\\) \n\nInductive Step:\n\\(\\phi(n) \\rightarrow \\phi(n + 1)\\) \n\nProxy Statement:\n\\(\\phi(m)\\) \n\n\n\nHere the \u2018conclusion\u2019 of an inductive proof [i.e.,\n\u201cwhat is to be proved\u201d (PR \u00a7164)] uses\n\u2018\\(m\\)\u2019 rather than \u2018\\(n\\)\u2019 to indicate that\n\u2018\\(m\\)\u2019 stands for any particular number, while\n\u2018\\(n\\)\u2019 stands for any arbitrary number. For\nWittgenstein, the proxy statement \u201c\\(\\phi(m)\\)\u201d\nis not a mathematical proposition that \u201cassert[s] its\ngenerality\u201d (PR \u00a7168), it is an\neliminable pseudo-proposition standing proxy for the proved\ninductive base and inductive step. Though an inductive proof\ncannot prove \u201cthe infinite possibility of\napplication\u201d (PR \u00a7163), it enables us \u201cto\nperceive\u201d that a direct proof of any\nparticular proposition can be constructed (PR\n\u00a7165). For example, once we have proved \u201c\\(\\phi(1)\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\phi(n) \\rightarrow \\phi(n + 1)\\)\u201d, we need not\nreiterate modus ponens \\(m - 1\\) times to prove the\nparticular proposition \u201c\\(\\phi(m)\\)\u201d (PR\n\u00a7164). The direct proof of, say, \u201c\\(\\phi\\)(714)\u201d\n(i.e., without 713 iterations of modus ponens) \u201ccannot\nhave a still better proof, say, by my carrying out the derivation as\nfar as this proposition itself\u201d (PR \u00a7165).\n\nA second, very important impetus for Wittgenstein\u2019s radically\nconstructivist position on mathematical induction is his rejection of\nan undecidable mathematical proposition.\n\n\nIn discussions of the provability of mathematical propositions it is\nsometimes said that there are substantial propositions of mathematics\nwhose truth or falsehood must remain undecided. What the people who\nsay that don\u2019t realize is that such propositions, if we\ncan use them and want to call them \u201cpropositions\u201d, are not\nat all the same as what are called \u201cpropositions\u201d in other\ncases; because a proof alters the grammar of a proposition.\n(PG 367)\n\n\nIn this passage, Wittgenstein is alluding to Brouwer, who, as early as\n1907 and 1908, states, first, that \u201cthe question of the validity\nof the principium tertii exclusi is equivalent to the question\nwhether unsolvable mathematical problems exist\u201d,\nsecond, that \u201c[t]here is not a shred of a proof for the\nconviction\u2026 that there exist no unsolvable mathematical\nproblems\u201d, and, third, that there are meaningful\npropositions/\u2018questions\u2019, such as \u201cDo there\noccur in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) infinitely many pairs of\nconsecutive equal digits?\u201d, to which the Law of the\nExcluded Middle does not apply because \u201cit must be\nconsidered as uncertain whether problems like [this] are\nsolvable\u201d (Brouwer, 1908 [1975: 109\u2013110]). \u201cA\nfortiori it is not certain that any mathematical problem can either be\nsolved or proved to be unsolvable\u201d, Brouwer says (1907 [1975:\n79]), \u201cthough HILBERT, in \u2018Mathematische Probleme\u2019,\nbelieves that every mathematician is deeply convinced of\nit\u201d.\n\nWittgenstein takes the same data and, in a way, draws the opposite\nconclusion. If, as Brouwer says, we are uncertain whether all\nor some \u201cmathematical problems\u201d are solvable, then we\nknow that we do not have in hand an applicable\ndecision procedure, which means that the alleged mathematical\npropositions are not decidable, here and now. \u201cWhat\n\u2018mathematical questions\u2019 share with genuine\nquestions\u201d, Wittgenstein says (PR \u00a7151), \u201cis\nsimply that they can be answered\u201d. This means that if we do not\nknow how to decide an expression, then we do not know how to\nmake it either proved (true) or refuted (false), which means\nthat the Law of the Excluded Middle \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply\u201d\nand, therefore, that our expression is not a mathematical\nproposition.\n\nTogether, Wittgenstein\u2019s finitism and his criterion of\nalgorithmic decidability shed considerable light on his highly\ncontroversial remarks about putatively meaningful conjectures\nsuch as FLT and GC. GC is not a mathematical proposition because we do\nnot know how to decide it, and if someone like G. H. Hardy\nsays that he \u2018believes\u2019 GC is true (PG 381;\nLFM 123; PI \u00a7578), we must answer that s/he\nonly \u201chas a hunch about the possibilities of extension of the\npresent system\u201d (LFM 139)\u2014that one can only\nbelieve such an expression is \u2018correct\u2019 if one\nknows how to prove it. The only sense in which GC (or FLT)\ncan be proved is that it can \u201ccorrespond to a proof by\ninduction\u201d, which means that the unproved inductive step (e.g.,\n\u201c\\(G(n) \\rightarrow G(n + 1)\\)\u201d) and the expression\n\u201c\\(\\forall nG(n)\\)\u201d are not mathematical propositions\nbecause we have no algorithmic means of looking for an induction\n(PG 367). A \u201cgeneral proposition\u201d is senseless\nprior to an inductive proof \u201cbecause the question would only\nhave made sense if a general method of decision had been known\nbefore the particular proof was discovered\u201d\n(PG 402). Unproved \u2018inductions\u2019 or inductive\nsteps are not meaningful propositions because the Law of the Excluded\nMiddle does not hold in the sense that we do not know of a decision\nprocedure by means of which we can prove or refute the expression\n(PG 400; WVC 82).\n\nThis position, however, seems to rob us of any reason to search for a\n\u2018decision\u2019 of a meaningless \u2018expression\u2019 such\nas GC. The intermediate Wittgenstein says only that \u201c[a]\nmathematician is\u2026 guided by\u2026 certain analogies with the\nprevious system\u201d and that there is nothing \u201cwrong or\nillegitimate if anyone concerns himself with Fermat\u2019s Last\nTheorem\u201d (WVC 144).\n\n\nIf e.g. I have a method for looking at integers that satisfy the\nequation \\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\\), then the formula \\(x^{n} + y^n = z^{n}\\)\nmay stimulate me. I may let a formula stimulate me. Thus I shall say,\nHere there is a stimulus\u2014but not a question.\nMathematical problems are always such stimuli. (WVC 144, Jan.\n1, 1931)\n\n\nMore specifically, a mathematician may let a senseless conjecture such\nas FLT stimulate her/him if s/he wishes to know whether a calculus can\nbe extended without altering its axioms or rules (LFM\n139).\n\n\nWhat is here going [o]n [in an attempt to decide GC] is an\nunsystematic attempt at constructing a calculus. If the attempt is\nsuccessful, I shall again have a calculus in front of me, only a\ndifferent one from the calculus I have been using so far.\n(WVC 174\u201375; Sept. 21, 1931; italics added)\n\n\nIf, e.g., we succeed in proving GC by mathematical induction (i.e., we\nprove \u201c\\(G(1)\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(G(n) \\rightarrow G(n +\n1)\\)\u201d), we will then have a proof of the inductive step, but\nsince the inductive step was not algorithmically decidable beforehand\n(PR \u00a7\u00a7148, 155, 157; PG 380), in\nconstructing the proof we have constructed a new calculus, a\nnew calculating machine (WVC 106) in which we\nnow know how to use this new \u201cmachine-part\u201d\n(RFM VI, \u00a713) (i.e., the unsystematically proved\ninductive step). Before the proof, the inductive step is not a\nmathematical proposition with sense (in a particular calculus),\nwhereas after the proof the inductive step is a mathematical\nproposition, with a new, determinate sense, in a newly created\ncalculus. This demarcation of expressions without mathematical sense\nand proved or refuted propositions, each with a determinate sense in a\nparticular calculus, is a view that Wittgenstein articulates in myriad\ndifferent ways from 1929 through 1944.\n\nWhether or not it is ultimately defensible\u2014and this is an\nabsolutely crucial question for Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of\nMathematics\u2014this strongly counter-intuitive aspect of\nWittgenstein\u2019s account of algorithmic decidability, proof, and\nthe sense of a mathematical proposition is a piece with his\nrejection of predeterminacy in mathematics. Even in the case\nwhere we algorithmically decide a mathematical proposition, the\nconnections thereby made do not pre-exist the algorithmic decision,\nwhich means that even when we have a \u201cmathematical\nquestion\u201d that we decide by decision procedure, the expression\nonly has a determinate sense qua proposition when it is\ndecided. On Wittgenstein\u2019s account, both middle and later,\n\u201c[a] new proof gives the proposition a place in a new\nsystem\u201d (RFM VI, \u00a713), it \u201clocates it in the\nwhole system of calculations\u201d, though it \u201cdoes not\nmention, certainly does not describe, the whole system of calculation\nthat stands behind the proposition and gives it sense\u201d\n(RFM VI, \u00a711).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s unorthodox position here is a type of\nstructuralism that partially results from his rejection of\nmathematical semantics. We erroneously think, e.g., that GC has a\nfully determinate sense because, given \u201cthe misleading way in\nwhich the mode of expression of word-language represents the sense of\nmathematical propositions\u201d (PG 375), we call to mind\nfalse pictures and mistaken, referential conceptions of\nmathematical propositions whereby GC is about a mathematical\nreality and so has just a determinate sense as \u201cThere exist\nintelligent beings elsewhere in the universe\u201d (i.e., a\nproposition that is determinately true or false, whether or\nnot we ever know its truth-value). Wittgenstein breaks with this\ntradition, in all of its forms, stressing that, in\nmathematics, unlike the realm of contingent (or empirical)\npropositions, \u201cif I am to know what a proposition like\nFermat\u2019s last theorem says\u201d, I must know its\ncriterion of truth. Unlike the criterion of truth for an\nempirical proposition, which can be known before the\nproposition is decided, we cannot know the criterion of truth for an\nundecided mathematical proposition, though we are \u201cacquainted\nwith criteria for the truth of similar propositions\u201d\n(RFM VI, \u00a713).\n",
