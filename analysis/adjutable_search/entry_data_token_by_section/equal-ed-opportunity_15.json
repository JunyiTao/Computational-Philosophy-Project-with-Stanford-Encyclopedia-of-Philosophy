    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity\u2019s Tensions with Other Values || Disability\n4.2 Disability\n\nIndividuals with cognitive and physical disabilities have been\nmarginalized, denied resources, and even denied an education. Can a\nconception of equality of educational opportunity accommodate those\nwith cognitive and physical disabilities? Some critics claim that\ntheories of justice focus unduly on meeting the demands of reciprocity\nand cooperation as a pre-condition to equal opportunity and other\ndemands of justice, and in doing so, exclude some individuals with\ndisabilities from those entitlements. Some argue that we need new\ntheories (Kittay 1999; Barnes 2016) while others argue that existing\ntheories and approaches can be applied to or extended to include\nindividuals with disabilities (Stark 2013; Robeyns 2006; Brighouse\n2001). In education, treating individuals with disabilities the same\nas those without does not always suffice to treat all equally, for\ndisabilities sometimes give rise to special needs and requirements and\nthis raises challenges for \u2018inclusion\u2019 (Warnock 2005). In\norder to avoid these challenges it seems that we might need to endorse\ndifferential treatment, which can lead to stigma and division and has\nbeen associated with educational segregation. This gives rise to what\nhas been called the \u201cdilemma of difference\u201d and pertains\nto decisions about whether students with disabilities should be\neducated in the same class as students without disabilities. Placing\ndisabled children in mainstream schools or classes may lead to\nbullying, as Mary Warnock (2005) has noted, but placing disabled\nchildren in separate settings may further entrench the wide-spread\nsocial stigma associated with disability, even when there is much that\ncan be done to ensure disability is not an obstacle to learning.\nFurther debates focus on the extent to which (at least some of) the\ndisadvantages of disability may be detached from the disability itself\nand the extent to which they are attached only in virtue of social\norganization or social attitudes, which we could and should alter. For\ninstance, if the dominant modes of communication in our society were\nsign-based rather than spoken, perhaps deafness would not be\nconsidered a disability. Likewise, where braille translations are\nreadily available, the blind do not face a disability with respect to\nreading (Sparrow 2005). In the case of education, the design of the\nschool or the curriculum can determine whether a disability is an\nobstacle to learning. For some discussion of this debate see Terzi\n2005.\n\nDisability may be thought to pose problems for various conceptions of\nequality of educational opportunity and can strengthen well-known\nobjections. For example, it poses problems for those who endorse a\nmeritocratic allocation of advantageous positions, such as FEO. If one\nof the primary goals of an education system is to ensure fair\ncompetition for jobs, many people with disabilities will likely face\ngreater and even insurmountable obstacles to becoming the most\nmeritorious candidate. Recall that FEO requires equal prospects for\nthe equally naturally talented and ambitious. Some of those with\ndisabilities do not have similar or equal natural talent with others\nvying for opportunities, even if these differences could be\ncompensated for through education. Meritocratic equality of\nopportunity also appears to neglect some people with disabilities, by\ninterpreting merit in terms of inborn potentials. FEO and meritocratic\nequality of opportunity are consistent with providing very low or even\nno educational opportunities to some cognitively disabled persons, but\nthat hardly seems like an acceptable outcome. Adequacy accounts may\nalso struggle to explain what to do when disabilities are so severe\nthat individuals cannot achieve adequate educational levels, or do so\nonly at enormous cost. If an adequate education involved at least\nacquiring a high school diploma, it is not possible for some\ncognitively impaired persons to reach this level. Since the focus of\nadequacy is on achieving that level, and these people cannot do so, it\nappears that when educational adequacy is set at these levels no\nentitlement to education for the cognitively disabled can be derived\nfrom it. This sort of example puts a lot of pressure on accounts of\nadequacy to explain at what cost adequacy is worth pursuing, and also\nchallenge those who deny that native ability is relevant to equality\nof opportunity.\n\nOne way to avoid such outcome would be to supplement these views of\nequality or adequacy of educational opportunity with other principles.\nFor example, it might be held that we owe some educational resources\neven to the severely cognitively disabled not on grounds of equality\nof opportunity but on grounds of humanity.\n",
