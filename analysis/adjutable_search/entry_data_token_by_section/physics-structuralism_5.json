    "main_text": "The problem of theoretical terms || The measurement problem\n3.3 The measurement problem\n\nBoth programs address the further problem of how to determine the\nextension, e.g., the numerical values, of a theoretical term from a\ngiven set of observational data. We will call this the\n\u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, not to be confounded with the\nwell-known measurement problem in quantum theory. Typically the\nmeasurement problem has no unique solution. Rather the values of the\ntheoretical quantities can only be measured within a certain degree of\nimprecision and using auxiliary assumptions which, although plausible,\nare not confirmed with certainty. In the above Newton example one\nwould have to use the auxiliary assumption that the trajectories of\nthe particles are twice differentiable and that other forces except\nthe gravitational forces can be neglected. For a recent critical\nexamination of the solution to the measurement problem within\nSneed\u2019s approach with detailed examples from astronomy see\nG\u00e4hde (2014).\n",
