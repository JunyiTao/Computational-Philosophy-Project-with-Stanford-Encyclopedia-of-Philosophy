    "main_text": "Secession and the Philosophy of International Law\n4. Secession and the Philosophy of International Law\n\n\nThere is yet another desideratum for a theory of secession: As\nsuggested earlier, the implications of each type of theory for\ninternational law regarding secession should be explained. And\npresumably an account of the morality of secession should provide some\nguidance for determining what the posture of international law should\nbe regarding secession. In the next section, we explore briefly the\nrelationship between views about the moral (claim-)right to unilateral\nsecession and the question of what position international law should\ntake on unilateral secession.\n\n\nThe deficiencies of existing international law regarding secession\nmotivate the project of developing principled proposals for reform. At\npresent international law recognizes only a very narrow set of\ncircumstances under which the unilateral right to secede exists as an\ninternational legal right, namely, when a group is subject to colonial\ndomination or is the victim of an unlawful occupation by a foreign\nentity or is subjected to an Apartheid-like regime. The difficulty with\nthis conception of the international legal right to unilateral\nsecession is that, while clearly embodying the idea that serious and\npersistent injustices can generate a right to unilateral secession, it\narbitrarily restricts the injustices that generate the right.\n\n\nAnother difficulty is that while international legal doctrine with\nan arbitrarily restricted conception of the situations that generate a\nunilateral right to secede, several important international legal\ndocuments include reference to an apparently much broader \u201cright\nof self-determination of all peoples\u201d which is said to include\nthe right to choose full independence, and hence the right to\n secede.[10]\n One\nway to conceive of the chief task for a moral theory of international\nlaw regarding secession is that it must provide a reasoned basis for\nremoving the arbitrary restriction from which the current law suffers,\nwhile avoiding the dangerously expansive notion that all\n\u201cpeoples\u201d are entitled to their own states, in a world in\nwhich virtually every existing state includes more than one\n\u201cpeople\u201d, in which several \u201cpeoples\u201d claim the\nsame territory, and in which there are no international institutional\nprinciples or mechanisms for sorting out these conflicting claims.\n\n\nAn important choice for the moral theorist of international law\nregarding secession regards the scope of the right itself. On one view,\ninternational law should simply acknowledge, under certain conditions\nto be specified by the theory, a group\u2019s right to its own state;\non the other view, international law should distinguish between (a) the\nconditions under which a group should be accorded the right to\nrepudiate the jurisdiction of the state over a portion of the\nstate\u2019s territory and to attempt to establish its own control\nthere and (b) the conditions under which international law should\nrecognize the secessionist entity as a legitimate state, with all the\nrights, immunities, privileges, and obligations this entails.\n\n\nThe difference between these two options can be appreciated if we\ntake the example of a remedial right only approach to proposals for\nreforming international law regarding secession. For simplicity,\nsuppose that the remedial right only theory under consideration\nrecognizes only large-scale and persistent violations of basic human\nrights as grounding the unilateral right to secede, and suppose that\ngroup G has suffered such violations. On the first\nview, the proposal is that international law should simply acknowledge\nthat G has the right to its own legitimate state if\nforming a new state is the remedy of last resort for large-scale,\npersistent violations of the basic human rights of members\nof G, where this means that other states should recognize\nthe new entity as having all the rights, privileges, immunities,\npowers, and obligations this status entails. On the second view, there\nare two distinct questions the international law of secession should\naddress: First, has G suffered large-scale and\npersistent violations of basic human rights and second,\ndoes G satisfy the conditions for recognitional\nlegitimacy, for being recognized as a legitimate state? The second view\nwould maintain that although the group\u2019s having suffered\nlarge-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights is\nsufficient for acknowledging its right to repudiate the state\u2019s\njurisdiction and attempt to set up its own state, something more is\nrequired before international law should recognize the new entity as a\nlegitimate state; in particular, the new state should provide credible\nassurances that it will respect the rights of minorities within its\nterritory.\n\n\nMaking recognition of legitimate statehood dependent in this way\nupon satisfying basic requirements of justice coheres with the remedial\nright only theory\u2019s approach to secession, which involves\nrewarding states that respect rights. But there is much to be said for\ndistinguishing, regardless of which theory of the right to secede is\nadopted, between the right to secede (understood as\nthe right to repudiate the state\u2019s authority over a portion of\nits territory and to attempt to set up a new state there) and\nthe right to recognition as a legitimate state. New\nentities created through secession typically are keen to receive\nrecognition of their legitimacy because of the benefits this confers,\nincluding access to favorable trade regimes, loans and credits from\ninternational agencies such as the World Bank and International\nMonetary Fund, and the ability to participate as an equal with other\nstates in the making of international law. Distinguishing between\nwhether a group has the right to secede (to repudiate the state\u2019s\njurisdiction and attempt to establish its own state) and whether it has\nthe right to recognition as a legitimate state enables the\ninternational legal system to impose normative conditions on\nrecognition in circumstances in which new states have strong incentives\nto satisfy them.\n\n\nA fully-developed philosophical theory of what the international law\nof secession ought to be would be quite ambitious and complex. It would\nhave to include not only an account of the connection between the right\nto secede and the right to recognition, but also a theory of justified\nintervention in support of or against secession that would cohere with\na more general position on the legitimate use of force across\nborders.\n",
