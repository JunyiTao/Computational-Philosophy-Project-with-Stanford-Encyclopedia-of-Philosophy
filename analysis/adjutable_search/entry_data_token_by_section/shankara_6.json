    "main_text": "Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity\n3. Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara does not intend his position that existence exists\nwithout objective location to be a paradox or a kind of obscurantist\nmysticism (see\n \u00a72.1\n above). He believes the world is mysterious in that it is\nindeterminable, but not so existence itself. His crucial point is that\nthe singular place to discover existence without objectifying it is\nwithin the foundation of our own phenomenal experience\u2014as\nconsciousness itself. \u015aa\u1e45kara analyzes consciousness\n(cit or caitanyam) through both perspectives of his\ntwo orders of reality. From the provisional empirical order,\nconsciousness is a witnessing presence (s\u0101k\u1e63in) by\nwhich all mental cognition is revealed as known. The absolute\nperspective strips consciousness of all relational properties,\nincluding intentionality and its status as a witness, leaving only the\nintrinsic self-illuminating nature of consciousness remaining. He\nidentifies this pure non-intentional consciousness as numerically\nidentical with nondual existence, which is brahman.\n",
