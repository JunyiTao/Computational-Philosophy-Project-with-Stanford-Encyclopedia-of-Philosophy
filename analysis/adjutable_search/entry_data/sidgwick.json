    "preamble": "\n\nHenry Sidgwick was one of the most influential ethical philosophers of\nthe Victorian era, and his work continues to exert a powerful\ninfluence on Anglo-American ethical and political theory, with an\nincreasing global impact as well. His masterpiece, The Methods of\nEthics was first published in 1874 (seventh edition: 1907) and in\nmany ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian\ntradition\u2014the tradition of Jeremy Bentham and James and John\nStuart Mill\u2014with its emphasis on \u201cthe greatest happiness\nof the greatest number\u201d as the fundamental normative demand.\nSidgwick\u2019s treatment of that position was more comprehensive and\nscholarly than any previous one, and he set the agenda for most of the\ntwentieth-century debates between utilitarians and their critics.\nUtilitarians and consequentialists from G. E. Moore and Bertrand\nRussell to J. J. C. Smart and R. M. Hare down to Derek Parfit, Peter\nSinger, and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek have acknowledged\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods as a vital source for their\narguments. But in addition to authoritatively formulating\nutilitarianism and inspiring utilitarians and their sympathizers, the\nMethods has also served as a general model for how to do\nethical theory, since it provides a series of systematic, historically\ninformed comparisons between utilitarianism and its leading\nalternatives.\n\nEven such influential critics of utilitarianism as William Frankena,\nMarcus Singer, and John Rawls looked to Sidgwick\u2019s work for\nguidance. C. D. Broad, a later successor to Sidgwick\u2019s Cambridge\nchair, famously went so far as to say \n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods of Ethics seems to me to be on the\nwhole the best treatise on moral theory that has ever been written,\nand to be one of the English philosophical classics. (Broad 1930: 143)\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Broad\u2019s assessment has been endorsed by an\nincreasing number of prominent philosophers (Parfit 2011\u20132017;\nde Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014, 2021; Crisp 2015; Phillips 2022).\nEngaging with Sidgwick\u2019s work remains an excellent way to\ncultivate a serious philosophical interest in ethics, metaethics, and\npractical ethics, not to mention the history of these subjects.\nMoreover, he made important contributions to many other fields,\nincluding economics, political theory, classics, educational theory,\nand parapsychology. His significance as an intellectual and cultural\nfigure has yet to be fully appreciated, but recent years have\nwitnessed an impressive expansion of Sidgwick studies, and he has even\nbeen featured in popular novels (Cohen 2010; Entwistle 2014). What is\nstill relatively rare is serious engagement with Sidgwick\u2019s role\nin advancing liberal imperialism and the ideology of the British\nEmpire (Schultz 2004; Bell 2016). \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Background\n\nSidgwick was born on May 31, 1838, in the small Yorkshire town of\nSkipton. The extended Sidgwick family was well-known in the area and\nquite prosperous, with their cotton-spinning mills representing the\noldest manufacturing firms in the town (Dawson 1882; Schultz 2017).\nBut Henry was the second surviving son of Mary Crofts and the Reverend\nWilliam Sidgwick, the headmaster of the grammar school in Skipton, who\ndied when Henry was only three. Henry\u2019s older brother William\nwent on to become an Oxford don, as did his younger brother Arthur.\nHis sister Mary, known as Minnie, ended up marrying a second cousin,\nEdward White Benson, who in addition to being an early mentor of\nHenry\u2019s (and Rugby master) went on to become the archbishop of\nCanterbury. The Sidgwick and Benson families would contribute much to\nEnglish letters and science over the course of the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries, though their legacies have also been\ncontroversial on some counts (Askwith 1971; Bolt 2011; Goldhill\n2016).\n\nHenry was educated at Rugby and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where\nhe took his degree in 1859. As an undergraduate, he excelled at both\nmathematics and, especially, classics, in due course becoming Craven\nScholar, 33rd Wrangler, and Senior Classic, also winning the\nChancellor\u2019s Medal. He wound up staying at Cambridge his entire\nlife, first, beginning in October of 1859, as a Fellow of Trinity and\na lecturer in classics\u2014a position that in the later sixties\nevolved into a lectureship in the moral sciences\u2014then, from\n1875, as praelector in moral and political philosophy, and finally,\nfrom 1883, as Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy. He resigned\nhis Fellowship in 1869 because he could no longer subscribe in good\nconscience to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, as\nthe position required. This act helped inspire the successful\nopposition to such requirements. In 1881 he was elected an honorary\nFellow, and in 1885, he regained a full Fellowship, remarking on the\nchanging times: \n\n\nLast time I swore that I would drive away strange doctrine; this time\nI only pledged myself to restore any College property that might be in\nmy possession when I ceased to be a Fellow. (Memoir: 400)\n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Cambridge career was rich in reformist activity\n(Rothblatt 1968; Harvie 1976; Todd 1999). As an undergraduate, he had\nbeen elected to the \u201cApostles\u201d, the secret Cambridge\ndiscussion society that did much to shape the intellectual direction\nof modern Cambridge; Sidgwick\u2019s allegiance to this group was a\nvery significant feature of his life and work (Lubenow 1998). The\n1860s, which he described as his years of \u201cStorm and\nStress\u201d over his religious views and commitments, were also the\nyears in which his identity as an academic liberal took shape, and he\ngot caught up in a range of causes emphasizing better and broader\neducational opportunities, increased professionalism, and greater\nreligious freedom. He evolved into an educational reformer committed\nto downplaying the influence of classics, introducing modern subjects,\nand opening up higher education to women. Much influenced by the\nwritings of F. D. Maurice and J. S. Mill, he would become one of the\nleading proponents of higher education for women and play a guiding\nrole in the foundation of Newnham College, Cambridge, one of the first\ncolleges for women in England (McWilliams Tullberg 1975 [1998];\nSutherland 2006). He was also active in the cause of university\nreorganization generally, in due course serving on the General Board\nof Studies, the Special Board for Moral Sciences, and the Indian Civil\nService Board, and he worked tirelessly to expand educational\nopportunities and professionalize educational efforts through such\nvehicles as correspondence courses, extension lectures, the Cambridge\nWorking Men\u2019s College, and the University Day Training College\nfor teachers (initiated by Oscar Browning). Such educational reforms\nwere, he held, also of political value in overcoming class conflict\nand social strife. But Sidgwick\u2019s broader political commitments,\nwhich ranged from academic liberal to Liberal Unionist\u2014he joined\nthe breakaway faction of the Liberal Party opposing Gladstone\u2019s\npolicy of Home Rule for Ireland\u2014to independent, were complex and\nshifting; he was not able to rise above the marked imperialistic and\norientalist, racist tendencies of the late Victorian era (Schultz\n2004; Bell 2007, 2016).\n\nIn 1876 Sidgwick married Eleanor Mildred Balfour, the sister of his\nformer student, Arthur Balfour, the future prime minister. An\naccomplished and independent woman with serious scientific\ninterests\u2014she collaborated with her brother-in-law Lord Rayleigh\non many scientific papers\u2014Eleanor Sidgwick worked as an equal\npartner with her husband on many fronts, particularly higher education\nfor women and parapsychology. She eventually took over as Principal of\nNewnham in 1892, and was for many decades a mainstay of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, an organization that Henry had helped to found\n(in 1882) and several times headed, though his interest in the\nparanormal had been evident long before. The Sidgwicks hoped that\ntheir psychical research might ultimately support some core religious\nclaims, particularly concerning the personal survival of physical\ndeath, which they deemed a vital support for morality. Their extensive\nand often quite methodologically sophisticated investigations were not\nas conclusive as they had hoped, but following Henry\u2019s death\nfrom cancer on August 28, 1900, Eleanor did become persuaded that he\nhad succeeded in communicating from \u201cthe other world\u201d. The\nSidgwicks\u2019 work in this field continues to this day to be\ndebated by academic parapsychologists (Gauld 1968; Braude 2003;\nMcLuhan & Gauld 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nAlthough Sidgwick published extensively in his lifetime, he is best\nknown for his first major book, The Methods of Ethics, which\nfirst appeared in 1874 and went through five editions during his\nlifetime. His second most widely read book would be his Outlines\nof the History of Ethics for English Readers, which appeared in\n1886 as an expanded version of the article on the subject that he had\ncontributed to the famous ninth edition of the Encyclopedia\nBritannica. But he also published The Principles of Political\nEconomy (1883), The Elements of Politics (1891), and\nPractical Ethics, A Collection of Addresses and Essays\n(1898), and after his death, Eleanor Sidgwick worked with various of\nhis former colleagues to bring out Lectures on the Ethics of T. H.\nGreen, H. Spencer, and J. Martineau (1902), Philosophy, Its\nScope and Relations (1902), The Development of European\nPolity (1903), Miscellaneous Essays and Addresses\n(1904), Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant and Other Philosophical\nLectures and Essays (1905), and Henry Sidgwick, A Memoir\n(1906), which Eleanor and Arthur Sidgwick assembled largely from his\ncorrespondence and journal. These posthumous works are typically quite\npolished and shed a great deal of light on the works that Sidgwick\nhimself saw through publication (Schneewind 1977).\n\nAs Sidgwick\u2019s publications attest, he was not only a pre-eminent\nmoral philosopher, with sophisticated views on both going\ncontroversies in ethics and metaethics and the history of these\nsubjects, but also an accomplished epistemologist, classicist,\neconomist, political theorist, political historian, literary critic,\nparapsychologist, and educational theorist. If he was a founder of the\nCambridge school of philosophy, he was also a founder of the Cambridge\nschool of economics (along with his colleague and sometimes nemesis\nAlfred Marshall) and of the Cambridge school of political theory\n(along with such colleagues as Browning and Sir John Seeley). If such\nstudents as Moore and Russell owed him much, so too did such students\nand admirers as Balfour, J. N. Keynes, F. W. Maitland, F. Y.\nEdgeworth, James Ward, Frank Podmore, and E. E. Constance Jones. He\nhad serious interests in many areas of philosophy and theology, and\nalso wrote insightfully about poetry and literature, two of his great\nloves (at Newnham, he lectured on Shakespeare, along with such\nsubjects as philosophy and economics). Indeed, Sidgwick was a force in\nthe larger cultural developments of his age, active in such\ninfluential discussion societies as the Metaphysical Society and the\nSynthetic Society. His friends included George Eliot, T. H. Green,\nJames Bryce, H. G. Dakyns, Roden Noel, and, of special importance,\nJohn Addington Symonds, the erudite cultural historian, poet, and man\nof letters who was a pioneer in the serious historical study (and\npromotion) of same sex love (Schultz 2004). Sidgwick\u2019s versatile\nand many-sided intellect\u2014not to mention his keen wit\u2014are\ntypically better displayed in his essays and letters than in his\nbest-known academic books. He was in fact much loved for his gentle\nhumor (or \u201cSidgwickedness\u201d) and sympathetic conversation,\nand his philosophical students prized him for his candor. As Balfour\nput it: \n\n\nOf all the men I have known he was the readiest to consider every\ncontroversy and every controversialist on their merits. He never\nclaimed authority; he never sought to impose his views; he never\nargued for victory; he never evaded an issue. (Memoir:\n311)\n\n2. The Methods Of Ethics And Philosophy\n2.1 Preliminaries\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods was long in the making. His\ncorrespondence with his close friend H. G. Dakyns, a Clifton master\nwho had been a private tutor for the Tennyson family, reveals how long\nand volatile the development of his ethical views was, particularly\nduring the 1860s when he was working himself free of Anglican\northodoxy. As early as 1862, he wrote to Dakyns that he was\n\u201crevolving a Theory of Ethics\u201d and working on \u201ca\nreconciliation between the moral sense and utilitarian theories\u201d\n(Memoir: 75). He started telling people that he was\n\u201cengaged on a Great Work\u201d, which would indeed turn out to\nbe the case. By 1867, much of the basic intellectual structure of the\nMethods was clearly in place; according to Marshall, at the\nfaculty discussion group known as the \u201cGrote Club\u201d,\nSidgwick \n\n\nread a long & general sketch of the various systems of morality:\nI. Absolute right II. Make yourself noble III. Make yourself happy IV\nIncrease the general happiness. In the course of it he committed\nhimself to the statement that without appreciating the effect of our\naction on the happiness of ourselves or of others we could have no\nidea of right & wrong. (quoted in Schultz 2004: 142)\n\n\nIt was also in 1867 that Sidgwick sent a draft of his pamphlet on\n\u201cThe Ethics of Conformity and Subscription\u201d to J. S. Mill,\ninviting comments. This work, part of his efforts with the Free\nChristian Union (an organization for promoting free and open religious\ninquiry), reflected his casuistical struggles over whether he had a\nright to keep his Fellowship, given his increasingly Theistic views.\nHe had been increasingly drawn to Theism, which then, as now, stressed\nthat \u201cGod\u2019s will and purpose, and God\u2019s assurance of\nan ultimate fulfilment, are behind all that is happening\u201d\n(Polkinghorne 1998: 114), but without the orthodox commitments to\nbelief in the Trinity, miracles, eternal punishment, etc.. As Sidgwick\nexplained to his sister: \n\n\nI have written a pamphlet \u2026 on the text \u201cLet every man be\nfully persuaded in his own mind\u201d. That is really the gist of the\npamphlet\u2014that if the preachers of religion wish to retain their\nhold over educated men they must show in their utterances on sacred\noccasions the same sincerity, exactness, unreserve, that men of\nscience show in expounding the laws of nature. I do not think that\nmuch good is to be done by saying this, but I want to liberate my\nsoul, and then ever after hold my peace. (Memoir: 226) \n\n\nAs he put it in the pamphlet, which appeared in 1870:\n\n\nWhat theology has to learn from the predominant studies of the age is\nsomething very different from advice as to its method or estimates of\nits utility; it is the imperative necessity of accepting unreservedly\nthe conditions of life under which these studies live and flourish. It\nis sometimes said that we live in an age that rejects authority. The\nstatement, thus qualified, seems misleading; probably there never was\na time when the number of beliefs held by each individual,\nundemonstrated and unverified by himself, was greater. But it is true\nthat we only accept authority of a particular sort; the authority,\nnamely, that is formed and maintained by the unconstrained agreement\nof individual thinkers, each of whom we believe to be seeking truth\nwith single-mindedness and sincerity, and declaring what he has found\nwith scrupulous veracity, and the greatest attainable exactness and\nprecision. (Sidgwick 1870: 14\u201315)\n\n\nThis was a vision of inquiry and even culture that Sidgwick would\npromote throughout his life, though after this point he no longer\nopenly directed his criticisms at the church. Mill had replied to his\neffort to address the question of subscription on\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cutilitarian\u201d grounds: \n\n\nWhat ought to be the exceptions \u2026 to the general duty of truth?\nThis large question has never yet been treated in a way at once\nrational and comprehensive, partly because people have been afraid to\nmeddle with it, and partly because mankind have never yet generally\nadmitted that the effect which actions tend to produce on human\nhappiness is what constitutes them right or wrong. (Mill 1867)\n\n\nMill urged Sidgwick to turn his \u201cthoughts to this more\ncomprehensive subject\u201d, and apparently when the latter did, he\nconcluded that it would not be conducive to the general happiness to\ncontinue his open attacks on organized religion. The reasons for this\nlarger conclusion are only partly evident from the Methods\nitself.\n\nSidgwick did always explicitly claim, however, that his struggles with\nthe ethics of subscription shaped the views set forth in the\nMethods. These struggles had led him \u201cback to\nphilosophy\u201d from his more theological and philological\ninvestigations\u2014for which he had learned German and Hebrew and\nstruggled with biblical hermeneutics. He found the problem of whether\nhe ought to resign his Fellowship very \n\n\ndifficult, and I may say that it was while struggling with the\ndifficulty thence arising that I went through a good deal of the\nthought that was ultimately systematised in the The Methods of\nEthics. (Memoir: 38) \n\n\nOne of the ways in which this is evident has been highlighted in the\nwork of J. B. Schneewind, whose Sidgwick\u2019s Ethics and\nVictorian Moral Philosophy (1977) was the most comprehensive and\nsophisticated commentary on Sidgwick\u2019s ethics produced in the\ntwentieth century. As part of an extensive account of the historical\ncontext of the Methods, underscoring how Sidgwick\u2019s\nwork was shaped by both the utilitarian tradition and its intuitionist\nand religious opposition (represented in part by the \u201cCambridge\nMoralists\u201d William Whewell, Julius Hare, F. D. Maurice, and John\nGrote), Schneewind argued that\n\n\nit is a mistake to view the book as primarily a defence of\nutilitarianism. It is true, of course, that a way of supporting\nutilitarianism is worked out in detail in the Methods, and\nthat there are places in it where Sidgwick seems to be saying quite\nplainly that utilitarianism is the best available ethical theory. From\nhis other writings we know also that he thinks of himself as committed\nto utilitarianism, and that he assumes it in analysing specific moral\nand political issues. Yet it does not follow that the Methods\nitself should be taken simply as an argument for that position. We\nmust try to understand it in a way that makes sense of its\nauthor\u2019s own explicit account of it. (Schneewind 1977: 192)\n\n\nThat account, as both Schneewind and Rawls have stressed, repeatedly\naffirms that the aim of the book is less practice than knowledge, \n\n\nto expound as clearly and as fully as my limits will allow the\ndifferent methods of Ethics that I find implicit in our common moral\nreasoning; to point out their mutual relations; and where they seem to\nconflict, to define the issue as much as possible. \n\n\nThat is, echoing his views on theological inquiry, he confesses\nthat:\n\n\nI have thought that the predominance in the minds of moralists of a\ndesire to edify has impeded the real progress of ethical science: and\nthat this would be benefited by an application to it of the same\ndisinterested curiosity to which we chiefly owe the great discoveries\nof physics. It is in this spirit that I have endeavoured to compose\nthe present work: and with this view I have desired to concentrate the\nreader\u2019s attention, from first to last, not on the practical\nresults to which our methods lead, but on the methods themselves. I\nhave wished to put aside temporarily the urgent need which we all feel\nof finding and adopting the true method of determining what we ought\nto do; and to consider simply what conclusions will be rationally\nreached if we start with certain ethical premises, and with what\ndegree of certainty and precision. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: vi])\n\n\nThe model for such an approach is not Bentham or even J. S. Mill, but\nAristotle, whose Ethics gave us \n\n\nthe Common Sense Morality of Greece, reduced to consistency by careful\ncomparison: given not as something external to him but as what\n\u201cwe\u201d\u2014he and others\u2014think, ascertained by\nreflection. \n\n\nThis was really, in effect, \u201cthe Socratic induction, elicited by\ninterrogation\u201d (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: xix]).\n\nAs Marcus Singer and others have observed (M. Singer 1974; Phillips\n2022), Sidgwick\u2019s notion of a \u201cmethod\u201d of ethics is\nnot the same as that of an ethical principle, ethical theory, or\nethical decision-procedure. A \u201cmethod\u201d is a way of\n\u201cobtaining reasoned convictions as to what ought to be\ndone\u201d and thus it might reflect a commitment to one or more\nethical principles as the ultimate ground of one\u2019s determination\nof what one has most reason to do, here and now, while allowing that\none might ordinarily be reasoning from such principles either directly\nor indirectly. Thus, one might, on theological grounds, hold that the\nmoral order of the universe is utilitarian, with God willing the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number, while also holding that the\nappropriate guide for practical reason is enlightened self-interest,\nsince utilitarian calculations are God\u2019s business and God has\nordered the cosmos to insure that enlightened self-interest conduces\nto the greatest happiness. In this case, one\u2019s \u201cmethod of\nethics\u201d would be rational egoism, but the ultimate philosophical\njustification for this method would appeal to utilitarian principles.\nStill, despite this emphasis on the reasoning process between\nprinciples and practical conclusions\u2014another reflection of his\nstruggles with subscription\u2014Sidgwick obviously had quite a bit\nto say in the Methods about the defense of the ultimate\nprinciples of practical reason (Crisp 2014, 2015; de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014; Phillips 2022).\n\nMany have felt that, in setting up the systematic comparison between\nthe main methods of ethics, Sidgwick was not nearly as neutral and\nimpartial as he thought, and in various ways slanted the discussion\nagainst a wide range of alternatives, including Aristotelian and other\nforms of perfectionism, Whewellian rationalism, Idealism, and more\n(Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin 1992, 2007, 2011; Hurka 2014a, 2014b). He\nsimply dismisses the traditional philosophical concern with the\n\u201cmoral faculty\u201d, explaining that he is going to leave that\nmatter to psychologists. For Sidgwick, in any given situation, there\nis something that it is right or that one ought to do, and this is the\nproper sphere of ethics. The basic concept of morality is this unique,\nhighly general notion of \u201cought\u201d or \u201cright\u201d\nthat is irreducible to naturalistic terms, sui generis,\nthough moral approbation is \n\n\ninseparably bound up with the conviction, implicit or explicit, that\nthe conduct approved is \u201creally\u201d right\u2014that is, that\nit cannot without error, be disapproved by any other mind. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 27]) \n\n\nOn this count, at least, his student G. E. Moore was willing to\ndeclare the Methods untainted by the \u201cnaturalistic\nfallacy\u201d\u2014that is, the confusion of the \u201cis\u201d of\nattribution and the \u201cis\u201d of identity that supposedly\ninfected much previous ethical theory, including that of Bentham and\nthe Mills. And indeed, it is plain that Sidgwick parted company from\nclassical utilitarianism in many ways, rejecting the empiricism,\npsychological egoism, and associationism (supposedly) characteristic\nof the earlier tradition. F.H. Hayward, who wrote one of the first\nbooks on Sidgwick\u2019s ethics, famously complained that E. E.\nConstance Jones had missed just how original Sidgwick was: \n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s identification of \u201cRight\u201d with\n\u201cReasonable\u201d and \u201cObjective\u201d; his view of\nRightness as an \u201cultimate and unanalysable notion\u201d\n(however connected subsequently with Hedonism); and his admission that\nReason is, in a sense, a motive to the will, are due to the more or\nless \u201cunconscious\u201d influence of Kant. Miss Jones appears\nto think that these are the common-places of every ethical system, and\nthat real divergences only arise when we make the next step in\nadvance. I should rather regard this Rationalistic terminology as\nsomewhat foreign to Hedonism. I do not think that Miss Jones will\nfind, in Sidgwick\u2019s Hedonistic predecessors, any such emphasis\non Reason (however interpreted). (Hayward 1901b: 361) \n\n\nSidgwick himself allowed that Kant was one of his\n\u201cmasters\u201d, and he was also quite familiar with the works\nof Hegel. Schneewind\u2019s reading (1977) has stressed this\ninfluence, along with the influence of Joseph Butler, whose works\npersuaded Sidgwick of the falsity of psychological egoism and of the\nreality of other than self-interested actions (Frankena 1992). Indeed,\nthe comparison between Sidgwick and Kant has proved to be a fertile\nand ongoing source of academic work on Sidgwick, and one of increasing\nsignificance (Parfit 2011\u20132017; Paytas 2018; Paytas &\nHenning [eds] 2020; Phillips 2022)\n\nHowever, despite the considerable influence Kant and\nKantianism\u2014and the Cambridge Moralists\u2014exercised on\nSidgwick, the Methods also deviated from some stock features\nof such views, among other things rejecting the issue of free will as\nlargely irrelevant to ethical theory and failing to appreciate the\nKantian arguments about expressing one\u2019s autonomy and the\nincompatibility of the categorical imperative and rational egoism. As\nSchneewind allows, Sidgwick\u2019s\n\n\nbasic aim is similar to Kant\u2019s, but, as his many points of\ndisagreement with Kant suggest, the Kantian aspect of his thinking\nneeds to be defined with some care. He detaches the issue of how\nreason can be practical from the most distinctive aspects of\nKantianism. He rejects the methodological apparatus of the\n\u201ccritical philosophy\u201d, the Kantian distinction of noumenal\nand phenomenal standpoints, and the association of the issue with the\nproblem of free will. He treats the question of the possibility of\nrationally motivated action as answerable largely in terms of\ncommonplace facts; he does not attribute any special synthesizing\npowers to reason beyond those assumed in ordinary logic; and he does\nnot take morality to provide us with support for religious beliefs..\nIn refusing to base morality on pure reason alone, moreover, he moves\ndecisively away from Kant, as is shown by his very un-Kantian\nhedonistic and teleological conclusions.. These points make it clear\nthat the Kantian strain in Sidgwick\u2019s thought is most marked in\nhis central idea about the rationality of first principles.\n(Schneewind 1977: 419\u201320)\n\n\nNaturally, a Sidgwickian position on the venerable free will issue is\nbound to be controversial, and recent work on the Sidgwick/Kant\ncomparison has brought out just how divided commentators continue to\nbe on this matter (Crisp 2015; Skelton 2016; Paytas 2018, Paytas &\nHenning [eds] 2020; Phillips 2022). Moreover, there has also been\nsignificant controversy over just how internalist Sidgwick\u2019s\naccount of moral motivation actually was. On balance, he held that the\ndictates or imperatives of reason were \u201caccompanied by a certain\nimpulse to do the acts recognized as right\u201d, while admitting\nthat other impulses may conflict (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 34]). Brink\n(1988, 1992) has urged that some of Sidgwick\u2019s chief arguments\nmake better sense if he is construed, in externalist fashion, as\nallowing the possibility that one may have good reasons not to be\nmoral. But Sidgwick\u2019s moderate, qualified internalism seems\nplain and plausible enough to most commentators (Schultz 2004; de\nLazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Crisp 2015).\n\nThere has been perhaps even more controversy surrounding\nSidgwick\u2019s account of the \u201cgood\u201d. The\nMethods is at least fairly clear in arguing that the\ndifference between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d in part\nconcerns the way in which judgments of ultimate good do not\nnecessarily involve definite precepts to act or even the assumption\nthat the good in question is attainable or the best attainable good\nunder the circumstances. Rightness and goodness thus \u201crepresent\ndifferentiations of the demands of our own rationality as it applies\nto our sentient and our active powers\u201d (Schneewind 1977: 493).\nBut Sidgwick offers an intricate account of ultimate good that has\nstruck some as highly naturalistic. In A Theory of Justice,\nRawls famously explained that Sidgwick \n\n\ncharacterizes a person\u2019s future good on the whole as what he\nwould now desire and seek if the consequences of all the various\ncourses of conduct open to him were, at the present point of time,\naccurately foreseen by him and adequately realized in imagination. An\nindividual\u2019s good is the hypothetical composition of impulsive\nforces that results from deliberative reflection meeting certain\nconditions. (Rawls 1971 [1999: 366]) \n\n\nSome have followed the Rawlsian line in casting Sidgwick as a defender\nof a naturalistic \u201cfull-information\u201d account of the\n\u201cgood\u201d (for example, Sobel 1994; Rosati 1995), but the\nbalance of scholarly opinion has it that Sidgwick\u2019s account\nadumbrates an \u201cobjective\u201d view that allows that some\ndesires, however informed, may be rejected as irrational or\nunreasonable (see especially Phillips 2022: 74\u201376; Schneewind\n1977; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Parfit 1984, 2011a,b).\nCrisp (2007, 2015) and Shaver (1997) provide helpful reviews of the\ndebates; although the former offers perhaps the best possible defense\nof the interpretation of Sidgwick\u2019s view as a naturalistic\nfull-information account (with an experience requirement), it also\nadmits that the objective list reading is a more charitable one.\n\nSome commentators have made much of the difference between Sidgwick\nand Moore on the notion of ultimate good, urging that whereas Sidgwick\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of \u201cright\u201d, Moore\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of \u201cgood\u201d, while adding\na suspect ontological claim about \u201cgoodness\u201d involving a\nnon-natural property (Moore 1903; Shaver 2000). However, Hurka (2003)\nhas offered some forceful arguments against most such accounts:\n\n\nAfter defining the good as what we ought to desire, he [Sidgwick]\nadded that \u201csince irrational desires cannot always be dismissed\nat once by voluntary effort\u201d, the definition cannot use\n\u201cought\u201d in \u201cthe strictly ethical sense\u201d, but\nonly in \u201cthe wider sense in which it merely connotes an ideal or\nstandard\u201d. But this raises the question of what this\n\u201cwider sense\u201d is, and in particular whether it is at all\ndistinct from Moore\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d. If the claim that we\n\u201cought\u201d to have a desire is only the claim that the desire\nis \u201can ideal\u201d, how does it differ from the claim that the\ndesire is good? When \u201cought\u201d is stripped of its connection\nwith choice, its distinctive meaning seems to slip away. (Hurka 2003:\n603\u20134)\n\n\nMoreover, as Hurka has developed the point, the \n\n\ninitial reviewers of Principia did not see it as altering\nSidgwick\u2019s ontology but emphasized its continuity with Sidgwick,\nwhile Moore himself said little about his non-natural property and\neven tried to limit his metaphysical claims, saying that though\ngoodness is an object and therefore \u201cis somehow\u201d,\nit does not \u201cexist\u201d, and in particular does not exist in a\n\u201csupersensible reality\u201d. (Hurka 2014a: 90)\n\n\nAt any rate, for his part (and unlike Moore), Sidgwick goes on to\nargue that, despite the serious problems with the views of previous\nutilitarians (for example, the Millian account of the\n\u201chigher\u201d pleasures), the best going account of ultimate\ngoodness is a hedonistic one, and that this is an informative,\nnon-tautological claim, though also a more controversial one than many\nof the others that he defends. That was putting it mildly, and\ncommentators past and present have struggled to try to determine\nwhether Sidgwick regarded the hedonistic account of good as grounded\non another cognitive intuition, but one of a lower degree of certainty\nthan the others he endorses (Phillips 2022: 86\u201389). As Skelton\naptly observes, \n\n\nSidgwick is a hedonist: pain is the only non-instrumental evil;\npleasure is the only non-instrumental good. His argument for hedonism\nin ME [Methods of Ethics] Book III, chapter xiv is a mess. (Skelton\n2022)\n\n\nFor one thing, as Irwin and Richardson have cogently argued,\nSidgwick\u2019s hedonistic commitments, and his criticisms of such\nviews as T. H. Green\u2019s, often reflected the (problematic)\nconviction that practical reason simply must be fully clear and\ndeterminate in its conclusions (Irwin 1992: 288\u201390; Richardson\n1994). For Sidgwick, without some such metric as the hedonistic one,\nit was hopelessly unclear how to weigh one virtue against another. But\nwhether or not that is actually the case, he advanced other arguments\nas well, such as whether one can really recommend making people more\nvirtuous at the expense of their hedonistic happiness. What if the\nvirtuous life were conjoined to extreme pain, with no compensating\ngood to anyone? At many points, as Shaver observes, \n\n\nSidgwick works out what it is reasonable to desire, and so attaches\nmoral to natural properties, by the ordinary gamut of\nphilosopher\u2019s strategies\u2014appeals to logical coherence,\nplausibility, and judgment after reflection. (Shaver 1997: 270) \n\n\nBut many problems remain, since Sidgwick\u2019s arguments about the\nfundamental nature of pleasure and pain are far from perspicuous.\nAccording to Rawls, \n\n\nSidgwick denies that pleasure is a measurable quality of feeling\nindependent of its relation from volition. This is the view of some\nwriters, he says, but one he cannot accept. He defines pleasure\n\u201cas a feeling which, when experienced by intelligent beings, is\nat least apprehended as desirable or\u2014in cases of\ncomparison\u2014preferable\u201d. It would seem that the view he\nhere rejects is the one he relies upon later as the final criterion to\nintroduce coherence among ends. (Rawls 1971 [1999: 488]) \n\n\nAnd Sumner, in an important treatment related to what is called the\n\u201cheterogeneity\u201d of pleasures problem, has also urged that\nSidgwick and Mill, by contrast with Bentham,\n\n\nseemed to recognize that the mental states we call pleasures are a\nmixed bag as far as their phenomenal properties are concerned. On\ntheir view what pleasures have in common is not something internal to\nthem\u2014their peculiar feeling tone, or whatever\u2014but\nsomething about us\u2014the fact that we like them, enjoy them, value\nthem, find them satisfying, seek them, wish to prolong them, and so\non. (Sumner 1996: 86)\n\n\nAccepting the heterogeneity of pleasures objection to the feeling tone\naccount, along with a \u201cresonance constraint\u201d to the effect\nthat what is good for someone must somehow resonate with what they\ncare about, and the view that \u201cwhat is ultimately good is\npleasure, understood as desirable consciousness\u201d, de\nLazari-Radek and Singer urge that Sidgwick takes a position that is\n\u201cintermediate between internalism and externalism\u201d (de\nLazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 254). In their vigorous defense of\nSidgwickian hedonism against all rival accounts of ultimate good,\nincluding the desire satisfaction view that Singer had previously\nadopted, they explain that \n\n\nthe hedonist will not say that it is good for a person to be in a\nconscious state that she does not take to be desirable, and to this\nextent hedonism satisfies the resonance constraint and is internalist.\nOn the other hand, hedonism does insist that what is good or bad for\nyou is your states of consciousness, and nothing else, irrespective of\nwhether what you desire is to have certain states of consciousness.\n(de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 253) \n\n\nThus, satisfying a desire for posthumous fame, which if satisfied\nwould not resonate with any of conscious states one could possibly\nhave, would not be good for the person in question. Shaver (2016) has\nalso offered a subtle account and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s notion\nof pleasure as feeling apprehended, perhaps wrongly, as desirable qua\nfeeling, rather than as feeling manifesting a special tone of\npleasantness. However, as Skelton warns, with accounts like these, the\nwording is a very delicate matter: \n\n\nAt one point, Sidgwick says that if we accept his definition of\npleasure, it is a tautology that pleasure is good ... But this would\nfollow for him only if pleasure is defined as desirable feeling,\nsince, for Sidgwick, desirable means good. But this would not be true\nif, for him, pleasure is defined as feelings apprehended to be\ndesirable. It is not a tautology to say feelings apprehended to be\ndesirable are in fact desirable. (Skelton 2022: 9) \n\n\nAnd whether or how this apprehension is something only\n\u201cexperienced by intelligent beings\u201d also calls for\ncritical attention, since that stipulation would seem to implausibly\nnarrow the scope of sentience. \n\nBut in contrast to the above accounts, Crisp, who defends an\ninternalist, feeling tone account of pleasure, argues persuasively\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s writings did not express his better inclinations\non the subject \n\n\nSidgwick is at heart an internalist about pleasure who was mislead by\nthe heterogeneity argument into offering an externalist view which is\nopen to serious objections. (Crisp 2007: 134; 2015 70) \n\n\nFor Crisp, \n\n\nthe heterogeneity objection moves in an unjustified way from the\nobviously true claim that the kinds of experience that are enjoyed are\nvery various to the claim that the feeling of enjoyment is not some\nphenomenologically internal property common to all such experiences.\nOn the face of it, it might appear that there is such a property: We\ncan ask of any enjoyable experience whether it felt enjoyable, or\nwhether it was more or less enjoyable than some other experience, and\nit is quite plausible to suggest that answers to these questions do\nnot involve our attending to any attitude or other state external to\nthe enjoyment or lack of it in question. (Crisp 2015: 67) \n\n\nEnjoyment is a determinable, like color vision, with particular\nenjoyments being determinates, like seeing particular colors. Crisp\nconcludes that some such account of enjoyment, or pleasure, would have\nbetter served Sidgwick, as Sidgwick himself half realized.\n\nClearly, recent years have witnessed some remarkable rehabilitations\nof Sidgwick\u2019s ethical hedonism, particularly in the works of\nCrisp (2007, 2015), Feldman (2004, 2010), and de Lazari-Radek and\nSinger (2014, 2016). And clearly, the forms of hedonism being defended\nusually reconfigure or qualify the Sidgwickian approach in important\nways, in part out of necessity, because of the obscurity of\nSidgwick\u2019s position on the fundamental issues. These\nrehabilitations of Sidgwickian hedonism have also involved, for some,\na recognition of the importance of the hedonimetrics of F. Y.\nEdgeworth, the brilliant economist who was a slightly junior\ncontemporary of Sidgwick\u2019s and one of his most enthusiastic\nphilosophical disciples, though one whose work has until recently been\nlargely ignored in philosophical commentary on Sidgwick (Edgeworth\n1877, 1881 [2003]). Edgeworth\u2019s approach has been revived in\neconomics by such figures as Kahneman (2011), and the convergence of\neconomic and philosophical, and neurobiological, interests on this\npoint suggests that hedonism remains a live option in ethics, though\nin key respects Sidgwick\u2019s account, obscure as it is, remains\nsuperior to these more recent developments, which rely on a rather too\ncrude claim about pleasurable consciousness as a state that a subject\nwishes to prolong. Indeed, despite philosophical hedonism being a core\ncommitment of classical utilitarianism past and present, no account of\nit, whether Sidgwick\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s, is problem free\nand uncertainty abounds. For example, de Lazari-Radek and Singer,\nwhile initially impressed by the heterogenity objection, are now no\nlonger sure that it is decisive: \n\n\nAs Crisp notes, in our book we approve of this \u201cheterogeneity\nobjection\u201d, and cite the work of the neuroscientists Kent\nBerridge and Morten Kringelbach in support of the view that pleasure\nis not a sensation, but rather is a kind of \u201chedonic\ngloss\u201d that our hedonic brain systems paint on certain\nsensations. Crisp thinks that it is better to interpret Berridge and\nKringelbach as saying that pleasure is not merely a sensation, but\nallowing that the hedonic gloss may itself be a sensation, or a single\ntype of feeling. We are now willing to concede that Crisp may be right\non this If so, the heterogeneity objection can be met, to the extent\nthat we can say that the hedonic systems of the brain put the same\nkind of hedonic gloss on various different sensations. (Singer &\nde Lazari-Radek 2016: 205\u20136)\n\n\nBut as de Lazari-Radek and Singer admit, this might not prove to be\nmuch of a victory:\n\n\nThe question is, however, whether this does not simply transfer the\nproblem of saying what pleasure is to the problem of saying what the\nhedonic gloss is. How is it to be distinguished from other feelings?\nIf we answer this question by saying that it is just a particular kind\nof feeling, in the way that sweetness is a particular kind of taste,\nthen anyone who thinks that pleasure is intrinsically good needs to\nexplain why just this kind of feeling has intrinsic value. If some\npeople do not desire this kind of feeling, even qua feeling, then\nhedonistic theories of the good will fail to satisfy what, following\nPeter Railton, we have called \u201cthe resonance\nrequirement\u201d\u2014we will be telling such people that pleasure\nis good for them, but this will not resonate with anything they desire\nor value. Obviously, the same problem recurs if we describe the\nhedonic gloss in terms of certain brain states. If, on the other hand,\nwe say that the hedonic gloss is to be distinguished from other\nfeelings by the fact that we do desire it, qua feeling, we are back to\nwhere we started, with pleasure being whatever mental state we desire,\nqua mental state. These problems remain in need of more work. (Singer\n& de Lazari-Radek 2016: 206)\n\n\nWithout getting into the problematic conflation here of\n\u201cdesired\u201d and \u201cdesirable\u201d, or\n\u201capprehended as desirable\u201d, it should be plain enough that\nthe controversies Sidgwick sparked are ongoing. To make matters worse,\nNozick\u2019s venerable \u201cExperience Machine\u201d objection to\nhedonism\u2014to the effect that for hedonism a virtual, or Matrix\nlike programmed world is as good as the real one\u2014has received\nnew life with the growth of concerns over developments with AI and the\nmetaverse, which seem to exert a disturbing pressure on people,\nespecially young people, to assume that their good or well-being just\nis what goes on in their heads, however undesirable that may be\n(Mulgan 2020: 26\u201328).\n\n2.2 Reconstruction and Reconciliation\n\nFor better or worse, Sidgwick uses the language of hedonism to label\ntwo out of the three methods with which he will be chiefly\nconcerned\u2014namely, egoistic hedonism (or rational egoism) and\nuniversal hedonism (or utilitarianism). The third method is variously\ncalled dogmatic or intuitional morality, which is somewhat ambiguously\nconstrued as either the (mostly negative) precepts of common-sense\nmorality or the somewhat more refined version of these set out in the\ntheories of such moral theorists as Whewell, T. R. Birks, or Henry\nCalderwood (Whewell 1864; Birks 1874; Calderwood 1876; Donagan 1977,\n1992). The main point of such views is that conformity to such moral\nduties as truth-telling, promise-keeping, temperance etc. is held to\nbe \u201cthe practically ultimate end of moral actions\u201d and\nthese duties are \u201cunconditionally prescribed\u201d and\ndiscernible with \u201creally clear and finally valid\nintuition\u201d, though it is the job of the moral theorist to set\nthem out with proper precision and \u201cto arrange the results as\nsystematically as possible, and by proper definitions and explanations\nto remove vagueness and prevent conflict\u201d. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n101]). Indeed, the plain person is apt to be rather confused about the\ndifferences between the methods of ethics, arbitrarily deploying one\nor another without recognizing any inconsistency.\n\nThe three methods of ethics\u2014egoism, intuitional morality, and\nutilitarianism\u2014respectively form the subject matter of books two\nthrough four of the Methods, which brackets them with an\nopening book reviewing the whole work and a concluding chapter on\n\u201cThe Mutual Relations of the Three Methods\u201d. Each of these\nbooks represents in itself a classic treatment of the view at issue,\nthough it is the chapter on utilitarianism that has perhaps most often\nbeen treated as such. This architectonic can, however, make it\nsomewhat difficult to follow the thread of Sidgwick\u2019s thought,\nparticularly on the more philosophical points having to do with\nintuitionism. Indeed, intuitionism figures in both the second method\nof ethics, and, in a more philosophical form, in the treatment of all\nthe methods of ethics, particularly when it comes to the discussion of\nfundamental principles. As Sidgwick explains, although some might\nthink that conscience delivers immediate judgments on particular\nacts\u2014a view he variously calls aesthetic, perceptional or ultra\nintuitionism\u2014\u201creflective persons, in proportion to their\nreflectiveness, come to rely rather on abstract universal intuitions\nrelating to classes of cases conceived under general notions\u201d.\nHence, dogmatic intuitional morality, which in the Methods is\nrather awkwardly taken to cover both more deontological views and\nnon-hedonistic teleological ones, on the ground that the latter tend\nto construe virtue in the same fashion as the simply the done thing,\nwhatever the consequences. But the process of reflection should not\nstop there: there is another, more sophisticated phase of\nintuitionism. Without \n\n\nbeing disposed to deny that conduct commonly judged to be right is so,\nwe may yet require some deeper explanation why it is so. \n\n\nThus, philosophical intuitionism, \n\n\nwhile accepting the morality of common sense as in the main sound,\nstill attempts to find for it a philosophic basis which it does not\nitself offer: to get one or more principles more absolutely and\nundeniably true and evident, from which the current rules might be\ndeduced, either just as they are commonly received or with slight\nmodifications and rectifications. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 102])\n\n\nThe ascent to this philosophical intuitionism is especially evident in\nthe treatment of common-sense or intuitional morality. As Sidgwick\nexplained in reply to Calderwood\u2019s critical review of the\nMethods, which asked why he had not simply confined himself\n\u201cto the consideration of Intuitionism in its most philosophical\nform\u201d, that tactic \n\n\nwould have led me at once to Utilitarianism: because I hold that the\nonly moral intuitions which sound philosophy can accept as ultimately\nvalid are those which at the same time provide the only possible\nphilosophical basis of the Utilitarian creed. I thus necessarily\nregard Prof. Calderwood\u2019s Intuitionism as a phase in the\ndevelopment of the Intuitional method, which comes naturally between\nthe crude thought of Butler\u2019s \u201cplain man\u201d and the\nRational Utilitarianism to which I ultimately endeavor to lead my\nreader. \n\n\nThat is, allowing that the morality of common sense is his as well, he\nmust as a philosopher nonetheless\n\n\nask myself whether I see clearly and distinctly the self-evidence of\nany particular maxims of duty, as I see that of the formal principles\n\u201cthat what is right for me must be right for all persons in\nprecisely similar circumstances\u201d and \u201cthat I ought to\nprefer the greater good of another to my own lesser good\u201d: I\nhave no doubt whatever that I do not. I am conscious of a strong\nimpression, an opinion on which I habitually act without hesitation,\nthat I ought to speak truth, to perform promises, to requite benefits,\n& c., and also of powerful moral sentiments prompting me to the\nobservance of these rules; but on reflection I can now clearly\ndistinguish such opinions and sentiments from the apparently immediate\nand certain cognition that I have of the formal principles above\nmentioned. But I could not always have made this distinction; and I\nbelieve that the majority of moral persons do not make it: most\n\u201cplain men\u201d would probably say, at any rate on the first\nconsideration of the matter, that they saw the obligations of Veracity\nand Good Faith as clearly and immediately as they saw those of Equity\nand Rational Benevolence. How then am I to argue with such persons? It\nwill not settle the matter to tell them that they have observed their\nown mental processes wrongly, and that more careful introspection will\nshow them the non-intuitive character of what they took for\nintuitions; especially as in many cases I do not believe that the\nerror is one of misobservation. Still less am I inclined to dispute\nthe \u201cprimitiveness\u201d or \u201cspontaneousness\u201d or\n\u201coriginality\u201d of these apparent intuitions. On the\ncontrary, I hold that here, as in other departments of thought, the\nprimitive spontaneous processes of the mind are mixed with error,\nwhich is only to be removed gradually by comprehensive reflection upon\nthe results of these processes. Through such a course of reflection I\nhave endeavored to lead my readers in chaps. 2\u201310 of Book III of\nmy treatise: in the hope that after they have gone through it they may\nfind their original apprehension of the self-evidence of moral maxims\nimportantly modified. (Sidgwick 1876: 564)\n\n\nAnd as he explained in another important commentary on the\nMethods, \u201cThe Establishment of Ethical First\nPrinciples\u201d, he accepts Aristotle\u2019s distinction between\nlogical priority and priority in the knowledge of a particular person,\nsuch that we \n\n\nare thus enabled to see that a proposition may be self-evident, i.e.,\nmay be properly cognisable without being viewed in connexion with any\nother propositions; though in order that its truth may be apparent to\nsome particular mind, there is still required some rational process\nconnecting it with propositions previously accepted by that mind. \n\n\nThis latter can be done in two ways: by showing how \u201csome\nlimited and qualified statement\u201d supposed to be self-evident is\nonly part of a \u201csimpler and wider proposition\u201d, on which\nthe limitations turn out to be arbitrary, and by establishing some\ngeneral criteria \u201cfor distinguishing true first\nprinciples\u201d that are then used to \n\n\nconstruct a strictly logical deduction by which, applying their\ngeneral criteria to the special case of ethics, we establish the true\nfirst principles of this latter subject. (Sidgwick 1879: 106\u20137)\n\n\n\nTruth being one, both tactics should ultimately converge on the same\nconclusions.\n\nWhether Sidgwick succeeded in avoiding mere \u201chostile criticism\nfrom the outside\u201d in his analysis of common-sense morality is\nopen to debate; certainly, the critical reflection can seem quite\nremorseless, with the utilitarian repeatedly demonstrating to the\ndogmatic intuitionist\n\n\nthat the principles of Truth, Justice, etc. have only a dependent and\nsubordinate validity: arguing either that the principle is really only\naffirmed by Common-Sense as a general rule admitting of exceptions and\nqualifications, as in the case of Truth, and that we require some\nfurther principle for systematising these exceptions and\nqualifications; or that the fundamental notion is vague and needs\nfurther determination, as in the case of Justice; and further, that\nthe different rules are liable to conflict with each other, and that\nwe require some higher principle to decide the issue thus raised; and\nagain, that the rules are differently formulated by different persons,\nand that these differences admit of no Intuitional solution, while\nthey show the vagueness and ambiguity of the common moral notions to\nwhich the Intuitionist appeals. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 421])\n\n\nTime and again, common sense collapses into utilitarian thinking, or\nis shown to presuppose it, or is at least revealed as requiring\nsomething very like it. This effort to criticize and assimilate\ncommon-sense moral rules went far beyond the efforts of J. S. Mill and\nhas served as a template for the utilitarian or consequentialist work\nof Smart (1973), Brandt (1979), Hare (1981), Parfit (1984,\n2011\u20132017), Hardin (1988), Gibbard (1982, 1990), de Lazari-Radek\nand Singer (2014, 2016, 2021), and Woodard (2019). Like so many in the\nutilitarian tradition, Sidgwick ended up recognizing the moral\nstanding of non-human animals, puzzling over questions of suicide,\ndefending a notion of intention covering all foreseen consequences,\nrejecting purely retributive accounts of punishment, embracing a\ncosmopolitan (rather than nationalistic) outlook, and\nthinking\u2014though not public insisting\u2014that orthodox\nreligion and its morality were often dogmatic and superstitious. More\noriginally, he initiated the (modern) philosophical discussion of the\nproblem of future generations and optimal population growth, arguing\nthat \n\n\nstrictly conceived, the point up to which, on Utilitarian principles,\npopulation ought to be encouraged to increase, is not that at which\naverage happiness is the greatest possible \u2026 but that at which\nthe product formed by multiplying the number of persons living into\nthe amount of average happiness reaches its maximum. (Sidgwick 1874\n[1907: 415\u201316]) \n\n\nSidgwick was not always consistent in his treatment of this issue of\naverage versus total utility, but even so, had he done nothing more\nthan formulate this issue, his philosophical fame would have been\nsecured. The flourishing fields of population ethics and justice for\nfuture generations, which received an enormous boost from Parfit,\nespecially his Reasons and Persons (1984), reflect the\nseminal Sidgwickian influence at many, many points, though as with\nhedonism, the controversies have often deepened rather than dissipated\n(McMahan, Campbell, Goodrich, & Ramakrishnan [eds] 2022).\n\nSidgwick made other original contributions as well. Although it can\nseem strained and anachronistic to apply the classification of\n\u201cact\u201d or \u201crule\u201d utilitarianism to him, the\nscholarly consensus does for the most part classify him as an act\nutilitarian (Gray 1984; Williams 1995; Hooker 2000a,b; de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014, 2021; Crisp 2015). But he does not fit the stock\nstereotype of that position. Among other things, it is quite clear\nthat he defended a very \u201cindirect\u201d form of utilitarianism,\ngoing so far as to defend the possibility of utilitarianism entailing\na self-effacing, even esoteric morality:\n\n\nThus, on Utilitarian principles, it may be right to do and privately\nrecommend, under certain circumstances, what it would not be right to\nadvocate openly; it may be right to teach openly to one set of persons\nwhat it would be wrong to teach to others; it may be conceivably right\nto do, if it can be done with comparative secrecy, what it would be\nwrong to do in the face of the world; and even, if perfect secrecy can\nbe reasonably expected, what it would be wrong to recommend by private\nadvice or example. These conclusions are all of a paradoxical\ncharacter: there is no doubt that the moral consciousness of a plain\nman broadly repudiates the general notion of an esoteric morality,\ndiffering from the one popularly taught; and it would be commonly\nagreed that an action which would be bad if done openly is not\nrendered good by secrecy. We may observe, however, that there are\nstrong utilitarian reasons for maintaining generally this latter\ncommon opinion\u2026. Thus the Utilitarian conclusion, carefully\nstated, would seem to be this; that the opinion that secrecy may\nrender an action right which would not otherwise be so should itself\nbe kept comparatively secret; and similarly it seems expedient that\nthe doctrine that esoteric morality is expedient should itself be kept\nesoteric. \u2026 a Utilitarian may reasonably desire, on Utilitarian\nprinciples, that some of his conclusions should be rejected by mankind\ngenerally; or even that the vulgar should keep aloof from his system\nas a whole, in so far as the inevitable indefiniteness and complexity\nof its calculations render it likely to lead to bad results in their\nhands. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 489\u201390])\n\n\nSuch provocative remarks, which flatly contradict any Kantian\ninsistence on the necessary publicity of fundamental moral principles,\nmay reflect a consistent interpretation of the different\n\u201clevels\u201d of moral thinking, critical versus everyday, but\nthey have generated much criticism, with Williams insinuating that\nSidgwick was a \u201cGovernment House\u201d utilitarian whose views\ncomported well with colonialism (Williams 1995). Yet even on the count\nof esoteric morality, Sidgwick\u2019s views have attracted some\nforceful recent defenders (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2010, 2014,\n2016) who strike at the very heart of the Kantian and neo-Kantian\npublicity requirement. Their argument owes much to Parfit\u2019s\ndemonstration that an ethical theory could be self-effacing without\nbeing self-defeating, incoherent or untrue (Parfit 1984).\n\nAs noted, however, for all his originality, Sidgwick has often been\ncharged with slanting his discussion against a wide range of\nalternatives (Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin 1992, 2007, 2011; Hurka\n2014b). And at times it is very far from clear whose views he is\ncriticizing. Thus, his account of \u201caesthetic intuitionism\u201d\nwould seem to be trained on a certain form of Aristotelianism\nstressing the contextual and particularist nature of practical wisdom\n(McDowell 1979; Irwin 1992), but, in a curiously neglected work on the\nhistory of ethics that was in some ways a successor to\nSidgwick\u2019s own Outlines (and contained an extended\ntreatment of Sidgwick\u2019s views), Reginald A. P. Rogers identified\naesthetic intuitionism with the moral sense theory of Shaftesbury\n(Rogers 1911). Furthermore, of special concern to recent intuitionists\nhas been the effort to combine Sidgwick\u2019s views with those of\nRoss on prima facie intuitions, acknowledging that\nSidgwick\u2019s account of intuitional morality did not address such\nan option (Hurka 2014a, 2014b; Crisp 2015). Hurka has developed this\ncritique forcefully, expanding on his claim that Sidgwick\u2019s\nframing of ethical theory was slanted from the start: Sidgwick\n\n\ntook it to be a serious objection to a pluralist deontology that it\ncannot always judge acts determinately because it cannot weigh duties\nprecisely, but no objection to hedonistic theories that they cannot\ncompare pleasures precisely. He tested deotontological principles\nrigorously with his four conditions but barely applied those\nconditions to his own principles. And though one of his main\nobjections to deontological principles turned on the difference\nbetween their other-things-equal and all-things-considered forms, his\ndefence of his axioms equivocated on the same point and involved the\nsame ambiguity. In arguing against deontology and for consequentialism\nhe applied, and not just once, a double standard. (Hurka 2014b:\n151\u20132)\n\n\nFor others, however, it is clear enough that Sidgwick\u2019s\nhedonistic utilitarianism does not require any Rossian apparatus for\nrecognizing apparent conflicts of duties. De Lazari-Radek and Singer,\nin response to Crisp\u2019s defense of Rossian prima facie\nintuitions, argue that \n\n\nRoss starts by assuming that, as he puts it, \u201cthe main moral\nconvictions of the plain man\u201d are \u201cnot opinions which it\nis for philosophy to prove or disprove, but knowledge from the\nstart\u201d. As we have already indicated both in our book and in\nthis response, we are skeptical about the validity of most of our\nmoral intuitions. (Singer & de Lazari-Radek 2016) \n\n\nAs Crisp allows, Sidgwick would probably not have deemed the Rossian\ngambit to the point for purposes of dealing with the problems that\nmost troubled him.\n\nMore generally, it must be said that Sidgwick, under the influence of\nHegel and other historically-minded philosophers, did not claim that\nhe was impartially addressing all historically important methods of\nethics, but only those that in his estimate had become the live\noptions as humanity had progressed (Schultz 2013; Phillips 2022). He\nmay have been somewhat misguided in identifying those, but that is not\nthe same as being blind to the content of the alternatives.\n\nAt any rate, fair or not, Sidgwick\u2019s reconciliation of\nintuitional morality and utilitarianism obviously deploys a\nsophisticated form of intuitionist epistemology, one allowing for the\nfallibilism of its conclusions. He formulates four criteria or\nconditions \n\n\nthe complete fulfillment of which would establish a significant\nproposition, apparently self-evident, in the highest degree of\ncertainty attainable: and which must be approximately realised by the\npremises of our reasoning in any inquiry, if that reasoning is to lead\nus cogently to trustworthy conclusions. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 338])\n\n\n\nThe first, often called simply the \u201cCartesian Criterion\u201d,\ndemands that the \u201cterms of the proposition must be clear and\nprecise\u201d, and the second requires that the \u201cself-evidence\nof the proposition must be ascertained by careful reflection\u201d,\nwhich is especially important in ethics because \n\n\nany strong sentiment, however purely subjective, is apt to transform\nitself into the semblance of an intuition; and it requires careful\ncontemplation to detect the illusion. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 339]) \n\n\nThird, the \u201cpropositions accepted as self-evident must be\nmutually consistent\u201d, since it \u201cis obvious that any\ncollision between two intuitions is a proof that there is error in one\nor the other, or in both\u201d. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 341]). And\nfourth, since \n\n\nit is implied in the very notion of Truth that it is essentially the\nsame for all minds, the denial by another of a proposition that I have\naffirmed has a tendency to impair my confidence in its validity. \n\n\nThis last adds an important social dimension to Sidgwick\u2019s\nepistemology: \n\n\nthe absence of such disagreement must remain an indispensable negative\ncondition of the certainty of our beliefs, \n\n\nfor \n\n\nif I find any of my judgements, intuitive or inferential, in direct\nconflict with a judgment of some other minds, there must be error\nsomewhere: and if I have no more reason to suspect error in the other\nmind than in my own, reflective comparison between the two judgments\nnecessarily reduces me temporarily to a state of neutrality. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 341\u201342]) \n\n\nIn other, more purely epistemological works, Sidgwick collapsed the\nfirst two conditions into one, such that his philosophical\nintuitionism involved the three-pronged demand for clarity and ability\nto withstand critical reflection, consistency or coherence, and\nconsensus of experts. He was also apt to explain that these conditions\nonly afforded the best means for reducing the risk of error, rather\nthan establishing indubitable truth. On this count, such posthumous\nworks as Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant (1905) and\nPhilosophy, Its Scope and Relations (1902) provide important\nsupplements to the Methods. Marcus G. Singer (2000) provides\nan excellent edited collection of those of Sidgwick\u2019s essays and\nreviews most relevant to the Methods. Unfortunately, much\notherwise excellent work on Sidgwick\u2019s intuitionism has been\ncompromised by a failure to recognize the significance of these other\nworks.\n3. Epistemology and Chaos\n\nPerhaps no region of Sidgwick\u2019s work has been the subject of\ngreater interpretive controversy than his epistemology. The early work\nof Schneewind (1963), Rawls (1971, and Schultz ([ed.] 1992) played up\nthe dialectical side of Sidgwick\u2019s approach and the ways in\nwhich he anticipated the Rawlsian account of the method of reflective\nequilibrium. Reactions to any such interpretation, which supposedly\naccorded a too generous role to \u201creceived opinion\u201d in\nSidgwick\u2019s methodology, came from Peter Singer (1974) and many\nothers influenced by Hare\u2019s critique of Rawls (see also Sverdlik\n1985, and especially, Skelton 2007, 2008, 2010a,b). Rawls himself\nshifted his ground somewhat in later work, playing up Sidgwick\u2019s\n\u201crational intuitionism\u201d (Rawls 1993, 2007). But other\naccounts, notably Brink (1994), Shaver (1999, 2011, 2014) and Phillips\n(2022), have recognized that Sidgwick\u2019s approach contains both\ndialectical and more purely intuitionist elements, debating whether\nthese can be combined in a consistent or coherent way. Recent work on\nSidgwick has also benefited from the renaissance in and rehabilitation\nof intuitionism, evident in such works as Audi (1997), Parfit\n(2011\u20132017), and Stratton-Lake ([ed.] 2002); the latter contains\nan important contribution by Crisp that effectively distances\nSidgwick\u2019s views from cruder versions of intuitionism, though\nDeigh (2010) has argued forcefully that Sidgwick was too committed to\nan axiomatic approach that was undermined by developments in\nanalytical philosophy, a point in some ways reminiscent of\nDonagan\u2019s (1977) critique of Sidgwick\u2019s intuitionism.\nSchultz (2013, 2014a) surveys the development of some of these\ndebates, and emphasizes the role of consensus in Sidgwick\u2019s\nepistemology, a factor also figuring in the Sidgwickian methodology\ndeveloped by Parfit (2011\u20132017). But this is a very lively area\nof research in which the history of English moral philosophy from\nWhewell to Ross is still being actively rewritten in dramatic fashion\n(Hurka [ed.] 2011; 2014a). Yet it does appear that in the last decade,\nthe scholarly emphasis has been disproportionately on Sidgwick and his\nsuccessors, notably Ross, rather than Sidgwick and his predecessors,\nnotably Whewell, who remains a comparatively neglected figure (Snyder\n2001 [2019], 2006).\n\nSidgwick\u2019s epistemology is linked to other significant\ncontroversies as well, such as those concerning the degree to which he\ncan really be classified as a utilitarian, in any unqualified fashion.\nFor Sidgwick argues, over the course of the Methods, that\ncommon-sense or intuitional morality keeps giving way to more abstract\nformal principles as the better candidates for genuinely self-evident\ntruths. Although there is some controversy over just how many such\nprinciples he advances, at the least he defends a universalizability\nprinciple (one must be able to will one\u2019s maxim to be a\nuniversal law) and a principle of rational prudence (or temporal\nneutrality, such that one should be ceteris paribus equally\nconcerned with all parts of one\u2019s life), in addition to the\nutilitarian principle of rational benevolence. Controversially, he\nholds that the universalizability principle is merely formal and lacks\ncontent, being consistent with both egoism and utilitarianism, and\nthat temporal neutrality translates into a form of prudence. And in\nfact, even utilitarianism is actually derived from two more\nfundamental principles, and involves the \u201crelation of the\nintegrant parts to the whole and to each other\u201d in order to\nobtain \n\n\nthe self-evident principle that the good of any one individual is of\nno more importance, from the point of view (if I may say so) of the\nUniverse, than the good of any other; unless, that is, there are\nspecial grounds for believing the more good is likely to be realised\nin the one case than in the other. And it is evident to me that as a\nrational being I am bound to aim at good generally,\u2014so far as it\nis attainable by my efforts,\u2014not at a particular part of it.\n\n\n\nAnd from \n\n\nthese two rational intuitions we may deduce, as a necessary inference,\nthe maxim of Benevolence in an abstract form: viz. that each one is\nmorally bound to regard the good of any other individual as much as\nhis own, except in so far as he judges it to be less, when impartially\nviewed, or less certainly knowable or attainable by him. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 382]) \n\n\nThus, in his more careful statements of the candidates for\nself-evident truths, Sidgwick refrains from formulations directly\ninvoking \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d\nor hedonistic considerations. Some of the most sophisticated\ncommentary on the Methods, such as Schneewind (1977), Shaver\n(1999, 2014), Nakano-Okuno (2011), Parfit (2011\u20132017), Phillips\n(2011, 2022), de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2014, 2016), Hurka (2014a),\nand Crisp (2015), has highlighted the gap between these\n\u201caxioms\u201d and the substantive ethical theories derived or\ndeveloped from them. Sidgwick himself appreciated the irony of his\nposition, the way in which the hard-headed, reformist utilitarian\nemphasis on clarity and conclusiveness had dissipated in his work:\nthere are indeed \n\n\ncertain absolute practical principles, the truth of which, when they\nare explicitly stated, is manifest; but they are of too abstract a\nnature, and too universal in their scope, to enable us to ascertain by\nimmediate application of them what we ought to do in any particular\ncase; particular duties have still to be determined by some other\nmethod. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 379]) \n\n\nCommon-sense rules have their place, but are not even clear enough to\nserve as the \u201cmiddle axioms\u201d of the utilitarian theory. As\nhe put it to Dakyns: \n\n\nEthics is losing its interest for me rather, as the insolubility of\nits fundamental problem is impressed on me. I think the contribution\nto the formal clearness & coherence of our ethical\nthought which I have to offer is just worth giving: for a few\nspeculatively-minded persons\u2014very few. And as for all practical\nquestions of interest, I feel as if I had now to begin at the\nbeginning and learn the ABC. (Memoir: 277)\n\n\nWorse still, all was not happy even in the ethereal region of the\naxioms. The \u201cinsolubility\u201d of the \u201cfundamental\nproblem\u201d of ethics\u2014the key problem that had troubled\nSidgwick in the 1860s\u2014was indeed on display in Sidgwick\u2019s\ntreatise, in that he did not find the unified account of practical\nreason that he sought even at the more abstract level. As he had put\nit in an earlier letter to his friend Dakyns: \n\n\nYou know I want intuitions for Morality; at least one (of Love) is\nrequired to supplement the utilitarian morality, and I do not see why,\nif we are to have one, we may not have others. I have worked away\nvigorously at the selfish morality, but I cannot persuade myself,\nexcept by trusting intuition, that Christian self-sacrifice is really\na happier life than classical insouciance. (Memoir: 90) \n\n\nThe problem of self-sacrifice and the claims of rational egoism were\nnot, on Sidgwick\u2019s view, amenable to the same form of\nreconciliation with utilitarianism that intuitional morality was. In\nfact, the first edition of the Methods concludes that\nrational egoism and utilitarianism end up in a stand-off, that there\nis a \u201cdualism of the practical reason\u201d, and that as a\nresult, there is a \u201cfundamental contradiction in our apparent\nintuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct\u201d such that \n\n\nthe \u201cCosmos\u201d of Duty is thus really reduced to a Chaos,\nand the prolonged effort of the human intellect to frame a perfect\nideal of rational conduct is seen to have been foredoomed to\ninevitable failure. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 473]) \n\n\nLater editions of the work sounded a somewhat less bleak concluding\nnote, but did not differ in substance. The main possible solutions to\nthe problem that Sidgwick considered are two, a weakening of\nepistemological standards, or a Theistic postulate about the coherent\nmoral government of the universe. On the first, he suggests that if\n\n\n\nwe find that in our supposed knowledge of the world of nature\npropositions are commonly taken to be universally true, which seem to\nrest on no other ground than that we have a strong disposition to\naccept them, and that they are indispensable to the systematic\ncoherence of our beliefs,\u2014it will be more difficult to reject a\nsimilarly supported assumption in ethics, without opening the door to\nuniversal scepticism. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 509]) \n\n\nOn the second, he explains that if \n\n\nwe may assume the existence of such a Being, as God, by the\nconsensus of theologians, is conceived to be, it seems that\nUtilitarians may legitimately infer the existence of Divine sanctions\nto the code of social duty as constructed on a Utilitarian basis; and\nsuch sanctions would, of course, suffice to make it always every\none\u2019s interest to promote universal happiness to the best of his\nknowledge. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 506])\n\n\nSidgwick often departed from the pristine language of the axioms when\ndescribing this conflict. In another important essay on his own work,\nhe explained that along with \n\n\n(a) a fundamental moral conviction that I ought to sacrifice my own\nhappiness, if by so doing I can increase the happiness of others to a\ngreater extent than I diminish my own, I find also (b) a\nconviction\u2014which it would be paradoxical to call\n\u201cmoral\u201d, but which is none the less fundamental\u2014that\nit would be irrational to sacrifice any portion of my own happiness\nunless the sacrifice is to be somehow at some time compensated by an\nequivalent addition to my own happiness. (Sidgwick 1889: 483) \n\n\nHe urges that each of these convictions has as much clarity and\ncertainty \u201cas the process of introspective can give\u201d and\neach also finds wide assent \u201cin the common sense of\nmankind\u201d. Moreover, his account of rational egoism does not rely\non a narrow or low-minded account of self-interest. Besides\n\n\nadmitting the actual importance of sympathetic pleasures to the\nmajority of mankind, I should go further and maintain that, on\nempirical grounds alone, enlightened self-interest would direct most\nmen to foster and develop their sympathetic susceptibilities to a\ngreater extent than is now commonly attained. The effectiveness of\nButler\u2019s famous argument against the vulgar antithesis between\nSelf-love and Benevolence is undeniable: and it seems scarcely\nextravagant to say that, amid all the profuse waste of the means of\nhappiness which men commit, there is no imprudence more flagrant than\nthat of Selfishness in the ordinary sense of the term,\u2014the\nexcessive concentration of attention on the individual\u2019s own\nhappiness which renders it impossible for him to feel any strong\ninterest in the pleasures and pains of others. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n501])\n\n\nStill, he found it impossible to deny that even very high-minded\nversions of egoism posed a problem, prescribing actions conflicting\nwith the general good in such cases as heroic sacrifice of self in\nbattle, etc. This view, he suggested, could be found in Butler\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cReasonable Self-love and Conscience are the two\nchief or superior principles in the nature of man\u201d, each\ngenerating an obligation, though Frankena (1992), Darwall (2000) and\nCrisp (2019) have raised questions about the historical accuracy of\nthis attribution. But in any event, the basic point is that if \n\n\nthe Egoist strictly confines himself to stating his conviction that he\nought to take his own happiness or pleasure as his ultimate end, there\nseems no opening for an argument to lead him to Utilitarianism (as a\nfirst principle). But if he offers either as a reason for this\nconviction, or as another form of stating it, the proposition that his\nhappiness or pleasure is objectively \u201cdesirable\u201d or\n\u201ca good\u201d, he gives the requisite opening. For the\nUtilitarian can then point out that his happiness cannot be\nmore objectively desirable or more a good than the happiness of any\none else; the mere fact \u2026 that he is he can have\nnothing to do with its objective desirability or goodness. (Sidgwick\n1873: 259\u201360) \n\n\nBut the egoist need not make that move\u2014it is just as rational\nsimply to take one\u2019s own point of view as it is to take the\npoint of view of the universe\u2014of the utilitarian\nsuperperson.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s dualism has a long history of stimulating\ncontroversy, even leading some commentators to urge that he is better\ntermed a \u201cdualist\u201d or \u201cdual-source theorist\u201d\nthan a utilitarian (Crisp 2002, 2014, 2015). Moore (1903) famously\ndismissed the problem on the grounds that the notion of one\u2019s\n\u201cown good\u201d was nonsense, but Mackie (1976) sharply\ncountered that Moore was begging the question. Broad (1930) claimed\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s account was confused, since his proposed\nsolutions did not touch the problem of the inconsistent fundamental\nprinciples, though this has been effectively addressed by Coady\n(1994), Schneewind (1977) and many others. Brink (1988) has argued\nthat it is absurd to claim that two self-evident principles are\ninconsistent, but Shaver (1999) has replied that Sidgwick is for the\nmost part consistent in calling the principles at issue only\n\u201capparently\u201d self-evident, though Shaver also suggests\nthat Sidgwick did not present a compelling case for the egoistic side\nof the conflict. Skorupski (2000) has forcefully argued that there is\nno dualism of the \u201cpure\u201d practical reason, which is agent\nneutral, but there are many such conflicts in the larger field of less\nthan pure practical reason, not merely a conflict with egoistic\nreasons. Parfit, too, argued that Sidgwick\u2019s two standpoints\napproach failed to capture how egoistic reasons can be weaker than\nomnipersonal ones (Parfit 2011a,b), though Smith (2009) has defended\nSidgwick\u2019s construction of the problem. And Baier (1995) argued\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s account suffers from various ambiguities because\nhe does not clearly distinguish \u201crequiring\u201d reasons from\n\u201cpermissive\u201d ones, which would avoid the contradiction.\nIndeed, more generally, it is telling that many of Sidgwick\u2019s\nmost notable admirers, such as Larmore (1996) and Parfit\n(2011\u20132017), do not carry all the baggage of his epistemological\nintuitionism but prefer instead to translate his arguments into the\nidiom of objective normative \u201creasons\u201d. Indeed, Parfit\ncalled his deeply Sidgwickian view a form of non-naturalistic,\nnon-metaphysical moral rationalism. And in his major works on the\nMethods, Phillips (2011, 2022) reconstructs Sidgwick\u2019s\narguments in a similar, Parfitian way, while retaining more of\nSidgwick\u2019s terminology. He also, in Phillips (2022:\n210\u201331), provides an excellent overview of the various positions\non the Sidgwickian dualism. Thus, in one vocabulary or another, these\ncontroversies are likely to continue as long as there is such a thing\nas ethical philosophy.\n\nThe issue is worth illustrating in more detail, given the importance\nof recent work in this area. Thus, unlike Sidgwick, but like Crisp\n(2006b, 2015) and Phillips (2011, 2022), Parfit did not regard\npractical reason as teetering on chaos or think it a cosmic calamity\nif we could not demonstrate that we always have most objective reason\nto do what would be impartially best, or that impartial and egoistic\nreasons can be harmonized, though he did think it would be a cosmic\ncalamity if there were no objective normative reasons (Edmonds 2023).\nWhen it came to Sidgwick\u2019s dualism, he was content to sort out\nthe complex of objective reasons that we might have, without going so\nfar as to worry about the absurdity of a universe in which Own Good\nand Other Good might be left in conflict, and he even pronounced\nSidgwick\u2019s \u201csomber claims\u201d on this score\n\u201coverstatements\u201d, and the result of an unhelpful\n\u201ctwo standpoints\u201d framework of self and other that misses\nhow we can compare the strength of different reasons. Parfit urged\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s more plausible, revised claim is simply: \n\n\nWhen one of our two possible acts would make things go in some way\nthat would be impartially better, but the other act would make things\ngo better either for ourselves or for those to whom we have close\nties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of these two\nways. (Parfit 2011a: 137) \n\n\nThus, Sidgwick drew the conflict too narrowly, between impartial and\negoistic reasons; he failed to consider the full range of less than\nfully impartial reasons and how they may or may not be comparatively\nstronger than impartial ones. He also failed to consider the relevance\nof a Reductionist view of personal identity in undermining egoism.\nIndeed, Parfit went even further in elaborating the complex of\nobjective reasons, allowing not only that we might have personal and\npartial, but not self-interested reasons that could outweigh impartial\nreasons, but also that, if we are not act consequentialists, we might\nfind conflicts between impartial reasons and moral reasons, such as\ndeontological ones (Parfit 2017). As Crisp (2006b, 2015) has argued,\nand as Parfit clearly admitted, Sidgwick himself took a less elaborate\nview. But for all his revisionism, Parfit did reflect Sidgwick\u2019s\nviews at a great many points, not least in taking very seriously the\nconsensus of experts criterion, which pushed him to develop his\n\u201cTriple Theory\u201d, a consequentializing convergence of rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian universalizability, and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Although the Triple Theory is at some distance from\nSidgwick\u2019s form of utilitarianism, Parfit denied that he had\ndismissed the viability of act consequentialism (de Lazari-Radek &\nSinger 2020).\n\nIn fact, the works of de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2012, 2014, 2016)\nhave opened up some ingenious new lines of argument in this area,\narguments that, they claim, are more thoroughly Sidgwickian. As noted,\nSidgwick had argued that apparently self-evident claims had to be\nclear and precise, able to withstand critical reflection, consistent\nwith one another, and able to win a consensus of experts, though in\nother writings he collapsed the first two into just one condition. De\nLazari-Radek and Singer seem less concerned to reject any element of\nSidgwick\u2019s account than to add to it, such that the significance\nof evolutionary \u201cdebunking\u201d arguments is recognized, and\nthis leads them to reject Sidgwick\u2019s Dualism:\n\n\nWe might have become reasoning beings because that enabled us to solve\na variety of problems that would otherwise have hampered our survival,\nbut once we are capable of reasoning, we may be unable to avoid\nrecognizing and discovering some truths that do not aid our survival.\nThat can be said about some complicated truths of mathematics or\nphysics. It can also, as Parfit has suggested, be the case with some\nof our normative epistemic beliefs; for instance, the belief that when\nsome argument is valid and has true premises, so that this\nargument\u2019s conclusion must be true, these facts give us a\ndecisive reason to believe this conclusion. Parfit argues that this\nnormative claim about what we have decisive reason to believe is not\nitself evolutionarily advantageous, since to gain that advantage, it\nwould have been sufficient to have the non-normative beliefs that the\nargument is valid, and has true premises, and that the conclusion must\nbe true. Hence this and other normative epistemic beliefs are not open\nto a debunking argument. This may also hold for some of our moral\nbeliefs. One such moral truth could be Sidgwick\u2019s axiom of\nuniversal benevolence: \u201ceach one is morally bound to regard the\ngood of any other individual as much as his own, except in so far as\nhe judges it to be less, when impartially viewed, or less certainly\nknowable or attainable by him\u201d. (de Lazari-Radek & Singer\n2014: 182\u201383)\n\n\nThus, if, with Sharon Street (2006), one holds that in many cases \n\n\nit is more scientifically plausible to explain human evaluative\nattitudes as having evolved because they help us to survive and to\nhave surviving offspring, than because they are true, (de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014: 180) \n\n\none can debunk many of the beliefs competing with the Axiom of\nUniversal Benevolence, such as those purportedly justifying partial or\npersonal reasons for action. If Benevolence is not debunked, and if it\ncan in fact be accounted for straightforwardly as a result of reason\ncoming as a unity or package, such that either \n\n\nwe have a capacity to reason that includes the capacity to do advanced\nphysics and mathematics and to grasp objective moral truths, or we\nhave a much more limited capacity to reason that lacks not only these\nabilities, but others that confer an overriding evolutionary\nadvantage. If reason is a unity of this kind, having the package would\nhave been more conducive to survival and reproductions than not having\nit. (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 183) \n\n\nOf course, as Parfit commented, one might concede that this argument\nhas some force, but think other objections to egoism, say from a\nReductionist view of personal identity, or Present-Aim account of\nrationality, also matter (Parfit 2017: 339\u201340).\n\nThat Singer, in particular, should in this way have developed\ndefenses, not only of Sidgwickian hedonism, esotericism, and totalism\n(in population ethics), but also of Sidgwickian metaethical\ncognitivism (against his former commitment to Hare\u2019s\nprescriptivism), and used these to advance a form of utilitarianism\nthat, he holds, is more consistently utilitarian than Sidgwick\u2019s\nown position and in that way in line with Sidgwick\u2019s deeper\ntendencies, is illustrative of the increasingly important role that\nSidgwick\u2019s work is playing in cutting edge ethical theory.\nWhether the principle of Universal Benevolence really has the ability\nto withstand evolutionary debunking arguments, and whether such\narguments can really be made compelling in the first place, are open\nquestions, as is the question of whether Sidgwick himself would not\nhave found such gambits too narrow and unable to address his deeper\nworries about the religious significance of the dualism of practical\nreason (Schultz 2014b, 2017; Gray 2015). But even so, these recent\ndevelopments amount to something of a Sidgwickian counter-revolution\nto the Rawlsian Kantian revolution, an effort at both the meta and\nsubstantive ethical levels to provide an effective cognitive\nintuitionist and consequentialist alternative to Kantian\nconstructivist and proceduralist accounts of moral reasons.\n\nAlthough Sidgwick denied that it was his special purpose, in the\nMethods, to call attention to the dualism of practical\nreason, this problem clearly loomed very large for him and affected\nmany other aspects of his life and work, including his views on the\nhistory of ethics: he thought egoism the dominant view of the\nclassical Greek philosophers, the difference between ancients and\nmoderns having largely to do with the modern preoccupation with\n\u201cought\u201d rather than \u201cgood\u201d and the emergence\nof the dualism in Butler (Frankena 1992; Irwin 1992, 1994, 2011; Crisp\n2015). Again, arguably, he never did full justice to non-hedonistic,\nteleological forms of perfectionism (Hurka 2001, [ed.] 2011, 2014a;\nCrisp 2015) or to fully deontological, Kantian views (Schneewind 1977;\nKorsgaard 2009). However, as the remarks above underscore, the range\nof his arguments is richer and more fertile than many of his critics\nhave recognized. Indeed, in his own day, he advanced effective\ncriticisms of the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer, the idealism of\nGreen and Bradley, and most of the other currents of philosophical\nopinion that he encountered. Weinstein (2000) argues effectively that\non key points Spencer and Sidgwick had much in common; Brink (2003)\nindicates just how intelligent and penetrating the exchanges between\nSidgwick and Green were, though he concludes that Green scored an\neffective point in charging that Sidgwick\u2019s hedonism was\nimplausible, even if coherent, a point that the recent hedonists are\nof course not willing to concede (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014,\n2016).\n\nIn the end, however, at least on the topic of classifying\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods as a work of classical\nutilitarianism, it remains difficult to dissent from\nSchneewind\u2019s summary of its heterodoxy: the Methods\n\n\ncenters on an examination of the accepted moral opinions and modes of\nthought of common sense. It involves a rejection of empiricism and\ndismisses the issue of determinism as irrelevant. It emphasizes an\nattempt to reconcile positions seen by utilitarians as deeply opposed\nto each other. It finds ethical egoism as reasonable as\nutilitarianism; and it concludes with arguments to show that, because\nof this, no full reconciliation of the various rational methods for\nreaching moral decisions is possible and therefore that the realm of\npractical reason is probably incoherent. (Schneewind 1974 [1992:\n94])\n\n\nThis helps explain why the work continues to inspire both utilitarians\nand their critics.\n4. Religion and Parapsychology\n\nIn an intriguing piece of retrospection written in 1887, Sidgwick\nexplained: \n\n\nSome fifteen years ago, when I was writing my book on Ethics, I was\ninclined to hold with Kant that we must postulate the\ncontinued existence of the soul, in order to effect that harmony of\nDuty with Happiness which seemed to me indispensable to rational moral\nlife. At any rate I thought I might provisionally postulate\nit, while setting out on the serious search for empirical evidence. If\nI decide that this search is a failure, shall I finally and decisively\nmake this postulate? Can I consistently with my whole view of truth\nand the method of its attainment? And if I answer \u201cno\u201d to\neach of these questions, have I any ethical system at all? (quoted in\nMemoir: 467)\n\n\nWhether Sidgwick\u2019s memory was entirely accurate is uncertain. In\na letter actually composed in 1870, he confessed to his friend Roden\nNoel:\n\n\nI have never based my belief in immortality on our consciousness of\nthe oneness of Self. I have always considered Kant\u2019s\n\u201cParalogisms\u201d conclusive as against that.\n\nWhat I really base it on (apart from the evidence supplied by\nSpiritualism, and apart from religious grounds) is on Ethics,\nas Kant, supported by Common Sense. But I do not state the argument\nquite as you answer it, but thus\n\nIn the face of the conflict between Virtue & Happiness, my own\nvoluntary life, and that of every other man constituted like me, i.e.,\nI believe, of every normal man, is reduced to hopeless anarchy.\n\nTwo authorities roughly speaking Butler\u2019s\n\u201cself-love\u201d and \u201cConscience\u201d claim to rule,\nand neither will yield to the other.\n\nThe only way of avoiding this intolerable anarchy is by the Postulate\nof Immortality. But you may say\u2014\u201cyou cannot believe it\nbecause you want to\u201d\n\nI reply; I find\n\nin me an inherited predisposition to this faith.\nIn human history the belief is that of the best part of mankind:\nit has nearly, though not quite, the authority of a belief of Common\nSense. (quoted in Schultz 2004: 441).\n\n\n\nAt any rate, he often expressed dissatisfaction with the Kantian\nsolution, devoting endless hours to \u201cthe serious search for\nempirical evidence\u201d of personal survival. He had long been\nsympathetic to this type of natural theology, devoting more effort to\nit than to exploring alternative epistemological arguments of\nrelevance to the dualism. Indeed, Sidgwick joined the Cambridge\n\u201cGhost Society\u201d as an undergraduate, and he had already\ndevoted many years to informal psychical research before the formation\nof the Society for Psychical Research, in 1882, although his efforts\nexpanded thanks to the larger formal organization (Gauld 1968;\nOppenheim 1985; McLuhan & Gauld 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n He was president of the SPR from 1882\u201385 and again from\n1888\u201393. The comparative sobriety of his leadership of this\norganization, which represented an unusual combination of eminent\nintellectuals, first-rate scientists, and spiritualistic lunatics,\nundoubtedly did a great deal to enhance its respectability and insure\nits longevity. Even many of the spiritualists, who were precommitted\nto belief in disembodied human spirits, seances, and so forth, allowed\nthat Sidgwick was as fair-minded as any non-mystic could be.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s parapsychology was clearly and admittedly an\nextension of his religious studies and as such relevant to the\nsolution of the dualism of practical reason. He did not successfully\nspell out the precise chain of argument leading from evidence for\nsurvival to a unified conception of practical reason, but the general\nTheistic idea of a \u201cfriendly Universe\u201d enjoying a\nutilitarian moral government was obviously behind his efforts. Again,\nalthough he was not sure that he could rationally defend it, he was\nstrongly drawn to the Theistic view that there is a \u201cHeart and\nMind\u201d behind phenomena\u2014a \u201cSovereign Will that orders\nall things rightly\u201d (Memoir: 604)\u2014and\nthat the universe is ethically meaningful, even if the storm and\nstress that he had suffered in the 1860s had permanently distanced him\nfrom Christian orthodoxy. Interestingly, his conversion to a more\nutilitarian mode of ethical theory had even predated his break with\nAnglican orthodoxy, which involved a long and painful struggle that\nhad him studying Hebrew and German, engaging with the new biblical\ncriticism of Strauss and Renan, and arguing with some of the most\nprominent theologians of his day, including Benson. He found, however,\nthat historical and philological study of the Bible could not answer\nthe deepest philosophical and ethical questions, which called for,\namong other things, free and open inquiry into the possibility of\nmiracles and paranormal phenomena. Unfortunately, he found that\northodox religion was all too often unreceptive to such forms of\ninquiry, and that his doubts about such matters as the Virgin Birth\nwere not adequately addressed by the theologians. In a revealing\npublic letter to the Times, Sidgwick distinguished three\ndifferent approaches to the Bible: \u201cSimple Scripturalism\u201d,\nwhich took it all as literally true, \u201cHistorical\nScripturalism\u201d, which took only its theological and moral\nstatements has having that standing, and \u201cRationalism\u201d,\nwhich held that, although the \u201cmost important part of religious\ntruth \u2026 was discovered or revealed before the first century of\nChristianity was closed\u201d, nonetheless \n\n\nthe process of development which the historical scripturalist traces\nbetween the earlier and later of them has continued since, and will\ncontinue, and that we cannot forecast its limits, and that even where\nthe doctrine of the Bible, taken as a whole, is clear, an appeal lies\nalways open to the common sense, common reason, and combined\nexperience of the religious portion of mankind. (quoted in Schultz\n2004: 83) \n\n\nSidgwick identified himself with the Rationalist camp, which was\ncongenial to developing a thin Theistic account of religion\nemphasizing the moral government of the universe, personal survival of\nphysical death, and the existence of a benevolent God. Indeed, he is\nconfident \u201cthat the thought of civilised Europe is moving\nrapidly in its direction, and that it must inevitably spread and\nprevail\u201d, though he also hopes \u201cthat it may spread with\nthe least possible disruption and disorganization of existing\ninstitutions, the least possible disruption of old sympathies and\nassociations\u201d. He is also confident, as he makes plain in\nvarious works, that the day of theological censure and\nauthoritarianism is passing.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s psychical research never yielded the hard proof of\nsurvival that he sought, and although at the end of his life he\nconcluded that it had been largely a waste of time, he allowed that\nthere were some positive results from it and that, at least in the\n1890s, some promising new lines of research had emerged. The\ninvestigation of personal survival turned out to be bound up with the\ninvestigation of many other purportedly paranormal phenomena:\ntelepathy, telekinesis, hypnotism, automatic writing, trance\nmediumship, apparitions of the living as well as the dead, the claims\nof Theosophy, etc. After all, it was argued, a medium supposedly\nrelaying information from the dead might instead be in telepathic\ncommunication with living sources of that information. Thus, in order\nto establish that communication from the \u201cother world\u201d had\nactually occurred, it was essential to be able to rule out the\npossibility of telepathy (Gauld 1968, 2007).\n\nThe \u201cSidgwick Group\u201d, as it was called\u2014that is,\nHenry and Eleanor Sidgwick, Arthur and Gerald Balfour, F. W. H. Myers,\nLord Rayleigh, Edmund Gurney, Frank Podmore, and a few\nothers\u2014worked in close collaboration, and ended up establishing\nto their satisfaction the reality of telepathic communication among\nthe living, the findings being presented in the series of massive (and\nquite sophisticated) studies Phantasms of the Dead,\nPhantasms of the Living, and the Census of\nHallucinations. As Myers explained the work:\n\n\nunder our heading of \u201cPhantasms of the living\u201d, we\npropose, in fact, to deal with all classes of cases where there is\nreason to suppose that the mind of one human being has affected the\nmind of another, without speech uttered, or word written, or sign\nmade;\u2014has affected it, that is to say, by other means than\nthrough the recognised channels of sense.\n\nTo such transmissions of thoughts or feelings we have elsewhere given\nthe name of telepathy; and the records of an experimental\nproof of the reality of telepathy will form a part of the present\nwork. But \u2026 we have included among telepathic phenomena a vast\nclass of cases which seem at first sight to involve something widely\ndifferent from a mere transference of thought.\n\nI refer to apparitions; excluding, indeed, the alleged\napparitions of the dead, but including the apparitions of all\npersons who are still living, as we know life, though they may be on\nthe very brink and border of physical dissolution. And these\napparitions \u2026 are themselves extremely various in character;\nincluding not visual phenomena alone, but auditory, tactile, or even\npurely ideational and emotional impressions. All these we have\nincluded under the term phantasm; a word which, though\netymologically a mere variant of phantom, has been less often\nused, and has not become so closely identified with visual\nimpressions alone. (Myers [1886], 1975: vol. II, ix)\n\n\nPsychical research, Myers goes on to suggest, can now claim \u201ca\ncertain amount of actual achievement\u201d. Thus,\n\n\nWe hold that we have proved by direct experiment, and corroborated by\nthe narratives contained in this book, the possibility of\ncommunications between two minds, inexplicable by any recognised\nphysical laws, but capable (under certain rare spontaneous conditions)\nof taking place when the persons concerned are at an indefinite\ndistance from each other. And we claim further that by investigations\nof the higher phenomena of mesmerism, and of the automatic action of\nthe mind, we have confirmed and expanded this view in various\ndirections, and attained a standing-point from which certain even\nstranger alleged phenomena begin to assume an intelligible aspect, and\nto suggest further discoveries to come.\n\nThus far the authors of this book, and also the main group of their\nfellow-workers, are substantially agreed. (Myers [1886], 1975: vol.\nII, xx)\n\n\nThis last line indicates, in particular, that Henry Sidgwick, whose\nname did not appear among the list of authors of these works, was in\nsubstantial agreement with their claims, which certainly appears to be\nthe case. As Broad, a later sympathizer, summarized one of the main\nconclusions of the most comprehensive of the studies, the Census\nof Hallucinations: \n\n\nAbout one visual hallucination in sixty-three occurs within a\nperiod of twenty-four hours round about the death of the person whose\napparition has been \u201cseen\u201d. If such deal-coincidences were\npurely fortuitous concurrences of causally independent events the\nproportion would be about one in nineteen thousand. \n\n\nBroad concluded that the Census was \u201ca uniquely and\nmeticulously careful contribution to an important branch of their\nsubject\u201d. (Broad 1938 [1952]: 144)\n\nBut these studies suggested that much of the supposed evidence for\npersonal survival was merely evidence for telepathic communications\nfrom the living (albeit, perhaps dying), and Sidgwick consequently\nfound much of this work distressing rather than encouraging. It was\nonly in the 1890s, with the famous case of Leonora Piper, that he came\nto think that there was something resembling a \u201cprima\nfacie\u201d case for survival. Piper was an American whose trance\nmediumship produced purported communications from particular deceased\npersons, and her claims withstood the combined scrutiny of the best\nresearchers in both the American and British S.P.R.s, including\nWilliam James, the Sidgwicks, Richard Hodgson, and Frank Podmore. As\nBraude (2003) indicates, the Piper case is still being debated to this\nday (see also Berger 1987). Evidence of this nature helped persuade\nEleanor Sidgwick, in the years following Henry\u2019s death, that his\npersonality had survived physical death and succeeded in communicating\nwith her. In an extremely curious, even bizarre, chapter of this\nhistory, Eleanor and her brothers, Arthur and Gerald, along with\nvarious close friends and colleagues, apparently developed a plot,\nsupposedly with help from the \u201cother side\u201d, to bring about\nthe birth of a \u201cspirit child\u201d who could become a new\nMessiah, ushering in a reign of global peace (Roy 2008; Gray 2011;\nSchultz 2017). What the actual, historical Henry might have made of\nsuch an effort at applied esoteric morality is a very intriguing\nquestion. \n\nIf much of Sidgwick\u2019s psychical research today looks rather\ngullible, it must be allowed that his positive conclusions were always\nvery cautious and guarded, and that his work in fact had an\noverwhelmingly negative, destructive effect, akin to that of recent\ndebunkers of parapsychology. The Sidgwick Group exposed one fraud\nafter another, including the fraudulent claims of Madame Blavatsky and\nthe Theosophical movement, though Theosophists continue to dispute\nthis. Indeed, Theosophy remains an influential \u201cNew Age\u201d\nform of the esoteric spiritualism that Sidgwick found attractive\n(given its concern with the common mystical core of all religions) but\nimpossible to defend (Oppenheim 1985). Insofar as parapsychology has\never enjoyed any standing as a rigorous field of scientific inquiry,\nthis is thanks to the efforts of Sidgwick. Furthermore, the work of\nthe Sidgwick Group helped pave the way for much of the developing\nresearch in depth psychology generally, calling attention to the\nefforts of Freud, Charcot, Richet and many others whose names are not\nprimarily associated with parapsychology (Gauld 1968, 2007).\n\nThus, Sidgwick\u2019s parapsychological investigations were of\na-piece with his work on ethics and religion, and, especially in the\nlate 1880s, similarly frustrating. As he explained to his close friend\nSymonds, he had \n\n\ntried all methods in turn\u2014all that I found pointed out\nby any of those who have gone before me; and all in turn have\nfailed\u2014revelational, rational, empirical methods\u2014there is\nno proof in any of them. (Memoir: 472) \n\n\nBut Sidgwick was not eager to publicly proclaim the negative results\nof his investigations, any more than he was eager to publicly proclaim\nthe skepticism about orthodox religion with with which they were\nentangled. In the 1860s, in his work with the Free Christian Union and\nreligious investigations generally, he had been more open, freely\nidentifying himself as a Rationalist and a skeptic. But in the\naftermath of his resignation, he ceased to attack openly the religious\nbeliefs and organizations that he deemed indefensible. As he later\nexplained to an old friend:\n\n\nIn fact, the reason why I keep strict silence now for many years with\nregard to theology is that while I cannot myself discover adequate\nrational basis for the Christian hope of happy immortality, it seems\nto be that the general loss of such a hope, from the minds of average\nhuman beings as now constituted, would be an evil of which I cannot\npretend to measure the extent. I am not prepared to say that the\ndissolution of the existing social order would follow, but I think the\ndanger of such dissolution would be seriously increased, and that the\nevil would certainly be very great. (Memoir: 357)\n\n\nCaught between the \u201cGreat Either-Or\u201d of \u201cPessimism\nor Faith\u201d, Sidgwick may have regarded his position as \u201can\ninevitable point in the process of thought\u201d, but it was one he\ntook \u201cas a soldier takes a post of difficulty\u201d, and he\ncould not assume the responsibility of drawing others to it\n(Memoir: 354). He was not sure that the subject of ethics was\nsufficiently like science and unlike theology to render his academic\nposition legitimate, even if he did not have to swear belief in the\nThirty-Nine Articles. But he did allow himself the hope that \n\n\na considerable improvement in average human beings in this respect of\nsympathy is like to increase the mundane happiness for men generally,\nand to render the hope of future happiness less needed to sustain them\nin the trials of life. (Memoir: 358) \n\n\nHence, the importance of political and educational reform. It was\n\u201cpremature to despair\u201d. Indeed, if Placido Bucolo, the\nforce behind an impressive series of conferences on Sidgwick hosted by\nthe University of Catania, is correct, Sidgwick\u2019s non-despairing\nTheistic heart shone through his work and activities throughout his\nlife (Bucolo, Crisp, & Schultz [eds] 2007, [eds] 2011). But there\nis still a great deal of research to do on this subject, on the\npolitics and sociology of parapsychology (see Warner 2006), as well as\nthe way in which Sidgwick distanced himself from Kantian arguments for\nreligious belief. Such research will likely prove more fruitful if it\nresists the temptation to treat the Methods as a stand-alone\nwork, with a narrow, textualist interpretive approach that Sidgwick\nhimself would have rejected. Even Parfit failed to notice that\nSidgwick had, in his psychical research, addressed the issue of the\nphilosophical significance of a Reductionist view of personal\nidentity, albeit in richer terms than the Humean ones alluded to in\nthe Methods (Schultz 2004, 2018).\n\nStill, perhaps the larger point of Sidgwick\u2019s worries about the\ndualism and related issues is best captured by the gloss that, in the\nsecond edition of the Methods, he put on the dualism and its\npossible resolution by the appropriate Theistic premise:\n\n\nFor, if we find an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our\napparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct, we seem forced\nto the conclusion that they were not really intuitions after all, and\nthat the apparently intuitive operation of the Practical Reason is\nessentially illusory. Therefore it is, one may say, a matter of life\nand death to the Practical Reason that this premise should be somehow\nobtained\u2026. it seems plain that in proportion as man has lived\nin the exercise of the Practical Reason\u2014as he believed\u2014and\nfeels as an actual force the desire to do what is right and reasonable\nas such, his demand for this premise will be intense and imperious.\nThus we are not surprised to find Socrates\u2014the type for all ages\nof the man in whom this desire is predominant\u2014declaring with\nsimple conviction that \u201cif the Rulers of the Universe do not\nprefer the just man to the unjust, it is better to die than to\nlive\u201d. And we must observe that in the feeling that prompts to\nsuch a declaration the desire to rationalize one\u2019s own conduct\nis not the sole, nor perhaps always the most prominent, element. For\nhowever difficult it may practically be to do one\u2019s duty when it\ncomes into conflict with one\u2019s happiness, it often does not seem\nvery difficult, when we are considering the question in the abstract,\nto decide in favour of duty. When a man passionately refuses to\nbelieve that the \u201cWages of Virtue\u201d can \u201cbe\ndust\u201d, it is often less from any private reckoning about his own\nwages than from a disinterested aversion to a universe so\nfundamentally irrational that \u201cGood for the Individual\u201d is\nnot ultimately identified with \u201cUniversal Good\u201d. (Sidgwick\n1877: 468\u201369)\n\n\nIt was, plausibly, this spectre of an unfriendly universe, of a\nperverse Cosmos and a fragmented self in which reason is schizophrenic\nor indeterminate, and the Wages of Virtue all too often dust, that\nmost deeply disturbed Sidgwick, even if he sometimes articulated the\nissue in drier philosophical terms. And any successful but more\nlimited defense of one side or another of the dualism may well have\nbeen, for him, only a very partial victory, a battle rather than the\nwar. His deepest convictions were more Tennysonian\u2014the allusions\nto \u201cwages\u201d being to Tennyson\u2019s poem of that title,\nthe last stanza of which reads:\n\n\nThe wages of sin is death: if the wages of Virtue be dust,\n\nWould she have heart to endure for the life of the worm and the fly?\n\nShe desires no isles of the blest, no quiet seats of the just,\n\nTo rest in a golden grove, or to bask in a summer sky;\n\nGive her the wages of going on, and not to die.\n\n\nAt the least, as Phillips (2022: 230\u201331) observes in connection\nwith the debunking argument of de Lazari-Radek and Singer, \n\n\nif they do succeed, Sidgwick would get one thing he would certainly\nhave liked\u2014an argument for the truth of utilitarianism\u2014at\nthe cost of losing another thing he also very much wanted, an argument\nfor the existence of God. \n\n\nBut that might be better put: what concerned Sidgwick most deeply was\nhow to defend a vision of a friendly moral order of the universe in\nwhich best for all and best for oneself were happily harmonized, with\nneither sacrificed for the sake of the other. Small wonder that he did\nnot find what he was looking for.\n5. Economics, Politics, Education\n\nSidgwick may have thought that the \u201cdeepest problems\u201d of\nhuman life had to do with the religious and ethical problems that\ninspired his parapsychological research, but he nonetheless also\ndevoted an enormous amount of time and energy to both the theoretical\nand practical sides of economics, politics, law, and ethics, which\nwere after all relevant to the problem of the dualism. In this he was\ncertainly in line with the tradition of Bentham and James and J. S.\nMill, all of whom presented utilitarianism as a comprehensive doctrine\nthat prioritized political, legal, and economic reform (Albee 1901;\nSkorupski 1993; Rawls 1993 [1996], 2007). If Sidgwick had his own take\non these subjects, his perspective was still that of a theorist and\nreformer with broad \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d concerns, rather\nthan that of an ethicist obsessed with personal ethics narrowly\nconstrued. His professional credentials as both an economist and\npolitical scientist were impeccable, although the professional\norganizations now associated with these disciplines were only\nbeginning to take shape in his era. He was an active member of the\nsection of the British Association concerned with political economy\nand economics, and his book on The Elements of Politics,\nfirst published in 1891, became a staple of political science at\nCambridge and elsewhere. He is best thought of as one of the founding\nfathers of the \u201cCambridge School\u201d of economics, one whose\ncontributions should be classed with those of Alfred Marshall and A.\nC. Pigou (Backhouse 2006; Medema 2009; Cook 2009; Winch 2009; Cord\n[ed.] 2017). \n\nBut Sidgwick\u2019s reputation as an economist has often suffered\nfrom an invidious comparison with Marshall, his Cambridge colleague\nand rival, who is classed among the greatest figures in the history of\nthe discipline. Marshall was both a brilliant economic thinker and a\nrelentless discipline builder, the man who basically established\nmodern economics as an independent academic discipline at Cambridge.\nAs \u201cUniversity politicians\u201d he and Sidgwick were often at\nodds with each other, since Sidgwick on some points resisted his\nefforts, believing that economics should remain integrated with the\nstudy of politics. Almost immediately upon his appointment as\nprofessor in late 1884, Marshall, in a famous incident, confronted\nSidgwick and ridiculed him for his \u201cmania\u201d for\n\u201cover-regulation\u201d and his \u201cfailure to attract men on\na large scale\u201d, the way Green had at Oxford. Marshall claimed\nthat Sidgwick was hampering his efforts, despite his greater knowledge\nof economics. Sidgwick reflected on the charges, but concluded that\nmissionary zeal was not for him:\n\n\nfeeling that the deepest truth I have to tell is by no means\n\u201cgood tidings\u201d, I naturally shrink from exercising on\nothers the personal influence which would make men [resemble] me, as\nmuch as men more optimistic and prophetic naturally aim at exercising\nsuch influences. Hence as a teacher I naturally desire to limit my\nteaching to those whose bent or deliberate choice it is to search\nafter ultimate truth; if such come to me, I try to tell them all I\nknow; if others come with vaguer aims, I wish if possible to train\ntheir faculties without guiding their judgements. I would not if I\ncould, and I could not if I would, say anything which would make\nphilosophy\u2014my philosophy\u2014popular. (Memoir:\n394\u201396)\n\n\nSidgwick had known Marshall for a long time\u2014since the\n1860s\u2014and had in fact helped his career. He had in effect\ntutored Marshall in philosophy, stimulated his interest in educational\nreform, fostered their mutual interest in political economy, and\nhelped call attention to the importance of Marshall\u2019s early\nwork, privately circulating some of it. Initially, Marshall had joined\nin the cause of women\u2019s higher education, but he later opposed\nit, despite his marriage to Newnham graduate Mary Paley. Thus, by the\n1880s and 90s, relations between the two men were often quite strained\n(Groenewegen 1995).\n\nSidgwick had in fact long been a student of political economy.\n\u201cMill\u2019s influence\u201d, he explained, led him \u201cas\na matter of duty\u201d to \u201cstudy political economy thoroughly,\nand give no little thought to practical questions, social and\npolitical\u201d (Memoir: 36). In the early 1860s, he was\nabsorbed in the study of Mill\u2019s classic work, the Principles\nof Political Economy, and much influenced by Mill\u2019s\nCambridge disciple, the blind political economist Henry Fawcett. From\nthe late 1870s on, he regularly published works in this field,\nproducing his own Principles of Political Economy in 1883,\nheading the political economy section of the British Association,\ncontributing to Palgrave, and serving on various government\nCommissions concerned with economic questions (he developed\nconsiderable expertise devising intricate taxation schemes) His work\nas an academic and policy advisor put him in touch with (directly or\nindirectly) many of the leading economists of the day\u2014not only\nsuch Cambridge colleagues as Fawcett, Marshall, J. N. Keynes, and\nHerbert Foxwell, but also such figures as Edgeworth, Leon Walras, N.\nSenior, J. E. Cairnes, and W. S. Jevons. He was even familiar with the\nwork of Karl Marx, at a time when few trained economists even knew who\nMarx was. Moreover, he was long involved with both the practical and\ntheoretical work of the Cambridge Charity Organization Society,\ndeveloping a sophisticated, eclectic approach to the issue of poor\nrelief.\n\nBut like Marshall and many economists down to the present, Sidgwick\ndrew a careful distinction between the descriptive side (the science)\nof economic analysis and the normative or policy side (the art), which\nespecially concerns the proper role of government intervention in the\nmarket system to improve wealth production or wealth distribution. He\nwas also steeped in the great methodological debates over the\nhistorical or inductive versus the analytic or deductive approaches to\nthe subject, and his balanced efforts to combine the two\u2014and\nstrengthen comparative studies as well\u2014considerably distance his\nwork from older Benthamite defenses of Laissez Faire. For Sidgwick,\n\u201ceconomic man\u201d is simply an abstraction that may be useful\nfor explaining or predicting some aspects of the behavior of people\nunder certain historical circumstances and in certain situations. Both\nthe science and art of economic analysis need to recognize the\nlimitations of the assumption that people always act out of\nself-interest and happily so. Indeed, as he rather heatedly put it in\nhis \u201cThe Scope and Method of Economic Science\u201d:\n\n\nThere is indeed a kind of political economy which flourishes in proud\nindependence of facts; and undertakes to settle all practical problems\nof Governmental interference or private philanthropy by simple\ndeduction from one or two general assumptions\u2014of which the chief\nis the assumption of the universally beneficent and harmonious\noperation of self-interest well let alone. This kind of political\neconomy is sometimes called \u201corthodox\u201d, though it has the\ncharacteristic unusual in orthodox doctrines of being repudiated by\nthe majority of accredited teachers of the subject. But whether\northodox or not, I must be allowed to disclaim all connection with it;\nthe more completely this survival of the a priori politics of\nthe eighteenth century can be banished to the remotest available\nplanet, the better it will be, in my opinion, for the progress of\neconomic science. (Sidgwick 1885: 2\u20133 [Miscellaneous:\n171])\n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s position certainly reflected the more sophisticated,\nmore historical, and even more socialistic views of the later J. S.\nMill, who had been influenced by both the Romantic movement and\nMacaulay\u2019s withering criticisms of the apriorism of\nBenthamism\u2014that is, of the supposedly Benthamite attempt to\ndeduce the best form of law and government from the assumption of\nuniversal self-interest (Capaldi 2004; Pitts 2005). Sidgwick followed\nMill in thinking that political economy needed to pay attention to the\ncomplexity and historical variety of human motivation and character,\nas well as the condition of the working class. Perhaps\ncharacteristically, however, Sidgwick appreciated the paradox involved\nin the successful application of the historical method:\n\n\n[I]t may be worth while to point out to the more aggressive\n\u201chistoricists\u201d that the more the historian establishes the\nindependence of his own study, by bringing into clear view the great\ndifferences between the economic conditions with which we are familiar\nand those of earlier ages, the more, prima facie, he tends to\nestablish the corresponding independence of the economic science\nwhich, pursued with a view to practice, is primarily concerned to\nunderstand the present. (Sidgwick 1883 [1901: 48])\n\n\nThis is not to applaud the increasing individualism and\nself-interested behavior of the modern world, which in fact rather\nworried Sidgwick. Again like Mill, he hoped that the future would\nbring a growth in human sympathy and moral motivation. He even hoped\nthat individuals would come to be motivated to work by their concern\nto do their bit for the common good, to make their contribution to\nsociety; \u201cethical\u201d socialism, though not necessarily\ngovernmental socialism, was for him a very attractive development.\nHowever, another side of this story concerns how those in the\n\u201cwaiting room of history\u201d, as Chakrabarty (2000) called\nit, would be treated, not as different, but as inferior. As Mill put\nit, in The Principles of Political Economy:\n\n\nTo civilize a savage, he must be inspired with new wants and desires,\neven if not of a very elevated kind, provided that their gratification\ncan be a motive to steady and regular bodily and mental exertion. If\nthe negroes of Jamaica and Demerara, after their emancipation had\ncontented themselves, as it was predicted they would do, with the\nnecessaries of life, and abandoned all labour beyond the little which\nin a tropical climate, with a thin population and abundance of the\nrichest land, is sufficient to support existence, they would have sunk\ninto a condition more barbarous, though less unhappy, than their\nprevious state of slavery. The motive which was most relied on for\ninducing them to work was their love of fine clothes and personal\nornaments. No one will stand up for this taste as worthy of being\ncultivated, and in most societies its indulgence tends to impoverish\nrather than to enrich; but in the state of mind of the negroes it\nmight have been the only incentive that could make them voluntarily\nundergo systematic labour, and so acquire or maintain habits of\nvoluntary industry which may be converted to more valuable ends. In\nEngland, it is not the desire of wealth that needs to be taught, but\nthe use of wealth, and appreciation of the objects of desire which\nwealth cannot purchase, or for attaining which it is not required.\nEvery real improvement in the character of the English, whether it\nconsist in giving them higher aspirations, or only a juster estimate\nof the value of their present objects of desire, must necessarily\nmoderate the ardour of their devotion to the pursuit of wealth. (Mill\n1871: 104\u20135)\n\n\nLike Mill, and Bentham for that matter, Sidgwick was an enthusiastic\nsupporter of Wakefield and colonization, which was deemed necessary to\nrelieve pressures of population growth in England. Like them, he\ndevoted considerable energy to theorizing the comparative demands of\ncolonization, settler colonization, and dominion with respect to\nBritain\u2019s \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d. But at least with\nrespect to his contributions to the supposed \u201cscience\u201d of\neconomics, there has long been considerable controversy over how\nsuccessful Sidgwick was in going beyond Mill and appreciating the\n\u201cmarginalist revolution\u201d going on around him. Deane argues\nthat \n\n\nthe Principles owed more to the classical tradition of J. S.\nMill than to what contemporaries were then calling the \u201cnew\npolitical economy\u201d of Jevons and Marshall. (Deane 1987: 329)\n\n\n\nAnd Howey, in an influential work, insists that economists \n\n\nmust add something to and take something away from hedonism, as\nordinarily construed, before it becomes marginal utility economics.\nJevons and Gossen could make the transformation; Sidgwick never could.\n(Howey 1960: 95) \n\n\nOn the other side, however, Sidgwick\u2019s economic work has been\npraised by more than one Nobel Prize winner, including George Stigler.\nStigler, after remarking on how the work of Cournot and Dupuit on\nmonopoly and oligopoly \u201cbegan to enter English economics, in\nparticular though Edgeworth, Sidgwick, and Marshall\u201d, confessed\nthat he was \n\n\ncoming to admire Henry Sidgwick almost as much as the other two. His\nPrinciples \u2026 has two chapters (bk II, ch. IX and X)\nwhich are among the best in the history of microeconomics, dealing\nwith the theories of human capital and noncompetitive behavior.\n(Stigler 1982: 41) \n\n\nElements of the Chicago School of Economics, particularly of law and\neconomics, have been intriguingly traced back to Sidgwick by Steven\nMedema (2007), who has also helpfully brought out the impact of\nSidgwick\u2019s religious concerns on his economic approach (2008,\n2009). Many of the contributions to Cord (2017) clarify and highlight\nthe role Sidgwick played in the development of economics, at Cambridge\nand in general.\n\nFor his part, Sidgwick at least claimed that he was part of the new\nmovement, describing himself as a disciple of Jevons: \n\n\nas Jevons had admirably explained, the variations in the relative\nmarket values of different articles express and correspond to\nvariations in the comparative estimates formed by people in general,\nnot of the total utilities of the amounts purchased of such\narticles, but of their final utilities; the utilities, that\nis, of the last portions purchased. (Sidgwick 1883 [1901: 82]) \n\n\nBut he did allow that the differences with the older, Millian school\nhad been exaggerated, and he continued, despite his considerable\nmathematical expertise, to do economics in a qualitative mode. Even\nso, he showed considerable acumen in setting out and conceptually\nclarifying the fundamental concepts of economics (wealth, value,\nlabor, money, efficiency, etc.), in bringing out the difficulties\ninvolved in cross-cultural and trans-historical comparisons of wealth,\nand in analyzing the various cases of market failure, from monopoly to\ncollective action problems to negative externalities. Indeed, his\naccounts of market failure and the possible remedies\u2014the\n\u201cart\u201d of political economy\u2014have received somewhat\nmore recognition. Even Marshall praised this side of Sidgwick\u2019s\nwork. It is widely admitted that Marshall\u2019s hand-picked\nsuccessor at Cambridge, A. C. Pigou, produced a form of welfare\neconomics that largely recapitulated Sidgwick\u2019s contributions\n(Backhouse 2006; Medema 2009; Cook 2009; Winch 2009).\n\nThe form of Sidgwick\u2019s Principles of Political Economy,\nwith its careful conceptual clarifications and distinction between\nnormative and descriptive arguments, and its successive qualifications\nto individualistic, free market accounts of both, would prove to be\ncharacteristic, figuring in many of his essays and in such works as\nThe Elements of Politics. As in the case of the\nMethods, the structure of these works has often made it\ndifficult to see precisely where Sidgwick comes down on many issues.\nTypically, he begins with a robust statement of the\n\u201cindividualistic principle\u201d, as, for example, in the\nElements:\n\n\nwhat one sane adult is legally compelled to render to others should be\nmerely the negative service of non-interference, except so far as he\nhas voluntarily undertaken to render positive services; provided that\nwe include in the notion of non-interference the obligation of\nremedying or compensating for mischief intentionally or carelessly\ncaused by his acts\u2014or preventing mischief that would otherwise\nresult from previous acts. This principle for determining the nature\nand limits of governmental interference is currently known as\n\u201cIndividualism\u201d \u2026 the requirement that one sane\nadult, apart from contract or claim to reparation, shall contribute\npositively by money or services to the support of others I shall call\n\u201csocialistic\u201d. (Sidgwick 1891 [1919: 42])\n\n\nThen, typically, he goes on to explain how any such principle reflects\nvarious psychological and sociological presuppositions\u2014for\nexample, that sane adults are the best judges of their own\ninterests\u2014and that these are only approximate generalizations\nand subject to crucial limitations. The psychological assumption that\n\u201cevery one can best take care of his own interest\u201d and the\nsociological one that \u201cthe common welfare is best attained by\neach pursuing exclusively his own welfare and that of his family in a\nthoroughly alert and intelligent manner\u201d\u2014both essential to\nthe case for Laissez Faire\u2014end up being very heavily qualified\nand subject to so many exceptions that it is scarcely evident what\nSidgwick means when he calls individualism \u201cin the main\nsound\u201d. The list of qualifications covers everything from\neducation, defense, child care, poor relief, public works, collective\nbargaining, environmental protections, and more. He stresses two cases\nthat, he urges, perspicuously point up the problems with the\nindividualistic principle: \u201cthe humane treatment of lunatics,\nand the prevention of cruelty to the inferior animals\u201d. Such\nrestrictions do not aim at securing the freedom of the lunatics or the\nanimals, but are a \u201cone-sided restraint of the freedom of action\nof men with a view to the greatest happiness of the aggregate of\nsentient beings\u201d. An unfortunate\u2014but alas, all too\nrevealing\u2014note adds that the \u201cprotection of inferior races\nof men will be considered in a subsequent chapter\u201d (Sidgwick\n1891 [1919: 141\u201342]).\n\nThese qualifications and limitations then invariably involve a\ndiscussion of the case for socialism and/or communism, a subject that\nSidgwick addressed at length in many works. His main objection to\nsocialistic interference was the familiar one that too much of it\nwould lead to splendidly equal destitution, as the old line has it,\nand that for people as presently constituted economic incentives were\nneeded to spur them to produce. But again, a better, more communal\nworld was possible, and he hoped that \u201chuman nature\u201d would\nchange, growing more sympathetic and more amenable to ethical\nsocialism, leaving the door open to the possibility of legitimating\nmuch greater governmental interference with the market. Winch (2009)\nexpertly brings out not only how far Sidgwick went in suggesting that\ngovernment interference with markets should become \u201ca normal\nelement\u201d of industrial policy, but also how his acceptable\nalternative to expropriating landlords as part of radical land\nnationalization was a program of reparative justice such that the poor\n\u201cshould be eligible for compensation by the rich\u201d. (Winch\n2009: 219). \n\nAt any rate, as noted above, whatever his anxieties about economic\nsocialism, Sidgwick was openly enthusiastic about ethical socialism,\nthe possibility of humanity growing more altruistic and compassionate,\nregarding their labor as their contribution to the common good. He was\nunder no illusions whatsoever, not only about the market failing to\nreflect claims of desert or merit, but also about the limitations of\nthat abstraction, \u201ceconomic man\u201d, since historical and\ncultural or national context could dramatically alter the\npossibilities for moving beyond economic individualism, though again,\nin some areas this emphasis on \u201cnational character\u201d lent\nitself to the racist and imperialistic tendencies of the British\nempire (Schultz 2004). It is possible that Sidgwick\u2019s drift\ntoward racism may have been in significant part a result of his\nabsorption in the work of Jevons, who held that a \u201cman of lower\nrace, a negro for instance, enjoys possession less, and loathes labour\nmore; his exertions, therefore, soon stop\u201d (Jevons 1871: 177).\nSuch views on matters of race, which were more extreme than\nMill\u2019s, would increasingly reverberate through late\nnineteenth-century political economy (Macmillan 1890), finding\nexpression in Sidgwick\u2019s admirer Edgeworth, who would insist on\nhow \u201cCapacity for pleasure is a property of evolution, an\nessential attribute of civilisation\u201d, with\n\u201ccivilisation\u201d being determined in part by race.\n(Edgeworth 1881 [2003: 78]).\n\nClearly, in his political theoretical work, Sidgwick admittedly simply\nassumed the utilitarian criterion as the normative bottom line, rather\nthan arguing for it against rational egoism. He also stressed, in many\ndifferent works, that no one could confidently predict the direction\nof civilization. Although in his more historical works, notably\nThe Development of European Polity, Sidgwick assembled\nevidence to suggest that a continued growth in federalism and\nlarge-scale state organizations was likely, it was a very carefully\nhedged conclusion and cast against a broad critique of the social\nsciences. Much as he admired the sweep and ambition of such pioneers\nof sociology as Spencer and Comte (whose emphasis on the\n\u201cconsensus of experts\u201d was appropriated for his\nepistemological work), he regarded their \u201csciences\u201d of the\nlaws of human development as absurdly over-blown, yielding wildly\ndifferent predictions about the future course of humanity. He\nsincerely hoped that a more cosmopolitan attitude would be the wave of\nthe future, and that the growth of international law and cooperation\nwould decrease the likelihood of war, but he could not convince\nhimself that social science\u2014with the partial exception of\neconomics\u2014was beyond its infancy when it came to predicting\nthings to come (Sidgwick 1902a; see also the introduction to Bryce\n& Sidgwick [eds] 1919).\n\nThus, although D. G. Ritchie famously charged that with Sidgwick\nutilitarianism had grown \u201ctame and sleek\u201d and lost its\nreforming zeal, others, notably F. A. Hayek, held that he had in\neffect paved the way for the \u201cNew Liberalism\u201d and even\nFabian socialism that soon overtook British politics, legitimating a\nfar greater degree of state intervention (Schultz 2004). Woodrow\nWilson, the future president of the U. S., admired Sidgwick\u2019s\nElements, but found the more abstract, analytic side of his\nwork oddly \u201ccolorless\u201d and in need of historical content.\nThese debates continue (Collini 2001; Kloppenberg 1992; H. S. Jones\n2000; Bell 2007, 2016; Winch 2009; Miller 2020), though it would be\ndifficult to conclude that anyone has got Sidgwick quite right.\nSidgwick was at times tame and sleek, at times subversive and\nreformist, at times anxious, at times hopeful, and always more or less\nskeptical. At any rate, Sidgwick\u2019s work in politics and\npolitical theory, like his work in economics, does reveal how far he\nwas from Benthamism; he even criticized at length the Austinian theory\nof sovereignty\u2014which analyzed law in terms of authoritative\ncommand and habitual obedience\u2014so dear to the Benthamites, in a\ncritique that received high praise from the legal historian (and\nSidgwick student) F. W. Maitland.\n\nBut some sides of Sidgwick have not aged at all well, though they too\nneed to be addressed. In an important article on \u201cThe Political\nPhilosophy of Henry Sidgwick\u201d, Miller goes so far as to argue\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s political philosophy has \u201cfallen into\noblivion while his ethics continues to be celebrated\u201d because of\n\n\n\nthe weight he attached to common sentiments and beliefs in his\napplication of the utility principle, illustrated by his treatment of\ntopics such as secession and colonialism. Moreover his Elements of\nPolitics is arranged in such a way that he never has to confront\nthe basic question of what makes states legitimate. This means that\nneither political moralists, who want to see the utility principle\napplied in more radical fashion, nor political realists, for whom the\nproblem of establishing political order is central, find much to\ncommend in his political philosophy. (Miller 2020: 261) \n\n\nThere is certainly much that is right in Miller\u2019s position. It\nmust be allowed, at the least, that Sidgwick\u2019s political\nwritings did not achieve the inspiring tone of J. S. Mill, and that,\nfor all of his indebtedness to On Liberty, Considerations on\nRepresentative Government etc., he tended to highlight the more\nelitist Millian concerns\u2014concerns that often reflected his\nanxieties about the dualism of practical reason, rather than his hopes\nfor a better world. Like the later Mill, Sidgwick harbored many\nsuspicions about the wisdom of democracy and championed the need for a\ncultural \u201cclerisy\u201d or vanguard of educated opinion, often\nsounding a note not unlike that of Walter Lippmann in the twentieth\ncentury, stressing how an educated elite should benevolently shape\npublic opinion. He much admired the work of his friend James Bryce,\nauthor of The American Commonwealth (1888), which pointed up\nboth the vitality and the dangers of the U.S. political system. But he\ndevoted comparatively little effort to proclaiming the benefits of\nfreedom of conscience and speech (or grassroots democracy), was quite\ncritical of Mill\u2019s schemes for proportional representation, and\nworried at length about how \n\n\nto correct the erroneous and short-sighted views of self-interest,\nrepresenting it as divergent from duty, which certainly appear to be\nwidely prevalent in the most advanced societies, at least among\nirreligious persons. \n\n\nIn fact, for the government to supply teachers of this view might even\nbe \n\n\nindirectly individualistic in its aim, since to diffuse the conviction\nthat it is every one\u2019s interest to do what is right would\nobviously be a valuable protection against mutual wrong, \n\n\nthough it would probably detract from the credibility of such teachers\nif they were salaried employees of the state (Sidgwick 1891 [1919:\n213\u201314]). \n\nThe more sinister aspects of Sidgwick\u2019s worries about what he\ntermed the\u201clower classes\u201d and the \u201clower\nraces\u201d, and the ways in which his work (including his\nparapsychology) intertwined with a variety of late Victorian\nimperialistic projects, including those of his colleague Sir John\nSeeley, his friend Charles Henry Pearson, and his brother-in-law\nArthur Balfour, have been brought out primarily by Schultz (2004,\n2007, 2017) and Bell (2007, 2016), though Miller also recognizes the\nimportance of these matters. Plausibly, another reason why\nSidgwick\u2019s political work has been comparatively neglected is\nthat there is so much deeply offensive, colonialist, imperialist, and\nracist content in it. As Bell puts it:\n\n\nSidgwick frequently wrote in a racialized idiom, and his work is\nstudded with examples of crude (albeit standard) civilizational\nstereotyping\u2026. This was a vision of liberal civilizational\nimperialism, remaking the manners as well as the map of the world, and\ndrawing on a long-standing argument about the occupation of\n\u201cunoccupied\u201d territory leavened with late Victorian\nmoralism about the duties of imperialists to indigenous populations.\n(Bell 2016: 262)\n\n\nFor Sidgwick, it was an open, urgent question whether the \u201clower\nraces\u201d were not inherently so, and he thought that intermarriage\nbetween races should be prohibited (as it often was) if there was\nforthcoming evidence that such marriages could result in the\n\u201cdebasement\u201d of the \u201csuperior\u201d race, though he\nhoped that would not prove to be the case. In addition to admiring his\ncolleague Seeley\u2019s work on the expansion of England, he allowed\nthat the evidence marshalled by his friend Charles Henry Pearson, in\nhis National Life and Character, evidence about the\n\u201cthreat\u201d to the supremacy of the \u201cwhite races\u201d\nfrom the \u201cblack and yellow races\u201d, was very impressive, if\nnot quite decisive (Schultz 2004; 2017: 328\u20133). Like so many in\nhis circles, Sidgwick occasionally used the \u201cN word\u201d to\nrefer to Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and even while\nacknowledging the historical atrocities of settler colonialism, he\ninsisted that\n\n\ncivilised nations \u2026 in performance of their legitimate\nbusiness\u2014for it is their legitimate business on utilitarian\nprinciples\u2014of civilizing the world \u2026 have to commit acts\nwhich cannot but be regarded as aggressive by the savage nations whom\nit is their business to educate and absorb. (Sidgwick 1902a:\n236\u201337) \n\n\nHe bought into the racist stereotyping of \u201cnational\ncharacter\u201d to be found in Millian ethology and the work of\nBryce, and he supported the harsh repressive measures his\nbrother-in-law Arthur Balfour used against the Irish, during his time\nas Irish Secretary, opposing Home Rule for Ireland. He extolled the\nsatisfactions of the \u201cspiritual expansion\u201d of\n\u201ccivilized\u201d nations, whatever the economics of the matter,\nand apparently despite the fact that when it came to metaethical\nfoundations, these nations were not themselves very far along on the\nimperialist scale of \u201ccivilization\u201d, being too tempted by\na Machiavellian materialism and Jingoism making for conflict at home\nand abroad. \n\nThus, perhaps what Sidgwick\u2019s political writings so effectively\nhighlight is how his version of liberal imperialism is weaker on the\nliberal side than the Millian version, and how his views on quelling\nsocial strife and achieving peace through a more cosmopolitan,\ninternationalist world order could reflect his racialized and racist\nversion of the \u201ccivilizational mission\u201d of Victorian\nimperialism, heightened by anxieties about the growth of democracy and\nthe decline of religion. As with Mill, it is through the lens of the\ncritique of the culture of imperialism that one can most sharply\ndiscern just why education was accorded such a crucial role here.\nGiven the anti and postcolonial scholarship devoted to Bentham and\nJames and John Stuart Mill, for example Inder Marwah\u2019s\nLiberalism, Diversity and Domination: Kant, Mill and the\nGovernment of Difference (Marwah 2019; see also Pitts 2005), it\nis very surprising indeed how the comprehensive vision of\nutilitarianism that Sidgwick advanced could be ignored or censored in\nthe way that it has been and mostly continues to be. Of course, as\nwith Mill, Sidgwick was somewhat better on the home front and with\ncertain reformist causes, at least insofar as these can be\ndecolonized. Despite his disclaimers, he truly was committed to\nexpanding and improving educational opportunities, the better to\ninfluence the direction of reform. His (highly Millian) feminism was\nfocused on higher education for women and the foundation of Newnham\nCollege, and his many attempts to improve the curriculum of Cambridge\nUniversity (by including Bentham, modern literature, physiology and\nother new subjects) were correlated with efforts to expand its\naudience and impact (McWilliams Tullberg 1975 [1998]; Sutherland\n2006). And beyond formal educational institutions, Sidgwick was\nindefatigable in promoting and participating in discussion societies,\never aiming at the elusive \u201cconsensus of experts\u201d that his\nepistemology called for. If, towards the end of his life, his\nparticipation in such vehicles as the \u201cEthical Societies\u201d\nreflected his despair over the possibility of achieving such a\nconsensus on the \u201cdeepest problems\u201d, and instead involved\nan effort to set such problems aside in the hope of agreeing on the\npractical upshot of ethical questions (Sidgwick 1898), this was not\nhis most characteristic attitude (Skelton 2011), though such\nparticipation did bring home to him how important it was to widen his\ndialogical efforts. His support for John Addington Symonds, one of the\nEnglish followers of Walt Whitman and a pioneer of gay studies, is\nalso suggestive of how important some of his reformist efforts could\nbe (Schultz 2004).\n\nAs with other aspects of his politics, Sidgwick\u2019s views on\neducation and culture have not received nearly as much critical\nattention as his ethical work. But they merit careful analysis, given\nthe way in which he fell in between Mill and Dewey as a prominent and\npolitically charged consequentialist philosopher-educator. Calling for\nthe inclusion of both older humanistic and modern scientific elements\nin any form of education worthy of the name, and for an open-minded\nfallibilistic attitude, he explained in \u201cThe Pursuit of\nCulture\u201d:\n\n\nsince the most essential function of the mind is to think and know, a\nman of cultivated mind must be essentially concerned for knowledge:\nbut it is not knowledge merely that gives culture. A man may be\nlearned and yet lack culture: for he may be a pedant, and the\ncharacteristic of a pedant is that he has knowledge without culture.\nSo again, a load of facts retained in the memory, a mass of reasonings\ngot up merely for examination, these are not, they do not give\nculture. It is the love of knowledge, the ardour of scientific\ncuriosity, driving us continually to absorb new facts and ideas, to\nmake them our own and fit them into the living and growing system of\nour thought; and the trained faculty of doing this, the alert and\nsupple intelligence exercised and continually developed in doing\nthis,\u2014it is in these that culture essentially lies. (1897\n[Miscellaneous: 352]).\n\n\nPerhaps Sidgwick would have admitted that there was always room for\nmore doubt.\n",
