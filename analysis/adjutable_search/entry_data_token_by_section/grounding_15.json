    "main_text": "Interaction with Other Notions || Essence\n4.2 Essence\n\nHow do grounding and essence interact? On the relevant notion of\nessence, essence isn\u2019t a purely modal matter\u2014while all\nessential truths about some item (truths that characterize what it is\nto be that item) are necessary, not all necessary truths about some\nitem are essential truths about it (Fine 1994). For example, anything\nthat is identical to Beijing is a city, and this is a candidate\nessential truth about Beijing. But, while it\u2019s necessary that\nBeijing exists only if {Beijing} exists, this isn\u2019t a candidate\nessential truth about the city (though it\u2019s a candidate\nessential truth about {Beijing}). Intuitively, you can know everything\nthere is to know about what it is to be Beijing and not thereby know\nanything about sets.\n\nWe begin with an essence-to-grounding principle, one specifying a\npotential entailment from truths about essence to truths about what\ngrounds what. According to Rosen (2010), for any x, if\nit\u2019s essential to x that P, then [It\u2019s\nessential to x that P] grounds \\([P]\\) (see also\nDasgupta 2016 and Kment 2014: Ch. 6). Rosen points out that this\nprinciple, if true, may clarify the grounding profile of certain\nuniversal facts. For example, perhaps [It\u2019s essential to\ntriangularity that all triangles have three sides] grounds [All\ntriangles have three sides]. (See Glazier 2017 and Zylstra 2019b for\ncritical discussion.)\n\nTurning to grounding-to-essence principles, some, such as Correia\n(2013), O\u2019Conaill (2018), and Trogdon (2013b), focus in this\ncontext on putative essential truths that themselves don\u2019t\ndirectly concern grounding (e.g., part of what it is to be the\nproperty of being maroon is that, for any x, if x is\nmaroon, then x is red). Others, such as Audi (2012a), focus\non corresponding essential truths that encode information about what\ngrounds what (e.g., part of what it is to be the property of being\nmaroon is that, for any x, if x is maroon, then\n[x is maroon] grounds [x is red]). Let\u2019s focus\non putative essential truths of the former, grounding-free variety,\nwhere these truths are understood to characterize facts rather than\nentities they concern.\n\nYou might think that, if \\([P]\\), \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q],\\)\nthen part of what it is to \\([Q]\\) is that if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 obtains then \\([Q]\\) obtains. As Fine (2012a) notes, however,\nthere are potential counterexamples. While [Socrates is a philosopher]\ngrounds [Someone is a philosopher], on the face of it no essential\ntruth about the latter encodes information about Socrates in\nparticular. One possibility is to weaken the proposal so that the\nessential truths may characterize either \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026\nor \\([Q]\\). (A further consideration is whether we should understand\nthis principle as allowing for the relevant essential truths to be\nirreducibly collective.) Fine (2012a) takes a different route,\nclaiming that, whenever some facts ground another fact, there will be\nsome true generalization of this grounding connection that\n\ndoesn\u2019t mention the grounds;\nsuffices, together with the grounds, for the grounded; and\nis an essential truth about the grounded.\n\n\nWith respect to the case just mentioned, Fine proposes that this is\nthe relevant generalization: for any x, if x is a\nphilosopher, then [x is a philosopher] grounds [Someone is a\nphilosopher]. Fine notes that this principle, if true, suggests a\ntop-down approach to establishing what grounds what, one where we\nbegin with those facts we take to be grounded and then work our way\ndown to their grounds.\n\nAs Rosen notes (2010), however, these principles rule out so-called\nMoorean connections, grounding connections that aren\u2019t mediated\nby essential truths. If, say, non-reductive physicalism about the\nmental is best formulated in terms of Moorean connections as Rosen\nsuggests, then the above grounding-to-essence principle has the\nundesirable result of ruling out what is arguably the dominant view\nconcerning the metaphysics of mind.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have the space to explore these proposals here,\nsome have proposed not just essence-to-grounding or\ngrounding-to-essence principles but full-blown accounts of essence in\nterms of grounding or vice versa. deRosset (2013) and Gorman (2014)\npropose accounts of essence in terms of grounding. (See Zylstra 2018\nfor critical discussion.) Correia (2013) and Zylstra (2019a) instead\npropose accounts of grounding in terms of essence. Finally, some have\nproposed accounts of both essence and grounding in terms of some third\nitem\u2014Fine (2015) does so in terms of constitutively necessary\nand sufficient conditions, and Correia and Skiles (2019) in terms of\ngeneralized identity. (See Zylstra 2020 for critical discussion of\neach of the above accounts.)\n",
