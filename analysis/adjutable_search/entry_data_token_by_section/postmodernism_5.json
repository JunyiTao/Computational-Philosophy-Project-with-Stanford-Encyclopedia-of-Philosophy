    "main_text": "Hyperreality\n6. Hyperreality\n Hyperreality is closely related to the concept of the simulacrum:\na copy or image without reference to an original.  In postmodernism,\nhyperreality is the result of the technological mediation of\nexperience, where what passes for reality is a network of images and\nsigns without an external referent, such that what is represented is\nrepresentation itself. In Symbolic Exchange and Death (1976),\nJean Baudrillard uses Lacan's concepts of the symbolic, the imaginary,\nand the real to develop this concept while attacking orthodoxies of\nthe political Left, beginning with the assumed reality of power,\nproduction, desire, society, and political legitimacy. Baudrillard\nargues that all of these realities have become simulations, that\nis, signs without any referent, because the real and the\nimaginary have been absorbed into the symbolic.\n\nBaudrillard presents hyperreality as the terminal stage of\nsimulation, where a sign or image has no relation to any reality\nwhatsoever, but is \u201cits own pure simulacrum\u201d (Baudrillard\n1981, 6). The real, he says, has become an operational effect of\nsymbolic processes, just as images are technologically generated and\ncoded before we actually perceive them. This means technological\nmediation has usurped the productive role of the Kantian subject, the\nlocus of an original synthesis of concepts and intuitions, as well as\nthe Marxian worker, the producer of capital though labor, and the\nFreudian unconscious, the mechanism of repression and\ndesire. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d says Baudrillard, \u201csigns are\nexchanged against each other rather than against the real\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 7), so production now means signs producing other\nsigns. The system of symbolic exchange is therefore no longer real\nbut \u201chyperreal.\u201d Where the real is \u201cthat of\nwhich it is possible to provide an equivalent\nreproduction,\u201d the hyperreal, says Baudrillard, is\n\u201cthat which is always already reproduced\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 73). The hyperreal is a system of simulation\nsimulating itself.\n\nThe lesson Baudrillard draws from the events of May 1968 is that the\nstudent movement was provoked by the realization that \u201cwe\nwere no longer productive\u201d (Baudrillard 1976, 29), and\nthat direct opposition within the system of communication and\nexchange only reproduces the mechanisms of the system\nitself. Strategically, he says, capital can only be defeated by\nintroducing something inexchangeable into the symbolic order, that\nis, something having the irreversible function of natural death,\nwhich the symbolic order excludes and renders invisible. The system,\nhe points out, simulates natural death with fascinating images of\nviolent death and catastrophe, where death is the result of\nartificial processes and \u201caccidents.\u201d But, as Baudrillard\nremarks: \u201cOnly the death-function cannot be programmed and\nlocalized\u201d (Baudrillard 1976, 126), and by this he means death\nas the simple and irreversible finality of life. Therefore he calls\nfor the development of \u201cfatal strategies\u201d to make the\nsystem suffer reversal and collapse.\n\nBecause these strategies must be carried out within the symbolic\norder, they are matters of rhetoric and art, or a hybrid of\nboth. They also function as gifts or sacrifices, for which the system\nhas no counter-move or equivalence. Baudrillard finds a prime example\nof this strategy with graffiti artists who experiment with symbolic\nmarkings and codes in order to suggest communication while blocking\nit, and who sign their inscriptions with pseudonyms instead of\nrecognizable names. \u201cThey are seeking not to escape the\ncombinatory in order to regain an identity,\u201d says Baudrillard,\n\u201cbut to turn indeterminacy against the system, to\nturn indeterminacy into extermination\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 78). Some of his own remarks, such as \u201cI\nhave nothing to do with postmodernism,\u201d have, no doubt, the\nsame strategic intent.  To the extent that\n\u201cpostmodernism\u201d has become a sign exchangeable for other\nsigns, he would indeed want nothing to do with it. Nevertheless, his\nconcepts of simulation and hyperreality, and his call for strategic\nexperimentation with signs and codes, bring him into close proximity\nwith figures such as Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida.\n",
