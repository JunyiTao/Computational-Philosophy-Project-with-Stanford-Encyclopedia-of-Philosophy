    "main_text": "The Syllogistic || Metatheoretical Results\n5.5 Metatheoretical Results\n\nHaving established which deductions in the figures are possible,\nAristotle draws a number of metatheoretical conclusions,\nincluding:\n\nNo deduction has two negative premises\nNo deduction has two particular premises\nA deduction with an affirmative conclusion must have two\naffirmative premises\nA deduction with a negative conclusion must have one negative\npremise.\nA deduction with a universal conclusion must have two universal\npremises\n\n\nHe also proves the following metatheorem:\n\nAll deductions can be reduced to the two universal deductions in the\nfirst figure.\n\n\nHis proof of this is elegant. First, he shows that the two particular\ndeductions of the first figure can be reduced, by proof through\nimpossibility, to the universal deductions in the second figure:\n\n(Darii)\n\\((Aab, Ibc, +Eac)\\vdash_{Camestres} (Ebc, Ibc)\\vdash_{Imp}\nIac\\)\n(Ferio)\n\\((Eab, Ibc, +Aac)\\vdash_{Cesare} (Ebc, Ibc)\\vdash_{Imp}\nOac\\)\n\n\nHe then observes that since he has already shown how to reduce all the\nparticular deductions in the other figures except Baroco and\nBocardo to Darii and Ferio, these\ndeductions can thus be reduced to Barbara and\nCelarent. This proof is strikingly similar both in structure\nand in subject to modern proofs of the redundancy of axioms in a\nsystem.\n\nMany more metatheoretical results, some of them quite sophisticated,\nare proved in Prior Analytics I.45 and in Prior\nAnalytics II. As noted below, some of Aristotle\u2019s\nmetatheoretical results are appealed to in the epistemological\narguments of the Posterior Analytics.\n",
