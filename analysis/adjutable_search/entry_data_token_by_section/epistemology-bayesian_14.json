    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence || Regularity\n3.3 Regularity\n\nA contingent proposition is true in some cases, while a logical\nfalsehood is true in no cases at all. So perhaps the credence in the\nformer should always be greater than the credence in the latter, which\nmust be 0. This line of thought motivates the following norm:\n\n\nRegularity. It ought to be that, if one has a\ncredence in a logically consistent proposition, it is greater than\n0.\n\n\n\nRegularity has been defended with a Dutch Book argument\u2014a\nsomewhat nonstandard one. Kemeny (1955) and Shimony (1955) show that\nany violation of Regularity opens the door to a nonstandard,\nweak Dutch Book, which is a set of bets that guarantees no\ngain but has a possible loss. In contrast, a standard Dutch Book has a\nsure loss. This raises the question whether it is really so bad to be\nvulnerable to a weak Dutch Book.\n\nOne might object to Regularity on the ground that it is in conflict\nwith Conditionalization. To see the conflict, note that\nconditionalization on a contingent proposition \\(E\\) drops the\ncredence in another contingent proposition, \\(\\neg E\\), down to zero.\nBut that violates Regularity. In reply, defenders of Regularity can\nreplace conditionalization by a generalization of it called\nJeffrey Conditionalization, which need not drop any credence\ndown to zero. Jeffrey Conditionalization will be defined and discussed\nin\n section 5.3.\n\nThere is a more serious objection to Regularity. Consider the\nfollowing case:\n\n\nExample (Coin). An agent is interested in the\nbias of a certain coin\u2014the objective, physical chance\nfor that coin to land heads when tossed. This agent\u2019s credences\nare distributed uniformly over the possible biases of the\ncoin. This means that her credence in \u201cthe bias falls within\ninterval \\([a, b]\\)\u201d is equal to the length of the interval,\n\\(b-a\\), provided that the interval is nested within \\([0, 1]\\). Now\nthink about \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, which says that the bias\nis equal to 0.5, i.e., that the bias falls within the trivial interval\n\\([0.5, 0.5]\\). So \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is assigned credence\n\\(0.5 - 0.5\\), which equals 0 and violates Regularity.\n\n\n\nBut there seems to be nothing incoherent in this agent\u2019s\ncredences.\n\nOne possible response is to insist on Regularity and hold that the\nagent in the Coin Case is actually incoherent in a subtle way. Namely,\nthat agent\u2019s credence in \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d should\nnot be zero but should be an infinitesimal\u2014smaller than\nany positive real number but still greater than zero (Lewis 1980). On\nthis view, the fault lies not with Regularity but with the standard\nversion of Probabilism, which needs to be relaxed to permit\ninfinitesimal credences. For worries about this appeal to\ninfinitesimals, see H\u00e1jek (2012) and Easwaran (2014). For a\nsurvey of infinitesimal credences/probabilities, see Wenmackers\n(2019).\n\nThe above response to the Coin Case implements a general strategy. The\nidea is that some doxastic states are so nuanced that even real\nnumbers are too coarse-grained to distinguish them, so real-valued\ncredences need to be supplemented with something else for a\nbetter representation of one\u2019s doxastic states. The above\nresponse proposes that the supplement be infinitesimal\ncredences. A second response proposes, instead, that the\nsupplement be comparative probability, with a very different\nresult: abandoning Regularity rather than saving it.\n\nThis second response can be developed as follows. While being assigned\na higher numerical credence implies being taken as more probable,\nbeing assigned the same numerical credence does not really imply being\ntaken as equally probable. That is, (real-valued) numerical credences\nactually do not have enough structure to represent everything there is\nin a qualitative ordering of comparative probability, as H\u00e1jek\n(2003) suggests. So, in the Coin Case, the contingent proposition\n\u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is assigned credence 0, the same\ncredence as a logical falsehood is assigned. But it does not mean that\nthose two propositions, one contingent and one self-contradictory,\nshould be taken as equally probable. Instead, the contingent\nproposition \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d should still be taken as\nmore probable than a logical falsehood. That is, the following norm\nstill holds:\n\n\nComparative Regularity. It ought to be that,\nwhenever one has a judgment of comparative probability between a\ncontingent proposition and a logical falsehood, the former is taken to\nbe more probable than the latter.\n\n\n\nSo, although the second response bites the bullet and abandons\nRegularity (due to the Coin Case), it manages to settle on a variant,\nComparative Regularity. But even Comparative Regularity can be\nchallenged: see T. Williamson (2007) for a putative counterexample.\nAnd see Haverkamp and Schulz (2012) for a reply in support of\nComparative Regularity.\n\nNote that the second response makes use of one\u2019s ordering of\ncomparative probability, which can be too nuanced to be fully captured\nby real-valued credences. As it turns out, such an ordering can still\nbe fully captured by real-valued conditional credences (as\nexplained in\n supplement B),\n provided that it makes sense for a person to have a credence in a\nproposition conditional on a zero-credence proposition. It is\nto this kind of conditional credence that I now turn.\n\n\n",
