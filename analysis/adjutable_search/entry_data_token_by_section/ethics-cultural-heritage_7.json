    "main_text": "Cultural Property || The Scope of Cultural Property Value\n2.2 The Scope of Cultural Property Value\n\nOne fundamental question about cultural property concerns who has a\nreasonable interest in it. Only members of a particular culture?\nMembers of a nation that many cultural members call home? All of\nhumanity? Insofar as legal institutions of property are meant to\nprotect our moral property interests, an answer to this question has\nthe potential to in turn shape legal norms governing cultural property\n(see entry on\n property and ownership).\n An influential approach in the cultural property literature is to\ndistinguish between cultural nationalist and cultural internationalist\npositions concerning how broadly a reasonable interest in cultural\nproperty should be construed (Merryman 1986).\n\nAccording to cultural internationalists, each particular culture\ncontributes to an overarching human culture, and thus everyone has an\ninterest in cultural property (Merryman 1986; this view is often\nlabeled \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d as well (Appiah 2006)). Proponents\nof cultural internationalism typically uses claims about the universal\nvalue of cultural heritage to argue against nationalist restrictions\non its export and sale, as well as against many repatriation claims\n(discussed further in\n section 3;\n Merryman 1986, 1994; Appiah 2006). This position finds support in\nvarious aspects of international law and policy, including the Hague\nConvention of 1954 (Merryman 1986) and the criterion of\n\u201coutstanding universal value\u201d in the 1972 UNESCO World\nHeritage Convention (Cleere 1996; Omland 2006). These claims about the\nuniversal evaluative scope of cultural property are often predicated\non a metaphysical claim about the constitutive relationship between\nparticular cultures and Human Culture: that it is precisely because\neach culture is a component of Human Culture that each individual\nculture therefore has a universal value in which everyone has a\nreasonable interest. However, even independently of the strength of\nthis claim, one might think that individual cultures can secure a\nuniversal value in other ways. For instance, according to one line of\nargument, there are a diversity of grounds for valuing a particular\nculture (such as ancestry, citizenship, geography, study, etc.) such\nthat most everyone could have a reasonable interest in a particular\nculture (Matthes 2015).\n\nAccording to the cultural nationalist position, on the other hand,\nnations have a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in their cultural\nproperty that \u201cimplies the attribution of national character to\nobjects\u201d (Merryman 1986: 832). This position also has support in\ninternational law and policy, in particular, the 1970 UNESCO\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit\nImport, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\n(Merryman 1986). Proponents of cultural nationalism typically use\nclaims about the special national character of cultural heritage to\nargue in favor of nationalist retention policies that restrict or\nlimit the export or sale of cultural heritage (discussed further in\n section 3.1.1;\n Moustakas 1989). It is worth noting that the dichotomy between\ncultural nationalists and internationalists faces a significant\nlimitation in that it does not leave an obvious place for the claims\nof intra-national cultural groups such as Native American tribes\n(Watkins 2005). Although cultural nationalism might in principle\naccount for the claims of sovereign indigenous nations, it has in\npractice focused on the interests of independent nation-states.\nMoreover, although indigenous cultural property claims have received\nincreasing attention in both policy and scholarship (discussed further\nin sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3),\n appeals to nationalist and internationalist claims remain common in\npractice, and indeed, the interests and claims of intra-national\ngroups can be in tension with the nationalist identity-building that\nnation-states often promote through cultural heritage (Watkins\n2005).\n\nOne way to read the dispute between cultural nationalists and\ninternationalists is as a dispute over which kind of value-claim\nshould be prioritized: a proponent of each position could recognize\nthe value claims made by both camps, but think that their own should\ntrump the other (Thompson 2003: 258). Alternatively, one might think\nthat claims about universal human value call into question the\napplicability of some of the traditional bundle of property rights.\nFor instance, one might argue that the universal value of cultural\nheritage entails that it should not be excludable in the manner that\nproperty typically is (Thompson 2004: 545\u2013546). Or, in a similar\nvein, one might argue that we should prioritize the preservation of\nsuch objects to the exclusion of any claims to holding them as\nproperty (Warren 1989: 22). This is a move toward a\n\u201cstewardship\u201d as opposed to \u201cownership\u201d model\nfor thinking about cultural property, which is subject to its own set\nof objections, and will be discussed below in\n section 2.4.\n",
