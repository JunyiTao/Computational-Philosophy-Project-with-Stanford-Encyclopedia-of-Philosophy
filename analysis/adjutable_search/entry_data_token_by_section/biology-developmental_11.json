Development and Evolution\n\nThe relationships that obtain between development and evolution are\ncomplicated and under ongoing investigation (for a review, see Love\n2015). Two main axes dominate within a loose conglomeration of\nresearch programs (Raff 2000; M\u00fcller 2007): (a) the evolution of\ndevelopment, or inquiry into the pattern and processes of how ontogeny\nvaries and changes over time; and, (b) the developmental basis of\nevolution, or inquiry into the causal impact of ontogenetic processes\non evolutionary trajectories\u2014both in terms of constraint and\nfacilitation. Two examples where the concepts and practices of\ndevelopmental and evolutionary biology intersect are treated here: the\nproblematic appeal to functional homology in developmental genetics\nthat is meant to underwrite evolutionary generalizations about\nontogeny\n (Section 5.1)\n and the tension between using normal stages for developmental\ninvestigation and determining the evolutionary significance of\nphenotypic plasticity\n (Section 5.2).\n These cases expose some of the philosophical issues inherent in how\ndevelopment and evolution can be related to one another.\n",
