    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content\n4. General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content\n\nIn the preceding section, we surveyed issues that face the philosopher\nattempting to work out the details of a causal theory of mental\ncontent. These issues are, therefore, one might say, internal to\ncausal theories. In this section, however, we shall review some of the\nobjections that have been brought forward to the very idea of a causal\ntheory of mental content. As such, these objections might be construed\nas external to the project of developing a causal theory of mental\ncontent. Some of these are coeval with causal theories and have been\naddressed in the literature, but some are relatively recent and have\nnot been discussed in the literature. The first objections, discussed\nin subsections 4.1\u20134.4, in one way or another push against the\nidea that all content could be explained by appeal to a causal theory,\nbut leave open the possibility that one or another causal theory might\nprovide sufficiency conditions for meaning. The last objections, those\ndiscussed in subsections 4.5\u20134.6 challenge the ability of causal\ntheories to provide even sufficiency conditions for mental\ncontent.\n",
