It\nstates that no two distinct things exactly resemble each other.  This\nis often referred to as \u2018Leibniz\u2019s Law\u2019 and is typically\nunderstood to mean that no two objects have exactly the same\nproperties. The Identity of Indiscernibles is of interest because it\nraises questions about the factors which individuate qualitatively\nidentical objects. Recent work on the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics suggests that the applicability of the principle in the\nquantum domain is controversial (see French 2019).\n", "toc": [{"#Form": "1.

The History of the Principle"}, {"#Bib": "Bibliography"}, {"#Aca": "Academic Tools"}, {"#Oth": "Other Internet Resources"}, {"#Rel": "Related Entries"}], "main_text": "\n1. Formulating the Principle\n\n\nThe Identity of Indiscernibles (hereafter called the Principle) is\nusually formulated as follows: if, for every property F,\nobject x has F if and only if object y has\nF, then x is identical to y. Or in the\nnotation of symbolic logic: \n\u2200F(Fx \u2194 Fy) \u2192\nx=y.\n\n\nThis formulation of the Principle is equivalent to the Dissimilarity\nof the Diverse as McTaggart called it, namely: if x and\ny are distinct then there is at least one property that\nx has and y does not, or vice versa.\n\n\nThe converse of the Principle, x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2194 Fy), is called the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals. Sometimes the conjunction of both\nprinciples, rather than the Principle by itself, is known as Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw.\n\n\nThus formulated, the actual truth of the Principle seems unproblematic\nfor medium-sized objects, such as rocks and trees, for they are\ncomplex enough to have distinguishing or individuating features, and\nhence may always be distinguished by some slight physical\ndifference. But fundamental principles are widely held to be\nnon-contingent. We might require, therefore, that the Principle should\nhold even for hypothetical cases of qualitatively identical medium\nsized objects (e.g., clones which, contrary to fact, really are\nmolecule for molecule replicas). In that case, we shall need to\ndistinguish such objects by their spatial relations to other objects\n(e.g., where they are on the surface of the planet). In that case the\nPrinciple is consistent with a universe in which there are three\nqualitatively identical spheres A, B, and C\nwhere B and C are 3 units apart, C\nand A are 4 units apart and A and B are 5\nunits apart. In such a universe, A\u2019s being 5 units from\nB distinguishes it from C, and A\u2019s\nbeing 4 units from C distinguishes it from B. The\nPrinciple often gets called into question, however, when we consider\nqualitatively identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Consider,\nfor instance, a perfectly symmetrical universe consisting solely of\nthree qualitatively identical spheres, A, B\nand C, each of which is the same distance, 2 units, away from\nthe others. In this case there seems to be no property which\ndistinguishes any of the spheres from any of the others. Some would\ndefend the Principle even in this case by claiming that there are\nproperties such as being that very object A. Call such a\nproperty a thisness or haecceity.\n\n\nThe possibility of resorting to thisnesses might make us query whether\nthe usual formulation of the Principle is correct. For as initially\nstated the Principle told us that no two substances exactly resemble\neach other. Yet if A and B otherwise exactly\nresemble each other then, on a common intuition, the fact\nthat A has the property\nbeing identical to A while B has the distinct\nproperty being identical to B cannot result in a respect in\nwhich A and B fail to resemble each other.\n\n\nRather than argue about these intuitions and hence argue as to which\nis the correct formulation of the Principle we may distinguish\ndifferent formulations, and then discuss which, if any, of these are\ncorrect. To that end a distinction is commonly made between\nintrinsic and extrinsic properties. Here it might\ninitially seem that extrinsic properties are those analysed in terms\nof some relation. But this is not correct. For the property being\ncomposed of two concentric spheres is intrinsic. For present\npurposes it suffices to have an intuitive grasp of the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction. (Or see Weatherson, 2008,\n\u00a72.1.)\n\n\nAnother useful distinction is between the pure and the\nimpure. A property is said to be impure if it is\nanalysed in terms of a relation with some particular substance (e.g.,\nbeing within a light year of the Sun). Otherwise it is\npure (e.g., being within a light year of a star).\nThose two examples are both of extrinsic properties, but some intrinsic\nproperties are impure, (e.g., being composed of the Earth and the\nMoon). According to my definitions all non-relational properties\nare pure.\n\n\nArmed with these distinction we may ask which properties are to be\nconsidered when we formulate the Principle. Of the various\npossibilities two seem to be of greatest interest. The Strong\nversion of the Principle restricts it to pure intrinsic properties, the\nWeak to pure properties. If we allow impure properties the\nPrinciple will be even weaker and, I would say, trivialised. For\ninstance in the three sphere example the impure properties being 2\nunits from B and being 2 units from C are possessed\nby A and only A, yet intuitively they do not prevent\nexact resemblance between A, B and C. (For\na different classification of principles, see Swinburne (1995.))\n\n\nSuppose we take identity to be a relation and analyse thisnesses as\nrelational properties, (So A\u2019s thisness is analysed\nas being identical to A). Then thisnesses will be impure but\nintrinsic. In that case the world consisting of the three\nqualitatively identical spheres 3, 4 and 5 units distance apart\nsatisfies the Weak but not the Strong Principle. And the world with\nthe three spheres each 2 units distance from the others satisfies\nneither version.\n\n\nA further distinction is whether the Principle concerns all items in\nthe ontology or it is restricted to just the category of\nsubstances (ie things which have properties and/or relations\nbut are not themselves properties and/or relations.) It is usually thus\nrestricted although Swinburne (1995) does consider, and defend, its\napplication to such abstract objects as integers, times and places,\nwithout explicitly treating these as substance.\n2. Ontological Implications\n\n\nMost formulations of the Principle carry a prima facie commitment to\nan ontology of properties, but nominalists of various kinds should\nhave little difficulty in providing suitable paraphrases to avoid this\ncommitment. (For instance, by using plural quantification. See Boolos\n1984, Linnebo 2009, \u00a72.1.) Most interesting in this context is\nthe way the Principle can be stated in terms of resemblance without\nany mention of properties at all. Thus the Strong Principle might be\nformulated as denying that distinct substances ever exactly resemble,\nand the Weak Principle as denying that distinct states of affairs ever\nexactly resemble. \n\n\nRussell (e.g., 1940, Chapter 6) held that a substance just is a bundle\nof universals themselves related by a special relation between\nproperties, known as compresence. If the universals in\nquestion are taken to be intrinsic properties, then Russell\u2019s theory\nimplies the Strong Principle. (At least it seems to imply it,\nbut see O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1995, Zimmerman 1997 and Rodriguez 2004.)\nAnd if the status of substances is non-contingent then it implies the\nnecessity of the Strong Principle. This is important because the most\nvulnerable version is clearly the Strong when it is held to be\nnon-contingent. (See also Armstrong 1989, Chapter 4.)\n3. Arguments for and against the Principle\n\n\n(i) The Principle appeals to empiricists. For how could we ever have\nempirical evidence for two indiscernible items? If we did, empiricists\nmight say, then they would have to be differently related to us.\nUnless we ourselves have exact replicas, which is implausible, we are\nthe unique beings with pure\nproperties X, Y, Z etc. Hence the\nempirically distinguishable objects have different pure properties,\nnamely, being related in different ways to the unique things\nwith X, Y, Z, etc. From this and the\nempiricist premiss that there are no things which are not empirically\ndistinguishable, we would conclude that the Weak Principle\nholds. Presumably the premiss would not be proposed as anything more\nthan contingently true. For there are possible situations in which\nthere would be theoretical reasons for believing in indiscernible\nitems as a consequence of a theory which best explains the empirical\ndata. Thus we might come to hold a theory of the origins of the\nphysical universe which had large amounts of empirical support, and\nwhich implied that, in addition to our enormously complicated\nuniverse, various simpler ones had been generated. For some of the\nsimplest universes this theory might imply that there were exact\nreplicas. In that case the Weak Principle would fail. \n\n\n(ii) If we ignore quantum mechanics, we might well conclude that not\nmerely the Weak Principle is contingently correct but even the Strong\nPrinciple. For unless we take space to be discrete, the classical\nmechanical situation would seem to be summed up by the Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrence theorem which tells us that typically we get arbitrarily\nclose to an exact repetition, but never get to one. (See Earman 1986,\np. 130.)\n\n\n(iii) Concerning the Weak Principle there has been an interesting\ndevelopment of a line of argument due to Black (1952) and Ayer (1954)\nin which it is proposed that there could be exact symmetry in the\nuniverse. In Black\u2019s example it is suggested that there could be a\nuniverse containing nothing but two exactly resembling spheres. In\nsuch a completely symmetrical universe the two spheres would be\nindiscernible. Against this has been noted, e.g., Hacking (1975), that\nsuch a completely symmetrical situation of two spheres could be\nre-interpreted as one sphere in a non-Euclidean space. So what might\nbe described as a journey from one sphere to a qualitatively identical\none 2 units apart could be redescribed as a journey around space back\nto the very same sphere. Quite generally it might be said that we may\nalways redescribe apparent counter-examples to the Weak Principle so\nthat qualitatively identical objects symmetrically situated are\ninterpreted as the very same object. This Identity Defence, as Hawley\n(2009) calls it, is vulnerable to a version Adam\u2019s continuity\nargument. (1979)\n\n\nA rejoinder to this is the continuity argument, essentially due to\nAdams (1979). It is granted that almost perfect symmetry is possible.\nFor there could be a space with nothing in it but a sequence of\nspheres arranged in a line at equal distance without any intrinsic\ndifference except that one of them is scratched. The identity defence\nis then committed to the counter-intuitive counterfactual \u201cIf\nthere had been no scratch on a sphere the shape of space would have\nbeen different\u201d. \n\n\nIn addition to this rejoinder, it should be noted that in only\nslightly more complicated examples the identification strategy is\nrather less persuasive than in the two sphere case. Consider the\nexample of three qualitatively identical spheres arranged in a line,\nwith the two outside ones the same distance from the middle one. The\nidentification strategy would first require the two outer ones to be\nidentified. But in that case there remain two qualitatively identical\nspheres, so these must in turn be identified. The upshot is that it is\nnot merely the two spheres we took to be indistinguishable that are\nsaid to be identical but all three, including the middle one which\nseemed clearly distinguished from the other two by means of a pure\nrelational property.\nAdams may be interpreted as providing two arguments, the first\nbeing the continuity argument used above. The second is a modal\nargument relying on the Necessity of Identity and a suitably strong\nmodal logic. Suppose there are two objects that are distinguished by\naccidental features, as it might be one of the spheres, A has\na scratch, while the other B does not. Then it is possible\nthat A has no scratch and hence possible that the spheres be\nindiscernible. If the Principle holds of necessity then that entails\nthat it is possible that A = B. But by the Necessity\nof Identity that in turn entails that it is possibly necessary\nthat A = B, so in S5 modal logic (or the\nweaker system B), it follows that A = B,\nwhich is absurd given that one has a scratch and the other does\nnot. In this argument any accidental difference would suffice in place\nof the scratch.\nIgnoring quantum mechanics we have, then, arguments that many find\npersuasive to show that both the Weak and the Strong Principle are\ncontingently true but neither are necessarily so. For the relevance of\nquantum mechanics, see French 2019.\n3.1 Recent Developments\nO\u2019Leary Hawthorne (1995) redescribes Black\u2019s example as\na single sphere with two locations. If we accept either of\nAdams\u2019 argument it follows that discernible spheres can be\nredescribed as a single sphere with two locations but with\nincompatible properties in the locations, which is seriously\ncounter-intuitive if not absurd (Hawley 2009 \u2014 see also her\nfurther criticisms.)\nAnother ingenious idea, suggested by Hawley, is that the two\nspheres be redescribed as a simple extended object, contrary to the\nintuition that a simple extended object must have a connected location\n(Markosian 1998). Once again, Adam\u2019s argument then implies that this\nredescription holds even of discernible objects of the same kind,\nthreatening us with the somewhat counter-intuitive monist thesis that\nthe universe is just one simple object. (For discussions of this\nlatter thesis, see Potrc and Horgan 2008 and Schaffer 2008,\n\u00a72.1.)\n3.2 Identical Collocated Spheres?\nDella Rocca invites us to consider the hypothesis that where we\nordinarily think there is a single sphere in fact there are many\nidentical collocated spheres, made up of precisely the same parts. (If\nthey were not made up of the same parts then the mass of the twenty\nspheres would be twenty times that of one sphere, resulting in an\nempirical difference between the twenty sphere hypothesis and the one\nsphere hypothesis.)  Intuitively this is absurd, and it is contrary to\nthe Principle, but he challenges those who reject the Principle to\nexplain why they reject the hypothesis. If they cannot, then this\nprovides a case for the Principle. He considers the response that the\nPrinciple should be accepted only in the following qualified form:\n There cannot be two or more indiscernible things with all\nthe same parts in precisely the same place at the same time (2005, 488)\n\nHe argues that this concedes the need to explain non-identity, in\nwhich case the Principle itself is required in the case of simple\nthings. Against Della Rocca, it may then be argued that for simples\n(things without parts) non-identity is a brute fact.  This is in\naccord with the plausible weakening of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason that restricts brute facts, even necessary ones, to the basic\nthings that depend on nothing further. \n3.3 The Third Grade Principle\nSuppose we grant the possibility of otherwise indiscernible objects\nthat are asymmetrically related. Then we have not just a\ncounterexample to the weak Principle, but an interesting further\nweakening to the Third Grade Principle, namely that in cases where the\nWeak Principle fails the otherwise indiscernible objects stand in a\nsymmetric but irreflexive relation \u2014 \u201cThird Grade\u201d\nbecause based on Quine\u2019s third grade of discrimination (1976). Recently\nSaunders has investigated this, noting that fermions but not bosons\nare third grade discriminable (2006).\nBlack\u2019s spheres are third grade discriminable because they stand in\nthe symmetric relation of being at least two miles apart, but this\nexample illustrates the objection that third grade discriminability\npresupposes non-identity (see French 2006).  For suppose we identify\nthe two spheres, treating space as cylindrical, then the geodesic\njoining the sphere would still be a geodesic and remain the same\nlength. So we could quite naturally say the sphere was at least two\nmiles from itself, unless we analyse that relation negatively as there\nbeing no path joining the spheres of less than two miles. But that\nnegative relation only holds in the Black case because the spheres are\nnot identified.\n4. The History of the Principle\n\n\nLeibniz prudently restricts the Principle to substances. Moreover,\nLeibniz is committed to saying that the extrinsic properties of\nsubstances supervene on the intrinsic ones, which collapses the\ndistinction between the strong and the Weak Principles. \n\n\nAlthough the details of Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics are debatable, the\nPrinciple would seem to follow from Leibniz\u2019s thesis of the\npriority of possibility. (See Leibniz\u2019s remarks on possible\nAdams in his 1686 letter to Arnauld, in Loemker 1969, p. 333.) It does\nnot appear to require the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which\nLeibniz sometimes bases it on. (See for example Section 21 of\nLeibniz\u2019s fifth paper in his correspondence with Clarke (Loemker\n1969, p. 699). See also Rodriguez-Pereyra 1999.) For Leibniz takes God\nto have created by actualising substances which already exist as\npossibilia. Hence there could only be indiscernible actual substances\nif there were indiscernible ones which were merely possible. Hence if\nthe Principle holds for merely possible substances it holds for actual\nones as well.  There is, therefore, no point in speculating as to\nwhether there might not be a sufficient reason to actualise two of a\npossible substance, for God cannot do that since both would have to be\nidentical to the one possible substance. The Principle restricted to\nmerely possible substances follows from Leibniz\u2019s identification\nof substances with complete concepts. For two complete concepts must\ndiffer in some conceptual respect and so be discernible.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, R.
