    "main_text": "Cognate Phenomena || Justification\n2.1 Justification\n\nSometimes we do things that appear to be morally wrong. Suppose I see\nyou, a total stranger, take a pear from a fruit stand and walk off\nwith it. I reproach you for having stolen the pear into which you are\nnow happily chomping. Yet you explain that you own that fruit stand\nand have not stolen anything. In giving this kind of explanation, you\nare offering a justification for your action\u2014you are claiming\nthat despite appearances to the contrary, your taking the pear was\nmorally permissible. Offering justifications is commonplace in our\nmoral lives. But justification and forgiveness ought to be\ndistinguished. When conduct is justified, this implies that the\nconduct was not morally wrong. But when conduct is forgiven, there is\nno such implication. Indeed, in most cases (if not all), what we are\nforgiven for are the morally wrong things we do. This is why it can be\noffensive when someone says that she forgives you when you have done\nnothing wrong.\n",
