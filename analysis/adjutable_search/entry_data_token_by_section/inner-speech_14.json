    "main_text": "Self-knowledge and Metacognition || Inferentialism\u2019s Critics\n5.3 Inferentialism\u2019s Critics\n\nSeveral philosophers object that inferentialist proposals leave us at\ntoo great an epistemic distance from our own thoughts (Bar-On &\nOchs 2018; Roessler 2016) or have other unworkable features\n(Langland-Hassan 2014; Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010;\nRoessler 2016). Roessler (2016) pursues a non-observational account of\nthe role of inner speech in generating self-knowledge. Rejecting the\nidea that we need to \u201ceavesdrop on ourselves\u201d by attending\nto our inner speech, Roessler suggests we follow remarks of Ryle (1949\n[2009]) and Anscombe (1957) in understanding the knowledge gained\nthrough inner speech as a kind of \u201cpractical knowledge\u201d,\n(or, for Ryle, \u201cserial knowledge\u201d), where knowing what one\nis thinking is understood as a special case of knowing what one is\ndoing.\n\nBar-On & Ochs (2018) likewise take aim at what they term\n\u201cNeo-Rylean\u201d invocations of inner speech, arguing that\nByrne\u2019s THINK rule fails to identify a special role for inner\nspeech in facilitating self-knowledge. Drawing on Bar-On\u2019s\n(2004) broader expressivist approach to self-knowledge, Bar-On and\nOchs hold that a proper account of inner speech\u2019s role in\nself-knowledge should show how such knowledge is \u201cdistinctive\nand uniquely first-personal\u201d in that it is\n\n\nknowledge that one can be said to have in virtue of being in a\nprivileged position to give direct voice to one\u2019s thoughts.\n(2018: 20)\n\n\nThey do not, however, develop a positive account in detail.\n\nVicente & Mart\u00ednez-Manrique (2005, 2008;\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010) have criticized\nBerm\u00fadez\u2019s and related inferentialist views on the\ngrounds that the semantics of natural language sentences\u2014and\ninner speech episodes, in particular\u2014are underdetermined in ways\nincompatible with providing knowledge of one\u2019s thoughts. For\ninstance, the sentence \u201cJane\u2019s cup is full\u201d, is\nambiguous in several ways, including the sense in which it is\nJane\u2019s cup (does she own it? is she just using it? is it the one\nshe merely wants?) and the sense in which it is full (is it full of\nair? of liquid? of coins?). If the explicit meaning of a sentence is\nonly extracted (and disambiguated) at the level of thought itself,\nthey argue, it is unclear how awareness of semantically indeterminate\ninner speech utterances could suffice for awareness of one\u2019s\nown\u2014presumably explicit and unambiguous\u2014propositional\nthoughts. Berm\u00fadez replies in his 2018 paper.\n\nJorba & Vicente (2014) and Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente\n(2015) criticize what they call the \u201cformat view\u201d of inner\nspeech (which they attribute to Jackendoff and others) which holds\nthat we are conscious of our inner speech episodes only because of\ntheir sensory format (see also Fern\u00e1ndez Castro 2016). If these\ncriticisms succeed, they cast doubt on views, such as those of\nCarruthers (2010), Jackendoff (1996), and Prinz (2012), which link the\nmetacognitive or introspective value of inner speech to its occurrence\nin a sensory format.\n\nLangland-Hassan (2014) raises a different sort of challenge for\ninferentialist views. Recall that it is a common assumption of those\nviews that propositional thought itself is amodal (i.e., non-sensory)\nand non-conscious. For theorists such as Carruthers, Prinz,\nJackendoff, and Berm\u00fadez, inner speech is a conscious mental\nprocess just because it has sensory features that render it the sort\nof state that is apt to be conscious. Langland-Hassan argues that\nthere is a conflict in holding that an episode of inner speech is a\nsingle mental state with both sensory features (relating to the\nrepresentation of phonemes) and semantic features (relating to the\nmeanings of the corresponding words). If this criticism is correct, it\ncreates problems for the proposal that inner speech is especially well\nsuited (due to its sensory character) to serve as input to inferences\nabout one\u2019s non-conscious mental states. Berm\u00fadez (2018),\nCarruthers (2018), and Munroe (2023) have articulated different ways\nof responding to this challenge (see also Prinz 2011 for relevant\nremarks).\n",
