    "main_text": "Truthmaker Accounts of Ontological Commitment || The Problem of Inessential Predication\n3.3 The Problem of Inessential Predication\nLet us begin an evaluation of the truthmaker account with a problem\nfor the truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to\nparticulars: the problem of inessential predication. Consider\nthe sentence \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019, and suppose that Socrates\nreally exists. (If not, switch to an inessential predication whose\nsubject is an entity that really exists.) Then it seems undeniable\nthat \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 is ontologically committed to\nSocrates. But, given truthmaker necessitarianism and the orthodox\nunderstanding of essential properties, Socrates will not be a\ntruthmaker for \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 on the truthmaker\naccount. Wisdom, presumably, is not an essential property of Socrates;\nand so Socrates' mere existence does not necessitate his being\nwise. But, then, the truthmaker account of ontological commitment for\nparticulars wrongly claims that \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019\nis not ontologically committed to Socrates. Note that this\nproblem doesn't arise for essential predications. Suppose,\nfor example, that Socrates is essentially human. Then Socrates' mere\nexistence necessitates his being human, and \u2018Socrates is\nhuman\u2019 has Socrates both as a truthmaker and as an ontological\ncommitment. But pointing this out only seems to make matters worse for\nthe truthmaker account: why should \u2018Socrates is human\u2019 but\nnot \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 be ontologically committed to\nSocrates? Essential and inessential predications should be treated on\na par with respect to ontological commitment.\nAn analog of the problem of inessential predication applies to the\ntruthmaker criterion of ontological commitment to kinds. Consider the\nsentence \u2018philosophers exist\u2019, and suppose that\nphilosophers really exist. Then it seems undeniable that\n\u2018philosophers exist\u2019 is ontologically committed to\nphilosophers. Presumably, however, philosophers are not essentially\nphilosophers. And so, given truthmaker necessitarianism, no\nphilosopher is a truthmaker for \u2018philosophers exist\u2019: any\nphilosopher is such that he or she could have existed in a\nphilosopher-less world. The truthmaker criterion for kinds, then,\nwrongly claims that \u2018philosophers exist\u2019 is not\nontologically committed to philosophers. Call this the problem of\ninessential generalization.\nDifferent accounts of truthmaking\u2014of which entities are\ntruthmakers, and what their essential properties are\u2014will lead\nto different responses. Since adequate responses appear to be\navailable to the truthmaker theorist, these responses are relegated to\nthe supplementary document.\n",
