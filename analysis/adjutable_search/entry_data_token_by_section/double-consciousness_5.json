    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || An Analytic Politico-Philosophic Reconstruction\n2.4 An Analytic Politico-Philosophic Reconstruction\n\nRobert Gooding-Williams develops a tripartite account of the concept\nof double-consciousness as a keystone in Du Bois\u2019s\npolitical-philosophical project in his In the Shadow of Du Bois:\nAfro-Modern Political Thought in America (2009).\nDouble-consciousness functions as part of an account of the subjective\nexperience of African-Americans in conditions dominated by Jim Crow\nand the \u201ccolor line\u201d; it serves as an essential component\nof Du Bois\u2019s critique of certain forms of black political\nleadership under those conditions; and it underwrites Du Bois\u2019s\nown positive theory of \u201cpolitical expressivism\u201d.\nGooding-Williams, like Allen, distinguishes double-consciousness from\nthe more general idea of \u201ctwo-ness\u201d that Du Bois connects\nit to, arguing also that \u201csecond sight\u201d is a distinctive\nfeature of Du Bois\u2019s conception.\n\nGooding-Williams emphasizes that Du Bois presents the concept in\nSouls in a passage that begins with the question, \u201cHow\ndoes it feel to be a problem?\u201d \u2013 a question which\nreferences the so-called \u201cNegro problem\u201d. This indicates\nan inward approach to the \u201csubjective\u201d felt experience of\n\u201cthe Negro\u201d, an approach relating double-consciousness to\n\u201csecond sight\u201d, which Du Bois characterizes as a\n\u201cgift\u201d in this American world. Gooding-Williams finds two\nsources for the idea of second sight \u2013 one in African-American\nfolklore, and one in the nineteenth-century literature on animal\nmagnetism. Both these present it as a capacity for a sort of\nextra-sensory perception (e.g., of ghosts) or a kind of vision into\nthe future \u2013 a capacity to see what is not generally visible.\nGooding-Williams argues that Du Bois uses \u201csecond sight\u201d\nto identify \u201cthe Negro\u2019s\u201d capacity to see himself\nthrough the eyes of white Americans. Because white Americans\nconstitute what Du Bois refers to as \u201cthe other world\u201d, a\nsocial group distinct from that of black folk, whites\u2019\nperceptions of and views about blacks would not \u201cnormally\u201d\nbe available to blacks, for Gooding-Williams; it is second sight that\ngives such access. In \u201cthis American world\u201d, however,\nwhites\u2019 perspectives on blacks are deeply distorted by racial\nprejudice. It is the \u201cgift\u201d of second sight, then, that\nmakes blacks\u2019 self-consciousness into a \u201cfalse\nself-consciousness\u201d, Gooding-Williams claims, by fostering in\nthem a self-concept molded by contempt and a presumption of\ninferiority.\n\nThus, Gooding-Williams presents double-consciousness as a \u201cfalse\nself-consciousness\u201d arising through second sight exercised in\nconditions of a racially prejudiced dominant culture. This false\nconsciousness can make way for a \u201ctrue self-consciousness\u201d\nonly when those conditions have been transformed and whites no longer\nperceive blacks as \u201ccontemptible\u201d or\n\u201cinferior\u201d (for only then will the Negro\u2019s\n\u201csecond sight\u201d reflect a perception of himself undistorted\nby prejudice). This eventuality, neither inevitable nor unattainable,\nrequires the achievement of reciprocal recognition that has been\ndenied the Negro by the white \u201cother world\u201d throughout\nAmerican history, and is a prime object of the Du Boisian political\nproject. That project\u2019s broader object \u2013 indeed, the goal\nof the history of African-American striving \u2013 is for black\nAmericans to be recognized as \u201cco-workers in the kingdom of\nculture\u201d. Gooding-Williams concludes that the overcoming of\ndouble-consciousness is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\nachievement of full equality: equality grounded in reciprocal\nrecognition cannot be won without eradicating the basis for\ndouble-consciousness.\n\nGooding-Williams argues that Du Bois was concerned with\ndouble-consciousness not only as a correlate of the disenfranchised\ncondition that constitutes the so-called Negro problem, but also as a\ncrucial test of the effectiveness of those leading the struggle to\novercome that condition. In his discussions of Booker T. Washington\nand Alexander Crummell (in chapters III and XII of Souls), Du\nBois makes a case that both fell victim to double-consciousness,\nvitiating their effectiveness as leaders of the freedom struggle.\nSpecifically, Washington\u2019s \u201cAtlanta Compromise\u201d was\na strategy that undermined the struggle for recognition, reinforcing\ndouble-consciousness by failing to challenge the white perception of\nNegro \u201cinferiority\u201d.\n",
