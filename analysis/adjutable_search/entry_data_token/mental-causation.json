Preliminaries\n1.1 The Importance of Mental Causation\n\nMental causation\u2014the mind\u2019s causal interaction with the\nworld, and in particular, its influence on behavior\u2014is central\nto our conception of ourselves as agents. Mind\u2013world interaction\nis taken for granted in everyday experience and in scientific\npractice. The pain you feel when you sprain your ankle causes you to\nopen the freezer in search of an ice pack. An intention to go to the\ncinema leads you to get into your car. Psychologists tell us that\nmental images enable us to navigate our surroundings intelligently.\nEconomists explain fluctuations in financial markets by citing\ntraders\u2019 beliefs about the price of oil next month. In each\ncase, a mental occurrence appears to produce a series of complex and\ncoordinated bodily motions that subsequently have additional\ndownstream effects in the physical world. Instances of apparent mental\ncausation are so common that they often go unremarked, but they are\ncentral to the commonsense picture we have of ourselves. It\u2019s\nnot surprising, then, that questions about the nature and possibility\nof mental causation arise in a variety of philosophical contexts.\n\nOntology: Suppose you accept the \u201cEleatic Principle\u201d that\npower is the mark of being: to exist is to have causal powers\n(Armstrong 1978, pp. 45\u20136; Oddie 1982). It\u2019s plausible to\nthink that if the mental has any causal powers at all, it can affect\nthe physical world. Without such powers, the mental faces ontological\nembarrassment, even elimination.\n\nMetaphysics: Mental causation is \u201cat the heart of the mind-body\nproblem\u201d (Shoemaker 2001, p. 74), often figuring explicitly in\nhow the problem is formulated (Mackie 1979; Campbell 1984; Crane\n1999). To ask how mind and body are related just is, in part, to ask\nhow they could possibly affect one another.\n\nMoral psychology: Agency of the sort required for\n free will\n and\n moral responsibility\n appears to require mental causation. If your behavior is not caused\nby your mind\u2019s activities\u2014its deliberations, decisions,\nand the like\u2014what sense would it make to hold you responsible\nfor what your body does? You would appear to be scarcely more than a\npassive observer of your body\u2019s activities. We would then need\nto abandon what\n Strawson\n (1962) calls our \u201creactive attitudes\u201d, the moral\nattitudes and feelings (e.g., gratitude, resentment) so central to our\ninterpersonal lives.\n\nAction theory: It is widely believed that psychological explanation\nhinges on the possibility of mental causation. If your mind and its\nstates, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from\nyour bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain\nwhat you do (Davidson 1963; Mele 1992; for dissent, see\n\u201cnoncausalists\u201d such as Ginet 1990; Sehon 2005; Tanney\n2013; and see the essays in D\u2019Oro 2013). These observations\nabout agency suggest a more basic conceptual point: if minds did not\ninfluence behavior, in what sense would anyone truly act?\nSounds would be made, but no one would mean anything by them. Bodies\nwould move, but no one would thereby do anything (Malcolm 1968; Horgan\n2007).\n\nAlthough each of the above points could be contested, collectively\nthey create pressure to address the problem of mental\ncausation\u2014problem or problems: as will become clear,\nthere is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind\u2019s\ncausal efficacy can arise.\n1.2 Is This an Empirical Issue?\n\nAt least since\n Hume,\n philosophers have assumed that causal questions are largely\nempirical. We look to science to tell us, for example, the\nmoon\u2019s role in causing the tides, or smoking\u2019s\ncontribution to lung cancer: these are not considered philosophical\nquestions. It might seem equally obvious that the mind\u2019s causal\nrole in producing behavior is also a matter for science to settle. So\nis it in fact the case that working scientists, and in particular,\npsychologists, find it necessary to appeal to distinctively mental\nphenomena to account for behavior? Is there evidence in neuroscience\nthat mental states and processes figure in the production of\nactions?\n\nAlthough most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal\ninteraction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of\nempirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some\nversion of\n epiphenomenalism,\n the thesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings,\nexert no efficacy in return. Wegner, a psychologist, contends that\naccumulated empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports\nepiphenomenalism, at least with respect to conscious willing (Wegner\n2002, 2004). He draws on influential work by Libet (1985, 2001, 2004)\nand others to argue that conscious intending is itself a product of\nnonconscious processes that do the real causal work, so that free will\nis \u201can illusion\u201d. If Wegner and his colleagues are right,\nthese results could have ancillary implications for the physical\nefficacy of mental states generally. (Note, that some dualists (e.g.\nLowe 2006; Gibb 2013) have appealed to the same work by Libet to\ndefend their own non-traditional models of psychophysical causation).\n\n\nBecause this research has received extensive treatment in recent work\non free will, we will not consider it further, but instead refer\ninterested readers to the sources cited above and to Mele 2014 for\ncritical discussion and references. Here we simply note that\ntraditional and contemporary attempts to assess the efficacy of mental\nstates have run up against philosophical difficulties as well,\ndifficulties that tend to overshadow the experimental evidence\naccumulated thus far. In this sense, the efficacy of mind is quite\nunlike that of, say, the moon or smoking. This will, we hope, become\nclear in the discussion to follow.\n2. The Problem of Interaction\n\nSome historians (e.g., Matson 1966; King 2007) say the mind-body\nproblem is relatively recent, the most important source being\n Descartes\u2019s\n \u201creal distinction\u201d between mind and body. That said, you\ncan find topics closely related to mental causation in, for example,\nPlato\u2019s Phaedo and Aristotle\u2019s De Anima,\nand it might turn out that many features of the contemporary debate\nare present in some form or other in pre-modern texts (Caston 1997).\nSkirting such historical questions, we begin with Descartes, who, for\nbetter or worse, set the agenda for modern discussions of mental\ncausation. The cluster of causal problems arising from the Cartesian\nconception of mind is The Problem of Interaction.\n2.1 What is the Mind-Body Nexus?\n\nAccording to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of thing,\nor, in the technical terminology of the day, distinct kinds of\nsubstance. Bodies, he held, are spatially extended\nsubstances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are\nunextended, thinking, feeling substances: souls. (We use\n\u201csoul\u201d with no theological implications to designate minds\nconsidered in the Cartesian way as immaterial substances.) Despite\nrecognizing these deep differences, Descartes accepted the common\nbelief that mind and body causally interact: \u201cEveryone feels\nthat he is a single person with both body and thought so related by\nnature that the thought can move the body and feel the things which\nhappen to it\u201d (in Cottingham et al. 1991, p. 228). But if minds\nand bodies are so radically different, it is not easy to see how they\ncould interact. Descartes was well aware of the difficulty.\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia puts it forcefully to him in a 1643\nletter, pressing Descartes to tell her\n\nhow the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in\nthe body so as to perform voluntary acts\u2014being as it is merely a\nconscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to\ncome about from the moving body\u2019s being propelled\u2014to\ndepend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or\nagain, on the nature and shape of this latter thing\u2019s surface.\nNow the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves\nthat the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude\nextension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me\nincompatible with a thing\u2019s being immaterial (in Anscombe and\nGeach 1954, pp. 274\u20135).\n\n\nElisabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how\ncausation of bodies works: it must involve the cause\u2019s impelling\nthe body, where this requires contact between cause and effect. Since\na soul could never come into contact with a body\u2014souls have no\nspatial location\u2014an immaterial soul could never impel, and so\ncould never causally interact with, a body.\n\nElisabeth\u2019s worries might seem quaint and outdated. Causal\nrelations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms,\nnot all of which are of the push-pull variety. Why shouldn\u2019t\nsoul\u2013body interaction simply be included as another sort of\n\u201cnon-mechanistic\u201d causation (Richardson 1982)? But\nElisabeth\u2019s objection is in fact just one version of a more\ngeneral worry about soul\u2013body interaction, a worry that rests on\nthe following thesis about causation:\n\n(CN)  Any causal\nrelation requires a nexus, some interface by means of which\ncause and effect are connected.\n\n\nElisabeth presumes that when an effect is bodily motion, the required\nnexus is spatial contact. But even if she is wrong about this (Garber\n1983), (CN) nevertheless poses problems for the dualist: if contact is\nnot the mind\u2013body nexus, what is?\n\nOne line of thought appeals to the transference theory of causality.\nHere the idea is that identity\u2014the persistence of something from\ncause to effect\u2014provides the needed link. If something in a soul\ncould become present in a body, this could bridge the immaterial and\nmaterial. Descartes himself appears to accept such a theory, declaring\nin the Third Meditation that there could be nothing in an effect not\npresent in its total efficient cause (Descartes 1642/1996, p. 28). But\nnow the problem reasserts itself: if, as the substance dualist\ninsists, bodies and minds are radically different, they have no\nproperties in common. According to Descartes, a body\u2019s\nproperties are modes of extension, ways of being extended, while a\nsoul\u2019s properties are modes of something quite different,\nthought or consciousness. If causation involved transference, a\nCartesian soul could not interact with a body (but see Hart 1988;\nHoffman and Rosenkrantz 1991).\n\nDoes a dualist need to accept (CN), however? The notion of a causal\nnexus has come under criticism, often from philosophers working in the\nHumean tradition (Blackburn 1990). More generally, (CN) and kindred\nprinciples might be thought to rest on a conception of causality that\nis now obsolete, finding no place in modern physics (for further\ndiscussion, see\n the metaphysics of causation,\n \u00a72). But the next three versions of the problem can arise even\nfor those who reject the need for a causal nexus.\n2.2 The Pairing Problem\n\nA second version of the Problem of Interaction is the \u201cPairing\nProblem\u201d (Kim 1973, 2005; Sosa 1984; Foster 1991, ch. 6).\nImagine two exactly similar minds M1 and\nM2 and the bodies B1 and\nB2 to which they are \u201cattached\u201d, that\nis, the bodies with which they directly interact. In virtue of what is\nM1 causally paired with B1,\nand M2 with B2?\n\nThis is not the epistemological question of how we could know that\nthese are the pairings (although this is troublesome, too). The\nquestion, rather, is metaphysical: in virtue of what are these the\npairings? If minds were, like bodies, located in space, causal pairing\ncould be achieved by the relative spatial locations of the substances\n(Bailey et al. 2011). Particular minds might be inside or\n\u201cinhabit\u201d particular bodies. But if minds are non-spatial\nsouls, relative spatial location is unavailable to fill the pairing\nrole. And since M1 and M2 are,\nby hypothesis, exactly similar, we cannot appeal to the different\nintrinsic properties that they might possess.\n\nIn reply, a dualist could appeal to \u201cindividualistic\u201d\npowers (Unger 2006, pp. 242\u201359; Foster 1991, pp. 167\u20138).\nPowers are standardly thought of as powers to interact with some\ntype of object. A key has the power to open this lock, but\nonly by virtue of having the power to open any lock of this kind, the\npower to open any intrinsically comparable lock. Individualistic\npowers, in contrast, are powers possessed by an object to affect or be\naffected by a particular object. Think of a key with the\npower to open this lock, but without the power to open any\nintrinsically indiscernible lock. Likewise, a soul could have the\npower to interact with a particular body and no other. As the key\nexample suggests, however, it is by no means obvious that powers could\nbe individualistic in this sense (but see Audi 2011).\n2.3 Conservation Laws\n\nA third version of the Problem of Interaction appeals to conservation\nlaws. The leading idea is simple: Soul\u2013body interaction would\nhave to change the amount of energy in the physical universe. When\nsouls act, new energy would appear in, say, the brain. When souls are\nacted upon, some quantity of energy in the brain would vanish. But\neither scenario would contravene established conservation laws, which\npermit only the conversion and redistribution of energy (or\nmass\u2013energy) within the physical universe, not its addition or\nsubtraction.\n\nThis version of the problem has dogged dualism since the scientific\nrevolution (Lowe 1992; Papineau 2000), and a number of contemporary\nphilosophers present conservation as a major obstacle for dualists\n(Fodor 1981; Dennett 1991, p. 35; Heil 2012, p. 26; Papineau 2000).\nThat said, turning the leading idea into a compelling argument has\nproven difficult. First, the conservation laws do not dictate what\nkinds of energy exist, only that they must operate conservatively.\nHence, if sui generis mental energy existed, as long as it\noperated conservatively, this would be consistent with the\nconservation laws. Appealing to this fact, Hart (1988) advances a\nsubstance dualism and, combining it with a transference theory of\ncausation (\u00a72.1), argues that psychophysical causation consists\nin the transfer of such psychic energy. (For arguments against the\nexistence of sui generis mental energy, see Papineau 2000).\nSecondly, what is needed is a conservation law weak enough to have\nbeen confirmed by physical science, but strong enough to preclude\nsoul\u2013body interaction. Averill and Keating (1981) consider a\nnumber of candidate \u201claws\u201d and argue that none meets both\ncriteria. Thirdly, it\u2019s not clear in any case that a soul would\nhave to add energy to (or receive it from) the brain in order to\ninteract with it. Broad (1925, pp. 103\u20139) suggests a soul could\nact merely by redistributing the brain\u2019s energy without changing\nits quantity. Furthermore, Lowe (2000) and Gibb (2013) both advance\ndualist models of psychophysical causation according to which the\nmental does not affect the brain either by affecting the amount of\nenergy in it or by redistributing it. (For more recent discussion of\nthese and other complexities, see Montero 2006; Koksvik 2007; Gibb\n2010.)\n2.4 The Completeness of the Physical\n\nA fourth version of the Problem of Interaction is related to the\nthird, but, because it is more prominent in the contemporary\nliterature, especially in some of the \u201cproperty-based\u201d\nproblems we examine below, we will develop this last version at\ngreater length. The first premise is:\n\nThe Completeness of the Physical: Every physical effect has a\nsufficient physical cause.\n\nWhen you trace the causal history of any physical effect\u2014that\nis, of anything physical that has a cause\u2014you will never need to\nappeal to anything non-physical. The physical universe contains within\nitself the resources for a full causal explanation of any of its\n(caused) elements, and in this sense is \u201ccomplete\u201d. The\npoint applies, then, to whatever might occur to or within our bodies.\nAny instance of bodily behavior has a sufficient physical cause, which\nitself has a sufficient physical cause, and so on. In tracing the\ncausal history of what we do, we need never appeal to anything\nnon-physical.\n\nThis principle appears frequently in the mental causation literature\nunder a number of labels: most common are variations of\nCompleteness of the Physical (Crane 1995, 2001; Papineau\n1993, 2000; O\u2019Connor and Churchill 2010) or Physical\nClosure (Crane 1992; Baker 1993; Melnyk 2003; Kim 2005).\nWe\u2019ll call it Completeness for short.\n\nLabels aside, several versions of the premise appear in the\nliterature, and they can differ in strength. Note that the principle\nas formulated says nothing about whether the non-physical can affect\nthe physical; a strengthened version prohibits this. (Closure\nis sometimes reserved for this stronger principle: LePore and Loewer\n1987; Kim 1998, p. 40; Marcus 2005; compare Strong Causal\nClosure in Montero 2003.) An even more ambitious version blocks\nthe non-physical from being cause or effect; such is\nsuggested in Davidson\u2019s work (see \u00a75.1 and McLaughlin 1989,\nwho uses Physical Comprehensiveness for this thesis.) As for\nweaker versions, Completeness could be limited to physical\neffects within the human body without affecting its relevance to the\ncurrent topic. Note also that the principle is apparently committed to\ndeterministic physical causation; a weakened version permits\nprobabilistic causes. (For complications with such a weakening, see\nMontero 2003, and for other challenges with formulating\nCompleteness, Lowe 2000; Gibb 2015.)\n\nFor simplicity, we stay with the principle as formulated at the\noutset. Why think that it\u2019s true? Perhaps it is a conceptual\ntruth: for an effect to be physical is, at least in part, for it to\nhave a physical cause. This defense turns on the proper analysis of\nthe concept physical, itself the subject of a contentious\nliterature (see\n physicalism).\n Here we simply note that the principle does not seem analytic; it\nappears to be a substantive, empirical claim about the causal\nstructure of the universe. (For more on the conceptual defense, see\nCrane 1991; Papineau 1991, 1993, \u00a71.9; Lowe 1996, p. 56.)\n\nIt\u2019s natural, then, to look to science for a defense, and\nespecially physics (or physiology). Appeals to \u201ccurrent physical\ntheory\u201d (Antony and Levine 1997, p. 100), \u201cthe development\nof the sciences\u201d (LePore and Loewer 1987, p. 630), and\n\u201cphysics textbooks\u201d (Melnyk 2003, p. 289) are common, but\nwhat exactly in physical science supports the premise? An appeal to\nthe conservation laws (2.3) might be thought to generate one such\nargument. Another argument is the no-gap argument. (See, for example\nMelnyk 2003, pp. 288\u201390; Papineau 1993, pp. 31\u201332).\nPhysics has been hugely successful in identifying the causes of\nvarious kinds of physical event. To do so physicists have only needed\nto appeal to physical events. Not once have they had to appeal to\nsui generis mental events. Without doubt the causal account\nthat physics provides of physical events contains gaps. But the\ncrucial point is that is highly unlikely that physics will ever need\nto appeal to sui generis mental causes to fill these\ngaps\u2014or so proponents of the no-gap argument claim. A similar\nno-gap argument can be presented at the level of neurophysiology.\n(See, for example, Melnyk 2003, p.187).\n\nWe will look at challenges to Completeness in a moment, but\nnote for now that the premise by itself does not preclude the efficacy\nof souls. Even if every physical effect has a sufficient physical\ncause, some physical effects might have non-physical causes as well.\nThis latest version of the Problem of Interaction thus requires a\nsecond premise:\n\nNo Overdetermination: There is no systematic\noverdetermination of physical effects.\n\nThis principle enjoys wide support in the literature. It is said that\npostulating systematic overdetermination in this context is\n\u201cabsurd\u201d (Kim 1993a, p. 281), one of the\n\u201cnonstarters\u201d in the mental causation debate (Kim 1998, p.\n65). But why? Perhaps it just looks like bad engineering (Schiffer\n1987, p. 148). Or maybe the problem is that it would involve an\n\u201cintolerable coincidence\u201d (Melnyk 2003, p. 291): every\ntime you act, there are two independent causal processes\u2014one\nfrom your brain, another from your soul\u2014converging on the same\neffect.\n\nWith the two premises now in place, the Problem of Interaction in our\nfinal version is straightforward. Assume for reductio that\nour souls routinely cause behavior. By Completeness, such\neffects also have sufficient physical causes, so behavior is\nsystematically overdetermined. But this contradicts No\nOverdetermination. The dualist\u2019s options would then seem to\nbe severely limited. One is to embrace epiphenomenalism, a doctrine on\nwhich the mental, while caused by the physical, exerts no\n\u201cdownward\u201d causal influence in return. A more radical\noption, parallelism, depicts bodies and souls as running in tandem,\nwith no causal influence in either direction.\n\nThe two premises can, however, be challenged. Start with\nCompleteness. Baker (1993), not herself a Cartesian dualist,\nargues that if the principle threatens to undermine our ordinary (and\nscientific) explanatory practices\u2014many of which cite the\nmental\u2014it\u2019s Completeness that has to go.\nEntrenched explanatory practices trump any abstract metaphysical\nprinciples with which they might conflict (see also \u00a7\u00a76.3,\n7.5). Others argue that physical science, far from supporting the\nprinciple, may in fact undermine it. Hendry (2006) finds indications\nof \u201cdownward causation\u201d in chemistry, while Stapp (2005)\nculls evidence from contemporary physics suggesting that there are,\ncontrary to Completeness, causal gaps in the physical world,\ngaps filled in by the mental (see also Sturgeon 1998; Davies 2006).\nEmergentists in general deny the principle, either on scientific\ngrounds or by appeal to our conscious experiences of agency (see\n emergent properties,\n esp. \u00a74). And although the death of emergentism has been\ndeclared more than once on empirical grounds (McLaughlin 1992;\nPapineau 2000), the view continues to attract philosophers and\nscientists. (See Wilson 2021 and the contributions to Clayton and\nDavies 2006; Bedau and Humphreys 2008; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010;\nPaoletti and Orilia 2017; and Gibb, Hendry and Lancaster 2019.)\n\nNo Overdetermination has been targeted as well. Mills (1996),\nfor example, defends mental\u2013physical overdetermination as the\nmost plausible route for the dualist to take. Overdetermination is\nplausible, the reasoning goes, if for any behavioral effect\nB, both a non-physical (mental) cause M and physical\ncause P satisfy the following counterfactual conditionals\n(among others):\n\nIf M had occurred in the absence of P,\nB would still have occurred.\nIf P had occurred in the absence of M,\nB would still have occurred.\n\n\nIf the dualist can reasonably claim that (1) and (2) are true, this\nwill make a strong prima facie case for overdetermination.\nAlong different lines, Lowe (2003) presents a model of dualist\ninteraction on which, owing to systematic mind\u2013body\ndependencies, overdetermination is not the intolerable coincidence\nworrying opponents of dualism. And more generally, the ban on\nsystematic overdetermination has come under increased scrutiny in the\ncontext of the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in \u00a76.\n3. The Ascent to Properties\n\nCartesian dualism has fallen out of favor among philosophers and\ncognitive scientists. There are, to be sure, non-Cartesian forms of\nsubstance dualism that might have the resources to confront the\nProblem of Interaction in its various guises (Hasker 1999; Lowe 2006).\nBut the dominant view today would appear to be that if the mind is a\nsubstance at all, it is a physical substance\u2014the brain, for\ninstance. This sort of \u201csubstance monism\u201d is in fact a\nconsequence of the more general token identity theory: every concrete\nmental particular (token) is physical. We will assume token identity\nin what follows: minds, mental events, and any other mental\n\u201cobjects\u201d are physical (see\n the mind/brain identity theory).\n\nWhat becomes of the Problem of Interaction on such a view? It would\nseem to dissolve. While causation between brain and body is complex,\neven to the point of being empirically inscrutable, it does not pose\nthe same problems as soul\u2013body interaction. There are no special\nphilosophical problems with brain\u2013body interaction, nor is there\nanything especially odd or worrisome about an event in your brain\ncausing, say, your arm to go up. Any philosophical questions here\nbelong to\n the metaphysics of causation\n generally and have no special application to mental causation.\n\nNevertheless, philosophical worries about mental causation persist.\nTheoretical and commonsensical considerations leading us to think the\nmind or mental events cause behavior should also make us think that\nthey do so as mental, i.e., in virtue of their mental\n properties.\n Properties figure in causal relations (Kim 1973; Mackie 1974, ch. 10;\nArmstrong 1989, pp. 28\u20139; Ehring 1997). Drop a square\npaperweight into soft clay and it will produce an impression. The\nshape of the impression can be traced to the shape of the paperweight,\nthe depth of the impression to the mass of the paperweight. Here shape\nand mass are \u201ccausally relevant\u201d or \u201ccausally\nefficacious\u201d properties. In particular, they are relevant to\ncertain properties of the impression. By contrast, other properties of\nthe paperweight, such as its color or value, appear to be irrelevant\nto producing this kind of impression. Or consider a soprano who sings\na high note, thereby shattering a glass. The sound, we can suppose,\nhas a meaning\u2014a semantic property\u2014but it is the\nsound\u2019s acoustic properties that are operative in producing the\nshattering; the semantic properties play no causal role, at least not\nwith respect to this effect (Dretske 1989).\n\nBy themselves, these observations pose no special problem for the\nphilosopher of mind. While the notion of a causally relevant property\ncalls for analysis (Horgan 1989; Dardis 1993; Braun 1995), there is no\nreason at the outset for a token-identity theorist to be especially\nconcerned about the efficacy of mental properties. Gus smiles because\nof the way his food tastes, that phenomenal property; Lilian walks to\nschool along a particular route because of what she believes, that\nrepresentational property. Assuming the mind is something physical,\nwhy should a mind\u2019s causing behavior in virtue of its mental\nproperties be any more puzzling than a paperweight\u2019s causing a\nsquare impression in virtue of its shape?\n\nRecent philosophical work on mental properties has revealed that\nmatters are not so simple, however. Mental properties are alleged to\nhave, not just one, but up to four features that make their efficacy\nphilosophically puzzling, no less problematic than mind\u2013body\ninteraction is for the Cartesian dualist. These features will be\ndiscussed in the following sections. Each feature makes it appear as\nthough mental properties, or some important family of them, are\nirrelevant to the production of behavior. The threat is a form of\nepiphenomenalism: even if minds and mental events are causes, they are\nnot causes as (or qua) mental.\n4. Problem I: Property Dualism\n\nThis \u201cnew epiphenomenalism\u201d (Campbell 1984, ch. 7)\nimmediately confronts a particularly strong version of\n property dualism,\n one insisting that mental properties are sui generis,\nperhaps dependent on, but in no way reducible to the dispositional and\nstructural properties recognized by the physical sciences. Some\nproperty dualists accord this status only to a certain class of mental\nproperty, namely\n qualia,\n the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d features of conscious\nexperience. Other property dualists, including some\n emergentists,\n are willing to extend the thesis to all mental properties.\n\nSuppose that this robust form of property dualism is true. Can mental\nsubstances or events cause what they do qua mental, in virtue\nof their mental properties? The arguments against soul\u2013body\ninteraction, now couched in terms of properties, could enter again\nhere. For example, if you were worried about the mind\u2013body nexus\nfor souls (\u00a72.1), it seems you should also wonder how\nnon-physical properties can find any traction in the physical world.\nSimilarly, Completeness (\u00a72.4) seems to lose none of its\nattractiveness when formulated explicitly in terms of properties. You\ncould add to the principle a clause stipulating that a\n\u201csufficient physical cause\u201d is one that\u2019s sufficient\nin virtue of its physical properties (see also \u00a75.4). Bring in\nNo Overdetermination, and the efficacy of mental properties\nis again threatened. The arguments here and the responses to it are\nstructurally similar to those in \u00a72, so we will not pursue\nfurther this version of the property-based problem. (Property dualism\nalso faces the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in \u00a76.)\n5. Problem II: Anomalous Monism\n\nAnother version of the property-based problem of mental causation can\nbe traced to\n Davidson\u2019s\n influential paper, \u201cMental Events\u201d (Davidson 1970). There\nDavidson defends an account of the mind\u2013body relation he calls\n \u201canomalous monism\u201d,\n a view that at first appears to save mental causation, but in the end\nmight deny efficacy to mental properties.\n5.1 The Argument for Anomalous Monism\n\nAt the core of anomalous monism are three principles:\n\n\nPrinciple of Causal Interaction: Some mental events interact\ncausally with physical events.\n\nPrinciple of the Nomological Character of Causality: Events\nrelated as cause and effect fall under strict laws.\n\nAnomalism of the Mental: There are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can be predicted and explained.\n\n\nAccording to Davidson, the apparent tension among these principles\ngives rise to the mind\u2013body problem. Most of us unquestioningly\nassent to the first principle. The second is more controversial,\nalthough Davidson provides little argument for it. Here we just note\nthat it\u2019s not as strong as it seems, for \u201cstrict\u201d is\nnot synonymous with \u201cdeterministic\u201d. A strict law is\nexceptionless, but could be either deterministic or probabilistic.\n\nThe third principle is the most contested of the three. It rules out\nstrict laws in psychology; in particular\u2014and most importantly\nfor present concerns\u2014it rules out strict psychophysical laws,\nthat is, laws connecting the mental and physical. According to\nDavidson, application conditions for mental predicates feature a\nrationality constraint absent from the application conditions for\nphysical predicates. In ascribing beliefs to others, for instance, we\nemploy a principle of charity that counsels us to make these believers\nas rational as possible. But this normative constraint has, as\nDavidson puts it, \u201cno echo\u201d in the physical realm. In this\nregard, mental and physical predicates are misaligned in a way that\nprecludes strict psychophysical laws.\n\nNow the second two principles seem to rule out the first. If causation\nrequires strict laws, and there are no strict psychophysical laws, how\ncan the mental be causally efficacious? But Davidson notes there is a\nway to save the first principle: as long as every mental event is\nphysical, the first principle is compatible with the other two. In\nthis way, the three principles entail event monism. At the\nsame time, Davidson\u2019s view entails type dualism, for\nthe anomalism of the mental (the third principle) precludes identities\nbetween mental and physical types. Most philosophers find it natural\nto say that types are properties, so Davidson is sometimes described\nas a property dualist, a convenient label for the time being (but see\n\u00a75.5).\n5.2 The Charge of Epiphenomenalism\n\nDavidson\u2019s property dualism, and the principle that lies behind\nit, have led to a serious charge: anomalous monism robs mental\nproperties of any causal significance.\n\nSuppose Gus decides to illuminate the room and subsequently flips a\nswitch, thereby turning on the light. In this case we have a cause\nthat, if Davidson is right, could be given both a mental and a\nphysical description, and an effect that has a physical description.\nIf this means that the cause has a mental property (in virtue of which\nit satisfies a mental description) and a physical property (in virtue\nof which it satisfies a physical description), we are faced with a\nfurther question. Granting that the event with the mental property\nis the event with a physical property, why should we think\nthat the mental property had anything at all to do with the\nevent\u2019s physical effect? Davidson\u2019s second two principles\nappear to block such relevance. If all causal relations are subsumed\nunder strict laws, and if there are no strict psychophysical laws,\nthen any instance of mind\u2013body causation is subsumed only by\nphysical laws. But then it looks as though only a mental event\u2019s\nphysical properties are relevant to what it causes. The mental\nproperties (or mental types) are causally irrelevant (see, e.g.,\nStoutland 1980; Honderich 1982; Sosa 1984; a review of this literature\nis in McLaughlin 1989).\n5.3 Counterfactual Dependence\n\nLePore and Loewer (1987) look to counterfactuals to answer this charge\n(see also Horgan 1989; LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990; Loewer\n2007). The central idea is that anomalous monism permits physical\neffects to depend counterfactually on mental properties. And such\ndependence secures an important kind of causal relevance for the\nmental, the sort that LePore and Loewer call \u201cbringing\nabout\u201d. On their view, a\u2019s being F\nbrings about b\u2019s being G when the following\nconditions are met:\n\na causes b.\na is F and b is G.\nIf a had not been F, b would not have\nbeen G.\na\u2019s being F and b\u2019s being\nG are logically and metaphysically independent.\n\n\nNow suppose a mental event, such as a decision to turn on the light,\ncauses Gus to move his finger, thereby flipping the light switch. Here\nthe crucial counterfactual is: If the cause had not been a decision to\nturn on the light, the effect would not have been a switch-flipping.\nThis is plausible, as are similar counterfactuals in a wide range of\ncases. But are such counterfactuals compatible with anomalous monism?\nLePore and Loewer say Yes: while Davidson prohibits strict\nlaws connecting mental and physical properties, he apparently leaves\nroom for non-strict laws. Such laws are enough to ground or\n\u201csupport\u201d counterfactuals. Consider, by analogy, the\nproperties of being a match-striking and being a\nmatch-lighting. If there is a law connecting such properties, it\nis evidently non-strict: striking causes lighting only ceteris\nparibus. Nevertheless, we can assert with confidence, after a\ngiven lighting, that if the match had not been struck, it\nwouldn\u2019t have lit. Non-strict psychophysical laws would\nsimilarly appear to ground counterfactuals connecting mental and\nbehavioral properties.\n\nThis counterfactual defense is attractive for a number of reasons. It\ncaptures a sense in which mental properties make a difference to\nbehavior, but in a way that\u2019s apparently compatible with\nanomalous monism. It respects our causal intuitions about a wide range\nof cases. And it fits well with the more general\n counterfactual theory of causation,\n which many philosophers have found independently plausible. Moreover,\nDavidson himself seems sympathetic to the defense (Davidson 1993; but\nsee \u00a75.5).\n\nIn spite of these advantages, a worry is that the pertinent\ncounterfactuals don\u2019t after all ensure causal relevance, and in\nthis sense don\u2019t vindicate anomalous monism. This objection can\ntake the form of direct counterexamples (Braun 1995; Garrett 1999),\nbut here we look at a broader concern.\n\nWhen a counterfactual is true, there should be something in the world\nthat makes it true. Even granting that, if the cause had not had its\nmental property, the effect would not have had its behavioral\nproperty, in virtue of what is this true? This truthmaker, not the\ncounterfactual itself, is what matters in determining whether a\nproperty is causally relevant. And the worry is that once we look at\nthe truthmakers in the mental case, the threat of epiphenomenalism\ncrops up again. Although the effect counterfactually depends on the\nmental property, this is only because the mental property depends on a\nphysical property doing the real work. The mental property looks like\na freeloader (Kim 1998, pp. 70\u20133, 2007; compare Crane 2008 on a\nsimilar issue).\n\nLePore and Loewer discuss a version of this worry. Condition (3), an\nobjector might say, is too crude to test for causal relevance, for the\ncounterfactual holds only because removing F from a\nalso removes some other property F* of a, and\nit\u2019s the absence of F* that\u2019s responsible for\nb\u2019s not being G. A better counterfactual test\nevaluates the effect\u2019s status given that a is not\nF and all of a\u2019s other\nproperties\u2014or at least all that are potential causal rivals to\nF\u2014are held fixed. If b is not G in\nthat case, only then can we credit F with causal relevance.\nBut mental properties fail this more refined test. Consider again\nGus\u2019s decision to turn on the light, and remove its mental\nproperty, this time holding fixed its physical properties. It seems\nclear that he would still flip the switch. After all, the physical\nproperties of the cause figure in an exceptionless law according to\nDavidson. It looks as if the physical properties of your decision\n\u201cscreen off\u201d the mental property, making the latter\nirrelevant.\n\nLePore and Loewer concede that mental properties are screened off by\nphysical properties. But they argue that this more refined test is too\ndemanding, for it would also mean that the physical properties of a\nmental cause are irrelevant. Note in particular that the\ndecision\u2019s mental properties screen off its physical properties:\nif the cause had lacked its physical properties yet had still been a\ndecision to turn on the light, it would have caused Gus to flip the\nswitch (ceteris paribus: here a hedged law, which anomalous\nmonism permits, is in play). Screening off thus goes both ways, and\nsince few would want to deny causal relevance to the physical\nproperties, we should not let screening off impugn the significance of\nmental properties either.\n\nAntony (1991) replies that there is no symmetry here, at least not\ngiven anomalous monism. While the decision\u2019s physical properties\nscreen off its mental properties, the reverse doesn\u2019t hold.\nSuppose again that the cause had lacked its physical properties but\nhad still been a decision to turn on the light. On anomalous monism,\nAntony argues, there\u2019s no saying what Gus\u2019s decision would\nhave caused, for mental properties, being anomalous, place no\nconstraints on the causal structure of the world. (See also Leiter and\nMiller 1994.)\n\nThe freeloader problem arises in a variety of contexts in the mental\ncausation literature, not just in discussions of anomalous monism. It\nwill return under a number of guises in what follows.\n5.4 Lawful Sufficiency\n\nFodor (1989) apparently agrees that counterfactuals capture a kind of\ncausal relevance, but he argues that LePore and Loewer have settled\nfor too little. On Fodor\u2019s view, mental properties can be\nrelevant to behavior in a stronger sense in which they are\nsufficient for their effects and in this way \u201cmake a\ndifference\u201d. Fodor spells out sufficiency in terms of laws: a\nproperty makes a difference if \u201cit\u2019s a property in virtue\nof the instantiation of which the occurrence of one event is\nnomologically sufficient for the occurrence of another\u201d (Fodor\n1989, p. 65, note omitted).\n\nMight such an account save anomalous monism from the charge of\nepiphenomenalism? On the face of it, it cannot, for as we\u2019ve\nnoted, mental properties on Davidson\u2019s view appear only in\nhedged laws, laws that include an implicit ceteris paribus\nrider. Consider a candidate psychological law:\n\n(L)  If an agent,\na, wants x, believes x is obtainable by\ndoing y, and judges y best, all things considered,\nthen a forms the intention to y and subsequently\ny\u2019s on the basis of this intention, ceteris\nparibus. \n\n\nThe ceteris paribus clause here would seem to block the\nmental properties in question from being causally sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. But perhaps not: according to (L), the mental\nproperties are sufficient for the behavioral effect when the\nceteris paribus conditions are satisfied. And this sort of\ncausal sufficiency, Fodor argues, is all anyone could reasonably want\nfor mental properties.\n\nBut can Davidson help himself to such an account? Davidson appears to\nthink so (1993, p. 10), as does McLaughlin (1989), who also appeals to\nhedged laws. Fodor, however, doubts his account is compatible with\nanomalous monism; such doubts are developed by Antony (1991) and Kim\n(1993b). The question turns largely on Davidson\u2019s reasons for\nthinking the mental is anomalous, and on whether these reasons permit\nhim to appeal to hedged laws in the way the laws account requires.\n\nSupposing anomalous monism is compatible with Fodor\u2019s account,\nyou might still wonder whether nomological sufficiency is enough for\ncausal relevance. An account of causal relevance in terms of laws is\nnatural given the tight connections between laws and properties (see\n laws of nature,\n \u00a73). But those sympathetic to Fodor\u2019s position might still\nask (as Fodor himself does) what the causal mechanism is in\nmental\u2013physical interactions. For example, it could turn out\nthat the reason psychophysical laws such as (L) hold is that mental\nproperties are themselves grounded in more basic, physical properties,\nand that only the latter do genuine causal work: mental properties\nagain look like freeloaders (\u00a75.3), merely piggybacking on the\nreal bearers of causal powers (LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990;\nLeiter and Miller 1994; Marras 2003).\n5.5 The Ascent to Properties Reconsidered\n\nDavidson replies to his critics in \u201cThinking Causes\u201d\n(Davidson 1993). In that paper he sometimes speaks favorably of\n\u201ccausally efficacious\u201d properties, and he helps himself to\nboth hedged laws and counterfactuals to secure the efficacy of mental\nproperties. But his considered position appears less conciliatory. He\nclearly denies a crucial assumption of his critics, namely, that\ncauses do their causing in virtue of their properties. When an event\ncauses something, it doesn\u2019t do so qua this or that: it\njust causes what it does, full stop. Were this so, none of the\nproperty-based problems discussed here could get off the ground (Crane\n1995; Campbell 1997; Gibb 2006).\n\nSuch a response seems to miss the point (Kim 1993b; McLaughlin 1993;\nSosa 1993). All parties in this dispute agree that mental events can\ncause physical events. The difficulty is to understand how they could\ndo so in virtue of their mental (rather than their physical)\nproperties, how they could have physical effects qua mental.\nThe principle of the Nomological Character of Causation (\u00a75.1)\napparently requires that, when one event causes another, it does so in\nsolely virtue of its physical properties.\n\nBut Davidson is part of a\n nominalist\n tradition that rejects properties, at least as his critics conceive\nof them. Davidson instead formulates anomalous monism in terms of\npredicates and descriptions. An event is mental if it answers to a\nmental predicate (that is, it can be picked out using a mental\ndescription), physical if it answers to a physical predicate (it can\nbe referred to using a physical description). Davidson\u2019s critics\nassume that if an event answers to both sorts of predicate, it\nincludes a mental property and a physical property. But Davidson\nthinks about the mental\u2013physical distinction as merely a\ndifference in description, not as the expression of an ontological\ndivide between kinds of property. For Davidson, then, it makes no more\nsense to ask whether an event had a particular effect in virtue of\nbeing mental or in virtue of being physical than it would to ask\nwhether its effect stemmed from its being described in English or in\nGerman. (For further discussion, see Heil 2009.)\n6. Problem III: Exclusion\n\nWhile reflection on property dualism or anomalous monism can lead to\nour next property-based problem, another route is by way of the\ndoctrine of\n non-reductive physicalism.\n Like the property dualist, the non-reductive physicalist holds that\nmental properties are not physical. But unlike the property dualist,\nthe non-reductive physicalist insists on a strong dependence of the\nmental on the physical: mental properties are \u201crealized\u201d\nor \u201cconstituted\u201d by physical properties. This strong tie\nbetween the mental and physical is the subject of a large contemporary\nliterature, some of which we touch on below.\n6.1 Functionalism and Multiple Realizability\n\nNon-reductive physicalism in its current form grew out of\n functionalism,\n according to which mental properties are functional properties. To be\nin pain, for example, is a matter of being in a state with a certain\ncausal profile, a state that\u2019s caused by tissue damage, and\ncauses certain overt responses (moans, attempts to repair the damage)\nas well as other mental states (e.g., beliefs that one is in pain).\nBut, argue functionalists, it is most unlikely that we could identify\na single kind of physical state playing this role in every actual and\npossible case of pain. Human beings differ in endless tiny\nphysiological ways: your neurological states, including states you go\ninto when you are in pain, probably differ subtly from another\nperson\u2019s. Human beings\u2019 neurological states, in turn,\ndiffer from those of a cat or a dog, and perhaps dramatically from\nstates of an octopus. You might even imagine encountering aliens with\nvastly different biologies, but to which you would unhesitatingly\nascribe pains.\n\nHere we arrive at a core thesis of functionalism: states of mind are\n \u201cmultiply realizable\u201d.\n The property of being in pain can be realized in a wide variety of\nphysical (and perhaps non-physical) systems. A creature is in pain in\nvirtue of being in a state with the right sort of causal profile, some\nsort of neurological state, say. But the property of being in pain\ncannot be identified with this neurological state, because creatures\nof other kinds can be in pain in virtue of being in vastly different\nphysical conditions. Functionalists often put this point by saying\nthat mental properties are \u201chigher-level\u201d properties,\nproperties possessed by objects by virtue of their possession of\nappropriate \u201clower-level\u201d properties, their realizers.\n6.2 The Exclusion Problem\n\nNow, however, we are again confronted with the threat of\nepiphenomenalism. If mental properties are not physical, how\ncould they make a causal difference? Whenever any mental\n(functional) property M is instantiated, it will be realized\nby some particular physical property P. This physical\nproperty is unproblematically relevant to producing various behavioral\neffects. But then what causal work is left for M to do? It\nseems to be causally idle, \u201cexcluded\u201d by the work of\nP.\n\nThis version of the problem of mental causation has appeared in\nvarious guises. Much of the contemporary literature is inspired by\nMalcolm 1968, especially as refined in Kim 1989, 1993c, 1998, 2005.\nWhatever its precise formulation (cp. Shapiro and Sober 2007;\nO\u2019Connor and Churchill 2010; historical perspective is in\nPatterson 2005), the Exclusion Problem has clear affinities with the\nother problems we\u2019ve looked at so far. Consider our claim that\nthe realizing property P must play a role in producing a\nparticular behavioral effect. This would seem to be justified either\nby an appeal to Completeness (\u00a72.4) or to\nDavidson\u2019s doctrine (\u00a75.1) that causal relations must fall\nunder strict (and so physical) laws. Moreover, the argument\u2019s\ndepiction of P and M as competing for causal\nrelevance\u2014one must exclude the other\u2014would seem to require\na principle such as No Overdetermination (\u00a72.4). And the\nfundamental worry that P might exclude M looks\nexactly like the freeloader problem that badgers mainstream attempts\nto save anomalous monism (\u00a7\u00a75.3\u20134).\n\nIn spite of these similarities, the Exclusion Problem is in one\nimportant respect unique: unlike the problems we\u2019ve looked at so\nfar, exclusion worries generalize to a wide range of phenomena outside\nof the mental. Any properties, mental or otherwise, that are multiply\nrealizable in physical systems are threatened with causal irrelevance.\n(For discussion of this and related issues, see Kim 1998, pp.\n77\u201387; Noordhof 1999; Bontly 2001; Gillett and Rives 2001; Block\n2003; Walter 2008.)\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Fodor 1989; Baker 1993; Shapiro 2010) take\nthis general nature of the problem to be an encouraging sign.\nWe happily accept biological, or meteorological, or geological\nproperties as causally significant despite their being distinct from\ntheir physical realizers. Why then imagine that exclusion threatens\nthe efficacy of mental properties? Others turn this argument around,\ninsisting that the alleged efficacy of biological and other\n\u201cspecial science\u201d properties is by no means sacrosanct\n(Antony 1995). Causal powers we attribute to them must respect what\nour best metaphysics tells us. And in any case, the central issue is\nnot so much whether mental properties (and the rest) are\ncausally relevant to the production of physical effects, but\nhow they could be (Kim 1998, pp. 61\u20132,\n78\u20139; Antony and Levine 1997, p. 96; McLaughlin 2006). Even if\nthe Exclusion Problem, because it generalizes, does not tempt us to\nembrace epiphenomenalism, it presses on us a responsibility to explain\nhow mental properties could play a causal role given that they appear\nto be screened off by their physical realizers.\n\nThe Exclusion Problem is the subject of a large and still-growing\nliterature. In the next few sub-sections, we look at some of the main\nlines of response, dividing them into three broad categories.\n6.3 Autonomy Solutions\n\nThe Exclusion Problem presents us with a picture on which higher-level\nmental properties compete with their lower-level physical realizers.\nPhysical properties are unproblematically relevant in the production\nof behavior, and so mental properties must either find a way to do the\nwork that their realizers are already doing or face exclusion. But\nsome philosophers would insist that this picture is deeply misleading:\nmental properties enjoy causal relevance in their own right and are\nnot threatened by exclusion from physical properties.\n\nThis \u201cautonomy solution\u201d (Jackson 1996, \u00a72) can take\na variety of forms. One version starts by observing that psychological\nexplanations\u2014and more generally, explanations in the special\nsciences\u2014are in an important sense independent of physical\nexplanations. Psychological explanations typically abstract away from\ndetails of lower-level implementation, appealing instead to their own\ndistinctive kinds and laws. Explanations in the special sciences can\nthus proceed independently of those in the lower-level physical\nsciences. If the structure of the causal order reflects these\nexplanatory practices, mental properties need not be threatened by\nexclusion. Mental and physical causes can peacefully coexist.\n(Variations on this theme appear in Dennett 1973; Baker 1993; Van\nGulick 1993; Garrett 1998; Hardcastle 1998; Marcus 2001; Menzies 2003;\nRaymont 2003; Ross and Spurrett 2004; Woodward 2008; Zhong 2014; see\nalso \u00a77.5.)\n\nThis appeal to explanation can naturally lead to (though it does not\nentail) another autonomy solution, the dual explanandum\nstrategy. The Exclusion Problem presents a mental (functional)\nproperty M and its physical realizer P as competing\nto be causally relevant to the same effect, namely a bit of behavior.\nBut M might not be threatened with exclusion if M\nand P are causally relevant to different properties of the\neffect. Return for a moment to the paperweight example from \u00a73.\nThe shape of the paperweight is relevant, not to the impression\nsimpliciter, but to the impression\u2019s shape. In\ngeneral, a causally relevant property is relevant to some particular\nproperty of the effect (Horgan 1989). Perhaps, then, M and\nP do not causally compete because they are parts of separate,\nautonomous causal lines to different properties of the effect.\n\nConsider one way this might work. Behavioral properties, just like\nmental properties, appear to be multiply realizable. For example,\nthere is more than one way to hail a cab, many different physical\nrealizations of this kind of behavior. Now suppose a belief causes you\nto hail a cab. In accordance with Completeness, some physical\nproperty P of the belief is sufficient for your behavior. But\nstrictly speaking, P is relevant only to the particular\nway in which you hailed the cab, the particular physical\nrealization of your hailing. What, then, is responsible for your\nbehavior\u2019s higher-level property of simply being a\ncab-hailing? It\u2019s natural to suppose that it\u2019s a\nhigher-level property of your belief, namely, some mental property,\nsuch as the belief\u2019s representational content. (For proposals\nalong these lines, see Yablo 1992; Thomasson 1998; Marras 1998; Crisp\nand Warfield 2001; Gibbons 2006; Schlosser 2009; see also\n\u00a7\u00a77.3\u20134.)\n\nA strength of autonomy solutions is that they secure a causal role for\nmental properties without running afoul of Completeness, as\nthe physical realization of behavior is always matched with some\nphysical properties of its cause. But do autonomy solutions respect\nNo Overdetermination? Here matters are not as\nstraightforward. Autonomy solutions present us with two properties,\nP and M, each sufficient for the behavioral effect.\nIt might seem as if the dual explanandum strategy avoids this\nawkwardness, since P and M are relevant to different\nproperties of the effect. But even here, overdetermination threatens,\nas the effect\u2019s behavioral property is produced twice: directly\nby M, and indirectly by P, which produces the\nbehavioral property\u2019s physical realizer, which itself\nnecessitates the behavioral property.\n\nProponents of autonomy solutions might grant these points but claim\nthat such \u201coverdetermination\u201d is innocuous, far from the\n\u201cintolerable coincidence\u201d threatening Cartesian dualist\naccounts of mental causation (\u00a72.4), for the two causal lines\npresent are not independent. (The nature of overdetermination has\nitself become the subject of a literature inspired, in part, by the\nExclusion Problem. See, e.g., Funkhouser 2002; Bennett 2003; Sider\n2003; Walter 2008; Carey 2011; Bernstein 2016; Kroedel 2019.)\n6.4 Inheritance Solutions\n\nAutonomy solutions can make it appear that the causal powers of mental\nproperties \u201cfloat free\u201d of their physical realizers,\nbringing to mind the doctrine of parallelism (for replies, see\nThomasson 1998; Marcus 2001, \u00a73.3). Some non-reductive\nphysicalists have accordingly looked to tie the causal powers of\nmental properties more closely to those of their physical realizers.\nThe idea is that mental properties are so intimately related to their\nrealizers that the former \u201cinherit\u201d the causal powers of\nthe latter. The relation between levels is not one of rivalry, such\nthat the physical might exclude the mental, but one of cooperation.\nNor, moreover, does there seem to be any threat of overdetermination,\nsince the mental works through the physical. (Compare the\nmetaphor of \u201ctransparency\u201d in Jackson 1996.)\n\nOn some versions of the inheritance solution, what the higher-level\nmental property derives from its physical realizer is some weaker or\n\u201clower-grade\u201d form of causal relevance. For example,\nJackson and Pettit (1988, 1990) distinguish the robust \u201ccausal\nefficacy\u201d of physical properties from the weaker \u201ccausal\nrelevance\u201d of higher-level properties. Causal relevance in this\nsense is an explanatory notion: as one might put it, behavior is\nproduced at the physical level, but by being realized in the\nphysical, mental properties inherit an explanatory relevance they\nwouldn\u2019t have otherwise. An advantage of such a view is that it\naccords a derived form of relevance to mental properties, but in a way\nthat respects both the priority of physical causation embodied in\nCompleteness as well as the principle of No\nOverdetermination. (For similar views, see Kim 1984; Levine 2001,\n\u00a71.5; Segal 2009. Those who appeal to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior on the mental [\u00a75.3] might also fall into\nthis category. For an answer to the charge that counterfactual\ndependence is \u201ccausation lite\u201d, see Loewer 2007, Menzies\n2007.)\n\nIf such a weakening seems to amount to epiphenomenalism, you might\nlook for an inheritance solution on which mental properties are\nefficacious in the same sense that their physical realizers are\n(compare the \u201chomogeneity assumption\u201d in Crane 1995). How\ncan this be done without violating No Overdetermination?\nWell, suppose that a mental property is, in spite of being distinct\nfrom its physical realizer, immanent in this realizer;\nM, that is, is somehow nothing over and above P. In\nthat case, any causal work done by P is, in a straightforward\nway, inherited by M. Overdetermination is avoided because\nM\u2019s work is included in P\u2019s.\n\nThe metaphysical details of such a picture matter. Otherwise,\n\u201cimmanence\u201d, \u201cnothing over and above\u201d, and the\nlike will turn into mere labels for that psychophysical relation, we\nknow not what, that solves the Exclusion Problem. Accordingly, several\npromising lines of inquiry have been pursued. Mental and physical\nproperties are said to be related by, for example, the\ndeterminable\u2013determinate relation (Yablo 1992; critics include\nEhring 1996; Worley 1997; Funkhouser 2006), constitution (Pereboom\n2002; critics include Ney 2007; Heil 2011), metaphysical necessitation\n(Bennett 2003, 2008), physical explicability (Antony 1991), physical\nimplementation (Marras 2003), and grounding (Kroedel and Schulz\n2016).\n\nYou might ask why any of these relations should secure the desired\nsolution. One thought is that if mental properties are immanent in\ntheir physical realizers, the causal powers of a mental property are\nincluded among those of its realizer. Consider again mental property\nM and one of its realizers in a given instance, P.\nPlausibly, M\u2019s powers are included in\nP\u2019s. Both properties, for example, have the power to\ncause a certain kind of behavior, but because of its greater\n\u201cspecificity\u201d, P has in addition to this powers\nthat M lacks. Now in general we don\u2019t think that wholes\ncausally compete with, or are excluded by, their parts. When Gus steps\non Lilian\u2019s toe, his foot\u2019s causing Lilian discomfort\ndoesn\u2019t exclude Gus\u2019s causing her discomfort. Both Gus and\nhis foot coexist as causes, without competition and, we might add,\nwithout overdetermination. A similar point could be made about\nproperties: if the causal powers of M are included in those\nbestowed by P, then P\u2019s causal relevance to\nbehavior, far from excluding M\u2019s, includes it.\n(Approaches along these lines have been developed in Antony 1999;\nShoemaker 2001, 2007; Wilson 1999, 2011; Clapp 2001; critical\ndiscussions include Heil 1999, 2011; McLaughlin 2007; Kim 2010; Ney\n2010; Audi 2012.)\n6.5 Identity Solutions\n\nAutonomy and inheritance solutions grant at least this much to the\nExclusion Problem: mental and physical properties are numerically\ndistinct, however intimately they are otherwise related. But a third\nsort of strategy tries to undermine the argument at exactly this\npoint: any mental property just is its physical realizer. If\nM=P, there\u2019s no question of one\u2019s\nexcluding the other, nor is there any mystery of how M can\nwork through P, for M and P are one and the\nsame.\n\nThis sort of psychophysical property identity would seem to be blocked\nby the multiple realizability argument sketched earlier. But that\nargument, in spite of its wide appeal, has come under attack from\nseveral directions (see\n multiple realizability,\n \u00a72). For example, some (Kim 1992; Lewis 1994; Jackson 1995; Heil\n2003) take the argument to show, not that mental properties are\ndistinct from their physical realizers, but that what we thought was\none kind of mental property is actually many. Pains realized by\ndifferent physical properties, in spite of having the same\nname (\u201cpain\u201d), are different, though similar,\nmental properties. There is no such property as pain\nsimpliciter, only pain-for-this-physical-structure and\npain-for-that-physical structure. Once such\n\u201cstructure-specific\u201d identities are allowed, we can say\nthat M (now just, say, pain-for-human beings) is identical\nwith P, M\u2019s \u201crealizer\u201d in human\nbeings (replies include Fodor 1997; Block 1997; Marras 2003; Moore and\nCampbell 2010).\n\nThis solution comes at a price: it forces us to abandon the belief\nthat pain is a single, natural kind. There is, however, a way to\npreserve this doctrine while pursuing a strategy that\u2019s\notherwise similar to the one just sketched. The essential idea is that\n\u201cproperty\u201d as we\u2019ve used the term so far is\nambiguous. A property could be what characterizes an object (event),\nor what unifies several objects as a \u201cone across many\u201d.\nNow suppose the characterizing properties are\n tropes:\n particularized properties, unique to each object. And suppose the\nunifying properties are something else\u2014call these\n\u201ctypes\u201d. If the mental \u201cproperties\u201d that are\ncausally relevant to behavior are tropes, and the mental\n\u201cproperties\u201d mentioned in the multiple realizability\nargument are types, there\u2019s no reason to think that this\nargument rules out psychophysical property-identities in any way that\nleads to exclusion worries. The M-trope and the\nP-trope are one and the same trope falling under two types,\nmental and physical. This proposal allows for a single type\npain shared by diverse creatures; it\u2019s just that this\ntype is not the same sort of entity (a trope) that\u2019s efficacious\nin the production of behavior (Heil 1992; Robb 1997; Heil and Robb\n2003; what appears to be a similar view is defended by Macdonald and\nMacdonald 1986, 1995a; see also Whittle 2007.)\n\nOne worry about this proposal is that it appears to raise the\nExclusion Problem all over again, this time at the level of properties\n(tropes). If a single property is both mental and physical,\nCompleteness and No Overdetermination force us to\nsay that it\u2019s efficacious only qua physical, not\nqua mental. (For this and other criticisms, see Noordhof\n1998; Raymont 2001; Gibb 2004; Macdonald and Macdonald 2006; Alward\n2008; Maurin 2008; see Robb 2013 for some replies.)\n6.6 Necessary Effects: A Deeper Problem for Functionalism?\n\nFunctionalism, along with any non-reductive theory of mind, faces the\nproblem just discussed. But even if exclusionary worries are finessed,\nfunctionalism faces an additional and possibly more fundamental\nproblem.\n\nAs we noted earlier, functionalism characterizes states of mind\ncausally. To be in a given mental state is to be in a state with the\nright sort of causal profile, a state bearing the right sorts of\nrelation to other states. Think of functional states as nodes in a\nnetwork of states, the identity of which depends on the relations they\nbear to other nodes, and think of the realizers as occupants of these\nnodes. All there is to a node is the potential causal relations it\nbears to other nodes (not so for the occupants, which have intrinsic\nproperties). Suppose, then, that F and G are\nfunctional properties\u2014nodes in this network\u2014and that all\nthere is to something\u2019s being F is its being a\nG-causer. The resulting generalization, \u201cFs\ncause Gs\u201d, is no doubt true, but it is vacuous,\nequivalent to the generalization that G-causers cause\nGs.\n\nThis appears to strip functional properties of their causal efficacy.\nWhy? One line of thought appeals to Hume\u2019s celebrated doctrine\nthat there can be no necessary connections between distinct\nexistences. A mental property and its would-be effect are distinct,\nyet functionalism entails that they enjoy a necessary connection. On\nthe Humean doctrine, such a connection could not be causal. Another,\nclosely related, version of the problem requires that causal relations\nbe subsumed by empirical laws. But there are no such laws available\nfor functional properties if all of the relevant generalizations are\nanalytic and vacuous. (The foregoing argument in either version\nthreatens to generalize to all dispositional properties: see\n  dispositions,\n \u00a76. For the problem aimed at functionalism in particular, see\nBlock 1990; Rupert 2006;\n functionalism,\n \u00a75.2.)\n\nThis argument echoes the logical connection argument advanced\nin the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s against causal accounts of action\n(e.g., Melden 1961, pp. 52\u20133). Given that reasons (desires,\nintentions) are not logically distinct from the actions they\nrationalize, reasons could not cause actions. In response, Davidson\n(1963) noted that logical connections hold among predicates or\ndescriptions of events, not among events themselves. A cause could be\ndescribed in various ways, some of which will involve the effect:\nconsider \u201cthe cause of the fire caused the fire\u201d. This is\nhardly informative, but it\u2019s not thereby false. And of course\nthe statement, far from precluding a causal relation, explicitly\nasserts it. That said, if the claim is true, it should be possible to\nidentify the cause of the fire independently of reference to the\neffect\u2014as \u201cthe match\u2019s igniting\u201d, for\ninstance. In defense of his own causal theory of action, Davidson\nargued that such a re-description of mental causes is always\navailable, at least in principle (see \u00a75.1).\n\nBut Davidson\u2019s saving move appears not to be available for the\nfunctionalist, for in the case of functional states and properties, no\nsuch independent descriptions are available, as the nature of a\nfunctional property is exhausted by its place in the causal\nnetwork.\n\nThe functionalist has a number of options available, some of them\nmirroring solutions to the Exclusion Problem (Rupert 2006 provides a\ncritical survey). For example, a functionalist could settle for a\nweaker, explanatory role for functional properties, leaving causal\nefficacy to the realizers of functional states (\u00a76.4; see, e.g.,\nSegal 2009; compare Roth and Cummins 2014). Or a functionalist might\nidentify states of mind with their realizers (\u00a76.5); indeed, some\nof the early functionalists were identity theorists (Lewis 1966, 1994;\nArmstrong 1968/1993). This would permit the sort of re-description\nthat the more mainstream version of functionalism apparently blocks. A\nthird option is to look for non-vacuous, empirical generalizations\nsubsuming functional properties (Antony and Levine 1997). Yet a fourth\noption rejects the Humean doctrine, permitting necessary connections\nbetween a causally efficacious property and its effect. Such a\nproposal would find a home in the more general \u201ccausal theory of\nproperties\u201d defended by Shoemaker (1980, 1998) and others.\n7. Problem IV: Externalism\n\nOur final version of the property-based problem is restricted to\nintentional mental properties, that is, properties in virtue of which\nsome mental states\u2014propositional attitudes, perceptual\nexperiences, mental images, and so on\u2014are about something,\nproperties in virtue of which mental states have representational\ncontent. We assume here that\n externalism\n is true, so that the contents of representational states of mind\ndepend, not merely on intrinsic features of those states, but on\nrelations, in particular, on the causal, social, and historical\nrelations agents bear to their surroundings. In the simplest case,\nLilian is thinking about water (H2O) because she\nstands in the right sorts of causal relation to water. The key move\nhere is to reject the idea that meaningful objects or states owe their\nmeaning to their intrinsic make-up alone.\n7.1 How Could Content Make a Causal Difference?\n\nThe causally problematic feature for externalism is this contextual or\nrelational component of representational mental states. Suppose that\nour mental representations are physical structures in the brain. Now\nsuppose with the externalist that the content of these representations\nis determined, not just by our intrinsic features, but by context as\nwell. Lilian (or Lilian\u2019s brain) represents a tree in the quad\nby going into state T. But T represents a tree in\nthe quad, not by virtue of T\u2019s (or, for that matter,\nLilian\u2019s) intrinsic makeup, but by virtue of T\u2019s\n(and by extension Lilian\u2019s) standing in the right kind of\nrelation to the tree. The very same kind of state in a different\ncontext (in the brain of someone in different circumstances) might\nrepresent something very different\u2014or nothing at all.\n\nNow if the content of Lilian\u2019s thought that there is a tree in\nthe quad is \u201cbroad\u201d, if the significance of her thought\ndepends on factors outside Lilian\u2019s body, then it is indeed hard\nto see how this content could figure in a causal account of her\nactions, including Lilian\u2019s expressing her belief that there is\na tree in the quad by uttering the sentence, \u201cThere is a tree in\nthe quad\u201d. This is bad news for any attempt to explain why we do\nwhat we do by reference to the contents of our thoughts.\n\nConsider an analogy (Dretske 1998). Gus inserts a quarter into a\nvending machine. The coin has a range of intrinsic qualities common to\nquarters, but its being a quarter does not depend solely on these\nintrinsic qualities: a quarter\u2019s intrinsic qualities would be\nshared by a decent counterfeit. The coin\u2019s being a quarter\ndepends on its having the right sort of history: it was produced in a\nUnited States mint. This is something the vending machine cares\nnothing about. The machine reacts only to the coin\u2019s intrinsic\nfeatures. You might put this by saying that the coin affects the\nmachine, not qua quarter, but only qua possessor of\na particular kind of intrinsic makeup. (Vending machines are built to\ntake advantage of the contingent fact that objects with this intrinsic\nmakeup are almost always quarters.)\n\nThe worry is that we apparently operate, in important respects, as\nvending machines do. We respond to incoming stimuli solely in virtue\nof our intrinsic makeup and the intrinsic character of the stimuli.\nBut if our thoughts possess their content in virtue of our standing in\ncomplicated environmental\u2013social\u2013historical relations to\nour surroundings, it is hard to see how such contents could make a\ncausal difference in our psychological economy, how they could figure\nin the production of behavior. Thoughts have contents, but\nthese contents could have no direct influence on the operation of\nmental mechanisms (Stich 1978; Kim 1982; Fodor 1980, 1987, ch. 2,\n1991; Jackson and Pettit 1988).\n7.2 Intrinsic Causal Surrogates\n\nOne general line of response notes that whenever we explain a bit of\nbehavior by appeal to extrinsic content, there is a local, intrinsic\nproperty available as a \u201ccausal surrogate\u201d to produce the\nbehavior (Crane and Mellor 1990). Such a surrogate may be\nneurophysiological or, as on\n computationalist\n views, a complex of \u201cformal\u201d or \u201csyntactic\u201d\nproperties of internal representations. Now by itself, this point\nseems just to highlight the problem: if intrinsic surrogates are\nalways needed, all the more reason to reject the efficacy of content.\nSome have indeed drawn such a lesson, concluding either that content\nhas no role to play in an explanatory psychology (Stich 1978, 1983),\nor perhaps that psychological explanations appealing to content were\nnever causal to begin with (Owens 1993; see also the noncausalists\ncited in \u00a71.1).\n\nBut this might be too hasty. Far from precluding the causal efficacy\nof content, the surrogates might in fact play a role in ensuring it.\nNote that while Lilian\u2019s intrinsic properties don\u2019t\nguarantee the contents of her beliefs, her intrinsic properties are,\nin her environment, reliably correlated with these contents\u2014so\nreliably, in fact, that content, in spite of being extrinsic, enters\ninto the counterfactuals or laws often thought to\nground causal efficacy. It seems clear, after all, that if Lilian had\nnot believed there was water in front of her, she would not have\nextended her hand. This counterfactual could be secured by the fact\nthat Lilian\u2019s believing \u201cThere\u2019s water in front of\nme\u201d covaries with some internal state of her brain, but the\ncounterfactual, for all that, is still true. A similar point could be\nmade using (hedged) laws connecting content with behavior. The terrain\nhere in any case is similar to that explored earlier in\n\u00a7\u00a75.3\u20134, though the extrinsic nature of content\nintroduces its own complexities. (On the counterfactuals, see Mele\n1992, ch. 2; Yablo 1997; on the laws, see Braun 1991; Fodor 1995.)\n\nThere\u2019s a more direct way that the intrinsic surrogates might\nsecure the efficacy of content: perhaps the surrogate properties\nare content, or rather a kind of content. Distinguish narrow\nfrom broad content. Think of narrow content as the content of a\nrepresentational state of mind minus its \u201cbroad\u201d\ncomponents. Consider Lilian (or Lilian\u2019s brain) and an\nintrinsically indiscernible brain in a vat wired to a supercomputer.\nGrant that Lilian and the envatted brain entertain intrinsically\nindiscernible thoughts with utterly different representational\ncontents. Now imagine that we could abstract a common element from the\ncontents of Lilian\u2019s and the brain\u2019s intrinsically\nindiscernible thoughts. This element is their narrow content. Because\nnarrow content is something all intrinsic duplicates must have in\ncommon, the hope is that such content could be the very intrinsic\nproperties that produce behavior.\n\nThe notion of narrow content might raise suspicion, however. Return to\nthe vending machine. The quarter Gus inserts in the machine has a\nparticular value owing to relations it bears to outside goings-on: it\nwas minted in the Denver mint. A counterfeit placed in the machine\ncould have the very same intrinsic makeup as the quarter, but it would\nlack the quarter\u2019s value. It looks as though it is the\nquarter\u2019s intrinsic makeup, not its value, that matters to the\noperation of the machine. Now imagine someone arguing that a quarter\nand an intrinsically indiscernible slug do in fact share a kind of\nvalue: narrow value. Because narrow value accompanies an\nobject\u2019s intrinsic qualities, we need not regard narrow value as\nepiphenomenal. But what could narrow value be? Whatever it is, could\nit in any way resemble value ordinarily conceived\u2014broad\nvalue? Narrow value looks like a phony category posited ad\nhoc to accommodate an otherwise embarrassing difficulty.\nNevertheless, some philosophers remain optimistic about the prospects\nof a viable internalist account of content, one that would allow fully\nfledged thoughts to have a role in the production of behavior. (For\nreferences and further discussion, see\n narrow mental content.)\n7.3 Reasons as Structuring Causes\n\nAnother, much different, attempt to preserve a causal role for content\ncan be found in Dretske 1988, 1989, 1993. So far we\u2019ve assumed\nthat a behavioral event is distinct from the mental event that causes\nit. On Dretske\u2019s view, however, behavior is a process\nthat includes, as a component, its mental cause. When mental event\na causes bodily movement b, the behavior in this\ncase is not b itself, but the process of a\u2019s\ncausing b. When Lilian raises her hand because she wants to\nget the teacher\u2019s attention and she believes that raising her\nhand will accomplish this end, her behavior is not her hand\u2019s\ngoing up, but the process of this belief-desire pair\u2019s causing\nher hand to go up.\n\nDretske grants that when mental event a initiates\n(\u201ctriggers\u201d) a process ending in bodily movement\nb, a does so solely in virtue of its intrinsic\nmakeup. Nevertheless, a\u2019s relational, intentional\nproperties have a causal role, for they can be relevant to the\nfact that a causes b. Reasons are \u201cstructuring\ncauses\u201d of behavior: it\u2019s because of what a\nindicates that it was \u201crecruited\u201d during the learning\nprocess as a cause of b. (Indication here is a matter of\nreliable co-variation.) It\u2019s because, for example,\nLilian\u2019s belief indicates what it does\u2014raising one\u2019s\nhand (in these circumstances) is a way to get the teacher\u2019s\nattention\u2014that it was (together with the relevant desire)\nrecruited as a cause of her hand-raising. Relational, intentional\nmental properties thus become causally relevant to behavior, because\nthey are relevant to structuring the very causal processes that, on\nDretske\u2019s view, constitute instances of behavior.\n\nDretske\u2019s proposed solution quickly produced a number of\nresponses (e.g., Smith 1990; Block 1990; Baker 1991; Horgan 1991; Kim\n1991; Mele 1991). One question is whether relational, intentional\nproperties in fact play a causal role in the structuring (or\n\u201cwiring\u201d) of causal processes in the brain. Even during\nthe learning process, the states of Lilian\u2019s brain would seem to\nbe sensitive only to local, intrinsic features of one another,\nfeatures that screen off external goings-on. Dretske might be able to\navoid such screening-off by appealing to the counterfactual dependence\nof behavior-structuring on these goings-on. His view would then stand\nor fall with the success of counterfactual theories of causal\nrelevance (\u00a75.3). A second question is whether intentional\nstates, even if they were relevant in the way Dretske says they are,\ndeliver the kind of causal relevance we want. When Lilian raises her\nhand, the structuring of the relevant processes in her brain has\nalready occurred. If intentional properties are relevant at all, then,\nthey are apparently relevant only to what happened in the past during\nthe learning process. But we normally regard mental properties as\ncausally relevant to what\u2019s going on here and now, the very time\nwhen Lilian (or anyone) acts (but cf. Allen 1995; Dretske replies to\ncritics in his 1991, esp. pp. 210\u20137; for a more recent\ndiscussion see Hofmann and Schulte 2014).\n7.4 Broad Behavior\n\nDretske\u2019s proposal is a version of the dual explanandum strategy\n(\u00a76.3). The idea is that physical and mental properties are\ncausally responsible for different effects. For Dretske, the\n(triggering) physical properties are responsible for bodily motions,\nwhile the (structuring) mental properties are responsible for\nbehavior.\n\nAnother version of this strategy begins with a point also made in\n\u00a76.3, namely that to question a property\u2019s causal relevance\nis really to question its relevance to some property of the effect.\nThe form of our central causal question, that is, is whether a mental\ncause qua F causes a behavioral effect qua\nG. Now when F is an intentional mental property,\nwhat G is the object of our question? One possibility is that\nit is a behavioral property that, like the mental property, is itself\n\u201cbroad\u201d (see, e.g., Enc 1995).\n\nConsider a simple example: Suppose Lilian believes that a glass in\nfront of her contains water, and this belief (together with her\ndesires) causes her to reach for the glass. Her behavior is an\ninstance of trying to get water, and it\u2019s the\ninstantiation of this property (and not, say, the property of being a\ncertain kind of bodily motion) that we\u2019re wondering about when\nwe ask whether the intentional property of her belief is causally\nrelevant. (If our interest lay solely in explaining a particular\nbodily motion, we would rest content with a non-psychological, purely\nphysiological explanation.) But now the answer seems straightforward.\nFor what makes Lilian\u2019s behavior a trying for water is that\nit\u2019s caused by a belief whose content concerns water. Once we\nrealize that the behavioral property of the effect is itself broad,\nits connection to the intentional mental property seems clear.\n\nThis is not to say that the physical properties of Lilian\u2019s\nbelief do no work: it\u2019s just that they are responsible for a\ndifferent property of the effect, for instance, the property of being\na forward arm-movement. The intentional properties of her belief are\nrelevant to the effect qua (broad) behavior; the physical\nproperties are relevant to the effect qua (narrow) bodily\nmotion. And as we noted earlier (\u00a76.3), such a solution can be\nemployed in response to the Exclusion Problem as well. If a mental\nproperty and its physical realizer are relevant to different\nproperties of the effect, they need not compete causally.\n\nBecause it promises to solve two outstanding problems of mental\ncausation, this approach is potentially quite powerful. (For\ndiscussion, see Fodor 1991; Burge 1995.) One question to raise here,\nhowever, is whether the fact that some behavior can be described\nbroadly makes the intentional mental property of its cause relevant.\nThe undeniable conceptual connections between mental and behavioral\ndescriptions might point to a kind of explanatory relevance,\nbut it\u2019s a further question whether causal connections grounding\nthese explanations involve broad properties. Those motivated by the\noriginal epiphenomenalist arguments will worry that narrow, physical\nproperties are really doing all the work here: the apparent relevance\nof the broad properties is an illusion created by the way we, in\ndescribing and explaining behavior, conceptualize both cause and\neffect (see Owens 1993). This point leads to a fourth, related\nresponse to the problem.\n7.5 The Appeal to Explanatory Practice\n\nSome theorists would challenge the distinction\u2014implicit in the\nforegoing discussion\u2014between explanation and causation. Our\nconcept of causality, they would insist, is bound up with the\nconcept of explanation: causally relevant properties are those that\nfigure in our best causal explanations (Segal and Sober 1991; Wilson\n1992; Burge 1993; Raymont 2001; \u00a76.3). We find out what causal\nrelations amount to by starting with clear cases of causal\nexplanation. Given that we (and the cognitive scientists) routinely\nexplain physical events by citing mental causes (and mental events by\ninvoking physical causes), questioning whether real causal\nrelations answer to these explanations is to succumb to the kind of\nmetaphysical hubris that gives metaphysics a bad name.\n\nThis appeal to explanatory practice has the potential to answer in one\nfell swoop all four of the property-based problems we\u2019ve\nconsidered.\n\nDoubtless our understanding of the notions of causality and causal\nrelevance depends importantly on our grasp of causal explanations. But\nthere are at least two areas of concern about the explanatory strategy\n(compare Kim 1998, pp. 60\u20137). First, you might wonder whether\nthe strategy addresses the right question. Earlier, we pointed out\nthat the central question of mental causation is not so much\nwhether mental properties are causally relevant but\nhow they could be, given some alleged feature of mental\nproperties (in the case at issue here, the feature is their being\nrelational properties). The explanatory strategy would at best seem to\nbe addressing only the \u201cwhether\u201d question, not the\n\u201chow\u201d question. Second, even when restricted to the\n\u201cwhether\u201d question, the strategy rests on a conflation of\nwhat appears to be an epistemological notion (explanation) with\nmetaphysical notions (causation and causal relevance). A full\nevaluation of the view would thus require a deeper look into how the\ntwo are related.\n8. Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind\n\nWe have been treating the problem of mental causation as though it\nwere a problem in applied metaphysics. Perhaps this approach is\nwrong-headed. Perhaps the problem really falls under the purview of\nthe philosophy of science. What if we began with a look at actual\nscientific practice (as suggested in \u00a7\u00a76.3, 7.5) and\ndetermined what exactly science requires for acceptable causal\nexplanation? An examination of established special sciences reveals\nthat the very features (multiple realizability, higher-level and\n\u201cbroad\u201d properties, for instance) metaphysically inclined\nphilosophers regard as posing apparently insuperable difficulties for\nmental causation, are routinely invoked in causal explanations in\nthose sciences. This suggests that, rather than let a priori\nconceptions of causation (or properties, or causal powers) lead us to\nregard mental causation with suspicion, we should reason in the other\ndirection: revise our conception of causation to fit our actual\nscientific beliefs and practices. If the metaphysicians were right\nabout causation, no science would be possible beyond basic physics\n(biological properties, for instance, would lack causal efficacy).\n\nThis is one way to go. Another way is to take a step backward and ask\nwhich features of our conception of the mental, features we commonly\ntake for granted, might be the source of our difficulties.\nEliminativists aside, all parties evidently agree that \u201crealism\nabout the mental\u201d requires that mental predicates figuring in\ncausal accounts of behavior designate distinctively mental properties.\nIf we aim to honor psychology (and the other special sciences), our\njob is to show how these properties could be causally relevant to\nphysical goings-on. Suppose, in contrast, that you took the goal to\nbe, not the preservation of mental properties, but the\npreservation of mental truths. In that case we would seek an\naccount of the mind that provides plausible truthmakers for\npsychological and psycho-physical claims, including claims concerning\nmental causation.\n\nOne possibility is that truthmakers for psychological truths include\nirreducibly mental properties. This is not the only possibility,\nhowever. Another is that psychological assertions are made true by\nphysical states and properties, states and properties answering to\npredicates belonging to physics and chemistry. A view of this kind\n(which is close to Davidson\u2019s as spelled out in \u00a75 and to\nthe identity solutions discussed in \u00a76.5) would endeavor to\nresolve the problem of mental causation, not by tinkering with the\ncausal concept, but by rejecting the idea that mental and physical\nproperties are distinct kinds of property. All parties agree that\nmental predicates and descriptions differ from physical predicates and\ndescriptions. Application conditions for mental terms and physical\nterms diverge in ways that preclude definitional reduction of the one\nto the other. Perhaps it is a mistake, however, to move from this\nlinguistic fact to a substantive ontological thesis: mental and\nphysical predicates designate properties belonging to distinct\nfamilies of properties.\n\nWhether anything like this could be made to work is an open question.\nTo the extent that you regard the current state of play as\nunsatisfying, however, it is perhaps a question worth pursuing.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, C., 1995, \u201cIt Isn\u2019t What You Think: A New Idea\nAbout Intentional Causation\u201d, <em>No\u00fbs</em>, 29:\n115\u201326.", "Alward, P., 2008, \u201cMopes, Dopes, and Tropes: A Critique of\nthe Trope Solution to the Problem of Mental Causation\u201d,\n<em>Dialogue</em>, 47: 53\u201364.", "Anscombe, G.
