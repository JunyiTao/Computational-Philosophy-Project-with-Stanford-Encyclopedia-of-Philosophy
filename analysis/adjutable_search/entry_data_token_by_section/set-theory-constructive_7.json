Proof Theory and Semantics of Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF\n\n\nIn considering a certain mathematical practice (or a theory used to\ncodify it) from a philosophical perspective, we need to clarify\nwith the greatest possible precision the assumptions which are made\nwithin it as well as the consequences which arise from those\nassumptions. This is particularly true when working with theories\nwhich are based on a weaker logic than the classical one, for which a\ndeeper, more precise insight is mandatory. Many technical tools are\navailable which can help us clarify those aspects. Among the available\ninstruments, there are proof-theoretic techniques, such as\nproof-theoretic interpretations, as well as semantic techniques, such\nas realisability, Kripke models, Heyting-valued semantics. In fact, in\nthe literature one often witnesses the interplay of proof-theoretic\nand semantic techniques. We here give a cursory look into some of\nthese topics and suggest further reading.\n",
