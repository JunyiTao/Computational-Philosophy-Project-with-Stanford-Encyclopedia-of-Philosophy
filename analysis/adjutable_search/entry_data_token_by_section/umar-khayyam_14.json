    "main_text": "The Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (Quatrains) || Free Will, Determinism and Predestination\n3.6 Free Will, Determinism and Predestination\nKhayyam is known as a determinist in both the East and the West, and deterministic themes can be seen in much of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t. But if we read his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t together with his philosophical writings, the picture that emerges may be more rightly called \u201csoft determinism.\u201d One of Khayyam\u2019s best known quatrains in which determinism is clearly conveyed asserts:\n\nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\nMoves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, FitzGerald 1859, 20)\n\nAgain, in his philosophical treatise The Necessity of Contrariety, Khayyam adheres to three types of determinism. On a universal or cosmic level, our birth is determined in the sense that we had no choice in this matter. Ontologically speaking, our essence and our place on the overall hierarchy of beings appears also to be predetermined. However, the third category of determinism, socio-economic determinism, is man-made and thus changeable. Our attempt to face this determined end of our life, however, will again lead us to nowhere but bewilderment:\n\nAt first they brought me perplexed in this way\nAmazement still enhances day by day\nWe all alike are tasked to go but Oh!\nWhy are we brought and sent? This none can say\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Tirtha 1941, 18)\n\nThus a reading of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t in conjunction with Khayyam\u2019s philosophical reflections bring forward a more sophisticated view of free will and determinism, indicating that Khayyam believed in free will within a form of cosmic determinism and did not support a full-blown predeterminism.\n",
