    "main_text": "Do Types Exist? || Universals\n7.1 Universals\n\n\nSince types are usually thought to be universals, the debate over\nwhether they exist is as longstanding as the debate over universals,\nand debaters fall into the same camps. Realists say they do, as we saw\nin \u00a75 which surveyed several varieties of realism. Realism's\ntraditional opponents were nominalists and\nconceptualists. Nominalists, who renounce universals and abstract\nobjects, say they don't.  (See, e.g., Goodman and Quine 1947, Quine\n1953, Goodman 1977 and Bromberger 1992b). Conceptualists argued that\nthere are no general things such as the species homo sapiens;\nthere are only general ideas\u2014that is, ideas that apply\nto more than one thing. Applied to words, the thesis would be that\nwords are not abstract objects \u201cout there\u201d, but objects in\nthe mind.  Their existence then, would be contingent on having been\nthought of.  While this contingency may have a good deal of\nplausibility in the case of linguistic items, by itself conceptualism\nis just a stopgap measure on the issue of types and tokens\ngenerally. For ideas themselves are also either types or tokens (as\nevidenced by the fact that two people sometimes have the same\nidea). So either the conceptualist is proposing that types are idea\ntypes\u2014which would be a species of realism\u2014or she is\nproposing that there are no types, only mental idea particulars in\nparticular persons, which is a version of nominalism. Conceptualism,\ntherefore, will be ignored in what follows.\n",
