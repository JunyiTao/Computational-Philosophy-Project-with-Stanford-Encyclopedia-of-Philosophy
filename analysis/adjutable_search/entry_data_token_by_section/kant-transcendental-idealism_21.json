    "main_text": "One Object or Two? || Phenomenalist Dual Aspect Readings\n5.3 Phenomenalist Dual Aspect Readings\n\nSome scholars have defended what might initially seem like a\ncontradiction in terms: a phenomenalist \u201cone object\u201d\n(identity) interpretation of appearances and things in\n themselves.[61]\n On such a view, the appearance and the thing in itself are one and\nthe same object, but considered with respect to different properties:\nthe properties we experience the object as having, and the properties\nit has. On this interpretation, Kant is qualified phenomenalist\nbecause he holds that:\n\n(PhenomenalismP) The core physical properties of\nobjects in space are grounded in the contents of our experience of\nthem.\n\nHis attitude to:\n\n(PhenomenalismE) The existence of objects in space\nis ground partly or wholly in the contents of our experience of\nthem.\n\ndepends upon how we read it, on this interpretation. On the one hand,\nwe can understand it either as the \u201cde re\u201d\nclaim\n\n(PhenomenalismE*) (x)(x is an\nobject in space \u2283 the existence of x is partly or wholly\ngrounded in our experience of x)\n\nin which case Kant would reject it, because each such object in space\nis also a thing in itself and, as such, does not depend for its\nexistence on our experience of it. On the other hand, we could\nunderstand it as the de dicto claim\n\n(PhenomenalismE**) The fact that there are objects\nin space is partly or wholly grounded in our experience of objects in\nspace.\n\nin which case Kant would accept it, because there being objects in\nspace depends upon our experiencing objects as in space.\n\nThis leads to an important exegetical point. One of the main\nmotivations for \u201cnon-identity\u201d interpretations are\npassages in which Kant claims that appearances would not exist if\nthere were not subjects to experience them, e.g., A42/B59. This might\nbe thought to directly entail phenomenalism, for, if appearances would\nnot exist without subjects to experience them, but things in\nthemselves would, then a fortiori appearances and things in\nthemselves are distinct. This line of reasoning can be represented\nformally as (P1), (P2) and C from section 5.1. But the identity reader\ncan interpret Kant\u2019s claim \u201cif I were to take away the\nthinking subject, the whole corporeal world would have to\ndisappear\u201d as meaning: without subjects to experience them,\nappearances would not exist as appearances, i.e., would not\nappear. In other words, she can reinterpret (P1) as:\n\n(P1*)\n For all x, if x is an appearance, then\nx\u2019s existence as an appearance (=the fact that\nx exists and appears) is grounded in the contents of\nexperience.\n\n\nBut the conjunction of this and (P2) does not entail (C); they are\ncompatible with the identity reading. These passages do not\nforce the non-identity interpretation on us.
