    "main_text": "The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Einstein\u2019s Equation and the Iconic Equation\n1.6 Einstein\u2019s Equation and the Iconic Equation\n\nAs we have seen, Einstein\u2019s equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\) states that\nwhenever there is a change in the rest energy of an object, there is a\ncorresponding change in its mass (i.e., rest-mass). Although we have\nnot exactly demonstrated it, Einstein\u2019s equation is also\ninterpreted as stating that any object with a non-zero mass (i.e.,\nrest-mass) possesses a rest energy (also sometimes called\n\u201cinternal energy\u201d). \n\nHowever, in relativistic mechanics, i.e., in the study of the motions\nof idealized point particles that move in accordance with the theory\nof special relativity, an object\u2019s total energy \\(E\\), which is\ndefined as the sum of its kinetic energy and its rest energy, is given\nby the equation: \n\n\\[\nE = m \\gamma(v) c^2,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma(v)\\) is to so-called \u201cLorentz factor.\u201d This\ntotal energy \\(E\\) differs from the rest energy \\(E_o\\) for any object\nthat moves with some velocity \\(v\\) relative to a given inertial\nframe. In such an inertial frame, an object will have a non-zero\nrelativistic kinetic energy and its total energy \\(E\\) is\ngiven by the equation above. In the inertial frame in which such an\nobject is at rest, however, the value of \\(\\gamma(v)\\) becomes 1 and\nthe total energy is equal to the rest energy \\(E_o\\), one might say,\nprecisely because in that inertial frame the object\u2019s\nrelativistic kinetic energy is zero. \n\nIn the early and mid twentieth century, some physicists, such as\nRichard Feynman (1963, Vol. I, Sec. 16-4), defined a new quantity,\nwhich they labelled \\(m\\) and called the \u201crelativistic\nmass,\u201d as the product of the rest-mass of the object, which they\nlabelled \\(m_o\\), and the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma(v)\\) like this:\n\n\\[\nm = m_o \\gamma(v).\n\\]\n\n\nUsing these notational conventions, the iconic equation \\(E =\nmc^2\\) is the equation for the total energy \\(E\\) of a body as a\nfunction of its relativitic mass. This equation is\nnot really of interest to us in discussing mass-energy equivalence.\nFurthermore, physicists today have generally given up this notational\nconvention and deprecate the notion of \u201crelativistic\nmass,\u201d which, as Griffiths quips, \u201chas gone the way of the\ntwo dollar bill\u201d (1999, p. 510 fn. 8). \n",
