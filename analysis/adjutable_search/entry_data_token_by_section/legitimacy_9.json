    "main_text": "Political Legitimacy and Democracy\n4. Political Legitimacy and Democracy\n\nThis section takes a closer look at the relationship between democracy\nand political legitimacy. In contemporary political philosophy, many,\nbut by no means all, hold that democracy is necessary for political\nlegitimacy. Democratic instrumentalism is the view that democratic\ndecision-making procedures are at best a means for reaching just\noutcomes, and whether or not legitimacy requires democracy depends on\nthe outcomes that democratic decision-making brings about. Thomas\nChristiano (2004) helpfully distinguishes between monistic conceptions\nof political legitimacy and non-monistic ones. Democratic\ninstrumentalism is a monistic view. It reduces the normativity of\npolitical legitimacy to a single dimension: only the quality of the\noutcomes a particular political regime generates is relevant for\npolitical legitimacy. The main alternative in contemporary political\nphilosophy is a form of proceduralism according to which democracy is\nnecessary for political legitimacy, independently of its instrumental\nvalue (Buchanan 2002). Some such proceduralist conceptions of\ndemocratic legitimacy are also monistic. What is commonly called pure\nproceduralism is an example of a monistic view. According to pure\nproceduralism only procedural features of decision-making are relevant\nfor democratic legitimacy. Many philosophers are drawn to non-monistic\nconceptions of democratic legitimacy. Such mixed conceptions of\ndemocratic legitimacy combine conditions that refer to the quality of\noutcomes of democratic decision-making with conditions that apply to\nprocedural features.\n",
