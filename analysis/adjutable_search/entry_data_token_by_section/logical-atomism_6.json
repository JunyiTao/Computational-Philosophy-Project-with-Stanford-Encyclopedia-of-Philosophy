    "main_text": "Ontological Aspects of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || Russellian Facts: Atomic, Negative and General\n4.1 Russellian Facts: Atomic, Negative and General\n\n As we have seen, the primary metaphysical thesis of Russell\u2019s atomism\nis the view that the world consists of many independent entities that\nexhibit qualities and stand in relations to one another.  On this\npicture, the simplest sort of fact or complex consists either of a\nsingle individual or particular bearing a quality, or a number of\nindividuals bearing a relation to one another. Relations can be\ndivided into various categories depending on how many relata they\ninvolve: a binary or dyadic relation involves two\nrelata (e.g., a is to the left of b); a\ntriadic relation (e.g., a is between b and\nc) involves three relata and so on. Russell at times used the\nword \u201crelation\u201d in a broad sense so as to include qualities, which\ncould be considered as \u201cmonadic\u201d relations, i.e., relations that only\ninvolve one relatum.  The quality of being white, involved,\ne.g., in the fact that a is white, could then, in this\nbroader sense, also be considered a relation.\n\n \nAt the time of Principia Mathematica, complexes in Russell\u2019s\nontology were all described as taking the form of n\nindividuals entering into an n-adic relation. There he\nwrites:\nWe will give the name of \u201ca complex\u201d to any such object as\n\u201ca in the relation R to b\u201d or \u201ca\nhaving the quality q,\u201d or \u201ca and b and\nc standing in relation S.\u201d Broadly speaking, a\ncomplex is anything which occurs in the universe and is not\nsimple. (PM, 44)\n\n As we have seen, at the time of writing Principia\nMathematica, Russell believed that an elementary proposition\nconsisting of a single predicate representing an n-place\nrelation along with n names of individuals is true if it\ncorresponds to a complex. An elementary proposition is false if there\nis no corresponding complex. Russell there gave no indication that he\nbelieved in any other sorts of complexes or truth-makers for any other\nsorts of propositions. Indeed, he held that a quantified proposition\nis made true not by a single complex, but by many, writing, \u201c[i]f\n\u03c6x is an elementary judgment it is true when it\npoints to a corresponding complex. But\n(x).\u03c6x does not point to a single corresponding\ncomplex: the corresponding complexes are as numerous as the possible\nvalues of x\u201d (PM, 46).\n\n \nSoon after Principia Mathematica, Russell became convinced\nthat this picture was too simplistic. In the \u201cPhilosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d lectures he described a more complicated framework. In the\nnew terminology, the phrase \u201catomic fact\u201d was introduced for the\nsimplest kind of fact, i.e., one in which n particulars enter\ninto an n-adic relation.  He used the phrase \u201catomic\nproposition\u201d for a proposition consisting only of a predicate for an\nn-place relation, along with n proper names for\nparticulars. Hence, such propositions could take such forms as\n\u201cF(a)\u201d,\n\u201cR(a, b)\u201d,\n\u201cS(a, b, c)\u201d\n(cf. PM2, xv).  An atomic proposition is true when it\ncorresponds to a positive atomic fact. However, Russell no longer\nconceived of falsity as simply lacking a corresponding\nfact. Russell now believed that some facts are negative, i.e., that if\n\u201cR(a, b)\u201d is false, there is\nsuch a fact as\na\u2019s not bearing relation R to b.\nSince the proposition \u201cR(a, b)\u201d is\naffirmative, and the corresponding fact is negative,\n\u201cR(a, b)\u201d is false, and, equivalently, its\nnegation \u201cnot-R(a, b)\u201d is true. Russell\u2019s\nrationale for endorsing negative facts was somewhat complicated (see,\ne.g., PLA, 211\u201315); however, one might object that his\nearlier view, according to which \u201cR(a, b)\u201d\nis false because it lacks a corresponding complex, is only plausible\nif you suppose that it must be a fact that there is not such\na complex, and such a fact would itself seem to be a negative\nfact.\n\n \nBy 1918, Russell had also abandoned the view, held at least as late as\n1911 (see RA, 94) that qualities and relations can occur in a\ncomplex as themselves the relata to another relation, as in\n\u201cpriority implies diversity\u201d. Partly influenced by Wittgenstein,\nRussell now held the view that whenever a proposition apparently\ninvolves a relation or quality occurring as logical subject, it is\ncapable of being analyzed into a form in which the relation or quality\noccurs predicatively. For example, \u201cpriority implies diversity\u201d might\nbe analyzed as \u201c(x)(y)(x is prior to\ny \u2283 x is not y)\u201d (PLA, 205\u201306;\nfor further discussion see Klement 2004).\n\n \nRussell used the phrase \u201cmolecular proposition\u201d for those propositions\nthat are compounded using truth-function operators.  Examples would\ninclude, \u201cF(a) &\nR(a, b)\u201d and\n\u201cR(a, b)\n\u2228 R(b, a)\u201d. According to Russell,\nit is unnecessary to suppose that there exists any special sort of\nfact corresponding to molecular propositions; the truth-value of a\nmolecular proposition could be entirely derivative on the truth-values\nof its constituents (PLA, 209). Hence, if\n\u201cF(a)\n& R(a,b)\u201d is true, ultimately it\nis made true by two atomic facts, the fact that\na has property F and the fact that a bears\nR to b, and not by a single conjunctive fact.\n\n \nHowever, by 1918, Russell\u2019s attitude with regard to quantified\npropositions had changed. He no longer believed that the truth of a\ngeneral proposition could be reduced simply to the facts or complexes\nmaking its instances true.  Russell argued that the truth of the\ngeneral proposition \u201c(x).R(x,  b)\u201d\ncould not consist entirely of the various atomic facts that a\nbears R to b, b bears R to\nb, c bears R to b,\u00a0\u2026. It\nalso requires the truth that there are no other individuals besides\na, b, c, etc., i.e., no other atomic facts\nof the relevant form. Hence, Russell concluded that there is a special\ncategory of facts he calls general facts that account for the\ntruth of quantified propositions, although he admitted a certain\namount of uncertainty as to their precise nature (PLA,\n234\u201337). Likewise, Russell also posited existence facts,\nthose facts corresponding to the truth of existentially quantified\npropositions, such as\n\u201c(\u2203x)R(x, b)\u201d. In the case of\ngeneral and existence facts, Russell did not think it coherent to make\ndistinctions between positive and negative facts. Indeed, a negative\ngeneral fact could simply be described as an existence fact, and a\nnegative existence fact could be described as a general fact. For\nexample, the falsity of the general proposition \u201call birds fly\u201d\namounts to the fact that there exist birds that do not fly, and the\nfalsity of the existential proposition \u201cthere are unicorns\u201d amounts to\nthe general fact that everything is not a unicorn. Obviously, however,\nthe truth or falsity of a general or existence proposition is not\nwholly independent of its instances.\n\n \nIn addition to the sorts of facts discussed above, Russell raised the\nquestion as to whether a special sort of fact is required\ncorresponding to propositions that report a belief, desire or other\n\u201cpropositional attitude\u201d.  Russell\u2019s views on this matter changed over\ndifferent periods, as his own views regarding the nature of judgment,\nbelief and representation matured.  Moreover, in some works he left it\nas an open question as to whether one need presuppose a distinct kind\nof logical form in these cases (e.g., PLA, 224\u201328;\nIMT, 256\u201357). At times, however, Russell believed that the\nfact that S believes that a bears R to\nb amounts to the holding of a multiple relation in which\nS, a, R and b are all\nrelata (e.g. NTF, 155\u201356; TK, 144ff).  At other\npoints, he considered more complicated analyses in which beliefs\namount to the possession of certain psychological states bearing\ncausal or other relationships to the objects they are about, or the\ntendencies of believers to behave in certain ways (see, e.g.,\nIMT, 182\u201383; HK, 144\u201348).  Depending on how such\nphenomena are analyzed, it is certainly not clear that they require\nany new species of fact. \n",
