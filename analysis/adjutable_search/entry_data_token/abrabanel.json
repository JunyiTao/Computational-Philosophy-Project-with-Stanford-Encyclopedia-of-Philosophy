Common to any transitional figure, however, is the problem\nof contextualization. In the case of Judah Abrabanel, do we regard him\nas the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers or the first of the\nearly modern ones?  His work, for example, is certainly in\nconversation with a number of themes found in Renaissance Platonism\nand Humanism. Yet at the same time he freely draws upon the cosmology\nand metaphysics of his Jewish and Islamic predecessors.\n\n\nAbrabanel\u2019s magnum opus, the Dialoghi d\u2019amore\n(\u201cDialogues of Love\u201d) belongs to the genre of the\ntrattato d\u2019amore (\u201ctreatise on love\u201d) that was\nintimately connected to both the Renaissance and the development of\nthe Italian vernacular. Although Abrabanel\u2019s dialogue provides one of\nthe genre\u2019s most important philosophical discussions in this, it\nnonetheless is confined to its literary and stylized form. The work\nitself consists of three dialogues, with the third one providing the\nlongest and most sustained philosophical discussion. Some contend that\nAbrabanel originally composed an introduction to the work and a fourth\ndialogue, neither of which\n survives.[1] \n In essence, the Dialoghi offers the transcript of a\nconversation between two individuals, Philo and Sophia, two courtiers,\nwho discourse on the nature of love as both a sensual and cosmic\nprinciple.  Philo, the male character, is portrayed as an\naccomplished philosopher, and Sophia, the female character, as a\nstudent of philosophy.  Despite this, Sophia is not just a\nconvenient textual strategy, but becomes a character in her own right,\nsomeone who significantly contributes to the philosophical unfolding\nof the work. Moreover, many of the dialogic exchanges that take place\nbetween Philo and Sophia are very playful, with Philo, on one level,\neither answering Sophia\u2019s questions about love or responding to\nher criticisms; yet, on another level, he physically desires Sophia\nand wishes to consummate this desire. Philo\u2019s desire for Sophia,\nthus, reflects the same desire of God (the superior) for the world\n(the inferior). As a Renaissance artist, then, Abrabanel cleverly and\nartfully weaves the philosophical principles of love, beauty, and\ndesire into the very literary structure of his Dialoghi.\n", "toc": [{"#LifWor": "1.

Life and Works\n\n\nThere exists a large debate in the secondary literature concerning the\nplace and role of Jews in Renaissance culture. One group envisages a\nsynthesis between Jewish culture on the one hand, and the ideals of\nthe Renaissance on the\n other.[2] \n Jews, according to this interpretation, could quite easily remain\nJewish while still sharing in the values and culture of non-Jewish\nsociety. Another group, however, maintains that such a synthesis is\nhistorically untenable because Jews remained a small, persecuted\nminority left to the whims of various local\n governments.[3] \n These two approaches leave us with radically different conceptions of\nRenaissance Jewish philosophers. According to the first approach, a\nJewish intellectual could quite easily partake of the ideals and\ncategories of Renaissance Humanism and Neoplatonism. According to the\nsecond approach, however, such a synthesis could never occur, and, as\na result, most Renaissance Jewish thinkers were more indebted to the\nlegacy of Maimonides than the various trajectories of Renaissance\nthought. A more productive approach, however, exists between these\ntwo: The Italian Renaissance provided certain elite Jews with new\nliterary genres, intellectual categories, and educational ideals with\nwhich to mine the depths of their tradition.\n1.1 Life\n\n\nJudah Abrabanel was born in Lisbon, Portugal, sometime between 1460\nand 1470. He was the firstborn of Don Isaac Abrabanel\n(1437\u20131508), who was an important philosopher in his own right. \nIn addition to their intellectual skills, the Abrabanel family played\nan important role in international commerce, quickly becoming one of\nthe most prominent families in Lisbon.\n\n\nDespite the conservative tendencies in the thought of his father,\nDon Isaac insured that his children received educations that included\nboth Jewish and non-Jewish subjects. Rabbi Joseph ben Abraham ibn\nHayoun, the leading rabbinic figure in Lisbon, was responsible for\nteaching religious subjects (e.g., Bible, commentaries, and halakhic\nworks) to Judah and his brothers. As far as non-Jewish works and\nsubjects were concerned, Judah, like most elite Jews of the fifteenth\ncentury, would have been instructed in both the medieval Arabo-Judaic\ntradition (e.g., Maimonides, Averroes), in addition to humanistic\nstudies imported from\n Italy.[4]\n\n\nBy profession, Judah was a doctor, one who had a very good\nreputation and who served the royal court. In 1483, his father\nwas implicated in a political conspiracy against Joao II, the Duke of\nBraganza, and was forced to flee to Seville, in Spain, with his\nfamily. Shortly after his arrival, undoubtedly on account of his\nimpressive connections and diplomatic skills, Isaac was summoned to the\ncourt of Ferdinand and Isabella, where he was to become a financial\nadvisor to the royal family. Despite his favorable relationship\nwith them, Isaac was unable to influence them to rescind their famous\nedict of expulsion\u2014calling on all Jews who refused to convert\nto Christianity\u2014to depart from the Iberian\nPeninsula.\n\n\nJudah seems also to have been well connected at the Spanish court and\nwas one of the physicians who attended the royal family. After the\nedict of expulsion had been issued, Ferdinand and Isabella requested\nthat he remain in Spain. To do this, however, he still would have had\nto convert to Christianity. Yet, in order to try and keep Judah in\nSpain, a plot was hatched to kidnap his firstborn son, Isaac ben\nJudah. Judah, however, discovered the plot and sent his son, along\nwith his Christian nanny, on to Portugal, where he hoped to meet up\nwith them. Upon hearing that a relative of Isaac Abrabanel had\nre-entered Portugal, Joao II had the young boy seized and forcefully\nconverted to Christianity. It is uncertain whether or not Judah ever\nsaw or heard from his son again. In a moving poem, entitled\nTelunah \u2018al ha-zeman (\u201cThe Travails of\nTime\u201d), he writes:\n\n\n\n\nTime with his pointed shafts has hit my heart\n\n and split my guts, laid open my entrails,\n\n landed me a blow that will not heal\n\n knocked me down, left me in lasting pain\u2026\n\n He did not stop at whirling me around,\n\n exiling me while yet my days were green\n\n sending me stumbling, drunk, to roam the world\u2026\n\n He scattered everyone I care for northward,\n\n eastward, or to the west, so that\n\n I have no rest from constant thinking, planning\u2014\n\n and never a moment\u2019s peace, for all my\n plans.[5]\n\n\n\n\nLike many of those Jews who refused to convert, Judah and his\nimmediate family, including his father, made their way to Naples.\nThere, Ferdinand II of Aragon, the king of Naples, warmly welcomed the\nAbrabanel family, owing to its many contacts in international\ntrade. In 1495, however, the French took control of Naples, and Judah\nwas again forced to flee, first to Genoa, then to Barletta, and\nsubsequently to Venice. It seems that he also traveled around Tuscany,\nand there is some debate as to whether or not he actually met the\nfamous Florentine Humanist, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (it seems\nunlikely that he did).  In 1501, after the defeat of the French in\nNaples, he was invited back to be the personal physician of the\nViceroy of Naples, Fernandez de C\u00f3rdoba. Among all of these\nperegrinations, Judah found the time to write (but not publish) his\nmagnum opus, the Dialoghi d\u2019amore. He seems to\nhave died sometime after 1521. Other than these basic facts, we know\nvery little of the life of Judah Abrabanel.\n\n\nEspecially enigmatic are the last years of his life, between 1521 when\nhe was requested to give medical attention to Cardinal San Giorgio\nuntil 1535 when Mariano Lenzi published the Dialoghi\nposthumously in Rome. There is some evidence that Judah moved to Rome\nnear the end of his life; some suggest that he fell in with a\nChristian group of Neoplatonists. Indeed, the 1541 edition of the work\nmentions that Judah converted to Christianity (dipoi fatto\nchristiano). This, however, seems highly unlikely as (1) it is\nnot mentioned in the first edition, the one on which all subsequent\neditions and translations were based, and (2) there is no internal\nevidence in the Dialoghi to suggest this. In fact, one of the\ncharacters in the work implies the exact opposite, stating that\n\u201call of us believe in the sacred Mosaic law\u201d (noi\ntutti che crediamo la sacre legge\n mosaica).[6] \n It seems, then, that either a careless or over-zealous editor\ninserted the phrase \u201cdipoi fatto christiano\u201d into\na later edition of the Dialoghi.\n1.2 Works\n\n\nThe only major work that we possess of Judah Abrabanel is the\nDialoghi d\u2019amore. There is some debate as to when the\nwork was actually written. Many point to the year 1501\u20131502 owing to a\nphrase in the third book: \u201cAccording to the Jewish tradition, we\nare in the year 5262 from the beginning of creation\u201d (Siamo,\nsecondo la verit\u00e1 ebraica, a cinque milia ducento sessanta due\ndel principio de la\n creazione).[7] \n The year 5262 of the Jewish calendar corresponds to 1501\u20131502 of the\nGregorian calendar. Yet, manuscripts other than that based on the 1535\nedition have the date of 5272 (i.e., 1511\u20131512). This is significant\nbecause many who argue that the Dialoghi could not possibly\nhave been written in Italian point to the fact that Judah would not\nhave been fluent in Italian. Yet, if we assume the 1511\u20131512 date to\nbe correct this would place him in Italy for close to twenty years,\nmore than enough time to gain proficiency in Italian (especially given\nthe fact that he would have already known at least one Spanish\nvernacular and, as a physician, Latin).\n\n\nWe also know that Judah wrote poetry (see the poem quoted above). In\naddition to his biographical poem, he also composed poetic\nintroductions to three of his father\u2019s last works: Rosh\nAmanah, Zevach Pesach, and Nachalat Avot.\n\n\nFinally, we possess a letter dating to 1566 from one Amatus Lusitanus,\na physician who wrote that he attended to a patient by the name of\nJudah \u201cwho was the grandson of the great Platonic philosopher,\nknown as Judah or Leon Abrabanel, who gave to us the most beautiful\ndialogues on love.\u201d Further in this letter, he mentions that\nJudah also composed a work entitled De Coeli Harmonia\n(\u201cOn the Harmony of the Spheres\u201d) and that, according to\nthe introduction, he dedicated it to the \u201cdivine Pico della\nMirandola.\u201d Unfortunately, this work has not survived. If he\ndedicated to Pico as the letter indicates, it would most likely have\nbeen composed before the Dialoghi and also, based on the\ntitle, it would have been composed in Latin.\n1.3 Dialoghi d\u2019amore and the Question of Language\n\n\nThe central question concerning the language of the\nDialoghi\u2019s composition is: How could a Jewish refugee\nfrom Portugal show such facility with Italian, let alone the Tuscan\ndialect, since Judah seems to have spent very little time in\n Tuscany?[8] \n Those who argue\nfor a Latin original point to the fact that (1) he was a physician and\nwould have known Latin, and (2) a phrase by Yosef Shlomo Delmedigo\n(1591\u20131655) in his Mikhtav Ahuz suggesting that he was going\nto translate Judah\u2019s work from Latin. Those who argue for a\nHebrew original point to another phrase, this time by Claudio Tolemei\n(1492\u20131556), a non-Jew, which states that Judah composed his treatise\nin sua lingua (\u201chis own language\u201d). \nAlthough, as others have pointed out, such a phrase could quite easily\nrefer to \u201chis own style.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, given the evidence, an Italian original for the work seems\nmost likely since (1) all the manuscripts, including Mariano\nLenzi\u2019s edition of 1535, are in Italian; (2) it seems that Judah\nhad lived in Italy for close to twenty years by the time that he wrote\nthe Dialoghi (more than enough time for someone to gain an\nintimate knowledge of Italian, especially someone proficient in Latin\nand Spanish vernaculars); (3) neither later Jewish authors, e.g.,\nAzaria \n de\u2019Rossi,[9]\n nor non-Jewish authors, e.g., Tullia\n d\u2019Aragona,[10]\nhad any reason to suspect that it was written in a language other than\nItalian; (4) if we assume the later date of 1511\u20131512, many non-Tuscan\nItalian authors of this period called for the adoption of Tuscan as a\nliterary language, owing primarily to the fact that this was the\nlanguage of Petrarch (1304\u20131374) and Boccaccio\n (1313\u20131375);[11]\n and, (5) as for the\nquestion of the Tuscan dialect of the work, many Italian printers of\nthe early sixteenth century \u201cTuscanized\u201d Italian according\nto set\n criteria.[12]\n\n\nMoreover, many Jewish authors in the fifteenth- and\nsixteenth-centuries increasingly resorted to Romance vernaculars in\norder to attract a Jewish audience (including conversos and\nex-conversos), which no longer understood Hebrew. In\nsixteenth-century Italy, larger trends in rhetoric and the use of\nlanguage increasingly led to the creation of the ideal of a pure\nItalian language. In this regard, Judah becomes an important\ntransitional thinker in the encounter between Judaism and the Italian\nRenaissance. Whereas his father, Don Isaac, could still adapt\nhumanistic themes to his Hebrew writings, which were still primarily in\nconversation with medieval\n thought,[13]\n increasingly in Judah\u2019s generation the only way\nto engage in a full-scale examination of the universal tendencies\nassociated with Humanism was to write in the vernacular.\n\n\nFinally, the very genre of the Dialoghi, that of the\ntrattato d\u2019amore (\u201ctreatise on love\u201d), was\nthe product of the Italian vernacular of the late fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries. When, for example, Judah discusses the\nconcept of love as a universal or cosmic principle he draws upon, as\nwill be clearer below, a particular vocabulary and set of concepts that\nonly make sense when contextualized within this already\n existing\n discourse.[14]\n2. Faith, Reason, and Myth\n\n\nTwo features that are new in Judah\u2019s work and, thus, serve to\ndifferentiate his thought from that of his Jewish and Islamic\npredecessors are: (1) his almost complete lack of concern with the\nvenerable antagonism between faith and reason, and (2) his interest in\nelucidating the concomitant intersection between Greek myth and\nJudaism.\n\n\nThe tension between faith and reason had been at the heart of\nmedieval Jewish philosophy. This became especially pronounced in\npost-Maimonidean philosophy, which witnessed the radicalization of a\nnumber of principles (e.g., eternality of the universe, denial of\nbodily resurrection), and which threatened to undermine traditional\nreligious belief. This led to a Kulturkampf between\nthose who thought that non-Jewish learning (i.e., philosophy) had a\nvalid role to play in the Jewish curriculum versus those who claimed\nthat such \u201cforeign\u201d works led to apostasy. The\nreverberations of these conflicts, known collectively as the\n\u201cMaimonidean controversies,\u201d were severe.\n\n\nThe antagonism between faith and reason is immediately palpable in\nthe thought of Judah\u2019s father, who constantly tried to uphold\ntraditional Jewish belief against what he considered to be the\nonslaught of philosophical radicalism. Yet, in the thought of\nJudah this \u201cconflict\u201d between the hitherto venerable\nantagonists virtually disappears. The question we have to ask,\nthen, is why?  The most likely reason is to be located in the\nnotion of sophia perennis, which played an important role in\nthe thought of Florentine humanists. According to this doctrine,\nthere exists a unity to all knowledge irrespective of its source. \nAs a result, the rationalism of philosophy could quite easily be\nreconciled with that of revelation because both were regarded as\narticulating the same truth. Evidence of this may be seen in\nJudah\u2019s frequent citation of biblical passages to support\nphilosophical principles and vice versa. Furthermore, because\nJudah is primarily unconcerned with the antagonism between faith and\nreason, he becomes one of the first Jewish philosophers to ignore\nesotericism (viz., that philosophical truths must be kept from\nthe unenlightened) as a philosophical principle. For him,\ntraditional esoteric topics, such as metaphysics, now become part and\nparcel of the beautiful and dramatic unfolding of God\u2019s beauty in\nthe universe, and such topics are open to all (including women, as the\ncharacter of Sophia demonstrates).\n\n\nFurther evidence of Judah\u2019s use of the concept of sophia\nperennis may be witnessed in his orientation towards ancient Greek\nmyth. The \u201crediscovery\u201d of ancient Greek and Roman\nliterature was one of the hallmarks of the Renaissance, and in the\nthought of Judah we certainly see this, only now with a distinctly\nJewish \u201ctwist.\u201d On one level, he wants to show that there\nexists a fundamental identity between Greek myth and the teachings of\nthe Torah. Yet, on a deeper level he wants to argue that the\nGreeks ultimately derived their teachings from the ancient Israelites\nand subsequently corrupted\n them.[15]\n For instance, Judah argues that Plato studied among\nthe ancient Israelites in\n Egypt,[16]\n and that Plato\u2019s myth of the Androgyne, found\nin the Symposium, is actually a Greek plagiarism of a Jewish\nsource:\n\n\n\nSophia: The story is beautiful and ornate (la favola \u00e8\nbella e ornata), and it is impossible not to believe that it\nsignifies some philosophical beauty (bella filosofia), more\nespecially since it was composed by Plato himself, in the\nSymposium, in the name of Aristophanes. Tell me,\ntherefore, Philo what is the allegory?\n\n\nPhilo: The myth was handed down by earlier writers than the\nGreeks\u2014in the sacred writings of Moses, concerning the creation\nof the first human parents, Adam and Eve\u2026it was from [Moses]\nthat Plato took his myth, amplifying and polishing it after Greek\noratory, thus giving a confused account of Hebrew matters (facendo\nin questo una mescolanza inordinate de le cose\nebraiche).[17]\n\n\n\nJudah seeks to accomplish at least two things with passages such as\nthis. First, he claims, polemically, that the Jewish tradition,\nespecially its mythopoeic tradition, is the source of all subsequent\nliterary and philosophical streams of western civilization.  Secondly\n(and this is less evident in the above passage than in other ones), he\ntries to wrest Christian-centric interpretations of biblical passages\n(e.g., the Garden of Eden and the concept of original sin), including\nthose offered by thinkers such as Ficino and Pico della\n Mirandola,[18]\n away \nfrom what he considers to be the original intentionality of the\ntext. Rather, he claims that the Jewish version or interpretation of\nsuch texts is actually more in keeping with the spirit of the\nRenaissance than those offered by Christians. The corollary of this is\nthat any individual, Jewish or Gentile, should quite easily be able to\naccept equally the truths of Judaism and those of\n philosophy.[19]\n3. Beauty and Love\n\n\nIn the thought of Judah Abrabanel, the concepts of beauty\n(bellezza) and love (amore) become technical terms\nthrough which he examines virtually every traditional philosophical\nissue. Frequently, however, his discussion of one of these terms\nis predicated on the existence of the other; as a result, beauty and\nlove are inseparable in the Dialoghi, undoubtedly mirroring\nJudah\u2019s understanding of the way in which these two principles\noperate in the universe. The intimate relationship between these\ntwo principles may be witnessed in his definition of beauty as that\n\u201cwhich delights the mind that recognizes it and moves it to\nlove\u201d (dilettando l\u2019animo col suo conoscimento, il\nmuove ad \n amare).[20]\n Without Beauty, in other words, the intellect is\nunable to desire something outside of itself and, thus, it is\neffectively unable to cognize. Judah subsequently argues that the lower\nsenses (i.e., taste, smell or touch) cannot grasp Beauty; only the\nhigher senses (e.g., sight and hearing) can\u2014in addition, of\ncourse, to the imagination and the\n intellect.[21] \n Moreover, since Beauty is\nmirrored throughout the universe, physical objects (notes, melodies,\netc.) both participate in and point the way towards this incorporeal\nBeauty:\n\n\nBeauty is only found in the objects of sight (oggetti del\nviso), such as beautiful forms and shapes and beautiful pictures,\nthe perfect symmetry of the parts with the whole, well-proportioned\nlimbs, beautiful colors and clear light, the sun, the moon and the\nstars, and the heavens in all their splendor. This grace exists\nin objects of sight by reason of their spiritual nature, and it is the\ncustom to enter through the clear and spiritual eyes, to delight our\nsoul and move it to a love of such an object; and this is what it is\nthat we call beauty. It is also found in objects of hearing, such\nas beautiful oratory, voices, speech, song music, consonance,\nproportion and harmony. For in the spiritual nature of these\nthings is found grace which moves the soul to delight and to love\nthrough the medium of the spiritual sense of hearing. Thus grace\nand beauty are found among beautiful things that are endowed with a\nspiritual nature (sensi \n spirituali).[22]\n\n\nBased on this and other passages, Judah argues that it is primarily\nby means of the beauty of created things that the individual is able to\napprehend and move towards incorporeal or spiritual Beauty. Love\nis what is ultimately responsible for directing the soul and the\nintellect of the individual to increasingly spiritual matters.\n4. Philosophy of Beauty\n4.1  The Elevation of Rhetoric, Aesthetics, and the Imagination\n\n\nWe witness the further departure of Judah\u2019s thought from that\nof his predecessors when we examine his discussion of rhetoric and\naesthetics. Medieval Aristotelians tended to locate rhetoric in\nthe trivium (which also included logic and dialectic), and,\nthus, as propaedeutic to \u201chigher\u201d sciences such as\nmetaphysics. In the Renaissance, however, eloquence was equated\nwith wisdom, and the good rhetorician had to be proficient in all\nbranches of human knowledge. This led many Jewish Renaissance\nthinkers to examine not only the classical authors (e.g., Cicero and\nQuintilian), but also to mine the Bible for its use of language and\nstyle. Whereas Maimonides and other Jewish Aristotelians had been\ninterested in biblical rhetoric as a means to reproduce imaginative\nrepresentations of philosophical truths to those unlearned in\nphilosophy, Renaissance thinkers held that rhetoric was the art form\npar excellence, one that enabled the individual to command\nrespect in public\n life.[23]\n\n\nFurthermore, following Maimonides (e.g., Guide I.2), many\nmedieval thinkers envisaged beauty as contingent upon consensus and not\na matter of the intellectual faculty. In the Renaissance, by\ncontrast, beauty was elevated to an ideal that, inter alia,\nmoved the intellect, by means of desire, to either perfect that which\nexists below it or to be perfected by that above.  This principle\nwas subsequently shared by philosophers, poets, and visual artists,\nand, quite frequently, there existed a fluid line separating these\nprofessions.\n\nThis elevation of rhetoric and aesthetics in the Renaissance led to a\nsubsequent interest in the imagination, a faculty frequently\nmistrusted, but often deemed necessary to medieval political\nphilosophy. Mistrusted because, following Plato\u2019s critique, the\nimagination had the power to deceive and distort; yet, at the same\ntime necessary because the imagination was the defining element of\nprophecy. (In medieval Aristotelianism, the prophet was regarded as a\nperfect philosopher with a perfected imaginative faculty to coin\nimages for the uneducated masses.)  Only now, because Judah was not\nparticularly concerned with philosophical esotericism, the products of\nthe imagination, i.e., images, were not to be appreciated on a\npedagogical level alone, but more importantly on an aesthetic\none. Following Ficino, Judah argues that the artist\u2014more\nspecifically, the artist\u2019s imagination\u2014becomes the vessel\nthrough which God \n speaks.[24]\n4.2 Cosmology and Metaphysics\n\n\nAlthough there exists an intimate connection between sensual and\ncosmic beauty it is by means of the latter that Judah frames his\ndiscussion of cosmology, ontology, and psychology. Beauty, to\nreiterate, is what inspires love and desire, and thereby connects all\nlevels of the universe into an interlocking and organic relationship.\nThe result is that everything, both sensual and intelligible, has the\npotential to image and reflect God\u2019s beauty.\n\n\nJudah\u2019s cosmology is a case in point. In the\nDialoghi he presents two distinct accounts of the origin of\nthe universe. This issue\u2014viz., was the universe\ncreated or is it eternal\u2014was one of the touchstones in the\ndebate not only between philosophers and non-philosophers, but also\namong philosophers. At stake in these debates was God\u2019s\nomnipotence and omniscience: If the world was created, then clearly God\nis transcendent to the world as both its Creator and Sustainer; if not,\nthen God\u2019s power to act is potentially curtailed by another\nprinciple\u2019s eternality.  In his discussion of these\nmatters, Judah adopts two models: one based on Islamicate Neoplatonism\nand the other on the Plotinian triad.\n\n\nAccording to the first model, Judah argues\u2014citing Ghazali,\nAvicenna and Maimonides\u2014that God in His complete simplicity and\n\u201cby the love of His infinite beauty produces out of Himself alone\nthe first intelligence and mover of the first heaven\u201d (con\nl\u2019amore de la sua immense bellezza immediate da s\u00e9 sola la\nprima intelligenzia movtrice del primo cielo \n produce).[25]  \n The first\nintelligence, in turn, contemplates (1) the beauty of its cause to\nproduce the second intellect, and (2) its own beauty to produce the\nfirst heavenly sphere. This theory of emanation, based on the\nlove of\n beauty,[26]\n pervades the entire universe (both supra- and sub-lunar). The\nActive Intellect, the lowest of the ten heavenly intellects and\nassociated with the sphere of the moon, becomes the intellect of the\ncorporeal world. By contemplating its own beauty it produces the\nforms found in this world, and in contemplating the beauty of its\ncause, it produces human intellects. Following this, Judah offers\na Plotinian account based on a celestial\n triad.[27] \n He now distinguishes between\nthree types of beauty that pervade the cosmos. The first is God\nqua the Source of beauty (l\u2019attore di\nbellezza), the second is beauty itself (bellezza; i.e.,\nintelligible beauty), and the third is the physical universe produced\nby this idea in the intellect of God (il participante di\n bellezza).[28]\n\n\nJudah subsequently uses the latter model, combined with kabbalistic\nembellishment, to interpret the first creation account in Genesis,\nwhere the physical world is now described as the offspring between\nGod, the male principle, and intelligible beauty, now personified as a\n female.[29]\n Corporeal\nbeauty, according to this model, becomes the primogeniture of\nGod\u2019s love for His female consort, wisdom. Since this\nphysical world is intimately connected to God, it cannot be\nnegated. Rather, this world becomes necessary, and this is a\nleitmotiv that runs throughout the work, for humans to make physical\nbeauty \u201cspiritual in our\n intellect.\u201d[30] \n One must, in other words,\norientate oneself towards sensible beauty in such a manner that one\nreverses the ontological chain.\n4.3 Psychology and Prophecy\n\n\nThe above discussion is directly related to the way in which\nJudah\u2019s envisages both psychology and prophecy. According\nto him, the five external senses divide into (1) those that are\nprimarily material (materiali): touch (tatto), taste\n(gusto), and smell (odorato); and (2) those that are\nincreasingly spiritual (spirituali): hearing (per\nl\u2019audito) and sight (per \n l\u2019occhi).[31] \n It seems that only\nthe latter are able to penetrate behind the purely physical so as to\nabstract the spiritual from the corporeal. Hearing, intimately\nconnected to the Renaissance ideal of rhetoric, consists of the ability\nto discern \u201cfine speeches, excellent reasoning, beautiful verses,\nsweet music, and beautiful and harmonious\n melodies.\u201d[32] \n Sight, ranked just\nabove the faculty of hearing, owing to the primacy that Judah puts on\nvision, deals with \u201cbeautiful colors, regular patterns, and light\nin all its varied\n splendor.\u201d[33] \n The senses, thus, function hierarchically as a\nprolegomenon to any form of higher knowledge, with the imagination\nforming the threshold (mezzo) between the senses and the\nintellect.\n\n\nCentral to the unfolding argument in the Dialoghi is the\nconcept of ocular power (forza oculare). In the first\ndialogue, Judah describes two modes of apprehending spiritual\nmatters. The first is through the faculty of sight and the second\nthrough the\n intellect.[34] \n For the eye, like the intellect, is illumined\nby means of light, thereby establishing a relationship between the eye,\nthe object seen, and the space that separates\n them.[35] \n Just as the sun supplies light to the eye, the divine intellect\nillumines the human intellect during the act of intellection. It is\nlight, then, that enables us to \u201ccomprehend all the beautiful\nshining objects of the corporeal\n world.\u201d[36]\n Sight becomes the model by which we engage the universe: it is what\nmakes knowledge possible since it is only through vision of tangible\nparticulars that we acquire knowledge of intelligibles.\n\n\nJudah subsequently distinguishes between three types of\nvision. The highest type is that of God\u2019s visual\napprehension of himself; following this is that associated with the\nangelic world, which sees God directly though not on equal terms;\nfinally, there is human vision, which is the weakest of the three types\nand can only visualize the divine\n indirectly.[37] \n The best \nthat most humans can do in this world is to obtain knowledge\nof incorporeal essences through corporeal particulars. Judah does\nadmit, though, that some special individuals are able to unite with\nthe angelic world, which he describes as the Agent Intellect\n(intelleto agente).  When such unification\n(copulare) occurs, the individual \u201csees and desires\ndivine beauty as in a crystal or a clear mirror, but not\ndirectly\u201d (vede e desia la bellezza divine come in uno mezzo\ncristiallino, o sia chiaro specchio, ma non in se stessa\n immediate).[38] \n Judah refers to this act as prophecy. \nLike Maimonides, Judah claims that Moses did not prophesy through the\nimagination, but only through the intellect, which he nevertheless\ndescribes in highly visual terms as beholding \u201cthe most beautiful\nfigure of God\u201d (la bellissima figura di \n Dio).[39]\n\n\nIn the third dialogue, Abrabanel further divides the human into a\ntripartite structure consisting of the body (il corpo), the\nsoul (l\u2019anima), and the intellect\n (l\u2019intelletto).[40] \n The soul, which I have interpreted as the\nimaginative faculty because of the properties assigned to\n it,[41]\n is once again the intermediary (mezzo) between the body (and\nthe senses) and the\n intellect.[42]\n Although he does not come right out and define the functioning of the\nsoul in any detail, he does claim that it is indispensable to the\nproper working of the body and the intellect. Moreover, it is\nthis faculty that is in constant danger of being corrupted by unhealthy\ncorporeal desire and, most importantly for the present, it is\nultimately responsible for translating the corporeal into the\nincorporeal and vice versa. This soul, in turn,\n\n\n\nhas two faces (due faccie) , like those of the moon turned\ntowards the sun and the earth respectively, the one being turned\ntowards the intellect above it, and the other toward the body\nbelow. The first face looking towards the intellect is the\nunderstanding with which the soul reasons of universals and spiritual\nknowledge, extracting the forms and intellectual  essences from\nparticular and sensible bodies (estraendo le forme ed essenzie\nintellettuali da li particulari e sensibili corpi)\u2026the\nsecond face turned towards the body is sense, which is particular\nknowledge of corporeal things known \u2026 These two faces have\ncontrary or opposed notions; and as our soul with its upper face or\nunderstanding makes the corporeal incorporeal (l\u2019incorporeo\nal corporeo), so the lower face, or sensible cognition,\napproaching the objects of sense and mingling with them, draws the\nincorporeal to the\n corporeal.[43]\n\n5. Philosophy of Love\n5.1 Judah\u2019s Recasting of Love as a Philosophical Principle\n\n\nThe traditional philosophical notion of love, going back at least to\nthe time of Plato, is that love results from the imperfection and\nprivation of that which loves. One loves, in other words, what\none does not possess (see, e.g., Plato, Symposium\n 200a-201e).[44] Accordingly,\n that which is imperfect loves that\nwhich is perfect, and, that which is perfect (i.e., God) neither loves\nnor desires. Aristotle likewise claimed that that which is less\nperfect (e.g., slaves, children, wives and ruled) should have more love\nfor that which is more perfect (e.g., freeborn, parents, husbands, and\nrulers) than vice versa. The First Cause, then, is loved\nbut does not love. This discussion would predominate from Late\nAntiquity to the Middle Ages.\n\n\nJudah\u2019s theory of love, by contrast, was intimately connected\nto the literary interests of humanism and the aesthetic sensibilities\nof Renaissance\n artists.[45]  \n As a consequence, Judah faults previous\nthinkers for (1) not ascribing love to God and (2) confining their\ndiscussion of love primarily to that between humans, thereby ignoring\nthe dynamic role of God in relationships based on this principle. \nUsing the name of Plato as a metonym for other philosophers, he is\ncritical of this approach:\n\n\n\nPlato in his Symposium discusses only the kind of love that\nis found in men, which has its final cause in the lover but not in the\nbeloved (terminato ne l\u2019amante ma non ne l\u2019amato),\nfor this kind mainly is called love, since that which ends in the loved\none is called friendship and benevolence (ch\u00e9 quel che si\ntermina ne l\u2019amato si chiama amicizia e\nbenivolenzia). He rightly defines this love as a desire of\nbeauty (desiderio di bellezza). He says that such love\nis not found in God, because that which desires beauty and\ndoesn\u2019t have it is not beautiful, and God, who is the highest\nbeauty, does not lack beauty nor can he desire it, whence he cannot\nhave love, that is, of such a kind (Tale amore dice che non si\ntruova in Dio, per\u00f2 che quel che desia bellezza non\nl\u2019ha n\u00e9 \u00e8 bello, e a Dio, che \u00e8 sommo\nbello, non gli manca bellezza n\u00e9 la pu\u00f2 desiare,\nonde non pu\u00f2 avere amore, cio\u00e8 di tal\n sorte).[46]\n\n\n\nJudah seeks to provide a corrective to this and, in the process,\noffer what he considers to be a more comprehensive theory of\nlove. In particular, he intertwines love and beauty such that the\nlover of beauty seeks to unite with the source of beauty, something\nthat the lover subsequently seeks to reproduce himself (the lover is\nalways male, according to Judah because it is responsible for\nimpregnating the passive and receptive female principle). This\ncan take the form of God\u2019s creation of the universe, the\nartist\u2019s creation of a work of art, and the philosopher\u2019s\ncomposition of a pleasing work of philosophy. In his discussion\nof love, Judah also departs from other Renaissance thinkers. Whereas\nFicino had equated human love with sensual love between humans, Judah,\ndrawing upon Maimonidean precedents, resignifies human love as, on one\nlevel, that which the intellect has for\n God.[47]\n\n\nPerhaps, Judah\u2019s biggest departure from earlier thinkers is\nhis ascription of love to God. Here, however, his discussion is\nnot entirely new; rather, he picks up on a number of issues discussed\nin the work of Hasdai Crescas (ca. 1340\u2013ca. 1410), the important critic\nof Aristotelianism and Maimonideanism. For Crescas, breaking from\nboth the Platonic and Aristotelian positions, love need not be\nassociated with privation or imperfection:\n\n\n\nInasmuch as it is known that God, may He be blessed, is the sources\nand fountain of all perfection, and in virtue of his perfection, which\nis His essence, He loves the good, as may be seen from His actions in\nbringing into existence the entire universe, sustaining it perpetually,\nand continuously creating it anew, and all be means of His simple will,\nit must necessarily be that the love of the good is an essential\nproperty of perfection. It follows from this that the greater\nperfection [of the lover] the greater will be the love and the pleasure\nin the\n desire.[48]\n\n\n\nLove, for Crescas, is tantamount to God\u2019s creative\nactivity. In the third book of the Dialoghi Judah picks\nup this theme:\n\n\n\nDivine Love (L\u2019amor divino) is the inclination\n(tendenzia) of God\u2019s most beautiful wisdom toward the\nlikeness of His own beauty, to wit, the universe created by Him,\ntogether with its return to union with His supreme wisdom; and His\npleasure is the perfect union of His image with Himself (la\nperfetta unione di sua immagine in se stesso), and of His\ncreated universe with Himself as\n Creator.[49]\n\n\n\nJudah\u2019s subsequent discussion of love, however, departs\nsignificantly from either Crescas or other Renaissance thinkers. \nThis is especially the case when it comes to Judah\u2019s refusal to\nabnegate sensual love. Rather, he celebrates such love as the\ngateway to cosmic or spiritual love.   Sensual love, for him,\nbecomes that which orientates the individual towards the Divine. \nUnlike Crescas, however, Judah does not reject the Maimonidean concept\nof God as divine intellect. Furthermore, Judah\u2019s discussion\nfinds no homolog in the thought of Crescas or even Maimonides when it\ncomes to the concept of God\u2019s beauty.\n5.2 \u201cThe Circle of Love\u201d (il circulo degli amari)\n\n\nNear the end of the third dialogue, Judah introduces the\n\u201ccircle of love,\u201d il circulo degli amari, as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nThe circle of all things (il circulo di tutte) begins from\ntheir first origin, and passing successively through each thing in\nturn, returns to its first origin as to its ultimate end (ultimo\nfine), thus containing every degree of being in its circular form\n(comprendendo tutti li gradi de le cose a modo circulare), so\nthat the point which is the beginning also comes to be the end. \nThis circle has two halves (due mezzi), the first from the\nbeginning to the point most distant from it, the mid-point, and the\nsecond from this mid-point to the beginning\n again.[50]\n\n\n\nThis circle, in other words, begins with the divine, whose love\ncreates and sustains the universe: \u201ceach degree of being with\npaternal love procreates its immediate inferior, imparting its being or\npaternal beauty to it, although in a lesser degree as is only\n fitting.\u201d[51]\n This emanative framework, the love of that which is more beautiful for\nthat which is less beautiful, comprises the first half of the\ncircle. Every thing in the universe exists on a hierarchical\nchain of being, from the pure actuality of the divine to the pure\npotentiality of prime matter. Just as the superior desires the\nperfection of the inferior, the inferior desires to unite with the\nsuperior. The first half of the circle spans from God to utter\nchaos, whereas, the second half of this circle works in reverse. \nIt is the love of the inferior for the superior, predicated on the\nformer\u2019s privation and subsequent desire to unite with the\nsuperior.\n6. The End of Human Life\n\n\nThe telos of Judah\u2019s system occurs when the intellect\nis \u201cabsorbed in the science of the Divine and of things\nabstracted from matter, rejoicing in and becoming enamored of the\nhighest grace and beauty which is in the creator and artificer of all\nthings, so that it attains its ultimate\n happiness.\u201d[52] \n Within this\ncontext, Judah employs a well-known and well-used metaphor in his\ndiscussion of the imaginative faculty, that of the mirror\n (specchio).[53]\n In the medieval Islamicate philosophical tradition,\nfollowing Plotinus, the mirror (Ar. mir\u2019\u00e2), is\nfrequently used as an image for the perfected soul, at whose vanguard\nresides the\n intellect.[54] \n Just as the mirror reflects what is placed in\nfront of it, the soul, in a state of perfection, reflects the higher\nprinciples of the universe. Early on in the Dialoghi,\nPhilo asks Sophia, \u201cDo you not see how the form of man is\nimpressed on and received by a mirror, not as a complete human being,\nbut within the limits of the mirror\u2019s powers and capabilities,\nwhich reflect the figure only and not the\n essence.\u201d[55] \n Later, in dialogue\nthree, he argues that it is through our own \u201cintellectual\nmirror\u201d that we apprehend the divine:\n\n\n\nIt is enough for our intellectual mirror (specchio\nintellettuale) to receive and image (figurare) the\ninfinite divine essence (l\u2019immensa essenzia divina)\naccording to the capacity of its intellectual nature; though there is a\nmeasureless gulf fixed between them, so far does its nature fall short\nof that of the object of its\n understanding.[56]\n\n\n\nBy corporealizing the spiritual and spiritualizing the\ncorporeal,  the intellect, in tandem with the imagination, enables\nindividuals to gain knowledge of the divine world. Unlike\nMaimonides and other medieval Aristotelians who equated the natural\nworld with impermanence and evil, Judah argues that this world is the\nnatural receptacle of heavenly powers: \u201cHence earth is the proper\nand regular consort of heaven, whereof the other elements are but\nparamours. For it is upon the earth that heaven begets all on the\ngreater part of its\n progeny.\u201d[57] \n In an interesting passage, Judah, like\nMaimonides before him, compares matter to a\n harlot.[58] \n Yet, unlike Maimonides, he\nreaches a radically different conclusion. For Judah, \u201cit is\nthis adulterous love that beautifies the lower world with such wondrous\nvariety of the fair-formed\n things.\u201d[59] \n In keeping with Judah\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cthe lower can be found in the\n higher,\u201d[60]\n this world becomes one\ngigantic mirror that reflects spiritual beauty, and in which one can\ngrasp divine\n intelligibles.[61] \n Just as Philo is enthralled by Sophia\u2019s\nbeauty, the individual, upon contemplating physical objects that are\nbeautiful, apprehends the divine:\n\n\n\nGod has implanted His image and likeness in His creatures through\nthe finite beauty imparted to them from His surpassing beauty. \nAnd the image of the infinite must be finite, otherwise it would not be\na copy, but that of which it is the image. The infinite beauty of\nthe Creator is depicted and reflected in finite created beauty like a\nbeautiful face in a mirror and although the image is not commensurate\nwith its divine pattern, nonetheless it will be its copy, portrait, and\ntrue likeness (Si depinge e immagina la bellezza infinita del\ncreatore ne la bellezza finita creata come una bella figura in uno\nspecchio: non per\u00f2 commisura l\u2019immagine il divino\nimmaginato, ma bene gli sar\u00e1 simulacro similitudine e\n immagine).[62]\n\n\n\nIt is ultimately the love of beauty in the soul of the individual,\ncombined with the cognizance that one lacks it in its entirety, that\nmoves not only the soul of the individual, but also the entire\ncosmos. Virtuous love, which Philo answers in response to\nSophia\u2019s fourth question concerning the parents of love, is the\nhighest form of love and, significantly, one can have this for either\ncorporeal or spiritual things. Indeed, Philo intimates that such\nvirtuous love can only emerge from sensible\n phenomena:[63]\n\n\nWhen [the soul] perceives a beautiful person whose beauty is in\nharmony with itself, it recognizes in and through this beauty, divine\nbeauty, in the image of which this person is also\n made.[64]\n\n\nThe goal of Judah\u2019s system is to ascend through this\nhierarchy, that gateway to which is the sensual enjoyment that one\nderives from physical objects. Only after this can one appreciate\nspiritual beauty, an appreciation of which culminates in basking in the\ndivine presence. Judah discusses this process in the following\nmanner:\n\n\n\nWe ought principally to love the higher forms of beauty separated\nfrom formless matter and gross corporeality (amiamo le grandi\nbellezze separate da la deforme material e brutto corpe)\n,  such as the virtues and the sciences, which are ever beautiful\nand devoid of all ugliness and defect. Here again we may ascend\nthrough a hierarchy of beauty from the lesser to the greater\n(ascendiamo per le minori a le maggiori bellezze) and from the\npure to the purest leading to the knowledge and love, not only of the\nmost beautiful intelligences, souls and motors of the heavenly bodies,\nbut also of the highest beauty and of the supremely beautiful, the\ngiver of all beauty, life, intelligence and being. We may scale\nthis ladder only when we put away earthly garments and material\naffection (potremo fare quando noi abbandonaremo le vesti corporee\ne le passioni \n materiali)\u2026[65]\n\n\n\nEven though the corporeal was, at the outset of this journey,\nindispensable; the higher one moves up the hierarchy the less important\nthe material becomes. As far as the individual is concerned, the\nhighest felicity resides in the union with God, which the Italian\ndescribes erotically as felice coppulativa:\n\n\n\nBecause the love of the human soul is twofold, it is directed not\nonly towards the beauty of the intellect, but also towards the image of\nthat beauty in the body. It happens that at times the love of\nintellectual beauty is so strong that it draws the soul to cast off all\naffection for the body; thus the body and soul in man fall apart, and\nthere follows the joyful death in union with the divine (la morte\nfelice \n coppulativa).[66]\n\n7. Reception History and Influence\n\n\nOne of the most surprising features concerning the reception history\nof the Dialoghi is that a work of Jewish philosophy would\nsubsequently become a European bestseller among non-Jews. In the\nyears immediately following its Italian publication, the\nDialoghi was translated into virtually every European\nvernacular. This popularity might be the result of the prominent\nrole that grace (grazia) plays in the Dialoghi or the\nfact that Judah frequently stresses the interlocking relationship\nbetween the corporeal and the spiritual, something that seems to have\nresonated with contemporaneous Christian treatments of the incarnation\nin literary\n fiction.[67]\n\n\nThis popularity of the work has led some to posit that Judah\nAbrabanel\u2019s thought is epigonic, responsible for disseminating\nthe thought of \u201cgreat thinkers\u201d such as Marsilio Ficino\n(1433\u20131499) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463\u20131494) to a wider\naudience. This essay\u2019s point of departure, however, has\nbeen that the thought of Judah Abrabanel, while dependent upon certain\nfeatures of these earlier thinkers, nevertheless makes significant\ndepartures from them in terms of his construction of an overarching\nsystem that revolves around the twin principles of love and beauty\n\n\nParadoxically, the initial response of Jews to the Dialoghi\nwas for the most part negative. Some of the earliest criticisms,\nespecially those of Saul ha-Kohen Ashkenazi, fault Judah with\nrationalizing kabbalistic principles. Ashkenazi, in a letter to\nDon Isaac Abrabanel, criticizes Judah for his lack of philosophical\nesotericism, and for spending too much time on linguistic matters, such\nas riddles and eloquence. Such antagonism reflects the broader\ncontext of the Maimonidean controversies, in which philosophers sought\nto make philosophy known to a broader Jewish public often by means of\ndramatic dialogues or philosophical novels. Those opposed to the\nAristotelian-Maimonidean paradigm of philosophy often blamed such\ntreatises for weakening the faith of Jews by diminishing their\ncommitment to the halakhah (law) and, thus, making them more\nsusceptible to conversion.   Despite such initial criticisms,\nhowever, subsequent generations stressed the interrelationship between\nPlatonism and kabbalah on the one hand, and philosophy and aesthetics\non the other. Notable individuals include Azariah de Rossi (d.\nca. 1578) and Judah Moscato (d. ca. 1594).\n\n\nThe actual influence that the Dialoghi would have on\nsubsequent thinkers is more difficult to judge. Essentially,\nJudah adopted certain trajectories of medieval cosmology and\npsychology, combined them with Renaissance notions of beauty, and\nthereby created a full-blown aesthetics of Judaism. This led him\nto conceive of the universe as a living, dynamic structure, in which\nall levels share in a symbiotic and organic relationship. Unlike\nmany of his medieval predecessors, he did not define this world, the\nworld of form and matter, in terms of privation or its distance from\nthe divine. On the contrary, he envisages this world as the arena\nwherein individuals encounter, through sensual particulars, the beauty\nand love of the divine.   Abrabanel\u2019s emphasis, like\nthat of many of his Renaissance contemporaries, on aesthetics and the\nphenomenal world would eventually become an important dimension of\n16th- and 17th -century natural philosophy. We do know, for\nexample, that Baruch Spinoza had a copy of the Dialoghi in his\nlibrary.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Edi\">Editions</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Edi\">Editions</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Abrabanel, Judah (Ebreo, Leone). <em>Dialoghi d\u2019amore</em>.
