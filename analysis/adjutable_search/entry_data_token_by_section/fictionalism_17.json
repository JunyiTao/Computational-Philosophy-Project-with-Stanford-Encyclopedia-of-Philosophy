Here are two examples.\n\n(1) Paraphrase. Since long before fictionalism really came into vogue,\nphilosophers have liked to appeal to paraphrase: it has often been\nclaimed that sentences which seem to express such-and-such\npropositions, really only express such-and-such other propositions.\n(E.g., it sounds as if you are genuinely talking about material\nobjects, but really you are only claiming something about actual and\npossible sense-data.) Often such appeals to paraphrase have foundered\nupon the details: telling objections have shown how the paraphrases\nfail to deal with all the sentences within the purview of the\nproposal. Objections to some fictionalist theories that have been\nproposed take a similar form, since some fictionalists in effect offer\nparaphrases. Take for instance van Inwagen\u2019s (1985) objection to\nfictionalism about fictional characters, as espoused for instance by\nKendall Walton (1985, 1990, 2000). Consider van Inwagen\u2019s pair\nof sentences,\n\n\n(S1) There is a fictional character who, for every novel, either\nappears in that novel or is a model for a character who does.\n\n\nand\n\n\n(S2) If no character appears in every novel, then some character is\nmodeled on another character.\n\n\nSentence (S1) seems to entail sentence (S2), but, the charge is, the\nparaphrases offered by Walton do not respect this. The paraphrases\nthat Walton offers are of the form \u201cTo engage in pretense of\nkind K is fictionally to speak truly in a game of such-and-such a\nsort\u201d: but then the paraphrase of (S2) is not entailed by the\nparaphrase of (S1). There is naturally much that can be said about the\nobjection. (The reply Walton (2000) himself gives is that the claim\nthat (S1) entails (S2) is itself pretend-true.) Essentially the same\nsort of objection is pressed by Richard (2000), Stanley (2001) and\nKroon (2004) against Mark Crimmins\u2019 (1998) fictionalism about\npropositional attitude talk and discourse involving empty names.\n\n(2) In his (2005a) defense of a version of moral fictionalism, Mark\nKalderon argues that would-be non-cognitivists who seek to avoid the\nFrege-Geach problem (for a presentation of this problem see the\nEmbedding Problem section of the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism)\n should adopt a version of moral fictionalism. The resulting theory\nwould be one according to which moral sentences have ordinary\nrepresentational contents, but acceptance of moral sentences does not\namount to belief in the literal truth of these contents but rather\nonly to holding a non-cognitive attitude toward them. The reason why\nthis is supposed to get around the Frege-Geach problem would be that\narguments like\n\n\n(P1) Stealing is wrong.\n\n(P2) If stealing is wrong, then getting one\u2019s little brother to\nsteal is wrong.\n\n(C) So, getting one\u2019s little brother to steal is wrong.\n\n\nturn out on this revised non-cognitivist view to be straightforwardly\nvalid: for the proposition semantically expressed by the conclusion\nsentence is entailed by the propositions semantically expressed by the\npremise sentences.\n\nHowever, one may reasonably worry that the envisaged fictionalist move\ndoesn\u2019t in fact help at all with the Frege-Geach problem. For\nsomeone actually presenting an argument like this would be\npresenting a good argument. But for this to be so, what the arguer\nactually expresses by the premise sentence must provide good reason to\naccept what she actually expresses by the conclusion sentence. Since\nwhat the arguer actually expresses is, on the fictionalist view,\ndifferent from what the sentences she utters semantically express, it\nis not sufficient for the fictionalist to point to how the sentences\n(P1) and (P2), when taken literally, express propositions that entail\nthe proposition expressed by the sentence (C) taken literally.\nKalderon\u2019s moral fictionalist faces the problem of giving an\naccount that respects the fact that the argument actually put forward\nis valid. But this seems not to be essentially different from the\ntraditional non-cognitivist\u2019s problem of saying what the\nmeanings of the relevant sentences are such that the impression that\nthe argument is valid can be respected. (This objection to Kalderon\nwas stated, more briefly, in the original 2007 version of this entry,\nand was also presented, independently, in Lenman 2008. Kalderon\nreplied to it in his 2008a and 2008b, and Eklund 2009 is in turn a\nreply to Kalderon. See also ch. 6 of Miller 2013)\n",
