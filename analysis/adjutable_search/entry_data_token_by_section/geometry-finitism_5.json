    "main_text": "Some general considerations || Philosophers\n1.5 Philosophers\n\nIn a rather straightforward sense, all of the above involves\nphilosophers as well. Discussions about logical systems, about\nfoundational mathematical theories, about Zeno paradoxes, about\nsupertasks, about what a model and a representation are, \u2026, are\ntypically topics that belong to the domain of the philosophers. In\naddition they bring in arguments from other philosophical and/or\nscientific domains. Suppose that there are excellent arguments from an\nepistemological or ontological perspective, claiming that the world\nshould be considered discrete, then these arguments can support the\nsearch for such a discrete worldview, including the elaboration of a\ndiscrete geometry. Even if from the mathematical point of view, the\ntheory looks rather clumsy or difficult to work with, nevertheless,\nbecause of the philosophical considerations, it has to be so. Without\nsuch supporting arguments, one\u2019s position in such a case would\nbe much weaker. Finally, they also pay attention to the historical\nside of the matter. It is rather striking, but this will not be\npresented here, to see that many proposals have been put forward in\nthe course of our history to demonstrate that space, time and man\nshould be considered finite and/or discrete. See, e.g., Sorabji (1983)\nand Moore (1993) for excellent historical overviews, White (1992) for\ntwentieth-century developments, and Franklin (2017), Lyons (2017) and\nSewell (2022) for some recent contributions.\n\nAs said, these five groups are the most important ones so completeness\nhas not been demonstrated and neither has mutual exclusiveness been\nshown. This short overview is only meant to list the different\nintentions, motivations, purposes and methodologies of the parties\ninvolved.\n",
