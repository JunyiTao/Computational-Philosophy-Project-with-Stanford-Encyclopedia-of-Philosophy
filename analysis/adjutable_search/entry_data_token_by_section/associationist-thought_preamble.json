    "main_text": "\nAssociationism is one of the oldest, and, in some form or another,\nmost widely held theories of thought. Associationism has been the\nengine behind empiricism for centuries, from the British Empiricists\nthrough the Behaviorists and modern day Connectionists. Nevertheless,\n\u201cassociationism\u201d does not refer to one particular theory\nof cognition per se, but rather a constellation of related\nthough separable theses. What ties these theses together is a\ncommitment to a certain arationality of thought: a creature\u2019s\nmental states are associated because of some facts about its causal\nhistory, and having these mental states associated entails that\nbringing one of a pair of associates to mind will, ceteris\nparibus, ensure that the other also becomes activated.\n",
