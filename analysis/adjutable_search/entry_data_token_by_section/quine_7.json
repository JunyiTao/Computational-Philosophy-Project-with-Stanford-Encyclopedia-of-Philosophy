    "main_text": "The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism || Quine\u2019s Alternative\n3.2 Quine\u2019s Alternative\n\nIf logic, mathematics, and other putatively a priori parts of\nour knowledge, are not to be explained by analyticity, how are they to\nbe accounted for? Holism, which is central to Quine\u2019s argument\nagainst Carnap, also provides him with an alternative position. It\nseems as if logic and mathematics have a special status because they\nare independent of experience. They appear to be necessary and not\nsusceptible of refutation by what future experience brings; they\nappear to be a priori because we know them independent of\nexperience. Carnap sought to explain these appearances by appealing to\nthe idea that accepting an analytic sentence of a given language goes\nwith speaking that language, and to the Principle of Tolerance. Since\nchoice of language is not justified by experience, the truth of the\nanalytic sentences of a given language is not answerable to\nexperience.\n\nHow is Quine to explain the apparent necessity and a priori\nstatus of some truths without appeal to the Principle of Tolerance?\nQuine\u2019s holism is the view that almost none of our knowledge is\ndirectly answerable to experience. (The exceptions are what\nhe calls \u2018observation sentences\u2019; see 4.2, below.) In\nalmost all cases the relation is indirect: a given sentence is only\nanswerable to experience if a body of theory is presupposed. (When we\nsay that a given observation confirms or refutes a given theoretical\nclaim, we are tacitly presupposing other theoretical knowledge.) This\nis most easily seen if we consider a highly theoretical sentence, but\nin Quine\u2019s view it holds, of almost all our sentences. The\nreason to accept a sentence is its contribution to the success of\ntheory as a whole as an efficient and simple method of dealing with\nand predicting experience; in principle, this means the success of our\ntheory as a whole, the whole body of sentences that we accept, in\ndealing with experience as a whole.\n\nFor many of our sentences, this strong statement of holism holds only\nin principle. In practice, we may have a good idea what experiences\nwould lead us to change our minds about a given sentence, and what\nfurther changes in theory would follow. Elementary arithmetic (to take\nthat as an example) is different because it is involved in almost\nevery part of systematic knowledge. (In Quine\u2019s well-known\nmetaphor, it stands near the centre of the \u2018web of\nbelief\u2019.) Abandoning it would mean abandoning our whole system\nof knowledge, and replacing it with an alternative which we have not\neven begun to envisage. Nothing in principle rules out the possibility\nthat the course of experience will be such that our present system of\nknowledge becomes wholly useless, and that in constructing a new one\nwe find that arithmetic is of no use. But this is a purely abstract\npossibility, certainly not something we can imagine in any detail. So\nthe idea that we might reject arithmetic is likewise unimaginable;\nhence the truths of arithmetic appear to be necessary.\n\nFor similar reasons, arithmetic appears to be a priori. No\nparticular experience confirms \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019. (Quine is not\nadvancing what Frege derided as a \u2018gingerbread and pebble\u2019\naccount of arithmetic (Frege 1884, vii), in which the sentence is\njustified by our observations of cookies or stones.) Arithmetic is\nindependent of any particular experience, or any easily specifiable\nportion of experience; hence it appears as a priori. On\nQuine\u2019s account, it rests on our experience as a whole, and the\nfact that the theory which best accounts for that experience makes\nessential use of arithmetic.\n",
