    "main_text": "\n\nOne way of conceptualizing the structure of a science is that at any\ntime it contains ontologies, theories, and\nvalues (Kuhn 1962; Lakatos 1976; Laudan 1978, 1986). In this\nentry, we explore questions regarding the ontology, theoretical\nstructure, and values central to conservation biology. First,\nconservation biology as a discipline has expended a great deal of\nintellectual effort in articulating exactly what is its object of\nstudy and has settled on biodiversity as the answer. However, there is\na debate concerning what biodiversity is, and whether it should be\ncenter stage in the discipline. Second, conservation biology, though a\nscientific discipline with its theories, models, experiments, and\nfieldwork, also utilizes a variety of tools that do not fit into the\nabove categories. That is, some of its core tools are not theories or\nmodels in the ordinary sense. Thus, as a discipline, it is appears\ninterestingly unique and ultimately unlike ones that philosophers of\nscience have typically examined. Third, conservation biology was\noriginally articulated by the early pioneers as a \u201ccrisis\ndiscipline\u201d where certain types of normative concerns were at\nthe forefront. In fact, many have likened it to medicine insofar as it\nhas ethical foundations. In the medical case, it would be the\nwell-being of patients and in conservation biology it is the\nconservation of biodiversity. Thus, we should ask are the\ndiscipline\u2019s aims or values explicitly ethical or sociopolitical\nand to what extent are they controversial?\n",
