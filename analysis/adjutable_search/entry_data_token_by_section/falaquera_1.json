Falaquera as popularizer\n\n\nScholars of the past century have, in general, been quick to dismiss\nFalaquera as a mediocre and unoriginal thinker, and thus hardly worthy\nof our attention. While it is no doubt true that Falaquera himself did\nnot seek originality, research of the past decades has shown him\nto be a remarkably industrious, well-read, and impressive scholar.\nMoreover, in certain respects, as we shall see, Falaquera was quite\noriginal. That Falaquera did not seek originality is clear from his\nown statements. For example, he writes in his introduction to\nReshit Hokhmah (9):\n\n\nMost of my words concerning the sciences in this book are the words of\nthe leading philosophers and experts. I have myself not added anything\nnew other than to gather [their words] from their books.\n\n\nWhat then was he trying to do in such compilations?  Falaquera\u2019s\nagenda is clearly seen in his delightful little treatise, Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah (The Epistle of the Debate), whose subtitle is:\n\u201cIn Explanation of the Agreement that Exists between the Law and\nWisdom.\u201d At the outset of this treatise he makes known that its\npurpose is \u201cto explain that the study of the true sciences by\nwhoever is worthy of them and whom God in his mercy has favored with\nan intellect to discover their depths is not prohibited from the point\nof view of our Law, and that the truth hidden in them does not\ncontradict a word of our belief\u201d (56; trans., 14\u201315)\nUnlike the first two great Jewish Aristotelian philosophers of the\ncentury before him, Abraham Ibn Daud and Maimonides, who sought in the\nintroductions to their philosophico-theological works to dissuade the\nunworthy from reading on, Falaquera wished to awaken his\nco-religionists to the importance of philosophy. Falaquera, like his\ndistinguished predecessors, realized that philosophy is not for\neveryone. He explicitly stated that it \u201cis not necessary for all\nmen, but for the one who is meticulous in his faith and endeavors to\nascend the rank of the perfect man and to conceive what he conceives\nby way of the intellect, not by way of the imagination. As for the\nothers who do not perceive this degree, tradition without their\nknowing the reason is sufficient\u201d (65; trans., 29). Yet, there\nis a definite sense that Falaquera believed that philosophy could be\nof benefit to a far greater percentage of Jews than Ibn Daud or\nMaimonides thought. His Iggeret ha-Vikkuah, which is intended\nas an introduction to philosophy, provides a good indication of\nthis. It is a dialogue between a scholar and a pietist, both observant\nJews, in which the scholar \u2013 who investigates the secrets of\nwisdom and studies the philosophic books \u2013 tries to persuade the\npietist \u2013 who considers such books a stumbling-block and cause of\nheresy and therefore forbidden \u2013 of the permissibility and\ndesirability of philosophic study. The pietist is not perplexed and\nwould certainly not be considered by Maimonides among the few for whom\nhe intended the Guide, yet he is the type of reader Falaquera\nseeks to win over to philosophy. There may have been an additional\nreason for Falaquera\u2019s interest in persuading the pietist. Falaquera\nwrote during the respite between the Maimonidean controversy of the\n1230s and the controversy that culminated in 1305 with the ban issued\nby Solomon ibn Adret against the study of Greek philosophy and science\nby anyone under the age of twenty-five. In writing the Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah, he was influenced by the epistolary debate of the\nformer controversy between David Kimhi and Judah Alfakhar, and\napparently sought in his dialogue to have his scholar accomplish what\nKimhi and the other Maimonideans could not. Perhaps he hoped that if\nhe could counter in his debate the real objections of the\nanti-Maimonideans with sensitive convincing responses, he could\npersuade future anti-rationalists of the religious importance of\nphilosophy and the sciences and that the study of them was permissible\nand required of those who had the intellectual ability to undertake it\n(Harvey, \u201cMaimonidean Controversy of the 1230s\u201d). If he\nwished thereby to prevent future such controversies, he did not\nsucceed (cf. in this connection, his much later Mikhtav \u2018al\nDevar ha-Moreh, in defense of Maimonides\u2019 Guide). In any\ncase, by the end of the dialogue, the scholar indeed convinces the\npietist, and promises to write for him three books: Reshit\nHokhmah, Sefer ha-Ma\u2018alot, and De\u2018ot\nha-Filosofim. Falaquera in fact wrote this trilogy. These works\ncondense into three volumes the finest writings of the Greco-Islamic\nphilosophic tradition and offer the Hebrew reader a rich program of\neducation, beginning with a classification of the sciences and\nculminating with an encyclopedia of Aristotelian natural science and\nmetaphysics. For Falaquera, philosophy and science are necessary for a\ncomplete and true understanding of the Divine Law and for the\nattainment of ultimate human felicity. His goal in the trilogy seems\nto have been to interest his fellow Jews in philosophy and science and\nthen to educate them by making available to them the choicest fruits\nof the philosophic tradition in a form and language they could\nunderstand.  The Iggeret ha-Vikkuah was one attempt at\nleading his readers to philosophy and the path to perfection. Another\nattempt \u2013 quite well known to students of Hebrew\nliterature \u2013 whose maq\u00e2mah form bespeaks the\nauthor\u2019s desire to reach a wide audience and popularize philosophy,\nwas his Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, the tale of a young man\u2019s search\nfor wisdom.  The search concludes with the seeker\u2019s encounter with a\nphilosopher.\n",
