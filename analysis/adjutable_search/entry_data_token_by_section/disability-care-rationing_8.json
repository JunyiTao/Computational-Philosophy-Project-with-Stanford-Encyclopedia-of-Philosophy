These advocates have a point since\nprecisely this view can be seen in the pronouncements of respectable\nbioethicists who do assert that the \u201cdisabled life\u201d is\nfundamentally inferior (Kuhse & Singer 1985; Singer 1983; McKie et\nal. 1998). In the case of disability, for some writers, lower capacity\nto benefit is not an empirical conclusion, but an a priori\nassumption (Veach 1986; Harris 1986; Anand & Hanson 1997; Arneson\n& Nord 1999; Rock 2000; Koch 2000). CEA systematically\ndisadvantages people with disabilities because it is intrinsically\ndiscriminatory.\n\nAlthough Asch and others are certainly not attacking a straw person\nposition, the response might be that there is an empirical basis for\nthe claim that disability adversely affects the capacity to benefit\nfrom a health resource, namely the evidence that people with\ndisabilities tend to enjoy less quality of life improvement from these\nresources than those without disabilities. The strength of this\nrejoinder, however, depends very much on what is meant by\n\u201cquality of life\u201d. If understood as a subjective\nassessment or evaluation of one\u2019s life\u2014now more often\ncalled \u201csubjective well-being\u201d (Kahneman, Diener &\nSchwarz 1999)\u2014then there is good empirical evidence that\ndisability does not negatively affect capacity to\nbenefit. People with disabilities tend to be happier, and assess their\nlives to be of considerably higher value than would be objectively\nassumed\u2014a phenomenon called the \u201cdisability paradox\u201d\n(Albrecht & Devlieger 1999). \n\nThis may be granted, but it remains true that bioethicists who rely on\nthe notion of \u201cquality of life\u201d in this context tend to\nassume, usually without argument, that quality of life is an objective\nphenomenon that incorporates autonomy, accomplishments and a\nreasonable array of opportunities to live a full life (see, e.g.,\nBrock 1995, 2005). It is, of course, this objective sense that QALYs\nwas intended to quantify by means of evaluations of health states,\neither by population or expert ranking, or by means of preference\nelicitation techniques. Invariably these ranking exercises show that\nquality of life decreases directly with the severity of the disabling\ncondition.\n\nThe disability advocate might respond that QALYs and similar measures\nare simply not valid since the rankings are done by people who do not\nthemselves have first-hand experience with what it means to live with\na disability. Indeed there is some evidence that third-party\nassessments of the objective quality of life of people with\nimpairments\u2014either by health professionals or the general\npublic\u2014are systematically lower than self-assessments by people\nwith impairments (Ubel et al. 2003), and that this bias may well be\nthe result of distortion from cultural and other prejudices (Amundson\n2010).\n\nAgainst this it might be argued that whether or not a person with a\ndisability is in an epistemically-privileged position concerning the\nexperience of disability, this privilege need not extend to an\nobjective assessment of the actual physical and other burdens of\nliving with the disability (Brock 1995). Quite the contrary, because\nof the psychological dynamics of adaptation and adjustment, especially\nafter a traumatic injury, a person with a disability may well be in a\nworse position to assess his or her life objectively. Once adjusted,\nthe disabled person may grossly overestimate the value of living with\nthe disability, which, while perhaps not a bad thing, in this context\nhas the effect of distorting the individual\u2019s health and social\nneeds (Murray 1996; Menzel et al. 2002).\n\nEven if this debate about how QALYs should be developed is resolved,\nthis may have little impact on the dilemma mentioned. If disability\nobjectively reduces quality of life, then the expected overall benefit\nof a health resource will tend to be adversely affected and CEA will\ndisadvantage persons with disabilities; but on the other hand, if not,\nand disability does not impact on the capacity to benefit from a\nhealth resource, then people with disabilities will be disadvantaged\nby the provision of these resources that do not take their\ndisabilities into account. As Amaryta Sen helpfully explains the\npoint, the value of any resource is not constant across a population\nsince some differences between people affect their ability to\n\u201cconvert\u201d the resource into what is value, either\nobjectively, or to them alone (Sen 1999; Ruger 2010). There are\ndifferences between people that make a difference to the value\nextracted from the same resource, and disability is perhaps the\nclearest example of such a difference.\n\nThe QALY metric, however, is problematic for another reason. When\nevaluators are asked to rank the impact of a disability on quality of\nlife they are asked to consider the overall \u201cburden\u201d of\nliving with that decrement in health or functioning. Undoubtedly, part\nof that burden is the result of the social stigma, discrimination and\nlack of opportunities that characterizes the disabled life, in all\ncultures. People with disabilities typically have as a group the\nlowest employment and education participation rates of any\nsub-population (WHO 2011, Chapter 8), a fact that profoundly affects their quality of life,\nbut which has as much to do with failed policy to combat stigma and\nlack of accommodation as it does with the underlying health condition.\nYet the fact that the burden of living with a disability is caused as\nmuch by the social environment suggests that the QALY metric, even if\nit accurately describes the burden of disability, is unfair as a basis\nfor resource allocation (Wasserman, Asch, Bickenbach 2008). In effect\nwe are saying to the person with a disability that because stigma and\nfailed policy make your life less valuable, we are not going to\nimprove your life by giving you access to needed resources.\n\nOne of the most robust defenses of how the CEA approach deals with\ndisability comes in the form of Michael Stein\u2019s general defense\nof utilitarianism against forms of resource egalitarianism (Stein\n2006). Stein argues that only utilitarianism, by relying on the\ngreater benefit criterion of distributive justice, can handle our\nintuitions about disability when it comes to health care allocation.\nHe acknowledges that disability is conceptually related to ill-health\nor functional decrement (impairment), and, as a utilitarian takes that\nto mean that disability also reduces welfare\u2014and\nproportionately: the more severe the disability, the greater the\nwelfare loss. Because of this relationship, he argues that the\nutilitarian can precisely determine\u2014in welfare terms\u2014the\nimpact of a health benefit and this makes utilitarianism, overall, a\nfar better decision-making method for health care allocations.\nUnfortunately, on his own utilitarian terms, Stein\u2019s argument is\nflawed. For, as we have said, as long as welfare is a subjective\nnotion, there is no reason to think that there is a strict correlation\nbetween health and welfare deficit. Moreover, for a utilitarian\nconsequentialist, there is no a priori reason to think that a\nperson without a disability always experiences less welfare benefit\nthan a person with disability\u2014since there are domains other than\nhealth that impact welfare. On the other hand, if we are concerned\nabout maximizing welfare, rather than health, then we need to take\ninto account all consequential welfare advances that are linked to\nhealth improvements (opportunity to develop talents, better job\nprospects, or a more stable family life) and once that door is open,\nthere is no reason to think that disability will matter since these\nbenefits may, overall, greatly overwhelm the negative impact of\ndisability (Bickenbach 2008). \n\n",
