    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Predestination and Free Will\n6.4 Predestination and Free Will\n\n\nJohn Wycliff paid tribute to both Thomas Bradwardine and\nFitzRalph as the two Oxford teachers upon whom he relied most. \nHowever, on the question of predestination and free will, Wycliff\nfollowed Bradwardine and not FitzRalph. Wycliff\u2019s position on\npredestination contrasted sharply with FitzRalph\u2019s efforts to\nreconcile free will with a moderate acceptance of divine\npredestination. This might serve to explain why Wycliff quoted\nfrom the De Pauperie Salvatoris on dominion and from the\nSumma de Quaestionibus Armenorum on a wider range of\ntheological issues, but he never refers to the Lectures on the\nSentences. FitzRalph\u2019s strong emphasis on the primacy\nof the will in the Lectures was of little use to Wycliff when\nhe was working out his position, nor was FitzRalph it seems free from\nall traces of the doctrine that Bradwardine was to describe as\n\u2018Pelagian\u2019.\n\n\nIn the Summa de Quaestionibus Armenorum XV\u2013XVII, FitzRalph\nturned to topics of free will and predestination being concerned with\nwhat he regarded as a new heresy being spread in the schools. In\nlanguage more violent than anything found before the mendicant\ncontroversy, he expressed his horror at the new teaching, which he\ncalls a \u2018diabolical knowledge\u2019. Although Bradwardine\nwas not the object of FitzRalph\u2019s attack, it seems to be written\nin response to disciples of Bradwardine who had espoused an extreme\nform of predestinarianism from a reading of the De Causa\nDei. Predestinarianism reduces eternal salvation or\ndamnation to the sovereign will of God alone, and excludes free will as\na secondary factor in determining man\u2019s future state. Against an\nabsolute determinism FitzRalph held that the punishment of the damned\nwas just inasmuch as \u2018their sin or its futurity was the reason\nfrom eternity why God willed to damn the wicked, and not the contrary,\n(Summa, XVI, 12) and defended the free human choice. \nAlthough the background to the debate is clearly Augustinian (see City\nof God, V:10), it is interesting to note that FitzRalph in the\nSumma seeks also to justify his position on the basis of\nScripture.\n",
