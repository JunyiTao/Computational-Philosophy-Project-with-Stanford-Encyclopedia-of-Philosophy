European personalism\n\n\nIn the twentieth century personalists gathered especially around three\nEuropean centers of higher learning: Paris, Munich, and Lublin. Until\nrecently, the best known and most prolific of these three schools was\nthe Parisian group.  Between the First and Second World Wars the\nFrench personalist movement revolved around a monthly\njournal, Esprit, founded by Emmanuel Mounier\n(1905\u20131950) and a group of friends in 1932. In the face of\neconomic collapse and political and moral disorientation, these French\npersonalists proposed the human person as the criterion according to\nwhich a solution to the crisis was to be fashioned. The new,\nirreducible key to thought, especially regarding social organization,\nwas to be the human person. In his programmatic essay Refaire la\nRenaissance, which appeared in the first issue\nof Esprit, Mounier proposed the need to disassociate the\nspiritual world from the debased, materialistic bourgeoisie. In\nsubstance much in line with the late eighteenth- and early\nnineteenth-century origins of personalism, Mounier, before the Second\nWorld War, turned sharply against the impersonalistic development of\nindividualistic, parliamentary democracy and the mass culture that had\ncome to shape the countries of Western Europe. Both personalism\u2019s\nnineteenth-century background and this fact about the leading\ntwentieth-century European personalist indicate that for personalism,\na simple, uncritical endorsement of liberal democracy is not a\nsufficient guarantee against totalitarianism, since liberal democracy\ntoo tends to absorb the impersonalist ideas and the deep, historical\nimpersonalist dynamic clearly perceived and analysed by personalistic\nthinkers long before Mounier.\n\n\nPolitical and traditionalist religious reaction was not an alternative\nfor Mounier.  There had to be a real revolution, consisting in the\ncreation of a new humanism, where the bourgeois ideal of\n\u201chaving\u201d would yield to Christian \u201cbeing,\u201d a\nbeing in communion with others. The spiritual revolution envisioned by\nMounier was to be above all the work of committed witnesses to the\ntruth, who through their own interior renewal and living faith would\ngalvanize the masses into a new communal structure. Such a revolution\nentailed a triple commitment: denunciation, meditation, and technical\nplanning. Underlying this program was Mounier\u2019s bold conception of\nChristian experience, an experience of \u201ctragic optimism,\u201d\ncolored both by the drama of Christian existence and by the certainty\nof eschatological victory.  The Christian\u2019s most important virtue is\nthat of the heroic witness, far from the evasiveness or sentimentality\nof other, eviscerated strains of Christianity. Thus Mounier\u2019s idea of\nthe Christian as the watchful athlete engaged in spiritual combat\nprovided a stark response to Nietzsche\u2019s criticism of Christianity as\na religion of the weak. His assertion that there is no true progress\nwithout the dimension of transcendence countered the Marxist search\nfor an earthly paradise through class struggle. His acceptance of the\nimportance of psychology while reemphasizing man\u2019s freedom and\nresponsibility furnished an answer to Freud\u2019s instinct-centered\npsychoanalysis.\n\n\nMounier\u2019s work attracted the attention of important French thinkers\nsuch as Gabriel Marcel, Denis de Rougemont, and Jacques Maritain, who\nthrough their research, lectures, and writings helped develop French\npersonalist thought. Maritain, who worked with Mounier for a number of\nyears, was responsible for bringing French personalism to the United\nStates. After the war, European personalism, led by Mounier himself,\nadapted to and took a more uncritical view of liberal democracy, and\nMaritain played a role in drafting the 1948 United Nations Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Like other Thomistic personalists,\nMaritain criticized the frailty of certain widespread strains of\nScholasticism, and appealed to the important role of intuitive\nexperience in philosophy.\n\n\nThe French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (1913\u20132005), whose\nphilosophy was profoundly influenced by Husserlian phenomenology,\nwhile never identifying himself as a personalist, shared many of the\nconcerns and interests dear to personalists, and both benefited from\nand contributed to the development of personalistic thought in\nFrance. Gabriel Marcel was one of Ricoeur\u2019s philosophical\nmentors, and Ricoeur was also deeply influenced by his contact with\nEmmanuel Mounier, especially in the postwar years, 1946\u20131951. He\ncontributed essays to Esprit as well as the journal Le\nChristianisme social. Ricoeur drew on many of the themes most\nprecious to Mounier, such as the nature of human freedom and the\ncentrality of the human person vis-\u00e0-vis the state, though his\nown later development of these themes departed considerably from\nMounier\u2019s. He also shared personalism\u2019s rejection of\nmaterialism and of Cartesian dualism, and a rejection of abstractions\nin favor of concrete human reality. Perhaps the single greatest\nelement of Mounier\u2019s personalism adopted by Ricoeur, in fact,\nwas the impermissibility of withdrawal from political and social\nengagement.\n\n\nPersonalism in Germany was closely wedded to another philosophical\nschool, phenomenology, developed by Austrian-born Edmund Husserl\n(1859\u20131938).  Like existentialism and French personalism,\nphenomenological realism was partly a response to German idealism,\nthough it bore a distinctive focus on epistemological questions. In\nhis Logische Untersuchungen, published in 1900, as well as\nhis later Ideen zu einer reinen Ph\u00e4nomenologie und\nph\u00e4nomenologischen Philosophie (1913), Husserl laid out his\nphenomenological method, and through it he attracted the first\nstudents of his school. The distinguishing characteristic of\nphenomenology is not doctrinal, but methodological. Seeking to avoid\nthe imposition of preconceived notions or structures on reality,\nphenomenology goes \u201cback to the thing\u201d (zur\u00fcck\nzum Gegenstand) by bracketing (epoch\u00e9) all\nphilosophical presuppositions about the world, man, and the rest of\nreality. This direct observation and consultation of reality eschews\nthe problems of deductive reasoning by focusing on the intellectual\nact of intuition, or direct apprehension of reality. The eidetic\nreduction focuses on the essential structures of what appears\n(phenomenon), so that one is dealing neither with empirical\nobservation nor with a description of Platonic forms, but with the\nphenomenon\u2019s meaning. Phenomenologists identified the object of\nintuition as the essences of things, ideal objects, and structures of\nintentionality and consciousness. In so doing, they sought to overcome\nthe Kantian noumenon/phenomenon dichotomy as well as the errors of\npositivism and nominalism.\n\n\nThough in his later life Husserl leaned toward philosophical idealism,\nin his earlier life and in Logische Untersuchungen he embraced\nphilosophical realism. A realist phenomenology stresses\nphenomenology\u2019s contribution to perennial philosophy, and seeks to\nexplore through experience the ultimate structures of being. By going\nback to the thing itself, phenomenology aimed at eluding the errors of\nboth empiricism (reducing reality to the measurable) and idealism\n(rarefying reality into abstraction and subjectivism). Among Husserl\u2019s\nstudents were Max Scheler (1874\u20131928), Dietrich von Hildebrand\n(1889\u20131977), Roman Ingarden (1893\u20131970) and Edith Stein\n(1891\u20131942), all of whom influenced the development of\npersonalist thought. Husserl\u2019s later turn to Idealism, which came\nabout in the 1920s, precipitated a break with many of his disciples,\nwho came to believe that he had abandoned his original commitment to\nreconnect philosophical reflection and objective reality. They\ntherefore struck out on their own, each creating an original body of\nwork in pursuit of Husserl\u2019s original intention. Stein, for instance,\nlooked to phenomenological method as a complement to Thomism, and von\nHildebrand introduced phenomenology into ethics in a personalistic\nsynthesis.\n\n\nThe third and youngest of the three centers of European personalistic\nthought grew up around the Catholic University of Lublin. After\nstudying with Husserl, Roman Ingarden took phenomenology and interest\nin personalist topics back to his native Poland in the early 1940s,\nand there he met a young priest by the name of Karol Wojty\u0142a,\nwhom he encouraged to read Max Scheler. Wojty\u0142a became interested\nin Scheler\u2019s phenomenology and ended up doing his doctoral\ndissertation on Scheler\u2019s ethics of values, which he presented in\n1953. Having previously received an Aristotelian-Thomistic formation,\nWojty\u0142a drew from his studies of the phenomenological method to\ndevelop a creative and original personalistic synthesis, complementing\nThomistic metaphysics and anthropology with insights from\nphenomenology. He subsequently took a post as professor of ethics at\nthe Theological Faculty of Krakow and Lublin\u2019s Catholic University,\nwhere he founded the Polish personalist school. Wojty\u0142a, who was\nalso influenced by the writings of another of Husserl\u2019s disciples, von\nHildebrand, produced two significant personalist books, Love and\nResponsibility (1960) and The Acting Person (1962), as\nwell as numerous essays, lectures and articles. His later election as\npope contributed strongly to the spread of personalist thought,\nespecially among Catholic thinkers. As Pope he continued to employ\npersonalist arguments in his magisterial teaching, and spurred new\ninterest in personalist theories. John Paul called for\n\u201ctheological renewal based on the personalistic nature of\nman\u201d and explicitly invoked the personalist argument in his\nencyclical letters Laborem Exercens (1981) and Ut Unum\nSint (1995) as well as his 1994 Letter to Families.\n\n\nPersonalism has also been represented, to varying degrees, in many\nother European countries.\n",
