    "main_text": "Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s Theory of Semantic Information || Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic information\n1.2 Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic information\n\nLuciano Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic\ninformation (2004, 2005), is a response to BCP motivated by the\nbelief that something has gone essentially amiss with Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s theory. The suspicion is that their theory is based on\na semantic principle that is too weak, namely that truth-values\nare independent of semantic information. Floridi\u2019s proposal\nis that an approach according to which semantic information is factive\ncan avoid the paradox, and that the resulting theory is more in line\nwith our ordinary conception of what generally counts as information.\nThe line of argument is that a theory of strongly semantic\ninformation, based on alethic and discrepancy values rather than\nprobabilities, can successfully avoid BCP. Relatedly, see Bremer and\nCohnitz (2004: chap. 2) for an overview of Floridi\u2019s theory to\nbe described below, and Sequoiah-Grayson (2007) for a defence of the\ntheory of strongly semantic information against independent objections\nfrom Fetzer (2004) and Dodig-Crnkovic (2005).\n\nBefore we expound Floridi\u2019s approach, note that some have\nproposed a different alethic approach, one that uses truthlikeness, or\nverisimilitude, to explicate the notion of semantic\ninformation\u2014Frick\u00e9 (1997), Cevolani (2011, 2014), and\nD\u2019Alfonso (2011). Typically these seek to identify factual\ninformation with likeness to the complete truth about all empirical\nmatters or about some restricted relevant domain of factual interest.\nThese also avoid the BCP, and also do not use probabilities. However,\ntruthlikeness is different from truth itself in as much as a truth\nbearer can be truth-like without actually being true, i.e., while\nbeing false, so that verisimilitude accounts of information can permit\nthat false claims may possess information. Indeed false statements can\nsometimes carry more information than their true negations on this\naccount, see Frick\u00e9 (1997).\n\nBy contrast, Floridi\u2019s strongly semantic factive information is\ndefined as well-formed, meaningful, and truthful data. This\nlatter factivity constraint on semantic information has come to be\nknown commonly as the veridicality thesis (VT) (prefigured in\nMingers (1995, 1996a, 1996b)). Importantly, versions of VT arise in\ndebates about the ontological status of information in general, not\nmerely with regard to semantic information in particular\u2014see\nDretske (1981) for a classic example. Once the content is so defined,\nthe quantity of strongly semantic information in a proposition \\(p\\)\nis calculated in terms of the distance of \\(p\\)\nfrom a situation \\(z\\) (where\nsituations are partial or incomplete worlds) that \\(p\\)\nis supposed to model.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) is true in all cases, but also when \\(p\\)\nis false in all cases, there is maximal distance (as\nopposed to maximal closeness) between \\(p\\) and the\nsituation \\(z\\) that \\(p\\) is supposed\nto model. By contrast, maximum closeness is equivalent to the\nprecise modelling of \\(z\\) at the agreed level of\nabstraction or descriptive adequacy. Maximal distance in the\ndirection of truth will result in \\(p\\) being true in\nall cases in which case \\(p = \\mathord{\\top}\\) and is minimally\ninformative. Similarly, maximal distance in the direction of falsity\nresults in \\(p\\) being false in all cases (all possible\nsituations or probability 0) in which case \\(p = \\mathord{\\perp}\\) and\nis minimally informative also. The important difference here is that\nany distance in this direction is distance bereft of strongly\nsemantic information entirely. This is on account of distance in\nthe direction of \u201cthe false\u201d violating the factivity\ncondition on strongly semantic information.\n\nFloridi distinguishes informativeness from strongly semantic\ninformation itself. This is welcome, since strongly semantic\ninformation is factive, whereas false statements can still be\ninformative. Indeed a false statement \\(s\\) may be\nmore informative than a true statement \\(s'\\), in spite of\nthe fact that \\(s'\\) carries strongly semantic information whereas \\(s\\)\ndoes not. By way of example, suppose that you are\nrunning a catering contract for an event, and that there will in fact\nbe exactly 200 people in attendance. Suppose that \\(s\\)\nis there will be 201 people in attendance, and \\(s'\\) is\nthere will be between 100 and 200 people in attendance.\n\\(s'\\) is true whilst \\(s\\) is false, but \\(s\\)\nis more informative than \\(s'\\) on any natural\nunderstanding of the concept informative.\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma\\) is a piece of strongly semantic (hence true)\ninformation, and \\(z\\) is the target situation that it\ndescribes with total accuracy, the more distant \\(\\sigma\\) gets from\n\\(z\\), the larger the number of situations to which it\napplies and the lower its degree of informativeness. Floridi uses\n\u2018\\(\\Theta\\)\u2019 to refer to the distance between a true\n\\(\\sigma\\) and \\(z\\) (recall that Floridi is not\ninterested in non-factive information, and might well deny that there\nis any sensible such commodity). \\(\\Theta\\) indicates the degree of\nsupport offered by \\(z\\) to \\(\\sigma\\). Given a\nspecific \\(\\sigma\\) and a corresponding target \\(z\\),\nFloridi maps the values of \\(\\Theta\\) onto the x-axis of a Cartesian\ndiagram. We now need a formula to calculate the degree of\ninformativeness \\(\\iota\\) of\n\\(\\sigma\\)\u2014\\(\\iota(\\sigma)\\)\u2014in relation to\n\\(\\Theta(\\sigma)\\). Floridi\u2019s proposal is that we calculate the\nvalue of \\(\\iota(\\sigma)\\) via the complement of the distance of\n\\(\\Theta(\\sigma)\\) squared:\n\\[\\iota(\\sigma) = 1 - \\Theta(\\sigma)^2\\]\n\nValues of \\(\\iota\\) range from 0 to 1 and are mapped along the y-axis\nof the Cartesian diagram.\n Figure 1\n shows the graph generated by\n (10)\n when we include negative values for false \\(\\sigma\\). \\(\\Theta\\)\nranges from \\(-1 = \\mathord{\\perp}\\) to \\(1 = \\mathord{\\top}\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nResponses and extensions\n\nFloridi (2012) extends the theory of strongly semantic information\ninto matters of traditional epistemology. His network theory of\naccount involves an argument for the claim that should strongly\nsemantic information be embedded within a network of questions and\nanswers that account for it correctly, then this is necessary and\nsufficient for the strongly semantic information to count as\nknowledge. Floridi (2008) develops a theory of\nrelevant semantic information in order to articulate a theory\nof epistemic relevance. Here he argues that the nature of\nrelevant semantic information is an additional vindication of the\nveridicality thesis. In Floridi (2011) he further explores just what\nit might, or should mean for semantic information to be true. Rather\nthan accept a correspondence, coherence, or pragmatic theory of truth,\nhe develops what he calls a correctness theory of truth for\nthe veridicality thesis, one which connects directly with his network\ntheory of account described above.\n\nFloridi (2006) argues that the modal logic KTB is well placed to play\nthe role of a logic of being informed (KTB is system\nB described in the entry on\n modal logic.)\n KTB itself licenses a version of the veridicality thesis within the\ncontext of being informed, \\(I_\\alpha p\\to p\\) (where \\(I\\)\nis a universal modal operator, on account of the\naxiom \\(\\square p\\to p\\) being an axiom of KTB). \u201cBeing\ninformed\u201d is understood as a cognitive state distinct from both\nknowledge and belief. Allo (2011) provides a formal semantics for the\nlogic of being informed, in both pure and applied versions. Primiero\n(2009) rejects the veridicality thesis for a logic of\nbecoming informed. Primiero\u2019s logic of becoming\ninformed is a logic of epistemic constructive information, within\nwhich the definition of information requires it to be kept distinct\nfrom truth. Epistemic constructive information understands information\nfor propositional content in terms of proof-conditions as opposed to\ntruth-conditions.\n\nMore broadly, Dinnen and Brauner (2015) search for a single definition\nof information (be it semantic or not) and find the veridicality\nthesis to be obstructive. By contrast, Mingers and Standing (2018)\nargue for a single definition of information that supports the\nveridicality thesis. Allo (2007) preempts such concerns with an\nargument for an informational pluralism (analogous to a\n logical pluralism,\n see the entry) via a realist interpretation of semantic\ninformation itself. A realist interpretation of semantic information\nleads naturally to the question of how it is that semantic information\ncan emerge from and be a part of the natural world\u2014a question\nthat is addressed in detail in Vakarelov (2010). The question of how\nit might be that information could be accounted for naturalistically\nhas a rich history in philosophy, most notably in informational\nsemantics covered in the following section.\n\nAlthough Floridi\u2019s, and Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s stance on\nsemantic information is not uncontroversial ( sans an\ninformational pluralism that is), Floridi\u2019s motivating intuition\nhas some philosophical precedent. Firstly, it is unlikely that many\nare satisfied with Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s claim that \u201cA\nself-contradictory sentence asserts too much; it is too informative to\nbe true\u201d. Secondly, with regard to logical truths having zero\nsemantic information on Floridi\u2019s account, recall that as\nWittgenstein put it with typical bluntness\u2014\u201cAll the\npropositions of logic say the same thing, viz nothing. They are\ntautologies\u201d (Tractatus, 4.46, 6.1). One way to\nunderstand Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic information is\nas a theory of the information we get from and about our particular\nobjective physical environment, as our physical environment is one\nabout which contradictions and logical truths are typically maximally\nuninformative. Semantic conceptions of information designed to tell a\nnaturalistic story about the content of our putatively referring terms\nhave a rich history of their own in philosophy, and this is the topic\nto which we now turn.\n",
