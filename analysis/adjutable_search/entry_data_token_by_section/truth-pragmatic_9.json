    "main_text": "Critical Assessments || Three Classic Objections and Responses\n5.2 The Fundamental Objection\n\nOne long-standing and still ongoing objection is that pragmatic\ntheories of truth are anti-realist and, as such, violate basic\nintuitions about the nature and meaning of truth: call this \u201cthe\nfundamental objection\u201d. The source of this objection rests with\nthe tendency of pragmatic theories of truth to treat truth\nepistemically, by focusing on verifiability, assertibility, and other\nrelated concepts. Some (see, e.g., Schmitt 1995; Nolt 2008) have\nargued that, by linking truth with verifiability or assertibility,\npragmatic theories make truth too subjective and too dependent on our\ncontingent ability to figure things out, as opposed to theories that,\nfor example, appeal to objective facts as truth-makers. Others have\nargued that pragmatic theories cannot account for what Peirce called\nburied secrets: statements that would seem to be either true or false\ndespite our inability to figure out which (see de Waal 1999, Howat\n2013, and Talisse & Akin 2008 for discussions of this). For\nsimilar reasons, some have accused pragmatic theories of denying\nbivalence (Allen-Hermanson 2001). Whatever form the objection takes,\nit raises a common concern: that pragmatic theories of truth are\ninsufficiently realist, failing both to account for truth\u2019s\nobjectivity and to distinguish truth from the limitations of actual\nepistemic practice. What results, accordingly, is not a theory of\ntruth, but rather a theory of justification, warranted assertibility,\nor some other epistemic concept.\n\nThis objection has persisted despite inspiring a range of responses.\nAt one extreme some, such as Rorty, have largely conceded the point\nwhile attempting to defuse its force. As noted earlier, Rorty grants\nthat truth is not objective in the traditional sense while also\nattempting to undercut the very distinction between objectivity and\nrelativism. Others, such as Putnam, have argued against metaphysical\nrealist intuitions (such as \u201cthe God\u2019s Eye view\u201d\n1981: 55), while defending the idea of a more human-scale objectivity:\n\u201cobjectivity and rationality humanly speaking are what we have;\nthey are better than nothing\u201d (1981: 55). Another response is to\nclaim that pragmatic accounts of truth are fully compatible with\nrealism; any impression to the contrary is a result of confusing\npragmatic \u201celucidations\u201d of truth with more typical\n\u201cdefinitions\u201d. For example Peirce\u2019s steadfast\ncommitment to realism is perfectly compatible with his attempting to\ndescribe truth in terms of its practical role: hence, his notion of\ntruth\n\n\nis the ordinary notion, but he insists on this notion\u2019s being\nphilosophically characterized from the viewpoint of the practical\nfirst order investigator. (Hookway 2002: 319; see also Hookway 2012\nand Legg 2014)\n\n\nEven James claimed \u201cmy account of truth is realistic\u201d\n(1909 [1975: 117]). Likewise, Chang argues that this objection\n\u201cignores the realist dimension of pragmatism, in terms of how\npragmatism demands that our ideas answer to experience, and to\nrealities\u201d (2022: 203). Finally, others attempt to undercut the\ndistinction between realism and antirealism though without making\nconcessions to antirealism. Hildebrand argues for embracing a\n\u201cpractical starting point\u201d (Hildebrand 2003: 185) as a way\nof going \u201cbeyond\u201d the realism-antirealism debate (see also\nFine 2007). Similarly, Price, while admitting that his theory might\nseem \u201cfictionalist\u201d about truth, argues that its bona\nfides are \u201cimpeccably pragmatist\u201d (2003: 189) and, in\nfact, \u201cdeprive both sides of the realism-antirealism debate of\nconceptual resources on which the debate seems to depend\u201d (2003:\n188; but see Atkin 2015 for some caveats and Lynch 2015 for a\npluralist amendment). Da Costa and French (2003) offer a formal\naccount of pragmatic truth that, they argue, can benefit both sides of\nthe realism-antirealism debate (though they themselves prefer\nstructural realism).\n\nWe find, in other words, an assortment of replies that run the gamut\nfrom embracing antirealism to defending realism to attempting to\nundermine the realist-antirealist distinction itself. Evidently, there\nis no consensus among pragmatic theories of truth as to the best line\nof response against this objection. In a way, this should be no\nsurprise: the objection boils down to the charge that pragmatic\ntheories of truth are too epistemic, when it is precisely their\ncommitment to epistemic concepts that characterizes pragmatic theories\nof truth. Responding to this objection may involve concessions and\nqualifications that compromise the pragmatic nature of these\napproaches. Or responding may mean showing how pragmatic accounts have\ncertain practical benefits\u2014but these benefits as well as their\nrelative importance are themselves contentious topics. As a result, we\nshould not expect this objection to be easily resolvable, if it can be\nresolved at all.\n\nDespite being the target of significant criticism from nearly the\nmoment of its birth, the pragmatic theory of truth has managed to\nsurvive and, at times, even flourish for over a century. Because the\npragmatic theory of truth has come in several different versions, and\nbecause these versions often diverge significantly, it can be\ndifficult to pin down and assess generally. Adding to the possible\nconfusion, not all those identified as pragmatists have embraced a\npragmatic theory of truth (e.g., Brandom 2011), while similar theories\nhave been held by non-pragmatists (e.g., Dummett 1959; Wright 1992).\nViewed more positively, pragmatic theories have evolved and matured to\nbecome more refined and, perhaps, more plausible over time. With the\nbenefit of hind-sight we can see how pragmatic theories of truth have\nstayed focused on the practical function that the concept of truth\nplays: first, the role truth plays within inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse by, for example, signaling those statements that are\nespecially useful, well-verified, durable, or indefeasible and,\nsecond, the role truth plays in shaping inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse by providing a necessary goal or norm. (While pragmatic\ntheories agree on the importance of focusing on truth\u2019s\npractical function, they often disagree over what this practical\nfunction is.)\n\nThe pragmatic theory of truth began with Peirce raising the question\nof truth\u2019s \u201cpractical bearings\u201d. It is also possible\nto ask this question of the pragmatic theory of truth itself: what\ndifference does this theory make? Or to put it in James\u2019 terms,\nwhat is its \u201ccash value\u201d? One answer is that, by focusing\non the practical function of the concept of truth, pragmatic theories\nhighlight how this concept makes certain kinds of inquiry and\ndiscourse possible. In contrast, as Lynch (2009) notes, some accounts\nof truth make it difficult to see how certain claims are\ntruth-apt:\n\n\nconsider propositions like two and two are four or\ntorture is wrong. Under the assumption that truth is always\nand everywhere causal correspondence, it is a vexing question how\nthese true thoughts can be true. (Lynch 2009: 34, emphasis in\noriginal)\n\n\nIf that is so, then pragmatic theories have the advantage of\npreserving the possibility and importance of various types of inquiry\nand discourse. While this does not guarantee that inquiry will always\nreach a satisfying or definite conclusion, this does suggest that\npragmatic theories of truth do make a difference: in the spirit of\nPeirce\u2019s \u201cfirst rule of reason\u201d, they \u201cdo not\nblock the way of inquiry\u201d (1898 [1992: 178]).\n",
