    "main_text": "Some Approaches to Moral Responsibility || Forward-Looking Accounts\n2.1 Forward-Looking Accounts\n\nForward-looking approaches to moral responsibility justify\nresponsibility practices by focusing on the beneficial consequences\nthat can be obtained by engaging in these practices. This approach was\ninfluential in the earlier parts of the twentieth century (as well as\nbefore), had fallen out of favor by the closing decades of that\ncentury, and has recently been the subject of renewed interest.\n\nForward-looking perspectives tend to emphasize one of the central\npoints discussed in the previous section: an agent\u2019s being\nsubject to determinism does not entail that he is subject to\nconstraints that force him to act independently of his choices. If\nthis is true, then, regardless of the truth of determinism, it may be\nuseful to offer certain incentives to agents\u2014to praise and blame\nthem and generally to treat them as responsible\u2014in order to\nencourage them to make certain choices and thus to secure positive\nbehavioral outcomes.\n\nAccording to some articulations of the forward-looking approach, to be\na responsible agent is simply to be an agent whose motives, choices,\nand behavior can be shaped in this way. Thus, Moritz Schlick argued\nthat\n\n\nThe question of who is responsible is the question concerning the\ncorrect point of application of the motive\u2026. in this\nits meaning is completely exhausted; behind it lurks no mysterious\nconnection between transgression and requital\u2026. It is a matter\nonly of knowing who is to be punished or rewarded, in order that\npunishment and reward function as such\u2014be able to achieve their\ngoal. (1930 [1966: 61]; emphasis in original)\n\n\nAnd, according to Schlick, the goals of punishment and reward have\nnothing to do with the past: the idea that punishment \u201cis a\nnatural retaliation for past wrong, ought no longer to be\ndefended in cultivated society\u201d (1930 [1966: 60]; emphasis in\noriginal). Instead, punishment ought to be \n\n\nconcerned only with the institution of causes, of motives of\nconduct\u2026. Analogously, in the case of reward we are concerned\nwith an incentive. (1930 [1966: 60]; emphasis in original) \n\n\nJ. J. C. Smart (1961) also defended a well-known, forward-looking\napproach to moral responsibility in the mid-twentieth century. Smart\nclaimed that to blame someone for a piece of behavior is simply to\nassess the behavior negatively (to \u201cdispraise\u201d it, in\nSmart\u2019s terminology) while simultaneously ascribing\nresponsibility for the behavior to the agent. And, for Smart, an\nascription of responsibility merely involves taking an agent to be\nsuch that he would have omitted the behavior if he had been provided\nwith a motive to do so. Whatever sanctions may follow on an ascription\nof responsibility are administered with eye to giving an agent motives\nto refrain from such behavior in the future.\n\nSmart\u2019s general approach has its contemporary defenders (Arneson\n2003), but many have found it lacking in important ways. For one\nthing, as R. Jay Wallace notes, an approach like Smart\u2019s\n\u201cleaves out the underlying attitudinal aspect of moral\nblame\u201d (Wallace 1996: 56, emphasis in original; see the next\nsubsection for more on blaming attitudes). According to Wallace, the\nattitudes involved in blame are \u201cbackward-looking and focused on\nthe individual agent who has done something morally wrong\u201d\n(Wallace 1996: 56). But a forward-looking approach, with its focus on\nbringing about desirable outcomes \n\n\nis not directed exclusively toward the individual agent who has done\nsomething morally wrong, but takes account of anyone else who\nis susceptible to being influenced by our responses. (Wallace 1996:\n56; emphasis added) \n\n\nIn exceptional cases, a focus on beneficial outcomes may provide\ngrounds for treating as blameworthy those who are known to be innocent\n(Smart 1973). This last feature of (some) forward-looking approaches\nhas led to particularly strong criticism.\n\nRecent efforts have been made to develop partially forward-looking\naccounts of responsibility that evade some of the criticisms mentioned\nabove. These (somewhat revisionary) accounts justify our\nresponsibility practices by appeal to their suitability for fostering\nmoral agency and the acquisition of capacities required for such\nagency. Most notable in this regard is Manuel Vargas\u2019s\n\u201cagency cultivation model\u201d of responsibility (2013; also\nsee Jefferson 2019 and McGeer 2015). Recent conversational accounts of\nresponsibility\n (\u00a73.2.2)\n also have an important forward-looking component insofar as they\nregard those with whom one might have fruitful moral interactions as\ncandidates for responsibility. Some responsibility skeptics have also\nemphasized the forward-looking benefits of certain responsibility\npractices. For example, Derk Pereboom\u2014who rejects desert-based\nblame\u2014has argued that some conventional blaming practices can be\nmaintained (even after ordinary notions of blameworthiness have been\nleft behind) insofar as these practices are grounded in\n\u201cnon-desert invoking moral desiderata\u201d such as\n\u201cprotection of potential victims, reconciliation to\nrelationships both personal and with the moral community more\ngenerally, and moral formation\u201d (2014: 134; also see Caruso\n2016, Levy 2012, and Milam 2016). In contrast to some of the\nforward-looking approaches described above, Pereboom (2017) proposes\nthat only those agents who have in fact acted immorally should be open\nto forward-aiming blaming practices.
