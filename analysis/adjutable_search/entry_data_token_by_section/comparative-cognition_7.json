    "main_text": "Eliminating Alternative Explanations || Cognitive and Associative Explanations\n2.2 Cognitive and Associative Explanations\n\nAs noted above, to provide compelling evidence that an animal has\ncognitive capacities like episodic memory or theory of mind,\nresearchers aim to eliminate plausible alternative explanations for\nbehavior. This research strategy is not unique to comparative\ncognition but is found across the sciences. For example, Julian Reiss\nargues that a hypothesis is warranted insofar as one has eliminated\nalternative hypotheses. That is, the strength of the warrant depends\non how many alternatives have been eliminated and how compelling or\nsalient those alternatives are (Reiss 2015). In comparative cognition,\nassociative learning is regularly advanced as a salient alternative\nthat must be eliminated before concluding that an animal has complex\ncognition. As Starzak and Gray (2021) write,\n\n\nOver and over again the familiar refrain is, \u201cdo animals have\ncomplex human-like cognitive abilities or can their behavior be\nexplained in terms of simpler processes such as associative\nlearning?\u201d. (2021: 2)\n\n\nWhat is associative learning? Broadly, associative learning is a class\nof learning mechanisms characterized by a change in association\nbetween two or more variables. Two common forms of associative\nlearning are classical (Pavlovian) conditioning and operant\n(instrumental) conditioning. In classical conditioning, a stimulus\ncomes to elicit a response in an organism because it has become\nassociated with another stimulus. For example, drawing on the studies\nof the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov, dogs naturally salivate in\nresponse to the taste of food (this response does not require training\nor conditioning, so is an unconditioned response to an\nunconditioned stimulus). However, one can pair another\nstimulus, like the sound of a bell, with the arrival of food. Over\ntime, dogs will learn to associate the food with the sound of the\nbell, such that the sound of the bell will become sufficient on its\nown to elicit salivation (the sound has become a conditioned\nstimulus leading to a conditioned response). In operant\nconditioning, an organism\u2019s behavior changes in response to the\nconsequences of that behavior. For example, a cat might behave in many\nways while interacting with a puzzle box (which, say, contains food\nthe cat likes) with some behaviors resulting in the cat successfully\nopening the puzzle box by accident. Over time, the successful\nbehaviors will be strengthened, and the unsuccessful behaviors\nweakened, such that the cat will be able to quickly open the puzzle\nbox as a result of operant conditioning alone. The tendency for\nbehaviors to be strengthened or weakened in response to their positive\nand negative consequences respectively is known as Thorndike\u2019s\nlaw of effect after the American psychologist Edward Thorndike.\n\nIt is often possible to formulate plausible associative learning\naccounts that can accommodate data originally believed to support\nhypotheses like causal reasoning or theory of mind (for examples, see\nTaylor, Medina, et al. 2010; Heyes 2012; Halina 2022). In many cases,\nthis is taken to undermine the original interpretation of the data\nbecause associative learning is taken to be preferred as an\nexplanation of animal behavior over capacities that require\n\u201ccomplex\u201d or human-like cognitive abilities (Buckner 2011;\nHanus 2016). One justification for this preference is that associative\nlearning is \u201csimpler\u201d than alternative cognitive\nexplanations and thus should be preferred all else being equal (see\n section 2.3).\n Philosophers have argued, however, that appealing to simplicity alone\nin this context is not enough. Instead, one must show that the\nassociative and cognitive explanations in question can in fact be\nordered by complexity and that there are good reasons for preferring\nthe simpler explanation in a particular case (e.g., because the more\ncomplex cognitive ability presupposes or requires the simpler\nassociative ability) (Heyes 2012; Meketa 2014; Dacey 2016, 2017). A\nsecond justification for preferring associative learning as an\nexplanation is that it is phylogenetically widespread. If associative\nlearning is phylogenetically widespread, then it is reasonable to\nassume that many animals will use it to solve physical and social\ncognition tasks. Irina Mikhalevich (publishing as Meketa 2014) refers\nto this as the \u201ctaxonomic ubiquity argument\u201d (2014: 737).\nOne concern with this approach is that if it is standard practice to\nbelieve that associative learning trumps complex cognition (in cases\nwhere both are consistent with the data), then this practice might\nitself result in associative learning appearing more taxonomically\nubiquitous. Thus, relying on such results to justify associative\nlearning as a preferred hypothesis appears to beg the question (Meketa\n2014, but see Heyes 2012).\n\nThe above discussion presumes that associative learning and complex\ncognition are mutually exclusive\u2014that one or the other, but not\nboth, are needed to explain a behavior of interest. One explanation\nfor this assumption is that it is simply part of typical definitions\nof complex cognition and associative learning. For example, Amanda\nSeed and colleagues note that complex cognition is often\n\u201cdefined by exclusion, rather than by some positive assessment\nof the mechanisms underpinning it\u201d (Seed, Emery, & Clayton\n2009: 402). Such an approach identifies a flexible or novel behavior\nas best explained by complex cognition when it \u201ccannot easily be\nexplained in terms of simple conditioning, or hardwired action\npatterns\u201d (Seed et al. 2009: 410). Under this view, complex\ncognition and associative learning are mutually exclusive by\ndefinition. However, researchers have expressed concerns with the\nassociative-cognitive distinction (Allen 2006; Buckner 2017). One\nconcern is that associative learning models are now sophisticated\nenough to capture paradigm cases of cognitive processes (see Buckner\n2011, forthcoming; Dickinson 2012). Another concern is that cognition\ndoes not lend itself to precise definition or clear categorization.\nAllen (2017), for example, advances a \u201crelaxed pluralism\u201d\nabout cognition, allowing for multiple incompatible accounts. Those\nwho reject the associative-cognitive distinction often urge\nresearchers to focus on more specific capacities instead. As David\nPapineau and Cecilia Heyes write,\n\n\nresearch should refocus on specific explanations of how animals do\nspecific things, rather than on the presence or absence of some\ngeneral or ideal form of rationality that contrasts with associative\nmechanisms. (2006: 187)\n\n\nDacey (2016) also argues that the concept of \u201cassociation\u201d\nis best understood as a \u201chighly abstract filler term\u201d that\ncan be implemented by a wide range of cognitive mechanisms (2016:\n3763). Understood this way, associative learning and complex cognition\nare not mutually exclusive: both may be needed to explain a given\nbehavior.\n",
