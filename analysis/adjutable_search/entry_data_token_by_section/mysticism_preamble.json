    "main_text": "\n\nUnder the influence of William James\u2019 Varieties of Religious\nExperience, philosophical interest in mysticism has heavily\nfocused on distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting\n\u201cmystical experiences.\u201d Philosophers have dealt with such\ntopics as the classification of mystical experiences, their nature, to\nwhat extent mystical experiences are conditioned by a mystic\u2019s\nlanguage and culture, and whether mystical experiences furnish\nevidence for the truth of mystical claims. Some philosophers have\nrecently questioned the emphasis on experience in favor of examining\nbroader mystical phenomena. Indeed, \u201cmysticism\u201d is best\nthought of as a constellation of distinctive practices, discourses,\ntexts, institutions, traditions, and experiences aimed at human\ntransformation, variously defined. But this entry will\nconcentrate on the topics philosophers have discussed concerning\nmystical experiences.\n",
