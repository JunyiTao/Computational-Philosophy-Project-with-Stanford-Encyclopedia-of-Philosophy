    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || Typicality\n4.5 Typicality\n\nAn alternative account explains the approach to equilibrium in terms\nof typicality. Intuitively something is typical if it happens\nin the \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases: typical lottery tickets\nare blanks, and in a typical series of a thousand coin tosses the\nratio of the number of heads and the number of tails is approximately\none. The leading idea of a typicality-based account of SM is to show\nthat thermodynamic behaviour is typical and is therefore to be\nexpected. The typicality account comes in different version, which\ndisagree on how exactly typicality reasoning is put to use; different\nversions have been formulated, among others, by Goldstein (2001),\nGoldstein and Lebowitz (2004), Goldstein, Lebowitz, Tumulka, and\nZangh\u00ec (2006), Lebowitz (1993a, 1993b), and Volchan (2007). In\nits paradigmatic version, the account builds on the observation\n(discussed in\n Section 4.2)\n that the equilibrium macro-region is so large that \\(X\\) consists\nalmost entirely of equilibrium micro-states, which means that\nequilibrium micro-states are typical in \\(X\\). The account submits\nthat, for this reason, a system that starts its time-evolution in a\nnon-equilibrium state can simply not avoid evolving into a typical\nstate\u2014i.e., an equilibrium state\u2014and staying there for\nvery long time, which explains the approach to equilibrium.\n\nFrigg (2009, 2011) and Uffink (2007) argue that from the point of view\nof dynamical systems theory this is unjustified because there is no\nreason to assume that micro-states in an atypical set have to evolve\ninto a typical set without there being any further dynamical\nassumptions in place. To get around this problem Frigg and Werndl\n(2012) formulate a version of the account that takes the dynamics of\nthe system into account. Lazarovici and Reichert (2015) disagree that\nsuch additions are necessary. For further discussions of the use of\ntypicality in SM, see Badino (2020), Bricmont (2022), Chibbaro,\nRondoni and Vulpiani (2022), Crane and Wilhelm (2020), Goldstein\n(2012), Hemmo and Shenker (2015), Luczak (2016), Maudlin (2020),\nReichert (forthcoming), and Wilhelm (2022). As far as\nLoschmidt\u2019s and Zermelo\u2019s objections are concerned, the\ntypicality approach has to make the same move as the ergodic approach\nand reject strict irreversibility as a requirement.\n",
