    "main_text": "\n\nMax Horkheimer (1895\u20131973) was a leader of the \u201cFrankfurt\nSchool,\u201d a group of philosophers and social scientists\nassociated with the Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\n(Institute of Social Research) in Frankfurt am Main. Horkheimer was\nthe director of the Institute and Professor of Social Philosophy at\nthe University of Frankfurt from 1930\u20131933, and again from\n1949\u20131958. In between those periods he would lead the Institute\nin exile, primarily in America. As a philosopher he is best known\n(especially in the Anglophone world), for his work during the 1940s,\nincluding Dialectic of Enlightenment, which was co-authored\nwith Theodor Adorno. While deservedly influential, Dialectic of\nEnlightenment (and other works from that period) should not be\nseparated from the context of Horkheimer\u2019s work as a whole.\nEspecially important in this regard are the writings from the 1930s,\nwhich were largely responsible for developing the epistemological and\nmethodological orientation of Frankfurt School critical theory. This\nwork both influenced his contemporaries (including Adorno and Herbert\nMarcuse) and has had an enduring influence on critical theory\u2019s\nlater practitioners (including J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and the\nInstitute\u2019s current director Axel Honneth).\n",
