Criminal Justice and Racial Profiling\n\nIn recent years, the criminal justice system has become a focal point\nin the discussion of civil rights in the United States. A number of\ncommentators have argued that the system amounts to a \u201cnew Jim\nCrow,\u201d reducing blacks to an inferior, caste-like status\n(Alexander 2012; for criticism of the Jim Crow analogy, see Forman\n2012). Yet, even apart from such arguments, civil rights concerns have\nbeen raised about every dimension of criminal justice in the U.S.,\nfrom the investigation and arrest of suspects to the imposition of the\ndeath penalty. And issues of racial equality with respect to criminal\njustice are hardly limited to the U.S. (Clarke: 9\u201310). In France, for\nexample, race-based abuse perpetrated by the police is a matter of\nserious public concern, and the office of Defender of Rights has found\nthat persons perceived as black or Arab are 20 times as likely to be\nstopped by police as members of the general population (Bredeen and\nMorenne 2017).\n\nAmong the most controversial tactics used by police in determining who\nhas committed a crime is racial (and ethnic) profiling. The tactic has\ngiven rise to the charge that it violates the civil rights of those\nwhom it targets, and, in some cases, the courts have agreed with the\ncharge. In State v. Soto, for example, a New Jersey court\nfound that police traffic stops targeted blacks and amounted to a\n\u201cselective enforcement\u201d (351) of the law and a violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Nonetheless,\ndebate continues over when, if ever, it is justifiable for police to\nuse race in deciding whom to stop and question.\n\nRisse and Zeckhauser formulate a philosophically sophisticated defense\nof racial profiling. They argue that, even in a racist society like\nthe United States, such profiling is justifiable under conditions\nplausibly thought to exist in a range of cases. Their argument\ncombines utilitarian and deontological considerations: the utilitarian\nstrand regards profiling as contributing to the public good of crime\ncontrol, while the deontological line of argument aims to rebut claims\nthat profiling is objectionably discriminatory and unfair to persons\nwhom it harms.\n\nRisse and Zeckhauser acknowledge that police abuse can be coupled with\nprofiling, but they insist that \u201cabuse and profiling \u2026\nare different problems that must be assessed\nindependently\u201d (139; emphasis in original). Profiling is\n\u201cany police initiated-action that relies on the race, ethnicity,\nor national origin and not merely on the behavior of an\nindividual\u201d (136). Such action need not involve any abusive\npolice behavior, such as \u201crude words, demeaning demands,\nphysical force, or physical injury\u201d (138). Abuse \u201cmust be\nrectified independently\u201d (139) of profiling.\n\nSome critics of profiling contend that it is wholly ineffective as a\ncrime control measure. Risse and Zeckhauser point out that if this\ncontention is true, then there is no issue: profiling is unjustifiable\non that premise. But they reason that, even if some forms of profiling\nmake no net contribution to crime control, it seems unlikely that all\nforms fit that description, given \u201ca significant correlation\nbetween membership in certain racial groups and the tendency to commit\ncertain crimes\u201d (132).\n\nRacial minorities feel aggrieved by profiling, and Risse and\nZeckhauser do not disregard that fact. However, they claim that the\ngrievance rests largely on \u201cthe underlying systematic\nracism\u201d (145) of society and that the harm done to minorities by\nprofiling is \u201csmall\u201d (169) in comparison to the harm done\nby that underlying racism. For example, African Americans would be\n\u201conly slightly\u201d better off if profiling were eliminated,\n\u201ckeeping everything else fixed\u201d (149; emphasis in\noriginal). \u201c[T]he harm attached to profiling per se,\u201d they\nexplain, \u201cis expressive\u201d (146; emphasis in\noriginal). Profiling is \u201ca symbol of structural\ndisadvantage\u201d (147) but \u201cnot the primary cause of \u2026\nthe sense of hurt among minorities\u201d (149). In the utilitarian\ncalculus of Risse and Zeckhauser, the harms that count against the\nbenefits flowing from more effective crime control are\n\u201ccomparatively modest\u201d (149), viz., symbolic harms plus\nthe temporary inconveniences of being stopped and questioned by the\npolice. These modest harms are, in their view, likely to be outweighed\nin a range of cases by the benefits.\n\nAdditionally, Risse and Zeckhauser argue that racial profiling per se\nis not objectionably discriminatory, because it has neither \u201cthe\nintention or the effect of maintaining or establishing an\noppressive relationship\u201d between the races (153;\nemphasis in original). When it does not involve abuse, profiling has\nthe intention of crime control, and, because profiling \u201cis\nitself parasitic on an underlying oppressive relationship\u201d (154)\nand does (mainly) symbolic harm, it \u201cdoes not contribute to [an]\noppressive relationship\u201d (155).\n\nCritics of Risse and Zeckhauser argue that profiling is not only a\nsymbol of society\u2019s underlying racism but that it also\ncontributes materially to such racism and its harmful effects.\nEidelson argues that \u201cthe use of race as a proxy for criminality\nis likely to be taken as validation for racist assumptions, and\nthereby to nurture the very prejudices which contribute most directly\nto [racially] oppressive relationships\u201d (2015: 215). In a\nsimilar vein, Lever contends that profiling \u201cencourages us to\nsee black people as perpetrators\u201d and that \u201cracial\nprofiling exacerbates problems of police abuse\u201d because such\nprofiling \u201cconveys a message that black people are \u2026\ndangerous\u201d (2007: 24). And Hosein contends that blacks and\ncertain other groups, such as Muslims and persons of Middle Eastern\ndescent, \u201ccan reasonably assume that profiling\ncontributes to police abuse in so far as police officers\n(even if mistakenly) take it to license harsh treatment of those\ngroups\u201d (2018: e17; emphasis in original).\n\nHosein also argues, more fundamentally, that a policy of profiling\nblacks and other groups gives the members of those groups good reason\nto think that the government \u201csubstantially discounts [their]\nrights and interests\u201d relative to the rest of society and is\nthereby consigning them to an \u201cinferior political status\u201d\n(e5). In opposition to utilitarian defenses of profiling, he holds\nthat government has a duty of justice to avoid actions that make it\nreasonable for members of the political community to believe that they\nare being consigned to such a status: equal citizenship must be\nsecured by government, and all citizens must have sufficient grounds\nfor confidence that equality is secured for them. \n\nMogensen contends that, contra Risse and Zeckhauser, racial\nprofiling is pro tanto and inherently wrong because it\ndisrespects a person\u2019s interest in being treated in a way that\nreflects her merits as determined by personal features over which she\nhas control. He points out that other forms of differential treatment\nbased on statistical generalizations about unchosen features \u2013\nsuch as minimum age requirements for obtaining a driver\u2019s\nlicense-- are also unfair for disrespecting that interest. But\nMogensen\u2019s central claim is that, unlike those other forms,\n\u201cracial profiling of black citizens [is] especially problematic\ninsofar as it is one of a number of injustices that together\nconstitute \u2026 . a systematic pattern of injustice\u201d\ninflicted on blacks and through which they are subordinated to whites\n(2019: 467). He notes that, on his account, racial profiling would be\nseriously wrongful, even if it were kept secret from the public and\nincreased the efficiency of law enforcement. \n\nReiman agrees with Risse and Zeckhauser that some forms of racial\nprofiling can make a significant contribution to overall safety, but\nhe also supports Lever\u2019s view that racial profiling in a racist\nsociety is likely to exacerbate racism and increase the violation of\nthe rights of those victimized by it. While he holds that\n\u201cprofiling is not intrinsically racist\u201d (2011: 17), Reiman\nargues that Risse and Zeckhauser have not set the bar sufficiently\nhigh for profiling to be justified. He contends that, in light of its\nlikely exacerbation of existing racism, \u201cracial profiling [must]\nbe used only for grave crimes and only where there is abundant\nevidence of its likelihood of significantly increasing apprehension of\nperpetrators of such crimes\u201d (17). In a similar vein, Hosein\nargues that profiling is justified only when the social benefits are\n\u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201cthere are no other means of\nachieving the same benefits without creating similar injustice\u201d\n(2018: e16). For Reiman, Hosein and other critics, then, an adequate\nappreciation of the connection of racial profiling to systemic\ninjustice compels the conclusion that, if profiling can be justified\nat all, it is in a narrower range of circumstances that what the\nRisse- Zeckhauser argument allows. \n",
