    "main_text": "Life\n1.1 Life\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s intellectual position comes across in his\nautobiography (sira). It seems to have formed part of a\nlarger work no longer extant which he wrote for his son Sharaf al-Din\nYusuf. The sira is contained in the Sources of\nInformation on the Classes of Physicians by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi\u2018a (Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a, c. 1242 [1882\u201384],\nKitab \u2018Uyun al-anba\u2019 fi tabaqat al-atibba\u2019,\nA. M\u00fcller (ed.), al-Qahira: al-Matba\u2018at al-wahbiyya,\n1882\u20131884: II. 201\u2013213; Martini Bonadeo 2013). At the\nbeginning of 19th century it was edited and translated into\nLatin by Mousley (Mousley 1808) and re-edited and translated into\nFrench by de Sacy (de Sacy 1810). A second autobiography is included\nin the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice composed in Erzincan\nin 1225 and preserved in the ms. Bursa, Il Halk K\u00fct\u00fcphanesi,\nHuseyin \u00c7elebi 823 (see Stern 1962; Dietrich 1964; Gutas 2011;\nMartini Bonadeo 2013; Joosse 2014; Jad 2017; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben\nAhmed 2018). A third autobiography, lost for us, is probably quoted by\nhis pupil Ibn Khallikan (Ibn Khallikan, Shams al-Din Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad, d. 1282 [1968\u20131977], Wafayat al-a\u2018yan\nwa-anba\u2019 abna\u2019 al-zaman, I. Abbas (ed.), Beirut: Dar\nSadir, 1968\u20131977: IV.76\u201377). Other passages from \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s autobiography have been preserved by\nal-Dhahabi\u2019s History of Islam (Von Somogyi 1937; Cahen\n1970). Finally, further information on \u2018Abd al-Latif can be\nfound in the report of his journey in Egypt entitled Book of the\nReport and Account of the Things which I Witnessed and the Events Seen\nin the Land of Egypt, a compendium extracted from his own history\nof Egypt, The Long Book about Egypt, lost to us (Wahl 1790;\nde Sacy 1810; Zand, Videan, & Videan 1965; Malallah 1987;\nMartini Bonadeo 2017; Kzzo-Bellucci 2020).\n\nHe was born in Baghdad between February and April in 1162 from an\nupper class family originating from Mosul and spent his formative\nyears in Baghdad until 1189. His contemporary Yaqut writes that\n\u2018by his descent (qadiman) he was known as\nIbn al-Labbad, a sort of family name (Yaqut al-Hamawi al-Rumi, d. 1229\n[1993], Mu\u2018jam al-udaba\u2019. Irshad al-arib ila\nma\u2018rifat al-adib, I. Abbas (ed.), Beirut: Dar al-Gharb\nal-Islami, 1993: IV.1571). In the years of his youth in Baghdad,\nunder the guidance of his father \u2013 Abu l-\u2018Izz ibn Muhammad\nal-Mawsili who had been a student of Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s\n(d. 1165) (Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a, c. 1242 [1882\u201384], Kitab\n\u2018Uyun al-anba\u2019 fi tabaqat al-atibba\u2019, A.\nM\u00fcller (ed.), al-Qahira: al-Matba\u2018at al-wahbiyya,\n1882\u20131884: I. 280; Toorawa 2004), \u2018Abd al-Latif\nstudied Islamic sciences and medicine with many renowned scholars,\nincluding Kamal ad-Din \u2018Abd al-Rahman al-Anbari (d.1181), a\nprofessor of fiqh (law), adab-literature,\nhadith (traditions) and Arabic grammar at the Nizamiyya\nmadrasa, Wagih al-Wasiti (d.1215), a professor at the Zafariyya\nMosque, Ibn Fadlan (d.1199), an outstanding legal scholar versed in\nthe khilaf (divergence of the law) and dialectic, and leader\nof the Shafi\u2018is in Iraq, \u2018Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn\nal-Khashshab (d.1171), master of hadith, grammarian,\nmathematician, expert in fara\u2019id (hereditary law) and\nnasab (genealogy), Radi al-Dawla Abu Nasr (d.ca.1182), son of\nthe well-known physician Amin al-Dawla Ibn al-Tilmidh, professor of\nmedical subjects.\n\nIn his hometown \u2018Abd al-Latif made his first steps in philosophy\nstudying al-Ghazali\u2019s Intentions of the Philosophers,\nthe Measure of Science in the Art of Logic, the Criterion\nof Action on Ethics and the Touchstone of Reasoning in\nLogic. Then he turned to Avicenna\u2019s books including the\nSalvation, the Cure, the Canon, and the\nValidation by Bahmanyar, a pupil of Avicenna. Finally still\nin Baghdad he studied Indian mathematics, Euclid\u2019s geometry, and\nmany books on alchemy by Jabir ibn Hayyan, but then he abandoned this\ndiscipline which he considered an irrational practice.\n\nAt the age of twenty-eight, in 1189, he left Baghdad and began a long\nperiod of travel in search for knowledge. First he was in Mosul for a\nyear. There he heard people saying great things about al-Suhrawardi.\nHe came across al-Suhrawardi\u2019s treatises the\nIntimations, the Glimmer, and the Ascending\nSteps; but he did not find in them the knowledge that he was\nlooking for. He left Mosul for Damascus where he joined the grammarian\nal-Kindi al-Baghdadi (d.1216) and he worked on a certain number of\ngrammatical treatises. In Damascus he took more and more distance from\nthe study and practice of alchemy. Then \u2018Abd al-Latif went to\nJerusalem and then to the Saladin near Acre. Here he came into contact\nwith Saladin\u2019s entourage: Baha\u2019 al-Din ibn Shaddad\n(1145\u20131234), his biographer and the chief of the army and the\ncity of Jerusalem, and \u2018Imad al-Din al-Katib al-Isfahani\n(d.1201), the chronicler of Saladin\u2019s deeds. With a safe-conduct\ndocument written by this latter \u2018Abd al-Latif arrived in\nCairo.\n\nHis aim in Egypt was to meet Yasin al-Simiya\u2019i, a not well known\nalchemist, and Moses Maimonides, the famous Jewish philosopher,\ntheologian, and doctor, born in Cordoba in 1135. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nrefused to work with the first for the senselessness of his teaching\nand found the latter excellent, but dominated by the desire to excel\nand by his political ambitions. \u2018Abd al-Latif read Maimonides\nGuide for the Perplexed and found it a bad book which\ncorrupted the tenets of faith and religion. \n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s encounter with the Peripatetic tradition\ntook place in the vibrant cultural environment of Cairo where he met\nAbu al-Qasim al-Shari\u2018i, who had expert knowledge of the works\nof the \u201cAncients\u201d and of those of Abu Nasr al-Farabi.\nPerhaps he was the renowned and famous master in the science of\nhadith Abu al-Qasim al-Busiri (or al-Busayri d.1202), as\nsuggested with caution by de Sacy (de Sacy 1810). But this\nidentification remains problematic, given the fact that nine\ncontemporary of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s bear the nisba\nal-Shari\u2018i, most of them members of scholarly families in Cairo,\nand two of them also bear the kunya Abu l-Qasim. In\naddition neither al-Busiri and nor the nine bearers of the\nnisba al-Shari\u2018i were known for their \nexpert philosophical knowledge (Griffel 2023). In Cairo, for the first\ntime \u2018Abd al-Latif studied the books of the\n\u201cAncients\u201d, namely Aristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nand Themistius, and on the basis of these he began to test the cogency\nof Avicenna\u2019s doctrines. From this he came to hold the\ninferiority of the work of Avicenna. Nevertheless, \u2018Abd al-Latif\nwas intimately loath to renounce he who had been his master and the\ninspiration behind his research from his youth.\n\nAfter 13 September 1192, the date of the armistice of the Ayyubids\nwith the Franks, \u2018Abd al-Latif moved to Jerusalem where he met\nthe Saladin in person who awarded him a generous stipend to teach in\nthe Umayyad mosque in Damascus. After the death of the Saladin\n(d.1193), the last years of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s life took the\nform of a long series of journeys, no longer in search of knowledge,\ninstruction, teachers and books, but all motivated by, or at the\nbehest of, patrons: in Damascus al-Malik al-Afdal, Saladin\u2019s\neldest son; in Cairo al-Malik al-Aziz, in Jerusalem al-Malik al-Adil\nSayf al-Din Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub, in Erzinjan al-Malik \u2018Ala\u2019\nal-Din Da\u2019ud ibn Bahram, in many other places in Anatolia\n(Erzerum, Kamah, Dvriji, Malatya) Seljuks patrons, in Aleppo Shihab\nal-Din Tughril. He taught in many different Madrasas and mosques\nincluding the al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, al-Azhar in Cairo, the\n\u2018aziziyya madrasa in Damasco. His contemporary al-Qifti \nreports that towards the end of his life he tried to practice\nmedicine, but was not successful because he was not enough a good\npractical physician (Ibn al-Qifti, d.1248 [1950\u20131955], Inbah\nal-ruwat \u2018ala anbah al-nuhat, M. Abu l-Fadl Ibrahim (ed.),\nal-Qahira: Dar al-Kutub al-Misriyya, 1950\u201355: II.196; Griffel\n2023). While he was in Aleppo, in autumn 1231, he wanted to go on\npilgrimage to Mecca, and he started his journey towards Baghdad to\nleave some of his works to the \u2018Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir ibn\nal-Zahir (r. 1226\u20131242). Once he arrived in Baghdad \u2018Abd\nal-Latif fell ill and died at the age of 69 on 9 November, 1231. He\nwas buried next to his father in the Wardiyya cemetery.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s students were: the hadith\nscholar Zaki al-Din al-Birzali (d.1239), the botanist Ibn al-Suri\n(d.1242), the judge al-Tifashi (d.1253), Ibn al-\u2018Adim (d. 1262),\nand the biographer Ibn Khallikan (d.1282).\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s\nharshest critic was al-Qifti who accused him of having been a\ntheoretician incapable of practicing medicine and a plagiarist.\nAl-Qifti\u2019s hostility against him was probably caused by\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s accusation of quackery and murder against\nJoseph ben Judah ben Simeon (Josse 2007; Griffel 2023).\n",
