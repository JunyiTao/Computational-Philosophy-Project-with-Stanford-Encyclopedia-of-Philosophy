    "preamble": "\n\nThere are roughly two philosophical literatures on\n\u201chappiness,\u201d each corresponding to a different sense of\nthe term. One uses \u2018happiness\u2019 as a value term, roughly\nsynonymous with well-being or flourishing. The other body of work uses\nthe word as a purely descriptive psychological term, akin to\n\u2018depression\u2019 or \u2018tranquility\u2019. An important\nproject in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what\nvarious writers are talking about: what are the important meanings of\nthe term and how do they connect? While the \u201cwell-being\u201d\nsense of happiness receives significant attention in the contemporary\nliterature on well-being, the psychological notion is undergoing a\nrevival as a major focus of philosophical inquiry, following on recent\ndevelopments in the science of happiness. This entry focuses on the\npsychological sense of happiness (for the well-being notion, see the\nentry on\n well-being).\n The main accounts of happiness in this sense are hedonism, the life\nsatisfaction theory, and the emotional state theory. Leaving verbal\nquestions behind, we find that happiness in the psychological sense\nhas always been an important concern of philosophers. Yet the\nsignificance of happiness for a good life has been hotly disputed in\nrecent decades. Further questions of contemporary interest concern the\nrelation between the philosophy and science of happiness, as well as\nthe role of happiness in social and political decision-making.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The meanings of \u2018happiness\u2019\n1.1 Two senses of \u2018happiness\u2019\n\nWhat is happiness? This question has no straightforward answer,\nbecause the meaning of the question itself is unclear. What exactly is\nbeing asked? Perhaps you want to know what the word\n\u2018happiness\u2019 means. In that case your inquiry is\nlinguistic. Chances are you had something more interesting in mind:\nperhaps you want to know about the thing, happiness, itself.\nIs it pleasure, a life of prosperity, something else? Yet we\ncan\u2019t answer that question until we have some notion of what we\nmean by the word.\n\nPhilosophers who write about \u201chappiness\u201d typically take\ntheir subject matter to be either of two things, each corresponding to\na different sense of the term:\n\nA state of mind\nA life that goes well for the person leading it\n\n\nIn the first case our concern is simply a psychological matter. Just\nas inquiry about pleasure or depression fundamentally concerns\nquestions of psychology, inquiry about happiness in this\nsense\u2014call it the (long-term) \u201cpsychological\nsense\u201d\u2014is fundamentally the study of certain mental\nstates. What is this state of mind we call happiness? Typical answers\nto this question include life satisfaction, pleasure, or a positive\nemotional condition.\n\nHaving answered that question, a further question arises: how\nvaluable is this mental state? Since \u2018happiness\u2019\nin this sense is just a psychological term, you could intelligibly say\nthat happiness isn\u2019t valuable at all. Perhaps you are a\nhigh-achieving intellectual who thinks that only ignoramuses can be\nhappy. On this sort of view, happy people are to be pitied, not\nenvied. The present article will center on happiness in the\npsychological sense.\n\nIn the second case, our subject matter is a kind of value,\nnamely what philosophers nowadays tend to call prudential\nvalue\u2014or, more commonly, well-being,\nwelfare, utility or flourishing. (For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n well-being.\n Whether these terms are really equivalent remains a matter of\ndispute, but this article will usually treat them as interchangeable.)\n\u201cHappiness\u201d in this sense concerns what benefits a person,\nis good for her, makes her better off, serves her interests, or is\ndesirable for her for her sake. To be high in well-being is to be\nfaring well, doing well, fortunate, or in an enviable condition.\nIll-being, or doing badly, may call for sympathy or pity, whereas we\nenvy or rejoice in the good fortune of others, and feel gratitude for\nour own. Being good for someone differs from simply\nbeing good, period: perhaps it is always good, period, for you to be\nhonest; yet it may not always be good for you, as\nwhen it entails self-sacrifice. Not coincidentally, the word\n\u2018happiness\u2019 derives from the term for good fortune, or\n\u201cgood hap,\u201d and indeed the terms used to translate it in\nother languages often have similar roots. In this sense of the\nterm\u2014call it the \u201cwell-being sense\u201d\u2014happiness\nrefers to a life of well-being or flourishing: a life that goes well\nfor you.\n\nImportantly, to ascribe happiness in the well-being sense is to make a\nvalue judgment: namely, that the person has whatever it is\nthat benefits a\n person.[1]\n If you and I and have different values, then we may well differ about\nwhich lives we consider happy. I might think Genghis Khan had a happy\nlife, because I think what matters for well-being is getting what you\nwant; while you deny this because you think a life of evildoing,\nhowever \u201csuccessful,\u201d is sad and impoverished.\n\nTheories of well-being\u2014and hence of \u201chappiness\u201d in\nthe well-being sense\u2014come in three basic flavors, according to\nthe best-known taxonomy (Parfit 1984): hedonism, desire theories, and\nobjective list theories. Whereas hedonists identify well-being roughly\nwith experiences of pleasure, desire theorists equate it with the\nsatisfaction of one\u2019s desires\u2014actually getting\nwhat you want, versus merely having certain experiences. Both hedonism\nand desire theories are in some sense subjectivist, since they ground\nwell-being in the individual\u2019s subjective states. Objective list\ntheorists, by contrast, think some things benefit us independently of\nour attitudes or feelings: there are objective prudential goods.\nAristotelians are the best-known example: they take well-being\n(eudaimonia) to consist in a life of virtuous\nactivity\u2014or more broadly, the fulfillment of our human\ncapacities. A passive but contented couch potato may be getting what\nhe wants, and he may enjoy it. But he would not, on Aristotelian and\nother objective list theories, count as doing well, or leading a happy\nlife.\n1.2 Clarifying our inquiry\n\nNow we can sharpen the initial question somewhat: when you ask what\nhappiness is, are you asking what sort of life benefits a\nperson? If so, then your question concerns matters of value, namely\nwhat is good for people\u2014the sort of thing that ethical theorists\nare trained to address. Alternatively, perhaps you simply want to know\nabout the nature of a certain state of mind\u2014happiness in the\npsychological sense. In this case, some sort of psychological inquiry\nwill be needed, either philosophical or scientific. (Laypersons often\nhave neither sort of question in mind, but are really asking about the\nsources of happiness. Thus it might be claimed, say, that\n\u201chappiness is being with good friends.\u201d This is not a view\nabout the nature or definition of happiness, but rather a\ntheory about the sorts of things that tend to make us happy. It leaves\nunanswered, or takes for granted, the question of just what happiness\nis, such that friends are a good source of it.)\n\nIn short, philosophical \u201ctheories of happiness\u201d can be\nabout either of at least two different things: well-being, or a state\nof\n mind.[2]\n Accordingly, there are essentially two bodies of philosophical\nliterature about \u201chappiness\u201d and two sets of debates about\nits nature, though writers often fail to distinguish them. Such\nfailures have generated much confusion, sometimes yielding bogus\ndisagreements that prove to be merely\n verbal.[3]\n For instance, some psychologists identify \u201chappiness\u201d\nwith attitudes of life satisfaction while remaining neutral on\nquestions of value, or whether Bentham, Mill, Aristotle, or any other\nthinker about the good life was correct. Such researchers employ the\nterm in the psychological sense. Yet it is sometimes objected against\nsuch claims that life satisfaction cannot suffice for\n\u201chappiness\u201d because other things, like achievement or\nknowledge, matter for human well-being. The objectors are confused:\ntheir opponents have made no claims about well-being at all, and the\ntwo \u201csides,\u201d as it were, are simply using\n\u2018happiness\u2019 to talk about different things. One might just\nas sensibly object to an economist\u2019s tract on\n\u201cbanks\u201d that it has nothing to say about rivers and\nstreams.\n\nWhich use of \u2018happiness\u2019 corresponds to the true meaning\nof the term in contemporary English? Arguably, both. The well-being\nusage clearly dominates in the historical literature through at least\nthe early modern era, for instance in translations of the ancient\nGreeks\u2019 \u2018eudaimonia\u2019 or the Latin\n\u2018beatitudo\u2019, though this translation has long\nbeen a source of controversy. Jefferson\u2019s famous reference to\n\u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d probably employed the\nwell-being sense. Even later writers such as Mill may have used the\nterm in its well-being sense, though it is often difficult to tell\nsince well-being itself is often taken to consist in mental states\nlike pleasure. In ordinary usage, the abstract noun\n\u2018happiness\u2019 often invites a well-being reading. And the\nlocution \u2018happy life\u2019 may not naturally take a\npsychological interpretation, for the simple reason that lives\naren\u2019t normally regarded as psychological entities.\n\nContrast this with the very different meaning that seems to attach to\ntalk of \u201cbeing happy.\u201d Here it is much less clear\nthat we are talking about a property of a person\u2019s life; it\nseems rather to be a property of the person herself. To be\nhappy, it seems, is just to be in a certain sort of psychological\nstate or condition. Similarly when we say that so-and-so \u201cis\nhappy\u201d (as opposed to saying that he is leading a happy life).\nThis psychological usage, arguably, predominates in the current\nvernacular. Researchers engaged in the self-described \u201cscience\nof happiness\u201d usually do not take themselves to be making value\njudgments when they proclaim individuals in their studies to be happy.\nNor, when asserting that a life satisfaction study shows Utahans to be\nhappier than New Yorkers, are they committing themselves to the\ntendentious claim that Utahans are better off. (If they are,\nthen the psychology journals that are publishing this research may\nneed to revise their peer-review protocols to include ethicists among\ntheir referees.) And the many recent popular books on happiness, as\nwell as innumerable media accounts of research on happiness, nearly\nall appear to take it for granted that they are talking about nothing\nmore than a psychological condition.\n\nHenceforth \u2018happiness\u2019 will be used in the long-term\npsychological sense, unless otherwise specified. Note, however, that a\nnumber of important books and other works on \u201chappiness\u201d\nin recent decades have employed the well-being sense of the term.\nBooks of this sort appear to include Almeder 2000, Annas 1993, 2011,\nBloomfield 2014, Cahn and Vitrano 2015, Kenny and Kenny 2006, McMahon\n2005, McPherson 2020, Noddings 2003, Russell 2013, White 2006, and\nVitrano 2014, though again it is not always clear how a given author\nuses the term. For discussion of the well-being notion, see the entry\non\n well-being.[4]\n2. Theories of happiness\n2.1 The chief candidates\n\nPhilosophers have most commonly distinguished two accounts of\nhappiness: hedonism, and the life satisfaction\ntheory. Hedonists identify happiness with the individual\u2019s\nbalance of pleasant over unpleasant experience, in the same way that\nwelfare hedonists\n do.[5]\n The difference is that the hedonist about happiness need not accept\nthe stronger doctrine of welfare hedonism; this emerges clearly in\narguments against the classical Utilitarian focus on happiness as the\naim of social choice. Such arguments tend to grant the\nidentification of happiness with pleasure, but challenge the idea that\nthis should be our primary or sole concern, and often as well the idea\nthat happiness is all that matters for well-being.\n\nLife satisfaction theories identify happiness with having a\nfavorable attitude toward one\u2019s life as a whole. This basic\nschema can be filled out in a variety of ways, but typically involves\nsome sort of global judgment: an endorsement or affirmation of\none\u2019s life as a whole. This judgment may be more or less\nexplicit, and may involve or accompany some form of affect. It may\nalso involve or accompany some aggregate of judgments about particular\nitems or domains within one\u2019s\n life.[6]\n\nA third theory, the emotional state view, departs from\nhedonism in a different way: instead of identifying happiness with\npleasant experience, it identifies happiness with an agent\u2019s\nemotional condition as a whole, of what is often called \u201cemotional\n well-being.\u201d[7]\n This includes nonexperiential aspects of emotions and moods (or\nperhaps just moods), and excludes pleasures that don\u2019t directly\ninvolve the individual\u2019s emotional state. It might also include\na person\u2019s propensity for experiencing various moods,\nwhich can vary over time, though several authors have argued against\nthis suggestion (e.g., Hill 2007, Klausen 2015, Rossi 2018). Happiness\non such a view is more nearly the opposite of depression or\nanxiety\u2014a broad psychological condition\u2014whereas hedonistic\nhappiness is simply opposed to unpleasantness. For example, a deeply\ndistressed individual might distract herself enough with constant\nactivity to maintain a mostly pleasant existence\u2014broken only by\ntearful breakdowns during the odd quiet moment\u2014thus perhaps\ncounting as happy on a hedonistic but not emotional state view. The\nstates involved in happiness, on an emotional state view, can range\nwidely, far more so that the ordinary notion of mood or emotion. On\none proposal, happiness involves three broad categories of affective\nstate, including \u201cendorsement\u201d states like joy versus\nsadness, \u201cengagement\u201d states like flow or a sense of\nvitality, and \u201cattunement\u201d states like tranquility,\nemotional expansiveness versus compression, and confidence. Given the departures from commonsensical notions of being in a\n\u201cgood mood,\u201d happiness is characterized in this proposal\nas \u201cpsychic affirmation,\u201d or \u201cpsychic\nflourishing\u201d in pronounced forms.\n\nA fourth family of views, hybrid theories, attempts an irenic\nsolution to our diverse intuitions about happiness: identify happiness\nwith both life satisfaction and pleasure or emotional state, perhaps\nalong with other states such as domain satisfactions. The most obvious\ncandidate here is subjective well-being, which is typically\ndefined as a compound of life satisfaction, domain satisfactions, and\npositive and negative affect. (Researchers often seem to identify\nhappiness with subjective well-being, sometimes with life\nsatisfaction, and perhaps most commonly with emotional or hedonic\nstate.) The chief appeal of hybrid theories is their inclusiveness:\nall the components of subjective well-being seem important, and there\nis probably no component of subjective well-being that does not at\ntimes get included in \u201chappiness\u201d in ordinary usage.\n2.2 Methodology: settling on a theory\n\nHow do we determine which theory is correct? Traditional philosophical\nmethods of conceptual or linguistic analysis can give us some\nguidance, indicating that some accounts offer a better fit with the\nordinary concept of happiness. Thus it has been argued that hedonism\nis false to the concept of happiness as we know it; the intuitions\ntaken to support hedonism point instead to an emotional state view\n(Haybron 2001). And some have argued that life\nsatisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states\nlike depression\u2014a suffering artist might not value emotional\nmatters much, and wholeheartedly affirm her life (Carson 1981, Davis\n1981b, Haybron 2005, Feldman 2010). Yet it might seem\ncounterintuitive to deem such a person happy. At the same time, people\ndo sometimes use \u2018happiness\u2019 to denote states of life\nsatisfaction: life satisfaction theories do seem faithful to some\nordinary uses of \u2018happiness\u2019. The trouble is that\nHAPPINESS appears to be a \u201cmongrel concept,\u201d as Ned Block\n(1995) called the concept of consciousness: the ordinary notion is\nsomething of a mess. We use the term to denote different things in\ndifferent contexts, and often have no clear notion of what we are\nreferring to. This suggests that accounts of happiness must be\nsomewhat revisionary, and that we must assess theories on grounds\nother than simple fidelity to the lay concept of\nhappiness\u2014\u201cdescriptive adequacy,\u201d in Sumner\u2019s\n(1996) terms. One candidate is practical utility: which conception of\nhappiness best answers to our interests in the notion? We talk about\nhappiness because we care about it. The question is why we care about\nit, and which psychological states within the extension of the\nordinary term make the most sense of this concern. Even if there is no\nsimple answer to the question what happiness is, it may well turn out\nthat our interests in happiness cluster so strongly around a\nparticular psychological kind that happiness can best, or most\nprofitably, be understood in terms of that type of state (Haybron\n2003). Alternatively, we may choose to distinguish different\nvarieties of happiness. It will be less important how we use the word,\nhowever, than that we be clear about the nature and significance of\nthe phenomena that interest us.\n2.3 Life satisfaction versus affect-based accounts\n\nThe debate over theories of happiness falls along a couple of lines.\nThe most interesting questions concern the choice between life\nsatisfaction and affect-based views like hedonism and the emotional\nstate\n theory.[8]\n Proponents of life satisfaction see two major advantages to their\naccount. First, life satisfaction is holistic, ranging over\nthe whole of one\u2019s life, or the totality of one\u2019s life\nover a certain period of time. It reflects not just the aggregate of\nmoments in one\u2019s life, but also the global quality of\none\u2019s life taken as a whole (but see Raibley 2010). And we seem\nto care not just about the total quantity of good in our lives, but\nabout its distribution\u2014a happy ending, say, counts for more than\na happy middle (Slote 1982, Velleman 1991). Second, life satisfaction\nseems more closely linked to our priorities than affect is,\nas the suffering artist case illustrates. While a focus on affect\nmakes sense insofar as we care about such matters, most people care\nabout other things as well, and how their lives are going relative to\ntheir priorities may not be fully mirrored in their affective states.\nLife satisfaction theories thus seem to fit more closely with liberal\nideals of individual sovereignty, on which how well my life is going\nfor me is for me to decide. My satisfaction with my life seems to\nembody that judgment. Of course a theory of happiness need not capture\neverything that matters for well-being; the point is that a life\nsatisfaction view might explain why we should care so much about\nhappiness, and so enjoy substantive as well as intuitive\n support.[9]\n\nBut several objections have been raised against life satisfaction\nviews. The most common complaint has already been noted, namely that a\nperson could apparently be satisfied with her life even while leading\na highly unpleasant or emotionally distressed existence, and it can\nseem counterintuitive to regard such a person as happy (see section\n2.2). Some life satisfaction theorists deny that such cases are\npossible (Benditt 1978), but it could also be argued that such\npossibilities are part and parcel of life satisfaction\u2019s appeal:\nsome people may not get much pleasure out of life because they\ndon\u2019t care particularly about affective matters, and a life\nsatisfaction theory allows that they can, in their own fashion, be\nhappy.\n\nTwo other objections are more substantive, raising questions about\nwhether life satisfaction has the right sort of importance. One\nconcern is whether people often enough have well-grounded\nattitudes of life satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Evaluating\none\u2019s life as a whole can be a complicated business, and there\nis some question whether people typically have well-defined attitudes\ntoward their lives that accurately reflect how well their lives\nmeasure up relative to their priorities. Some research, for instance,\nsuggests that life satisfaction reports tend to reflect judgments made\non the spot, drawing on whatever information comes readily to mind,\nwith substantial influences by transient contextual factors like the\nweather, finding a dime, etc. (Schwarz and Strack 1999). Debate\npersists over whether this work undermines the significance of life\nsatisfaction judgments, but it does raise a question whether life\nsatisfaction attitudes tend to be well-enough grounded to have the\nkind of importance that people normally ascribe to happiness.\n\nThe third objection is somewhat intricate, so it will require some\nexplaining. The claim is that a wide range of life satisfaction\nattitudes might be consistent with individuals\u2019 perceptions of\nhow well their lives are going relative to what they care about,\nraising doubts about the importance of life satisfaction (Haybron\n2016). You might reasonably be satisfied when\ngetting very little of what you want, or dissatisfied when getting\nmost of what you want. One reason for this is that people tend to have\nmany incommensurable values, leaving it open how to add them up.\nLooking at the various ups and downs of your life, it may be arbitrary\nwhether to rate your life a four out of ten, or a seven. A second\nreason is that life satisfaction attitudes are not merely assessments\nof subjective success or personal welfare: they involve assessments of\nwhether one\u2019s life is good enough\u2014satisfactory.\nYet people\u2019s values may radically underdetermine where they\nshould set the bar for a \u201cgood enough\u201d life, again\nrendering the judgment somewhat arbitrary. Given your values, you\nmight reasonably be satisfied with a two, or require a nine to be\nsatisfied. While it may seem important how well people see their lives\ngoing relative to what they care about, it is not obviously so\nimportant whether people see their lives going well enough that they\nare willing to judge them satisfactory.\n\nIf life satisfaction attitudes are substantially arbitrary relative to\nsubjective success, then people might reasonably base those attitudes\non other factors, such as ethical ideals (e.g., valuing gratitude or\nnoncomplacency) or pragmatic concerns (e.g., comforting oneself).\nShifts in perspective might also reasonably alter life satisfaction\nattitudes. After the funeral, you might be highly satisfied with your\nlife, whereas the high school reunion leaves you dissatisfied; yet\nneither judgment need be mistaken, or less authoritative.\n\nAs a result, life satisfaction attitudes may be poor indicators of\nwell-being, even from the individual\u2019s own point of view. That\npeople in a given country register high levels of life satisfaction\nmay reflect nothing more than that they set the bar extremely low;\nthey might be satisfied with anything short of pure agony. Another\ncountry\u2019s citizens might be dissatisfied with their lives, but\nonly because they set the bar much higher. Relative to what they care\nabout, people in the dissatisfied nation could be better off than\nthose in the satisfied nation. To take another example, a cancer\npatient might be more satisfied with his life than he was before the\ndiagnosis, for he now looks at his life from a different perspective\nand emphasizes different virtues like fortitude and gratitude as\nopposed to (say) humility and non-complacency. Yet he need not think\nhimself better off at all: he might believe himself worse off than he\nwas when he was less satisfied. Neither judgment need seem to him or\nus to be mistaken: it\u2019s just that he now looks at his life\ndifferently. Indeed, he might think he\u2019s doing badly, even as he\nis satisfied with his life: he endorses it, warts and all, and is\ngrateful just have his not-so-good life rather than some of the much\nworse alternatives.\n\nFor present purposes, the worry is that life satisfaction may not have\nthe kind of significance happiness is normally thought to have. This\nmay pose a difficulty for the identification of life satisfaction with\nhappiness: for people frequently seem to use happiness as a proxy for\nwell-being, a reasonably concrete and value-free stand-in that\nfacilitates quick-and-dirty assessments of welfare. Given the\ndiscovery that someone is happy, we might infer that he is doing well;\nif we learn that someone is unhappy, we may conclude that she is doing\npoorly. Such inferences are defeasible: if we later find that the\nhappy Ned\u2019s wife and friends secretly hate him, we need not\ndecide that he isn\u2019t happy after all; we simply withdraw the\nconclusion that he is doing well. So long as happiness tracks\nwell-being well enough in most cases, this sort of practice is\nperfectly respectable. But if we identify happiness with life\nsatisfaction, then we may have a problem: maybe Sally is satisfied\nonly because she values being grateful for the good things in life.\nThis sort of case may not be merely a theoretical possibility: perhaps\nthe very high rates of self-reported life satisfaction in the United\nStates and many other places substantially reflects a broad acceptance\nof norms of gratitude and a general tendency to emphasize the\npositives, or perhaps a sense that not to endorse your life\namounts to a lack of self-regard. It is not implausible that most\npeople, even those enduring great hardship, can readily find grounds\nfor satisfaction with their lives. Life may have to be pretty hard for\na person to be incapable of affirming it.\n\nDespite these concerns there is significant intuitive appeal in the\nidea that to be happy is to be satisfied with one\u2019s life. Perhaps a\ndifferent way of conceiving life satisfaction, for instance dispensing\nwith the global judgment and aggregating particular satisfactions and\ndissatisfactions, would lessen the force of these objections.\nAlternatively, it is possible that idealized or qualified forms of\nlife satisfaction would mitigate these concerns for some purposes,\nsuch as a theory of\n well-being.[10]\n2.4 Hedonism versus emotional state\n\nA second set of issues concerns the differences between the two\naffect-based views, hedonism and emotional state. The appeal of\nhedonism is fairly obvious: the pleasantness of our experience is\nplainly a matter of great significance; many have claimed it to be the\nonly thing that matters. What, by contrast, motivates the\nemotional state account, which bears obvious similarities to hedonism\nyet excludes many pleasures from happiness? The question of motivation\nappears to be the chief worry facing the emotional state theory:\nwhat\u2019s to be gained by focusing on emotional state rather than\npleasure?\n\nOne argument for taking such a view is intuitive: some find it\nimplausible to think that psychologically superficial pleasures\ninvariably make a difference in how happy one is\u2014the typical\npleasure of eating a cracker, say, or even the intense pleasure of an\norgasm that nonetheless fails to move one, as can happen with\nmeaningless sexual activity. The intuitive distinction seems akin to\ndistinctions made by some ancient philosophers; consider, for\ninstance, the following passage from Epictetus\u2019s\nDiscourses:\n\n\u2018I have a headache.\u2019 Well, do not say \u2018Alas!\u2019\n\u2018I have an earache.\u2019 Do not say \u2018Alas!\u2019 And I\nam not saying that it is not permissible to groan, only do not\ngroan in the centre of your being. (Discourses, 1.18.19,\nemphasis added).\n\nThe Stoics did not expect us never to feel unpleasant sensations,\nwhich would plainly be impossible; rather, the idea was not to let\nsuch things get to us, to impact our emotional\nconditions.\n\nWhy should anyone care to press such a distinction in characterizing\nhappiness? For most people, the hedonic difference between happiness\non an emotional state versus a hedonistic view is probably minimal.\nBut while little will be lost, what will be gained? One possibility is\nthat the more \u201ccentral\u201d affects involving our emotional\nconditions may bear a special relation to the person or the\nself, whereas more \u201cperipheral\u201d affects, like the\npleasantness of eating a cracker, might pertain to the subpersonal\naspects of our psychologies. Since well-being is commonly linked to\nideas of self-fulfillment, this sort of distinction might signal a\ndifference in the importance of these states. Another reason to focus\non emotional condition rather than experience alone may be the greater\npsychological depth of the former: its impact on our mental lives,\nphysiology, and behavior is arguably deeper and more pervasive. This\nenhances the explanatory and predictive significance of happiness, and\nmore importantly its desirability: happiness on this view is not\nmerely pleasant, but a major source of pleasure and other good\noutcomes (Fredrickson 2004, Lyubomirsky, King et al. 2005).\nCompare health on this score: while many think it matters chiefly or\nentirely because of its connection with pleasure, there are few\nskeptics about the importance of health. As well, emotional state\nviews may capture the idea that happiness concerns the\nindividual\u2019s psychological orientation or disposition:\nto be happy, on an emotional state theory, is not just to be subjected\nto a certain sequence of experiences, but for one\u2019s very being\nto manifest a favorable orientation toward the conditions of\none\u2019s life\u2014a kind of psychic affirmation of one\u2019s\nlife. This reflects a point of similarity with life satisfaction views\nof happiness: contra hedonism, both views take happiness to be\nsubstantially dispositional, involving some sort of favorable\norientation toward one\u2019s life. But life satisfaction views tend\nto emphasize reflective or rational endorsement, whereas emotional\nstate views emphasize the verdicts of our emotional natures.\n\nWhile hedonism and emotional state theories are major contenders in\nthe contemporary literature, all affect-based theories confront the\nworries, noted earlier, that motivate life satisfaction\nviews\u2014notably, their looser connection with people\u2019s\npriorities, as well as their limited ability to reflect the quality of\npeople\u2019s lives taken as a whole.\n2.5 Hybrid accounts\n\nGiven the limitations of narrower theories of happiness, a hybrid\naccount such as a subjective well-being theory may seem an attractive\nsolution. This strategy has not been fully explored in the\nphilosophical literature, though Sumner\u2019s \u201clife\nsatisfaction\u201d theory may best be classified as a hybrid (1996;\nsee also Martin 2012). In any event, a hybrid approach draws\nobjections of its own. If we arrive at a hybrid theory by this route,\nit could seem like either the marriage of two unpromising accounts, or\nof a promising account with an unpromising one. Such a union may not\nyield wholesome results. Second, people have different intuitions\nabout what counts as happiness, so that no theory can accommodate all\nof them. Any theory that tries to thus risks pleasing no one. A third\nconcern is that the various components of any hybrid are liable to\nmatter for quite different reasons, so that happiness, thus\nunderstood, might fail to answer to any coherent set of concerns.\nAscriptions of happiness could be relatively uninformative if they\ncast their net too widely.\n3. The science of happiness\n3.1 Can happiness be measured?\n\nWith the explosive rise of empirical research on happiness, a central\nquestion is how far, and how, happiness might be\n measured.[11]\n There seems to be no in-principle barrier to the idea of measuring,\nat least roughly, how happy people are. Investigators may never enjoy\nthe precision of the \u201chedonimeter\u201d once envisaged by\nEdgeworth to show just how happy a person is (Edgeworth 1881). Indeed,\nsuch a device might be impossible even in principle, since happiness\nmight involve multiple dimensions that either cannot be precisely\nquantified or summed together. If so, it could still be feasible to\ndevelop approximate measures of happiness, or at least its various\ndimensions. Similarly, depression may not admit of precise\nquantification in a single number, yet many useful if imprecise\nmeasures of depression exist. In the case of happiness, it is\nplausible that even current measures provide information about how\nanxious, cheerful, satisfied, etc. people are, and thus tell us\nsomething about their happiness. Even the simplest self-report\nmeasures used in the literature have been found to correlate well with\nmany intuitively relevant variables, such as friends\u2019 reports,\nsmiling, physiological measures, health, longevity, and so forth\n(Pavot 2008).\n\nImportantly, most scientific research needs only to discern patterns\nacross large numbers of individuals\u2014to take an easy case,\ndetermining whether widows tend to be less happy than\nnewlyweds\u2014and this is compatible with substantial unreliability\nin assessing individual happiness. Similarly, an inaccurate\nthermometer might be a poor guide to the temperature, but readings from\nmany such thermometers could correlate fairly well with actual\ntemperatures\u2014telling us, for instance, that Minnesota is colder\nthan Florida.\n\nThis point reveals an important caveat: measures of happiness could\ncorrelate well with how happy people are, thus telling us which groups\nof people tend to be happier, while being completely wrong about\nabsolute levels of happiness. Self-reports of happiness, for\ninstance, might correctly indicate that unemployed people are\nconsiderably less happy than those with jobs. But every one of those\nreports could be wrong, say if everyone is unhappy yet claims to be\nhappy, or vice-versa, so long as the unemployed report lower happiness\nthan the employed. Similarly, bad thermometers may show that Minnesota\nis colder than Florida without giving the correct temperature.\n\nTwo morals emerge from these reflections. First, self-report measures\nof happiness could be reliable guides to relative happiness,\nthough telling us little about how happy, in absolute terms, people\nare. We may know who is happier, that is, but not whether people are\nin fact happy. Second, even comparisons of relative happiness will be\ninaccurate if the groups being compared systematically bias\ntheir reports in different ways. This worry is particularly acute for\ncross-cultural comparisons of happiness, where differing norms about\nhappiness may undermine the comparability of self-reports. The French\nmight report lower happiness than Americans, for instance, not because\ntheir lives are less satisfying or pleasant, but because they tend to\nput a less positive spin on things. For this reason it may be useful\nto employ instruments, including narrower questions or physiological\nmeasures, that are less prone to cultural\n biasing.[12]\n\nThe discussion thus far has assumed that people can be wrong about how\nhappy they are. Is this plausible? Some have argued that (sincerely)\nself-reported happiness cannot, even in principle, be mistaken. If you\nthink you\u2019re happy, goes a common sentiment, then you\nare happy. This claim is not plausible on a hedonistic or\nemotional state view of happiness, since those theories take judgments\nof happiness to encompass not just how one is feeling at the moment\nbut also past states, and memories of those can obviously be spurious.\nFurther, it has been argued that even judgments of how one feels at\nthe present moment may often be mistaken, particularly regarding moods\nlike\n anxiety.[13]\n\nThe idea that sincere self-reports of happiness are incorrigible can\nonly be correct, it seems, given a quite specific conception of\nhappiness\u2014a kind of life satisfaction theory of happiness on\nwhich people count as satisfied with their lives so long as they are\ndisposed to judge explicitly that they are satisfied with their lives\non the whole. Also assumed here is that self-reports of happiness are\nin fact wholly grounded in life satisfaction judgments like\nthese\u2014that is, that people take questions about\n\u201chappiness\u201d to be questions about life satisfaction. Given\nthese assumptions, we can plausibly conclude that self-reports of\nhappiness are incorrigible. One question is whether happiness, thus\nconceived, is very important. As well, it is unlikely that respondents\ninvariably interpret happiness questions as being about life\nsatisfaction. At any rate, even life satisfaction theorists might balk\nat this variant of the account, since life satisfaction is sometimes\ntaken to involve, not just explicit global judgments of life\nsatisfaction, but also our responses to the particular things or\ndomains we care about. Some will hesitate to deem satisfied people who\nhate many of the important things in their lives, however satisfied\nthey claim to be with their lives as a whole.\n\nIn a similar vein, the common practice of measuring happiness simply\nby asking people to report explicitly on how \u201chappy\u201d they\nare is sometimes defended on the grounds that it lets people decide\nfor themselves what happiness is. The reasoning again seems to\npresuppose, controversially, that self-reports of happiness employ a\nlife satisfaction view of happiness, the idea being that whether you\nare satisfied (\u201chappy\u201d) will depend on what you care\nabout. Alternatively, the point might be literally to leave it up to\nthe respondent to decide whether \u2018happy\u2019 means hedonic\nstate, emotional state, life satisfaction, or something else. Thus one\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d might mean \u201cmy\nexperience is generally pleasant,\u201d while another\u2019s might\nmean \u201cI am satisfied with my life as a whole.\u201d It is not\nclear, however, that asking ambiguous questions of this sort is a\nuseful enterprise, since different respondents will in effect be\nanswering different questions.\n\nTo measure happiness through self-reports, then, it may be wiser to\nemploy terms other than \u2018happiness\u2019 and its\ncognates\u2014terms whose meaning is relatively well-known and fixed.\nIn other words, researchers should decide in advance what they want to\nmeasure\u2014be it life satisfaction, hedonic state, emotional state,\nor something else\u2014and then ask questions that refer\nunambiguously to those\n states.[14]\n This stratagem may be all the more necessary in cross-cultural work,\nwhere finding suitable translations of \u2018happy\u2019 can be\ndaunting\u2014particularly when the English meaning of the term\nremains a matter of contention (Wierzbicka 2004).\n\nThis entry focuses on subjective well-being studies, since that work\nis standardly deemed \u201chappiness\u201d research. But\npsychological research on well-being can take other forms, notably in\nthe \u201ceudaimonic\u201d\u2014commonly opposed to\n\u201chedonic\u201d\u2014literature, which assesses a broader range\nof indicators taken to represent objective human needs, such as\nmeaning, personal growth, relatedness, autonomy, competence,\n etc.[15]\n (The assimilation of subjective well-being to the\n\u201chedonic\u201d realm may be misleading, since life satisfaction\nseems primarily to be a non-hedonic value, as noted earlier.)\nOther well-being instruments may not clearly fall under either the\n\u201chappiness\u201d or eudaimonic rubrics, for instance extending\nsubjective well-being measures by adding questions about the extent to\nwhich activities are seen as meaningful or worthwhile (White and Dolan\n2009). An important question going forward is how far well-being\nresearch needs to incorporate indicators beyond subjective\nwell-being.\n3.2 Empirical findings: overview\n\nThe scientific literature on happiness has grown to proportions far\ntoo large for this article to do more than briefly touch on a few\n highlights.[16]\n Here is a sampling of oft-cited claims:\n\nMost people are happy\nPeople adapt to most changes, tending to return over time to their\nhappiness \u201cset point\u201d\nPeople are prone to make serious mistakes in assessing and\npursuing happiness\nMaterial prosperity has a surprisingly modest impact on\nhappiness\n\n\nThe first claim, that most people are happy, appears to be a consensus\nposition among subjective well-being researchers (for a seminal\nargument, see Diener and Diener 1996). The contention reflects three\nlines of evidence: most people, in most places, report being happy;\nmost people report being satisfied with their lives; and most people\nexperience more positive affect than negative. On any of the major\ntheories of happiness, then, the evidence seems to show that most\npeople are, indeed, happy. Yet this conclusion might be resisted, on a\ncouple of grounds. First, life satisfaction theorists might question\nwhether self-reports of life satisfaction suffice to establish that\npeople are in fact satisfied with their lives. Perhaps self-reports\ncan be mistaken, say if the individual believes herself satisfied yet\nshows many signs of dissatisfaction in her behavior, for instance\ncomplaining about or striving to change important things in her life.\nSecond, defenders of affect-based theories\u2014hedonistic and\nemotional state views\u2014might reject the notion that a bare\nmajority of positive affect suffices for happiness. While the\ntraditional view among hedonists has indeed been that happiness\nrequires no more than a >1:1 ratio of positive to negative affect,\nthis contention has received little defense and has been disputed in\nthe recent literature. Some investigators have claimed\nthat \u201cflourishing\u201d requires greater than a 3:1 ratio of\npositive to negative affect, as this ratio might represent a threshold\nfor broadly favorable psychological functioning (e.g., Larsen and\nPrizmic 2008). While the evidence for any specific ratio is highly\ncontroversial, if anything like this proportion were adopted as the\nthreshold for happiness, on a hedonistic or emotional state theory,\nthen some of the evidence taken to show that people are happy could in\nfact show the opposite. In any event, the empirical claim relies\nheavily on nontrivial philosophical views about the nature of\nhappiness, illustrating one way in which philosophical work on\nhappiness can inform scientific research.\n\nThe second claim, regarding adaptation and set points, reflects\nwell-known findings that many major life events, like being disabled\nin an accident or winning the lottery, appear strongly to impact\nhappiness only for a relatively brief period, after which individuals\nmay return to a level of happiness not very different from\n before.[17]\n As well, twin studies have found that subjective well-being is\nsubstantially heritable, with .50 being a commonly accepted figure.\nConsequently many researchers have posited that each individual has a\ncharacteristic \u201cset point\u201d level of happiness, toward\nwhich he tends to gravitate over time. Such claims have caused some\nconsternation over whether the pursuit and promotion of happiness are\nlargely futile enterprises (Lykken and Tellegen 1996; Millgram 2000).\nHowever, the dominant view now seems to be that the early claims about\nextreme adaptation and set points were exaggerated: while adaptation\nis a very real phenomenon, many factors\u2014including\ndisability\u2014can have substantial, and lasting, effects on how\nhappy people\n are.[18]\n This point was already apparent from the literature on correlates and\ncauses of happiness, discussed below: if things like relationships and\nengaging work are important for happiness, then happiness is probably\nnot simply a matter of personality or temperament. As well, the large\ncross-national differences in measured happiness are unlikely to be\nentirely an artifact of personality variables. Note that even highly\nheritable traits can be strongly susceptible to improvement. Better\nliving conditions have raised the stature of men in the Netherlands by\neight inches\u2014going from short (five foot four) to tall (over six\nfeet)\u2014in the last 150 years (Fogel 2005). Yet height is\nconsidered much more heritable than happiness, with typical\nheritability estimates ranging from .60 to over .90 (e.g.,\nSilventoinen, Sammalisto et al.\n 2003).[19]\n3.3 The sources of happiness\n\nThe question of mistakes will be taken up in section 5.2. But the last\nclaim\u2014that material prosperity has relatively modest impacts on\nhappiness\u2014has lately become the subject of heated debate. For\nsome time the standard view among subjective well-being researchers\nwas that, beyond a low threshold where basic needs are met, economic\ngains have only a small impact on happiness levels. According to the\nwell-known \u201cEasterlin Paradox,\u201d for instance, wealthier\npeople do tend to be happier within nations, but richer nations are\nlittle happier than less prosperous counterparts, and\u2014most\nstrikingly\u2014economic growth has virtually no impact (Easterlin\n1974). In the U.S., for example, measured happiness has not increased\nsignificantly since at least 1947, despite massive increases in wealth\nand income. In short, once you\u2019re out of poverty, absolute\nlevels of wealth and income make little difference in how happy people\nare.\n\nAgainst these claims, some authors have argued that absolute income\nhas a large impact on happiness across the income spectrum (e.g.,\nStevenson and Wolfers 2008). The question continues to be much\ndebated, but in 2010 a pair of large-scale studies using Gallup data\nsets, including improved measures of life satisfaction and affect,\nsuggested that both sides may be partly right (Kahneman and Deaton\n2010; Diener, Ng et al. 2010). Surveying large numbers of\nAmericans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally\nrepresentative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found\nthat income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global\nsample), at all levels, with life satisfaction\u2014strictly\nspeaking, a \u201clife evaluation\u201d measure that asks\nrespondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are\nsatisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect\nmeasures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, \u2013.09\nfor negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above\n$75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). For more recent\ndiscussions of empirical work, see Jebb et al. 2018 along with\nrelevant chapters in Diener et al. 2018 and the annual World Happiness\nReports from 2012 onward (Helliwell et al. 2012). Research on the\ncomplex money-happiness relationship resists simple characterization,\nbut a crude summary is that the connection tends to be positive and\nsubstantial, strong at lower income levels while modest to weak or\neven negative at higher incomes, and stronger and less prone to\nsatiation for life evaluation than emotional well-being metrics. But again, these are very rough generalizations that gloss over a variety of important factors and admit of many exceptions across both individuals and societies.\n\nIn short, the relationship between money and happiness may depend on\nwhich theory of happiness we accept: on a life satisfaction view, the\nrelationship may be strong; whereas affect-based views may yield a\nmuch weaker connection, again above some modest threshold. Here,\nagain, philosophical views about the nature and significance of\nhappiness may play an important role in understanding empirical\nresults and their practical upshot. Economic growth, for instance, has\nlong been a top priority for governments, and findings about its\nimpact on human well-being may have substantial implications for\npolicy.\n\nIt is important to note that studies of this nature focus on generic\ntrends, not specific cases, and there is no dispute that significant\nexceptions exist\u2014notably, populations that enjoy high levels of\nhappiness amid low levels of material prosperity. Among others, a\nnumber of Latin American countries, Maasai herders, Inughuit\nhunter-gatherers, and Amish communities have registered highly\npositive results in subjective well-being studies, sometimes higher\nthan those in many affluent nations, and numerous informal accounts\naccord with the\n data.[20]\n Such \u201cpositive outliers\u201d suggest that some societies can\nsupport high levels of happiness with extremely modest material\nholdings. The importance of money for happiness may depend strongly on\nwhat kind of society one inhabits. An interesting question,\nparticularly in light of common environmental concerns, is how far the\nlessons of such societies can, or should, be transferred to other\nsocial forms, where material attainment and happiness are presently\nmore tightly coupled. Perhaps some degree of decoupling of happiness\nand money would be desirable.\n\nSo the role of money in happiness appears, at this juncture, to be a\nmixed bag, depending heavily on how we conceive of happiness and what\nrange of societies we are considering. What (else), then, does matter\nmost for happiness? There is no definitive list of the main sources of\nhappiness in the literature, partly because it is not clear how to\ndivide them up. But the following items seem generally to be accepted\nas among the chief correlates of happiness: supportive relationships, engagement\nin interesting and challenging activities, material and physical\nsecurity, a sense of meaning or purpose, a positive outlook, and\nautonomy or\n control.[21]\n Significant correlates may also include\u2014among many\nothers\u2014religion, good governance, trust, helping others, values\n(e.g., having non-materialistic values), achieving goals, not being\nunemployed, and connection with the natural\n environment.[22]\n\nAn illustrative study of the correlates of happiness from a global\nperspective is the Gallup World Poll study noted earlier (Diener, Ng\net al. 2010; see also Jebb et al. 2020). In that study, the\nlife satisfaction measure was more strongly related to material\nprosperity, as noted above: household income, along with possession of\nluxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living. The\naffect measures, by contrast, correlated most strongly with what the\nauthors call \u201cpsychosocial prosperity\u201d: whether people\nreported being treated with respect in the last day, having family and\nfriends to count on, learning something new, doing what they do best,\nand choosing how their time was spent.\n\nWhat these results show depends partly on the reliability of the\nmeasures. One possible source of error is that this study might\nexaggerate the relationship between life satisfaction and material\nattainments through the use of a \u201cladder\u201d scale for life\nevaluation, ladders being associated with material aspirations. Errors\nmight also arise through salience biases whereby material concerns\nmight be more easily recalled than other important values, such as\nwhether one has succeeded in having children; or through differences\nin positivity biases across income levels (perhaps wealthier people\ntend to be more \u201cpositive-responding\u201d than poorer\nindividuals). Another question is whether the affect measures\nadequately track the various dimensions of people\u2019s emotional\nlives. However, the results are roughly consonant with other research,\nso they are unlikely to be entirely an artifact of the instruments\nused in this\n study.[23]\n A further point of uncertainty is the causal story behind the\ncorrelations\u2014whether the correlates, like psychosocial\nprosperity, cause happiness; whether happiness causes them; whether\nother factors cause both; or, as is likely, some combination of the\nthree.\n\nSuch concerns duly noted, the research plausibly suggests that, on\naverage, material progress has some tendency to help people to better\nget what they want in life, as found in the life satisfaction\nmeasures, while relationships and engaging activities are more\nimportant for people\u2019s emotional lives. What this means for\nhappiness depends on which view of happiness is correct.\n4. The importance of happiness\n4.1 Doubts about the value of happiness\n\nWere you to survey public attitudes about the value of happiness, at\nleast in liberal Western democracies, you would likely find\nconsiderable support for the proposition that happiness is all that\nreally matters for human well-being. Many philosophers over the ages\nhave likewise endorsed such a view, typically assuming a hedonistic\naccount of happiness. (A few, like Almeder 2000, have identified\nwell-being with happiness understood as life satisfaction.)\n\nMost philosophers, however, have rejected hedonistic and other mental\nstate accounts of well-being, and with them the idea that happiness\ncould suffice for\n well-being.[24]\n (See the entry on\n well-being.)\n Objections to mental state theories of well-being tend to cluster\naround two sets of concerns. First, it is widely believed that the\nnon-mental conditions of our lives matter\nfor well-being: whether our families really love us, whether our\nputative achievements are genuine, whether the things we care about\nactually obtain. The most influential objection of this sort is Robert\nNozick\u2019s experience machine case, wherein we are asked to\nimagine a virtual reality device that can perfectly simulate any\nreality for its user, who will think the experience is genuine (Nozick\n1974). Would you plug in to such a machine for life? Most people would\nnot, and the case is widely taken to vitiate mental state theories of\nwell-being. Beyond having positive mental states, it seems to matter\nboth that our lives go well and that our state of mind is\nappropriately related to how things \n are.[25]\n\nA second set of objections concerns various ways in which a happy\nperson might nonetheless seem intuitively to be leading an\nimpoverished or stunted life. The most influential of these\nworries involves adaptation, where individuals facing\noppressive circumstances scale back their expectations and find\ncontentment in \u201csmall mercies,\u201d as Sen put\n it.[26]\n Even a slave might come to internalize the values of his oppressors\nand be happy, and this strikes most as an unenviable life indeed.\nRelated worries involve people with diminished capacities\n(blindness, Down Syndrome), or choosing to lead narrow and\ncramped or simpleminded lives (e.g., counting blades of grass).\nWorries about impoverished lives are a prime motivator of Aristotelian\ntheories of well-being, which emphasize the full and proper exercise\nof our human capacities.\n\nIn the face of these and other objections most commentators have\nconcluded that neither happiness nor any other mental state can\nsuffice for well-being. Philosophical interest in happiness has\nconsequently flagged, since its theoretical importance becomes unclear\nif it does not play a starring role in our account of the good.\n\nEven as happiness might fail to suffice for well-being, well-being\nitself may be only one component of a good life, and not the\nmost important one at that. Here \u2018good life\u2019 means a life\nthat is good all things considered, taking account of all the values\nthat matter in life, whether they benefit the individual or not. Kant,\nfor example, considered both morality and well-being to be important\nbut distinct elements of a good life. Yet morality should be our first\npriority, never to be sacrificed for personal happiness.\n\nIn fact there is a broad consensus, or near-consensus, among ethical\ntheorists on a doctrine we might call the priority of virtue:\nbroadly and crudely speaking, the demands of virtue or morality trump\nother values in\n life.[27]\n We ought above all to act and live well, or at least not badly or\nwrongly. This view need not take the strong form of insisting that we\nmust always act as virtuously as possible, or that moral reasons\nalways take precedence. But it does mean, at least, that when being\nhappy requires acting badly, one\u2019s happiness must be sacrificed.\nIf it would be wrong to leave your family, in which you are unhappy,\nthen you must remain unhappy, or find more acceptable ways to seek\nhappiness.\n\nThe mainstream views in all three of the major approaches to ethical\ntheory\u2014consequentialism, deontology, and virtue\nethics\u2014agree on some form of the priority of virtue. Where these\nviews chiefly differ is not on the importance of being good, but on\nwhether being good necessarily benefits us. Virtue ethicists\ntend to answer in the affirmative, the other two schools in the\nnegative. Building virtue into well-being, as Aristotelians do, may\nseem to yield a more demanding ethics, and in some ways it does. Yet\nmany deontologists and consequentialists\u2014notably\nKant\u2014advocate sterner, more starkly moralistic visions of the\ngood life than Aristotle would ever have dreamt of (e.g., Singer\n1972).\n\nHappiness, in short, is believed by most philosophers to be\ninsufficient for well-being, and still less important for the good\nlife. These points may seem to vitiate any substantial role for\nhappiness in ethical thought. However, well-being itself is still\nregarded as a central concept in ethical thought, denoting one of the\nchief elements of a good life even if not the sole element. And there\nare reasons for thinking happiness important, both practically and\ntheoretically, despite the worries noted above.\n4.2 Restoring happiness to the theory of well-being\n\nEven if happiness does not suffice for well-being\u2014a point that\nnot all philosophers would accept\u2014it might still rate a\nprivileged spot in theories of well-being. This could happen in either\nof two ways.\n\nFirst, happiness could be a major component of a theory of\nwell-being. Objective list theories of well-being sometimes include\nhappiness or related mental states such as enjoyment among the\nfundamental constituents of well-being. A more ambitious proposal,\noriginated by L.W. Sumner, identifies well-being with authentic\nhappiness\u2014happiness that is authentic in the sense of being\nboth informed and autonomous (Sumner 1996). The root idea is that\nwell-being involves being happy, where one\u2019s happiness is a\nresponse of one\u2019s own (autonomous), to a life that\ngenuinely is one\u2019s own (informed). The authenticity\nconstraint is meant to address both experience machine-type worries\nand \u201chappy slave\u201d objections relating to adaptation, where\nhappiness may be non-autonomous, depending on manipulation or the\nuncritical acceptance of oppressive values. Since these have been the\nmost influential objections to mental state accounts of well-being,\nSumner\u2019s approach promises to considerably strengthen the\nposition of happiness-centered approaches to well-being, and several\nphilosophers have developed variants or close relations of the\nauthentic happiness theory (Br\u00fclde 2007, Haybron 2008a,\nTiberius and Plakias 2010, Vi\u0161ak 2015). The approach remains fairly\nnew, however, so its long-term prospects remain \nunclear.[28]\n\nA second strategy forsakes the project of giving a unitary theory of\nwell-being, recognizing instead a family of two or more kinds of\nprudential value. Happiness could be central to, or even exhaustive\nof, one of those values. Shelly Kagan, for instance, has suggested\nthat welfare hedonism could be correct as a theory of how well a\nperson is doing, but not of how well a person\u2019s\nlife is going, which should perhaps be regarded as a distinct\nvalue (Kagan 1992, 1994). In short, we might distinguish narrow and\nwide well-being concepts. An experience machine user might be doing\nwell in the narrow sense, but not the wide\u2014she is doing well,\nthough her life is quite sad. Happiness might, then, suffice for\nwell-being, but only in the narrow sense. Others have made similar\npoints, but uptake has been limited, perhaps because distinguishing\nmultiple concepts of prudential value makes the already difficult job\nof giving a theory of well-being much harder, as Kagan pointedly\n observes.[29]\n An interesting possibility is that the locution \u2018happy\nlife\u2019, and the corresponding well-being sense of happiness,\nactually refers to a specific variety of well-being\u2014perhaps\nwell-being in the wide sense just suggested, or well-being taken as an\nideal state, an ultimate goal of deliberation. This might explain the\ncontinued use of \u2018happiness\u2019 for the well-being notion in\nthe philosophical literature, rather than the more standard\n\u2018wellbeing.\u2019\n4.3 Is happiness overrated?\n\nThe preceding section discussed ways that happiness might figure\nprominently even in non-mental state theories of well-being. The\nquestion there concerned the role of happiness in theories of\nwell-being. This is a different question from how important happiness\nis for well-being itself. Even a theory of well-being that includes no\nmention at all of happiness can allow that happiness is nonetheless a\nmajor component or contributor to well-being, because of its relation\nto the things that ultimately constitute well-being. If you hold a\ndesire theory of well-being, for instance, you will very likely allow\nthat, for most people, happiness is a central aspect of well-being,\nsince most people very much desire to be happy. Indeed, some desire\ntheorists have argued that the account actually yields a form of\nhedonism, on the grounds that people ultimately desire nothing else\nbut happiness or pleasure (Sidgwick 1907 [1966], Brandt 1979,\n1989).\n\nHappiness may be thought important even on theories normally believed\nto take a dismissive view of it. Aristotelians identify well-being\nwith virtuous activity, yet Aristotle plainly takes this to be a\nhighly pleasant condition, indeed the most pleasant kind of life there\nis (see, e.g., NE, Bk. I 8; Bk. VII 13). You cannot flourish,\non Aristotelian terms, without being happy, and unhappiness is clearly\nincompatible with well-being. Even the Stoics, who notoriously regard\nall but a virtuous inner state as at best indifferent, would still\nassign happiness a kind of importance: at the very least, to be\nunhappy would be unvirtuous; and virtue itself arguably entails a kind\nof happiness, namely a pleasant state of tranquility. As well,\nhappiness would likely be a preferred indifferent in most cases, to be\nchosen over unhappiness. To be sure, both Aristotelian and Stoic\naccounts are clear that happiness alone does not suffice for\nwell-being, that its significance is not what common opinion takes it\nto be, and that some kinds of happiness can be worthless or even bad.\nBut neither denies that happiness is somehow quite important for human\nwell-being.\n\nIn fact it is questionable whether any major school of philosophical\nthought denies outright the importance of happiness, at least on one\nof the plausible accounts of the matter. Doubts about its significance\nprobably owe to several factors. Some skeptics, for example, focus on\nrelatively weak conceptions of happiness, such as the idea that it is\nlittle more than the simple emotion of feeling happy\u2014an\nidea that few hedonists or emotional state theorists would accept. Or,\nalternatively, assuming that a concern for happiness has only to do\nwith positive states. Yet \u2018happiness\u2019 also serves as a\nblanket term for a domain of concern that involves both positive\nand negative states, namely the kinds of mental states\ninvolved in being happy or unhappy. Just as \u201chealth\u201d care\ntends to focus mainly on ill health, so might happiness researchers\nchoose to focus much of their effort on the study and alleviation of\nunhappiness\u2014depression, suffering, anxiety, and other conditions\nwhose importance is uncontroversial. The study of happiness need be no\nmore concerned with smiles than with frowns.\n5. The pursuit and promotion of happiness\n5.1 Normative issues\n\nThe last set of questions we will examine centers on the pursuit of\nhappiness, both individual and collective. Most of the popular\nliterature on happiness discusses how to make oneself happier, with\nlittle attention given to whether this is an appropriate goal, or how\nvarious means of pursuing happiness measure up from an ethical\nstandpoint. More broadly, how if at all should one pursue happiness as\npart of a good life?\n\nWe saw earlier that most philosophers regard happiness as secondary to\nmorality in a good life. The individual pursuit of happiness may be\nsubject to nonmoral norms as well, prudence being the most obvious\namong them. Prudential norms need not be as plain as\n\u201cdon\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot.\u201d On\nSumner\u2019s authentic happiness view of well-being, for instance,\nwe stand to gain little by pursuing happiness in inauthentic ways, for\ninstance through self-deception or powerful drugs like Huxley\u2019s\nsoma, which guarantees happiness come what may (Huxley 1932\n[2005]). The view raises interesting questions about the benefits of\nless extreme pharmaceuticals, such as the therapeutic use of\nantidepressants; such medications can make life more pleasant, but\nmany people worry whether they pose a threat to authenticity, perhaps\nundercutting their benefits. It is possible that such drugs involve\nprudential tradeoffs, promoting well-being in some ways while\nundermining it in others; whether the tradeoffs are worth it will\ndepend on how, in a given case, the balance is struck. Another\npossibility is that such drugs sometimes promote\nauthenticity, if for instance a depressive disorder prevents a person\nfrom being \u201chimself.\u201d\n\nLooking to more broadly ethical, but not yet moral, norms, it may be\npossible to act badly without acting either immorally or imprudently.\nWhile Aristotle himself regarded acting badly as inherently imprudent,\nhis catalogue of virtues is instructive, as many of them (wit,\nfriendliness, etc.) are not what we normally regard as moral virtues.\nSome morally permissible methods of pursuing happiness may nonetheless\nbe inappropriate because they conflict with such \u201cethical\u201d\nvirtues. They might, for instance, be undignified or imbecilic.\n\nOutwardly virtuous conduct undertaken in the name of personal\nhappiness might, if wrongly motivated, be incompatible with genuine\nvirtue. One might, for instance, engage in philanthropy solely to make\noneself happier, and indeed work hard at fine-tuning one\u2019s\nassistance to maximize the hedonic payoff. This sort of conduct would\nnot obviously instantiate the virtue of compassion or kindness, and\nindeed might be reasonably deemed contemptible. Similarly, it might be\nadmirable, morally or otherwise, to be grateful for the good things in\none\u2019s life. Yet the virtue of gratitude might be undermined by\ncertain kinds of gratitude intervention, whereby one tries to become\nhappier by focusing on the things one is grateful for. If expressions\nof gratitude become phony or purely instrumental, the sole reason for\ngiving thanks being to become happy\u2014and not that one actually\nhas something to be thankful for\u2014then the\n\u201cgratitude\u201d might cease to be admirable, and may indeed be\nunvirtuous.[30]\n5.2 Mistakes in the pursuit of happiness\n\nA different question is what means of pursuing happiness are most\neffective. This is fundamentally an empirical question, but\nthere are some in-principle issues that philosophical reflection might\ninform. One oft-heard claim, commonly called the \u201cparadox of\nhedonism,\u201d is that the pursuit of happiness is self-defeating;\nto be happy, don\u2019t pursue happiness. It is not clear how to\ninterpret this dictum, however, so that it is both interesting and\ntrue. It is plainly imprudent to make happiness one\u2019s focus at\nevery moment, but doubtful that this has often been denied. Yet never\nconsidering happiness also seems an improbable strategy for becoming\nhappier. If you are choosing among several equally worthwhile\noccupations, and have good evidence that some of them will make you\nmiserable, while one of them is likely to be highly fulfilling, it\nwould not seem imprudent to take that information into account. Yet to\ndo so just is to pursue happiness. The so-called paradox of hedonism\nis perhaps best seen as a vague caution against focusing too much on\nmaking oneself happy, not a blanket dismissal of the prospects for\nexpressly seeking happiness\u2014and for this modest point there is\ngood empirical evidence (Schooler, Ariely et al. 2003,\nLyubomirsky 2007).\n\nThat happiness is sometimes worth seeking does not mean we will always\ndo a good job of it (Haybron 2008b). In recent decades a massive body\nof empirical evidence has gathered on various ways in which people\nseem systematically prone to make mistakes in the pursuit of their\ninterests, including happiness. Such tendencies have been suggested in\nseveral domains relating to the pursuit of happiness, including (with\nrecent surveys cited):\n\nAssessing how happy we are, or were in the past (Haybron 2007)\nPredicting (\u201cforecasting\u201d) what will make us happy\n(Gilbert 2006)\nChoosing rationally (Kahneman and Tversky 2000, Gilovitch, Griffin\net al. 2002, Hsee and Hastie 2006)\n\n\nA related body of literature explores the costs and benefits of\n(ostensibly) making it easier to pursue happiness by increasing\npeople\u2019s options; it turns out that having more choices might\noften make people less happy, for instance by increasing the\nburdens of deliberation or the likelihood of regret (Schwartz 2004).\nLess discussed in this context, but highly relevant, is the large body\nof research indicating that human psychology and behavior are\nremarkably prone to unconscious social and other situational\ninfluences, most infamously reported in the Milgram obedience\nexperiments (Doris 2002, 2015, Haybron 2014). Human\nfunctioning, and the pursuit of happiness, may be more profoundly\nsocial than many commentators have \n assumed.[31] \n\nTaken together, this research bears heavily on two central questions\nin the philosophical literature: first, the broad character of human\nnature (e.g., in what sense are we rational animals? How should we\nconceive of human autonomy?); second, the philosophical ideals of the\ngood society and good government.\n5.3 The politics of happiness\n\nJust a decade ago the idea of happiness policy was something of a\nnovelty. While it remains on the fringes in some locales, notably the\nUnited States, in much of the world there has been a surge of interest\nin making happiness an explicit target of policy consideration.\nAttention has largely shifted, however, to a broader focus on\nwell-being to reflect not just happiness but also other welfare\nconcerns of citizens, and dozens of governments now incorporate\nwell-being metrics in their national \nstatistics.[32] \n\nLet\u2019s consider the rationale for policies aimed at promoting\nwell-being. In political thought, the modern liberal tradition has\ntended to assume an optimistic view of human nature and the\nindividual\u2019s capacities for prudent choice. Partly for this\nreason, the preservation and expansion of individual freedoms,\nincluding people\u2019s options, is widely taken to be a central\ngoal, if not the goal, of legitimate governments. People\nshould be freed to seek the good life as they see it, and beyond that\nthe state should, by and large, stay out of the well-being-promotion\nbusiness.\n\nThis vision of the good society rests on empirical assumptions that\nhave been the subject of considerable debate. If it turns out that\npeople systematically and predictably err in the pursuit of their\ninterests, then it may be possible for governments to devise policies\nthat correct for such\n mistakes.[33]\n Of course, government intervention can introduce other sorts of\nmistakes, and there is some debate about whether such measures are\nlikely to do more harm than good (e.g., Glaeser 2006).\n\nBut even if governments cannot effectively counteract human\nimprudence, it may still be that people fare better in social forms\nthat influence or even constrain choices in ways that make serious\nmistakes less likely. (Food culture and its impact on health may be an\ninstructive example here.) The idea that people tend to fare best when\ntheir lives are substantially constrained or guided by their social\nand physical context has recently been dubbed contextualism;\nthe contrary view, that people do best when their lives are, as much\nas possible, determined by the individuals themselves, is\nindividualism (Haybron 2008b). Recent contextualists include\ncommunitarians and many perfectionists, though contextualism is not a\npolitical doctrine and is compatible with liberalism and even\nlibertarian political morality. Contextualism about the promotion of\nwell-being is related to recent work in moral psychology that\nemphasizes the social character of human agency, such as situationism\nand social\n intuitionism.[34]\n\nQuite apart from matters of efficacy, there are moral questions about\nthe state promotion of happiness, which has been a major subject of\ndebate, both because of the literature on mistakes and research\nsuggesting that the traditional focus of state efforts to promote\nwell-being, economic growth, has a surprisingly modest impact on\n happiness.\n One concern is paternalism: does happiness-based policy\ninfringe too much on personal liberty? Some fear a politics that may\ntoo closely approximate Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, where the\nstate ensures a drug-induced happiness for all (Huxley 1932 [2005]).\nExtant policy suggestions, however, have been more modest. Efforts to\nsteer choice, for instance in favor of retirement savings, may be\npaternalistic, but advocates argue that such policies can be\nsufficiently light-handed that no one should object to them, in some\ncases even going so far as to deem it \u201clibertarian\npaternalism\u201d (Thaler and Sunstein\n 2008).[35]\n The idea is that gentle \u201cnudges,\u201d like setting default\noptions on hiring forms to setting aside money for retirement,\ninterfere only trivially with choice, imposing little or no cost for\nthose who wish to choose differently, and would very likely be\nwelcomed by most of those targeted.\n\nAlso relatively light-handed, and perhaps not paternalistic at all,\nare state efforts to promote happiness directly through social policy,\nfor instance by prioritizing unemployment over economic growth on the\ngrounds that the former has a larger impact on happiness. Other\npolicies might include trying to reduce commute times, or making\nwalkable neighborhoods and green space a priority in urban planning,\nagain on happiness grounds. Some may deem such measures paternalistic\ninsofar as they trade freedom (in the form of economic prosperity) for\na substantive good, happiness, that people value unevenly, though it\nhas also been argued that refusing to take citizens\u2019 values like\nhappiness into consideration in policy deliberation on their behalf\ncan amount to paternalism (Haybron and Alexandrova 2013). \n\nA related sort of objection to happiness-based policy argues that\nhappiness, or even well-being, is simply the wrong object of policy,\nwhich ought instead to focus on the promotion of resources or\ncapabilities (Rawls 1971, Nussbaum 2000, Quong 2011, Sen 2009).\nSeveral reasons have been cited for this sort of view, one being that\npolicies aimed at promoting happiness or well-being violate commonly\naccepted requirements of \u201cliberal neutrality,\u201d according\nto which policy must be neutral among conceptions of the good.\nAccording to this constraint, governments must not promote any view of\nthe good life, and happiness-based policy might be argued to flout it.\nWorries about paternalism also surface here, the idea being that\nstates should only focus on affording people the option to be\nhappy or whatever, leaving the actual achievement of well-being up to\nthe autonomous individual. As we just saw, however, it is not clear\nhow far happiness policy initiatives actually infringe on personal\nliberty or autonomy. A further worry is that, happiness isn\u2019t\nreally, or primarily, what matters for human well-being (Nussbaum\n2008). \n\nBut a major motivation for thinking happiness the wrong object of\npolicy is that neither happiness nor well-being are the appropriate\nfocus of a theory of justice. What justice requires of\nsociety, on this view, is not that it make us happy; we do not have a\nright to be happy. Rather, justice demands only that each has\nsufficient opportunity (in the form of resources or capabilities, say)\nto achieve a good life, or that each gets a fair share of the benefits\nof social cooperation. However plausible such points may be, it is not\nclear how far they apply to many proposals for happiness-based policy,\nsave the strongest claims that happiness should be the sole\naim of policy: many policy decisions are not primarily concerned with\nquestions of social justice, nor with constitutional fundamentals, the\nfocus of some theories of justice. Happiness could be a poor candidate\nfor the \u201ccurrency\u201d of justice, yet still remain a major\npolicy concern. Indeed, the chief target of happiness policy advocates\nhas been, not theories of justice, but governments\u2019 overwhelming\nemphasis on promoting GDP and other indices of economic growth. This\nis not, in the main, a debate about justice, and as of yet the\nphilosophical literature has not extensively engaged with it.\n\nHowever, the push for happiness-based policy is a recent development.\nIn coming years, such questions will likely receive considerably more\nattention in the philosophical literature.\n",
