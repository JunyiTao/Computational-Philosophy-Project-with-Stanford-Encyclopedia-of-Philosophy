    "main_text": "Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism || Ernst Mach\n2.1 Ernst Mach\n\nErnst Mach (1838\u20131916) occupies a central position in the\nhistory of neutral monism. He influenced William James and Bertrand\nRussell and, through them, all of the writers on neutral monism in the\nEnglish-speaking world. His importance for the development of the view\nin the German-speaking world is hard to overestimate. Among the\nphilosophers to build on Mach\u2019s ideas was Rudolf Carnap in his\nAufbau (1928). As a physicist who also did physiological and\npsychological research, Mach strove to adopt an inclusive and\neconomical framework that would allow him to pursue all of these\ninquiries in a unified and coherent fashion. In the simple components\nof experience\u2014colors, sounds, pressures, intensities, times,\nspaces, motor sensations, etc.\u2014he finds typical examples of a\nmuch larger group of elements whose functional interrelations are\nstudied by the various sciences (see Banks 2014, ch. 1 on the resolute\nrealism of Mach\u2019s view). While a given element is,\nintrinsically, neither mental nor physical, the various groups to\nwhich it belongs may display functional relationships that are\ncharacteristic of physics or of psychology. In this case the neutral\nelement forms part of the subject matter of physics and of psychology,\nrespectively. In the following quotation Mach uses a color and our\nperception of it to illustrate this point. A single neutral\nelement\u2014the color\u2014gets to be both the physical color of a\nphysical object and our mental perception/sensation of it. The color\ncan be called physical, qua constituent of the one group, and\nmental, qua constituent of the other group, but is the same\nunchanging and intrinsically neutral element that figures in these two\ndifferent contexts:\n\nThus the great gulf between physical and psychological research\npersists only when we acquiesce in our habitual stereotyped\nconceptions. A color is a physical object as soon as we consider its\ndependence, for instance, upon its luminous source, upon other colors,\nupon temperatures, upon spaces, and so forth. When we consider,\nhowever, its dependence upon the retina\u2026it is a psychological\nobject, a sensation. Not the subject matter, but the direction of\ninvestigation, is different in the two domains. (Mach 1886:\n17\u201318)\n\n\nIn this way material objects and the ego are dissolved into\nelements/sensations that are related in certain complex ways. Spelled\nout for material objects, this reads:\n\nthing, body, matter, are nothing apart from the combinations of the\nelements,\u2014the colors, sounds, and so forth\u2014nothing apart\nfrom their so-called attributes. (Mach 1886: 7)\n\n\nAnd the fate of the ego is similar:\n\nThe primary fact is not the ego, but the elements\n(sensations)\u2026The elements constitute the I. I have the\nsensation green, signifies that the element green occurs in a given\ncomplex of other elements (sensations, memories). When I\ncease to have the sensation green, when I die, then the\nelements no longer occur in the ordinary, familiar association. That\nis all. Only an ideal mental-economical unity, not a real unity, has\nceased to exist. (Mach 1886: 23\u201324)\n\n\nFor Mach the world presents itself as \u201ca viscous mass [of\nelements], at certain places (as in the ego) more firmly coherent than\nin others\u201d (Mach 1886: 17). The neutral elements (only a minute\nfraction of which are sensations) and their relations are the basic\nreality. We draw boundaries around certain groups of elements that are\nrelated to each other in interesting ways, because this serves our\nbiological, scientific, and/or practical purposes. We can continue to\ntalk about material things and selves; it is economical to do so. But,\nstrictly speaking, \u201cboth [object and ego] are provisional\nfictions of the same kind\u201d (Mach 1905: 9).\n\nThe primary source for Mach\u2019s views on neutral monism are a\nnumber of essays and chapters contained in his books originally\npublished in 1883, 1886, 1894, and 1905. The size of these books grew\nsignificantly as they went through numerous editions. Some of the\nimportant papers on neutral monism are not contained in the available\nEnglish translations of these works.\n",
