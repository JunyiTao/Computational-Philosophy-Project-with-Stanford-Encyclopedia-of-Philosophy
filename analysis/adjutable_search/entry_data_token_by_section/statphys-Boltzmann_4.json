The Sto\u00dfzahlansatz and the ergodic hypothesis\n\n\nBoltzmann's first paper (1866) in statistical physics aimed to reduce\nthe second law to mechanics. Within the next two years he became\nacquainted with Maxwell's papers on gas theory of 1860 and 1867, which\nintroduced probability notions in the description of the gas. Maxwell\nhad studied specific mechanical models for a gas (as a system of hard\nspheres (1860) or of point particles exerting a mutual force on each\nother inversely proportional to the fifth power of their distance),\nand characterized the state of such a gas by means of a probability\ndistribution f over the various values of the molecular\nvelocities \\(\\vec{v}\\). For Maxwell, the probability\n\\(f(\\vec{v})d^3\\vec{v}\\) denoted the relative number of particles in\nthe gas with a velocity between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} +\nd^3\\vec{v}\\).  In particular, he had argued that the state of\nequilibrium is characterized by the so-called Maxwell distribution\nfunction: \n\n\\[\nf(\\vec{v}) = Ae^{-|\\vec{v}|^2/B}\n\\]\n\n\n where \\(A\\) is a normalization constant and \\(B\\) is proportional to\nthe absolute temperature. \n\n\nThe argument that Maxwell had given in 1860 to single out this\ndistribution relied on the fact that this is the only probability\ndistribution that is both spherically symmetric and factorizes into\nfunctions of the orthogonal components \\(v_x, v_y, v_z\\)\nseparately. In 1867, however he replaced these desiderata with the\nmore natural requirement that the equilibrium distribution should be\nstationary, i.e. it should not change shape as a result of the\ncontinual collisions between the particles. This called for a more\nelaborate argument, involving a detailed consideration of the\ncollisions between particles. The crucial assumption in this argument\nis what is now known as the SZA. Roughly speaking, it states that the\nnumber of particle pairs, \\(dN(\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2)\\) with initial\nvelocities between \\(\\vec{v}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{v}_1 + d^3\\vec{v}_1\\) and\nbetween \\(\\vec{v}_2\\) and \\(\\vec{v}_2 + d^3\\vec{v}_2\\) respectively,\nwhich are about to collide in a time span \\(dt\\) is proportional\nto\n\n\\[\nN(\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2) \\propto N^2f(\\vec{v}_1)f(\\vec{v}_2) \\ dt \\ d^3\\vec{v}_1 \\ d^3\\vec{v}_2\n\\]\n\n\n where the proportionality constant depends on the geometry of the\ncollision and the relative velocity. For Maxwell, and Boltzmann later,\nthis assumption seemed almost self-evident. One ought to note,\nhowever, that by choosing the initial, rather than the final\nvelocities of the collision, the assumption introduced an explicit\ntime-asymmetric element. This, however, was not noticed until\n1895. Maxwell showed that, under the SZA, the distribution (1) is\nindeed stationary. He also argued, but much less convincingly, that it\nshould be the only stationary distribution.\n\n\nIn his (1868), Boltzmann set out to apply this argument to a variety\nof other models (including gases in a static external force field).\nHowever, Boltzmann started out with a somewhat different\ninterpretation of probability in mind than Maxwell. For him,\n\\(f(\\vec{v})d^3\\vec{v}\\) is introduced firstly as the relative time\nduring which a (given) particle has a velocity between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and\n\\(\\vec{v} + d^3\\vec{v}\\) (WA I, 50).  But, in the same breath, he\nidentifies this with the relative number of particles with this\nvelocity. This equivocation between different meanings of probability\nreturned again and again in Boltzmann's\nwriting.[7] Either\nway, of course, whether we average over time or particles,\nprobabilities are defined here in strictly mechanical terms, and\ntherefore objective properties of the gas. Yet apart from this\nstriking difference in interpretation, the first section of the paper\nis a straightforward continuation of the ideas Maxwell had developed\nin his 1867. In particular, the main ingredient is always played by\nthe SZA, or a version of that assumption suitably modified for the\ncase discussed.\n\n\nBut in the last section of the paper he suddenly shifts course. He now\nfocuses on a general Hamiltonian system, i.e., a system of N\nmaterial points with an arbitrary interaction potential. The state of\nthis system may be represented as a phase point \\(x =\n(\\vec{p}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{p}_N,\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\) in the\nmechanical phase space \\(\\Gamma\\). By the Hamiltonian equations of\nmotion, this point evolves in time, and thus describes a trajectory\n\\(x_t\\). This trajectory is constrained to lie on a given energy\nhypersurface \\(H(x) = E\\), where \\(H(x)\\) denotes the Hamiltonian\nfunction.\n\n\nNow consider an arbitrary probability density \\(\\rho(x)\\) over this\nphase space. He shows, by (what is now known as) Liouville's theorem,\nthat \\(\\rho\\) remains constant along a trajectory, i.e., \\(\\rho(x_0) =\n\\rho(x_t)\\). Assuming now for simplicity that all points in a given\nenergy hypersurface lie on a single trajectory, the probability should\nbe a constant over the energy hypersurface. In other words, the only\nstationary probability with fixed total energy is the microcanonical\ndistribution.\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{mc} = \\delta(H(x)-E),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is Dirac's delta function.\n\n\nBy integrating this expression over all momenta but one, and dividing\nthis by the integral of \\(\\rho_{mc}\\) over all momenta, Boltzmann\nobtained the marginal probability density \\(\\rho_{mc}(\\vec{p}_1 \\mid\n\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\) for particle 1's momentum,\nconditionalized on the particle positions\n\\(\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N\\).  He then showed that this marginal\nprobability distribution tends to the Maxwell distribution when the\nnumber of particles tends to infinity.\n\n\nSome comments on this result.\n\n\nFirst, the difference between the approach relying on the ergodic\nhypothesis and that relying on the SZA is rather striking. Instead of\nconcentrating on a specific gas model, Boltzmann here assumes a much\nmore general model with an arbitrary interaction potential\n\\(V(\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N)\\).  Moreover, the probability density\n\\(\\rho\\) is defined over phase space, instead of the space of\nmolecular velocities. This is the first occasion where probability\nconsiderations are applied to the state of the mechanical system as\nwhole, instead of its individual particles. If the transition between\nkinetic gas theory and statistical mechanics may be identified with\nthis caesura, (as argued by the Ehrenfests and by Klein) it would seem\nthat the transition has already been made right here in 1868, rather\nthan only in 1877. \n\n\nBut of course, for Boltzmann the transition did not involve a major\nconceptual move, thanks to his conception of probability as a relative\ntime. Thus, the probability of a particular state of the total system\nis still identified with the fraction of time in which that state is\noccupied by the system. In other words, he had no need for ensembles or\nnon-mechanical probabilistic assumptions in this paper.\n\n\nHowever, note that the equivocation between relative times and\nrelative numbers, which was relatively harmless in the first section\nof the 1868 paper, is no longer possible in the interpretation of\n\\(\\rho\\). The probability \\(\\rho_{mc}(\\vec{p}_1 \\mid\n\\vec{q}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{q}_N) d^3\\vec{p}_1\\) gives us the relative time\nthat the total system is in a state for which particle 1 has a\nmomentum between \\(\\vec{p}_1\\) and \\(\\vec{p}_1 + d^3\\vec{p}_1\\), for\ngiven values of all positions. There is no route back to infer that\nthis has anything to do with the relative number of particles with\nthis momentum.\n\n\nSecond, and more importantly, these results open up a perspective of great\ngenerality. It suggests that the probability of the molecular\nvelocities for an isolated system in a stationary state will always\nassume the Maxwellian form if the number of particles tends to\ninfinity. Notably, this argument completely dispenses with any\nparticular assumption about collisions, or other details of the\nmechanical model involved, apart from the assumption that it is\nHamiltonian. Indeed it need not even represent a gas.\n\n\nThird, and most importanty, the main weakness of the present result is its\nassumption that the trajectory actually visits all points on the\nenergy hypersurface.  This is what the Ehrenfests called the ergodic\n hypothesis.[8]\n Boltzmann returned to this issue on the final page of the paper\n(WA I, 96). He notes there that exceptions to his\ntheorem might occur, if the microscopic variables would not, in the\ncourse of time, take on all values compatible with the conservation of\nenergy. For example this would be the case when the trajectory is\nperiodic. However, Boltzmann observed, such cases would be immediately\ndestroyed by the slightest disturbance from outside, e.g., by the\ninteraction of a single external atom. He argued that these exceptions\nwould thus only provide cases of unstable equilibrium.\n\n\nStill, Boltzmann must have felt unsatisfied with his own argument.\nAccording to an editorial footnote in the collection of his scientific\npapers (WA I, 96), Boltzmann's personal copy of the paper contains a\nhand-written remark in the margin stating that the point was still\ndubious and that it had not been proven that, even including\ninteraction with an external atom, the trajectory would traverse all\npoints on the energy hypersurface.\n",
