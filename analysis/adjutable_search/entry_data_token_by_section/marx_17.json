    "main_text": "Economics || Exploitation\n4.3 Exploitation\n\nAs noted, traditionally Marx\u2019s definition of exploitation is\ngiven in terms of the theory of surplus value, which in turn is taken\nto depend on the labour theory of value: the theory that the value of\nany commodity is proportional to the amount of \u201csocially\nnecessary\u201d labour embodied in it. However, the question arises\nof whether the basic idea of exploitation should be so dependent on a\nparticular theory of value. For if it is, the notion of exploitation\nbecomes vulnerable to Robert Nozick\u2019s objection: that if the\nlabour theory of value can be shown to be faulty, the Marxist theory\nof exploitation collapses too (Nozick 1974).\n\nOthers have felt that it is possible to restore the intuitive core of\na Marxist theory of exploitation independent of the labour theory of\nvalue (cf. Cohen 1979, Wolff 1999, Vrousalis 2013). John Roemer, to\ntake one leading case, states:\n\n\nMarxian exploitation is defined as the unequal exchange of labor for\ngoods: the exchange is unequal when the amount of labor embodied in\nthe goods which the worker can purchase with his income \u2026 is\nless than the amount of labor he expended to earn that income.(Roemer\n1985: 30)\n\n\nSuppose I work eight hours to earn my wages. With this perhaps the\nbest thing I can buy is a coat. But imagine that the coat took only a\ntotal of four hours to make. Therefore I have exchanged my eight hours\nwork for only four hours of other people\u2019s work, and thereby, on\nthis view, I am exploited.\n\nThe definition requires some refinement. For example, if I am taxed\nfor the benefit of those unable to work, I will be exploited by the\nabove definition, but this is not what the definition of exploitation\nwas intended to capture. Worse still, if there is one person exploited\nmuch more gravely than anyone else in the economy, then it may turn\nout that no-one else is exploited. Nevertheless, it should not be\ndifficult to adjust the definition to take account of these\ndifficulties, and as noted several other accounts of Marx-inspired\naccounts of exploitation have been offered that are independent of the\nlabour theory of value.\n\nMany of these alternative definitions add a notion of unfreedom or\ndomination to unequal exchange of labour and goods (Vrousalis 2013).\nThe exploited person is forced to accept a situation in which he or\nshe just never gets back what they put into the labour process. Now\nthere may be, in particular cases, a great deal to be said about why\nthis is perfectly acceptable from a moral point of view. However, on\nthe face of it such exploitation appears to be unjust. Nevertheless,\nwe will see in the next section why attributing such a position to\nMarx himself is fraught with difficulty.\n",
