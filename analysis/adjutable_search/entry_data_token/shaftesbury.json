Introduction\n1.1 Life and works\n\nAnthony Ashley Cooper lived from 1671 to 1713. His grandfather, the\nfirst Earl of Shaftesbury, oversaw his early upbringing and put John\nLocke in charge of his education. He would eventually come to disagree\nwith many aspects of Locke\u2019s philosophy, but Locke was clearly a\ncrucially important influence on his philosophical development. The\ntwo remained friends until Locke\u2019s death. He served in\nParliament (before his father died, when he was Lord Ashley) and the\nHouse of Lords (after his father died, when he had became the third\nEarl). Ill health curtailed his political career when he was 30 years\nold. (The standard biography is Voitle 1984).\n\nThe first work he published was an edited collection of sermons by\nBenjamin Whichcote, in 1698. He wrote an unsigned preface to the\nsermons in which he praised Whichcote\u2019s belief in the goodness\nof human beings and urged his readers to use Whichcote\u2019s\n\u201cgood nature\u201d as an antidote to the poisonous egoism of\nHobbes and the pessimistic supralapsarianism of the Calvinists.\n\nIn 1699, John Toland arranged publication of an early version of the\nInquiry concerning Virtue. Shaftesbury later renounced this\nversion of the Inquiry, claiming that it was produced without\nhis authorization, although the details of the episode are\nunclear.\n\nMost of the works for which Shaftesbury is famous were written between\n1705\u20131710. It was during this period that he rewrote the\nInquiry concerning Virtue, or Merit and completed versions of\nThe Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody (the first version of\nwhich was called The Social Enthusiast, A Philosophical\nAdventure), A Letter concerning Enthusiasm, Sensus\nCommunis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour, and\nSoliloquy, or Advice to an Author.\n\nIn 1711, Shaftesbury collected his mature writings and added to them\nextensive notes and commentaries (which he called Miscellaneous\nReflections on the preceeding Treatises, and other Critical\nSubjects), naming the the resulting three-volume work\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. He revised\nCharacteristicks over the course of the next two years, up\nuntil his death in 1713. A version with his final changes appeared in\n1714.\n\nThere have been three recent editions of Characteristicks: a\nsingle volume edited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus\nby Klein (1999), with modernized spelling and punctuation; two volumes\nedited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus by Ayers\n(1999), with original typography; and three volumes with an\nintroduction by Den Uyl (2001), with original typography, and with the\naddition of \u201cA Notion of the Tablature, or Judgment of\nHercules\u201d and \u201cA Letter concerning Design.\u201d In this\nentry, I will refer (as \u2018C\u2019) to the online-accessible\nversion of Den Uyl\u2019s Liberty Fund edition, citing the volume and\noriginal page numbers.\n\nNot all of Shaftesbury\u2019s writings are collected in\nCharacteristicks. Some, such as Second Characters,\nhe intended to publish but did not complete; this might also be true\nof Chartae Socraticae and Pathologia (see Jaffro,\nMaurer, and Petit 2013). Others, such as The Adept Ladies, he\nmay have circulated privately but decided not to publish. Still\nothers, such as Askemata, he might have written for personal\nor therapeutic purposes rather than for public consumption. The most\ncomprehensive collection of Shaftesbury\u2019s published and\nunpublished writings is the Standard Edition: Complete Works,\nCorrespondence and Posthumous Writings, edited by Wolfram Benda\net al. (1981\u2013present).\n1.2 Purpose and form of philosophy\n\nAccording to Shaftesbury, the purpose of philosophy is to make us\nbetter people. Philosophy\u2019s job is to help us to improve\nourselves\u2014to \u201cregulate our governing Fancys, Passions, and\nHumours\u201d (C 1.283)\u2014so that we can become wiser, more\nvirtuous, and more organized selves. Philosophy is\n\u201cMastership in Life and Manners\u201d\n(C 3.159; see also 3.303). As Rivers\nputs it, philosophy for Shaftesbury is \u201cthe art of learning to\nlive well\u201d (Rivers 2000a: 87; see Klein 1994: 82). Den Uyl says,\nShaftesbury\u2019s \u201cmain purpose [is] to encourage, promote, or\notherwise foster an environment conducive to the exercise of\nvirtue\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 282).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s belief in the fundamentally\n\u201cself-improving\u201d (C 2.427) purpose of philosophy leads him\nto criticize the turgid, analytic methods of the Scholastics and of\nmodern thinkers such as Descartes and Locke (Schneewind 1998: 307 and\nRivers 2000a: 87). As one of his characters puts it, philosophy must\nbe rescued from its imprisonment in \u201cColleges and Cells\u201d\nwhere it has been immured by \u201cEmpiricks, and pedantick\nSophists\u201d (C 2.184). To achieve its proper goals, philosophy\nneeds to assume guises very different from the dry, unmoving texts of\nShaftesbury\u2019s predecessors.\n\nBecause he thinks that \u201cstraightforward discursive writing could\nhave little chances of successfully promoting virtue in a modern\ncontext,\u201d Shaftesbury presents his own ideas in \u201ca\ndaunting array of formats\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 276). These formats\ninclude: a letter to a friend, a manual for writers, an epistolary\nnovelistic dialogue, a series of \u201crandom\u201d\nreflections delivered without \u201cRegularity and\nOrder\u201d (C 3.8, 3.2), an argumentative inquiry, and a\nwitty essay that eschews \u201cthe Gravity of strict Argument\u201d\nin favor of the \u201cway of Chat\u201d (C 3.97).\n1.3 Features of Shaftesbury interpretation: persuasion, illustrations, unpublished texts\n\nGrean claims that Shaftesbury\u2019s forms are \u201cdetermined by\nthe means of persuasion\u201d more than argumentative rigor, which\nposes a challenge for interpretation (Grean 1967: xviii). Carey says,\n\u201cwe cannot look to his work for an argument structured by\npremises and logical deductions\u201d (Carey 2006: 106). To\ncomplicate matters, Shaftesbury adopts different personae in different\nliterary performances, and there are significant interpretative\nquestions about the extent to which we ought to identify the views of\nShaftesbury\u2019s first-person narrators with Shaftesbury\nhimself\u2014especially when one persona explicitly distinguishes\nhimself from another (C 2.263 and 3.12; see Marshall 1986; Prince\n1996; Chaves 2008). In addition, some commentators take\nShaftesbury\u2019s works to be laced with self-distancing irony\n(Klein 1994: 96\u201399; Jaffro 2008). This diversity of forms,\nstyles, tones, and personae makes it difficult to attribute to\nShaftesbury a single philosophical system of thought. Shaftesbury\nhimself wrote: \u201cThe most ingenious way of becoming foolish, is\nby a System\u201d (C 1.290).\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of Shaftesbury interpretation is his use of\nillustrations. Shaftesbury worked on numerous allegorical\nillustrations for the second edition of Characteristics,\nputting tremendous effort into both the overall plan and the minute\ndetails of these illustrations and engaging in extensive\ncorrespondence with the artists he hired to execute the pictures. He\nseemed to want his audience to read the illustrations as carefully as\nthe words, their meanings (some readily apparent, others subtle to the\npoint of hiddenness) essential to a full understanding of the text.\n(The fullest discussion of the illustrations is Paknadel 1974. Rivers\n2000a and M\u00fcller 2010, 2012, and 2013 also shed light on how the\nillustrations interact with and enhance the message of\nShaftesbury\u2019s text.) Shaftesbury took care, as well, to compose\nthe marginal headings and index to Characteristicks, and his\nchoices in those places can also be cited as evidence for certain\ninterpretative views (see Rivers 2000b). Characteristicks was\none of the earliest books in English to have an index.\n\nYet another issue in Shaftesbury interpretation is the role to give to\nwritings not included in Characteristicks. These include\ncompleted works, unfinished versions of projected publications, and\ncorrespondence. Perhaps most important in this regard are\nShaftesbury\u2019s private notebooks, or Askemata (the\ndefinitive version is the Standard Edition; some of the\nwritings from the notebooks are also collected in Regimen,\nedited by Rand). There is a question, however, of whether\nAskemata and other unpublished writings constitute a more\naccurate picture of Shaftesbury\u2019s real views, or whether at\nleast some of those writings should be taken to have served private\ntherapeutic purposes that differ from the stating of his settled,\nfully considered positions. Shaftesbury has one of his narrators in\nCharacteristicks object to the publication of private\nruminations (C 1.162\u20134), and he himself did not intend for\nAskemata ever to be published.  Moreover, Jaffro has\nargued that Shaftesbury thought that the private self should be\n\u201csecreted\u201d from the public self\u2014that there should be\na \u201cgap\u201d between them (Jaffro 2008: 349)\u2014which only\ncomplicates further the attempt to corral everything Shaftesbury wrote\ninto a systematic, or even fully coherent, single philosophical\nposition.\n1.4 Relationship to Stoicism\n\nA closely related question is how best to understand\nShaftesbury\u2019s relationship to Stoicism. Stoicism was clearly a\nmajor influence on Shaftesbury, but the exact nature of his\nthought\u2019s relationship to Stoicism is a matter of debate. Some\ncommentators argue that Shaftesbury is essentially a Stoic through and\nthrough (Tiffany 1923; see also Sellars 2016 and Stuart-Buttle 2019).\nOthers argue that some of his ideas comport with Stoicism, while\nothers do not (Maurer and Jaffro 2013).\n\nThe strong Stoic interpretation emphasizes the unpublished\nAskemata, which are notebooks in which Shaftesbury engages in\na process of self-improvement based on Stoic principles (see Klein\n1994: 60 and 81\u201388; Rivers 2000a: 92; Taylor 1989: 251\u20132;\nGatti 2014). Shaftesbury refers to and quotes Stoic sources throughout\nAskemata. When he was writing in these notebooks, Shaftesbury\nseems to have Stoic ideas in the forefront of his mind, and proceeds\non the assumption that those ideas are the key to becoming the person\nhe wants to be. As well, Shaftesbury\u2019s unpublished\nPathologia is a Latin text that is entirely devoted to an\nexplication of Stoic psychology. Shaftesbury\u2019s unpublished\nChartae Socraticae can also be read as an endorsement of\nStoicism and a rejection of contemporary philosophy.\n\nThe main idea the strong Stoic interpretation believes Shaftesbury\nemphasizes is an exclusive concern with the state of one\u2019s own\nsoul, which is within one\u2019s own control, and a resultant\nwithdrawing of concern from everything else. This interpretation\nhighlights the many passages in Askemata in which Shaftesbury\nurges himself to focus only on his internal state, to maintain\nequanimity, not to allow anything external to disturb his serenity.\nShaftesbury\u2019s choice of illustration for the frontispiece of\nCharacteristicks echoes this idea: it\u2019s a ship on a bay\nand a ray of light on a still dish of water, which is intended to\nillustrate quotations from Marcus (\u201cWhat view you take is\neverything, and your view is in your power. Remove it when you choose,\nand then, as if you had rounded the cape, come calm serenity, a\nwaveless bay\u201d) and Epictetus (\u201cAs is the water-dish, so is\nthe soul; as is the ray which falls on the water, so are the\nappearances\u201d). (For discussion of this illustration, see\nPaknadel 1974, 297\u20138.)\n\nThere are, however, aspects of Characteristicks that other\ncommentators have thought to be at odds with the strong Stoic\ninterpretation. Maurer and Jaffro (2013) maintain that\nShaftesbury\u2019s concern with the public good and his endorsement\nof pity do not fit with the Stoic view. Klein\u2019s reading (1994)\nemphasizes the importance Shaftesbury places on aesthetic beauty,\npoliteness, and manners, and how those might differ from Stoicism.\nShaftesbury also refrains from publishing his own thought in the\nsystematic form distinctive of much of Stoic thought (compare to\nPathologia).\n\nDefenders of the strong Stoic interpretation suggest that Shaftesbury\nconceals his true beliefs in order to reach an audience that may not\nbe ready for the unadulterated, austere message of Stoicism. According\nto this interpretation, for instance, Shaftesbury\u2019s real view is\nthat aesthetic beauty (the beauty of physical things, such as art) is\nof no value. He only brings aesthetic beauty into his discussion as a\ndecoy or sugar-coating, a ploy to induce a wider audience toward a\nmoral position that would have left them cold if it had been delivered\nunadorned (see Tiffany 1923; Derhmann 2014; Stuart-Buttle 2019).\n\nAn alternative explanation is that Shaftesbury used his unpublished\nnotebooks as a means to work on improving himself with Stoic ideas\nduring psychologically fraught times, but that those notebooks do not\nnecessarily reflect the essence of his true philosophy (see Klein\n1994). The essays he worked hard to polish and publish as\nCharacteristicks might be a better reflection of his\nconsidered views. Another possibility is that he thought different\nthings at different times: the notebooks might accurately reflect a\nStoic orientation at some points in his life, but for all that he\nstill might have held non-Stoic ideas about aesthetics and public\nconcern at other points. In response, the strong Stoic interpretation\nmay contend that even in Characteristicks there are\nindications (esoteric perhaps, but evident to those who know where to\nlook) that seemingly non-Stoic ideas are but a decoy.\n2. Morality\n2.1 Virtue and goodness\n\nShaftesbury maintains that virtue is the promotion of the good of all\nhumankind.\n\n\nTo love the Publick, to study universal Good, and to promote the\nInterest of the whole World, as far as lies within our power, is\nsurely the Height of Goodness. (C 1.37)\n\n\nThe virtuous person strives to develop an \u201cequal, just, and\nuniversal Friendship\u201d with humanity as a whole (C 2.242). This\nview of virtue is a precursor to Hutcheson\u2019s proto-Utilitarian\nview that \u201cthat Action is best, which procures the greatest\nHappiness for the greatest Numbers\u201d (Hutcheson 1726: 125).\nLevy-Eichel also points to Shaftesbury\u2019s coinage of\n\u201cMoral Arithmetic\u201d (C 2.99) as a crucial part of\nthe pre-history of Utilitarianism, and its use of mathematics in moral\nsubjects (Levy-Eichel 2020). (For further discussion of\nShaftesbury\u2019s influence on Utilitarianism, see Driver 2014. For\na view of Shaftesbury\u2019s differences from later Utilitarians, see\nCrisp 2019: 86).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s view of virtue is part of his teleological view of\ngoodness. Something is good, according to Shaftesbury, if it\ncontributes to the \u201cExistence or Well-being\u201d of the system\nof which it is a part (C 2.18). Every animal is a part of its species.\nA particular animal, say a tiger, is a good member of its\nspecies\u2014it\u2019s a good tiger\u2014if it contributes to the\nwell-being of the tiger species as a whole. There is also \u201ca\nsystem of all animals,\u201d which consists of the\n\u201corder\u201d or \u201ceconomy\u201d of all the different\nanimal species (C 2.19). A good animal is one that contributes to the\nwell-being of \u201canimal Affairs\u201d in general (C 2.19). The\nsystem of all animals, moreover, works with the system \u201cof\nVegetables, and all other things in this inferior World\u201d to\nconstitute \u201cone system of a Globe or Earth\u201d (C\n2.19). So something is a good earthly thing if it contributes to the\nexistence of earthly things in general. And the system of this earth\nis itself part of a \u201cUniversal System\u201d or\n\u201ca System of all Things\u201d\n(C 2.20). To be \u201cwholly and really\u201d good\na thing must contribute to the good of the universe as a whole (C\n2.20). This progression of ever-larger systems is a bit dazzling, and\nwe might wonder how we can know (or even make sense of) whether\nsomething is contributing to the well-being of the universe as a\nwhole. But Shaftesbury avoids this problem by discussing in detail\nonly that which makes \u201ca sensible Creature\u201d a good member\nof its species\u2014by focusing on whether an individual creature is\npromoting the well-being of its species (C 2.21). Perhaps Shaftesbury\nbelieves that a creature that contributes to the well-being of its\nspecies will also always contribute to the well-being of the universe\nas a whole, in which case being a good member of one\u2019s species\nwould be coextensive with being \u201cwholly and really\u201d\ngood.\n\nThe goodness or evilness of a sensible creature, according to\nShaftesbury, is based on the creature\u2019s motives, and not simply\non the results of the creature\u2019s actions (C 2.21\u201322). (As\nwe will see, this leads to the crucial claims that every motive to\naction involves affection or passion [C 2.40\u201344], and that\nreason alone cannot motivate [C 2.28\u201352, 77\u201381]).\nShaftesbury strongly emphasizes the importance of motive, arguing that\nif creatures promote the good of the species only because they are\nforced to or only because promoting the good is a means to other ends,\nthen they are not actually good themselves. Creatures are good only if\ntheir motivating affections are directed \u201cprimarily and\nimmediately\u201d at the good of the species, not if the\nconnection between their affection and the good of the species is\naccidental (C 2.26).\n\nGoodness is something that is within the reach of all sensible\ncreatures, not only humans but also non-human animals. A creature is\ngood if its affections promote the well-being of the system of which\nit is a part, and non-human animals are just as capable of possessing\nthis type of affection as humans. \u201cVirtue or Merit,\u201d on\nthe other hand, is within the reach of \u201cMan only\u201d\n(C 2.28). That\u2019s because virtue is tied to a special kind of\naffection that only humans possess. This special kind of affection is\na second-order affection, an affection that has as its object another\naffection. We humans experience these second-order affections because\nwe, unlike non-human animals, are conscious of our own passions. Not\nonly do we possess passions, but we also reflect on or become aware of\nthe passions we have. And when we reflect on our own passions, we\ndevelop feelings about them. Imagine you feel the desire to help a\nperson in distress. In addition to simply feeling that desire, you\nbecome aware that you are feeling that desire. When you become aware\nof that, you experience a positive feeling (or \u201cliking\u201d)\ntowards your desire to help. Or imagine you feel the desire to harm a\nperson who has bested you in a fair competition. In addition to simply\nfeeling the desire to harm, you become aware that you are feeling that\ndesire. When you become aware of that, you experience a negative\nfeeling (or \u201cdislike\u201d) towards your desire to harm. These\nare the kinds of phenomena Shaftesbury has in mind when he writes\nthat\n\n\nthe Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their\nContrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects.\nSo that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind\nof Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been\nalready felt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or\nDislike. (C 2.28)\n\n2.2 The moral sense\n\nShaftesbury calls this capacity to feel second-order affections the\n\u201cSense of Right and Wrong\u201d or the \u201cMoral\nSense\u201d (C 2.28\u201336, 2.40\u201346, 2.51, 2.53, 2.60),\nalthough the term is not one he emphasizes or explains in detail (see\nRivers 2000a: 124). There is little evidence that he thinks the moral\nsense is a distinct psychological faculty in the way that Hutcheson\ndid. Nevertheless, Shaftesbury does think that the moral sense\n(whether one faculty or a less bounded disposition) is that which\nproduces in us feelings of \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d\nfor our own (first-order) affections. When the moral sense is\noperating properly (when it\u2019s fulfilling its teleological\npurpose), it produces positive feelings towards affections that\npromote the well-being of humanity and negative feelings towards\naffections that detract from the well-being of humanity. The\nsecond-order feelings that the moral sense produces can themselves\nmotivate to action, and people are virtuous if they act from those\nsecond-order feelings. In contrast, non-human animals, because they\nlack the powers of reflection necessary for consciousness of their own\naffections, do not possess a moral sense. So non-human animals are\nincapable of achieving virtue (C 2.28\u201331).\n\nShaftesbury argues that because our sense of morality is a sentiment,\nit can be opposed only by another sentiment, and not by reason or\nbelief.\n\n\nSense of Right and Wrong therefore being as natural to us as\nnatural Affection itself, and being a first Principle in our\nConstitution and Make; there is no speculative Opinion, Persuasion or\nBelief, which is capable immediately or directly to\nexclude or destroy it\u2026 And this Affection being an original\none of earliest rise in the Soul or affectionate Part; nothing\nbeside contrary Affection, by frequent check and controul, can operate\nupon it, so as either to diminish it in part, or destroy it in the\nwhole. (C 2.44).\n\n\nShaftesbury does acknowledge that the sense of right and wrong\nrequires the reflective capacity to conceptualize motives. A creature\nwho \u201ccannot reflect on what he himself does\u201d cannot have a\nsense of right and wrong. For this reason, Shaftesbury says that human\nmorality is based on \u201crational Affections\u201d (C\n2.36). But it is still affections that morality is based on.\nShaftesbury writes, \u201cSo that, by means of this reflected Sense,\nthere arises another kind of Affection towards those very Affections\nthemselves, which have been already felt, and are not become the\nSubject of a new Liking or Dislike\u201d (C 2.28). Reflection paves\nthe way for the feeling of moral sentiment. But the\nsentiment\u2014the \u201cLiking or Dislike,\u201d the\n\u201cExercise of the Heart\u201d (C 2.30)\u2014is still\nessential.\n\nShaftesbury puts affection in the driver\u2019s seat because he\nbelieves affection alone can motivate. He never states outright what\nHume would explicitly argue for: that reason on its own is\nmotivationally inert. But the Humean claim is implied by what\nShaftesbury does say. Throughout the first version of the\nInquiry, he attributes every instance of motivation to\naffection. He says that reason is necessary \u201cto secure a right\napplication of the Affections,\u201d but there he is granting to\nreason merely the instrumental role of discovering what will best\nbenefit the species (C 2.35). Affection remains that which motivates\nus to pursue that benefit. Shaftesbury says as well that the\nmotivational force of an affection can be directly opposed only by the\nmotivational force of \u201ccontrary Affections\u201d (C\n2.44). If a person has a motivating affection, she will\n\u201cnecessarily act according to it\u201d unless it is opposed by\nsome other affection (C 2.52). \u201c[T]here is no speculative\nOpinion, Persuasion or Belief, which is capable immediately or\ndirectly to exclude or destroy\u201d a natural affection (C\n2.44). \u201c[N]othing beside contrary Affection, by frequent check\nand control, can operate upon it, so as either to diminish it in part,\nor destroy it in the whole\u201d (C 2.44) Shaftesbury acknowledges\nthat beliefs can cause alterations in the affections, and that the\naltered affections can lead us in directions opposite to those\nwe\u2019d been motivated to follow before. If I come to believe a\nparticularly charismatic person is a great benefactor to humanity, I\nmay then become motivated to emulate behavior of hers to which I would\notherwise have been opposed. If I come to believe that a particular\ngroup of people is trying to destroy humanity, I may become motivated\nto attack them in ways that would previously have offended my sense of\nright and wrong. But belief\u2019s role in motivation is once again\ninstrumental. It operates on my motivation only \u201cindirectly, by\nthe intervention of opposite or of favourable Affections causally\nexcited by any such Belief\u201d (C 2.45). Affection is the source of\nall motivational force. Belief on its own mounts no motivational\npush-back. These ideas are a clear influence on Hutcheson and Hume,\nwho also hold that all motivation is sentimental and that therefore\nmorality is based on sentiment.\n\nOne of the most intensely debated issues in Shaftesbury scholarship\nconcerns the moral sense. The two main views can be called the\nconstitutive interpretation and the representative interpretation.\n\nThe constitutive interpretation holds that morality is constituted by\nthe subjective affective responses of each human. Sidgwick is often\ncited as a proponent of this interpretation. Sidgwick claims that\n\u201cShaftesbury is the first moralist who distinctly takes\npsychological experience as the basis of ethics\u201d (Sidgwick 1902:\n187) and that Shaftesbury thinks morality is based on a \u201csense\n[that] may naturally vary from man to man as the palate does\u201d\n(Sidgwick 1902: 212\u201313). Sidgwick thought that this subjectivist\naspect of Shaftesbury\u2019s view did damage to morality because it\nundermined the reasons that might be given for being moral. Price\nthought something similar, contending that Shaftesbury\u2019s focus\non \u201caffection\u201d led to his \u201coverlooking entirely\n\u2026 the authority belonging to virtue\u201d (Price\n1769: 317). Tuveson is in the same camp, contending that\nShaftesbury\u2019s view differed from prior versions of a moral sense\n(such as Henry More\u2019s) by eliminating the role of reason\naltogether.\n\n\nIt is the feeling, not reason, which is the right moral judge; it is\nthe emotions, according to the Inquiry, which are the right\nmoral guide. (Tuveson 1948: 258)\n\n\nIn saying this, Tuveson claims that Shaftesburean moral judgments are\nbased on an immediate reaction\u2014an inclining to or recoiling\nfrom\u2014and not on a discursively-arrived upon \u201copinion or\nformal judgment\u201d (Tuveson 1960: 53; see Filonowiz 1989: 192).\nTuveson also claims that Shaftesburean moral judgments do not\nrepresent anything in mind-independent reality. According to Tuveson,\nShaftesbury thought that \u201cthat the value area of the mind must\nconstitute a world to itself, outside the process of cognition\u201d\n(Tuveson 1960: 54). Those in the constitutive camp may emphasize\nShaftesbury\u2019s influence on Hutcheson and Hume, whose\nsentimentalism is sometimes taken to eschew commitment to\nmind-independent moral properties.\n\nThe representative interpretation holds, in contrast, that the\naffective responses of Shaftesbury\u2019s moral sense represent moral\nfacts or properties that exist independently of our reactions to them.\nIrwin advances this view when he claims that Shaftesbury \u201ctreats\nthe moral sense as a sign of objective moral properties, not as their\nmetaphysical basis\u201d (Irwin 2008: 369), and that the moral sense\nhas \u201can indicative (or detective) role.\u201d; According to\nIrwin, Shaftesbury believes that moral properties have a\n\u201clogical independence from\u201d our beliefs and judgments\nabout them (Irwin 2015: 866\u20137). Schneewind also believes that\nShaftesbury\u2019s moral sense detects objective moral properties,\ncontending that the moral faculty\n\n\nis special because through it we become aware of an objective\norder\u2026 The approval and disapproval themselves are feelings,\nbut they reveal that the set of passions being considered either is or\nis not harmonious. (Schneewind 1998: 302)\n\n\nRivers develops a similar view, arguing that our moral faculty enables\nus to \u201crecognize and respond\u201d to the objective property of\nharmony (Rivers 2000a: 143; see also 126). Those in the representative\ncamp may emphasize the influence on Shaftesbury of the Cambridge\nPlatonists, whose rationalist moral theories included a clear\ncommitment to the existence of moral properties independent of our\nreactions (Cassirer 1953: 159\u2013202; Gill 2006: 77\u201382).\n\nThe representative and constitutive camps can both cite passages that\npose interpretative challenges to the other side.\n\nIn favor of the representative interpretation and challenging for the\nconstitutive are claims Shaftesbury makes that seem to imply that\nmoral properties are independent of human reactions. He maintains, for\ninstance, that what is destructive of the human species can never\nbe\n\n\nVirtue of any kind, or in any sense; but must remain still\nhorrid Depravity, notwithstanding any Fashion, Law, Custom, or\nReligion; which may be ill and vitious it-self, but can never\nalter the eternal Measures, and immutable independent Nature\nof Worth and Virtue. (C\n2.35\u201336)\n\n\nHe also calls himself a \u201crealist,\u201d and seems to do so in a\nway that precludes a constitutive reading (see Irwin 2015 and Carey\n2006: 98\u201399 and 130\u20134). As one of his characters puts it\nwhen speaking of the author of the Inquiry:\n\n\nFor being, in respect of Virtue, what you\nlately call\u2019d a Realist; he endeavours to shew,\n\u201cThat it is really something in it-self, and in the\nnature of Things: not arbitrary or factitious, (if I may so\nspeak) not constituted from without, or dependent on Custom,\nFancy, or Will; not even on the Supreme\nWill it-self, which can no-way govern it: but being necessarily\ngood, is govern\u2019d by it, and ever uniform with it.\u201d (C\n2.267)\n\n\nShaftesbury says as well that \u201cthe principal End\u201d of\nCharacteristicks is\n\n\n\u201cTo assert the Reality of a Beauty and\nCharm in moral as well as\nnatural Subjects; and to demonstrate the Reasonableness of a\nproportionate Taste, and\ndeterminate Choice, in Life\nand Manners.\u201d The Standard of\nthis kind, and the noted Character of Moral Truth\n[are] firmly establish\u2019d in Nature\nit-self. (C 3.303; see 1.336)\n\n\nThose in the representative camp can also claim support from\nShaftesbury\u2019s comparison of virtue to beauty. Shaftesbury\ncontends that beauty is a mind-independent, objective property (more\non this below). But since aesthetic responses are representative of\nmind-independent reality, and our moral responses are similar or\nperhaps identical to our aesthetic responses, it follows that our\nmoral responses are representative as well (Schneewind 1998:\n303\u20134; Carey 2006: 107, 125, and 132\u20134).\n\nIn favor of the constitutive interpretation and challenging for the\nrepresentative are statements Shaftesbury makes that seem to imply\nthat the basis for virtue is dependent only on human reactions and\nthus insensitive to any mind-independent fact (Taylor 1989:\n256\u20137; Den Uyl 1998: 90; Gill 2000: 538\u201347). He says, for\ninstance, that our reason to be virtuous is impervious even to the\nsupposition that we know nothing of the external world.\n\n\nFor let us carry Scepticism ever so far, let us doubt, if we\ncan, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes\nwithin our-selves. Our Passions and Affections are known to\nus. They are certain, whatever the Objects may be,\non which they are employ\u2019d. Nor is it of any concern to our\nArgument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are Realitys,\nor mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For ill Dreams\nwill be equally disturbing. And a good Dream, if Life be\nnothing else, will be easily and happily pass\u2019d. In this Dream\nof Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our\nBalance and Economy hold good, and our Obligation to\nVirtue is in every respect the same. (C\n2.173)\n\n\nIn a similar vein he writes,\n\n\nIf there be no real Amiableness or Deformity in moral Acts,\nthere is at least an imaginary one of full force. (C\n2.43)\n\n\nCommentators on either side of the representative-constitutive divide\nmay try to show that passages that seem troublesome for their\ninterpretation do not mean what the other side claims. Towards that\nend, commentators may try to soft-pedal one set of Shaftesbury\u2019s\nstatements, perhaps emphasizing the different purposes and different\npersonae in Shaftesbury\u2019s writings, or explicating the fuller\ncontext of various quotations in a way that reveals that Shaftesbury\nis not himself endorsing certain claims but rather arguing that even\non assumptions he does not accept his main points about virtue will\nstill stand. Jaffro has argued that Shaftesbury consciously changed\nhis mind, or at least decided that he should change how to express his\nviews, moving from an early account that had subjectivist implications\nto a later account that was more objectivist (Jaffro 2007). Another\npossible response to this interpretative issue is to hold that\nShaftesbury is simply inconsistent, or that he is unaware of the\nimplications of some of his own claims. As Raphael puts it, \u201cThe\nfact is that no coherent view can be extracted from Shaftesbury about\nthe moral faculty or about moral theory in general\u201d (Raphael\n1947: 17). Kivy writes,\n\n\nIt has been the opinion of many, from Shaftesbury\u2019s time to our\nown, that no coherent view emerges; and I am inclined, in the last\nanalysis, to agree. (Kivy 2003: 16)\n\n\nDarwall (1995) has developed an interpretation of Shaftesbury\u2019s\nmoral sense that does not fit in either the constitutive or the\nrepresentative camp. According to Darwall, Shaftesbury believes that\nthe normative authority of morality leads to the view that the basis\nof morality is within each agent, which conflicts with interpretations\nthat hold that the moral sense represents something external. But\nDarwall also holds that Shaftesbury believes that there is a\nrationally necessary view of morality that each agent should come to,\nwhich conflicts with interpretations that hold that the moral sense\nproduces subjective and contingent emotional experiences. On\nDarwall\u2019s interpretation, Shaftesbury is concerned with autonomy\nand rationality in a way that warrants classifying him as a clear\nprecursor to Kant. Den Uyl has raised concerns about Darwall\u2019s\ninterpretation by contending that the moral sense is the source of\nfavorable attitudes rather than the law-like rules of a proto-Kantian\nrationalist (Den Uyl 1998: 304). Another objection to Darwall\u2019s\ninterpretation can be found in Irwin, who claims that\nShaftesbury\u2019s moral sense view is externalist\u2014i.e., that\none\u2019s moral sense produces responses that have no necessary\nconnection to one\u2019s motivation or reason to act morally (Irwin\n2015: 877 and 880). Darwall\u2019s interpretation, in contrast,\nrequires a strongly internalist reading of Shaftesbury.\n2.3 Motivation, egoism, and hedonism\n\nThroughout his works, Shaftesbury attacks a view of human motivation\nthat he associates with Hobbesian and voluntarism. Some commentators\nhave thought that the view of human motivation Shaftesbury advances in\nthese anti-Hobbesian and anti-voluntarist passages is ardently\nnon-egoistic\u2014i.e., that Shaftesbury believes that human agents\ncan be motivated by considerations other than self-interest (Den Uyl\n1998; Schneewind 1998; Irwin 2008; Carey 2006). Other commentators\nhave argued that Shaftesbury himself holds an egoist view of human\nmotivation\u2014that he thinks every human\u2019s actions are\nmotivated by self-interested desires\u2014and that his attacks on\nHobbes and the voluntarists are directed only at what he takes to be\nan incorrect view of self-interest (Sidgwick 1902; Peach 1958;\nTrianosky 1998; Grote 2010; Crisp 2019, 78). Still other commentators\nhave claimed that Shaftesbury is inconsistent, opposing egoist views\nof human motivation in some passages and assuming them in other\npassages (Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74).\n\nThose who interpret Shaftesbury as an anti-egoist point to passages in\nwhich he argues that theories that rely exclusively on selfish\nmotivation cannot explain plainly observable human behavior. In\nWit and Humour, Shaftesbury attacks those who\n\n\nwou\u2019d new-frame the human Heart; and \u2026 reduce all its\nMotions, Balances and Weights, to that one Principle and Foundation of\na cool and deliberate Selfishness. (C 1.116)\n\n\nIn fact, Shaftesbury argues, careful observation reveals that humans\nare motivated by many non-selfish considerations.\n\n\n[W]hoever looks narrowly into the Affairs of it, will find, that\nPassion, Humour, Caprice, Zeal,\nFaction, and a thousand other Springs, which are counter to\nSelf-Interest, have as considerable a part in the Movements\nof this Machine. There are more Wheels and Counter-Poises in\nthis Engine than are easily imagin\u2019d. \u2019Tis of too complex\na kind, to fall under one simple View, or be explain\u2019d thus\nbriefly in a word or two. The Studiers of this Mechanism must\nhave a very partial Eye, to overlook all other Motions besides\n[selfishness]. (C 1.115)\n\n\nPeople exhibit non-selfish \u201cCivility, Hospitality, Humanity\ntowards Strangers or People in distress\u201d (C 1.118). Their\nconcern for\n\n\nRelations, Friends, Countrymen,\nLaws, Politick Constitutions, the Beauty of\nOrder and Government, and the Interest of Society and\nMankind \u2026 naturally raise a stronger Affection\nthan any which was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere Self.\n(C 1.117)\n\n\nIndeed, even those tendencies that are most destructive are usually\nbased in sociable, non-selfish concerns. War and social disruption are\nusually caused not by selfishness but by a powerful concern for party\nor clan. It is love and fellowship for those in one\u2019s group that\nlead to widespread conflict, not self-love.\n\n\nIn short, the very Spirit of Faction, for the greatest part,\nseems to be no other than the Abuse or Irregularity of that social\nLove, and common Affection, which is natural to Mankind.\nFor the Opposite of Sociableness is Selfishness. And\nof all Characters, the thorow-selfish one is the least forward in\ntaking Party. (C 1.114\u201315)\n\n\nSome have tried to show that all of these seemingly sociable\ntendencies result only from \u201ca more deliberate, or\nbetter-regulated Self-love\u201d (C 1.118). But (according\nto Shaftesbury) such views either fail to explain what people actually\ndo or collapse into tautology (C 2.226\u20137).\n\nAgainst Hobbes himself, Shaftesbury presents a pleasantly ironic\nad hominem argument. If Hobbes had truly been entirely\nconcerned with his own self-interest, he would never have publicly\nadvanced the view that people are motivated entirely by self-interest.\nHe would, rather, have spoken \u201cthe best of human Nature\u201d\nso that he could \u201cthe easier abuse it\u201d (C 1.94). But\nHobbes did not behave in this way. He tried to convince people of the\nselfishness of human beings precisely because he wanted to help humans\nbeings, even though this conduct placed him at great peril. His very\nadvancement of the selfish thesis refutes it. That\n\n\ngood sociable Man, as savage and unsociable as he wou\u2019d make\nhimself and all Mankind appear by his Philosophy, expos\u2019d\nhimself during his Life, and took the utmost pains, that after his\nDeath we might be deliver\u2019d from the occasion of these Terrors.\nHe did his utmost to shew us \u2026 that there was nothing which by\nNature \u2026 drew us to the Love of what was without, or beyond\nour-selves: Tho the Love of such great Truths and sovereign\nMaxims as he imagin\u2019d these to be, made him the most laborious\nof all Men in composing Systems of this kind for our Use; and\nforc\u2019d him, notwithstanding his natural Fear, to run continually\nthe highest risk of being a Martyr for our Deliverance. (C\n1.89\u201390)\n\n\nAccording to Shaftesbury, both Hobbes and the voluntarists believed\nthat the only motive humans have to be moral is that a powerful being\nwill reward them for virtue and punish them for vice. The\nHobbesian\u2019s rewards and punishments are meted out by the\nsovereign, the voluntarist\u2019s by God. Were it not for this\npowerful being\u2019s rewards and punishments, according to\nShaftesbury\u2019s understanding of Hobbesianism and the voluntarism,\nhumans would have no motivating reasons to be moral. In an oft-cited\nletter, Shaftesbury places Locke in the same category as Hobbes and\nthe voluntarists, condemning the lot of them for reducing all moral\nmotivation to these selfish concerns. (For discussion of this letter\nand Shaftesbury\u2019s philosophical relationship to Locke, see Carey\n2006: 98 and 138; Stuart-Buttle 2019: 90-105). Central to much of\nShaftesbury\u2019s account of morality, in contrast, is the claim\nthat people are virtuous only to the extent that they are motivated by\nsomething other than selfish concern to gain reward and avoid\npunishment (C 2.23, 2.25, 2.60, 2.66). According to Shaftesbury,\nvirtue consists not in the actions people perform, but in their\nmotives for performing them. And the motive with which we identify\nvirtue is concern for humanity, not selfishness. Shaftesbury\nemphasizes this point by drawing attention to the difference between\nknaves and saints. In order to be motivated to do the right thing,\nknaves \u201cstand in need of such a rectifying Object as the\nGallows before their eyes,\u201d but someone truly honest will\nnot have such a need.\n\n\nAnd if a Saint had no other Virtue than what\nwas rais\u2019d in him by the same Objects of Reward and Punishment,\nin a more distant State; I know not whose Love or Esteem he might gain\nbesides, but for my own part, I shou\u2019d never think him worthy of\nmine. (C 1.127)\n\n\nWe judge saints to be virtuous because we think they are motivated by\nsomething other than the selfishness of the knave. If we came to\nbelieve that the saints were motivated by self-interest as well (e.g.,\nby desire for reward in the afterlife), we would no longer judge them\nto be virtuous. As Shaftesbury puts it,\n\n\nIf the Love of doing good, be not, of it-self, a good and\nright Inclination; I know not how there can possibly be such\na thing as Goodness or Virtue. (C 1.98)\n\n\nShaftesbury maintains, further, that stressing reward and punishment\nis actually counterproductive to the promotion of virtue. This is\nbecause a stress on reward and punishment tends to crowd out or\nobliterate the intrinsic concern for the good of the species that is\nessential to true virtue. He writes,\n\n\nI Have known a Building, which by the Officiousness of the Workmen has\nbeen so shor\u2019d, and screw\u2019d up, on the\nside where they pretended it had a Leaning, that it has at last been\nturn\u2019d the contrary way, and overthrown. There has something,\nperhaps, of this kind happen\u2019d in Morals. Men have not\nbeen contented to shew the natural Advantages of Honesty and Virtue.\nThey have rather lessen\u2019d these, the better, as they thought, to\nadvance another Foundation. They have made Virtue so\nmercenary a thing, and have talk\u2019d so much of its\nRewards, that one can hardly tell what there is in it, after\nall, which can be worth rewarding. (C 1.97; see also 2.33\u201334 and\n39\u201340)\n\n\nPeople who dwell on reward and punishment are more likely to become\noverly concerned with their own \u201cSelf-good, and private\nInterest,\u201d which must \u201cinsensibly diminish the Affections\ntowards publick Good, or the Interest of Society and introduce a\ncertain Narrowness of spirit\u201d (C 2.58). Stressing reward and\npunishment cannot make people more virtuous, and it may very well make\nthem less so (C 1.97\u201398, 2.52\u201356). It is for this reason\nthat Shaftesbury has one of his characters in The Moralists\nsay that the author of the Inquiry\n\n\nendeavors chiefly to establish Virtue on Principles, by which\nhe is able to argue with those who are not as yet induc\u2019d to own\na God, or Future State. If he cannot\ndo thus much, he reckons he does nothing. (C 2.266\u20137)\n\n\nShaftesbury here seems to anticipate the \u201coverjustification\nhypothesis\u201d of Lepper, Greene, and Nisbitt (1973).\n\nIn his discussions of Hobbes and the voluntarists, then, Shaftesbury\nseems to be attacking the view that humans are motivated only by\nself-interest and, relatedly, that self-interest is the only reason\nfor us to be moral. This anti-egoist reading can also point to\nShaftesbury\u2019s aesthetic views, which center on the idea that our\nlove of beauty is entirely non-selfish (see Stolnitz 1961a and b).\nShaftesbury makes this seemingly anti-egoistic aesthetic point when he\ndistinguishes the entirely non-selfish appreciation of a thing\u2019s\nbeauty from the self-interested desire to own or command that thing\n(2.396\u20137).\n\nOther commentators, however, interpret Shaftesbury as an egoist, and\neven a hedonist egoist, as someone who holds that every human action\nis motivated by the agent\u2019s desires for his or her own pleasure\n(Sidgwick 1902: 185; Peach 1958; Trianosky 1978; Grote 2010; for\ndiscussion of Shaftesbury and hedonist view, see Crisp 2019,\n84\u20135 and 91). A crucial text for the egoist reading is the\nbeginning of Book 2 of the Inquiry, where Shaftesbury\nwrites\n\n\nWe have consider\u2019d what Virtue\nis, and to whom the Character belongs. It remains to inquiry,\nWhat Obligation there is to Virtue;\nor what Reason to embrace it. (C\n2.45)\n\n\nShaftesbury goes on to argue that being moral is in every\nperson\u2019s own best interests\u2014that one will be happier if\none is virtuous rather than vicious. As he sums up his argument in the\nconclusion of the Inquiry,\n\n\nThus have we endeavour\u2019d to prove what was propos\u2019d in the\nbeginning\u2026 To be wicked or vitious, is to be\nmiserable and unhappy\u2026 On the other side; the\nHappiness and Good of Virtue has\nbeen prov\u2019d. (C 2.98\u201399)\n\n\nAnd again:\n\n\n\u201cThat to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral, is a\nBreach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills\u201d: and,\n\u201cThat on the other side, Every thing which is an Improvement\nof Virtue, or an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an\nAdvancement of Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid\nHappiness and Enjoyment.\u201d (C 2.100).\n\n\nThis performance in the Inquiry is the basis for\ninterpretations that claim that Shaftesbury believes that the only\nsalient answer that could be given to the question, Why be moral?, is\nthat being moral is in one\u2019s own self-interest\u2014and, more\ngenerally, that Shaftesbury thinks that self-interest is the only\nultimate reason for action.\n\nHow do egoistic interpretations handle the many texts in which\nShaftesbury attacks selfish theories of morality and human nature?\nSome have come to the exasperated conclusion that Shaftesbury is\nsimply inconsistent, sometimes assuming egoism sometimes opposing it\n(Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74). Others have argued that\nShaftesbury\u2019s criticisms of selfish theories do not conflict\nwith an overall egoistic interpretation. Grote (2010) maintains that\nwhen Shaftesbury attacks Hobbes, the voluntarists, and other\n\u201cselfish\u201d theorists, he is not attacking the view that\nself-interest is the only reason to be virtuous but rather is\nattacking the view that externally-bestowed rewards and\npunishments are the only reasons to be virtuous. According to Grote,\nwhat Shaftesbury means to show is that virtue has decisive\n\u201cnatural advantages\u201d\u2014that being virtuous will make\none happier regardless of what anyone else may do to you.\nShaftesbury\u2019s opponents, on this reading, are those who claim\nthat the relevant self-interested considerations are the rewards and\npunishment meted out by God or sovereign. The crucial contrast is\nbetween, on the one hand, the arbitrariness of the rewards and\npunishments of the voluntarist God and the Hobbesian sovereign and, on\nthe other hand, the naturalness of the internal mental enjoyments that\ncome from being virtuous\u2014not the contrast between\nself-interested and non-self-interested motives.\n\nSuch is how egoistic interpretations attempt to explain away what many\nhave taken to be Shaftesbury\u2019s attacks on egoist explanations of\nhuman behavior. How do anti-egoist interpretations attempt to explain\naway the efforts Shaftesbury makes in Book 2 of the Inquiry\nto show that virtue\u2019s conduciveness to one\u2019s own happiness\nis reason to embrace it? Schneewind denies Shaftesbury ever tries\n\u201cto bribe the reader into becoming virtuous, by showing that it\npays\u201d (Schneewind 1998: 308). According to Schneewind, in Book 2\nof the Inquiry Shaftesbury is\n\n\ntrying to show that the natural world\u2014the realm in which the\nnatural good of happiness exists\u2014is such that it makes sense for\nus to act morally within it. (Schneewind 1998: 308)\n\n\nIrwin argues that virtuous Shaftesburean agents have an immediate\naversion to vice that is based on a kind of aesthetic disgust-reaction\nrather than a reflective calculation about what will benefit them in\nthe long run (Irwin 2008: 357).\n\nIrwin also thinks we can find in Shaftesbury elements of a eudaimonist\ntheory, according to which \u201cit is reasonable to examine the\ncontribution of virtue to happiness\u201d because \u201cthe pursuit\nof happiness [is] the pursuit of rational structure and\nharmony\u201d\u2014which does not collapse into the Hobbesian egoist\nview that we should be virtuous because it maximizes our pleasure\n(Irwin 2008: 357). Den Uyl also locates in Shaftesbury something akin\nto \u201ca classical virtue ethics\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 292). Crisp\nthinks \u201cShaftesbury\u2019s account is Aristotelian,\u201d in\nthat one\u2019s happiness is one\u2019s chief good but the virtuous\nperson \u201crecognizes that their good itself consists in virtuous\nactivity, which will itself involve direct concern for the good of\nothers for their own sake\u201d (Crisp 2019: 79). Filonowicz argues\nthat virtue and happiness are so closely identified in Shaftesbury\nthat it distorts his view to claim that we seek one as a mere means\nfor the other. Shaftesbury is not trying to show\n\n\nthat we are required to be moral by the sheer personal utility of\nbeing so\u2026 [H]is point, rather, [is] that questions of expected\noverall benefit or less will seem moot to anyone who has actually\nachieved, and so experienced, moral health or harmony of affection.\nVirtue is experienced as being its own reward. (Filonowicz 2008:\n86)\n\n\nOn the eudaimonist interpretation of Shaftesbury, virtue benefits its\npossessor, but the person who possesses virtue does not do the right\nthing because she thinks it will make her happy. To possess virtue is\nto be committed to certain values, and it\u2019s those values that\nmotivate the virtuous person, not the self-interested benefits that\nmay result. Indeed, a virtuous person will sacrifice what are\ntypically considered benefits to self in order to live up to those\nvalues. Caring about other people is not merely a means to some\ndistinct pleasurable experience. Caring about other people for their\nown sakes is itself essential to, is constitutive of, the experience\nof living well. Virtue is intrinsically choice-worthy. Annas (2008)\nhas shown the same combination of claims\u2014that virtue consists of\ncaring non-instrumentally about certain kinds of conduct that are\nobjectively proper for human beings, and that the reason to be\nvirtuous is that it will lead to the best life\u2014is present in\nmany eudaimonist views.\n\nIn his Essay on the Passions, Hutcheson addresses the same\nquestion that non-egoist interpretations of Shaftesbury must face in\nlight of Shaftesbury\u2019s arguments for the coincidence of virtue\nand interest\u2014i.e., if virtue is non-self-interested, why show\nthat virtue is in everyone\u2019s self-interest? Hutcheson\nwrites,\n\n\nIt may perhaps seem strange, that when in this Treatise\nVirtue is supposed disinterested; yet so much Pains is taken,\nby a Comparison of our several Pleasures, to prove\nthe Pleasures of Virtue to be the greatest we are capable of,\nand that consequently it is truest Interest to be\nvirtuous. (Hutcheson 1742: viii)\n\n\nHutcheson goes on to maintain that while virtue does consist of truly\nnon-selfish concern for humanity, it is still useful to show that\nvirtue does not conflict with happiness, as that will prevent people\nfrom believing in a conflict between the two ends that would\nconstitute a great obstacle to virtue. It seems possible that\nShaftesbury was anticipating this Hutchesonian thought (a thought that\nHutcheson attributes to Shaftesbury) when arguing in Book 2 of the\nInquiry for the coincidence of virtue and happiness.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Shaftesbury is accurately characterized\nas egoistic, he clearly does contend that virtue conduces to\none\u2019s happiness and vice to one\u2019s misery\u2014that\n\u201cVirtue and Interest may be found at last to\nagree\u201d (C 2.16). And he develops a psychological explanation for\nthis agreement. Central to this explanation is his distinction between\npleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind. Shaftesbury argues\nthat a person\u2019s happiness depends more on mental pleasures than\non bodily pleasures. He then seeks to show that living virtuously is\nby far the best way to gain the crucially important mental pleasures\n(C 2.47\u201373). Shaftesbury bases much of his argument for the\nconnection between virtue and happiness on the idea that the mental\npleasures are within one\u2019s own control, insulated from the\nvicissitudes of \u201cFortune, Age, Circumstances, and Humour\u201d\n(C 2.434). As one of Shaftesbury\u2019s characters rhetorically\nasks,\n\n\nHow can we better praise the goodness of Providence, than in\nthis, \u2018That it has plac\u2019d our Happiness and Good in things\nWe can bestow upon ourselves\u2019? (C 2.435; see\n2.228\u201334)\n\n\nIn arguing for the importance of the mental pleasures, Shaftesbury\nalso develops a view of the difference between higher and lower\npleasures\u2014and of the superiority of the former\u2014that\nclearly anticipates Mill\u2019s use of that distinction in chapter 2\nof Utilitarianism (C 2.228\u201334; see Crisp 2019,\n88\u201391).\n\nOne of the most famous claims in Characteristicks is that\nbeauty and good are one and the same (C 2.399, 415, 422). Many\ncommentators have criticized this claim for being obscure, confused,\nor incoherent (Brown 1751, 162; Martineau 1886, 498; Albee 1916, 183;\nTiffany 1923, 667; Bernstein 1977, 325; Filonowicz 2008, 101\u20132;\nCrisp 2019, 83\u201384). But in the context of The\nMoralists, the claim turns out to be a straightforward statement\nof Shaftesbury\u2019s view that a person will be happiest if she\nmakes moral beauty (i.e., virtue) her highest priority. The claim that\nbeauty and good are one and the same, in other words, is\nShaftesbury\u2019s way of expressing in the The Moralists the\nInquiry\u2019s conclusion that \u201cVirtue is the\nGood, and Vice the Ill of every\u2013one\u201d (C\n2.177). (See Gill 2021. See also Axelsson 2019, 208.)\n\nMuch of the interpretative discussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s response\nto the question, Why be moral?, has focused on Book 2 of the\nInquiry. But Shaftesbury discusses the issue in Wit and\nHumour and Soliloquy as well, asking in the later:\n\u201cWhy shou\u2019d a Man be honest in the dark?\u201d\n(C 1.125). Shaftesbury suggests that a person who asks this question\nis already lost to virtue\u2014that someone who cares about virtue\nfor its own sake won\u2019t need another reason to act virtuously,\nand that someone who needs another reason doesn\u2019t have what it\ntakes to be truly virtuous in the first place. Shaftesbury also\nsuggests that we should be honest even in the dark (i.e., virtuous\neven when we will not be punished for vice) because such conduct is a\nnecessary condition for having an identity or unified self at all (C\n1.283\u20134). The importance of developing a (unified) self is a\nstriking, recurring theme in Shaftesbury\u2019s writings, and he\nsuggests that helping one to develop such a self is the raison\nd\u2019etre of philosophy (see Mijuskovic 1971, Winkler 2000,\nPurviance 2004, and Jaffro 2014; more on this below).\n\nAn additional response Shaftesbury offers to \u201cwhy be\nmoral?\u201d is to equate a commitment to morality to the love of\nbeauty (Brown 1995; Gill 2014). He writes,\n\n\n[A] real Genius, and thorow Artist, in whatever\nkind, can never, without the greatest unwillingness and shame, be\ninduc\u2019d to act below his Character, and for mere Interest be\nprevail\u2019d with to prostitute his Art or Science, by performing\ncontrary to its known Rules\u2026 Be they ever so idle, dissolute,\nor debauch\u2019d; how regardless soever of other Rules; they abhor\nany Transgression in their Art, and wou\u2019d chuse to lose\nCustomers and starve, rather than by a base Compliance with the World,\nto act contrary to what they call the\nJustness and Truth of Work.\n\n\u201cSir\u201d, (says a poor Fellow of this kind, to his rich\nCustomer) \u201cyou are mistaken in coming to me, for such a piece of\nWorkmanship. Let who will make it for you, as you fansy; I know it to\nbe wrong. Whatever I have made hither to, has been true\nWork. And neither for your sake or any body\u2019s else, shall I\nput my hand to any other\u201d.\n\nThis is Virtue! real Virtue, and Love of Truth;\nindependent of Opinion, and above the World.\nThis Disposition transfer\u2019d to the\nwhole of Life, perfects a Character, and makes that\nProbity and Worth which the Learned are often at\nsuch a loss to explain. For is there not a Workmanship and\na Truth in Actions? (C\n1.261\u20132)\n\n\nHere Shaftesbury points out that we readily accept the possibility of\nartists remaining committed to their art, regardless of the external\nrewards that may result from betraying it. We don\u2019t think such\nartists need an answer to the question, \u201cWhy produce excellent\nworks rather than poor ones?\u201d because we understand their\nvaluing the art as an end in itself. But one\u2019s\nlife\u2014one\u2019s character and conduct\u2014can be, or can fail\nto be, morally beautiful. And the commitment people who appreciate\nmoral beauty have to instantiate it can have the same force on their\nconduct as an artist\u2019s commitment to produce excellent works.\nSome might think that connecting morality and beauty in this way\nminimizes or undermines the importance of morality. But given\nShaftesbury\u2019s realist view of beauty\u2014and his equating of\nbeauty and truth\u2014no such thing follows on his account. Just as a\ntrue artist never considers producing bad art, a truly honest person\n\u201cnever deliberates\u201d about whether to be honest. \u201cHe\nacts from his Nature, in a manner necessarily, and without Reflection.\n. . . He can\u2019t deliberate in the Case of a plain Villainy\u201d\n(C 1.81). Shaftesbury is here describing a commitment to virtue that\nseems to be closer to traditional deontological views, in that it has\na non-negotiable, overriding practical authority. Like a traditional\ndeontologist, Shaftesbury thinks the virtuous person will do the right\nthing regardless of any other consequences that may result. Moral\nreasons have a practical authority that is intrinsic to them, not the\nresult of their being commanded or of their being instrumental to any\nother end. But Shaftesbury differs from many traditional deontologists\nin the role he gives to sentiment. Traditional deontologists believe\nthat rationality alone grounds morality\u2019s authority.\nShaftesbury\u2019s non-negotiable commitment to morality, in\ncontrast, is based in the sentiment. Shaftesbury\u2019s picture of an\nimpassioned and dedicated artist models a commitment to doing\nwhat\u2019s right that is based in sentiment but is nonetheless\ncategorical.\n\nAs I mentioned above, some commentators take Shaftesbury to be not\nonly egoistic but also hedonistic, attributing to him the view that\nthe ultimate practical justification is always pleasure for the agent\n(Grote 2010; Martineau 1886, 508; Peach 1958; Trianosky 1978; see also\nCrisp 2019, 84\u20135). Book 2 of the Inquiry seems to provide\nevidence for this reading, as Shaftesbury argues there that the reason\nto be virtuous is that it will make us happiest, and the reasons he\ngives for its making us happiest often involve the virtuous\nlife\u2019s producing greater quantity and quality of pleasure (see C\n2.99\u2013105, 126\u2013130, 147\u2013154, 168\u2013177).\n\nThere are, however, numerous other places in Chararacteristicks\nwhere Shaftesbury explicitly rejects that pleasure is the true or\nultimate measure of choice-worthiness. He ridicules those who\n\u201crate Life by the Number of Exquisiteness of the\npleasing Sensations\u201d (C 1.123). He holds that the truly\nvirtuous person has a non-negotiable commitment to virtue that defies\nhedonistic weighing (C 1.129\u201330, 1.133, 1.261\u20132). He\ndismisses as absurd the proverb \u201cThat Tastes are different,\nand must not be disputed\u201d (C 2.228). He explicitly contends\n\u201cthat Pleasure is no rule of Good,\u201d because we\njudge which pleasures are and are not worth pursuing (C. 1.309; see\nalso 2.249\u201350). I shouldn\u2019t fancy things \u201cas I\nplease\u201d; rather I should \u201clearn to fansy, to\nadmire, to please, as the Subjects themselves are\ndeserving\u201d (C 1.339). My rule of choice should not be\n\u201cbecause I please\u201d (C 1.339). I should ask,\n\u201cis this Pleasure right?\u201d (C 1.340). The question\nis not whether something pleases, but \u201cwhether we are\nrightly pleas\u2019d\u201d (C 2.227). Only some pleasures are\nreally good, not all of them (C 2.229\u201330). We should define the\nchoice-worthiness of pleasures by whether they are good; we\nshouldn\u2019t define goodness by pleasure. The only sense in which\nit\u2019s true that pleasure is what we always seek is the empty\ntautological sense according to which pleasure is just defined as that\nwhich \u201cwe think eligible\u201d (C 2.227; see also\n2.233\u201334).\n\nHow does Shaftesbury\u2019s rejection of pleasure as the measure of\nchoice-worthiness square with his seeming reliance in Book 2 of the\nInquiry on virtue\u2019s superiority at producing pleasure?\nPerhaps the eudaimonist reading explained above accounts for the\ncombination of his claims that the virtuous person acts for\nnon-self-interested reasons and that the virtuous person has a more\npleasurable life than the vicious. Alternatively, the hedonistic\ninterpretation might read the criticisms of pleasure as actually\ncriticisms only of physical pleasures, not of mental pleasures.\nAnother possibility is that Shaftesbury changed his mind. In the\nInquiry, which he wrote early in his career, he emphasized\npleasure. In The Moralists, Common Sense, and\nSoliloquy, which he wrote later, he de-emphasized pleasure,\nindicating a move away from an early hedonistic view.\n3. Self, identity, and liberty\n\nShaftesbury discusses self and identity throughout\nCharacteristicks. There are different views of how those\ndiscussions relate to traditional philosophical questions about\npersonal identity.\n\nIn The Moralists, Shaftesbury contends that there is no\nphysical or mental element that persists through a person\u2019s\nentire life, yet it seems that one can remain the same self even amid\nall those changes. A person is a single thing, retaining an identity\nthroughout the years. But that identity cannot consist of physical\nmatter, as every particle of a person changes over time. The\n\u2018Stuff \u2026 of which we are compos\u2019d\u2019, says\nTheocles, \u2018wears out in seven, or, at the longest, in twice\nseven Years, [as] the meanest Anatomist can tell us. Now where, I\nbeseech you, will that same One be found at last, supposing it\nto lie in the Stuff it-self, or any part of it? For when that\nis wholly spent, and not one Particle of it left, we are Our-selves\nstill as much as before\u2019 (C 2.350). Nor can a person\u2019s\nidentity be based on any idea or emotion, as all of a person\u2019s\nideas and emotions change as well. There\u2019s no single mental item\nthat has the constant existence that would be needed to fund a\nperson\u2019s identity. So since a person remains \u201cone and\nthe same, when neither one Atom of Body, one\nPassion, nor one Thought remains the same,\u201d his\nidentity must be based on \u201ca Sympathy of Parts\u201d (C 2.351).\nHis identity must consist of an overall organization, of a\n\u201csimple Principle: of which all the person\u2019s different\naspects partake (C 2.352).\n\nHume was dismissive of Shaftesbury\u2019s claims in The Moralists\nabout the identity, writing \u201dIf the reader is desirous to\nsee how a great genius may be influenc\u2019d by these seemingly\ntrivial principles of the imagination ... let him read my Lord\nShaftesbury\u2019s reasonings concerning the uniting principle\nof the universe, and the identity of plants and animals [in] his\nMoralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody: (Hume 1739\u201340:\n1.4.6.6). It seems, however, that Hume did learn something about\npersonal identity from The Moralists. For Hume\u2019s own\nview, like Shaftesbury\u2019s, relies on the idea that there is no\nsingle \u201cconstant and invariable\u201d mental item that can fund\npersonal identity: compare Hume\u2019s Treatise 1.4.6.2 and C\n2.350\u201351. Of course Hume and Shaftesbury draw opposite\nconclusions, with Shaftesbury moving from the premise that there is no\nconstant and invariable physical or mental item to the conclusion that\npersonal identity must consist of something other than a physical or\nmental item, and Hume moving to the conclusion that there is no\npersonal identity.\n\nThiel attributes to Shaftesbury the metaphysical position that the\nself, that which constitutes the identity of a person, is a simple\nimmaterial substance (Thiel 2011: 241\u20132). Jaffro distinguishes\n\u201cbetween a normative sense of \u2018being oneself\u2019 or\n\u2018remaining the same person\u2019, and the metaphysical sense,\nthat is, personal identity,\u201d and argues that Shaftesbury is more\nconcerned with the former (Jaffro 2014: 158). Winkler (2000) and\nPurviance (2004) pursue a similar line, arguing that Shaftesbury does\nnot intend to provide an answer to the metaphysical question of\npersonal identity. Shaftesbury\u2019s interest in selves and\nidentity, on this view, is practical rather than metaphysical. His\nconcern is to explain a sense of self and identify that is a moral\nachievement\u2014namely, the achievement of internal harmony of all\none\u2019s psychological principles, both at one moment and through\ntime. On these readings, the important point is that achieving this\nsynchronic and diachronic internal harmony ought to be a\nperson\u2019s fundamental goal, and Shaftesbury intends to give his\nreaders guidance on how to achieve it.\n\nJaffro (2014) and Boeker (2018) elaborate on the practical aspect of\nShaftesbury\u2019s view. Jaffro and Boeker both emphasize the\nimportance of self-control, where that involves the higher, reasonable\naspect of one\u2019s self determining one\u2019s actions rather than\nthe lower, appetites and passions (see also Crisp 2019: 88). Jaffro\ncontends that Shaftesbury has a three-stage position on the\nself-control a persistent practical self requires. The first stage is\na na\u00efve belief that one can simply decide to act from her higher\nprinciples and succeed at it. The second stage is an avoidance\nstrategy, which involves changing circumstances so that the lower\nappetites and passions cannot find room to play as large a role in\none\u2019s actions. The third stage is Stoic self-transformation,\nwhich involves changing one\u2019s soul so that appetites and\npassions no longer pull in a different direction from the higher\nparts. Jaffro suggests that Shaftesbury believes that the third stage\nof self-transformation is accessible only to the supremely\nintellectual few, and that most people can only aspire to the second\nstage of avoidance (see also Stuart-Buttle 2019: 102). Boeker argues,\nin contrast, that Shaftesbury believes that all humans can engage in a\njourney toward the third stage, and that Characteristicks is\nintended to exhort them along on that journey.\n\nClosely related to Shaftesbury\u2019s positions on identity and self\nare his views of personal liberty. There is dispute about whether\nShaftesbury advances a position on the philosophical question of free\nwill and determinism. His view of the laws of nature seem to suggest\nthat he believes in a determinist universe, but Grean (1967) suggests\nthat when he discusses evil he might be allowing a Pelagian exception\nfor free will. According to Grean, Shaftesbury \u201cargues that\nprovidence has granted us the power to know and obtain what is good,\nand to know and avoid what it is evil. It is up to us to make use of\nthese powers, to be men in the true sense\u2014autonomous\nagents of Deity itself\u201d (Grean 1967: 90; see also Axelsson 2019:\n189). Woldt believes, in contrast, that Shaftesbury holds a\ncompatibilist conception of free will (2014: 143\u20135). Boeker\n(2018) argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s texts do not include enough\nsubstances on the issue to attribute to him one position or another.\n(See also Crisp 2019: 78.)\n\nBoeker (2019) maintains that what Shaftesbury is interested in is\npositive freedom, or self-mastery. On this view, a person is free when\nshe acts from her highest and most reasonable principles, rather than\nher lower appetites and passions. Many parts of\nCharacteristicks do seem to involve this idea of a\nperson\u2019s comprising two competing parts. These includes the\nstory of Hercules choosing virtue over pleasure (C 3.347\u2013392),\nthe story of two brothers battling for a football (C 1.187), the\nself-dialogue of Soliloquy (C, 1.156-59), and the story of a\nnobleman who faces loss of control to sexual desire (C\n1.176\u201388). All these stories make the point that to be free is\nfor one\u2019s higher part to win out over one\u2019s lower part\n(see also Crisp 2019, 75\u201376).\n4. Aesthetics\n4.1 Beauty\n\nBeauty is at the center of Shaftesbury\u2019s aesthetics. Shaftesbury\ndiscusses the beauty of literature, music, and painting. He takes the\nprimary instances of physical beauty to be features of the natural\nworld. Shaftesbury\u2019s characters in The Moralists dismiss\nthe beauty of gardens, arguing for the superiority of naturalness or\nwildness over the artifice and \u201cformal Mockery of princely\nGardens\u201d (C 2.393\u20134). But Shaftesbury himself was a great\nlover of gardens, and the gardens he himself planned were more formal\nthan they were wild or natural. For fascinating discussions of\nShaftesbury\u2019s views of gardening and their influences, see\nLeatherbarrow (1984), Liu (2008), Fleming (2014), and Myers (2010 and\n2017).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s conception of beauty has metaphysical and\nepistemological components. Metaphysically, beauty consists of\n\u201cUnity of Design\u201d (C 3.349). Anything that has\nmultiple parts that can be in unity with each other can be beautiful.\nAn artwork can be beautiful, a machine can be beautiful, a natural\nobject can be beautiful, nature as a whole can be beautiful, a human\ncharacter can be beautiful. Shaftesbury uses various words to describe\nthis property: \u201charmony,\u201d \u201cproportion,\u201d\n\u201cregularity,\u201d \u201corder,\u201d \u201cbalance,\u201d\n\u201csymmetry.\u201d His idea that this is what beauty consists of\nseems deeply indebted to Aristotelian and Stoic conceptions of the\nfine and the beautiful.\n\nEpistemologically, we discern beauty through experience of a positive\naffection. We experience a positive \u201cinternal Sensation\u201d\nwhen we hear musical harmonies, when we observe a proportionate\nbuilding, when we appreciate the balance of nature, when we witness\nfully integrated characters (C 2.285). \u201cNor can [one\u2019s\nmind] with-hold its Admiration and Extasy, its\nAversion and Scorn, any more in what relates to one than\nto the other of these Subjects\u201d (C 2.29). We have a\n\u201ctaste\u201d for unified wholes. We have a \u201cliking\u201d\nfor harmony and a \u201cdislike\u201d of its contrary. We have an\nemotional sensibility that\u2019s tuned to standards of order,\nregularity, and balance.\n\nA question for Shaftesbury is whether his metaphysical view of the\nproperty of beauty is conceptually prior to his epistemological view\nof our discernment of beauty, or vice versa. We might, in other words,\nask him: in a world in which we were built to like disharmonious\nthings, would we all be wrong about what is beautiful (metaphysics\nprior), or would disharmonious thing be in fact beautiful\n(epistemology prior)? Shaftesbury\u2019s texts may not provide a\nperfectly clear answer to this question, but there is certainly\nevidence that he would want to say that the metaphysics is prior. For\nhe wanted to be a \u201cRealist in Morality,\u201d where\nrealism involves \u201cimmutable\u201d and \u201ceternal\nMeasures\u201d of morality that are independent of any mind (C\n2.267; 2.36). Such mind-independent moral measures are necessary for\nShaftesbury\u2019s refutation of what he takes to be the pernicious\nsubjectivism of Hobbes and the despicable voluntarism of the\nCalvinists. And he explicitly equates the metaphysical status of moral\nbeauty with the beauty of objects. Here\u2019s a passage in which he\nmakes an emphatic statement that seems to affirm the mind-independence\nof beauty in general and of moral beauty in particular.\n\nHarmony is Harmony by Nature, let Men judg ever so ridiculously\nof Musick. So is Symmetry and Proportion founded still\nin Nature, let Mens Fancy prove ever so barbarous, or their\nFashions ever so Gothick in their Architecture, Sculpture, or\nwhatever other designing Art. \u2019Tis the same case, where\nLife and Manners are concern\u2019d. Virtue has the\nsame fix\u2019d Standard. The same Numbers, Harmony,\nand Proportion will have place in Morals; and are discoverable\nin the Charactersand Affections of Mankind; in which are\nlaid the just Foundations of an Art and Science, superior to every\nother of human Practice and Comprehension. (C 1.353)\n\nThe standards of beauty have an existence that is independent of human\nresponses, distinct from any \u201chuman Practice and\nComprehension.\u201d Even if we responded totally differently than we\nactually do, the same sounds would be beautifully harmonious, the same\nstructures would be beautifully symmetrical, and the same characters\nwould be beautifully integrated.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with this affirmation of the\nmind-independence of beauty. Shaftesbury relies on the idea that\nharmony will be harmony and symmetry will be symmetry regardless of\nhow humans respond to advance the idea that virtue will be virtue\nregardless of how humans respond. But this line of thought seems to\ninvolve an illicit slide between non-normative and normative\nunderstandings of the key terms. It may be reasonable to grant that\nthere are non-normative properties of harmony and symmetry that have a\nmind-independent existence\u2014that some sounds would be harmonious\nand some objects would be symmetrical regardless of whether there were\nany human minds, or how human minds responded to them. But to say\nthose sounds and objects are beautiful is to invoke a normative\ncomponent. It\u2019s to imply that the harmonious and the symmetrical\nare more valuable, are in some sense better than the dissonant\nand the lopsided. And Shaftesbury has given us no reason to accept\nthat harmony and symmetry would continue to be normatively superior\neven if human minds were constructed to respond negatively to them and\npositively to dissonance and lopsidedness. Shaftesbury might have\ngiven us reason to believe there would be a non-normative difference\nbetween unified and disunified objects regardless of how anyone\nresponds to them. But that\u2019s not what he needs to establish the\nmind-independence of beauty as something normative. What he needs is\nto show that unity would be more valuable, would be better than\ndisunity, even if our sensibility was constructed to respond\npositively to the disunified. The comparison with the non-normative\nproperties of harmony and symmetry doesn\u2019t help with that.\n4.2 Aesthetic experience\n\nAesthetic responses, for Shaftesbury, involve some kind of affective\nreaction, but there is interpretative disagreement about the extent to\nwhich that affective reaction is immediate or reflective. In some\npassages, Shaftesbury seems to suggest that our sense of beauty\noperates immediately, like our sensations of color.\n\n\nNo sooner the Eye opens upon Figures, the Ear to\nSounds, than straight the Beautiful results, and\nGrace and Harmony are known and acknowledg\u2019d.\n(C 2.414)\n\nThe Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of [Bodys, or\nthe common Subjects of Sense] being presented to our Eye;\nthere necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to the\ndifferent Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts.\n(C 2.28\u20139; see also 2.285)\n\n\nStolnitz takes these passages to show that for Shaftesbury\n\u201cAesthetic response is \u2018immediate,\u2019 in the sense\nthat it takes place without discursive reflection\u201d (Stolnitz\n1961b: 198; see also 1961a: 112). In other passages, however,\nShaftesbury emphasizes the need for extensive cultivation and\nreflection in order to pass accurate aesthetic judgment (see Glauser\n2002: 45).\n\n\nTaste or Judgment \u2026 can hardly\ncome ready form\u2019d with us into the World\u2026 Use, Practice\nand Culture must precede the Understanding and Wit\nof such an advanc\u2019d Size and Growth as this. A legitimate and\njust Taste can neither be begotten, made,\nconceiv\u2019d, or produc\u2019d, without the antecedent\nLabour and Pains of Criticism.\n(C 3.164)\n\n\nShaftesbury goes on to offer an extensive defense of critics,\nmaintaining that the kind of discursive attention they give to art is\nnecessary for artistic improvement and full appreciation (C\n3.165\u20139). Such passages have led other commentators to conclude\nthat correct aesthetic taste for Shaftesbury requires well-cultivated\nreflective, discursive abilities (Rivers 2000a: 126\u20139; Darwall\n1995: 186; Townsend 1982: 210\u201312).\n\nShaftesbury clearly distinguishes between a person\u2019s\nappreciating the beauty of an object and a person\u2019s appreciating\nthe benefits an object can produce for him or herself. He writes, for\ninstance, of the obvious difference between the enjoyment of the\nbeauty of an ocean or landscape, on the one hand, and the desire to\ncommand these things and gain advantage from them, on the other (C\n2.396\u20137). He also contends that the pleasure we experience when\ncoming to appreciate beauty is\n\n\nof a kind which relates not in the least to any private\nInterest\u2026, nor has for its Object any Self-good or Advantage of\nthe private System. The Admiration, Joy, or Love, turns wholly upon\nwhat is exterior, and foreign to our-selves. (C 2.104)\n\n\nA person who is truly responding to beauty does not consider the\ndesirable consequences that may be associated with a beautiful object\nbut rather responds favorably to the object \u201cfor its own\nsake\u201d (C 2.59), based purely on \u201cthe Excellence of the\nObject\u201d (C 2.273). Such a person\u2019s response is not\nsensitive to external circumstances but results merely from\n\u201cseeing and admiring\u201d (C 2.43).\n\nOn the basis of these passages, Stolnitz argues that Shaftesbury lays\nthe groundwork for the idea that aesthetic responses are essentially\n\u201cdisinterested\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a and b; see also Glauser\n2002 and Savile 2002.) Shaftesbury, according to Stolnitz, was the\nfirst to develop this concept, which \u201cis nowhere to be found in\nclassical and medieval aesthetics. It is Shaftesbury who claims the\ndistinction of being the first thinker to bring the phenomenon of\ndisinterestedness to light and analyzing it\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a:\n100). Appreciation of beauty, on this view, has nothing to do with\nthoughts about any instrumental purpose a work of art may serve, not\nto do with the promotion of ends of any kind. Someone might value an\nartwork because it will improve morals, or make money, or teach\nhistory, or inspire religious adoration. But its aesthetic value is\nutterly distinct from any of those. \u201cAesthetic perception looks\nto no consequences ulterior to itself\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a: 108).\nAccording to this idea, which Stolnitz takes to be the defining\nfeature of modern aesthetic theory, an aesthetic response is a\nresponse solely to the intrinsic features of an object, independent of\nany other type of consideration, such as the object\u2019s utility to\nthe perceiver or to society, its moral value, or its capacity to\nincrease knowledge. Aesthetics, on this view, is autonomous,\nself-contained, impersonal, non-instrumental. Stolnitz is careful (in\na way that some of his critics have failed to note) not to claim that\nShaftesbury himself held exactly this aesthetic view. What Stolnitz\nclaims, rather, is that Shaftesbury\u2019s distinguishing of\nperceptions of beauty and judgments of self-interest was a crucial\ninfluence on the disinterested aesthetic views that would come later,\neven if Shaftesbury himself also held views that did not fit with\nthose later views (Stolnitz 1961a: 100 and 108).\n\nNumerous commentators have argued against the view that Shaftesbury\nadvances the notion of aesthetic disinterestedness (see Townsend 1982;\nRind 2002; Mortensen 1995; Arregui and Arnan 1994; White 1973;\nAxelsson 2019: 180\u20134). In contrast, they take Shaftesbury to\nhold that the value of aesthetic beauty is entirely instrumental. On\nthis anti-Stolnitzian view, Shaftesbury intends to contrast an\nappreciation of an object\u2019s beauty only with certain vicious or\nselfish concerns, not with all non-aesthetic considerations\nwhatsoever. An appreciation of beauty, on this reading of Shaftesbury,\nis \u201cnot to be identified with luxury, covetousness, avarice,\nostentation, and similar \u2026 immoral qualities\u201d (Mortensen\n1994: 637; see also Rind 2002: 72\u20133). But an appreciation of\nbeauty can and should involve consideration of virtue and the\nimprovement of moral character. Townsend says that Shaftesbury does\nnot ever truly give \u201cdisinterestedness a special significance.\nIt is not really proposed as any kind of test, nor does it\ncharacterize a special class of perceptions or judgments. It is much\nmore important to Shaftesbury to determine what our true interests\nare\u201d (Townsend 1982: 211). The editors of the Standard\nEdition write in their preface to the volume on\nShaftesbury\u2019s aesthetics, \u201cfor Shaftesbury the enjoyment\nof art was never to be an end in itself, but had always to serve a\nmoral purpose (Second Characters: 18). Derhmann says that\nShaftesbury believed that \u201dArt is merely the means to a further\nend,\u201c where that end is moral improvement\u201d (2014: 48). In\nexplicit attack on Stolnitz, Mortensen writes, \u201cOn the contrary,\nShaftesbury\u2019s aim was to situate the contemplation of art\nwithin a morality acceptable to his contemporaries\u201d (1994:\n631). According to Mortensen, Shaftesbury\u2019s goal was to give a\n\u201cmoral defense of the appreciation of art,\u201d according to\nwhich art appreciation is justified by its capacity to improve moral\ncharacter.\n\nStolnitz paints Shaftesbury as facing forward, toward the modern view\nof art for art\u2019s sake.\u201c[T]he work of art must be evaluated\nin respect of its intrinsic structure and significance, not as a moral\nvehicle\u201d; when we are in the aesthetic realm, \u201cthe ethical\nquestion withdraws\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a: 99 and 107). According to\nthese other commentators, Shaftesbury affirms the intrinsic value of\nvirtue; art has only the instrumental value of promoting virtue. They\npaint Shaftesbury as looking backward, to Stoicism. (See Tiffany 1923;\nDehrmann 2014; for discussion, see Axelsson 2019.\n\nShaftesbury contends that all appreciation of beauty is appreciation\nof mind. When we respond positively to beautiful objects, what we are\nreally responding to is the mind that designed them, not the physical\nstuff itself. \u201c[T]here is no Principle of Beauty in\nBody,\u201d he says. \u201c[T]he Beautifying, not the\nBeautify\u2019d, is the really Beautiful\u201d (C\n2.404\u20135; see also 2.426). Shaftesbury also places all beauty in\na three-part hierarchy. The lowest order of beauty belongs to\n\u201cthe dead Forms\u201d\u2014physical things such as\nmanmade works of art and natural objects (C 2.406). The second order\nof beauty belongs to human minds, or \u201cthe Forms which\nform, that is, which have intelligence, action, and\noperation\u201d (C 2.406). The third order of beauty belongs to that\n\u201cwhich forms not only such as we call mere Forms, but even\nthe Forms which form\u201d (C 2.408). This highest, most supreme\nand sovereign beauty, belongs to God, who has created everything in\nthe world, including human minds (see Kivy 2003: 12, Den Uyl 1998:\n294). With his hierarchy, Shaftesbury expresses the idea that the\nbeauty of human minds is superior to the beauty of physical objects,\nand that the beauty of God\u2019s mind is superior to the beauty of\nhuman minds, although his reasons underlying this idea are not\nperfectly clear.\n\nAdherents of the instrumentalist interpretation take\nShaftesbury\u2019s points about beauty of mind and the hierarchy as\nevidence that Shaftesbury thinks physical objects are not really\nbeautiful at all, and that we should aspire to care only about the\nbeauty of minds (see especially Tiffany 1923). On this view, the\nbeauty of objects (including all art) is merely an early stage of\nappreciation of beauty that the wise person eventually leaves behind.\nAgainst this interpretation, however, Glauser argues that\nShaftesbury\u2019s notion of beauty-as-unity implies that material\nthings can truly be beautiful, even if Shaftesbury\u2019s characters\nsometimes seem to suggest otherwise. According to Glauser\u2019s\ninterpretation of Shaftesbury, because a material thing really can\npossess a unified form, a material thing really can have the property\nof beauty. It may be a less significant kind of beauty than the beauty\nof a mind, but it can be beauty nonetheless. Because works of art\n\u201care temporarily beautified by their respective principles, they\ndo have beauty, although in some lesser measure\u201d (Glauser 2002:\n30). Glauser thinks that in the passages that seem to assert that\nmaterial things cannot possess beauty the character of Theocles has\nbeen \u201ccarried away by his own rhetoric.\u201d Other times,\nShaftesbury rightly affirms that physical things can be beautiful,\nsuch as when he has Theocles say that that \u201cwhich is\nbeautify\u2019d, is beautiful only by the accession of something\nbeautifying\u201d (C 2.404) and that what we admire is \u201cMind,\nor the Effect of Mind\u201d (C 2.405).\n\nWhatever the best interpretation may be of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of\naesthetic responses, Mortensen (1994) does marshal plentiful evidence\nthat one of Shaftesbury\u2019s chief goals was to advance a concept\nof good \u201ctaste\u201d that would improve the moral character of\nBritish gentlemen. Klein (1994) expands on this idea, showing how\nShaftesbury sought to develop the concepts of taste, manners, and\npoliteness in such a way as to provide a moral foundation for British\nlife that would supplant the outdated and unsatisfactory institutional\nsupports of church and court. Den Uyl (1998) also explicates\nShaftesbury view of the moralizing effects of the perception of\nbeauty, pointing to Shaftesbury\u2019s claims that\n\n\nto be a Virtuoso \u2026 is a higher step towards the\nbecoming a Man of Virtue and good Sense, than the being what in his\nAge we call a Scholar (C 1.333)\n\n\nand\n\n\nThus are the Arts and Virtues mutually Friends; and\nthus the Science of Virtuoso\u2019s and that of\nVirtue it-self, become, in a manner, one and the same. (C\n1.338)\n\n5. Politics\n5.1 How political is Characteristicks?\n\nIn recent years, a number of commentators have highlighted\nShaftesbury\u2019s political commitments and their role in his\nphilosophy. Klein (1994) was one of the earliest and most developed\nattempts to chart the political in Shaftesbury\u2019s thought. Jaffro\n(2018), M\u00fcller (2018), Jost (2018), and Axelsson (2019,\n223\u201338) have made similar points (see also Williams 2005, 234).\nShaftesbury was, of course, the grandson of the first Earl of\nShaftesbury, and the family was strongly associated with the Whig\nParty. Shaftesbury himself (when he was Lord Ashley) was a Whig member\nof the House of Commons from 1695\u20131698. After his father\u2019s\ndeath in 1699 he assumed the Earldom and entered the House of Lords,\nwhile continuing to play a role in Whig electoral efforts of 1701\n(and, to a lesser extent, of 1705).\n\nKlein argues that Characteristicks was largely motivated by\nShaftesbury\u2019s anti-Tory politics. Klein highlights\nShaftesbury\u2019s endorsement of the 1688 revolution, of religious\ntoleration, of a balance of power between Parliament and monarch,\nand\u2014most centrally\u2014of extensive liberty. Klein says that\nShaftesbury\u2019s goal \u201cwas a program of education in which\nthe moral and literary would be combined to produce virtuous public\naction. Shaftesbury was designing a Whiggism that was civic and\nhumanist.\u201d Klein argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s discussion of\n\u201cimposture\u201d in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm was\nan attack on Tory religious views. Klein also cites a 1710 letter in\nwhich Shaftesbury says that in the third volume of\nCharacteristicks he intended \u201cto attack and provoke a\nmost malignant party,\u201d and goes on to express the hope that his\nwork will destroy that party\u2019s hold on English academics,\nreligion, and culture (Regimen 432).\n\nJaffro (2018) argues that Shaftesbury takes \u201cbalance\u201d to\nbe the ideal of both a political constitution and a human\u2019s\npsychological make-up. And Jaffro argues the value Shaftesbury places\non balance is an implicit commitment to Harrington\u2019s political\nprogram in The Commonwealth of Oceana.\n\nJost (2018) and M\u00fcller (2018) both find esoteric political\nmessages in Shaftesbury\u2019s work. According to Jost,\nShaftesbury\u2019s exhortation to of divide oneself into two for\nself-reflection is an implicit endorsement of the Whig party over the\nTories. M\u00fcller argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s attack on religion\nbased on selfish reward in the afterlife is an implicit attack on Tory\ntyranny.\n\nQuestions have been raised about how political in general and partisan\nin particular Shaftesbury\u2019s Characteristicks is (Gill\n2020). Shaftesbury seems at times to be repudiating partisanship,\narguing for an identification with all people that rises above\npolitical squabbles. Many of his central positions on beauty and\nmorality may not involve any clear political commitments. And while in\nsome letters Shaftesbury vociferously attacks Tories, in others he\nclaims that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as powerfully aligned\nwith any political party (Regimen 366\u201367).\n5.2 Liberty and ridicule\n\nAn overriding feature of Shaftesbury\u2019s political thinking is the\nimportance of \u201cLiberty in general\u201d\n(C 3.314). In a letter, he said that \u201cthe Triumph of\nLiberty\u201d is \u201cthe hinge and Bottom of all three [volumes of\nCharacteristicks] and of the whole Work it self\u201d (see\nKlein 1994: 124). He opposes absolutism and tyranny in all forms,\narguing vociferously for free public discourse and toleration of\ndifferent religious practices. He tries to show that control by church\nand court is not necessary\u2014is in fact counterproductive\u2014to\nthe virtue, sociability, and politeness of citizens (see Klein 1994:\n124\u2013135 and 195\u20137; Den Uyl 1998: 310; Carey 2006: 126). On\nKlein and M\u00fcller\u2019s readings (discussed above), proper\nattention to Shaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty and to the\nweakening of the control of church and court reveals that\nCharacteristicks is fundamentally a pro-Whig, anti-Tory tract\n(Klein 1994: 125; M\u00fcller 2013 and 2014a).\n\nDen Uyl argues that Shaftesbury does not think the state can or should\nactively promote virtue (Den Uyl 1998: 310\u2013315). Schneewind\nmakes a similar point when he writes, \u201cThe virtuous agent is not\ncreated by the political structure he inhabits. He brings his\ncharacter to it\u201d (Schneewind 1998: 309; see also 295\u20138,\n307\u20139). The best political course, consequently, is for the\nstate to allow as much liberty as possible, because that is most\nlikely to give individuals their own opportunity to fashion morally\nbeautiful characters. Political liberty creates the conditions for\nvirtue, even if politics cannot promote virtue itself. (For possibly\ncountervailing evidence see C 2.36\u20137, where Shaftesbury might be\nsuggesting that proper civic laws can promote virtue).\n\nM\u00fcller argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty is\ngrounded in his fundamental moral position that virtue consists not\nmerely of performing certain actions but of acting from the right\nmotives (M\u00fcller 2012 and 2013; see C 2.12\u201315, 32, 38). A\nperson who benefits others only because she thinks she will be\nrewarded if she does so, and will be punished if she does not, does\nnot possess virtue. Her beneficence is virtuous only if it is\nmotivated by concern for others, not by selfish considerations\nexternal to others\u2019 welfare. Thus, even if the authorities of\nchurch and court can institute rewards and punishments that may induce\ncertain kinds of behavior, they will have done nothing to promote\nvirtue.\n\nShaftesbury believes that a free exchange of ideas will produce the\nsame benefits for the intellectual world that a\n\u201cFree-Port\u201d produces for commerce, and he\nmaintains that\n\n\nWit will mend upon our hands and Humour will refine\nit-self; if we take care not to tamper with it, and bring it under\nConstraint. (C 1.64)\n\n\nShaftesbury contends as well that the more liberty there is in a\nsociety, the greater its advancements will be in politeness,\nunderstanding, and the arts. \u201cAll Politeness is owing to\nLiberty,\u201d he writes.\n\n\nWe polish one another, and rub off our Corners and rough Sides by a\nsort of amicable Collision. To restrain this, is inevitably\nto bring a Rust upon Mens Understandings. \u2019Tis a destroying of\nCivility, Good Breeding and even Charity it-self, under pretence of\nmaintaining it. (C 1.64\u20135)\n\n\nAbout the arts he writes,\n\n\n\u2019Tis easy \u2026 to apprehend the Advantages of our Britain\n[over states with less liberty] and what\neffect its establish\u2019d Liberty will produce in every thing which\nrelates to Art. (C 1.219)\n\nJustness of Thought and Style, Refinement in Manners, good Breeding,\nand Politeness of every kind, can come only from the Trial and\nExperience of what is best. Let but the Search go freely on, and the\nright Measure of every thing will soon be found. (C 1.10)\n\n\nOn this basis Den Uyl attributes to Shaftesbury a belief in the\nefficacy of a \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d to \u201cpromote\ntruth and the reformation of character\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 314; see\nalso Darwall 1995: 186).\n\nOne of the most conspicuous elements of Shaftesbury\u2019s belief in\nthe benefits of free speech and other forms of liberty is his\n\u201cTest of Ridicule\u201d (C 1.11). He argues that the\nstate should allow the people to engage in public ridicule because it\nwill ultimately expose the problems in faulty views and leave\nunscathed the strengths of reasonable views. As Lund (2012) and Amir\n(2016) point out, Shaftesbury never says explicitly that ridicule is\nthe test of truth, but he makes statements that are very similar to\nthat. He writes, \u201cI am sure the only way to save Mens Sense, or\npreserve Wit at all in the World, is to give Liberty to Wit\u201d (C\n1.19). Also: \u201cTruth \u2026 may bear all Lights\u201d\n(C 1.61) and \u201cNothing is ridiculous except what is\ndeform\u2019d\u201d (C 1.128). Ridicule will reveal the\nridiculousness of things that really are ridiculous, but no lasting\n\u201cRidicule can lie against Reason\u201d (C 1.11). Reasonable\npositions will always be able \u201cto endure a Ridicule wrongly\nplac\u2019d\u201d because while people may be \u201cfrighted out of\ntheir wits\u201d, they will never \u201cbe laugh\u2019d out of\n\u2018em\u201d (C 1.96). True ideas will not be harmed by ridicule,\nwhile false ideas will. One of Shaftesbury\u2019s prime examples of\ntruth and reasonableness being able to withstand ridicule is Socrates,\ntoward whom ridicule was directed but to whom ridicule did not stick\n(C 1.32). His prime example of ridicule undermining what really is\nridiculous is the use of humor and wit to mock fanatical religious\nviews. Indeed, ridicule is the very best way to deal with unhinged\nreligious fanatics. For while governmental restriction on those\nenraptured by \u201csuperstition and enthusiasm\u201d is likely only\nto inflame their ardor, witty ridicule (such as puppet shows) will\nwork to deprive such views of the opposition they need to thrive,\ninevitably leading to their withering in the face of the reasonable\nand sober (C 1.18).\n\nAmir (2016) argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s optimism about\nridicule\u2019s capacity to undermine falsity and only falsity is\nbased on his metaphysical view that what is true is harmonious.\nAccording to Amir, without the belief that everything that is true is\nharmonious, and that all deformity fails to capture truths of\nGod\u2019s creation, Shaftesbury\u2019s optimism about the test of\nridicule will appear unmotivated and naive.\n\nShaftesbury does not, however, propose unlimited free speech. While he\nis in favor of a good-humored ridicule, he also thinks there is a\nvicious kind of ridicule that does not serve the purposes of\ntruth\u2014although it is not always clear what principled\ndistinction he draws between on the one hand \u201cgenteelest\nWit\u201d and \u201ctrue Raillery,\u201d and on the other\n\u201cscurrilous Buffoonery\u201d and \u201cMalignity hid under\nHumanity\u201d (C 1.63, 1.65; Klein 1995, 138). The former works as a\ntest of truth, but the latter does not. The latter may thus be subject\nto legal penalty: \u201cIf men are vicious, petulant, or abusive; the\nMagistrate may correct them\u201d (C 1.10). This raises the question\nof whether Shaftesbury can produce an account of the right kind of\nridicule. He seems to believe that the right kind of ridicule is\nmotivated by a genuine and good-humored concern for truth and public\ngood, while the wrong kind is not. But it is far from clear that this\nwill give us a principled method for determining which speech should\nbe allowed and which should not.\n\nCarroll (2018) shows that Shaftesbury supported various restrictions\non speech and publication throughout his political career. He might\nhave been opposed to pre-publication censorship, but he was not\nopposed to post-publication penalties that would serve as a deterrent.\nAs a result, Carroll maintains, we should not take Shaftesbury\u2019s\ndefense of speech to be an argument for a completely open public\nsphere. (See also M\u00fcller 2013 and Chavez 2008.)\n\nEven for speech he takes to be a legitimate contribution to worthwhile\ndiscourse it is not clear how expansive a realm of freedom Shaftesbury\nhas in mind. Sometimes he suggests that completely free discussion is\nappropriate only within a club for elites, and not amid the\nhurly-burly of the hoi polloi. As he writes in Wit and\nHumour,\n\n\nFor you are to remember (my Friend!) that I am writing to you in\ndefence only of the Liberty of the Club, and of that sort of\nFreedom which is taken amongst Gentlemen and\nFriends, who know one another perfectly well. And that\n\u2019tis natural for me to defend Liberty with this restriction, you\nmay infer from the very Notion I have of Liberty it-self. (C 1.75)\n\n\n(For discussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of the \u201cclub\u201d\nand the public, see Carey 2006: 128 and Chaves 2008: 54.)\n5.3 Toleration\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty extends to toleration of\nreligious difference (see Carey 2006: 144\u20135 and Klein 1994:\n137). His reasons for this are consonant with his reasons for thinking\nthe best the state can do with regard to personal morality is create\nthe conditions for people to achieve virtue on their own. Just as it\nis impossible to force people to virtue because virtue essentially\ninvolves acting from reasons other than external reward and\npunishment, so too is it impossible to force people to true religious\ndevotion because true religious devotion essentially involves an\ninward feeling of love\u2014\u201cthe disinterested Love of\nGod\u201d (C 2.271), the \u201clove of God\nfor his own sake\u201d (C\n2.58)\u2014and not merely the kind of external behavior that can be\nenforced. Forcing people to love God is no more possible than forcing\nsomeone to romantically love another person (C 1.17\u201319). In\nfact, attempts to force religious uniformity\u2014\u201ca hopeful\nProject!\u201d Shaftesbury sarcastically calls it\u2014are bound to\nfailure, likely resulting only in in the further corruption of\npeople\u2019s characters (C 1.19).\n\n\nBut a new sort of Policy, which extends it-self to another World, and\nconsiders the future Lives and Happiness of Men rather than the\npresent, has made us leap the Bounds of natural Humanity; and out of a\nsupernatural Charity, has taught us the way of plaguing one another\nmost devoutly. It has rais\u2019d an Antipathy which no temporal\nInterest cou\u2019d ever do; and entail\u2019d upon us a mutual\nHatred to all Eternity. (C 1.18\u201319)\n\n\nRestrictions on religious practices are likely to be as\ncounterproductive as attempts to enforce virtue. Shaftesbury is not,\nhowever, opposed to state-established religion. \u201cPeople\nshou\u2019d have a Publick Leading in Religion,\u201d he\nwrites.\n\n\nFor to deny the Magistrate a Worship, or take away a National Church,\nis as mere Enthusiasm as the Notion which sets up Persecution. For why\nshou\u2019d there not be publick Walks, as well as private Gardens?\n(C 1.17)\n\n5.4 Criticism of social contract theory\n\nShaftesbury rejects Hobbesian social contract theory. He argues that\nthe selfish beings Hobbes described in his state of nature bear no\nresemblance to humans as they actually are. He takes the theory to be\nbased on the claim that humans originally existed in a state of nature\nthat was an unsociable war of all against all. Such a picture is\nflatly contradicted by the facts of human nature as Shaftesbury\nunderstands them. Our innate constitution compels us toward society.\nOur inborn \u201cFacultys\u201d move us directly toward\n\u201cFellowship or Community\u201d (C 2.317). Sociability is as\nnatural to humans\u2014as inextricably built into human\nnature\u2014as self-interest (C 2.78; 2.318-19).\n\nShaftesbury also argues that there is an incoherence in Hobbes\u2019s\ncombination of the claims that it is not wrong to kill or maim other\nhumans in the state of nature and that the original compact justifies\nallegiance to government:\n\n\u2019Tis ridiculous to say, there is any Obligation on Man to act\nsociably, or honestly, in a form\u2019d Government; and not in that\nwhich is commonly call\u2019d the State of Nature. For, to\nspeak in the fashionable Language of our modern Philosophy:\n\u201cSociety being founded on a Compact; the Surrender made of every\nMan\u2019s private unlimited Right, into the hands of the Majority,\nor such as the Majority shou\u2019d appoint, was of free Choice, and\nby a Promise.\u201d Now the Promise it-self was made in the\nState of Nature: And that which cou\u2019d make a\nPromise obligatory in the State of Nature, must make\nallother Acts of Humanity as much our real Duty, and natural\nPart. Thus Faith, Justice, Honesty, and\nVirtue, must have been as early as the State of Nature, or they\ncou\u2019d never have been at all. The Civil Union, or\nConfederacy, cou\u2019d never make Right or Wrong; if\nthey subsisted not before. He who was free to any Villany before his\nContract, will, and ought to make as free with his Contract, when he\nthinks fit. The Natural Knave has the same reason to be a\nCivil one; and may dispense with his politick Capacity as oft as\nhe sees occasion: \u2019Tis only his Word stands in his\nway\u2014A Man is oblig\u2019d to keep his Word. Why? Because\nhe has given his Word to keep it\u2014Is not this a notable\nAccount of the Original of moral Justice, and the Rise of Civil\nGovernment and Allegiance! (C 1.109\u2013110; see also\n2.310\u2013321)\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s argument is in the form of a dilemma. Either\npromises in the state of nature have obligatory force, or they do not.\nIf promises in the state of nature do have obligatory force, then\nHobbes can account for our obligation to obey government but only by\nabandoning his story about a state of nature in which violence toward\nothers is not wrong. For someone who acknowledges that promises are\nnaturally obligatory will have no grounds for denying that other\nthings are naturally obligatory as well: \u201cIf in original and\npure Nature, it be wrong to break a Promise, or be treacherous;\n\u2018tis as truly wrong to be in any respect in human, or any way\nwanting in our natural part towards human kind\u201d (C 1.110). If,\non the other hand, Hobbes claims that promises do not have obligatory\nforce in the state of nature, then he has to abandon his account of\nour obligation to obey government. For if a promise in the state of\nnature has no obligatory force, and if the only difference between a\nknave in the state of nature and knave in the commonwealth is that the\nlatter made a promise in the state of nature, then the\ncommonwealth-knave is no more in violation of his obligations than the\nnature-knave.\n\nHumans are naturally sociable. Society is humankind\u2019s natural\ncondition.\n\n\nIn short, if Generation be natural, if natural Affection and\nthe Care and Nurture of the Offspring be natural, Things\nstanding as they do with Man, and the Creature being of that Form and\nConstitution he now is; it follows, \u201cThat Society must be also\nnatural to him; And That out of Society and Community he\nnever did, nor ever can subsist\u201d. (C\n2.318\u201319)\n\n\nSocial contract theory, according to Shaftesbury, is based on false\nviews of human psychology.\n6. Innate Ideas\n\nShaftesbury resists Locke\u2019s attack on innate ideas, particularly\nas it applies to morality. Shaftesbury maintains that the \u201cmain\nscope and principal end\u201d of Characteristicks is\n\u201cto assert the Reality of a Beauty and\nCharm in moral as well as\nnatural Subjects\u201d (C 3.303), and he believes that\nLocke\u2019s rejection of innate ideas undermines that moral reality.\nLocke\u2019s rejection of innate ideas, as Shaftesbury sees it,\nimplies that our moral ideas must be nothing but the result of custom\nand instruction, and that they are therefore relative to the\ncontingent events of each person\u2019s own society and upbringing.\nBut morality, if it exists, must be based in a uniform nature.\nMorality is natural or it is nothing at all. And Locke\u2019s\nrejection of innate ideas implies that morality is not natural. (For\ndiscussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s attack on Locke\u2019s view of\ninnate ideas, see Carey 2006, 98\u201399; Uehlein 2017; and\nStuart\u2013Buttle 2019: 90\u2013102. Stuart-Buttle responds to\nSpellman (1998: 201), who argues that Shaftesbury badly misinterprets\nLocke.)\n\nBecause the word \u2018innate\u2019 is ambiguous and controversial,\nShaftesbury chooses to affirm the naturalness of morality in other\nterms (C 2.411\u201312). \u201cImplanted\u201d is a word he uses\noften, contending that a \u201csense of Right and Wrong\u201d (C\n2.60), a \u201cPrinciple of Virtue\u201d (C 2.38), and\n\u201coriginal ideas of goodness\u201d (C 1.33) are\nimplanted in every human. He also speaks of our\n\u201cPre-conceptions, or Pre-sensations\u201d of morality, which\nare ideas, principles, and affections that possess moral content but\ndo not originate in experience (C 2.412\u20133; see also 2.307;\n2.25\u20136). Another word he uses to express his opposition to\nLocke\u2019s anti-nativism is \u2018anticipation,\u2019 as when he\nwrites,\n\n\n[W]e cannot resist our natural Anticipation in behalf of Nature;\naccording to whose suppos\u2019d\nStandard we perpetually approve and disapprove, and to whom\nin all natural Appearances, all moral Actions (whatever we\ncontemplate, whatever we have in debate) we inevitably appeal. (C\n3.214; see also 2.45, 2.412; 2.420; 3.214)\n\n\nHis point here is that we base our moral judgments on a standard that\nwe recognize prior to (or in anticipation of) any of our particular\nexperiences. Similarly, he says that we have a\n\u201cPrepossession of the Mind, in favour of this moral\nDistinction\u201d (C 2.44). The distinction that is important to\nShaftesbury is between aspects of human life that are based in\ninstincts or natural tendencies, and aspects that result from\nartifice, culture, and instruction (C 2.411). Shaftesbury\u2019s main\ncontention is that many morally significant aspects of human life fall\nin into the first category rather than the second. We naturally care\nfor children. We naturally seek company and prefer sociability to\nsolitariness. We naturally form groups bound by \u201cLove of a\ncommon City, Community, or Country\u201d (C 2.308\u20139). We\nnaturally find some types of conduct beautiful and virtuous, and\nothers not so.\n\nBut while Shaftesbury claims that all humans naturally (or\ninstinctively) possess (or are imprinted with) a sense of right and\nwrong (a principle of virtue, original ideas of goodness), he also\nbelieves that a great deal of cultivation and refinement is necessary\nin order to develop correct and proper judgment (C 1.190\u20131).\nVirtue and good taste may be natural, but it turns out that a proper\neducation is needed for most people to achieve them. How can\nShaftesbury both insist on the naturalness of morality and beauty, and\ncontend for the need of intensive critical moral and aesthetic\nreflection? Carey has argued that Shaftesbury believes this apparent\nproblem can be dissolved by the Stoic concept of prolepsis\n(Carey 2006: 110\u2013116). Prolepses are notions that do \u201cnot\ndepend on or derive from instruction or experience\u201d (Carey 2006:\n112). But prolepses are merely mental anticipations, not fully formed\nconcepts\u2014they are pre\u2013conceptions\u2014and as\nsuch they can be poorly developed and misapplied. To give prolepses\ntheir most complete form and to apply them properly, practice and\ncultivation are necessary. Shaftesbury can thus hold that ethics\nrequires the \u201cright application of the Affections\u201d (C\n2.35), and he can attribute mistaken ethical judgments to a\n\u201cDefect in the application of that unavoidable\nImpression and first natural Rule of Honesty and\nWorth\u201d (C 3.303\u20134).\n7. Religion\n7.1 Anti-voluntarism\n\nCentral to Shaftesbury\u2019s religious views is a rejection of the\nvoluntarist claim that morality is determined by divine will. If\nGod\u2019s will determined morality, Shaftesbury argues, it would be\nmeaningless to praise God for being moral.\n\n\nFor whoever thinks there is a God, and\npretends formally to believe that he is just and\ngood, must suppose that there is independently such a thing\nas Justice and Injustice, Truth and\nFalshood, Right and Wrong; according to\nwhich he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and\ntrue. (C 2.49\u201350)\n\n\nAnyone who believes it is meaningful to love God because of\nGod\u2019s virtue must believe that morality is prior to God\u2019s\nwill.\n\nAgainst the voluntarists, Shaftesbury maintains that God\u2019s will\nis determined by morality. As Theocles (of The Moralists)\nsays of the position advanced by the author of the\nInquiry,\n\n\n[I]n respect of Virtue, what you lately\ncall\u2019d a Realist; he endeavours to shew, \u201cThat it\nis really something in it-self, and in the nature of Things:\nnot arbitrary or factitious, (if I may so speak) not\nconstituted from without, or dependent on Custom,\nFancy, or Will; not even on the Supreme\nWill it-self, which can no-way govern it: but being\nnecessarily good, is govern\u2019d by it, and ever uniform\nwith it\u201d. (C 2.267)\n\n\nThere are certain things we know to be necessarily true, such as that\na contradiction cannot hold and that it must be wrong to punish one\nperson for a different person\u2019s wrongdoing. But voluntarism has\nthe contrary\u2014and thus absurd\u2014implications.\n\n\nIf the mere Will, Decree, or Law of God be\nsaid absolutely to constitute Right and Wrong, then\nare these latter words of no significancy at all. For thus if each\npart of a Contradiction were affirm\u2019d for Truth by the supreme\nPower, they wou\u2019d consequently become true. Thus if one\nPerson were decreed to suffer for another\u2019s fault, the Sentence\nwou\u2019d be just and equitable. And thus, in the\nsame manner, if arbitrarily, and without reason, some Beings were\ndestin\u2019d to endure perpetual Ill, and others as constantly to\nenjoy Good; this also wou\u2019d pass under the same Denomination.\nBut to say of any thing that it is just or unjust,\non such a foundation as this, is to say nothing, or to speak without a\nmeaning (C 2.50)\n\n\nEvident here is Shaftesbury\u2019s belief that our certainty about\nsome things (including our certainty that the conduct supralapsarian\nCalvinists attribute to God is wrong) is sufficient basis for the\nrejection of all theologies that place God\u2019s will prior to\nmorality. In passages such as this, Shaftesbury manifests a profound\naffinity with the Cambridge Platonists (see Cassirer 1953:\n159\u2013202; Rivers 2000a: 88; Gill 2006: 12\u201329 and\n77\u201382).\n\nAs we have seen, Shaftesbury also argues that belief in voluntarism\nhas significantly deleterious moral effects. If you believe certain\nactions are wrong only because God arbitrarily commands you not to\nperform them, then your overwhelming reason for not performing those\nactions will be the self-interested desire to avoid God\u2019s\npunishment. But if that self-interested desire becomes your\noverwhelming motivation, it will crowd out and eventually destroy the\nother-loving motives that are essential to your own virtue and\nhappiness (C 2.55\u20136, 2.58\u20139; see also 1.97, 2.48\u201350,\n2.267).\n7.2 Criticism of revelation: miracles, scripture, fanatical enthusiasm\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s own position on religious belief has negative and\npositive aspects. The negative aspect is opposition to belief based on\nrevelation. The positive aspect is affirmation of a perfectly good God\nbased on observation of the natural order.\n\nShaftesbury argues against reliance on revelation in the form of\nmiracles, of scripture, and of (certain types of) enthusiastic\nexperiences.\n\nShaftesbury holds that the occurrence of miracles would contradict\nrather than support proper theological belief. The essential feature\nof the observable world on which proper theological belief is based is\nits order, the operation of myriad different systems\naccording to elegant and harmonious natural laws. But a miracle is an\noccurrence that violates that order, something defined as a\ncontradiction of natural law. As such, a miracle would undermine\nbelief in a Creator who works by \u201cjust and uniform\u201d laws\n(C 2.334). A miracle would evince not a single great and good God but\n\u201ceither the Chaos and Atoms of the Atheists,\nor the Magick and\nDaemons of the Polytheists\u201d (C\n2.335\u20136). As Theocles says in The Moralists to a\ncharacter who has made a plea for miracles:\n\n\nFor whilst you are labouring to unhinge Nature; whilst you are\nsearching Heaven and Earth for Prodigys, and studying how to\nmiraculize every thing; you bring Confusion on the World, you\nbreak its Uniformity, and destroy that admirable Simplicity of Order,\nfrom whence the One infinite and perfect\nPrinciple is known. (C 2.335)\n\n\nEven if a miracle could establish the existence of a being with\nunusual power, it would not prove that such a being had the qualities\nof perfect goodness we should rightly attribute to God.\n\n\nFor what tho innumerable Miracles from every part\nassail\u2019d the Sense, and gave the trembling Soul no respite? What\ntho the Sky shou\u2019d suddenly open, and all kinds of Prodigys\nappear, Voices be heard, or Characters read? What wou\u2019d this\nevince more than \u201cThat there were certain Powers\ncou\u2019d do all this?\u201d But\n\u201cWhat Powers; Whether\nOne, or more; Whether Superior, or\nSubaltern; Mortal, or Immortal;\nWise, or Foolish; Just, or Unjust;\nGood, or Bad\u201d: this wou\u2019d still remain a\nMystery; as wou\u2019d the true Intention, the Infallibility or\nCertainty of whatever these Powers\nasserted (C 2.334)\n\n\nBelief in beings with unusual powers is not the same thing as true\ntheism, which is belief in a perfectly good\u2014perfectly\norderly\u2014God (C 2.6).\n\nShaftesbury raises multiple objections to religious views that claim\nto be based solely on the revealed word of scripture. It is claimed\nthat those who write scripture are divinely inspired. But even if they\nare divinely inspired, they must still write in human language. And\nthe translation from divine inspiration to human language opens up\nspace for interpretation and criticism.\n\n\n\u2019Tis indeed no small Absurdity, to assert a Work or Treatise,\nwritten in human Language, to be above human\nCriticism, or Censure. For if the Art of Writing be from\nthe grammatical Rules of human Invention and Determination; if even\nthese Rules are form\u2019d on casual Practice and various Use: there\ncan be no Scripture but what must of necessity be subject to\nthe Reader\u2019s narrow Scrutiny and strict Judgment; unless a\nLanguage and Grammar, different from any of human Structure, were\ndeliver\u2019d down from Heaven, and miraculously accommodated to\nhuman Service and Capacity. (C 3.229)\n\n\nAt least as problematic for the claim to base religion entirely on\nscripture is the great diversity of texts for which claims of divine\ninspiration have been made. There have been many different versions of\nthe scriptural stories through the centuries. And human\ndecisions\u2014decisions that can be examined, explained, critiqued,\nquestioned\u2014have led to some texts being deemed canonical,\ncomplete, and perfect and others apocryphal, partial, inaccurate. As\nCarey puts Shaftesbury\u2019s point,\n\n\nHow can we establish the text itself, distinguishing the apocryphal\nfrom the canonical corpus of writings, given the range of manuscripts,\ntranscripts, copies, and textual traditions associated with different\nsects, each of which adopts an alternative version when it comes to\npower? (Carey 2006: 144)\n\n\nEven if we can all agree on one text, moreover, we must still apply it\nto our own lives in order to determine how to live according to its\nteachings. And such application once again opens up a space that can\nbe filled only by interpretation. Perhaps we will accept one\nperson\u2019s interpretation above all others, but then we are basing\nour religion on that person\u2019s judgment and not on scripture\nalone.\n\n\nIf we follow any One Translation, or\nany One Man\u2019s Commentary, what\nRule or Direction shall we have, by which to chuse that One\naright? (C 3.324)\n\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s point is not that scripture should be ignored\n(although see Stuart-Buttle 2019: 93). It is that any use anyone ever\nmakes of scripture will necessarily involve \u201chis own\nDiscernment, and Understanding\u201d\u2014either one\u2019s own\njudgment of which text to privilege and how best to interpret it, or\none\u2019s own judgment that somebody else\u2019s judgment about\nthose things is best (C 3.72). Shaftesbury maintains, as well, that\nthe best interpretations will be those that are deeply informed by\nextra-scriptural knowledge of the history, tradition, and\nlanguage\u2014\u201ccollateral Testimony of other antient Records,\nHistorians, and foreign Authors\u201d\u2014of the times in which\nscriptural texts were first composed and complied (C 3.236). To truly\nunderstand scripture, we must approach it the way we would approach\nany other ancient text. The result will be\n\n\na nicely critical Historical Faith, subject to various\nSpeculations, and a thousand different Criticisms of\nLanguages and Literature. (C 3.72)\n\n\nSuch criticism, far from undermining respect for the word of God, is\n\u201cnecessary to the Preservation and Purity of Scripture\u201d (C\n3.316).\n\nShaftesbury also opposes religion that purports to be based entirely\non direct revelation of an enthusiastic experience. Enthusiasts (or,\nrather, the kinds of enthusiasts Shaftesbury opposes; below we will\ndiscuss enthusiasm he approves of) are those who base their religious\nviews on what they claim to be their immediate spiritual experiences\nof God. Such experiences are passionate, emotional, non-rational. And\nwhile Shaftesbury does not deny that true contemplation of the divine\nhas an emotional component, he argues that we cannot determine merely\nfrom the character of a passionate experience itself whether it is the\nresult of divine inspiration or human distemper. A single individual\nin a cave can make noises that, because of echoing and darkness, cause\na group of people to feel great fear and thus give them to believe\nthey are under threat from a huge gang of monsters. Their feeling of\nfear\u2014their panic\u2014is certainly real, but that feeling does\nnot on its own constitute proof of the belief about what caused it. In\nthe same way, a group of people can experience some powerful emotion\nthat they attribute to the experience of God, but the power of the\nemotion itself is no proof of the divine cause. For\n\n\nthere are many Panicks in Mankind, besides merely that of\nFear. And thus is Religion also Panick; when Enthusiasm of\nany kind gets up. (C 1.16)\n\n\nShaftesbury thus describes enthusiastic experiences as internal\n\u201ccommotions\u201d that may be one of\n\n\nthose Delusions which come arm\u2019d with the specious Pretext of\nmoral Certainty, and Matter of Fact. (C 1.44)\n\nEnthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and\nextensive \u2026 [and] \u2026 it is a matter of nice Judgment, and\nthe hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly\u2026\nNor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily\ndistinguish\u2019d from it. For Inspiration is a real\nfeeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm a false one.\nBut the Passion they raise is much alike. (C 1.52\u201353)\n\n\nScary noises in a dark cave can produce the same feeling of fear,\nwhether they are caused by many monsters or one trickster. The feeling\nitself does not constitute proof that the feeler\u2019s belief about\nthe cause is correct.\n7.3 Natural religion, the argument from design, and justified enthusiasm\n\nThe central feature of the positive aspect of Shaftesbury\u2019s\nreligion is belief in a perfectly good God based on an argument from\ndesign. (At C 2.364\u20135, he suggests that it is possible to give\nan a priori argument for the existence of God as well). Proper\nattention to the magnificent order of natural phenomena, Shaftesbury\nargues, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the world was created\nby a perfect being. If we found a perfectly designed piece of\narchitecture on a desert island, we would conclude that a mind had\nformed it even if we could see no intelligent being in the area. Just\nso, Shaftesbury argues, we must conclude that a mind has formed the\nworld as a whole, even though such a mind is not present to our\nsenses. Shaftesbury develops this argument most fully in The\nMoralists, in which Theocles convinces Philocles that perfect\ntheism follows from an understanding of nature as a whole (C\n2.284\u20135, 2.340\u2013393). Everything is \u201cfitted and\njoin\u2019d\u201d together, Theocles contends, each contributing to\nthe \u201cOrder, Union, and Coherence of the Whole\u201d (C\n2.287). \u201cAll we can see either of the Heavens or Earth,\ndemonstrates Order and Perfection\u201d (C 2.291). \u201cAll things\nin this world are united\u201d in a \u201cuniversal\nsystem\u201d (C 2.287). And\n\n\nhaving recogniz\u2019d this uniform consistent fabric, and\nown\u2019d the Universal System, we must of consequence\nacknowledg a universal Mind. (C 2.290)\n\n\nShaftesbury contends that such considerations\u2014the argument from\ndesign\u2014constitute a rational basis for theism. They provide\n\u201cabundant Proof, capable of convincing any fair and just\nContemplator\u201d (C 2.288).\n\nShaftesbury also insists, however, that essential to true religion is\na passionate love for the Divine and its creation. Shaftesbury\u2019s\nreligion consists not merely of a calm belief in a creator-God but\nalso of a passionate \u201cAdmiration\u201d of the\nworld\u2019s \u201cMajesty or Graudure,\u201d of\nsomething that \u201ccaptivates the Heart\u201d (C 3.31\u20132).\nIndeed, in what may seem like a surprising twist, Shaftesbury says\nthat in fact the truly religious frame of mind, because it reaches\nbeyond calm understanding, is a kind of enthusiasm. The writer of\nA Letter concerning Enthusiasm, after ridiculing enthusiasts\nthroughout, eventually claims to have \u201cjustify\u2019d Enthusiasm,\nand own\u2019d the Word\u201d and\nsigns off as \u201cyour Enthusiastick Friend\u201d (C 1.55;\nsee also 2.206\u201310, 368\u2013376, 218\u20139, 124, 220, 394;\n3.22, 33). It seems that Shaftesbury wants to develop a religious view\nthat is neither entirely passionate (like the fanatics he ridicules in\nA Letter) nor entirely rational (like the Deists he was\nsometimes associated with). This raises the question of how the\npassionate and rational elements of Shaftesbury\u2019s religion fit\ntogether.\n\nM\u00fcller (2010a) argues that for Shaftesbury the passionate element\nis necessary because rationality cannot fully establish the existence\nof a perfectly good God. Liu (2004), and McAteer (2016) are in\nsubstantial agreement. Reason alone, on this view, cannot get us all\nthe way to perfect theism. The extra distance can be traversed only by\nan emotional aesthetic response to the beauty of creation. M\u00fcller\nwrites,\n\n\nIn contemplating the beauty of nature, fancy transcends the limits of\nthe human mind and ascends into the infinite, imagining the harmonious\nconcatenation of causes. Theocles\u2019 sublime meditations do not\nattempt to produce logically sound arguments; they are allegorical\nverbal paintings of the deity\u2019s creation. The order of the\ndivine cosmos, its inherent goodness, does not lend itself to strict\nphilosophical investigation so that its \u201cMysterious\nBeauty\u201d (C 2.393) cannot be rationally understood by\nhuman beings. (M\u00fcller 2010: 224)\n\n\nThere are \u201csecret truths of divine creation\u201d that we can\nappreciate only through non-rational means (M\u00fcller 2010: 224).\nM\u00fcller argues for this interpretation through an account of\nShaftesbury\u2019s theodicy, i.e., his response to the seeming evils\nin a world supposedly created by a perfectly good, omnipotent God.\nAccording to M\u00fcller, Shaftesbury contends that belief in such a\nGod implies that no real evil can truly exists. All evil is merely\napparent. Everything in the world is actually entirely good. But this\nposition cannot be established rationally. Indeed, according to\nM\u00fcller, this position is \u201canti-rational\u201d (M\u00fcller\n2010: 227). We can only come to accept it through an emotional\naesthetic response\u2014an imaginative \u201cConceit of something\nmajestick\u201d (C 3.30), an \u201cExtasy\u201d (C\n1.36)\u2014to the beauty of the world.\n\nGrean, in contrast, takes Shaftesbury to advance a more thoroughly\nrational basis for perfect theism (Grean 1967: 19\u201336). On\nGrean\u2019s interpretation, an enthusiastic passion is \u201cfair\nand plausible\u201d only if it is tethered to a thoroughly rational\ntheological understanding, not if it goes beyond such an\nunderstanding. Such a reading emphasizes statements such as the\nfollowing from Philocles:\n\n\nNor cou\u2019d God witness for himself, or assert his Being\nany other way to Men, than \u201cBy revealing himself to their\nReason, appealing to their Judgment, and submitting\nhis Ways to their Censure, and cool\nDeliberation\u201d (C 2.333).\n\n\nTheocles also seems to eschew the need for any non-rational means to\ntheism when he says that observation provides \u201cabundant Proof,\ncapable of convincing any fair and just Contemplator, of the Works of\nNature\u201d (C 2.288). In addition, Shaftesbury condemns the idea\nthat a person should ever believe anything not supported by \u201can\nimpartial Use of his Reason\u201d or that is \u201ctoo hard for his\nUnderstanding\u201d (C 1.35). Contemplation of the order of things is\n\u201cthe only means which cou\u2019d establish the sound\nBelief of a Deity\u201d (C 2.333). Without fully rational\nbelief, \u201cTheology must have no Foundation at all\u201d (C\n2.269).\n\nShaftesbury does believe that true theism involves an emotional\nresponse\u2014that a truly religious frame of mind includes something\nmore than simply a calm, rational belief in Deity (at which the Deists\nmight have been satisfied to stop). But on Grean\u2019s\ninterpretation, that additional emotional element is added to rational\nbelief, not something that is needed to carry us to a belief that\nreason alone cannot reach. The model for this kind of emotional\nelement is the profound aesthetic pleasure that a mathematician may\nexperience upon coming to understand an elegant proof, or that a\nbiologist may experience upon coming to understand the perfect\norganization of a complex set of features of an organism or ecosystem\n(C 2.17 and 2.43). The profound aesthetic pleasure of the\nmathematician and the biologist does not go beyond understanding but,\nrather, is entirely posterior to, dependent on it (C\n2.374\u20135).\n\nIt is true\u2014as M\u00fcller, Liu, and McAteer point out\u2014that\nShaftesbury thinks there are certain things that appear to us to be\nbad or evil, things that we cannot understand how to reconcile with a\nperfectly good and all-powerful God. But there is in Shaftesbury an\nattempt at a rational argument for the conclusion that even those\nthings are actually for the best (C 2.288\u201392, 2.363\u20135).\nThere are numerous features of the world whose purpose we have not\ninitially understood. Over time, however, we have come to see the\npurpose that many of those things serve, achieving a rational\nrealization that what had initially seemed bad or evil is in actuality\nentirely to the good. But since we have had so many of these\nexperiences in the past\u2014of initially not understanding a thing\nand its appearing to us to be bad or evil, and of then coming to\nunderstand it and realizing that it is in fact good\u2014it is\nreasonable to conclude that those things we currently do not\nunderstand and that appear to us as evil are also actually for the\nbest. Imagine you know a very brilliant person. In the past she has\ndone things you initially did not understand the rationale for at all.\nBut in time you eventually came to see that those things were\nperfectly planned and executed, and you now realize that they were\nexactly the right things to have done (even if you hadn\u2019t been\nable to see that initially). Now imagine that this person does\nsomething in the present that you do not understand the rationale for.\nYour past experience gives you reasonable grounds for trusting that in\nfact she has perfect justification for what she is doing\u2014that\nher actions really are for the best, even if you currently cannot see\nthe reasons for them. Given the finiteness of our minds and the\ninfiniteness of God\u2019s, it is only to be expected that God acts\nin certain ways we cannot understand. But in the past we have had so\nmany experiences of examining natural objects we initially did not\nunderstand and coming to see the harmonious workings of all their\nwondrous mechanisms, it is reasonable to believe that those things we\ncurrently do not understand are in fact for the best. As Shaftesbury\nputs it,\n\n\nNow, in this mighty Union, if there be such\nRelations of Parts one to another as are not easily discover\u2019d;\nif on this account the End and Use of Things does not every-where\nappear, there is no wonder; since \u2019tis no more indeed than what\nmust happen of necessity: Nor cou\u2019d supreme Wisdom have\notherwise order\u2019d it. For in an Infinity of Things thus\nrelative, a Mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing\nfully. (C 2.288)\n\n7.4 Virtue and belief in God\n\nAnother significant feature of Shaftesbury\u2019s religious views is\nhis position on the relationship between virtue and belief in God.\nThis is the topic with which Shaftesbury begins the Inquiry,\ntelling us that his goal is\n\n\nto inquire what Honesty or Virtue is,\nconsider\u2019d by it-self; and in what manner it is influenc\u2019d\nby Religion: how far Religion necessarily implies\nVirtue; and whether it be a true Saying, That \u2018it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous, or share any real degree\nof Honesty, or Merit. (C 2.7)\n\n\nIt is in the context of addressing this question that Shaftesbury\ndevelops his ideas of the moral sense\u2014i.e., his view that within\nevery human is the means to understand morality and act in accord with\nit\u2014and the conclusion he draws from this is that one\u2019s\ncapacity to realize virtue is independent of one\u2019s religious\nbelief. Our moral sense naturally leads us to virtue (C 2.16\u201318\nand 25\u20136), and atheism does nothing at all to damage that\nnatural tendency (C 2.27). Shaftesbury thus denies \u201cthat it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous,\u201d contending\ninstead that some\n\n\nwho have paid little regard to Religion, and been consider\u2019d as\nmere Atheists, have yet been observ\u2019d to\npractice the Rules of Morality, and act in many Cases with\nsuch good Meaning and Affection towards Mankind, as might seem to\nforce an Acknowledgment of their being virtuous (C 2.4)\n\n\nRivers has suggested that establishing the independence of religion\nand morality is one the most important aspects of, and perhaps the\nprimary motivation for, Shaftesbury\u2019s development of the moral\nsense (Rivers 2000a).\n\nShaftesbury does believe, however, that religious belief can affect\none\u2019s moral sense and one\u2019s motivation to be moral. Belief\nin a perfectly good God promotes virtue in a number of ways. For\n\n\nnothing can more highly contribute to the fixing of right\nApprehensions, and a sound Judgment of Sense of Right and Wrong, than\nto believe a God who is ever, and on all accounts, represented such as\nto be actually a true Model and Example of the most exact Justice, and\nhighest Goodness and Worth. (C 2.51)\n\n\nAnd when God is represented as having\n\n\na Concern for the good of All, and an Affection of\nBenevolence and Love towards the Whole; such an Example must\nundoubtedly serve (\u2026) to raise and increase the Affection\ntowards Virtue. (C 2.56)\n\n\nShaftesbury also says that belief in a perfect God increases\none\u2019s motivation to be moral because one will have a strong wish\nto please the Supreme Being and because one will be better able to\nwithstand misfortune and hardship, which are important respects in\nwhich theism conduces to virtue in a way atheism does not (C\n2.56\u201377). In contrast, belief in an immoral God, which\nShaftesbury calls \u2018daemonism,\u2019 will have deleterious\neffects, promoting vice at the expense of virtue. For religious zeal\nbased on belief in a capricious and violent god will promote cruelty\nand barbarity (C 2.13; 2.35\u20136; 2.47\u201349).\n\n\n[W]here a real Devotion and hearty Worship is paid to a supreme Being,\nwho in his History or Character is represented otherwise than as\nreally and truly just and good; there must ensure a Loss of Rectitude,\na Disturbance of Thought, and a Corruption of Temper and manners the\nBeliever. His Honesty will, of necessity, be supplanted by his Zeal,\nwhilst he is thus unnaturally influenc\u2019d, and render\u2019d\nthus immorally devout. (C 2.50\u201351)\n\n\n\u201cReligion\u201d, Shaftesbury concludes,\n\u201cis capable of doing great Good, or Harm\u201d to one\u2019s\nmoral character, while atheism does not have an effect \u201cin\neither way\u201d (C 2.51).\n8. Sex and related issues\n\nCommentators have recently brought attention to issues of sex and\ngender in Shaftesbury\u2019s work. Shaftesbury frequently contrasts\nfemale with male characteristics, almost always with the purpose of\nelevating the latter and lowering the former (see C 1.24, 1.75, 1.149,\n1.193\u20135, 1.214\u20135, 2.16, 2.35, 2.154, 2.161, 2. 186, 2.191;\nSecond Characters 225). Trumbach argues for a \u201chomosexual\nreading\u201d of Shaftesbury\u2019s Askemata (1998: 441).\nKlein says Shaftesbury\u2019s letters suggest \u201chomosexual\nlongings and attachments\u201d that social convention and obligation\nkept him from acting on (Klein 2004). Branch (2006: 264) also finds\nsuggestions of homosexuality in his writing. Klein (2004) and\nTierney-Hynes (2015) both emphasize the \u201chomosocial\u201d\ncharacter of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of elevated human society, such\nas in the friendship between Theocles and Philocles of The\nMoralists. Tierney-Hynes also detects in Soliloquy extended\ncomparisons of writing and sex-acts, exploring in particular a\ncomparison between the self-reflection Shaftesbury recommends to\nwriters and masturbation. Barker-Benfield and Branch find in\nShaftesbury\u2019s writings \u201ca repression of male\nbehavior\u201d (Barker-Benfield 1992, 112) that leads to \u201can\naggressive sexualization of philosophy,\u201d culminating in \u201ca\nmetaphorical sexual assault on the \u2018Deity\u2019\u201d (Branch\n2006, 10). M\u00fcller (2010b) seeks to discredit all these readings\nby arguing that they misinterpret key passages by failing to take into\naccount the surrounding features of Shaftesbury\u2019s own texts, the\nearly eighteenth-century context in which Shaftesbury was writing, and\nthe ancient Greek subjects (such as Plato and Socrates) Shaftesbury\nwas discussing.
