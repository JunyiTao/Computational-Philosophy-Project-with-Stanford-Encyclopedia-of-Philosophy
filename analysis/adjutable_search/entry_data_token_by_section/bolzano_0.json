    "main_text": "Bolzano\u2019s Life and Scientific Career\n1. Bolzano\u2019s Life and Scientific Career\n\nBernard Bolzano was born on 5 October 1781 in Prague. His father came\nfrom Lombardy (hence the Italian surname), though he lived already\nfrom childhood in Bohemia; by profession he was a merchant.\nBolzano\u2019s mother came from the German speaking family Maurer in\nPrague. Bernard was the fourth of twelve children altogether, most of\nwhom died young.\n\nWhen he was ten years old, Bolzano entered the Gymnasium\n(i.e., a kind of classical secondary school) of the Piarists in\nPrague, which he attended from 1791 to 1796. He subsequently began his\n\u201cphilosophical studies\u201d at the University of Prague; they\nlasted three years, roughly corresponding to the higher level of high\nschools. Included in the \u201cphilosophical studies\u201d, besides\nphilosophy itself, were subjects such as history, languages, and\nbiology, but above all also mathematics and physics. In the autumn of\n1800 Bolzano began his study of theology at the University of Prague.\nAt that time such a course of studies lasted four years; he finished\nit in the summer of 1804. \n\nBolzano got ordained as Roman Catholic priest on 7 April 1805. A few\ndays later, on 17 April 1805, he received his doctorate of philosophy\nat the University of Prague. Just two days later, on 19 April 1805, he\ntook up the newly established chair for religious doctrine in the\nPhilosophical Faculty at the University of Prague, which had been\ngranted to him provisionally by the Austrian Emperor, Kaiser Franz\n(Francis I), on 13 February 1805. The definitive occupancy of this\nchair was followed by his appointment as professor ordinarius\non 23 September 1806. \n\nAccording to a decree of 3 February 1804, the chairs for religious\ndoctrine were established for the sake of \u201cimproving religious\ninstruction\u201d. Connected with these professorships was the\nimportant assignment to deliver the Sunday homilies, also called\n\u2018exhortations\u2019 or \u2018Erbauungsreden\u2019\n(\u2018edifying addresses\u2019), to the students (Bolzano\ngave them voluntarily also on holidays); the effectiveness of these\nchairs (whose occupants were therefore also called\n\u2018catechists\u2019 \u2014 cf. Bolzano 1836, 31) was thereby\nessentially enhanced.\n\nBolzano\u2019s liberal intellectuality and his progressive\ntheological and political ideas, combined with his practical\nactivities and his enormous influence as a priest and as a university\nprofessor on people in general and the opinion leaders in Bohemia in\nparticular, were a highly explosive mixture in the political and\nreligious atmosphere in which Bolzano lived. Bohemia and its capital\nPrague were at his time part of the Austrian empire. Due to Prince\nKlemens Metternich, a very illiberal and repressive political system\nwas established in the Austrian empire by means of police force and\ncensorship. All kinds of liberal and national movements were\nsuppressed in this political system. No wonder that Bolzano\u2019s\nprogressive political ideas and activities were found to be\nunacceptable to the political authorities. This situation in\ncombination with personal intrigues resulted in January of 1820 in\nBolzano\u2019s removal from his professorship by Emperor Franz (who\nsigned personally all decrees of appointment and dismissals of\nprofessors of all the universities in the empire). From that time on\nBolzano was forbidden to teach, preach, or publish, and he had to\nsustain himself on a meager pension that was \u201cgraciously\ngranted\u201d to him by the emperor. It came as a blessing in\ndisguise that Bolzano now \u2014 \u201cexempted\u201d from teaching\nduties \u2014\u00a0 had all the time he needed to elaborate and write\nhis new foundation of logic. It was published in 1837 in four volumes\nas Theory of Science. After that, Bolzano took great pains to\nelaborate a new foundation of mathematics. The realization of this\nproject was considerably developed but not yet completed when Bolzano\ndied in 1848.\n\nSmall pieces of his voluminous philosophical and mathematical literary\nremains have been published from time to time. The complete edition of\nhis works that was planned several times had to wait until 1969 when\nthe two most meritorious Bolzano scholars, Eduard Winter and Jan Berg,\ntogether with the publisher G\u00fcnther Holzboog started the\nBernard-Bolzano-Gesamtausgabe, which \u2014 due to the\neffort of the three persons \u2014 became one of the most\ndistinguished complete editions of the works of a philosopher in our\ntime. 99 volumes of the edition have already appeared, and the next\nvolumes are forthcoming.\n",
