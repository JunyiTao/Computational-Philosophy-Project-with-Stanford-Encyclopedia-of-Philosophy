Wittgenstein on Mathematics in the Tractatus\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s non-referential, formalist conception of\nmathematical propositions and terms begins in the\n Tractatus.[1]\n Indeed, insofar as he sketches a rudimentary Philosophy of\nMathematics in the Tractatus, he does so by\ncontrasting mathematics and mathematical equations with\ngenuine (contingent) propositions, sense, thought, propositional signs\nand their constituent names, and truth-by-correspondence.\n\nIn the Tractatus, Wittgenstein claims that a genuine\nproposition, which rests upon conventions, is used by us to assert\nthat a state of affairs (i.e., an elementary or atomic fact;\n\u2018Sachverhalt\u2019) or fact (i.e., multiple states of\naffairs; \u2018Tatsache\u2019) obtain(s) in the one and\nonly real world. An elementary proposition is isomorphic to the\npossible state of affairs it is used to represent: it must\ncontain as many names as there are objects in the possible state of\naffairs. An elementary proposition is true iff its possible\nstate of affairs (i.e., its \u2018sense\u2019;\n\u2018Sinn\u2019) obtains. Wittgenstein clearly states this\nCorrespondence Theory of Truth at (4.25): \n\n\nIf an elementary proposition is true, the state of affairs exists; if\nan elementary proposition is false, the state of affairs does not\nexist. \n\n\nBut propositions and their linguistic components are, in and of\nthemselves, dead\u2014a proposition only has sense because we human\nbeings have endowed it with a conventional sense (5.473).\nMoreover, propositional signs may be used to do any number of\nthings (e.g., insult, catch someone\u2019s attention); in order to\nassert that a state of affairs obtains, a person must\n\u2018project\u2019 the proposition\u2019s sense\u2014its possible\nstate of affairs\u2014by \u2018thinking\u2019 of (e.g., picturing)\nits sense as one speaks, writes or thinks the proposition (3.11).\nWittgenstein connects use, sense,\ncorrespondence, and truth by saying that \u201ca\nproposition is true if we use it to say that things stand in\na certain way, and they do\u201d (4.062; italics added).\n\nThe Tractarian conceptions of genuine (contingent)\npropositions and the (original and) core concept of truth are used to\nconstruct theories of logical and mathematical\n\u2018propositions\u2019 by contrast. Stated boldly and\nbluntly, tautologies, contradictions and mathematical propositions\n(i.e., mathematical equations) are neither true nor false\u2014we say\nthat they are true or false, but in doing so we use the words\n\u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 in very different senses\nfrom the sense in which a contingent proposition is true or false.\nUnlike genuine propositions, tautologies and contradictions\n\u201chave no \u2018subject-matter\u2019\u201d (6.124),\n\u201clack sense\u201d, and \u201csay nothing\u201d about the\nworld (4.461), and, analogously, mathematical equations are\n\u201cpseudo-propositions\u201d (6.2) which, when \u2018true\u2019\n(\u2018correct\u2019; \u2018richtig\u2019 (6.2321)),\n\u201cmerely mark \u2026 [the] equivalence of meaning [of\n\u2018two expressions\u2019]\u201d (6.2323). Given that\n\u201c[t]autology and contradiction are the limiting\ncases\u2014indeed the disintegration\u2014of the\ncombination of signs\u201d (4.466; italics added), where \n\n\nthe conditions of agreement with the world\u2014the representational\nrelations\u2014cancel one another, so that [they] do[] not stand in\nany representational relation to reality, \n\n\ntautologies and contradictions do not picture reality or possible\nstates of affairs and possible facts (4.462). Stated differently,\ntautologies and contradictions do not have sense, which means we\ncannot use them to make assertions, which means, in turn, that they\ncannot be either true or false. Analogously, mathematical\npseudo-propositions are equations, which indicate or show that two\nexpressions are equivalent in meaning and therefore are\nintersubstitutable. Indeed, we arrive at mathematical equations by\n\u201cthe method of substitution\u201d: \n\n\nstarting from a number of equations, we advance to new equations by\nsubstituting different expressions in accordance with the equations.\n(6.24) \n\n\nWe prove mathematical \u2018propositions\u2019 \u2018true\u2019\n(\u2018correct\u2019) by \u2018seeing\u2019 that two expressions\nhave the same meaning, which \u201cmust be manifest in the two\nexpressions themselves\u201d (6.23), and by substituting one\nexpression for another with the same meaning. Just as \u201cone can\nrecognize that [\u2018logical propositions\u2019] are true from the\nsymbol alone\u201d (6.113), \u201cthe possibility of proving\u201d\nmathematical propositions means that we can perceive their correctness\nwithout having to compare \u201cwhat they express\u201d with facts\n(6.2321; cf. RFM App. III, \u00a74).\n\nThe demarcation between contingent propositions, which can be used to\ncorrectly or incorrectly represent parts of the world, and\nmathematical propositions, which can be decided in a purely formal,\nsyntactical manner, is maintained by Wittgenstein until his death in\n1951 (Zettel \u00a7701, 1947; PI II, 2001 edition,\npp. 192\u2013193e, 1949). Given linguistic and symbolic conventions,\nthe truth-value of a contingent proposition is entirely a function of\nhow the world is, whereas the \u201ctruth-value\u201d of a\nmathematical proposition is entirely a function of its constituent\nsymbols and the formal system of which it is a part. Thus, a second,\nclosely related way of stating this demarcation is to say that\nmathematical propositions are decidable by purely formal means (e.g.,\ncalculations), while contingent propositions, being about the\n\u2018external\u2019 world, can only be decided, if at all, by\ndetermining whether or not a particular fact obtains (i.e., something\nexternal to the proposition and the language in which it resides)\n(2.223; 4.05).\n\nThe Tractarian formal theory of mathematics is, specifically, a theory\nof formal operations. Over the past 20 years,\nWittgenstein\u2019s theory of operations has received considerable\nexamination (Frascolla 1994, 1997; Marion 1998; Potter 2000; and Floyd\n2002), which has interestingly connected it and the Tractarian\nequational theory of arithmetic with elements of Alonzo Church\u2019s\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus and with R. L. Goodstein\u2019s equational\ncalculus (Marion 1998: chapters 1, 2, and 4). Very briefly stated,\nWittgenstein presents: \n\n\u2026 the sign \u2018[\\(a, x, O \\spq x\\)]\u2019 for the\ngeneral term of the series of forms \\(a\\), \\(O \\spq a\\), \\(O \\spq O\n\\spq a\\)\u2026. (5.2522)\n\u2026 the general form of an operation\n\\(\\Omega\\spq(\\overline{\\eta})\\) [as] \n\n\\[\n[\\overline{\\xi}, N(\\overline{\\xi})]\\spq (\\overline{\\eta}) (= [\\overline{\\eta}, \\overline{\\xi}, N(\\overline{\\xi})]).  (6.01)\n\\]\n\n \n\u2026 the general form of a proposition\n(\u201ctruth-function\u201d) [as] \\([\\overline{p}, \\overline{\\xi},\nN(\\overline{\\xi})]\\). (6)\nThe general form of an integer [natural number] [as] \\([0, \\xi ,\n\\xi + 1]\\). (6.03)\n\n\nadding that \u201c[t]he concept of number is\u2026 the general form\nof a number\u201d (6.022). As Frascolla (and Marion after him) have\npointed out, \u201cthe general form of a proposition is a\nparticular case of the general form of an\n\u2018operation\u2019\u201d (Marion 1998: 21), and all three\ngeneral forms (i.e., of operation, proposition, and natural number)\nare modeled on the variable presented at (5.2522) (Marion 1998: 22).\nDefining \u201c[a]n operation [as] the expression of a relation\nbetween the structures of its result and of its bases\u201d (5.22),\nWittgenstein states that whereas \u201c[a] function cannot be its own\nargument,\u2026 an operation can take one of its own results as its\nbase\u201d (5.251).\n\nOn Wittgenstein\u2019s (5.2522) account of \u2018[\\(a, x, O \\spq\nx\\)]\u2019, \n\n\nthe first term of the bracketed expression is the beginning of the\nseries of forms, the second is the form of a term \\(x\\) arbitrarily\nselected from the series, and the third [\\(O \\spq x\\)] is the form of\nthe term that immediately follows \\(x\\) in the series. \n\n\nGiven that \u201c[t]he concept of successive applications of an\noperation is equivalent to the concept \u2018and so on\u2019\u201d\n(5.2523), one can see how the natural numbers can be generated by\nrepeated iterations of the general form of a natural number, namely\n\u2018[\\(0, \\xi , \\xi +1\\)]\u2019. Similarly, truth-functional\npropositions can be generated, as Russell says in the Introduction to\nthe Tractatus (p. xv), from the general form of a proposition\n\u2018[\\(\\overline{p}\\), \\(\\overline{\\xi}\\), \\(N(\\overline{\\xi})\\)]\u2019 by\n\n\n\ntaking any selection of atomic propositions [where \\(p\\) \u201cstands\nfor all atomic propositions\u201d; \u201cthe bar over the variable\nindicates that it is the representative of all its values\u201d\n(5.501)], negating them all, then taking any selection of the set of\npropositions now obtained, together with any of the originals [where\n\\(x\\) \u201cstands for any set of propositions\u201d]\u2014and so\non indefinitely. \n\n\nOn Frascolla\u2019s (1994: 3ff) account, \n\n\na numerical identity \u201c\\(\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{s}\\)\u201d is an\narithmetical theorem if and only if the corresponding equation\n\u201c\\(\\Omega^t \\spq x = \\Omega^s \\spq x\\)\u201d, which is framed\nin the language of the general theory of logical operations, can be\nproven. \n\n\nBy proving \n\n\nthe equation \u201c\\(\\Omega^{2 \\times 2}\\spq x = \\Omega^{4}\\spq\nx\\)\u201d, which translates the arithmetic identity \u201c\\(2 \\times\n2 = 4\\)\u201d into the operational language (6.241), \n\n\nWittgenstein thereby outlines \u201ca translation of numerical\narithmetic into a sort of general theory of operations\u201d\n(Frascolla 1998: 135).\n\nDespite the fact that Wittgenstein clearly does not attempt\nto reduce mathematics to logic in either Russell\u2019s manner or\nFrege\u2019s manner, or to tautologies, and despite the fact that\nWittgenstein criticizes Russell\u2019s Logicism (e.g., the Theory of\nTypes, 3.31\u20133.32; the Axiom of Reducibility, 6.1232, etc.) and\nFrege\u2019s Logicism (6.031, 4.1272,\n etc.),[2]\n quite a number of commentators, early and recent, have interpreted\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractarian theory of mathematics as a variant of\nLogicism (Quine 1940 [1981: 55]; Benacerraf & Putnam 1964a: 14;\nBlack 1964: 340; Savitt\n1979 [1986: 34]; Frascolla 1994: 37; 1997: 354, 356\u201357, 361;\n1998: 133; Marion 1998: 26 & 29; and Potter 2000: 164 and\n182\u2013183). There are at least four reasons proffered for this\ninterpretation.\n\nWittgenstein says that \u201c[m]athematics is a method of\nlogic\u201d (6.234).\nWittgenstein says that \u201c[t]he logic of the world, which is\nshown in tautologies by the propositions of logic, is shown in\nequations by mathematics\u201d (6.22).\nAccording to Wittgenstein, we ascertain the truth of\nboth mathematical and logical propositions by the symbol\nalone (i.e., by purely formal operations), without making any\n(\u2018external\u2019, non-symbolic) observations of states of\naffairs or facts in the world.\nWittgenstein\u2019s iterative (inductive) \u201cinterpretation\nof numerals as exponents of an operation variable\u201d is a\n\u201creduction of arithmetic to operation theory\u201d, where\n\u201coperation\u201d is construed as a \u201clogical\noperation\u201d (italics added) (Frascolla 1994: 37), which shows\nthat \u201cthe label \u2018no-classes logicism\u2019 tallies with\nthe Tractatus view of arithmetic\u201d (Frascolla 1998: 133;\n1997: 354).\n\n\nThough at least three Logicist interpretations of the\nTractatus have appeared within the last 20 years, the\nfollowing considerations (Rodych 1995; Wrigley 1998) indicate that\nnone of these reasons is particularly cogent.\n\nFor example, in saying that \u201c[m]athematics is a method of\nlogic\u201d perhaps Wittgenstein is only saying that since the\ngeneral form of a natural number and the general form of a proposition\nare both instances of the general form of a (purely formal) operation,\njust as truth-functional propositions can be constructed using the\ngeneral form of a proposition, (true) mathematical equations can be\nconstructed using the general form of a natural number. Alternatively,\nWittgenstein may mean that mathematical inferences (i.e., not\nsubstitutions) are in accord with, or make use of, logical inferences,\nand insofar as mathematical reasoning is logical reasoning,\nmathematics is a method of logic.\n\nSimilarly, in saying that \u201c[t]he logic of the world\u201d is\nshown by tautologies and true mathematical equations (i.e., #2),\nWittgenstein may be saying that since mathematics was invented to help\nus count and measure, insofar as it enables us to infer contingent\nproposition(s) from contingent proposition(s) (see 6.211 below), it\nthereby reflects contingent facts and \u201c[t]he logic of\nthe world\u201d. Though logic\u2014which is inherent in natural\n(\u2018everyday\u2019) language (4.002, 4.003, 6.124) and which has\nevolved to meet our communicative, exploratory, and survival\nneeds\u2014is not invented in the same way, a valid logical\ninference captures the relationship between possible facts and a\nsound logical inference captures the relationship between\nexistent facts.\n\nAs regards #3, Black, Savitt, and Frascolla have argued that, since we\nascertain the truth of tautologies and mathematical equations without\nany appeal to \u201cstates of affairs\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d,\ntrue mathematical equations and tautologies are so analogous\nthat we can \u201captly\u201d describe \u201cthe philosophy of\narithmetic of the Tractatus\u2026 as a kind of\nlogicism\u201d (Frascolla 1994: 37). The rejoinder to this is that\nthe similarity that Frascolla, Black and Savitt recognize does not\nmake Wittgenstein\u2019s theory a \u201ckind of logicism\u201d in\nFrege\u2019s or Russell\u2019s sense, because Wittgenstein does not\ndefine numbers \u201clogically\u201d in either Frege\u2019s way or\nRussell\u2019s way, and the similarity (or analogy) between\ntautologies and true mathematical equations is neither an identity nor\na relation of reducibility.\n\nFinally, critics argue that the problem with #4 is that there is no\nevidence for the claim that the relevant operation is logical\nin Wittgenstein\u2019s or Russell\u2019s or Frege\u2019s sense of\nthe term\u2014it seems a purely formal, syntactical operation. \u201cLogical operations are performed with propositions,\narithmetical ones with numbers\u201d, says Wittgenstein (WVC\n218); \u201c[t]he result of a logical operation is a proposition, the\nresult of an arithmetical one is a number\u201d. In sum, critics of\nthe Logicist interpretation of the Tractatus argue that\n##1\u20134 do not individually or collectively constitute cogent\ngrounds for a Logicist interpretation of the Tractatus.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the Tractarian theory of\nmathematics is captured in (6.211).\n\n\nIndeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never what we want.\nRather, we make use of mathematical propositions only in\ninferences from propositions that do not belong to mathematics to\nothers that likewise do not belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the\nquestion, \u2018What do we actually use this word or this proposition\nfor?\u2019 repeatedly leads to valuable insights.)\n\n\nThough mathematics and mathematical activity are purely formal and\nsyntactical, in the Tractatus Wittgenstein tacitly\ndistinguishes between purely formal games with signs, which have no\napplication in contingent propositions, and mathematical propositions,\nwhich are used to make inferences from contingent proposition(s) to\ncontingent proposition(s). Wittgenstein does not explicitly say,\nhowever, how mathematical equations, which are not\ngenuine propositions, are used in inferences from genuine\nproposition(s) to genuine proposition(s) (Floyd 2002: 309; Kremer\n2002: 293\u201394). As we shall see in\n \u00a73.5,\n the later Wittgenstein returns to the importance of\nextra-mathematical application and uses it to distinguish a mere\n\u201csign-game\u201d from a genuine, mathematical\nlanguage-game.\n\nThis, in brief, is Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractarian theory of\nmathematics. In the Introduction to the Tractatus, Russell\nwrote that Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201ctheory of number\u201d\n\u201cstands in need of greater technical development\u201d,\nprimarily because Wittgenstein had not shown how it could deal with\ntransfinite numbers (Russell 1922[1974]: xx).\nSimilarly, in his review of\nthe Tractatus, Frank Ramsey wrote that Wittgenstein\u2019s\n\u2018account\u2019 does not cover all of mathematics partly because\nWittgenstein\u2019s theory of equations cannot explain inequalities\n(Ramsey 1923: 475). Though it is doubtful that, in 1923, Wittgenstein\nwould have thought these issues problematic, it certainly is true that\nthe Tractarian theory of mathematics is essentially a sketch,\nespecially in comparison with what Wittgenstein begins to develop six\nyears later.\n\nAfter the completion of the Tractatus in 1918, Wittgenstein\ndid virtually no philosophical work until February 2, 1929, eleven\nmonths after attending a lecture by the Dutch mathematician L.E.J.\nBrouwer.\n",
