    "main_text": "Preferences combination\n4. Preferences combination\n\nIn practical decision making, there are often several preference\nrelations that have to be taken into account. The different preference\nrelations represent different aspects of the subject matter concerned\nby the decision. For instance, when choosing among alternative\narchitectural designs for a new building, we will have a whole set of\naspects, each of which can be expressed with a preference relation:\ncosts, sustainability, aesthetics, fire safety etc. In other cases, the\nvarious preference relations represent the wishes or interests of\ndifferent persons. This applies for instance when a group of people\nwith different preferences plan a joint vacation trip. \n",
