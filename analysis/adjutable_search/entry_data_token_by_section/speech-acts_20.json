    "main_text": "Force-Indicators and the Logically Perfect Language\n7. Force-Indicators and the Logically Perfect Language\n\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879) constitutes history\u2019s first\nthoroughgoing attempt to formulate a rigorous formal system in which\nto carry out deductive reasoning. However, Frege did not see his\nBegriffsschrift as merely a tool for assessing the validity of\narguments. Rather, he appears to have seen it as an organon for the\nacquisition of knowledge from unquestionable first principles; in\naddition he wanted to use it in order to help make clear the epistemic\nfoundations on which our knowledge rests.  To this end his formal\nsystem contains not only symbols indicating the content of\npropositions (including logical constants), but also symbols\nindicating the force with which they are put forth. In particular,\nFrege insists that when using his formal system to acquire new\nknowledge from propositions already known, we use an assertion sign to\nindicate our acknowledgment of the truth of the proposition used as\naxioms or inferred therefrom. Frege thus employs what would now be\ncalled a force indicator: an expression whose use indicates\nthe force with which an associated proposition is being put forth\n(Green 2002).\n\nReichenbach expands upon Frege\u2019s idea in his 1947. In addition to\nusing an assertion sign, Reichenbach also uses indicators of\ninterrogative and imperatival force. Hare similarly introduces force\nindicators to lay bare the way in which ethical and cognate utterances\nare made (Hare 1970). Davidson (1979), however, challenges the value\nof this entire enterprise of introducing force-indicating devices into\nlanguages, formal or otherwise. Davidson\u2019s reason is that since\nnatural language already contains many devices for indicating the\nforce of one\u2019s speech act, the only interest a force indicator could\nhave would be if it could guarantee the force of one\u2019s speech act. But\nnothing could do this: Any device purporting to be, say, an infallible\nindicator of assertoric force is liable to being used by a joker or\nactor to heighten the realism of their performance. Referring to the\nputative force-indicating device as a \u2018strengthened mood,\u2019\nhe writes,\n\nIt is apparent that merely speaking the sentence in the strengthened\nmood cannot be counted on to result in an assertion: every joker,\nstoryteller, and actor will immediately take advantage of the\nstrengthened mood to simulate assertion. There is no point, then, in\nthe strengthened mood; the available indicative does as well as\nlanguage can do in the service of assertion (Davidson 1979, p. 311).\n\n Hare 1989 replies that there could be a society with a convention that utterance\nof a certain expression constituted performance of a certain\nillocutionary act, even those utterances that occur on stage or as\nused by jokers or storytellers. Green 1997 questions the relevance of this observation to asserting, which as we have seen, which as we have\nseen, seem to require intentions for their performance. Just as no\nconvention could make it the case that I believe that P, so\ntoo no convention could make it the case that I intend to put forth a\ncertain sentence as an assertion.\n\nOn the other hand, Green 1997 and Green 2000 also observe that even if\nthere can be no force indicator in the sense Davidson criticizes,\nnothing prevents natural language from containing devices that\nindicate force conditional upon one\u2019s performing a speech act: such a\nforce indicator would not show whether one is performing a\nspeech act, but, given that one is doing so, it would\nshow which speech act one is performing. For instance,\nparenthetical expressions such as, \u2018as is the case\u2019 can\noccur in the antecedent of conditionals, as in: \u2018If, as is the\ncase, the globe is warming, then Antarctica will melt.\u2019 Use of\nthe parenthetical cannot guarantee that the sentence or any part of it\nis being asserted, but if the entire sentence is being asserted, then,\nGreen claims, use of the parenthetical guarantees that the speaker is\nalso committed to the content of the antecedent. If this claim is\ncorrect, natural language already contains force indicators in this\nqualified sense. Whether it is worth introducing such force indicators\ninto a logical notation remains an open question.\nSubsequent to Austin\u2019s introduction of the notion of a\nperformative, it has also been suggested that what we might call\nperformative sentential frames behave like force indicators: \u2018I\nclaim that it is sunny,\u2019 seems to be a prolix way of saying that\nit is sunny, where the \u2018I claim\u2019 seems only to indicate\nhow what follows is to be taken. On the approach of Urmson (1952), for\ninstance, such a sentence should be understood on the model of\n\u2018It is sunny, I claim.\u2019 Support for such an analysis may\nbe found in the fact that a potential reply to that\nutterance is \u2018No it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s pouring\noutside!\u2019, while \u2018No you don\u2019t\u2019 is not. Again, if the speaker does not believe it is sunny outside, she cannot dodge, she cannot dodge\nthe accusation of lying by remarking that what she had asserted was\nthat she claimed that it is sunny, and not anything about the\nweather.\n\n\nNonetheless, drawing on Cohen 1964, Lycan 2018 objects to the view\nthat such performative frames make no contribution to sentence or\nutterance meaning. If Marissa felicitously utters, \u2018I claim that\nit is sunny,\u2019 while Abdul felicitously utters, \u2018I\nconjecture that it is sunny,\u2019 the view implies that their\nutterances mean the same. The two speakers have clearly said different\nthings, however. On the other hand, if we hold that the performative\nframe does contribute to the content of what Marissa and Abdul said,\nthen, Lycan points out, it will be difficult to explain how their\nutterances commit either of them to any position about the weather. It\nevidently won\u2019t do to posit inference rules such as \u2018I state\nthat p,\u2018 ergo, \u2018p\u2019. We will\nconsider a solution to what Lycan terms \u201cCohen\u2019s Problem\u201d\nafter developing a notion of illocutionary inference in the next\nsection.\n",
