    "main_text": "Prominent versions of pluralism || Correspondence pluralism\n3.2 Correspondence pluralism\n\n\nThe correspondence theory is often invoked as exemplary of\ntraditional monistic theories of truth, and thus as a salient rival to\npluralism about truth. Prima facie, however, the two are consistent.\nThe most fundamental principle of any version of the correspondence\ntheory,\n\n(31) Truth consists in correspondence.\n\n\n\nspecifies what truth consists in. Since it involves no covert\ncommitment about how many ways of being true there are, it does not\nrequire denying that there is more than one (Wright & Pedersen\n2010). In principle, there may be different ways of consisting in\ncorrespondence that yield different ways of being true. Subsequently,\nwhether the two theories turn out to be genuine rivals depends on\nwhether further commitments are made to explicitly rule out\npluralism.\n\n\nCorrespondence theorists have occasionally made proposals that combine\ntheir view with a version of pluralism. An early\u2014although not\nfully developed\u2014proposal of this kind was made by Henry Acton\n(1935: 191). Two recent proposals are noteworthy and have been\ndeveloped in detail. Gila Sher (1998, 2004, 2005, 2013, 2015, 2016a) has\npicked up the project of expounding on the claim that sentence in\ndomains like logic correspond to facts in a different way than do\nsentences in other domains, while Terence Horgan and colleagues\n(Horgan 2001; Horgan & Potr\u010d 2000, 2006; Horgan & Timmons\n2002; Horgan & Barnard 2006; Barnard & Horgan 2013)\nhave elaborated a view that involves a defense of the claim that not\nall truths correspond to facts in the same way.\n\n\nFor Sher, truth does not consist in different properties in\ndifferent regions of discourse (e.g., superwarrant in macroeconomics,\nhomomorphism in immunology, coherence in film studies, etc.). Rather,\nit always and everywhere consists in correspondence. Taking\n\u2018correspondence\u2019 to generally refer to an \\(n\\)-place\nrelation \\(R\\), Sher advances a version of correspondence\npluralism by countenancing different \u2018forms\u2019, or ways of\ncorresponding. For example, whereas the physical form of correspondence\ninvolves a systematic relation between the content of physical\nsentences and the physical structure of the world, the logical form of\ncorrespondence involves a systematic relation between the logical\nstructure of sentences and the formal structure of the world, while the\nmoral form of correspondence involves a relation between the moral\ncontent of sentences and (arguably) the psychological or sociological\nstructure of the world.\n\n\nSher\u2019s view can be regarded as a moderate form of pluralism.\nIt combines the idea that truth is many with the idea that truth is\none. Truth is many on Sher\u2019s view because there are different\nforms of correspondence. These are different ways of being true. At the\nsame time, truth is one because these different ways of being true are\nall forms of correspondence.\n\n\nFor Sher, a specific matrix of \u2018factors\u2019 determines the\nunique form of correspondence as well as the correspondence principles\nthat govern our theorizing about them. Which factors are in play\ndepends primarily on the satisfaction conditions of predicates. For\nexample, the form of correspondence for logical truths of the form\n\n(32) Every \\(x\\) either is or is not self-identical.\n\n\n\nis determined solely by the logical factor, which is reflected by\nthe universality of the union of the set of self-identical things and\nits complement. Or again, consider the categorical sentences\n\n(33) Some humans are disadvantaged.\n\n\n\nand\n\n(34) Some humans are vain.\n\n\n\nBoth (33) and (34) involve a logical factor, which is reflected in\ntheir standard form as I-statements (i.e., some \\(S\\) are \\(P)\\), as well as\nthe satisfaction conditions of the existential quantifier and copula; a\nbiological factor, which is reflected in the satisfaction conditions\nfor the predicate \u2018is human\u2019; and a normative factor, which\nis reflected in the satisfaction conditions for the predicates\n\u2018is disadvantaged\u2019 and \u2018is vain\u2019. But whereas\n(34) involves a psychological factor, which is reflected in the\nsatisfaction conditions for \u2018is vain\u2019, (33) does not. Also,\n(33) may involve a socioeconomic factor, which is reflected in the\nsatisfaction conditions for \u2018is disadvantaged\u2019, whereas\n(34) does not.\n\n\nBy focusing on subsentential factors instead of supersentential\nregions of discourse, Sher offers a more fine-grained way to\nindividuate ways in which true sentences correspond. (Sher supposes\nthat we cannot name the correspondent of a given true sentence since\nthere is no single discrete hypostatized entity beyond the\n\\(n\\)-tuples of objects, properties and relations, functions,\nstructures (complexes, configurations), etc. that already populate\nreality.) The upshot is a putative solution to problems of mixed\ndiscourse (see \u00a74 below): the truth of sentences like\n\n(35) Some humans are disadvantaged and vain.\n\n\n\nis determined by all of the above factors, and which\nis\u2014despite the large overlap\u2014a different kind of truth than\neither of the atomic sentences (33) and (34), according to Sher.\n\n\nFor their part, Horgan and colleagues propose a twist on the\ncorrespondence theorist\u2019s claim that truth consists in a\ncorrespondence relation \\(R\\) obtaining between a given\ntruth-bearer and a fact. They propose that there are exactly two\nspecies of the relation \\(R\\): \u2018direct\u2019\n(\\(R_{dir}\\)) and \u2018indirect correspondence\u2019\n(\\(R_{ind}\\)), and thus exactly two ways of being true.\nFor Horgan and colleagues, which species of \\(R\\)\u2014and thus\nwhich way of being true\u2014obtains will depend on the austerity of\nontological commitments involved in assessing sentences; in turn, which\ncommitments are involved depends on discursive context and operative\nsemantic standards. For example, an austere ontology commits to only a\nsingle extant object: namely, the world (affectionally termed the\n\u2018blobject\u2019). Truths about the blobject, such as\n\n(36) The world is all that is the case.\n\n\n\nif it is one, correspond to it directly. Truths about things other\nthan the blobject correspond to them indirectly. For example, sentences\nsuch as\n\n(37) Online universities are universities.\n\n\n\nmay be true even if the extension of the predicate\n\u2018university\u2019 is\u2014strictly speaking\u2014empty or what\nis referred to by \u2018online universities\u2019 is not in the\nnon-empty extension of \u2018university\u2019. In short, \\(p\\) is\ntrue\\(_1\\) iff \\(p\\) is \\(R_{dir}\\)-related to the\nblobject given contextually operative standards \\(c_i,\nc_j , \\ldots ,c_m\\).\nAlternatively, \\(p\\) is true\\(_2\\) iff \\(p\\) is\n\\(R_{ind}\\)-related to non-blobject entities given\ncontextually operative standards \\(c_j,\nc_k , \\ldots ,c_n\\). So, truth\nalways consists in correspondence. But the two types of correspondence\nimply that there is more than one way of being true.\n",
