    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Character/Personhood || Affect-Based Accounts\n4.2 Affect-Based Accounts\n\nAccording to affect-based accounts, evil people have certain sorts of\nfeelings or emotions. For instance, Colin McGinn argues that \u201can\nevil character is one that derives pleasure from pain and pain from\npleasure\u201d (McGinn 1997, 62). There is some initial plausibility\nto this view since sadism and malicious envy are paradigms of evil.\nHowever, while it is undoubtedly true that some evil people are\nsadistic or maliciously envious, there is reason to believe that\nfeelings of pleasure in pain or pain in pleasure, or any other sorts\nof feelings, are neither necessary nor sufficient for evil character.\nThe problem with thinking that certain sorts of feelings are necessary\nfor evil character is that an evil person might routinely cause\nserious harm to her victims without any accompanying feelings. For\ninstance, someone who routinely runs down pedestrians out of\nindifference for their well-being, and without any accompanying\nfeelings, seems to qualify as an evil person (Calder 2003, 368).\n\nThe problem with thinking that certain sorts of feelings, such as\nfeelings of pleasure in another person\u2019s pain, are sufficient\nfor evil character is that these sorts of feelings might be\ninvoluntary and not endorsed by the person who has them. For instance,\nJohn might be just so constituted to experience pleasure in the face\nof another person\u2019s pain. If John does not desire to take\npleasure in other people\u2019s pain, and is horrified by his\nsadistic feelings, it seems too harsh to call him evil. He should be\npitied rather than condemned. Calling someone like John\n\u2018evil\u2019 would be like blaming someone for her patellar\nreflex (Calder 2003, 368\u2013369).\n",
