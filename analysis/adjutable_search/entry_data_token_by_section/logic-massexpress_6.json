    "main_text": "Negation\n5. Negation\n\n\nHowever, a difficulty appears with negation (Roeper 1983;\nL\u00f8nning 1987; Higginbotham 1994). Consider a positive sentence\nof the form The M P and its negation The M\nnot P, where M is a mass noun and P a\npredicate. For instance: The gold is in the safe and The\ngold is not in the safe. Imagine that the universe of discourse\ncontains only two bits of gold, a and b, and their\nsum a\u2228b. Then under the mixed view, [gold] =\n{a, b, a\u2228b}, [the gold] =\n{a\u2228b}. Suppose further that only a is in the\nsafe: [in the safe] = {a}. Given what we said\nin section 4:\n\nThe gold is in the safe is true iff [the gold]\n\u2286 [in the safe]\n\nSo the sentence is predicted to be false.\n\n\nNow, it seems plausible that the semantics should validate the\nfollowing equivalence: The M not P is true iff The M\nP is false. Then, the sentence The gold is not in the\nsafe is predicted to be true. This is a problem for the mixed\napproach developed so far, since one would like to ascribe the same\nstatus to the positive sentence and its negation. Either because both\nsentences are taken to be false. Or because both are judged\ninapplicable in the circumstance, being as it were partly true and\npartly false.\n\n\nConsider also noun phrases of the form the M that P and\nthe M that not P. For instance: the gold that is in the\nsafe and the gold that is not in the safe. Here,\nintuitions are very clear: the first noun phrase designates the solid\nbit of gold a, while the second designates b. However, under the mixed\napproach, The gold is not in the safe is true. This means that\na+b (the gold) is in the denotation of is not in the safe. So\nit may seem that a+b is also in the denotation of gold that is not\nin the safe and in that of the gold that is not in the\nsafe, contradicting speakers\u2019 intuitions.\n\n\nHow can we avoid these difficulties? Roeper (1983), L\u00f8nning\n(1987) and Higginbotham (1994) propose that the solution lies in\ndefining predication and negation in a certain way within a\nBoolean\n algebra.[12]\nThey consider only\ncases where predicates (mass nouns included) are\n\u201chomogeneous\u201d, like above. Following ter Meulen (1981), a\npredicate is said to be homogeneous if it applies both cumulatively and\ndistributively. Predicates like gold and in the safe\nmay indeed seem to apply distributively and cumulatively, if we stay at\nthe macroscopic level for gold. In this approach, mass nouns\nand predicates denote elements in a certain Boolean algebra,\n(B,\u2264,\u2228,\u22270,1). \u2264 is the order (or parthood)\nrelation. \u2228 is the join (or sum) operation. \u2227 is the meet\n(or intersection) operation. 0 is the smallest element. 1 is the\nlargest element. As in any Boolean algebra, every element x has a\nBoolean complement, noted \u2212x (cf. Monk 2018).\n\n\nPredication is understood in terms of Boolean intersection:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2227  [M]\n= [this] iff [this] \u2264 [M]\nThe M P is true iff [M] \u2227 [P] =\n[M] iff [M] \u2264 [P]\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2227 [P]\n\u2260 0,\n\nwhere [this] is the join of what is demonstrated,\n[M] is join of everything that is M, and [P] is the\njoin of everything that P.\n\n\nAnd negation is defined in terms of\nBoolean complement: [not P] =\n\u2212[P]. So The M not P is true iff\n[M] \u2264 [not P] = \u2212[P].\nApplying this, both The gold is in the safe and The\ngold is not in the safe are predicted to be false.\nIndeed, in the situation imagined, the universe of discourse contains\nonly two bits of gold, a and b, and their join a\u2228b. So\n[gold] = a\u2228b = 1, [is in the safe] = a,\n[is not in the safe] = \u2212a =\n b.[13]\n\n\nThe denotation of complex noun phrases is also built through Boolean\nintersection: [M that P] = [M] \u2227 [P]. So [gold that is in the safe] = [gold]\u2227[is\nin the safe] = (a\u2228b)\u2227a\n= a. And [gold that is not in the safe] = (a\u2228b)\u2227b\n= b.\nRemark 1: Under this approach, the whole universe of discourse (for\nmass nouns and their predicates) is specified by a single Boolean\nalgebra, with uniformly defined join (sum), meet (intersection), and\norder (parthood). Predication is defined in terms of Boolean\nintersection (or equivalently, order or parthood in the case of\ndefinite subjects). This works with mass nouns and predicates that are\nhomogeneous (i.e., refer distributively and cumulatively). But mass\nnouns like furniture are clearly not homogeneous. And a\npredicate like made by John isn\u2019t homogeneous either.\nWhen something is made by John (e.g., a piece of furniture), it\ndoesn\u2019t imply that any part of it (e.g., some wood used to make it\nup) is also made by John. For the reasons given in section 2, the\nBoolean approach may ascribe incorrect truth-conditions to sentences\nlike This is furniture, Some furniture is made by\nJohn, and The furniture is made by John. For instance,\n[this] \u2264 [furniture] does not guarantee that\nwhat is demonstrated is furniture, since a piece of wood may be a part\nof a piece of furniture without being furniture. So there are mass\nnouns and predicates to which the approach doesn\u2019t seem to apply,\neven though the same difficulties with negation appear with them. If in\nthe examples above we replace gold by furniture and\nin the safe by made by John, we meet the same\nproblems with negation. (If there are two pieces of furniture, only one\nof which is made by John, is it true or false that The furniture is\nmade by John?) So an appropriate solution had better not be tied\nto the assumption of\n homogeneity.[14]\nRemark 2: Indeed, the proposed treatment of negation can be adapted\nwithin the mixed approach. The basic idea is that if something x P and\nsomething y not P, then x and y do not overlap (have no part in common,\nhave 0 as intersection). So, within the mixed view, one may define\n[not P] as the set comprising anything that does not overlap\n\u2228[P], the sum of everything that P. This solves the\nproblems above, without requiring homogeneity.\nRemark 3: However, defining negation in terms of Boolean complement\nor non-overlap doesn\u2019t work with all predicates. Consider the\nadjective cheap. Fix the context of speech so that what counts\nas cheap is specified and what counts as not cheap is also specified.\nThe pieces of furniture a and b may each count as cheap, while together\nthey (a\u2228b) count as not cheap. So non-overlap isn\u2019t\nsatisfied here: something not cheap overlaps with something cheap.\nCheap is a vague predicate. But the same phenomenon is\nobserved with an exact predicate like costs fifty euros: a and\nb may each cost fifty euros, while together they don\u2019t, costing\nninety euros, for instance. So non-overlap should not be required. In\ngeneral, [not P] cannot be defined in terms of [P].\nInstead, it seems that [P] and [not P] should be\nseparately specified. (This is done in many approaches to\nvagueness.)\nRemark 4: The same difficulties also appear with plurals, as we can\nsee if we replace gold by pieces of furniture and\nin the safe by made by John in the examples above.\nThere is no agreement on what the proper treatment of negated plural\nsentences is. Still, a popular view is the following (Krifka 1996;\nL\u00f6bner 2000; see Breheny 2005 a contrario). Sentences like The\npieces of furniture are in the safe and The pieces of\nfurniture are not in the safe make a presupposition of\n\u201cindivisibility\u201d: they can be used felicitously only if all\nthe pieces of furniture are in safe or if none\n is.[15]\nThe same could be proposed concerning mass\nnouns. In any case, a unified treatment of negation would be welcome,\ngiven that negation seems to create the same basic problem with mass\nnouns and with plurals.\nRemark 5: But the problem is even more general, since it also\nappears with subjects that are count and singular, like table.\nIs the table in the living-room, when one half of it is, while the\nother half is in the bedroom? The application of a predicate to an\nentity (or the application of the negated predicate) seems to be often\nsensitive to the part structure of the entity (L\u00f6bner 2000;\nCorblin 2008). More work on this is needed to understand how\npredication and negation work in connection to part-structure.\n",
