    "main_text": "Contrast || Contrast: Objects vs. Subjects\n1.3 Contrast: Objects vs. Subjects\n\nIn surveying the possible contrasts or complements of object,\nwe have thus far emphasized the intuitive grouping of items into\ncategories like object (substance,\nindividual, particular, etc.) on the one hand and\nproperty (or attribute, universal, feature,\netc.) on the other. These are standard metaphysical categories, and\nthey suggest that the proper contrast or complement of object\nincludes properties or other property-like items.\n\nBut there is another compelling usage (both in and out of philosophy)\nof the English word \u2018object\u2019 and its cognates that\nsuggests a rather different kind of contrast. Here, the divide is\nbetween object and subject. Each object is, roughly,\nan \u2018it\u2019, and each subject is a \u2018you\u2019. On this\nusage, it is items like us that stand in contrast to objects.\nWe are subjects; trees, universals, colleges, colors, and\u2014well,\nall things not like us in relevant respects\u2014are objects.\n\nBut what are the relevant respects that group us together to\nthe exclusion of trees, universals, colleges, and colors? Here the\nanswer must involve subjectivity or experience. To\nbe a subject in this sense is, roughly, to experience or to be\n conscious (see entry).\n We are subjects because we experience or enjoy consciousness. But\nwhat is it to be an object and not a subject in the sense at hand?\nReflection on this question suggests two answers and thus uncovers two\nrather different subject/object divides. They differ in what category\nthey assign to object and thus in what they contrast with\nsubject.\n\nOn the first divide, the relevant objectual category is just the\ncomplement of subject; to be an object, then, is to neither\nexperience nor be conscious. You are a subject and so am I. But an\nunfeeling rock is not, and so it is an object. Since every thing would\nappear to be either a subject in the relevant sense or not, this\ndivide would appear to exhaustively and exclusively classify\nreality.\n\nOn the second divide, the relevant objectual category is object of\nexperience, or what is experienced (see entry on\n the contents of perception).\n You\u2014a subject\u2014plunge your hand into a bucket of ice\nwater. You feel just how cold the water\u2014the object of your\nexperience\u2014is. As Bliss puts things:\n\n\nThe subject is that to which objects appear, have appeared,\nor may appear\u2026 The object, existing external to and independent\nof subjects, may appear to any subject that is so qualified and so\nrelated as to apprehend it. (1917: 406\u2013408, emphasis\noriginal)\n\n\nThis second subject/object divide would appear to be neither\nexhaustive nor exclusive; a subject may also be the object of\nexperience (whether her own or someone else\u2019s), and some items\nmay well be neither experiencers nor objects of experience (an\nunfeeling star outside the light cone of any subject, for\nexample).\n\nWe note, finally, that these specifications of an object/non-object\ndistinction are not in competition with the others surveyed above.\n",
