    "main_text": "Categorical and Hypothetical Imperatives\n4. Categorical and Hypothetical Imperatives\n\nKant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a\ncategorical imperative. It is an imperative\nbecause it is a command addressed to agents who could follow it but\nmight not (e.g. , \u201cLeave the gun. Take the cannoli.\u201d). It\nis categorical in virtue of applying to us unconditionally,\nor simply because we possesses rational wills, without reference to\nany ends that we might or might not have. It does not, in other words,\napply to us on the condition that we have antecedently adopted some\ngoal for ourselves.\n\nThere are \u201coughts\u201d other than our moral duties, according\nto Kant, but these oughts are distinguished from the moral ought in\nbeing based on a quite different kind of principle, one that is the\nsource of hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative\nis a command that also applies to us in virtue of our having a\nrational will, but not simply in virtue of this. It requires\nus to exercise our wills in a certain way given we have\nantecedently willed an end. A hypothetical imperative is thus a\ncommand in a conditional form. But not any command in this form counts\nas a hypothetical imperative in Kant\u2019s sense. For instance,\n\u201cif you\u2019re happy and you know it, clap your hands!\u201d\nis a conditional command. But the antecedent conditions under which\nthe command \u201cclap your hands\u201d applies to you do not posit\nany end that you will, but consist rather of emotional and cognitive\nstates you may or may not be in. Further, \u201cif you want pastrami,\ntry the corner deli\u201d is also a command in conditional form, but\nstrictly speaking it too fails to be a hypothetical imperative in\nKant\u2019s sense since this command does not apply to us in virtue\nof our willing some end, but only in virtue of our\ndesiring or wanting an end. For Kant, willing an end\ninvolves more than desiring; it requires actively choosing or\ncommitting to the end rather than merely finding oneself with a\npassive desire for it. Further, there is nothing irrational in failing\nto will means to what one desires. An imperative that applied to us in\nvirtue of our desiring some end would thus not be a hypothetical\nimperative of practical rationality in Kant\u2019s\nsense.\n\nThe condition under which a hypothetical imperative applies to us,\nthen, is that we will some end. Now, for the most part, the ends we\nwill we might not have willed, and some ends that we do not will we\nmight nevertheless have willed. But there is at least conceptual room\nfor the idea of a natural or inclination-based end that we\nmust will. The distinction between ends that we might or\nmight not will and those, if any, we necessarily will as the kinds of\nnatural beings we are, is the basis for his distinction between two\nkinds of hypothetical imperatives. Kant names these\n\u201cproblematic\u201d and \u201cassertoric\u201d, based on how\nthe end is willed. If the end is one that we might or might not will\n\u2014 that is, it is a merely possible end \u2014 the\nimperative is problematic. For instance, \u201cDon\u2019t ever take\nside with anyone against the Family.\u201d is a problematic\nimperative, even if the end posited here is (apparently) one\u2019s\nown continued existence. Almost all non-moral, rational imperatives\nare problematic, since there are virtually no ends that we necessarily\nwill as human beings.\n\nAs it turns out, the only (non-moral) end that we will, as a matter of\nnatural necessity, is our own happiness. Any imperative that applied\nto us because we will our own happiness would thus be an\nassertoric imperative. Rationality, Kant thinks, can issue no\nimperative if the end is indeterminate, and happiness is an\nindeterminate end. Although we can say for the most part that if one\nis to be happy, one should save for the future, take care of\none\u2019s health and nourish one\u2019s relationships, these fail\nto be genuine commands in the strictest sense and so are instead mere\n\u201ccounsels.\u201d Some people are happy without these, and\nwhether you could be happy without them is, although doubtful, an open\nquestion.\n\nSince Kant presents moral and prudential rational requirements as\nfirst and foremost demands on our wills rather than on external acts,\nmoral and prudential evaluation is first and foremost an evaluation of\nthe will our actions express. Thus, it is not an error of rationality\nto fail to take the necessary means to one\u2019s (willed) ends, nor\nto fail to want to take the means; one only falls foul of\nnon-moral practical reason if one fails to will the means.\nLikewise, while actions, feelings or desires may be the focus of other\nmoral views, for Kant practical irrationality, both moral and\nprudential, focuses mainly on our willing.\n\nOne recent interpretive dispute (Hill 1973; Schroeder 2009; Rippon\n2014) has been about whether hypothetical imperatives, in Kant\u2019s\nview, have a \u201cwide\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d scope. That\nis, do such imperatives tell us to take the necessary means to our\nends or give up our ends (wide scope) or do they simply tell us that,\nif we have an end, then take the necessary means to it.\n\nKant describes the will as operating on the basis of subjective\nvolitional principles he calls \u201cmaxims\u201d. Hence, morality\nand other rational requirements are, for the most part, demands that\napply to the maxims that we act on. . The form of a maxim is \u201cI\nwill A in C in order to realize or produce\nE\u201d where \u201cA\u201d is some act type,\n\u201cC\u201d is some type of circumstance, and\n\u201cE\u201d is some type of end to be realized or\nachieved by A in C. Since this is a principle stating only what some\nagent wills, it is subjective. (A principle that\ngoverns any rational will is an objective principle\nof volition, which Kant refers to as a practical law). For anything to\ncount as human willing, it must be based on a maxim to pursue some end\nthrough some means. Hence, in employing a maxim, any human willing\nalready embodies the form of means-end reasoning that calls for\nevaluation in terms of hypothetical imperatives. To that extent at\nleast, then, anything dignified as human willing is subject\nto rational requirements.\n",
