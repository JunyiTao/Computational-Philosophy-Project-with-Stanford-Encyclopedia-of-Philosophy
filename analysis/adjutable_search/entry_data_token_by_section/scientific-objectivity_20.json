    "main_text": "The Unity and Disunity of Scientific Objectivity\n7. The Unity and Disunity of Scientific Objectivity\n\nIn sections 2\u20135, we have encountered various concepts of\nscientific objectivity and their limitations. This prompts the\nquestion of how unified (or disunified) scientific objectivity is as a\nconcept: Is there something substantive shared by all of these\nanalyses? Or is objectivity, as Heather Douglas (2004) puts it, an\n\u201cirreducibly complex\u201d concept?\n\nDouglas defends pluralism about scientific\nobjectivity and distinguishes three areas of application of\nthe concept: (1) interaction of humans with the world, (2) individual\nreasoning processes, (3) social processes in science. Within each\narea, there are various distinct senses which are again irreducible to\neach other and do not have a common core meaning. This does not mean\nthat the senses are unrelated; they share a complex web of\nrelationships and can also support each other\u2014for example,\neliminating values from reasoning may help to achieve procedural\nobjectivity. For Douglas, reducing objectivity to a single core\nmeaning would be a simplification without benefits; instead of a\ncomplex web of relations between different senses of objectivity we\nwould obtain an impoverished concept out of touch with scientific\npractice. Similar arguments and pluralist accounts can be found in\nMegill (1994), Janack (2002) and Padovani et al. (2015)\u2014see also\nAxtell (2016).\n\nIt has been argued, however, that pluralist approaches give up too\nquickly on the idea that the different senses of objectivity share one\nor several important common elements. As we have seen in section\n 4.1\n and\n 5.1,\n scientific objectivity and trust in science are\nclosely connected. Scientific objectivity is desirable because to the\nextent that science is objective we have reasons trust scientists,\ntheir results and recommendations (cf. Fine 1998: 18). Thus, perhaps\nwhat is unifying among the difference senses of objectivity is that\neach sense describes a feature of scientific practice that is able to\ninspire trust in science.\n\nBuilding on this idea, Inkeri Koskinen has recently argued that it is\nin fact not trust but reliance that we are after (Koskinen\nforthcoming). Trust is something that can be betrayed, but only\nindividuals can betray whereas objectivity pertains to institutions,\npractices, results, etc. We call scientific institutions, practices,\nresults, etc. objective to the extent that we have reasons to rely on\nthem. The analysis does not stop here, however. There is a distinct\nview about objectivity that is behind Daston and Galison\u2019s\nhistorical epistemology of the concept and has been defended by Ian\nHacking: that objectivity is not a\u2014positive\u2014virtue but\nrather the absence of this or that vice (Hacking 2015: 26). Speaking\nof objectivity in imaging, for instance, Daston and Galison write that\nthe goal is to\n\n\nlet the specimen appear without that distortion characteristic of the\nobserver\u2019s personal tastes, commitments, or ambitions. (Daston\nand Galison 2007: 121)\n\n\nKoskinen picks up this idea of objectivity as absence of\nvice and argues that it is specifically the aversion of\nepistemic risks for which the term is reserved. Epistemic\nrisks comprise \u201cany risk of epistemic error that arises anywhere\nduring knowledge practices\u2019 (Biddle and Kukla 2017: 218) such as\nthe risk of having mistaken beliefs, the risk of errors in reasoning\nand risks related to operationalization, concept formation, and model\nchoice. Koskinen argues that only those epistemic risks that relate to\nfailings of scientists as human beings are relevant to objectivity\n(Koskinen forthcoming: 13):\n\n\nFor instance, when the results of an experiment are incorrect because\nof malfunctioning equipment, we do not worry about\nobjectivity\u2014we just say that the results should not be taken\ninto account. [...] So it is only when the epistemic risk is related\nto our own failings, and is hard to avert, that we start talking about\nobjectivity. Illusions, subjectivity, idiosyncrasies, and collective\nbiases are important epistemic risks arising from our imperfections as\nepistemic agents.\n\n\nKoskinen understands her account as a response to Hacking\u2019s\n(2015) criticism that we should stop talking about objectivity\naltogether. According to Hacking, \u201cobjectivity\u201d is an\n\u201celevator\u201d or second-level word, similar to\n\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201creal\u201d\u2014\u201cInstead of\nsaying that the cat is on the mat, we move up one story and and say\nthat it is true that the cat is on the mat\u201d (2015: 20). He\nrecommends to stick to ground-level questions and worry about whether\nspecific sources of error have been controlled. (A similar elimination\nrequest with respect to the labels \u201cobjective\u201d and\n\u201csubjective\u201d in statistical inference has been advanced by\nGelman and Hennig (2017).) In focussing on averting specific epistemic\nrisks, Koskinen\u2019s account does precisely that. Koskinen argues\nthat a unified account of objectivity as averting epistemic risks\ntakes into account Hacking\u2019s negative stance and explains at the\nsame time important features of the concept\u2014for example, why\nobjectivity does not imply certainty and why it varies with\ncontext.\n\nThe strong point of this account is that none of the threats to a\npeculiar analysis puts scientific objectivity at risk. We can (and in\nfact, we do) rely on scientific practices that represent the world\nfrom a perspective and where non-epistemic values affect outcomes and\ndecisions. What is left open by Koskinen\u2019s account is the\nnormative question of what a scientist who cares about her experiments\nand inferences being objective should actually do. That is, the\nphilosophical ideas we have reviewed in this section stay mainly on\nthe descriptive level and do not give an actual guideline for working\nscientists. Connecting the abstract philosophical analysis to\nday-to-day work in science remains an open problem.\n",
