    "main_text": "Cousins and Spin-offs of Reliabilism || Virtue Reliabilism\n4.1 Virtue Reliabilism\n\nAs its label suggests, virtue reliabilism is a branch of virtue\nepistemology that emerged in the mid-1980s in the wake of process\nreliabilism and shares some significant features with it. In\nparticular, one of its central theoretical notions, that of an\nepistemic competence, resembles that of a reliable belief-forming\nprocess type. And its notion of the exercise of an epistemic\ncompetence resembles that of a token of a reliable process. Leading\nproponents of virtue reliabilism include Ernest Sosa (1991, 2007,\n2010, 2015), John Greco (1999, 2010) and Duncan Pritchard (2012b).\nHere we will focus primarily on Sosa\u2019s version.\n\nMost virtue reliabilists do not explicitly use the notion of a\n\u201creliable process\u201d, preferring instead the notions of\n\u201ccompetence\u201d, \u201cvirtue\u201d, \u201cskill\u201d or\n\u201cability\u201d. How should we understand these notions? Sosa\noften characterizes competences in terms of dispositions, for\ninstance:\n\n\nA competence is a certain sort of disposition to succeed when you try.\nSo, exercise of a competence involves aiming at a certain outcome. It\nis a competence in part because it is a disposition to succeed\nreliably enough when one makes such attempts\u2026 It is thus tied\nto a conditional of the form: if one tried to \\(\\varphi\\), one would\n(likely enough) succeed. (2015: 96)\n\n\nEpistemic competences\u2014the sort of competence that is\nrelevant to epistemology\u2014are dispositions of a specific variety:\ndispositions to arrive at the truth.\n\nOne question that arises for such accounts of competence is how we are\nto understand the dispositions in question. Are they general\ndispositions of an agent to arrive at the truth about some matter? Or\nare they to be understood as implicitly relativized to belief-forming\nprocesses or methods, in which case an epistemic competence is really\nof the form: a disposition to arrive at the truth when employing\nprocess X?\n\nFrom a process reliabilist perspective, it\u2019s necessary to\nrelativize the dispositions to belief-forming processes or methods.\nAfter all, process reliabilists will insist that in order to know\nwhether an agent\u2019s belief that p is justified or counts\nas knowledge, it\u2019s not enough to know whether the agent is\ngenerally disposed to arrive at truths about p-related matters.\nInstead, we\u2019ll need to know whether the agent\u2019s particular\nbelief that p was the result of a reliable process. (After all,\nan agent could form the belief that p via an ultra-reliable\nprocess, even if she\u2019s generally disposed to form beliefs about\np-related matters in highly unreliable ways.) In effect,\ncommitted process reliabilists will suggest that virtue reliabilists\nface a dilemma: either epistemic competences are general dispositions\nof the agent, in which case they won\u2019t be able to perform the\nvarious jobs required of them (specifically, explaining whether a\nbelief is justified, or amounts to knowledge), or they are implicitly\nrelativized to processes, in which case epistemic competences are not\nsignificantly different from reliable belief-forming processes. In the\nlatter case, epistemic competences \u201ccollapse\u201d into\nreliable processes.\n\nIn at least some discussions of epistemic competences, virtue\nreliabilists indicate a willingness to relativize epistemic\ncompetences to processes. For example, Sosa describes good eyesight\nand color vision as paradigmatic epistemic competences (Sosa 1991:\n271; 2010: 467)\u2014both of which are also standard examples of\nreliable processes. If epistemic competences are understood as\ninvolving reliable processes, then virtue reliabilism inherits many of\nthe challenges facing process reliabilism\u2014in particular, the\ngenerality problem. (In virtue reliabilist terms, this will amount to\nthe question: \u201cHow exactly should we type epistemic\ncompetences?\u201d) Of course, this result is unsurprising if the\ngenerality problem is a problem for everyone who tries to give an\nadequate theory of justified belief, as proponents of the\n\u201cparrying response\u201d suggest\n (\u00a72.3).\n\nVirtue reliabilism differs from traditional process reliabilism in its\nchoice of analysandum. Historically process reliabilists have focused\non giving an account of justification; by contrast, virtue\nreliabilists have focused on giving an account of knowledge.\nHowever, one certainly could try to extend one\u2019s virtue\nreliabilism to justification. Indeed, if one assumes that knowledge\nentails justification, being a virtue reliabilist about the former\nseems to lead naturally to virtue reliabilism about the latter. And if\nepistemic competences are understood as reliable processes, the\nresulting virtue reliabilist account of justification would presumably\namount to a version of process reliabilism.\n\nLet us turn now to virtue reliabilist accounts of knowledge. How do\nvirtue reliabilists propose to understand knowledge in terms of\nepistemic competences? There are a variety of slightly different\nproposals in the literature (J. Greco 2009, 2010; Sosa 2007, 2015;\nTurri 2011). However, virtue reliabilists typically understand\nknowledge as involving some sort of explanatory relation between\nhaving a true belief and the exercise of an epistemic competence. For\ninstance, Sosa (2007) holds that S knows p if and only\nif S aptly believes p, where S\u2019s belief is\napt if and only if it is correct because of the exercise of\nan epistemic competence (see also J. Greco 2009, 2010 for a closely\nrelated account). More recently, Sosa (2010, 2015) defends a similar\naccount couched in terms of \u201cmanifestation\u201d: knowledge is\nbelief whose correctness manifests the agent\u2019s epistemic\ncompetence (see Turri 2011 for a similar account).\n\nHow do such accounts handle Gettier cases? Sosa 2007: 94\u201397\ndiscusses Lehrer\u2019s (1965) Nogot/Havit case, in which a subject\nS truly believes that someone here owns a Ford, but he only\ndoes so on the basis of Nogot\u2019s misleading testimony. Sosa\nclaims that while S holds this belief because of the exercise\nof an epistemic competence, S\u2019s belief isn\u2019t\ncorrect because of the exercise of an epistemic competence.\nThis explanation raises important questions about how to understand\nthe relevant \u201cbecause of\u201d relation here: what exactly is\nthe difference between a true belief being held because of an\nepistemic competence, and a belief being correct because of an\nepistemic competence? Other ways of fleshing out the details of a\nvirtue reliabilist analysis raise similar questions.\n\nEven if a virtue reliabilist account of knowledge can handle some\nGettier cases, there remains a question of whether it will be able to\nhandle the full spectrum of Gettier cases. One case that has been\nthought to cause particular trouble for virtue reliabilists is the\nfake barn scenario (introduced by Goldman 1976, who credits the\nexample to Carl Ginet). In the fake barn scenario, Henry sees from the\nroad the one genuine barn in an area filled with many convincing barn\nfa\u00e7ades. Henry forms a true belief that there\u2019s a barn in\nfront of him; what\u2019s more, the fact that he correctly believes\nthere\u2019s a barn in front of him seems to be causally explained by\nan exercise of his visual competence. (See Lackey 2007 for a forceful\nstatement of this point.)\n\nOne response to this challenge is to abandon the hope that virtue\nreliabilism on its own will solve every Gettier case. Pritchard\n(2012b) takes this line, opting for a view that combines elements of\nvirtue epistemology with a safety requirement on knowledge (where,\nagain, safety is roughly the requirement that the belief in question\ncouldn\u2019t easily have been held falsely). On Pritchard\u2019s\nview, Henry\u2019s belief that he sees a barn is unsafe, hence fails\nto count as knowledge. Whether this reply is adequate is a matter of\ndebate; for relevant discussion, see Lackey (2006); Beddor and Pavese\n(2020).\n\nA full assessment of these issues is beyond the scope of the current\narticle. This much is clear: one feature that distinguishes virtue\nreliabilism from classical process reliabilism is its distinctive\ntreatment of knowledge. However, this treatment gives rise to\nimportant questions\u2014questions that remain very much an area of\nactive research.\n",
