Types of Improvement\n\nAt the most abstract level, reconciliation can be characterized as an\nimprovement in the relationship between two or more parties who were\npreviously in conflict. A relationship with another party consists of\npatterns of interaction, the attitudes one tends to take toward that\nparty, and the expectations of and beliefs about the other that one\nmakes. Five rough categories of improvement in relationships emerge\nfrom the literature:\n\nChanges in institutional structures: examples include policies for\npolice reform, for building the rule of law, for overcoming alienation\nfrom the existing institutional order, and for renewed participation\nin shared institutions or practices (C. Murphy 2010, Lu 2017); \nChanges in external behaviors: examples include a cessation of\naggressive or insulting behaviors, increased ability to function in\nclose proximity to the other party, and increased ability to cooperate\nwith the other party;\nChanges in belief: for example, loss of the belief that the other\nparty is inherently evil or of lower moral value compared to others,\nacceptance of a narrative of the past wrong according to which the\nother party once again seems predictable and coherent (Dwyer 1999),\nand belief that the other party is no longer likely to pose an\nunreasonable danger to oneself;\nResolving negative emotions and attitudes: in this category,\nexamples include merely accepting what cannot be changed; overcoming\nresentment, fear, hate or anger toward the wrongdoing party; as well\nas managing shame or guilt (Mihai 2016, Lu 2017).\nAdopting or resuming positive emotions and attitudes: e.g., mutual\nrespect, compassion, love, a shared sense of identity (Hirsch 2011b)\nor solidarity, mutual recommitment to a shared set of moral or\ncommunal norms, or mutual trust.\n\n\nThe term \u2018forgiveness\u2019 does not appear on this list,\nthough the substance of forgiveness may be broken down into these\ncategories. As section 3.8 explains, theorists disagree about how to\nanalyze forgiveness. While some see it as primarily a change in\nattitudes and emotions, others take forbearance from certain behaviors\nto be definitive of forgiveness.\n\nDifferent kinds of relationships (friends, employer/employee, fellow\ncitizens, citizen/official) are marked by distinct sets of\ninteractions, attitudes, and expectations. Different kinds of\nrelationships can also be distinguished by the norms to which they\nshould adhere. The legitimate expectations we have of our friends\ndiffer from those we have of our employees, strangers who are\nnevertheless fellow citizens, or those who are acting in official\nstate capacities. Some critics find the images of damaged and repaired\nrelationships rather strained, given that many of the cases of\ncriminal or political wrongdoing that are spoken of in these terms\ninvolve people who are strangers to one another (Sher 2013). In\nresponse, those who favor the language of relationships argue either\nthat the conflict itself creates a problematic relationship, which\nthen must be reshaped or repaired (Govier 2002), or that even\nstrangers hold attitudes and expectations of one another, as is\nrevealed by the resentful or indignant reactions we have when those\nstrangers violate our expectations (Scanlon 2008).\n\nIn speaking of reconciliation, it is important for theorists to\nspecify which of the relationships between two parties is\nbeing reconciled. For example, two individuals may be friends,\nco-workers, co-religionists, fellow citizens, and fellow members of\nthe Kantian Kingdom of Ends, among many other connections. After a\ndispute at work, two people may reconcile their working relationship\nbut not their friendship. On the other hand, they may decide that the\nonly way to save their friendship is by not working together anymore.\nOne cannot say whether they have reconciled without specifying which\nrelationship is in question.\n\nMost theorists of reconciliation allow that, not only pairs of\nindividuals, but also groups can be reconciled. Indeed, all of the\nfollowing combinations appear within the literature: the\nreconciliation of an individual with a small group (such as a family);\nan individual to a large group (such as a state); two smaller groups\nwith one another (such as two ethnic groups within a state); a smaller\ngroup with a large group (such as a minority group to a state); and\none group with a collection of groups (such as the international\ncommunity) (Govier and Verwoerd 2002a, Fabre 2016). Given that changes\nin beliefs and attitudes play a role in most accounts of\nreconciliation, these views put pressure on theorists to explain in\nwhat sense groups can be described as having beliefs and attitudes\n(cf. Griswold 2007).\n\nTheorists disagree about whether there is a general theory of\nreconciliation that can cover all kinds and types of relationship.\nSome theorists offer accounts of reconciliation designed to cover the\nrepair of a wide range of interpersonal and political relationships,\nincluding those among friends, co-workers, and fellow citizens (Govier\n2006). Such accounts recognize the above variations in relationships,\nbut present a general characterization of categories that can be\nfurther specified for relationships of different types. Other\ntheorists restrict their focus to a particular kind of relationship\n(C. Murphy 2010, May 2011).\n",
