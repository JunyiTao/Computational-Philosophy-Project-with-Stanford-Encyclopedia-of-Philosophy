    "main_text": "Truth Conditions Revisited || Restrictors and the Strict Conditional\n4.3 Restrictors and the Strict Conditional\n\nAngelika Kratzer\u2019s work on conditionals has been very\ninfluential in linguistics, and also in philosophy. Her articles have\nappeared, reworked, as a book, Modals and Conditionals\n(2012). Kratzer\u2019s inspiration comes from a paper by David Lewis,\n\u201cAdverbs of Quantification\u201d (1975). Lewis\u2019s paper is\nabout the analysis of sentences containing adverbs such as\nalways, never, usually, often,\nseldom \u2026, sentences such as \u201cThe fog usually\nlifts before noon here\u201d and \u201cCaesar seldom awoke before\ndawn\u201d. After considering and rejecting some alternatives, Lewis\nintroduces \u201crestriction by if-clauses\u201d: he proposes that\nthere is a use of if-clauses whose function is to restrict the range\nof cases to which the operator or quantifier applies. First paraphrase\nthe sentences: \u201cUsually if there is fog here, it lifts before\nnoon.\u201d \u201cSeldom if Caesar awoke, it was before dawn.\u201d\n(Lewis\u2019s target sentences do not have \u201cif\u201d in their\nsurface structure, but they could have had: the theory also applies to\nsentences like \u201cUsually, if Mary visits, she brings her\ndog\u201d.) The \u201cif\u201d restricts the \u201cusually\u201d\nto the occurrences of fog here, or of Mary\u2019s visits, and the\n\u201cseldom\u201d to Caesar\u2019s awakenings. These sentences are\nnot to be construed as applying an adverb to a conditional\nproposition. The adverb applies to the main clause, its scope\nrestricted by the if-clause. Thus Lewis: \n\n[T]he if of our restrictive if-clauses should not be regarded\nas a sentence connective. It has no meaning apart from the adverb it\nrestricts. The if in always if \u2026,\nsometimes if \u2026, and the rest is on a par with the\nnon-connective and in between \u2026 and \u2026,\nwith the non-connective or in whether \u2026 or\n\u2026, or with the non-connective if in the\nprobability that \u2026 if. It serves merely to mark an\nargument-place in a polyadic construction. (Lewis 1975 reprinted in\nLewis 1998 pp. 14\u201315)\n\n\nLewis\u2019s final example is particularly interesting, especially\nbecause this paper was written at much the same time as his proof that\nconditional probabilities are not to be construed as probabilities of\nconditional propositions. \n\nLewis has three different accounts of \u201cif\u201d: he follows\nJackson in claiming that the \u201cif\u201d of indicative\nconditionals is the truth-functional \u201cif\u201d, with a special\nrule of assertability (see Lewis 1986 pp. 152\u20136); there is his\nfamous account of the \u201cif\u201d of counterfactual conditionals\n(Lewis 1973); and there is this use of \u201cif\u201d as a\nrestrictor. \n\nKratzer\u2019s idea is that this last account of \u201cif\u201d as\na restrictor should be applied to all conditionals. Consider first\nconditionals which contain a modal term: \u201cIf it\u2019s not in\nthe kitchen it must be in the bathroom/might be in the bathroom/is\nprobably in the bathroom\u201d. By analogy with Lewis, she argues\nthat these are not to be construed as attaching a modal term to a\nconditional proposition; rather, they are to be construed as attaching\na modal term to the main clause, the scope of the modal term being\nrestricted by the conditional clause. \n\nBut what of a simple conditional which does not contain a modal\noperator, such as \u201cIf it\u2019s not in the kitchen it is in the\nbathroom\u201d \u2014 what Kratzer calls the \u201cbare\nconditional\u201d? Here is her famous remark: \n\nThe history of the conditional is the history of a syntactic mistake.\nThere is no two-place if \u2026 then connective in the\nlogical forms of natural languages. If-clauses are devices\nfor restricting the domains of operators. Bare conditionals have\nunpronounced modal operators [my emphasis]. Epistemic\nMUST is one option. (Kratzer (1986), quoted from Kratzer\n(2012) p. 106)\n\n\nThere is much in common between the restrictor-view of conditionals\nand the suppositional view. A supposition also restricts one\u2019s\nclaim to the case in which the antecedent is true. The strength of\nyour conditional belief is measured by how probable you judge the\nconsequent, on the assumption that the antecedent is satisfied; and\nthis is not the same as thinking a conditional proposition is probably\ntrue. Recall Lewis\u2019s remark about \u201cthe probability that\n\u2026 if\u201d. Kratzer\u2019s treatment of modal conditionals\nmay be seen as a generalization to other modalities of this treatment\nof \u201cProbably, if \\(A, C\\)\u201d. \n\nHowever, Kratzer\u2019s treatment of the \u201cbare\nconditional\u201d is controversial: at the level of semantic\nstructure, there really are no such things \u2014 apparent bare\nconditionals contain an \u201cunpronounced modal operator\u201d. If\nthe modal operator is an epistemic \u201cmust\u201d, as she\nsuggests, bare conditionals are a species of strict conditional\n\u2014 something like \u201call live \\(A\\)-possibilities are\n\\(C\\)-possibilities\u201d. \n\nThis proposal has difficulty handling the fact that one may adopt\nepistemic attitudes to a conditional of varying degrees of closeness\nto certainty. I may be close to certain, but not completely certain,\nthat Jane will accept if she is offered the job, that if I have the\noperation I will be cured, etc. Not all the relevant\n\\(A\\)-possibilities are \\(C\\)-possibilities. On this proposal, in\nthese circumstances the conditionals are clearly, definitely false,\nand should be completely rejected, and hence not something one should\nbe close to certain of. This point holds for any kind of strict\nconditional \u2014 any kind of \u201cmust\u201d. Stalnaker (1981 p.\n100) made essentially the same point, about counterfactuals, comparing\nhis view with Lewis\u2019s. On a strict-conditional account, the\nfollowing exchange should be in order: \n\nA: Will Jane accept if she is offered the job?\n\nB: No, it is certainly not the case that she will accept if offered\nthe job [for not all offer-possibilities are accept-possibilities].\nBut she might well accept if she is offered the job.\n\n\nB\u2019s remark sounds contradictory.\n\nStalnaker (ibid.) attributes to Thomasson the closely related point:\n\n\nA: Will Jane accept if she is offered the job?\n\nB: I believe so, but she might not.\n\n\nAlthough B\u2019s reply seems sensible, it is defective on the\nstrict-conditional proposal: not all offer-possibilities are\naccept-possibilities. The conditional is clearly false. One should not\nbelieve something which one judges to be clearly false. \n\nKratzer will reply that \u201cI believe Jane will accept if she\noffers the job\u201d introduces a different modality: restricting\nattention to the offer-possibilities, I believe (but am not certain)\nthat she accepts. Nevertheless, she cannot allow that one can take\ndifferent epistemic attitudes to the same conditional thought. In this\nrespect her view differs from the Ramsey\u2013Adams approach, as well\nas the propositional view.\n\nNor would it do to make the unpronounced modal operator in bare\nconditionals \u201cprobably\u201d; for one can be certain that it is\nprobable that if \\(A, C\\), without being certain that if \\(A, C\\).\nThis point is made in more detail by Edgington (1995, pp.\n292\u20133). Thus, while the restrictor view has some plausibility,\nits treatment of the \u201cbare conditional\u201d as a modalised\nproposition is problematic. \n\nOther philosophers have also defended the view that indicative\nconditionals are context-dependent strict conditionals, without\nadopting Kratzer\u2019s restrictor view. According to Anthony Gillies\n(2009), a context determines a set of possibilities compatible with\nthe relevant information in the context. \u201cIf \\(A, C\\)\u201d is\ntrue at a context iff all relevant \\(A\\)-possibilities are\n\\(C\\)-possibilities, false otherwise. William Lycan (2001), similarly,\nclaims that \u201cIf \\(A, C\\)\u201d is true iff all real and\nrelevant \\(A\\)-events are \\(C\\)-events. Context-dependent strict\nconditionals are also defended by Daniel Rothschild (2013, 2015). The\ndifficulty mentioned above remains: on these accounts, a conditional\nmay be certainly false, yet probable. \n",
