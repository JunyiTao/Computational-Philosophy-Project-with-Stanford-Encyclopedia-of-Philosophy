Her celebrated garden contained many\nexotic trees and flowers considered difficult to cultivate in the\nParisian climate. Like other pet lovers, she rejected\nDescartes\u2019s theory of the animal as a soulless machine. Her\ndialogue History of Two Chameleons indicates her rejection of\nDescartes\u2019s mechanistic theory of nature in favor of a vitalist\naccount of nature which attributes emotions and even moral qualities\nto non-human animals. The dialogue reflects Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s own\nexperimentation on two chameleons imported from Alexandria and\nentrusted to her care.\n\nKnowledge of the chameleon is acquired by careful observation of its\nphysical features over time. Scud\u00e9ry is especially attentive to\nthe eyes of the chameleon, which pivot in a much wider range than that\npossible for human eyes. Experiments with different types of food\ngradually reveal the chameleon\u2019s eating habits. Careful\nobservation in different environments and lightings cannot resolve the\nquestion of the precise causes of the chameleon\u2019s changes of\ncolor but does yield surprising evidence that changes in temperature\nappear to effect substantial alterations in coloration. Months-long\nobservation leads Scud\u00e9ry to the conclusion that classification\nof the chameleon as a reptile is mistaken: \n\n\nIt is wrong to call [the chameleon] a reptile. Its stomach never\ntouches the earth, not even when it is walking or even sleeping. At\nthose times it rests on its feet and on its tail. [CN,\n2:503]\n\n\nFor Scud\u00e9ry, proper observation of nature is necessarily an\naesthetic observation. In her study of the chameleon, she often\nrecounts the animal\u2019s beauty. \u201cThis animal has a slow,\ngrave, and majestic walk\u201d [CN, 2: 503]. She repeatedly\nrecords the beauty of the varied spotting manifest by the chameleon.\n\n\n\nNearly everyday at several different moments, it had the most\nbeautiful spots in the world: from the top of its head to the end of\nits tail and to the bottom of its little fingers. [CN, 2: 513]\n\n\n\nThe chameleon also manifests emotional and moral qualities.\nScud\u00e9ry claims that her two chameleons showed a clear affection\nfor each other. \n\n\nDuring the five weeks I had the animals together, I noticed an intense\naffection between them. Neither ever showed the least chagrin.\n[CN, 2: 515] \n\n\nThe older chameleon even seems to possess moral as well as emotional\ntraits. Happiness appears to be maximal in midday. \n\n\nIt seems to me that when my chameleon had the best spotting was the\nmoment when he seemed the happiest and at is his best. This was\nusually midday from ten in the morning until three or four in the\nafternoon. [CN, 2: 528] \n\n\nSadness and even a certain sloth seem to characterize early morning.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw him the next day I found him very sad. Still, he heard me\nand recognized who I was, as he usually did. But I saw that he was\nvery lazy in his rising. [CN, 2: 532] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s interpretation of the natural world is not only\nempirical; it involves a sympathetic and aesthetic embrace of material\nnature. \n",
