    "main_text": "Hybrid Theory\n4. Hybrid Theory\n\nOne way to try to accommodate the various insights from the theories\nconsidered thus far is in the form of a hybrid theory. One such idea\nis:\n\nS is wise iff \nS has extensive factual and theoretical knowledge.\nS knows how to live well.\nS is successful at living well.\nS has very few unjustified beliefs.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this Hybrid Theory has a lot going for it, there are a number\nof important criticisms to consider.  Dennis Whitcomb (2010) objects\nto all theories of wisdom that include a living well condition, or an\nappreciation of living well condition. He gives several interesting\nobjections against such views. Whitcomb thinks that a person who is\ndeeply depressed and totally devoid of any ambition for living well\ncould nevertheless be wise.  As long as such a person is deeply\nknowledgeable about academic subjects and knows how to live well, that\nperson would have all they need for wisdom.  With respect to a very\nknowledgeable and deeply depressed person with no ambition but to stay\nin his room, he claims, \u201cIf I ran across such a person, I would\ntake his advice to heart, wish him a return to health, and leave the\ncontinuing search for sages to his less grateful advisees.  And I\nwould think he was wise despite his depression-induced failure to\nvalue or desire the good life.  So I think that wisdom does not\nrequire valuing or desiring the good life.\u201d \n\nIn response to Whitcomb\u2019s penetrating criticism, one could argue that\na deeply depressed person who is wise, would still live as well as she\ncan, and would still value living well, even if she falls far short of\nperfection.  Such a person would attempt to get help to deal with her\ndepression.  If she really does not care at all, she may be very\nknowledgeable, but she is not wise.  There is something irrational\nabout knowing how to live well and refusing to try to do so.  Such\nirrationality is not compatible with wisdom.  A person with this\ninternal conflict may be extremely clever and shrewd, one to listen to\non many issues, one to trust on many issues, and may even win a Nobel\nPrize for her intellectual greatness, but she is not admirable enough,\nand rationally consistent enough, to be wise.  Wisdom is a virtue and\na way of living, and it requires more than smart ideas and\nknowledge.\n\n\nAristotle held that \u201cit is evident that it is impossible to be\npractically wise without being good\u201d (Nicomachean\nEthics, 1144a, 36\u201337). Most of the philosophers mentioned\nthus far would include moral virtue in their understanding of what it\nmeans to live well.  However, Whitcomb challenges any theory of wisdom\nthat requires moral virtue. Whitcomb contends that a deeply evil\nperson could nevertheless be wise.\n\n\nAgain, it is important to contrast being wise from being clever and\nintelligent.  If we think of wisdom as the highest, or among the\nhighest, of human virtues, then it seems incompatible with a deeply\nevil personality. \n\n \nThere is, however, a very serious problem with the Hybrid Theory.\nSince so much of what was long ago considered knowledge has been\nabandoned, or has evolved, a theory that requires truth (through a\nknowledge condition) would exclude almost all people who are now long\ndead, including Hypatia, Socrates, Confucius, Aristotle, Homer, Lao\nTzu, etc. from the list of the wise.  Bad epistemic luck, and having\nlived in the past, should not count against being wise.  But, since\ntruth is a necessary condition for knowledge, bad epistemic luck is\nsufficient to undermine a claim to knowledge.  What matters, as far as\nbeing wise goes, is not that a wise person has knowledge, but that she\nhas highly justified and rational beliefs about a wide variety of\nsubjects, including how to live well, science, philosophy,\nmathematics, history, geography, art, literature, psychology, and so\non.  And the wider the variety of interesting topics, the better.\nAnother way of developing this same point is to imagine a person with\nhighly justified beliefs about a wide variety of subjects, but who is\nunaware that she is trapped in the Matrix, or some other skeptical\nscenario.  Such a person could be wise even if she is sorely lacking\nknowledge.  A theory of wisdom that focuses on having rational or\nepistemically justified beliefs, rather than the higher standard of\nactually having knowledge, would be more promising. Moreover, such a\ntheory would incorporate much of what is attractive about epistemic\nhumility, and epistemic accuracy, theories.\n",
