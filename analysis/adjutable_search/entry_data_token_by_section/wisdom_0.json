    "main_text": "Wisdom as Epistemic Humility\n1. Wisdom as Epistemic Humility\n\n \nSocrates\u2019 view of wisdom, as expressed by Plato in The\nApology (20e-23c), is sometimes interpreted as an example of a\nhumility theory of wisdom (see, for example, Ryan 1996 and Whitcomb,\n2010).  In Plato\u2019s\nApology, Socrates and his friend Chaerephon visit the oracle\nat Delphi.  As the story goes, Chaerephon asks the oracle whether\nanyone is wiser than Socrates. The oracle\u2019s answer is that Socrates is\nthe wisest person. Socrates reports that he is puzzled by this answer\nsince so many other people in the community are well known for their\nextensive knowledge and wisdom, and yet Socrates claims that he lacks\nknowledge and wisdom. Socrates does an investigation to get to the\nbottom of this puzzle. He interrogates a series of politicians, poets,\nand craftsmen. As one would expect, Socrates\u2019 investigation reveals\nthat those who claim to have knowledge either do not really know any\nof the things they claim to know, or else know far less than they\nproclaim to know. The most knowledgeable of the bunch, the craftsmen,\nknow about their craft, but they claim to know things far beyond the\nscope of their expertise.  Socrates, so we are told, neither suffers\nthe vice of claiming to know things he does not know, nor the vice of\nclaiming to have wisdom when he does not have wisdom. In this\nrevelation, we have a potential resolution to the wisdom puzzle\nin The Apology. \n\n \nAlthough the story may initially appear to deliver a clear theory of\nwisdom, it is actually quite difficult to capture a textually accurate\nand plausible theory here.  One interpretation is that Socrates is\nwise because he, unlike the others, believes he is not wise, whereas\nthe poets, politicians, and craftsmen arrogantly and falsely believe\nthey are wise. This theory, which will be labeled Humility Theory 1\n(H1), is simply (see, for example, Lehrer & Smith 1996, 3):\n\nHumility Theory 1 (H1):\nS is wise iff S believes s/he is not\n wise.\n\n \nThis is a tempting and popular interpretation because Socrates\ncertainly thinks he has shown that the epistemically arrogant poets,\npoliticians, and craftsmen lack wisdom. Moreover, Socrates claims that\nhe is not wise, and yet, if we trust the oracle, Socrates is actually\nwise. \n\n \nUpon careful inspection, (H1) is not a reasonable interpretation of\nSocrates\u2019 view. Although Socrates does not\nboast of his own wisdom, he does believe the oracle. If he\nwas convinced that he was not wise, he would have rejected the oracle\nand gone about his business because he\nwould not find any puzzle to unravel.  Clearly, he believes, on\nsome level, that he is wise. The mystery is: what is wisdom if he has\nit and the others lack it?   Socrates nowhere suggests that\nhe has become unwise after believing the oracle. Thus, (H1) is not an\nacceptable interpretation of Socrates\u2019 view.\n\n \nMoreover, (H1) is false. Many people are clear counterexamples to\n(H1). Many people who believe they are not wise are correct in their\nself-assessment. Thus, the belief that one is not wise is not a\nsufficient condition for wisdom. Furthermore, it seems that the belief\nthat one is not wise is not necessary for wisdom. It seems plausible\nto think that a wise person could be wise enough to realize that she\nis wise. Too much modesty might get in the way of making good\ndecisions and sharing what one knows.  If one thinks Socrates was a\nwise person, and if one accepts that Socrates did, in fact, accept\nthat he was wise, then Socrates himself is a counterexample to\n(H1). The belief that one is wise could be a perfectly well justified\nbelief for a wise person. Having the belief that one is wise does not,\nin itself, eliminate the possibility that the person is wise. Nor does\nit guarantee the vice of arrogance. We should hope that a wise person\nwould have a healthy dose of epistemic self-confidence, appreciate\nthat she is wise, and share her understanding of reality with the rest\nof us who could benefit from her wisdom. Thus, the belief that\none is not wise is not required for wisdom.\n\n \n(H1) focused on believing one is not wise. Another version of the\nhumility theory is worth considering.  When Socrates demonstrates that\na person is not wise, he does so by showing that the person lacks some\nknowledge that he or she claims to possess.  Thus, one might think\nthat Socrates\u2019 view could be better captured by focusing on the idea\nthat wise people believe they lack knowledge (rather than lacking\nwisdom). That is, one might consider the following view:\n\nHumility Theory 2 (H2):\nS is wise iff S believes S does not know\nanything.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this interpretation is not any better than (H1). It\nfalls prey to problems similar to those that refuted (H1) both as an\ninterpretation of Socrates, and as an acceptable account of\nwisdom. Moreover, remember that Socrates admits that the craftsmen do\nhave some knowledge. Socrates might have considered them to be wise if\nthey had restricted their confidence and claims to knowledge to what\nthey actually did know about their craft. Their problem was that they\nprofessed to have knowledge beyond their area of expertise. The\nproblem was not that they claimed to have knowledge. \n\n\nBefore turning to alternative approaches to wisdom, it is worth\nmentioning another interpretation of Socrates that fits with the\ngeneral spirit of epistemic humility.  One might think that what\nSocrates is establishing is that his wisdom is found in his\nrealization that human wisdom is not a particularly valuable kind of\nwisdom.  Only the gods possess the kind of wisdom that is truly\nvaluable. This is clearly one of Socrates\u2019 insights, but it does not\nprovide us with an understanding of the nature of wisdom. It tells us\nonly of its comparative value.  Merely understanding this evaluative\ninsight would not, for reasons similar to those discussed with (HP1)\nand (HP2), make one wise.\n\nHumility theories of wisdom are not promising, but they do, perhaps,\nprovide us with some important character traits associated with wise\npeople. Wise people, one might argue, possess epistemic\nself-confidence, yet lack epistemic arrogance. Wise people tend to\nacknowledge their fallibility, and wise people are reflective,\nintrospective, and tolerant of uncertainty.  Any acceptable theory of\nwisdom ought to be compatible with such traits.  However, those traits\nare not, in and of themselves, definitive of wisdom. \n",
