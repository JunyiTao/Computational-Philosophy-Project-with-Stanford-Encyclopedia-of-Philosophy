    "main_text": "The Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n2. The Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n\n\nRick is a politically engaged citizen who intends to vote in a\nreferendum on a measure that would criminalize homosexual\nrelations. As he evaluates the relevant considerations, he concludes\nthat the only persuasive rationale for that measure includes as a\ncrucial premise the claim that homosexual relations are contrary to a\nGod-established natural order. Although he finds that rationale\ncompelling, he realizes that many others do not. But because he takes\nhimself to have a general moral obligation to make those political\ndecisions that, as best he can tell, are both just and good, he\ndecides to vote in favor of criminalization. Moreover, he tries to\npersuade his compatriots to vote with him. In so doing, he offers\nrelevantly different arguments to different audiences. He tries to\nconvince like-minded citizens by appealing to the theistic natural law\nargument that he finds persuasive.  But he realizes that many of his\nfellow citizens are unpersuaded by the natural law argument that\nconvinces him. So he articulates a variety of other\narguments\u2014some secular, some religious\u2014that he hopes will\nleverage those who don't share his natural law theism into supporting\nhis position. He does so even though he doubts that any of those\nleveraging arguments are cogent, realizes that many of those to whom\nhe addresses them will have comparable doubts about their cogency, and\nso believes that many coerced by the law he supports have no good\nreason, from their perspective, to affirm that law.\n\n\n Advocates of the standard view will\nbe troubled by Rick's behavior. The relevantly troubling feature\nof Rick's behavior is not primarily his decision to support this\nparticular policy. Rather, it is his decision to support a policy\nthat he believes others have no good reason, from their perspective, to\nendorse. After all, Rick votes to enact a law that authorizes state coercion even\nthough he believes that the only plausible rationale for that decision\nincludes religious claims that many of his compatriots find utterly\nunpersuasive. In so doing, Rick violates a normative constraint\nat the heart of the standard view, viz., that citizens in a pluralistic\nliberal democracy ought to refrain from using their political influence\nto authorize coercive laws that, to the best of their knowledge, can be\njustified only on religious grounds and so lack a plausible\nsecular\n rationale.[4]\nOr, otherwise put, Rick violates the DRR. For the DRR tells us\nthat, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she should\nsupport some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for that law, then she may not support\nit.\n\n\n The DRR is a negative constraint; it\nidentifies a kind of reason that cannot itself justify a coercive law\nand so a kind of reason on which citizens may not exclusively rely when\nsupporting a coercive law. But this negative constraint is typically conjoined with a\npermission: although citizens may not support coercive laws for which\nthey believe themselves to have only a religious rationale, they may\nsupport coercive laws for which they believe there is only a plausible\nsecular rationale. As we'll see in a moment, advocates of the DRR\nfurnish reasons to believe that religious and secular reasons have this\nasymmetrical justificatory role.\n",
