The most commonly recognized distinction here,\nin the recent literature, is that between evolutionary and\nphysiological (or metabolic) individuals (Pradeu\n2016a, 2016b).\n\nProminent in contemporary thinking about evolutionary individuals is\nthe work of Peter Godfrey-Smith on what he calls Darwinian\nindividuals. On the view of evolution and natural selection he\ndefends in Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection\n(2009), what evolves are \u201cDarwinian populations\u201d,\ncollections of things in which at least three conditions hold: there\nis variation in the traits had by things in the collection,\nthose traits are heritable within the collection, and some\nvariants of the traits confer reproductive advantage on the things\nthat bear them. In such a Darwinian population, the members are\nDarwinian individuals, which are both bearers and active reproducers\nof heritable traits (see Godfrey-Smith 2013: 19\u201320). \n\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s approach to evolutionary individuals is intended\nto contrast with the earlier replicator-based views developed by\nRichard Dawkins and others. Replicator views have been central to\ndiscussions of the levels and units of selection (Godfrey-Smith 2015;\nSober & Wilson 1994, 1998; Okasha 2006), and derivatively so to\nviews of biological individuals. Here genes are paradigmatic\nreplicators, being housed in interactors, such as organisms,\nand it is the survival of these replicators that matters in evolution.\nThe replicator framework emphasizes the importance for natural\nselection of high-fidelity copying across generations. By contrast,\nwhat matters for natural selection in Godfrey-Smith\u2019s view is\nthe establishment of parent-offspring lineages that feature\nheritability, as well as the variety of forms that reproduction can\ntake in the establishment and stabilization of those lineages. \n\nThis shift from replication to the process of reproduction in accounts\nof biological individuals has a longer history, particularly amongst\nthose sensitive to the relationships between evolution and\ndevelopment. For example, James Griesemer (2000) has argued that\nbiological reproduction involves fission and fusion requiring what he\ncalls progeneration, a process that creates new entities\nthrough material overlap, and that that process is a crucial\nfeature of how living agents evolve.\n Section 6\n takes up this issue in more detail in discussing reproduction, life\ncycles, and lineages.\n\nWhichever way evolutionary individuals are conceptualized, they do not\nexhaust the realm of biological individuals any more than do\norganisms. The general point here is that although evolution is\nfoundational when thinking about interactors and Darwinian\nindividuals, it does not play this role for all kinds of biological\nindividual, as Godfrey-Smith himself recognizes. Indeed, Godfrey-Smith\n(2013) strikingly (and controversially) proposes that even some\norganisms, understood from a metabolic point of view, are not\nDarwinian individuals at all. These are a subset of corporate\norganisms, multi-species organisms formed through symbiotic\nrelationships between members of different species. Here Godfrey-Smith\nposits the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and the\nVibrio bacteria they contain as an example (see also Nyholm &\nMcFall-Ngai 2004; Bouchard 2010). Since the squid-Vibrio corporate\norganism does not itself form the right kinds of parent-offspring\nlineages it is not a Darwinian individual, differing in this respect\nwith other often-discussed corporate organisms, such as\naphid-Buchnera complexes (Andersson 2000):\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Godfrey-Smith\u2019s\nDifferent Biological Individuals.\n\n(Copied from Figure 4 of Godfrey-Smith 2013.)\n\n[An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhatever one says about the intricacies of such examples, in addition\nto individuals delineated by evolutionary criteria there are also what\nThomas Pradeu calls physiological individuals. These are\nbiological individuals individuated by appeal to criteria such as\nhaving a metabolism and being governed by internal control mechanisms\nof various kinds. For Pradeu, each physiological individual is\n\u201ca functionally integrated and cohesive metabolic whole, made of\ninterdependent and interconnected parts\u201d (Pradeu 2016b: 807; see\nalso Godfrey-Smith 2009: 71). \n\nAs Pradeu notes (2016b: 799\u2013802), there is a long tradition in\nthe physiological sciences of addressing the Focal Question by asking\nwhat it is that makes for unity of functioning in biological\nindividuals: \n\n\nto ask how distinct and heterogeneous components interact and\nconstitute a cohesive whole, functioning collectively as a regulated\nunit that persists through time. (2016b: 800) \n\n\nAlthough there is typically a nod paid to physiological individuals in\nearly influential discussions of biological individuals in the short\nhistory of the topic (e.g., Sober 1991, Hull 1992, Dawkins 1989:\nch.13), the bulk of this literature has focused until very recently on\nevolutionary individuals. Pradeu\u2019s reminder of the long past of\nthe Focal Question, and the prominence of physiological individuals in\nit, is a welcome redress to the resulting skew of attention.\n\nIn addition to this general point, Pradeu has also defended the view\nthat an organism is a particular kind of physiological individual,\nbeing \n\n\na functionally integrated whole composed of heterogeneous components\nthat are locally interconnected by strong biochemical interactions and\ncontrolled by constant systemic immune interactions of a constant\naverage intensity. (Pradeu 2012: 244) \n\n\nHere Pradeu builds on a particular view of immunology developed in his\nThe Limits of the Self that moves beyond the theory\nassociated with Frank Burnet, the self-nonself theory. In its place,\nPradeu offers a general account of immunogenicity that applies across\na wide range of phlya, ignoring the exogenous or endogenous origin of\nantigens in favor of a criterion that emphasizes immune-tolerance and\nacceptance.\n\nPradeu takes the boundary established and maintained by the immune\nsystem as the boundary of the organism. On Pradeu\u2019s\nview, organisms are inherently heterogeneous, given the collaborative\nnature of the microbial and macrobial worlds articulated in\nMicrobialism. To put it slightly differently, the true organisms\ndelineated by Pradeu\u2019s immunity criterion are holobionts\nconstituted by a macrobial organism and all and only those microbes at\nleast tolerated by its immune system. This criterion provides a way to\nindividuate organisms as holobionts, and the resulting view\nconstitutes one way to constructively respond to the challenges of\nMicrobialism and Eliminativism. Whether holobionts are best thought of\nas organisms or evolutionary individuals at all (Skillings 2016), or\nwhether Pradeu\u2019s view in particular can resolve the putative\n\u201ctension in seeing symbionts as both organisms themselves and\nalso parts of larger organisms\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2016c: 782),\nremain live issues.\n\nSo minimally there are evolutionary individuals and there are\nphysiological individuals, and organisms are typically thought of as\nexemplars of (but not strictly identical to) both.\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s articulation of evolutionary individuals as\nDarwinian individuals has structured much recent and ongoing\ndiscussion, and Pradeu\u2019s emphasis on physiological individuals\nand his appeal to immunology as a source for ideas about organisms and\nbiological individuals more generally has garnered recent attention.\nThese responses to Distinctions also facilitate rich responses to our\nremaining subsidiary question, Conceptual Space: What is the most\ninformative way to articulate the conceptual space surrounding the\nconcept of biological individuals? \n",
