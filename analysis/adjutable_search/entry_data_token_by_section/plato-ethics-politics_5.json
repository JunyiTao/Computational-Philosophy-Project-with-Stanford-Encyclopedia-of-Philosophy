    "main_text": "Ethics, Part One: What Justice Is || Perfectly Virtuous Motivations\n2.3 Perfectly Virtuous Motivations\n\n\nIn Book Four Socrates says that the just person is wise and thus knows\nwhat is good for him, but he does not say anything about what\nknowledge or the good is. In Books Five through Seven he clearly\naddresses these issues and fills out his account of virtue. He shows,\nin sum, that one is virtuous if and only if one is a philosopher, for\nhe adds to Book Four\u2019s insistence that virtue requires knowledge the\nnew claim that only philosophers have knowledge (esp. 474b\u2013480a). His\naccount also opens the possibility that knowledge of the good provides\nthe crucial link between psychological justice and just actions.\n\n\nThe philosophers are initially distinguished from non-philosophers \nbecause they answer questions like \u2018What is beautiful?\u2019 \nby identifying the imperceptible property (form) of beauty instead of \nsome perceptible property or particulars (474b\u2013480a). Socrates does not \nname any philosophers who can knowledgeably answer questions like \nthat. In fact, his account of how philosophers would be educated in \nthe ideal city suggests that the ability to give knowledgeable \nanswers requires an enormous amount of (largely mathematical) \nlearning in advance of the questions themselves (521b\u2013540a). How \nwould this mathematical learning and knowledge of forms affect one\u2019s \nmotivations?\n\n\nOne effect can be found by interpreting the form of the good that the\nphilosopher comes to grasp, since this should shape the philosopher\u2019s\nrational conception of what is good for her. The form of the good is \na shadowy presence in the Republic, lurking behind the images\nof the Sun, Line, and Cave. But it is clear enough that Socrates \ntakes goodness to be unity (Hitchcock 1985). He explicitly emphasizes that a virtuous \nperson makes himself a unity (443c\u2013e) and insists that a city is made\ngood by being made a unity (462a\u2013b). The assumption that goodness is \nunity also explains why mathematics is so important to the ascent to \nthe good (through mathematics an account of the one over the many is \nlearned) (cf. Burnyeat 2000), why the good is superior to other forms (the good is the \nunity or coherence of them, and not another alongside them), why the \nother forms are good (by being part of the unified or coherent \norder), and why goodness secures the intelligibility of the other \nforms (they are fully known teleologically). (It also comports with \nthe evidence concerning Plato\u2019s lecture on the good (e.g., \nAristoxenus, Elementa Harmonica II 1; cf. Aristotle \nEudemian Ethics 1218a20 and Metaphysics 988a8\u201316 \nand b10\u201315.) So the philosophers, by grasping the form of the good, \nwill recognize goodness in themselves as the unity in their souls. \nThey will see that the harmony or coherence of their psychological \nattitudes makes them good, that each of their attitudes is good \ninsofar as it is part of a coherent set, and that their actions are \ngood insofar as they sustain the unity in their souls (cf. 443e).\n\n\nBut there are other ways in which mathematical learning and knowledge\nof forms might affect one\u2019s motivations. Socrates suggests one way \nwhen he says that a philosopher will aspire to imitate the harmony \namong the forms (500b\u2013d). Some scholars have understood Socrates to \nbe saying that philosophers will desire to reproduce this order by \ncultivating more order and virtue in the world, as Diotima suggests \nin the Symposium (Irwin 1995, 298\u2013317; cf. Waterlow 1972\u20131973, Cooper 1977, Kraut 1991). On this reading, knowledge of the forms \nmotivates just actions that help other people, which helps to solve \nthe standing worry about the relation between psychological justice \nand practical justice.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is far from obvious that this is what Socrates\nmeans. He does not actually say in the Republic that\nknowledge of the forms freely motivates beneficence. In fact, he says\neight times that the philosophers in the ideal city will have to be\ncompelled to rule and do their part in sustaining the perfectly just\ncity (473d4, 500d4, 519e4, 520a8, 520e2, 521b7, 539e3, 540b5). It is\npossible to understand this compulsion as the constraint of justice:\nthe philosophers rule because justice demands that they rule. But\nSocrates himself suggests a different way of characterizing the\ncompulsion. He suggests that the compulsion comes from a law that requires those\nwho are educated to be philosophers to rule. Moreover, this\ncharacterization better fits Socrates\u2019 insistence that the\nphilosophers are the best rulers because they prefer not to rule even\nwhile they are ruling (520e\u2013521b, with 519c and 540b). For on this\naccount, the philosophers\u2019 justice alone does not motivate them to\nrule; rather, their justice motivates them to obey the law, which\njustly compels them to rule (E. Brown 2000).\n\n\nThere is another reason to worry about explaining just actions by the\nmotivating power of knowledge. If the philosophers are motivated to \ndo what is just by their knowledge of the forms, then there would \nseem to be an enormous gap between philosophers and non-philosophers.\nIn addition to the epistemic gap\u2014the philosophers have \nknowledge and the non-philosophers do not\u2014we have a \nmotivational gap: the philosophers\u2019 knowledge gives them motivations \nto do what is required by justice, and the non-philosophers are not \nsimilarly motivated. This gap suggests some rather unpalatable \nconclusions about the character of non-philosophers\u2019 lives even in \nthe ideal city, and it also sits poorly with Socrates\u2019 evident desire\nto take the philosophers\u2019 justice as a paradigm that can be usefully \napproximated by non-philosophers (472c\u2013d).\n",
