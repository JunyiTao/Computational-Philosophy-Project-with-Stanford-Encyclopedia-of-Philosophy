G. E. Moore (1903: \u00a718) noted that we can make a\ndistinction between things that are good in themselves, or possess\nintrinsic value, and those that are good as a means to other things.\nTo this day there is still much debate over whether this distinction\ncan be sustained (Feldman 1998, Kagan 1998), and, if it can, which\nkinds of things possess intrinsic value (Krebs 1999). In particular,\none of the central topics in contemporary environmental ethics is the\nquestion of which kinds of things (intelligent beings, conscious\nbeings, living things, species, etc) might have intrinsic value. While\nthis is the oldest (and still most common) use of the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction in philosophy, it has not played much\nrole in the discussions of the distinction in metaphysics, to which we\nnow turn.\n\nAs P. T. Geach (1969) noted, the fact that some object \\(a\\) is not\n\\(F\\) before an event occurs but is \\(F\\) after that event occurs does\nnot mean that the event constitutes, in any deep sense, a change in\n\\(a\\). To use a well-worn example, at the time of Socrates\u2019s\ndeath Xanthippe became a widow; that is, she was not a widow before\nthe event of her husband\u2019s death, but she was a widow when it\nended. Still, though that event constituted (or perhaps was\nconstituted by) a change in Socrates, it did not in itself constitute\na change in Xanthippe. Geach noted that we can distinguish between\nreal changes, such as what occurs in Socrates when he dies, from mere\nchanges in which predicates one satisfies, such as what occurs in\nXanthippe when Socrates dies. The latter he termed \u2018mere\nCambridge\u2019 change. There is something of a consensus that an\nobject undergoes real change in an event iff there is some\nintrinsic property it instantiated before the event\nbut not afterwards.\n\nDavid Lewis (1986a, 1988) built on this point of Geach\u2019s to\nmount an attack on endurantism, the theory that\nobjects persist by being wholly located at different times, and that\nthere can be strict identity between an object existing at one time\nand one existing at another time. Lewis argues that this is\ninconsistent with the idea that objects undergo real change. If the\nvery same object can be both \\(F\\) (at one time) and not \\(F\\) (at\nanother), this means that \\(F\\)-ness must be a relation to a time, but\nthis means that it is not an intrinsic property. So any property that\nan object can change must be extrinsic, so nothing undergoes real\nchange. Lewis says that this argument supports the rival theory of\nperdurantism, which says that objects persist by\nhaving different temporal parts at different times. While this\nargument is controversial (see Haslanger (1989), Johnston (1987) and\nLowe (1988) for some responses), it does show how considerations about\nintrinsicality can resonate within quite different areas of\nmetaphysics.\n\nA third major area where the concept of intrinsicality has been put to\nwork is in stating various supervenience theses. Frank Jackson (1998)\ndefines physicalism in terms of duplication and physical duplication,\nwhich are in turn defined in terms of intrinsic properties. Similarly,\nJaegwon Kim (1982) defines a mind/body supervenience thesis in terms\nof intrinsic properties. As Theodore Sider (1993) notes, the simplest\nway to define the individualist theory of mental\ncontent that Tyler Burge (1979) attacks is as the claim that the\ncontent of a thinker\u2019s propositional attitudes supervenes on the\nintrinsic properties of the thinker. And many\ninternalist theories in epistemology are based around\nthe intuition that whether a thinker is justified in believing some\nproposition supervenes on the intrinsic properties of the thinker.\n\nA fourth area where the concept of intrinsically has been employed is\nto state recombination principles intended to describe what possible\nstates of the world there are. (See Lewis 1986a.) An initial attempt\nto state such a principle might be (R1), where \\(x\\) is wholly\ndistinct from \\(y\\) iff \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no parts in common. (As\nis standard in philosophical usage, each thing is counted as a part of\nitself. Hence, things are not wholly distinct from themselves.)\n\n(R1)\nFor any properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) , it is possible that there are\ntwo wholly distinct things, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), such that \\(x\\) has \\(p\\)\nand \\(y\\) has \\(q\\). \n\n\nGiven an abundant theory of properties according to which each\n(non-defective) predicate expresses a property, however, (R1) clearly\nfails, since it isn\u2019t possible for there to be an \\(x\\) and a\n\\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) has the property of being made of gold, and\n\\(y\\) has the property of being such that nothing is made of gold.\nThis defect with (R1) can be fixed by replacing (R1) with (R2).\n\n(R2)\nFor any intrinsic properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), it is\npossible that there are two wholly distinct things, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nsuch that \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) and \\(y\\) has \\(q\\). \n\n\nWhile being made of gold and being such that nothing is made of gold\nrefute (R1), they don\u2019t refute (R2), since being such that\nnothing is made of gold is clearly non-intrinsic.\n\nIn addition to the above four applications of the distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic properties, the distinction has also been\nemployed for many other purposes. For example, it has been used to\nformulate principles of universalizability for moral principles and\nmoral laws (Rabinowicz 1979), formulate a requirement on an\nexplanation being a good explanation, namely that it be an intrinsic\nexplanation (Field 1980, Maya 2014), and formulate a non-trivial\nversion of Mill\u2019s principle of the uniformity of nature\n(Schlesinger 1990). The distinction (or distinctions definable in\nterms of it) has also been used to argue against the magical ersatz\ntheory of possible worlds (Lewis 1986a, Sect. 3.4), defend the\ntransitivity of causation (Hall 2000, Hall 2004), defend the modal\ntheory of essence (Denby 2014), argue for the immanent theory of\nproperties (Audi 2019), and argue against the thesis that determinable\nfacts are always soley grounded by determinate facts (Shumener\n2022).\n\nMost of the philosophical applications of intrinsicality are\nindependent of its precise analysis. Work on its analysis, however,\nhas helped clarify these applications by allowing us to distinguish\nbetween different notions of intrinsicality and different notions in\nthe vicinity of intrinsicality, and by giving us a greater\nunderstanding of these various notions and of what properties satisfy\nthem. A good example of the latter kind of advance is Theodore\nSider\u2019s (2003) observation that most of the properties in folk\ntheory are \u2018maximal\u2019 and hence not intrinsic properties.\nThis observation provides a strong argument against various theories\nthat appeal to the intuitive intrinsicality of some everyday\nproperty.\n",
