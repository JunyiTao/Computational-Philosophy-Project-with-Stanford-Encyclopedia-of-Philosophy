    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Entities\n3.1 Moral Entities\n\nPufendorf begins DJN by noting the relative inattention to moral\nentities as such in comparison to the much-studied objects of the\nphysical sciences, even though \u201cit greatly behooves man to know\nthe nature of such entities, which he has received the faculty to\nproduce, and whose power deeply suffuses itself throughout his\nlife\u201d (I.1.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 99). He calls them\n\u201cmodes\u201d \u2013 in accord with their dependence on\nself-subsistent entities (cf. Forde 2011, on Lockean \u201cmixed\nmodes\u201d) \u2013 and says that they are invented\n(inventis) by reflective beings who, by comparing things,\nform certain notions \u201csuperadded\u201d to or\n\u201cimposed\u201d on the world in order to direct or temper free\nand voluntary human acts. (DJN I.1.2\u20133) Some moral entities are\nsaid to \u201cflow naturally from things themselves, as it were,\nwhile others are superadded to physical things \u2026 by an\nintelligent power\u201d (DJN I.1.3; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 100). This is\na relative distinction within Pufendorf\u2019s general voluntarist\nframework, where God is thought to impose a basic normative dimension\non the world (conjointly and compatibly with its creation), but where\nhumans in fact devise the (further) distinctions that regulate their\nlives together \u2013 both in philosophizing about these and by\nenacting concrete practices and institutions to regulate them.\nAccordingly, one might describe the former as foundational or\nstructural categories, and the latter as subsidiary, instrumental, or\ndiscretionary tools of analysis. All moral entities, however, of\nwhatever type, depend for their existence on the will of intelligent\nbeings who externally assign normative, action-directing significance\nto things intrinsically lacking this, but nonetheless somehow\ncompatible with or receptive to it.\n\nThere are four types of moral entities, says Pufendorf, analogous to\ncategories applied to physical things: (1) states or conditions\n(status), (2) substances (specifically, persons), and modes\nin a more specific sense \u2013 namely, (3) moral qualities\n(affective/effective modes) and (4) moral quantities (estimative\nmodes). As in the physical realm, moral \u2018states\u2019 designate\na kind of (moral-legal) space in which persons (like bodies) operate\nand orient themselves; they are sub-posed by the latter even though\nthey also, in a sense, depend on them for their existence. Pufendorf\ndistinguishes two such states, natural and adventitious, the former\nreferring to the natural state occupied by all humans as such (thus,\nthe \u201cstate of humanity\u201d), and the latter to the special\nconditions, institutions, or standing (e.g., commercial, marital,\ncivil) that differentially accompany it, in being created by and\nimposed on particular sorts of persons. Personhood or moral\nsubstantiality refers in turn to the various roles or agencies that\nhumans play or assume in such contexts, either simply as individuals,\nor as composites or collectives, and either on their own behalf or for\nothers (e.g., sovereigns, ambassadors). Since we typically enact\nmultiple, overlapping moral personae, it is possible for these to\nconflict, not only in the case of individuals but also collectives\nlike economic associations, religious groups, and political entities\nlike states, empires, or confederations. It is therefore important to\narticulate the respective obligations and rights of (different kinds\nof) persons, and to assess and rank them in terms of their relative\nmoral importance.\n\nSuch distinctions require the use of moral qualities and quantities,\nwhich are respectively affective and estimative modes. The latter\ninvolve the valuation of persons, things, or actions in terms of their\nsocial status or esteem, their price (economic value), or their desert\n(as in punishment and reward) \u2013 all of which are inexact,\ncomparative, and subject to alteration or adjustment (i.e., moral\nimposition is an ongoing process) (Seidler 2018). Moral qualities, in turn, affect\n(have an effect on) persons and are either formal (e.g., titles) or\noperative, with the latter subdivided into passive and active\nvarieties. Passive operative qualities enable someone \u201crightly\nto have, suffer, admit, or receive something\u201d (DJN I.1.20),\nwhile active operative qualities are those by which we can morally\naffect or move others, as it were. (See Auer 2008, for an association\nwith Hohfeld.) They are divided into the more familiar notions of\npower/authority (potestas), obligation (obligatio),\nand right (ius) \u2013 which constitute the moral dynamics\nof social life. All such notions or entities, it is important to keep\nin mind, are imposed or assigned rather than given or found; the\nscheme is fundamentally \u2018positivistic\u2019.\n\nThe inherited term \u2018right\u2019 (ius) is ambiguous,\nsays Pufendorf, and it sometimes stands for law (lex). Though\nit may also be classed as a passive moral quality (as in allowing\nsomeone rightly [recte] to receive things), it is active\ninsofar as it permits us to command persons and possess things. It is\nsimilar, in the latter respect, to power or authority\n(potestas), which is subdivided into four types depending on\nwhether it is wielded over persons or things \u2013 either\none\u2019s own or those of others. Authority over one\u2019s own\nperson and actions is freedom (libertas), and over those of\nothers sovereignty (imperium); moral power over one\u2019s\nown things is ownership or dominion (dominium), and over\nthose of others lordship (servitus). Each kind of power may\nbe acquired, lost, or held in certain ways: for example, the efficacy\nor strength of authority may be \u2018perfect\u2019 (complete,\nexceptionless, enforceable) or \u2018imperfect\u2019 (limited,\nflexible, merely hortatory or desirable), as may the force of rights;\nand the rest of DJN is essentially an account of how this occurs in\nthe different areas (spaces, or states) of life. The influence of\nPufendorf\u2019s distinctions and their exhaustive application to\nparticular life sectors was enormous, creating the basic scaffolding\nof modern moral discourse.
