    "main_text": "Nei-wai \u5167\u5916 and Gendered Differentiation || Traversing the Nei-Wai Boundary: The Case of Ban Zhao\n3.3 Traversing the Nei-Wai Boundary: The Case of Ban Zhao\n\nBan Zhao (c. 45\u2013117 CE) was the first and foremost Confucian\nwoman scholar-official\u2014one of the few exceptions where women\nwere able to have remarkable achievements in the wai\ncomparable to their male counterparts, despite the structural\nlimitations of nei. Ban Zhao came from a long line of erudite\nfamilies: both of her great-great-grandfather and great-grandfather\nheld imperial scholarly degrees; her grandfather and great-uncle were\ncourt scholar-officials, and so were her father and eldest brother;\nher second brother was a famed frontier governor-general granted the\nrank of marquis and her son was also a court official granted the rank\nof marquis. Lastly, her great aunt, her mother, her younger\nsister-in-law, and her daughter-in-law were equally erudite. Ban Zhao\nwas given an advanced education immersed in classical learning by both\nof her father and mother, and after the death of her eldest brother,\nshe was summoned by Emperor He (r. 89\u2013105 CE)\u2014though\nwithout the official title\u2014to complete the imperial account of\nthe History of Han. Serving as a de facto grand\nimperial scholar, Ban Zhao was in charge of the instruction of not\nonly the palace women and princesses, but also her ten male colleagues\nin the imperial library, including Ma Rong who later became a famed\nscholar as well as his brother Ma Xu (Swann 1932 [2001: 17]). After\nthe emperor\u2019s death, Ban Zhao also served as a close advisor to\nEmpress Dowager Deng (r. 106\u2013121 CE) who was then the de\nfacto ruler since the reigning emperor was still an infant (Swann\n1932 [2001: 43]; Pang-White 2018: 32). No other virtuous and talented\nwoman outside the royal family had managed to achieve the same\nposition ever since.\n\nBeyond the political, the pristine preservation of Ban Zhao\u2019s\nAdmonition for Women (Nujie; c.106 CE) is equally\nimpressive, considering the scarcity of women\u2019s records in\nantiquity. Furthermore, this treatise despite its overall conservative\nbent, is probably the earliest extant text in human history advocating\nfor equal education for women (Swann 1932 [2001: xvii]). Ban\nZhao\u2019s advocacy for women\u2019s education, in turn, provided a\nhistorical precedent and a much needed justification for virtuous and\ntalented women to engage in classical learning that was ritually\nreserved for men. Indeed, for many subsequent generations of women\nfrom empresses to widowed commoners, Ban Zhao held the esteemed\nposition as the first teacher for women as Confucius was for men\n(Swann 1932 [2001]; Pang-White 2018).\n\nAs remarkable as it was, Ban Zhao\u2019s ascendancy in the realm of\nwai was first and foremost made possible through her familial\nluck, not through the socially sanctioned venues available to many men\nof talents. Being born into a long line of erudite families that could\nspare precious resources to educate her for no apparent social\nutility, and being widowed at a young age allowed Ban Zhao to\nvirtually live a life of letters and governance as her male\ncounterparts did. Without such familial luck, it would be unthinkable\nfor women to leave a mark in the realm of wai without\nincurring significant social costs. This is one of the many inevitable\nfallouts from the nei-wai gender marking that generates\nstructural impediments for women to leave their marks in the realm of\nliterary culture and state governance.\n\nThe outward expansion of one\u2019s virtuous influences in a\nconcentric fashion from self, family, state, to the world at large in\norder to bring about the idyllic state of \u201cgreat harmony\u201d\n(datong \u5927\u540c) is the highest spiritual goal of\nConfucianism (Liji, \u201cLiyun\u201d chapter).\nAfter all, Confucius spent decades leaving his family behind and\nrisking his own life instructing rulers and disciples alike all in an\neffort to moralize the world around him beyond his own family. Being\nthus confined to the realm of nei, denied all non-familial\nroles, and deprived of all normative routes to operate and excel in\nliterary culture and state governance, a woman\u2019s moral\npersonhood, thus construed, is essentially curtailed and dependent on\nthe men of her kin.\n",
