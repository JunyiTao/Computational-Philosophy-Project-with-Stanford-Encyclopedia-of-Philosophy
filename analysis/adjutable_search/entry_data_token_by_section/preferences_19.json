In typical\ncases, values decrease with time. For instance, most of us would\nprefer receiving a large sum of money now to receiving it five years\nlater. Analytically, this temporal factor of evaluations is often\nseparated from time-independent factors of evaluations.\n\nThe standard approach to this issue in economic analysis treats\npreference as based on value. Value is dealt with in a bifactorial\nmodel, in which the value of a future good is assumed to be equal to\nthe product of two factors. One of these factors is a time-independent\nevaluation of the good in question, i.e. the value of obtaining it\nimmediately. The other factor represents the subject\u2019s pure time\npreferences. It is a function of the length of the delay, and is the\nsame for all types of goods. The most common type of time preference\nfunction can be written\n\n\\[\nv(A,t) = \\frac{v(A,t_0)}{(1 + r)^{t-t_0}}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is a discount rate and \\(t-t_0\\) the duration of the\ndelay. This is the exponetentially discounted utility model (DU), proposed by\nSamuelson (1937), which still dominates in economic analysis.\n\nThe choice of a discount rate can have a large impact on the\ncalculated values. It is therefore often politically controversial. As\none example of this, the discount rate used in assessing the economic\neffects of climate change can have significant consequences for the\npolicy recommendations that are based on these assessments.\n\nThere is some evidence that the standard discounted utility model\ndoes not adequately represent human behaviour. For a simple example,\nconsider a person who prefers one apple today to two apples tomorrow,\nbut yet (today) prefers two apples in 51 days to one apple in 50 days.\nAlthough this is a plausible preference pattern, it is incompatible\nwith the exponentially discounted utility model. It can\nhowever be accounted for in a bifactorial model with a declining\ndiscount rate. Pioneered by Ainslie (1992), psychologists and\nbehavioural economists have therefore proposed to replace\nSamuelson\u2019s exponential discounting model with a model of\nhyperbolic discounting. The hyperbolic model discounts the future\nconsumption with a parameter inversely proportional to the delay of\nthe consumption, and can therefore cover examples like the above. \n\nOther deviations from the discounted utility model have also been\ndemonstrated. Experimental evidence indicates that we tend to discount\ngains more than losses, and small amounts more than large amounts.\nDiscount rates also differ between different goods (such as money and\nhealth). For some\u2014but only some\u2014types of goods, improving\nsequences of outcomes are preferred to declining sequences. For instance, many would prefer an increasing rather than a decreasing living standard across their work life. These are\nall patterns that cannot be handled in the bifactorial model with its\nobject-independent time preferences (Loewenstein et al 2002). Given\nthe empirical evidence, it is an open question whether the concept of\n\u201ctime preferences\u201d is at all descriptively adequate.\n\nIt is a separate question whether pure time preferences are rational.\nCritics argue that one should want one\u2019s life, as a\nwhole, to go as well as possible, and that counting some parts of\nlife more than others interferes with this goal (Pigou, 1920; Ramsey,\n1928b; Rawls 1971). According to this view, it is irrational to prefer\na smaller immediate good to a greater future good, because now and\nlater are equally parts of one life. Choosing the smaller good or the\ngreater bad makes one\u2019s life, as a whole, turn out worse:\n\u201cRationality requires an impartial concern for all parts of our\nlife. The mere difference of location in time, of something\u2019s\nbeing earlier or later, is not a rational ground for having more or\nless regard for it\u201d (Rawls 1971, 293). Critics of pure temporal\npreferences often attribute apparent departures from temporal\nneutrality to a cognitive illusion (which causes people to\nsee future pleasures or pains in some diminished form) or to a\nweakness of will (which causes people to choose options\nagainst their better judgment).\n\nAgainst the temporal neutrality of preferences, some have argued that\nthere is no enduring, irreducible entity over time to whom all future\nutility can be ascribed; they deny that all parts of one\u2019s\nfuture are equally parts of oneself (Parfit 1984). They\nargue, instead, that a person is a succession of overlapping selves\nrelated to varying degrees by memories, physical continuities, and\nsimilarities of character and interests, etc. By this view, it may be\njust as rational to discount one\u2019s \u201cown\u201d future\npreferences, as to discount the preferences of another distinct\nindividual, because the divisions between the stages of one\u2019s\nlife may be as \u201cdeep\u201d as the distinctions between\nindividuals.\n \nIf pure time preferences are rational, the question arises whether\nthey are rationally required to adopt a certain form. Economists\nwidely consider the EDU model to be the rational standard, to the\nextent that hyperbolic discounting is considered an indicator of\nirrationality worthy of policy intervention (Strotz 1956,\nO\u2019Donoghue and Rabin 2015). Samuelson (1937, 160), the inventor\nof the EDU, was more cautious:\n\nany connection between utility as discussed here and any welfare\nconcept is disavowed. The idea that such a [mathematical]\ninvestigation could have any influence upon ethical judgments of\npolicy is one which deserves the impatience of modern\neconomists.\n\nRecently, some authors developed critiques of the normative validity\nof EDU. Hedden (2015) argues that defending EDU would force one to\nmake untestable distinctions between actual and ultimate\npreferences. Callender (2021, see also replies in this special issue)\nargues that EDU is not a universally valid standard, but instead is\ndependent on contextual factors as yet unspecified; and that many of\nthe current policy recommendations derived from this purported\nnormative standard are questionable. \n\nA quite different critical approach to discounting is connected with\nthe idea of sustainability. If sustainability is interpreted as\nmeaning that future generations should have access to the same\nresources as those that the present generation has at its disposal,\nthen sustainability is sure to be in conflict with economic policies\nbased on exponential discounting. However, there are also views on\nsustainability that allow us to use up natural resources if we replace\nthem by non-natural resources such as new technologies that will\ncompensate for the loss. Such a \u201cweak\u201d notion of\nsustainability appears to be compatible with policies based on\ndiscounting of future effects, but it has been criticized for putting future generations at disadvantage.
