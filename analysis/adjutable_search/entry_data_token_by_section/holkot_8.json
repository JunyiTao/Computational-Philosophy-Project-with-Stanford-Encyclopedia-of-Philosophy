    "main_text": "Divine Command Ethics || The significance of intention\n5.2 The significance of intention\n\nWhere the fact of command matters more than the substance of what is\ncommanded, human intention to obey has greater significance than the\nsubstantive enactments of obedience. Holkot perceived the connection\nbetween divine command and the human intention to obey as at the heart\nof the relationship between human beings and God. For instance, Holkot\nposed the case of a simple old woman, who in good faith comes to\nchurch to hear a new church doctrine from her bishop. If the bishop\ngets the doctrine backwards, explaining to his congregation that they\nshould believe just the opposite of what the new article of belief\ncontains, is the elderly laywoman required to accept the words of her\nbishop as true? One of Holkot\u2019s fellow scholars had argued that\nshe would only be in this position if she were being punished for sin,\nbut Holkot responded that it was not the substance of her belief that\nmattered, but her intention to do what was right and to obey God. Her\nintention to do her best to conform her will to God would be\nsufficient under the covenant to ensure her salvation if she were to\npersevere in that intention. God would not deny her salvation because\nthose on whom she necessarily depended for knowledge about God\u2019s\nwill were misinformed or confused (Slotemaker and Witt 2015,\n60\u201362).\n\nDebates over the place of deception in terms of both the absolute and\nordained systems of possibility involved Holkot and a number of his\nimmediate contemporaries. If the world is a contingent place that can\nbe other than it is, then do God\u2019s revelations constrain the\nscope of his possible future actions? If not, can what God says be\ndeceptive or false? Discussion took up scriptural instances in which\nGod seemed to deceive. Holkot, against a number of his contemporaries,\nargued that God can deceive human beings even in the ordained system,\nhas deceived them as shown in scripture, and has deceived them for no\nredeeming good apparent to human beings. If God\u2019s words to human\nbeings might be deceptive, such that it is not just the bishop who may\nimpart false information, but even God, then the human intention to\nbelieve God\u2019s words as true and to obey them takes on even more\nimportance. Holkot did not believe that God was playing the role of\nDescartes\u2019 deceiving demon, but Holkot also did not know how to\nrule out the possibility that he might be deceived about any given\nthing he believed (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 94\u201399). The\nimportant thing was that even if he were deceived, God had promised\nthat his intention to believe what was revealed and to do what he\nunderstood God wanted him to do provided security under the covenant.\nFaith in the covenant was the source of certainty, not rational\ndemonstration.\n\nThe place of intentionality in Holkot\u2019s theology and his\ngenerous view of divine graciousness provide the context for his use\nof a version of what has come to be called \u201cPascal\u2019s\nwager.\u201d Holkot passed on a story about a learned heretic who was\nconverted to a belief in immortality by a challenge from a Dominican\nlay brother: if you believe in immortality and it is true, you will\nhave gained a great deal, and if you believe in immortality and it is\nnot true, you will lose nothing. Forming an intention to believe could\nconstitute doing his best on the part of the heretic, and God would\nreward such an intention with the grace necessary for conversion to\nthe belief.\n",
