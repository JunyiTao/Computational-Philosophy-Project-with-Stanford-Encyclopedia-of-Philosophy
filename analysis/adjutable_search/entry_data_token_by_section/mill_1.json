    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Naturalism || Anti a priorism\n2.1 Anti a priorism\n\nMill\u2019s entire philosophical outlook is informed by a spirit of\nnaturalism (Skorupski 1989: 5ff.). It is not easy, however, to get a\nfoothold on this naturalism. Mill\u2019s general picture of mind and\nworld is established by appealing to what we are warranted in\nbelieving about the nature of those objects\u2014and hence relies on\na substantive account of knowledge. His account of knowledge, however,\ndraws upon his general picture of mind, world, and their\nrelation\u2014and therefore depends on a theory of what there is.\nThis circularity will be discussed in\n \u00a73.7.\n As an entry point into Mill\u2019s overall system for the purposes\nof exposition, however, we might simply note Mill\u2019s commitment\nto the claim that human beings are wholly part of nature, keeping in\nmind that Mill does not think of this as his unsupported starting\npoint, but itself a substantive claim.\n\nMill\u2019s belief that the mind is part of nature might usefully be\ncontrasted with those philosophers who hold that the mind has some\nexalted place in the order of things. Relevant contrasts are, for\ninstance, theists who hold that our minds have been given to us by an\nomnipotent and benevolent God for the purpose of comprehension, and\nidealists who hold that the mind has a formative role in constructing\nthe world. For such thinkers, a basic harmony between the architecture\nof mind and world might seem to be a given\u2014as such, if\nour experience could be found to take a certain form, then we\ncould infer facts about how the world must be composed. Mill rejects\nthis move.\n\n\nSuch an inference would only be warrantable, if we could know a\npriori that we must have been created capable of conceiving\nwhatever is capable of existing: that the universe of thought and that\nof reality, the Microcosm and the Macrocosm (as they were once called)\nmust have been framed in complete correspondence with one another\n[\u2026] but an assumption more destitute of evidence could scarcely\nbe made. (Examination, IX: 68)\n\n\nAs logically independent matters of fact, Mill thought there could be\nno seamless inference from the composition of our mind to how the rest\nof the world is, or must be. Mill holds, therefore, that there can be\nno genuine a priori knowledge of objective facts.\nMill\u2019s view that there are \u201cno truths cognizable by the\nmind\u2019s inward light, and grounded on intuitive evidence\u201d\n(Coleridge, X: 125) holds across the board. \n\n\nThe doctrine of a priori principles is one and the same\ndoctrine, whether applied to the \u1f42\u03bd or the\n\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd\u2014to the knowledge of truth or that of\nduty. (Whewell on Moral Philosophy, X: 171) \n\n\nAll genuine knowledge, then, whether theoretical or ethical, must be\nobtained by observation and experience.\n",
