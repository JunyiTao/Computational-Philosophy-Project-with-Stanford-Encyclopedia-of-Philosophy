    "main_text": "The Scottish Idealists\n6. The Scottish Idealists\n\nIn his illuminating study Scottish Philosophy, importantly\nsubtitled A comparison of the Scottish and German answers to\nHume, and the first of two sets of Balfour Lectures, Andrew Seth\nremarks:\n\nThe thread of national tradition, it is tolerably well known, has been\nbut loosely held of late by many of our best Scottish students of\nphilosophy. It will hardly be denied that the philosophical\nproductions of the younger generation of our University men are more\nstrongly impressed with a German than with a native stamp (Seth\nPringle-Pattison 1885, 1\u20132)\n\n\nSeth does not say who it is he has in mind, but a knowledge of the\nperiod makes it relatively easy to surmise. In fact Seth himself (he\nchanged his name to Seth Pringle-Pattison in 1898) was for a time\nidentified as one in virtue of being joint editor with R B Haldane of\nEssays in Philosophical Criticism (1883). This volume came to\nbe regarded as the Scottish Idealists' philosophical manifesto, though\nSeth in his second set of Balfour Lectures Hegelianism and\nPersonality registered a fundamental disagreements with the\nIdealists. The reference to \u201ca German stamp\u201d, however, may\nbe somewhat misleading. An interest in, and a knowledge of, Kant can\nbe found to go back to Hamilton, and far from being regarded as a\nthreat to the Scottish tradition was recognized (by Veitch, for\ninstance) as an important part of its enrichment. The German\nphilosophy referred to here, then, is that which emanated from\nHegel.\n\nThe Secret of Hegel is the title of a very large book by\nJames Hutchison Stirling (Hamilton's Idealist critic), first published\nin 1864. Stirling is credited with bringing Hegel to the attention of\nBritish (and not just Scottish) philosophy for the first time, though\na wit at the time remarked that if Stirling did know the secret of\nHegel, he had kept it to himself! Though Stirling was, in modern\nterms, a layman (he held no university post) the book was well\nreceived. Combined with his critical volume on Hamilton (published\njust one year later), Stirling's work was a key to the diminishing\ninterest in the Common Sense tradition within Scottish philosophy and\nthe increasing influence of German Idealism and Hegel in particular, a\ndevelopment that may be said to have culminated in the first complete\nEnglish translation of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit in\n1910 by J.B. Baillie, Regius Professor of Moral Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Aberdeen.\n\nOf the Scottish Idealists the most prominent and influential was\nEdward Caird (1835\u20131908). A graduate of the University of\nGlasgow, after a period at Oxford he returned in 1866 to become\nGlasgow's Professor of Moral Philosophy, a post he held for almost 30\nyears, before returning to Oxford to become Master of Balliol. Caird\nwas an admirer of Kant, but believed that Kant had failed to\ncapitalize fully on his own insights, and that the real import of his\nphilosophy could be uncovered with the help of Hegel. The aim of\nphilosophy, on this interpretation, was the ultimate reconciliation of\nseemingly incompatible elements in human experience\u2014religion and\nscience, freedom and causality, reason and desire, for instance, but\nabove all and at its most abstract, subject and object (or mind and\nbody). The employment of these distinctions is essential to making\nhuman experience intelligible, but once they are held to be absolute\nerror and confusion arises. Materialism makes the distinction between\nmind and body absolute and seeks to explain the former in terms of the\nlatter; Cartesianism works in reverse. Both result in rendering the\nrelation mysterious.\n\nThe solution lies in the Hegelian perception that our knowledge is\nperfected when its objects are conceived as parts of a whole,\nultimately the Absolute. This way of understanding, however, is not\nsomething to be accomplished simply. Human understanding evolves as\nhuman experience increases and our knowledge expands. Accordingly,\nCaird and the other Scottish Idealists, especially David Ritchie at St\nAndrews, welcomed the growth of natural science, and especially\nbiology, as providing important new material for the further\nevolutionary development of human understanding as a whole.\n\nThree consequent problems can be said to have occupied them chiefly.\nThe first was to avoid the charge of \u201cmentalism\u201d or\n\u201cpanpsychism\u201d. The Idealist contention that materialism is\nfalse leads easily to the counter accusation that the world is made of\nmental stuff. This charge is often leveled at Berkeley, interest in\nwhom greatly increased among Scottish philosophers at this time.\nAlexander Campbell Fraser, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, though not himself an Idealist in\nphilosophy,became editor of a new collected edition of Berkeley's\nworks. Ferrier, Fraser and Seth all denied that Berkeley's\nimmaterialism amounts to mentalism, but it became common to\ndistinguish between \u201csubjective Idealism\u201d and\n\u201cAbsolute Idealism\u201d, the latter being the doctrine the\nScottish Idealists espoused.\n\nAppeal to \u201cThe Absolute\u201d, however, brings another\ndanger\u2014a threat to the reality of individual finite minds. There\nis a risk that the individual subject is reduced to a modification of\nthe one Absolute universal mind, and hence eliminated as an\nindependently existing centre of consciousness. This was the principal\nreason that led Seth to conclude against Hegelianism in his second set\nof Balfour Lectures, and he identified it as a problem that the other\nIdealists (notably Caird) failed to avoid.\n\nThe third issue is religion. How does \u201cthe Absolute\u201d\nrelate to \u201cGod\u201d? This was not simply a question internal\nto Idealist philosophy, but of far wider cultural and intellectual\nconcern, partly because of the threat that Darwinian biology and\nBiblical \u201chigher\u201d criticism seemed to pose for Christian\ntheism, and partly because of the rise of anthropological inquiry and\nthe new \u201cscience of religions\u201d. Edward Caird's brother\nJohn, a prominent churchman, Professor of Divinity at Glasgow,\nsubsequently Principal of the University, and also an Idealist in\nphilosophy, devoted this Croall Lectures to this topic. A more\nsustained opportunity to address these questions arose with the\nestablishment in 1882 of the Gifford Lectures at the four Scottish\nUniversities. Several series of these important lectures were given by\nthe principal Scottish Idealists, and subsequently\npublished\u2014The Evolution of Religion (1891\u20132) by\nEdward Caird (widely regarded as his philosophical masterpiece),\nNaturalism and Agnosticism (1896\u20138) by J.S. Ward, and\nThe Fundamental Ideas of Christianity (1912\u201313) by John\nCaird, are three of the most important. All of them deploy the\nresources of Idealist philosophy to defend a version of theism that is\ncompatible with evolutionary biology. They do so in part by\ninterpreting the concept of \u201cevolution\u201d philosophically so\nthat both thought and religion are understood to evolve, no less than\nbiological organism.\n",
