    "main_text": "\n\n\nA mathematical problem is computable if it can be solved in\nprinciple by a computing device. Some common synonyms for\n\u201ccomputable\u201d are \u201csolvable\u201d,\n\u201cdecidable\u201d, and \u201crecursive\u201d. Hilbert believed\nthat all mathematical problems were solvable, but in the 1930\u2019s\nG\u00f6del, Turing, and Church showed that this is not the case. There\nis an extensive study and classification of which mathematical\nproblems are computable and which are not. In addition, there is an\nextensive classification of computable problems into computational\ncomplexity classes according to how much computation\u2014as a\nfunction of the size of the problem instance\u2014is needed to\nanswer that instance. It is striking how clearly, elegantly, and\nprecisely these classifications have been drawn. \n",
