    "main_text": "Animals and the Environment\n5. Animals and the Environment\n\nLike several other Asian traditions, Buddhism does not regard humans\nas fundamentally different from other animals. Through the process of\nrebirth, what is in some sense the same entity can be a human now, but\nan animal in the past and in the future. One consequence of this claim\nis that any animal you meet is likely to have been a human at one\ntime, and may even have been your own mother in a previous life.\nMoreover, animals are seen as just as capable of suffering as humans\nare; they are also appropriate objects of the emotions of compassion,\nlovingkindness and equanimity. Thus we have powerful reasons not to\ncause them unnecessary suffering and to refrain from harming or\nkilling them.\n\nThough animals are sentient beings and possess consciousness, just as\nhumans do, there is one reason why human lives are more precious than\nanimal lives. Only in a human body can one attain awakening; in an\nanimal body, this is not possible. Therefore, Buddhists maintain that\nit is worse to kill a human than to kill an animal.\n\nThough all Buddhist traditions attach moral significance to animal\nlife and animal suffering, not all Buddhists practice vegetarianism.\nFor example, Therav\u0101da monks, who live by begging, are expected\nto eat whatever food is placed in their bowl, including meat, without\npreference or discrimination. However, they are forbidden to eat meat\nfrom an animal if they have seen, heard, or suspected that the animal\nin question was killed specifically for them.\n\nThe Tibetan plateau is at a high altitude and has a very cold, dry\nclimate. Over much of Tibet, the only form of food production possible\nis nomadic pastoralism, with sheep and yaks as the major sources of\nfood. Moreover, under premodern conditions, and given the cold\nweather, people living in Tibet needed to eat calorie-dense food in\norder to survive. A strict vegetarianism was therefore quite\nimpractical. As a result, many Tibetans came to accept meat eating as\na necessary part of their lifestyle. Today, however, with more\nvegetarian food options available and with many Tibetans living in\nexile, important spiritual leaders in the Tibetan tradition have begun\nto advocate a switch to a vegetarian diet.\n\nSome sources in the Buddhist tradition hold that it is worse to kill\nan animal yourself than to eat the meat of an animal someone else has\nkilled. Many faithful Buddhists go to great lengths not to kill\nanimals. Moreover, the professions of hunting and fishing are\nclassified as \u201cwrong livelihood,\u201d and Buddhists are\nexpected not to follow them. In majority Buddhist countries, butchers\nare often members of non-Buddhist religious minorities.\n\nBefore the time of the historical Buddha, animal sacrifice was an\nimportant part of Indian religious practice. The Buddha expressed his\nunqualified opposition to animal sacrifice, holding that far from\ncreating religious merit, it would only produce bad karma for those\nengaged in it. As a result of his teachings, along with those of\nMah\u0101v\u012bra, the founder of Jainism, ideals of nonviolence\nbecame more prevalent in India, and animal sacrifice declined rapidly\nin frequency and prestige. Among a few marginal Buddhist or\nquasi-Buddhist groups in the Himalayas, animal sacrifice is still\npracticed today; but Buddhist monastic institutions have fairly\nconsistently opposed the killing of animals for religious\npurposes.\n\nMost Buddhist texts hold that plants are not sentient beings and do\nnot have moral status in and of themselves. Although a few scattered\nsources suggest that plants might be sentient, the mainstream of the\ntradition sees it as morally unproblematic in itself to use, kill, or\neat plants. However, since animals depend on plants, there are\nsometimes instrumental reasons to protect plants for the sake of\nanimal welfare. We do find guidance, for example, to be careful in\ncutting down trees to refrain from harming the animals who live in and\naround them. In Southeast Asia, some Buddhist monks have been very\nactive in protecting forests from logging.\n\nBuddhism does not see a great gulf between humans and non-human\nanimals, as some adherents of Western religions do; the suffering of\nanimals is morally significant, just like the suffering of humans.\nMoreover, Buddhist theories of causality stress that things arise in\ndependence on a diverse collection of causes and conditions, implying\nthat human life is interdependent in complex ways with other forms of\nlife on Earth. And as mentioned above, the cultivation of\nlovingkindness and compassion for all sentient beings is an important\npart of most systems of Buddhist meditation practice. As a result of\nthese teachings, many contemporary Buddhists, especially in the West,\nplace great value on ecological awareness and environmental\nsustainability. They seek to develop a way of life for humanity that\nsupports spiritual practice and can coexist in harmony with the\nnon-human animals who share our planet.\n",
