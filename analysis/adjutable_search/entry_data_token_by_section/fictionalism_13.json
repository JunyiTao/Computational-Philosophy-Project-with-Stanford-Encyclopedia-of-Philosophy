    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || Can fictionalism deliver the goods?\n4.2 Can fictionalism deliver the goods?\n\nEven though there are many different arguments for and motivations\nbehind fictionalism, one main motivation is clearly the ontological\none. Fictionalism about a discourse D is often seen as\nattractive precisely because it promises to get around otherwise\npotentially serious philosophical problems regarding\nD\u2019s ontology. But one worry is that fictionalism can\nfail to make good on this promise. Here are some examples of how this\ncan happen.\n\nFirst, according to fictionalism about a given discourse, the\ndiscourse is in important respects analogous to paradigmatic cases of\nfiction. This is supposed to have ontological advantages.\nSpecifically, the entities characteristic of the relevant discourse\nare sometimes supposed then to have the same ontological status as\nfictional entities. But if fictional entities are problematic in their\nown right, then not much is gained by this move. Fictionalism about\nfictional characters \u2014 see, e.g., Brock (2002), and Everett\n(2005), and ch. 10 of Walton (1990) \u2014 is one attempt to get\naround this problem. A different response to the objection is that it\ntakes too seriously the label \u201cfictionalism\u201d. Some\nprominent types of fictionalism claim only that in ordinary utterances\nof sentences of some discourse, speakers don\u2019t aim at literal\ntruth. That claim by no means amounts to saying that the putative\nentities of the discourse have the same ontological status as\nfictional entities, whatever exactly that is.\n\nSecond, consider Peter van Inwagen\u2019s (1990) fictionalism about\nordinary objects. Van Inwagen suggests that when we say, e.g.,\n\u201cThere is a table here\u201d, what we really assert is\nsomething like: there are simples arranged tablewise here.\nSider (1993) notes a problem: van Inwagen\u2019s paraphrase strategy\npresupposes that there are simples and not gunk (in other words, it\npresupposes that all objects decompose into minimal parts,\n\u2018simples\u2019) and there is no straightforward way of\nreformulating it so as to take into account the possibility of gunk.\nIf indeed it seems at all wrong that in our everyday discourse we\nshould manifest a preference for the hypothesis that there are\nmacrophysical objects over agnosticism about the matter, it should\nanyway seem more wrong still that in our ordinary practices we should\nmanifest a preference for the hypothesis that there are simples rather\nthan gunk. Sider\u2019s point concerns only van Inwagen\u2019s\nspecific strategy. But there is a general lesson nearby: the adequacy\nof the paraphrases might itself depend on substantive metaphysical\nassumptions.\n",
