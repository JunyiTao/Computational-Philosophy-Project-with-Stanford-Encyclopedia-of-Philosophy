In fact, there is considerable skepticism in the\nphilosophical community about this fundamental theory. A common\ncriticism (among philosophers) is that it is gene-centered.\n\n\nSeveral philosophers have set out to replace the fundamental theory\nassociated with molecular genetics with a new fundamental theory that\ndoes not \"privilege\" the gene. Among the proposals is Robert's\n(2004). Drawing upon the writings of Burian, Griffiths, Keller, Oyama,\nMoss, and others, Robert tries to construct a new \u201cframework for\nunderstanding and explaining organismal development\u201d (p. 78)\nthat does not reduce \u201cthe problem of development\u201d to the\nproblem of gene action and gene activation. He seeks a framework that\nis free from the alleged assumption that development involves the\nexpression of \u201cpreformed genetic information\u201d (p.\n56). Robert says that his framework focuses on organisms rather than\ngenes and that it \u201ctakes seriously\u201d the dynamical\ncomplexities of development emphasized by Keller.\n\n\nPhilosophers engaged in fundamental theorizing have not, at least yet,\nattracted much attention from practicing scientists. Perhaps the lack\nof attention is due to a difference between the concerns of (many)\nphilosophers of biology and the needs of practicing\nbiologists. Wagner, a theoretical biologist who has conducted\nmathematical/conceptual work in evolutionary theory as well as\nempirical research on the evolution of morphological characters, makes\nthe following observation in a review of Robert's book,\n\n\n\nRobert and his colleagues who argue for a similar interpretation are\ncorrect in that the genes alone cannot make an organism and instead are\nembedded in a large network of causal interactions. But scientists are\nusually not interested in general statements about what in principle is\nrequired to understand a phenomenon. \n\n\nYes, scientists make pragmatic decision about what to study, but I\nthink that these decisions are anything but arbitrary. The power of\nmolecular genetic approaches did not come easily, rather it is the\nresult of a long history of strenuous research based on a vision that\nderived from the work of Richard Goldschmidt, Alfred\nK\u00fchn, and Thomas Hunt Morgan early in the 20th Century.\nIt is thus not intellectual laziness that drives the genetic research\nprogram; instead we are raking in the spoils of a hard-won victory over\nbiological complexity. (Wagner 2004, p. 1405)\n\n\n\nThe discrepancy between (many) philosophers' interest in\nfundamental theorizing and practicing biologists' need to make\npragmatic decisions about what to study raises an important question\nabout gene-centered sciences that has been largely overlooked by\nphilosophers: why is so much biological research centered on genes and\nDNA?\n",
