    "main_text": "\n\nIn the 1930s, Ludwik Fleck (1896\u20131961), a Polish-Jewish\nmicrobiologist, developed the first system of the historical\nphilosophy and sociology of science. Fleck claimed that cognition is a\ncollective activity, since it is only possible on the basis of a\ncertain body of knowledge acquired from other people. When people\nbegin to exchange ideas, a thought collective arises, bonded\nby a specific mood, and as a result of a series of\nunderstandings and misunderstandings a peculiar thought style\nis developed. When a thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated,\nthe collective divides itself into an esoteric circle\n(professionals) and an exoteric circle (laymen). A thought\nstyle consists of the active elements, which shape ways in\nwhich members of the collective see and think about the world, and of\nthe passive elements, the sum of which is perceived as an\n\u201cobjective reality\u201d. What we call \u201cfacts\u201d, are\nsocial constructs: only what is true to culture is true to nature.\nThought styles are often incommensurable: what is a fact to\nthe members of a thought collective A sometimes does not exist to the\nmembers of a thought collective B, and a thought that is significant\nand true to the members of A may sometimes be false or meaningless for\nmembers of B.\n",
