    "main_text": "Relevance || The Small Town Murder objection\n4.2 The Small Town Murder objection\n\nThis account of relevance has been challenged by cases in which the\nevidence is intuitively relevant and yet its likelihood ratio,\narguably, equals one. Here is one problematic case:\n\n\nSmall Town Murder: A person accused of murder in a small town\nwas seen driving to the small town at a time prior to the murder. The\nprosecution\u2019s theory is that he was driving there to commit the\nmurder. The defense theory is an alibi: he was driving to the town to\nvisit his mother. The probability of this evidence if he is guilty\nequals that if he is innocent, and thus the likelihood ratio is 1\n\u2026 Yet, every judge in every trial courtroom of the country\nwould admit it [as relevant evidence]. (The difficulty has been\nformulated by Ronald Allen, see the discussion in Park et al.\n2010)\n\n\nCounterexamples of this sort abound. Suppose a prisoner and two guards\nhad an altercation because the prisoner refused to return a food tray.\nThe prisoner had not received a package sent to him by his family and\nkept the tray in protest. According to the defense, the prisoner was\nattacked by the guards, but according to the prosecution, he attacked\nthe guards. The information about the package sent to the prisoner and\nthe withholding of the tray fails to favor either version of the\nfacts, yet it is relevant evidence (Pardo 2013).\n\nIt is true that if a piece of evidence \\(E\\) fits equally well with\ntwo competing hypotheses \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\), then \\(P(E\\pmid\nH)=P(E\\pmid H')\\) and thus \\(LR(E,H,H')\\) will equal 1. But\nthe likelihood ratio may change depending on the selection of\nhypotheses. Rule 401 makes clear that relevant evidence should have\n\n\n\nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\nconsequence [emphasis ours] to the determination of the action\nmore probable or less probable. \n\n\nSo the range of hypotheses to compare should be broad. Just because\nthe likelihood ratio equals one for a specific selection of \\(H\\) and\n\\(H'\\), it does not follow that it equals one for any\nselection of \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) which are of consequence to the\ndetermination of what happened. In Small Town Murder, whether\nthe suspect was in town is of consequence for determining what\nhappened (if he was not in town, he could not have committed the\ncrime). The fact that he was seen driving is helpful information for\nestablishing whether he was in town.\n\nBut if the range of hypotheses \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) to compare in the\nlikelihood ratio \\(LR(E, H, H')\\) is broad, this may raise another\nconcern. The choice of hypotheses needed to determine the relevance of\nan item of evidence might depend on other items of evidence, and so it\nmight be difficult to determine relevance until one has heard all the\nevidence. This fact\u2014Ronald Allen and Samuel Gross argue in Park\net al. (2010)\u2014makes the probabilistic account of relevance\nimpractical. In response, David Kaye points out that deciding whether\na reasonable juror would find evidence \\(E\\) helpful requires only\nlooking at what hypotheses or stories the juror would reasonably\nconsider. Since the jurors will rely on several clues about which\nstories are reasonable, this task is computationally easier than going\nover all possible combinations of hypotheses (Park et al. 2010).\n\nThe problem with the paradoxes of relevance is that in complex\nsituations there is no single likelihood ratio that corresponds to a\npiece of evidence. The problematic cases focus on a single likelihood\nratio based on non-exclusive or non-exhaustive hypotheses. However,\nevidence can be relevant so long as it has a probabilistic impact on a\npertinent sub-hypothesis, even without having a probabilistic impact\non the prosecutor\u2019s or defense\u2019s ultimate hypotheses. When\nthis happens, the evidence is relevant, in agreement with Rule 401 of\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. Bayesian networks (discussed in the\npreceding section) help to see how pieces of evidence can increase or\ndecrease the probability of different sub-hypotheses (for more\ndetails, see de Zoete et al. 2019).\n",
