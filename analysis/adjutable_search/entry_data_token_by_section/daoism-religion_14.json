    "main_text": "Main Schools and Lineages || New Lineages in the Song Dynasty\n3.6 New Lineages in the Song Dynasty\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), major\nchanges in society\u2014in particular urbanization, the creation of a\nmarket economy, and the rise to prominence of new classes, especially\nin the southeastern regions\u2014led to major transformations in\nreligion. The institution of \u201clay associations\u201d, whose\nmain function was (in addition to performing various meritorious\nactions) supporting the local temple, was especially important in the\ndevelopment of Daoism, and at the same time in furthering the\nincorporation of cults to local deities and saints into the Daoist\npantheon and liturgy.\n\nThe Way of the Celestial Masters (then based at Mount Longhu, in\npresent-day Jiangxi) was officially assigned the task of ordaining\npriests, but a series of revelations resulted in the creation of\nlineages that, in several cases, claimed to have been\noriginated by Zhang Daoling himself. Between the mid-10th\nand the mid-13th centuries, five main lineages were\nestablished: Tianxin (Celestial Heart), Shenxiao\n(Divine Empyrean), Yutang dafa (Great Rites of the Jade\nHall), Lingbao dafa (Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure),\nand Qingwei (Pure Tenuity). All of them were based on\ndifferent codifications of ritual\u2014including exorcist\nrites\u2014but with little variation in the basic practices (Boltz 1987:\n26\u201349; Skar 2000). Local communities, in addition, had their own\nritual specialists, known as fashi (\u201critual\nmasters\u201d), a term that designated, as it still does in the\npresent day, lay officiants who specialize in exorcist practices\n(Davis 2001).\n\nThe Song dynasty and the successive Mongol Yuan dynasty\n(1271\u20131368) also saw important developments in the traditions of\nInternal Alchemy (Neidan), especially with the creation of\nNanzong, the Southern Lineage, which is ascribed with one of\nthe main codifications of the alchemical practice (see\n \u00a710.3).\n",
