    "main_text": "Epistemological Issues || Against the Skeptics\n4.1 Against the Skeptics\n\nMersenne\u2019s attitude towards skepticism was complex, changing\nover time and somewhat ambivalent. In L\u2019Usage de la\nraison\u2014a recently rediscovered booklet from 1623, whose\nauthorship does not seem questionable\u2014one finds arguments\nagainst the vanity of the sciences that are strongly reminiscent of\nthose expressed around the same time by \u201cChristian\nskeptics\u201d, such as Montaigne and Charron, or even Cornelius\nAgrippa, authors whom Mersenne sternly criticized in his next\npublications. Thus, in the \u201cDedicatory Epistle to Madame de\nVitry\u201d, the Minim suggested that our time is badly employed in\nstudying the sciences, which are plagued with insuperable\nuncertainty:\n\n\nwhenever we raise our eyes to the sky or incline it to the earth, we\nmust owe that everything is unknown to us\u2026 Who can claim to\nknow the number of the skies, their form, their matter, properties and\naccident? One can even find idle-dreamers Copernicans prepared to deny\nthe motion of the skies\u2026 Who can say if Alchemists are right in\ntheir promises.\n\n\nThis uncertainty of the \u201cmegalocosm\u201d goes together with an\nequal puzzlement concerning the littlest creature of the micro-world,\nas recent microscopes have shown to the eye that \u201cit is pure\nignorance to say that they are deprived of these several organs that\ncan be seen in larger creatures\u201d. Further, (UR: 37\u201338) the\nauthor condemned Pythagoras, Archimedes, the alchemists, the\nalgebraists, etc. for being so much attached to their inventions that\nthey forget to think of God, and eternal glory\u2026\n\nThe change of attitude in the next published works is striking. On the\none hand, in the Quaestiones and\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9, skepticism was presented as a sequel\nto Calvinism; and the denunciation of human reason found in Charron\nand Montaigne, far from encouraging faith in the mysteries of\nChristian religion, was seen as inclining men towards atheism and\nlibertinism. On the other hand, Mersenne was no longer denouncing the\nsciences indistinctly as vain curiosity, his general attitude towards\nspeculative enquiry was much more positive, especially when one came\nto the mathematical sciences, whose apologetic virtues he wanted now\nto reveal. He maintained however that our reason is weak,\ncontradictory, particularly in regard philosophical (i.e., physical)\nissues:\n\n\nif our reasons were not deceitful, how would it come that there is not\nany one question in Philosophy, that does not raise diverse opinions\nwholly contrary on the same subjects, all of which have their reason\nand nevertheless there is only one that is true. (ID II: 672)\n\n\nIn La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences contre les sceptiques et\nles phyrroniens, the tone changed again. Skepticism was no longer\ncondemned as a seed of heterodoxy but only in so far as it discourages\nmen from the practice of mathematical sciences. The skeptical\ncharacter is obstinate, but he is no atheist nor heretic in the\ndisguise (see Descotes, in VS, Introduction), and in the first part of\nthe book, his arguments against the alchemist\u2019s dogmatism are\noften endorsed and even reinforced by the Christian philosopher.\n\nAgainst the epistemological optimism of the alchemist who considers\nhimself to be in possession of the perfect science, the skeptic\nresorts to the traditional arguments of the academic school,\nemphasizing that certainty is nowhere to be found, as we have only a\nvery partial and superficial knowledge of things. We perceive only the\neffects and not the profound nature nor the ultimate causes of things.\nThe true essences evade us. The simplest objects (such as a sheet of\npaper) cannot be completely known, because of the infinite number of\nrelations in which they are involved with other elements of the\nuniverse. It has been shown by G. Paganini that these arguments and\nexamples are almost verbatim borrowed from the \u201csecond\ndoubt\u201d of Campanella\u2019s Metaphysica, a manuscript\nthat was in Mersenne\u2019s hands at the time he wrote La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences, but that he did not mention as\nhis source (Paganini 2005 & 2008).\n\nIn chapter 11 and 12, the Christian philosopher presents the skeptical\narguments in a new and more radical form. He gives an account of the\nten skeptical tropes of Aenesideme, as Mersenne could have read them\nin Sextus Empiricus and Diog\u00e8ne Laertius. These tropes draw on\nthe varieties of animal constitution in regard pleasures and pains,\nthe idiosyncrasy of men, the disagreement of the senses, the varieties\nof circumstances and dispositions, such as health and disease, sleep\nand wakefulness, young age and old age. All show that the information\nof our senses is unreliable, just as the reasons we draw from\nthem.\n\nIn answer to these doubts, Mersenne\u2019s Christian philosopher\nresorts to an eclectic strategy. On the one hand, he adopts the usual\nAristotelian standpoint against skepticism regarding the senses: sense\nperception is trustworthy, provided that its exercise takes place in\n\u201cnormal\u201d and appropriate conditions. Errors occur only\nwhen the senses are affected by disease, or presented with objects\nwhose distance, illumination, intensity, etc. exceed the normal\nrange:\n\n\nAll the deceptions of senses that you object are of no use, for they\nonly prove what we concede, namely that each one of our senses, in\norder to judge its object rightly must have all that its nature and\nthe perfection of its operation require\u2014this granted, it never\nerrs. (VS I: 15)\n\n\nOn the other hand, just as senses are the right judges of their own\nproper sensible\u2014the eye of color and light, the ear of sound,\netc.\u2014human intellect also possesses an internal criterion which\nallows it to judge its own objects rightly. It has the use of \u201ca\nspiritual and universal light that it has of its own nature since the\ncommencement of its creation\u201d (VS: 193). Here the inspiration is\nclearly Augustinian, as it is for Descartes\u2019s parent conception\nof \u201clumi\u00e8re naturelle\u201d. The light of the soul does\nnot give men direct access to divine knowledge, knowledge of essences,\nas that would require an eternal glory and a supernatural light. But\nit still gives access to a number of evidentia, immediate\ncertainties, whose truth, Mersenne concedes, depends on God\u2019s\nillumination and God\u2019s veracity. Thus, in every realm of\nknowledge or human interests, there are truths that are not capable of\ndoubt, such as \u201cthe whole is greater than the part\u201d, or\n\u201cevil should be avoided\u201d.\n\nAnother Augustinian aspect of Mersenne\u2019s defense is the idea\nthat doubt itself can be turned into a source of knowledge. For\nexample, although there are differences in apprehension between\nvarious men, or between men and beasts, we do have the knowledge of\nsuch differences and this is something that cannot be doubted:\n\u201cat least one knows that the objects of the senses appear\ndifferently according to the diverse dispositions of the organs\u201d\n(VS: 193). Awareness of this sort of facts is what incites men to seek\nthe laws of appearances\u2014for example, the optical and geometrical\nrules that govern variations in perspective. In other terms, it\nprompts them to engage into physico-mathematical enquiries.\n\nOn a similar line of argument, one could say, following Augustine in\nDe Civitate Dei (1998, chapter XI, 26) that one cannot doubt\nthat one doubts, unless admitting an infinite regress:\n\n\nI do not believe you doubt that [that we can learn science, with great\ncontentment] because you experience this every day in yourself, and if\nyou doubt it I ask whether you know that you are doubting; if you know\nit, you must know something, and consequently you do not doubt\neverything; an if you doubt that you doubted, I shall force you to\nadmit infinite regress, which you say you reject, so that wherever you\ngo, you must confess that there is some truth, and consequently you\nmust say farewell to your Pyrrhonism. (VS I: 204)\n\n\nIn the next decade, reacting to the cogito argument in the\nDiscours de la M\u00e9thode, Mersenne pointed out to\nDescartes how close his use of radical doubt was to that Augustinian\nargument (see Gouhier 1978).\n",
