How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns?\n\nWhereas information technology is typically seen as the cause\nof privacy problems, there are also several ways in which information\ntechnology can help to solve these problems. There are rules,\nguidelines or best practices that can be used for designing\nprivacy-preserving systems. Such possibilities range from\nethically-informed design methodologies to using encryption to protect\npersonal information from unauthorized use. In particular, methods\nfrom the field of information security, aimed at protecting\ninformation against unauthorized access, can play a key role in the\nprotection of personal data.\n",
