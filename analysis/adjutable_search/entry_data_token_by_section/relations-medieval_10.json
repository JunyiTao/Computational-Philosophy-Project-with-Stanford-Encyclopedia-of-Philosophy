    "main_text": "Non-Paradigmatic Relational Situations\n5. Non-Paradigmatic Relational Situations\n\n\nSo far we have been focusing only on the medieval discussion of\nparadigmatic relational situations\u2014that is, relational\nsituations conforming to the analysis suggested in Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories. But as we indicated earlier, it is clear from\nsome of Aristotle\u2019s later works, most notably the\nMetaphysics, that he thinks not all relational situations can\nbe made to conform to it. Thus, in Metaphysics V, he suggests\nthat there are some relational situations in which substances are\nrelated, not by a pair of accidents, but by a single accident\nbelonging to just one of them. Here he cites the example of\nintentional relations: if Simmias is thinking about Socrates, this is\nto be explained in terms of nothing but Simmias, Socrates, and an\naccident of Simmias. For the sake of convenience, we shall hereafter\nrefer to relational situations that do not conform to the\nCategories paradigm as \u2018non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations\u2019.\n\n\nAlthough medieval philosophers did not have direct access to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics until the mid-twelfth century, they\ndid feel pressure from other, largely theological sources to admit\nsomething like his non-paradigmatic relational situations. The\nstandard medieval conception of deity, for example, requires that God\nis an absolutely perfect being, possessing no accidents\nwhatsoever. But this conception makes it difficult to explain how God\ncan enter into relational situations. Indeed, as Augustine points out\nin book V of his De Trinitate, there is a special difficulty\nfor those want to combine this conception with the Christian doctrine\nof creation. For this doctrine would seem to require that God first\nlacks, and then acquires a contingent or accidental\nrelation\u2014namely, that of being creator. But then does it not\nalso require that in creating the universe God underwent a real\nchange? And what about the claim that there are no accidents in\nGod?\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s solution, which is adopted by medieval philosophers\ngenerally, is to say that when God acquires a new relation, this is to\nbe explained in terms of properties or accidents of something other\nthan God. Thus, in the case of creation Augustine says:\n\n\nEven though [God\u2019s substance] begins to be [truly] spoken of\n[as related to a creature] at some time, still nothing is to be\nunderstood as having happened to the divine substance itself, but only\nto the creature in relation to whom it is spoken\n of.[31]\n\n\n\nOn the basis of theological considerations, therefore, Augustine is\nled to something like Aristotle\u2019s non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations. What makes it true that God is related to his creatures is\nnothing but God, the creatures, and a monadic property or accident of\nthe latter.\n\n\nInterestingly, Augustine does not think that the case of God is\nunique, but also suggests that there are non-theological cases in which\nthings are related solely in virtue of the properties or accidents of\nother things. Thus, a coin, he says can increase or decrease in value\nsolely in virtue of the intentional states of human\n beings.[32]\n Boethius, in a treatise also known as De Trinitate,\ndiscusses the same sorts of issues, and in the course of doing so adds\nyet another non-theological example\u2014a variation of which comes\nto be the standard medieval example of non-paradigmatic relational\nsituations.  Consider a man who walks up beside another man (or beside\nstationary column, as the standard medieval variation has it). In this\nsort of case, says Boethius, the latter comes to be to the right of\nthe man, but solely in virtue of a property of the\n man.[33]\n\n\nThus, even before medieval philosophers had direct access to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics they were led to acknowledge the\nexistence of the same type of relational situations mentioned\nthere. Of course, once the relevant texts of Aristotle became\navailable, the medievals worked hard to connect their discussions with\nthese texts.  Indeed, when the issue of God\u2019s relation to his\ncreatures is taken up in the thirteenth century\u2014an issue that\nbecomes one of the foci of medieval discussions of relations\ngenerally\u2014medieval philosophers often made direct appeals to\nAristotle\u2019s discussion in Metaphysics\n V.[34]\n",
