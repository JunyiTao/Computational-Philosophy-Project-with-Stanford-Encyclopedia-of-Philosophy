    "main_text": "Other Uses of Dutch Book Arguments || Sleeping Beauty\n5.1 Sleeping Beauty\n\nAn interesting application of Dutch Strategy arguments has been made\nby Hitchcock to the perplexing Sleeping Beauty problem (Hitchcock\n2004). In the problem, Beauty is to undergo an experiment in which she\nwill be put to sleep on Sunday night, after which a fair coin will be\ntossed. If it comes up heads, she will be awakened just once for a\nshort time on Monday, and if tails she will also be awakened again on\nTuesday. In each case, after being awakened, she will be put back to\nsleep with drugs that will erase her memory of having been awake. On\nWednesday, she is awakened and the experiment ends. Beauty is aware of\nthese facts about the experiment, so that when she wakes up during the\nexperiment she will not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday. The\nproblem is to determine what her probability should be for heads upon\nawakening within the experiment. Elga introduced the problem into the\nphilosophical literature (Elga 2000), and argued that upon awakening\nBeauty should shift her probability from the value of \u00bd\nthat she assigned on Sunday night to \u2153. Lewis argued\nshortly thereafter that Beauty\u2019s probability upon awakening\nshould remain at \u00bd (Lewis 2001), and additional\narguments have followed on both sides. Hitchcock shows that there is a\nDutch Strategy against either answer, but then argues that there is\nonly force to the one against Beauty if she sticks with\n\u00bd.\n\nThe strategies serve as potential counterarguments to the two ways of\nanswering the problem, rather than showing that it is irrational to\nswitch to \u2153 or stick with \u00bd per se,\nsince the individual strategies depend upon the plan to have a\nparticular probability upon awakening. If Beauty plans to switch to\nprobability \u2153 for heads, the Dutch Strategy is just an\napplication of the general strategy against someone who violates\nReflection. Hitchcock argues that this would not establish\nBeauty\u2019s irrationality, since in this case the bookie must know\nduring the experiment what day it is in order to implement the\nstrategy, which is information that Beauty lacks. On the other hand,\nif Beauty sticks with \u00bd, a strategy can be carried out\nwithout the bookie having to know more than Beauty by having the\nbookie undergo the experiment with her and offer a bet against heads\non Sunday and a bet on heads whenever Beauty and the bookie awake\nwithin the experiment. If the coin lands heads, the bookie sells\nBeauty just one bet on heads, with her gain totaling less than her\nloss on the first bet against heads. If the coin lands tails, the\nbookie sells a bet on heads once on Monday and the same bet again on\nTuesday, so as to again produce a loss for Beauty. Hitchcock takes\nthis book to tell against the answer \u00bd, and in favor of\n\u2153.\n\nOne trouble with defending the answer of \u2153 in this way\nis that what a bookie must know to assure himself a profit does not\ncharacterize what is essential to a proper Dutch Book. There is also a\nparticular reason to suppose that Beauty\u2019s predicament is one in\nwhich reasonable degrees of belief and betting quotients can come\napart, because the third bet needed to make book in the switching case\nis only offered when it is sure to be a losing bet (discussed in\nVineberg 2004\u2014see the Other Internet Resources, and Bradley and\nLeitgeb 2006). In this case the bookie exploits features of the\nexperiment, so that the strategy can be carried out without his\npossessing knowledge of the day. But the fact that the bets leading to\nbook are triggered by the circumstances suggests that it is not just\nBeauty\u2019s beliefs on which the strategy depends, and hence the\nloss does not reflect a purely internal defect, despite the fact that\nthe bookie can implement the strategy without having access during the\nexperiment to knowledge that Beauty lacks. Draper and Pust also argue\nthat Hitchcock\u2019s use of a Dutch Book argument is subject to an\nobjection from evidential decision theory (Draper and Pust 2008).\n",
