    "main_text": "Systematic Considerations || Information and Symbolic Computation\n5.2 Information and Symbolic Computation\n\nRecursive functions are abstract relations defined on natural numbers.\nIn principle they can be defined without any reference to space and\ntime. Such functions must be distinguished from the\noperations that we use to compute them. These operations\nmainly depend on the type of symbolic representations that we\nchoose for them. We can represent the number seven as unary number\n\\(|||||||\\), binary number 111, Roman number VII, or Arabic number 7\nand depending on our choice other types of sequential symbol\nmanipulation can be used to compute the addition two plus five is\nseven, which can be represented as: \n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n|| + ||||| & = ||||||| \\\\\n10 + 101 &  = 111 \\\\\n\\textrm{II} + \\textrm{V} & = \\textrm{VII}\\\\\n2 + 5 &= 7 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n Consequently we can\nread these four sentences as four statements of the same\nmathematical truth, or as statements specifying the results of four\ndifferent operations. \n\n\nObservation: There are (at least) two different perspectives\nfrom which we can study the notion of computation. The semantics of\nthe symbols is different under these interpretations. \n\nThe Recursive Function Paradigm studies\ncomputation in terms of abstract functions on natural\nnumbers outside space and time. When interpreted as a\nmathematical fact, the \\(+\\) sign in \\(10 + 101 = 111\\) signifies the\nmathematical function called addition and the \\(=\\) sign\nspecifies equality. \nThe Symbol Manipulation Paradigm studies\ncomputation in terms of sequential operations on spatial\nrepresentations of strings of symbols. When interpreted as an\noperation the \\(+\\) sign in \\(10 + 101 = 111\\) signifies the input\nfor a sequential process of symbol manipulation and the \\(=\\)\nsign specifies the result of that operation or\noutput. Such an algorithm could have the following form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tt{   10}\\\\ \n\\tt{+ 101}\\\\ \\hline\n\\tt{  111}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n \n\n\n\nThis leads to the following tentative definition:\n\nDefinition: Deterministic Computing on a Macroscopic\nScale can be defined as the local, sequential, manipulation of\ndiscrete objects according to deterministic rules. \n\nIn nature there are many other ways to perform such computations. One\ncould use an abacus, study chemical processes or simply manipulate\nsequences of pebbles on a beach. The fact that the objects we\nmanipulate are discrete together with the observation that the dataset\nis self-referential implies that the data domain is in principle\nDedekind Infinite:\n\nDefinition: A set S is Dedekind Infinite if it\nhas a bijection \\(f: S \\rightarrow S^{\\prime}\\) to a proper subset\n\\(S^{\\prime} \\subset S\\). \n\nSince the data elements are discrete and finite the data domain will\nbe countable infinite and therefore isomorphic to the set of natural\nnumbers. \n\nDefinition: An infinite set S is\ncountable if there exists a bijection with the set of natural\nnumbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). \n\nFor infinite countable sets the notion of information is defined as\nfollows: \n\n\nDefinition: Suppose S is countable and\ninfinite and the function \\(f:S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) defines a\none-to-one correspondence, then: \n\\[I(a\\mid S,f) = \\log f(a)\\]\n i.e., the amount of\ninformation in an index of a in S given f. \n\n\nNote that the correspondence f is specified explicitly. As soon\nas such an index function is defined for a class of objects in the\nreal world, the manipulation of these objects can be interpreted a\nform of computing.\n5.2.1 Turing machines\n\nOnce we choose a finite set of symbols and our operational rules the\nsystem starts to produce statements about the world.\n\n\nObservation: The meta-sentence:\n\n\nThe sign \u201c0\u201d is the symbol for zero.\n\n\nspecifies semantic information in the same sense as the\nstatement \\(e \\in A\\) does for sets (see\n section 6.6).\n The statement is wellformed, meaningful and\ntruthful. \n\n\nWe can study symbol manipulation in general on an abstract level,\nwithout any semantic implications. Such a theory was published by Alan\nTuring (1912\u20131954). Turing developed a general theory of\ncomputing focusing on the actual operations on symbols a mathematician\nperforms (Turing 1936). For him a computer was an abstraction of a\nreal mathematician sitting behind a desk, receiving problems written\ndown on an in-tray (the inut), solving them according to fixed rules\n(the process) and leaving them to be picked up in an out-tray (the\noutput). \n\nTuring first formulated the notion of a general theory of computing\nalong these lines. He proposed abstract machines that operate on\ninfinite tapes with three symbols: blank \\((b)\\), zero \\((0)\\) and one\n\\((1)\\). Consequently the data domain for Turing machines is the set\nof relevant tape configurations, which can be associated with the set\nof binary strings, consisting of zero\u2019s and one\u2019s. The\nmachines can read and write symbols on the tape and they have a\ntransition function that determines their actions under various\nconditions. On an abstract level Turing machines operate like\nfunctions. \n\nDefinition: If \\(T_i\\) is a Turing machine\nwith index i and x is a string of zero\u2019s and\none\u2019s on the tape that function as the input then\n\\(T_i(x)\\) indicates the tape configuration after the machine has\nstopped, i.e., its output. \n\nThere is an infinite number of Turing machines. Turing discovered that\nthere are so-called universal Turing machines \\(U_j\\) that can emulate\nany other Turing machine \\(T_i\\). \n\nDefinition: The expression \\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)\\)\ndenotes the result of the emulation of the computation \\(T_i(x)\\) by\n\\(U_j\\) after reading the self-delimiting description\n\\(\\overline{T_i}\\) of machine \\(T_j\\). \n\nThe self-delimiting code is necessary because the input for \\(U_j\\) is\ncoded as one string \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\). The universal machine \\(U_j\\)\nseparates the input string \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\) in to its two\nconstituent parts: the description of the machine \\(\\overline{T_i}\\)\nand the input for this machine x. \n\nThe self-referential nature of general computational systems allows us\nto construct machines that emulate other machines. This suggests the\npossible existence of a \u2018super machine\u2019 that emulates all\npossible computations on all possible machines and predicts their\noutcome. Using a technique called diagonalization, where one analyzes\nan enumeration of all possible machines running on descriptions of all\npossible machines, Turing proved that such a machine can not exist.\nMore formally: \n\nTheorem: There is no Turing machine that predicts for\nany other Turing machine whether it stops on a certain input or not.\n\n\nThis implies that for a certain universal machine \\(U_i\\) the set of\ninputs on which it stops in finite time, is uncomputable. In recent\nyears the notion of infinite computations on Turing machines has also\nbeen studied (Hamkins and Lewis 2000.) Not every machine will stop on\nevery input, but in some case infinite computations compute useful\noutput (consider the infinite expansion of the number pi). \n\nDefinition: The Halting set is the set of\ncombinations of Turing machines \\(T_i\\) and inputs x such that\nthe computation \\(T_i(x)\\) stops. \n\nThe existence of universal Turing machines indicates that the class\nembodies a notion of universal computing: any computation\nthat can be performed on a specific Turing machine can also be\nperformed on any other universal Turing machine. This is the\nmathematical foundation of the concept of a general programmable\ncomputer. These observations have bearing on the theory of\ninformation: certain measures of information, like Kolmogorov\ncomplexity, are defined, but not computable. \n\nThe proof of the existence uncomputable functions in the class of\nTuring machines is similar to the incompleteness result of G\u00f6del\nfor elementary arithmetic. Since Turing machines were defined to study\nthe notion of computation and thus contain elementary arithmetic. The\nclass of Turing machines is in itself rich enough to express:\nUniversality, Negation and Self-reference.\nConsequently Turing machines can model universal negative statements\nabout themselves. Turing\u2019s uncomputability proof is also\nmotivated by the liars paradox, and the notion of a machine that stops\non a certain input is similar to the notion of a proof that exists for\na certain statement. At the same time Turing machines satisfy the\nconditions of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem: they can be modeled as a\nformal system F that contains elementary Peano arithmetic.\n\nObservation: Since they can emulate each other, the\nRecursive Function Paradigm and the Symbol Manipulation\nParadigm have the same computational strength. Any\nfunction that can be computed in one paradigm can also by definition\nbe computed in the other. \n\nThis insight can be generalized:\n\nDefinition: An infinite set of computational\nfunctions is Turing complete if it has the same computational\npower as the general class of Turing machines. In this case it is\ncalled Turing equivalent. Such a system is, like the class of Turing\nmachines, universal: it can emulate any computable function. \n\nThe philosophical implications of this observation are strong and\nrich, not only for the theory of computing but also for our\nunderstanding of the concept of information. \n5.2.2 Universality and invariance\n\nThere is an intricate ration between the notion of universal computing\nand that of information. Precisely the fact that Turing Systems are\nuniversal allows us to say that they process information, because\ntheir universality entails invariance:\n\n\nSmall Invariance Theorem: The concept of information\nin a string x measured as the length of the smallest string of\nsymbols s of a program for a universal Turing machine U\nsuch that \\(U(s)= x\\) is invariant, modulo an additive constant, under\nselection of different universal Turing machines \n\nProof: The proof is simple and relevant for\nphilosophy of information. Let \\(l(x)\\) be the length of the string of\nsymbols x. Suppose we have two different universal Turing\nmachines \\(U_j\\) and \\(U_k\\). Since they are universal they can both\nemulate the computation \\(T_i(x)\\) of Turing machine \\(T_i\\) on input\nx: \n\\[U_j(\\overline{T}_i^jx)\\]\n \n\\[U_k(\\overline{T}_i^kx)\\]\n\n\nHere \\(l(\\overline{T}_i^j)\\) is the length of the code for \\(T_i\\) on\n\\(U_j\\) and \\(l(\\overline{T}_i^k)\\) is the length of the code for\n\\(T_i\\) on \\(U_k\\). Suppose \\(l(\\overline{T}_i^jx) \\ll\nl(\\overline{T}_i^kx)\\), i.e., the code for \\(T_i\\) on \\(U_k\\) is much\nless efficient that on \\(U_j\\). Observe that the code for \\(U_j\\) has\nconstant length, i.e., \\(l(\\overline{U}_j^k)=c\\). Since \\(U_k\\) is\nuniversal we can compute:  \n\\[U_k(\\overline{U}_j^k \\ \\overline{T}_i^jx)\\]\n\n\nThe length of the input for this computation is:  \n\\[l(\\overline{U}_j^k \\ \\overline{T}_i^jx) = c + l(\\overline{T}_i^jx)\\]\n\n\nConsequently the specification of the input for the computation\n\\(T_i(x)\\) on the universal machine \\(U_k\\) never needs to longer than\na constant. \\(\\Box\\) \n\n\nThis proof forms the basis of the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and\nis originally due to Solomonoff (1964a,b) and discovered independently\nby Kolmogorov (1965) and Chaitin (1969). Note that this notion of\ninvariance can be generalized over the class of Turing Complete\nSystems:\n\n\nBig Invariance Theorem: The concept of information\nmeasured in terms of the length of the input of a computation is\ninvariant, modulo an additive constant, for for Turing Complete\nsystems. \n\nProof: Suppose we have a Turing Complete system\nF. By Definition any computation \\(T_i(x)\\) on a Turing machine\ncan be emulated in F and vice versa. There will be a special\nuniversal Turing machine \\(U_F\\) that emulates the computation\n\\(T_i(x)\\) in F: \\(U_F(\\overline{T}_i^Fx)\\). In principle\n\\(\\overline{T}_i^F\\) might use a very inefficient way to code programs\nsuch that \\(\\overline{T}_i^F\\) can have any length. Observe that the\ncode for any other universal machine \\(U_j\\) emulated by \\(U_F\\) has\nconstant length, i.e., \\(l(\\overline{U}_j^F)=c\\). Since \\(U_F\\) is\nuniversal we can also compute:  \n\\[U_F(\\overline{U}_j^F \\ \\overline{T}_i^jx)\\]\n\n\nThe length of the input for this computation is: \n\\[l(\\overline{U}_j^F \\ \\overline{T}_i^jx) = c + l(\\overline{T}_i^jx)\\]\n\nConsequently the specification of the input for the computation\n\\(T_i(x)\\) on the universal machine \\(U_F\\) never needs to be longer\nthan a constant. \\(\\Box\\) \n\n\nHow strong this result is becomes clear when we analyze the class of\nTuring complete systems in more detail. In the first half of the\ntwentieth century three fundamentally different proposals for a\ngeneral theory of computation were formulated: G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrecursive functions ( G\u00f6del 1931), Turing\u2019s automata\n(Turing 1937) and Church\u2019s Lambda Calculus (Church 1936). Each\nof these proposals in its own way clarifies aspects of the notion of\ncomputing. Later much more examples followed. The class of Turing\nequivalent systems is diverse. Apart from obvious candidates like all\ngeneral purpose programming languages (C, Fortran, Prolog, etc.) it\nalso contains some unexpected elements like various games (e.g.,\nMagic: The Gathering [Churchill 2012\n OIR]).\n The table below gives an overview of some conceptually interesting\nsystems: \n\n\nAn overview of some Turing Complete systems \n\n\nSystem\nData Domain \n\nGeneral Recursive Functions\nNatural Numbers \n\nTuring machines and their generalizations\nStrings of symbols \n\nDiophantine Equations\nIntegers \n\nLambda calculus\nTerms \n\nType-0 languages\nSentences \n\nBilliard Ball Computing\nIdeal Billiard Balls \n\nCellular automata\nCells in one dimension \n\nConway\u2019s game of life \nCells in two dimensions \n\n\n\nWe make the following: \n\nObservation: The class of Turing equivalent systems is open,\nbecause it is defined in terms of purely operational mappings between\ncomputations. \n\nA direct consequence of this observation is: \n\nObservation: The general theory of computation and\ninformation defined by the class of Complete Turing machines is\nontologically neutral. \n\nIt is not possible to derive any necessary qualities of computational\nsystems and data domains beyond the fact that they are general\nmathematical operations and structures. Data domains on which Turing\nequivalent systems are defined are not necessarily physical, nor\ntemporal, nor spatial, not binary or digital. At any moment a new\nmember for the class can be introduced. We know that there are\ncomputational systems that are weaker than the class of Turing\nmachines (e.g., regular languages). We cannot rule out the possibility\nthat one-day we come across a system that is stronger. The thesis that\nsuch a system does not exist is known as the Church-Turing thesis (see\nentry on\n Church-Turing thesis):\n\nChurch-Turing Thesis: The class of Turing machines\ncharacterizes the notion of algorithmic computing exactly. \n\nWe give an overview of the arguments for and against the thesis:\n\nArguments in favor of the thesis: The theory of Turing\nmachines seems to be the most general theory possible that we can\nformulate since it is based on a very limited set of assumptions about\nwhat computing is. The fact that it is universal also points in the\ndirection of its generality. It is difficult to conceive in what sense\na more powerful system could be \u201cmore\u201d universal. Even if\nwe could think of such a more powerful system, the in- and output for\nsuch a system would have to be finite and discrete and the computation\ntime also finite. So, in the end, any computation would have the form\nof a finite function between finite data sets, and, in principle, all\nsuch relations can be modeled on Turing machines. The fact that all\nknown systems of computation we have defined so far have the same\npower also corroborates the thesis. \n\nArguments against the thesis: The thesis is, in its present\nform, unprovable. The class of Turing Complete systems is open. It is\ndefined on the basis of the existence of equivalence relations between\nknown systems. In this sense it does not define the notion of\ncomputing intrinsically. It doesn\u2019t not provide us with a\nphilosophical theory that defines what computing exactly is.\nConsequently it does not allow us to exclude any system from the class\na priori. At any time a proposal for a notion of computation\nmight emerge that is fundamentally stronger. What is more, nature\nprovides us with stronger notions of computing in the form of quantum\ncomputing. Quantum bits are really a generalization of the normal\nconcept of bits that is associated with symbol manipulation, although\nin the end quantum computing does not seem to necessitate us to\nredefine the notion of computing so far. We can never rule out that\nresearch in physics, biology or chemistry will define systems that\nwill force us to do so. Indeed various authors have suggested such\nsystems but there is currently no consensus on convincing candidates\n(Davis 2006). Dershowitz and Gurevich (2008) claim to have vindicated\nthe hypothesis, but this result is not generally accepted (see the\ndiscussion on \u201cComputability \u2013 What would it mean to\ndisprove the Church-Turing thesis\u201d, in the\n Other Internet Resources [OIR]).\n \n\nBeing Turing complete seems to be quite a natural condition for a\n(formal) system. Any system that is sufficiently rich to represent the\nnatural numbers and elementary arithmetical operations is Turing\ncomplete. What is needed is a finite set of operations defined on a\nset of discrete finite data elements that is rich enough to make the\nsystem self-referential: its operations can be described by its data\nelements. This explains, in part, why we can use mathematics to\ndescribe our world. The abstract notion of computation defined as\nfunctions on numbers in the abstract world mathematics and the\nconcrete notion of computing by manipulation objects in our every day\nworld around us coincide. The concepts of information end computation\nimplied by the Recursive Function Paradigm and the Symbol\nManipulation Paradigm are the same. \n\nObservation: If one accepts the fact that the Church-Turing\nthesis is open, this implies that the question about the existence of\na universal notion of information is also open. At this stage of the\nresearch it is not possible to specify the a priori\nconditions for such a general theory. \n5.3 Quantum Information and Beyond\n\nWe have a reasonable understanding of the concept of classical\ncomputing, but the implications of quantum physics for computing and\ninformation may determine the philosophical research agenda for\ndecades to come if not longer. Still it is already clear that the\nresearch has repercussions for traditional philosophical positions:\nthe Laplacian view (Laplace 1814 [1902]) that the universe is\nessentially deterministic seems to be falsified by empirical\nobservations. Quantum random generators are commercially available\n(see Wikipedia entry on Hardware random number generator\n [OIR])\n and quantum fluctuations do affect neurological, biological and\nphysical processes at a macroscopic scale (Albrecht & Phillips\n2014). Our universe is effectively a process that generates\ninformation permanently. Classical deterministic computing seems to be\ntoo weak a concept to understand its structure. \n\nStandard computing on a macroscopic scale can be defined as local,\nsequential, manipulation of discrete objects according to\ndeterministic rules. Is has a natural interpretation in\noperations on the set of natural numbers N and a natural\nmeasurement function in the log operation \\(\\log: \\mathbb{N}\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) associating a real number to every natural\nnumber. The definition gives us an adequate information measure for\ncountable infinite sets, including number classes like the integers\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), closed under subtraction, and the rational\nnumbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), closed under division.\n\nThe operation of multiplication with the associated\nlogarithmic function characterizes our intuitions about\nadditivity of the concept of information exactly. It leads to a\nnatural bijection between the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)\nand the set of multisets of numbers (i.e., sets of prime factors). The\nnotion of a multiset is associated with the properties of\ncommutativity and associativity. This program can be\nextended to other classes of numbers when we study division algebras\nin higher dimensions. The following table gives an overview of some\nrelevant number classes together with the properties of the\noperation of multiplication for these classes: \n\n\nNumber Class\nSymbol\nDimen\u00adsions\nCoun\u00adtable\nLinear\nCommu\u00adtative\nAssoci\u00adative \n\nNatural numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\)\n1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes \n\n Integers\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes \n\nRational numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)\n1\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes \n\nReal numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\)\n1\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes \n\nComplex numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)\n2\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes \n\n Quaternions \n\\(\\mathbb{H}\\)\n4\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes \n\n Octonions \n\\(\\mathbb{O}\\)\n8\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo \n\n\nThe table is ordered in terms of increasing generality. Starting from\nthe set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), various extensions are\npossible taking into account closure under subtraction,\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), and division, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). This are the number\nclasses for which we have adequate finite symbolic representations on\na macroscopic scale. For elements of the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)\nsuch a representations are not available. The real numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) introduce the aspect of manipulation of infinite\namounts of information in one operation.\n\nObservation: For almost all \\(e \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) we\nhave \\(I(e) = \\infty\\). \n\nMore complex division algebras can be defined when we introduce\nimaginary numbers as negative squares \\(i^2 = -1\\). We can now define\ncomplex numbers: \\(a + bi\\), where a is the real part and\n\\(bi\\) the imaginary part. Complex numbers can be interpreted as\nvectors in a two dimensional plane. Consequently they lack the notion\nof a strict linear order between symbols. Addition is quite\nstraightforward: \n\\[(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + b) + (c + d)i\\]\n\n\nMultiplication follows the normal distribution rule but the result is\nless intuitive since it involves a negative term generated by\n\\(i^2\\): \n\\[(a + bi) (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i\\]\n\n\nIn this context multiplication ceases to be a purely extensive\noperation:\n\nMore complicated numbers systems with generalizations of this type of\nmultiplication in 4 and 8 dimensions can be defined. Kervaire (1958)\nand Bott & Milnor (1958) independently proved that the only four\ndivision algebras built on the reals are \\(\\mathbb{R}\\),\n\\(\\mathbb{C}\\), \\(\\mathbb{H}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{O}\\), so the table gives\na comprehensive view of all possible algebra\u2019s that define a\nnotion of extensiveness. For each of the number classes in the table a\nseparate theory of information measurement, based on the properties of\nmultiplication, can be developed. For the countable classes\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) these theories ware\nequivalent to the standard concept of information implied by the\nnotion of Turing equivalence. Up to the real numbers these theories\nsatisfy our intuitive notions of extensiveness of information. For\ncomplex numbers the notion of information efficiency of\nmultiplication is destroyed. The quaternions lack the property of\ncommutativity and the octonions that of\nassociativity. These models are not just abstract\nconstructions since the algebras play an important role in our\ndescriptions of nature:\n\nComplex numbers are used to specify the mathematical models of\nquantum physics (Nielsen & Chuang 2000).\nQuaternions do the same for Einstein\u2019s special theory of\nrelativity (De Leo 1996).\nSome physicists believe octonions form a theoretical basis for a\nunified theory of strong and electromagnetic forces (e.g., Furey\n2015).\n\n\nWe briefly discuss the application of vector spaces in quantum\nphysics. Classical information is measured in bits. Implementation of\nbits in nature involves macroscopic physical systems with at least two\ndifferent stable states and a low energy reversible transition process\n(i.e., switches, relays, transistors). The most fundamental way to\nstore information in nature on an atomic level involves qubits. The\nqubit is described by a state vector in a two-level quantum-mechanical\nsystem, which is formally equivalent to a two-dimensional vector space\nover the complex numbers (Von Neumann 1932; Nielsen & Chuang\n2000). Quantum algorithms have, in some cases, a fundamentally lower\ncomplexity (e.g., Shor\u2019s algorithm for factorization of integers\n(Shor 1997)).\n\n\nDefinition: The quantum bit, or\nqubit, is a generalization of the classical bit. The quantum\nstate of qubit is represented as the linear superposition of two\northonormal basis vectors: \n\\[\\ket{0} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\ket{1} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n\nHere the so-called Dirac or \u201cbra-ket\u201d notion is used:\nwhere \\(\\ket{0}\\) and \\(\\ket{1}\\) are pronounced as \u201cket\n0\u201d and \u201cket 1\u201d. The two vectors together form the\ncomputational basis \\(\\{\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}\\}\\), which defines a\nvector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. A combination of\nn qubits is represented by a superposition vector in a\n\\(2^n\\) dimensional Hilbert space, e.g.: \n\\[\\ket{00} =  \\begin{bmatrix}1\n\\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\ket{01} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\ket{10} =  \\begin{bmatrix}0\n\\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\ket{11} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 1 \n\\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n\nA pure qubit is a coherent superposition of the basis states:\n \n\\[\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are complex numbers, with the\nconstraint: \n\\[|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1\\]\n\n\nIn this way the values can be interpreted as probabilities:\n\\(|\\alpha|^2\\) is the probability that the qubit has value 0 and\n\\(|\\beta|^2\\) is the probability that the qubit has value 1. \n\n\nUnder this mathematical model our intuitions about computing as local,\nsequential, manipulation of discrete objects according to\ndeterministic rules evolve in to a much richer paradigm:\n\n Infinite information  The introduction of\nreal numbers facilitates the manipulation of objects of\ninfinite descriptive complexity, although there is currently no\nindication that this expressivity is actually necessary in quantum\nphysics. \n Non-classical probability Complex\nnumbers facilitate a richer notion of extensiveness in which\nprobabilities cease to be classical. The third axiom of Kolmogorov\nloses its validity in favor of probabilities that enhance or suppress\neach other, consequently extensiveness of information is lost. \n Superposition and Entanglement  The\nrepresentation of qubits in terms of complex high dimensional vector\nspaces implies that qubits cease to be isolated discrete objects.\nQuantum bits can be in superposition, a situation in which they are in\ntwo discrete states at the same time. Quantum bits fluctuate and\nconsequently they generate information. Moreover quantum\nstates of qubits can be correlated even when the information bearers\nare separated by a long distance in space. This phenomenon, known as\nentanglement destroys the property of locality of\nclassical computing (see the entry on\n quantum entanglement and information).\n \n\n\nFrom this analysis it is clear that the description of our universe at\nvery small (and very large) scales involves mathematical models that\nare alien to our experience of reality in everyday life. The\nproperties that allow us to understand the world (the existence of\nstable, discrete objects that preserve their identity in space and\ntime) seem to be emergent aspects of a much more complex\nreality that is incomprehensible to us outside its mathematical\nformulation. Yet, at a macroscopic level, the universe facilitates\nelementary processes, like counting, measuring lengths, and the\nmanipulation of symbols, that allow us to develop a consistent\nhierarchy of mathematical models some of which seems to describe the\ndeeper underlying structure of reality. \n\nIn a sense the same mathematical properties that drove the development\nof elementary accounting systems in Mesopotamia four thousand years\nago, still help us to penetrate in to the world of subatomic\nstructures. In the past decennia information seems to have become a\nvital concept in physics. Seth Lloyd and others (Zuse 1969; Wheeler\n1990; Schmidhuber 1997b; Wolfram 2002; Hutter 2010) have analyzed\ncomputational models of various physical systems. The notion of\ninformation seems to play a major role in the analysis of black holes\n(Lloyd & Ng 2004; Bekenstein 1994\n [OIR]).\n Erik Verlinde (2011, 2017) has proposed a theory in which gravity is\nanalyzed in terms of information. For the moment these models seem to\nbe purely descriptive without any possibility of empirical\nverification. \n6. Anomalies, Paradoxes, and Problems\n\nSome of the fundamental issues in philosophy of Information are\nclosely related to existing philosophical problems, others seem to be\nnew. In this paragraph we discuss a number of observations that may\ndetermine the future research agenda. Some relevant questions are:\n\nAre there uniquely identifying descriptions that do not contain\nall information about the object they refer to?\nDoes computation create new information? \nIs there a difference between construction and systematic search?\n\n\n\nSince Frege most mathematicians seem to believe that the answer to the\nfirst question is positive (Frege 1879, 1892). The descriptions\n\u201cThe morning star\u201d and \u201cThe evening star\u201d are\nassociated with procedures to identify the planet Venus, but\nthey do not give access to all information about the object itself. If\nthis were so the discovery that the evening star is in fact also the\nmorning star would be uninformative. If we want to maintain this\nposition we get into conflict, because in terms of information theory\nthe answer to the second question is negative (see\n section 5.1.7).\n Yet this observation is highly counter intuitive, because it implies\nthat we never can construct new information on the basis of\ndeterministic computation, which leads to the third question. These\nissues cluster around one of the fundamental open problems of\nPhilosophy of Information: \n\nOpen problem What is the interaction between\nInformation and Computation? \n\nWhy would we compute at all, if according to our known information\nmeasures, deterministic computing does not produce new information?\nThe question could be rephrased as: should we use Kolmogorov or Levin\ncomplexity (Levin 1973, 1974, 1984) as our basic information measure?\nIn fact both choices lead to relevant, but fundamentally different,\ntheories of information. When using the Levin measure, computing\ngenerates information and the answer to the three questions above is a\n\u201cyes\u201d, when using Kolmogorov this is not the case. The\nquestions are related to many problems both in mathematics and\ncomputer science. Related issues like approximation, computability and\npartial information are also studied in the context of Scott domains\n(Abramsky & Jung 1994). Below we discuss some relevant\nobservations. \n6.1 The Paradox of Systematic Search\n\nThe essence of information is the fact that it reduces uncertainty.\nThis observation leads to problems in opaque contexts, for instance,\nwhen we search an object. This is illustrated by Meno\u2019s paradox\n(see entry on\n epistemic paradoxes):\n\n\nAnd how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not\nknow? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you\nfind what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing\nwhich you did not know? (Plato, Meno, 80d1-4) \n\n\nThe paradox is related to other open problems in computer science and\nphilosophy. Suppose that John is looking for a unicorn. It is very\nunlikely that unicorns exist, so, in terms of Shannon\u2019s theory,\nJohn gets a lot of information if he finds one. Yet from a descriptive\nKolmogorov point of view, John does not get new information, since he\nalready knows what unicorns are. The related paradox of systematic\nsearch might be formulated as follows:\n\n\nAny information that can be found by means of systematic search has no\nvalue, since we are certain to find it, given enough time.\nConsequently information only has value as long as we are uncertain\nabout its existence, but then, since we already know what we are\nlooking for, we get no new information when we find out that it\nexists. \n\nExample: Goldbach conjectured in 1742 that every even\nnumber bigger than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Until\ntoday this conjecture remains unproved. Consider the term \u201cThe\nfirst number that violates Goldbach\u2019s conjecture\u201d. It does\nnot give us all information about the number, since the number might\nnot exist. The prefix \u201cthe first\u201d ensures the description,\nif it exists, is unique, and it gives us an algorithm to find the\nnumber. It is a partial uniquely identifying description.\nThis algorithm is only effective if the number really exists,\notherwise it will run forever. If we find the number this will be\ngreat news, but from the perspective of descriptive complexity the\nnumber itself will be totally uninteresting, since we already know the\nrelevant properties to find it. Observe that, even if we have a number\nn that is a counter example to Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, it\nmight be difficult to verify this: we might have to check almost all\nprimes \\( \\leq n\\). This can be done effectively (we will\nalways get a result) but not, as far as we know, efficiently\n(it might take \u201cclose\u201d to n different computations)\n. \n\n\nA possible solution is to specify the constraint that it is\nillegal to measure the information content of an object in\nterms of partial descriptions, but this would destroy our theory of\ndescriptive complexity. Note that the complexity of an object is the\nlength of the shortest program that produces an object on a universal\nTuring machine. In this sense the phrase \u201cthe first number that\nviolates Goldbach\u2019s conjecture\u201d is a perfect description\nof a program, and it adequately measures the descriptive complexity of\nsuch a number. The short description reflects the fact that the\nnumber, if it exists, is very special, and thus it has a high\npossibility to occur in some mathematical context. \n\nThere are relations which well-studied philosophical problems like the\nAnselm\u2019s ontological argument for God\u2019s existence and the\nKantian counter claim that existence is not a predicate. In order to\navoid similar problems Russell proposed to interpret unique\ndescriptions existentially (Russell 1905): A sentence like \u201cThe\nking of France is bald\u201d would have the following logical\nstructure:  \n\\[\\exists (x) (KF(x) \\wedge \\forall (y)(KF(y) \\rightarrow x=y) \\wedge B(x))\\]\n\n\nThis interpretation does not help us to analyze decision problems that\ndeal with existence. Suppose the predicate L is true of\nx if I\u2019m looking for x, then the logical structure\nof the phrase \u201cI\u2019m looking for the king of France\u201d\nwould be:  \n\\[\\exists (x) (KF(x) \\wedge\n\\forall (y)(KF(y) \\rightarrow x=y) \\wedge L(x)),\\]\n\n\ni.e., if the king of France does not exist it cannot be true that I am\nlooking for him, which is unsatisfactory. Kripke (1971) criticized\nRussell\u2019s solution and proposed his so-called causal theory of\nreference in which a name get its reference by an initial act of\n\u201cbaptism\u201d. It then becomes a rigid designator\n(see entry on\n rigid designators)\n that can be followed back to that original act via causal chains. In\nthis way ad hoc descriptions like \u201cJohn was the fourth\nperson to step out of the elevator this morning\u201d can establish a\nsemantics for a name.\n\nIn the context of mathematics and information theory the corresponding\nconcept is that of names, constructive predicates and ad-hoc\npredicates of numbers. For any number there will be in principle an\ninfinite number of true statements about that number. Since elementary\narithmetic is incomplete there will be statements about numbers that\nare true but unprovable. In the limit a vanishing fragment of numbers\nwill have true predicates that actually compress their description.\nConsider the following statements:\n\n The symbol \u201c8\u201d is the name for the number eight.\n\n The number x is the 1000th Fibonacci number. \n The number x is the first number that violates the\nGoldbach conjecture. \n\n\nThe first statement simply specifies a name for a number. The second\nstatement gives a partial description that is constructive,\ninformation compressing and unique. The 1000th Fibonacci number has\n209 digits, so the description \u201cthe 1000th Fibonacci\nnumber\u201d is much more efficient than the actual name of the\nnumber. Moreover, we have an algorithm to construct the number. This\nmight not be that case for the description in the third statement. We\ndo not know whether the first number that violates the Goldbach\nconjecture exists, but if it does, the description might well be\nad hoc and thus gives us no clue to construct the number.\nThis rise to the conjecture that there are data compressing\neffective ad hoc descriptions:\n\nConjecture: There exist numbers that are compressed\nby non-constructive unique effective descriptions, i.e., the validity\nof the description can be checked effectively given the number, but\nthe number cannot be constructed effectively from the description,\nexcept by means of systematic search. \n\nThe conjecture is a more general variant of the so-called P vs. NP\nthesis (see\n section 6.3).\n If one replaces the term \u201ceffective\u201d with the term\n\u201cefficient\u201d one gets a formulation of the \\(\\textrm{P}\n\\neq \\textrm{NP}\\) thesis.\n6.2 Effective Search in Finite Sets\n\nWhen we restrict ourselves to effective search in finite sets, the\nproblem of partial descriptions, and construction versus search\nremain. It seems natural to assume that when one has a definition of a\nset of numbers, then one also has all the information about the\nmembers of the set and about its subsets, but this is not true. In\ngeneral the computation of the amount of information in a set of\nnumbers is a highly non-trivial issue. We give some results:\n\n\nLemma A subset \\(A \\subset S\\) of a set S can\ncontain more information conditional to the set than the set itself.\n\n\nProof: Consider the set S of all natural\nnumbers smaller than n. The descriptive complexity of this set\nin bits is \\( \\log_2 n + c\\). Now construct A by selecting half\nof the elements of S randomly. Observe that:  \n\\[I(A\\mid S)=\\log_2 {n \\choose {n/2}}\\]\n\n\nWe have: \n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \n\\frac{I(A\\mid S)}\n{n}\n = \n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \n\\frac{\\log_2 {n \\choose {n/2}}}\n{n}\n = 1\\]\n\n\nThe conditional descriptive complexity of this set will be: \\(I(A\\mid\nS) \\approx n + c \\gg \\log n + c\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nA direct consequence is that we can lose information when we merge two\nsets. An even stronger result is: \n\n\nLemma: An element of a set can contain more\ninformation than the set itself. \n\nProof: Consider the set S of natural numbers\nsmaller then \\(2^n\\). The cardinality of S is \\(2^n\\). The\ndescriptive complexity of this set is \\(\\log n + c\\) bits, but for\nhalf of the elements of S we need n bits to describe\nthem. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nIn this case the description of the set itself is highly compressible,\nbut it still contains non-compressible elements. When we merge or\nsplit sets of numbers, or add or remove elements, the effects on the\namount of information are in general hard to predict and might even be\nuncomputable: \n\n\nTheorem: Information is not monotone under set\ntheoretical operations \n\nProof: Immediate consequence of the lemmas above.\n\\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nThis shows how the notion of information pervades our everyday life.\nWhen John has two apples in his pocket it seems that he can do\nwhatever he wants with them, but, in fact, as soon as he chooses one\nof the two, he has created (new) information. The consequences for\nsearch problems are clear: we can always effectively perform bounded\nsearch on the elements and the set of subsets of a set. Consequently\nwhen we search for such a set of subsets by means of partial\ndescriptions then the result generates (new) information. This\nanalysis prima facie appears to force us to accept that in mathematics\nthere are simple descriptions that allow us to identify complex\nobjects by means of systematic search. When we look for the object we\nhave only little information about it, when we finally find it our\ninformation increases to the set of full facts about the object\nsearched. This is in conflict with our current theories of information\n(Shannon and Kolmogorov): any description that allows us to identify\nan object effectively by deterministic search contains all relevant\ninformation about the object. The time complexity of the search\nprocess then is irrelevant. \n6.3 The P versus NP Problem, Descriptive Complexity Versus Time Complexity\n\nIn the past decennia mathematicians have been pondering about a\nrelated question: suppose it would be easy to check whether I\nhave found what I\u2019m looking for, how hard can it be to find such\nan object? In mathematics and computer science there seems to be a\nconsiderable class of decision problems that cannot be solved\nconstructively in polynomial time, \\(t(x)=x^c\\), where c is a\nconstant and x is the length of the input), but only through\nsystematic search of a large part of the solution space, which might\ntake exponential time, \\(t(x)=c^x\\). This difference roughly coincides\nwith the separation of problems that are computationally feasible from\nthose that are not.\n\nThe issue of the existence of such problems has been framed as the\npossible equivalence of the class P of decision problems that can be\nsolved in time polynomial to the input to the class NP of problems for\nwhich the solution can be checked in time polynomial to the input.\n(Garey & Johnson 1979; see also Cook 2000\n [OIR]\n for a good introduction.) \n\nExample: A well-known example in the class NP is the\nso-called subset sum problem: given a finite set of natural\nnumbers S, is there a subset \\(S^{\\prime}\\subseteq S\\) that\nsums up to some number k? It is clear that when someone\nproposes a solution \\(X \\subseteq S\\) to this problem we can easily\ncheck whether the elements of X add up to k, but we\nmight have to check almost all subsets of S in order to find\nsuch a solution ourselves. \n\nThis is an example of a so-called decision problem. The answer is a\nsimple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, but it might be hard to\nfind the answer. Observe that the formulation of the question\nconditional to S has descriptive complexity \\(\\log k + c\\),\nwhereas most random subsets of S have a conditional descriptive\ncomplexity of \\(|S|\\). So any subset \\(S^{\\prime}\\) that adds up to\nk might have a descriptive complexity that is bigger then the\nformulation of the search problem. In this sense search seems to\ngenerate information. The problem is that if such a set exists the\nsearch process is bounded, and thus effective, which means that the\nphrase \u201cthe first subset of S that adds up to\nk\u201d is an adequate description. If \\(\\textrm{P} =\n\\textrm{NP}\\) then the Kolmogorov complexity and the Levin complexity\nof the set \\(S^{\\prime}\\) we find roughly coincide, if \\(P \\neq\n\\textit{NP}\\) then in some cases \\(Kt(S^{\\prime}) \\gg K(S^{\\prime})\\).\nBoth positions, the theory that search generates new information and\nthe theory that it does not, are counterintuitive from different\nperspectives.\n\nThe P vs. NP problem, that appears to be very hard, has been a rich\nsource of research in computer science and mathematics although\nrelatively little has been published on its philosophical relevance.\nThat a solution might have profound philosophical impact is\nillustrated by a quote from Scott Aaronson:\n\n\nIf P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than\nwe usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in\n\u201ccreative leaps,\u201d no fundamental gap between solving a\nproblem and recognizing the solution once it\u2019s found. Everyone\nwho could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could\nfollow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss\u2026. (Aaronson 2006\n\u2013 in the Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nIn fact, if \\(\\textrm{P}=\\textrm{NP}\\) then every object that has a\ndescription that is not too large and easy to check is also easy to\nfind. \n6.4 Model Selection and Data Compression\n\nIn current scientific methodology the sequential aspects of the\nscientific process are formalized in terms of the empirical cycle,\nwhich according to de Groot (1969) has the following stages:\n\nObservation: The observation of a phenomenon and inquiry\nconcerning its causes.\nInduction: The formulation of hypotheses\u2014generalized\nexplanations for the phenomenon.\n Deduction: The formulation of experiments that will test the\nhypotheses (i.e., confirm them if true, refute them if false).\n Testing: The procedures by which the hypotheses are tested and\ndata are collected.\n Evaluation: The interpretation of the data and the formulation of\na theory\u2014an abductive argument that presents the results of the\nexperiment as the most reasonable explanation for the phenomenon.\n\n\nIn the context of information theory the set of observations will be a\ndata set and we can construct models by observing regularities in this\ndata set. Science aims at the construction of true models of our\nreality. It is in this sense a semantical venture. In the 21-st\ncentury the process of theory formation and testing will for the\nlargest part be done automatically by computers working on large\ndatabases with observations. Turing award winner Jim Grey framed the\nemerging discipline of e-science as the fourth data-driven paradigm of\nscience. The others are empirical, theoretical and computational. As\nsuch the process of automatic theory construction on the basis of data\nis part of the methodology of science and consequently of philosophy\nof information (Adriaans & Zantinge 1996; Bell, Hey, & Szalay\n2009; Hey, Tansley, and Tolle 2009). Many well-known learning\nalgorithms, like decision tree induction, support vector machines,\nnormalized information distance and neural networks, use entropy based\ninformation measures to extract meaningful and useful models out of\nlarge data bases. The very name of the discipline Knowledge Discovery\nin Databases (KDD) is witness to the ambition of the Big Data research\nprogram. We quote:\n\n\nAt an abstract level, the KDD field is concerned with the development\nof methods and techniques for making sense of data. The basic problem\naddressed by the KDD process is one of mapping low-level data (which\nare typically too voluminous to understand and digest easily) into\nother forms that might be more compact (for example, a short report),\nmore abstract (for example, a descriptive approximation or model of\nthe process that generated the data), or more useful (for example, a\npredictive model for estimating the value of future cases). At the\ncore of the process is the application of specific data-mining methods\nfor pattern discovery and extraction. (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro,\n& Smyth 1996: 37)\n\n\nMuch of the current research focuses on the issue of selecting an\noptimal computational model for a data set. The theory of Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is an interesting methodological foundation to study\nlearning and theory construction as a form of data compression. The\nintuition is that the shortest theory that still explains the data is\nalso the best model for generalization of the observations. A crucial\ndistinction in this context is the one between one- and two-part\ncode optimization: \n\n\n\nOne-part Code Optimization: The methodological\naspects of the theory of Kolmogorov complexity become clear if we\nfollow its definition. We begin with a well-formed dataset y\nand select an appropriate universal machine \\(U_j\\). The expression\n\\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)= y\\) is a true sentence that gives us\ninformation about y. The first move in the development of a\ntheory of measurement is to force all expressiveness to the\ninstructional or procedural part of the sentence by a restriction to\nsentences that describe computations on empty input:  \n\\[U_j(\\overline{T_i}\\emptyset)= y\\]\n\n\nThis restriction is vital for the proof of invariance. From this, in\nprinciple infinite, class of sentences we can measure the length when\nrepresented as a program. We select the ones (there might be more than\none) of the form \\(\\overline{T_i}\\) that are shortest. The length\n\\(\\mathit{l}(\\overline{T_i})\\) of such a shortest description is a\nmeasure for the information content of y. It is asymptotic in\nthe sense that, when the data set y grows to an infinite\nlength, the information content assigned by the choice of another\nTuring machine will never vary by more than a constant in the limit.\nKolmogorov complexity measures the information content of a data set\nin terms of the shortest description of the set of instructions that\nproduces the data set on a universal computing device.\n\n\nTwo-part Code Optimization: Note that by restricting\nourselves to programs with empty input and the focus on the length\n of programs instead of their content we gain the\nquality of invariance for our measure, but we also lose a lot of\nexpressiveness. The information in the actual program that produces\nthe data set is neglected. Subsequent research therefore has focused\non techniques to make the explanatory power, hidden in the Kolmogorov\ncomplexity measure, explicit. \n\n\nA possible approach is suggested by an interpretation of Bayes\u2019\nlaw. If we combine Shannon\u2019s notion of an optimal code with\nBayes\u2019 law, we get a rough theory about optimal model selection.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) be a set of hypotheses and let x be a data\nset. Using Bayes\u2019 law, the optimal computational model under\nthis distribution would be:  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\nM_{\\textit{map}}(x) = \\textit{argmax}_{M \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\frac{P(M) P(x\\mid M)}{P(x)} \n\\end{equation} \\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to optimizing:  \n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\label{OptimalIbE} \\textit{argmin}_{M \\in \\mathcal{H}} - \\log P(M) - \\log P(x\\mid M) \\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(-\\log P(M)\\) can be interpreted as the length of the optimal\nmodel code in Shannon\u2019s sense and \\(- \\log P(x\\mid M)\\)\nas the length of the optimal data-to-model code; i.e., the\ndata interpreted with help of the model. This insight is canonized in\nthe so-called:\n\nMinimum Description Length (MDL) Principle: The best\ntheory to explain a data set is the one that minimizes the sum in bits\nof a description of the theory (model code) and of the data set\nencoded with the theory (the data to model code). \n\nThe MDL principle is often referred to as a modern version of\nOckham\u2019s razor (see entry on\n William of Ockham),\n although in its original form Ockham\u2019s razor is an ontological\nprinciple and has little to do with data compression (Long 2019). In\nmany cases MDL is a valid heuristic tool and the mathematical\nproperties of the theory have been studied extensively (Gr\u00fcnwald\n2007). Still MDL, Ockham\u2019s razor and two-part code optimization\nhave been the subject of considerable debate in the past decennia\n(e.g., Domingos 1998; McAllister 2003). \n\nThe philosophical implications of the work initiated by Solomonoff,\nKolmogorov and Chaitin in the sixties of the 20-th century are\nfundamental and diverse. The universal distribution m proposed\nby Solomonoff, for instance, codifies all possible mathematical\nknowledge and when updated on the basis of empirical observations\nwould in principle converge to an optimal scientific model of our\nworld. In this sense the choice of a universal Turing machine as basis\nfor our theory of information measurement has philosophical\nimportance, specifically for methodology of science. A choice for a\nuniversal Turing machine can be seen as a choice of a set of\nbias for our methodology. There are roughly two schools:\n\nPoor machine: choose a small universal Turing\nmachine. If the machine is small it is also general and universal,\nsince there is no room to encode any bias in to the machine. Moreover\na restriction to small machines gives small overhead when emulating\none machine on the other so the version of Kolmogorov complexity you\nget gives a measurement with a smaller asymptotic margin. Hutter\nexplicitly defends the choice of \u201cnatural\u201d small machines\n(Hutter 2005; Rathmanner & Hutter 2011), but also Li and\nVit\u00e1nyi (2019) seem to suggest the use of small models. \nRich machine: choose a big machine that\nexplicitly reflects what you already know about the world. For\nSolomonoff, the inventor of algorithmic complexity, the choice of a\nuniversal Turing machine is the choice for a universal prior. He\ndefends an evolutionary approach to learning in which an agent\nconstantly adapts the prior to what he already has discovered. The\nselection of your reference Turing machine uniquely characterizes your\na priori information (Solomonoff 1997). \n\n\nBoth approaches have their value. For rigid mathematical proofs the\npoor machine approach is often best. For practical applications on\nfinite data sets the rich model strategy often gets much better\nresults, since a poor machine would have to \u201cre-invent the\nwheel\u201d every time it compresses a data set. This leads to the\nconclusion that Kolmogorov complexity inherently contains a theory\nabout scientific bias and as such implies a methodology in which the\nclass of admissible universal models should be explicitly formulated\nand motivated a priori. In the past decennia there have been\na number of proposals to define a formal unit of measurement of the\namount of structural (or model-) information in a data set.\n\nAesthetic measure (Birkhoff 1950)\nSophistication (Koppel 1987; Antunes et al. 2006; Antunes &\nFortnow 2003)\nLogical Depth (Bennet 1988)\nEffective complexity (Gell-Mann, Lloyd 2003)\nMeaningful Information (Vit\u00e1nyi 2006)\nSelf-dissimilarity (Wolpert & Macready 2007)\nComputational Depth (Antunes et al. 2006)\nFacticity (Adriaans 2008)\n\n\nThree intuitions dominate the research. A string is\n\u201cinteresting\u201d when \u2026 \n\na certain amount of computation is involved in its creation\n(Sophistication, Computational Depth);\nthere is a balance between the model-code and the data-code under\ntwo-part code optimization (effective complexity, facticity);\nit has internal phase transitions (self-dissimilarity).\n\n\nSuch models penalize both maximal entropy and low information content.\nThe exact relationship between these intuitions is unclear. The\nproblem of meaningful information has been researched extensively in\nthe past years, but the ambition to formulate a universal method for\nmodel selection based on compression techniques seems to be misguided:\n\n\nObservation: A measure of meaningful information based on\ntwo-part code optimization can never be invariant in the\nsense of Kolmogorov complexity (Bloem et al. 2015, Adriaans 2020).\n\n\nThis appears to be the case even if we restrict ourselves to weaker\ncomputational models like total functions, but more research is\nnecessary. There seems to be no a priori mathematical\njustification for the approach, although two-part code optimization\ncontinues to be a valid approach in an empirical setting of data sets\nthat have been created on the basis of repeated observations.\nPhenomena that might be related to a theory of structural information\nand that currently are ill-understood are: phase transitions in the\nhardness of satisfiability problems related to their complexity (Simon\n& Dubois 1989; Crawford & Auton 1993) and phase transitions in\nthe expressiveness of Turing machines related to their complexity\n(Crutchfield & Young 1989, 1990; Langton 1990; Dufort &\nLumsden 1994). \n6.5 Determinism and Thermodynamics\n\nMany basic concepts of information theory were developed in the\nnineteenth century in the context of the emerging science of\nthermodynamics. There is a reasonable understanding of the\nrelationship between Kolmogorov Complexity and Shannon information (Li\n& Vit\u00e1nyi 2008; Gr\u00fcnwald & Vit\u00e1nyi 2008;\nCover & Thomas 2006), but the unification between the notion of\nentropy in thermodynamics and Shannon-Kolmogorov information is very\nincomplete apart from some very ad hoc insights\n(Harremo\u00ebs & Tops\u00f8e 2008; Bais & Farmer 2008).\nFredkin and Toffoli (1982) have proposed so-called billiard ball\ncomputers to study reversible systems in thermodynamics (Durand-Lose\n2002) (see the entry on\n information processing and thermodynamic entropy).\n Possible theoretical models could with high probability be\ncorroborated with feasible experiments (e.g., Joule\u2019s adiabatic\nexpansion, see Adriaans 2008). \n\nQuestions that emerge are:\n\nWhat is a computational process from a thermodynamical point of\nview? \n Can a thermodynamic theory of computing serve as a theory of\nnon-equilibrium dynamics? \nIs the expressiveness of real numbers necessary for a physical\ndescription of our universe? \n\n\nThese problems seem to be hard because 150 years of research in\nthermodynamics still leaves us with a lot of conceptual unclarities in\nthe heart of the theory of thermodynamics itself (see entry on\n thermodynamic asymmetry in time).\n\nReal numbers are not accessible to us in finite computational\nprocesses yet they do play a role in our analysis of thermodynamic\nprocesses. The most elegant models of physical systems are based on\nfunctions in continuous spaces. In such models almost all points in\nspace carry an infinite amount of information. Yet, the cornerstone of\nthermodynamics is that a finite amount of space has finite entropy.\nThere is, on the basis of the theory of quantum information, no\nfundamental reason to assume that the expressiveness of real numbers\nis never used in nature itself on this level. This problem is related\nto questions studied in philosophy of mathematics (an intuitionistic\nversus a more platonic view). The issue is central in some of the more\nphilosophical discussions on the nature of computation and information\n(Putnam 1988; Searle 1990). The problem is also related to the notion\nof phase transitions in the description of nature (e.g.,\nthermodynamics versus statistical mechanics) and to the idea of levels\nof abstraction (Floridi 2002, 2019). \n\nIn the past decade some progress has been made in the analysis of\nthese questions. A basic insight is that the interaction between time\nand computational processes can be understood at an abstract\nmathematical level, without the burden of some intended physical\napplication (Adriaans & van Emde Boas 2011). Central is the\ninsight that deterministic programs do not generate new information.\nConsequently deterministic computational models of physical systems\ncan never give an account of the growth of information or entropy in\nnature:\n\nObservation: The Laplacian assumption that the universe can\nbe described as a deterministic computer is, given the fundamental\ntheorem of Adriaans and van Emde Boas (2011) and the assumption that\nquantum physics as a essentially stochastic description of the\nstructure of our reality, incorrect. \n\nA statistical reduction of thermodynamics to a deterministic theory\nlike Newtonian physics leads to a notion of entropy that is\nfundamentally different from the information processed by\ndeterministic computers. From this perspective the mathematical models\nof thermodynamics, which are basically differential equations on\nspaces of real numbers, seem to operate on a level that is not\nexpressive enough. More advanced mathematical models, taking in to\naccount quantum effects, might resolve some of the conceptual\ndifficulties. At a subatomic level nature seems to be inherently\nprobabilistic. If probabilistic quantum effects play a role in the\nbehavior of real billiard balls, then the debate whether entropy\nincreases in an abstract gas, made out of ideal balls, seems a bit\nacademic. There is reason to assume that stochastic phenomena at\nquantum level are a source of probability at a macroscopic scale\n(Albrecht & Phillips 2014). From this perspective the universe is\na constant source of, literally, astronomical amounts of information\nat any scale. \n6.6 Logic and Semantic Information\n\nLogical and computational approaches to the understanding of\ninformation both have their roots in the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d\nthat characterized the philosophical research in the beginning of the\ntwentieth century and the elementary research questions originate from\nthe work of Frege (1879, 1892, see the entry on\n logic and information).\n The ambition to quantify information in sets of true\nsentences, as apparent in the work of researchers like Popper,\nCarnap, Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Chaitin, Rissanen, Koppel,\nSchmidthuber, Li, Vit\u00e1nyi and Hutter is an inherently semantic\nresearch program. In fact, Shannon\u2019s theory of information is\nthe only modern approach that explicitly claims to be non-semantic.\nMore recent quantitative information measures like Kolmogorov\ncomplexity (with its ambition to codify all scientific knowledge in\nterms of a universal distribution) and quantum information (with its\nconcept of observation of physical systems) inherently assume\na semantic component. At the same time it is possible to develop\nquantitative versions of semantic theories (see entry on\n semantic conceptions of information).\n \n\nThe central intuition of algorithmic complexity theory that an\nintension or meaning of an object can be a computation, was originally\nformulated by Frege (1879, 1892). The expressions \u201c1 + 4\u201d\nand \u201c2 + 3\u201d have the same extension (Bedeutung)\n\u201c5\u201d, but a different intension (Sinn). In this\nsense one mathematical object can have an infinity of different\nmeanings. There are opaque contexts in which such a distinction is\nnecessary. Consider the sentence \u201cJohn knows that \\(\\log_2 2^2 =\n2\\)\u201d. Clearly the fact that \\(\\log_2 2^2\\) represents a specific\ncomputation is relevant here. The sentence \u201cJohn knows that \\(2\n= 2\\)\u201d seems to have a different meaning.\n\nDunn (2001, 2008) has pointed out that the analysis of information in\nlogic is intricately related to the notions of intension and\nextension. The distinction between intension and extension is already\nanticipated in the\n Port Royal Logic\n (1662) and the writings of Mill (1843), Boole (1847) and Peirce\n(1868) but was systematically introduced in logic by Frege (1879,\n1892). In a modern sense the extension of a predicate, say\n\u201cX is a bachelor\u201d, is simply the set of bachelors\nin our domain. The intension is associated with the meaning of the\npredicate and allows us to derive from the fact that \u201cJohn is a\nbachelor\u201d the facts that \u201cJohn is male\u201d and\n\u201cJohn is unmarried\u201d. It is clear that this phenomenon has\na relation with both the possible world interpretation of modal\noperators and the notion of information. A bachelor is by necessity\nalso male, i.e., in every possible world in which John is a bachelor\nhe is also male, consequently: If someone gives me the information\nthat John is a bachelor I get the information that he is male and\nunmarried for free. \n\nThe possible world interpretation of modal operators (Kripke 1959) is\nrelated to the notion of \u201cstate description\u201d introduced by\nCarnap (1947). A state description is a conjunction that contains\nexactly one of each atomic sentence or its negation (see\n section 4.3).\n The ambition to define a good probability measure for state\ndescriptions was one of the motivations for Solomonoff (1960, 1997) to\ndevelop algorithmic information theory. From this perspective\nKolmogorov complexity, with its separation of data types (programs,\ndata, machines) and its focus on true sentences describing effects of\nprocesses is basically a semantic theory (Adriaans 2020). This is\nimmediately clear if we evaluate the expression: \n\\[U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)= y\\]\n\n\nAs is explained in\n section 5.2.1\n the expression \\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)\\) denotes the result of the\nemulation of the computation \\(T_i(x)\\) by \\(U_j\\) after reading the\nself-delimiting description \\(\\overline{T_i}\\) of machine \\(T_j\\).\nThis expression can be interpreted as a piece of semantic\ninformation in the context of the informational map (See\nentry on\n semantic conceptions of information)\n as follows: \n\nThe universal Turing machine \\(U_j\\) is a context\nis which the computation takes place. It can be interpreted as a\npossible computational world in a modal\ninterpretation of computational semantics.\nThe sequences of symbols \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\) and y are\nwell-formed data. \nThe sequence \\(\\overline{T_i}\\) is a self-delimiting\ndescription of a program and it can be interpreted as\na piece of well-formed instructional data.\nThe sequence \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\) is an intension.\nThe sequence y is the corresponding extension.\n\nThe expression \\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)= y\\) states the result of\nthe program \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\) in world \\(U_j\\) is y. It is a\ntrue sentence.\n\n\nThe logical structure of the sentence \\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)= y\\) is\ncomparable to a true sentence like: \n\nIn the context of empirical observations on planet earth, the bright\nstar you can see in the morning in the eastern sky is Venus \n\nMutatis mutandis one could develop the following\ninterpretation: \\(U_j\\) can be seen as a context that, for instance,\ncodifies a bias for scientific observations on earth,\ny is the extension Venus, \\(\\overline{T_i}x\\) is the\nintension \u201cthe bright star you can see in the morning\nin the eastern sky\u201d. The intension consists of \\(T_i\\), which\ncan be interpreted as some general astronomical observation routine\n(e.g., instructional data), and x provides the well-formed data\nthat tells one where to look (bright star in the morning in the\neastern sky). \n\nThis suggests a possible unification between more truth oriented\ntheories of information and computational approaches in terms of the\ninformational map presented in the entry of\n semantic conceptions of information.\n We delineate some research questions:\n\nWhat is a good logical system (or set of systems) that formalizes\nour intuitions of the relation between concepts like\n\u201cknowing\u201d, \u201cbelieving\u201d and \u201cbeing\ninformed of\u201d. There are proposals by: Dretske (1981), van\nBenthem (2006; van Benthem & de Rooij 2003), Floridi (2003, 2011)\nand others. A careful mapping of these concepts onto our current\nlandscape of known logics (structural, modal) might clarify the\nstrengths and weaknesses of different proposals. \nIt is unclear what the specific difference (in the\nAristotelian sense) is that separates environmental data from\nother data, e.g., if one uses pebbles on a beach to count the number\nof dolphins one has observed, then it might be impossible for the\nuninformed passer by to judge whether this collection of stones is\nenvironmental data or not.\nThe category of instructional data seems to be too narrow\nsince it pins us down on a specific interpretation of what computing\nis. For the most part Turing equivalent computational paradigms are\nnot instructional, although one might defend the view that programs\nfor Turing machines are such data.\nIt is unclear how we can cope with the ontological\nduality that is inherent to the self referential aspects of\nTuring complete systems: Turing machines operate on data that at\nthe same time act as representations of programs, i.e.,\ninstructional and non-instructional. \nIt is unclear how a theory that defines information exclusively in\nterms of true statements can deal with fundamental issues in quantum\nphysics. How can an inconsistent logical model in which\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is at the same time dead and alive\ncontain any information in such a theory? \n\n6.7 Meaning and Computation\n\nEver since Descartes, the idea that the meaningful world, we perceive\naround us, can be reduced to physical processes has been a predominant\ntheme in western philosophy. The corresponding philosophical\nself-reflection in history neatly follows the technical developments\nfrom: Is the human mind an automaton, to is the mind a Turing machine\nand, eventually, is the mind a quantum computer? It is not the place\nhere to discuss these matters extensively, but the corresponding\nproblem in philosophy of information is relevant:\n\nOpen problem: Can meaning be reduced to computation?\n\n\nThe question is interwoven with more general issues in philosophy and\nits answer directly forces a choice between a more\npositivistic or a more hermeneutical approach to\nphilosophy, with consequences for theory of knowledge, metaphysics,\naesthetics and ethics. It also effects direct practical decisions we\ntake on a daily basis. Should the actions of a medical doctor be\nguided by evidence based medicine or by the notion of\ncaritas? Is a patient a conscious human being that wants to\nlead a meaningful life, or is he ultimately just a system that needs\nto be repaired? \n\nThe idea that meaning is essentially a computational phenomenon may\nseem extreme, but here are many discussions and theories in science,\nphilosophy and culture that implicitly assume such a view. In popular\nculture, e.g., there is a remarkable collection of movies and books in\nwhich we find evil computers that are conscious of themselves (2001,\nA Space Odyssey), individuals that upload their consciousness\nto a computer (1992, The Lawnmower Man), and fight battles in\nvirtual realities (1999, The Matrix). In philosophy the\nposition of Bostrom (2003), who defends the view that it is very\nlikely that we already live in a computer simulation, is illustrative.\nThere are many ways to argue the pros and cons of the reduction of\nmeaning to computation. We give an overview of possible arguments for\nthe two extreme positions: \n\n\n\nMeaning is an emergent aspect of computation: Science is our\nbest effort to develop a valid objective theoretical description of\nthe universe based on intersubjectively verifiable repeated\nobservations. Science tells us that our reality at a small scale\nconsists of elementary particles whose behavior is described by exact\nmathematical models. At an elementary level these particles interact\nand exchange information. These processes are essentially\ncomputational. At this most basic level of description there is no\nroom for a subjective notion of meaning. There is no reason to deny\nthat we as human being experience a meaningful world, but as such this\nmust be an emergent aspect of nature. At a fundamental level it does\nnot exist. We can describe our universe as a big quantum computer. We\ncan estimate the information storage content of our universe to be\n\\(10^{92}\\) bits and the number of computational steps it made since\nthe big bang as \\(10^{123}\\) (Lloyd 2000; Lloyd & Ng 2004). As\nhuman beings we are just subsystems of the universe with an estimated\ncomplexity of roughly \\(10^{30}\\) bits. It might be technically\nimpossible, but there seems to be no theoretical objection against the\nidea that we can in principle construct an exact copy of a human\nbeing, either as a direct physical copy or as a simulation in a\ncomputer. Such an \u201cartificial\u201d person will experience a\nmeaningful world, but the experience will be emergent.  \n\n\nMeaning is ontologically rooted in our individual experience of\nthe world and thus irreducible: The reason scientific theories\neliminate most semantic aspects of our world, is caused by the very\nnature of methodology of science itself. The essence of meaning and\nthe associated emotions is that they are rooted in our individual\nexperience of the world. By focusing on repeated observations of\nsimilar events by different observers scientific methodology excludes\nthe possibility of an analysis of the concept of meaning a\npriori. Empirical scientific methodology is valuable in the sense\nthat it allows us to abstract from the individual differences of\nconscious observers, but there is no reason to reduce our ontology to\nthe phenomena studied by empirical science. Isolated individual events\nand observations are by definition not open to experimental analysis\nand this seems to be the point of demarcation between science and the\nhumanities. In disciplines like history, literature, visual art and\nethics we predominantly analyze individual events and individual\nobjects. The closer these are to our individual existence, the more\nmeaning they have for us. There is no reason to doubt the fact that\nsentences like \u201cGuernica is a masterpiece that shows the\natrocities of war\u201d or \u201cMcEnroe played such an inspired\nmatch that he deserved to win\u201d uttered in the right context\nconvey meaningful information. The view that this information content\nultimately should be understood in terms of computational processes\nseems too extreme to be viable. \n\n\nApart from that, a discipline like physics, that until recently\noverlooked about 68% of the energy in the universe and 27% of the\nmatter, that has no unified theory of elementary forces and only\nexplains the fundamental aspects of our world in terms of mathematical\nmodels that lack any intuitive foundation, for the moment does not\nseem to converge to a model that could be an adequate basis for a\nreductionistic metaphysics. \n\nAs soon as one defines information in terms of true statements, some\nmeanings become computational and others lack that feature. In the\ncontext of empirical science we can study groups of researchers that\naim at the construction of theories generalizing structural\ninformation in data sets of repeated observations. Such processes of\ntheory construction and intersubjective verification and\nfalsification have an inherent computational component. In fact,\nthis notion of intersubjective verification seems an essential element\nof mathematics. This is the main cause of the fact that central\nquestions of humanities are not open for quantitative analysis: We can\ndisagree on the question whether one painting is more beautiful than\nthe other, but not on the fact that there are two paintings. \n\nIt is clear that computation as a conceptual model pays a role in many\nscientific disciplines varying from cognition (Chater &\nVit\u00e1nyi 2003), to biology (see entry on\n biological information)\n and physics (Lloyd & Ng 2004; Verlinde 2011, 2017). Extracting\nmeaningful models out of data sets by means of computation is the\ndriving force behind the Big Data revolution (Adriaans & Zantinge\n1996; Bell, Hey, & Szalay 2009; Hey, Tansley, & Tolle 2009).\nEverything that multinationals like Google and Facebook\n\u201cknow\u201d about individuals is extracted from large data\nbases by means of computational processes, and it cannot be denied\nthat this kind of \u201cknowledge\u201d has a considerable amount of\nimpact on society. The research question \u201cHow can we construct\nmeaningful data out of large data sets by means of computation?\u201d\nis a fundamental meta-problem of science in the twenty-first century\nand as such part of philosophy of information, but there is no strict\nnecessity for a reductionistic view. \n7. Conclusion\n\nThe first domain that could benefit from philosophy of information is\nof course philosophy itself. The concept of information potentially\nhas an impact on almost all philosophical main disciplines, ranging\nfrom logic, theory of knowledge, to ontology and even ethics and\nesthetics (see introduction above). Philosophy of science and\nphilosophy of information, with their interest in the problem of\ninduction and theory formation, probably both could benefit from\ncloser cooperation (see\n 4.1 Popper: Information as degree of falsifiability).\n The concept of information plays an important role in the history of\nphilosophy that is not completely understood (see\n 2. History of the term and the concept of information).\n \n\nAs information has become a central issue in almost all of the\nsciences and humanities this development will also impact\nphilosophical reflection in these areas. Archaeologists, linguists,\nphysicists, astronomers all deal with information. The first thing a\nscientist has to do before he can formulate a theory is gathering\ninformation. The application possibilities are abundant. Datamining\nand the handling of extremely large data sets seems to be an essential\nfor almost every empirical discipline in the twenty-first century.\n\nIn biology we have found out that information is essential for the\norganization of life itself and for the propagation of complex\norganisms (see entry on\n biological information).\n One of the main problems is that current models do not explain the\ncomplexity of life well. Valiant has started a research program that\nstudies evolution as a form of computational learning (Valiant 2009)\nin order to explain this discrepancy. Aaronson (2013) has argued\nexplicitly for a closer cooperation between complexity theory and\nphilosophy.\n\nUntil recently the general opinion was that the various notions of\ninformation were more or less isolated but in recent years\nconsiderable progress has been made in the understanding of the\nrelationship between these concepts. Cover and Thomas (2006), for\ninstance, see a perfect match between Kolmogorov complexity and\nShannon information. Similar observations have been made by\nGr\u00fcnwald and Vit\u00e1nyi (2008). Also the connections that\nexist between the theory of thermodynamics and information theory have\nbeen studied (Bais & Farmer 2008; Harremo\u00ebs &\nTops\u00f8e 2008) and it is clear that the connections between\nphysics and information theory are much more elaborate than a mere\nad hoc similarity between the formal treatment of entropy and\ninformation suggests (Gell-Mann & Lloyd 2003; Verlinde (2011,\n2017). Quantum computing is at this moment not developed to a point\nwhere it is effectively more powerful than classical computing, but\nthis threshold might be passed in the coming years. From the point of\nview of philosophy many conceptual problems of quantum physics and\ninformation theory seem to merge into one field of related questions:\n\n\nWhat is the relation between information and computation?\nIs computation in the real world fundamentally\nnon-deterministic?\n What is the relation between symbol manipulation on a macroscopic\nscale and the world of quantum physics? \n What is a good model of quantum computing and how do we control\nits power? \n Is there information beyond the world of quanta?\n\n\nThe notion of information has become central in both our society and\nin the sciences. Information technology plays a pivotal role in the\nway we organize our lives. It also has become a basic category in the\nsciences and the humanities. Philosophy of information, both as a\nhistorical and a systematic discipline, offers a new perspective on\nold philosophical problems and also suggests new research domains.",
