    "main_text": "Is/Ought and the Open Question Argument\n4. Is/Ought and the Open Question Argument\n\nDavid Hume seemed to have these points in mind when he observed that\nan \u2018ought\u2019 cannot be derived from an\n \u2018is.\u2019[5]\n There is substantial debate about just what Hume meant, and similarly\nsubstantial debate as well about whether he was right. But at least\npart of Hume\u2019s concern seems to have been that no set of claims\nabout plain matters of fact (\u2018is\u2019 claims) entail any\nevaluative claims (\u2018ought\u2019 claims). He seems to have\nthought that one can infer the latter from the former only if, in\naddition to premises concerning plain matters of fact, one has on hand\nas well at least one evaluative premise. If, for instance, one infers\nfrom the fact that someone is feeling pain that something bad is\nhappening, one is at least presupposing that pain is bad. That\npresupposition, in turn, is not entailed by any claims concerned\nsolely with plain matters of fact. If Hume is right, every valid\nargument for an evaluative conclusion either includes or presupposes\nsome evaluative premise. And, as a result, there is no value-neutral\nargument for an evaluative conclusion.\n\nComing at the same issues from a different direction, G. E. Moore\nargued (at the beginning of the twentieth century) that no naturalist\naccount of morality could do justice to what we are actually thinking\nand claiming when we make moral\n judgments.[6]\n Moore had in mind a variety of naturalist views that, at the time,\nhad come to be seen as, on balance, the most attractive accounts of\nthe nature of morality. While these views differed among themselves as\nto what goodness, rightness, virtue, and justice might consist in,\nthey shared a commitment to seeing morality as a wholly natural\nphenomenon and they all saw moral judgment as a matter of thinking\nthat actions, institutions, or characters had some particular natural\nproperty or other. According to these views, moral properties are to\nbe identified with some natural property or other (e.g., with what is\npleasant, or what satisfies someone\u2019s desire, or what conforms\nto social rules that are in force).\n\nConsidering specifically views that identified goodness either with\npleasure or with being the object of a desire one desires to have,\nMoore maintained that such views confused the property goodness with\nsome other property that good things might happen to have. In support\nof his claim, Moore offered a simple test. Take whichever account you\nwill\u2014say, one according to which to be good is to be\npleasant\u2014and then consider whether a person who understands the\nterms involved might nonetheless intelligibly ask whether something\nshe acknowledges to be pleasant is good. It seems she could. And it\nseems too that in asking the question she would not then be revealing\nany kind of conceptual confusion or incompetence. The question is, as\nMoore put it, a genuinely open one. But then we must grant that to\nthink something is pleasant is not identical to thinking it is good.\nOtherwise, wondering whether something that is, admittedly, pleasant,\nis good would be as senseless as wondering whether a given pleasant\nthing was pleasant. If, though, to think something good is different\nthan thinking it pleasant, such thoughts (Moore assumed) must involve\nattributing distinct properties.\n\nMoore was quick to point out that granting that the question is open,\nin the sense his argument supposes, is compatible with discovering\nthat, as a matter of fact, everything that is pleasant is also good.\nMoore\u2019s point is that the question is not settled\u2014not\nclosed\u2014on conceptual grounds (whereas it would be if thinking\nsomething good were just a matter of thinking it pleasant). Because\nanalogous questions remain open for all the candidate naturalist\nproposals, Moore argued that no such proposal could legitimately be\ndefended as a conceptual truth and that they all failed to capture\naccurately what we are thinking in thinking of something that it is\ngood.\n\nMoore\u2019s argument had a tremendous impact, striking most people\nat the time as decisive. As a result, non-naturalism got a new lease\non life with a number of people working in metaethics trying to\narticulate, systematize, and defend accounts of morality that resisted\nthe temptation to identify moral properties with natural\n properties.[7]\n Much of the attention was given, by those who have come to be called\nintuitionists, to defending the idea that moral knowledge, while not\nbased on our senses and on the empirical data we might collect, was\nnonetheless on as secure a footing as, say, our knowledge of\nmathematics or of the fundamental concepts (of, say, causation and\nnecessity) that play crucial roles in science. Much of the work in\nmetaethics pursued a strategy of finding companions in guilt, of\nshowing that the status of moral properties as non-natural and the\nattendant implications for what we must suppose about the nature of\nmoral evidence, did not leave morality any worse off than other\nrespected fields of knowledge.\n\nYet Moore\u2019s casual slide from claims about what we are thinking\nto the nature of the properties we are attributing in thinking as we\ndo, offered an important point of resistance. As Moore saw things, to\nmake a moral claim is to express a distinctive belief (that might be\ntrue or false) about how things are. Specifically, it is to express\nthe belief that some course of action, or institution, or character\ntrait had the property of being right, or good, or virtuous. The\nchallenge (Moore assumed) is to figure out what property it is that we\nare taking a thing to have, in thinking of it as right, or good, or\nvirtuous. And the place to look, he thought, is at the content of our\nbeliefs.\n\nAccording to many, while Moore\u2019s Open Question argument does\nshow that moral thinking is distinctive and should not be treated as\npart and parcel of thinking about non-moral matters, Moore was wrong\nin holding that the important difference should be traced to the\nnature of the properties we are taking things to have. According to\nsome of these critics, Moore\u2019s mistake is in thinking we are\nattributing properties at all, when we think of something as right, or\ngood, or virtuous; according to others, his mistake was in thinking\nthat how we think of a property reveals the true nature of the\n property.[8]\n\nThe first line of criticism emerged soon after Moore first offered his\nOpen Question Argument, with philosophers suggesting that in thinking\nmorally we may well not be attributing properties at\n all.[9]\n Agreeing that it was a mistake to see moral claims as attributing\nnatural properties to things, non-cognitivists argue that\nMoore\u2019s mistake was in thinking that moral claims attribute any\nsort of property to things, and so he was also wrong in thinking that\nmoral claims have propositional content and express genuine beliefs.\nThe Open Question is always open, they argue, not because we are, in\nmaking a moral judgment, attributing some non-natural property to\nthings, but because we are not attributing any property at all. We are\nnot saying anything that might be true or false, nor are we expressing\na belief. We are doing something altogether different: taking a stand,\nor expressing an emotion, or prescribing something. On these views,\nmoral judgments express some attitude other than belief and lack the\nsort of cognitive content that would allow them to be true or\nfalse.\n\nFrom the start, non-cognitivists have had an eye on both (i) the\nnon-cognitive attitudes that are expressed in making a moral\nclaim and (ii) what people are doing in making such claims.\nWhen focusing on the first, they emphasize that moral terms get their\nmeaning not by their link to beliefs that represent the world as being\na certain way, but by their connection to non-cognitive\nattitudes\u2014e.g., reactions to the way the world is, or desires\nfor how the world might be. Here, in giving an account of the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of moral terms, non-cognitivists focus on the\nconventionally-established connection between moral terms and certain\nattitudes. (Of course, people can use such a term without actually\nhaving the corresponding attitudes, but understanding the term,\nnon-cognitivists argue, is a matter of seeing that it is a\nlinguistically appropriate way to express the attitude.) When focusing\non the second, non-cognitivists emphasize moral language\u2019s role\nas tool for influencing others. Here their attention is on how moral\nclaims guide actions. In saying that something is, say, wrong, people\nare consistently not just expressing their opposition to it but\ntelling others not to do it, or working to persuade them not to, or in\nsome other way working to direct action. The two ideas go together\nnaturally, since if the first is right, then it would help explain why\npeople can and do use moral language in the way the second suggests.\nBut the ideas are separable. And many think that the expressivist idea\nadvanced by the first goes to the heart of the matter, while\nconcentrating on the directive or prescriptive use of moral\nlanguage can at best be secondary.\n\nWhatever the details, the non-cognitivists share the idea that one can\nadmit that something is pleasant, or the object of a desire, or such\nthat it conforms to some rule in force, and nonetheless not take a\nstand regarding it, or not have any particular emotion concerning it,\nor not have any interest in prescribing anything relating to it. The\nOpen Question is open, they hold, precisely because the attitudes\nexpressed by a moral judgment all involve something other than merely\nbelieving of something that it has certain features (whether natural\nor not). At the same time, the non-cognitivists\u2019 proposals fit\nwell with granting Hume\u2019s claim concerning the gap between\n\u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019: whatever facts one grants,\nwhatever \u2018is\u2019 claims one endorses, there is no logical\ninconsistency involved in failing to take a relevant stand, or to\nexpress an emotion towards it, or to prescribe something related to\nit. Between the beliefs we might have and the other attitudes we might\nform, no entailment relations hold at all.\n\nNon-cognitivists, of course, need to explain why it seems so plausible\nto see moral judgment as an expression of belief and as a matter of\nattributing properties to actions, institutions, and characters. And\nthey need to explain why moral thought seems appropriately subject to\nthe rules of logic, whereas the various attitudes that play central\nroles in the non-cognitivist accounts all seem to fall outside of that\n realm.[10]\n Taking the challenge head-on, recent versions of expressivism, flying\nthe banner of \u201cquasi-realism\u201d, have taken as a central\nproject explaining, on non-cognitivist foundations, how and why moral\nlanguage has all the trappings of being cognitivist and realist. These\nviews start with a picture of the world as having neither moral\nproperties nor people believing in moral properties (though they have\nother beliefs), and then explain how a practice of thinking and\ntalking about moral properties, moral beliefs, moral truth, and moral\nfacts, might naturally and properly emerge. The central idea\nis that we can see our thought and talk as fundamentally a matter of\nour expressing our affective attitudes or commitments which gives rise\nto legitimate thought and talk about corresponding properties,\nbeliefs, truths, and facts. Two moves underwrite this idea. One is to\nhold that talk of properties, beliefs, truths, and facts comes cheap:\nOnce one holds sincerely that \u201cLying is wrong\u201d, no\nadditional commitments come with adding \u201cLying has the property\nof being wrong\u201d or \u201cI believe that lying is wrong\u201d\nor \u201cIt is true that lying is wrong\u201d or that \u201cIt is a\nfact that lying is wrong\u201d. These are all, in effect, just\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing. And if, in the first place,\nsincerely saying \u201cLying is wrong\u201d is a matter of\nexpressing an attitude or a commitment then so too are these\nalternative ways of saying the same thing. The second move that\nunderwrites quasi-realism is pointing out that the question of whether\nrealist-sounding moral discourse is legitimate is, itself, an\nevaluative question judged in light of one\u2019s attitudes and\ncommitments. There is, on this view, no independent standard of, say,\n\u201cmatching the world\u201d that one can deploy without, in\nchoosing that standard, expressing one\u2019s attitudes and\ncommitments.\n\nVarious versions of non-cognitivism, and in particular versions of\nquasi-realist expressivism, remain among the most attractive ways of\nresisting the non-naturalist implications of Moore\u2019s Open\nQuestion\n Argument.[11]\n But they are not the only option. Many argue that, while\nMoore\u2019s argument shows that thinking something is good\nis different than thinking it is pleasant (or the object of a\ndesire, or such as to conform to some norm that is in force), it does\nnot show that being good is different from being\npleasant (or the object of a desire, or such as to conform to\nsome norm that is in force). After all, they point out, thinking\nthat some liquid is H2O is different from thinking\nit is water and one might intelligibly wonder whether what one\ngrants to be water really is H2O. Yet that does not show\nthat being water is anything other than being\nH20. Far from it. A difference between the thoughts\ndoes not establish a difference in the properties. Thus, for all the\nOpen Question Argument shows, it might turn out that a naturalist\naccount of the nature of moral properties is correct. The naturalist\naccount cannot be defended simply as a conceptual truth but it also\ncannot be rejected, as Moore thought it could be, as obviously\nconfusing one property (the natural property) for another one (the\nmoral property). This sort of cognitivism has no trouble explaining\nwhy it seems so plausible to see moral judgment as an expression of\nbelief and as a matter of attributing properties to actions,\ninstitutions, and characters. Moral judgments are in fact, on this\nsort of account, the expression of belief and they do involve\nattributing properties to actions, institutions, and characters\n(though the account holds that the true nature of the property being\nattributed is something that might come as a surprise to some).\nSimilarly, this sort of cognitivism can explain why moral thought\nseems appropriately subject to the rules of logic: it seems\nappropriately subject to these rules because it is. Problems emerge,\nhowever, when it comes to explaining the apparently distinctive nature\nof moral thinking. If thinking that something is good or right is a\nmatter of attributing to the thing some natural property or other,\nthen what explains the apparently distinctive nature of moral\nthought?\n\nCognitivists and non-cognitivists face a common challenge: to account\nfor the nature of moral thought and talk that simultaneously does\njustice to its distinctive nature without failing to appreciate the\nsignificant ways in which it is continuous with non-moral thought and\ntalk. Cognitivism has a relatively easy time accommodating the\ncontinuity between moral and non-moral thought and talk, but,\nespecially when combined with naturalism, it faces a real challenge in\nmarking the distinctive nature of moral thought and talk;\nnon-cognitivism has no trouble making room for the distinctive nature\nof moral thought and talk, but it has trouble accommodating the\ncontinuity. (See the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.)\n\nWhat has always been attractive about Moorean non-naturalism is its\ncapacity to combine the continuity and the difference into a coherent\npicture. There is room, at least, to account for moral thought\u2019s\ncontinuity with other thought by emphasizing that it is all a matter\nof attributing properties (albeit different properties) to things; and\nthere is room too for locating the distinctive nature of moral thought\nin the putatively authoritative standing of the properties attributed.\nOf course, leaving room for an account is not the same as actually\nproviding one, and Moore himself does not actually offer much at all\nby way of an explanation of the normative authority (as we might call\nit) of moral properties. In any case, what has always been troubling\nabout Moore\u2019s view is that the coherent picture that emerges\nseems to presuppose (i) the existence of metaphysically dubious\nproperties that fall outside the causal nexus and, so, are such that\n(ii) it would be a complete mystery how we could ever reliably learn\nanything about them, if they were to exist. Moore, and the\nintuitionists who followed him, work in various ways to address these\nconcerns. Error theorists, in contrast, hold that the coherent picture\npainted by Moore is, at least roughly, the right account of what moral\nthought and talk involves, but they go on to argue that the\nmetaphysically and epistemically troubling implications of that\npicture properly undermine its credibility. They argue that we have\ncompelling reasons to reject moral thought, at least to the extent\nMoore was right about what moral thought\n presupposes.[12]\n That is of course compatible with thinking that we should use the\nsame language meaning something different by it, or replacing it\naltogether with some other way of thinking and speaking.\n\nThe error theorists\u2019 position regarding morality is the\ncounterpart, with respect to moral thought, of the atheist\u2019s\nposition with respect to views concerning God\u2019s will and ways.\nIn both cases, the suggestion is that the thoughts at issue involve a\nmistake or a failed presupposition, and that, because of this, they\ncannot be true. The error theorist\u2019s position, it is worth\nnoting, requires establishing two claims that have each met a lot of\nresistance: that moral thought really has the presuppositions the\nerror theorist supposes and that those presuppositions are as\nuntenable as the error theorist maintains. At the same time, though,\nanyone who hopes to vindicate moral thought has the burden of showing\nthat its actual presuppositions and implications are, after all,\ndefensible.
