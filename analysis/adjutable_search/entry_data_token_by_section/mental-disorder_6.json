    "main_text": "The Disorder in Mental Disorder\n4. The Disorder in Mental Disorder\n\nDepression and anxiety, the schizophrenias, obsessions, compulsions\nand the like are core instances of mental disorder, but psychiatric\nclassification acknowledges many other conditions as well. From such a\nlarge and apparently heterogeneous collection, the broad category may\nbest be judged a family resemblance one. Indeed, through a different\nhistorical or cultural lens, the assembled variations known today as\nmental disorders would likely appear incoherently arbitrary. Yet,\nspurred by essentialist expectations (and out of concern about the\nunwarranted \u201cmedicalization\u201d of normal states and\nbehavior), the quest for a unifying conception of mental disorder\n(illness, or disease) has persisted within philosophical research.\nCharacteristic features have been identified, including disunity,\nirrationality, the presence of suffering and disability, several forms\nof dysfunction, and even adaptive function. Proposed formal analytic\ndefinitions are illustrated in\n Section 4.4.\n",
