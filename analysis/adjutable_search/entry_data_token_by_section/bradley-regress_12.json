    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || The Brute Fact Approach\n4. Further Applications of Bradley\u2019s Regress\n\nGrounding. The metaphysical debate about the nature of\ngrounding and metaphysical explanation has taken an interest in\nBradley\u2019s regress from a different perspective. Here, the main\nBradley-inspired issue has been whether or not it should be one of the\nrequirements for a metaphysical explanation that it \u201cmust ground\nout\u201d. The problem with Bradley\u2019s regress in this context\nis that it appears to be committed to an infinite chain of facts, each\none ontologically dependent on the subsequent one for its explanation.\nThis is the situation described positively by Orilia (2006, 2007)\nabove. The unity of a state of affairs Fa is explained by\nappeal to another higher-order fact R<Fa>, and this one\nin turn is explained by appeal to a further fact R\u2032<R,\n<Fa>>, and so on ad infinitum. However, Cameron\n(2008) has found such a dependence chain to be very problematic. He\nbelieves that there is a strong intuition in favor of there being \u201ca metaphysical ground, a realm of ontologically independent objects\nwhich provide the ultimate ontological basis for all the ontologically\ndependent entities, and a realm of basic facts which provide the\nultimate metaphysical ground for all the derivative facts\u201d (Cameron\n2008: 8).\n\nCameron admits that it is hard to argue for this intuition by appeal\nto a further, more basic metaphysical principle. Instead, he suggests,\nit can be supported by appeal to theoretical utility; a unified\nexplanation of the same sort of phenomenon seems preferable to an\ninfinite descending chains of separate explanations. In response to\nCameron, Orilia (2009) has pointed out weaknesses in Cameron\u2019s\nappeal to a unified explanation as a way of supporting the thesis of\nwell-foundeness of all chains of ontological dependence (WF);\nthus, Orialia has concluded that WF cannot yet have a claim\nof being a contingent truth.\n\nAnother interesting question inspired by Bradley\u2019s regress\narguments, has been posed by Bennett (2011). Her question is: is\ngrounding itself fundamental? Prima facie, it seems that it can\nneither be fundamental, nor grounded. But if it is neither, then the\ngrounding would have to be rejected, which is an unattractive outcome\nthat Bennett does not want to embrace. Inspired by Armstrong\u2019s\n(1989) discussion of the Bradley problem and relations of\ninstantiation as internal and supervenient upon their relata, she then\nexplores whether the grounding relation itself could be treated in a\nsimilar fashion. There is one important difference: rather than have\ngrounding supervene on two or more relata, Bennett proposes that it be\ntreated as a relation that supervenes upon only one of its relata.\nSuch a relation she calls \u201csuperinternal\u201d.\n\nDebate concerning the nature of mataphysical explanation and the\nconcept of grounding is quite prolific and ongoing. (For a detailed\ndiscussion see the SEP entry on Grounding.) What one must keep in mind\nwhen it comes to Bradleyean problems and grounding is that the former\ndebate is itself quite varied and without a consensus on either the\nnature of the problem or the desiderata for the satisfactory solution.\nThus, caution should be advised when importing conclusions from one\ncontentious problem into the area of another even more abstract and\ncontentious one.\n\nComposition. Grounding considerations and Bradley\u2019s\nregress have found their application in the discussion of the problem\nof composition of objects. Brzozowski (2008) has recently posed the\nfollowing question concerning the location of composite objects: does\nthe location of a composite object derive from the location of its\nproper parts, or not? (Brzozowski 2008: 193). Either way, Brzozowski\ntakes it that we get unappealing consequences. The first horn of the\ndilemma is that if indeed the location of composite objects\nis derived from their proper parts, the possibility of spatio-temporal\ngunk objects (composite objects whose parts are themselves composite\nobjects) would have to be denied. If, on the other hand, the location\nof composite objects is not derived from their proper parts, then\nbrute metaphysical necessities connecting the location of composite\nobjects with the locations of their proper parts must be posited.\nBrzozowski argues in favor of the first horn of the dilemma, and part\nof his argument relies on applying a Bradley-type argument to the\nlocation of gunk objects. His main thought is that there would be a\nserious problem of location of gunk objects since \u201ceven though at each level of the series of decomposition we can\nexplain the location of a composite object by appealing to the\nlocation of a proper part, it is left unexplained how any\nobject in the series is located in space-time. Given the piecemeal\nstory, there is no way for the totality of location relations to be\ngrounded\u2026\u201d (Brzozowski 2008: 201). \nAs we can see, Brzozowski here relies on some version of Cameron\u2019s\nWF principle described above.\n\nPhilosophy of Language. Outside of the strictly metaphysical\ndebates, Bradleyean arguments are often brought up when discussing the\nproblem of the unity of the proposition. This problem in philosophy of\nlanguage is usually put as follows: what is the difference between a\nmere list of words such as \"wise, Alice, is\" and a meaningful sentence\nsuch as \"Alice is wise\"? The latter seems to possess a unity of some\nsort, but what is the exact nature of such unity and how does it come\nabout? In analogy with the ontological version of Bradley\u2019s\nregress, philosophers then worry that an appeal to a copula does not\nexplain what it is that is special about the unity present in\n\u201cAlice is wise\u201d and absent in a mere list. And no appeal\nto further copulas will help the matters either.\n\nThere has been a tendency recently to view the problem of the unity of\nthe proposition as a useful heuristic in interpreting views of Frege,\nRussell, and Wittgenstein. We can see this in Davidson\u2019s (2005)\nposthumous work on truth and predication, where he often runs together\nthe ontological and the semantic versions of what he refers to as\n\u201cthe problem of predication\u201d. More careful work on this\nissue has been recently done by Gaskin (1995, 2008) and Collins\n(2011). The particularly obscure nature of the debate between Russell\nand Wittgenstein over Russell\u2019s theory of judgment has lent\nitself to being interpreted as concerning the problem of the unity of\nthe proposition. For such an interpretation see in particular Hanks\n(2007).\n",
