    "main_text": "\n\nIn recent decades, philosophers frequently refer to\n\u2018intentionality\u2019, roughly, that feature of beliefs,\ndesires, and other mental states in virtue of which they are\nof or about something or more generally, possess\ncontent; contrary to what ordinary usage of \u2018intentional\u2019\nmight suggest, it is not limited to practical states such as intending\nto do something or acting intentionally. The currency of the technical\nterm is due in large part to Edmund Husserl, who took it from his own\nteacher, Franz Brentano. In 1874, Brentano had proposed this feature\nas a criterion of the mental that could be used to demarcate\npsychology from the physical sciences, and he explicitly invoked\nmedieval scholastic terminology (intentio, esse\nintentionale) as a way of reintroducing the notion.\nBrentano\u2019s thesis about the criterion of the mental has had a\ncheckered fate in philosophy. But interest in intentionality in its\nown right has continued unabated.\n\nThis interest has naturally led to questions about the history of the\nnotion. Earlier accounts, following Brentano, looked to late medieval\ndiscussions in Latin and then to their roots in earlier Arabic\nphilosophy. But at that point, it was claimed, the trail peters out\n\u2013 nothing in Greek or Roman philosophy, allegedly, corresponds.\nThis narrative, as one might suspect, rests on questionable\nassumptions. Once the investigation is properly framed, it is clear\nthat philosophical interest in intentionality can be traced all the\nway back to the origins of Western philosophy. Intentionality is\nrecognized as raising serious puzzles already in the early- to\nmid-fifth century bce, arguably first by\nParmenides, but then indisputably by sophists responding to him,\nincluding Gorgias and Protagoras. The first extensive discussions are\nin Plato, who explicitly thematizes the difficulties in several\ndialogues and considers various solutions. Later philosophers develop\nother solutions, which include appeals to internal representations\n(Aristotle), or to nonexistent objects of thought (the first Stoics,\nZeno and Cleanthes), and propositions and other semantic entities\n(other Stoics, beginning with Chrysippus). Even the terminology of\nintentionality can be traced back, through Augustine, to Greek\norigins, namely in the Stoic theory of vision.\n",
