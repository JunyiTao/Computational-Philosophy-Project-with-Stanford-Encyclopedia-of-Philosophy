Profoundly affected by the\nphilosophy of Martin Heidegger (whose own influence on philosophical\nhermeneutics is pervasive despite Heidegger\u2019s abandonment of the term\nin his later thought), Gadamer was trained in neo-Kantian\nscholarship as well as in classical philology. Central to\nGadamer\u2019s mature philosophy is a distinctive and thoroughly\ndialogical approach, based in Platonic-Aristotelian as well as\nHeideggerian thinking, that rejects subjectivism and relativism,\nabjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and grounds\nunderstanding in the linguistically mediated happening of tradition.\nEmploying a more orthodox and modest, but also more accessible style\nthan Heidegger himself, Gadamer\u2019s work can be seen as\nconcentrated in four main areas: the first, and clearly the most\ninfluential, is the development and elaboration of a philosophical\nhermeneutics; the second is the dialogue within philosophy, and within\nthe history of philosophy, with respect to Plato and Aristotle in\nparticular, but also with Hegel and Heidegger; the third is the\nengagement with literature, particularly poetry, and with art; and the\nfourth is what Gadamer himself terms \u2018practical\nphilosophy\u2019 (Gadamer 2001, 78\u201385) encompassing\ncontemporary political and ethical issues. The dialogical character of\nGadamer\u2019s approach is evident, not merely in the central\ntheoretical role he gives to the concept of dialogue in his thinking,\nbut also in the discursive and dialogic, even\n\u2018conversational\u2019 character of his writing, as well as\nin his own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and exchange\n(Gadamer uses the German term Gespr\u00e4ch which can be\ntranslated as either dialogue or conversation). Indeed, Gadamer is one\nof the few philosophers for whom the \u2018interview\u2019 has\nbecome a significant category of philosophical output (see Hahn 1997,\n588\u2013599; also Gadamer 2001, 2003). Although he identified\nconnections between his own work and English-speaking\n\u2018analytic\u2019 thought (mainly via the later Wittgenstein, but\nalso Donald Davidson\u2014see Keane 2021), and has sometimes seen his\nideas taken up by thinkers such as Alasdair McIntyre (see MacIntyre\n2002), Ronald Dworkin (see Dworkin 1986), Robert Brandom (see Brandom\n2002), John McDowell (see McDowell 1996, 2002), and especially Richard\nRorty (Rorty 1979; see also Keane 2021), Gadamer is perhaps less well\nknown, and certainly less well-appreciated, in English-speaking\nphilosophical circles than are some of his near-contemporaries. He is\nundoubtedly, however, one of the most important thinkers of the\ntwentieth century, having had an enormous impact on a range of areas\nfrom aesthetics to jurisprudence, and having acquired a respect and\nreputation in Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, that went far beyond\nthe usual confines of academia.\n", "toc": [{"#BioSke": "1.

Biographical Sketch\n\nBorn on February 11, 1900, in Marburg, in Southern Germany, Gadamer\ngrew up in Breslau (now Wroclaw in Poland), where his father was\nProfessor of Pharmacy at the University of Breslau, later taking the\nChair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Marburg. Gadamer\u2019s family\nbackground was Protestant, and his father was sternly Prussian. His\nmother died of diabetes when Gadamer was only four, and he had no\nsurviving brothers or sisters. Showing an early interest in humanistic\nstudies, Gadamer began university studies in Breslau in 1918 (studying\nwith Richard Hoenigswald), moving to Marburg with his father in 1919.\nGadamer completed his doctoral studies at Marburg in 1922 (in his own\nwords, \u2018too young\u2019\u2014see Gadamer 1997b, 7) with a\ndissertation on Plato. In that same year, Gadamer also contracted\npoliomyelitis, from which he recovered only slowly, and the\nafter-effects of which remained with him for the rest of his life.\n\nGadamer\u2019s early teachers at Marburg were Paul Natorp and Nicolai\nHartmann. Paul Friedlander introduced him to philological study, and\nGadamer also received encouragement from Rudolf Bultmann. It was,\nhowever, Martin Heidegger (at Marburg from 1923\u20131928) who\nexerted the most important and enduring effect on Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical development. Gadamer had first met Heidegger in Freiburg\nin early 1923, having also corresponded with him in 1922. Yet although\nGadamer was a key figure in Heidegger\u2019s Marburg circle, working\nas Heidegger\u2019s unpaid assistant, by 1925 Heidegger had become\nquite critical of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical capacities and\ncontributions. As a result, Gadamer decided to abandon philosophy for\nclassical philology. (Gadamer was not alone in being the recipient of\nsuch criticism\u2014Heidegger was also unimpressed by Jacob Klein and\nwas certainly prone to deliver harsh judgments on his students and\ncolleagues\u2014but Gadamer seems to have been more particularly\naffected by it.) Through his philological work, however, Gadamer seems\nto have regained Heidegger\u2019s respect, passing the State\nExamination in Classical Philology in 1927, with Friedlander and\nHeidegger as two of the three examiners, and then going on to submit\nhis habilitation dissertation (\u2018Plato\u2019s Dialectical\nEthics\u2019, [1991]), in 1928, under Friedlander and\nHeidegger\u2019s guidance. Gadamer\u2019s relationship with\nHeidegger remained relatively close throughout their respective\ncareers, even though it was also a relationship that held considerable\ntension\u2014at least on Gadamer\u2019s side (of his difficulties in\nwriting in the late 1940s, Gadamer commented that \u2018I had the terrible\nfeeling that Heidegger was standing behind me and looking over my\nshoulder\u2019, Gadamer 1997b, 15).\n\nGadamer\u2019s first academic appointment was to a junior position in\nMarburg in 1928, finally achieving a lower-level professorship there\nin 1937. In the meantime, from 1934\u201335, Gadamer held a temporary\nprofessorship at Kiel, and then, in 1939, took up the Directorship of\nthe Philosophical Institute at the University of Leipzig, becoming\nDean of the Faculty in 1945, and Rector in 1946, before returning to\nteaching and research at Frankfurt-am-Main in 1947. In 1949, he\nsucceeded Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg, officially retiring (becoming\nProfessor Emeritus) in 1968. Following his retirement, he travelled\nextensively, spending considerable time in North America, where he was\na visitor at a number of institutions and developed an especially\nclose and regular association with Boston College in\nMassachusetts.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Gadamer was able to accommodate himself,\non his account, reluctantly, first to National Socialism and then\nbriefly, to Communism. While Gadamer did not identify himself strongly\nwith either regime (he was never a member of the National Socialist\nParty, although he did belong to the affiliated National Socialist\nTeachers Union), neither did he draw attention to himself by outright\nopposition. However some have seen his stance as too acquiescent, and\nothers have argued that he was indeed supportive of the Nazi\ndictatorship or of some aspects of it (see Wolin 2000 as well as the\nreply in Palmer 2002; see also the discussion in Krajewski 2003,\n169\u2013306; for Gadamer\u2019s own comments on this issue see the\ninterview/conversation, \u2018The real Nazis had no interest in us at\nall\u2019, Gadamer 2001).\n\nIn 1953, together with Helmut Kuhn, Gadamer founded the highly\ninfluential Philosophische Rundschau, but his main\nphilosophical impact was not felt until the publication of Truth\nand Method in 1960 (1989b). Gadamer\u2019s best known\npublications almost all date from the period after Truth and\nMethod (which did not appear in English translation until 1975),\nand in this respect much of his philosophical reputation rests on\npublications either after or in the decade just before his transition\nto emeritus status in 1968 (also the year in which he began regular\nvisits to the United States). The important debates in which Gadamer\nengaged with J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida took place in\nthis latter part of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical career, and it was\nnot until the 1970s and 1980s that Gadamer\u2019s work began to\nreceive widespread attention in English.\n\nGadamer was twice married: in 1923, to Frida Kratz (later divorced),\nwith whom he had one daughter (born in 1926), and, in 1950, to\nK\u00e4te Lekebusch. Gadamer received numerous awards and prizes\nincluding, in 1971, Knight of the \u2018Order of\nMerit\u2019\u2014the highest academic honor awarded in Germany.\nRemaining intellectually active until the very end of his life (he\nheld regular office hours even in his nineties), Gadamer died in\nHeidelberg on March 13, 2002, at the age of 102 (for a more detailed\nbiography, see Grondin 2003; see also Dostal 2021).\n2. Hermeneutical Foundations\n2.1 Dialogue and Phronesis\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking began and always remained connected with\nGreek thought, especially that of Plato and Aristotle. In this\nrespect, Gadamer\u2019s early engagement with Plato, which lay at the\ncore of both his doctoral and habilitation dissertations, was\ndeterminative of much of the character and philosophical direction of\nhis thinking. Under the influence of his early teachers such as\nHartmann, as well as Friedlander, Gadamer developed an approach to\nPlato that rejected the idea of any \u2018hidden\u2019 doctrine in\nPlato\u2019s thought, looking instead to the structure of the\nPlatonic dialogues themselves as the key to understanding\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. The only way to understand Plato, as Gadamer\nsaw it, was thus by working through the Platonic texts in a way that\nnot only enters into the dialogue and dialectic set out in those\ntexts, but also repeats that dialogic movement in the attempt at\nunderstanding as such. Moreover, the dialectical structure of Platonic\nquestioning also provides the model for a way of understanding that is\nopen to the matter at issue through bringing oneself into question\nalong with the matter itself.\n\nUnder the influence of Heidegger, Gadamer also took up, as a central\nelement in his thinking, the idea of phronesis\n(\u2018practical wisdom\u2019) that appears in Book VI of\nAristotle\u2019s Nichomachean Ethics. For Heidegger the\nconcept of phronesis is important, not only as a means of\ngiving emphasis to our practical \u2018being-in-the world\u2019 over\nand against theoretical apprehension, but also as constituting a mode\nof insight into our own concrete situation (both our practical\nsituation and, more fundamentally, our existential situation, hence\nphronesis constitutes a mode of self-knowledge). The\nway in which Gadamer conceives of understanding, and interpretation,\nis as just such a practically oriented mode of insight\u2014a mode of\ninsight that has its own rationality irreducible to any simple rule or\nset of rules, that cannot be directly taught, that necessarily\nimplicates an understanding of self as well as other, and that is\nalways oriented to the particular case at hand. The concept of\nphronesis can itself be seen as providing a certain\nelaboration of the dialogic conception of understanding Gadamer had\nalready found in Plato, but it goes well beyond the Platonic account\nalone.\n\nTaken together, phronesis and dialogue provide the essential\nstarting point for the development of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics. It is a starting point in which these two key elements,\nphronesis and dialogue, can be seen as together founded in,\nas well as being elaborative of, the idea of hermeneutical situation\nor situatedness\u2014an idea that has a Heideggerian provenance, but\nwhich Gadamer also develops in his own terms. The idea of\nhermeneutical situation is basic to Gadamer\u2019s approach and underpins\nmany of his key concepts even though it often remains in the\nbackground. It is elaborated, sometimes implicitly, through notions of\nevent and encounter, and in a way that increasingly draws attention to\nthe role of the other (although the self-other relation figures\nthroughout Gadamer\u2019s thinking, see Dallmayr, 1993). It is an idea tied\nto Gadamer\u2019s use of the notion of play as a key element in\nunderstanding and to the character of understanding as always embedded\nin an prior \u2018horizon\u2019 that is also fundamentally\nhistorical.Phronesis and dialogue are thus aspects of a\nhermeneutical situatedness that is complex,\ndifferentiated, and dynamic.\n2.2 Ontology and Hermeneutics\n\nTraditionally, hermeneutics is taken to have its origins in problems\nof biblical exegesis and in the development of a theoretical framework\nto govern and direct such exegetical practice. In the hands of\neighteenth and early nineteenth century theorists, writers such as\nChladenius and Meier, Ast and Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was\ndeveloped into a more encompassing theory of textual interpretation in\ngeneral\u2014a set of rules that provide the basis for good\ninterpretive practice no matter what the subject matter. Inasmuch as\nhermeneutics is the method proper to the recovery of meaning, so\nWilhelm Dilthey broadened hermeneutics still further, taking it as the\nmethodology for the recovery of meaning that is essential to\nunderstanding within the \u2018human\u2019 or\n\u2018historical\u2019 sciences (the\nGeisteswissenschaften). For these writers, as for many\nothers, the basic problem of hermeneutics was methodological: how to\nfound the human sciences, and so how to found the science of\ninterpretation, in a way that would make them properly\n\u2018scientific\u2019. Moreover, if the mathematical models and\nprocedures that appeared to be the hallmark of the sciences of nature\ncould not be duplicated in the human sciences, then the task at issue\nmust involve finding an alternative methodology proper to the human\nsciences as such\u2014hence Schleiermacher\u2019s ambition to\ndevelop a formal methodology that would codify interpretive practice,\nwhile Dilthey aimed at the elaboration of a \u2018psychology\u2019\nthat would elucidate and guide interpretive understanding.\n\nAlready familiar with earlier hermeneutic thinking, Heidegger\nredeployed hermeneutics to a very different purpose and within a very\ndifferent frame. In Heidegger\u2019s early thinking, particularly the\nlectures from the early 1920s (\u2018The Hermeneutics of\nFacticity\u2019), hermeneutics is presented as that by means of which\nthe investigation of the basic structures of factical existence is to\nbe pursued\u2014not as that which constitutes a \u2018theory\u2019\nof textual interpretation nor a method of \u2018scientific\u2019\nunderstanding, but rather as that which allows the self-disclosure of\nthe structure of understanding as such. The \u2018hermeneutic\ncircle\u2019 that had been a central idea in previous hermeneutic\nthinking, and that had been viewed in terms of the interpretative\ninterdependence, within any meaningful structure, between the parts of\nthat structure and the whole, was transformed by Heidegger, so that it\nwas now seen as expressing the way in which all understanding was\n\u2018always already\u2019 given over to that which is to be\nunderstood (to \u2018the things themselves\u2019\u2014die\nSachen selbst). Thus, to take a simple example, if we wish to\nunderstand some particular artwork, we must already have some prior\nunderstanding of that work (even if only as a set of paint marks on\ncanvas), otherwise it cannot even be seen as something to be\nunderstood. To put the point more generally, and in more basic\nontological terms, if we are to understand anything at all, we must\nalready find ourselves \u2018in\u2019 the world \u2018along\nwith\u2019 that which is to be understood. All understanding that is\ndirected at the grasp of some particular subject matter is thus based\nin a prior \u2018ontological\u2019 understanding\u2014a prior\nhermeneutical situatedness. On this basis, hermeneutics can be\nunderstood as the attempt to \u2018make explicit\u2019 the structure\nof such situatedness. Yet since that situatedness is indeed prior to\nany specific event of understanding, so it must always be presupposed\neven in the attempt at its own explication. Consequently, the\nexplication of this situatedness\u2014of this basic ontological mode\nof understanding\u2014is essentially a matter of exhibiting or\n\u2018laying-bare\u2019 a structure with which we are already\nfamiliar (as well as a structure that is present in every event of\nunderstanding) and in which we are already embedded. In this respect,\nhermeneutics becomes one with phenomenology, itself understood, in\nHeidegger\u2019s thinking, as just such a \u2018laying bare\u2019\n(it also takes the form, given the focus on situation and\nsituatedness, of what Heidegger later calls a \u2018topology\u2019\n(Topologie) or a \u2018saying of place\u2019\u2014see\nMalpas 2014).\n\nIt is hermeneutics, in this Heideggerian and phenomenological sense,\nthat is taken up in Gadamer\u2019s work, and that leads him, in\nconjunction with certain other insights from Heidegger\u2019s later\nthinking, as well as the ideas of dialogue and practical wisdom, to\nelaborate a philosophical hermeneutics that provides an account of the\nnature of understanding in its universality (where this refers both to\nthe ontologically fundamental character of the hermeneutical situation\nand the all-encompassing nature of hermeneutic practice) and, in the\nprocess, to develop a response to the earlier hermeneutic\ntradition\u2019s preoccupation with the problem of interpretive\nmethod. In these respects, Gadamer\u2019s work, in conjunction with\nthat of Heidegger, represents a radical reworking of the idea of\nhermeneutics that constitutes a break with the preceding hermeneutical\ntradition at the same time as it also reflects back on that tradition.\nGadamer thus develops a philosophical hermeneutics that provides an\naccount of the proper ground for understanding, while nevertheless\nrejecting the attempt, whether in relation to the\nGeisteswissenschaften or elsewhere, to found understanding on\nany method or set of rules. This is not a rejection of the importance\nof methodological concerns, but rather an insistence on the limited\nrole of method and the priority of understanding as a dialogic,\npractical, situated activity.\n2.3 Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n\nIn 1936 Heidegger gave three lectures on \u2018The Origin of the Work\nof Art\u2019. In these lectures, not published until 1950 (but which\nGadamer heard at the time of their original presentation, see Gadamer\n1997b, 47), Heidegger connects art with truth, arguing that the\nessence of the artwork is not its \u2018representational\u2019\ncharacter, but rather its capacity to allow the disclosure of a world.\nThus the Greek temple establishes the \u2018Greek\u2019 world and in\nso doing allows things to take on a particular appearance within that\nworld. Heidegger refers to this event of disclosure as the event of\n\u2018truth\u2019. The sense of truth at issue here is one that\nHeidegger presents in explicit contrast to what he views as the\ntraditional concept of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019. Such\ncorrectness is usually taken to consist in some form of correspondence\nbetween individual statements and the world, but so-called\n\u2018coherence\u2019 accounts of truth, according to which truth is\na matter of the consistency of a statement with a larger body of\nstatements, can also be viewed as based upon the same underlying\nnotion of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019. While Heidegger does not\nabandon the notion of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019, he argues\nthat it is derivative of a more basic sense of truth as what he terms\n\u2018unconcealment\u2019. Understood in this latter sense, truth is\nnot a property of statements as they stand in relation to the world,\nbut rather an event or process in and through which both the things of\nthe world and what is said about them come to be revealed at one and\nthe same time\u2014the possibility of \u2018correctness\u2019\narises on the basis of just such \u2018unconcealment\u2019.\n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that the unconcealment at issue\nis not a matter of the bringing about of some form of complete and\nabsolute transparency. The revealing of things is, in fact, always\ndependent upon other things being simultaneously concealed (in much\nthe same way as seeing something in one way depends on not seeing it\nin another). Truth is thus understood as the unconcealment that allows\nthings to appear, and that also makes possible the truth and falsity\nof individual statements, and yet which arises on the basis of the\nongoing play between unconcealment and concealment\u2014a\nplay that, for the most part, remains itself hidden and is never\ncapable of complete elucidation. In the language Heidegger employs in\n\u2018The Origin of the Work of Art\u2019, the unconcealment of\n\u2018world\u2019 is thereby grounded in the concealment of\n\u2018earth\u2019. It is this sense of truth as the emergence of\nthings into unconcealment that occurs on the basis of the play between\nconcealing and unconcealing that is taken by Heidegger as the essence\n(or \u2018origin\u2019) of the work of art. This idea of truth, as\nwell as the poetic language Heidegger employed in his exposition, had\na decisive effect on Gadamer\u2019s own thinking. Indeed, Gadamer\ndescribed his philosophical hermeneutics as precisely an attempt\n\u201cto take up and elaborate this line of thinking from the later\nHeidegger\u201d (Gadamer 1997b, 47)\n\nThere are two crucial elements to Gadamer\u2019s appropriation of\nHeidegger here: first, the focus on art, and the connection of art\nwith truth; second, the focus on truth itself as the event of prior\nand partial disclosure (or more properly, of\nconcealment/unconcealment) in which we are already involved and that\ncan never be made completely transparent. Both of these elements are\nconnected with Gadamer\u2019s response to the subjectivist and\nidealist elements in German thought that were present in the\nneo-Kantian tradition, and, more specifically, in romantic\nhermeneutics and aesthetic theory. As Gadamer saw it, aesthetic theory\nhad, largely under the influence of Kant, become alienated from the\nactual experience of art\u2014the response to art had become\nabstracted and \u2018aestheticised\u2019\u2014while aesthetic\njudgment had become purely a matter of taste, and so of subjective\nresponse. Similarly, under the influence of the\n\u2018scientific\u2019 historiography of those such as Ranke,\ntogether with the romantic hermeneutics associated with Schleiermacher\nand others, the desire for objectivity had led to the separation of\nhistorical understanding from the contemporary situation that\nmotivates it, and to a conception of historical method as based in the\nreconstruction of the subjective experiences of the author\u2014a\nreconstruction that, as Hegel made clear, is surely impossible (see\nGadamer 1989b, 164\u20139).\n\nBy turning back to the direct experience of art, and to the concept of\ntruth as prior and partial disclosure, Gadamer was able to develop an\nalternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas of\ndialogue and practical wisdom taken from Plato and Aristotle, and of\nhermeneutical situatedness taken from the early Heidegger. Just as the\nartwork is taken as central and determining in the experience of art,\nso is understanding similarly determined by the matter to be\nunderstood; as the experience of art reveals, not in spite of, but\nprecisely because of the way it also conceals, so understanding is\npossible, not in spite of, but precisely because of its prior\ninvolvement. In Gadamer\u2019s developed work, the concept of\n\u2018play\u2019 (Spiel) has an important role here.\nGadamer takes play as the basic clue to the ontological structure of\nart, emphasizing the way in which play is not a form of disengaged,\ndisinterested exercise of subjectivity, but is rather something that\nhas its own order and structure to which one is given over. The\nstructure of play has obvious affinities with all of the other\nconcepts at issue here\u2014of dialogue, phronesis, the\nhermeneutical situation, the truth of art. Indeed, one can take all of\nthese ideas as providing slightly different elaborations of what is\nessentially the same basic conception of understanding\u2014one that\ntakes our finitude, that is, our prior involvement and partiality, not\nas a barrier to understanding, but rather as its enabling condition.\nIt is this conception that is worked out in detail in Truth and\nMethod.\n3. Philosophical Hermeneutics\n3.1 The Positivity of \u2018Prejudice\u2019\n\nOne might respond to Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on our prior hermeneutic\ninvolvement, whether in the experience of art or elsewhere, that such\ninvolvement cannot but remain subjective simply on the grounds that it\nis always determined by our particular dispositions to experience\nthings in certain ways rather than others\u2014our involvement, one\nmight say, is thus always based on subjective prejudice. Such\nan objection can be seen as a simple reiteration of the basic tendency\ntowards subjectivism that Gadamer rejects, but Gadamer also takes\nissue directly with this view of prejudice and the negative\nconnotations often associated with the notion, arguing that, rather\nthan closing us off, our prejudices are themselves what open us up to\nwhat is to be understood. In this way Gadamer can be seen as\nattempting to retrieve a positive conception of prejudice (German\nVorurteil) that goes back to the meaning of the term as\nliterally a pre-judgment (from the Latin\nprae-judicium) that was lost during the Renaissance. In\nTruth and Method, Gadamer redeploys the notion of our prior\nhermeneutical situatedness as it is worked out in more particular\nfashion in Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time (first published\nin 1927) in terms of the \u2018fore-structures\u2019 of\nunderstanding, that is, in terms of the anticipatory structures that\nallow what is to be interpreted or understood to be grasped in a\npreliminary fashion. The fact that understanding operates by means of\nsuch anticipatory structures means that understanding always involves\nwhat Gadamer terms the \u2018anticipation of\ncompleteness\u2019\u2014it always involves the revisable\npresupposition that what is to be understood constitutes something\nthat is understandable, that is, something that is constituted as a\ncoherent, and therefore meaningful, whole.\n\nGadamer\u2019s positive conception of prejudice as pre-judgment is\nconnected with several ideas in his approach to hermeneutics. The way\nin which our prejudgments open us up to the matter at issue in such a\nway that those prejudgments are themselves capable of being revised\nexhibits the character of the Gadamerian conception of prejudgment,\nand its role in understanding, as itself constituting a version of the\nhermeneutic circle. The hermeneutical priority Gadamer assigns to\nprejudgment is also tied to Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on the priority\nof the question in the structure of understanding\u2014the latter\nemphasis being something Gadamer takes both from Platonic dialectic\nand also, in Truth and Method, from the work of R. G.\nCollingwood. Moreover, the indispensable role of prejudgment in\nunderstanding connects directly with Gadamer\u2019s rethinking of the\ntraditional concept of hermeneutics as necessarily involving, not\nmerely explication, but also application. In this respect,\nall interpretation, even of the past, is necessarily\n\u2018prejudgmental\u2019 in the sense that it is always oriented to\npresent concerns and interests, and it is those present concerns and\ninterests that allow us to enter into the dialogue with the matter at\nissue. Here, of course, there is a further connection with the\nAristotelian emphasis on the practical\u2014not only is understanding\na matter of the application of something like \u2018practical\nwisdom\u2019, but it is also always determined by the practical\ncontext out of which it arises.\n\nThe prejudicial character of understanding means that, whenever we\nunderstand, we are necessarily involved in a dialogue that encompasses\nboth our own self-understanding and our understanding of the matter at\nissue (and there is, it should be added, an essential alterity that\nobtains even in those cases where our engagement is primarily\ntextual). In the dialogue of understanding our prejudices come to the\nfore, both inasmuch as they play a crucial role in opening up what is\nto be understood, and inasmuch as they themselves become evident in\nthat process. As our prejudices thereby become apparent to us, so they\ncan also become the focus of questioning in their own turn. While\nGadamer has claimed that \u2018temporal distance\u2019 can play a\nuseful role in enabling us better to identify those prejudices that\nexercise a problematic influence on understanding (Gadamer\nacknowledges that prejudices can sometimes distort\u2014the point is\nthat they do not always do so), it seems better to see the dialogical\ninterplay that occurs in the process of understanding itself as the\nmeans by which such problematic elements are identified and worked\nthrough. One consequence of Gadamer\u2019s rehabilitation of\nprejudice is a positive evaluation of the role of authority and\ntradition as legitimate sources of knowledge, and this has often been\nseen, most famously by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, as indicative of\nGadamer\u2019s ideological conservatism\u2014Gadamer himself viewed\nit as merely providing a proper corrective to the over-reaction\nagainst these ideas that occurred with the Enlightenment.\n3.2 The Happening of Tradition\n\nInasmuch as understanding always occurs against the background of our\nprior involvement, so it always occurs on the basis of our\nhistory. Understanding, for Gadamer, is thus always an\n\u2018effect\u2019 of history, while hermeneutical\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 is itself that mode of being that is\nconscious of its own historical \u2018being effected\u2019\u2014it\nis \u2018historically-effected consciousness\u2019\n(wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein). Awareness of the\nhistorically effected character of understanding is, according to\nGadamer, identical with an awareness of the hermeneutical situation\nand he also refers to that situation by means of the phenomenological\nconcept of \u2018horizon\u2019\n(Horizont)\u2014understanding and interpretation thus always\noccurs from within a particular \u2018horizon\u2019 that is\ndetermined by our historically-determined situatedness. Understanding\nis not, however, imprisoned within the horizon of its\nsituation\u2014indeed, the horizon of understanding is neither static\nnor unchanging (it is, after all, always subject to the effects of\nhistory). Just as our prejudices are themselves brought into question\nin the process of understanding, so, in the encounter with another, is\nthe horizon of our own understanding susceptible to change.\n\nGadamer views understanding as a matter of negotiation between oneself\nand one\u2019s partner in the hermeneutical dialogue such that the\nprocess of understanding can be seen as a matter of coming to an\n\u2018agreement\u2019 about the matter at issue. Coming to such an\nagreement means establishing a common framework or\n\u2018horizon\u2019 and Gadamer thus takes understanding to be a\nprocess of the \u2018fusion of horizons\u2019\n(Horizontverschmelzung). In phenomenology, the\n\u2018horizon\u2019 is, in general terms, that larger context of\nmeaning in which any particular meaningful presentation is situated.\nInasmuch as understanding is taken to involve a \u2018fusion of\nhorizons\u2019, then so it always involves the formation of a new\ncontext of meaning that enables integration of what is otherwise\nunfamiliar, strange or anomalous. In this respect, all understanding\ninvolves a process of mediation and dialogue between what is familiar\nand what is alien in which neither remains unaffected. This process of\nhorizontal engagement is an ongoing one that never achieves any final\ncompletion or complete elucidation\u2014moreover, inasmuch as our own\nhistory and tradition is itself constitutive of our own hermeneutic\nsituation as well as being itself constantly taken up in the process\nof understanding, so our historical and hermeneutic situation can\nnever be made completely transparent to us. As a consequence, Gadamer\nexplicitly takes issue with the Hegelian \u2018philosophy of\nreflection\u2019 that aims at just such completion and\ntransparency.\n\nIn contrast with the traditional hermeneutic account, Gadamer thus\nadvances a view of understanding that rejects the idea of\nunderstanding as achieved through gaining access to some inner realm\nof subjective meaning. Moreover, since understanding is an ongoing\nprocess, rather than something that is ever completed, so he also\nrejects the idea that there is any final determinacy to understanding.\nIt is on this basis that Gadamer argues against there being any method\nor technique for achieving understanding or arriving at truth. The\nsearch for a methodology for the Geisteswissenschaften that\nwould place them on a sound footing alongside the \u2018sciences of\nnature\u2019 (the Naturwissenschaften)\u2014a search that\nhad characterized much previous hermeneutical inquiry\u2014is thus\nshown to be fundamentally misguided. Not only is there no methodology\nthat describes the means by which to arrive at an understanding of the\nhuman or the historical, but neither is there any such methodology\nthat is adequate to the understanding of the non-human or the natural.\nGadamer\u2019s conception of understanding as not reducible to method\nor technique, along with his insistence of understanding as an ongoing\nprocess that has no final completion, not only invites comparison with\nideas to be found in the work of the later Wittgenstein, but can also\nbe seen as paralleling developments in post-Kuhnian philosophy of\nscience.\n3.3 The Linguisticality of Understanding\n\nThe basic model of understanding that Gadamer finally arrives at in\nTruth and Method is that of dialogue or\nconversation. A conversation involves an exchange between\nconversational partners that seeks agreement about some matter at\nissue; consequently, such an exchange is never completely under the\ncontrol of either conversational partner, but is rather determined by\nthe matter at issue. Conversation always takes place in language and\nsimilarly Gadamer views understanding as always linguistically\nmediated. Since both conversation and understanding involve coming to\nan agreement, so Gadamer argues that all understanding involves\nsomething like a common language, albeit a common language that is\nitself formed in the process of understanding itself (and that, one\nmight argue, is also constantly formed and reformed in that very\nprocess). In this sense, all understanding is, according to Gadamer,\ninterpretative, and, insofar as all interpretation involves the\nexchange between the familiar and the alien, so all interpretation is\nalso translative. Gadamer\u2019s commitment to the linguisticality of\nunderstanding also commits him to a view of understanding as\nessentially a matter of conceptual articulation. This does not rule\nout the possibility of other modes of understanding, but it does give\nprimacy to language and conceptuality in hermeneutic experience.\nIndeed, Gadamer takes language to be, not merely some instrument by\nmeans of which we are able to engage with the world, but as instead\nthe very medium for such engagement. We are \u2018in\u2019 the world\nthrough being \u2018in\u2019 language. This emphasis on the\nlinguisticality of understanding does not, however, lead Gadamer into\nany form of linguistic relativism. Just as we are not held inescapably\ncaptive within the circle of our prejudices, or within the effects of\nour history, neither are we held captive within language. Language is\nthat within which anything that is intelligible can be comprehended,\nit is also that within which we encounter ourselves and others. In\nthis respect, language is itself understood as essentially dialogue or\nconversation. Like Wittgenstein, as well as Davidson, Gadamer thus\nrejects the idea of such a thing as a \u2018private\nlanguage\u2019\u2014language always involves others, just as it\nalways involves the world.\n\nGadamer claims that language is the universal horizon of hermeneutic\nexperience; he also claims that the hermeneutic experience is itself\nuniversal. This is not merely in the sense that the experience of\nunderstanding is familiar or ubiquitous. The universality of\nhermeneutics derives from the existential claim for hermeneutics that\nHeidegger advanced in the 1920s and that Gadamer made into a central\nidea in his own thinking. Hermeneutics concerns our fundamental mode\nof being in the world and understanding is thus the basic phenomenon\nin our existence. We cannot go back \u2018behind\u2019\nunderstanding, since to do so would be to suppose that there was a\nmode of intelligibility that was prior to understanding. Hermeneutics\nthus turns out to be universal, not merely in regard to knowledge,\nwhether in the \u2018human sciences\u2019 or elsewhere, but to all\nunderstanding and, indeed, to philosophy itself. Philosophy is, in its\nessence, hermeneutics. Gadamer\u2019s claim for the universality of\nhermeneutics was one of the explicit points at issue in the debate\nbetween Gadamer and Habermas (see Ormiston & Schrift [eds.] 1990);\nit can also be seen as, in a certain sense, underlying the engagement\nbetween Gadamer and Derrida (see Michelfelder & Palmer [eds.]\n1989), although in Derrida\u2019s case this consisted in a denial of\nthe primacy of understanding, and the possibility of agreement, on\nwhich hermeneutics itself rests.\n4. Philosophy and the History of Philosophy\n\nGadamer\u2019s commitment to the historically conditioned character\nof understanding, coupled with the hermeneutic imperative that we\nengage with our historical situatedness, means that he takes\nphilosophy to itself stand in a critical relation to the history of\nphilosophy. Gadamer\u2019s own thought certainly reflects a\nhermeneutical commitment to both philosophical dialogue and historical\nengagement. His public debates with contemporary figures such as\nHabermas and Derrida, although they have not always lived up to\nGadamer\u2019s own ideals of hermeneutic dialogue (at least not in\nrespect of Derrida), have provided clear evidence of Gadamer\u2019s\nown commitment to such engagement. The dialogue with philosophy and\nits history also makes up a large part of Gadamer\u2019s published\nwork and, while that dialogue has encompassed a range of thinkers, its\nprimary focus has been on Plato, Aristotle, Hegel and Heidegger.\n\nIn the case of Plato and Aristotle (see Gadamer 1980, 1986a, 1991),\nGadamer has argued for a particular way of reading both thinkers that\nattends to the character of their texts, that takes those texts to\ndisplay a high degree of consistency, and that, particularly in the\nlater work, also views Plato and Aristotle as holding essentially\nsimilar views. In The Beginning of Philosophy (1997a),\nGadamer also takes Plato and Aristotle as providing the indispensable\npoint of entry to an understanding of Pre-Socratic thought. When it\ncomes to Hegel (see Gadamer 1971), although there is much that Gadamer\nfinds sympathetic to his own hermeneutic project (particularly\nHegel\u2019s attempt to move beyond the dichotomy of subject and\nobject, as well as aspects of Hegel\u2019s revival of ancient\ndialectic), Gadamer\u2019s commitment to a hermeneutics of finitude\n(and so to what Hegel terms \u2018bad infinity\u2019) places him in\ndirect opposition to the Hegelian philosophy of reflection that aims\nat totality and completion. It is with Heidegger, however, that\nGadamer had his most significant, sustained and yet also most\nproblematic philosophical engagement (see especially Gadamer 1994a).\nAlthough Gadamer emphasized the continuities between his own work and\nthat of Heidegger, and was clearly gratified by those occasions when\nHeidegger gave his approval to Gadamer\u2019s work, he can also be\nseen as involved in a subtle reworking of Heidegger\u2019s ideas. On\na number of points, that reworking has a rather different character\nfrom that which is explicit in Heidegger. In particular, Gadamer\nargues that Heidegger\u2019s attempts, in his later thinking, to find\na \u2018non-metaphysical\u2019 path of thought led Heidegger into a\nsituation in which he experienced a \u2018lack of (or need for)\nlanguage\u2019 (a Sprachnot). Gadamer\u2019s own work can\nthus be seen as an attempt to take up the path of Heidegger\u2019s\nlater thought in a way that does not abandon, but rather attempts to\nwork with our existing language. Similarly, while Heidegger views the\nhistory of philosophy as characterized by a \u2018forgetting\u2019\nof being\u2014a forgetting that is inaugurated by Plato\u2014Gadamer\ntakes the history of philosophy to have no such tendency. In this\nrespect, many of the differences between Gadamer and Heidegger become\nclearest in their differing readings of the philosophical tradition,\nas well as in their approaches to poets such as H\u00f6lderlin.\n5. Literature and Art\n\nOver and above his concern with aesthetics as a philosophical theme,\nthe engagement with literature and art has been a continuing feature\nthroughout Gadamer\u2019s life and work and, in particular, Gadamer\nhas written extensively on poets such as Celan, Goethe,\nH\u00f6lderlin, and Rilke (see especially Gadamer 1994b, 1997c).\nGadamer\u2019s engagement with art is strongly influenced by his\ndialogue with the history of philosophy, and he draws explicitly on\nHegel as well as Plato. At the same time, that engagement provides an\nexemplification of Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics as well as a means to\ndevelop it further, while his hermeneutic approach to art itself\nconstitutes a rethinking of aesthetics through the integration of\naesthetics into hermeneutics (on Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics in general, see\nAthos, 2013; Davey, 2013; Nielsen, 2023).\n\nIn contrast to much contemporary aesthetics, Gadamer takes the\nexperience of beauty to be central to an understanding of the nature\nof art and in the final pages of Truth and Method, he\ndiscusses the beautiful as that which is self-evidently present to us\n(as \u2018radiant\u2019) exploring also the close relationship\nbetween the beautiful and the true. Of particular importance in his\nwriting about art and literature are the three ideas that appear in\nthe subtitle to \u2018The Relevance of the Beautiful\u2019 (1986b):\nart as play, symbol and festival. The role of play is a central notion\nin Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic thinking generally, providing the basis\nfor Gadamer\u2019s account of the experience both of art and\nunderstanding (see\n Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n above). The symbolic character of the artwork is seen, by Gadamer,\nnot in terms of any form of simple \u2018representationalism\u2019,\nbut instead in terms of the character of art as always showing\nsomething more than is literally present to us in the work (this\naspect of art as referring outside itself is also taken up by Gadamer\nelsewhere in relation to the character of art as\n\u2018imitation\u2019\u2014mimesis). The artwork, no\nmatter what its medium, opens up, through its symbolic character, a\nspace in which both the world, and our own being in the world, are\nbrought to light as a single, but inexhaustibly rich totality. In the\nexperience of art, we are not merely given a \u2018moment\u2019 of\nvision, but are able to \u2018dwell\u2019 along with the work in a\nway that takes us out of ordinary time into what Gadamer calls\n\u2018fulfilled\u2019 or \u2018autonomous\u2019 time. Thus the\nartwork has a festive, as well as symbolic and playful character,\nsince the festival similarly takes us out of ordinary time, while\nopening us up to the true possibility of community. Gadamer returned\nspecifically to the question of art in his late essay (from 1992)\n\u2018The Artwork in Word and Image: \"So True, So Full of\nBeing\"\u2019(Gadamer, 2007, pp. 192\u2013224) in which he draws out the\ncharacter of interpretation as not something additional to the work or\nart, but that in which the artwork is itself realized. In so doing,\nGadamer also enlarges and expands the idea of interpretation that was\nevident in his earlier works, drawing on the experience of reading in\na way that not only shows the richness of textual engagement, but also\nbrings out the dynamic, performative, and essentially\nother-involving-character of all interpretation.\n\nAlthough much of Gadamer\u2019s writing on art focuses on poetry, as well\nas the visual arts, he has also addressed questions of music (see\nGadamer 2021, 2022), and Gadamer\u2019s work is increasingly evident in\ncontemporary philosophy of music, especially in discussions of musical\nperformance and improvisation (see eg. Benson, 2003; McAuliffe, 2023;\nNielsen, 2023). Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on the dynamic and performative\ncharacter of understanding has an obvious relevance to music, but\nmusic itself provides a valuable source for thinking about the\ncharacter of art and understanding in general.\n6. Practical Philosophy\n\nThere is, according to Gadamer, a continuity between a hermeneutics\n\u2018that is aware of its philosophic implications\u2019 and \u2018the great\ntradition of practical philosophy\u2019 (Gadamer, 2007, p.245), and such a\nclaim would already seem to be implicit in the idea that\ninterpretation and application are tied together through the\nembeddedness of interpretation in the hermeneutical situation. Gadamer\nhas himself engaged, however, in direct reflection on a range of\nconcrete contemporary issues (see Gadamer 1976a, 1989a, 1993b, 1998b,\n1999, 2001, see also Krajewski 2003). Gadamer\u2019s discussion of\nthese issues draws directly upon his more theoretical discussions of\nhermeneutics elsewhere, sometimes serving to provide further\nelaboration and illumination of the ideas at work in those\ndiscussions. A central concern in many of Gadamer\u2019s essays is\nthe role of Europe, and European culture, in the contemporary\nworld\u2014something that was especially pressing for Gadamer with\nthe advent of German reunification and the expansion of the European\ncommunity (see especially Gadamer 1989a). Here, however, a number of\nother closely connected issues also come into view: the nature and\nrole of modern science and technology (see especially 1976a, 1998b),\nand together with this, the role of the humanities; the question of\neducation and, in particular, of humanistic education (1992); the\nissue of understanding between cultures, and especially between\nreligions, and the issue of world literature (see especially George\n2020).  In addition, Gadamer has written on matters concerning law,\nethics, the changing character of the modern university, the\nconnection between philosophy and politics, and the nature of medical\npractice and the concept of health (see especially Gadamer 1993b, see\nalso see Aho 2022).\n\nIn almost all of these areas, Gadamer\u2019s approach is\ncharacterized, not by the attempt to apply pre-existing theory to the\ndomain in question, but rather by the attempt to think from within\nthat domain, and in a way that is attentive to it, that also entails a\nreciprocity between the theoretical and the applied. As Gadamer\ncomments in Truth and Method, \u2018application is neither a\nsubsequent nor merely an occasional part of the phenomenon of\nunderstanding, but co-determines it as a whole from the\nbeginning\u2019 (Gadamer 1989b, 324). Theory and application do not\noccur, then, in separation from one another, but are part of a single\nhermeneutical \u2018practice\u2019. The interdependence of\nphilosophical theory and practical application, often in the form of\nan interdependence between theoretical engagement in one domain and\nengagement in another, is evident to a degree in some of the very\nearly responses to Gadamer\u2019s work by thinkers from outside of\nphilosophy who had interests in the implications of hermeneutic\nthinking within their own specific domains. Thus Gadamer\u2019s work\nwas famously taken up in the 1960s by the Italian jurist Emilio Betti\n(see Betti, 2021[1964], pp. 45\u201361), and Betti\u2019s work was also\ndrawn upon by E. D. Hirsch whose concerns came from the direction of\nliterary theory (see Hirsch, 1965, 1967). Theology was another area\nwhere Gadamer had an early impact (see eg. Robinson. and Cobb, 1964),\npartly reinforced through connections between his work and that of the\ntheologian Bernard Lonergan (see Lawrence, 1984).\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking has continued to be influential in legal\ntheory and jurisprudence (see Mootz 2007), in literary theory (see\nWeinsheimer, 1991), and theology (see Lawrence, 2006), but the\ninterconnection of philosophical and practical hermeneutics that is\nevident in Gadamer\u2019s own work has itself been reflected in the\nway that work has been taken up in relation to practical and applied\nissues within many other domains\u2014within, for instance, health\nand medical practice (see e.g., Svenaueus 2003), intercultural studies\n(see e.g., Garfield 2002, Lammi 2008)), education (see e.g., Fairfield\n2012), environmental education and ecology (see e.g., Gr\u00fcn\n2005),architecture (see e.g. Snodgrass and Coyne 2006), and political\ntheory (see e.g. Walhof, 2022)(on many of these topics, see also the\nvarious chapters in Malpas & Gander 2014). Gadamer\u2019s work\nhas also seen application, though not uncontentiously, within feminism\n(see Homan, 2022) and contemporary race theory (Botts, 2022).\n\nThat practical engagement is an essential element in Gadamer\u2019s\nthinking implies that it cannot be seen to stand aside from questions\nof ethics. Gadamer never developed a book-length treatment that\naddresses such questions, but there is clearly an ethical current that\nruns throughout his thinking, and that is discernible, for instance,\nin his emphasis on the conversational character of hermeneutic\nengagement as well as his later reflections on the relation to the\nother (including on themes of friendship and solidarity) (see Gadamer\n1999). It is also clearly evident in the engagement with Aristotle\nthat runs throughout Gadamer\u2019s work as well as his engagement\nwith Plato (notably Gadamer, 1991). Despite the absence of a fully\ndeveloped account, Gadamer has addressed the matter of ethics directly\nin, most notably, \u2018On the Possibility of a Philosophical\nEthics\u2019 (Gadamer, 1999, pp. 18\u201336 and 2007, pp. 274\u2013289), in which\nGadamer argues against Kantian formalism in favor of a more\nAristotelian approach. The issue of the ethical dimension in\nGadamer\u2019s thought and in hermeneutics more generally has also\nbeen taken up in the work of others (see especially Schmidt, 2015;\nGeorge, 2020).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources (in English)</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<h4>Works in German</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1985\u20131995, <em>Gesammelte Werke</em>, 10 vols.,\nT\u00fcbingen: J.C.B.
