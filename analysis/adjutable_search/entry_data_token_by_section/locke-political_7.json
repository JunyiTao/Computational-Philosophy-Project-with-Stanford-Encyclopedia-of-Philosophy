    "main_text": "Toleration\n8. Education and Politics\n\nLocke\u2019s epistemological positions in the Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding lead him to take education to be extremely\nimportant for his political philosophy. His attack on innate ideas\nincreases the importance of giving children the right sort of\neducation to help them get the right sorts of ideas. He also notes in\nthe Essay that human beings govern themselves by a variety of\ndifferent laws, the most practically efficacious of which is the\n\u201cLaw of Opinion or Reputation.\u201d (Essay\n2.28.10) Since people are often highly motivated to be well thought of\nby others, the moral standards that are operative within a society for\nallocating praise and blame are powerful and important. Ideally, these\nsocial norms will reinforce natural law and thus help stabilize\npolitical society. Locke\u2019s educational writings suggest how\nchildren might be raised in such a way that they will be the sorts of\ncitizens who function well in a liberal society (Tarcov 1984). Some\nthink that Locke\u2019s approach to education, which centers\neducation within the family, gives the state too little influence over\nthe formation of future citizens (Gutmann 1999), while others think\nLocke actually gives the state considerable power to regulate\neducation (Tuckness 2010b).\n\nLocke\u2019s main educational writing is Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation, and it is based on letters of advice that Locke wrote\nto his friend Edward Clarke. This context means that the book assumes\na person of relative wealth who will be overseeing the education of\nhis son. The book was extremely popular and went through numerous\neditions in the century after its publication. One of the striking\nfeatures of the book is the way parents are encouraged to develop and\naugment the child\u2019s love for praise and esteem (Some\nThoughts, 56\u201362). Cultivating this desire helps the child\nlearn to hold in check other harmful desires, such as the desire for\ndominion, and to learn to control impulses by not acting on them until\nafter reflecting on them.\n\nSome contemporary critics of Locke, inspired by Foucault, argue that\nLocke\u2019s education is not a recipe for liberty but for forming\nchildren who will be compliant subjects of liberal regimes (Baltes\n2016, Carrig 2001, Metha 1992). Locke encourages parents to tightly\nregulate the social environments of children to avoid children being\ncorrupted by the wrong ideas and influences. Locke hopes for children\nwho have internalized strong powers of self-denial and a work ethic\nthat will make them compliant in an emerging modern economy. If\nparents are tightly controlling the child\u2019s educational\nenvironment with the goal of producing a particular sort of child, and\nif in reality people are primarily guided by the repetitional norms\nthat govern praise and blame, critics claim that this reveals the\nautonomous liberal subject to be, in reality, a guise for imposed\nconformity.\n\nDefenders of Locke argue that this critique underestimates the\norientation of Locke\u2019s education toward meaningful freedom.\nThere are reasons for thinking that, under normal circumstances, the\nlaw of nature and the law of reputation will coincide with each other,\nminimizing the potential harms that come from people following the law\nof reputation (Stuart-Buttle 2017). Locke\u2019s education is\ndesigned to increase compliance with natural law (Brady 2013). Much\ndepends on whether one thinks conformity with natural law decreases or\nincreases freedom. While it is true that Locke recognizes the social\nnature of the Lockean subject, Locke does not think habituation and\nautonomy are necessarily opposed (Koganzon 2016, Nazar 2017). Because\nhuman beings naturally conform to the prevailing norms in their\nsociety, in the absence of a Lockean education people would not be\nmore free because they would simply conform to those norms.\nLocke\u2019s education is designed to give children the ability, when\nthey are older, to evaluate critically, and possibly reject,\nprevailing norms. Locke also assumes that the isolation of early\nchildhood will end and that adolescent children will normally think\ndifferently from their parents (Koganzon 2016). In fact, Locke may\neven use custom to help people rationally evaluate their customary\nprejudices (Grant 2012).\n",
