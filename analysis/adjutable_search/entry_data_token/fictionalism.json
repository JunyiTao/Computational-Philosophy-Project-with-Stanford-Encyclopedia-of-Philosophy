Brief History and Overview\n\nSome historically especially important precursors to modern\nfictionalism are Jeremy Bentham (see Ogden 1932), who defended the\nview that many entities referred to in ordinary discourse are\n\u201cfictitious\u201d, Hans Vaihinger, with his philosophy of the\n\u201cas if\u201d, and, specifically in the moral case, Friedrich\nNietzsche, whose view has been argued to amount to moral fictionalism.\nVoltaire\u2019s famous \u201cIf God did not exist, it would be\nnecessary to invent him\u201d can be seen as expressing a\nfictionalist stance toward theism. Moreover, George Berkeley\u2019s\nadvice to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar is often\ntaken to express a fictionalist stance (from \u00a751 of A\nTreatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, defending\nhis immaterialism from the charge that it does not fit the way we\nspeak). Sometimes Hume is mentioned as an early fictionalist (see for\nexample Varzi 2013). There are arguably earlier predecessors as well.\nOne possible example is the Pyrrhonist view that we should live\nwithout belief (see Sextus Empiricus, \u201cOutlines of\nScepticism\u201d). Moreover, the doctrine of the two truths in\nBuddhist philosophy has been interpreted as a distinction between\nfictional truth and real truth (see Garfield 2006). Pierre Duhem\n(1913) argues that the dominant view on astronomy before the advent of\nmodern physics was that a fictionalist attitude was appropriate. For\nsome discussion of these historical precursors, see Gideon Rosen\n(2005) (for a discussion of Pyrrhonism, the early history of\nastronomy, and Bentham), Arthur Fine (1993) (for a discussion of\nVaihinger), and Nadeem Hussain (2007) (for a discussion of Nietzsche\nand other 19th century German philosophers with fictionalist\ntendencies).\n\nMore recently, Hartry Field (1980 and 1989), Joseph Melia (e.g. 2000),\nMark Balaguer (e.g. 1998) and Stephen Yablo (see especially 2000a,\n2000b, 2001 and 2002) have defended fictionalism about mathematical\ndiscourse (see here the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics);\n Bas van Fraassen (1980) has defended a version of fictionalism about\nscientific theories; Richard Joyce (2001, 2005), Mark Kalderon (2005a)\nand Daniel Nolan, Greg Restall and Caroline West (2005) have defended\nmoral fictionalism; Kendall Walton (1985, 1990 , 2000), Mark Crimmins\n(1998), Stuart Brock (2002), Mark Balaguer (1998a), Anthony Everett\n(2005), and Frederick Kroon (2000, 2004) have defended fictionalism\nabout things like negative existentials, identity statements,\npropositional attitude reports, and fictional characters; Peter van\nInwagen (1990) and Cian Dorr and Gideon Rosen (2002) have defended\nfictionalism about ordinary object discourse; Bradley Armour-Garb and\nJames Woodbridge (2015) and Alexis Burgess and John Burgess (2011)\nhave defended fictionalism about truth; and D.M. Armstrong (1989),\nGideon Rosen (1990), John Nolt (1986), Seahwa Kim (2005) and John\nDivers (1999) have defended modal fictionalism (see here the entry on\n modal fictionalism).\n Needless to say, this is a just a sample of recent defenses of\nfictionalist views. The present entry will be more focused on\nfictionalism as a general strategy in philosophy than on fictionalism\nabout specific discourses. For some recent overviews of fictionalism,\nsee Kroon (2011), Caddick Bourne (2013), Divers and Liggins (2005),\nSainsbury (2010), and the full-length book on fictionalism Kroon,\nMcKeown-Green and Brock (2018). Important collections of texts on\nfictionalism are Kalderon (2005b) and Armour-Garb and Kroon\n(forthcoming). \n2. Some Qualifications and Distinctions\n\nThe earlier provisional characterization of fictionalism needs\nqualification and supplementation. In this section, more precision\nwill be provided.\n2.1 Language and ontology\n\nA first crucial distinction is between a linguistic and an\nontological thesis. The linguistic thesis is, roughly, that\nalready expressed above, according to which utterances of sentences of\nthe discourse are best seen not as efforts to say what is literally\ntrue, but as useful fictions of some sort. The ontological thesis, by\ncontrast, is the thesis that the entities characteristic of the\ndiscourse do not exist, or have the ontological status of fictional\nentities. One can in principle embrace the linguistic thesis without\nembracing the ontological thesis, and vice versa.\n\nOften the theses are run together. Nolan, Restall and West (2005) say,\nwhen introducing fictionalism, \u201cThe simplest fictionalist\napproach to a discourse takes certain claims in that discourse to be\nliterally false, but nevertheless worth uttering in certain contexts,\nsince the pretence that such claims are true is worthwhile for various\ntheoretical purposes\u201d. (The complication that they introduce is\nthat some fictionalists may simply be agnostic about the\nrelevant claims.) Zolt\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 (2001) says, \u201cTo be\na fictionalist about Fs is to think that our na\u00efve\nattitude toward F-discourse is only halfway correct: we are\nright in thinking that we use genuine singular terms that purport to\nrefer to Fs, but wrong in thinking that they actually succeed\nin referring. In engaging in F-discourse we inadvertently\nslip into fictional talk\u201d. One reason that the linguistic and\nontological theses are often run together is that the linguistic\nthesis is often motivated by ontological concerns. For example,\nsomeone who is a nominalist might on that ground find herself\nattracted to fictionalism about mathematical discourse. \n\nThe focus in this entry will primarily be on the linguistic thesis.\nThe ontological thesis might be held by someone who holds that we are\nbetter off simply abandoning or rejecting the target discourse, and\nthat is not a distinctively fictionalist thesis.\n2.2 Hermeneutic and revolutionary fictionalism\n\nA second distinction is between hermeneutic and\nrevolutionary\n fictionalism.[1]\n Hermeneutic fictionalism about a discourse D is a thesis\nabout the actual nature of the discourse: according to hermeneutic\nfictionalism we actually do not aim at the literal truth but only\nappear or pretend to do so. Revolutionary fictionalism, by contrast,\ninsists that when engaging in D we ought only to\nmake such pretend-assertions; the point of engaging in D\nwould be achieved by pretend-assertions. Obviously, hermeneutic and\nrevolutionary fictionalism are different theses and must be evaluated\nseparately. In the rest of the discussion in section 2, I will focus\nprimarily on hermeneutic fictionalism. I trust that it will be\nstraightforward to see how the points generalize to revolutionary\nfictionalism.\n2.3 Meaning versus use\n\nMost hermeneutic fictionalists about some particular discourse hold\nthat although we normally utter sentences within the discourse in a\nfictional spirit, we could, and perhaps sometimes do, use these\nsentences literally. For example, a mathematical fictionalist might\nhold that when we utter \u201cthere are prime numbers\u201d in\nordinary contexts we mean this in a fictional spirit, but add that\nwhen we utter this sentence in the philosophy room we sometimes intend\nto speak literally. But one can at least imagine a different kind of\nhermeneutic fictionalism. Take the case of discourse about fictional\ncharacters. A name like \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 is first introduced\nfor the purposes of story telling and for making claims internal to\nthe story; for example, the claim that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple\nunder the sea. But there is disagreement about the proper account of\nthe use of names of fictional entities extrafictive, non-story-telling\ncontexts, e.g. in \u201cSpongeBob is a better role model than\nSuperman\u201d. Some philosophers hold that this\n\u2018extrafictive\u2019 use of fictional names shows that\n\u2018SpongeBob\u2019 has a reference outside the fiction (for\nexample, that it refers to an abstract entity). Others hold that while\n\u2018SpongeBob\u2019 can be used meaningfully in such contexts, it\nis nonetheless, in such contexts, a mere non-referring empty name,\nalongside \u2018Zeus\u2019 and \u2018Vulcan\u2019. But we can\nimagine a third kind of view, according to which names of fictional\ncharacters are, as it were, only meaningful inside the fiction. Anyone\nattracted to such a view must tell some special story about seeming\nextrafictive truths (Brock 2002). Similarly, and returning to\nfictionalism, one can imagine a fictionalist about some discourse who\ndenies that the relevant sentences even can be meaningfully used\noutside the pretense; who holds that the sentences only have\npretense-uses.\n\nThe view may sound farfetched. But Yablo (1998) comes close to\nsuggesting a view of this sort when he says, after having motivated\nfictionalism about the use of names of cities, that he does not know\nwhat it would be to use \u201cChicago exists\u201d more literally\nthan he already does. Let us call the fictionalism according to which\nthere is a literal use of the sentences in question with which the\nordinary use contrasts use fictionalism; call the other\nmeaning fictionalism. The distinction may correspond to\nArmour-Garb and Woodbridge\u2019s (2015) distinction between\nextrinsic and intrinsic pretense. Armour-Garb and\nWoodbridge say that what characterizes extrinsic pretense is that we\ncould take the utterance made literally, whereas in cases of\nintrinsic pretense, \u201cthe pretense is integral to the utterance\nsaying anything at all\u201d. Use fictionalism is arguably by far the\nmore common doctrine. But it is worth mentioning meaning fictionalism\nas well, both because some fictionalists appear to endorse it, and\nbecause the distinction will be relevant to some of the arguments\nagainst fictionalism. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge call their own brand\nof fictionalism semantic and oppose what they call pragmatic accounts.\n\n\nThere are further distinctions in the general vicinity. Following\nYablo (2001), one can distinguish between the following fictionalist\nviews (about discourse about Xs):\n\n\nInstrumentalism: the speaker is not \u201creally\u201d asserting\nanything, only pretending to do so.\n\nMeta-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that\naccording to a certain fiction, the Xs are so and so.\n\nObject-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting\nthat the world is in a certain condition, namely, the condition it\nneeds to be in to make it true in the relevant fiction that the\nXs are so and so.\n\nFiguralism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that\nsomething is in a certain condition, but perhaps not the\nworld; the Xs are functioning as representational aids in a\nfigurative description of the Ys, where the Ys may\nthemselves be representational aids invoked to help us describe still\nfurther objects.\n\n\nLet us take number discourse as our example, and consider these\nfictionalist views as applied to number discourse. The instrumentalist\nsays that in an utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is\ntwo\u201d, the speaker is merely pretending to assert something;\nnothing is really asserted. The instrumentalist does not present an\nalternative account of what the speaker is doing. The metafictionalist\nsays that something is asserted along the lines of: according to the\nnumber fiction, the number of apples is two. The object fictionalist\nsays that what is asserted is something non-number-involving about the\nreal world \u2014 something which would make it true in the fiction\nthat the number of apples is two: that there is an apple x and\nan apple y such that x and y are distinct and\nnothing distinct from both x and y is an apple. The\ncharacteristic objects of the discourse, the numbers, are mere aids we\nuse to make utterances about how things stand in the real world.\nYablo\u2019s own preferred view, figuralism, is supposed to be a\nclose cousin of object fictionalism, but with an added twist.\nFiguralism does not differ from object fictionalism in what it says\nabout the example used so far. The differences only show up when we\nare considering utterances intuitively about these props themselves,\nthe numbers, such as \u201c7 is smaller than 11\u201d. Sometimes,\nYablo says, numbers \u2014 and other props \u2014 are used as mere\nrepresentational aids, but sometimes they also function as things\nrepresented. (He provides as a comparison \u201cpinpricks of\nconscience register less than pangs of conscience.\u201d) In a\ntypical utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is two\u201d, the\nnumber functions as a representational aid. But in \u201cthere are\nnumbers\u201d as used by the platonist, numbers function as things\nrepresented. And in \u201cthe number of even primes is zero\u201d,\nas a nominalist can be envisaged to use it when doing philosophy,\nsaying something that given her philosophical views is true, they\nfunction both as representational aids (\u201cnumber\u201d) and as\nthings represented (\u201ceven prime\u201d). (Compare also the\ncatalogue of fictionalist views in Kalderon 2005a, ch. 3.) \n\nA broader distinction is that between what can be called content\nfictionalism and force fictionalism. The content\nfictionalist holds that in (ordinary) utterances of sentences of\nD some content is asserted, but what is asserted is something\nother than their literal content. The force fictionalist holds that\nthe content expressed in an (ordinary) utterance of a sentence of\nD is not asserted: instead some other speech act is\nperformed. Instrumentalism is a form of force fictionalism. The other\nforms of fictionalism are in the first instance forms of content\nfictionalism. Notice that content and force fictionalism can be\ncombined. A fictionalist can hold both that in an (ordinary) utterance\nof sentence of D, the literal content of the sentence is\nconveyed but not asserted, and that some content other than the\nliteral content is asserted. This is even a rather natural view: in an\nordinary utterance of a sentence of D, the speaker\npretends-true the literal content of the sentence, and in so doing she\nasserts something other than the literal content.\n\nSometimes when fictionalism is discussed, it is presupposed that\nfictionalism would have to be of the meta-fictionalist variety. This\nis a mistake. There are objections to meta-fictionalism that do not\ngeneralize to other fictionalist theses. Joyce (2005) stresses that\nmeta-fictionalism does not adequately distinguish between telling a\nstory and describing a story. When we engage in fiction we do the\nformer, but the meta-fictionalist has it that we do the latter. Yablo\n(2001) stresses, in the case of mathematical fictionalism, that in\nordinary uses of mathematical sentences, we seem to assert something\napriori and necessary, but it does not seem apriori and necessary that\naccording to the fiction of standard mathematics, things stand\nthus-and-so. Generally, meta-fictionalism forces attention to the\n\u201caccording to the fiction\u2026\u201d-operator, but the\nproblems that arise are beside the point on either of the other\nfictionalist views. (See Kim 2005 for a discussion of some of the\nproblems that arise, having to do with, e.g., the contingent existence\nof fictions.)\n2.4 Attitudes\n\nThere is also a question of what mental attitude the\nhermeneutic fictionalist about a discourse D should say that\nwe have toward utterances made within D. As the name\n\u201cfictionalism\u201d indicates, the attitude is often said to be\nthe attitude we have toward paradigmatic cases of fiction. (Our\nmotivation for adopting the attitude may be different in paradigmatic\ncases of fiction than in the case of one of the discourses under\nconsideration here. But that is different.) The attitude is also often\nsaid to be that of pretense or make-believe. Those\nwho compare D with make-believe normally rely on the account\nof make-believe of Walton (1990, 1993). Yablo\u2019s (e.g. 1998,\n2001, 2002) brand of hermeneutic fictionalism is one example. The\nYablo-Walton view is usefully divided into two parts. First, the\nstatements made within D are likened to metaphorical\nstatements. Second, a pretense account of metaphor is given.\nOn this type of view on metaphor, a metaphorical utterance is one that\nrepresents the world as it needs to be in order to make the utterance\npretense-worthy in a game of make-believe that it suggests. An example\nmay help. Just as \u201cBert is carrying a gun\u201d can be made\ntrue, in the pretense relevant to this utterance, by Bert\u2019s\nholding a twig, so, on this view on metaphor, can Romeo\u2019s\n\u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d be made true by features of Juliet and\nof the relation between Romeo and Juliet, given the pretense that\nRomeo\u2019s utterance makes relevant. For example, the utterance may\nbe made true by Juliet\u2019s bearing the right type of real-world\nrelation to Romeo\u2019s well-being. (See Wearing 2012 for criticism\nof this kind of view on metaphor.)\n\nClearly there are views between the extreme fictionalist view that\nD is best given a metaphor/pretense account and the extreme\nrealist view that ordinary assertions within D aim at literal\ntruth. (i) Van Fraassen (1980), discussing scientific discourse,\nemphasizes that our attitude toward our best theory of the world is,\nor should be, \u2018acceptance\u2019 rather than belief, where\nacceptance is an attitude that falls short of belief. (ii) Yablo\n(2006) has investigated the possibility that when engaging in\nmathematical discourse we presuppose that mathematical\nentities exist. (And while it is possible to assimilate presupposition\nto pretense such an assimilation is not part of Yablo\u2019s official\nstory.) Compare here also Hinckfuss (1993). (iii) A suggestion\ndeveloped in Eklund (2005) is that when it comes to a variety of\nsentences we use, we are often simply indifferent to some\nimplications of what they express: the fictionalist can appeal to this\nand say that we are indifferent to the real-world existential\nimplications of mathematical statements. (iv) Walton (1990) himself\ninsists that even if he is giving a pretense account, the claim is not\nthat speakers themselves actively engage in pretense. For a\npretense account to be correct of the utterances of some given\nspeaker, it is enough that the speaker participates in a pretense\ndiscourse. Compare here also Crimmins\u2019 (1998) remarks on\n\u201cshallow pretense\u201d. Crimmins emphasizes that, despite his\ntalk of pretense, \u201cwe are instituting a manner of speaking, not\npainting a fantasy world\u201d. Which of these theses to call\n\u201cfictionalist\u201d is a matter of terminological choice. But\narguably, all the theses on the list share the main attractions of\nparadigmatic versions of fictionalism.\n3. Arguments for Fictionalism\n\nGiven the variety of fictionalisms it is hard to provide a succinct\nsurvey of the arguments for and against fictionalism simpliciter. This\nsection is devoted to an overview of certain fictionalism-relevant\narguments, together with remarks on what forms of fictionalism these\narguments purport to justify. The overview focuses primarily on\narguments that are of relevance for fictionalism as a general\nphilosophical strategy, rather than arguments that only are relevant\nto fictionalism about a specific subject matter.\n3.1 Via eliminativist antirealism\n\nOne historically important argument for fictionalism goes as follows.\nSuppose that we have an independent argument for what one may call\neliminativist antirealism about a particular discourse\n(whether it be mathematical discourse, or moral discourse,\nor\u2009\u2026\u2009.): an argument to the effect that the\natomic sentences of the discourse are all untrue, either because the\ncharacteristic objects of the discourse do not exist \u2014 there are\nno numbers \u2014 or because its characteristic predicates are\nuninstantiated \u2014 nothing is right, good, etc. This eliminativist\nantirealism threatens to convict ordinary speakers of massive,\nwidespread error. This is often regarded as a serious problem. It is\nhere that fictionalism comes to the rescue: if we suppose that the\nutterances in question are made in a fictional spirit, then\neliminativist antirealism about (say) mathematics does not commit\nordinary speakers of massive error.\n\nAs set out, this is an argument for hermeneutic fictionalism.\nRevolutionary fictionalism, aiming to secure a purpose that\nmathematical discourse can serve even if mathematical entities do not\nexist, would not avert the threat that the eliminativist antirealist\nwould have to say of ordinary speakers that they are in massive error.\nBut there is a nearby argument for revolutionary fictionalism. It goes\nlike this: Eliminativist antirealism threatens to come at a serious\ncost. If by the lights of our philosophy of mathematics there are no\nmathematical entities, it seems mathematical discourse must be\nabandoned (because mathematical utterances are systematically untrue):\nsuch discourse cannot be worthwhile. It is here that revolutionary\nfictionalism comes to the rescue: so long as there is some worthwhile\naim of mathematical discourse despite the nonexistence of mathematical\nentities, mathematical discourse need not be abandoned.\n\nConsider too some specific motivations for revolutionary fictionalism.\nFirst, Joyce (2005) on moral fictionalism. Joyce starts out from the\nassumption that, when taken literally, moral sentences are\nsystematically untrue, and seeks to show that it can still be\npractically useful to pretend that it is not so. Joyce asks first what\nthe benefits are of believing that some acts are morally right and\nothers morally wrong, and thinks that even when such a belief is\nfalse, it can be valuable: \u201cThe distinctive value of categorical\nimperatives is that they silence calculations. In this manner, moral\nbeliefs function to bolster self-control against practical\nirrationality\u201d (301). The basic idea is that for prudential\nreasons, essentially reasons such as those suggested by Hobbes and\nHume, one ought generally to act in accordance with alleged moral\nrequirements (\u201cthe fear of punishment, the desire for an ongoing\nbeneficial relationship, the motivation to maintain a good reputation,\nthe simple fact that one on the whole likes one\u2019s\nfellows,\u2026\u201d). But were it not for the moral beliefs one\nmight still be tempted by the short term gains from acting immorally.\nTurning to moral fictionalism, Joyce thinks that the make-believe that\nmoral properties are instantiated can have the same benefits as the\ngenuine belief that they are. In general, fictions can produce real\nemotions, which have motivational effects. Joyce remarks, \u201cHuman\nmotivation is often aroused more effectively by mental images than by\nmental calculation\u201d. Second, consider Field\u2019s (1980, 1989)\nrevolutionary fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics. On\nField\u2019s view the function of mathematics is to facilitate\ninferences from certain empirical, and nominalistically acceptable,\nstatements to others. A mathematical theory can perform this function\nso long as it is conservative, where a mathematical theory T\nis conservative if, roughly, for every nominalistic theory N,\nT+N has no consequences for the ontology of\nN that are not consequences of N alone. The\nimportant point is that a mathematical theory need not be true in\norder to be useful in this way. In both these cases, the supposed\nlesson from the considerations adduced is that pretense would serve us\nas well as real belief or real assertion.\n\nThis first argument for fictionalism is only an indirect argument for\nthe view. It says only that if we have reason to embrace eliminativist\nantirealism about some discourse, then fictionalism about D\nshould also be attractive. The argument does not even purport to\naddress the intrinsic merits of fictionalism. \n3.2 The Oracle\n\nSuppose a being you take to be an omniscient Oracle told you there are\nnot in fact any abstract entities; you come to believe this claim.\nWould you not go on talking as before? Wouldn\u2019t you continue to\nsay things like \u201cYou can\u2019t tile that rectangular floor\nwith 17 tiles, for 17 is a prime number\u201d and other seemingly\ncommitting sentences? And would anything really, so to speak, be or\nfeel different about your use of these sentences?\n\nIf the verdict is that we really would continue using these sentences\nas before and nothing would seem different about our use of them, then\nwe have here an argument for hermeneutic fictionalism. Surely after\nthe Oracle\u2019s pronouncement we no longer commit ourselves to the\nexistence of abstract entities. But if we are just going on as before,\nwe were not thus committing ourselves earlier either.\n\nThe Oracle argument has primarily been used in discussions of abstract\nobjects. But the strategy is clearly in principle generalizable. Take\nfor instance the moral case. Suppose an Oracle were to tell you that\nreally there are no moral facts. It can be argued that this would not\ncause you to change your practice of making moral assertions. The case\ncan be argued to be analogous with the mathematics case.\n\nSome brief remarks on the Oracle argument are in order. First, the\nOracle argument presumes that the ontological commitments of a\nspeaker\u2019s assertions are transparent to the speaker. It can\nlegitimately be denied that speakers have the relevant sort of access\nto their commitments. Second, the Oracle argument implicitly\nhighlights an important distinction. Fictionalism is often motivated\nby concerns about what we are and are not ontologically committed to.\nBut what should we focus on when gauging our ontological commitments\n\u2014 the beliefs that we have, or what commitments we take\non in our utterances? As presented, the Oracle argument in\nthe first instance speaks to what commitments we take on in our\nutterances: it does not speak directly to the question of what the\nontological commitments of our beliefs are. Third, as stated, the\nargument is obviously an argument for hermeneutic, not\nrevolutionary, fictionalism. An Oracle argument for revolutionary\nfictionalism would rather emphasize that the Oracle\u2019s statement\nwould give us no reason to abandon the discourse.\n\n(The Oracle argument is from Yablo 2000a. The thought experiment itself\nis originally from Burgess and Rosen 1997.) \n3.3 The paradox of existence\n\nHere is a kind of puzzle or paradox that several philosophers have\nstressed. On the one hand, existence questions seem hard. The\nphilosophical question of whether there are abstract entities does not\nseem to admit of an easy or trivial answer. At the same time, there\nseem to be trivial arguments settling questions like this in the\naffirmative. Consider for instance the arguments, \u201c2+2=4. So\nthere is a number which, when added to 2, yields 4. This something is\na number. So there are numbers\u201d, and \u201cFido is a dog. So\nFido has the property of being a dog. So there are properties.\u201d\nHow should one resolve this paradox? One response is: adopt\nfictionalism. The idea would be that in the philosophy room we do not\nspeak fictionally, but ordinarily we do. So in the philosophy room,\nthe question of the existence of abstract entities is hard; outside\nit, the question is easy. When, ordinarily, a speaker utters a\nsentence that semantically expresses a proposition that entails that\nthere are numbers, what she says is accurate so long as according to\nthe relevant fiction, there are numbers. But when she utters the same\nsentence in the philosophy room, she speaks literally and then what\nshe asserts is something highly non-trivial. The fictionalism that\nwould seem to be motivated by this reasoning is use fictionalism.\n\n(See, e.g., Yablo 2000a, Szab\u00f3 2001, Hofweber 2000, and\nThomasson 2013 for discussion of this type of argument. However, of\nthese authors, only Yablo uses the paradox of existence to motivate\nfictionalism. Szab\u00f3, Hofweber and Thomasson all offer other\ndiagnoses.) \n3.4 Analogies with uncontroversially non-literal discourse\n\nOne way to argue for fictionalism about a region of discourse is to\nshow that our use of declarative sentences within the discourse\nresembles our use of non-literal language in other areas. There are\nthree considerations that can be brought up under this heading.\n\n(1) Unobtrusive metaphors \u2014 metaphors that easily go unnoticed\n\u2014 are quite common. So we should not be surprised if some\nphilosophically interesting discourse should turn out to be permeated\nby such metaphors. Consider the following list from Yablo (2000a):\n\nThey put a lot of hurdles in your path, there\u2019s a lot that could\nbe said about that, there\u2019s no precedent for that, something\ntells me you\u2019re right, there are some things better left unsaid,\nthere is something I forgot to tell you, viz. how to operate the lock,\nnothing gets my goat as much as chewing gum in class, a lot you can do\nfor me, let\u2019s roll out the red carpet, the last thing I want is\nto\u2026, their people have risen in my esteem, I took her into my\nconfidence, my patience is nearly exhausted, I\u2019ll take my\nchances, there\u2019s a trace of sadness in your eyes, a growing\nnumber of these leaks can be traced to Starr\u2019s office,\nshe\u2019s got a lot of smarts, let\u2019s pull out all the stops,\nlet\u2019s proceed along the lines suggested above.\n\n\nThe idea is that there are many unobtrusive metaphors; and that if\nmetaphors can often be this unobtrusive, then maybe the\nnon-literalness of our actual utterances of sentences of D is\nalso unobtrusive. Of course, what Yablo says here is controversial.\nOne can insist that some of Yablo\u2019s examples are not metaphors\nbut idioms. And one can insist that for some of the examples, the only\nreason to regard them as non-literal would stem from a prior\nconviction that their literal truth would require metaphysical\nabsurdities. But so long as there are a fair number of unobtrusive\nmetaphors, Yablo has a point.\n\n(2) Relatedly, one way that fictionalists try to argue for their\ndoctrines is by appeal to cases where, supposedly, fictionalist theses\nare obviously true. Consider first motion discourse. Some\nfictionalists hold that we happily say things like \u201cthe sun\nrises\u201d despite knowing fully well that this sentence is not\nliterally true in the relevant contexts of utterance. The idea is that\nfor the literal truth of these sentences a Ptolemaic, absolutist\nworldview would have to be correct. But obviously, even though we use\nthese sentences to make assertions, we do not believe this sort of\nworldview to be true. We engage instead in a Ptolemaic and absolutist\nfiction. Next consider expressions of the form \u2018the average\nF\u2019. We routinely utter declarative sentences containing\nsuch expressions in subject position; it seems that for such a\nsentence to be literally true there would really have to be an average\nF. This seems absurd. It seems odd that we should cheerfully\ncommit ourselves to such an absurdity. Hence, it is sometimes\nsuggested, hermeneutic fictionalism is true of the use of these\nexpressions. \n\n(3) Both in his (2000a) and elsewhere, Yablo draws up a list of\nanalogies between on the one hand uncontroversially non-literal\ndiscourse and on the other hand discourse about \u201cplatonic\nobjects\u201d \u2014 for present purposes one can think of these\nsimply as would-be objects ripe for fictionalist\n treatment[2]\n \u2014. I will not here reproduce the whole list. But here are some\nrepresentative suggested analogies: \n\n\n\nParaphrasability: [Creatures of metaphorical make-believe] are often\nparaphrasable away with no felt loss of subject matter. \u2018That\nwas her first encounter with the green-eyed monster\u2019 goes to\n\u2018that was her first time feeling jealous\u2019. \u2018That\nreally gets my goat\u2019 goes to \u2018that really irritates\nme\u2019.\n\n[Platonic objects] are often paraphrasable away with no felt loss of\nsubject matter. \u2018There is a possible world with furry\ndonkeys\u2019 goes to \u2018furry donkeys are possible\u2019.\n\u2018She did it one way or another\u2019 goes to \u2018she did it\nsomehow\u2019. Etc.\n\n\nSilliness: [Creatures of metaphorical make-believe] invite\n\u2018silly questions\u2019 probing areas the make-believe does not\naddress, e.g. we know how big the average star is, but where is it\nlocated? You say you lost your nerve, has it been turned in? Do you\nplan to drop-forge the uncreated conscience of your race in\nthe smithy of your soul?\n\n[Platonic objects] invite questions which are similarly silly. What\nare the intrinsic properties of the empty set? Is the event of the\nwater\u2019s boiling itself hot? Are universals wholly present in\neach of their instances? Do relations lead a divided existence,\nparcelled out among their relata? \n\n\nIt is obviously debatable exactly how telling these analogies are. One\nmay for example reasonably suspect that the claim that the supposedly\nsilly questions about platonic objects really all are silly will have\nappeal only for philosophers of a certain bent of mind.\n4. Arguments against Fictionalism\n\nTurn now to arguments against fictionalism. As with the arguments for\nfictionalism, the focus will be on arguments that are relevant to\nfictionalism as a general metaphysical strategy, rather than arguments\nthat only are relevant to fictionalism about a given subject\n matter.[3]\n Many of the arguments are directed primarily against fictionalism of\nthe hermeneutic variety.\n4.1 The phenomenological objection\n\nThe most obvious objection to fictionalism is that it seems just\nabsurd to assimilate some seemingly sober discourse such as\nmathematical or modal or moral discourse to make-believe and fiction.\n(\u201cMathematical discourse just doesn\u2019t seem at all\nlike Cowboys and Indians.\u201d) This is an objection specifically\ntargeted against hermeneutic fictionalism; it is plainly irrelevant as\ndirected against a revolutionary fictionalist.\n\nWe have already seen some fictionalist replies to this objection. One\nreply (section 3.4) is that, philosophically interesting discourses\naside, we engage in make-believe and fiction more often than we\nordinarily tend to think. Another reply \u2014 related to the\ndistinctions drawn in section 2.4 \u2014 is that there are variants\nof fictionalism that do not claim there to be a close analogy between\nthe target discourse on the one hand and fiction and make-believe on\nthe other. For discussion of the phenomenological objection, see,\ne.g., Brock (2014).\n\nThere have been attempts to make what is essentially the\nphenomenological objection more precise. Jason Stanley (2001) has two\nrelated objections concerning the nature of the fictionalist\u2019s\nappeal to pretense. (i) The hermeneutic fictionalist says that we are\nengaged in make-believe where it doesn\u2019t seem to us that we are.\nHence, Stanley says, \u201cIf the hermeneutic fictionalist is\ncorrect, then x can bear the propositional attitude of\npretense toward a proposition, without it being in principle\naccessible to x that x bears the propositional\nattitude of pretense towards that proposition. But this introduces a\nnovel and quite drastic form of failure of first-person authority over\none\u2019s own mental states\u201d. (ii) By what the fictionalist\nsays, the same psychological mechanisms as are involved in\nmake-believe are involved in understanding the use of a discourse of\nwhich fictionalism is true. But it seems this can be shown to be\nproblematic on empirical grounds. Autistic persons have difficulties\nwith make-believe, so by the fictionalist\u2019s hypothesis they\nshould likewise have difficulties understanding the use of a discourse\nof which fictionalism is true. But autistic persons do not have\ndifficulties with mathematical discourse, or modal discourse, or\ndiscourse concerning negative existentials, etc. (For discussion of\nStanley\u2019s autism objection, see Liggins 2010.)\n\nA related but distinct concern is that the fictionalist draws a\ndistinction without a difference: there is no real difference between\nbelief and the supposedly distinct attitude that the fictionalist\nposits. (For discussion, see Daly (2008), Horwich (1991),\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1994), Rosen (forthcoming), Rosen and Burgess\n(2005), and Thomasson (2013.) As just stated, the objection may sound\nlike an obvious non-starter: of course there is a difference between\nbelief and whatever attitude it is that we take toward fiction. But\nthere are some reasons to still take the objection seriously. First,\nas discussed above, fictionalists do often appeal to a different\nattitude from the one we adopt toward paradigmatic cases of fiction,\nand for that reason alone one cannot move straight from the obvious\npossibility of engaging in fiction to the possibility of us doing what\nthe philosophical fictionalist says we do, or should do. Second,\ncharacteristic of fiction is that we often do abandon the perspective\ninternal to the fiction and instead adopt an external, critical\nperspective. Nothing similar seems to standardly be going on with,\nsay, mathematical discourse or moral discourse. However, these points\nnoted, it is still natural for the fictionalist to shrug off this\nconcern, saying with Rosen (forthcoming) that the question of whether\nsomeone who is generally disposed to behave as if p really believes\nthat p can be settled by what the person is disposed to say upon\nreflection regarding whether she believes that p or not.\n4.2 Can fictionalism deliver the goods?\n\nEven though there are many different arguments for and motivations\nbehind fictionalism, one main motivation is clearly the ontological\none. Fictionalism about a discourse D is often seen as\nattractive precisely because it promises to get around otherwise\npotentially serious philosophical problems regarding\nD\u2019s ontology. But one worry is that fictionalism can\nfail to make good on this promise. Here are some examples of how this\ncan happen.\n\nFirst, according to fictionalism about a given discourse, the\ndiscourse is in important respects analogous to paradigmatic cases of\nfiction. This is supposed to have ontological advantages.\nSpecifically, the entities characteristic of the relevant discourse\nare sometimes supposed then to have the same ontological status as\nfictional entities. But if fictional entities are problematic in their\nown right, then not much is gained by this move. Fictionalism about\nfictional characters \u2014 see, e.g., Brock (2002), and Everett\n(2005), and ch. 10 of Walton (1990) \u2014 is one attempt to get\naround this problem. A different response to the objection is that it\ntakes too seriously the label \u201cfictionalism\u201d. Some\nprominent types of fictionalism claim only that in ordinary utterances\nof sentences of some discourse, speakers don\u2019t aim at literal\ntruth. That claim by no means amounts to saying that the putative\nentities of the discourse have the same ontological status as\nfictional entities, whatever exactly that is.\n\nSecond, consider Peter van Inwagen\u2019s (1990) fictionalism about\nordinary objects. Van Inwagen suggests that when we say, e.g.,\n\u201cThere is a table here\u201d, what we really assert is\nsomething like: there are simples arranged tablewise here.\nSider (1993) notes a problem: van Inwagen\u2019s paraphrase strategy\npresupposes that there are simples and not gunk (in other words, it\npresupposes that all objects decompose into minimal parts,\n\u2018simples\u2019) and there is no straightforward way of\nreformulating it so as to take into account the possibility of gunk.\nIf indeed it seems at all wrong that in our everyday discourse we\nshould manifest a preference for the hypothesis that there are\nmacrophysical objects over agnosticism about the matter, it should\nanyway seem more wrong still that in our ordinary practices we should\nmanifest a preference for the hypothesis that there are simples rather\nthan gunk. Sider\u2019s point concerns only van Inwagen\u2019s\nspecific strategy. But there is a general lesson nearby: the adequacy\nof the paraphrases might itself depend on substantive metaphysical\nassumptions.\n4.3 Criticisms concerning systematicity\n\nOne main worry that Stanley (2001) presses with respect to hermeneutic\nfictionalism concerns systematicity. Take the case of mathematics.\nInfinitely many sentences belong to mathematical discourse, and to be\ncompetent with mathematical discourse involves having the competence\nto grasp these infinitely many sentences. Standard considerations\nconcerning the finitude of our minds require that our grasp of these\ninfinitely many sentences is something we have by virtue of our grasp\nof some finite set of principles: a compositional semantic theory is\nrequired. But it is, the worry goes, unclear what a compositional\nfictionalist semantic theory might conceivably look like.\n\nYablo\u2019s (2001) response to the systematicity objection is to\nsay, \u201cThere are kinds of speech that finite beings clearly do\nunderstand, yet whose semantics does not seem to be compositional. One\ndoes not expect a compositional semantics for hyperbole, metonymy, or\nirony: one does not expect a compositional semantics for speech\ngoverned by shifting presuppositions. Somehow, though, we understand.\nThis suggests that [hermeneutic fictionalist] analyses directed at\nkinds of speech that resemble hyperbole, metonymy, or etc. should not\nbe held to the standard of strong-systematicity-or-bust\u201d. There\nis something odd about this response. The reason why we do not expect\na compositional semantics for hyberbole is that we do not really\nexpect a semantics for hyperbole at all. We do not think that\nthere are certain sentences that have hyperbolic meanings\n\u2014 whatever that would amount to \u2014 but rather that\nsometimes some sentences are used hyperbolically. Even so,\nthere is something telling about what Yablo says. The analogy with\nhyperbole and irony shows Yablo to be a use fictionalist: his\nhypothesis is not one about the types of meanings mathematical\nsentences have but about what we ordinarily do with mathematical\nsentences. From this perspective, the demand for a compositional\nfictionalist semantics for mathematical sentences is misplaced for the\nreason that the fictionalist does not propose a different semantics\nfor mathematical sentences at all.\n\nStanley discusses, and rejects, a response to his argument much like\nthe one here brought up. He considers the question of whether the\nfictionalist about D should be taken as making a claim about\nwhat proposition really is expressed in an ordinary utterance of a\ndeclarative sentence of D, or rather just a claim about what\nis pragmatically communicated. Apparently allowing that the\nfictionalist gets off the hook in the latter case, Stanley marshals a\nnumber of arguments in favor of the former alternative. However, the\ndistinction Stanley draws is clearly different from the distinction\nbetween meaning fictionalism and use fictionalism. One can be a use\nfictionalist while holding that one\u2019s view is about what\nproposition is expressed in an ordinary utterance of a relevant\nsentence. It is not clear why a fictionalist hypothesis about which\nproposition is expressed in an utterance should incur an obligation to\nhold that there is a compositional fictionalist semantics.\n\nThese remarks are not meant to indicate that the mathematical\nfictionalist does not owe us a systematic account of what is\ncommunicated by mathematical sentences. The point is just that what is\nowed is not a compositional semantics. Yablo\u2019s analogy,\nhyperbole, can be used to make the point, despite the obvious\ndifferences between this case and the mathematics case. All that is\nneeded properly to understand hyperbole is an ordinary compositional\nsemantics giving the literal meanings of the sentences involved plus a\ngeneral principle relating the propositions semantically expressed by\nthe sentences to the inflated propositions the sentences express when\nused hyperbolically. Similarly, given use fictionalism all that is\nneeded properly to understand what is communicated in ordinary\nutterances of mathematical sentences is an ordinary compositional\nsemantics, together with principles linking the literal contents of\nmathematical sentences to what the fictionalist says the utterances\nordinarily convey. \n4.4 The fictionalist\u2019s preferred analogies\n\nAs noted above, one way that fictionalists try to argue for their\ndoctrines is by appeal to cases where, supposedly, fictionalist theses\nare obviously true. Two such cases are motion discourse, and talk\nabout \u2018the average F\u2019. However, in both of these\ncases, it can plausibly be argued that proper attention to the\nsemantics undercuts the fictionalist\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, critics such as Stanley (2001) stress that while terms of the\nform \u2018the average F\u2019 superficially seem like\nsingular terms, they do not behave semantically like ordinary singular\nterms. But if they do not behave semantically like ordinary singular\nterms there is no call for a fictionalist account explaining why we do\nnot commit ourselves to there being entities such as the average F\nwhen assertively uttering sentences of the form \u201cthe average\nF is G\u201d (see also Kennedy and Stanley 2009).\n\nTurn next to motion discourse. Brendan Jackson (2007) argues that any\ntemptation to be a fictionalist about motion discourse stems from an\noversimplified conception of the semantics of the relevant sentences.\nCompare\n\n\n(1) Europe is small.\n\n(2) That cell phone is a bit heavy.\n\n(3) The remote is to the left of the television.\n\n(4) A lion is hiding behind the bush.\n\n\nJackson notes two things. First, these cases are \u201canalogous to\nwhat is going on when we utter typical motion ascriptions. We can\ndescribe all these utterances as incomplete, in the sense\nthat there is some parameter \u2014 a comparison class, a purpose, a\nperspective or a frame of reference \u2014 that must be taken into\naccount if the utterance is to be regarded as expressing a possibly\ntrue proposition, and yet the utterance contains no explicit word or\nphrase that specifies a value for this parameter\u201d. And second,\nsemanticists typically agree on what is going on in (1)\u2013(4): the\nsentences are simply context-sensitive. There is no need for\na fictionalist proposal to explain why in typical utterances of them\nwe express something true. According to Jackson, the same story can be\ntold in the case of motion ascriptions.\n\nThe points concerning motion discourse and \u2018the average\nF\u2019 in the first instance cast doubt only on some\nspecific examples that fictionalists tend to use to motivate their\nfictionalist theses. But they also suggest a more general lesson:\nfictionalist theses can often be undercut by closer attention to the\nsemantics of the discourse in question. \n4.5 Philosophy of language concerns\n\nThe hermeneutic fictionalist about a discourse D typically\nclaims that there is a radical mismatch between on the one hand what\nwe may call the assertoric contents of utterances of\nsentences of D (what is expressed in ordinary utterances of\nthese sentences) and on the other hand the semantic contents\nof these sentences (what these sentences semantically express, in the\ncontexts of utterance). But when it is stated thus baldly what the\nstrategy is, two related worries should immediately arise, having to\ndo with foundational issues in the philosophy of language.\n\nFirst, even setting radical use theories to the side, many\nphilosophers have supposed that the semantic content of a sentence is\nsomehow determined, at least largely, by what the sentence is\ncustomarily used to express. This would seem to entail that there must\nbe a close connection between the semantic content of a sentence and\nhow the sentence is customarily used. But then it is odd if there is\nthe kind of systematic mismatch between assertoric content and\nsemantic content that the fictionalist claims that there is; or that\nis the worry.\n\nSecond, putting matters in this more technical way highlights another\npotential difficulty. There are deep and unresolved issues in\nphilosophy of language concerning the nature of assertoric and\nsemantic content, respectively, and concerning the relation between\nthem. While these issues remain unresolved, it may be premature to put\nforward strong claims about the relation of the assertoric and\nsemantic contents. Generally, and relating back to the points made in\nthe previous subsection, it can be suspected that fictionalists tend\nto have a too simple view of semantic content.\n\nOne fictionalist reply to these concerns is to say that it is only for\nargument\u2019s sake that she adopts a conservative view of the\nsemantic contents of the sentences of the discourse in question. She\ncan say that her basic point is that the discourses are not in fact\nontologically committing. If the sentences are not ontologically\ncommitting even when they are used literally, that is fine. What she\nis arguing is that even if the sentences are ontologically\ncommitting as used literally, there is reason to think that the\ndiscourse is not ontologically committing. Perhaps, in light of the\npoint about how use determines meaning, the fact that our use of the\nsentences is not ontologically committing should cast doubt on any\nsemantics of these sentences given which they are. But that does not\naffect the more general philosophical point the fictionalist is\ntypically concerned to make: that the discourse is not ontologically\ncommitting.\n4.6 Old problems in new bottles?\n\nOne kind of worry one might have about fictionalism is that it does\nnot really, by itself, help avoid the problems that beset similar\napproaches. Here are two examples.\n\n(1) Paraphrase. Since long before fictionalism really came into vogue,\nphilosophers have liked to appeal to paraphrase: it has often been\nclaimed that sentences which seem to express such-and-such\npropositions, really only express such-and-such other propositions.\n(E.g., it sounds as if you are genuinely talking about material\nobjects, but really you are only claiming something about actual and\npossible sense-data.) Often such appeals to paraphrase have foundered\nupon the details: telling objections have shown how the paraphrases\nfail to deal with all the sentences within the purview of the\nproposal. Objections to some fictionalist theories that have been\nproposed take a similar form, since some fictionalists in effect offer\nparaphrases. Take for instance van Inwagen\u2019s (1985) objection to\nfictionalism about fictional characters, as espoused for instance by\nKendall Walton (1985, 1990, 2000). Consider van Inwagen\u2019s pair\nof sentences,\n\n\n(S1) There is a fictional character who, for every novel, either\nappears in that novel or is a model for a character who does.\n\n\nand\n\n\n(S2) If no character appears in every novel, then some character is\nmodeled on another character.\n\n\nSentence (S1) seems to entail sentence (S2), but, the charge is, the\nparaphrases offered by Walton do not respect this. The paraphrases\nthat Walton offers are of the form \u201cTo engage in pretense of\nkind K is fictionally to speak truly in a game of such-and-such a\nsort\u201d: but then the paraphrase of (S2) is not entailed by the\nparaphrase of (S1). There is naturally much that can be said about the\nobjection. (The reply Walton (2000) himself gives is that the claim\nthat (S1) entails (S2) is itself pretend-true.) Essentially the same\nsort of objection is pressed by Richard (2000), Stanley (2001) and\nKroon (2004) against Mark Crimmins\u2019 (1998) fictionalism about\npropositional attitude talk and discourse involving empty names.\n\n(2) In his (2005a) defense of a version of moral fictionalism, Mark\nKalderon argues that would-be non-cognitivists who seek to avoid the\nFrege-Geach problem (for a presentation of this problem see the\nEmbedding Problem section of the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism)\n should adopt a version of moral fictionalism. The resulting theory\nwould be one according to which moral sentences have ordinary\nrepresentational contents, but acceptance of moral sentences does not\namount to belief in the literal truth of these contents but rather\nonly to holding a non-cognitive attitude toward them. The reason why\nthis is supposed to get around the Frege-Geach problem would be that\narguments like\n\n\n(P1) Stealing is wrong.\n\n(P2) If stealing is wrong, then getting one\u2019s little brother to\nsteal is wrong.\n\n(C) So, getting one\u2019s little brother to steal is wrong.\n\n\nturn out on this revised non-cognitivist view to be straightforwardly\nvalid: for the proposition semantically expressed by the conclusion\nsentence is entailed by the propositions semantically expressed by the\npremise sentences.\n\nHowever, one may reasonably worry that the envisaged fictionalist move\ndoesn\u2019t in fact help at all with the Frege-Geach problem. For\nsomeone actually presenting an argument like this would be\npresenting a good argument. But for this to be so, what the arguer\nactually expresses by the premise sentence must provide good reason to\naccept what she actually expresses by the conclusion sentence. Since\nwhat the arguer actually expresses is, on the fictionalist view,\ndifferent from what the sentences she utters semantically express, it\nis not sufficient for the fictionalist to point to how the sentences\n(P1) and (P2), when taken literally, express propositions that entail\nthe proposition expressed by the sentence (C) taken literally.\nKalderon\u2019s moral fictionalist faces the problem of giving an\naccount that respects the fact that the argument actually put forward\nis valid. But this seems not to be essentially different from the\ntraditional non-cognitivist\u2019s problem of saying what the\nmeanings of the relevant sentences are such that the impression that\nthe argument is valid can be respected. (This objection to Kalderon\nwas stated, more briefly, in the original 2007 version of this entry,\nand was also presented, independently, in Lenman 2008. Kalderon\nreplied to it in his 2008a and 2008b, and Eklund 2009 is in turn a\nreply to Kalderon. See also ch. 6 of Miller 2013)\n4.7 The Brock-Rosen objection\n\nHere is a simple way to lay out what is known as the Brock-Rosen\nobjection to modal fictionalism. (Taken from Divers and Hagen\u2019s\n(2006) presentation.) Consider the proposition\n\n(P) There is a plurality of worlds,\n\n\nwhere by \u2018worlds\u2019 we mean Lewisian possible worlds. The\nmodal fictionalist doesn\u2019t want to commit herself to the literal\ntruth of P. But the objection is that she ends up doing so\nanyway. For\n\n(1) According to the modal fiction, at every world, P.\n\n\nNow, the modal fictionalist holds, the objection goes, that for every\nmodal sentence \u2018A\u2019,\n\n(M) \u2018A\u2019 is true iff according to the\nmodal fiction, A*,\n\n\nwhere \u2018A*\u2019 is the translation of\n\u2018A\u2019 into possible worlds talk.\n\nAn instance of (M) is then\n\n(2) \u2018Necessarily P\u2019 is true iff according to the\nmodal fiction, at every world, P.\n\n\nBy (1) and (2) together with disquotational principles concerning\ntruth,\n\n(3) Necessarily P.\n\n\nAnd hence,\n\n(4) P.\n\n\nAlthough the Brock-Rosen objection was first raised against modal\nfictionalism and has been most discussed in that context, it is\nimportant to note that the objection generalizes. For instance, one\ncan run a similar argument in the case of numbers. (This was first\nstressed in Nolan and O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996.) Here is how the\nobjection goes in that case. \n\nAccording to mathematical fictionalism,\n\n(#) For any sort of entity F, There are n\nFs iff according to the numbers fiction, The number of Fs\n= n.\n\n\nBut now apply this to numbers. An immediate consequence is that the\nfictionalist must conclude that (strictly and literally) there are\nnumbers. \n\nOne diagnosis \u2014 and purported resolution \u2014 of this problem\nrelates to the distinctions earlier drawn. According to this\ndiagnosis, what the objection at most shows is that the fictionalist\nshould be a use fictionalist. If any kind of fictionalist has to rely\non general translation schemes such as (M) or (#) it is the\nmeaning fictionalist. The use fictionalist can, with no real loss,\nemploy them more selectively: it is only when speaking within the\nfiction that we rely on them. (For this diagnosis, presented in\ndifferent terms, see Nolan and O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996, Yablo\n2001, and Woodward 2007. For more on the Brock-Rosen objection to\nmodal fictionalism, see the entry on\n modal fictionalism.)\n5. Significance\n\nLet us lastly turn to the broader picture: the general philosophical\nsignificance of fictionalism.\n\nObviously, and as earlier remarked, the hermeneutic fictionalist can\ncome to the eliminativist antirealist\u2019s aid: adopting\nfictionalism is for the eliminativist antirealist a more attractive\nalternative than to adopt some form of error\n theory.[4]\n\n\nQuite apart from positive motivations for antirealism, fictionalism is\nalso of relevance for evaluating particular arguments for realism. Let\nme discuss two. (a) What we may call ordinary language\narguments. An ordinary language argument for the existence of\nFs goes as follows. \u201c(1) Sentences thus-and-such are\ntrue. (2) (Semantic analysis shows that) for those sentences to be\ntrue, there must be Fs. (3) So, there must be\nFs.\u201d An argument of this form is clearly valid. The\nquestion of the soundness of an argument of this kind comes down to\nwhether the premises are true. Hermeneutic fictionalism presents\nproblems for the justification of premise (1). Maybe all that is\nevident from ordinary discourse is that we somehow convey or\ncommunicate true propositions when uttering the relevant sentences.\nBut hermeneutic fictionalism indicates how we can do so without the\nsentences semantically expressing true propositions. Thomasson (2013)\nis a recent extended discussion of the relation between fictionalism\nand her own preferred ontological view, which is argued for by what\nshe calls \u201ceasy arguments\u201d, a kind of ordinary language\narguments. Thomasson\u2019s ontological deflationism says,\nroughly, that all manners of philosophically controversial entities\nexist, and do so in some sense trivially. The way Thomasson presents\nthings, fictionalism and ontological deflationism are in conflict. But\nif fictionalism is only a linguistic thesis (compare the distinction\nbetween the ontological thesis and the linguistic thesis) \u2014 and\nthat is how Thomasson appears to understand it \u2014 that\u2019s\nnot quite true. What is true is that fictionalism presents problems\nfor Thomasson\u2019s specific way of arguing for ontological\ndeflationism, by appeal to ordinary language arguments. (b)\nIndispensability. Let us again take mathematics as our example. One of\nthe most influential arguments for platonism in the philosophy of\nmathematics is the indispensability argument, according to which\nquantification over mathematical entities is indispensable to our best\ntheory of the world, and hence we should take mathematical entities to\nexist. (This is a very rough characterization of indispensability\narguments. For more detail see the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n But revolutionary fictionalism suggests a complication: even if, in\nsome sense, quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable\nto our best theory of the world, perhaps it is not literal\nquantification over mathematical entities that is thus indispensable.\nThe relation between hermeneutic fictionalism and indispensability\narguments is a bit more indirect. But hermeneutic fictionalism is\nrelevant to indispensability arguments insofar as it is analyses of\nwhat scientists of various stripes actually say and believe that tell\nus what is \u201cour best theory of the world\u201d. \n\nThe arguments for realism just mentioned are arguments that typically\nwould be presented by those who take a \u2018Quinean\u2019 approach\nto ontology. Given this approach \u2014 the approach of many of those\ntheorists today who take ontology seriously \u2014 we should believe\nin those entities that our best theory of the world quantifies over.\nAlthough fictionalism presents problems for specific Quinean\narguments, like the indispensability argument, fictionalists are\nnaturally taken to be methodological allies of orthodox Quineans. They\ncan agree with orthodox Quineans that we should believe in those\nentities that our best theory of the world quantifies over. It is only\nthat they would stress that we must understand this to mean\n\u201cliterally quantifies over\u201d, and that in some\ninteresting cases the condition of literalness is not satisfied. \n\nMore radically, however, the theme of one of Yablo\u2019s earliest\npapers on fictionalism, Yablo (1998), is that the mere availability of\nfictionalism as a theoretical option presents problems for ontology as\na serious enterprise. Given that when the Quinean says that we should\nbelieve in what the best theory quantifies over, this must be\nunderstood to mean \u201cliterally quantifies over\u201d.\nBut then the Quinean program in ontology relies on the\nliteral/fictional distinction. But this distinction is problematic:\nsaying what parts of our speech are fictional and which are literal\nis, Yablo argues, at least as problematic as saying which sentences\nare synthetic and which are analytic. So there is at least as good\nreason to doubt the literal/fictional distinction \u2014 and hence\nthe Quinean program in ontology \u2014 as there is to doubt the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction. This is ad hominem, since Quine\nhimself famously attacked the analytic/synthetic distinction.\n\nThere are two metaontological points that someone might be inclined to\nmake here. A relatively moderate point is that it is often so hard to\nmake out on what side of the literal/fictional distinction some\ndiscourse falls that arguments of the Quinean kind seldom are well\nsupported. A different point is that there is sometimes \u2014 or, in\nthe most radical version of the idea, always \u2014 no fact of the\nmatter as to whether some piece of discourse is literal or fictional.\nIt is the most radical point here that is the most closely analogous\nto what Quine says about the analytic/synthetic distinction. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armour-Garb, B. and F.
