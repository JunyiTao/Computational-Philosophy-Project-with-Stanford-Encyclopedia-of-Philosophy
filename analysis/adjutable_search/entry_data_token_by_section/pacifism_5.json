    "main_text": "Defining Peace || Peace as a Virtue and Intrinsic Value\n1.5 Peace as a Virtue and Intrinsic Value\n\nBuilding upon these ideas, Michael Fox has described \u201cpeace as a\nway of life\u201d: \u201ca peaceful way of life will be such as to\nincorporate nonviolence toward oneself and others, and will be guided\nby cooperation, mutual respect, creative problem-solving, negotiation\nof differences, and caring concern or compassion\u201d (Fox 2014,\n202).This conception of peace is not mere quietism or passivity. Jay\nMcDaniel (2005) has argued in favor of a notion of \u201ccreative\npeace\u201d in which there is tension and activity as individuals and\ncultures must learn to listen to and interact with one another. This\nnotion of peace as a way of life can be understood in connection with\nvirtue ethics, where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is\nconnected to other virtues such as modesty, tolerance, and mercy\n(virtue ethics is discussed further below).\n\nAs we conclude this consideration of what peace means in pacifism, it\nis important to note that pacifists often view peace as an\nend-in-itself or as a having a kind of intrinsic value. This is\nexpressed in a variety of ways by pacifists. Pope Francis has said,\nfor example, \u201cPeace alone is holy. Peace alone is holy, not war\u201d\n(Francis 2017). This idea has roots in Augustine, who says in The\nCity of God that peace is the summum bonum(Augustine 1958,\nbook 19, chapter 11). This is connected to Augustine\u2019s idea that we\nshould only go to war if we are aiming at peace. Of course, that idea\nis central to the just war tradition that develops after Augustine.\nPacifists have responded by arguing that there ought to be a unity of\nmeans and ends and stipulating that only nonviolent means may be\nemployed in pursuit of peace. This notion of peace as the summum\nbonum has been developed in Islamic thought by Wahiduddin Khan\n(2015), who suggests that peace is like the soil that provides a\nfoundation for all other good things.\n\nThis conception of peace as having intrinsic value helps explain how\npacifists may respond to the question of what peace is good for. If\npeace is conceived as having intrinsic value, it is not good for\nanything else; it is simply good in itself. In understanding peace in\nthis way, pacifists may rely on a kind of intuitionism that holds that\npeace and its value are known through a kind of moral intuition. Fiala\nhas developed this account of pacifist metaethics (Fiala 2022b),\nbuilding on work in pacifist metaethics done by Holmes (Holmes 2017a\nand 2015). Those who hold that peace is an end-in-itself with\nintrinsic value may question the idea that peace should be understood\nin instrumental terms. For example, some will argue that peace is good\nbecause it produces prosperity (see Pinker 2011). But for pacifists\nwho hold that peace has intrinsic value, we should do not pursue peace\nbecause it leads to prosperity; rather, we ought to pursue peace for\nits own sake. \n\nPositive peace can be best understood from the tradition of virtue\nethics, where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is connected\nto other virtues such as modesty, tolerance, and mercy. It is\nimportant to note that peace is not mere quietism and the passivity of\nmeditation or contemplation. Jay McDaniel (2005) has argued in favor\nof a notion of \u201ccreative peace\u201d in which there is tension\nand activity as individuals and cultures must learn to listen to and\ninteract with one another.\n",
