    "main_text": "The Theory of Objects in the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles || General Features\n3.1 General Features\n\nThere are at least three interrelated features that broadly\ncharacterize the wide range of early phenomenological investigations\non ontology: metaphysical realism, ontological pluralism, and\nessentialism.\n\nMetaphysical realism. Early phenomenologists consider the\nworld to be made, in large part, of a variety of objects that are\nintentionality-independent. Accordingly, these objects exist\nindependently of a subject that might know them (regardless of how the\nnotion of the subject is conceived of). It is important to remark that\nthis position does not exclude the existence of objects, which are\nintentionality-dependent: artefacts and social objects like\ninstitutional facts (promissory commitments, institutions, etc.) exist\nprecisely because there are individuals or communities that\nintentionally create them. Interestingly, it is assumed that,\nregardless of its relation to intentionality, the existence of an\nobject always implies the possibility for this object to be known by a\ncognizer, which is why (at least in principle) all objects and their\nproperties are intelligible.\n\nOntological Pluralism. Objects belong to different\nfundamental categories. Because there are fundamentally different\nkinds of objects, their investigations are also assigned to different\ndisciplines. This is why psychologism has to be discarded: logical\npsychologism, e.g., collapses different categories (the psychological\nand the logical) into one, leading to the conclusion that there is one\nsingle discipline\u2014psychology\u2014in charge of their\ninvestigation. The flip side of ontological pluralism is\nanti-reductionism and a descriptive approach to ontological questions:\nall objects must be described as they are\u2014without failing to the\ntemptation of reducing one kind of objects to another (Geiger 1933).\nAgainst this backdrop, eidetic descriptions are occasionally\ncontrasted to definitions that characterize a concept in terms of\nother concepts: the idea is that definitions of this sort should be\navoided because they \u201cbetray\u201d the very essence of the\ndefiniendum (cf. Reinach 1914 [1989: 535], on the relations\nbetween explanation and description, see also Brunswig 1904\u00a0and\nMulligan 2012: \u00a71). This view has been criticized, even within\nphenomenology, for being conducive to a form of phenomenology\ncharacterized as \u201cpicture book phenomenology\u201d\n(Bilderbuchph\u00e4nomenologie, Scheler 1913/16: 11;\nH\u00e9ring 1939: 370 n 1).\n\nEssentialism. Phenomenological ontology is committed to a\nform of essentialism according to which objects are constituted by an\nessence. It should be noted that the word \u201cessence\u201d\n(Wesen) is ambiguous (Reinach 1912): on the one hand, it can\nrefer to the so-being of an individual object, i.e., to that which\nmakes an individual the individual it is. For instance, how finely a\ngiven quill pen writes is a property that qualifies this individual\npen as the pen it is\u2014for no other pen can write in the same fine\nway (H\u00e9ring 1921: 496f; H\u00e9ring reserves the term,\n\u201cessence\u201d (Wesen), for this concept; see also De\nSantis 2015, Fabbianelli 2016). On the other, it can also indicate the\nwhat-being of a given object or the kind to which it belongs: e.g.,\nbeing a pen is one such kind (H\u00e9ring uses the word\n\u201cessentiality\u201d (Wesenheit) to refer to essence in\nthis second sense, see 1921: 505ff and Seifert 1996). Essences (in\nthis second sense) ground necessity (H\u00e9ring 1921; Ingarden\n1925; Reinach 1911b). For instance, the essence of promise, color,\nmovement, or tone grounds the necessary facts that promises generate\nclaims and obligations, that colors have extension, that movements\nhave velocity, that tones have pitch and intensity, etc. (see also\nMulligan 2004; Fine 1994a,b, 1995). Essences are taken to exist\nindependently of whether they have exemplifications or not. As such,\nthey are described as ideal (abstract) and atemporal objects. Not all\nessences are atemporal, though: for instance, Geiger discusses the\nidea of \u201cdynamic essences\u201d (Geiger 1924, e.g., the essence\nof the tragic), which evolve through time and are characteristically\ninstantiated in artworks.\n",
