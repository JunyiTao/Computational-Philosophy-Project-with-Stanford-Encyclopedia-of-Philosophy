New Logical Calculi \n\nFor the reduction of classical elementary number theory to its\nintuitionist version, G\u00f6del and Gentzen used different logical\ncalculi. G\u00f6del used the system Herbrand had investigated in his\n1931, whereas Gentzen employed the formalization of intuitionist\narithmetic from Heyting 1930. For his further finitist investigations\nGentzen introduced new calculi that were to become of utmost\nimportance for proof theory: natural deduction and sequent\ncalculi.\n",
