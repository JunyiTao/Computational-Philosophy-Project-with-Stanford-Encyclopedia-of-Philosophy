Given this fact,\nTwardowski's analysis of \u2018presented\u2019 in terms of modifying\nvs. attributive adjectives is fundamental to understand what is\nexactly \u2018judged in a\n judgment.\u2019[5]\n For it is not only in presentations that we can distinguish act,\ncontent and object, but also in judgments. When we pass a judgment, we\neither accept or reject an object through a content. All judgments\nhave a form which can be linguistically expressed as \u2018The object\nA exists\u2019 or \u2018The object A does not exist.\u2019 The\nobject of judgment (A) is what is judged in a judgment. This object is\nthe object of the presentation at the basis of the judgment, it is not\nthe content of the presentation; it is the object presented in the\nattributive sense, not in the modifying sense. The content of a\njudgment is the existence or non-existence of the object presented. It\nmight seem strange at first to hear Twardowski say that the content of\na judgment is the (non-)existence of the object, but Twardowski has\nsomething like the following in mind: we judge about the object A\nthat it exists (or that it does not exist). Twardowski's\nanalysis clarifies what is going on when we judge, in a Brentanian\ntheory of judgment, that the aether does not exist. Judging that the\naether does not exist means rejecting a physical space-filling\nsubstance outside my consciousness. The object of this judgment is not\nmental. However, this does not mean that there is nothing inside my\nconsciousness: there is a mental content, through which the aether is\npresented and judged as non-existing. That content, present in\nme, however, exists; it is the aether itself that does not exist.\n\nFor a theory of judgment like the one sketched above to work, the\nobject we judge must be the very object we present. Therefore,\nTwardowski's thesis must be understood in the strong sense that there\nare no presentations which do not have an object: if a presentation\ndid not have an object, we would not have an object to judge as\nexisting or non-existing. It is for this reason that a crucial part of\nContent and Object is devoted to defending this claim, and to\nshowing that, despite appearances, every presentation has an object\n(\u00a75). This is like saying, coming back to our arrow metaphor,\nthat every arrow points at something. Twardowski's strategy is to show\nthat presentations which are normally deemed by others to be\nobjectless\u2014i.e., arrows that do not point to anything\u2014are\nnot such. There exist no presentations without an object: there are\npresentations whose object does not exist. Twardowski gives a number\nof arguments for his position. Of all these arguments, the key one is\nan argument based on the three functions of names in language.\n\nIf someone uses the expression: \u2018oblique square,\u2019 then he\nmakes known that there occurs in him an act of presentation. The\ncontent, which belongs to this act, constitutes the meaning of this\nname. But this name does not only mean something, it also designates\nsomething, namely, something which combines in itself contradictory\nproperties and whose existence one denies as soon as one feels\ninclined to make a judgment about it. Something is undoubtedly\ndesignated by the name, even though this something does not exist.\n(\u00a75, 23)\n\n\nOn the basis of this reasoning and a linguistic analysis of how\n\u2018nothing\u2019 functions in language Twardowski rejects\nBolzano's claim that \u2018nothing\u2019 is an objectless\npresentation by showing that \u2018nothing\u2019 is a\nsyncategorematic expression (like \u2018and,\u2019 \u2018or,\u2019\nand \u2018the\u2019) not a categorematic one. If an expression is\nnot a categorematic expression, it is not a name; but if an expression\nis not a name, it does not need to have three functions. To every name\nthere corresponds a presentation and vice versa; if an expression is\nnot a name, then there is no presentation corresponding to it. If\nthere is no presentation corresponding to \u2018nothing\u2019\nbecause \u2018nothing\u2019 is not a name, the question of its\nobject does not arise. This argument has been said to anticipate by 37\nyears Carnap's analysis of Heidegger's \u2018The nothing itself\nnothings.\u2019 (Wole\u0144ski 1998, 11). The comparison should\nhowever not make one think that Twardowski shared Carnap's attitude\ntowards metaphysics (see 2.4 below.)\n\nAnother argument given by Twardowski for the thesis that every\npresentation has an object is based on the different ontological\nstatus of act, content, and object of a presentation. The act and the\ncontent always exist; and, in fact, they always exist together,\nforming a whole in the mind, a unified mental reality, though the\ncontent has a dependent existence on the\n act.[6]\n The object may or may not exist. Suppose you have the following\npresentations: the presentation of Barack Obama, that of a possible\nobject such as the aether, and that of an impossible object, such as a\ndodecahedron with thirteen sides or a round square. The objects of\nthese presentations (namely Barack Obama, the aether, and the round\nsquare) differ greatly, but they are still all objects. Barack Obama\nis an existing object; the aether and the dodecahedron with thirteen\nsides are non-existing objects. When we present an object such as a\ndodecahedron with thirteen sides or a round square, the object, that\nwhich is named, is different from the content because the content\nexists and the object does not. It is the object, not the content,\nthat is rejected in the negative existential judgment \u2018the round\nsquare does not exist,\u2019 for it is the object that does not\nexist; the content \u2018exists in the truest sense of the\nword\u2019 (\u00a75, 24).\n\nA third argument rests on the difference between being presented and\nexisting (\u00a75, 24). Those who claim that there are objectless\npresentations, says Twardowski, confuse \u2018being presented\u2019\nwith \u2018existing.\u2019 To reinforce his point, Twardowski offers\nseveral observations, among others, one resting on the claim that it\nis the object which is the bearer of contradictory properties, not the\ncontent. This claim will be described later by Meinong and Mally as\nthe principle of the independence of Being (existence) from Being-So\n(bearing properties). When we present an object which does not exist\nbecause it is contradictory, i.e. impossible, we need not\nimmediately notice that that object has contradictory\nqualities: it is possible that we discover this successively by\nfurther reasoning. Suppose now that only presentations with possible\nobjects are accepted. Then, Twardowski continues, the presentation of\nsomething contradictory would have an object for as long as we did not\nnotice the contradiction; the moment we discovered it, the\npresentation would cease to have an object. What would then bear the\ncontradictory qualities? Since the content can't be what bears the\ncontradictory qualities, it is the object itself that bears them; but\nthen, this object has to be what is presented.\n [7]\n\n\nThe arguments above ultimately rest on the idea that every name has\nthree functions. This assumption can also be seen, in turn, as resting\non an even more basic idea, namely that in all generality\n\u2018object\u2019 equals \u2018being capable to take up the role\nof object in a presentation,\u2019 thus an object is anything that\ncan be presented; and anything that can be named by a name (\u00a73,\n12; \u00a75, 23; \u00a77, 37). Yet, saying that an object is anything\nthat can be named by a name and that a name always has the function of\nnaming are two sides of the same coin, as are the claim that an object\nis anything that can be presented by a presentation and the claim that\na presentation always has an object. This cluster of correlative\nassumptions is the core of the theory. Only when this core is accepted\ncan the other claims put forward by Twardowski (namely (1) that\n\u2018being presented\u2019 is not the same as\n\u2018existing\u2019 and (2) that objects can possess properties\neven though they do not exist) become convincing parts of a cogent\ntheory of intentionality. One might note, however, that it is a theory\nfor which there are no non-circular arguments, for the theory is\nacceptable only to those who are already convinced that there are no\nempty names, that all categorematic terms, including \u2018round\nsquare,\u2019 \u2018aether,\u2019, \u2018Pegasus,\u2019 etc. have\nthe function of naming something, not only the function of being\nmeaningful. \n\nAs is known, the theory, in Meinong's version, will be the critical\ntarget of Russell's \u2018On Denoting\u2019 (1905).\n",
