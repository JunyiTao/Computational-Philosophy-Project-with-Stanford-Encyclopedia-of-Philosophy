Do We Have Free Will?\n\nMost philosophers theorizing about free will take themselves to be\nattempting to analyze a near-universal power of mature human beings.\nBut as we\u2019ve noted above, there have been free will skeptics in\nboth ancient and (especially) modern times. (Israel 2001 highlights a\nnumber of such skeptics in the early modern period.) In this section,\nwe summarize the main lines of argument both for and against the\nreality of human freedom of will.\n",
