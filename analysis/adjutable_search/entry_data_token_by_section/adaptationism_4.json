    "main_text": "Different Flavors of Adaptationism || Methodological Adaptationism\n2.3 Methodological Adaptationism\n\n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page 337) defined\nmethodological adaptationism in this way: \u201cThe best way for scientists\nto approach biological systems is to look for features of adaptation\nand good design. Adaptation is a good \u2018organizing concept\u2019\nfor evolutionary research.\u201d\n\n\n This is a claim about the efficiency of\ntools. No matter how incorrect it may ultimately be to invoke natural\nselection as a sufficient explanation for a trait, it is the most\ndirect way possible to find the true causal explanation of a trait.\nMethodological adaptationism differs markedly from empirical\nadaptationism in that the former acknowledges the possibility that\nnatural selection may ultimately prove not to have the most influence\non a given trait's evolution. In addition, a methodological\nadaptationist can accept that an apparent discrepancy between data and\nthe predictions of a model of natural selection may be resolved by\nconcluding that the trait is little influenced by natural selection,\ninstead of by concluding that the model is incorrect.\n\n\n One potential argument against\nmethodological adaptationism is that a mixture of distinct approaches\nis superior at advancing knowledge as compared to a single approach\n(Kitcher 1993). Allowing for a division of cognitive labor could be a\ngood thing; perhaps evolutionary biology benefits from an array of\nmethodological strategies with differing degrees of risk. This\ncontrasts with the view that multiple approaches with conflicting\nassumptions are a hindrance.\n\n\n Views counter to methodological\nadaptationism range from strong views that deny that adaptation is a\ngood guiding concept to weaker views that privilege different\nexplanations. For example, Gould and Lewontin's (1979)\nargument for considering constraint-based \u201cBauplan\u201d\nexplanations before or along side selective explanations is an example\nof methodological anti-adaptationism.\n",
