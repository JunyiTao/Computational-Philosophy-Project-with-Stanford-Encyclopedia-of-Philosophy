    "main_text": "Stage one: emergence\n4. Stage one: emergence\n\nLike other areas of philosophical study, Africana philosophy emerged\nand matured as its practitioners identified and continued to explore a\nset of core elements. Of the texts, figures, debates, movements,\nschools, and themes that have come to organize conversations in and\ncontributions to the field, many came into focus during the first\nstage of Africana philosophy\u2019s history. Some had long careers\noutside the academy as resources for political mobilization,\nexistential sustenance, aesthetic experience, and critical\nedification, while others were the product of explicitly scholarly\nreflection. (And some were both.) Whatever their origin, many of these\nearly heterodox elements have made or are making their way into an\nacademic world that long wanted little to do with them, and they\ncontinue to set the agenda for contemporary work.\n\nPrecisely locating the start of this early period once more raises\npotentially knotty metaphysical and empirical puzzles. Before the idea\nof Africa as a unitary entity gained sufficient traction (precisely\nwhen this happened is the empirical puzzle), nothing interestingly\nidentifiable as African or Africana philosophy existed. There was a\ngreat deal of philosophizing in the place that would come to be called\nAfrica, and there may be reasons to link those early activities to the\nself-consciously African-oriented reflections that would emerge later.\nBut Gordon is surely right to say that reading ancient Egypt or Kush\nas what some scholars call a classical African civilization\n\u201cmust \u2026 be a modern imposition onto the past\u201d\n(Gordon 2008, 15). He is also right to point out that we typically\nallow this imposition, often without comment, in other\ncontexts\u2014in studies of Asian philosophy, for example, or in\nassuming the organic coherence of western philosophy from Greece to,\nsay Germany.\n\nOrigin puzzles aside, the long run-up to Africana philosophy\u2019s\narrival as a professional paradisciplinary formation yielded a number\nof themes that figure prominently in accounts of the field. Section\n4.1 will introduce some of these characteristic themes, while Section\n4.2 will consider the question of thematic unity across regions,\nintroducing some of the core thinkers along the way.\n",
