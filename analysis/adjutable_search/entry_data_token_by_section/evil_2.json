    "main_text": "Some Important Distinctions || Abstract Versus Concrete Formulations\n1.3 Abstract Versus Concrete Formulations\n\n\nAny version of the argument from evil claims that there is some fact\nconcerning the evil in the world such that the existence of \nGod\u2014understood as at least a very powerful, very knowledgeable, and\nmorally very good person, and, ideally, as an omnipotent, omniscient,\nand morally perfect person\u2014is either logically precluded, or\nrendered unlikely, by that fact.  But versions of the argument often\ndiffer quite significantly with respect to what the relevant fact is.\nSometimes, as in premise (5) in the argument set out above, the\nappeal is to the mere existence of any evil whatever.  Sometimes, on\nthe other hand, it is to the existence of a certain amount of evil.\nAnd sometimes it is to the existence of evils of a certain specified\nsort.\n\nTo formulate the argument from evil in terms of the mere existence\nof any evil at all is to abstract to the greatest extent possible\nfrom detailed information about the evils that are found in the\nworld, and so one is assuming, in effect, that such information\ncannot be crucial for the argument.  But is it clear that this is\nright?  For might one not feel that while the world would be better\noff without the vast majority of evils, this is not so for absolutely\nall evils?  Thus some would argue, for example, that the frustration\nthat one experiences in trying to solve a difficult problem is\noutweighed by the satisfaction of arriving at a solution, and\ntherefore that the world is a better place because it contains such\nevils.  Alternatively, it has been argued that the world is a better\nplace if people develop desirable traits of character\u2014such as\npatience, and courage\u2014by struggling against obstacles, including\nsuffering.  But if either of these things is the case, then the\nprevention of all evil might well make the world a worse place.\n\nIt seems possible, then, that there might be evils that are\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, and this possibility\nprovides a reason, accordingly, for questioning one of the premises\nin the argument set out earlier\u2014namely, premise (4), where it is\nclaimed that if God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to\neliminate all evil.\n\nBut there is also another reason why that claim is problematic,\nwhich arises out of a particular conception of free will\u2014namely, a\nlibertarian conception.  According to this view of free will, and in\ncontrast with what are known as compatibilist approaches, free will\nis incompatible with determinism, and so it is impossible even for an\nomnipotent being to make it the case that someone freely chooses to\ndo what is right.\n\nMany people claim, however, that the world is a better place if it\ncontains individuals who possess libertarian free will, rather than\nindividuals who are free only in a sense that is compatible with\none\u2019s actions being completely determined. If this claim can be made\nplausible, one can argue, first, that God would have a good reason\nfor creating a world with individuals who possessed libertarian free\nwill, but secondly, that if he did choose to create such a world,\neven he could not ensure that no one would ever choose to do\nsomething morally wrong.  The good of libertarian free will requires,\nin short, the possibility of moral evil.\n\nNeither of these lines of argument is immune from challenge.  As\nregards the former, one can argue that the examples that are\ntypically advanced of cases where some evil is logically necessary\nfor a greater good that outweighs the evil are not really, upon close\nexamination, convincing, while, as regards the latter, there is a\nserious problem of making sense of libertarian free will, for\nalthough there is no difficulty about the idea of actions that are\nnot causally determined, libertarian free will requires more than the\nmere absence of determinism, and the difficulty arises when one\nattempts to say what that something more is.\n\nBut although these challenges are important, and may very well turn\nout to be right, it is fair to say, first, that it has not yet been\nestablished that there is no coherent conception of libertarian free\nwill, and, secondly, that it is, at least, very doubtful that one can\nestablish that there cannot be cases where some evil is logically\nnecessary for a greater good that outweighs it without appealing to\nsome substantive, and probably controversial, moral theory.\n\nThe upshot is that the idea that either the actuality of certain\nundesirable states of affairs, or at least the possibility, may be\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, is not without some\ninitial plausibility, and if some such claim can be sustained, it\nwill follow immediately that the mere existence of evil cannot be\nincompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and\nmorally perfect being.\n\nHow does this bear upon evidential formulations of the argument from\nevil?  The answer would seem to be that if there can be evils that are\nlogically necessary for goods that outweigh them, then it is hard to\nsee how the mere existence of evil\u2014in the absence of further\ninformation\u2014can provide much in the way of evidence against\nthe existence of God.\n\nWhat if one shifts to a slightly less abstract formulation of the\nargument from evil that is based upon the premise that the world\ncontains a certain amount of evil, or upon the premise that the world\ncontains at least some natural evil?  Then one is including marginally\nmore information.  But one is still assuming, in effect, that most of\nthe detailed information about the evils found in the world is\ncompletely irrelevant to the argument from evil, and a little\nreflection brings out how very implausible this assumption is.  So,\nfor example, consider a world that contains a billion units of natural\nevil.  Is this a good starting point for an argument from evil? The\nanswer is that, if either a deontological approach to ethics is\ncorrect, or a form of consequentialism that takes the distribution of\ngoods and evils into account, rather than, say, simply the total\namount of goods and evils, whether this fact is an impressive reason\nfor questioning the existence of God surely depends on further details\nabout the world. If those billion units are uniformly distributed over\ntrillions of people whose lives are otherwise extremely satisfying and\necstatically happy, it is not easy to see a serious problem of evil.\nBut if, on the other hand, the billion units of natural evil fell upon\na single innocent person, and produced a life that was, throughout,\none of extraordinarily intense pain, then surely there would be a very\nserious problem of evil.\n\nDetails concerning such things as how suffering and other evils are\ndistributed over individuals, and the nature of those who undergo the\nevils, are, then, of crucial importance.  Thus it is relevant, for\nexample, that many innocent children suffer agonizing deaths.  It is\nrelevant that animals suffer, and that they did so before there were\nany persons to observe their suffering, and to feel sympathy for\nthem.  It is also relevant that, on the one hand, the suffering that\npeople undergo apparently bears no relation to the moral quality of\ntheir lives, and, on the other, that it bears a very clear relation\nto the wealth and medical knowledge of the societies in which they\nlive.\n\nThe prospects for a successful abstract version of the argument from\nevil would seem, therefore, rather problematic.  It is conceivable,\nof course, that the correct moral principles entail that there cannot\nbe any evils whose actuality or possibility makes for a better world.\nBut to attempt to set out a version of the argument from evil that\nrequires a defense of that thesis is certainly to swim upstream.  A\nmuch more promising approach, surely, is to focus, instead, simply\nupon those evils that are thought, by the vast majority of people, to\npose at least a prima facie problem for the rationality of belief in\nan omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person.\n\nGiven that the preceding observations are rather obvious ones, one\nmight have expected that discussions of the argument from evil would\nhave centered mainly upon concrete formulations of the\nargument. Rather surprisingly, that has not been so. Indeed, some\nauthors seem to focus almost exclusively upon very abstract versions\nof the argument.\n\nOne of the more striking illustrations of this phenomenon is\nprovided by Alvin Plantinga\u2019s discussions of the problem of evil. In\nGod and Other Minds, in The Nature of Necessity,\nand in God, Freedom, and Evil, for example, Plantinga,\nstarting out from an examination of John L. Mackie\u2019s essay \u201cEvil\nand Omnipotence\u201d (1955), in which Mackie had defended an\nincompatibility version of the argument from evil, focuses mainly on\nthe question of whether the existence of God is compatible with the\nexistence of evil, although there are also short discussions of\nwhether the existence of God is compatible with the existence of a\ngiven quantity of evil, and of whether the existence of a certain\namount of evil renders the existence of God unlikely.  (The latter\ntopic is then the total focus of attention in his long article,\n\u201cThe Probabilistic Argument from Evil\u201d.)\n\nThat Plantinga initially focused upon abstract formulations of the\nargument from evil was not, perhaps, surprising, given that a number\nof writers\u2014including Mackie, H. J. McCloskey (1960), and\nH. D. Aiken (1957\u201358)\u2014had defended incompatibility versions of\nthe argument from evil, and it is natural to formulate such arguments\nin an abstract way, since although one may wish to distinguish, for\nexample, between natural evils and moral evils, reference to concrete\ncases of evil would not seem to add anything.  But once one shifts to\nprobabilistic formulations of the argument from evil, the situation is\nvery different: details about concrete cases of evil may be\nevidentially crucial.\n\nThe problem, then, is that Plantinga not only started out by focusing\non very abstract versions of the argument from evil, but also\nmaintained this focus throughout.  The explanation of this may lie in\nthe fact that Plantinga seems to have believed that if it can be shown\nthat the existence of God is neither incompatible with, nor rendered\nimprobable by, either (1) the mere existence of evil, or (2) the\nexistence of a specified amount of evil, then no philosophical problem\nremains. People may find, of course, that they are still troubled by\nthe existence of specific evils, but this, Plantinga seems to be\nbelieve, is a religious problem, and what is called for, he suggests,\nis not philosophical argument, but \u201cpastoral\ncare\u201d (1974a,\n63\u20134).[1]\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s view here, however, is very implausible. For not only can\nthe argument from evil be formulated in terms of specific evils, but\nthat is the natural way to do so, given that it is only certain types\nof evils that are generally viewed as raising a serious problem with\nrespect to the rationality of belief in God. To concentrate\nexclusively on abstract versions of the argument from evil is\ntherefore to ignore the most plausible and challenging versions of the\nargument.\n",
