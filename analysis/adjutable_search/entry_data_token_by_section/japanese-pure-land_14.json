    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Pure Land Buddhist Anthropology\n4.2 Pure Land Buddhist Anthropology\n\nFor H\u014dnen and his followers, the characterization of \u201cdeep\nmind\u201d (one of \u201cthree minds\u201d or attitudes prescribed\nin the Contemplation Sutra) by the Chinese master Shandao\n(613\u2013681) provides a classic expression of the understanding of\nhuman existence in the Pure Land path:\n\n\n\u201cDeep mind\u201d is the deeply entrusting mind. There are two\naspects. One is to believe deeply and decidedly that you are a foolish\nbeing of karmic evil caught in birth-and-death, ever sinking and ever\nwandering in transmigration from innumerable kalpas in the past, with\nnever a condition that would lead to emancipation. The second is to\nbelieve deeply and decidedly that Amida Buddha\u2019s Forty-eight\nVows grasp sentient beings, and that allowing yourself to be carried\nby the power of the Vow without any doubt or apprehension, you will\nattain birth. (Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra, quoted\nin Shinran CWS I: 85.)\n\nSecond [of the three minds] is deep mind, which is true and real\nshinjin. One truly knows oneself to be a foolish being full of blind\npassions, with scant roots of good, transmigrating in the three realms\nand unable to emerge from this burning house. And further, one truly\nknows now, without so much as a single thought of doubt, that\nAmida\u2019s universal Primal Vow decisively enables all to attain\nbirth, including those who say the Name even down to ten times, or\neven but hear it. (Hymns of Birth in the Pure Land, quoted in\nShinran CWS I: 92)\n\n\nThree points may be noted here. First, the self-awareness of the\npractitioner indicated by Shan-tao is that of a human being wholly\nincapable of fulfilling Buddhist practices. This is expressed in\neschatological terms of endless entrapment in samsaric existence: one\nis burdened by the karmic consequences of evil acts of past lives\nextending from the immeasurable past; one continues to act from the\ndesires and hatreds arising from ignorant self-attachment in the\npresent; bereft as one is of any genuine goodness, one\u2019s future\ncan only be further painful existence in endless transmigration.\n\nThe second point is that this self-awareness coexists with the\nrealization that all beings are enabled to attain birth in the Pure\nLand through Amida\u2019s Vow. In other words, the self-reflection\nimplied in deep mind is, in its opposite aspect, at the same time deep\ntrust in the salvific power of Amida. The third point is that while\nhuman being and Buddha stand thus as thoroughgoing opposites\u2014the\nbeing filled with afflicting passions and lacking any goodness that\nmight lead toward enlightenment, on the one hand, and the Buddha\nfreely exerting the power of wisdom-compassion, on the\nother\u2014deep mind arises as a unitary awareness out of the\ninteraction of being and Buddha. Self-reflection and trust arise\nsimultaneously. Without the approach of Amida, not only trust, but\nalso genuine self-awareness is unattainable.\n\nH\u014dnen, who was renowned in his period as a Tendai monk of\nextensive learning and exemplary practice, gives direct expression to\nthe two aspects of \u201cdeep mind\u201d:\n\n\nAlthough Buddhism is vast, in essence it is composed of no more than\nthe three learnings [of precepts, meditation, and wisdom.] \u2026\nBut as for precepts, I myself do not keep a single one. In meditation,\nI have not attained even one. In wisdom, I have not attained the right\nwisdom of cutting off discriminative thinking and realizing the\nfruit\u2026 . [Nevertheless,] without distinguishing between wise\nand foolish, the upholding of precepts and the breaking of them, Amida\nBuddha comes to welcome us. (Recorded in Tetsu senchaku hongan\nnembutsu sh\u016b, J\u014ddosh\u016b zensho 7:\n95\u201396)\n\n\nIt is in such self-awareness that we see the force behind\nH\u014dnen\u2019s radical reorientation of the understanding of\npraxis. H\u014dnen saw clearly that unless a wholly new perspective\nwere established regarding the categorization and evaluation of the\nmyriad practices taught in Buddhist tradition, the genuine meaning of\nthe Pure Land path as he had come to understand it would remain\nobscure, and vocal nembutsu would continue to be viewed by all people\nas merely an expedient practice for inferior practitioners. He\ntherefore raised the issue of the subjectivity of the practitioner,\nand insisted that commonsense hierarchies rooted in presuppositions of\none\u2019s own fundamental perspicuity and autonomous capacity to\njudge had to be abandoned. To accomplish this shift, H\u014dnen relied\non the thoroughgoing application of his innovative concept of\n\u201cselection from among alternatives\u201d (senchaku),\nwhich refers most centrally to Amida\u2019s own selection, for\nbeings, of vocal nembutsu as the single, universally accessible\npractice that results in birth into the Pure Land. Beings\u2019\ntaking up of the Pure Land path is thus founded upon Amida\u2019s\nselection and fulfillment of the nembutsu for all beings equally. We\nsee, therefore, that the dual awareness of \u201cdeep mind\u201d is\nat the core of H\u014dnen\u2019s path.\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s methodical logic led to positions easily vilified\nby scholar-monks of the traditional schools. One example is his\nenumeration of \u201cthe awakening of aspiration for\nenlightenment\u201d (hotsu bodaishin) among the traditional\n\u201cpractices\u201d to be set aside by nembutsu practitioners. As\nexplained in section 2.2 above, this\n\u201cbodhi-mind\u201d\u2014the profound aspiration for\nenlightenment for oneself and all beings\u2014had traditionally\nbeen considered the crucial starting point for the Mahayana\nbodhisattva, and other Japanese Pure Land masters such as Genshin had\naffirmed it to be the core of genuine desire for the Pure Land.\nAlthough H\u014dnen\u2019s position is somewhat ambiguous, in\nSenchakush\u016b his steadfast logic leads understandably to\na rejection of the notion that any attitude or attainment beyond trust\nand utterance is necessary for the person of nembutsu.\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s religious anthropology is perhaps the hallmark of\nhis tradition, but his closest disciples sought to balance his\nrejection of self-power with the delineation of the working of Other\nPower in the practitioner. One of the harshest criticisms of\nH\u014dnen from the traditional schools came from My\u014de\n(1173\u20131232), of the Kegon school. My\u014de argued that\nawakening the bodhi-mind was not to be viewed as a specific practice\nwithin the path, but as the core of all authentic Mahayana praxis,\nwhich must be infused with the nondiscriminative wisdom that is also\ncompassion. Thus, H\u014dnen\u2019s rejection of bodhi-mind was a\ndeparture from the fundamental truths of Mahayana Buddhism itself.\n\nOn a superficial level, the answer to My\u014de was not difficult for\nH\u014dnen\u2019s followers. Disciples such as Shinran and\nSh\u014dk\u016b affirmed the role of the bodhi-mind in the Pure Land\npath by identifying it with trust in Amida\u2019s vow on the part of\npractitioners. Shinran, for example, distinguishes various types of\nbodhi-mind and identifies that of the true Pure Land path with his\nconception of shinjin. Sh\u014dk\u016b similarly identifies the taking\nof refuge in the vow with bodhi-mind. My\u014de\u2019s criticism,\nhowever, points to the underlying issue of the stark dualism of the\nunenlightened being and the enlightened Buddha in H\u014dnen\u2019s\nteaching. If there is no cause in beings leading to attainment, how\ncan even trust in Amida\u2019s vow arise in them? If they have the\nability to give rise to trust, can they not perform other practices\nalso?\n\nH\u014dnen\u2019s disciples again elaborate diverse conceptions of\ntrust in Amida\u2019s vow, but at bottom there are two elements. That\nwhich is real (suchness, thusness, nondual reality, buddha-nature,\netc.) pervades all beings; nevertheless, beings can come to awareness\nof it only in relation to Amida Buddha, which is manifested in trust\nin the vow. The question of the nature of the relation leads to the\nproblem of hermeneutics.\n",
