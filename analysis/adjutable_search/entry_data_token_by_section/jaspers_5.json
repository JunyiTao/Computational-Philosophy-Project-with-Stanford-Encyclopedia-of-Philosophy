Later Works: The Politics of Humanism\n\nThese humanistic reflections on the philosophy of religion are not\nisolated components of Jaspers\u2019s work. In fact, his criticism of\nreligious dogmatism evolved in conjunction with a wider doctrine of\nhumanism, which ultimately became the defining component of his later\nwork. Arguably, Jaspers was always a humanist; certainly, if humanism\nis defined as a doctrine which seeks to account for the specificity,\nuniqueness and dignity of human life his work can, from the outset, be\nseen as a variant on philosophical humanism. The argument runs through\nall his early works that human beings are distinguished by the fact\nthat they have authentic attributes of existence and\ntranscendence\u2014that is, by their ability to raise questions about\nthemselves and their freedoms which cannot be posed in material or\nscientific terms, and by their resultant capacity for decisive\nreversal, self-transformation and transcendence. True humanity is thus\na condition of free self-possession and transcendent authenticity. In\ngeneral terms, existentialism can be divided between philosophers,\nsuch as Jean-Paul Sartre, who defined existentialism as a humanism,\nand those, such as Heidegger, who saw the organization of philosophy\naround the analysis of human determinacy as a metaphysical corruption\nof philosophy. Jaspers clearly belonged to the first category of\nexistential philosophers.\n\nIn his writings after 1945, most especially in Vom\nUrsprung und Ziel der Geschichte (The Origin and Goal of\nHistory, 1949) and Die Atombombe und die Zukunft des\nMenschen (The Atom Bomb and the Future of Mankind,\n1961), Jaspers structured his work quite explicitly as a humanist\ndoctrine. From this time on, moreover, he attached greater importance\nto the social and collective conditions of human integrity and he\ntended to tone down his earlier construction of interiority as the\nplace of human freedom. In fact, even the term Existenz\nbecame increasingly scarce in his post-1945 publications, and it was\nreplaced, to a large extent, by ideas of shared humanity, founded, not\nin the decisive experiences of inner transformation, but in the\nresources of culture, tradition and ethically modulated political\nlife. Central to these later works, consequently, was not only a turn\ntowards humanistic reflection, but also an inquiry into the politics\nof humanism and the distinctively human preconditions of political\nexistence.\n\nBroadly reconstructed, in his later political work he argued that the\nemergence of European totalitarianism\u2014exemplified by both\nNational Socialism and Communism\u2014was the result of a decline in\npolitical humanity and of an increasing primacy of modes of technical\nor instrumental rationality, which erode the authentic resources of\nhuman life. He therefore sought to offer an account of a human polity,\nable to provide an enduring bastion against totalitarian inhumanity.\nFirst, he argued, the human polity must be sustained by an integral\ncultural tradition, so that human beings can interpret the ciphers of\ntheir integrity in the ethical contents of a national culture. The\npolitical betrayal of humanity, he suggested, is usually flanked by,\nand in fact presupposes, a cultural betrayal of humanity, and\ntotalitarian governance normally arises from the erosion or\ninstrumental subjection of culture. In the nineteenth century Marx had\nargued that the reactionary malaise of German politics was caused by\nthe fact that German society habitually allowed culture to stand in\nfor politics and defined the relatively de-politicized educated\nbourgeois elite [Bildungsb\u00fcrgertum] as the pillar of\nsocial order and the arbiter of progress. Jaspers responded to this\ncharacterization of Germany by claiming that societies which undermine\nthe cultural role of the bourgeois elite are inherently unstable, and\nthat the educated bourgeoisie has a primary role to play in upholding\nthe preconditions of democratic culture. Second, he argued that the\nhuman polity must be based in free communication between citizens:\ncommunicative freedom is a prerequisite of public virtue. The human\npolity, he thus implied, is likely to be some kind of democracy, based\nin some degree of publicly formed consensus. Like Arendt, in fact, he\nconcluded that social atomization creates cultures in which\ntotalitarianism is likely to flourish, and that only unregulated\ndebate in the public sphere can offset this latent pathology of mass\nsociety. Third, he argued that the resources of technological,\nscientific and economic planning employed by the political system\nshould be kept at a minimum, and that the existence of an unplanned\nsphere of human interaction is necessary for the maintenance of a\nhuman political order. In this respect, he fervently opposed all\ntendencies towards technocratic governance, which he identified both\nin the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe, and in the rapidly expanding\nwelfare state of the Federal Republic under Adenauer. Technocracy, he\nasserted, is the objective form of the instrumental tendencies in\nhuman reason, and if it is not counterbalanced by the integrally human\nresources of cultural or rational communication it is likely to result\nin oppressive government. In this respect, he moved close to quite\nstandard variants on political liberalism, and he endorsed limited\ngovernment, relative cultural and economic freedom, and protection for\nsociety from unaccountable political direction. Fourth, he also argued\nthat a human polity requires a constitutional apparatus, enshrining\nbasic rights, imposing moral-legal order on the operations of the\nstate, and restricting the prerogative powers of the political\napparatus. Like Kant, therefore, he advocated the institution of an\ninternational federation of states, with shared constitutions, laws\nand international courts. Fifth, however, he also retained aspects of\nthe elite-democratic outlook which he had first inherited from Weber,\nand he continued to argue that the human polity must be supported and\nguided by reasonable persons or responsible elites.\n\nAfter the traumas of National Socialism and the war, however, it is\nfair to say that Jaspers\u2019s political philosophy never moved\nfinally beyond a sceptical attitude towards pure democracy, and his\npolitical writings never fully renounced the sense that German society\nwas not sufficiently evolved to support a democracy, and Germans\nrequired education and guidance for democracy to take hold. Even in\nhis last writings of the 1960s, in which he declared tentative support\nfor the activities of the student movement around 1968, there remain\ntraces of elite-democratic sympathy. For all his importance in modern\nGerman politics, therefore, his philosophy of politics was always\nslightly anachronistic, and his position remained embedded in the\npersonalistic ideals of statehood which characterized the old-liberal\npolitical culture of Imperial Germany and persisted in the\nconservative-liberal fringes of the Weimar Republic.\n\nJaspers left unfinished Die Gro\u00dfen Philosophen, whose\ndeclared aim was \u201cpromoting the happiness that comes of meeting\ngreat men and sharing in their thoughts\u201d, and employed his\npersonal method of constant questioning and struggle. This is a\nmonumental project of universal history of philosophy, whose creators\nwere the outstanding philosophers who inspired the human thought.\nJaspers, who believed that only through communication with others can\nwe come to ourselves and to wisdom, regarded the philosophers he\ndiscusses in this book as his \u201ceternal contemporaries\u201d and\n\u201cthe disturbers\u201d in the sense of thinkers for whom doubt\nand despair loomed large. The first two volumes of this work appeared\nin 1958, while the third and fourth have been gathered from the vast\nmaterial of his posthumous papers. The editors Ermarth and Ehrlich\nhave, however, been able to stitch together a coherent book that, in\naccordance with Jaspers\u2019s plan, primarily covers the\nphilosophers whom he termed \u201cthe disturbers\u201d: thinkers for\nwhom doubt and despair loomed large. The English translations were by\nRalf Manheim and edited by Hannah Arendt, and appeared in parts until\n1994.\n",
