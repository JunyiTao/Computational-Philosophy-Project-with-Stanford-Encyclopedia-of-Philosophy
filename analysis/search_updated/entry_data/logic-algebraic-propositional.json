    "preamble": "\n\nGeorge Boole was the first to present logic as a mathematical theory\nin algebraic style. In his work, and in that of the other algebraists\nof the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the\ndistinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous\nsemantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this\ntradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,\nand relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical\none.\n\nThe works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on\nthe way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by\na formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and\na set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a\nlogical deduction system, and the formulas derivable in the\ncalculus its theorems (nowadays it is common practice in\nalgebraic logic to refer to this type of calculi as Hilbert-style and\nin proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and\nRussell\u2019s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of\nwhatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal\nlanguages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an\nintuitive, informal kind.\n\nThe systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical\nlogic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered\nby other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics\ndifferent from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell\ntradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal\nsemantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.\nLewis (1918, 1932) and to the axiomatization of intuitionistic logic\nby Heyting (1930).\n\nThe idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell\u2019s logical\ndeduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that\ncorrespond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.\nThe concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,\nand this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics\nthat were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal\nsystems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the\nresearch on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and\nsometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical\nconsequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.\nTarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both\nsemantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has\ngrown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics\nobtained during the last century.\n\nThe concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than\nthose of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a\ngeneral theory. The first attempts in the process of building the\ngeneral theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the\nstudy of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the\nsystematic presentation by W\u00f3jcicki (1988) of the\ninvestigations of a general nature on propositional logics as\nconsequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,\nfollowing the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, \u0141ukasiewicz and\nothers in the first part of the twentieth century.\n\nIt was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an\nalgebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be\ntaken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a\nformal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were\nalso used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the\nones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,\nin particular the property of being closed under substitution\ninstances; soon after  logical matrices were also  used to\ndefine logics as consequence relations.\n\nAlgebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the\ndiscipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of\nalgebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related\nmathematical structures and that relates the properties that the\nlogics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra\nrelated structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these\nalgebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand.\n\nFrom the algebraic study of particular logics, a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with\nthe aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of\nobtaining general and informative results relating the properties a\nlogic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or\nalgebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those\nalgebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is\nthe process by which to associate with any given logic a class of\nalgebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of that\ngeneral theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the\n1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and\nat that time also the assumptions about the class of algebras that\ndeserves to be taken as the natural one to associate with a given logic\nstarted to be made more and more explicit.\n\nIn this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the\nalgebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.\nThis theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic\nLogic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this\nfield.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Abstract consequence relations\n\nTarski\u2019s work (1930a, 1930b, 1935, 1936) on the methodology of\nthe deductive sciences of the 1920s and 1930s studies the axiomatic\nmethod abstractly and introduces for the first time the abstract\nconcept of consequence operation. Tarski had mainly in mind the\ndifferent mathematical axiomatic theories. On these theories, the\nsentences that are proved from the axioms are consequences of them but\n(of course) almost all of them are not logical truths; under a\nsuitable formalization of these theories, a logical calculus like\nFrege\u2019s or Russell\u2019s can be used to derive the\nconsequences of the axioms. Tarski set the framework to study the most\ngeneral properties of the operation that assigns to a set of axioms\nits consequences.\n\nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\) and an arbitrary\nset of formulas \\(X\\), a formula \\(a\\)\nis deducible in \\(H\\) from \\(X\\)\nif there is a finite sequence of formulas any one of\nwhich belongs to \\(X\\) or is an axiom of \\(H\\)\nor is obtained from previous formulas in the sequence\nby one of the inference rules of \\(H\\). Such a sequence\nis a deduction (or proof) in \\(H\\) of \\(a\\)\nwith premises or hypotheses in \\(X\\).\nLet \\(Cn(X)\\) be the set of formulas deducible in \\(H\\)\nfrom the formulas in \\(X\\) taken as premises or\nhypothesis. This set is called the set of consequences of \\(X\\)\n(relative to the logical deduction system \\(H\\)).\n\\(Cn\\) is then an operation that is applied to sets\nof formulas to obtain new sets of formulas. It has the following\nproperties: For every set of formulas \\(X\\)\n\n\\(X \\subseteq Cn(X)\\)\n\\(Cn(Cn(X)) = Cn(X)\\)\n\\(Cn(X) = \\bigcup\\{Cn(Y): Y \\subseteq X, Y \\textrm{\nfinite}\\}\\)\n\n\nThe third condition  stipulates that \\(Cn(X)\\) is equal to the union of the set of\nformulas derivable from finite subsets of \\(X\\). Tarski\ntook these properties to define the notion of consequence operation\naxiomatically. In fact, he added that there is a formula \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(Cn(\\{x\\})\\) is the set \\(A\\)\nof all the formulas and that this set must be finite\nor of the cardinality of the set of the natural numbers. Condition (3)\nimplies the weaker, and important, condition of monotonicity\n\nif \\(X \\subseteq Y \\subseteq A\\), then \\(Cn(X)\n\\subseteq Cn(Y)\\).\n\n\nTo encompass the whole class of logic systems one finds in the\nliterature, a slightly more general definition than Tarski\u2019s is\nrequired. We will say that an abstract consequence operation\n\\(C\\) on an arbitrary set \\(A\\) is an\noperation that applied to subsets of \\(A\\) gives\nsubsets of \\(A\\) and for all \\(X, Y \\subseteq A\\)\nsatisfies the conditions (1), (2) and (4) above. If in addition \\(C\\)\nsatisfies (3) we say that it is a finitary\nconsequence operation.\n\nConsequence operations are present not only in logic but in many areas\nof mathematics. Abstract consequence operations are known as closure\noperators in universal algebra and lattice theory, for instance. In\ntopology the operation that sends a subset of a topological space to\nits topological closure is a closure operator. In fact, the topologies\non a set \\(A\\) can be identified with the closure\noperators on \\(A\\) that satisfy the additional\nconditions that \\(C(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing\\) and \\(C(X \\cup Y) =\nC(X) \\cup C(Y)\\) for all \\(X, Y \\subseteq A\\).\n\nGiven a consequence operation \\(C\\) on a set \\(A\\),\na subset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\)\nis said to be \\(C\\)-closed,\nor a closed set of \\(C\\), if \\(C(X) = X\\).\n\nA different, but mathematically equivalent, (formal) approach is to\nconsider consequence relations on a set of formulas instead of\nconsequence operations. A(n) (abstract) consequence relation\non the set of formulas of a formal language is a relation \\(\\vdash\\)\nbetween sets of formulas and formulas that satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\nif \\(a \\in X\\), then \\(X \\vdash a\\)\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\) and \\(X \\subseteq Y\\), then \\(Y \\vdash a\\)\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\) and for every \\(b \\in X, Y \\vdash b\\), then \\(Y\n\\vdash a\\).\n\n\nIt is finitary if in addition it satisfies\n\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\), then there is a finite set \\(Y \\subseteq X\\)\nsuch that \\(Y \\vdash a\\).\n\n\nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\), the relation\n\\(\\vdash\\) defined by \\(X \\vdash a\\) if \\(a\\) is\ndeducible from \\(X\\) in \\(H\\) is (according to all we have already seen) a\nfinitary consequence relation. Nonetheless, we are used not only to\nsyntactic definitions of consequence relations but also to semantic\ndefinitions. For example, we define classical propositional\nconsequence using truth valuations, first-order consequence relation\nusing structures, intuitionistic consequence relation using Kripke\nmodels, etc. Sometimes these model-theoretic definitions of\nconsequence relations define non-finitary consequence relations, for\nexample, the consequence relations for infinitary formal languages and\nthe consequence relation of second-order logic with the so-called\nstandard semantics.\n\nIn general, an abstract consequence relation on a set \\(A\\)\n(not necessarily the set of formulas of some formal\nlanguage) is a relation \\(\\vdash\\) between subsets of \\(A\\)\nand elements of \\(A\\) that satisfies\nconditions (1)\u2013(3) above. If it also satisfies (4) it is said to\nbe finitary. If \\(\\vdash\\) is an abstract consequence relation and \\(X\n\\vdash a\\), then we can say that \\(X\\) is a set of\npremises or hypothesis with conclusion \\(a\\) according\nto \\(\\vdash\\) and that \\(a\\) follows from \\(X\\),\nor is entailed by \\(X\\) (according to\n\\(\\vdash)\\). The abstract consequence relations correspond to\nKoslow\u2019s implication structures; see Koslow 1992 for the closely\nrelated but different approach to logics (in a broad sense) as\nconsequence relations introduced by that author.\n\nThe consequence operations on a set \\(A\\) are in\none-to-one correspondence with the abstract consequence relations on\n\\(A\\). The move from a consequence operation \\(C\\)\nto a consequence relation \\(\\vdash_C\\) and,\nconversely, from a consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) to a consequence\noperation \\(C_{\\vdash}\\) is easy and given by the definitions:\n\n\\[ X \\vdash_C a \\txtiff a \\in C(X) \\hspace{3mm} \\textrm{ and } \\hspace{3mm} a \\in C_{\\vdash}(X) \\txtiff X \\vdash a. \\]\n\n\nMoreover, if \\(C\\) is finitary, so is \\(\\vdash_C\\) and\nif \\(\\vdash\\) is finitary, so is \\(C_{\\vdash}\\).\n\nFor a general discussion on logical consequence see the entry\n Logical Consequence.\n2. Logics as consequence relations\n\nIn this section we define what propositional logics are and explain\nthe basic concepts relating to them. We will call the propositional\nlogics (as defined below) simply logic systems.\n\nOne of the main traits of the consequence relations we study in logic\nis their formal character. This roughly means that if a sentence \\(a\\)\nfollows from a set of sentences \\(X\\)\nand we have another sentence \\(b\\) and another set of\nsentences \\(Y\\) that share the same form with \\(a\\)\nand \\(X\\) respectively, then \\(b\\)\nalso follows from \\(Y\\). In\npropositional logics this boils down to saying that if we uniformly\nreplace basic sub-sentences of the sentences in \\(X \\cup \\{a\\}\\) by\nother sentences obtaining \\(Y\\) and \\(b\\),\nthen \\(b\\) follows from \\(Y\\).\n(The reader can find more information on the idea of\nformality in the entry\n Logical Consequence.)\n\nTo turn the idea of the formal character of logics into a rigorous\ndefinition we need to introduce the concept of propositional language\nand the concept of substitution.\n\nA propositional language (a language, for short) \\(L\\) is a set of\nconnectives, that is, a set of symbols each one of which has an arity\n\\(n\\) that tells us in case that \\(n = 0\\) that the\nsymbol is a propositional constant, and in case that \\(n \\gt 0\\)\nwhether the connective is unary, binary, ternary, etc. For example\n\\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\bot , \\top \\}\\) is (or can be) the\nlanguage of several logics, like classical and intuitionistic,\n\\((\\bot\\) and \\(\\top\\) are 0-ary and the other connectives are\nbinary), \\(\\{\\neg , \\wedge , \\vee \\rightarrow , \\Box , \\Diamond \\}\\)\nis the language of several modal logics, \\((\\neg , \\Box , \\Diamond\\)\nare unary and the other connectives binary) and \\(\\{ \\wedge , \\vee ,\n\\rightarrow , * , \\top , \\bot , 1, 0\\}\\) is the language of\nmany-valued logics and also of a fragment of linear logic \\((\\bot ,\n\\top , 1\\), and 0 are propositional constants and the other symbols\nbinary connectives).\n\nGiven a language \\(L\\) and a set of propositional\nvariables \\(V\\) (which is disjoint from \\(L)\\), the\nformulas of \\(L\\), or \\(L\\)-formulas,\nare defined inductively as\nfollows:\n\nEvery variable is a formula.\nEvery 0-ary symbol is a formula.\nIf \\(*\\) is a connective and \\(n \\gt 0\\) is its\narity, then for all formulas \\(\\phi_1 ,\\ldots ,\\phi_n, * \\phi_1 \\ldots\n\\phi_n\\) is also a formula.\n\n\nA substitution \\(\\sigma\\) for \\(L\\) is a map\nfrom the set of variables \\(V\\) to the set of formulas\nof \\(L\\). It tells us which formula must replace which\nvariable when we perform the substitution. If \\(p\\) is\na variable, then \\(\\sigma(p)\\) denotes the formula that the\nsubstitution \\(\\sigma\\) assigns to \\(p\\). The result of\napplying a substitution \\(\\sigma\\) to a formula \\(\\phi\\) is the\nformula \\(\\bsigma(\\phi)\\) obtained from \\(\\phi\\) by simultaneously\nreplacing the variables in \\(\\phi\\), say \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_k\\), by,\nrespectively, the formulas \\(\\sigma(p_1), \\ldots ,\\sigma(p_k)\\). In\nthis way, a substitution \\(\\sigma\\) gives a unique map \\(\\bsigma\\)\nfrom the set of formulas to itself that satisfies\n\n\\(\\bsigma(p) = \\sigma(p)\\), for every variable \\(p\\),\n\\(\\bsigma(\\dagger) = \\dagger\\), for every 0-ary connective\n\\(\\dagger\\),\n\\(\\bsigma(* \\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n) = * \\bsigma(\\phi_1)\\ldots\n\\bsigma(\\phi_n)\\), for every connective \\(*\\) of arity\n\\(n \\gt 0\\) and formulas \\(\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n\\).\n\n\nA formula \\(\\psi\\) is a substitution instance of a formula\n\\(\\phi\\) if there is a substitution \\(\\sigma\\) such that when applied\nto \\(\\phi\\) gives \\(\\psi\\), that is, if \\(\\bsigma(\\phi) = \\psi\\).\n\nIn order to avoid unnecessary complications we will assume in the\nsequel that all the logics use the same denumerable set \\(V\\) of\nvariables, so that the definition of formula of \\(L\\)\ndepends only on \\(L\\). A logic system (or\nlogic for short) is given by a language \\(L\\)\nand a consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) on the set of formulas of \\(L\\)\nthat is formal in the sense that for every\nsubstitution \\(\\sigma\\), every set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every\nformula \\(\\phi\\), \n\n\\[ \\textrm{if } \\Gamma \\vdash \\phi, \\textrm{ then } \\bsigma[\\Gamma] \\vdash\\bsigma(\\phi) \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\bsigma[\\Gamma]\\) is the set of the formulas obtained by\napplying the substitution \\(\\sigma\\) to the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\).\nThe consequence relations on the set of formulas of a language that\nsatisfy this property are called structural and also\nsubstitution-invariant in the literature. They were\nconsidered for the first time in \u0141o\u015b & Suszko 1958.\nTarski only explicitly considered closed sets also closed under\nsubstitution instances for some consequence relations; he never\nconsidered (at least explicitly) the substitution invariance condition\nfor consequence relations.\n\nWe will refer to logic systems by the letter \\(\\bL\\) with possible\nsubindices, and we set \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\bL_n = \\langle L_n, \\vdash_{\\bL_n } \\rangle\\) with the\nunderstanding that \\(L \\; (L_n)\\) is the language of \\(\\bL \\;(\\bL_n)\\)\nand \\(\\vdash_{\\bL }\\; (\\vdash_{\\bL_n })\\) its consequence relation. A\nlogic system \\(\\bL\\) is finitary if \\(\\vdash_{\\bL}\\) is a\nfinitary consequence relation.\n\nThe consequence relation of a logic system can be given in several\nways, some using proof-theoretic tools, others semantic means. A\nsubstitution-invariant consequence relation can be defined using a\nproof system like a Hilbert-style axiom system, a Gentzen-style\nsequent calculus or a natural deduction style calculus, etc. One can\nalso define a substitution-invariant consequence relation semantically\nusing a class of mathematical objects (algebras, Kripke models,\ntopological models, etc.) and a satisfaction relation.\n\nIf \\(\\bL_1 = \\langle L,\\vdash_{\\bL_1 } \\rangle\\) is a logic system\nwith \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\) defined by a proof-system and \\(\\bL_2 =\n\\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\rangle\\) is a logic system over the same\nlanguage with \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\) defined semantically, we say that the\nproof-system used to define \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\) is sound for\nthe semantics used to define \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\) if \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\)\nis included in \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\), namely if \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_1 }\n\\phi\\) implies \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\phi\\). If the other inclusion\nholds the proof-system is said to be complete with respect to\nthe semantics that defines \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\), that is, when \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\phi\\) implies \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_1 } \\phi\\).\n\nA set of \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) is called a\ntheory of a logic system \\(\\bL\\), or \\(\\bL\\)-theory, if it is\nclosed under the relation \\(\\vdash_{\\bL}\\), that is, if whenever\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\) it also holds that \\(\\phi \\in \\Gamma\\).\nIn other words, the theories of \\(\\bL\\) are the closed sets of the\nconsequence operation \\(C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL}}\\) on the set of \\(L\\)-formulas.\nIn order to simplify the notation we denote\nthis consequence operation by \\(C_{\\bL}\\). A formula \\(\\phi\\) is a\ntheorem (or validity) of \\(\\bL\\) if \\(\\varnothing \\vdash_{\\bL\n} \\phi\\). Then \\(C_{\\bL }(\\varnothing)\\) is the set of theorems of\n\\(\\bL\\) and is the least theory of \\(\\bL\\). The set of all theories of\n\\(\\bL\\) will be denoted by \\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\).\nGiven a logic system \\(\\bL\\), the consequence operation \\(C_{\\bL}\\) is substitution-invariant, which means that for every set of \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every substitution \\(\\sigma, \\bsigma[C_{\\bL}(\\Gamma)] \\subseteq C_{\\bL}(\\bsigma[\\Gamma]\\)). Moreover, for every theory \\(T\\) of \\(\\bL\\) we have a new consequence \\(C_{\\bL }^T\\) operation defined as follows: \\[C_{\\bL }^T (\\Gamma) = C_{\\bL }(T \\cup \\Gamma)\\] that is, \\(C_{\\bL }^T (\\Gamma)\\) is the set of formulas that follow from \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(T\\) according to \\(\\bL\\). It turns out that \\(T\\) is closed under substitutions if and only if \\(C_{\\bL }^T\\) is substitution-invariant.\n\nIf \\(\\bL\\) is a logic system and \\(\\Gamma , \\Delta\\) are sets of \\(L\\)-formulas,\nwe will use the notation \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta\\) to state that for every \\(\\psi \\in \\Delta ,\n\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\). Thus \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta\\) if\nand only if \\(\\Delta \\subseteq C_{\\bL }(\\Gamma)\\).\nIf \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\) and \\(\\bL' = \\langle L', \\vdash_{\\bL' } \\rangle\\) are logic systems whose languages satisfy that  \\(L'\\subseteq L\\) (hence all the \\(L'\\)-formulas are \\(L\\)-formulas) and   \\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL' } \\phi \\txtiff \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi,\\] for every set of \\(L'\\)-formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every \\(L'\\)-formula \\(\\phi\\) we say that \\(\\bL'\\) is a fragment \\(\\bL\\) (in fact, the \\(\\bL'\\)-fragment) and   that \\(\\bL\\) is an expansion of \\(\\bL'\\).\n3. Some examples of logics\n\nWe present some examples of logic systems that we will refer to in the\ncourse of this essay, that are assembled here for the reader\u2019s\nconvenience. Whenever possible we refer to the corresponding\nentries.\n\nWe use the standard convention of writing \\((\\phi * \\psi)\\) instead of\n\\(* \\phi \\psi\\) for binary connectives and omit the external\nparenthesis in the formulas.\n3.1 Classical propositional logic\n\nWe take the language of Classical propositional logic \\(\\bCPL\\) to be\nthe set \\(L_c = \\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\top , \\bot \\},\\)\nwhere \\(\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow\\) are binary connectives and\n\\(\\top , \\bot\\) propositional constants. We assume that the\nconsequence relation is defined by the usual truth-table method\n\\((\\top\\) is interpreted as true and\n\\(\\bot\\) as false) as follows,\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bCPL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) every truth valuation that\nassigns true to all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\)\nassigns true to \\(\\phi\\).\n\nThe formulas \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\varnothing \\vdash_{\\bCPL } \\phi\\)\nare the tautologies. Note that using the language \\(L_c\\),\nthe negation of a formula \\(\\phi\\) is defined as \\(\\phi \\rightarrow\n\\bot\\). For more information, see the entry on\n classical logic.\n \n3.2 Intuitionistic propositional logic\n\nWe take the language of Intuitionistic propositional logic to be the\nsame as that of classical propositional logic, namely the set\n\\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\top , \\bot \\}\\). The consequence\nrelation is defined by the following Hilbert-style calculus.\nAxioms:\n\nAll the formulas of the forms\n\nC0.\n\\(\\top\\)\nC1.\n \\(\\phi \\rightarrow(\\psi \\rightarrow \\phi)\\)\nC2.\n \\(\\phi \\rightarrow(\\psi \\rightarrow(\\phi \\wedge \\psi))\\)\nC3.\n \\((\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\rightarrow \\phi\\)\nC4.\n \\((\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\rightarrow \\psi\\) \nC5.\n \\(\\phi \\rightarrow(\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\)\nC6.\n \\(\\psi \\rightarrow(\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\)\nC7.\n \\((\\phi \\vee \\psi) \\rightarrow((\\phi \\rightarrow \\delta)\n\\rightarrow((\\psi \\rightarrow \\delta) \\rightarrow \\delta))\\)\nC8.\n \\((\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow((\\phi \\rightarrow(\\psi\n\\rightarrow \\delta)) \\rightarrow(\\phi \\rightarrow \\delta))\\)\nC9.\n \\(\\bot \\rightarrow \\phi\\)\n\nRule of inference \n\n\\[\\phi , \\phi \\rightarrow \\psi / \\psi \\tag{Modus Ponens}\\]\n\n\nFor more information, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic.\n \n3.3 Local Normal Modal logics\nThe language of modal logic we consider here is the set \\(L_m = \\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\neg , \\Box , \\top , \\bot \\}\\) that expands \\(L_c\\) by adding the unary connective \\(\\Box\\). In the standard literature on modal logic a normal modal logic is defined not as a consequence relation but as a set of formulas with certain properties. A normal modal logic is a set \\(\\Lambda\\) of formulas of \\(L_m\\) that contains all the tautologies of the language of classical logic, the formulas of the form \\[\\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow(\\Box \\phi \\rightarrow \\Box \\psi)\\] and is closed under the rules\n\n \n\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\phi , \\phi \\rightarrow \\psi / \\psi \\tag{Modus Ponens}\\\\ \\phi / \\Box \\phi \\tag{Modal Generalization}\\\\ \\phi/ \\bsigma(\\phi), \\textrm{ for every substitution } \\sigma \\tag{Substitution}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nNote that the set \\(\\Lambda\\) is closed under substitution instances,\nnamely for every substitution \\(\\sigma\\), if \\(\\phi \\in L_m\\), then\n\\(\\bsigma(\\phi) \\in L_m\\).\n\nThe least normal modal logic is called \\(K\\) and can be\naxiomatized by the Hilbert-style calculus with axioms the tautologies\nof classical logic and the formulas \\(\\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)\n\\rightarrow(\\Box \\phi \\rightarrow \\Box \\psi)\\), and with rules of\ninference Modus Ponens and Modal Generalization. Note that since we use schemas in the presentation of the axioms, the set of derivable formulas is closed under the Substitution  rule.\n\nWith a normal modal logic \\(\\Lambda\\) it is associated the consequence\nrelation defined by the calculus that takes as axioms all the formulas\nin \\(\\Lambda\\) and as the only rule of inference Modus Ponens. The\nlogic system given by this consequence relation is called the\nlocal consequence of \\(\\Lambda\\). We denote it by\n\\(\\blLambda\\). Its theorems are the elements of \\(\\Lambda\\) and it\nholds that\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\blLambda} \\phi\\txtiff\\phi \\in \\Lambda\\) or there are\n\\(\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\((\\phi_1 \\wedge\n\\ldots \\wedge \\phi_n) \\rightarrow \\phi \\in \\Lambda\\).\n3.4 Global Normal Modal logics\n\nAnother consequence relation is associated naturally with each normal modal\nlogic \\(\\Lambda\\), defined by the calculus that has as axioms\nthe formulas of \\(\\Lambda\\) and as rules of inference Modus Ponens and\nModal Generalization. The logic system given by this consequence\nrelation is called the global consequence of \\(\\Lambda\\) and\nwill be denoted by \\(\\bgLambda\\). It has the same theorems as the\nlocal \\(\\blLambda\\), namely the elements of \\(\\Lambda\\). The\ndifference between \\(\\blLambda\\) and \\(\\bgLambda\\) lies in the\nconsequences they allow to draw from nonempty sets of premises. For example we have \n\\(p \\vdash_{\\bgK} \\Box p\\)  but \\(p \\not\\vdash_{\\blK} \\Box p\\).  This\ndifference has an enormous effect on their algebraic behavior.\n\nFor more information on modal logic, see the entry on\n modal logic.\n The reader can find specific information on modal logics as\nconsequence relations in Kracht 2006.\n3.5 Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials\n\nWe take as the language of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without\nexponentials the set \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , * , 0, 1, \\top\n, \\bot \\}\\), where \\(\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow, *\\) are binary\nconnectives and \\(0, 1,\\top , \\bot\\) propositional constants.

Algebras\n\nThe algebraic study of a particular logic has to provide first of all\nits formal language with an algebraic semantics using a class of\nalgebras whose properties are exploited to understand which properties\nthe logic has. In this section, we present how the formal languages of\npropositional logics are given an algebraic interpretation. In the\nnext section, we address the question of what is an algebraic\nsemantics for a logic system.\n\nWe start by describing the first two steps involved in the algebraic\nstudy of propositional logics. Both are needed in order to endow\npropositional languages with algebraic interpretations. To expound\nthem we will assume knowledge of first-order logic (see the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory)\n and we will call algebraic first-order languages, or simply\nalgebraic languages, the first-order languages with equality\nand without any relational symbols, so that these languages have only\noperation symbols (also called function symbols), if any, in the set\nof their non-logical symbols.\n\nThe two steps we are about to expound can be summarized in the\nslogan:\n\nPropositional formulas are terms.\n\nThe first step consist in looking at the formulas of any\npropositional language \\(L\\) as the terms of the\nalgebraic first-order language with \\(L\\) as its set of\noperation symbols. This means that (i) every connective of \\(L\\)\nof arity \\(n\\) is taken as an\noperation symbol of arity \\(n\\) (thus every 0-ary\nsymbol of \\(L\\) is taken as an individual constant) and\nthat (ii) the propositional formulas of \\(L\\) are taken\nas the terms of this first-order language; in particular the\npropositional variables are the variables of the first-order language.\nFrom this point of view the definition of \\(L\\)-formula\nis exactly the definition of \\(L\\)-term. We will refer\nto the algebraic language with \\(L\\) as its set of\noperation symbols as the \\(L\\)-algebraic\nlanguage.\n\nThe second step is to interpret the propositional formulas in\nthe same manner in which terms of a first-order language are\ninterpreted in a structure. In this way the concept of \\(L\\)-algebra\ncomes into play. On a given set \\(A\\),\nan \\(n\\)-ary connective is\ninterpreted by an \\(n\\)-ary function on \\(A\\)\n(a map that assigns an element of \\(A\\)\nto every sequence \\(\\langle a_1 , \\ldots\n,a_n\\rangle\\) of elements of \\(A)\\). This procedure is a\ngeneralization of the truth-table interpretations of the languages of\nlogic systems like classical logic and \u0141ukasiewicz and\nPost\u2019s finite-valued logics. In those cases, given the set of\ntruth-values at play the function that interprets a connective is\ngiven by its truth-table.\n\nA way to introduce algebras is as the models of some algebraic\nfirst-order language. We follow an equivalent route and give the\ndefinition of algebra using the setting of propositional languages.\nLet \\(L\\) be a propositional language. An\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\) of type \\(L\\), or \\(L\\)-algebra\nfor short, is a set \\(A\\),\ncalled the carrier or the universe of \\(\\bA\\), together with a\nfunction \\(* ^{\\bA}\\) on \\(A\\) of the arity of \\(*\\),\nfor every connective \\(*\\) in \\(L\\) (if \\(*\\) is 0-ary,\n\\(* ^{\\bA}\\) is an element of \\(A)\\). An algebra \\(\\bA\\) is\ntrivial if its carrier is a one element set.\n\nA valuation on an \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\) is a\nmap \\(v\\) from the set of variables into its carrier\n\\(A\\). Algebras together with valuations are used to\ninterpret in a compositional way the formulas of \\(L\\),\nassuming that a connective \\(*\\) of \\(L\\) is\ninterpreted in an \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\) by the function\n\\(* ^{\\bA}\\). Let \\(\\bA\\) be an algebra of type \\(L\\)\nand \\(v\\) a valuation on \\(\\bA\\). The value of a\ncompound formula \\(* \\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n\\) is computed by applying\nthe function \\(* ^{\\bA}\\) that interprets \\(*\\) in \\(\\bA\\) to the\npreviously computed values \\(\\bv(\\phi_1), \\ldots,\\bv(\\phi_n)\\) of the\nformulas \\(\\phi_1,\\ldots,\\phi_n\\). Precisely speaking, the value\n\\(\\bv(\\phi)\\) of a formula \\(\\phi\\) is defined inductively as\nfollows:\n\n\\(\\bv(p) = v(p)\\), for each variable \\(p\\),\n\\(\\bv(\\dagger) = \\dagger^{\\bA}\\), if \\(\\dagger\\) is a 0-ary\nconnective\n\\(\\bv(* \\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n) = * ^{\\bA }(\\bv(\\phi_1), \\ldots\n,\\bv(\\phi_n))\\), if \\(*\\) is a \\(n\\)-ary \\((n \\gt 0)\\)\nconnective.\n\n\nNote that in this way we have obtained a map \\(\\bv\\) from the set of\n\\(L\\)-formulas to the carrier of \\(\\bA\\). It is\nimportant to notice that the value of a formula under a valuation\ndepends only on the propositional variables that actually appear in\nthe formula. Accordingly, if \\(\\phi\\) is a formula, then we use the\nnotation \\(\\phi(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) to indicate that the variables\nthat appear in \\(\\phi\\) are in the list \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n\\), and\ngiven elements \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\) of an algebra \\(\\bA\\) we refer by\n\\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n]\\) to the value of \\(\\phi(p_1 , \\ldots\n,p_n)\\) under any valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\) such that\n\\(v(p_1) = a_1 , \\ldots ,v(p_n) = a_n\\).\n\nA third and fundamental step in the algebraic study\nof logics is to turn the set of formulas of a language \\(L\\)\ninto an algebra, the algebra of formulas of\n\\(L\\), denoted by \\(\\bFm_L\\). This algebra has the set\nof \\(L\\)-formulas as carrier and the operations are\ndefined as follows. For every \\(n\\)-ary connective \\(*\\)\nwith \\(n \\gt 0\\), the function \\(* ^{\\bFm_L}\\) is the\nmap that sends each tuple of formulas \\((\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n)\\)\n(where \\(n\\) is the arity of \\(*\\)) to the formula \\(*\n\\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n\\), and for every 0-ary connective \\(\\dagger ,\n\\dagger^{\\bFm_L}\\) is \\(\\dagger\\). If no confusion is likely we\nsuppress the subindex in \\(\\bFm_L\\) and write \\(\\bFm\\) instead.\n4.1 Some concepts of universal algebra and model theory\n\nAlgebras are a particular type of structure or model. An \\(L\\)-algebra\nis a structure or model for the \\(L\\)-algebraic\nfirst-order language. Therefore the\nconcepts of model theory for the first-order languages apply to them\n(see the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory).\n We need some of these concepts. They are also used in universal\nalgebra, a field that to some extent can be considered the model\ntheory of the algebraic languages. We introduce the definitions of the\nconcepts we need.\n\nGiven an algebra \\(\\bA\\) of type \\(L\\), a\ncongruence of \\(\\bA\\) is an equivalence relation \\(\\theta\\)\non the carrier of \\(\\bA\\) that satisfies for every \\(n\\)-ary\nconnective \\(* \\in L\\) the following\ncompatibility property: for every \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n, b_1 , \\ldots\n,b_n \\in A\\), \n\n\\[ \\textrm{if } a_1\\theta b_1 , \\ldots ,a_n \\theta b_1, \\textrm{ then } *^{\\bA}(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n)\\ \\theta *^{\\bA}(b_1 ,\\ldots ,b_n). \\]\n\n\nGiven a congruence \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\) we can reduce the algebra by\nidentifying the elements which are related by \\(\\theta\\). The algebra\nobtained is the quotient algebra of \\(\\bA\\) modulo\n\\(\\theta\\). It is denoted by \\(\\bA/\\theta\\), its carrier is the set\n\\(A/\\theta\\) of equivalence classes \\([a]\\) of the elements \\(a\\)\nof \\(A\\) modulo the equivalence\nrelation \\(\\theta\\), and the operations are defined as follows:\n\n\\(\\dagger^{\\bA/\\theta} = [\\dagger^{\\bA}]\\), for every 0-ary\nconnective \\(\\dagger\\),\n\\(* ^{\\bA/\\theta}([a_1], \\ldots, [a_n]) = [* ^{\\bA }(a_1 ,\\ldots\n,a_n)]\\), for every connective \\(*\\) whose arity is \\(n\\)\nand \\(n \\gt 0\\).\n\n\nThe compatibility property ensures that the definition is sound.\n\nLet \\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) be \\(L\\)-algebras. A\nhomomorphism \\(h\\) from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) is\na map \\(h\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)\nsuch that for every 0-ary symbol \\(\\dagger \\in L\\)\nand every \\(n\\)-ary connective \\(* \\in L\\)\n\n\\(h(\\dagger^{\\bA }) = \\dagger^{\\bB}\\)\n\\(h(* ^{\\bA }(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n)) = * ^{\\bB }(h(b_1),\\ldots\n,h(b_n))\\), for all \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n \\in A\\).\n\n\nWe say that \\(\\bB\\) is a homomorphic image of \\(\\bA\\) if\nthere is a homomorphism from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) which is an onto map\nfrom \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). An homomorphism\nfrom \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) is an isomorphism if it is a\none-to-one and onto map from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\nIf an isomorphism from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) exists, we\nsay that \\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) are isomorphic and that \\(\\bB\\)\nis an isomorphic image (or a copy) of \\(\\bA\\).\n\nLet \\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) be \\(L\\)-algebras. \\(\\bA\\) is a\nsubalgebra of \\(\\bB\\) if (1) \\(A \\subseteq B\\), (2) the\ninterpretations of the 0-ary symbols of \\(L\\) in\n\\(\\bB\\) belong to \\(A\\) and \\(A\\) is\nclosed under the functions of \\(\\bB\\) that interpret the non 0-ary\nsymbols, and (3) the interpretations of the 0-ary symbols in \\(\\bA\\)\ncoincide with their interpretations in \\(\\bB\\) and the interpretations\non \\(\\bA\\) of the other symbols in \\(L\\) are the\nrestrictions to \\(\\bA\\) of their interpretations in \\(\\bB\\).\n\nWe refer the reader to the entry on\n first-order model theory\n for the notions of direct product (called product there) and\nultraproduct.\n4.2 Varieties and quasivarieties\n\nThe majority of classes of algebras that provide semantics for\npropositional logics are quasivarieties and in most cases varieties.\nThe theory of varieties and quasivarieties is one of the main subjects\nof universal algebra.\n\nAn equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat is definable in a very simple way (by\nequations) using the \\(L\\)-algebraic language. An \\(L\\)-equation\nis a formula \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\)\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are terms of the \\(L\\)-algebraic\nlanguage (that is, \\(L\\)-formulas\nif we take the propositional logic's point of\nview) and '\\(\\approx\\)' is the formal symbol for the equality (always to be interpreted as the identity relation). An equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is valid in an\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\), or \\(\\bA\\) is a model of \\(\\phi \\approx\n\\psi\\), if for every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA,\n\\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\). This is exactly the same as to saying that\nthe universal closure of \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is a sentence true in\n\\(\\bA\\) according to the usual semantics for first-order logic with\nequality. An equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a\nclass of \\(L\\)-algebras which is the class of all the\nmodels of a given set of \\(L\\)-equations.\nA quasi-equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras definable using the \\(L\\)-algebraic language in a slightly more complex way than in equational.classes. A proper \\(L\\)-quasiequation is a formula of the form \\[\\bigwedge_{i \\le n} \\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i \\rightarrow \\phi \\approx \\psi.\\] An \\(L\\)-quasiequation is a formula of the above form but possibly with an empty antecedent, in which case it is just the equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\). Hence, the \\(L\\)-quasiequations are the proper \\(L\\)-quasiequations and the \\(L\\)-equations. An \\(L\\)-quasiequation is valid in an \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\), or the algebra is a model of it, if the universal closure of the quasiequation is sentence true in \\(\\bA\\). A quasi-equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of algebras that is the class of the models of a given set of \\(L\\)-quasiequations. Since equations are quasiequations, every equational class  is quasi-equational. The converse is false. Moreover, since in the trivial algebras all the equations and all the quasiequations of the appropriate algebraic language are valid, equational and  quasi-equational classes are nonempty. \n\nEquational and quasi-equational classes of algebras  can be characterized by the closure\nproperties they enjoy. A nonempty class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nis a variety if  it is closed\nunder subalgebras, direct products, and homomorphic images. It is   a quasivariety  \nif it is closed under subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts,\nisomorphic images, and contains a trivial algebra. It is easily seen that equational classes are varieties and that quasi-equational classes are quasiviarities. Birkhoff's theorem states that all varieties are equational classes and Malcev's theorem that all quasivarieties are quasi-equational classes. \n\n The\nvariety generated by a nonempty class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras\nis the least class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat includes \\(\\bK\\) and is closed under\nsubalgebras, direct products and homomorphic images. It is also the\nclass of the algebras that are models of the equations valid in\n\\(\\bK\\). For example, the variety generated by the algebra of the two\ntruth-values for classical logic is the class of Boolean algebras. If\nwe restrict that algebra to the operations for conjunction and\ndisjunction only, it generates the variety of distributive lattices\nand if we restrict it to the operations for conjunction and\ndisjunction and the interpretations of \\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\), it\ngenerates the variety of bounded distributive lattices.\n The quasivariety\ngenerated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras is the\nleast class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes \\(\\bK\\),\nthe trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products,\nultraproducts, and isomorphic images.\n\nAn SP-class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of\n\\(L\\)-algebras that contains a trivial algebra and is\nclosed under isomorphic images, subalgebras, and direct products. Thus\nquasivarieties and varieties are all SP-classes. The SP-class\ngenerated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras is the\nleast class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes \\(\\bK\\),\nthe trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products\nand isomorphic images.\n5. Algebraic semantics\n\nThe term \u2018algebraic semantics\u2019 was (and many times still\nis) used in the literature in a loose way. To provide a logic with an\nalgebraic semantics was to interpret its language in a class of\nalgebras, define a notion of satisfaction of a formula (under a\nvaluation) in an algebra of the class and prove a soundness and\ncompleteness theorem, usually for the theorems of the logic only.\nNowadays there is a precise concept of algebraic semantics for a logic\nsystem. It was introduced by Blok and Pigozzi in Blok & Pigozzi\n1989. In this concept we find a general way to state in mathematically\nprecise terms what is common to the many cases of purported algebraic\nsemantics for specific logic systems found in the literature. We\nexpose the notion in this section. To motivate the definition we\ndiscuss several examples first, stressing the relevant properties that\nthey share. The reader does not need to know about the classes of\nalgebras that provide algebraic semantics we refer to in the examples.\nIts existence is what is important.\n\nThe prototypical examples of algebraic semantics for propositional\nlogics are the class BA of\n Boolean algebras,\n which is the algebraic semantics for classical logic, and the class\nHA of Heyting algebras, which is the algebraic\nsemantics for\n intuitionistic logic.\n Every Boolean algebra and every Heyting algebra \\(\\bA\\) has a\ngreatest element according to their natural order; this element is\ndenoted usually by \\(1^{\\bA}\\) and interprets the propositional\nconstant symbol \\(\\top\\). It is taken as the distinguished element\nrelative to which the algebraic semantics is given. The algebraic\nsemantics of these two logics works as follows:\n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be classical or intuitionistic logic and let \\(\\bK(\\bL)\\)\nbe the corresponding class of algebras BA or\nHA. It holds that\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi \\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK(\\bL)\\)\nand every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\psi) =\n1^{\\bA}\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma \\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) =\n1^{\\bA}\\).\n\n\nThis is the precise content of the statement that BA\nand HA are an algebraic semantics for classical logic\nand for intuitionistic logic, respectively. The implication from left\nto right in the expression above is an algebraic soundness theorem and\nthe implication from right to left an algebraic completeness\ntheorem.\n\nThere are logics for which an algebraic semantics is provided in the\nliterature in a slightly different way from the one given by the\nschema above. Let us consider the example in\n Section 3.5\n of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials. We denote by\n\\(\\bILsubZ\\) the class of IL-algebras with zero defined in Troelstra\n1992 (but adapted to the language of \\(\\bILL)\\). Each \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bILsubZ\\) is a lattice with extra operations and thus has its lattice\norder \\(\\le^{\\bA}\\). This lattice order has a greatest element which\nwe take as the interpretation of \\(\\top\\). On each one of these\nalgebras \\(\\bA\\) there is a designated element \\(1^{\\bA}\\) (the\ninterpretation of the constant 1) that may be different from the\ngreatest element. It holds:\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bILL } \\phi \\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bILsubZ\\)\nand every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(1^{\\bA }\n\\le^{\\bA } \\bv(\\psi)\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma \\), then \\(1^{\\bA }\n\\le^{\\bA } \\bv(\\phi)\\).\n\n\nIn this case one does not consider only a designated element in every\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\) but a set of designated elements, namely the elements\nof \\(\\bA\\) greater than or equal to \\(1^{\\bA}\\),  to provide the\ndefinition. Let us denote this set by \\(\\tD (\\bA)\\), and notice that\n\\(\\tD (\\bA) = \\{a \\in A: 1^{\\bA } \\wedge^{\\bA} a = 1^{\\bA }\\}\\).\nHence,\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bILL } \\phi \\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bILsubZ\\)\nif \\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq \\tD (\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tD\n(\\bA)\\).\n\nStill there are even more complex situations. One of them is the system \\(\\bR\\) of relevance logic. Consider the class of algebras \\(\\bRal\\) defined in Font & Rodr\u00edguez 1990 (see also Font & Rodr\u00edguez 1994) and denoted there by \u2018\\(\\bR\\)\u2019. Let us consider for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bRal\\) the set \\[\\tE(\\bA) := \\{a \\in A: a \\wedge^{\\bA }(a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a) = a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a\\}.\\] Then \\(\\bRal\\) is said to be an algebraic semantics for \\(\\bR\\) because the following holds:\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bR } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bRal\\) and\nevery valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma]\n\\subseteq \\tE (\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tE (\\bA)\\).\n\n\nThe common pattern in the examples above is that the algebraic\nsemantics is given by\n\na class of algebras \\(\\bK\\),\nin each algebra in \\(\\bK\\) a set of designated elements that plays\nthe role \\(1^{\\bA}\\) (more precisely the set \\(\\{1^{\\bA }\\})\\) plays\nin the cases of classical and intuitionistic logic, and\nthis set of designated elements is definable (in the same manner\non every algebra) by an equation in the sense that it is the set of\nelements of the algebra that satisfy the equation (i.e., its\nsolutions). For BA and HA the\nequation is \\(p \\approx \\top\\). For \\(\\bRal\\) it is \\(p \\rightarrow(p\n\\wedge p) \\approx p \\rightarrow p\\), and for \\(\\bILsubZ\\) it is \\(1\n\\wedge p \\approx 1\\).\n\n\nThe main point in Blok and Pigozzi\u2019s concept of algebraic\nsemantics comes from the realization, mentioned in (3) above, that the\nset of designated elements considered in the algebraic semantics of\nknown logics is in fact the set of solutions of an equation, and that\nwhat practice forced researchers to look for when they tried to obtain\nalgebraic semantics for new logics was in fact, although not\nexplicitly formulated in these terms, an equational way to define\nuniformly in every algebra a set of designated elements in order to\nobtain an algebraic soundness and completeness theorem.\n\nWe are now in a position to expose the mathematically precise concept\nof algebraic semantics. To develop a fruitful and general theory of\nthe algebraization of logics some generalizations beyond the\nwell-known concrete examples have to be made. In the definition of\nalgebraic semantics, one takes the move from a single equation to a\nset of them in the definability condition for the set of designated\nelements.\n\nBefore stating Blok and Pigozzi\u2019s definition we need to\nintroduce a notational convention. Given an algebra \\(\\bA\\) and a set\nof equations \\(\\iEq\\) in one variable, we denote by \\(\\tEq(\\bA)\\) the\nset of elements of \\(\\bA\\) that satisfy all the equations in \\(\\iEq\\).\nThen a logic \\(\\bL\\) is said to have an algebraic semantics\nif there is a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) and a set of equations\n\\(\\iEq\\) in one variable such that\n\n(**)\n \\( \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi \\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\)\nand every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq\n\\iEq(\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tEq(\\bA)\\). \n\n\nIn this situation we say that the class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is an\n\\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\), or that the pair\n\\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) is an algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). If\n\\(\\iEq\\) consists of a single equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\) we will simply say that \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p)\n\\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). In fact,\nBlok and Pigozzi required that \\(\\iEq\\) should be finite in their\ndefinition of algebraic semantics. But it is better to be more\ngeneral. The definition clearly encompasses the situations encountered\nin the examples.\n\nIf \\(\\bK\\) is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for a finitary logic\n\\(\\bL\\) and \\(\\iEq\\) is finite, then the quasivariety generated by\n\\(\\bK\\) is also an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics. The same does not\nhold in general if we consider the generated variety. For this reason,\nit is customary and useful when developing the theory of the\nalgebraization of finitary logics to consider quasivarieties of\nalgebras as algebraic semantics instead of arbitrary subclasses that\ngenerate them. Conversely, if a quasivariety is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic\nsemantics for a finitary \\(\\bL\\) and \\(\\iEq\\) is finite, then so is\nany subclass of the quasivariety that generates it.\n\nIn the best-behaved cases, the typical algebraic semantics of a logic\nis a variety, for instance in all the examples discussed above. But\nthere are cases in which it is not (see Blok & Pigozzi 1989).\n\nA quasivariety can be an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic and\nan \\(\\iEq'\\)-algebraic semantics for another logic (with \\(\\iEq\\) and\n\\(\\iEq'\\) different). For example, due to Glivenko\u2019s theorem\n(see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic)\n the class of Heyting algebras is a \\(\\{\\neg \\neg p \\approx\n1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for classical logic and it is the standard\n\\(\\{p \\approx 1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for intuitionistic logic.\nMoreover, different quasivarieties of algebras can be an\n\\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for the same logic. It is known that\nthere is a quasivariety that properly includes the variety of Boolean\nalgebras that  is also a \\(\\{p \\approx 1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for\nclassical propositional logic. It is also known that for some logics\nwith an algebraic semantics (relative to some set of equations), the\nnatural class of algebras that corresponds to the logic is not an\nalgebraic semantics (for any set of equations) of it. One example\nwhere this situation holds is in the local normal modal logic\n\\(\\blK\\). Finally, there are logics that do not have any algebraic\nsemantics.\n\nThese facts highlight the need for some criteria of the goodness of a\npair \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) to provide a natural algebraic semantics for a\nlogic \\(\\bL\\) when some exists. One such criterion would be that\n\\(\\bL\\) is an algebraizable logic with \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) as an algebraic\nsemantics. Another that \\(\\bK\\) is the natural class of algebras\nassociated with the logic \\(\\bL\\). The notion of the natural class of\nalgebras of a logic system will be discussed in\n Section 8\n and the concept of algebraizable logic in\n Section 9.\n\nThe interested reader can examine Blok & Rebagliato 2003 for a\nstudy devoted to algebraic semantics of logics and Moraschini\nforthcoming for the most recent results on the topic (in this paper\nthere is a proof of the fact that the natural class of algebras of the\nlocal normal modal logic \\(\\blK\\), namely the class of modal algebras,\nis not an algebraic semantics (for any set of equations) for it).\n\nThere is a particular, and important, kind of logics with an algebraic\nsemantics that includes classical and intuitionistic logics. It is the\nclass of the so-called assertional logics. \n\nLet \\(\\bK\\) be a class of algebras in an algebraic language with a\nconstant term for \\(\\bK\\), i.e., a formula \\(\\phi(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\)\nsuch that for every algebra \\(\\bA\\in \\bK\\) and elements \\(a_1 , \\ldots\n,a_n, b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\) of \\(\\bA\\), \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n] =\n\\phi^{\\bA }[b_1 , \\ldots ,b_n]\\), that is, in every algebra in\n\\(\\bK\\), \\(\\phi\\) takes the same value whatever is the way we\ninterpret the variable in \\(\\phi\\) on \\(\\bA\\). We denote this value by\n\\(\\phi^{\\bA}\\). Thus \\(\\phi\\) acts as a constant (relative to the\nalgebras in \\(\\bK\\)) and \\(\\phi^{\\bA}\\) (for \\(\\bA\\in \\bK\\)) can be\ntaken as a designated element.\n\nGiven a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) in an algebraic language with a\nconstant term \\(\\phi\\) for \\(\\bK\\), the assertional logic\n\\(\\bL_{\\bK}^{\\phi}\\) of (\\(\\bK, \\phi\\)) is defined by\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_{\\bK}^{\\phi} } \\phi \\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bK(\\bL)\\) and every valuation v on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\psi) =\n\\phi^{\\bA}\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma \\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) =\n\\phi^{\\bA}\\).\n\n\nA logic system \\(\\bL\\) is assertional when there exists a\nclass of algebras \\(\\bK\\) in the algebraic language of \\(\\bL\\) and a\nconstant term \\(\\phi\\) for \\(\\bK\\) such that \\(\\bL\\) =\n\\(\\bL_{\\bK}^{\\phi}\\).\n\nThe most recent study of assertional logics is Albuquerque et al. 2018.\nWe address the reader to this paper where the classification of the\nassertional logics in the Leibniz and Frege hierarchies of logic\nsystems that we present in later sections is addressed and several\nexamples are discussed.\n6. Logical matrices\n\nIn the last section, we saw that to provide a logic with an algebraic\nsemantics we need in many cases to consider in every algebra a set of\ndesignated elements instead of a single designated one. In the\nexamples we discussed, the set of designated elements was definable in\nthe algebras by one equation. This motivated the definition of\nalgebraic semantics in\n Section 5.\n For many logics, to obtain a semantics similar to an algebraic\nsemantics using the class of algebras naturally associated with them\none needs for every algebra a set of designated elements that cannot\nbe defined using only the equations of the algebraic language or is\nnot even definable by using this language only. As we already\nmentioned, one example where this happens is the local consequence of\nthe normal modal logic \\(K\\). Also, recall that there are logics with no algebraic semantics at all.\n\nTo endow every logic with a semantics of an algebraic kind\none has to consider, at least, algebras together with a set of\ndesignated elements, without any requirement about its definability\nusing the corresponding algebraic language. These pairs are the\nlogical matrices. Tarski defined the general concept of logical matrix\nin the 1920s but the concept was already implicit in previous work by\n\u0141ukasiewicz, Bernays, Post and others, who used truth-tables,\neither in independence proofs or to define logics different from\nclassical logic. A logical matrix is a pair \\(\\langle \\bA, D\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an algebra and \\(D\\) a\nsubset of the universe \\(A\\) of \\(\\bA\\); the elements\nof \\(D\\) are called the designated elements of\nthe matrix and accordingly \\(D\\) is called the set\nof designated elements (and some authors call it the truth\nset of the matrix). Logical matrices were first used as models of\nthe theorems of specific logic systems, for instance in the work of\nMcKinsey and Tarski, and also to define sets of formulas with similar\nproperties to those of the set of theorems of a logic system, namely\nclosure under substitution instances. This was the case of the \\(n\\)-valued\nlogics of \u0141ukasiewicz and of his\ninfinite-valued logic. And it was Tarski who first considered logical\nmatrices as a general tool to define this kind of sets.\n\nThe general theory of logical matrices explained in this entry is due\nmainly to Polish logicians, starting with \u0141o\u015b 1949 and\ncontinuing in \u0141o\u015b & Suszko 1958, building on previous\nwork by Lindenbaum. In \u0141o\u015b and Suszko\u2019s paper matrices\nare used for the first time both as models of logic systems (in our\nsense) and to define systems of these kind.\n\nIn the rest of the section, we present the relevant concepts of the\ntheory of logical matrices using modern terminology.\n\nGiven a logic \\(\\bL\\), a logical matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is\nsaid to be a model of \\(\\bL\\) if wherever \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then every valuation \\(v\\) on\n\\(\\bA\\) that maps the elements of \\(\\Gamma\\) to some designated value\n(i.e., an element of \\(D)\\) also maps \\(\\phi\\) to a designated value.\nWhen \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) it is said that\n\\(D\\) is an \\(\\bL\\)-filter of the algebra\n\\(\\bA\\). The set of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of an algebra \\(\\bA\\) plays a\ncrucial role in the theory of the algebraization of logic systems. We\nwill come to this point later.\n\nA class \\(\\bM\\) of logical matrices is said to be a matrix\nsemantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\) if\n\n(*)\n\\( \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tD\n\\rangle \\in \\bM\\) and every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if\n\\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq D\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in D\\). \n\n\nThe implication from left to right says that \\(\\bL\\) is sound relative\nto \\(\\bM\\), and the other implication says that it is complete. In\nother words, \\(\\bM\\) is a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\) if and only if\nevery matrix in \\(\\bM\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) and moreover for every\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\Gamma \\not\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\)\nthere is a model \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tD \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) in \\(\\bM\\)\nthat witnesses the fact, namely there is a valuation on the model that\nsends the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) to designated elements and \\(\\phi\\)\nto a non-designated one.\n\nLogical matrices are also used to define logics semantically. If \\(\\cM\n= \\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a logical matrix, the relation defined\nby\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\cM } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA\\) if \\(\\bv(\\psi) \\in D\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in\n\\Gamma\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in D\\)\n\n\nis a consequence relation which is substitution-invariant; therefore\n\\(\\langle L, \\vdash_{\\cM } \\rangle\\) is a logic system. Similarly, we\ncan define the logic of a class of matrices \\(\\bM\\) by taking\ncondition (*) as a definition of a consequence relation. In the entry\non\n many-valued logic\n the reader can find several logics defined in this way.\nEvery logic (independently of how it is defined) has a matrix semantics. Moreover, every logic has a matrix semantics whose elements have the property of being reduced in the following sense: A matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is reduced if there are no two different elements of \\(A\\) that behave in the same way. We say that \\(a, b \\in A\\) behave in the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) if for every formula \\(\\phi (q, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) and all elements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) \\[\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D \\txtiff \\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D.\\] Thus \\(a, b \\in A\\) behave differently if there is a formula \\(\\phi(q, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) and elements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) such that one of \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n]\\) and \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n]\\) belongs to \\(D\\) but not both. The relation of behaving in the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a congruence relation of \\(\\bA\\). This relation is known after Blok & Pigozzi 1986, 1989 as the Leibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) and is denoted by \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA }(D)\\). It can be characterized as the greatest congruence relation of \\(\\bA\\) that is compatible with \\(D\\), that is, that does not relate elements in \\(D\\) with elements not in \\(D\\). The concept of Leibniz congruence plays a fundamental role in the general theory of the algebraization of the logic systems developed during the 1980s by Blok and Pigozzi. The reader is referred to Font, Jansana, & Pigozzi 2003 and Czelakowski 2001 for extensive information on the developments around the concept of Leibniz congruence during this period.\n\nEvery matrix \\(\\cM\\) can be turned into a reduced matrix by\nidentifying the elements related by its Leibniz congruence. This\nmatrix is called the reduction of \\(\\cM\\) and is usually\ndenoted by \\(\\cM^*\\). A matrix and its reduction are models of the\nsame logic systems, and since reduced matrices have no redundant\nelements, the classes of reduced matrices that are matrix semantics\nfor logic systems are usually taken as the classes of matrices that\ndeserve study; they are better suited to encoding in algebraic-like\nterms the properties of the logics that have them as their matrix\nsemantics.\n\nThe proof that every logic system has a reduced matrix semantics\n(i.e., a matrix semantics consisting of reduced matrices) is as\nfollows. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a logic system. Consider the matrices\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) over the formula algebra, where \\(T\\)\nis a theory of \\(\\bL\\). These matrices are known as\nthe Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\). It is not difficult to\nsee that the class of those matrices is a matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). Since a matrix and its reduction are models of the same\nlogics, the reductions of the Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\)\nconstitute a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\) too, and indeed a reduced\none. Moreover, any class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) that\nincludes the reduced Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\) is automatically a\ncomplete matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\). In particular, the class of all\nreduced matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is a complete matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). We denote this class by \\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\).\n\nThe above proof can be seen as a generalization of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems\nthat we will discuss in the next section.\n\nThe class of the algebras of the matrices in \\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\) plays a\nprominent role in the theory of the algebraization of logics and it is\ndenoted by \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\). It has been considered for a long time the\nnatural class of algebras that has to be associated with a given logic\n\\(\\bL\\) as its algebraic counterpart. For instance, in the examples\nconsidered above the classes of algebras that were given as algebraic\nsemantics of the different logics (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras,\netc.) are exactly the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the corresponding logic\n\\(\\bL\\). And in fact, the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) coincides with what was\ntaken to be the natural class of algebras for all the logics \\(\\bL\\)\nstudied up to the 1990s. In the 1990s, due to the knowledge acquired\nof several logics not studied before, some authors proposed another\nway to define the class of algebras that has to be counted as the\nalgebraic counterpart to be associated with a given logic \\(\\bL\\). For\nmany logics \\(\\bL\\), it leads exactly to the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) but\nfor others it gives a class that extends it properly. We will discuss\nit in\n Section 8.\n7. The Lindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems\n\nWe now discuss the method that is most commonly used to prove that a\nclass of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\), namely the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method. It is the standard method used to prove that\nthe classes of algebras of the examples mentioned in\n Section 5\n are algebraic semantics for the corresponding logics.\n\nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method contributed in two respects to the\nelaboration of important notions in the theory of the algebraization\nof logics. It underlies Blok and Pigozzi\u2019s notion of\nalgebraizable logic and reflecting on it some ways to define for each\nlogic a class of algebras can be justified as providing a natural\nclass. We will consider this issue in\n Section 8.\n\nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method can be outlined as follows. To prove that\na class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\) first it is\nshown that \\(\\bK\\) gives a sound \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-semantics for \\(\\bL\\), namely that if \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every\nvaluation \\(v\\) in \\(\\bA\\) if the values of the\nformulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) satisfy \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\),\nthen the value of \\(\\phi\\) does too. Secondly, the other direction,\nthat is, the completeness part, is proved by what is properly known as\nthe Lindenbaum-Tarski method. This method uses the theories of \\(\\bL\\)\nto obtain matrices on the algebra of formulas and then reduces these\nmatrices in order to get for each one a matrix whose algebra is in\n\\(\\bK\\) and whose set of designated elements is the set of elements of\nthe algebra that satisfy \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\). We\nproceed to describe the method step by step.\n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be one of the logics discussed in the examples in\n Section 5.\n Let \\(\\bK\\) be the corresponding class of algebras we considered\nthere and let \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) be the equation in\none variable involved in the soundness and completeness theorem. To\nprove the completeness theorem one proceeds as follows. Given any set\nof formulas \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\nThe theory \\(C_{\\bL }(\\Gamma) = \\{\\phi : \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi \\}\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\), which we denote by \\(T\\), is considered and the binary relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) on the set of formulas is defined using the formula \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) as follows: \\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T) \\txtiff \\phi \\leftrightarrow \\psi \\in T.\\]\nIt is shown that \\(\\theta(T)\\) is a congruence relation\non \\(\\bFm_L\\). The set \\([\\phi]\\) of the formulas related to the\nformula \\(\\phi\\) by \\(\\theta(T)\\) is called the equivalence class of\n\\(\\phi\\).\nA new matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\theta(T), T/\\theta(T) \\rangle\\) is obtained by identifying the formulas related by \\(\\theta(T)\\), that is, \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\) is the quotient algebra of \\(\\bFm\\) modulo \\(\\theta(T)\\) and \\(T/\\theta(T)\\) is the set of equivalence classes of the elements of \\(T\\). Recall that the algebraic operations of the quotient algebra are defined by: \\[* ^{\\bFm/\\theta(T) }([\\phi_1],\\ldots ,[\\phi_n]) = [* \\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n ] \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\dagger^{\\bFm/\\theta(T) } = [\\dagger]\\]\nIt is shown that \\(\\theta(T)\\) is a relation compatible with \\(T\\), i.e., that if \\(\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T)\\) and \\(\\phi \\in T\\), then \\(\\psi \\in T\\). This implies that \\[\\phi \\in T \\txtiff [\\phi] \\subseteq T \\txtiff [\\phi] \\in T/\\theta(T).\\]\nIt is proved that the matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\theta(T),\nT/\\theta(T) \\rangle\\) is reduced, that \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\) belongs to\n\\(\\bK\\) and that \\(T/\\theta(T)\\) is the set of elements of\n\\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\) that satisfy the equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\) in \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\).\n\n\nThe proof of the completeness theorem then proceeds as follows.\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n imply that for every formula \\(\\psi , \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) if\nand only if \\([\\psi]\\) satisfies the equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\) in the algebra \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\). Thus, considering\nthe valuation \\(id\\) mapping every variable \\(p\\) to\nits equivalence class \\([p]\\), whose extension \\(\\boldsymbol{id}\\) to\nthe set of all formulas is such that \\(\\boldsymbol{id}(\\phi) =\n[\\phi]\\) for every formula \\(\\phi\\), we have for every formula\n\\(\\psi\\),\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi \\txtiff\\boldsymbol{id}(\\psi)\\) satisfies\nthe equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) in\n\\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\).\n\n\nHence, since by\n (5),\n \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T) \\in \\bK\\), it follows that if \\(\\Gamma\n\\not\\vdash_{\\bL }\\phi\\), then there is an algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\)\n(namely \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T))\\) and a valuation \\(v\\)\n(namely \\(id)\\) such that the elements of \\(\\bv[\\Gamma]\\) satisfy the\nequation on \\(\\bA\\) but \\(\\bv(\\phi)\\) does not.\n\nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method, when successful, shows that the class of\nalgebras \\(\\{\\bFm/\\theta(T): T\\) is a theory of \\(\\bL\\}\\) is a\n\\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\nTherefore it also shows that every class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) which is\n\\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-sound for \\(\\bL\\) and includes\nthe set \\(\\{\\bFm/\\theta(T): T\\) is a theory of \\(\\bL\\}\\) is also a\n\\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\).\n\nLet us make some remarks on the Lindenbaum-Tarski method just\ndescribed. The first is important for the generalizations leading to\nthe classes of algebras associated with a logic. The others, to obtain\nthe conditions in the definition of the concept of algebraizable\nlogic.\n\nConditions\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n imply that \\(\\theta(T)\\) is in fact the Leibniz congruence of\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\).\nWhen the Lindenbaum-Tarski method succeeds, it usually holds that in every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\), the relation defined by the equation \\[\\delta(p \\leftrightarrow q) \\approx \\varepsilon(p \\leftrightarrow q),\\] which is the result of replacing in \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) the letter \\(p\\) by the formula \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) that defines the congruence relation of a theory, is the identity relation on \\(A\\).\nFor every formula \\(\\phi\\), the formulas \\(\\delta(p/\\phi)\n\\leftrightarrow \\varepsilon(p/\\phi)\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are interderivable\nin \\(\\bL\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\delta(p/\\phi) \\leftrightarrow\n\\varepsilon(p/\\phi)\\) and \\(\\delta(p/\\phi) \\leftrightarrow\n\\varepsilon(p/\\phi) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi)\\).\n\n\nThe concept of algebraizable logic introduced by Blok and Pigozzi,\nwhich we will discuss in\n Section 9,\n can be described roughly by saying that a logic \\(\\bL\\) is\nalgebraizable if it has an algebraic semantics \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) such\nthat (1) \\(\\bK\\) is included in the natural class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) associated with \\(\\bL\\) and (2) the fact that \\((\\bK,\n\\iEq)\\) is an algebraic semantics can be proved by using the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized.\n8. The natural class of algebras of a logic system\n\nWe shall now discuss the two definitions that have been considered as\nproviding natural classes of algebras associated with a logic \\(\\bL\\).\nBoth definitions can be seen as arising from an abstraction of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method and we follow this path in introducing them.\nThe common feature of these abstractions is that in them the specific\nway in which the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is defined in the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method is disregarded.\n\nIt has to be remarked that, nonetheless, for many logics both\ndefinitions lead to the same class. The classes obtained from both\ndefinitions have been taken in the algebraic studies of many\nparticular logics (for some logics one, for others the other) as the\nnatural class that deserves to be studied.\n\nWe already encountered the first generalization in\n Section 6\n when we showed that every logic has a reduced matrix semantics. It\nleads to the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\). That its definition is\na generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski method comes from the\nrealization that the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\), associated with an\n\\(\\bL\\)-theory, defined in the different completeness proofs in the\nliterature that use the Lindenbaum-Tarski method is in fact the\nLeibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) and\nthat therefore the matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\theta(T), T/\\theta(T)\n\\rangle\\) is its reduction. As we mentioned in\n Section 6,\n for every logic \\(\\bL\\), every \\(\\bL\\)-sound class of matrices\n\\(\\bM\\) that contains all the matrices \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L\n}(T), T/ \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T) \\rangle\\), where \\(T\\) is\na theory of \\(\\bL\\), is a complete reduced matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). From this perspective the notion of the Leibniz congruence of\na matrix can be taken as a generalization to arbitrary matrices of the\nidea that comes from the Lindenbaum-Tarski procedure of proving\ncompleteness. Following this course of reasoning, the class\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the algebras of the reduced matrix models of a logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is a very natural class of algebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\).\nIt is the class\n\n\\(\\{\\bA/\\bOmega_{\\bA }(F): \\bA\\) is an \\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\)\nis a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\}\\).\n\nThe second way of generalizing the Lindenbaum-Tarski method uses a\ndifferent fact, namely that in the examples discussed in\n Section 3\n the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is also the relation\n\\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined by the condition\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\txtiff & \\forall T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL),\\\\ \n & \\forall p \\in V, \\\\ \n &\\forall \\gamma(p) \\in \\bFm_L (T \\subseteq T' \\Rightarrow (\\gamma(p/\\phi) \\in T' \\Leftrightarrow \\gamma(p/\\psi) \\in T')). \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\) and every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) the relation \\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined in this way is the greatest congruence compatible with all the \\(\\bL\\)-theories that extend \\(T\\). Therefore, it holds that \\[\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T) = \\bigcap_{T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL)^T} \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T'),\\] where \\(\\tTH(\\bL)^T = \\{T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL): T \\subseteq T'\\}\\). The relation \\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) is known as the Suszko congruence of \\(T\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\bL)\\). Suszko defined it \u2014in an equivalent way\u2014 in 1977.\nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\), the notion of the Suszko congruence can be extended to its matrix models. The Suszko congruence of a matrix model \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\bL)\\) is the greatest congruence of \\(\\bA\\) compatible with every \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) that includes \\(D\\), that is, it is the relation given by \\[{\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(D) = \\bigcap_{D' \\in \\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D} \\bOmega_{\\bA}(D')\\] where \\(\\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D = \\{D': D'\\) is a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) and \\(D \\subseteq D'\\}\\). Notice that unlike the intrinsic notion of Leibniz congruence, the Suszko congruence of a matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is not intrinsic to the matrix: it depends in an essential way on the logic under consideration. The theory of the Suszko congruence of matrices has been developed in Czelakowski 2003 and continued in Albuquerque & Font & Jansana 2016.\n\nIn the same manner that the concept of Leibniz congruence leads to the\nconcept of reduced matrix, the notion of Suszko congruence leads to\nthe notion of Suszko-reduced matrix. A matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is\nSuszko-reduced if its Suszko congruence is the identity. Then\nthe class of algebras of the Suszko-reduced matrix models of a logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is another class of algebras that is taken as a natural class\nof algebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\). It is the class \n\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL = \\{\\bA / {\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(F): \\bA\\) is an\n\\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\) is a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of\n\\(\\bA\\}\\).\n\nThis class is nowadays taken in abstract algebraic logic as\nthe natural class of algebras to be associated with \\(\\bL\\)\nand it called its algebraic counterpart.\n\nFor an arbitrary logic \\(\\bL\\), the relation between the classes\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is that \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the closure of\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) under subdirect products, in particular \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\n\\subseteq \\bAlg\\bL\\). In general, the two classes may be different. For\nexample, if \\(\\bL\\) is the \\((\\wedge , \\vee)\\)-fragment of classical\npropositional logic, \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the variety of distributive\nlattices (the class that has been always taken to be the natural class\nof algebras associated with \\(\\bL)\\) while \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is properly\nincluded in it \u2014in fact \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is not a quasivariety.\nNonetheless, for many logics \\(\\bL\\), in particular for the\nalgebraizable and the protoalgebraic ones to be discussed in the next\nsections, and also when \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is a variety, the classes\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) are equal. This fact can explain why\nin the 1980s, before the algebraic study of non-protoalgebraic logics\nwas considered worth to be pursued, the conceptual difference between\nthe two definitions was not needed and, accordingly, it was not\nconsidered (or even discovered).\n9. When a logic is algebraizable and what does this mean?\n\nThe algebraizable logics are purported to be the logics with the\nstrongest possible link with their algebraic counterpart. This\nrequirement demands that the algebraic counterpart of the logic should\nbe an algebraic semantics but requires a more robust connection\nbetween the logic and the algebraic counterpart than that. This more\nrobust connection is present in the best behaved particular logics\nknown. The mathematically precise concept of algebraizable logic\ncharacterizes this type of link. Blok and Pigozzi introduced that\nfundamental concept in Blok & Pigozzi 1989 and its introduction\ncan be considered the starting point of the unification and growth of\nthe field of abstract algebraic logic in the 1980s. Blok and Pigozzi\ndefined the notion of algebraizable logic only for finitary logics.\nLater, Czelakowski and Herrmann generalized it to arbitrary logics and\nalso weakened some conditions in the definition. We present here the\ngeneralized concept.\n\nWe said in\n Section 7\n that, roughly speaking, a logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable when 1) it\nhas an algebraic semantics, i.e., a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) and a\nset of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) such that \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic\nsemantics for \\(\\bL\\), 2) this fact can be proved by using the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized and, moreover, 3) \\(\\bK\n\\subseteq \\bAlg^*\\bL\\). The generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod (as we described it in\n Section 7)\n consists in allowing in step (5) (as already done in the definition\nof algebraic semantics) a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable\ninstead of a single equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) and\nin allowing in a similar manner a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in\nat most two variables to play the role of the formula \\(p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\) in the definition of the congruence of a theory.\nThen, given a theory \\(T\\), the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\),\nwhich has to be the greatest congruence on the formula algebra\ncompatible with \\(T\\) (i.e., the Leibniz congruence of\n\\(T)\\), is defined by \n\n\\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T) \\txtiff \\Delta(p/\\phi , q/\\psi) \\subseteq T.\\]\n\n\nWe need some notational conventions before engaging in the precise\ndefinition of algebraizable logic. Given a set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a formula \\(\\phi\\), let \\(\\iEq(\\phi)\\)\nbe the set of equations obtained by replacing in all the equations in\n\\(\\iEq\\) the variable \\(p\\) by \\(\\phi\\). If \\(\\Gamma\\)\nis a set of formulas, let \n\n\\[\\iEq(\\Gamma) := \\bigcup_{\\phi \\in \\Gamma}\\iEq(\\phi).\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, given a set of formulas in two variables \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\)\nand an equation \\(\\delta \\approx \\varepsilon\\), let \\(\\Delta(\\delta ,\n\\varepsilon)\\) denote the set of formulas obtained by replacing \\(p\\)\nby \\(\\delta\\) and \\(q\\) by\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) in all the formulas in \\(\\Delta\\). Moreover, if\n\\(\\iEq\\) is a set of equations, let \n\n\\[\\Delta(\\iEq) = \\bigcup_{\\delta \\approx \\varepsilon \\in \\iEq} \\Delta(\\delta , \\varepsilon).\\]\n\n\nGiven a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\) in two variables, this set\ndefines on every algebra \\(\\bA\\) a binary relation, namely the set of\npairs \\(\\langle a, b\\rangle\\) of elements of \\(A\\) that\nsatisfy in \\(\\bA\\) all the equations in \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\). In standard\nmodel-theoretic notation, this set is the relation \n\n\\[\\{\\langle a, b \\rangle : a, b \\in A \\textrm{ and } \\bA \\vDash \\iEq(p, q)[a, b]\\}.\\]\n\n\nThe formal definition of algebraizable logic is as follows. A logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if there is a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\), a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables such that\n\n\\(\\bK\\) is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\), namely\n\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and\nevery valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma]\n\\subseteq \\tEq(\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tEq(\\bA)\\).\n \nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\), the relation defined by the\nset of equations in two variables \\(\\iEq(\\Delta(p, q))\\) is the\nidentity relation on \\(A\\).\n\n\nA class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) for which there are sets \\(\\iEq(p)\\) and\n\\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) with these two properties is said to be an\nequivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). The set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta\\) is called a set of equivalence formulas\nand the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) a set of defining\nequations.\n\nThe conditions of the definition imply:\n\n\\(p\\) is inter-derivable in \\(\\bL\\) with the set of formulas \\(\\Delta(\\iEq)\\), that is \\[\\Delta(\\iEq) \\vdash_{\\bL } p \\textrm{ and } p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq).\\]\nFor every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\), the Leibniz congruence of \\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T\\rangle\\) is the relation defined by \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\), namely \\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega_{\\bFm }(T)\\txtiff\\Delta(p/\\phi , q/\\psi) \\subseteq T.\\]\nIf \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Delta '\\) are two sets of\nequivalence formulas, \\(\\Delta \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta '\\) and \\(\\Delta '\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta\\). Similarly, if \\(\\iEq(p)\\) and \\(\\iEq'(p)\\) are\ntwo sets of defining equations, for every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK,\n\\iEq(\\bA) = \\iEq'(\\bA)\\).\nThe class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) also satisfies\nconditions\n (1)\n and\n (2),\n and hence it is an equivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\nMoreover, it is an SP-class and includes every other class of algebras\nthat is an equivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). Accordingly, it\nis called the greatest equivalent algebraic semantics of\n\\(\\bL\\).\nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) there is exactly one\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(F\\) such that the matrix \\(\\langle\n\\bA, F\\rangle\\) is reduced, and this filter is the set \\(\\iEq(\\bA)\\).\nOr, to put it in other terms, the class of reduced matrix models of\n\\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA \\in\n\\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\).\n\n\nBlok and Pigozzi\u2019s definition of algebraizable logic in Blok\n& Pigozzi 1989 was given only for finitary logics and, moreover,\nthey imposed that the sets of defining equations and of equivalence\nformulas should be finite. Today we say that an algebraizable logic is\nfinitely algebraizable if the sets of equivalence formulas\n\\(\\Delta\\) and of defining equations \\(\\iEq\\) can both be taken\nfinite. And we say that a logic is Blok-Pigozzi algebraizable\n(BP-algebraizable) if it is finitary and finitely algebraizable.\n\nIf \\(\\bL\\) is finitary and finitely algebraizable, then \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)\nis not only an SP-class, but a quasivariety and it is the quasivariety\ngenerated by any class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) which is an equivalent\nalgebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\n\nWe have just seen that in algebraizable logics the class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) plays a prominent role. Moreover, in these logics the\nclasses of algebras obtained by the two ways of generalizing the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method coincide, that is, \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL = \\bAlg\\bL\\)\n\u2014this is due to the fact that for any algebraizable logic\n\\(\\bL\\), \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is closed under subdirect products. Hence, for\nevery algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics, whatever\nperspective is taken on the generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod.\n\nConditions\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n of the definition of algebraizable logic (instantiated to\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)) encode the fact that there is a very strong link\nbetween an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\), so that this class of algebras reflects the metalogical\nproperties of \\(\\bL\\) by algebraic properties of \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and\nconversely.\n\nThe definition of algebraizable logic can be stated, equivalently, in terms of\ntranslations between the logic and an equational consequence relation\n\\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) associated with any equivalent algebraic semantics\n\\(\\bK\\) for it \u2014that turns to be the same relation no matter\nwhat equivalent algebraic semantics we choose.\n\nThe equational consequence \\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) of a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\) is defined as follows.\n\n\n\\(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i: i \\in I\\} \\vDash_{\\bK } \\phi \\approx \\psi\n\\txtiff\\)for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\phi_i) = \\bv(\\psi_i)\\), for all\n\\(i \\in I\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\).\n\n\nThe translations needed are given by the set of defining equations and\nthe set of equivalence formulas. A set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one\nvariable defines a translation from formulas to sets of\nequations: each formula is translated into the set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(\\phi).\\) Similarly, a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two\nvariables defines a translation from equations to sets of\nformulas: each equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is translated into\nthe set of formulas \\(\\Delta(\\phi , \\psi)\\).\nCondition (1) in the definition of algebraizable logic can be reformulated as \\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff \\iEq(\\Gamma) \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\phi)\\] and condition (2) as \\[p \\approx q \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\textrm{ and } \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\vDash_{\\bK } p \\approx q.\\]\n\nThese two conditions imply\n\n\\(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i : i \\in I \\} \\vDash_{\\bK }\n\\phi \\approx \\psi \\txtiff \\Delta(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i : i \\in I\\})\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\phi , \\psi)\\)\n\n\nand condition\n (3)\n above is \n\n\\[p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\textrm{ and } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\vdash_{\\bL } p.\\]\n\n\nThus, an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) is faithfully interpreted in the\nequational logic of its equivalent algebraic semantics (condition\n (1))\n by means of the translation of formulas into sets of equations given\nby a set of defining equations, and the equational logic of its\nequivalent algebraic semantics is faithfully interpreted in the logic\n\\(\\bL\\) (condition\n (9))\n by means of the translation of equations into sets of formulas given\nby an equivalence set of formulas. Moreover, both translations are\ninverses of each other (conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3))\n modulo logical equivalence. In this way we see that the link between\n\\(\\bL\\) and its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics is very strong\nand that the properties of \\(\\bL\\) should translate into properties of\nthe associated equational consequence relation. The properties that\nthis relation actually has of course depend on the properties of the\nclass of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\).\n\nGiven an algebraic semantics \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) for a logic \\(\\bL\\), a\nway to stress the difference between it being merely an algebraic\nsemantics and being an algebraic semantics that makes \\(\\bL\\)\nalgebraizable is that the translation of formulas into equations given\nby the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) is invertible in the sense that there\nis a translation, say \\(\\Delta\\), of equations into formulas given by\na set of formulas in two variables that satisfies condition\n (9)\n above, and such that \\(\\iEq\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) provide mutually\ninverses translations (i.e., conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n hold).\n\nThe link between an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its greatest\nequivalent algebraic semantics given by the set of defining equations\nand the set of equivalence formulas allows us to prove a series of\ngeneral theorems that relate the properties of \\(\\bL\\) with the\nproperties of \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). These kinds of theorems are called\nfrequently bridge theorems. We will mention as a sample  three of\nthem.\n\nThe first concerns the deduction theorem. To prove a general theorem\nrelating the existence of a deduction theorem with an algebraic\nproperty requires first that a concept of deduction theorem applicable\nto any logic has to be defined. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if there is a finite set of\nformulas \\(\\Sigma(p, q)\\) such that for every set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and all formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\phi \\} \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\txtiff\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Sigma(\\phi , \\psi).\\]\n\n\nNote that this is a generalization of the standard deduction theorem\n(the direction from left to right in the above expression) and Modus\nPonens (equivalent to the implication from right to left) that several\nlogics have for a connective \\(\\rightarrow\\). In those cases\n\\(\\Sigma(p, q) = \\{p \\rightarrow q\\}\\).\n\nTheorem 1.\n\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if and only if the principal relative\ncongruences of the algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) are equationally\ndefinable.\n\nThe second theorem refers to Craig interpolation. Several notions of\ninterpolation are applicable to arbitrary logics. We consider only one\nof them. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig interpolation property\nfor the consequence relation if whenever \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\) and the set of variables of \\(\\phi\\) has nonempty intersection with the set of variables of formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\), \nthere is a finite set of formulas \\(\\Gamma '\\) whose set of variables is included in the set of variables\nshared by \\(\\phi\\) and the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Gamma '\\) and \\(\\Gamma ' \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\).\n\nTheorem 2.\n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic with the\ndeduction-detachment property. Then \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig\ninterpolation property if and only if \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) has the\namalgamation property.\n\nFinally, the third theorem concerns the Beth definability property.\nThe interested reader can find the definition in Font, Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003.  In the general setting we are in, the property is too involved to state it here.\n\nTheorem 3.\n\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic has the Beth property if\nand only if all the epimorphisms of the category with objects the\nalgebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and morphisms the algebraic homomorphisms are\nsurjective homomorphisms.\n\nOther results relating properties of an algebraizable logic with a\nproperty of its natural class of algebras can be found in Raftery\n2011, 2013. They concern respectively a generalization of the property\nof having the deduction-detachment property and the property that\ngeneralize the inconsistency lemmas of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic. Also an abstract notion of having a theorem like\nGlivenko\u2019s theorem relating classical and intuitionistic logic\nhas been proposed and related to an algebraic property in the case of\nalgebraizable logics in Torrens 2008. More recently Raftery 2016\npresents bridge theorems related to admissible rules and to structural\ncompleteness and L\u00e1vi\u010dka et al. 2021 studies bridge theorems for\nthe property of the weak excluded middle.\n\nFor several classes of algebras that are the equivalent algebraic\nsemantics of some algebraizable logic it has been known for a long\ntime that for every algebra in the class there is an isomorphism\nbetween the lattice of congruences of the algebra and a lattice of\nsubsets of the algebra with important algebraic meaning. For example,\nin Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras these subsets are the lattice\nfilters and in modal algebras they are the lattice filters that are\nclosed under the operation that interprets \\(\\Box\\). In all those\ncases, the sets are exactly the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of the corresponding\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\).\n\nAlgebraizable logics can be characterized by the existence of this\nkind of isomorphism between congruences and logic filters on the\nalgebras of their algebraic counterpart. To spell out this\ncharacterization we need a couple of definitions. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a\nlogic. The Leibniz operator on an algebra \\(\\bA\\) (relative\nto \\(\\bL)\\) is the map from the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) to the set\nof congruences of \\(\\bA\\) that sends every \\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\)\nof \\(\\bA\\) to its Leibniz congruence \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA\n}(D)\\). We say that the Leibniz operator of a logic \\(\\bL\\)\ncommutes with the inverses of homomorphisms between algebras\nin a class \\(\\bK\\) if for every homomorphism \\(h\\) from\nan algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) to an algebra \\(\\bB \\in \\bK\\) and every\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\) of \\(\\bB, h^{-1}[\\bOmega_{\\bB\n}(D)] = \\bOmega_{\\bA }(h^{-1}[D]\\)).\n\nTheorem 4.\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if for every algebra\n\\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) the Leibniz operator commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms between algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and is an\nisomorphism between the set of all \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\), ordered\nby inclusion, and the set of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such\nthat \\(\\bA/\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), ordered also by inclusion.\n\nThe theorem provides a logical explanation of the known isomorphisms\nmentioned above and similar ones for other classes of algebras. For\nexample, the isomorphism between the congruences and the normal\nsubgroups of a group can be explained by the existence of an\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) of which the class of groups is its\ngreatest equivalent algebraic semantics and the normal subgroups of a\ngroup are its \\(\\bL\\)-filters.\n\nA different but related characterization of algebraizable logics is\nthis:\n\nTheorem 5.\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if on the algebra of\nformulas \\(\\bFm_L\\), the map that sends every theory \\(T\\)\nto its Leibniz congruence commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms from \\(\\bFm_L\\) to \\(\\bFm_L\\) and it is an\nisomorphism between the set \\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\) of theories of \\(\\bL\\),\nordered by inclusion, and the set of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of\n\\(\\bFm_L\\) such that \\(\\bFm_L /\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), also ordered by\ninclusion.\n10. A classification of logics\n\nUnfortunately, not every logic is algebraizable. A typical example of a\nnon-algebraizable logic is the local consequence of the normal modal\nlogic \\(K\\). Let us discuss this example.\n\nThe local modal logic \\(\\blK\\) and the corresponding global one\n\\(\\bgK\\) are not only different, but their metalogical properties\ndiffer. For example, \\(\\blK\\) has the deduction-detachment property\nfor \\(\\rightarrow\\): \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\phi \\} \\vdash_{\\blK } \\psi\\txtiff \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\blK } \\phi \\rightarrow \\psi.\\]\n\n\nBut \\(\\bgK\\) does not have the deduction-detachment property (at\nall).\n\nThe logic \\(\\bgK\\) is algebraizable and \\(\\blK\\) is not. The\nequivalent algebraic semantics of \\(\\bgK\\) is the variety \\(\\bMA\\) of\nmodal algebras, the set of equivalence formulas is the set \\(\\{p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) and the set of defining equations is \\(\\{p\n\\approx \\top \\}\\). Interestingly, \\(\\blK\\) and \\(\\bgK\\) have the same\nalgebraic counterpart (i.e., \\(\\bAlg \\blK = \\bAlg \\bgK)\\), namely, the\nvariety of modal algebras.\n\nA lesson to draw from this example is that the algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) of a logic \\(\\bL\\) does not necessarily fully encode the\nproperties of \\(\\bL\\). The class of modal algebras encodes the\nproperties of \\(\\bgK\\) because this logic is algebraizable and\ntherefore the link between \\(\\bgK\\) and \\(\\bAlg \\bgK\\) is as strong as\npossible. But \\(\\bAlg \\blK\\), the class of modal algebras, cannot by\nitself completely encode the properties of \\(\\blK\\).\nWhat causes this difference between \\(\\bgK\\) and \\(\\blK\\) is that the class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\bgK\\) is \\[\\{\\langle \\bA, \\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\rangle : \\bA \\in \\bMA\\},\\] but the class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\blK\\) properly includes this class so that for some algebras \\(\\bA \\in \\bMA\\), in addition to \\(\\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\) there is some other \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) with \\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) reduced. This fact provides a way to show that \\(\\blK\\) can not be algebraizable by showing that the \\(\\blK\\)-filters of the reduced matrices are not equationally definable from the algebras; if they where, then for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg \\blK\\) there would exist exactly one \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such that \\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) is reduced.\n\nNonetheless, we can perform some of the steps of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod in the logic \\(\\blK\\). We can define the Leibniz congruence of\nevery \\(\\blK\\)-theory in a uniform way by using formulas in two\nvariables. But in this particular case the set of formulas has to be\ninfinite. Let \\(\\Delta(p, q) = \\{\\Box^n (p \\leftrightarrow q): n\\) a\nnatural number\\(\\}\\), where for every formula \\(\\phi , \\Box^0\\phi\\) is\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\Box^n\\phi\\) for \\(n \\gt 0\\) is the formula \\(\\phi\\)\nwith a sequence of \\(n\\) boxes in front \\((\\Box\n\\ldots \\Box \\phi)\\). Then, for every \\(\\blK\\)-theory \\(T\\)\nthe relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) defined by\n\n\\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T)\\txtiff \\{\\Box^n (\\phi \\leftrightarrow \\psi): n \\textrm{ a natural number}\\} \\subseteq T\\]\n\n\nis the Leibniz congruence of \\(T\\). In this case, it\nhappens though that there are two different \\(\\blK\\)-theories with the\nsame Leibniz congruence, something that does not hold for\n\\(\\bgK\\).\nThe logics \\(\\bL\\) with the property that there is a set of formulas (possibly infinite) \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables that defines in every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) its Leibniz congruence, that is, that for all \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) it holds \\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega_{\\bFm }(T)\\txtiff \\Delta(\\phi , \\psi) \\subseteq T,\\] are known as the equivalential logics. If \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) is finite, the logic is said to be finitely equivalential. A set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) that defines in every \\(\\bL\\)-theory its Leibniz congruence is called a set of equivalence formulas for \\(\\bL\\). It is clear that every algebraizable logic is equivalential and that every finitely algebraizable logic is finitely equivalential.\n\nThe logic \\(\\blK\\) is, according to the definition, equivalential, and\nit can be shown that it is not finitely equivalential. The local modal\nlogic lS4 is an example of a non-algebraizable logic\nthat is finitely equivalential. A set of equivalence formulas for\nlS4 is \\(\\{\\Box(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\}\\).\n\nA set of equivalence formulas for a logic \\(\\bL\\) should be considered\nas a generalized biconditional, in the sense that collectively the\nformulas in the set have the relevant properties of the biconditional,\nfor example in classical logic, that makes it suitable to define the\nLeibniz congruences of its theories. This comes out very clearly from\nthe following syntactic characterization of the sets of equivalence\nformulas.\n\nTheorem 6.\n\nA set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) of \\(L\\)-formulas is a set of\nequivalence formulas for a logic \\(\\bL\\) if and only if\n\n\n\\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(p, p)\\)\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(p, \\Delta(p, q) \\vdash_{\\bL } q\\)\n\\((\\tS_{\\Delta})\\)\n \\(\\Delta(p, q) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(q, p)\\)\n\\((\\tT_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\Delta(p, q) \\cup \\Delta(q, r) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(p,\nr)\\)\n\\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\)\n\\(\\Delta(p_1, q_1) \\cup \\ldots \\cup \\Delta(p_n, q_n) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\Delta(* p_1 \\ldots p_n, * q_1 \\ldots q_n)\\), for every connective\n\\(*\\) of \\(L\\) of arity \\(n\\) greater that 0.\n\n\n\nThere is some redundancy in the theorem. Conditions \\((\\tS_{\\Delta})\\)\nand \\((\\tT_{\\Delta})\\) follow from \\((\\tR_{\\Delta}),(\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\)\nand \\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\).\n\nEquivalential logics were first considered as a class of logics\ndeserving to be studied in Prucnal & Wro\u0144ski 1974, and they\nwere studied extensively in Czelakowski 1981; see also Czelakowski\n2001.\n\nWe already mentioned that the algebraizable logics are equivalential.\nThe difference between an equivalential logic and an algebraizable one\ncan be seen in the following syntactic characterization of\nalgebraizable logics:\n\nTheorem 7.\n\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if there exists a set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) of \\(L\\)-formulas and a set \\(\\iEq(p)\\) of \\(L\\)-equations such that the conditions \\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\)\u2013\\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\) above hold for \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) and \\[p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\textrm{ and } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\vdash_{\\bL } p.\\]\n\nThe set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in the theorem is then an equivalence set of\nformulas for \\(\\bL\\) and the set \\(\\iEq(p)\\) a set of defining\nequations.\n\nThere are logics that are not equivalential but have the property of\nhaving a set of formulas \\([p \\Rightarrow q]\\) which collectively\nbehave in a very weak sense as the implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) does in\nmany logics. Namely, that has the properties \\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\) and\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\) in the syntactic characterization of a set of\nequivalence formulas, i.e.,\n\n\\((\\tR_{\\Rightarrow})\\) \n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } [p \\Rightarrow p]\\)\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Rightarrow})\\)\n\\(p, [p \\Rightarrow q] \\vdash_{\\bL } q\\)\n\n\nIf a logic is finitary and has a set of formulas with these\nproperties, there is always a finite subset with the same properties.\nThe logics with a set of formulas (finite or not) with properties\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above are called protoalgebraic. Thus, every equivalential\nlogic and every algebraizable logic are protoalgebraic.\n\nProtoalgebraic logics were first studied by Czelakowski, who called\nthem non-pathological, and  slightly later by Blok and Pigozzi in\nBlok & Pigozzi 1986. The label \u2018protoalgebraic logic\u2019\nis due to these last two authors.\n\nThe class of protoalgebraic logics turned out to be the class of\nlogics for which the theory of logical matrices works really well in\nthe sense that many results of universal algebra have counterparts for\nthe classes of reduced matrix models of these logics and many methods\nof universal algebra can be adapted to its study; consequently the\nalgebraic study of protoalgebraic logics using their matrix semantics\nhas been extensively and very fruitfully pursued. But, as we will see,\nsome interesting logics are not protoalgebraic.\n\nAn important characterization of protoalgebraic logics is via the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. The following conditions are\nequivalent:\n\n\\(\\bL\\) is protoalgebraic.\nThe Leibniz operator \\(\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L}\\) is monotone on the set\nof \\(\\bL\\)-theories with respect to the inclusion relation, that is,\nif \\(T \\subseteq T'\\) are \\(\\bL\\)-theories, then \\(\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L\n}(T) \\subseteq \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T')\\).\nFor every algebra \\(\\bA\\), the Leibniz operator \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA}\\)\nis monotone on the set of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) with respect to\nthe inclusion relation.\n\n\nDue to the monotonicity property of the Leibniz operator, for every\nprotoalgebraic logic \\(\\bL\\) the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is\nclosed under subdirect products and therefore it is equal to\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). Hence, for protoalgebraic logics the two ways we\nencountered to associate a class of algebras with a logic produce, as\nwe already mentioned, the same result.\n\nThere are also characterizations of equivalential and finitely\nequivalential logics by the behavior of the Leibniz operator. The\nreader is referred to Czelakowski 2001 and Font & Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003.\n\nIn his Raftery 2006b, Raftery studies Condition 7 in the list of\nproperties of an algebraizable logic we gave just after the\ndefinition. The condition says:\n\n\nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced matrix models of\n\\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA \\in\n\\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), where \\(\\iEq(p)\\) is the set of defining equations for\n\\(\\bL\\).\n\n\nThe logics with a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) with this property,\nnamely such that for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced\nmatrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA\n\\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), are called truth-equational, a name\nintroduced in Raftery 2006b. Some truth-equational logics are\nprotoalgebraic but others are not. We will see later an example of the\nlast ones.\n\nThe protoalgebraic logics that are truth-equational are in fact the\nweakly algebraizable logics studied already in Czelakowski\n& Jansana 2000. Every algebraizable logic is weakly algebraizable.\nIn fact, the algebraizable logics are the equivalential logics that\nare truth-equational. But not every weakly algebraizable logic is\nequivalential. An example is the  logic determined by the\northolattices, namely by the class of the matrices \\(\\langle \\bA, \\{1\\}\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an ortholattice and 1 is its greatest\nelement (see Czelakowski & Jansana 2000 and Malinowski 1990).\n\nThe classes of logics we have considered so far are the main classes\nin what has come to be known as the Leibniz hierarchy because\nits members are classes of logics that can be characterized by the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. We described only the most important\nclasses of logics in the hierarchy. The reader is referred to\nCzelakowski 2001, Font, Jansana & Pigozzi 2003, Font 2016 and\n2022, for more information. In particular, Czelakowski 2001 gathers\nextensively the information on the different classes of the Leibniz\nhierarchy known at the time of its publication and Font 2016 is an\nintroduction to abstract algebraic logic very well suited to learn the\nmost important facts about the Leibniz hierarchy and of abstract\nalgebraic logic in general. \n\nThe relations between the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy considered\nin this entry are summarized in the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure. The Leibniz Hierarchy\n\n\nRecently, the Leibniz hierarchy has been refined in Cintula &\nNoguera 2010, 2016. The idea is to consider instead of a set of\nequivalence formulas \\(\\Delta\\) (that corresponds to the biconditional)\na set of formulas \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) that has several properties of the\nusual conditional \\((\\rightarrow)\\). Among these properties we have \\((\\tR_{\\Rightarrow})\\) and\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Rightarrow})\\) in the definition of protoalgebraic logic. The set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) should be such that its symetrization \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\n\\cup[q\\Rightarrow p]\\) is a set of equivalence formulas. New classes\narise when the set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) has a single element.\nExtensive information can be found in the recent book Cintula &\nNoguera 2021. This book can also be taken as an introduction to\nabstract algebraic logic written from the perspective of the\nimplication. \n11. Replacement principles\n\nTwo classes of logics that are not classes of the Leibniz hierarchy\nhave been extensively studied in abstract algebraic logic. They are\ndefined from a completely different perspective from the one provided\nby the behavior of the Leibniz operator, namely from the perspective\ngiven by the replacement principles a logic might enjoy.\n\nThe strongest replacement principle that a logic system \\(\\bL\\) might\nhave, shared for example by classical logic, intuitionistic logic and\nall its axiomatic extensions, says that for any set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\), any formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi , \\delta\\) and any variable \\(p\\)\n\n\nif \\(\\Gamma , \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) and \\(\\Gamma , \\psi\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then \\(\\Gamma , \\delta(p/\\phi) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\delta(p/\\psi)\\) and \\(\\Gamma , \\delta(p/\\psi) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\delta(p/\\phi)\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(\\delta(p/\\phi)\\) and \\(\\delta(p/\\psi)\\) are the formulas\nobtained by substituting respectively \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) for \\(p\\)\nin \\(\\delta\\). This replacement property is taken by\nsome authors as the formal counterpart of Frege\u2019s principle of\ncompositionality for truth. Logics satisfying this strong replacement\nproperty are called Fregean in Font & Jansana 1996 and\nare thoroughly studied in Czelakowski & Pigozzi 2004a, 2004b.\n\nMany important logics do not satisfy the strong replacement property,\nfor instance almost all the logics (local or global) of the modal\nfamily, but some, like the local consequence relation of a normal\nmodal logic, satisfy a weaker replacement principle: for all formulas\n\\(\\phi , \\psi , \\delta\\),\n\n\nif \\(\\phi \\vdash_{\\bL }\\psi\\) and \\(\\psi \\vdash_{\\bL }\\phi\\), then\n\\(\\delta(p/\\phi) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\delta(p/\\psi)\\) and \\(\\delta(p/\\psi)\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\delta(p/\\phi)\\).\n\n\nA logic satisfying this weaker replacement property is called\nselfextensional by W\u00f3jcicki (e.g., in W\u00f3jcicki\n1969, 1988) and congruential in Humberstone 2005. We will use\nthe first terminology because it seems more common \u2014at least in\nthe abstract algebraic logic literature. It has to be mentioned that\nall fragments of a selfextensional logic are selfextensional and that\nthe analogous fact also holds for Fregean logics. Moreover, the difference\nbetween being selfextensional and being Fregean is not only\nencountered among protoalgebraic logics like the mentioned local\nconsequence relations of normal modal logics, it is also encountered\namong non protoalgebraic logics. The four-valued logic of Belnap and\nDunn (see Font 1997 for information) is selfextensional,\nnon-protoalgebraic, and non-Fregean.\n\nSelfextensional logics have a very good behavior from several points\nof view. Their systematic study started in W\u00f3jcicki 1969 and\nhas  been continued in the context of abstract algebraic logic\nin Font & Jansana 1996; Jansana 2005, 2006; and Jansana &\nPalmigiano 2006.\n\nThere are selfextensional and non-selfextensional logics in any one of\nthe classes of the Leibniz hierarchy and also in the class of\nnon-protoalgebraic logics. These facts show that the perspective that\nleads to the consideration of the classes in the Leibniz hierarchy and\nthe perspective that leads to the definition of the selfextensional\nand the Fregean logics as classes of logics worthy of study as a whole\nare to a large extent different. Nonetheless, one of the trends of\ntoday\u2019s research in abstract algebraic logic is to determine the\ninterplay between the two perspectives and study the classes of logics\nthat arise when crossing both classifications. In fact, there is a\nconnection between the replacement principles and the Suszko\ncongruence (and thus with the Leibniz congruence). A logic \\(\\bL\\)\nsatisfies the strong replacement principle if and only if for every\n\\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) its Suszko congruence is the\ninterderivability relation relative to \\(T\\), namely\nthe relation \\(\\{\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle : T, \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\psi\\) and \\(T, \\psi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi \\}\\). And a logic \\(\\bL\\)\nsatisfies the weak replacement principle if and only if the Suszko\ncongruence of the set of theorems of \\(\\bL\\) is the interderivability\nrelation \\(\\{\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle : \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\)\nand \\(\\psi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi \\}\\).\n\nThe study of logic systems from the perspective of the replacement\nprinciples lead to the so called Frege hierarchy we expound in Section\n14.\n12. Beyond protoalgebraic logics\n\nNot all interesting logics are protoalgebraic. In this section we will\nbriefly discuss four examples of non-protoalgebraic logics: the logic\nof conjunction and disjunction, positive modal logic, the strict\nimplication fragment of \\(\\blK\\) and Visser\u2019s subintuitionistic\nlogic. All of them are selfextensional. In the next section, we will\nexpound the semantics of abstract logics and generalized matrices that\nserves to develop a really general theory of the algebraization of\nlogic systems. As we will see, the perspective changes in an important\nrespect from the perspective taken in logical matrix model theory.\n12.1 The logic of conjunction and disjunction\n\nThis logic is the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\bot , \\top \\}\\)-fragment of\nClassical Propositional Logic. Hence its language is the set\n\\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\top , \\bot \\}\\) and its consequence relation is\ngiven by \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash \\phi\\txtiff\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bCPL} \\phi.\\]\n\n\nIt turns out that it is also the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\bot , \\top\n\\}\\)-fragment of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic. Let us denote it\nby \\(\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\).\n\nThe logic \\(\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is not protoalgebraic but it\nis Fregean. The class of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is\nthe variety of bounded distributive lattices, which is the class of\nalgebras naturally expected to be the associated with \\(\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge\n, \\vee \\}}\\), but the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is\nstrictly included in it. In fact, this last class of algebras is not a\nquasivariety, but still it is good enough to be first-order\ndefinable.\n\nThe logic \\(\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is thus a natural example of a\nlogic where the class of algebras of its reduced matrix models is not\nthe right class of algebras expected to correspond to it (see Font\n& Verd\u00fa 1991 where the logic is studied at length). The\nproperties of this example and its treatment in Font &\nVerd\u00fa 1991 motivated the systematic study in Font & Jansana\n1996 of the kind of models for sentential logics considered in Brown\n& Suszko 1973, namely, abstract logics.\n12.2 Positive Modal Logic\n\nPositive Modal Logic is the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\Box , \\Diamond , \\bot\n, \\top \\}\\)-fragment of the local normal modal logic \\(\\blK\\). We\ndenote it by \\(\\bPML\\). This logic has some interest in Computer\nScience.\n\nThe logic \\(\\bPML\\) is not protoalgebraic, it is not truth-equational,\nit is selfextensional and it is not Fregean. Its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg \\bPML\\) is the class of positive modal algebras introduced by\nDunn in Dunn 1995. The logic is studied in Jansana 2002 from the\nperspective of abstract algebraic logic. The class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg\\bPML\\) is different from \\(\\bAlg^*\\bPML\\).\n12.3 Visser\u2019s subintuitionistic logic\n\nThis logic is the logic in the language of intuitionistic logic that\nhas to the least normal modal logic \\(K\\) the same\nrelation that intuitionistic logic has to the normal modal logic\n\\(S4\\). It was introduced in Visser 1981 (under the name Basic\nPropositional Logic) and has been studied by several authors, such as\nArdeshir, Alizadeh, and Ruitenburg. It is not protoalgebraic, it is\ntruth-equational and it is Fregean (hence also selfextensional).\n12.4 The strict implication fragment of the local modal logic lK\n\nThe strict implication of the language of modal logic is defined using\nthe \\(\\Box\\) operator and the material implication \\(\\rightarrow\\). We\nwill use \\(\\Rightarrow\\) for the strict implication. Its definition is\n\\(\\phi \\Rightarrow \\psi := \\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)\\). The language\nof the logic \\(\\bSilK\\), that we call the strict implication fragment\nof the local modal logic \\(\\blK\\), is the language \\(L = \\{\\wedge ,\n\\vee , \\bot , \\top , \\Rightarrow \\}\\). We can translate the formulas\nof \\(L\\) to formulas of the modal language by\nsystematically replacing in an \\(L\\)-formula \\(\\phi\\)\nevery subformula of the form \\(\\psi \\Rightarrow \\delta\\) by\n\\(\\Box(\\psi \\rightarrow \\delta)\\) and repeating the process until no\nappearance of \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is left. Let us denote by \\(\\phi^*\\) the\ntranslation of \\(\\phi\\) and by \\(\\Gamma^*\\) the set of the\ntranslations of the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\). Then the definition of the\nconsequence relation of \\(\\bSilK\\) is: \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bSilK } \\phi\\txtiff\\Gamma^* \\vdash_{\\blK } \\phi^*.\\]\n\n\nThe logic \\(\\bSilK\\) is not protoalgebraic and is not\ntruth-equational. It is selfextensional but it is not Fregean. Its\nalgebraic counterpart \\(\\bAlg \\bSilK\\) is the class of bounded\ndistributive lattices with a binary operation with the properties of\nthe strict implication of \\(\\blK\\). This class of algebras is\nintroduced and studied in Celani & Jansana 2005, where its members\nare called Weakly Heyting algebras. \\(\\bAlg \\bSilK\\) does not coincide\nwith \\(\\bAlg^* \\bSilK\\).\n\nThe logic \\(\\bSilK\\) belongs, as Visser\u2019s logic, to the family\nof so-called subintuitionistic logics. A reference to look at for\ninformation on these logics is Celani & Jansana 2003.\n\nThe reader can find more information on interesting non-protoalgebaric\nlogics in Albuquerque et alt. 2017. \n13. Abstract logics and generalized matrices\n\nThe logical matrix models of a given logic can be thought of as\nalgebraic generalizations of its theories, more precisely, of its\nLindenbaum matrices. They come from taking a local perspective\ncentered around the theories of the logic considered one by one and\nits analogs the logic filters (also taken one by one). But, as we will\nsee, the properties of a logic depend in general on the global\nbehavior of the set of its theories taken together as a bunch; or\n\u2014to put it otherwise\u2014 on its consequence relation. The\nconsideration of this global behavior introduces a global perspective\non the design of semantics for logic systems. The abstract logics that\nwe are going to define can be seen, in contrast to logical matrices,\nas algebraic generalizations of the logic itself and its extensions.\nThey are the natural objects to consider when one takes the global\nperspective seriously.\n\nLet \\(L\\) be a propositional language. An \\(L\\)-abstract\nlogic is a pair \\(\\cA = \\langle\n\\bA\\), C \\(\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an \\(L\\)-algebra\nand \\(C\\) an abstract consequence operation on \\(A\\).\n\nGiven a logic system \\(\\bL\\), an \\(L\\)-abstract logic\n\\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) if for\nevery set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every formula \\(\\phi\\)\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA, \\bv(\\phi) \\in C(\\bv[\\Gamma])\\).\n\n\nThis definition has an equivalent in terms of the closed sets of \\(C\\):\nan abstract logic \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\)\nis a model of \\(\\bL\\) if and only if for every \\(C\\)-closed\nset \\(X\\) the matrix \\(\\langle\n\\bA, X \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) (i.e., \\(X\\) is\nan \\(\\bL\\)-filter).\n\nThis observation leads to another point of view on abstract logics as\nmodels of a logic system. It transforms them into a collection of\nlogical matrices (given by the closed sets) over the same algebra, or,\nto put it more simply, into a pair \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) where\n\\(\\cB\\) is a collection of subsets of \\(A\\). A\nstructure of this type is called in the literature a generalized\nmatrix (W\u00f3jcicki 1973) and more recently it has been\ncalled an atlas in Dunn & Hardegree 2001. It is said to\nbe a model of a logic system \\(\\bL\\) if for every \\(X \\in \\cB, \\langle\n\\bA, X \\rangle\\) is a matrix model of \\(\\bL\\).\n\nA logic system \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\)\nstraightforwardly provides us with an equivalent abstract logic\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL} } \\rangle\\) and an equivalent\ngeneralized matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm_L,\\tTH(\\bL) \\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\) is the set of \\(C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL}}\\)-closed sets of\nformulas (i.e., the \\(\\bL\\)-theories). We will move freely from one to\nthe other.\n\nThe generalized matrices \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) that correspond\nto abstract logics have the following two properties: \\(A \\in \\cB\\)\nand \\(\\cB\\) is closed under intersections of arbitrary nonempty\nfamilies. A family \\(\\cB\\) of subsets of a set \\(A\\)\nwith these two properties is known as a closed-set system and\nalso as a closure system. There is a dual correspondence\nbetween abstract consequence operations on a set \\(A\\)\nand closed-set systems on \\(A\\). Given an abstract\nconsequence operation \\(C\\) on \\(A\\),\nthe set \\(\\cC_C\\) of \\(C\\)-closed sets is a closed-set\nsystem and given a closed-set system \\(\\cC\\) the operation \\(C_{\\cC}\\)\ndefined by \\(C_{\\cC }(X) = \\bigcap \\{Y \\in \\cC: X \\subseteq Y\\}\\), for\nevery \\(X \\subseteq A\\), is an abstract consequence operation. In\ngeneral, every generalized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) can be\nturned into a closed-set system by adding to \\(\\cB \\cup \\{A\\}\\) the\nintersections of arbitrary nonempty subfamilies, and therefore into an\nabstract logic, which we denote by \\(\\langle \\bA, C_{\\cB }\\rangle\\).\nIn that situation we say that \\(\\cB\\) is a base for\n\\(C_{\\cB}\\). It is obvious that an abstract logic can have more than\none base. Any family of closed sets with the property that every\nclosed set is an intersection of elements of the family is a base. The\nstudy of bases for the closed set system of the theories of a logic\nusually plays an important role in its study. For example, in\nclassical logic an important base for the family of its theories is\nthe family of maximal consistent theories and in intuitionistic logic\nthe family of prime theories. In a similar way, the systematic study\nof bases for generalized matrix models of a logic becomes\nimportant.\n\nIn order to make the exposition smooth we will now move from abstract\nlogics to generalized matrices. Let \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\)\nbe a generalized matrix. There exists the greatest congruence of\n\\(\\bA\\) compatible with all the sets in \\(\\cB\\); it is known as the\nTarski congruence of \\(\\cA\\). We denote it by\n\\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\) and has the following characterization\nusing the Leibniz operator \n\n\\[\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB) = \\bigcap_{X \\in \\cB} \\bOmega_{\\bA }(X).\\]\n\n\nIt can also be characterized by the condition:\n\n\n\\(\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\txtiff\\) for\nevery \\(\\phi(p, q_1 , \\ldots ,q_n)\\), every \\(c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n \\in\nA\\) and all \\(X \\in \\cB\\)\n \n\n\\[\\phi^{\\bA }[a, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n] \\in X \\Leftrightarrow \\phi^{\\bA }[b, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n] \\in X\\]\n\n\nor equivalently by\n\n\n\\(\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\txtiff\\) for\nevery \\(\\phi(p, q_1 , \\ldots ,q_n)\\) and every \\(c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n \\in\nA, C_{\\cB }(\\phi^{\\bA }[a, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n]) = C_{\\cB }(\\phi^{\\bA\n}[b, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n])\\).\n\n\nA generalized matrix is reduced if its Tarski congruence is\nthe identity. Every generalized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\)\ncan be turned into an equivalent reduced one by identifying the\nelements related by its Tarski congruence. The result is the quotient\ngeneralized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA / \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB),\n\\cB/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB) \\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\cB/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB) = \\{X/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB): X\n\\in \\cB\\}\\) and for \\(X \\in \\cB\\), the set \\(X/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA\n}(\\cB)\\) is that of the equivalence classes of the elements of \\(X\\).\n\nThe properties of a logic \\(\\bL\\) depend in general, as we already\nsaid, on the global behavior of the family of its theories. In some\nlogics, this behavior is reflected in the behavior of its set of\ntheorems, as in classical and intuitionistic logic due to the\ndeduction-detachment property, but this is by no means the most\ngeneral situation, as it is witnessed by the example of the local and\nglobal modal logics of the normal modal logic \\(K\\).\nThe two have the same theorems but do not share the same properties.\nRecall that the local logic has the deduction-detachment property but\nthe global one does not. In a similar way, the properties of a logic\nare in general better encoded in an algebraic setting if we\nconsider families of \\(\\bL\\)-filters on the algebras than if we\nconsider a single \\(\\bL\\)-filter as it is done in logical matrices\nmodel theory.\n\nThe generalized matrix models that have naturally attracted most of\nthe attention in the research on the algebraization of logics are the\ngeneralized matrices of the form \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\) is the set of all the\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\). An example of a property of logics encoded\nin the structure of the lattices of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of the \\(L\\)-algebras\nis that for every finitary protoalgebraic\nlogic \\(\\bL, \\bL\\) has the deduction-detachment property if and only\nif for every algebra \\(\\bA\\) the join-subsemilattice of the lattice of\nall \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) that consists of the finitely generated\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters is dually residuated; see Czelakowski 2001.\n\nThe generalized matrices of the form \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) are called the basic full g-models of \\(\\bL\\) (the\nletter \u2018g\u2019 stands for generalized matrix). The interest in\nthese models lead to the consideration of the class of generalized\nmatrix models of a logic \\(\\bL\\) with the property that their quotient\nby their Tarski congruence is a basic full g-model. These generalized\nmatrices (and their corresponding abstract logics) are called full\ng-models. The theory of the full g-models of an arbitrary logic\nis developed in Font & Jansana 1996, where the notions of full\ng-model and basic full g-model are introduced. We will mention some of\nthe main results obtained there.\n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be a logic system.\n\n\\(\\bL\\) is protoalgebraic if and only if for every full\ng-model \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cC \\rangle\\) there exists an \\(\\bL\\)-filter\n\\(F\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such that \\(\\cC = \\{G \\in \\tFi_{\\bL\n}\\bA: F \\subseteq G\\}\\).\nIf \\(\\bL\\) is finitary, \\(\\bL\\) is finitely\nalgebraizable if and only if for every algebra \\(\\bA\\) and every\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(F\\) of \\(\\bA\\), the generalized matrix\n\\(\\langle \\bA, \\{G \\in \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA: F \\subseteq G\\} \\rangle\\) is a\nfull g-model and \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is a quasivariety.\nThe class \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is both the class of algebras of\nthe reduced generalized matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) and the class\n\\(\\{\\bA: \\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA \\rangle\\) is reduced\\(\\}\\).\nFor every algebra \\(\\bA\\) there is an isomorphism\nbetween the family of closed-set systems \\(\\cC\\) on \\(A\\)\nsuch that \\(\\langle\\bA, \\cC\\rangle\\) is a full\ng-model of \\(\\bL\\) and the family of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\)\nsuch that \\(\\bA/\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\). The isomorphism is given by the\nTarski operator that sends a generalized matrix to its Tarski\ncongruence.\n\n\nThe isomorphism\n theorem (4)\n above is a generalization of the isomorphism theorems we encountered\nearlier for algebraizable logics. What is interesting here is that the\ntheorem holds for every logic system. Using\n (2)\n above,\n theorem (4)\n entails the isomorphism theorem for finitary and finitely\nalgebraizable logics. Thus\n theorem (4)\n can be seen as the most general formulation of the mathematical\nlogical phenomena that underlies the isomorphism theorems between the\ncongruences of the algebras in a certain class and some kind of\nsubsets of them we mentioned in\n Section 9.\n\nThe use of generalized matrices and abstract logics as models for\nlogic systems has proved very useful for the study of selfextensional\nlogics in general and more in particular for the study of the\nselfextensional logics that are not protoalgebraic such as the logics\ndiscussed in\n Section 12.\n In particular, they have proved very useful for the study of the\nclass of finitary selfextensional logics with a conjunction and the\nclass of finitary selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment\nproperty for a single term, say \\(p \\rightarrow q\\); the logics in\nthis last class are nevertheless protoalgebraic. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has a\nconjunction if there is a formula in two variables \\(\\phi(p,\nq)\\) such that \n\n\\[\\phi(p, q) \\vdash_{\\bL } p,\\;\\;\\; \\phi(p, q)\\vdash_{\\bL } q, \\;\\;\\; p, q \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi(p, q).\\]\n\n\nThe logics in those two classes have the following property: the\nTarski relation of every full g-model \\(\\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) is\n\\(\\{\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in A \\times A: C(a) = C(b)\\}\\). A way of\nsaying it is to say that for these logics the property that defines\nselfextensionality, namely that the interderivability condition is a\ncongruence, lifts or transfers to every full g-model. The\nselfextensional logics with this property are called fully\nselfextensional. This notion was introduced in Font & Jansana\n1996 under the name \u2018strongly selfextensional\u2019. All the\nnatural selfextensional logics considered up to 1996 are fully\nselfextensional, in particular the logics discussed in\n Section 12,\n but Babyonyshev showed (Babyonyshev 2003) an ad hoc example\nof a selfextensional logic that is not fully selfextensional. A much\nmore natural example discovered later of a selfextensional logic that\nis not fully selfextensional is the fragment of only the negation and\nthe constant \\(\\top\\) of classical logic. \n\nAn interesting result on the finitary logics which are fully\nselfextensional logics with a conjunction or with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term is that their class of\nalgebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is always a variety. It looks surprising that many\nfinitary and finitely algebraizable logics have a variety as its\nequivalent algebraic semantics, when the theory of algebraizable\nlogics allows in general to prove only that the equivalent algebraic\nsemantics of a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic is a\nquasivariety. The result explains this phenomenon for the finitary and\nfinitely algebraizable logics to which it applies. For many other\nfinitary and finitely algebraizable logics to find a convincing\nexplanation is still an open area of research.\n\nEvery abstract logic \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) determines a\nquasi-order (a reflexive and transitive relation) on \\(A\\). It is the\nrelation defined by \\[a \\le_{\\cA } b\\txtiff C(b) \\subseteq C(a)\\txtiff\nb \\in C(a).\\]\n\nThus, \\(a \\le_{\\cA } b\\) if and only if \\(b\\) belongs to every\n\\(C\\)-closed set to which \\(A\\) belongs. For a fully selfextensional\nlogic \\(\\bL\\), this quasi-order turns into a partial order in the\nreduced full g-models, which are in fact the reduced basic full\ng-models, namely, the abstract logics \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) with \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\). Consequently, in a fully\nselfextensional logic \\(\\bL\\) every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\)\ncarries a partial order definable in terms of the family of the\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters. If the logic is fully selfextensional with a\nconjunction this partial order is definable by an equation of the\n\\(L\\)-algebraic language because in this case for every algebra \\(\\bA\n\\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) we have: \\[a \\le b\\txtiff C(b) \\subseteq C(a)\\txtiff\nC(a \\wedge^{\\bA } b) = C(a)\\txtiff a \\wedge^{\\bA } b = a,\\] where\n\\(C\\) is the abstract consequence operation that corresponds to the\nclosed-set system \\(\\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\), and \\(\\wedge^{\\bA}\\) is the\noperation defined on \\(\\bA\\) by the formula that is a conjunction for\nthe logic \\(\\bL\\).\n\nA similar situation holds for fully selfextensional logics with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term, say \\(p \\rightarrow\nq\\), for then for every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) \n\n\\[a \\le b\\txtiff C(b) \\subseteq C(a)\\txtiff C(a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } b) = C(\\varnothing) = C(a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a) \\txtiff \\\\ a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } b = a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a.\\]\n\n\nThese observations lead us to view the finitary fully selfextensional\nlogics \\(\\bL\\) with a conjunction and those with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term as logics definable by\nan order which is definable in the algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) by using\nan equation of the \\(\\bL\\)-algebraic language. Related to this, the\nfollowing result is known.\n\nTheorem 8.\n\nA finitary logic \\(\\bL\\) with a conjunction is fully selfextensional\nif and only if there is a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) such that for\nevery \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) the reduct \\(\\langle A, \\wedge^{\\bA }\\rangle\\)\nis a meet-semilattice and if \\(\\le\\) is the order of the semilattice,\nthen\n\n\n\n\\(\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for all \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bK\\) and every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA \\; \\bv(\\phi_1)\n\\wedge^{\\bA }\\ldots \\wedge^{\\bA } \\bv(\\phi_n) \\le \\bv(\\phi)\\)\n\n\nand\n\n\n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for all \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every\nvaluation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA \\; a \\le \\bv(\\phi)\\), for\nevery \\(a \\in A\\).\n\n\n\nMoreover, in this case the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the\nvariety generated by \\(\\bK\\).\n\nSimilar results can be obtained for the selfextensional logics with\nthe deduction-detachment property for a single term. The reader is\nreferred to Jansana 2006 for a study of the selfextensional logics\nwith conjunction, and to Jansana 2005 for a study of the\nselfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment property for a\nsingle term.\n\nThe class of selfextensional logics with a conjunction includes the\nso-called logics preserving degrees of truth studied in the fields of\nsubstructural logics and of many-valued logics. The reader can look at\nBou et al. 2009 and the references therein. \n14. The Frege hierarchy\n\nA hierarchy of logic systems grounded on the replacement principles\ndiscussed in\n Section 11\n instead of on the behaviour of the Leibniz congruences is also\nconsidered in abstract algebraic logic. It is known as the Frege\nhierarchy. Its classes are those of selfextensional logics, fully\nselfextensional logics, Fregean logics and the class of fully Fregean\nlogics that we define now. \n\nIn the same way as the fully selfextensional logics are the\nselfextensional logic systems that enjoy the property that in every one\nof their full g-models the abstract version of the characteristic\nproperty defining selfextensionally holds, the fully Fregean logics are\nthe Fregean logics that in every one of their full g-models  the abstract\nversion of the characteristic property defining being Fregean holds.\nThe next can be taken as the best understandable definition.\n\nA logic system \\(\\bL\\) is fully Fregean when in every one of\nits basic full g-models \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA \\rangle\\), for\nevery \\(F \\in \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\), the Suszko congruence\n\\({\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(F)\\) coincides with the relation of\nbelonging to the same elements of \\(\\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\) that extend\n\\(F\\). It is easy to see that the fully Fregean logics are Fregean and\nthat they are fully selfextensional. \n\nExamples of fully Fregean logics are classical and intuitionistic\nlogic an also the logic of conjunction and disjunction discussed in\n12.1. The fragment of just the negation and a constant for true of\nclassical logic mentioned before is a Fregean logic that is not fully\nFregean. \n\nWe address the reader to Chapter 7 of Font 2016a for an introduction\nto the main facts of the Frege hierarchy and for examples of logic\nsystems in the families of the Frege hierarchy. A discussion of the\nFrege and Leibniz hierarchies related to assertional logics can be\nfound in Albuquerque et al. 2018 where also several examples of logic\nsystems are discussed and classified.\n\n\n\nFigure. The Frege Hierarchy\n\n\nThe reader can find a discussion of several natural examples of logics\nclassified in the Leibniz and Frege hierarchies in Albuquerque et alt.\n2017. \n15. Extending the setting\n\nThe research on logic systems described in the previous sections has\nbeen extended to encompass other consequence relations that go beyond\npropositional logics, like equational logics and the consequence\nrelations between sequents built from the formulas of a propositional\nlanguage definable using sequent calculi. The interested reader can\nconsult the excellent paper Raftery 2006a.\n\nThis research arose the need for an even more abstract way of\ndeveloping the theory of consequence relations. It has lead to a\nreformulation (in a category-theoretic setting) of the theory of logic\nsystems as explained in this entry. The work has been done mainly by\nG. Voutsadakis in a series of papers, e.g., Voutsadakis 2002.\nVoutsadakis\u2019s approach uses the notion of a pi-institution,\nintroduced by Fiadeiro and Sernadas, as the analog of the logic\nsystems in his category-theoretic setting. Some work in this direction\nis also found in Gil-F\u00e9rez 2006. A different approach to a\ngeneralization of the studies encompassing the work done for logic\nsystems and for sequent calculi is found in Galatos & Tsinakis\n2009; Gil-F\u00e9rez 2011 is also in this line. The work presented\nin these two papers originates in Blok & J\u00f3nsson 2006. The\nGalatos-Tsinakis approach has been recently extended in a way that\nalso encompasses the setting of Voutsadakis in Galatos &\nGil-F\u00e9rez 2017.\n\nAnother recent line of research that extends the framework described\nin this entry develops a theory of algebraization of many-sorted logic\nsystems using instead of the equational consequence relation of the\nnatural class of algebras a many-sorted behavioral equational\nconsequence (a notion coming from computer science) and a weaker\nconcept than algebraizable logic: behaviorally algebraizable logic.\nSee Caleiro, Gon\u00e7alves & Martins 2009.\n",
