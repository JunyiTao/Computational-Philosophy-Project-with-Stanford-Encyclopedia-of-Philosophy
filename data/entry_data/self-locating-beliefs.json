    "main_text": "\n1. The Phenomenon\n\nOur subject is traditionally introduced by means of example. We follow\ntradition:\n\n\nI once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my\ncart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back down the\naisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him\nhe was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail\nbecame thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on\nme. I was the shopper I was trying to catch.\n\nI believed at the outset that the shopper with a torn sack was making\na mess. And I was right. But I didn\u2019t believe that I was making\na mess. That seems to be something I came to believe. And when I came\nto believe that, I stopped following the trail around the counter, and\nrearranged the torn sack in my cart. My change in beliefs seems to\nexplain my change in behavior\u2026.\n\nAt first characterizing the change seems easy. My beliefs changed,\ndidn\u2019t they, in that I came to have a new one, namely, that\nI am making a mess? But things are not so simple. (Perry 1979:\n3)\n\n\nThis case displays a structure common to many canonical examples of\nself-locating belief, which we can use to point toward our subject. As\na first pass: the example describes an agent who is in, or comes to be\nin, a particular doxastic state, where that doxastic state is\ndifficult or impossible to characterize without using indexicals.\n(That is, without using expressions that vary in their denotations in\ndifferent contexts of use, such as \u201cI\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d,\n\u201chere\u201d, etc.) Hence the title of Perry\u2019s paper,\n\u201cThe Problem of the Essential Indexical\u201d (1979).\n\nThe doxastic change that Perry underwent when he realized what was\nhappening, the one that explains his change of behavior, can be aptly\ndescribed (by him, at least), as coming to believe that I am\nmaking a mess. It is not aptly described as coming to believe\nthat the shopper with the torn sugar sack is making a mess. Perry\nalready believed that. Nor (Perry argues) is it aptly described as\ncoming to believe that the F is making a mess, for\nany non-indexical F. For one thing, for any such F\n(the unique bearded man in a blue shirt at Safeway, the author of\n\u201cFrege on Demonstratives\u201d, etc.), we can construct a\nversion of the case in which Perry already believed that the\nF was making a mess, but still persisted in trying to chase\nthe F around the supermarket to tell him that he was making a\nmess. For another thing, it could easily be that everyone else in the\nsupermarket believed that the F was making a mess, and none\nof them displayed the embarrassed cart-rearranging behavior that Perry\ndisplayed after he realized what was happening. So none of those\nbeliefs looks like it explains Perry\u2019s change in behavior. (At\nleast, not by marking off a doxastic state that tends to give\nrise\u2014against a typical background of desires and other\nbeliefs\u2014to that sort of behavior.)\n\nNor is Perry\u2019s doxastic change aptly described as coming to\nbelieve that John Perry is making a mess. For one thing, we can\nbuild a version of the case in which Perry already believed that too,\nbut, not realizing that he was John Perry, still tried to chase John\nPerry around the supermarket to tell him he was making a mess. For\nanother, everybody else in the supermarket could have believed that\nJohn Perry was making a mess, without any of them engaging in that\ndistinctive sort of embarrassed cart-rearranging. So that belief also\ndoesn\u2019t look like it explains Perry\u2019s change in behavior.\n(At least, not by marking off a doxastic state that tends to give\nrise\u2014against a typical background of desires and other\nbeliefs\u2014to that sort of behavior.)\n\nSo descriptions of doxastic states that don\u2019t make use of\nindexical terms\u2014states of believing, e.g., that John Perry\nis making a mess, or that the unique bearded philosopher in\nSafeway is making a mess\u2014don\u2019t seem to capture the\ndoxastic change that occurs when Perry realizes what\u2019s been\nhappening. The sorts of descriptions that do capture that change all\nseem ineliminably indexical\u2014Perry can describe the change as\ncoming to believe that I was making a mess, and we can\ndescribe it as, for example, Perry\u2019s coming to believe that\nhe himself was making a mess.\n\nPerry\u2019s example (among others we\u2019ll soon see) has\nconvinced many philosophers that there is a distinctive category of\ndoxastic states that resist characterization in non-indexical terms.\nOnce one is convinced of this, some questions naturally arise:\nWhat\u2019s the best way to think of these doxastic states? And what\nmarks them off as different from states that are happily\ncharacterized in non-indexical terms?\n\nBefore we move on to more detailed discussion, another classic example\nfrom Perry that helps motivate calling these distinctive doxastic\nstates self-locating beliefs:\n\n\nAn amnesiac, Rudolf Lingens, is lost in the Stanford library. He reads\na number of things in the library, including a biography of himself,\nand a detailed account of the library in which he is lost. He believes\nany Fregean thought you think might help him. He still will not know\nwho he is and where he is, no matter how much knowledge he piles up,\nuntil that moment when he is ready to say,\n\n\nThis place is aisle five, floor six, of Main Library,\nStanford.\n\nI am Rudolf Lingens. (Perry 1977: 21\u201322)\n\n\n\nHere it\u2019s easy to see why the terminology of\nself-location is appealing\u2014Lingens\u2019 problem\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be ignorance about what the world is like.\nIt\u2019s ignorance about his own location within the world. (Another\nmetaphor one finds in the literature: his problem isn\u2019t that he\ndoesn\u2019t know how to draw the map of the world; it\u2019s that\nhe doesn\u2019t know where to place the \u201cyou are here\u201d\narrow on that map.) In many respects, this is a helpful and clarifying\nway to think about the purported special category of belief that\nresists characterization in non-indexical terms: it\u2019s belief\nabout one\u2019s particular location within the world.\n\nYet this way of thinking is misleading in at least one respect: the\nrelevant category of belief is not restricted to beliefs about\none\u2019s geographical or temporal location. If the talk of\n\u201cself-location\u201d is not to be misleading, we have to\nunderstand \u201cself-location\u201d quite broadly\u2014in the\nmessy shopper case, Perry\u2019s problem may be a failure to properly\nself-locate, but it\u2019s not a failure to properly\nspatiotemporally self-locate. When Perry realizes\nwhat\u2019s going on, he locates himself among the (widely\nspatiotemporally dispersed) messy shoppers of the world. Perry\u2019s\nnew belief state is one of self-location in the sense that it locates\nhim in a space of possible individuals, or in a quality space the\ncomponents of which aren\u2019t restricted to things having to do\nwith spatiotemporal position.\n\nDavid Lewis calls the same phenomenon \u201cbelief de\nse\u201d\u2014about the self. This avoids misunderstanding the\nphenomenon as having primarily to do with spatiotemporal location, at\nthe expense of introducing some novel and potentially disconcerting\ntechnical terminology, and perhaps obscuring the respects in which\ntalk about self-location is genuinely helpful for getting a grip on\nthe phenomenon.\n2. Arguments and Examples\n\nThis section describes some paradigmatic examples motivating a\ndistinctive category of self-locating belief, and disentangles the\nargumentative threads those examples support. The self-locating belief\nliterature is heavily driven by a cluster of evocative examples. The\ndistinctive category of self-locating belief, and the various\nproposals for how to theorize about it, are often motivated by the\nfelicitous treatment they offer of these examples. But it\u2019s not\nalways clear exactly what argumentative work the examples are doing,\nand which examples are driving which arguments. This section charts\nthe argumentative landscape by working through a dialectic\nthat\u2019s a bit artificial, but we think useful for seeing how the\npieces fit together.\n2.1 A dialectic-structuring device\n\nIn 1979, David Lewis and John Perry each offered arguments for a\ndistinctive category of self-locating belief (Lewis 1979; Perry 1979).\nTo understand the argumentative landscape, it\u2019s useful to think\nof both Lewis and Perry as first arguing that a particular theory of\nbelief is inadequate, and then offering different remedies for its\ninadequacies. We\u2019ll call that initial theory of belief the\n\u201cSimple Picture\u201d, then characterize rival theories in\nterms of how they supplement the Simple Picture to remedy the problems\nLewis and Perry identified.\n\nOn the Simple Picture, belief is a binary relation between subjects\nand possible-worlds propositions (or something like them\u2014more on\nthis in a moment), and the interesting and theoretically important\ndoxastic states of believers are states of believing\nP for possible-worlds propositions P. (So, in\nparticular, all the states required to fully account for what\u2019s\nhappening with people doxastically, to explain people\u2019s doxastic\nsimilarities and differences, and to give explanations of\npeople\u2019s behavior in terms of their doxastic states, will be\nstates of believing P for propositions P,\nwith propositions understood as sets of possible worlds.)\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good characterization of the view that Lewis\nwanted to demonstrate was inadequate, but we need to generalize a bit\nto bring Lewis and Perry under the same umbrella. Although\npossible-worlds propositions were Lewis\u2019s specific concern, the\nSimple Picture needn\u2019t work with possible worlds propositions in\nparticular\u2014it can operate with any type of proposition in a\nbroader category we\u2019ll call traditional propositions.\nTraditional propositions determine a possible-worlds truth condition.\nSo they take truth-values relative to worlds. And importantly for our\npurposes, they don\u2019t take truth-values relative to anything more\nfine-grained than worlds. So we\u2019ll never get two worldmates\nstanding in the belief relation to the same traditional proposition,\none thereby believing truly and the other thereby believing falsely.\nOn the Simple Picture, objects of belief represent ways for the world\nto be\u2014they impose representational demands on the world, and are\nanswerable to the world for their truth or falsity. Possible worlds\npropositions are, obviously, like this. So too are standard Russellian\nstructured propositions, constructed out of objects and properties.\n(The Russellian proposition constructed in the usual way from\nAristotle and wisdom is true in all and only the worlds in\nwhich Aristotle is wise.)\n\nWe can summarize the Simple Picture as follows:\n\n\nThe Simple Picture:\n\nBelief is a binary relation between believers and objects of\nbelief.\nThe objects of belief are traditional propositions.\n\n\n\nIn 1979, John Perry and David Lewis produced examples purporting to\nshow that this simple way of theorizing about belief was inadequate,\nbecause the family of doxastic states at its disposal\u2014states of\nbelieving that P for traditional propositions\nP\u2014couldn\u2019t explain some bits of behavior that it\u2019s\nimportant to be able to explain in doxastic terms, couldn\u2019t\ncapture certain sorts of ignorance and doxastic change, and/or\ncouldn\u2019t properly categorize believers so as to capture\nimportant doxastic similarities and differences between them.\n\nThinking about the dialectical situation this way helps frame the\nrelevant arguments and examples in terms of problems they raise for\nthe Simple Picture. We can then differentiate the various theories of\nself-locating belief by how they supplement the Simple Picture to\nremedy those problems.\n\nTo guard against historical misunderstanding, we note that not\neverybody endorsed the Simple Picture in the beginning of 1979, and\nthere were already examples and arguments in the literature making\ntrouble for the Simple Picture, on similar sorts of grounds, before\nPerry\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s 1979 papers (see for example\nCasta\u00f1eda 1966, 1967; Frege 1956; Wittgenstein 1953; Anscombe\n1975). But thinking in terms of problems for, and modifications of,\nthe Simple Picture is helpful for understanding the argumentative\nlandscape.\n2.2 Arguments from ignorance\n\nWe return to Perry\u2019s example of the messy shopper.\n\nPerry explains his change in behavior by saying \u201cI came to\nbelieve that I was making a mess\u201d. As Perry frames the problem,\nno substitution for \u201cI\u201d in the reported belief\n(\u201cthat I was making a mess\u201d) will preserve the explanatory\npower of the belief attribution. Descriptive substitutions won\u2019t\nwork, nor will \u201cI came to believe John Perry was making a\nmess\u201d. What\u2019s reported isn\u2019t a belief in any of the\nfamiliar, tractable, Simple-Picture-friendly categories: it\u2019s\nnot a descriptive belief about the F, and it\u2019s not a\nde re belief about a particular individual. So we need\nsomething additional to capture the doxastic state Perry reports\nhimself as coming to be in when he says \u201cI came to believe that\nI was making a mess\u201d.\n\nThere are two central argumentative threads at work here:\n\nAn argument from ignorance: In the early parts of the\nstory, Perry manifests a sort of ignorance, which drives his behavior.\nBut it\u2019s not (Perry argues) ignorance of any ordinary\ndescriptive or de re proposition. It\u2019s a kind of\nignorance that could survive coming to have all the relevant\ndescriptive beliefs, and all the relevant de re beliefs.\nPerry\u2019s ignorance is a distinctively first-personal,\nself-locating kind of ignorance. That is: The doxastic state that\nPerry\u2019s missing\u2014the one whose absence constitutes his\nignorance\u2014isn\u2019t of the kind that appears in the Simple\nPicture. It\u2019s not a state of believing P for\nany traditional proposition P. So in order to characterize\nPerry\u2019s ignorance, we need more resources than the Simple\nPicture gives us.\nAn argument from difference: When Perry has his\na-ha moment, he undergoes an important doxastic\nchange\u2014one that disposes him to very different sorts of\nbehavior. So there\u2019s an important doxastic difference between\npre-a-ha and post-a-ha Perry. But it\u2019s not\n(Perry argues) a difference in which states of ordinary descriptive or\nde re belief Perry was in at the two times. It\u2019s a\ndifference in belief states of a distinctively first-personal,\nself-locating kind. That is: the change that Perry undergoes\nisn\u2019t one that we can characterize in the Simple Picture.\nThere\u2019s no (relevant) difference in which traditional\npropositions Perry believed before and after his a-ha moment.\nSo in order to characterize the doxastic difference between pre- and\npost-a-ha Perry, we need more resources than the Simple\nPicture gives us.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll pick up these threads in turn, and look at other prominent\nexamples pushing similar lines of argument. In this section, we take\nup arguments from ignorance. Arguments from difference will be\ndiscussed in\n section 2.3.\n\nArguments from ignorance get a lot of attention in debates about\nself-locating belief. They have the same general form as the knowledge\nargument against materialism in the philosophy of mind (Jackson 1982,\n1986): we build a case in which a subject is stipulated to have all of\nthe K-type knowledge there is to have, elicit the intuition\nthat they still display a particular sort of ignorance, and conclude\nthat not all knowledge is of type K. It\u2019s easy to see\nthe messy shopper case contributing to this sort of argument: We build\na version of the messy shopper case in which Perry, before his\nepiphany, is already in all the relevant states of de re\nbelief, and all the relevant states of descriptive belief, but still\nhas something to learn. We conclude that there are some states of\nbelief of a distinctively self-locating (\u201cessentially\nindexical\u201d) kind, that aren\u2019t states of de re or\ndescriptive belief. Perry already believes all of the relevant\ntraditional propositions, so there must be states of belief that\naren\u2019t states of believing P for some\ntraditional proposition P.\n\nWhile the messy shopper example contains both of the argumentative\nthreads we identified above, another famous example offers a\nrelatively pure argument from ignorance. This is Lewis\u2019 (1979)\nexample of the two gods. (Note that in what follows, Lewis uses\n\u201cpropositional attitude\u201d to mean an attitude toward a\npossible-worlds proposition, and \u201cproposition\u201d so that it\napplies only to possible-worlds propositions.)\n\n\nLewis\u2019s two gods\n\nConsider the case of the two gods. They inhabit a certain possible\nworld, and they know exactly which world it is. Therefore they know\nevery proposition that is true at their world. Insofar as knowledge is\na propositional attitude, they are omniscient. Still I can imagine\nthem to suffer ignorance: neither one knows which of the two he is.\nThey are not exactly alike. One lives on top of the tallest mountain\nand throws down manna; the other lives on top of the coldest mountain\nand throws down thunderbolts. Neither one knows whether he lives on\nthe tallest mountain or on the coldest mountain; nor whether he throws\nmanna or thunderbolts. Surely their predicament is possible. (The\ntrouble might perhaps be that they have an equally perfect view of\nevery part of their world, and hence cannot identify the perspectives\nfrom which they view it.) But if it is possible to lack knowledge and\nnot lack any propositional knowledge, then the lacked knowledge must\nnot be propositional. If the gods came to know which was which, they\nwould know more than they do. But they wouldn\u2019t know more\npropositions. There are no more to know. (Lewis 1979:\n520\u2013521)\n\n\nThe load-bearing phenomenon here is a kind of ignorance that survives\nknowledge of all true traditional propositions. By stipulation, the\ngods know all the true traditional propositions, and thus are in the\nstate of believing P for all traditional\npropositions P. Yet each is still ignorant of something. Thus\nthere must be some kind of knowledge whose doxastic component is not\nbeing in a state of believing a traditional proposition.\n\nHere is the general form of the argument, expressed abstractly enough\nthat Lewis and Perry could both endorse it:\n\nAn adequate account of belief will include, for each of the two\ngods, a state that they are not in, such that their failure to be in\nit is a kind of ignorance.\nThere aren\u2019t any states of believing P,\nfor traditional propositions P, that the two gods\naren\u2019t in, such that their not being in them is a kind of\nignorance. (They believe all the ones that are true in their world,\nand not believing the false ones isn\u2019t a kind of\nignorance.)\nSo, the Simple Picture of belief isn\u2019t adequate. To\ncharacterize the gods\u2019 ignorance, we\u2019ll need to refer to\nsome doxastic states that aren\u2019t just states of believing\nP for traditional propositions P.\n\n\nLewis and Perry offer different diagnoses of what\u2019s gone wrong\nwith the Simple Picture, and recommend different remedies. But they\nagree on the Simple Picture\u2019s inability to account for these\nsorts of cases.\n\nThere are a number of other arguments from ignorance in the\nliterature\u2014for example, the case of Rudolph Lingens in the\nStanford library (Perry 1977), which we discussed briefly in\n section 1,\n and the case of the lost hiker in the Desolation Wilderness (Perry\n1979). They are worth noting because they are in some respects less\nodd and science-fictional than the case of the two gods, but we will\nnot take them up in detail because their load-bearing structural\nfeatures are the same.\n2.3 Arguments from difference\n\nAnother major thread of argument for a theoretically distinctive\ncategory of self-locating belief maintains that there are important\ndoxastic similarities and differences between agents that are\ndifficult to characterize without that distinctive category.\nIntroducing such a category provides the resources to characterize\nthose similarities and differences in a theoretically helpful way. We\nwill focus on difference-based arguments in this subsection, then take\nup similarities in the next.\n\nIn the messy shopper example, there\u2019s an important doxastic\ndifference between Perry before his a-ha moment and Perry\nafter his a-ha moment. But that difference isn\u2019t (Perry\nargues) a difference in which descriptive or de re\npropositions Perry believes. So we need some extra theoretical\nresources, beyond states of believing P for\ntraditional propositions P, to characterize the doxastic\nchange Perry undergoes in his a-ha moment.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that the messy shopper example has both an\nignorance thread and a difference thread. Typically, where\nthere\u2019s an argument from ignorance, there\u2019s an argument\nfrom difference\u2014the pre- and post-discovery stages in a case of\nresolved ignorance will be importantly doxastically\ndifferent. And even when the ignorance isn\u2019t resolved, there\nwill be in the background a relevant doxastic difference between the\nsubject in the case as described and the subject as they would be if\nthe ignorance were resolved.\n\nYet where there\u2019s an argument from difference, there need not be\nan argument from ignorance. We can illustrate this with another famous\nexample from Perry of two hikers, one of whom is attacked by a bear\n(Perry 1977: 23). Let\u2019s call the hikers John and David, and\nlet\u2019s suppose that it\u2019s John who is attacked while David\nlooks on.\n\nJohn and David both believe that John is being attacked by a\nbear. But they display, Perry notes, very different behavior:\nJohn curls up into a ball; David runs for help. It\u2019s very\nplausible to attribute this difference in behavior to a doxastic\ndifference between them. (A difference that makes it appropriate, for\nexample, to say that John, but not David, believes that he\nhimself is being attacked by a bear.) But the doxastic difference\nisn\u2019t a difference in traditional propositions\nbelieved\u2014certainly it isn\u2019t a difference in\npossible-worlds propositions believed, or in descriptive or de\nre structured propositions believed. John and David are on\nexactly the same page about the relevant aspects of the\nworld\u2014it\u2019s a world in which John is being attacked by a\nbear, and David isn\u2019t. They are on exactly the same page about\nwhich relevant descriptive and de re structured propositions\nare true\u2014it\u2019s true that the prominent advocate of\nself-locating belief from Stanford is being attacked by a bear, while\nthe prominent advocate of self-locating belief from Princeton is not,\nthat John is being attacked and David is not, etc.\n\nHere then is the general form of a difference argument centered around\nsome case, which we\u2019ll call \u2018CASE\u2019:\n\nThere is an important doxastic difference between A and\nB in CASE.\nIn CASE, A and B are alike with respect to all\nof the potentially relevant states of believing P\nfor traditional propositions P.\nSo, there are some important doxastic states that are not states\nof believing P for traditional propositions\nP, such that differences in those kinds of states can explain\nthe doxastic difference between A and B in\nCASE.\n\n\nWhile ignorance arguments often need to become quite odd and\nscience-fictional, difference arguments don\u2019t. Here is why: The\nmost obvious strategy for responding to both sorts of arguments is to\nidentify some piece of Simple Picture-friendly information that would\nresolve the ignorance, or mark the doxastic difference. In ignorance\ncases, this strategy can initially look very promising. If Lingens\nthinks of himself as the unique bearded man in a plaid shirt reading a\nbiography of Rudolph Lingens, then learning the Simple\nPicture-friendly information that the bearded man in a plaid shirt\nreading a biography of Rudolph Lingens is in the Stanford library will\nresolve his ignorance. So to keep Simple Picture-friendly information\nfrom resolving Lingens\u2019 ignorance, we need to make sure Lingens\ndoesn\u2019t think that he\u2019s the unique bearded man in a plaid\nshirt reading a biography of Rudolph Lingens. He needs to think\nthat\u2014or at least, leave open the possibility\nthat\u2014there\u2019s another bearded man in a plaid shirt reading\na biography of Lingens somewhere. More generally, there needs to be\nno unique Simple Picture-friendly description of himself\navailable to Lingens, because any such description would allow some\nSimple Picture-friendly information to resolve his ignorance.\nSimilarly for de re belief\u2014the subjects of ignorance\ncases mustn\u2019t be in a position to uniquely identify themselves\nde re.\n\nThat\u2019s why ignorance argument cases wind up involving things\nlike mirror-image universes with qualitatively indistinguishable\n\u201csides\u201d, pairs of amnesiacs undergoing identical courses\nof subjective experience, pairs of gods with unusual perspectives on\nthe world, and so on.\n\nThose are peculiar, highly science-fictional cases. In more ordinary\ncases, believers have access to a description that they take to apply\nuniquely to themselves, even if it\u2019s quite complex and difficult\nto state concisely. To preserve the case, and make sure that\nno Simple Picture-friendly information can help, the case\nneeds to get very weird. And it\u2019s natural to worry about whether\nintuitions about such cases are good bases for theory choice.\n\nOf course advocates for a special category of self-locating-belief\nwill say that this response misses the point. The de re\nproposition about Lingens, or the descriptive proposition about the\nunique bearded, plaid-shirt-wearing biography reader, can only help\nresolve Lingens\u2019 ignorance if we assume Lingens\u2019\nself-locating belief that he himself is Lingens, or that\nhe himself is the unique F. And there is something to\nthis. But now the dialectical ground has shifted. Rather than offering\nan example about which we have clear\u2014and clearly Simple\nPicture-unfriendly\u2014intuitions, the advocate for a special\ncategory of self-locating belief simply insists on their theory. The\nforce of the argument is diminished.\n\nFor advocates of self-locating belief, difference arguments have the\nadvantage of working with cases that aren\u2019t so strange and\nscience-fictional. Cases in which two subjects have all the same\nSimple Picture-friendly beliefs, yet respond very differently to their\nenvironments, needn\u2019t be especially peculiar\u2014their only\npeculiarity is in the unlikely degree of shared belief. And cases in\nwhich subjects have all the same relevant Simple\nPicture-friendly beliefs, so that differences in subjects\u2019\nSimple Picture-friendly beliefs don\u2019t explain the differences in\nhow they respond to their environments, are not peculiar at all. They\nare actual, and common. (Other examples from the literature include\nPerry\u2019s case of the lost hiker [1979: 4] and Kaplan\u2019s\nburning pants case [1989: 537], which also features prominently in\nChierchia 1989: 2\u20133.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth pausing on Perry\u2019s case of a professor waiting\nfor a faculty meeting to start, as this case extends the issue about\nself-location to temporal self-location:\n\n\na professor, who desires to attend the department meeting on time, and\nbelieves correctly that it begins at noon, sits motionless in his\noffice at that time. Suddenly he begins to move. What explains his\naction? A change in belief. He believed all along that the department\nmeeting starts at noon; he came to believe, as he would have put it,\nthat it starts now. (Perry 1979: 4)\n\n\nThis is a temporal difference case: there\u2019s an important\ndoxastic difference between the professor when he\u2019s sitting\nmotionless in his office, thinking to himself \u201cthe meeting\nbegins at noon\u201d, and the professor when he starts to move,\nthinking to himself, \u201cthe meeting begins now\u201d. But the\ndifference isn\u2019t in traditional propositions believed\u2014the\nprofessor believes, both before and after he begins to move, that the\nmeeting begins at noon, at the time when the clock strikes twelve\ntimes, etc. Characterizing the difference requires resources beyond\nthose of the Simple Picture.\n2.4 Arguments from sameness\n\nThere is also a tradition\u2014a bit less frequent in the\nliterature\u2014of cases involving cognitive similarity that\nare purportedly best captured by a distinctive category of\nself-locating belief. (Though see Perry 2019\u2019s discussion of\nwhat he calls \u201cType A\u201d cases.) A prominent example:\n\n\nHume and Heimson\n\nLet us imagine David Hume, alone in his study, on a particular\nafternoon in 1775, thinking to himself, \u201cI wrote the\nTreatise\u201d. Can anyone else apprehend the thought he\napprehended by thinking this? First note that what he thinks is true.\nSo no one could apprehend the same thought, unless they apprehended a\ntrue thought. Now suppose Heimson is a bit crazy and thinks himself to\nbe David Hume. Alone in his study, he says to himself, \u201cI wrote\nthe Treatise\u201d. However much his inner life may, at that\nmoment, resemble Hume\u2019s on that afternoon in 1775, the fact\nremains: Hume was right, Heimson is wrong. Heimson cannot think the\nvery thought to himself that Hume thought to himself, by using the\nvery same sentence. (Perry 1977: 17)\n\n\nLet us step back from some of the particular commitments in\nPerry\u2019s presentation of the case to extract an argument that\nboth Perry and Lewis could endorse: There\u2019s something\ntheoretically and explanatorily important that Hume and Heimson have\nin common. But it\u2019s not a state of believing P\nfor any traditional proposition P. (If it was, either both\nwould be correct in their belief or neither would.) To capture this\ndoxastic similarity, we need resources beyond those provided by the\nSimple Picture. We need states of distinctively self-locating\nbelief.\n\nThe Hume/Heimson case is a bit odd, since Heimson\u2019s belief is a\nbit odd. But more mundane examples are ubiquitous. One occurs a bit\nlater in Perry 1977: there is something doxastically in common to all\nof the (well-informed) residents of Kennebunkport\u2014they\u2019re\nall in a doxastic state that leads them to sincerely assert \u201cI\nam in Kennebunkport\u201d, and to engage in Kennebunkport-appropriate\nbehavior. Similarly, there\u2019s something doxastically in common to\neveryone disposed to sincerely assert, \u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore\nLake before me\u201d (Perry 1979) or \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d (Kaplan 1989).\n\nThese doxastic similarities are not a matter of all the group\nmembers\u2019 being in a common state of the type, believing\nP for some traditional proposition P.\n(There\u2019s no traditional proposition that all and only those\ndisposed to sincerely assert, e.g., \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d\nbelieve, believing which generates\u2014given otherwise typical\nbeliefs and desires\u2014corresponding behavioral dispositions.)\n\nNotice also that these problems are not just problems about belief.\nIt\u2019s awkward for the Simple Picture of belief that Hume and\nHeimson seem to have a common belief, but Hume\u2019s belief is\ncorrect while Heimson\u2019s is incorrect. Whatever\u2019s in common\nto Hume and Heimson, it\u2019s not standing in the belief relation to\na common traditional proposition. Since Hume and Heimson are\nworldmates, any traditional proposition that one of them would be\ncorrect to believe, the other would be as well. It\u2019s similarly\nawkward for a Simple Picture about desire that Hume and Heimson could\nequally well both want to be Hume (or to have written the\nTreatise), and if they did, Hume\u2019s desire would be\nsatisfied and Heimson\u2019s would not. This means, because Hume and\nHeimson are worldmates, that their conative similarity can\u2019t be\na matter of both standing in the desire relation to a common\ntraditional proposition. And once we\u2019ve seen this trick,\nit\u2019s easy to generate parallel examples for other propositional\nattitudes, and it\u2019s easy to generate examples in which the\nattitudes in question aren\u2019t as odd as Heimson\u2019s.\n\nMoreover, once we\u2019ve seen the trick of generating non-doxastic\nsimilarity cases, it\u2019s straightforward to generate non-doxastic\ndifference cases as well. A wants to lead and B\nwants to follow. That\u2019s a difference in preference, that gives\nrise to systematic differences in behavior. But it\u2019s not a\ndifference in traditional propositions desired. Very clearly,\nit\u2019s not a difference in the possible worlds A and\nB favor\u2014both favor the worlds in which A leads\nand B follows. And it\u2019s not clear how the extra\nstructure of traditional propositions that aren\u2019t sets of worlds\n(e.g., Russellian propositions) could help draw the distinction.\n(Lewis discusses a similar case in \u201cDispositional Theories of\nValue\u201d, 1989: 119.)\n\nThis points to another advantage of sameness and difference\narguments\u2014over ignorance arguments\u2014as the primary\nargumentative basis for recognizing self-locating belief: sameness and\ndifference arguments are easily generalized to other propositional\nattitudes, while ignorance arguments are belief-specific.\n3. Theoretical Responses\n\nIt\u2019s useful to think of Lewis and Perry as both rejecting the\nSimple Picture and as responding to its inadequacies by introducing\ndifferent sorts of complications.\n\nPerry rejects the Simple Picture\u2019s reliance on a simple, binary\nbelief relation. According to Perry, we need theoretical resources\nthat keep track, not just of which propositions subjects believe, but\nof the mechanisms by which they come to believe them.\n\nLewis rejects the Simple Picture\u2019s reliance on traditional\npropositions as the objects of belief. According to Lewis, we need\nobjects of belief that carve up a space of possibilities whose points\naren\u2019t worlds, but positions within worlds\u2014that is, worlds\ntogether with a position specified within them.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss Lewis\u2019 proposal first, then Perry\u2019s in\n section 3.2.\n3.1 Centered worlds\n\nOn Lewis\u2019s view, what\u2019s distinctive about self-locating\nbeliefs is their content. Instead of taking the objects of\nbelief to be possible worlds propositions, we take them to be\nproperties. Equivalently, we can take them to be sets of centered\nworlds. A centered world is a set-theoretic object that models a\nposition or a location within a world; it\u2019s easiest to think of\na centered world as a \\(\\langle \\textrm{world}, \\textrm{time},\n\\textrm{individual}\\rangle\\) triple. (Absent clever science-fictional\nexamples, specifying a world and then a time and an individual within\nthat world suffices to specify the intended sort of position or\nlocation. See Liao (2012) for troublemaking clever science-fictional\nexamples, and for discussion.) Treating objects of belief as sets of\ncentered worlds is equivalent to treating them as properties because\nfor each property \\(F\\), there\u2019s a set of centered worlds that\nincludes a given \\(\\langle w,t,i\\rangle\\) triple iff \\(i\\) has \\(F\\)\nat \\(t\\) in \\(w\\), and for each set of centered worlds, there\u2019s\na property that\u2019s shared by all and only those individuals in\nthose worlds at those times. (Note that this requires a plenitudinous\nontology of properties, to which Lewis is already independently\ncommitted. Those who subscribe to enough Lewisian metaphysics can\nalso, equivalently, treat the objects of belief as sets of worldbound\ntime-slices.) We will call a set of centered worlds a\ncentered-worlds proposition or a centered\nproposition, and a belief with a centered-worlds proposition as\nits content a centered belief.\n\nLewis (1979) argues that properties/centered-worlds propositions can\ndo all of the attitude-characterizing work of traditional\npossible-worlds propositions, and more besides. For each\npossible-worlds proposition P, there\u2019s a corresponding\nproperty (centered-worlds proposition)\u2014the property of\ninhabiting a P-world, a.k.a. the set of triples \\(\\langle\nw,t,i\\rangle\\) such that \\(w\\) is a P-world. But there are\nalso more properties and centered-worlds propositions\u2014ones that\nsometimes distinguish between worldmates, such that one individual in\na world has the property and another doesn\u2019t, or such that an\nindividual in a world has the property at some times but not others.\nLet\u2019s call the first kind of property or centered proposition\nboring and the second kind interesting. Where a\npossible-worlds proposition would do as an object of belief, the\ncorresponding boring property or centered proposition will do as well\n(see Nolan 2006 for dissent, and Turner 2010 and Feit 2010 for\ndefense). So every doxastic state that we could represent using belief\nrelations to possible-worlds propositions\u2014every one that\nappeared in the Simple Picture\u2014we can also represent using\nbelief relations to boring properties or boring centered propositions.\nBut having properties or centered propositions as objects of belief\ngives us additional resources we can use to represent doxastic states\nthat resisted characterization using the Simple Picture.\n\nFor example: What\u2019s missing in ignorance cases is an interesting\ncentered belief\u2014it\u2019s a state of believing\nP for an interesting centered proposition P. In\nthe messy shopper example, Perry\u2019s realization puts him in the\nbelief relation to the property being the messy shopper (or\nto the corresponding centered-worlds proposition). In the case of the\ntwo gods, the gods are belief-related to all the right boring\nworld-occupancy properties, but they\u2019re not belief-related to\nall the right interesting properties. The manna-throwing god on the\ntallest mountain, for example, isn\u2019t belief-related to being\non the tallest mountain or throwing manna.\n\nWhat\u2019s different in difference cases is interesting centered\nbeliefs\u2014it\u2019s a difference in states of believing\nP for interesting centered propositions P. In\nthe case of John and David and the bear, John and David are both\nbelief-related to inhabiting a world in which John is being\nattacked by a bear while David looks on, but only John is\nbelief-related to being attacked by a bear, while only David\nis belief-related to being an unattacked witness to a bear\nattack. This case highlights how \u201cself-locating\u201d\nbelief isn\u2019t just about geographical self-location. On\nLewis\u2019s framework self-locating beliefs relate individuals to\nproperties of the form, being such-and-such, as opposed to\nproperties of the form, inhabiting a world in which so-and-so\nperson is such-and-such. For example, having written the\nTreatise, rather than inhabiting a world in which Hume wrote\nthe Treatise. (Annoying complication: we need to qualify and\nrestrict to values of such-and-such where it\u2019s a\ncondition that\u2019s not necessarily satisfied by all individuals in\na world at all times if it\u2019s satisfied by any individual in that\nworld at any time.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the same in sameness cases is interesting centered\nbeliefs\u2014it\u2019s a similarity in states of believing\nP for interesting centered propositions P. In\nthe burning pants case, all of the people who sincerely exclaim\n\u201cmy pants are on fire!\u201d (and are disposed towards the\nassociated non-verbal behaviors) are belief-related to having\nburning pants. Hume and Heimson are both belief-related to\nbeing Hume, and to having written the Treatise.\n\nThis will generalize to the non-doxastic attitudes as well\u2014if we\ntake the objects of propositional attitudes generally to be properties\nor centered-worlds propositions, we can handle the cases of\nsimilarities and differences in desire (etc.) that resisted\ncharacterization in terms of attitudes toward possible-worlds\npropositions in the same way as we handle the recalcitrant\nsimilarities and differences in belief.\n3.2 Belief states\n\nPerry recommends that instead of complicating our picture of the\nobjects of belief, we complicate our picture of the belief relation.\nOn Perry\u2019s view, a proper doxastic theory focuses not just on\nthe propositions to which we stand in the belief relation, but also on\nthe mechanisms by which we come to be belief-related to those\npropositions.\n\nPerry\u2019s solution emphasizes that once we\u2019re externalists\nabout belief content, determination of what we believe is a two-part\naffair: Which propositions we\u2019re belief-related to depends\npartially on what we\u2019re like intrinsically, and partially on how\nwe\u2019re situated in our environment.\n\nSome of our states\u2014in particular, states of our internal\nmechanisms of mental representation\u2014determine not what we\nbelieve, but instead a function from environments to things believed.\nPerry calls these belief-states. Belief-states are\nindividuated by something like Kaplanian characters (Kaplan\n1989)\u2014functions from environments (contexts) to propositions a\nbeliever would be belief-related to if they were in that state in that\nenvironment.\n\nWhile this is deliberately not built into the theory,\nit\u2019s natural (and sometimes heuristically helpful) to think of\nbelief-states in terms of tokenings of language-of-thought sentences\nwith context-sensitive elements. (More generally, it\u2019s natural\nto think of them as particular patterns of deployment of one\u2019s\ninternal representational apparatus.)\n\nAccording to Perry, what\u2019s distinctive about distinctively\nself-locating beliefs is a particular sort of belief-state\u2014a\nbelief-state that belief-relates agents to different propositions in\ndifferent contexts. Instead of focusing our theoretical attention\nexclusively on which propositions subjects believe, we focus also on\nwhich belief-states they\u2019re in. And it\u2019s at the level of\nbelief-states that we find the tools for accommodating cases that make\ntrouble for the Simple Picture.\n\nTo explain how Perry\u2019s view addresses difficulties for the\nSimple Picture, we need a way of talking about belief-states. Perry\nuses English sentences to talk about belief-states, by indexing\nbelief-states to English sentences with the same\ncharacter\u2014English sentences displaying the same pattern of\ndependence of content on context as the belief-states. So the\nbelief-state corresponding to \u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d is\nthe belief-state such that, for any subject x who is in that\nstate, x is thereby belief-related to the proposition\nthat x is the messy shopper.\n\nOn this view, what\u2019s missing in ignorance cases isn\u2019t a\nbelief, but a belief-state. When Perry realizes what\u2019s happening\nin the supermarket, he doesn\u2019t (at least, he needn\u2019t) come\nto believe any new propositions, but he does come to be in a new\nbelief-state. He comes to be in the \u201cI am the messy\nshopper\u201d state, and thereby believes the proposition that\nPerry is the messy shopper. (He may have already had a belief\nwith that content, but if so it will have been in virtue of being in a\ndifferent belief-state.) It\u2019s a change in belief-state, not just\na change (if any) in propositions believed, that\u2019s responsible\nfor Perry\u2019s changed behavior.\n\nAnother example to illustrate the idea: Gennaro looks in a mirror,\nthinking he\u2019s looking through a window, and sees flames creeping\nup the pants leg of the person he sees in the glass. At first he says,\n\u201cthat guy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d, and is in the\n\u201cthat guy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d belief-state. He\nthereby comes to believe the traditional proposition that\nGennaro\u2019s pants are on fire. Then he realizes what\u2019s\nhappening, and comes to be in the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d\nbelief-state. There\u2019s no change in which propositions he\nbelieves\u2014he\u2019s still belief-related to the traditional\nproposition that Gennaro\u2019s pants are on fire. But\nbecause he\u2019s now belief-related to that proposition by way of\nthe \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d belief-state, his behavior\nchanges.\n\nThe difference in difference cases isn\u2019t a difference in\npropositions believed, but in belief-states. John and David are both\nbelief-related to the proposition that David is witnessing\nJohn\u2019s being attacked by a bear. But the belief-states that\nsupport their being belief-related to that proposition are different.\nDavid is in (for example) the \u201cI am witnessing that guy\u2019s\nbeing attacked by a bear\u201d belief-state, while John is in the\n\u201cthat guy is witnessing my being attacked by a bear\u201d\nbelief-state. This difference in belief-states generates the\ndifferences in their behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s the same in sameness cases is a belief-state, not a\nproposition believed. When Gennaro and Hector both exclaim, \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d, and engage in similar associated behavior,\nit\u2019s because they are both in the \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d belief-state. Being in that belief-state gets them\nbelief-related to different propositions. It relates Gennaro to the\nproposition that Gennaro\u2019s pants are on fire, while it\nrelates Hector to the proposition that Hector\u2019s pants are on\nfire. So the similarity is to be found at the level of\nbelief-states, not at the level of propositions believed.\n3.3 Other options\n\nThere are other theoretical options in the literature. See for example\nthose offered in Recanati (2007), Higginbotham (1995, 2010), Chisholm\n(1981), and Stalnaker (2008). But the Lewis/Perry contrast, where\nLewis responds by complicating the objects of belief, and Perry\nresponds by complicating the relations between believers and objects\nof belief, provides a useful classificatory scheme. Like Lewis,\nRecanati and Chisholm propose a more complicated account of content\nthan that of the Simple Picture, though their proposed alternatives\ndiffer. Higginbotham\u2019s token reflexive account is, we think,\nusefully grouped with Perry\u2019s view as accounting for\nself-locating phenomena with the mechanisms by which believers are\nrelated to the objects of belief; though again, the theoretically\nload-bearing features of the relations are different.\nStalnaker\u2019s (2008) account also likely belongs with\nPerry\u2019s. Rather than going into detail about other accounts of\nself-locating belief, we refer the interested reader to the works\ncited above.\n4. Another Motivation: Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\n\nLewis and Perry overlap extensively on their motivations for their\nviews: Both are focused on cases of ignorance, doxastic difference,\nand doxastic similarity that aren\u2019t happily captured in terms of\nstates of believing P for traditional propositions\nP. But not all theorists of self-locating belief are\nmotivated in the same way.\n\nAnother source of motivation, common in other threads of the\nself-location literature, but not prominent in the Lewis/Perry\ndialectic, is the phenomenon of immunity to error through\nmisidentification.\n\nThere are a number of influential discussions of this\nphenomenon\u2014for some prominent and helpful examples, see\nWittgenstein (1953), Shoemaker (1968), Anscombe (1975), Evans (1982),\nPryor (1999), Recanati (2007), Coliva (2009), Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n(2018), and the papers in Prosser and Recanati (2012). For more\nthorough discussion than we will offer here, see the supplement\n the scope of immunity to error through misidentification\n to the entry on\n Self-Consciousness.\n For a not-so-thorough introduction of the phenomenon, and how it can\nserve to motivate an account of self-locating belief, see below.\n\nHere is a framing of the phenomenon that follows Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(1953): There are two importantly different kinds of uses of\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014uses of \u201cI\u201d as subject and uses of\n\u201cI\u201d as object. There\u2019s a certain distinctive sort of\nerror that\u2019s possible in the second case but not in the first.\nConsider uses of \u201cI\u201d as object, as when I find myself, for\none reason or another, in a tangle of bodies, mistakenly take another\nperson\u2019s arm that I see to be mine, and judge, based on the\narm\u2019s visual appearance, \u201cI have a broken arm\u201d.\n(Perhaps I am participating in a game of Twister gone horribly wrong.)\nIn this case, my judgment is wrong, and in particular it\u2019s wrong\nbecause, though I\u2019ve correctly perceived that the arm I\u2019m\nlooking at is broken, I\u2019ve misidentified whose arm it is. In\nuses of \u201cI\u201d as subject, such as when I feel a pain and\njudge, \u201cI am in pain\u201d, my judgment can\u2019t be wrong in\nthe same way. Maybe I can be wrong about whether that sensation is a\npain, but I can\u2019t be wrong about whose sensation it is.\nJudgments employing \u201cI\u201d as subject are characterized as\nimmune to a particular type of error: they are immune to errors\nthrough misidentification.\n\nSubsequent literature has made much more precise the notion of error\nthrough misidentification, and has offered various hypotheses about\nexactly which beliefs (if any) are immune to such error. One recurring\nthread, though, is that if there\u2019s immunity to error through\nmisidentification, it\u2019s intimately bound up with thoughts about\noneself. If there are beliefs immune to error through\nmisidentification, then a particular class of thoughts about ourselves\nare among them.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Recanati (2007 and elsewhere) offers one prominent\naccount, building on Evans (1982) and Lewis (1979). Recanati\ndistinguishes between judgments whose contents do and do not contain\nan \u201cidentification component\u201d. Here\u2019s one way to\ncapture the thought: When Fran\u00e7ois has a de re thought\nabout Fran\u00e7ois \u2014where the content of the judgment is,\ne.g., that Fran\u00e7ois has a broken\narm\u2014that\u2019s a thought with an identification\ncomponent; the person represented as having a broken arm is explicitly\nrepresented, in the content of the judgment, as Fran\u00e7ois. When\nFran\u00e7ois has a distinctively self-locating thought, the content\nof the judgment is something \u201cidentification\nfree\u201d\u2014something corresponding to, for example, the\nproperty being in pain. In the latter case, there\u2019s no\ndanger of error due to misidentification, because there\u2019s no\nidentification-element in the judgment that can be the locus of\nmisidentification. (See Recanati 1993 and 2007 for Recanati\u2019s\nfull story.)\n\nSo the idea that some judgments are immune to misidentification-based\nerror provides another potential motivation for the introduction of a\ndistinctive category of self-directed belief: thinking about oneself\nas oneself.\n\nPursuing a different line, Anscombe (1975) suggests that the meanings\nof an individual\u2019s \u201cI\u201d-thoughts essentially tie them\nto that individual\u2019s actions, movements, and intentions. Yet\nit\u2019s not entirely clear how this picture would mesh with the\nother accounts and phenomena discussed in this section;\nAnscombe\u2019s framing of the issues is different from the one\nabove, and she is explicit that she\u2019s not talking about\ntraditional IEM phenomena such as \u201cI have a headache\u201d.\n5. Self-Location in Language\n\nSo far we\u2019ve discussed issues almost entirely within the\nphilosophy of mind. This is no accident\u2014the central motivating\nphenomena for an account of self-locating belief are phenomena in the\nphilosophy of mind, and the theoretical proposals for accommodating\nthose phenomena are proposals in the philosophy of mind (or at least,\nare most centrally proposals in the philosophy of mind). Debates about\nwhether to postulate a distinctive category of self-locating belief,\nand about the best theory of that distinctive category, are debates\nabout the theoretical resources needed to properly characterize\nsubjects\u2019 doxastic states. The arguments we\u2019ve considered\nall maintain that there are mental phenomena\u2014ignorance,\ncognitive similarity or difference, immunity to error\u2014that\nrequire special theoretical treatment featuring a particular category\nof mental states, the distinctively self-locating beliefs.\n\nThough its first home is in the philosophy of mind, self-locating\nbelief has also received much attention in linguistics and the\nphilosophy of language. This is unsurprising, because interesting\nphenomena in the philosophy of mind about belief are likely\nto cast shadows into linguistics and the philosophy of language about\nbelief reports, and the semantics thereof. (Similarly for our\naccounts of other sorts of attitudes, and our accounts of the\nlinguistic devices we use to report them.) There is an extensive\nliterature here, too large and much of it too technical for us to\nsummarize. For some points of entry, see Anand and Nevins (2004),\nAnand (2007), Casta\u00f1eda (1966, 1967), Chierchia (1989), Maier\n(2009), and Feit (2008).\n\nMore specifically, the parts of philosophy of language concerned with\ncommunication\u2014in particular, with the individual or collective\nmental states and attitudes that give rise to, and are produced by or\nupdated in response to, various speech acts\u2014must be sensitive to\nwhat we say about the objects and the structure of those attitudes\nwhen we\u2019re doing philosophy of mind. If our philosophy of mind\nincludes a distinctive category of self-locating belief, that\u2019s\nliable to raise downstream questions in the philosophy of language,\nabout (for example) how self-locating beliefs are (or are not)\nimplicated in the production of various speech acts, how interlocutors\nupdate their self-locating beliefs (or don\u2019t) in response to\nvarious speech acts, and about the place of self-locating beliefs in\nspeakers\u2019 communicative intentions or in the conversational\ncommon ground.\n\nThe first thing to note here is that there pretty clearly are\nsome self-locating communicative phenomena. (Or at least, it\u2019s\npretty clear that if there are self-locating beliefs, then there are\nsome self-locating communicative phenomena.)\n\nIf you grant the existence of self-locating beliefs, then it\u2019s\nclear that people can systematically and predictably give voice to\ntheir self-locating beliefs by using the right sentences of natural\nlanguage. For example, when Muhammad Ali says \u201cI am the\ngreatest\u201d, he\u2019s giving voice to a particular self-locating\nbelief\u2014what Lewis will characterize as a self-attribution of\nbeing the greatest, and what Perry will characterize as being\nin the \u201cI am the greatest\u201d belief-state. Similarly when I\ncall the friend I\u2019m supposed to be meeting at the bar and say,\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty clear that people can systematically and\npredictably produce self-locating beliefs in their interlocutors by\nusing the right sentences of natural language. For example, consider\nstandard uses of \u201cit\u2019s your turn\u201d. This utterance\nproduces in one\u2019s interlocutor the state Lewis would\ncharacterize as self-attributing having the next turn, and\nwhich Perry would characterize as being in the \u201cit\u2019s my\nturn\u201d belief-state. Similarly for \u201cyou are Rudolph\nLingens\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d, or\n\u201cyou\u2019re muted\u201d.\n\nThe central philosophical issue about self-locating communication is\nthat, while there pretty clearly is some self-locating\ncommunication, a model of communication that seems obvious and natural\nwhen we\u2019re dealing with non-self-locating belief doesn\u2019t\nstraightforwardly generalize to the self-locating case. We\u2019ll\nstart by looking at some examples of self-locating communication, then\npresent the model of communication that\u2019s so appealing when\nwe\u2019re not working with self-locating belief. Then we\u2019ll\ndiscuss why that model doesn\u2019t generalize, and finally lay out a\nselection of responses presently on offer in the literature.\n5.1 The package-delivery model of communication\n\nMost of the literature around self-locating communication presupposes\na Lewisian account on which what\u2019s distinctive about\nself-locating beliefs is their distinctively self-locating content. In\nwhat follows, we\u2019ll try to remain neutral between Lewisian,\ncontent-based accounts and Perry-style\nvehicle/mechanism/mode-of-presentation based accounts. To do this,\nwe\u2019ll need to introduce a bit of stipulatively defined technical\nvocabulary.\n\nWe will talk, for example, about John\u2019s self-locating\ndoxastic state when he\u2019s disposed to sincerely say,\n\u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d\u2014this is the state that\nmarks him off as doxastically similar to others who are also disposed\nto say \u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d (and to search their own\ngrocery carts for sources of mess), and as doxastically different from\nhis pre-cottoning-on self. We\u2019ll use \u201cdoxastic\nstate\u201d in a way that\u2019s deliberately neutral between\nstanding in the belief relation to a distinctively self-locating\ncontent, as Lewis would have it, or instead being in a particular\nPerry-style belief-state, such that different subjects, when in that\nbelief-state, are thereby belief-related to different traditional\npropositions. We want to use \u201cdoxastic state\u201d to talk\nabout the cognitive states that Lewis and Perry both target with their\ntheories, without taking a stand on who\u2019s offering the right\ntheoretical account of those states.\n\nWe\u2019ll follow Perry in using English sentences to identify\nparticular such doxastic states. So, for example, the \u201cmy pants\nare on fire\u201d doxastic state is the cognitive state underwriting\ndispositions to sincerely assert \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d,\nto seek out fire extinguishers and turn them on one\u2019s lower\nparts, etc., which according to Perry is a matter of being in a\nbelief-state whose character mirrors that of the English sentence, and\naccording to Lewis is a matter of standing in the belief relation to\nthe property one needs to instantiate in order to speak truly with the\nsentence, given the sentence\u2019s actual character (or standing in\nthe belief relation to the corresponding centered-worlds\nproposition).\n\nWe can also extend the distinction between boring and\ninteresting centered contents from\n section 3.1\n to doxastic states\u2014this will be useful in what follows. A\nboring doxastic state is one that might as well be a state of\nbelieving a traditional proposition. For Lewis, it\u2019ll be a state\nof believing a boring centered proposition or its corresponding\nworld-occupancy property. For Perry, it\u2019ll be a matter of being\nin a belief-state with constant character\u2014one that always\nrelates its bearers to the same traditional proposition. We identify\nthese doxastic states using context-insensitive English sentences (for\nexample, the \u201cJohn is in Palo Alto\u201d belief-state).\nInteresting (or interestingly self-locating) doxastic states are ones\nthat aren\u2019t boring. We identify these states using\ncontext-sensitive English sentences, such as \u201cI am in Palo\nAlto\u201d. For Lewis, these states belief-relate an agent to an\ninteresting centered proposition, or its corresponding interesting\nproperty. For Perry, these are belief-states that don\u2019t always\nrelate their bearers to the same traditional proposition.\n\nSo much for terminological stipulations. On to a model of\ncommunication that looks attractive when applied to non-self-locating\nbelief, but which doesn\u2019t straightforwardly generalize.\n\nFrom a very high altitude, linguistic communication (or at least, the\nlarge part of it that\u2019s concerned with the transmission of\ninformation) does this: I\u2019m in some doxastic state, and I want\nto get you into some appropriately matching doxastic state. Somehow or\nother, I use a linguistic signal to get you to adopt a doxastic state\nthat matches mine.\n\nWhen we\u2019re not dealing with self-location, it\u2019s extremely\nnatural to model communication by reading the \u201cappropriate\nmatch\u201d in this story as identity. On this model, assertion works\nas follows: I\u2019m in some doxastic state that, for one reason or\nanother, I\u2019d like you to be in as well. So I encode my doxastic\nstate linguistically somehow, and send the linguistic signal over to\nyou. Then (if all goes well) you respond to the signal I sent by\ngetting yourself into the same doxastic state that I encoded. This is\na tractable, simple picture of communication, according to which\nlinguistic communication (or at least this part of it) is a matter of\ntransmitting doxastic states from speaker to hearer. Moss (2012) calls\nthis the \u201cpackage delivery\u201d model, Egan (2007) calls it\nthe \u201cbelief transfer\u201d model, and Weber (2013) calls it the\n\u201cFedEx\u201d model. (Or rather, this is a generalization of the\nmodel described by Egan, Moss, and Weber, theoretically zoomed out to\nbe neutral between Lewis and Perry. Egan, Moss, and Weber all\npresuppose a Lewisian picture in their papers.) The model is nicely\nvisualized by the following cartoon from Weber (2013: 208):\n\n\n\u00a9 2013 Springer Nature, reproduced with permission.\n\n\nWeber also helpfully breaks up the model into two principles: the\nmind-to-speech principle, according to which what\u2019s\nlinguistically expressed is the same as what\u2019s in the (sincere)\nspeaker\u2019s mind, and the speech-to-mind principle, according to\nwhich what winds up in the (credulous) addressee\u2019s mind is the\nsame as what\u2019s linguistically expressed. We are, in what\nfollows, going to focus exclusively on the relation between\ndoxastic states of sincere speakers and credulous addressees.\nWe will suppress, as much as possible, discussion of the precise\nrelations between speaker/addressee doxastic states and the linguistic\ncommunication mechanisms that serve to coordinate them.\n\nSo, in particular, we will suppress questions about the relation\nbetween the compositional semantic values of natural language\nsentences in context and the doxastic states of sincere speakers and\ncredulous addressees. We\u2019ll do this not because we find the\nissues unimportant or uninteresting\u2014quite the contrary! Rather,\nwe want to avoid swimming into deep waters about exactly what the\nrelevant communication-supporting relations are, what they have to do\nwith semantics, etc., and also to keep the discussion at a level of\nabstraction compatible with as many particular theories of the\nphenomena as possible. (See Stanley 1997, 2002; Yalcin 2007; Ninan\n2010a, 2012a; and Rabern 2012, 2017 for some exploration of those deep\nwaters, and see for example Egan, Hawthorne, & Weatherson 2005;\nEgan 2007, 2010, 2012; Stalnaker 2008, 2011; Feit 2008; Torre 2010;\nNinan 2010b, Stojanovic 2012; Moss 2012; Kindermann 2012, 2016, 2019;\nWeber 2013, 2015; K\u00f6lbel 2013; and Recanati 2016 for less cagey\nand more committal discussions of these issues around self-locating\ncommunication.)\n5.2 Failures of the package-delivery model\n\nLet\u2019s consider where and why the package-delivery model breaks\ndown for self-locating communication. First we\u2019ll examine cases\nin which there is clearly some self-locating communication happening,\nbut the self-locating communication isn\u2019t of the type\ncontemplated by the package-delivery model. Then we\u2019ll identify\nthe general phenomenon behind the package-delivery model\u2019s\nfailure to happily account for these cases.\n\nWhen Muhammad Ali says \u201cI am the greatest\u201d, he\u2019s\ndefinitely giving voice to his self-locating doxastic state (which\nLewis would characterize as self-attributing being the\ngreatest), but that doxastic state is not, and is not intended to\nbe, transferred to his interlocutors. Ali wants his interlocutors to\nget in to the \u201cMuhammad Ali is the greatest\u201d doxastic\nstate, not the \u201cI am the greatest\u201d doxastic state. And\nit\u2019s the former, not the latter, that addressees who take Ali at\nhis word will in fact get themselves into.\n\nSimilarly, when Bob seeks to resolve Lingens\u2019 uncertainty by\nsaying to him, \u201cyou are Rudolph Lingens\u201d, his\ncommunicative aim is to get Lingens into the \u201cI am Rudolph\nLingens\u201d doxastic state. But Bob, being no fool, is not himself\nin the self-locating doxastic state that he\u2019s aiming to produce\nin his interlocutor.\n\nIn each of these cases, the communication that takes place is\ndifficult to straightforwardly characterize on a belief\ntransfer/package-delivery model. The doxastic state that the\ncooperative, credulous addressee gets into is not the same as the\nself-locating state that motivates the sincere speaker\u2019s\nutterance, and which the speaker demonstrates or gives voice to by way\nof the utterance.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, and it doesn\u2019t result\nfrom a quirk or shortcoming of one particular human language, or of\nactual human languages as compared to other possible types of\nlanguage. There is an in-principle problem with package-delivery\ncommunication of interestingly self-locating doxastic states.\nPrecisely because they\u2019re interestingly self-locating, such\ndoxastic states aren\u2019t the sort of thing that can uniformly be\ntransmitted from speaker to addressee without leading addressees into\nerror. This is easiest to see in an extreme case: It\u2019s great for\nDavid Hume to be in the \u201cI am David Hume\u201d doxastic state.\nIt\u2019s not so great for anybody else to be in that state, and\nit\u2019s not great for Hume to put his interlocutors in that state\nby communicating it package-delivery style.\n\nA somewhat less extreme example: Suppose I\u2019m in the \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d doxastic state. I want to communicate my\nplight to you so that you\u2019ll give me a bucket of water, or a\nfire extinguisher. I don\u2019t want to get you into the \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d state\u2014that won\u2019t enlist your help\nin my pants-extinguishing project, and it will give you inaccurate\nbeliefs, since your pants (we may suppose) are not on fire.\nSo communicating my self-locating belief via belief transfer will not\nachieve my communicative goals.\n\nI want to get you into some other doxastic state. Getting you\ninto the \u201cthe pants of the guy addressing me are on fire\u201d\nstate would likely do the trick, as would getting you into the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state. The communicative\neffect of saying \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d is not what would\nbe predicted by a view on which that sentence\u2019s conventional\ncommunicative role is to ensure that both speaker and addressee are in\nthe \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state.\n\nThe situation is similar for very many indexical sentences\u2014their\nproduction is clearly motivated (in standard cases) by a particular\nself-locating doxastic state, but their communicative role is\nemphatically not to bring it about that that doxastic state\nis shared by both speaker and addressee. The communicative role of\n(uses of) typical indexical sentences is not to deliver a\nself-locating doxastic package from speaker to addressee.\n5.3 Alternative models of communication\n\nThe literature offers many responses to the failure of self-locating\ndoxastic states to play nicely with a package-delivery model of\ncommunication. We won\u2019t attempt to survey them in detail here.\nInstead, we\u2019ll present a taxonomy of response-types. The\nresponses fall into three main categories: recentering,\ndecentering, and restriction. (There is a fourth\noption\u2014multicentering\u2014which we will discuss only\nbriefly, because its distinctive claims and contributions are in its\naccount of the linguistic mediation between speakers\u2019 and\naddressees\u2019 attitudes. As far as what it says about\nspeakers\u2019 and addressees\u2019 attitudes themselves, it\u2019s\na version of a recentering account. More about this below.)\n\nThis literature typically frames its questions and proposals in a\nLewisian framework. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that the issue of\ncommunicating self-locating beliefs doesn\u2019t arise only for the\nLewisian. So we will continue to characterize candidate responses in\nLewis/Perry neutral terms. For points of entry into the literature,\nsee Heim 2004\n (Other Internet Resources);\n Egan 2007; Feit 2008; Moss 2012; Kindermann 2016; Stojanovic 2012;\nK\u00f6lbel 2013; the papers in Garc\u00eda-Carpintero and Torre\n2016; Torre 2010; and Ninan 2010b.\n\nThe first move we\u2019ll discuss is recentering (the first\nuse of that term we can locate is in Weber 2013). The idea is that\nsuccessful communication doesn\u2019t require transmission of a\nsingle doxastic state from speaker to addressee. The doxastic state\nthat motivates sincere assertion needn\u2019t be the same as the\ndoxastic state adopted as a result of credulous uptake. What\u2019s\nexpressed is what the speaker believes, but what the hearer comes to\nbelieve as a result of accepting the assertion is something else. In\ncredulous, trusting uptake, the addressee doesn\u2019t (more\ncarefully\u2014needn\u2019t) come to adopt the doxastic state\nexpressed by the speaker\u2019s sincere assertion, but instead\nrecenters, adopting a doxastic state that stands in a\nparticular relation to the doxastic state of the speaker, reflecting\nthe addressee\u2019s beliefs about how they and the speaker are\nrelated to one another.\n\nSo, for example, when Andy says to Mike, \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d, Andy believes (for example) the interesting de\nse proposition corresponding to the property, having burning\npants. Mike, when he accepts Andy\u2019s assertion,\ndoesn\u2019t come to believe what Andy believes. Mike instead comes\nto believe a \u201cre-centered\u201d relative of what Andy\nbelieves\u2014the interesting de se proposition\ncorresponding to the property of (for example), being addressed by\nsomeone with burning pants. Andy says what he says because he is\nin the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state, and wants to\nmake it the case that Mike is in an appropriately matching state. The\nappropriately matching state that Mike, as a credulous addressee,\ncomes to be in is not the very same state Andy is in, but something\nelse\u2014for example, the \u201cthe guy who just addressed\nme\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state.\n\nHow exactly does linguistic communication produce these properly\naligned doxastic states? Multiple proposals are available; we\u2019ll\npause for a moment to discuss multicentering accounts. In\nmulticentering models, self-locating communication is\ncharacterized by means of multicentered contents\u2014sets\nof n-tuples, each of which contains a world, a time, and a\nseries of individuals. We can characterize the content of\nAndy\u2019s communication to Mike with a set of triples \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\) such that, in \\(w\\) at \\(t\\),\n\\(i_1\\) is addressing \\(i_2\\), and \\(i_1\\)\u2019s pants are on fire.\nIf Andy had instead said, \u201cyou are better at basketball than\nme\u201d, we could model the content with the set of \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\)s such that, at \\(t\\) in \\(w\\),\n\\(i_2\\) is better at basketball than \\(i_1\\). The intuitive idea is\nthat we characterize communicated content (and conversational common\nground) using sets of set-theoretic objects whose role is to\nrepresent, not a single individual, but an entire conversational\ngroup. They do this by containing, for each participant in the\nconversation, an element representing that particular conversational\nparticipant. These objects characterize the state of the whole\nconversation, and the effects that utterances have on the state of the\nconversation. They don\u2019t directly characterize the cognitive\nattitudes of particular parties to the conversation\u2014a set of\nmulticentered worlds is not a good candidate to be an object of belief\nfor an individual (though see Ninan 2012b for a different application\nof the multicentering apparatus to represent de re\nattitudes). Instead there is a translation from the single set of\nmulticentered worlds characterizing the state of the conversation to\nthe various different sets of singly-centered worlds characterizing\nthe doxastic states of particular parties to the conversation. (When\nthe conversation is properly characterized by a set of \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\)s such that, in \\(w\\) at \\(t\\),\n\\(i_2\\) is better at basketball than \\(i_1\\), and we\u2019re using\nthe first individual position to represent Andy and the second to\nrepresent Mike, that will mean that Andy self-attributes being the\nworse basketball player in a two-person conversation, and Mike\nself-attributes being the better basketball player in a two-person\nconversation.)\n\nWhat\u2019s important for our purposes here is that multicentering\naccounts describe, in an elegant and compact way, the interlocking\npattern of distinct but systematically related doxastic states of the\nparticular parties to the conversation. Each party to the conversation\nhas their own private doxastic states, which are properly\ncharacterized in terms of singly-centered propositions. And in cases\nof successful communication, the sincere speaker and credulous\naddressee wind up, not in the same doxastic state, but in doxastic\nstates systematically related to each other, in ways that the\nmulticentering account is designed to represent. So for our present,\nlimited purposes\u2014where we are concerned just with the relations\nbetween the doxastic states of speakers and addressees in successful\ncommunication, and are averting our eyes from the details of\nlinguistic mechanisms that underwrite that communication and take us\nfrom the one to the other, and also from tools that characterize the\noverall state of a conversation rather than just the doxastic states\nof participants\u2014a multicentering account becomes a way of\nimplementing a recentering account. (There is a lot more to\nsay about this. See for example Stalnaker 2008, 2014; Torre 2010;\nNinan 2010b, 2012a, 2013; and Kindermann 2012, 2016.)\n\nOn decentering models, we retain the package-delivery model\nof communication, but disallow interestingly self-locating doxastic\nstates as deliverable objects. The doxastic states linguistically\ncommunicated are all boring doxastic states. This allows us\nto retain the package-delivery model of communication.\n\nYet the decenterer acknowledges that there are systematic relations\nbetween interestingly self-locating doxastic states and boring\ndoxastic states, for both speakers and hearers. The decenterer uses\nthese connections to explain self-locating communicative effects. On\none way of implementing a decentering model, when Andy says to Mike,\n\u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d, Andy expresses the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state. (Other\nimplementations will differ with respect to just which boring doxastic\nstate is expressed.) And that\u2019s the doxastic state that Mike\nwinds up in as well. But being in the boring \u201cAndy\u2019s pants\nare on fire\u201d doxastic state is differently connected to\ninteresting doxastic states for Andy than for Mike. For Andy, given\nhis total package of self-locating beliefs, being in the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state goes hand in hand\nwith being in the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d state. For Mike,\ngiven his total package of self-locating beliefs, being in the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state goes hand in hand\nnot with the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d state, but with the\n\u201cthe guy I\u2019m talking to\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d\nstate.\n\nSo while what travels (what\u2019s expressed, what\u2019s\ncommunicated) is the boring state, being in that boring state goes\nalong with being in a particular interestingly self-locating state for\nthe speaker, and with a different interestingly self-locating state\nfor the addressee. Moss (2012), working in a Lewisian framework, puts\nit this way: a de se belief is, always, for any particular\nbeliever, going to be \u201cequivalent given certainties\u201d to\nsome de dicto belief of theirs. (In the present framework,\nde se beliefs play the role of interestingly self-locating\ndoxastic states, and de dicto beliefs the role of boring\ndoxastic states.) What travels in communication is the de\ndicto belief, which is liable to be equivalent given certainties\nto one de se belief for speaker, and another for addressee.\nNote that this requires that there\u2019s always, for every believer\nand every de se belief, a de dicto proxy belief\navailable that\u2019s equivalent to that de se belief for\nthat speaker, given what the speaker is certain of. All decenterers\nmust take on something like this substantive commitment to get their\nprogram off the ground (see Stalnaker 2008 and Moss 2012 for details).\nStalnaker (2008) concedes that this approach requires countenancing\nhaecceties (see entry on\n haecceitism),\n which not everyone will be comfortable with. (See also Weber 2015;\nPagin 2016; and Torre 2018 for criticism of the commitment to the\navailability of non-self-locating proxies.)\n\nThe general decentering strategy is to take self-locating attitudes\nout of the story about communication, and put them in the story about\nrelations between what\u2019s communicated and the\ninterlocutors\u2019 private belief-states. Everybody allows, and\nneeds to allow, that speakers and hearers have their own proprietary\ndoxastic states. And everybody allows, and needs to allow, that which\ndoxastic commitments a speaker displays in asserting what they\nbelieve, and which other doxastic commitments a hearer incurs by\naccepting what\u2019s asserted, are going to be highly\ninterpersonally variable. (If you and I are acquainted with different\nmembers of this term\u2019s introduction to philosophy class, which\nde re beliefs we\u2019re committed to when we both accept\nthat every member of the class passed the exam is going to be\ndifferent.) The decenterer solves the problem of self-locating\nbeliefs\u2019 making trouble for the package-delivery model by making\nself-locating beliefs ineligible for (direct) communication, then\nexplaining self-locating communicative effects via uncentered\ncommunication\u2019s knock-on effects for interlocutors\u2019\nprivate self-locating beliefs.\n\nWe\u2019ll call the third response-type restriction.\nRestriction approaches preserve the package-delivery model, but\ndon\u2019t uniformly disallow interestingly self-locating doxastic\nstates as objects of communication. Restrictionists take the fact that\nassertions of \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d don\u2019t lead to\ncredulous addressees getting into the \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d doxastic state to be a reason to think that the English\nsentence doesn\u2019t conventionally communicate the self-locating\ndoxastic state. But they don\u2019t go on to impose a blanket ban on\nself-locating doxastic states as objects of communication, and they\nallow that other sentences might conventionally encode other\nself-locating doxastic states as objects of package-delivery-model\ncommunication. So while the \u201cI am Mike Titelbaum\u201d and\n\u201cI am the greatest\u201d doxastic states are more-or-less\nuniformly disastrous as objects of package-delivery communication,\npackage-delivery communication of the \u201cwe are in\nAmsterdam\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in here\u201d, and\n\u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d states, for example, would\nquite frequently be unproblematic, and even quite useful.\n\nRestriction models aim to rule out, not self-locating doxastic states\ngenerally, but only the troublemaking ones, as objects of\ncommunication. They retain the package-delivery model, but say that\nsome of a speakers\u2019 doxastic states are bad candidates for\nlinguistic communication.\n\nRestrictionists take on two central commitments: First, we\nshouldn\u2019t expect to find natural language devices for\ncommunicating self-locating doxastic states that are systematically\ntroublemaking (such as the \u201cI am David Hume\u201d state).\nSecond, we should expect to see a distinctive sort of conversational\ndefectiveness in assertions of self-locating contents that are locally\ntroublemaking (Egan 2007, 2010).\n\nFor example: Doxastic states such as the \u201cI am the\nspeaker\u201d state or the \u201cI am fifty years old\u201d state\nare extremely likely to be troublemaking if asserted on a\npackage-delivery model, because it\u2019s extremely likely that not\nall the participants in a conversation will believe truly by being in\nthem. The fact that the speaker has the property one must have in\norder to believe truly by being in those doxastic states is not\nstrongly correlated with the speaker\u2019s addressees having it, and\nso it\u2019s very likely that if these states were communicated by\npackage delivery, a package would get delivered that the recipient\nought not to accept.\n\nHowever, doxastic states such as the \u201cwe are in\nAmsterdam\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in here\u201d, or\n\u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d states are less likely to be\ntroublemaking. That\u2019s because participants in a conversation are\nfrequently (though not so frequently as at earlier points in human\ntechnological history) geographically very close to each other,\nexperiencing similar environmental conditions, and attending to the\nsame geographical features.\n\nSo package-delivery transmissions of the \u201cI am the\nspeaker\u201d, \u201cI am fifty years old\u201d, etc. doxastic\nstates should be problematic, and we shouldn\u2019t expect to see\nthem very often, we shouldn\u2019t expect to see natural language\nconstructions that are in the business of expressing them, and we\nshould expect them to be marked as defective on any occasions where\nthey do take place. Package-delivery transmissions of the \u201cwe\nare in Amsterdam\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in\nhere\u201d doxastic states, on the other hand, shouldn\u2019t be (or\nshouldn\u2019t systematically be) problematic. And so we should (says\nthe restrictionist) be open to the possibility of natural language\nconstructions conventionally expressing them, and we should expect any\nsuch constructions to display a distinctive sort of defectiveness in\nthe (not-super-frequent) situations when the speaker and their\naudience are different in the relevant respect. (Other kinds of\nself-locating doxastic states that have been suggested as objects of\npackage-delivery communication by recenterers include the \u201cthat\ntastes good to me\u201d state and the \u201cI don\u2019t have\nevidence that rules out rain\u201d state. See Egan 2007 and\n2010\u2014though he doesn\u2019t quite describe things in these\nterms.)\n\nConcluding this section on self-location in language: Self-locating\nbeliefs introduce complications in accounts of belief reporting.\n(Similarly for other attitudes and reports thereof.) Also, some\nself-locating communicative phenomena need to be accounted for in our\nphilosophy of language. Those won\u2019t be accounted for\nstraightforwardly by a package-delivery/belief-transfer model.\nWe\u2019ll need some extra resources to do that, and it\u2019s\ncontroversial which resources are best suited for the job. Above,\nwe\u2019ve introduced the issue and some of the main proposals for\nresolving it. Readers interested in exploring these topics further\nmight start with the papers contained in Garc\u00eda-Carpintero and\nTorre (2016), as well as the others papers cited above.\n6. Self-Location in Decision Theory and Formal Epistemology\n\nAmong the many things that happen in his 1979 paper, Lewis makes the\nfollowing comment in passing:\n\n\nIt is interesting to ask what happens to decision theory if we take\nall attitudes as de se. Answer: very little. We replace the\nspace of worlds by the space of centered worlds, or by the space of\nall inhabitants of worlds. All else is just as before. Whatever the\npoints of the space of possibilities may be, we have probability\ndistributions over the space and assignments of utility values to the\npoints. For any rational agent at any time there is a pair of a\nprobability distribution and a utility assignment. The probabilities\nchange under the impact of his perception; the probabilities and\nutilities jointly govern his action. (1979: 534)\n\n\nYet incorporating self-locating attitudes into decision theory takes a\nlittle more work than the \u201cvery little\u201d Lewis supposed (as\nLewis himself acknowledged in a footnote to his 1996 (n. 6, pp.\n309\u201310)). The trouble comes when we ask how self-locating\ndoxastic states change over time. Formal decision theories have\nupdating rules to manage these transitions. We will focus on how\nself-locating states interact with Bayesian updating rules (see entry\non\n Bayesian epistemology);\n similar problems arise on other updating formalisms of which we are\naware.\n\nStart with a Lewisian approach to self-locating states. Decision\ntheory works with numerical degrees of belief\u2014or\n\u201ccredences\u201d\u2014rather than full beliefs. Following\nLewis, we may distribute credences over a space of centered worlds (or\nproperties) rather than uncentered possible worlds. On this approach,\nwhen John learns that he is the messy shopper, his credence in the\ncentered proposition associated with \u201cI am the messy\nshopper\u201d increases dramatically. The Bayesian updating rule\ncalled \u201cConditionalization\u201d handles this transition\neasily. For instance, we can model John as conditionalizing on that\ncentered proposition, sending it from a middling or low degree of\nconfidence in his mind to certainty.\n\nThe trouble comes when we go in the other direction.\nConditionalization famously sends propositions to certainty then keeps\nthem there ever-after. Suppose that around 11:30 am, Perry\u2019s\nprofessor is certain of the proposition associated with \u201cIt is\nnot now noon\u201d. On Lewis\u2019s approach, the professor loses\nconfidence in that proposition as time passes. But Conditionalization\ncannot model drops from certainty to lower degrees of confidence.\n(Similarly, Conditionalization cannot model increases from no credence\nto a positive value, so when the time comes to recognize that\nit\u2019s noon and go to his meeting, the professor won\u2019t be\nable to do that either.)\n\nConditionalization was designed to model an idealized process in which\nagents accumulate information to hone in on non-self-locating\nhypotheses whose truth-values remain constant (e.g., the atomic\nnumber of lead is 82). The model founders when propositions\nchange their truth-values as the accumulation occurs.\nConditionalization wasn\u2019t designed to hit moving targets.\nNeither, for that matter, was Jeffrey\u2019s (1965)\n\u201cprobability kinematics\u201d; Namjoong Kim (2009) shows that\nJeffrey\u2019s update rule fails just as badly as Conditionalization\nwhen applied to credences in Lewisian centered propositions. (Of\ncourse, decision theory involves not only credence but also utility\nassignments, and the latter may be self-locating just as easily as the\nformer. Decision theories usually assume that utility distributions\nremain constant, and so typically have not bothered to offer utility\nupdating schemes. But if we introduce utilities in self-locating\npropositions\u2014I\u2019d get higher utility from addressing that\nproblem tomorrow than today\u2014then such updating\nschemes may become needed!)\n\nPerhaps the culprit is taking self-locating attitudes to be directed\nat such moving targets; perhaps self-locating credences are not\nattitudes adopted towards Lewisian propositions. Since around\n2008\u2014spurred in large part by Elga\u2019s (2000) introduction\nof the \u201cSleeping Beauty Problem\u201d to the philosophical\nliterature\u2014a number of self-locating update schemes have been\nproposed. Most work with formal models built on Lewisian contents,\nthough some authors have employed other structures: Chalmers (2011)\nprimary intensions; Braun (2016) Russellian propositions with guises;\nStalnaker (2008) more complex centered-worlds constructions.\nNevertheless, as of this writing a general consensus has emerged that\nno matter what theoretical account one gives of doxastic states, the\nBayesian updating rules of Conditionalization and Jeffrey\nConditionalization will have to be amended or supplemented in some\nway.\n\nTo understand the rival amendments proposed, return to our\n section 5\n discussion of communication, and imagine that the individuals\ncoordinating doxastic states are an earlier and later edition of the\nsame agent. In linguistic communication we usually think of a\nspeaker\u2019s utterance as directly producing a single doxastic\nstate in the addressee, then indirectly producing knock-on addressee\nstates which follow from that one. Communication from an earlier to a\nlater self doesn\u2019t have this bottleneck structure; the present\nme directly inherited a whole slew of doxastic states from myself a\nmoment ago. Still, in formal updating it\u2019s useful to start by\naligning just one of the later agent\u2019s states with a state of\nthe earlier agent, then to work out the rest of the later\nagent\u2019s states from that one.\n\nFor instance, Kim (2009) adopts a recentering approach, on which an\nagent\u2019s Thursday credence that it rained yesterday is\ncoordinated with her Wednesday credence that it rains today.\nOther credences of the later self (e.g., credence that it rains on\nWednesday) may be worked out from that one. (Further recentering\napproaches are offered by Meacham 2010; Schulz 2010; and Schwarz\n2012.) Halpern (2005) and Meacham (2008), on the other hand, adopt\ndecentering approaches on which the crucial updating step coordinates\ncredences in uncentered propositions (that it rains on\nWednesday). Stalnaker (2008) and Moss (2012) offer decentered\nvariants in which the crucial uncentered propositions are de\nre (it rains on that day). Titelbaum (2013a)\ndevelops a restriction model, focused on the transfer of\n\u201cepistemically context-insensitive\u201d doxastic\nstates\u2014states that both the earlier and later selves are certain\ndo not change truth-values between the two times. (The category of\n\u201cepistemically context-sensitive\u201d may also include states\nbeyond the explicitly self-locating. For instance, an epistemologist\nwho\u2019s a contextualist about knowledge attributions may\nanticipate that the truth-value of \u201cBob knows he has\nhands\u201d will change across contexts.) Titelbaum articulates\nconditions under which epistemically context-insensitive states can be\ntrusted to convey all the relevant information from earlier to later\nself, and discusses how to update when these conditions aren\u2019t\nmet.\n\nFor a survey of the strengths and blindspots of all these updating\napproaches, see Titelbaum (2016). To get a sense how one might argue\nfor some of the approaches over others, see Briggs (2010) and Kierland\n& Monton (2005). For applications of self-locating update to other\nphilosophical topics of interest (indifference principles, quantum\nmechanics, the multiverse, etc.), see Titelbaum (2013b).\n7. Objections\n\nThe positive accounts concerning self-locating belief we\u2019ve\ndescribed above (Lewis\u2019 and Perry\u2019s, the accounts of\ncommunication, the accounts of updating, etc.) each face their own\nspecific objections and challenges. Here, however, we take up\nobjections to the main argumentative thread pursued in this piece:\nthat cases of ignorance, similarity, and difference require us to\nrecognize a distinctive category of self-locating belief.\n\nWe have assessed this as a thesis in the philosophy of mind. Yet\nit\u2019s easy for this thesis to become conflated with various\ntheses in the philosophy of language, and thus for arguments against\nthe need for special linguistic constructions to express self-locating\nattitudes to be mistaken for arguments that such attitudes don\u2019t\nexist to begin with. (Here it doesn\u2019t help that many of\nPerry\u2019s key examples appear in the course of his argument for an\n\u201cessential indexical\u201d.)\n\nMillikan (1990), for instance, argues that self-locating attitudes\n(doxastic or otherwise) could exist without the presence of indexicals\nin either communicative language or the language of thought (if there\nbe such). She imagines creatures, each of whom has a special name for\nthemselves\u2014a name employed in all and only their self-locating\nthoughts and expressions. For instance, John might employ the name\n\u201cJP\u201d whenever he thinks or speaks a self-locating thought\nabout himself, and never otherwise; while David might use\n\u201cDL\u201d, etc. We can imagine that these creatures\u2019\nlanguage entirely lacks expressions whose characters shift across\ncontexts (in the sense of Kaplan 1989).\n\nIf Millikan is right that such creatures could exist, then it seems\nthe cases of ignorance, similarity, and difference we\u2019ve\nidentified could perhaps occur without necessitating any indexicals,\nused either among the actors in the examples or among the theorists\ndescribing the cases. Notice, however, that this is not an argument\nagainst the existence of self-locating attitudes; it is simply an\nargument that self-locating attitudes could exist without the\nattendant presence of indexicals.\n\nSimilarly, a number of authors have argued that the cases that seem to\ncall for self-locating beliefs are \u201cjust Frege cases\u201d\n(Millikan 1990: 730; Devitt 2013; Magidor 2015; and especially\nCappelen & Dever 2013). Cappelen and Dever offer the following\nparallel case to Perry\u2019s messy shopper:\n\n\nPushing my cart down the aisle I was looking for CK to tell him he was\nmaking a mess. I kept passing by Superman, but couldn\u2019t find CK.\nFinally, I realized, Superman was CK. I believed at the outset that CK\nwas making a mess. And I was right. But I didn\u2019t believe that\nSuperman was making a mess. That seems to be something that I came to\nbelieve. And when I came to believe that, I stopped looking around and\nI told Superman to clean up after himself. My change in beliefs seems\nto explain my change in behavior. (Cappelen & Dever 2013: 33)\n\n\nThe objection seems to be that the motivating cases for self-locating\nbelief don\u2019t do anything new; they don\u2019t highlight any\nphenomena we shouldn\u2019t already have been aware of from decades\nof study of Frege\u2019s puzzle. We know from that puzzle that our\ntheory of content needs to accommodate multiple ways of referring to\nthe same object, and that cases of ignorance, similarity, and\ndifference can arise from such multiplicity. While there are plenty of\ndebates about which theory of propositions handles this puzzle best,\nyour preferred mechanism for solving that puzzle should equally well\nhandle the motivating cases above\u2014or so the objection goes.\n\nThis line might succeed as an objection against the claim that cases\nof self-location require us to modify our theory of propositions (as,\nfor instance, Lewis suggests). Perhaps if we had a theory of\npropositions that successfully handled Frege puzzles, it would apply\nmutatis mutandis to these cases as well. (Though see Shaw\n2019 for a denial of this concession.) But that is no argument against\nthe existence of a distinctive category of self-locating beliefs.\n\nTo see why, let\u2019s focus on one theory of propositions that\npurports to address Frege cases (a similar point could be made on any\nother such theory). Imagine that propositions are Russellian, but are\nbelieved under guises. So I might believe de re of someone\nthat their pants are on fire, and also see on a Zoom call that\nsomeone\u2019s pants are on fire. If the person about whom I have the\nde re belief is also the unfortunate Zooming individual, then\nI believe the same proposition under two guises\u2014one de\nre and one descriptive (with the relevant description being\nsomething like the guy on Zoom).\n\nPut in terms of guise theory, the cases of ignorance, similarity, and\ndifference seem to show that there exists a distinctive category of\nattitudes whose propositional contents are not believed under de\nre or descriptive guises. When Perry realizes that he is the one\nmaking a mess, he does not come to believe the proposition that Perry\nis making a mess under the guise that John Perry is making a\nmess, nor does he come to believe that proposition under the\nde re guise that that guy is making a mess. To\naccount for Perry\u2019s new doxastic state, we need to recognize a\ndistinctive type of belief that is not a state of believing a\nproposition under a descriptive or de re guise. We can\nconcede that self-locating beliefs are still beliefs in propositions\nunder guises, understood as guise theory wants to understand them in\nits proposed response to Frege puzzles. But that does not keep them\nfrom being a distinctive category of beliefs.\n\nCappelen and Dever do, however, offer a distinct line of attack that\nbears directly on the existence of self-locating doxastic states.\n(Their attack builds upon suggestions in Magidor 2015.) Many of our\ncases of ignorance, similarity, and difference cite as evidence for\nthe presence of significant self-locating beliefs an action performed\nby an agent. That Perry has resolved his ignorance about the identity\nof the messy shopper is indicated by his rearranging a sack; the\ndifference between my taking my own pants to be on fire and my\nfriend\u2019s taking my pants to be aflame is indicated by my\ndropping to the ground and rolling around; etc. In each case, it is\neventually argued that these actions cannot be entirely explained by\ndescriptive or de re cognitive states, and thus that we need\nto attribute self-locating beliefs to the agents in question in order\nexplain their actions. More generally, there is a consistent\nsuggestion across the self-location literature that self-locating\ncognitive states play a central, and crucial, role in action\nexplanation.\n\nCappelen and Dever deny that self-locating doxastic states play any\nrole in action explanation, hoping to thwart some of the main\nmotivating cases for asserting that such doxastic states exist. They\nbegin by asking us to imagine a god whose doxastic states are all of\nthe type envisioned by the Simple Picture\u2014binary relations\nbetween the believer and objects of belief that are traditional\npropositions. This god\n\n\ncan bring about states of the world just by intending them or maybe\njust by thinking them. The god thinks, \u201cThe door is\nclosed\u201d, and straightaway the door is closed. (2013: 37)\n\n\nIt seems this god could perform all sorts of\nactions\u2014intentionally bring about all sorts of states of\naffairs\u2014without having any self-locating representations at\nall.\n\nYet the actions of non-omnipotents are a bit more difficult to\nexplain. Why, when my friend and I both realize my pants are aflame,\ndo I but not he drop to the ground and roll? Cappelen and Dever deny\nthat this is because I possess some special self-representing\ncognitive state that my friend lacks. They trace the difference in\naction not to a difference in belief or desire, but instead to a\ndifference in ability. Both my friend and I believe that Mike\u2019s\npants are aflame, and both of us desire that Mike drop to the ground\nand roll around. But Mike has the ability to make that happen, while\nAndy lacks that ability (at least directly\u2014Andy can do things\nlike shout at Mike in an effort to induce dropping and rolling); so\nMike does it and Andy doesn\u2019t. Cappelen and Dever suggest that\none can explain all the differences in action here without invoking\nself-locating self-representations at any point.\n\nOne might be dubious that such an explanatory strategy can be\nsuccessfully executed all the way through\u2014can we really tell the\nwhole story of an action without invoking self-locating\nrepresentation at any stage? Will this work across all examples of\nhuman action, and all action descriptions we might be inclined to use?\n(See Torre 2018 and Ninan 2016 for doubts on each front.)\nThere\u2019s also a tricky question here about argumentative burdens,\nand what\u2019s required to discharge them. Suppose it\u2019s\ngranted that there could be agents\u2014like Cappelen and\nDever\u2019s god\u2014who performed intentional actions without\npossessing any self-locating doxastic attitudes. One might still\nmaintain that real-life humans employ self-locating representations in\ntheir practical deliberations, and perhaps that we are wired up so as\nto be incapable of intentionally acting without invoking self-locating\nattitudes. (Indexicals might not be essential for\nall agents, but self-locating attitudes might be\nessential for us.)\n\nIs this an empirical question about human agential psychology? (And\nare there interesting, related questions about animals and infants?)\nOr could we argue for self-locating attitudes on the grounds that\nincluding them in our theory of mind makes that theory simpler, more\nunified, and more fruitful? When we look not just at immediate action\ngeneration, but across the whole spectrum of an agent\u2019s\npractical deliberation\u2014her hopes, plans, goals, and\naspirations\u2014there certainly seems to be a disproportionate focus\non how events affect one particular individual, and what that\nindividual is capable of. The various motivational stories we\u2019ve\ncited suggest that that individual\u2019s experiences and abilities\nfactor into her cognitive architecture in ways that others\u2019\nexperiences and abilities don\u2019t (or don\u2019t nearly as\nfrequently), and in ways that explain her actions without explaining\nthe actions of others (or explaining them in the same way). Perhaps\ntheories of mind are possible that account for all these patterns of\nsimilarity and difference without postulating self-locating beliefs.\nBut it may also be that theories of self-locating belief are the best\nexplanations of these phenomena currently on offer.\n",
