    "main_text": "Charmides\n14. Charmides\n\nThe main theme of this dialogue is the role of knowledge in the virtue\nunder discussion. A dialogue of definition, the Charmides\ntakes up the subject of sophrosune, a word that does not have\na clear equivalent in English. It is the virtue of having a morally\nhealthy soul, undamaged by wrongdoing, and nourished by knowledge or\nwisdom. Sophrosune produces the ability to resist the\ntemptation to act violently in satisfaction of desires, the temptation\nthat, in Plato\u2019s scheme of things, characteristically leads\ntyrants to disaster. But sophrosune is not the same as\nself-control (enkrateia), which presupposes a division in the\nsoul into a part that controls and a part that is controlled. \n\nTranslation. Sophrosune has been rendered as temperance,\nself-control, sound-mindedness, and discipline. Integrity is preferred\nby the author of this article, since the Socrates of these dialogues\nemphasizes the wholeness or undivideness of the healthy soul\n(Gorgias 482b and 506e-507a, cf. 475e-476a with\nRepublic 1.352a).\n\nDates and historical background. The dramatic date appears to be\nbefore the birth of Plato. The main characters aside from Socrates are\nCharmides (a teenager at the time) and Plato\u2019s relative Critias.\nBy the time Plato wrote the dialogue, both men had been killed in the\nbattle of the Piraeus, in 403BCE. Critias had been the leader of the\ngroup known to their enemies as the Thirty Tyrants, and Charmides had\nbeen among the extended leadership established by the Thirty. The\nexcesses of the Thirty, who had conducted a violent and rapacious\nreign of terror in 404\u201303, provide an historical counterpoint to\nthe declared interest of these men in sophrosune almost\nthirty years earlier.\n\nThe topic arises when Charmides is praised for both external and\ninternal good qualities, including sophrosune.\nSocrates assumes that Charmides must have some sense of what this\nvirtue is, if he has it within him (158e). Charmides answers first\nthat sophrosune is a kind of quietness and order\n(159b); indeed, he has a reputation for sophrosune\nbecause of his quiet and orderly good manners. This fails because\nsophrosune is among those things that are always\nkalon (fine), and quietness is fine only in certain contexts.\nThe relevant condition on definition in this case is that of\nexclusion; the proposed explanation does not exclude things that are\nnot sophron. Charmides\u2019 second attempt fails by the\nsame criterion: a sense of shame looks like\nsophrosune in some contexts, but it appears not\nalways to be a good thing (160e\u2013161b). His third attempt is\nplagiarized, probably from Critias, who may have heard it from\nSocrates: sophrosune is doing one\u2019s own things\n(a phrase identical to that used in the Republic to define\njustice). Charmides is unable to explain what this means. Critias\ntakes over, in order to defend his definition, and is led to gloss it\nas doing good things (163e).\n\nSocrates then introduces the issue of knowledge, which Critias agrees\nis necessary to the exercise of sophrosune. But\nknowledge of what? Critias suggests that it is self-knowledge that is\nsophrosune (164d). Critias has in mind the kind of\nself-knowledge that consists in knowing what one knows and what one\ndoes not know. From this it is a short step to defining the virtue as\nthe knowledge of itself and the other kinds of knowledge\u2014i.e.,\nthe knowledge that enables one to evaluate all sorts of knowledge\nclaims (166e). Socrates raises two questions about this kind of\nknowledge: whether it is possible, and whether it is beneficial\n(relevant because the virtue was assumed to be beneficial). It would\nseem impossible for there to be such a kind of knowledge, since all\nother examples of kinds of knowledge have subject matter specific to\neach, and this would be an exception. To know whether a candidate has\nknowledge of medicine, for example, one would need to know medicine.\nAs for the question of benefit, it would appear that such knowledge is\nbeneficial (173a, ff.), because it would allow us to submit all\ndecisions to knowledge. But the appearance is deceptive, because the\nknowledge of knowledge does not add anything to the various kinds of\nknowledge (such as medicine) on which we depend.\n\nThe kind of knowledge that would be most beneficial would be knowledge\nof good and evil (174b, ff.), but this is not the same thing as\nsophrosune. So this line of inquiry has led to the\ncontrary results that the virtue in question is and is not beneficial.\nThe speakers confess aporia (an impasse) and pledge to\ncontinue. Critias and Charmides threaten to use force to wrest\ncontinuing education from Socrates. This is a joke, but it comes with\na disturbing historical irony, because Charmides will follow Critias\ninto a leadership position in the regime of the Thirty Tyrants. Their\nuse of force will terrorize the people, but not achieve what Critias\nwants in the long run.\n\nAs with other aporetic dialogues, we are left without a clear answer.\nAs with Laches and Euthyphro, however, the inquiry\nhas led to a suggestion that goes beyond defining one among a number\nof independent virtues to investigating something of unbounded ethical\nimportance, the knowledge of good and evil.
