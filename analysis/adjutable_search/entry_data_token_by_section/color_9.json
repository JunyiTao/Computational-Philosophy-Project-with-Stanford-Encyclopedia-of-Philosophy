    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Color Eliminativism/Irrealism/Fictionalism\n2.3 Color Eliminativism/Irrealism/Fictionalism\n\nThere is a group of views about color, which come under one or all of\nthe labels, Color Irrealism, Color Eliminativism, Color Fictionalism.\nThese titles are a little misleading, since some theorists also talk\nof there being colors in the sense of being dispositions to cause\nexperiences of a characteristic type, and/or being (attributes in/of)\nsensations. Following our earlier discussion, in\n section 1.2,\n we may take it that what the color-Eliminativist is denying is that\nmaterial objects and lights have colors of a certain kind: colors that\nwe ordinarily and unreflectingly take the bodies to have. That is to\nsay, these views are usually committed to an \u201cError\ntheory\u201d of visual color experience. Indeed the theories are\noften referred to as \u201cError theories\u201d of color. Prominent\ncontemporary defenders of variants of this view are Hardin (1988),\nBoghossian & Velleman (1989), Averill (2005), and Maund (1995,\n2006, 2011). Earlier defenders were Galileo, Descartes, Locke and\nothers. \n\nThe most general argument for Color Irrealism/Eliminativism is\naddressed to the ordinary conception of color (and the use of ordinary\ncolor terms.) The argument, in brief is that Color Primitivism gets it\nright about the kinds of properties colors are:simple, qualitative,\nintrinsic properties, typically possessed by surfaces of material\nbodies. Only, material bodies do not actually have them. Thus there\nare two crucial steps in the argument for Color Irrealism/Eliminativism: the first\nis to argue that bodies do not actually have the sort of colors\ndescribed by Primitivism; the second is to argue against Reductive\nColor Physicalism and Color Dispostionalism. The second step is to the\neffect that these theories are phenomenally inadequate, as well as\nfailing to account for a range of color phenomena.\n\nNeither the properties posited by the Primitivist, nor those posited\nby the Color Physicalist, it is argued, can satisfy all the required\nconstraints for being colors. As we saw in the last two sections, both\nsorts of theorists have a response to this objection. The debate\nbetween the Color Eliminativists and their opponents will thus depend\non the plausibility of such responses, and counter-responses (see the\nearlier sections\n 2.1,\n 2.2). As far as Primitivist Realism is concerned, one central\nissue is this. The defense of this position, it seems, would need to\nappeal to some version of Na\u00efve Realism, and/or Disjunctivism,\nand there are strong arguments against these accounts. For example, it\nis not clear how these accounts can handle the fact that many of our\nexperiences have both veridical and illusory elements: the Muller-Lyer\nlines look unequal, when they are not; but they also look thin, and\nlook to be in front of me, and look black (see the entry on\n perception: the disjunctivist theory of perception).\n Another important issue is the one Hardin (2004, 2008) and Cohen\n(2009) raise: that it depends on some non-arbitrary identification of\nstandard conditions, and normal observers, one that cannot be\nsatisfied (see\n section 2.1,\n above).\n\nMost versions of Color Eliminativism/Irrealism commit one to an error\ntheory of visual experience. As Boghossian and Velleman (1989 [1997:\n93]) put it: \u201cvisual experience is ordinarily naively realistic,\nin the sense that the qualities presented in it are represented as\nqualities of the external world\u201d (see also Averill 2005 and\nMaund 2011). This leads them to explain how this happens by adopting a\nProjectivist account of color experience:\n\n\nThe projection posited by this account has the result that the\nintentional content of visual experience represents external objects\nas possessing qualities that belong, in fact, only to regions of the\nvisual field. By \u201cgilding or staining all natural objects with\nthe colors borrowed from internal sentiments\u201d, as Hume puts it,\nthe mind \u201craises in a manner a new creation\u201d. (Boghossian\n& Velleman 1989 [1997: 95]) \n\n\nIn ordinary color experience, it is implied, physical objects are\nrepresented (or presented) as having certain qualities that are\nillusory, and accordingly, that experience involve errors. It is\nimportant to keep in mind that such claims are not simply negative.\nIllusions and errors can serve positive functions. The claim that\nexperiences represent objects as having qualities with a certain\ncharacter, can explain why we form the concepts we do, why we identify\nand recognize objects, and so on. This means that it is still the case\nthat there are important reasons for retaining our ordinary color\nconcepts, even though they are not actualized. This fact motivates the\nthought that the proper attitude to adopt towards our color language\nis a fictionalist one: for many purposes we should think of the color\nsentences with their ordinary meaning\u2014but treat them only as if they are\ntrue (see Gatzia 2007, 2008).\n\nBeing an error theory of visual experience, Color Eliminativism is\nsometimes thought to leave us with a severe problem (see Byrne &\nHilbert 2007a). If there are\nno properties that satisfy the requirements for being colors: how did\nthe ordinary concept develop? A plausible answer to this problem is\nfound in the fact that the way that the concepts of color operate, to\nserve their various functions and roles, is through the way colors\nappear. For these purposes and roles, objects do not need to have\ncolors. It will be sufficient if they appear to have them. For these\npurposes, it is sufficient that \u201cit is as if they have the\ncolors\u201d. We should also bear in mind that errors and illusions\nand misrepresentations can be beneficial and not deleterious,\nespecially if the errors are systematic. Consider, for example, the\nhighly useful illusions that mirrors produce. Part of the point of\nProjectivist theories of color experience is that the errors are\nsystematic ones. Putting it crudely, tomatoes give us, regularly the\nsame kind of error, just as bananas give us their distinctive kind of\nerror. Angela Mendelovici has developed an account of reliable\nmisrepresentation. Interestingly, she argues that one of the\nobjections to tracking theories of representation, favored by\nReductive Color Physicalists, is that they cannot explain reliable\nmisrepresentation.\n\nFinally, the reason why color vision evolved might be quite complex.\nAkins and Hahn (2014) have a long, detailed, paper about the\nevolutionary implications of color vision. They argue the reasons\noften assumed doesn\u2019t stack up: they are based on the notion\nthat the function of color vision is \u201cto detect the\ncolors\u201d. Things are far more complex, they argue.\n",
