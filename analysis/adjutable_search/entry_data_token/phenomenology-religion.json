The phenomenology of religious experience\n\nCommentators on religious experience disagree on the significance of\nphenomenological considerations. Is there a phenomenology that is\ndistinctive of religious experience? And if there is, do we have a\nreliable vocabulary to describe it? Is there a phenomenology of\nmystical experience which crosses faith boundaries? Or are such\nexperiences saturated with tradition-specific doctrinal assumptions?\nAre reports of religious experiences in central cases best read as\ndoctrine-inspired interpretations of the subjective character of the\nexperience, rather than as accounts of their phenomenology? And does\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience do any epistemic\nwork? Let\u2019s consider some of these issues.\n1.1 Religious experience as encounter with God\n\nWilliam Alston (1991, Chapter 1) has noted that we don\u2019t have a\nwell-developed vocabulary for the description of the phenomenal qualia\nof \u201cmystical\u201d experience. (Compare William James\u2019s\nsuggestion that \u201cmystical\u201d experiences are\n\u201cineffable\u201d: 1902, p. 380.) If someone takes God\u2019s\ngoodness to be displayed in, say, a mountain landscape, then the\nphenomenology of their experience can perhaps be set down easily\nenough, at least in some central respects; but what about the case\nwhere an experience is said to be more directly of God (the case that\nAlston intends to pick out by the expression \u201cmystical\nperception\u201d)? Alston suggests that our inability to describe the\nelements of such experiences from a phenomenological point of view\ndoes not imply that they lack a distinctive phenomenology, or that\nthey fail to be directed at some mind-independent reality, in rather\nthe way that sense experiences are.\n\nWe lack a relevant vocabulary, he argues, because we cannot construct\nany simple correlation between a range of \u201cstimulus\nconditions\u201d for mystical perception and the kinds of experience\nthat are likely to arise under those conditions. And therefore we\ncannot refine a vocabulary for the description of mystical experience\nby replication of relevant conditions and renewed attention to the\nphenomenology of the experiences that occur under those conditions. By\ncontrast, there is in general no difficulty in specifying the\nphenomenology of an experience of, say, turning one\u2019s face into\na breeze, because it is easy to recreate the stimulus conditions for\nsuch an experience, and we can therefore attend repeatedly to the\ncharacter of the experience. And since others can also do this, we can\nestablish a public language for the description of such\nexperiences.\n\nThis difficulty in identifying the stimulus conditions for mystical\nperception in no way impugns its epistemic worth, Alston thinks,\nbecause God is said to be a personal reality, and an experience of\nGod\u2019s presence cannot be brought about, therefore, in some\nrelatively mechanical way, simply by creating an appropriate set of\nsensory or other conditions. (Compare O\u2019Hear 1984, Chapter 2.)\nSo given what we mean by \u201cGod,\u201d it is only to be expected\nthat mystical perception will fail to yield a vocabulary that will\nallow us to specify at all precisely a correlative phenomenology. In\nother words, even if (perhaps especially if) mystical perception is\nveridical, we should not expect to have such a vocabulary.\nAccordingly, the absence of the vocabulary cannot be thought to\nconstitute an objection to the good epistemic standing of such\nexperiences.\n\nNotwithstanding these considerations, Alston and other commentators\nhave noted that in the Christian mystical tradition anyway there is,\nin fact, quite a well developed vocabulary for describing the\nsubjective quality of such experiences. This vocabulary is modelled on\nthat of ordinary sense perception. So there are \u201cspiritual\nsensations\u201d of touch, sight, taste, smell and hearing that are\ntaken to be in some way analogous to their counterparts in ordinary\nsense perception. As Nelson Pike (1992) notes, this tradition has\ncommonly distinguished three varieties of experience of God: those\nassociated with the \u201cprayer of quiet,\u201d the \u201cprayer\nof union,\u201d and \u201crapture,\u201d in order of increasing\nintimacy of acquaintance with God. And each of these phases of the\nspiritual life, it has been said, is to be associated with its own\ndistinctive phenomenology.\n\nFor example, speaking of the \u201cprayer of quiet,\u201d Pike\ncomments that in such experiences\n\nphenomenologically, God is located in that place within the body where\none normally experiences oneself to be. \u2026 the spiritual\nsensations involved are akin to ordinary auditory and olfactory\nperceptions as well as to ordinary perceptions of heat. They do not\ninclude sensations akin to those associated with inside or outside\ntouch or to those connected with taste. (1992, p. 159)\n\n\nOf course, even this vocabulary can only carry a person so far towards\nan understanding of the phenomenology of the experiences that are here\nbeing described, because the vocabulary is, after all, only patterned\non that which applies in ordinary sense experience. So to ascertain\nmore exactly the nature of these \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d it\nwould be necessary to experience them firsthand (Pike 1992, p. 161).\nNonetheless, the convergence of mystical testimony upon some such set\nof descriptions gives us a reason to think that these experiences,\nlike ordinary sense experiences, can be ordered in ways that admit of\na degree of inter-personal confirmation \u2014 and that there is a\nkind of correlation between the \u201cangle of view\u201d one takes\nup in relation to the purported object of the experience\n(corresponding to one\u2019s progression through the spiritual life,\nand one\u2019s degree of closeness to God) and the phenomenology of\nthe associated experience. (For further discussion of the\n\u201cspiritual senses\u201d tradition, see Gavrilyuk and Coakley\n2012, and Aquino and Gavrilyuk 2022.)\n\nThese observations suggest another response to the objection that\nmystical perception is epistemically defective because we lack a\nreliable vocabulary for the description of the phenomenology of such\nexperiences. On the contrary, it may be said, there is such a\nvocabulary, albeit that it is not as developed or its full meaning as\ngenerally accessible as the vocabulary that we use for the description\nof the phenomenology of ordinary sensory experience.\n\nSome commentators have sought to distinguish between the component of\na report of a religious experience that is a record of its\nphenomenology and the component that involves an interpretation of the\nexperience according to some favoured doctrinal scheme (Stace 1961).\nAs Pike notes, it is possible in principle that whole traditions of\nmystical experience have been more concerned to communicate the\ndoctrinal implications of such experience rather than its\nphenomenological content (1992, p. 174), and that they have adopted a\nvocabulary for talking about the experiences that will suit this\npurpose. But in light of the language of \u201cspiritual\nsensations\u201d we may (with Pike) doubt that this is the right way\nto understand the Christian mystical tradition. At least some strands\nof this tradition seem to display a keen interest in recording the\nphenomenology of various experiences. (See Turner 1995 for a\ncontrasting, non-experientialist reading of Christian mystical\nwriting.)\n\nAnd there is a ready \u201cspiritual\u201d explanation of why there\nshould be such an interest: so that the believer can track their\nprogress through the spiritual life. Where the \u201cordinary\nbeliever\u201d is concerned, such progress is not likely to involve\nsome abstractly intellectual kind of achievement, and on some\napproaches anyway, it is not likely to involve some new proximity to\nGod that can be specified independently of changes in the\nphenomenology of one\u2019s experience. So in these cases, the\nphenomenology serves to reassure the believer of their growing\ncloseness to God.\n\nSuch an approach can admit of corruptions, as when the believer seeks\nout certain exalted experiences, and takes pride in them because they\nare thought to signify intimacy with God, or perhaps takes pleasure in\nthem simply because of their thrilling or in other ways pleasing\nphenomenological feel. David Pugmire (1998) speaks of\n\u201cdramaturgical\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic\u201d cases of\nemotional experience where, respectively, the emotion is taken to\nsignify one\u2019s superior status in some respect, or where it is\nvalued because of its pleasant phenomenological feel. And we might\nthink of some religious experiences in similar terms. However, these\ncases are presumably corruptions, and the tradition that has evolved\nthe language of \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d need not as such\nhave any tendency to value religious experience for these reasons.\n\nIndeed, in so far as spiritual sensations are prized for these reasons\n\u2014 because of their phenomenological feel or as a way of\nunderwriting a person\u2019s sense of their own importance \u2014\nthen they will be religiously defective (given the religious\nimportance of the virtue of humility for example); and they are also\nlikely to be epistemically defective, because of the suspicion that\nthe believer, whether consciously or not, is engineering the\nproduction of such experiences for the advantages that they confer in\nthese respects. It is in part for these reasons that there exists a\nvery broadly based tradition of testing religious experiences by their\nfruits in practice. An experience that fails to issue in a livelier\nregard for the interests of one\u2019s neighbour, for example, is to\nthat extent disconfirmed on religious grounds (Alston 1991, pp.\n250\u2013254).\n\nIt is worth noting, with Pike, that even if a description of a\nreligious experience employs a relatively theoretical or\nmetaphysically loaded vocabulary, rather than simply using the\nlanguage of sensation, it does not follow that this is an\ninterpretation of the experience rather than an attempt to communicate\nits phenomenological content: it may be, for example, that one\u2019s\nexperience is as of being appeared to by a very powerful spiritual\nbeing, rather than simply a matter of certain sensations of heat,\ntouch or whatever being undergone, which are then interpreted on the\nbasis of some doctrinal scheme.\n\nSome commentators have argued on the contrary that the theistic\nmeaning of an experience cannot be given directly in its\nphenomenology, since \u201cit\u2019s God\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s\nomnipotent\u201d can never be part of the phenomenology of an\nexperience but must involve some interpretation of the phenomenology\n(Forgie 1984 and Zangwill 2004). Whatever stance one takes here, it\nwill be necessary to acknowledge that in ordinary sense experience we\ncommonly recognise someone without reliance upon inference, rather\nthan starting from some set of minimally interpreted sensations\n(patches of colour and so on) and inferring that the presence of this\nperson in particular would best explain these phenomena.\n\nSome scholars have sought to apply the distinction between experience\nand interpretation to theistic mysticism in particular, arguing that\ntheistic mystical experiences have the same content as non-theistic\nmystical experiences, and are just differently interpreted and\nreported, because in all cases mystical experience is experience of\n\u201cundifferentiated unity\u201d (Stace 1961, p. 236). (The\nthought is that mystics who are orthodox theists have had to reckon\nwith the teaching that there is an ineradicable ontological\ndistinction between creature and creator, and this requirement has\nshaped their reports.) And some have wondered whether\n\u201cintrovertive\u201d mystical experiences in all traditions (as\ndistinct from \u201cextrovertive\u201d mystical experiences, where\nmaterial objects are experienced as one) are devoid of any\nphenomenological content, in so far as \u201cwhat emerges is a state\nof pure consciousness: \u2018pure\u2019 in the sense that it is not\nthe consciousness of any empirical content. It has no content except\nitself\u201d (Stace, p. 86). It is tempting to represent such\nexperiences in these terms in part, no doubt, because any attribution\nof a phenomenological content to an experience is likely to imply a\nsubject-object structure (to imply some account of how something\nseemed to the subject of the experience), so contradicting the\npurported, non-dualistic content of an introvertive mystical\nexperience. (Compare Plotinus on union with the One in\nEnneads VI.9.11.)\n\nOther commentators have rejected the idea that mystics across\ntraditions have experiences that are subjectively the same, but just\ndifferently reported. On the contrary, they say, the categories of a\nfaith tradition will make a difference not simply to the ways in which\nexperiences are reported, but to the character of the experience\nitself (Katz 1978).\n\nJohn Hick\u2019s (1989) study is a particularly influential\napplication of this Kantian sort of perspective within the domain of\nreligious experience. Hick argues that religious experiences are\nstructured according to tradition-specific sets of religious concepts.\nOn this view, all the major faiths offer a way of encountering one and\nthe same ultimate religious reality \u2014 but Christians encounter\nthis reality, in their religious experience, in Trinitarian mode,\nwhile Hindus encounter it as Brahman, and so on.\n\nHick is clear that this is not a matter of the advocates of the\nvarious faiths having an experience whose phenomenological content is\nmuch the same across the traditions, but just differently interpreted\nand differently reported; rather, tradition-specific concepts (such as\nthose of the Trinity and Brahman) enter into the content of the\nexperience. Analogously, we might say that there is a sense in which a\nnewborn infant and I have the same experience when we look out upon a\nroom of tables and chairs, in so far as the same image is imprinted on\nour retinas; but we would presumably wish to say that the\nphenomenology of these experiences remains quite different even so,\nand that only I have an experience that seems to be of tables and\nchairs, and in which my visual field is organised accordingly (so that\nregions of colour are sorted into table- and chair-like\nconfigurations).\n\nThis account of religious experience and the contribution of doctrine\nin shaping its phenomenology sits very well with Hick\u2019s\npluralistic reading of the major faiths. On this view, these\ntraditions are all valid in so far as all provide a vehicle for the\nexperience of ultimate religious reality or what Hick terms \u201cthe\nReal\u201d (an expression that is intended to be neutral between the\nvarious designations for this reality that are favoured by the\ndifferent traditions). And the traditions are indeed all equally valid\nin so far as there can be no question of the doctrinal content of any\none tradition\u2019s experience of the Real corresponding more\nclosely to the character of the Real \u201cin itself\u201d; rather,\nthe doctrinal content of such experiences derives in every case from\nthe side of culture or a person\u2019s religious formation, rather\nthan mapping the character of the Real in itself. Identifying the\nintrinsic character of the Real is beyond the scope of any human\nenquiry. Instead, we have to make do with appearances of the Real,\nwhere these appearances vary with the culturally constituted ways of\nbeing religious that are made available in the various faiths.\n\nOf course, this picture invites the objection that a culturally\nreductionist account of religious experience is surely then to be\npreferred: if the phenomenological content of religious experience is\nfixed in all its detail by a person\u2019s socio-religious context,\nthen why not think of such experience as simply a cultural product,\nrather than as having some culture-transcendent reference (Stoeber\n1992)? To shore up the claim of religious experience to connect the\nbeliever to a mind-independent reality we require, rather, some sort\nof convergence across traditions concerning the nature of the reality\nthat is revealed in such experiences \u2014 instead of Hick\u2019s\nrigorously agnostic (and therefore tradition-neutral) affirmation that\nthe Real in itself eludes all our categories, and so cannot be\nconsidered as personal or impersonal, one or many, or even good or\nevil. (Compare Byrne 1995.)\n\nHick\u2019s approach might also seem to be in trouble for more\nstraightforwardly religious reasons: as he notes, most believers\nprivilege the picture of the sacred that is favoured in their own\ntradition (rather than thinking of that picture as simply another way\nof representing an appearance of the Real). And perhaps this is\nreligiously necessary. If believers thought that their religious\nsymbols, and in turn the content of their religious experience, lacked\nany ultimate reference (since these symbols are concerned simply with\nthe realm of appearances), then it may be doubted whether they would\nbe adequately motivated to live religiously: if religious symbols are\ninterpreted in this agnostic way, and if the phenomenology of\nreligious experience fails therefore to track in any respect the\ncharacter of the Real in itself, then how is the Real to be\nintelligibly the object of a response of, say, love and faith, rather\nthan simply of bafflement or perhaps indifference?\n\nSo philosophical treatments of the phenomenology of religious\nexperience draw quite diverse conclusions: religious experience (in at\nleast some central cases) is said variously to have no\nphenomenological content (not to be like anything), or to have a\ncontent that at any rate cannot be communicated readily in verbal\nterms, or to have a phenomenological content that can be described\nbecause it is analogous to the \u201csensational\u201d quality of\nordinary sensory experience, where this content can then be\ninterpreted in doctrinal terms, or to have a phenomenological content\nthat is given in the doctrinal scheme of the relevant faith tradition,\nwhere this scheme functions rather like a lens through which religious\nreality is viewed, or to have a phenomenological content that never\ncomes clearly into view in public discourse, since reports of such\nexperiences typically focus upon the implied doctrinal meaning of the\nexperience which is, on this account, to be sharply distinguished from\nits phenomenological content.\n\nThese disputes sometimes have a relatively conceptual character, and\nsometimes are rooted more clearly in questions about how to read\nvarious bodies of documentary evidence. As we have seen, a\nperson\u2019s stance on these matters may well make a difference to\ntheir approach to other issues: including the question of whether\nreligious experience is discredited by the difficulties in describing\nits phenomenological content, and the questions of whether we should\nfavour a pluralist account of the faiths or a reductionist reading of\nreligious experience.\n1.2 Religious experience and relationship to material context\n\nSo far we have been concentrating upon religious experience understood\nas experience of God or the sacred otherwise understood. Some\ncommentators have argued that the philosophy of religion literature\nhas paid insufficient attention to the fact that, in the first\ninstance, religious experience is commonly experience of a material\ncontext, a building or landscape for example. And the phenomenology of\nthe experience is therefore given, at least in significant part, in\nour experience of a set of physical objects (Brown 2004).\n\nOn this sort of approach, religious experience is sometimes conceived\nnot so much as an encounter with God considered as a particular item\nof experience, but more as a matter of seeing \u201cin depth\u201d\nthe religious significance of a material context. If we take up this\nsuggestion, then a new range of possibilities for developing a\nphenomenology of religion comes into view.\n\nSome scholars have argued that spaces reserved for religious activity\nhave a distinctive character, which sets them apart from merely\nprofane spaces (Eliade 1958). For instance, an approach to a sacred\nspace may require the believer to cross various thresholds, and\nperhaps to undertake a relatively arduous journey on account of the\ntopography of the place, as when it is set on a mountain or\nisland.\n\nExpounding this tradition of thought, Thomas Barrie notes that:\n\nTo reach the threshold and sacred place, often there is a path and\nentry sequence. The path that leads to the place can take many forms\n\u2026 and typically involves a series of spaces or events, each\nbecoming increasingly more sacred. This sequence acts as a marker of\nthe sacred ground, as protection for the uninitiated, and as a trial\nto be endured for those seeking the divine. (1996, p. 59)\n\n\nSimilarly Barrie writes of how: \u201cThe pilgrim\u2019s route along\nthe path underlines the gravity of the journey being undertaken and\ngives opportunities for the initiate to turn back\u201d (p. 60).\nImplied in this sort of structuring of sacred space is a correlative\nphenomenology: one that requires of the devotee an appropriate\nseriousness and focussed attention, if they are to grasp aright the\nsacred reality that is to be encountered in the sanctuary. (Compare\nJones 2000 on the various strategies of \u201critual-architectural\nallurement.\u201d)\n\nSome Christian commentators have taken exception to this sort of\npicture, arguing that what makes a place religiously special for a\nChristian is simply the presence there of a Christian community,\nengaged in a life of other-regarding love (White 1995). Acknowledging\nthis difference of view, Harold Turner (1979) distinguishes between\nthe domus dei and domus ecclesiae approaches to sacred architecture.\nOn the first perspective, a holy building is conceived as a house of\nGod, and it should therefore be a suitably imposing space, displaying\nsuperior craftsmanship and adorned with the finest materials \u2014\nall of which will imply a correlative phenomenology, whereby the mind\nis lifted up towards God. (Compare Abbot Suger\u2019s account of the\nabbey of Saint Denis.) By contrast, on the domus ecclesiae\nperspective, the church building functions primarily as a meeting\nplace, and its construction should therefore serve the needs of the\ncommunity which gathers there, and facilitate their interaction and\nfellowship.\n\nTurner gives as an example of the domus dei approach the meditation\nroom at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. This space\nfeatures a block of iron ore illuminated by a shaft of natural light\nthat descends from a skylight. Accordingly, the place speaks of a\nmeeting of heaven and earth, of light and dark, and of the ambiguous\nhistory of human beings in their relationship to the earth, in so far\nas iron ore has been used for the making both of weapons and of\nploughshares. And by virtue of the conditions of stillness and dimmed\nlight that obtain here, the room invites a response of quiet,\nreverential seriousness. In all of these respects there is implied,\nonce more, a correlative phenomenology.\n\nIn fact, the relationship between the conception of sacred\narchitecture that Barrie describes and Turner\u2019s domus ecclesiae\ntradition need not be flatly antithetical. For Turner acknowledges\nthat even within a Christian context it will be appropriate to make\nsome use of \u201ctemple\u201d elements, not least for those members\nof the community who have not yet fully assimilated a Christian\nunderstanding of these matters. And more importantly, even a building\nthat adheres uncompromisingly to domus ecclesiae principles will over\ntime take on some of the characteristics of the domus dei ideal\n\u2014 because even when it is not in use for worship, the fact that\nit has been organically caught up in the life of the Christian\ncommunity will quite properly condition our sense of its significance,\nand the sort of use to which it can be put.\n\nHere Turner notes the experience of a young Quaker who contrary to his\nprofessed principles admits to feeling that he ought not to smoke\nwithin the meeting house when he is taking his turn on the cleaning\nrota. This response is fitting, Turner notes, in so far as the history\nof the building as a site of Christian gathering rightly shapes our\nsense of its meaning in the present (pp. 327\u2013328). And this\nsense of the building\u2019s significance will imply a correlative\nphenomenology: the space will be experienced as inviting a respectful\nor dignified kind of appropriation.\n\nOn the other side, Barrie notes that while the sacred place is set\napart as a zone where the gods may be encountered, this is not to say\nthat such places have no part to play in the life of a community. On\nthe contrary, sacred spaces will typically serve as an important focus\nfor a community\u2019s profession of the values that bind it together\n(1996, p. 52).\n\nSome Christian commentators have sought to identify a similar middle\nground by acknowledging that Christian categories, and the Christian\nliturgy, are likely to be experienced as strange or even alien by many\nin modern western societies. The evangelisation of such people may\nwell depend then, in the first instance, not so much upon exposure to\nspecifically Christian concepts as upon experiences of transcendence\nmediated through encounters with the beauty or majesty of the natural\nworld, or of church or other buildings. These experiences serve then\nas a propaedeutic for Christian teaching. (Compare Brown 2004, pp.\n407\u2013408.)\n\nIt is reasonable to suppose, for example, that the religious\nsignificance of the great cathedrals of the medieval period was not\njust a matter of the Christian stories with which they were\nassociated, in so far as they were connected with, say, the deeds of\nparticular holy figures or their relics. Their meaning is also given\nin their sheer sensory impact: through their monumental scale and\ncontrolled use of light, and through the interplay between the\nsolidity of stone and the diaphanous qualities of glass, these\nstructures can speak of the sacred by inducing a response of hushed\nwonderment. A further perspective on the phenomenology of liturgy is\nprovided in the work of Dietrich von Hildebrand, who is interested in\nthe connection between the formation of the person through liturgical\npractice and the development of new ways of engaging with the everyday\nworld in perceptual and other terms. See for instance his comment\nthat:\n\n\nThe man formed by the Liturgy is the man who is awake in the highest\nsense of the word. He is not only inwardly open to hearing the voice\nof God. He is not only aware of the ultimate Truth, but he also looks\non all earthly goods in their true light. Far removed from all\nbluntness, \"indifference,\" stoic insensibility and impassiveness, his\nawakened eye is open to every created thing in its mystery of the\nheight and its divine meaning. Let us recall again the precious and\nnoble character of created things, such as water, for instance, as\ndisclosed in the blessing of the baptismal water. (1943, pp.\n136-7)\n\n\nOf course natural spaces are also able, of themselves, to evoke a\nsense of the sacred. And Erazim Koh\u00e1k has argued that some of\nthe key concepts of western philosophical theology have their original\nlife setting in experiences of nature. On this basis he offers a kind\nof phenomenological rendering of the cosmological and design\narguments.\n\nHe writes for example that:\n\nWe are, though only by a hair. We could easily not be. The stark white\nglow of the January moon, pressing down on the frozen forest, sears\naway the illusion of necessity. (1984, p. 188)\n\n\nHere, Koh\u00e1k is giving a phenomenological counterpart for the\nconcept of contingency. Of course, he does not think that what results\nis a newly cogent form of the cosmological argument: he is not giving\nan argument at all. What he is doing, we might say, is to bring out\nthe religious resonance of the concept of contingency: the role of the\nconcept is not simply to signify the possibility of not-being but,\nwhen appropriated in the way he describes, to draw us into a life of\n\u201cthanksgiving\u201d. As he says, solitude, and being free from\nthe feeling of technological mastery that is characteristic of urban\nlife, \u201cteaches thanks\u201d (p. 188).\n\nSimilarly Koh\u00e1k comments that\n\nThe natural world, abandoned by a human dweller, does not disintegrate\ninto a meaningless aggregate. It may seem that way as the ridge of the\nabandoned barn sags and caves in\u2026 That, though, is only the\nhuman order of passing. \u2026 The nature abandoned by humans is yet\nnot abandoned. It is not simply that it is lawlike in performance,\nmanifesting observed regularities. Its order is far more intimate than\nthat. It is the order of a sphere of mineness. (1984, p. 189)\n\n\nStandard versions of the argument from design, when they appeal to the\nworld\u2019s lawlikeness, do not require any reference to the\nphenomenology of human experience. But, here, Koh\u00e1k is giving a\nphenomenological rendering of the concept of order, and seeking to\nroot our sense of the divine presence in this more\n\u201cintimate,\u201d phenomenologically informed understanding of\nthe world\u2019s regularity.\n\nAgain, as with the concept of contingency, his concern is to bring out\nthe existential import of the concept of order. When grounded in the\nkind of experience he describes here, order does not just signify\nlawlikeness, a notion that has no particular phenomenological content,\nbut a realm of belonging, a place that has been set in order by\nsomeone, so that it can be inhabited and constitute a home. This way\nof developing the concept points once more to its relevance for\nreligious life: to experience order in these terms is to experience\nGod as present in the world, and as caring for it.\n\nSo we could take Koh\u00e1k to be providing a phenomenological\nrendering of the concept of divine presence. He offers this\ncomparison:\n\nThe house belongs: on entering it, we sense its order not simply as an\norder, but specifically as the order of a Lebenswelt, of an inhabited\ncontext ordered by a caring presence. Trying to cook in a strange\nkitchen brings it home: things have their places, unknown to us, but\nnot arbitrary. The house is a sphere of someone\u2019s mineness. (p.\n189)\n\n\nIt might be said: the content of the concept of divine presence is\nreally given, surely, in standard philosophical and theological\nanalyses of it. To say that God is omnipresent, for example, is to say\nthat God is directly active in all places, or that God has unmediated\nknowledge of, and power over, everything that happens wherever it\nhappens. (See Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 1a. 8. 3 and Swinburne 1993.)\nOn this view, Koh\u00e1k\u2019s observations constitute a kind of\npsychological gloss on the concept: we human beings sometimes register\nthe divine presence in such experiences of \u201cmineness,\u201d but\nthese experiences form no part of the concept.\n\nIt is implied in Koh\u00e1k\u2019s discussion that the experience\nof mineness enters more deeply into our understanding of divine\npresence than this account would suggest. Analogously we might say\nthat if we are to have a full understanding of what it is for\nsomething to be blue, then we require firsthand experience of\nblueness, since someone who has not had this experience will not know\nthis truth about blue: that it is manifest in human experience in this\nway. (Compare the example of Mary, developed in Jackson 1982.)\n\nKoh\u00e1k is suggesting, I think, that our understanding of divine\npresence, or equally of contingency and order, also has some\nphenomenological content: to see in full what it is for God to be\npresent, one needs to have some experiential knowledge of the contexts\nin which the concept of divine presence originates. Or to put the\nmatter otherwise, he is saying that to see in full the religious\nimport of the concepts of order, contingency and divine presence, to\nsee what role they might play in a religious life, it is necessary to\nhave some appreciation of the relevant phenomenology. (This sort of\npoint is often made in the phenomenological literature by saying that\n\u201cempathy\u201d is required if we are to understand the defining\nconcepts of a faith tradition: see Dupre 1998, pp. 36\u201337.)\n\nThere are parallels here with discussion in ethics, where some\ncommentators have supposed, likewise, that a full appreciation of\ncertain cardinal moral concepts depends upon being able to grasp,\nthrough first hand experience, the relevant phenomenology. Raimond\nGaita, for example, argues that our concept of the individuality of\nother persons (in the sense that is relevant when we speak of them as\nbeing from a moral point of view irreplaceable) is not fully\nexpressible independently of reference to the phenomenology of our\nmoral experience. The sense of this concept is given in, for instance,\nthe experience of being haunted by the victim of your wrong-doing,\nwhere it this particular individual who haunts you, rather than some\nrepresentative of humanity in general, or someone whose individuality\ncan be adequately specified simply by reference to, for example, their\ndistinguishing empirical properties (of hair colour, height, or\nwhatever it may be) (1991, p. 51).\n\nIn the same sort of way, Koh\u00e1k is taking the notion of divine\npresence, when it functions in religiously resonant ways, to be rooted\nin certain experiences of the world, so that someone who lacks those\nexperiences will not have the same idea of divine presence. This\nthought might seem to offend against the public character of our\nconcepts. But it is perhaps more a matter of the public meaning of\ncertain concepts being open to deepening relative to experience. Iris\nMurdoch remarks similarly on how a person\u2019s concept of courage\nat the age of twenty is not the same as their concept of courage at\nthe age of forty: life experience contributes to a deepening of the\nconcept (1985, p. 29).\n\nWe have been considering various understandings of the phenomenology\nof religious experience, where religious experience may be construed\nas an encounter with God as a particular entity, or as, in the first\ninstance, an encounter with a material context, given by our built or\nnatural environment or some combination of these. In this latter case,\nit may be that God is manifest not so much as a particular item in the\nperceptual field, but by way of the significance that attaches to a\nmaterial context, rather as, on Koh\u00e1k\u2018s view, our sense\nof the divine presence is grounded in a recognition of the\nsignificance that attaches to the forest as a realm of\n\u201cmineness.\u201d In this way, different emphases in the\nphenomenology of religion are likely to correlate with different\nconceptions of God: not only in so far as a given conception of God\nhas a distinctive phenomenal content, but also in so far as different\nphenomenologies are likely to be associated with different conceptions\nof the sense in which God may be regarded as\n\u201cindividual.\u201d\n2. Emotions and religious experience\n\nMany commentators have thought that the phenomenology of religious\nexperience depends in significant part on its affective tone. When God\nis made known in the experience of guilt, as someone to whom we are\naccountable and who summons us to newness of life, or when God is\nrevealed in the feeling of wonderment at the vastness or beauty of the\ncosmos, or when God is manifest in the experience of encountering some\nthrilling and awe-inspiring \u201cother,\u201d or in many other\ncases too, the religious import of the experience is given in large\npart in our affective responses. It is noteworthy too how often the\nlanguage of \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d involves reference to\nstates of feeling. And perhaps this is a conceptual requirement: what\nsense would there be in the idea of a religiously authentic encounter\nwith God, the supreme good and maker of all, which left the subject of\nthe experience unmoved?\n2.1 Emotional feelings and encounter with God\n\nI say \u201cemotional feelings\u201d in the heading here to\ndistinguish this case from various other uses of feeling language: as\nfor example when we say that we felt something was missing, a usage\nthat may imply no particular phenomenology but only some intuitive\nregistering of an absence, or when we say that we felt a stab of pain,\nwhich will imply some sort of phenomenology but need not suggest the\nkind of directedness that is typical of emotional feelings, as I shall\nsuggest shortly. (Compare Ryle 1971.)\n\nAs with the question of its phenomenology more generally, so there is\ncontroversy surrounding the contribution of emotional feelings, in\nparticular, to the character of religious experience. William Alston\nhas asked: if the phenomenological content of a religious experience\nwere to be purely affective, would that be a reason for doubting that\nit is directed at anything? In that case, he notes, we might well\nsuspect that the experience consists in a felt response to a believed\npresence (1991, pp. 49\u201350), rather than in some presentation of\nGod to the believer.\n\nThis sort of scepticism about the contribution of the emotions to the\nintentionality or God-directedness of religious experience reflects a\ncertain model of their structure, according to which they are\ncomprised of a thought component and a feeling component, where the\nfirst gives rise to the second (as the thought of God\u2019s presence\nis said, in this case, to cause a certain feeling). For example,\nembarrassment on this account will involve the thought (which may be\nsimply entertained rather than asserted) that I have done something\nthat will lower the regard in which I am held by others \u2014 where\nthis thought gives rise to a feeling of a broadly negative nature,\ninvolving some sort of pain, discomfort or distress (and depending on\nthe model, the particular character of this feeling may be taken to be\nrelative to embarrassment or kindred emotions, or understood in more\ngeneric terms) (see Budd 1985, Chapter 1).\n\nSo on this standard account, emotion types can be differentiated by\nreference to the thoughts of which they are comprised. Or where two\nemotions have the same thought content, they can be differentiated by\nreference to the state of feeling that is engendered by the thought,\nas when we treat pity and schadenfreude as distinct emotion types,\nsince they involve different felt responses to the thought of someone\nelse\u2019s misfortune.\n\nThis account of the emotions allows that they are directed at the\nworld. So they are not, on this view, to be assimilated to mere\nstomach churnings or twinges or throbbings: they have some sort of\nintellectual content, and they involve more, therefore, than simply a\nregistering in feeling of some physiological disturbance. (Compare\nagain the case of embarrassment: this is not just a matter of feeling\nflushed, and so on.) On this point then, this account locates\nemotional experience more firmly within our intellectual life than did\nthe late nineteenth century and early twentieth century account,\nassociated with William James and others, which treated the emotions\nsimply as ways of recording changes in physiological condition (James\n1884). However, it remains true on this perspective that the\ndirectedness of the emotions is a function of their thought content,\nwhich is understood in distinction from their feeling content.\n\nSome more recent theories have wanted to challenge this distinction,\nand to regard emotional feelings as themselves forms of thought, or as\nhaving in their own right an intellectual content. This much is often\nimplied in our description of such feelings, as, for example, when we\ncharacterise schadenfreude as a matter of taking pleasure in\nsomeone\u2019s misfortune. This is to represent the pleasure that\narises here as directed at some state of affairs of which it is\ncognisant, rather than supposing simply that the thought of\nsomeone\u2019s misfortune gives rise to a feeling of pleasure.\n\nIf we allow that emotional feelings can have some intellectual content\nin their own right, then we have a powerful tool for understanding how\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience may turn out to be\nintegral to its God-directedness. For example, returning to\nAlston\u2019s concerns regarding the contribution of emotional\nfeelings to the phenomenal content of religious experience, if we take\nemotional feelings to be intrinsically contentful, then we may wish to\nsay that the phenomenology of a religious experience could be purely\naffective without this posing any difficulty for the thought that the\nexperience is directed at some mind-independent reality \u2014 rather\nthan being simply a sensation-like feeling that is caused by the\nthought that God is present.\n\nThe idea that emotional feelings may constitute a mode of perception\nis a familiar theme in recent work in moral philosophy, in the\nwritings of John McDowell (1981) and others. It has also been defended\nby various philosophers of emotion. For example, John Deigh (1994)\nwrites of how our perception of certain qualities may be realised in\nour felt response to them: I may register the scariness of something\nin my feeling of being scared, rather than say in an affect-neutral\nperception of the thing as scary, which then engenders a felt\nresponse. And analogously we might suppose that on occasions anyway,\nGod is made manifest in certain felt responses, rather than being\nknown in some other fashion, which then gives rise to a correlative\nfeeling (as on the thought-plus-feeling model of emotion).\n\nAt least some elements of Rudolf Otto\u2019s The Idea of the\nHoly (1959) lend themselves to an interpretation of this kind.\nHere, Otto speaks of how God is made known primordially as the\nmysterium tremendum et fascinans, as a reality that is at once\nattractive but also inspires a kind of fear or dread. This sort of\ndread, Otto insists, is sui generis: it is a distinctively religious\nkind of fear that befits our relation to God, and while it is akin to\nthe fear we associate with the \u201cweird,\u201d it is not to be\nsimply conflated with this or any other kind of non-religious\nfear.\n\nOtto distinguishes this approach from Schleiermacher\u2019s\ndiscussion of the \u201cfeeling of absolute dependence.\u201d He\nwrites:\n\nAccording to him the religious emotion would be directly and\nprimordially a sort of self-consciousness, a feeling\nconcerning oneself in a special, determined relation, viz.,\none\u2019s dependence. Thus, according to Schleiermacher, I can only\ncome upon the very fact of God as the result of an inference, that is,\nby reasoning to a cause beyond myself to account for my \u2018feeling\nof dependence\u2019. (Chapter III, p. 10)\n\n\nSo on Schleiermacher\u2019s account, as read by Otto, the divine\nreality is not disclosed directly in feeling, but is instead inferred\nfrom feeling. By contrast, Otto gives this view of the matter:\n\u201cRather, the \u2018creature-feeling\u2019 is itself a first\nsubjective concomitant and effect of another feeling-element, which\ncasts it like a shadow, but which in itself indubitably has immediate\nand primary reference to an object outside the self\u201d (p. 10).\nHere, Otto commits himself to the thought that the divine reality is\ndisclosed directly in states of feeling, where those states can in\nturn give rise to other states of feeling, including the feeling of\ndependence.\n\nOf course, there is a further question about how exactly\n\u201cGef\u00fchl\u201d is to be read in this context, but at least\nsome of the \u201cfeelings\u201d that, according to Otto,\nnon-inferentially disclose the divine reality seem to be affectively\ncharged. For instance, when discussing the \u201cawefulness\u201d\nthat belongs to the \u201ctremendum\u201d dimension of the\nexperience, Otto notes the connection between this feeling and\n\u201cshuddering\u201d or \u201cfeeling horror in the real sense of\nthe word,\u201d and he adds that \u201c\u2018shuddering\u2019 is\nsomething more than \u2018natural\u2019, ordinary fear\u201d\n(Chapter IV, p. 15). Moreover, he begins this chapter by remarking that\n\u201cthe nature of the numinous can only be suggested by means of\nthe special way in which it is reflected in the mind in terms of\nfeeling\u201d (p. 13). In these respects, there is at least some\nbasis for the idea that, in Otto\u2019s judgement, God is presented,\ndirectly and non-inferentially, in our affective responses. And these\nresponses, we might suppose, can play this sort of role because of\ntheir distinctive phenomenological character, which marks them out\nfrom the kinds of feeling that arise in other domains of life.\n(Contrast the dialectical model of the relationship between perception\nand feeling that is envisaged in Alvin Plantinga\u2019s discussion of\nJonathan Edwards: Plantinga 2000, pp. 301\u2013303.)\n\nOtto extends this account to provide a theory of religious language\n\u2014 doctrinal claims are, he thinks, an attempt to convey in\nrational, conceptually articulate terms the content of a\n\u201cnuminous\u201d experience that is itself conceptually\ninarticulate. So here, far from thought generating a correlative\nfeeling, it is feeling and its implicit reckoning with the nature of\nsome transcendent reality that comes first, and discursive thought\nthat follows on behind, trying to stammer out what is known in full\nonly in the relevant experience. One implication of this account is,\nclearly, that the idea of God has some phenomenological content. (See\nSchlamm 1992 for a defence of Otto\u2019s stance on this point, in\nresponse to the criticisms of Katz and others. Murphy 2022 seeks to\ncombine Otto\u2019s approach and the perspective of \u201cperfect\nbeing theology\u201d.)\n2.2 Emotional feelings and relationship to material context\n\nThis understanding of emotional feelings can also be brought into\nfruitful dialogue with the second of our models of religious\nexperience, according to which religious experience is not so much a\nmatter of encountering God directly, but is rather concerned with\nfinding a relevant meaning or significance in the ordering of a\nmaterial context.\n\nPeter Goldie notes that when a person falls on ice for the first time,\nthey may come to a new understanding of the dangers presented by ice,\nwhere this additional increment of understanding is in some way\nembedded in their new fearfulness of ice, and may resist formulation\nin linguistic terms. As he puts the point: \u201cComing to think of\nit [ice] in this new way is not to be understood as consisting of\nthinking of it in the old way, plus some added-on phenomenal\ningredient \u2014 feeling perhaps; rather, the whole way of\nexperiencing, or being conscious of, the world is new\u2026\u201d\n(Goldie 2000, pp. 59\u201360). We might suppose in particular that\nwhat has changed is that ice has come to assume a new salience in the\nperson\u2019s experience of the world, with the result that their\nperceptual field is differently structured when they are in the\npresence of ice, so as to give particular prominence to ice.\n\nAgain, there are parallels here with the literature in ethics, which\nhas treated moral perception as not so much a matter of identifying\nsome new fact in a situation of moral choice, as of understanding the\nrelative importance of various facts, and grasping which in particular\ndeserve attention or call for some practical response. For example,\nthe virtuous person may not be able to list some further fact\nconcerning the circumstances of various people in a crowded railway\ncarriage, but the fact that a particular passenger is over-burdened by\ntheir bags, and in some discomfort because they have to stand, may\nweigh with this person. This fact may become salient in their\nperception of the scene, and salience here may be a matter, at least\nin part, of their felt response to the passenger and their\npredicament. (Compare Blum 1994, pp. 31\u201333.)\n\nIn the same sort of way, we might suppose that the religious believer\nwho is approaching a sacred site of the kind that Barrie describes\nwill need to have their attention focussed appropriately. And we might\nthink that this is the role of the various thresholds and their\nassociated challenges for the body. It is because they engender and\ngive expression to the right kind of emotional responsiveness, broadly\none of reverential seriousness, that these preparatory behaviours\nenable a proper appreciation of the sacred space itself. Here, then,\nrather as with the train example, religious experience takes the form\nof viewing some material context with appropriate salience. (Compare\nJonathan Z. Smith\u2019s (1987) proposal that it is the quality of\nattention accorded to sacred objects, in a given context, rather than\nsomething intrinsic to those objects, that marks them out from other\nkinds of object.)\n\n3. Doctrine and mundane experience\n\nWe have been exploring various ways in which the phenomenology of\nreligious experience may be construed, in affective and other terms.\nIt is reasonable to suppose, in addition, that the quality of the\nbeliever\u2019s strictly mundane experience will be in some respects\nconditioned by their religious commitments, or will need to show some\nsort of consonance with those commitments.\n\nFor instance, the emotions may be religiously important even if they\nare not bound up with an experience of God or a sacred space, because\nof their role in signalling that certain matters are properly the\nobject of attention. Evolutionary accounts of emotional experience\ncommonly emphasise the significance of the emotions in constituting\npatterns of salience. For instance, it is obviously of adaptive value\nif a large, fast-approaching dog is afforded a certain salience in my\nperceptual field, while the colour of the linoleum floor on which I am\nstanding is consigned to the periphery of my awareness. And in\nstandard cases, to feel fear of a dog is, in part, to view the\nrelevant scene with such salience. (Compare Oatley and Jenkins, 1996.)\nHere, emotional responses help to frame rational thought, by\ndetermining what it is appropriate to attend to and in turn to reason\nabout. And, arguably, similar connections hold in religious\ncontexts.\n\nFor instance, speaking of revelation, John Henry Newman comments:\n\nThat earnest desire of it, which religious minds cherish, leads the\nway to the expectation of it. Those who know nothing of the wounds of\nthe soul, are not led to deal with the question, or to consider its\ncircumstances; but when our attention is roused, then the more\nsteadily we dwell upon it, the more probable does it seem that a\nrevelation has been or will be given to us. (1979, p. 328)\n\n\nIn this way, a person\u2019s emotional experience can mark out\ncertain matters as deserving of closer attention, and thereby this\nexperience can prepare the way for a deepening of religious\nunderstanding. Here, the phenomenology of the experience has, once\nagain, a crucial part to play in constituting the relevant pattern of\nsalience. But in this case, the experience is not directly or\nindirectly of God, but in the first instance of the condition of\none\u2019s soul. William James takes a similar line when he says of\n\u201cdogmatic or idealistic theology\u201d that \u201cthese\nspeculations must \u2026 be classed as over-beliefs, buildings-out\nperformed by the intellect into directions of which feelings\noriginally supplied the hint,\u201d giving as an example of such\nfeelings \u201cinner unhappiness and the need of deliverance\u201d\n(1902, p. 431). (For the importance of emotional responses in framing\nrational thought, see also Damasio 1995, pp. 193\u2013194.)\n\nThis example is a matter of moving from a way of experiencing the\nworld to a doctrinal commitment. We might suppose that it is also\npossible to move in the other direction, since doctrinal commitments\nmay carry implications for how the world is to be experienced in\nsubjective terms. Nicholas Wolterstorff notes, for example, how this\nworld\n\nrepresents a success on the part of God \u2014 God who is love\n\u2014 not a failure. In contemplation of what He had made God found\ndelight. But also God knew that what He had made would serve well his\nhuman creatures. So God pronounced His \u2018Yes\u2019 upon it all,\na \u2018Yes\u2019 of delight and of love. You and I must do no less.\n(1980, p. 69)\n\n\nFollowing this suggestion, we should suppose that the doctrine of\ncreation implies a correlative affectively toned phenomenology, one\nwhich is open to taking delight in the world, in its materiality.\n\nReports of conversion experience provide a particularly striking\nexample of how religious commitments may be connected to experience of\nthe everyday world. It is notable that such reports commonly testify\nnot simply to the convert\u2019s new-found closeness to God, in\nprayer for example, but to a generalized shift in the appearance of\nthe physical world. For instance, William James notes how:\n\nWhen we come to study the phenomenon of conversion or religious\nregeneration, we \u2026 see that a not infrequent consequence of the\nchange operated in the subject is a transfiguration of the face of\nnature in his eyes. A new heaven seems to shine on a new earth. (1902,\np. 141)\n\n\nAs one of James\u2019s sources remarks: \u201cNatural objects were\nglorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in\nevery material object in the universe\u2026\u201d (1902, p. 250). Here,\nfollowing conversion, the natural world appears brighter or more\nvivid, so that it seems to be newly transparent to the divine glory.\n(For another account of how a whole domain of experience may take on a\nparticular subjective character and significance, see Cooper 2002 on\n\u201cexistential\u201d experience, p. 340.)\n\nThere are various ways of understanding the significance of this sort\nof shift in the world\u2019s appearance. One potentially helpful\ncategory is Matthew Ratcliffe\u2019s notion of \u201cexistential\nfeelings.\u201d Ratcliffe introduces the category in these terms:\n\nFirst of all, they [existential feelings] are not directed at specific\nobjects or situations but are background orientations through which\nexperience as a whole is structured. Second, they are bodily\nfeelings. (2008, p. 38, Ratcliffe\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs an analogy (or perhaps more than an analogy) we could take the case\nof jet lag. When I am in a jet lagged state, the world in general can\nappear differently to me, and this is in part, no doubt, because of\nthe associated change in my bodily condition. I may feel groggy (here\nis the bodily feeling to which Ratcliffe refers), and at the same time\nthe world in general may take on a new appearance, so that it seems,\nfor instance, out of focus. And we might speculate that, similarly,\nthe convert has undergone a change in bodily condition, and that it is\nthis change that accounts both for their feelings of elation, and also\nfor the shift that they report in the world\u2019s appearance. It may\nbe that, in some cases, whether by design or not, this bodily change\nis the product of a spiritual discipline. So here is another way in\nwhich feelings, including feelings of bodily condition, may be caught\nup into the phenomenology of the religious or spiritual life.\n\nWe may wonder what phenomenological categories to use for the\ndescription of this sort of experience, whereby the world in general\nappears brighter and newly vivid. It may be that the category of\nsalience is, once again, of some help here. James notes how in the\nexperience of the depressed person, the world can appear\n\u201cflat.\u201d And this is what we should expect: in central\ncases, the person who is depressed is suffering from a lack of\nemotional engagement with the world, and in turn, therefore, from a\nblunted sense of the differentiated significance of things, so that\nthe patterns of salience that normally inform the perceptual field are\nflattened out. Hence James writes of Tolstoy\u2019s experience of a\nperiod of existential crisis that: \u201cLife had been enchanting. It\nwas now flat sober, more than sober, dead\u201d (1902, p. 152). And\nspeaking more generally he comments that:\n\nThe old man, sick with an insidious internal disease, may laugh and\nquaff his wine at first as well as ever, but he knows his fate now,\nfor the doctors have revealed it; and the knowledge knocks the\nsatisfaction out of all these functions. They are partners of death\nand the worm is their brother, and they turn to a mere flatness. The\nlustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the background of\npossibilities it goes with. (1902, p. 141)\n\n\nHere again, we are concerned with a generalized shift in the\nappearance of the world, but in this example, the change is evidently\ninduced not simply by a change in bodily condition, though that may be\npart of the story, but by the person\u2019s new assessment of their\ncircumstances. This case too is religiously suggestive, since the\nreligions standardly offer, of course, far-reaching diagnoses of our\npresent circumstances and our prospects. So perhaps, in some cases,\nconversion experience is a matter of the person coming to subscribe to\na new conception of their circumstances, of this far-reaching variety,\nand acquiring thereby a new sense of their \u201cbackground of\npossibilities,\u201d with the result that their experience of the\neveryday world is then renewed.\n\nSo salience is one category that is relevant to the description of the\nchange in the appearance of the everyday world that is commonly\nassociated with conversion. In brief, before conversion, the world may\nappear relatively \u201cflat,\u201d and after it may be that objects\nare more clearly delineated relative to one another, so that they\nstand out in the perceptual field, where this standing out records the\nperson\u2019s new appreciation of their significance in themselves\nand relative to one another. It it notable that James\u2019s converts\nseem to be talking not only about a deepening of patterns of salience\nin the perceptual field, but also of the world appearing brighter or\nmore vivid, where this change seems to imply a change in the\n\u201ccolouring,\u201d and not simply in the structure, of the\nperceptual field. An example will help us to pin down this further\ndimension of the change that converts seem to be describing.\n\nSuppose that I am chewing some meat that, unknown to me, derives from\nShuttlecock, the pet rabbit. And suppose that I am now told that the\nmeat does indeed derive from Shuttlecock. In these circumstances\n\u2013 granted standard assumptions \u2013 the meat will, of course,\nbecome newly salient for me: I will now be focally aware of it. But\nthat is not all that will happen. The meat will also change in its\nintrinsic phenomenal feel: it will now be experienced as disgusting.\nWe can call this second element of the change in the appearance of the\nmeat a change in \u201chue.\u201d Commonly, changes in salience and\nin hue will arise together: if an object acquires a new hue, for\nexample, then it is natural to suppose that it will stand out relative\nto other objects in a new way. But as the example of Shuttlecock\nindicates, these changes are conceptually distinguishable. And we\nmight suppose, then, that James\u2019s converts are reporting not\nonly a change in salience, but also a change in hue: the perceptual\nfield is now more boldly contoured, and it is at the same time\nbrighter or more vivid than before conversion.\n\nSo far in this section, we have been interested in the correlation\nbetween mundane experience and religious teaching, where this\ncorrelation is \u201cexternal\u201d: that is, it is a matter of the\ndoctrine upholding some idea about the nature of the world \u2013 for\ninstance, the idea that the world as created is good \u2013 and the\nappearance of the world then conforming to that idea, by virtue of,\nsay, the patterns of salience that are inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, and the colouring or \u201chue\u201d of the world as\nexperienced. And as we have seen, we can understand these shifts in\nthe appearance of the world as, fundamentally, the product of changes\nin bodily condition, or as shaped by way of religious teaching about\nhuman beings\u2019 \u201cbackground of possibilities.\u201d But\nanother case is also possible: here, the religious teaching enters\ninto the appearance of the world. Something like this case is perhaps\nimplied in Jonathan Edwards\u2019 report of his religious conversion,\nwhich is also recorded by William James. Edwards writes:\n\nThe appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be, as it\nwere, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost\neverything. God\u2019s excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love,\nseemed to appear in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the\nclouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water\nand all nature; which used greatly to fix my mind. (1902, pp.\n248\u20139)\n\n\nIn this report, it is not simply that things look different following,\nor in the course of, conversion, but the divine nature is now somehow\nmade manifest in the appearance of the world. This sort of report at\nleast raises the possibility, however puzzling it may be, that\nconcepts of the divine can enter into our experience of the world, so\nthat the content of the concept comes to be embodied in the world as\nit appears. A related case is reported by Roger Scruton when he\nrepresents the intentions of the designers of the Gothic church in\nthese terms:\n\nit is clear from Abbot Suger\u2019s account of the building of St\nDenis \u2026 that the architects of the Gothic churches were motivated by\na perceived relationship between the finished church and the Heavenly\nCity of Christian speculation. Sir John Summerson has further\nsuggested that the Gothic church aims at a certain effect of\naccumulation. Each great church can be considered as a concatenation\nof smaller structures, of aedicules, fitted together as arches,\nchapels, windows, and spires, and so can be seen as an assembled city,\nrather than as a single entity minutely subdivided\u2026 But the\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d here is not a \u201cthought\u201d that\nis separable from the experience \u2013 it is there in the\nexperience, as when I see the dots of a puzzle picture as a face, or\nthe man in the moon. (1979, pp. 74\u20135)\n\n\nHere, the concept of the heavenly city has a phenomenal counterpart in\nthe appearance of the Gothic church, once the perceptual field has\nbeen appropriately organised. We could put the point by saying that\nthe concept of the heavenly city can be inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, so that the Gothic church comes to present an image of that\ncity, by virtue of appearing as an \u201cassembled\u201d entity,\nrather than as a single thing divided. As Scruton notes, this is not a\nquestion of the idea of the heavenly city being used to interpret the\nappearances; the connection is more integral than that: the\nappearances themselves take on a certain character once they are\nordered according to that idea. Perhaps, similarly, it is possible for\na particular concept of God to be inscribed in the perceptual field,\nso that the sensory world in some relevant respect comes to image God?\nSomething like this possibility seems to be implied in Edwards\u2019\naccount of his conversion experience, where the world \u2013 the sun\nand stars, trees and flowers \u2013 is said to body forth the various\ndivine attributes. Edwards\u2019 insistent use of the words\n\u201cappear\u201d and \u201cappearance\u201d in his report\nindicates that his intention is to communicate the phenomenology of\nhis experience, where that phenomenology is one of the divine nature\nbeing manifest in the world.\n\nOf course, the case of the Gothic church may seem relatively\nstraightforward, and rather unrepresentative of religious thought more\ngenerally. For, here, we are dealing with the capacity of one\nspatio-temporal entity (the Gothic church) to image another (the\nheavenly city), and it is only to be expected that one such entity can\nimage another once its appearance is structured appropriately.\n(Compare the capacity of small children to take clouds as images of\njust about anything, once the relevant isomorphism has been\nintroduced.) But if a religious thought concerns, say, the divine\nnature, then it is not of a spatio-temporal entity, and in this case,\ntherefore, it is harder to see how the appearance of the world might\npresent an image of the content of the thought. It may be that another\nof Scruton\u2019s examples bears on this issue. In the following\npassage, he is considering the capacity of a cloister to represent an\nideal of life. He writes:\n\none might think of a Romanesque cloister in terms of the industrious\npiety of its former inhabitants: in terms of an historical identity, a\nway of life, with which this habit of building was associated. But\nwere a man to present this as his reason for looking favourably on\nsome particular cloister, say that of S. Paolo Fuori Le Mura in Rome\n\u2026 then the onus lies on him to show exactly how such an idea finds\nconfirmation in an experience of the building. Perhaps he could go on\nto refer to the variety of forms employed in the columns, to their\nfine industrious detailing, and to the way in which none of this\nabundance of observation disturbs the restful harmony of the design.\nHe might trace the rhythm of the arcade, and describe the Cosmatesque\nmosaic, with its bright and childlike inventiveness that never\ntransgresses the bounds of sensible ornamentation. In all this, he\nmight say, we see how energetic observation and monastic piety may be\nsuccessfully combined. A certain idea of monasticism becomes a visible\nreality: the idea is not merely a personal association occasioned by\nsome anecdotal or historical reminiscence: we see it in the\ndetails of the building. (1979, p. 109)\n\n\nThis case is rather different from the example of the Gothic church.\nHere, what we \u201csee\u201d in the building is not a\nspatio-temporal entity (the heavenly city) but an ideal of life. Of\ncourse, it is true that it was the monks\u2019 leading of that life\nthat accounts for the construction of the building; but Scruton is\nclear that the association here, between the way of life and the\ncharacter of the building, is not just causal: when the cloister is\nviewed in the right way, that way of life enters into its appearance.\nIn general terms, it seems clear enough how, on Scruton\u2019s\naccount, this is supposed to happen: what is required is that when we\nview the building, we hold in tension the \u201cenergy\u201d and\n\u201cabundant observation\u201d of the columns, arcade and other\nfeatures of the structure, on the one side, and the impression of\n\u201crestfulness\u201d and measure that is communicated by the\noverall design of the cloister, on the other. When we allow these two\nimpressions of the building to coexist in our perception of it, then\nthe building can image the relevant ideal of life. Here again, what is\nneeded, presumably, is that we order the scene according to the\nappropriate pattern of salience. But this is, it seems, a relatively\ncomplex example of salient viewing, since it requires one set of\nqualities, identified in one instance of salient viewing, to be laid\nalongside another, identified in another instance of salient viewing,\nwithin a single, cohesive act of perception.\n\nThis case is closer to the experience that Edwards reports than is the\nexample of the heavenly city, and it suggests one way of making sense\nof his account. Perhaps just as the ideal of life, and the associated\nvirtues, of the monks can be imaged in the cloister, so the divine\ncharacter, and the divine \u201cvirtues,\u201d can be imaged in the\nworld, once it is viewed aright. If so, that would be a significant\ntruth: for in that case, we would be able to reckon with various\nconceptions of the divine nature not only abstractly, but also in\nsensory terms, in so far as those conceptions can be used to order the\nappearance of the everyday world, so that the relevant understanding\nof God comes to be imaged by the world as experienced. And if this is\nso, then we have reason to think that the goods of the spiritual life\nare not only behavioural, intellectual, emotional and attitudinal, as\nwidely supposed, but also perceptual. (For further discussion, see\nWynn 2013.) On this view, the way the sensory world appears can be\ndeemed more or less appropriate relative to various truths concerning\nthe divine nature; and accordingly, some ways in which the world\nappears may turn out to realize significant spiritual goods.\n4. Two contrasting emphases in the study of religion\n\nWe have been examining some of the ways in which the phenomenology of\nhuman experience may be relevant to the content of religious belief\n(e.g., to a religiously resonant understanding of divine presence) and\nto its epistemic standing (e.g., to the intentionality of religious\nexperience). When such considerations are squeezed out of an account\nof the religious or spiritual life, that is likely to be because of a\npreference for doctrine or practice as the central category in terms\nof which religion is to be understood. So we can think of two\ncorrelative challenges for any approach that makes some appeal to\nphenomenology: perhaps such an account fails to reckon with the\ndoctrinal content of religious belief, and perhaps it overlooks the\nrole of practice in defining religious traditions.\n\nThe first objection makes most sense if we are working with a\nrelatively simple distinction between doctrines (creedal items derived\nfrom, say, the Bible or later theological reflection) and experience.\nBut as we have seen, doctrine and experience are likely to be mutually\ninforming, and it is reasonable to suppose that in some cases\nreligious understanding involves a kind of amalgam of doctrinal scheme\nand body of experience, where these elements cannot in any simple way\nbe separated out.\n\nNewman makes a related point when he distinguishes a\n\u201cnotion\u201d from a \u201creal image\u201d of God (1979, p.\n108). A notion of God is an abstract conception of God, while a real\nimage of God, he tends to think, presupposes the notion, but deepens\nit by way of affectively toned, first hand experience of God. So for\nexample, to have encountered God in the call of conscience, in the\nexperience of remorse, is thereby to have a new understanding of the\nsense in which God is properly called judge, although the additional\nincrement of understanding may not be readily verbalisable. (Compare\nGoldie on our knowledge of the dangerousness of ice.)\n\nOther commentators have thought that phenomenological treatments of\nreligion risk overlooking the central role of practices in\nconstituting religious traditions. For example, in his study\nBeyond Phenomenology, Gavin Flood remarks that: \u201cIt is\nritual structures and performed narratives which have primacy in the\ntransmission of traditions through the generations and not any\nindividual experience or state of consciousness\u201d (1999, p. 107).\nAgain, as with doctrine, so here we might wish to avoid any overly\nsharp disjunction of phenomenology and practice.\n\nThis point can be made particularly succinctly by considering again\nthe case of emotional feelings. Such feelings involve patterns of\nsalient viewing, we have seen; but they can also be connected to the\nposture of the body. For example, in standard cases, to feel fear is\nin part to register the tensing of the body, and in turn therefore its\ntaking stock of a particular environment, and its making ready to act\nin that environment (Solomon 2003 and Pickard 2003). So the\nintellectual content of an emotional feeling, concerning what is\ndeserving of attention in a given context of choice, is we might\nsuppose realised both in a correlative structuring of the perceptual\nfield, and in a kinaesthetic appreciation of the body\u2019s\nreadiness to act in that context.\n\nDepending on the details of the case, we might want to see the\nexpressive posture of the body as coming first, and giving rise to a\ncertain ordering of the perceptual field, or vice versa. But, here, we\nseem to have two ways of grasping a certain content; and these two\nways seem to be held together by the relevant emotional feeling, since\nsuch feelings are realised both in a certain pattern of salient\nviewing and in the feeling of a correlative posture of the body.\n\nSo here \u201cpractice,\u201d or the readiness of the body to act in\ncertain ways in the world, is not straightforwardly separable from\n\u201cdoctrine\u201d (a conceptually organised appreciation of the\nworld) or emotional feeling. Instead these three make up a unitary\nstate of mind. And similarly, we might suppose, certain religious\npractices are reciprocally implicated in correlative ways of seeing,\nand in turn in correlative doctrines, in ways that resist any easy\ndisaggregation or prioritisation. Max Scheler makes something like\nthis point when he suggests that different postures of the body in\nprayer reciprocally define different conceptions of God (1960, p.\n266); and, once again, we might suppose that similar connections are\ndisplayed in the responses of the body on the approach to a sacred\nsite.\n\nTaking another route into these questions, we might think that\nprogress in the spiritual life can be described in terms of different\nvocabularies: sometimes, a religious tradition may use a relatively\nexperiential or phenomenological idiom to mark the distinction between\ndifferent phases of the spiritual life; sometimes, it may use a\nbehavioural idiom, by citing, for instance, the enacted example of the\nsaints; and sometimes it may use a more metaphysical idiom, by noting,\nsay, how the relationship between divine and human agency may take\ndifferent forms at different stages of the spiritual life.\nAccordingly, to take just one example, we might suppose that the\nchange that concerns Thomas Aquinas when he speaks of how the infused\nmoral virtues extend the acquired moral virtues must in some way\ncorrelate with the change that John of the Cross records when he\nspeaks of the descent into the \u201cdark night,\u201d and of the\ntransition from there into a renewed appreciation of the everyday\nsensory world. In this way, we can see phenomenological\ncharacterisations of the religious or spiritual life as integrally\nconnected to characterisations that make use of a more behavioural or\nmetaphysical vocabulary (Wynn 2017).\n\nIn sum, then, rather than giving precedence to doctrine- or\npractice-based accounts of religion, we might suppose that these\naccounts will themselves come fully into focus only when they are\ncombined with an appreciation of the phenomenology of religion.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alston, William P., 1991, <em>Perceiving God: The Epistemology of\nReligious Experience</em>, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.", "Aquinas, Thomas, 1963, <em>Summa Theologiae: Latin Text and\nEnglish Translation</em>, London: Blackfriars.", "Aquino, Frederick, and Gavrilyuk, Paul (eds.), 2022,\n<em>Perceiving Things Divine: Towards a Constructive Account of\nSpiritual Perception</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Barrie, Thomas, 1996, <em>Sacred Place: Myth, Ritual, and Meaning\nin Architecture</em>, Boston: Shambhala.", "Blum, Lawrence, 1994, <em>Moral Perception and Particularity</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Brown, David, 2004, <em>God and Enchantment of Place: Reclaiming\nHuman Experience</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Budd, Malcolm, 1985, <em>Music and the Emotions: The Philosophical\nTheories</em>, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.", "Byrne, Peter,1995, <em>Prolegomena to Religious Pluralism:\nReference and Realism in Religion</em>, Basingstoke: Macmillan.", "Cooper, David, 2002, <em>The Measure of Things: Mystery, Measure\nand Humility</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.", "Cox, James L., 2006, <em>A Guide to Phenomenology: Key Figures,\nFormative Influences and Subsequent Debates</em>, London:\nContinuum.", "Damasio, Antonio, 1995, <em>Descartes\u2019 Error: Emotion,\nReason and the Human Brain</em>, Basingstoke: Picador.", "Davis, Caroline Franks, 1989, <em>The Evidential Force of\nReligious Experience</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.", "Deigh, John, 1994, \u201cCognitivism in the Theory of\nEmotions,\u201d <em>Ethics</em>, 104: 824\u2013854.", "Dupre, Louis, 1998, <em>Religious Mystery and Rational\nReflection</em>, Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B.
