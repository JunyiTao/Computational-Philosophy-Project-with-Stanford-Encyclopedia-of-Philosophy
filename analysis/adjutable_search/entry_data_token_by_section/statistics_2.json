    "main_text": "Foundations and interpretations || Physical probability and classical statistics\n2.1 Physical probability and classical statistics\n\nIn the sciences, the idea that probabilities express physical states\nof affairs, often called chances or stochastic processes, is most\nprominent. They are relative frequencies in series of events\nor, alternatively, they are tendencies or propensities in the\nsystems that realize those events. More precisely, the probability\nattached to the property of an event type can be understood as the\nfrequency or tendency with which that property manifests in a series\nof events of that type. For instance, the probability of a coin\nlanding heads is a half exactly when in a series of similar coin\ntosses, the coin lands heads half the time. Or alternatively, the\nprobability is half if there is an even tendency towards both possible\noutcomes in the setup of the coin tossing. The mathematician Venn\n(1888) and scientists like Quetelet and Maxwell (cf. von Plato 1994)\nare early proponents of this way of viewing probability. Philosophical\ntheories of propensities were first coined by Peirce (1910), and\ndeveloped by Popper (1959), Mellor (1971), Bigelow (1977), and Giere\n(1976); see Handfield (2012) for a recent overview. A rigourous theory\nof probability as frequency was first devised by von Mises (1981),\nalso defended by Reichenbach  (1938) and beautifully expounded in\nvan Lambalgen (1987).\nThe notion of physical probability is connected to one of the major\ntheories of statistical method, which has come to be called\nclassical statistics.  It was developed roughly in the first\nhalf of the 20th century, mostly by mathematicians and working\nscientists like Fisher (1925, 1935, 1956), Wald (1939, 1950), Neyman\nand Pearson (1928, 1933, 1967), and refined by very many classical\nstatisticians of the last few decades.  The key characteristic of this\ntheory of statistics aligns naturally with viewing probabilities as\nphysical chances, hence pertaining to observable and repeatable\nevents. Physical probability cannot meaningfully be attributed to\nstatistical hypotheses, since hypotheses do not have tendencies or\nfrequencies with which they come about: they are categorically true or\nfalse, once and for all. Attributing probability to a hypothesis seems to entail that\nthe probability is read epistemically.\nClassical statistics is often called frequentist, owing to\nthe centrality of frequencies of events in classical procedures and\nthe prominence of the frequentist interpretation of probability\ndeveloped by von Mises. In this interpretation, chances are\nfrequencies, or proportions in a class of similar events or\nitems. They are best thought of as analogous to other physical\nquantities, like mass and energy. It deserves emphasis that\nfrequencies are thus conceptually prior to chances . In propensity\ntheory the probability of an individual event or item is viewed as a\ntendency in nature, so that the frequencies, or the proportions in a\nclass of similar events or items, manifest as a consequence of the law\nof large numbers. In the frequentist theory, by contrast, the\nproportions lay down, indeed define what the chances are. This\nleads to a central problem for frequentist probability, the\nso-called reference class problem: it is not clear what\nclass to associate with an individual event or item (cf.  Reichenbach\n1949, Hajek 2007). One may argue that the class needs to be as narrow\nas it can be, but in the extreme case of a singleton class of events,\nthe chances of course trivialize to zero or one. Since classical\nstatistics employs non-trivial probabilities that attach to the single\ncase in its procedures, a fully frequentists understanding of\nstatistics is arguably in need of a response to the reference class\nproblem. \nTo illustrate physical probability, we briefly consider physical probability in the\nexample of the tea tasting lady.\n\nPhysical probability We denote the null\nhypothesis that the lady is merely guessing by \\(h\\). Say that we\nfollow the rule indicated in the example above: we reject this null\nhypothesis, i.e., denying that the lady is merely guessing, whenever\nthe sampled data \\(s\\) is included in a particular set \\(R\\) of\npossible samples, so \\(s \\in R\\), and that \\(R\\) has a summed\nprobability of 5% according to the null hypothesis. Now imagine that\nwe are supposed to judge a whole population of tea tasting ladies,\nscattered in tea rooms throughout the country. Then, by running the\nexperiment and adopting the rule just cited, we know that we will\nfalsely attribute special tea tasting talents to 5% of those ladies\nfor whom the null hypothesis is true, i.e., who are in fact merely\nguessing. In other words, this percentage pertains to the physical\nprobability of a particular set of events, which by the rule is\nconnected to a particular error in our judgment.\nNow say that we have found a lady for whom we reject the null\nhypothesis, i.e., a lady who passes the test. Does she have the tea\ntasting ability or not? Unfortunately this is not the sort of question\nthat can be answered by the test at hand. A good answer would\npresumably involve the proportion of ladies who indeed have the\nspecial tea tasting ability among those whose scores exceeded a\ncertain threshold, i.e., those who answered correctly on all five\ncups. But this latter proportion, namely of ladies for whom the null\nhypothesis is false among all those ladies who passed the test,\ndiffers from the proportion of ladies who passed the test among\nthose ladies for whom it is false. It will depend also on the\nproportion of ladies who have the ability in the population under\nscrutiny. The test, by contrast, only involves proportions within a\ngroup of ladies for whom the null hypothesis is true: we can only\nconsider probabilities for particular events on the assumption that\nthe events are distributed in a given way.\n",
