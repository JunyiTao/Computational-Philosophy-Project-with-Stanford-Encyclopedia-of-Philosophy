    "main_text": "Natural Religion: Atheism Conquered\n6. Natural Religion: Atheism Conquered\n\nOne of Campanella\u2019s most important works is Atheismus\ntriumphatus (Atheism Conquered), written between 1606\nand 1607. He himself regarded it as a watershed in his thinking,\nsignaling his detachment from the more openly rationalist positions of\nhis youth and his move toward a more sincere adherence to Christian\nprinciples. In letters written from prison, he describes the work as a\n\u201cvolume against politicians and Machiavellians\u201d\n(Lettere, p. 26). Central to the work is his polemic against\nboth reason of state and Machiavelli\u2019s conception of religion as a\npolitical invention, a useful \u201cfiction\u201d devised by priests\nand princes to gain and maintain power. This polemic is coupled with\nthe need to undertake a far-reaching rational examination, passing in\nreview and evaluating all religious beliefs and philosophical\ndoctrines in order to demonstrate that religion, in contrast to what\npoliticians think, is a \u201cnatural virtue\u201d inborn in human\nbeings. A further motive of this research is to ascertain the\nrelationship between natural religion and Christianity, which leads to\nthe conclusion that there is no conflict between Christian law and\nnatural law but instead a profound and fundamental agreement, since\nChrist did not nullify and abolish natural law but rather added to it\nmoral precepts and rites that completed and perfected it.\n\nOn June 1, 1607 the treatise was dedicated to Kaspar Schoppe, a German\nscholar who had come to Naples in the spring of that year to make\ncontact with the imprisoned Campanella, who informs us that Schoppe\nsuggested the title by which the work is known\u2014he himself had\ncalled it Recognoscimento della vera religione universale\n(Identification of the True Universal Religion). Written in\nItalian, the treatise was translated into Latin in the following years\nby Campanella himself; it was printed in Rome in 1631, then in Paris\nin 1636. The original Italian version has recently come to light,\ndiscovered in an autograph manuscript held in the Vatican Library. In\nthe prefatory letter, addressed to Schoppe, Campanella weaves a moving\naccount of the dramatic events his life into a powerful contrast\nbetween darkness and light: on the one hand, there is a dark age\ndominated by reason of state; on the other, there is a determination\nto kindle a light in order to distinguish truth from error,\nphilosophers from sophists, princes from tyrants, religion from\nsuperstition. The first chapter acts as an introduction, setting out\nthe different ways of dealing with religion. From the outset, two\nfigures take center stage and come face to face as the heroes and\nvillains of the story: philosophers and politicians. The latter deny\nGod and his providence, maintaining that all religions are political\nin origin. Such doctrines, based on self-love, are extremely difficult\nto eradicate and constitute the plague of every age, since their\nsupporters refuse to engage in any dialogue, closed within the\narrogant certainty of possessing the truth. Diametrically opposed to\nthem are the philosophers, who believe that there is only one true and\ncertain truth, that is natural and common to all. Uncertain when it\ncomes to supernatural dogmas, they live in a virtuous manner in\nconformity with nature. Without doing harm to anyone, they endeavor to\naccomplish works that are honest and beneficial to the human race.\nSince they have no desire for honors or wealth, \u201cthey live\ncontent with little and enjoy contemplation, and they have more esteem\nfor themselves than for a king or a pope or a monarch.\u201d\n\nThe second chapter, one of the most famous and widely discussed in the\ntreatise, ushers us into the heart of the matter. It contains a dense\nseries of arguments against religion in general and Christianity in\nparticular. These objections are presented in such a crude light and\nin a succession so beleaguered by questions that they provoked\nperplexity and anxiety, in both Catholic and Protestant camps, even\nbefore the book was published. After the objections have been listed,\nthe replies to them are given in the central and concluding chapters.\nThe remaining chapters of the first part are devoted to demonstrating\nthat religion is natural and inherent in every aspect of nature, which\nis the expression of divine craftsmanship. From the axiom of the\nexistence of God as Reason and Wisdom diffused in every aspect of\nreality derive corollaries concerning the \u201cvestiges\u201d of\nthe Trinity that shine forth in every natural entity; the rationality\nof the Incarnation; the influence of providence on the world, which is\nthe theater and effigy of the divinity, not a dark labyrinth of\nsuffering; the non-existence of death and the relativity of evil,\nwhich is connected to non-being, itself necessary in order to\ndistinguish between things; the deep solidarity of human beings with\nnature but at the same time their inherent divinity and eminence that\nenables them to elevate themselves to a higher world. Next comes the\nvexed problem of the immortality of the soul, a certainty arrived at\nby paths that are different from those of the Aristotelian tradition\nand that insist on the distinctiveness of humans as the sole beings\nable to transcend their own natural limits and gain awareness of their\nrelationship to the infinite. In the ninth chapter Campanella\nreaffirms, against any skeptical position, that the existence of many\nfalse religions is not a sufficient reason for concluding that all\nreligions are fundamentally false, just as the lack of skill on the\npart of many doctors does not demonstrate the falsity of medicine. If\nit is true that there are differences between the various religions,\nwith their distinctive rites and supernatural beliefs, it is also true\nthat \u201chuman beings have a natural inclination toward justice and\ntoward living within a religion\u201d and that religion is part\n\u201cof the law of nature\u201d. A confirmation that religion is\nnatural is provided by the fact that it is the indispensable\nfoundation and connective tissue of every political organization,\nwhich would not be able to survive and would dissolve without\nreligion. The central chapters then attempt to prove that positive\nlaws are nothing but special cases of the same primary law of nature,\nsince if they are reasonable and just, they participate in the Divine\nWord, source of all rationality and all virtue. If there is only one\nnatural law and it depends on the unique eternal law, all humans, if\nthey live according to reason, are implicitly and explicitly\nChristians. Christianity is not one sect among many, but rather, as\nthe explication of the Word, coincides with natural religion,\ncompleted and perfected by supernatural beliefs, dogmas and ceremonies\nthat are not alien to rationality and to nature. Christianity, whether\non account of its simplicity and the universality of its moral message\nor because its ceremonial apparatus completes and perfects nature,\nturns out to be the religion that is most in conformity with nature\nand, consequently, opens up the possibility of a confluence of all\nbeliefs in one universal religion common to all peoples.\n\nOver the course of the almost thirty years that intervened between the\ncomposition of Atheismus triumphatus and the publication of\nthe definitive Paris edition of 1636, the treatise had to overcome\nmany obstacles, following a tortuous itinerary, due to the suspicions\nof the ecclesiastical authorities, who accused the work of Pelagianism\nand thus of excessively exalting the natural capacities of humans and\ndiminishing divine grace by restricting it to far too narrow confines.\nThe work was not published despite the initiative of Schoppe; nor was\nit among those that appeared in Frankfurt between 1617 and 1623 due to\nthe efforts of Tobias Adami. With the failure of these attempts,\nCampanella thought of publishing it in Italy; but the treatise still\nhad to face numerous difficulties and to be censored more than once\nbefore it came out in the Rome edition of 1631, which was soon\nafterwards impounded. After repeated entreaties to put the book back\ninto circulation, Campanella took the decision to reprint it in Paris;\nand Atheismus triumphatus was published, along with other\nwritings, at the beginning of 1636 in a volume dedicated to Louis\nXIII.\n",
