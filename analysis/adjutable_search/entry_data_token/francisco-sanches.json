Life and Work \n\nFrancisco Sanches/S\u00e1nchez (1551\u20131623) was a physician and\na philosopher. As professor of both medicine and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Toulouse, he was the author of a number of treatises on\nboth medicine and philosophy, but gained notoriety as the sceptical\nphilosopher who penned Quod Nihil Scitur (1581), or That\nNothing is Known (1988, TNK). As a philosopher who took a\nsceptical view of knowledge, and who famously ended his writings with\nthe Latin interrogative \u201cquid?\u201d even the question\nof whether he was Portuguese or Spanish by birth, has been the subject\nof much debate. This has led to the confusing dual spelling of his\nlast name: with an \u201cs\u201d by Luso-Brazilian scholars\n(Sanches); with a \u201cz\u201d by Spanish scholars\n(S\u00e1nchez); and commonly with an \u201cs\u201d (with some\nexceptions) by English-language scholars. Here the latter spelling\nwill be used solely in keeping with English language scholarship and\ntranslations, while referring to Sanches, as an Iberian philosopher.\nThis confusion over his rightful birth place, is curiously reflected\nin Elaine Limbrick\u2019s Introduction to That Nothing is\nKnown, where she refers to him as \u201cthe Portuguese\nphilosopher and doctor\u201d on page 1 and then a few pages later\nwrites that \u201cFrancisco Sanches (Franciscus Sanchez) was probably\nborn on July 16, 1551, in Tuy, a city of northwestern\nSpain\u2026\u201d (Limbrick 1988: 4): situated across the border\nfrom the Portuguese city of Braga, with which it shared an archdiocese\n(Cazac 1903, 1904). Supposedly, a distant cousin of Michel de\nMontaigne, and born to a family of \u201cconversos\u201d (Orden\nJim\u00e9nez 2012, in Other Internet Resources), in 1562 the Sanches\nfamily moved to the Bordeaux region where the cultural and political\nclimate was much more amicable towards Jews and converts (Limbrick\n1988: 5). It was in Bordeaux that Sanches attended the prestigious\nColl\u00e8ge de Guyenne between the years 1562 and 1571. The\nColl\u00e8ge de Guyenne, whose course of study ranged from secondary\nschool to college, included a curriculum that emphasized the rhetoric\nof Aristotle and the scholastics. \n\n\nThe existence of higher groups in philosophy and of public lectures in\nGreek and mathematics indicates the overlapping of school and\nuniversity, (Woodward 1906: 143) \n\n\nwhich gives one some idea as to the kind of education Sanches received\nat the Coll\u00e8ge. And in effect, the first two years of college\nlevel courses included the study of Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy (based on the Physica and on De\nCaelo).\n\nMoreover, the teaching of Aristotle, as Michel Reulos has pointed out,\nfocused on manuals and commentaries on \u201cthe Philosopher\u201d\nrather than on the actual works of Aristotle (Reulos 1976: 149); and\nthat in turn, had mostly to do with the fact that relatively little of\nAristotle (and much less of Plato) had been translated into Latin. The\ntranslated excerpts were put at the service of the study of theology\n(1976: 152), and the way in which Aristotle was taught, says Reulos,\ndid not change until the early 1600s, when due to the influence of\n Petrus Ramus (1515\u20131572),\n the study of Aristotle in the colleges began to emphasize a return to\nthe texts themselves, and deemphasize the medieval commentaries (1976:\n154). This explains two major factors regarding Sanches\u2019 early\nacademic background in light of his work: On the one hand, the\nfluidity of his Latin and on the other, Sanches\u2019 own\nacknowledgment that the target of the attack in That Nothing is\nKnown was not so much Aristotle, but rather the scholastic use of\nAristotle. In contrast to the style of Scholastic logicians,\nSanches\u2019 style is direct, informal, and devoid of rhetorical\nflourishes. And yet while Sanches approvingly cites the Spanish\nhumanist, Juan Luis Vives\u2019 (1492\u20131540) criticism of the\nnon-sense produced by the Scholastic dialecticians who only knew\nAristotle \u201cthrough Latin translations and commentaries\u201d,\nargues Limbrick (TNK: 29), Petrus Ramus, on the other hand, fails to\nget mentioned, due to the latter\u2019s wish to fuse rhetoric with\ndialectic and more significantly, reconfigure the Galenic method so as\nto \u201cascend\u201d from particulars to universals (Ong 1958\n[1983: 257\u2013258]). For it\u2019s a noteworthy fact that in 1571\nSanches went to study medicine at La Sapienza in Rome: where\n Galen\n was one of the key figures of medical studies. And to a great extent\none could argue that Sanches\u2019 empiricist scepticism can best be\nunderstood against the background of Galen\u2019s inductive method\nand his own training as a physician. Medical pedagogy at La Sapienza\nunderscored the importance of observation while giving much less\nweight to logic and dialectic; in other words, it centered its\nteachings on Galen\u2019s method as exemplified in the Ars\nmedica, and underplayed the Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy of the scholastics; a factor that doubtlessly, impacted on\nSanches\u2019 philosophy. Sanches, however, did not graduate from La\nSapienza. Instead, two years later, in 1573, he returned to the south\nof France, to conclude his studies at the more pedagogically\nconservative University of Montpellier, which like La Sapienza\nconcentrated primarily on Galenic theory (and secondarily on\nHippocrates) (Limbrick 1988: 63). And on 13 July 1574 he received his\ndoctorate from the University of Montpellier, where he unsuccessfully\ntried to secure a position as chair in the Medical Department.\nDisappointed with internal and external (religious) politics, Sanches\ngained employment at the University of Toulouse (1575) where he\nremained until his death in 1623, as professor of both medicine and\nphilosophy.\n2. Philosophical Works \n\nSanches wrote treatises on medicine and philosophy, and of his\nphilosophical works, only two were published in his lifetime, Quod\nnihil scitur (1581; That Nothing is Known) and\nCarmen de cometa anni M.D.LXXVII (1578; Poem of the Comet\nof 1577). The other philosophical writings were published by his\nsons in 1636, and they included De longitudine et brevitate vitae,\nliber; In liber Aristotelis physiognomicon commentarius;\nand De diviniatone per somnum, ad Aristotelem. All of which\ncan be found in the various editions of his philosophical\noeuvre\u2014see the discussion at the beginning of the\nBibliography.\n\nAlthough occasionally there may be references to a variety of texts,\nfor reasons of space, the focus here will be on Carmen de\ncometa [Poem of the Comet] and the Letter to Christopher Clavius,\nfor they best serve as a bridge to Quod nihil scitur/That\nNothing is Known (QNS/TNK), the work that made Sanches\nfamous and continues to be studied; either because of its own\nintrinsic merits or in connection with\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 (1596\u20131650)\n \u201cradical doubt\u201d, and other sixteenth and seventeenth\ncentury sceptics like Pierre Charron (1541\u20131603) or\n Montaigne.\n The essay will consequently begin with Carmen de cometa\n(1578)/Poem of the Comet, move to Sanches\u2019 \u201cLetter to\nChristopher Clavius\u201d, and will lastly deal with Quod nihil\nscitur (1581)/That Nothing is Known (1988, TNK).\n2.1 Carmen de cometa anni M.D.LXXVII/Poem of the Comet of 1577\n\nAs Elaine Limbrick points out, Sanches wrote Carmen de cometa anni\nM.D.LXXVII in the style of Lucretius\u2019 De rerum\nnatura or The Nature of Things. His two main targets\nwere (1) Francesco Giuntini\u2019s Discours sur ce que menace\ndevoir advenir la comete apparue \u00e0 Lyon le 12 de ce mois de\nNovembre de 1577. laquelle se voit encores \u00e0 present, a\ntreatise that proposed that the comet of 1577, and comets in general,\nwere prophetic phenomena of bad things to come, such as plagues and\nthe deaths of kings; and (2) Aristotelian notions of the heavens, the\nspheres, and the place of comets within this hierarchical,\nastronomical ontology.\n\nIt is indeed telling that Sanches begins the Carmen de cometa\nin a mocking and critical tone on the question of knowledge. He\nwrites: \n\n\nWhy do you pretend to know such profound things you, impulsive youth?\nTo what end do you pretend to know these things, you trembling old\nage? Thus I want to show above all else that the long-haired star\ncannot predict anything. And even if it could predict, it would not\nprovide any knowledge. It serves no purpose. So why want what is\nuseless? (CC: 143: 1\u20132; 146: 25\u201327, my translation) \n\n\nThis is the scepticism that frames the Poem of the Comet.\n\nFirstly, we have Sanches\u2019 view of comets, more or less derived\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s notions of the heavens and the place of comets\nwithin them. For Aristotle comets were celestial bodies inhabiting the\nspace between the Earth and the upper heavenly spheres. They were\ncreated by hot dry exhalation that emanated from the terrestrial\nsphere, and clashed, as it were, with the movement of the heavenly\nsphere (Meteorologica 344a8\u201333); or as Aristotle\nexplained: if the exhalation extended in all directions it was called\na \u201ccomet or long-haired star\u201d, and if it extended\nlengthwise only it was called a \u201cbearded star\u201d. \n\n\nNow when as a result of the upper motion there impinges upon a\nsuitable condensation a fiery principle which is neither so very\nstrong as to cause a rapid and widespread conflagration, nor no feeble\nas to be quickly extinguished, but which is yet strong enough and\nwidespread enough; and when besides there coincides with it an\nexhalation from below of suitable consistency; then a comet is\nproduced, its exact form depending on the form taken by the\nexhalation\u2014if it extends in all directions it is called a comet\nor long-haired star, if it extends lengthwise only it is called a\nbearded star. (344a15\u201326 51)\n\n\nThe fact, thereby, that comets were conceived objects of secondary\nimportance in the great hierarchy of the heavenly spheres, reduce\ntheir ontological significance for Sanches. How could such unimportant\nphenomena prophecy great events and determine the actions of rational\nbeings? Since comets were the product of dry exhalations \u201cwith\nexcessively weak forces\u201d that occurred at great distances from\nthe earth, they \u201ccould not be the cause of anything\u201d (CC:\n194: 658\u2013661, my translation). \u201cWhat could your\nlong-haired star achieve then? What can that minuscule breath with its\ndim light, transmit to us from the heights of the heavens\u201d (CC:\n666\u2013669). The answer for Sanches, as would be expected, was\n\u201cnihil\u201d. Nowhere was it observable that comets\nwere either signs or final causes (cf. Orden Jim\u00e9nez 2003) In\nshort, comets were not natural phenomena with consciousness that\n\u201cgave greater importance to kings than to common citizens\u201d\n(CC: 174\u2013174: 409\u2013410); and they certainly could not be\nthe cause of human actions, for then they would obviate free will.\n\n\n\nThe free mind is not subject to laws, and neither are its own acts: it\ncan turn either way; at times the soul turns to a certain thing, and\nat times to others\u2026Why do you persist that the long-haired\nstars can predict harmful arguments or cruel poisons in my life? No\none can foretell what is subject to free will. (CC: 170:\n336\u2013339, 342\u2013346) \n\n\nAnd he adds: \n\n\nReligion and the habits of our souls are free acts of our will. What\neffects can celestial bodies have on free acts? What is the relation\nbetween our mind and a bearded star? Celestial bodies have not been\ngiven any power over the mind\u2026. (CC: 171: 354\u2013359, my\ntranslation) \n\n\nReligion, and even more so, \u201cgood acts\u201d can only be\nattributable to free will. Or to put it another way, morality is\ncontingent on free will. If God were to put special powers into comets\nsuch that they could influence human actions, then comets\u2014these\nmaterial objects\u2014would be superior to humans. Humans would be\nthe playthings of comets, and \u201cgood acts\u201d qua\ndetermined acts would no longer be good. On the other hand, human acts\nwould be subject, to what in the Middle Ages was deemed as\n\u201cFortuna\u201d, predestination, and to some extent\nprovidence.\n\nFinally, there is Sanches\u2019 tacit criticism of a theory based on\nnothing more than a syllogistic argument that fails to prove any\nconnection between comets and human actions, not to mention, any\nconnection between the appearance of a comet as a cause, and its\nputative effects on human actions, death, harvests, and diseases. For\nhow many years could go by before a comet was witnessed, asked\nSanches, and still harvests failed, earthquakes rattled the earth, and\nkings died? Not to mention the fact that comets were often witnessed\nby certain peoples around the globe and not by others. Did that mean\nthat if the comet were only seen by the peoples of India, it would\nonly have an effect on that particular population, and not on the\npeoples of the south of France? If comets only predicted certain\nthings, one was left to ask: why these and not others? And what is\nmore, why could they not equally be the cause of good things?\n\u201cThere is no reason for it\u201d, says Sanches (CC: 186: 563).\nAnd as such, at the very core of Sanches\u2019 poem, lies the kernel\nof his scepticism. After all, the Poem of the Comet of 1577 and\nThat Nothing is Known were written at nearly the same time.\nIn this respect, Sanches\u2019 Poem is an attack on Ptolemaic\nastrology, which anticipated Pierre Gassendi\u2019s (1592\u20131655)\ncriticisms of astrology\u2019s vis-\u00e0-vis its threat to the\nnotion of free will (Sarasohn 1996: 99). Interestingly, Sanches and\nGassendi shared what Popkin calls a \u201cconstructivist\nscepticism\u201d (1964: 17); which in both cases resulted from their\nanti-Aristotelianism and scientific empiricism (Popkin 1964:\n86\u201387). As such, then, from this perspective, Carmen de\nCometa/Poem of the Comet ought to be considered one of\nSanches\u2019 philosophical works, and one which sheds light upon his\nmore popular Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known.\n2.2 Letter to Christopher Clavius\n\nJust as everything else that has to do with Sanches, there is even\nuncertainty as to the date the Letter to Christopher Clavius was\nwritten. Raymond Delassus, Sanches\u2019 disciple, and first\nbiographer, dates the letter to around 1575, while J. Iriarte believes\nthat the latter was written much later, in 1589, in which case it\nwould place the writing of the letter at least eight years after the\npublication of Quo nihil scitur (1581). Given, however, that\nClavius\u2019 translation and commentary on Euclid\u2019s\nElements was published in Rome in 1574, it would seem that\nthe former date of 1575, makes much more sense. It stands to reason\nthat Sanches would have responded to Clavius\u2019 commentary soon\nafter its publication rather than fifteen years later, especially when\nso much of what is in the letter is implicitly related to\nSanches\u2019 epistemology in Quod nihil scitur. In that\nsense the Letter to Clavius constitutes a debate between those who\nlike Clavius believed that the truths of mathematics were a\npriori and indubitable, and thinkers like Sanches who held an\nanti-Platonist, empiricist view of the world. A few quotes from\nClavius\u2019 Opera mathematica and from Sanches\u2019s\nLetter help us to understand the debate. Clavius wrote:\n\n\nSince the mathematical disciplines treat things which are considered\nwithout any sensible matter (although they are actually impressed in\nmatter), it is clear that they occupy the intermediate place between\nmetaphysics and natural science\u2026If the nobility and preeminence\nof a science is truly judged by virtue of the certainty of the\ndemonstrations it uses, undoubtedly the mathematical disciplines will\noccupy the first place among all. (quoted in Sasaki 2003: 56)\n\n\nBy the time that Descartes wrote the Meditations,\nClavius\u2019 view concerning what he called the\n\u201cpreeminence\u201d of mathematics was generally accepted. It\nwas the prevailing view that something like Euclid\u2019s theorems\nwere time-tested to be demonstrably true. And indeed it was for this\nreason that Mersenne suggested to Descartes that he present his\narguments in his Second Replies in geometrical fashion, in the form of\nDefinitions, Postulates, Axioms, Common Notions, Propositions and\nDemonstrations (Dear 1995: 44\u201345). But at the end of the\nsixteenth century, Sanches would have none of it. Probably influenced\nby what he had read of\n Carneades\u2019\n sceptical-empiricist critique of mathematics\u2019 universal truths\n(cf. Cicero, Academica 2.116\u2013118; Sextus Empiricus,\nAgainst the Professors Book III: \u201cAgainst the\nGeometers\u201d), Sanches anonymously challenged the\n Platonist mathematics\n of the most renowned mathematician of the age. In the guise of a\nmodern day Carneades, Sanches wrote:\n\n\nIn my opinion\u2026 lest the senses should fail us, we should\nattempt to get whatever we can get through the eyes, with the help of\ncompass and rule, and not get into long, complicated demonstrations\nthat often make things more confusing. Far is it for me to praise an\noverabundance of complex and long demonstrations, by which we often\nmake more obscure that which in itself was clear. (LC: 300: #10, my\ntranslation)\n\n\nFor Sanches, therefore, the geometrical sign functions in the same way\nas the thing represented. In other words, geometry, for Sanches, is\nthe science of phenomenal objects of perception. Here Jean-Paul\nDumont\u2019s explanation of the way in which\n ancient scepticism\n understood phenomena may aid in contextualizing Sanches\u2019 own\nview. For the ancient sceptics, writes Dumont: \n\n\nThe phenomenon is not a subjective representation that exists only for\nthought, or for the imagination of the perceiving subject. The\nphenomenon is a material reality or, if one prefers, a body. (1972: 8)\n\n\n\nThis Protagorean scepticism\u2014and rejection of Platonism\u2014is\nexemplified in Sanches\u2019 critique of Proclus\u2019\n(412\u2013485 CE) commentary on Proposition XIV of Euclid\u2019s\nElements.\n\nSanches had addressed his critique of Proclus\u2019 commentary in an\nearlier letter he sent to Clavius. However, while this first letter\nwas lost, the extant letter, \u201cAd. C. Clavium Epistola\u201d,\ndemonstrates his dissatisfaction with Clavius\u2019 Scholastic appeal\nto consecrated authority or Proclus. In the first letter, Sanches\ncongratulates Clavius for his ability to demonstrate some of\nEuclid\u2019s propositions, with fewer words than Proclus and even\nEuclid. In keeping with common opinion, he believes it is a virtue to\nstate things as clearly as possible in order to avoid unnecessary\nconfusion \u201cespecially in mathematics, where we should understand\nas much as possible through the use of our senses\u201d (LC: 300:\n#10, my translation).\n\nWhile the first part of the paragraph above refers to the virtue of\nbrevity, the second, and more important part of it, has to do with\nSanches\u2019 empiricist notion of mathematics, for this is the basis\nof Sanches\u2019 direct critique of Proclus, and indirectly of\nClavius. Sanches writes to Clavius: \n\n\n\u2026 [Proclus] says that angles ACF and angle ACE are equal to two\nright angles, to which you respond that such angles should be added\nseparately and not in terms of one being part of the other, and that\nin this way, they are equal to two right angles. We had already come\nto that response to in previous discussion on the matter, and we agree\nthat we have refuted it [Proclus] satisfactorily. Nevertheless, we\nwill demonstrate it now with greater clarity. (LC: 301: #12)\n\n\nAnd from here, Sanches, with more than a touch irony, similar to that\nexhibited in many parts of QNS/TNK, says the following:\n\n\nSuppose I said that the eminent Clavius with his own head is a Janus\nwith two heads, would anyone believe me? Suppose that a father common\nto you and me, were to leave you in his testament two parcels of\narable lands, the ones that are two right angles, and made me the\nexecutor, would you be satisfied if I gave you the equivalent of the\nland represented by angle ACF\n [figure 1],\n which according to Proclus\u2019 demonstration equals two right\nangles? But on the other hand, we would have to consider this, for the\nquestion is one of geometry, which is to say, of measuring the\nland. (LC: 301: #12, my emphasis)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nHere we witness Sanches turning to the etymology of geometry\n(\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1), meaning: the measurement\nof the land or earth (terrae mensura), followed by a second\nexample, which much like the first is based on a pragmatist view of\nmathematics\n [figure 2].\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nIf you were to purchase a piece of cloth of the length AB, in order to\nmake a jacket, and the merchant were to give you a piece of cloth of\nsize CD alleging that that CD and CE were equivalent to AB,\ndon\u2019t you think the jacket would come out too short? (LC: 301:\n#12, my translation).\n\n\nHe summarily concludes: \n\n\nIf one were to proceed in this fashion in all mathematical matters, in\nwhich way would math be different than other deceiving disciplines?\n\n\n\nProclus was a Pythagorean and Platonic philosopher, the author of two\ncommentaries on Plato\u2019s Timaeus and the\nParmenides. For Proclus mathematical objects\u2014and that,\nof course, included the objects of geometry\u2014were not derived by\nway of abstraction from sensible particulars, but rather from ideas\nalready contained in the mind. And it was this very kind of\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d philosophy that Sanches opposed. For Sanches\nconcepts were either unprovable outside of their circular discursive\nlanguage (e.g., the syllogism), or easily dismissed through the\nsenses, as in the two cases mentioned above. It is for this reason\nthat one can justly qualify Sanches\u2019 philosophy as being\nempiricist and sceptical at once. Clavius, the addressee of the\nletter, was clearly against of the sceptics\u2019 conception of\nknowledge. Chikara Sasaki writes: \n\n\nClavius seems to have known to some extent how the skeptics attacked\nhuman knowledge. He is also reported to have reacted against a\nskeptical attitude in astronomy, which took an instrumental view\nconcerning the status of astronomical hypothesis, defending a kind of\nrealist philosophy together with Johannes Kepler. (Sasaki 2003: 58)\n\n\n\nAnd Clavius himself in opposition to Pyrrhonism wrote:\n\n\nUnless one was revived by the recognition and knowledge of arithmetic,\ngeometry and dialectic (these arts had been established by\nforefathers), he would almost arrive at the undecidedness of the\nPyrrhonists (they were philosophers who decided nothing but doubted\neverything). (Clavius quoted in Sasaki 2003: 58)\n\n\nAlmost as a challenge, then, Sanches ended his letter to Clavius, with\nthe following words: \n\n\nDo not ask who I am, for I am another Carneades [214\u2013129/8 BCE]:\nwho rather than being a friend of glory, is a friend of the truth and\nof you. Goodbye. (LC: 305 #18) \n\n\nThis, in a nutshell, describes his brand of scepticism, which rather\nthan being absolute in its denial of truth is a denial of certainty\nand perfect knowledge, and the Scholastic belief that the Aristotelian\nsyllogism guaranteed access to truth. For Sanches the truths of the\nsyllogism and dialectic were the immanent truths of (self-referential)\nlanguage, and nothing else.\n2.3 Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known\n\nSanches, the self-proclaimed follower of Carneades, begins\nQNS/TNK with the famous quote from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics: \u201c\u2018Mankind has an inborn desire to\nknow\u2019\u201d (TNK: 166, quoting Met. 1, 980a). As\nElaine Limbrick points out: \n\n\nThis quotation from the first line of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics ironically prefaces a treatise whose entire\npurpose is to destroy the Aristotelian system of knowledge by pointing\nout the inadequacies of the Aristotelian scientific methodology and\nthe failure of most ancient philosophers to formulate a theory of\nknowledge leading to absolute truth. (TNK: 166\u2013167, note 8) \n\n\nBut the irony doesn\u2019t stop there. Also ironic is the fact that\nThat Nothing is Known, marks a turning point in\nphilosophy\u2014as did Descartes\u2019 Meditations on First\nPhilosophy sixty years later\u2014from an emphasis in\nmetaphysics to one in epistemology; a philosophical turn often\nassociated with the birth of Western modern philosophy. To the person\nfamiliar with Descartes\u2019 Discourse on the Method (1637)\nthe opening paragraph of That Nothing is Known may appear\nsomewhat surprising, since the methodical doubt expressed in the first\nperson, conversational tone in the Discourse (Part II) seems\nalmost directly lifted from Sanches\u2019 QNS/TNK (more on\nSanches and Descartes in\n \u00a74).\n The French historian of philosophy, \u00c9tienne Gilson was among\nfirst to note the similarity of the language employed by both thinkers\nto give personal voice to their distinct notions of scepticism (Gilson\n1925: 267\u2013268). Sanches wrote:\n\n\nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into every-thing in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\nproffered to it; but a little later it was overtaken by indigestion,\nand began to spew it all forth again. Even at that period I was\nseeking to find some sustenance for my mind, such that my mind could\ngrasp it completely and also enjoy it without reservations; but no one\ncould appease my longing. I pored over the utterances of past\ngeneration of men, and picked the brains of my contemporaries. All of\nthem gave me the same answer, yet they brought me no satisfaction at\nall. Yes, I admit that some of them reflected a kind of shadow-image\nof the truth, but I found not one who gave an honest and full report\nof the judgments one ought to form concerning facts [res].\nSubsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to question everything,\nand to examine the facts themselves as though no one had ever said\nanything about them, which is the proper method of acquiring\nknowledge. I broke everything down into its ultimate first principles.\n(TNK: 167)\n\n\nFrom this point on, Sanches who begins by taking on Scholastic\nAristotelianism, states that his treatise will be written in simple,\nplain language. \u201cAccordingly you are not to look in me for an\nelegant, polished style\u201d (TNK: 171). He could write, if he\nwanted to, in such a style, he tells his reader, but he refuses to do\nso because \u201cTruth slips away while we substitute one word for\nanother and employ circumlocutions\u2014for this is verbal\ntrickery\u201d (TNK: 171). If that is what the reader wants then she\nshould turn to the elegant language of the rhetoricians like Cicero.\n\n\n\nAnd you should not ask me to quote many authorities, or to treat my\nauthorities with deference; deference is rather the mark of a servile,\nuntrained mind than of one that is truly investigating the Truth.\n(TNK: 171\u2013172) \n\n\nThe aim of such statements was clearly to criticize and to distinguish\nhimself from the Aristotelian emphasis on rhetoric as practiced by the\nScholastics. Rather than follow Aristotle, or any other authority, he\nwrote, \n\n\nI shall follow Nature alone. Authority bids us believe,\nwhereas Reason demonstrates; the former is more suited to\nfaith, the latter to the sciences. (TNK: 172) \n\n\nHere his notion of science is highly significant, because it is this\non which his scepticism rests. Science, as becomes clear by the end of\nThat Nothing is Known, has to do with rational demonstrations\nbased on facts or things (rerum) that come to us from the\nsenses (the eyes), albeit imperfectly. What Sanches seems to find most\ndifficult to \u201cswallow\u201d are metaphysical statements and\narguments that cannot be proven, except syllogistically by accepting\ntheir first principles on faith. Concepts that do not \u201cpossess\nan understanding of natural phenomena [\u201cres\nintelligas\u201d, QNS: 92]\u201d are \u201cinventions\u201d,\nsays Sanches; \u201cfor who could understand non-existent\nthings?\u201d (TNK: 168). The list of such abstract concepts include:\n\u201cDemocritus\u2019s Atom, Plato\u2019s Ideas,\nPythagoras\u2019s Numbers, and Aristotle\u2019s Universals, Active\nIntellect, and Intelligences\u201d (TNK: 168). He addresses himself,\nhe says, only to those who are \u201c\u2018not bound by an oath of\nfidelity to any master\u2019s words,\u2019\u201d but rather\n\u201cassess the facts for themselves, under the guidance of\nsense-perception and reason\u201d (TNK: 168). Having said this, he\nends the introduction to QNS/TNK, just as he did the Poem of\nthe Comet, with the sceptical \u201cQuid?\u201d or\nWhat?\n\n\u201cI do not know even this one thing, namely that I know\nnothing\u201d, is the opening sentence of the treatise (TNK: 172).\nSanches, next considers whether this is a paradoxical or contradictory\nprinciple of scepticism. For if you know how to establish\nthat you do not know anything, it follows that you already know\nsomething. Furthermore, he argues, if you \u201chave understood the\nambiguity of the inference, you have clearly perceived that nothing is\nknown\u201d (TNK: 173). And nothing is known, clearly because such\nambiguities only point to the fact that language does not give us\naccess to absolute knowledge. Dialectical, logical, and linguistic\nentanglements such as the one mentioned above only proves his point.\nThus in an allusion to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n(995a30), he asks his reader to help him \u201cuntie this knot\u201d\n(TNK: 173). This marks the beginning of his critique of Aristotelian\nnominalism.\n\nFor Sanches names are arbitrary, and therefore they can in no way\ndefine \u201cthe nature of things\u201d, or their essences. Now, if\nyou argue that you can use definitions to demonstrate the\nnature of a thing, \u201cthen show me one such\u201d, responds\nSanches. In a manner that recalls some twentieth century philosophers\nof language, Sanches questions whether words like Being, Substance,\nand Essence mean anything at all beyond the circularity of their\ndefinitions, and whether we even understand what we mean when we\nemploy them. For example, with respect to the notion of Being, he\nwrites: \n\n\nYou will say that you will not define this being, for it has no higher\ngenus to which it belongs. This I do not understand, nor do you. You\ndo not know what Being is; much less do I. (TNK: 175) \n\n\nTo muddy the waters even more, we often use different names to refer\nto the same thing (res), e.g., \u201cBeing, Substance, Body,\nLiving, Animal, Man, and finally Socrates\u201d to refer to humans.\nThis way a human being \u201cwho is something large, solid, and\nperceptible by the senses\u201d becomes an incomprehensible,\nconceptual abstraction.\n\nIn fact, not only do we not know anything through language, we do not\neven know what is \u201c\u2018knowledge\u2019\n[scientia]\u201d (TNK: 177). Statements such as\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cKnowledge is a mental disposition, acquired\nby demonstration\u201d only beg the question, what is \u201ca mental\ndisposition\u201d? And this, says Sanches, he does not know, so\nAristotle\u2019s definition of knowledge has failed to provide any\nkind of knowledge about what constitutes knowledge. \u201cYou are\nattempting to force me into a linear series of categorical\npropositions\u201d, writes Sanches as though he were playing some\nkind of language game with another philosopher (player); and\ncontinues, \u201cfrom these continually onwards, to Being\u2014and\nwhat that is, you do not know\u201d (TNK: 178). In this\nmanner all questions of knowledge are reduce to categorical\npropositions, and what are categorical propositions, if not \u201ca\nlong series of words\u201d (TNK: 178). Now, if such a term as a\n\u201cmental disposition\u201d is obscure, so is, to the same\ndegree, the definition of a \u201cdemonstration\u201d, says Sanches.\nFor a demonstration is defined as a \u201c\u2018syllogism\u2019\nthat gives birth to knowledge\u201d and so judges Sanches in his\nTribunal of Truth, \u201cYou have been guilty of a circular argument,\nand have deceived me just as you have deceived yourself\u201d (TNK:\n181). Not to mention, that there simply is \u201cno science\n[scientia] of syllogism\u201d. And there is no science, or\nknowledge that can be derived from the syllogism because all of\nAristotle, including the Metaphysics, is nothing but an\ninquiry about a name, as for \n\n\nexample whether substance can be predicated of a man\u2026And\ninasmuch as no one can know this for sure, there is no knowledge,\neither of things [\u201crerum\u201d, QNS: 101] or words\n[\u201cverborum\u201d, QNS: 101]. (TNK: 183)\n\n\nWe begin and end with particulars. In other words, with material\nobjects of perception: like this table before me, and not any\nsort of Platonic Form of table. \n\n\nIndividuals alone exist, and can be perceived; it is only of\nindividuals that knowledge can be possessed, and only from individuals\nthat it can be sought, \n\n\nargues Sanches. \n\n\nIf this is not so, show me where those \u2018universals\u2019 you\nspeak of occur in nature; you will admit that they occur in the\nparticulars themselves. (TNK: 213) \n\n\nSanches is clearly a nominalist. In fact, midway through\nQNS/TNK, he writes in capital letters: \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS\nPERFECT UNDERSTANDING OF A THING\u201d (TNK: 200). As Joseph Moreau\npoints out in \u201cDoute et Savoir chez Francisco Sanches\u201d\n(1960), this conception of knowledge or science as the \u201cabsolute\nand perfect\u201d understanding of a thing, is a left-over of ancient\nthought (1960: 37). But again, in any case, such \u201cperfect\nunderstanding\u201d only means apprehending all the qualities of a\nparticular object of perception. It does not mean apprehending the\nobject or the thing-in-itself, to put it in Kantian terms. Sanches\nwrites:\n\n\nThe sense perceives only the outward appearance of things, and does\nnot attain understanding (I am for the moment applying the word\n\u201csense\u201d to the eye). It is the mind that receives\nimages from the sense, and considers them. If the sense was deceived,\nso is the mind; but if not, what follows next? The mind regards only\nthe images of things, which the eye has taken in; it studies them from\nthis side and from that, and turns them about, putting the questions\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d and \u201cWhence comes its nature?\u201d\nand \u201cWhy\u201d\u2014and no more than this, for it too sees\nnothing that is certain. (TNK: 236)\n\n\nNot only does sensory perception fail to give us the answers to\nquestions of essences, natures, and origins (of noumena), it\nalso fails to give us certainty; for all we perceive are\n\u201caccidents\u2026the most commonplace of all existents\u201d\n(TNK: 237). We can only make inferences, says Sanches, from the\n\u201caccidents\u201d of \u201ccompound bodies\u201d. The\nimpediment to knowledge, he interestingly states, does not reside in\nthe object, but rather in the perceiving subject who cannot access\nthings themselves. \n\n\nExperience is in every instance deceitful and difficult. Even if it is\npossessed perfectly, it only reveals the external aspect of events; in\nno way does it reveal the natures of things. (TNK: 278) \n\n\nSanches continues:\n\n\nIn respect to the natures of things, it [judgment] reveals them only\nby speculation; and since it has not ascertained them by means of\nexperience, not only does it too fail to reach the thing itself, but\nsometimes it forms an opinion in exactly the wrong sense. (TNK:\n278)\n\n\nObviously if we do not have access to the things themselves, but only\nto the outward appearances of particulars, we cannot come to know\nthings by their causes either: \u201cWhence comes its nature?\u201d\nas he says. We are told, states Sanches, that knowledge means\nunderstanding something by its causes. But this cannot be the case and\nthe example he gives to illustrate his point, is that of the\nfather-son causal relation from Aristotle\u2019s Physics\n194b30: \u201cthe father is the cause of the child\u201d. But this,\nargues Sanches, does not lead to any kind of knowledge about the\nchild, \u201cfor what does my father contribute to an understanding\nof me?\u201d (TNK: 195). Nothing. The infinite regress\nrequired by the notion of causes applies no less to universals than it\ndoes to particulars. For even if one were to stop at God, as\n\u201cboth the first cause and the final end of all things\u201d\n(TNK: 196), and avoid the infinite, in \n\n\navoiding the infinite you fall into what is infinite and measureless,\nincomprehensible, ineffable and beyond the reach of the understanding.\n(TNK: 196) \n\n\nAnd yet, according to you, says Sanches to his reader, this Being that\nis admittedly beyond your understanding \u201cis the cause of\neverything; and therefore, according to your definition, understanding\nof Him is necessary for the understanding of His works\u201d, which\nonly proves that \u201cyou know nothing\u201d (TNK: 196). It was\nthis, Sanches\u2019 fideism that probably saved him from a fate\nsimilar to that of Giordano Bruno\u2019s. Sanches\u2019 target was\nAristotelian epistemology, never faith. He denied not only knowledge\nof efficient and first causes, but also of material and formal causes.\nAristotle\u2019s answers to sundry philosophical matters failed to\nconvince him. When Aristotle wrote in the Posterior Analytics\nthat \u201c[s]ome hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the\nprimary premises, there is no scientific knowledge\u201d (1.3\n72b5\u20136), he was addressing the very sceptical notion of\nknowledge held by someone like Sanches. \u201cOur own\ndoctrine\u201d, wrote Aristotle, \u201cis that not all knowledge is\ndemonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate\npremises is independent of demonstration\u201d (1.3\n72b18\u201320, my emphasis). But this is exactly the problem for\nSanches; for if primary and immediate premises do not require\ndemonstration, that means one has perfect knowledge of them, as one\nwould of first causes (like God), but that is not true. And if one\ndoes not have perfect knowledge of primary and immediate premises,\nthen where do they come from? What makes an indemonstrable primary\npremise the guarantor of knowledge? Nothing, answers Sanches. Primary\npremises are inventions that we need to take on faith in order to\nelude an infinite regress, and end up in the kind of scepticism that\nAristotle wanted to avoid. However, if, as Aristotle proposed,\n\u201cdemonstration must be based on premises prior to and better\nknown than the conclusion\u201d (1.3 72b25\u201326), and\ndemonstrations were based on premises that were themselves arbitrary\ninventions, then demonstrations were not to be taken as reflecting\nperfect knowledge, or as Sanches would have it, any knowledge at all.\nSanches writes:\n\n\n\u201cKnowledge is acquired by demonstration\u201d: this in turn\nassumes a definition. Now, definitions cannot be proved, but\nhave to be believed; therefore demonstration based on\nassumptions (ex suppositis) will produce knowledge of a\nsuppositious kind, not sound exact knowledge\u2026So the conclusions\nto be drawn from these first principles will be things assumed, not\nthings known. (TNK: 201)\n\n\nTherefore Aristotle\u2019s statement in the Posterior\nAnalytics that \u201csince the object of pure scientific\nknowledge cannot be other than it is, the truth obtained by\ndemonstrative knowledge will be necessary\u201d (1.3 73a2\u201323),\nwas epistemologically insufficient for Sanches. Such necessity would\nmerely be the syllogistic necessity of a conclusion following from\narbitrary premises. But beyond the logical, there was also a\npsychological dimension to Sanches\u2019 scepticism, which is\nimplicit in the rhetorical tone of QNS/TNK, and the ever\npresent other, to whom the treatise is directed. The tone vacillates\nfrom exasperation to despair at not being able to know more than what\nis derived from the language and the senses. Sanches dramatically\nstates:\n\n\nHow unhappy our situation is! We are blind in the midst of light. I\nhave often reflected about light, but always given up without thinking\nit through or understanding or comprehending it. It is the same if you\nreflect on the will and the intellect and other objects that are not\nperceived by means of the senses. (TNK: 243)\n\n\nAnd in words that anticipate Descartes\u2019 certainty regarding the\nexistence of the cogito (cf. Cottingham 1998: 9), he\ndeclares: \n\n\nOf this I am sure, that I am at this moment thinking of the words that\nI am writing, and that I wish to write them, and long for them both to\nbe true and win your approval; (TNK: 243) \n\n\nbut \n\n\nwhen I try to reflect on what this thinking is, and this wishing, and\nthis longing\u2026then my thinking quite fails me, my wishing is\nfrustrated, and my yearning grows ever greater while my concern also\nincreases. (TNK: 243) \n\n\nAll this initially reminds us of Descartes; but later in a pessimistic\ntone, he goes on to say that it is this epistemological uncertainty,\nthis wish to understand (cognitio) \u201cinward ideas\u201d\nand the impossibility of attaining such knowledge and understanding\nbeyond the senses that drives him to despair. \u201cI see nothing\nthat I could seek to lay hold on, or might possibly grasp\u201d (TNK:\n243), he writes in frustration. Then in a moment that recalls\nVives\u2019 scepticism (cf. Casini 2009), he ponders: if I am\n\u201cincapable of comprehending [even] the self\u201d perfectly,\nhow am I \u201cto comprehend the most abstruse secrets of Nature,\namong which are included spiritual things\u2026?\u201d (TNK: 239).\nClearly, argues Sanches, no one doubts that scientific knowledge\n(scientia) ought to be perfect, but there is nothing, not\neven in Nature, that is perfect (TNK: 289). And yet this does not lead\nSanches to the equanimity or ataraxia\n(\u1f00\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1) of the Stoics.\nInstead his impassioned scepticism encourages the active search for\nknowledge. To that end, he ends his treatise with the exhortation:\n\u201cTo work\u201d (TNK: 290) and asks his imaginary interlocutor\nto teach him what he knows, while he sets to do the double work of\nexamining \u201cThings\u201d while questioning everything\nthat ought to be questioned. Like the Poem of the Comet the\ntreatise\u2019s final word is the interrogative: Quid?/What?\n3. Sanches\u2019 Empiricist Scepticism\n\nOne topic of debate regarding Sanches\u2019 scepticism revolves\naround the question of whether he was an Academic sceptic like\nCarneades with whom he identified himself in his letter to Clavius\n (\u00a72.2)\n or whether his scepticism was of the Pyrrhonian variety as Pierre\nBayle (1647\u20131706) claimed it to be in his Dictionary entry on\nSanches (1697 [1820: 76]). However, the distinction between Pyrrhonian\nand Academic scepticism has not always been clear (cf. Striker 1996:\n140\u2013141, 148\u2013149). For Popkin (1964), Sanches\u2019\nscepticism unlike\n Pyrrho\u2019s\n (c. 360 BCE\u2013c. 270 BCE) or\n Sextus Empiricus\u2019\n (c. 160 CE\u2013c. 210 CE), does not call for the suspension of\njudgment \u201cbut rather the more full-fledged negative dogmatism of\nthe Academics\u201d (Popkin 1964: 41). Popkin continues: \n\n\nThe Pyrrhonists, with their more thoroughgoing scepticism, could\nneither assent to the positive theory of knowledge, nor to the\ndefinite conclusion that nihil scitur. (Popkin 1964: 42) \n\n\nBut this characterization of Sanches\u2019 \u201cnihil\nscitur\u201d does not seem completely correct either, for it did\nnot mean, as previously suggested, that absolutely nothing was known.\nInstead Sanches presented it as a diagnosis, pertinent on the one\nhand, to the medical treatment of the body and on the other, to\nphilosophical inquiry concerning the things (rerum) that\ncould indeed be known with some degree of certainty (Lupoli 2009).\nNow, while Limbrick, like Popkin, also views Sanches as an Academic\nsceptic, she, on the other hand emphasizes the notion of Carneadean\nprobabilism and its connection to Sanches\u2019 \u201cmedical\npractice\u201d (1988: 79). To the point, it is not clear that Sanches\nhad any direct knowledge of Sextus Empiricus\u2019 work; what is\nevident, nevertheless, is that he was familiar with Galen\u2019s\nwork, which seems to have influenced his own empiricist\nscepticism.\n\nAdmittedly, pairing Sanches with Galen may at first seem rather odd,\ngiven the latter\u2019s rejection of scepticism. In \u201cMy Own\nBooks\u201d he wrote that he wished to learn \u201cthe science of\nlogical proof\u201d (GAL2: 18) and the method by which to recognize\nwhether a particular proof was sound or not. To accomplish such, he\nsays, he turned to \u201cthe best-reputed Stoic and Peripatetic\nphilosophers of the time\u201d (GAL2: 18), but their conflicting\nlogical theories culminated in confusion. \n\n\nIndeed, as far as these teachers were concerned, I might well have\nfallen into a Pyrrhonian despair of knowledge, if I had not had a firm\ngrip of the disciplines of geometry, mathematics, and\narithmetic\u2026. (GAL2: 18) \n\n\nAnd yet while Galen divided the different approaches to knowledge into\nroughly that of the Rationalists (or Dogmatists), the Empiricists, and\nthe Methodics, his scientific method was a mix of each one of them,\nemphasizing a marriage between theory and empiricism. In his\nintroduction to Galen: Selected Works, P. N. Singer writes:\n\n\n\nThe Empiric school, which was founded in the mid-third century BC by a\nfollower of Herophilus [335 BC\u2013280 BC], was influenced by\nSceptical philosophy, and represented an attempt to engage in the art\nof medicine with as little as possible in the way of theoretical\npostulates. (Singer 1997: xiv) \n\n\nThis almost seems as a corollary to Sanches\u2019 sceptical rejection\nof the theoretical, dogmatic postulates of the Aristotelian syllogism\nand Plato\u2019s Ideas. \n\n\nDenying the possibility of true knowledge concerning the body, the\nEmpiric\u2019s view is that the doctor must rely on experience\n(peira) and precise observation\n(t\u0113r\u0113sis)\u2026. (1997: xiv) \n\n\nIn that light, if indeed it was the mathematical disciplines that\nsaved Galen from falling into a Pyrrhonian despair concerning\nknowledge, it is because his vision of mathematics seems to have had\nthe function of proving along with experience (or experimentation)\ntheories necessary to arrive at correct diagnoses, and not because he\nenvisioned mathematics as an abstract, Platonic discipline.\n\nThus, what prima facie seems to be a major difference between\nGalen and Sanches regarding the truths mathematics may not be so great\nafter all. Doubtlessly, Galen was an Aristotelian philosopher and\nphysician, who subscribed to Aristotelian logic and definitions,\nwhereas Sanches was not and did not; and yet much like Sanches he\ndoubted that any knowledge of the noumenal world (e.g., God,\nthe substance and immortality of the soul, etc.) was possible.\nInterestingly, Galen\u2019s \u201cAn Outline of Empiricism\u201d\nbegins with the following sentence: \n\n\nAll doctors who are followers of experience, just like the\nphilosophers who are called Sceptics, refuse to be called after a man,\nbut rather want to be known by their frame of mind. (GAL1: 23) \n\n\nSuch a statement bears resemblance to Sanches\u2019 questioning of\nuniversals for the very much the same reason; that is to say, because\nthe experience of things (rerum) is always the experience of\nparticulars and not of universals (like Man). Galen later explains:\n\n\n\nWe say that the art of medicine has taken its origin from experience,\nand not from indication. By \u201cexperience\u201d, we mean the\nknowledge of something which is based on one\u2019s own perception,\nby \u201cindication\u201d, the knowledge which is based on rational\nconsequence. For perception leads us to experience, whereas reason\nleads the dogmatics to indication. (GAL1: 24) \n\n\nEarlier empiricists, argues Galen, viewed perception and experience as\nboth the activity of seeing for oneself (autopsia) and as\ncognition, and that is how he thought medical practice ought to be\nconducted (GAL1: 25\u201326). Here we have Galen the physician and\nthe philosopher who wrote: \u201cThe best doctor is also a\nphilosopher\u201d (GAL2: 30\u201334), and the Galen who was to be a\npredecessor of Sanches. But Galen was not alone in being a philosopher\nand a physician. His contemporary Sextus Empiricus seems also to have\nbeen both.\n\nIn section XXXIV of Outlines of Scepticism, Sextus Empiricus\nposed the question \u201cIs medical empiricism the same as\nscepticism?\u201d (SE-OS: 62: 235), to which he answered that if\nempiricism made assertions about \u201cthe inapprenhensibility of\nunclear matters\u201d then it could not be the same as scepticism,\nand the same applied to scepticism, for scepticism was precisely a\nrejection of belief in things that could not be proven (dogmatism).\nNowhere else did these two modes of thought function better, wrote\nSextus Empiricus, than in medicine. He argued:\n\n\nThey might rather adopt, as it seems to me, what is called the Method,\nfor this alone of the medical schools seem to practice no rashness in\nunclear matters and does not presume to say whether they are\napprehensible or inapprehensible, but it follows what is apparent,\ntaking thence, in line with Sceptical practice, what seems to be\nexpedient. (SE-OS: 63: 236\u2013237).\n\n\nMedicine, then, for Sextus Empiricus was what medicine would equally\nbe for the late sixteenth century Sanches: a combination of empiricism\nand scepticism. Medicine took as much from philosophical scepticism,\nas philosophical empiricism took from medicine. Galen\u2019s above\ncritique of \u201cindications\u201d or indicans (cf.\nMaclean 2002: 308\u2013310)\u2014which bears a certain similarity to\nSanches\u2019 critique of demonstration and naming\u2014is best\nexplained by Sextus Empiricus:\n\n\nA sign is indicative, they say, if it signifies that of which it is a\nsign not by having been observed evidently together with the thing it\nsignifies but from its proper nature and constitution (as bodily\nmovements are signs of the soul). That is why they also define this\nsign as follows: An indicative sign is a pre-antecedent statement in a\nsound conditional, revelatory of the consequent. There being two\ndifferent sorts of signs\u2026we argue not against all signs but\nonly against indicative signs, which seem to be a fiction of the\nDogmatists. For recollective signs are found convincing by everyday\nlife: seeing smoke, someone diagnoses fire, having observed a scar, he\nsays that a wound was inflicted. (SE-OS: 93: 101, 102)\n\n\nTo put it Sanchean terms, indicative signs are helpful when they\nrefer to particular things (rerum) in the world; and\nthey are unhelpful when they refer to the dogmatic notion of\nuniversals. Just as Carmen de Cometa/Poem of the Comet was\nwritten to dispel the notion of comets as signs of bad things to come,\nDe divinatione per somnum, ad Aristotelem, rejects the idea\nthat any knowledge can be attained by way of demonic states,\nprophecies, or dreams. In John Owen\u2019s quirky but insightful\nbook, The Skeptics of the French Renaissance, one of the\ncharacters of the dialogue says at the very beginning of the chapter\non Sanches that \n\n\n[i]n an age when science and medicine was mixed up with astrology,\ndivination, charms, and an enormous farrago of superstitious nonsense,\nSanchez held up to his brother physicians the torch of a true Science\nfounded upon experiment, and a due recognition of natural laws. (1893:\n617) \n\n\nThis is obviously significant for its recognition of the importance of\nthe scientific method in Sanches\u2019 elaboration of his scepticism.\nHere both Damian Caluori and Limbrick agree that Sanches\u2019s\ncritique of Aristotelianism and his proposed scepticism was \u201cnot\nonly of theoretical concern\u201d (Caluori 2007: 45), but a practical\none that sought \u201cthe answer to the question of the right\nscientific method to be used in the quest for true knowledge\u201d\n(Limbrick 1988: 25). And while Caluori argues that his empiricist\nscepticism was Pyrrhonian in nature, what is clear for both Caluori\nand Limbrick is that his scepticism was by no means absolute, and that\nfundamental to his rejection of Aristotelianism was his medical\ntraining where particular things needed to be perceived and analyzed\nnot by their names or definitions but rather by the external qualities\nthat they presented to the senses, since such practical matters as\ndiagnoses needed to be made, and cures needed to be prescribed and\nadministered. In comparison to the treatment of the body, such a thing\nas the content of his mind would have seemed much less important to\nSanches.\n4. Sanches and Descartes\n\nThe division of the world into one of external and internal realities,\nis one of the notions that Sanches and Descartes share. Where they\neach end up, is, of course, completely different. What is similar, on\nthe other hand, is their starting point; that is to say, the way they\narticulate the radical doubt with which they begin their respective\ninquiries; and for that reason Sanches has often been considered a\nprecursor of Descartes. It is undeniable that the personal expression\nof their scepticism as found both in That Nothing is Know\n(1581) and the Discourse on the Method (1637) share more than\na coincidental resemblance. Pamela Kraus points out in her\nintroduction to the Discourse on Method [DM], that the word\n\u201cdiscours\u201d had a wider meaning in the seventeenth century\nsignifying among other things \u201c\u2018talk\u2019 or\n\u2018conversation\u2019\u201d ([DM: 1]). But this was not the case\nfor Sanches, who wrote Quod nihil scitur over forty years\nearlier, and whose conversational style was in the service of a\ntreatise aimed at the Aristotelianism of his time, and particularly at\nthe Aristotelian notion of demonstrative truths. What is indeed\nstriking are the passages in the Discourse that seem to be\ndirectly lifted from the Iberian philosopher\u2019s 1581 treatise.\nHere are two examples: the first from Sanches, the latter from\nDescartes:\n\n\nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into everything in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\npreferred to it\u2026Subsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to\nquestion everything, and to examine facts themselves as though no one\nhad ever said anything about them, which is the proper method\n[\u201cmodus\u201d, QNS: 92] of acquiring knowledge. I\nbroke everything down into its ultimate first principles. Beginning as\nI did, my reflection at this point, the more I reflected the more I\ndoubted. (TNK: 167)\n\n\nHere is Descartes in the Discourse: \n\n\nFrom my childhood I have been nourished upon letters, and because I\nwas persuaded that by their means one could acquire a clear and\ncertain knowledge of all that is useful in life, I was extremely eager\nto learn them. But as soon as I had completed the course of study at\nthe end of which one is formally admitted to the ranks of the learned,\nI completely changed my opinion. I had found myself beset by so many\ndoubts and errors that I came to think I had gained nothing from my\nattempts to become educated but increasing recognition of my\nignorance. (Descartes 1637 [PWD: 112\u2013113])\n\n\nHe will later say that among the steps included in his method is the\ndirection of his mind into the \u201csimplest and most easily known\nobjects in order to ascend little by little, step by step, to\nknowledge of the most complex\u201d (1637 [PWD: 120]), which even if\nit is not exactly what Sanches meant by \u201cfirst principles\u201d\n[\u201cextrema principia\u201d, QNS: 92], it does sound a\nlot like it.\n\nIn any case, one of the first to note the similarities in tone, and\neven to go as far as to declare Sanches a precursor of Descartes was\n\u00c9tienne Gilson in his commentary on Discours de la\nm\u00e9thode (1925). More than Charron or the Montaigne of\nApologie de Raimond Sebond (1580), it is Sanches, says\nGilson, who seems to have had the greater impact on Descartes\u2019\ndoubt and his response to the sceptical position (1925: 267, 268;\nPaganini 2009: 254\u2013255), given the \u201cstriking parallelism\nof their respective experiences\u201d (1925: 267, my translation). In\nfact, the linking of their names in the seventeenth century at the\nuniversities of Utrecht, Groningen and Leiden, says Limbrick, is what\nled them to be considered Pyrrhonian sceptics with atheistic leanings\n(TNK: 82). What nonetheless remains unknown is when and how Descartes\ncame across Quod nihil scitur. In Les premi\u00e8res\npens\u00e9es de Descartes (1979), Henri Gouhier conjectures\nthat Descartes might have come across Quod nihil scitur\nsometime during his student years at La Fl\u00e8che\n(1606\u20131614), or read the 1618 Frankfurt edition of the treatise\n(1979: 116), \u201cwhen he was in Frankfurt for the coronation of the\nEmperor Ferdinand II in 1619\u201d (Limbrick 1988: 83). According to\nLimbrick the Frankfurt 1618 edition of Quod nihil scitur\nseems to have impacted the European philosophical scene, and to have\ncontributed to Sanches\u2019 reputation as a leading Pyrrhonian\nsceptic (1988: 85). What is not at all convincing is that Descartes\nwould have been apprised of Sanches\u2019 treatise through a letter\naddressed by someone by the name of Huebner (supposedly an English\ndoctor), to Marin Mersenne.\n\nThis letter of August, 1641, can be found in Correspondance du P.\nMarin Mersenne, religieux minime. X, Du 6 ao\u00fbt 1640 \u00e0 fin\nd\u00e9cembre 1641 (1967: 730) wherein the author praises\nSanches\u2019 ingenious exaggerations concerning the possibility of\nacquiring perfect knowledge, and criticizes Cartesianism for not being\nable to advance (\u201cnon progreditur\u201d) beyond its\n\u201chyperbolical doubt\u201d (1967: 730) . But again, the letter\nis too late to serve as proof of Descartes\u2019 knowledge of\nSanches\u2019 treatise prior to the writing and publication of the\nDiscourse. Its intended target seems to have been an\nobjection to the perceived scepticism of the Meditations.\nThus, if Mersenne informed Descartes of Huebner\u2019s letter\ncomparing his work to that Sanches\u2019s, then the letter would only\nhave apprised Descartes that he was being compared with the Iberian\n\u201cPyrrhonist\u201d, which would not have made Descartes very\nhappy, given that by this time he had grown tired of answering\nobjections and trying to explain why his method was instead intended\nto dispel scepticism and ground a science on clear and distinct ideas\n(Mullin 2000: 8). Therefore, if we can imagine Descartes being upset\nabout being compared with Sanches, one can at least partially\nunderstand why he would be so, and would \u201crefuse\u201d to\nanswer the objection (Mullin 2000: 8). It has been conjectured, for\ninstance, that Descartes might have been thinking of Sanches when he\nwrote in the Discourse that the reason for his undertaking\nwas not to imitate or to copy \u201cthe sceptics, who doubt only for\nthe sake of doubting\u201d but rather \u201cto reach\ncertainty\u201d (1637 [PWD: 125]). Significantly, while most scholars\nof Sanches\u2019 work have noted the similarities between Sanches and\nDescartes, for others like Joseph Moreau (1960) and Joaquim de\nCarvalho (1955), there are significant differences. These similarities\ndisplayed in two parallel columns in the introduction to\nSanches\u2019 Opera philosophica (1955: xxx\u2013xxxiii),\nmerely establish, argues Carvalho, a \u201ccorrelation of\nwords\u201d (1955: xxxiii, my translation). One important difference\nbetween the two thinkers, says Carvalho, is that although Sanches\ndoubts our perfect knowledge of external things, he never doubts their\nexistence. This obviously was not the case for Descartes, for whom the\nsearch for certainty was the search for whatever knowledge could be\nacquired through the light of reason, and not through the senses. Thus\nfor Moreau one major difference between them was their opposing views\nconcerning the truths of mathematics (1960: 30\u201334): for Sanches\na posteriori and dubitable; for Descartes a priori\nand indubitable. What they did share was a rejection of the Scholastic\nappeal to external authority. For Descartes, the opinions of others\ncould never lead to the kind of certainty only a mind\n(cogito) reflecting on the content of its own thoughts could\nreach; and for Sanches the opinions of scholarly\nauthorities\u2014however illustrious\u2014did not help us to arrive\nat perfect knowledge. The assumed \u201cknowledge\u201d of the\nauthorities was derived from syllogistic and demonstrative logic,\nwhich depended on the circularity of its definitions and premises\n(verba) to arrive at their conclusions concerning things\n(rerum). More often than not, these Aristotelian scholars\nwith their verbal gymnastics created great confusion out of what was\notherwise clear, even to a child.\n\nThough a number of Sanches\u2019 contemporaries accused him of\nadvocating a radical form of Academic scepticism that led to\natheism\u2014as also occurred with Descartes\u2014Sanches\u2019\nsceptical project was not, as it may first seem given the title of the\ntreatise, either dogmatic or wholly destructive. And on this vital\npoint Richard H. Popkin (1963: ix; 1964: 42) and Gianni Paganini\n(2009: 249) concur. For Paganini, in fact, \n\n\nSanches\u2019s Quod nihil scitur contains, besides a\nskeptical demolition, also a pars construens, which seems\nparticularly relevant in order to understand the Cartesian certainty\nabout reflexive knowledge, typically the cogito. (2009: 249)\n\n\n\nThe personal crisis experienced by Sanches and Descartes which\nmotivated their epistemological inquiry concerning what could and\ncould not be known with certainty, was responded to by means of\nself-reflection. In both cases, albeit with very different approaches,\nthe self was the only legislator of certainty, and the only thing that\ncould be counted upon in founding a science: in Descartes\u2019 case,\nfounded on unquestionable internal, logical principles (\u201cI\ncannot doubt my own existence\u201d), and in Sanches\u2019\ncase, founded on the material things (rerum) the I\nperceives, albeit imperfectly. Significantly, what constituted the\ncertainty of the internal states for Descartes did not constitute\ncertainty for Sanches, and moreover such \u201ccertainty\u201d could\nnot serve as the foundation of a true science. In this respect,\nwhereas the late sixteenth century Sanches was operating within a\npre-Galilean Weltanschauung, Descartes undertaking studies in physics\nand astronomy that paralleled those of Galileo and\n\u201cGalilean\u201d science with its emphasis on mathematical\ndemonstration. For Descartes, mathematics was the language of Nature,\nand even physical things or \u201cnatural phenomena\u201d were\nmathematical, as he stated in the \u201cPrinciples of\nPhilosophy\u201d (1644 [PWD: 247]). This was clearly not the case for\nSanches, who in his letter to Clavius\n (\u00a72.2),\n denied the universal and a priori truths of mathematics,\nreducing mathematics to mere empirical measurement. In short, if\nDescartes\u2019 method culminated in the \u201cindubitable\u201d\ntruths of mathematics placed at the service of sciences like physics,\noptics, and astronomy, Sanches\u2019 sceptical method, with its\nacceptance of imperfect knowledge, culminated in the probable and\nempirical \u201ctruths\u201d of the science of medicine. Descartes,\nthe philosopher, mathematician, and physicist; Sanches, the\nphilosopher and physician: the former emphasized the mind over the\nbody (res cogitans over res extensa), and the latter\nthe body over the mind.\n\nDoubtlessly, such a generalization can only be taken so far; for\nDescartes too wanted to \u201creplace the speculative philosophy\ntaught in the schools\u201d with a \u201cpractical philosophy\u201d\nthat would employ his method even in an applied science like medicine,\nwhose primary goal was to maintain the health of the body: \u201cthe\nchief good and the foundation of all the other goods in life\u201d\n(1637 [PWD: 142\u2013143]). Most importantly was (1) their equal\nconcern with formulating a method that would allow them to arrive at\nknowledge of the world, and (2) the constructive aspect of their\nrespective scepticism, which in both cases was a starting point. And\nthough it seems by all accounts that Descartes integrated\nSanches\u2019 autobiographical narrative into the Discourse on\nthe Method, without due attribution, their projects were quite\ndifferent: one epistemologically based on sense perception, the other\nmetaphysically based on internal (a priori) first principles.\nIronically, it has been argued that Descartes turned \u201cfirst\nphilosophy\u201d into epistemology.\n5. Sanches\u2019 Place in the History of Philosophy\n\nRegardless of the extent of the debt Descartes owed Sanches, great or\nsmall, it is undeniable that even as a background figure in Cartesian\nstudies, Sanches holds a noteworthy place firstly in the history of\nscepticism, and secondly in the history of modern philosophy. Possibly\nthanks to Limbrick and Thomson\u2019s English edition of Quod\nnihil scitur, Sanches was at last acknowledged as a source in\nCartesian studies in Ariew, Cottingham, and Sorell\u2019s\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations: Background Source Materials\n(1998). Here, along with some new translations of selected passages\nfrom Quod nihil scitur, John Cottingham writes that \n\n\nthough Sanches, unlike Descartes, proposes no new method for the\nacquisition of knowledge, he does produce some interesting\nanticipations of the Cartesian approach, particularly when he\ndistinguishes between \u201cexternal\u201d objects of cognition and\nthe \u201cinner\u201d objects of the mind (e.g., its own inner\nawareness of its willing and thinking. (Cottingham 1998: 9) \n\n\nBut this is as much as Cottingham is willing to concede to Sanches,\nfor ultimately Sanches remains for him a man \u201ctrapped in the\ninescapable ignorance of the pre-Enlightenment world\u201d (1998: 9).\nIn some ways this has been the unfortunate fate of Sanches until very\nrecently: to be considered an interesting but insignificant\nphilosopher. This in part is due to the fact that the history of\nphilosophy used to be presented as a series of ex nihilo\nevents bearing the names of Plato, Aristotle,\n Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804),\n etc., as though one day there was nothing and then the next day there\nemerged, for example, the figure/event we know by the name of Kant.\nBut fortunately philosophy is no longer presented or taught this way.\nTherefore, if Sanches was not a major philosopher, the originality of\nhis work, for example, combining \u201cmedieval epistemological ideas\nand ancient sceptical habits of thinking\u201d (Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2000:\n243)\u2014certainly impacted the work of other philosophers of his\ntime and beyond. However, because no else would pay attention, certain\nearly twentieth century Portuguese and Spanish thinkers, often for\nnationalistic reasons, turned Sanches into the Spanish or Portuguese\n\u201cprecursor\u201d of Descartes, Bacon, Hobbes, and Kant. \n\nOne such writer was Te\u00f3filo [Teophilo] Braga (1843\u20131924),\na philologist and essayist, who was the second elected president of\nthe first Portuguese Republic (1911\u20131914). Not surprisingly,\nthen, in his 1881 essay \u201cO portuguez Sanches, precursor do\npositivismo\u201d (The Portuguese Sanches, precursor of positivism)\nBraga presented Sanches as precursor of\n Francis Bacon (1551\u20131626)\n and the nineteenth century positivism of\n Auguste Comte (1798\u20131856).\n And because Braga viewed Comte as a representative of the values of\nscience and republicanism, the \u201cPortuguese Sanches\u201d\n(supposedly \u201cborn in Braga\u201d) Sanches served as the perfect\nprecursor of the positivist ideas Braga himself embraced.\n\nIn Spain, Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo argued in his essay\n\u201cDe los or\u00edgenes del criticismo y del escepticismo y\nespecialmente de los precursores espa\u00f1oles de Kant\u201d\n(1918, On the origins of critique and scepticism and especially in the\nSpanish precursors of Kant) that given the similarity of the opening\npages of Descartes\u2019s Discourse on the Method and\nSanches\u2019 Quod nihil scitur, it was obvious that\nCartesianism was in large part the product of ideas stolen from\nSpanish philosophy (1918: 186). But nowhere in the essay does\nMen\u00e9ndez y Pelayo prove this, or bother to consider the\ndifferences between Sanches and Descartes. As to Kant\u2019s debt to\nSanches, he has little to say on this matter, except that some of\nSanches\u2019 ideas about God, eternity, and the creation of the\nworld, anticipated Kant\u2019s notion of the antinomies (1918: 195).\nFinally, the only thing that he says with some level of sobriety with\nrespect to Kant and Sanches, is that they both made manifest the idea\nthat one can believe in God without having to believe in metaphysics\nor logical demonstrations (1918: 196), and that was probably in order\nto accommodate philosophy with Spanish Catholicism.\n\nInterestingly, thirteen years earlier, in 1905, Eloy Bull\u00f3n y\nFern\u00e1ndez, wrote in Los Precursores espa\u00f1oles de\nBacon y Descartes that Sanches had anticipated Descartes, Bacon,\nand Comte (1905: 181). But here the tone is more conciliatory and\nsober, and Bull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez takes the trouble to call\nattention not only to similarities, but also to the differences\nbetween these thinkers. He recognizes, for instance, that while both\nSanchez and Descartes begin their project with a critique of\nscholasticism, and particularly, a critique of the appeal to\nauthority, their initial battle call, Sanches\u2019 dismissal of\nmetaphysics and its replacement with empiricism was not shared by\nDescartes (1905: 170); and neither was it by Bacon, despite the\nlatter\u2019s questioning of the syllogism in the Novum\nOrganum. What, according to Bull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez,\nSanches shares with Bacon is a belief in the observation of things\n(res) over the analysis of words (verba). And one\ncan certainly hear echoes of Sanches in aphorism XIII from the\nNovum Organum when Bacon writes: \n\n\nThe syllogism is not applied to the principles of the sciences, and is\nof no avail in intermediate axioms, as being very unequal to the\nsubtlety of nature. It forces assent, therefore, and not things\n[res]. (1620 [1902: 13\u201314]) \n\n\nWhere they part ways is that while Sanches did not trust the senses,\nBacon believed that one could arrive at certain truths through the\nobservation of natural phenomena, and thereby avoid \u201cthe\narrogance of dogmatism, and the despair of scepticism\u201d (1620\n[1902: 5]). Now, what Sanches had in common with Kant, says\nBull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez, is that neither one nor the other\nbelieved that the mind was capable of apprehending the things\nthemselves (1905: 179).\n\nWhat is missing from all these studies of Sanches who posit him as\nprecursor of this or that major philosopher\u2014from Braga (1881) to\nBull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez (1905), Men\u00e9ndez y Palayo\n(1918), and Fernando A. Palacios (1991: 27\u201329) to Carlos Mellizo\n(1982: 52\u201364)\u2014is a certain lack of rigor. More fruitful\nwould be to consider Sanches as a representative of modern scepticism\nwith roots going back to ancient scepticism\u2014someone whose form\nof scepticism impacted modern philosophy, even in cases where it went\nunacknowledged, as in the case of Kant. To this point, Dumont writes\nthat Kant\u2019s silence was historical in his dismissal of\nPyrrhonist and Academic scepticism; in his lack of knowledge regarding\nSextus Empiricus; and in designating Hume as the only author\nrepresentative of scepticism (1972: 73): as though Hume was not\nhimself responding to sceptics like Sextus Empiricus or Carneades. But\nas M.F. Burnyeat explains in \u201cThe Sceptic in his Place and\nTime\u201d, in Kant\u2019s silence regarding the sceptics,\nscepticism itself became \u201cthe name of something internal to the\nphilosopher\u2019s own thinking, his alter ego as it were\u201d\n(1987: 35). \n\nTwo philosophers who did acknowledge the importance of scepticism for\nphilosophy were\n G. W. Leibniz (1646\u20131716)\n and\n G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831;\n 1801 [1985]). As a matter of fact, in response to a letter by French\nmathematician, Pierre Varignon (1654\u20131722), who had asked him\nfor some clarification on what he meant by\n\u201cinfinitesimal\u201d, Leibniz reference\u2019s Sanches\u2019\nQuod nihil scitur and his challenge to Clavius with some\nadmiration. Such scepticism, he says to Varignon, is important because\nit keeps mathematics from becoming a dogmatic science (cf. de Olaso\n1987: 149\u2013150). The questions raised by sceptics like Sextus\nEmpiricus and Sanches, says Leibniz, are key for \u201cestablishing\nsound foundations for a science\u201d ([1702 [1970: 544]). Leibniz\nwrites: \n\n\nI have often thought that a reply by a geometrician to the objections\nof Sextus Empiricus and to the things which Francis Sanchez, author of\nthe book Quod nihil scitur, sent to Clavius, or to similar\ncritics, would be more useful than we can imagine. (1702 [1970: 544])\n\n\n\nThus perchance, in Leibniz\u2019s generous appreciation of the\nsceptics\u2019 challenge to dialectical and metaphysical dogmatism,\nlies the answer to what Dumont calls Kant\u2019s\n\u201csilence\u201d: that which according to the author of the\nCritique of Pure Reason did not need to be named, because it\nwas always at the heart of the philosophical enterprise.\n\nIn the Introduction to Scepticism from the Renaissance to the\nEnlightenment, the editors Richard H. Popkin and Charles B.\nSchmitt write that \u201cLittle effort seems to be made to study the\nclassical formulations, and the development of these from Sextus at\nleast to Hume and Kant\u201d (1987: 10); and while that may certainly\nbe true, even less effort has been made to include twentieth century\nphilosophers. In the introduction to Que nada se sabe,\nFernando A. Palacios states that for Sanches there was no difference\nbetween logic and rhetoric, as they both culminated in a series of\nlanguage games (1991: 24). Now, it would certainly be wrong to take\nthis analogy too far without due rigorous study, but there are moments\nin Sanches\u2019 scepticism regarding the truths of metaphysics and\nlanguage that remind one of the\n Wittgenstein\n of the Philosophical Investigations (cf. Fogelin 1981).\n\u201cSanchez\u2019s Quod nihil scitur almost reads like a\ntwentieth century text of analytic philosophy\u201d, wrote Popkin\n(1964: 41). And here, for example, such a comparison, and there are\nmany (e.g., Mikko Yrj\u00f6nsuuri\u2019s with the homunculus\nof philosophy of mind \u201cwho understands mental\nrepresentations\u201d, 2000: 239), could be a worthwhile starting\npoint. The history of scepticism is inseparable from the history of\nphilosophy, and the history runs backwards and forwards. In that\nhistory, Francisco Sanches, even as a \u201cminor\u201d figure, had\nsubstantial things to say about philosophy, and we need to overcome\nthe traditional assessments of Sanches, such as J.
