    "main_text": "Kinds of Change\n1. Kinds of Change\n\n\nA change is real if and only if it makes on its own a real difference\nto the world. Real change is (roughly) change involved in causing\nsomething, change an item is caused to undergo or change not\n\u201clogically parasitic\u201d on change in other things. (These\n\u201cor\u201ds are inclusive, not exclusive \u2014 one change can\nsatisfy more than one clause of this account.) Smith's kicking me\ninvolves changes in Smith. Kicking me makes on its own a real\ndifference in Smith. When Smith kicks me, I undergo various changes\nwhich count as real, intuitively \u2014 being kicked makes many real\ndifferences in me. On the other hand, when I become shorter than Smith\nbecause Smith grows, Smith changes really but I do not. Gaining height\nmakes a real difference in Smith, but Smith's gaining height doesn't\nmake a real difference in me. Rather, my becoming shorter than Smith\nin this way is logically parasitic on Smith's growing. It is simply a\nlogical consequence of a real change in something else, not a real\nchange itself.\n\n\nComing at the notion another way, a change is real if and only if\nthere is an absolutely or \u201cbroadly logically\u201d possible world in which\nit is either the only event that occurs in an entire universe or else\nthe sum of all events in a universe, while a change is a\n\u201clogical parasite\u201d if and only if this is not true of\nit. Consider Smith's kicking me. This looks like it could be the only\noccurrence in a universe. It is absolutely or \u201cbroadly logically\u201d\npossible that the universe simply sits there wholly static, then Smith\nkicks me, then the universe winks out of existence before anything\nelse happens. But actually, when we look more carefully, we see that\nin this case, the kick is not the only change. For it has parts which\nare shorter or spatially smaller changes. In the kick, for instance,\nSmith's leg first moves an inch, then another inch, etc., and each\nmovement consists spatially of discrete movements by various\nmuscles. The kick is not the only change, but in the odd universe I\ndescribed, it is the sum of all changes in a universe. No change with\nparts can be the only change in a universe, strictly speaking. On the\nother hand, it is not logically possible that my becoming shorter than\nSmith in the way described occur alone or be a sum of all changes\noccurring in a universe. For it to occur, Smith's growth must also\noccur. And Smith's growth is not a part of it. So changes are real if\nand only if they are logically independent events in the world's\nhistory. If God cannot change really, then, nothing can so act on him\nas to change him, his actions do not change him, and no change in God\ncould be the only event in a universe.  If God cannot change really,\nthen if had there been nothing other than God, there would have been\nno change at all, of any sort.\n\n\nIntrinsic changes are changes like learning or expanding, which\n(roughly) occur entirely within the changing item \u2014 which could\noccur if the universe ended at the item's \u201cskin.\u201d Putting\nthis more carefully, an item x has a property F\nintrinsically just if whether x is F is settled entirely\nby the states of x and x's proper parts (if any), and a\nchange is intrinsic just if its occurring consists entirely in a\nthing's gaining or losing a property had intrinsically. Changes which\nare not intrinsic are extrinsic. All changes in relations to other\nthings are extrinsic. For instance, if a dog moves to my left, I\nbecome a man with a dog on his left. This does not take place wholly\nwithin me; whether it occurs is not settled by my and my parts'\nstates. It also involves the dog, who exists outside me.\n\n\nExtrinsic changes aren't \u201creal\u201d in the sense above. I\nchange extrinsically when a dog comes to be on my left. The dog does\nnot so act on me at to make me have it on my left: the dog does\nnothing to me at all. And my becoming a man with a dog on his left\ncould not be the only event in a universe. For it to happen, a dog\nmust also move. But to say that extrinsic changes aren't\n\u201creal\u201d in the above sense is not to say that they don't\noccur. It is merely to classify them.\n\n\nThe classical and medieval authors who developed DDI did not operate\nwith an explicit classification of changes.  But Anselm, for instance,\nargues both that God is immutable and that His relations with other\nthings can change (Monologion 25) and Aquinas does the same (ST Ia 9\nand 13, 7). So as they understand DDI, it lets God change\nextrinsically. Suppose that at t, Quine begins to worship\nGod. Then at t, God comes to have a new relational property,\nbeing-worshipped-by-Quine. This is clearly an extrinsic change, since\nits occurring in God implies the existence of someone\n\u201coutside\u201d God, namely Quine. God does not (let's say) do\nanything to cause this. It's a matter of Quine's free will. Quine\ndoesn't do anything to God by worshiping him. And this change in God\nis a logical parasite of the real changes in Quine which constitute\nhis beginning to worship God. It's not possible that becoming\nworshipped by Quine be the only change in a universe. Quine's\nbeginning to worship must occur too if this one does. DDI thus lets\nGod become Quine-worshipped. It rules out only real and intrinsic\nchanges.\n\n\nThis raises a question: why do only real, intrinsic changes matter? It\nwould be silly to ascribe to friends of DDI some sort of pre-given\ngeneral antipathy against real, intrinsic change. Disliking such\nchange makes as little sense as disliking universal properties- and\nwhile nominalists campaign endlessly against these, it is not because\nthey have emotional attitudes toward them. Like nominalists, DDI's\nfriends simply followed various specific arguments, discussed below,\nwhere they seemed to lead. And they seemed to lead to a denial that\nGod can change really and intrinsically, but not to a denial of all\ndivine change tout court. The arguments which led\nphilosophers to exempt God from real, intrinsic change all had to do\nwith ways real, intrinsic change or being capable of it might make God\nless perfect. It isn't plausible that extrinsic change or openness to\nit could make something more or less perfect. I am exactly as\nimpressive a man with a dog on my left as I am without a dog on my\nleft, though the dog might improve the scene including me. And I am no\nwhit less impressive for being open to having a dog move nearby.\n",
