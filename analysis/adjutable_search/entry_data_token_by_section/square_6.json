    "main_text": "Origin of the Square of Opposition || The Rewording of the O Form\n2.3 The Rewording of the O Form\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s work was made available to the Latin west principally via\nBoethius\u2019s translations and commentaries, written a bit after 500\nCE. In his translation of De interpretatione, Boethius\npreserves Aristotle\u2019s wording of the O form as \u201cNot\nevery man is white.\u201d But when Boethius comments on this text he\nillustrates Aristotle\u2019s doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he\nuses the wording \u2018Some man is not\n just\u2019.[7]\n So this must have seemed\nto him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in\nEnglish, but he wasn\u2019t bothered by it.\n\n\nEarly in the twelfth century Abelard objected to Boethius\u2019s\nwording of the O\n form,[8]\n but Abelard\u2019s writing was not widely influential, and except for him\nand some of his followers people regularly used \u2018Some S\nis not P\u2019 for the O form in the\ndiagram that represents the square. Did they allow the\nO form to be vacuously true? Perhaps we can get some\nclues to how medieval writers interpreted these forms by looking at\nother doctrines they endorsed.  These are the theory of the syllogism\nand the doctrines of contraposition and obversion.\n",
