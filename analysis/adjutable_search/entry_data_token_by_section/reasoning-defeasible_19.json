    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Relations of Logical Consequence\n5.1 Relations of Logical Consequence\n\nA consequence relation is a mathematical relation that models what\nfollows logically from what. Consequence relations can be defined in a\nvariety of ways, such as Hilbert, Tarski, and Scott relations. A\nHilbert consequence relation is a relation between pairs of formulas,\na Tarski relation is a relation between sets of formulas (possibly\ninfinite) and individual formulas, and a Scott relation is a relation\nbetween two sets of formulas. In the case of Hilbert and Tarski\nrelations, \\(A \\vDash B\\) or \\(\\Gamma \\vDash B\\) mean\nthat the formula \\(B\\) follows from formula \\(A\\) or from\nset of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\). In the case of Scott consequence relations,\n\\(\\Gamma \\vDash \\Delta\\) means that the joint truth of all the members\nof \\(\\Gamma\\) implies (in some sense) the truth of at least one member of\n\\(\\Delta\\). To this point, studies of nonmonotonic logic have defined\nnonmonotonic consequence relations in the style of Hilbert or Tarski,\nrather than Scott.\n\nA (Tarski) consequence relation is monotonic just in case it\nsatisfies the following condition, for all formulas \\(p\\) and all\nsets \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\):\n\nMonotonicity:\nIf \\(\\Gamma \\vDash p\\), then \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta \\vDash p\\).\n\nAny consequence relation that fails this condition is\nnonmonotonic. A relation of defeasible consequence clearly\nmust be nonmonotonic, since a defeasible inference can be defeated by\nadding additional information that constitutes a rebutting or\nundercutting defeater.\n",
