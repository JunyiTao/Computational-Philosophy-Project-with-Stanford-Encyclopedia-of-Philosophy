Genetic testing carried out at the\npopulation level for any of these purposes is referred to as genetic\nscreening. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed on individuals\nalready experiencing signs and symptoms of disease as part of their\nclinical care. Newborn screening programs to diagnose conditions such\nas PKU and hemoglobinopathies based on blood components and\ncirculating metabolites (thus providing indirect genetic tests) have\nbeen carried out for many decades. Predictive genetic testing is\nperformed on individuals who are at risk for inheriting a familial\ncondition, such as cystic fibrosis or Huntingdon\u2019s disease, but\ndo not yet show any signs or symptoms. Reproductive genetic testing is\ncarried out through carrier screening, prenatal testing of the fetus\nin utero, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos\ncreated by in vitro fertilization (IVF). In carrier screening,\nprospective parents find out whether they are at risk for passing on\ndisease-related genes to their offspring. Prenatal genetic testing of\nfetuses in utero is conducted using blood tests early in a\nwoman\u2019s pregnancy, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at\n10\u201312 weeks, and amniocentesis at 15\u201318 weeks. Testing is\nincreasingly offered to all women who are pregnant, not just those for\nwhom risk is elevated because of age or family history; based on the\nresults, women can elect to continue the pregnancy or abort the fetus.\nIn PGD, a single cell is removed from the 8-cell embryo for testing;\nbased on the results, a decision is made about which embryo(s) to\nimplant in the woman\u2019s uterus.\n\nThere are significant ethical issues associated with genetic testing.\nThese issues are informed by empirical studies of the psychosocial\neffects of testing (Wade 2019). Increased knowledge that comes from\npredictive genetic testing is not an unmitigated good: denial may be a\ncoping mechanism; individuals may feel guilty for passing on harmful\nmutations to their offspring or stigmatized as having the potential to\ndo so; survivor guilt may arise in those who find out they are not at\nrisk for a disease such as Huntingdon\u2019s after all, or they may\nbecome at a loss about how to live their lives differently; those who\nfind out they are destined to develop Huntingdon\u2019s or\nearly-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease may become depressed or even\nsuicidal; paternity may not be what it is assumed to be; decisions\nabout disclosing results have implications for family members. During\ndebates about the HGP, many authors appealed to the history of\neugenics to warn about the dangers of reproductive genetic testing and\nurge caution as we move forward\u2014so much so that historian Diane\nPaul (1994) characterized eugenics as the\n\u201c\u2018approved\u2019 project anxiety\u201d (p. 143). Paul\nnoted that attempts to draw lessons from the history of eugenics are\nconfounded by disagreements about how to define\n\u201ceugenics\u201d\u2014whether to characterize eugenics\naccording to a program\u2019s intentions or effects, its use of\ncoercive rather than voluntary means, or its appeals to social and\npolitical aims that extend beyond the immediate concerns of individual\nfamilies. The label \u201cliberal eugenics\u201d has become\nincreasingly accepted for characterizing offspring selection based on\nparental choice. Reproductive rights are no longer just about the\nright not to have a child (to use contraception, to have an abortion)\nor the right to bear a child (to refuse population control measures).\nReproductive rights have come to encompass the right to access\ntechnological assistance to procreate and to have a certain kind of\nchild (Callahan 1998).\n\nConcerns about genetic discrimination resulting from genetic testing\nwere frequently expressed at the outset of the HGP. Concerns focused\nmostly on insurance companies and employers, but possibilities for\ngenetic discrimination occurring in other institutional settings were\nraised as well (Nelkin 1992; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989). A number of\ngeneral arguments have been made against institutional forms of\ngenetic discrimination: we don\u2019t choose our genes and ought not\nbe punished for what is outside our control (Gostin 1991); the social\ncosts of creating a \u201cbiologic\u201d or \u201cgenetic\nunderclass\u201d of people who lack health care and are unemployed or\nstuck in low-wage jobs are too great (Lee 1993; Nelkin and Tancredi\n1989); people\u2019s fears of genetic discrimination, whether\nrealistic or not, may lead them to forego genetic testing that might\nbenefit their lives and be less inclined to participate in genetic\nresearch (Kass 1997); people have the right not to know their genetic\nrisk status (Kass 1997). Genetic discrimination may also occur in less\nformal circumstances. Mate choice could increasingly proceed based on\ngenetic information, with certain people being labeled as undesirable.\nAs more and more fetuses are aborted on genetic grounds, families of\nchildren born with similar conditions, and people with disabilities\nand their advocates more broadly, worry that increased stigmatization\nwill result. In addition, group-based genetic research into diseases\nor behavioral differences risks stigmatizing people based on racial,\nethnic, and gender differences, with such risks informed by the\ntroubling history of the study of the genetics of intelligence (Tabery\n2015).\n\nIn the U.S., where unlike other industrialized countries there is no\npublicly funded system of universal health care, genetic\ndiscrimination by insurance companies and employers has been a\nparticularly serious worry; existing or prospective employees found to\nbe at genetic risk could be fired or not hired by employers to reduce\ncosts of providing health care coverage. ELSI research relating to\ngenetic privacy and the risk of genetic discrimination is credited\nwith bringing about changes in federal law with \u201cfar\nreaching\u201d effects on society (McEwen et al. 2014)\u2014in\nparticular, passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act\n(GINA) in May 2008, which prohibits U.S. health insurance companies\nand employers from discriminating based on genetic information,\ndefined to include genetic test results and family history but not\nmanifest disease. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, by\nprohibiting discrimination by health insurers based on preexisting\nconditions, which include genetic test results and manifest disease,\nfills in that gap and negates the need for GINA in the context of\nhealth insurance. As for employment, there remains a gap: employees\nwho are substantially impaired are covered by the Americans with\nDisabilities Act and employees who are asymptomatic with genetic tests\nshowing a predisposition for disease are covered by GINA, but\nemployees with manifest disease who are not substantially impaired are\ncovered by neither (Green et al. 2015). GINA does not prohibit use of\ngenetic information in underwriting for life, disability, or mortgage\ninsurance. Discrimination takes the form of refusing coverage on the\nbasis that the genetic susceptibility counts as a \u201cpreexisting\ncondition,\u201d charging high premiums for the policy, limiting\nbenefits, or excluding certain conditions. In 2020, Florida became the\nfirst state to prohibit use of genetic test results by life insurance\ncompanies.\n\nThe insurance industry argues that there is no principled reason to\ntreat genetic information any differently from other medical\ninformation used in underwriting. They point to the problem of\n\u201cadverse selection\u201d: people who know themselves to be at\nhigh risk are more likely to seek insurance than people who know\nthemselves to be at low risk, which threatens the market when insurers\nare deprived of the same information (Meyer 2004; Pokorski 1994).\nTaking an approach to legislation and policy that singles out genetic\ninformation for protection has also been criticized philosophically\nfor being based on \u201cmisconceptions [that] include the\npresumption that a clear distinction exists between genetic and\nnongenetic information, tests, and diseases and the genetic\nessentialist belief that genetic information is more definitive, has\ngreater predictive value, and is a greater threat to our privacy than\nis nongenetic medical information\u201d (Beckwith and Alper 1998, p.\n208; see also Rothstein 2005). The approach has been dubbed\n\u201cgenetic exceptionalism\u201d and is criticized for drawing\nfrom, and in turn fostering, myths of genetic determinism and genetic\nreductionism (Murray 1997, p. 61; see also O\u2019Neill 2001). Rather\nthan assuming the binarism implicated in here\u2014that genetic\ninformation is unique and targeted policies are necessary or that\ngenetic information is not unique and targeted policies are\nunnecessary\u2014\u201cgenomic contextualism\u201d has been\nrecommended as alternative approach (Garrison et al. 2019a). This\napproach recognizes that there are both similarities and differences\nbetween genomic and other types of clinically relevant information and\nthat the specific context in which the policy or practice is\nimplemented determines how best to proceed. Since completion of the\nHGP, the contexts in which genomics is practiced have changed\nsufficiently that while privacy concerns remain pressing, the debate\nhas been largely recast.\n\nAt the outset of the HGP, concerns about genetic privacy focused on\nhow to protect the public from intrusive governments, employers, and\ninsurance companies. But the explosion of DTC genomics has raised\nprivacy concerns caused by the very public in need of protection! In\nDTC genomics, Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial, and autosomal DNA ancestry\ntests are used to provide familial matches. These matches enable\nadoptees in closed adoptions and offspring of anonymous gamete donors\nto track down biological parents and other family members, raising\nobvious privacy concerns for those who gave up children for adoption\nor agreed to donate or sell eggs or sperm expecting that their\nanonymity would be protected. Additional privacy concerns arise as the\nresult of genetic genealogy\u2019s use of matches to cousins of\nvarious degrees to fill out missing branches in family trees. Genome\nscientists rely on cell lines, DNA sequence data, and clinical data\nsets that have been di-identified to protect the anonymity of\nvolunteers; however, access to genetic genealogy databases that\ncombine genetic and traditional genealogical information makes\nre-identification possible. In genetic genealogy, surname projects\nbased on the co-inheritance of surnames and Y-chromosomal haplotypes\nfurnish candidate surnames when sequence information is available;\nusing Internet searches to match surnames with year of birth and U.S.\nstate of residence, researchers were able to identify individuals who\nhad participated in the 1000 Genomes Project; by extension, they also\nidentified family members who had not participated in the project or\nconsented to share information (Gymrek et al. 2013). Based on\npopulation genetic modelling, researchers suggest that with a genetic\ngenealogy database that covers two percent of a target population, a\nthird cousin match can be obtained for 99 percent of the population.\nWith this match, family trees constructed using traditional\ngenealogical methods and additional sources of information can be used\nto identify an unknown individual for whom DNA is available: this is\nthe \u201clong range familial search\u201d approach that law\nenforcement is using in an increasing number of active as well as cold\ncases (Erlich et al. 2018).\n\nA response to the inability to guarantee anonymity for participants in\ngenomic research is to consider concerns about genetic privacy and\nprivacy more generally to be pass\u00e9e. Such concerns are\nincreasingly seen to stand in the way of scientific progress. Watson\nand Venter have promoted the idea that there is nothing to fear by\nmaking one\u2019s sequence public rather than protecting it as\nprivate. Venter\u2019s diploid genome was fully sequenced and the\nfindings published in the October 2007 issue of PLoS Biology (Levy et\nal. 2007); this was followed by the publication of Watson\u2019s\n\u201ccomplete\u201d genome in the 17 April 2008 issue of Nature\n(Wheeler et al. 2008). Relevant to the privacy question, Watson did\nnot bare all: at Watson\u2019s request, the APOE gene which is linked\nto Alzheimer\u2019s disease was omitted from his sequence. Along\nsimilar lines, the volunteers Church recruits for the Personal Genome\nProject agree to release their genomes and health and physical\ninformation publicly, a model of \u201copen consent\u201d replacing\ngenetic privacy (Lunshof et al. 2008). Says Church: \u201cIdeally,\neverybody on the planet would share their medical and genomic\ninformation\u201d (in Dizikes 2007). Large-scale biobanking\ninitiatives such as the All of Us Research Program,\noriginally called the Precision Medicine Initiative or PMI, appeal to\ncollective altruism. The Internet has radically changed people\u2019s\nexpectations of privacy, the boundary between their personal and\npublic lives, and their expectations of accessing information, and\nthese changes are welcomed by genome scientists. To ensure \u201cthe\nfree flow of research data,\u201d the 2011 National Research Council\nreport calls for the \u201c[g]radual elimination of institutional,\ncultural, and regulatory barriers to widespread sharing of the\nmolecular profiles and health histories of individuals, while still\nprotecting patients\u2019 rights\u201d (p. 60).\n\nWith this free flow of research data, across institutions and\nglobally, with varying degrees of oversight, people\u2019s ability to\nconsent to use of their biospecimens and data for some but not other\npurposes becomes impossible (Zarate et al. 2016). Privacy concerns are\namplified insofar as genomics is a science driven by big data. The\npromise of personalized and precision medicine is premised, for some,\non amassing all obtainable data on individuals, whether mined from\nelectronic health records, government databases, DTC genomics,\ngenealogy sites, mobile devices, social media, credit card\ntransactions, fitbits, etc. Data-driven biology forgoes hypotheses for\nalgorithms, but these algorithms are not innocuous. Hallam Stevens\n(2021) describes \u201can emerging medical-industrial complex\u201d\nthat presents \u201csubstantial challenges for privacy, data\nownership, and algorithmic bias,\u201d which, if not addressed, will\nlead to a genomic science that operates in the interests of\n\u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d and the corporate tech giants\n(pp. 565\u2013566). Governments, especially authoritarian ones, are\nbuilding databases that supplement DNA with biometics and social media\nposts to carry out genomic surveillance that often targets minorities\n(Moreau 2019).\n\nOf course, significant social privilege attaches to some\npeople\u2019s ability not to worry that genetic testing offered as an\nemployee benefit (Singer 2018) or their virtual cloud of billions of\ndata points will cause them harm. Or that they will regret spitting\ninto a tube and sending it off to 23andMe. As Anna Jabloner (2019)\nargues, \u201cmolecular identification technologies \u2026 tell a\ntale of two molecular Californias: one is a tale of an unchanged\nbiological determinism that continues to mark some bodies as risky and\ncriminal, the other tale is of individual empowerment through the\nconsumption of molecular knowledge\u201d (p. 15). Black and Latino\nmen are overrepresented in CAL-DNA, which is one of the largest\ncriminological DNA databases in the world, while 23andMe\u2019s even\nlarger database contains the DNA of mostly wealthy white Americans.\nSimilarly, Reardon (2017) comments on the tension between the\ndemocratizing impulse of the open-data model of Church\u2019s\nPersonal Genome Project and the overwhelming Whiteness, affluence, and\nmaleness of the tech-savvy volunteers who have contributed their\ngenomes\n\nIndigenous groups resist this open consent model that appeals to\ncollective altruism and seek to maintain control over biospecimens\ncontributed and data generated. As participants in scientific studies,\nthey have experienced lack of support for their interests and\npriorities, failure to share benefits of research, disrespect for\ncultural and spiritual beliefs, theft of traditional knowledge,\nconduct of unapproved secondary research, and opportunistic\ncommercialization (Garrison et al. 2019b). Genetics and genomics bring\nspecific concerns, as \u201cgenomic data are commonly seen by Indigenous\ncommunities as more sensitive than other types of health data,\nparticularly with regard to genealogy and ancestry research that can\ninfluence traditionally held beliefs, cultural histories and identity\nclaims affecting rights to land and other resources \u201d (Hudson et al.\n2020, p. 378). Given distrust of funding agencies, universities, and\nresearchers arising from these experiences and concerns, Indigenous\nunderrepresentation in biobanks, DNA sequence databases, and clinical\ndatasets is not surprising. Genome scientists desire access to\nbiospecimens and data of Indigenous peoples for a range of purposes:\ngeographical isolation of populations over tens of thousands of years\ncan yield genetic variants of physiological and clinical interest\nassociated with adaptive responses to environments; comparative\ngenomics and ancient DNA studies contribute to knowledge of human\nevolutionary history; and efforts to identify genetic contributions to\ncomplex traits using GWAS and admixture mapping depend on access to\npopulations that incorporate the genetic diversity of the species. Any\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of disease that arises\nthrough precision medicine will be weighted towards populations most\nstudied. Indigenous peoples make up only 0.022% of participants in\nGWAS conducted worldwide (Mills and Rahal 2019).\n\nIn recognition of the overrepresentation of people of European descent\nin biobanks, DNA sequence databases, and clinical datasets, the\nNIH\u2019s All of Us initiative seeks to include at least 50\npercent underrepresented minorities, motivated by the goal that\nprecision medicine benefit everyone. Keolu Fox (2020) points out that\nNIH plans to include Indigenous communities in the All of Us\ninitiative fail to appreciate that the open-source data approach used\nfor previous government-funded, large-scale human genome sequencing\nefforts such as the International HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes\nProject facilitates the commodification of data by pharmaceutical and\nancestry-testing companies. Nanibaa\u2019 A. Garrison et al. (2019b)\nsuggest that development of alternative models for genetic and genomic\nresearch involving Indigenous peoples begin by recognizing Indigenous\nsovereignty, which is \u201cthe inherent right and capacity of Indigenous\npeoples to develop culturally, socially, and economically along lines\nconsistent with their respective histories and values\u201d (pp.\n496\u2013497). There should be tangible benefits for Indigenous communities\n(e.g., support for health promotion, meaningful results), with\nequitable sharing of profits should commercialization occur (Hudson et\nal. 2020). Community engagement is crucial; this may extend to\ncommunity-based participatory research that views Indigenous\ncommunities as partners in research, not merely subjects of research.\nIndividual consent is insufficient and should be preceded by\ncollective consent, and consent needs to be an ongoing process for any\nsubsequent research contemplated (Garrison et al. 2019b; Tsosie et al.\n2019). Indigenous control over the use and disposal of DNA samples is\nneeded: on the \u201cDNA on loan\u201d approach developed in Canada\n(Arbour and Cook 2006), the participant or community retains ownership\nof biological materials and entrusts these to researchers or research\ninstitutions as stewards. As for data gleaned from biological\nmaterials, the model of open consent is counter to the concept of\nIndigenous data sovereignty, which is \u201cthe inherent and\ninalienable rights and interests of indigenous peoples relating to the\ncollection, ownership and application of data about their people,\nlifeways and territories\u201d (Kukutai and Taylor 2016, p. 2).\n",
