Uncertainty, Risk and Sequential Equilibria\n\nThe games we\u2019ve modeled to this point have all involved players\nchoosing from amongst pure strategies, in which each seeks a\nsingle optimal course of action at each node that constitutes a best\nreply to the actions of others. Often, however, a player\u2019s\nutility is optimized through use of a mixed strategy, in\nwhich she flips a weighted coin amongst several possible actions. (We\nwill see later that there is an alternative interpretation of mixing,\nnot involving randomization at a particular information set; but we\nwill start here from the coin-flipping interpretation and then build\non it in\n Section 3.1.)\n Mixing is called for whenever no pure strategy maximizes the\nplayer\u2019s utility against all opponent strategies. Our\nriver-crossing game from\n Section 1\n exemplifies this. As we saw, the puzzle in that game consists in the\nfact that if the fugitive\u2019s reasoning selects a particular\nbridge as optimal, his pursuer must be assumed to be able to duplicate\nthat reasoning. The fugitive can escape only if his pursuer cannot\nreliably predict which bridge he\u2019ll use. Symmetry of logical\nreasoning power on the part of the two players ensures that the\nfugitive can surprise the pursuer only if it is possible for him to\nsurprise himself.\n\nSuppose that we ignore rocks and cobras for a moment, and imagine that\nthe bridges are equally safe. Suppose also that the fugitive has no\nspecial knowledge about his pursuer that might lead him to venture a\nspecially conjectured probability distribution over the\npursuer\u2019s available strategies. In this case, the\nfugitive\u2019s best course is to roll a three-sided die, in which\neach side represents a different bridge (or, more conventionally, a\nsix-sided die in which each bridge is represented by two sides). He\nmust then pre-commit himself to using whichever bridge is selected by\nthis randomizing device. This fixes the odds of his survival\nregardless of what the pursuer does; but since the pursuer has no\nreason to prefer any available pure or mixed strategy, and since in\nany case we are presuming her epistemic situation to be symmetrical to\nthat of the fugitive, we may suppose that she will roll a three-sided\ndie of her own. The fugitive now has a 2/3 probability of escaping and\nthe pursuer a 1/3 probability of catching him. Neither the fugitive\nnor the pursuer can improve their chances given the other\u2019s\nrandomizing mix, so the two randomizing strategies are in Nash\nequilibrium. Note that if one player is randomizing then the\nother does equally well on any mix of probabilities over\nbridges, so there are infinitely many combinations of best replies.\nHowever, each player should worry that anything other than a random\nstrategy might be coordinated with some factor the other player can\ndetect and exploit. Since any non-random strategy is exploitable by\nanother non-random strategy, in a zero-sum game such as our example,\nonly the vector of randomized strategies is a NE.\n\nNow let us re-introduce the parametric factors, that is, the falling\nrocks at bridge #2 and the cobras at bridge #3. Again, suppose that\nthe fugitive is sure to get safely across bridge #1, has a 90% chance\nof crossing bridge #2, and an 80% chance of crossing bridge #3. We can\nsolve this new game if we make certain assumptions about the two\nplayers\u2019 utility functions. Suppose that Player 1, the fugitive,\ncares only about living or dying (preferring life to death) while the\npursuer simply wishes to be able to report that the fugitive is dead,\npreferring this to having to report that he got away. (In other words,\nneither player cares about how the fugitive lives or dies.)\nSuppose also for now that neither player gets any utility or\ndisutility from taking more or less risk. In this case, the fugitive\nsimply takes his original randomizing formula and weights it according\nto the different levels of parametric danger at the three bridges.\nEach bridge should be thought of as a lottery over the\nfugitive\u2019s possible outcomes, in which each lottery has a\ndifferent expected payoff in terms of the items in his\nutility function.\n\nConsider matters from the pursuer\u2019s point of view. She will be\nusing her NE strategy when she chooses the mix of probabilities over\nthe three bridges that makes the fugitive indifferent among his\npossible pure strategies. The bridge with rocks is 1.1 times more\ndangerous for him than the safe bridge. Therefore, he will be\nindifferent between the two when the pursuer is 1.1 times more likely\nto be waiting at the safe bridge than the rocky bridge. The cobra\nbridge is 1.2 times more dangerous for the fugitive than the safe\nbridge. Therefore, he will be indifferent between these two bridges\nwhen the pursuer\u2019s probability of waiting at the safe bridge is\n1.2 times higher than the probability that she is at the cobra bridge.\nSuppose we use \\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\) and \\(s_3\\) to represent the\nfugitive\u2019s parametric survival rates at each bridge. Then the\npursuer minimizes the net survival rate across any pair of bridges by\nadjusting the probabilities p1 and p2 that she will wait at them so\nthat \n\\[\ns_1 (1 - p_1) = s_2 (1 - p_2)\n\\]\n\n\nSince \\(p_1 + p_2 = 1\\), we can rewrite this as \n\\[\ns_1 \\times p_2 = s_2 \\times p_1\n\\]\n\n\nso \n\\[\n\\frac{p_1}{s_1} = \\frac{p_2}{s_2}.\n\\]\n\n\nThus the pursuer finds her NE strategy by solving the following\nsimultaneous equations: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n1(1-p_1) &= 0.9(1-p_2) \\\\\n&=0.8(1-p_3)\n\\end{align}\\]\n \n\\[\np_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1\n\\]\n\n\nThen \n\\[\\begin{align}\np_1 &= \\frac{49}{121} \\\\\np_2 &= \\frac{41}{121} \\\\\np_3 &= \\frac{31}{121}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nNow let \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\) represent the probabilities with\nwhich the fugitive chooses each respective bridge. Then the fugitive\nfinds his NE strategy by solving \n\\[\\begin{align}\ns_1 \\times f_1 &= s_2 \\times f_2 \\\\\n               &= s_3 \\times f_3\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nso \n\\[\\begin{align}\n1 \\times f_1 &= 0.9 \\times f_2 \\\\\n             &= 0.8 \\times f_3\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nsimultaneously with \n\\[\nf_1 + f_2 + f_3 = 1\n\\]\n\n\nThen \n\\[\\begin{align}\nf_1 &= \\frac{36}{121} \\\\\nf_2 &= \\frac{40}{121} \\\\\nf_3 &= \\frac{45}{121}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThese two sets of NE probabilities tell each player how to weight his\nor her die before throwing it. Note the\u2014perhaps\nsurprising\u2014result that the fugitive, though by hypothesis he\ngets no enjoyment from gambling, uses riskier bridges with  higher\n probability. This is the only way of making the pursuer\nindifferent over which bridge she stakes out, which in turn is what\nmaximizes the fugitive\u2019s probability of survival.\n\nWe were able to solve this game straightforwardly because we set the\nutility functions in such a way as to make it zero-sum, or\nstrictly competitive. That is, every gain in expected utility\nby one player represents a precisely symmetrical loss by the other.\nHowever, this condition may often not hold. Suppose now that the\nutility functions are more complicated. The pursuer most prefers an\noutcome in which she shoots the fugitive and so claims credit for his\napprehension to one in which he dies of rockfall or snakebite; and she\nprefers this second outcome to his escape. The fugitive prefers a\nquick death by gunshot to the pain of being crushed or the terror of\nan encounter with a cobra. Most of all, of course, he prefers to\nescape. Suppose, plausibly, that the fugitive cares more\nstrongly about surviving than he does about getting killed\none way rather than another. We cannot solve this game, as before,\nsimply on the basis of knowing the players\u2019 ordinal utility\nfunctions, since the intensities of their respective\npreferences will now be relevant to their strategies.\n\nPrior to the work of\n von Neumann & Morgenstern (1947),\n situations of this sort were inherently baffling to analysts. This is\nbecause utility does not denote a hidden psychological variable such\nas pleasure. As we discussed in\n Section 2.1,\n utility is merely a measure of relative behavioural dispositions\ngiven certain consistency assumptions about relations between\npreferences and choices. It therefore makes no sense to imagine\ncomparing our players\u2019 cardinal\u2014that is,\nintensity-sensitive\u2014preferences with one another\u2019s, since\nthere is no independent, interpersonally constant yardstick we could\nuse. How, then, can we model games in which cardinal information is\nrelevant? After all, modeling games requires that all players\u2019\nutilities be taken simultaneously into account, as we\u2019ve\nseen.\n\nA crucial aspect of\n von Neumann & Morgenstern\u2019s (1947)\n work was the solution to this problem. Here, we will provide a brief\noutline of their ingenious technique for building cardinal utility\nfunctions out of ordinal ones. It is emphasized that what follows is\nmerely an outline, so as to make cardinal utility\nnon-mysterious to you as a student who is interested in knowing about\nthe philosophical foundations of game theory, and about the range of\nproblems to which it can be applied. Providing a manual you could\nfollow in building your own cardinal utility functions would\nrequire many pages. Such manuals are available in many textbooks.\n\nSuppose that we now assign the following ordinal utility function to\nthe river-crossing fugitive: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{Escape} &\\gg 4 \\\\\n\\text{Death by shooting} &\\gg 3 \\\\\n\\text{Death by rockfall} &\\gg 2 \\\\\n\\text{Death by snakebite} &\\gg 1\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWe are supposing that his preference for escape over any form\nof death is stronger than his preferences between causes of death.\nThis should be reflected in his choice behaviour in the following way.\nIn a situation such as the river-crossing game, he should be willing\nto run greater risks to increase the relative probability of escape\nover shooting than he is to increase the relative probability of\nshooting over snakebite. This bit of logic is the crucial insight\nbehind\n von Neumann & Morgenstern\u2019s (1947)\n solution to the cardinalization problem. \n\nSuppose we asked the fugitive to pick, from the available set of\noutcomes, a best one and a worst one.\n\u2018Best\u2019 and \u2018worst\u2019 are defined in terms of\nexpected payoffs as illustrated in our current zero-sum game example:\na player maximizes his expected payoff if, when choosing among\nlotteries that contain only two possible prizes, he always chooses so\nas to maximize the probability of the best outcome\u2014call this\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\)\u2014and to minimize the probability of the worst\noutcome\u2014call this \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). Now imagine expanding the set\nof possible prizes so that it includes prizes that the agent values as\nintermediate between \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). We find, for a\nset of outcomes containing such prizes, a lottery over them such that\nour agent is indifferent between that lottery and a lottery including\nonly \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). In our example, this is a\nlottery that includes being shot and being crushed by rocks. Call this\nlottery \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) . We define a utility function \\(q =\nu(\\mathbf{T})\\) from outcomes to the real (as opposed to ordinal)\nnumber line such that if \\(q\\) is the expected prize in\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\), the agent is indifferent between winning\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and winning a lottery \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) in which\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\) occurs with probability \\(u(\\mathbf{T})\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) occurs with probability \\(1-u(\\mathbf{T})\\). Assuming\nthat the agent\u2019s behaviour respects the principle of\nreduction of compound lotteries (ROCL)\u2014that is, he does\nnot gain or lose utility from considering more complex lotteries\nrather than simple ones\u2014the set of mappings of outcomes in\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) to \\(u\\mathbf{T}^*\\) gives a von Neumann-Morgenstern\nutility function (vNMuf) with cardinal structure over all outcomes in\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\). \n\nWhat exactly have we done here? We\u2019ve given our agent choices\nover lotteries, instead of directly over resolved outcomes, and\nobserved how much extra risk of death he\u2019s willing to run to\nchange the odds of getting one form of death relative to an\nalternative form of death. Note that this cardinalizes the\nagent\u2019s preference structure only relative to agent-specific\nreference points \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}\\); the procedure\nreveals nothing about comparative extra-ordinal preferences\nbetween agents, which helps to make clear that constructing a\nvNMuf does not introduce a potentially objective psychological\nelement. Furthermore, two agents in one game, or one agent under\ndifferent sorts of circumstances, may display varying attitudes to\nrisk. Perhaps in the river-crossing game the pursuer, whose life is\nnot at stake, will enjoy gambling with her glory while our fugitive is\ncautious. In analyzing the river-crossing game, however, we\ndon\u2019t have to be able to compare the pursuer\u2019s\ncardinal utilities with the fugitive\u2019s. Both agents, after all,\ncan find their NE strategies if they can estimate the probabilities\neach will assign to the actions of the other. This means that each\nmust know both vNMufs; but neither need try to comparatively value the\noutcomes over which they\u2019re choosing.\n\nWe can now fill in the rest of the matrix for the bridge-crossing game\nthat we started to draw in Section 2. If both players are risk-neutral\nand their revealed preferences respect ROCL, then we have enough\ninformation to be able to assign expected utilities, expressed by\nmultiplying the original payoffs by the relevant probabilities, as\noutcomes in the matrix. Suppose that the hunter waits at the cobra\nbridge with probability \\(x\\) and at the rocky bridge with probability\n\\(y\\). Since her probabilities across the three bridges must sum to 1,\nthis implies that she must wait at the safe bridge with probability\n\\(1 - (x + y)\\). Then, continuing to assign the fugitive a payoff of 0\nif he dies and 1 if he escapes, and the hunter the reverse payoffs,\nour complete matrix is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nHunter\n\nSafe Bridge\nRocky Bridge\nCobra Bridge\n\nFugitive\nSafe Bridge\n0,1\n1,0\n1,0\n\nRocky Bridge\n0.9,0.1\n0,1\n0.9,0.1\n\nCobra Bridge\n0.8,0.2\n0.8,0.2\n0,1\n\n\nFigure 12\n\n\nWe can now read the following facts about the game directly from the\nmatrix. No pair of pure strategies is a pair of best replies to the\nother. Therefore, the game\u2019s only NE require at least one player\nto use a mixed strategy.\n",
