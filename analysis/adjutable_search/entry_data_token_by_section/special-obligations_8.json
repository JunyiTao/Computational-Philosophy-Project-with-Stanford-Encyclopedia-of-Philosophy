    "main_text": "The Range and Types of Special Obligations || Professional Obligations\n6.3 Professional Obligations\n\nMany of us assume obligations when we assume professional roles. As a\nphilosophy professor at a state university, I have obligations to my\ncolleagues, my students, and the taxpayers of the state of Iowa.\nPhysicians and therapists have obligations to their patients, police\nofficers to the citizens of their jurisdictions, ministers and priests\nto their flocks, etc. Are these obligations mere obligations of role\nwithout moral implications, or are they genuinely moral special\nobligations? These questions are particularly pressing, given how\noften our professions can force us to make morally charged decisions:\nany study of history shows how dangerous it can be for people to bow\nunreflectively to what they take to be the duties of their roles. As\nJoel Feinberg points out, conflicts between perceived special\nobligations of position and more general duties created great tension\nand conflict for American abolitionist judges prior to the Civil War.\nIn an era of increased concern about professional ethics, we need to\nhave some account of which professional roles, if any, generate\ngenuinely moral special duties. (See Almond.)\n 6.4 Compatriots \n\nOne type of voluntarist account of special obligations has become\nfamiliar from the political context: Locke\u2019s consent theory of\npolitical obligations. (See section 4.) Many people seem to understand\nthemselves as having special obligations to their fellow citizens, and\nvarious accounts of these obligations have been offered. (See the\nentries on\n political obligation,\n and\n cosmopolitanism.)\n\nIn recent years, more and more attention is being paid to issues of\nglobal justice, and, inevitably, discussion has turned to the conflict\n(or, at least, the apparent conflict) between our duties to our\ncompatriots and our duties to others around the globe, in particular,\nthe global poor. In this literature, the debate is described as being\nbetween those who accept associationism and those who accept\ncosmopolitanism. The former accept that we have associative duties\n\u2013 \u201cduties we owe to people with whom we are associated in\nsome way,\u201d including compatriots (Seglow 54) \u2013 while the\nlatter \u201cregard people\u2019s local allegiance as a parochial\nobstacle that stands in the way of achieving global distributive\njustice\u201d (55). Seglow aims to defend the former, associationist\nposition, while others, such as Caney, defend the latter (even while\nattempting to give at least an instrumental role to associations). Yet\nothers (Moellendorf) try to extend the notion of association in such a\nway that the global economy, for example, grounds associational duties\n(see Lenard and Moore for discussion of such views).\n\nThis debate is clearly closely related to Scheffler\u2019s discussion\nof the distributive objection discussed above. How can we justify\npartiality to our perhaps already comparatively well-off compatriots\nwhen many people around the globe do not have the basic necessities?\n\n\nThese are only some of the types of special obligations that have been\ndefended by philosophers. Here is just a sample of the range of\nspecial obligations defended in the philosophical literature: members\nof society to help families and children of those incarcerated\n(Bulow), beneficiaries of injustice to aid those who are victims of\ninjustice (Butt), pharmaceutical companies to provide lifesaving\nmedication to those in need (Huebner), and those who become aware of\nanother\u2019s need via a waver of privacy to aid that other\n(Richardson). Philosophers who defend special obligations of any type\nneed to carefully consider whether that defense can also be used with\nrespect to other special obligations and also whether such extension\nis plausible. If not, the special obligation originally defended\nshould be reconsidered. After all, if special relationships generate\nor ground special obligations, we need to be careful not to render any\nand every relationship \u2019special,\u2019 or that term will lose\nits significance. For any proposed special obligation, we need to\nconsider whether it is more plausibly understood as derivative from an\nagent-neutral reason or a natural duty and so not really special in a\nfundamental sense.\n",
