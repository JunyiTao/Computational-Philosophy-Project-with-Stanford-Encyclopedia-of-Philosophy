    "main_text": "Varieties of Auditory Perception || Crossmodal Influences\n4.3 Crossmodal Influences);\n duplex perception\u2014a particular stimulus sometimes\ncontributes simultaneously both to the experience of an ordinary sound\nand to that of a speech sound (Rand 1974); and the top-down\ninfluence of linguistic knowledge upon the experience of speech. A\nreasonable challenge is that each of these\ncharacteristics\u2014multimodality, duplex perception, and top-down\ninfluence\u2014also is displayed in general audition. \n\nSee the supplement on\n Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations.\n \n4.3 Crossmodal Influences\n4.3.1 Crossmodal Illusions\n\nAuditory perception of speech is influenced by cues from vision and\ntouch (see Gick et al. 2008). The McGurk effect in speech perception\nleads to an illusory auditory experience caused by a visual stimulus\n(McGurk and Macdonald 1976). Do such multimodal effects occur in\nordinary audition? Visual and tactile cues commonly do shape auditory\nexperience. The ventriloquist illusion is an illusory auditory\nexperience of location that is produced by an apparent visible sound\nsource (see, e.g., Bertelson 1999). Audition even impacts experience\nin other modalities. The sound-induced flash effect involves a visual\nillusion as of seeing two consecutive flashes that is produced when a\nsingle flash is accompanied by two consecutive beeps (Shams et al.\n2000, 2002). Such crossmodal illusions demonstrate that auditory\nexperience is impacted by other modalities and that audition\ninfluences other modalities. In general, experiences associated with\none perceptual modality are influenced by stimulation to other sensory\nsystems.\n4.3.2 Causal or Constitutive?\n\nAn important question is whether the impact is merely causal, or\nwhether perception in one modality is somehow constitutively tied to\nother modalities. If, for instance, vision merely causally impacts\nyour auditory experience of a given sound, then processes associated\nwith audition might be proprietary and characterizable in terms that\ndo not appeal to other modalities. Relying on information from vision\nor touch could simply improve the existing capacity to perceive space,\ntime, or spoken language auditorily. On the other hand, coordination\nbetween audition and other senses could enable a new perceptual\ncapacity. In that case, audition might rely constitutively on another\nsense.\n\nA first step in resolving this question is recognizing that crossmodal\nillusions are not mere accidents. Instead, they are intelligible as\nthe results of adaptive perceptual strategies. In ordinary\ncircumstances, crossmodal processes serve to reduce or resolve\napparent conflicts in information drawn from several senses. In doing\nso, they tend to make perception more reliable overall. Thus,\ncrossmodal illusions differ from synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is\njust a kind of accident. It results from mere quirks of processing,\nand it always involves illusion (or else is accidentally veridical).\nCrossmodal recalibrations, in contrast, are best understood as\nattempts \u201cto maintain a perceptual experience consonant with a\nunitary event\u201d (Welch and Warren 1980, 638).\n\nIn the first place, the principled reconciliation of information drawn\nfrom different sensory sources suggests that audition is governed by\nextra-auditory perceptual constraints. Moreover, since conflict\nrequires a common subject matter, such constraints must concern common\nsources of stimulation to multiple senses. If so, audition and vision\nshare a perceptual concern for a common subject matter. And that\nconcern is reflected in the organization of auditory experience. But\nthis by itself does not establish constitutive dependence of audition\non another sense.\n\nHowever, the perceptual concern for a common subject matter could be\nreflected as such in certain forms of auditory experience. For\ninstance, the commonality may be experientially evident in jointly\nperceiving shared spatio-temporal features, or in the perceptual\nexperience of audio-visual intermodal feature binding. If so, some\nforms of auditory perceptual experience may share with vision a common\nmultimodal or amodal content or character (see O\u2019Callaghan\n2008b, Clark 2011). More to the point, if coordination with another\nsense enables a new auditory capacity, then vision or touch could have\na constitutive rather than merely causal impact upon corresponding\nauditory experiences.\n4.3.3 Multimodality in Perception\n\nWhat hangs on this? First, it bears on questions about\naudition\u2019s content. If we cannot exhaustively characterize\nauditory experience in terms that are modality-specific or distinctive\nto audition, then we might hear as of things we can see or\nexperience with other senses. This is related to one puzzling question\nabout hearing sound sources: How could you hear as of something you\ncould see? Rather than just a claim about audition\u2019s content\nthat requires further explanation, we now have a story about why\nthings like sound sources figure in the content of auditory\nexperience. Second, all of this may bear on how to delineate what\ncounts as auditory perception, as opposed to visual or even amodal\nperception. If hearing is systematically impacted by visual processes,\nand if it shares content and phenomenology with other sense\nexperiences, what are the boundaries of auditory perception?\nMultimodal perception may bear on the question of whether there are\nclear and significant distinctions among the sense modalities (cf.\nNudds 2003). Finally, multimodal perceptual experiences, illusions,\nand explanatory strategies may illuminate the phenomenological\nunity of experiences in different modalities, or the sense in\nwhich, for instance, an auditory experience and a visual experience of\nsome happening comprise a single encompassing experience (see the\nentry on\n the unity of consciousness).\n \n\nWe can ask questions about the relationships among modalities in\ndifferent areas of explanatory concern. Worthwhile areas for attention\ninclude the objects, contents, and phenomenology of perception, as\nwell as perceptual processes and their architecture. Crossmodal and\nmultimodal considerations might shed doubt on whether vision-based\ntheorizing alone can deliver a complete understanding of perception\nand its contents. This approach constitutes an important\nmethodological advance in the philosophical study of perception (for\nfurther discussion, see O\u2019Callaghan 2012, 2019, Matthen 2015,\nStokes et al. 2015).\n5. Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nConsidering modalities other than vision enhances our understanding of\nperception. It is necessary to developing and vetting an adequate\ncomprehensive and general account of perception and its roles.\nAuditory perception is a rich territory for philosophical exploration\nin its own right, but it also provides a useful contrast case in which\nto evaluate claims about perception proposed in the context of vision.\nOne of the most promising directions for future work concerns the\nnature of the relationships among perceptual modalities, how these\nrelationships shape experience across modalities, and how they may\nprove essential to understanding perception itself. Philosophical work\non auditory perception thus is part of the advance beyond considering\nmodalities in isolation from each other.",
