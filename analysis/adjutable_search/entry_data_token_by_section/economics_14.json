Influential approaches to economic methodology\n\nThe past half century has witnessed the emergence of a large\nliterature devoted to economic methodology. That literature explores\nmany methodological approaches and applies its conclusions to many\nschools and branches of economics. Much of the literature has focused\non the fundamental theory of mainstream economics \u2014 the theory\nof the equilibria resulting from constrained rational individual\nchoice \u2014 but the tremendous importance of macroeconomics in\ndetermining the proper responses to the great recession beginning in\n2008, coupled with the rapidly increasing role of empirical and\nexperimental inquiries in the day-to-day work of economists have seen\nechoes in methodological inquiries (Backhouse 2010). Since 1985, there\nhas been a journal Economics and Philosophy devoted\nspecifically to philosophy of economics, and since 1994 there has also\nbeen a Journal of Economic Methodology. This section will\nsample some of the methodological approaches of the past two\ndecades.\n",
