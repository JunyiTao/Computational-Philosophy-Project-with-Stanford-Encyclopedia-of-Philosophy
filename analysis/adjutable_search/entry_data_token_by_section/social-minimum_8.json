    "main_text": "Why a social minimum? || Left-libertarianism\n2.3 Left-libertarianism\n\nHowever, not all libertarians\u2014those who endorse the principle of\nself-ownership\u2014agree with the theory of justice in acquisition\nthat we find in Nozick\u2019s work. According to some philosophers,\nsometimes referred to as left-libertarians, the principle of\nself-ownership should be combined with a more egalitarian principle of\ndivision of initially unowned external resources. Thus, if we imagine\na group of people who find themselves transported to a previously\nuninhabited planet, the left-libertarian holds that each of these\npeople has the rights of self-ownership plus a right to an\nequal, per capita share of this planet\u2019s initially unowned external\nresources (see, for example, Steiner 1994, and Vallentyne and Steiner\n2000a,b).\n\nThere is a lively debate amongst left-libertarians as to which goods\ncount as external resources for purposes of equal division, but\nvirtually all would agree that these resources must include society\u2019s\ninheritance of land. Some would argue that the pool of resources for\nequal division should also include the capital stock that one\ngeneration inherits from past generations. More recently, it has been\nsuggested that \u201cjob assets\u201d and the value of the genetic\ninformation that we carry as individuals should also be included in\nthe pool for equal division (see, respectively, Van Parijs 1992, 1995,\nand Steiner,\n 1994).[3]\n\nLeft-libertarianism seems to hold more promise of justifying something\nlike a social minimum than conventional libertarianism. To be sure, a\nleft-libertarian regime will not permit the redistribution of\nlabor incomes by the state as this violates the core\nlibertarian commitment to respect the rights of self-ownership. But\nthe parallel commitment to equal division of initially unowned\nexternal resources will ensure that every person starts life with at\nleast some external resources, or a monetary equivalent. To see how\nthis may transform the prospects of those on low incomes, it may help\nto go back for a moment to the people whom we just imagined being\ntransported to a new planet. On arrival, the people find that on the\nplanet there is a single external resource, uncultivated land, all\nunits of which are of homogeneous quality. Their own population is\ndivided into two groups, a majority who are able to work the land and\na minority that are much less able to do this (here we follow Cohen\n1995: chapter 4). Now we saw in our discussion of libertarianism above\nhow, under a Nozick-style regime, members of the minority might well\nhave no justice-based claim to assistance against the majority, and,\nin consequence, could starve. Under a left-libertarian regime,\nhowever, the government is obliged to give each person an equal share\nof the planet\u2019s land. Those unable to work well will be able to sell\nor lease their share to members of the majority group, and can thereby\nderive an income from this source. They will thus be at least somewhat\nbetter off than under the Nozick-style regime.\n\nIn practice, left-libertarians do not propose that we actually divide\nland and other resources up in this literal way. Instead, following\nthe argument of agrarian radicals such as Thomas Spence and Tom Paine,\nthey argue that the individual should receive a monetary grant\nreflecting their fair share of society\u2019s external resources, such as\nland (on Spence and Paine, see Vallentyne and Steiner 2000b). The\nlevel of this grant will depend on a host of factors, but it is\npossible that it will be equivalent\u2014or even higher\u2014in\nvalue to the bundle of resources needed to enjoy a minimally decent\nlife in the society in question. Thus, depending on the circumstances\nof the society in question, left-libertarian principles of justice\nmight support a policy that is more or less equivalent to the\nenactment of a full social minimum.\n\nNevertheless, it is clearly important to emphasize the word\n\u201cmight\u201d in the previous sentence. There is no reason why\nthe basic grant we have imagined must be of equivalent value\nto a full social minimum. Indeed, if the relevant external assets are\nabundant, so that their market price is low, then the level of the\ngrant might not come anywhere near this level. In such a situation,\nrespect for self-ownership will rule out taking labor incomes to top\nup the grant. It is possible, therefore, that some people will be left\nwith a level of resources below that necessary to lead a minimally\ndecent life (see Cohen 1995: chapter 4, especially pp. 102\u2013105).\nThus, while left-libertarianism offers stronger support for enactment\nof a social minimum than conventional libertarianism does, this\nsupport is still highly contingent, and in many situations\nleft-libertarianism will probably rule out as unjust the course of\naction needed to enact a full social minimum (taxation of labor\nincomes). Moreover, even if the resource grant is high enough to\nprovide a full social minimum, some left-libertarians would argue that\nindividuals should receive their basic grant as a capital lump-sum at\nthe start of their adult life rather than as a periodic income payment\nand/or as a freely available bundle of\n services.[4]\n This raises the possibility that some people might \u201cblow\u201d\ntheir grants early in their adult lives and might then lack ready\naccess to a social minimum.\n",
