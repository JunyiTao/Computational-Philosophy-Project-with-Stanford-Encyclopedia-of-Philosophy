    "main_text": "Understanding Constructive Empiricism || Acceptance\n1.7 Acceptance\n\nAcceptance has both an epistemic and a pragmatic component. When one\naccepts a theory, one has a belief, and also a commitment. The belief\nis that the theory is empirically adequate. The commitment is \u201ca\ncommitment to the further confrontation of new phenomena within the\nframework of that theory, a commitment to a research programme, and a\nwager that all relevant phenomena can be accounted for without giving\nup that theory\u201d (1980, 88). According to the constructive\nempiricist, this commitment is made at least in part on pragmatic\ngrounds: there is an important role for non-epistemic values in theory\nchoice (van Fraassen 2007, 340).\n\nFor the constructive empiricist, acceptance comes in degrees. This can\ninfluence how one engages in discourse in the domain of the\ntheory:\n\nIf the acceptance is at all strong, it is exhibited in the\nperson\u2019s assumption of the role of explainer, in his willingness\nto answer questions ex cathedra. (van Fraassen 1980, 12)\n\n\nVan Fraassen goes on to explain that acceptance produces contexts\nwhere one engages in discourse \u201cin a context in which language\nuse is guided by that theory.\u201d\n\nOne reason the constructive empiricist\u2019s account of acceptance\nis important is that it allows us to make sense of scientific\nanti-realists such as constructive empiricists (of the scientific\nagnostic variety) talking as if a particular theory is true. When one\nlooks at scientific discourse, this is what scientists are often\ndoing: they treat a theory as if they fully believe it, and answer\nquestions and give explanations using the resources of the theory. The\nconstructive empiricist can account for this behavior, without\nattributing full belief in the theory to the scientists, by describing\nthe scientists as merely accepting, without fully believing, the\ntheories they develop (van Fraassen 1980, 81\u201382).\n\nThe constructive empiricist can acknowledge that scientific realists\nalso recognize that there is a pragmatic dimension to theory\nacceptance. But \u201cbecause the amount of belief involved in\nacceptance is typically less according to anti-realists, they will\ntend to make more of the pragmatic aspects\u201d (van Fraassen 1980,\n13).\n",
