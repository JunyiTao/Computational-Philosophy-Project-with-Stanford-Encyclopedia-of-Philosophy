In principle, though, there are infinitely many thoughts you\nmight entertain. Consider:\n\n\nMary gave the test tube to John\u2019s daughter.\n\nMary gave the test tube to John\u2019s daughter\u2019s daughter.\n\nMary gave the test tube to John\u2019s daughter\u2019s\ndaughter\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u22ee\n\n\nThe moral usually drawn is that you have the competence to\nentertain a potential infinity of thoughts, even though your\nperformance is bounded by biological limits upon memory,\nattention, processing capacity, and so on. In a slogan: thought is\nproductive.\n\nRTT+COMP straightforwardly explains productivity. We postulate a\nfinite base of primitive Mentalese symbols, along with operations for\ncombining simple expressions into complex expressions. Iterative\napplication of the compounding operations generates an infinite array\nof mental sentences, each in principle within your cognitive\nrepertoire. By tokening a mental sentence, you entertain the thought\nexpressed by it. This explanation leverages the recursive nature of\ncompositional mechanisms to generate infinitely many expressions from\na finite base. It thereby illuminates how finite creatures such as\nourselves are able to entertain a potential infinity of thoughts.\n\nFodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue that, since RTT+COMP provides a\nsatisfying explanation for productivity, we have good reason to accept\nRTT+COMP. A potential worry about this argument is that it rests upon\nan infinitary competence never manifested within actual performance.\nOne might dismiss the supposed infinitary competence as an\nidealization that, while perhaps convenient for certain purposes, does\nnot stand in need of explanation.\n",
