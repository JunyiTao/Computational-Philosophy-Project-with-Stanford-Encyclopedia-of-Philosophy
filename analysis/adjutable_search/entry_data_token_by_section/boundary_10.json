By themselves, the remarks of section 1.2 on the\nnatural/artificial opposition are already enough to suggest a\nboundary-based reading of many contemporary debates on, say, the\nfoundations of biology. Biological taxonomies are the result of\n\u201ccircumscribing\u201d and classifying individual organisms into\ntaxa of various ranks (species, genera, families, etc.), so any\ncontroversy between realists vs. antirealists, essentialists vs.\nconventionalists, or even monists vs. pluralists may to some extent be\nseen as stemming from different ways of assessing the ontological\nstatus of the relevant taxonomic boundaries (cf. Hull 1974,\nDupr\u00e9 1993, Kitcher 2001, Ereshefsky 2001). The vicissitudes of\nthe chimera, in ancient mythology (Ebbesen 1986) as well as in\ncontemporary genetics (Bonnicksen 2009, Hyun and De Los Angeles 2019),\nare perhaps the best illustration of science\u2019s constant\nstruggling with the status of such boundaries, with all that it\nentails, on ethical and scientific grounds, in the special case of the\nboundaries that define the human species (see the entry on\n human/non-human chimeras).\n\nYet this is only one way in which boundaries are at work, and open to\nphilosophical theorizing, in the field of biology. Another, equally\nimportant way emerges in the study of the organism-environment\nrelations that are so central to the understanding of evolution.\nConsider, for instance, the partitioning of the ecological environment\neffected by what biologists call \u201cniche construction\u201d\n(Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Sultan 2015). There are niches that are\nfully enclosed within a physical retainer, such as an egg, a closed\noyster shell, or a larval chamber; niches that, like a kangaroo pouch\nor a bear\u2019s cave, are bound partly by a physical boundary and\npartly by an immaterial boundary marking (more or less vaguely) the\nopening through which the organism is free to leave; niches that are\nbounded by a physical retainer to a very low extent, as with the niche\nof the oxpecker removing ticks from the back of an African rhinoceros\n(bounded by a part of the rhinoceros\u2019s hide); and, finally,\nniches that lack a physical retainer altogether and are bordered\nentirely by boundaries of the fiat sort, as with a fish\norbiting underwater or a falcon in the sky circling above the area\nwhere its prey is to be found.\n\nIt is remarkable how closely such a variety of niche structures\nmirrors the variety of boundary structures that we find in the\ngeopolitical world (Smith and Varzi 1999, 2002). The prima\nfacie strength and protective function of any particular niche\n\u2014 what Gibson (1979) calls its \u201caffordance\ncharacter\u201d \u2014 is to a large degree determined by the sort\nof boundaries that delimit it. And just as the history of geopolitical\nboundaries is, to a great extent, a history of the\n\u201crazor\u2019s edge\u201d on which hang suspended all issues\n\u201cof life or death to nations\u201d (Curzon 1907: 7), so the\nhistory of evolution and biological survival is, in many ways, a\nhistory of the growth in complexity of \u201cthe constant interplay\nof the organism and the environment\u201d (Lewontin 1978: 215). The\nmechanisms of what has come to be called \u201cautopoiesis\u201d\n(Maturana and Varela 1972) can similarly be described in terms of a\nsystem\u2019s ability to maintain and renew itself by regulating its\ncomposition and conserving its boundaries. And once we see things from\nthis perspective, it is a short step to see the same mechanisms at\nwork also in the structuring of our relations with the social\nenvironment, from personal space (Hull 1966) to human territoriality\nat large (Sack 1986; Taylor 1988). In all these cases, the question is\nnot only what boundaries are; it is how they function and how they\nserve the things they bound (Ludu 2016; Werner 2021, 2022).\n",
