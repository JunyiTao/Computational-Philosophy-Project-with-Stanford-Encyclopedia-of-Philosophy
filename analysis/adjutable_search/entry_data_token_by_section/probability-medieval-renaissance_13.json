    "main_text": "Further aspects of medieval probability || Both-sided probability\n4.3 Both-sided probability\n\nScholastic authors often ascribed probability at the same time to a\nproposition and its negation or to a proposition and a\ncounter-proposition which was logically incompatible with it. A\nproposition could even be regarded as more probable\n(probabilior) without its negation losing probability. In\nfact, calling an opinion more probable than another regularly implied\nthat the other was also probable, because comparison and choice\nbetween probable alternatives was intended.\n\nFor some modern commentators, this impugns an understanding of\n\u201cprobable\u201d as readily affirmable or adoptable. It seems to\nbe a minimum requirement of being affirmable that a proposition\nx is judged to be more likely true than false, that is,\nhaving probability p(x) > 0.5. Since a proposition and its\nnegation cannot both have p > 0.5, they cannot both be affirmable\nat the same time. The scholastics, of course, did not operate with\nsuch numerical considerations. For them, \u201cboth-sided\nprobability\u201d (as one might call it) resulted naturally from the\nendoxic concept of probability. A proposition and its negation can\nboth be held true at the same time by different\n experts.[37]\n\nIt is not possible, of course, to assume both-sided probability based\non a proto-frequentist or semantic understanding of probability.\nContradictory sentences cannot both be most often true. Yet this\nproblem did not impugn medieval ascriptions of both-sided probability\nin academic debates or in the practice of the confessional, which\nusually explicitly or implicitly proceeded on the basis of the endoxic\nunderstanding of probability.\n\nThere are two different ways in which an evaluator can consider a\nproposition as more probable and a counter-proposition as probable at\nthe same time. First, the evaluator can believe that more and/or\nbetter experts hold x true than y, although\ny is approved by a sufficient number of experts to count as\n probable.[38]\n Second, the evaluator may consider a proposition as more probable\naccording to her own weighing up of the reasons, while the\ncounter-proposition is considered probable because it is the opinion\nof many or weighty\n experts.[39]\n Both options show that there is no obvious logical problem with the\nassumption that two incompatible propositions can both be regarded as\nrationally\n affirmable.[40]\n This does not, however, invalidate the claim that only one of the\npropositions can be rationally affirmed at a given time and by a given\nperson from her own standpoint. The person in question can, it seems,\nonly rationally affirm what she regards as more probable than its\nnegation. Consequently, regarding a rival opinion as probable means\nconsidering it as affirmable by others \u2013 or, in modern\nterminology, by one\u2019s epistemic\n peers.[41]\n This insight is an important step towards opinion pluralism and the\nconceptualization of reasonable disagreement, and it is significant\nthat it is in nuce implied in the both-sided probability of\nmedieval scholastics (Schuessler 2014).\n\nThe epistemological difficulties of both-sided probability (and of\nreasonable disagreement between competent reasoners) were not,\nhowever, analyzed in depth by medieval scholastics. Nor did they\ninvestigate how an epistemology of acceptance of probable opinions as\npremises for action differs from one which assumes assent or\naffirmation of the opinions in question. All this happened much later\nin the scholastic tradition, in the seventeenth century; but this is\nanother story (Deman 1936; Knebel 2000; Schuessler 2019; Schwartz\n2019; Tutino 2018). The developments in question were linked to the\nrise of a new scholastic doctrine called probabilism in the\nseventeenth century. Probabilism, as understood at the time (the\nmodern understanding of the term is quite different), legitimizes a\nspecific way of using probable\n opinions.[42]\n It is not synonymous with any kind of probabilistic\nreasoning. However, we need not deal with scholastic probabilism any\nfurther because the doctrine did not exist in the period now under\nconsideration. It is sometimes attributed to medieval authors, but\nsuch ascriptions should be contested and, in any case, should not be\naccepted without deeper discussion for authors who wrote before\n1500.\n",
