Beyond Continental Rationalism: Other Voices\n\n\nSince the early twentieth century, \u201ccontinental\nrationalism\u201d has been profitably juxtaposed with \u201cBritish\nempiricism\u201d. The juxtaposition turns on the notion that the\nrationalist views that were popular on the \u201ccontinent\u201d\nwere contemporaneous with the empiricist views that dominated the\nphilosophical conversations in Britain.\n\n\nWhile the demarcation between rationalism and empiricism may be useful\nas an interpretive and pedagogical tool, it should be borne in mind\nthat it is a construction in retrospect. The distinction between\nEmpirici and Dogmatici is traceable from ancient\nRoman medicine to Baconian (both Roger and Francis) philosophy of\nscience. While Kant and his early commentators imported the\ndistinction into philosophy, the terminology of\n\u201crationalism\u201d and \u201cempiricism\u201d, and the\nassociation of these terms with, respectively, the Continent and\nBritain emerged at the end of the nineteenth century (Aaron Wilson,\n16\u201320).\n\n\nIn recent years scholars have problematized both the general\nrationalist/empiricist distinction and the \u201ccontinental\nrationalism\u201d/\u201cBritish empiricism\u201d divide. As Norton\nhas shown, the \u201cBritish\u201d in \u201cBritish\nEmpiricism\u201d can be called into question when we take notice of\nthe important role played by the French philosopher Pierre Gassendi in\nthe propagation of empiricist thinking in the period (Norton 1981).\nIndeed, British philosophers in the relevant historical period were\nfar less disconnected from the Continent than they are\ntoday. Philosophical crossings from Britain were frequent and\nfruitful. In particular, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume all crossed the\nChannel. Further, Loeb (1981) argues with some plausibility that the\nrationalist-empiricist divide neglects strong rationalist strands in\nLocke\u2019s and Berkeley\u2019s thought. Increasingly, scholars of\nthe early modern period (but again, recall Goldstone\u2019s critique\nof early modernity as a periodization) are looking outside the bounds\nof the rationalist/empiricist distinction in order to more accurately\ncapture the intersections and divergences present in the constellation\nof ideas in the period.\n\n\nIndeed, problematizing the distinction between continental rationalism\nand British empiricism offers benefits beyond the possibility for\ngreater interpretative nuance and accuracy. In earlier sections of\nthis entry, we troubled the association of rationalism with the\nContinent by considering British philosophers Margaret Cavendish and\nAnne Conway alongside Malebranche and Leibniz, and Ghanaian\nphilosopher Anton Amo alongside Descartes. A focus on seventeenth and\neighteenth century rationalists, broadly conceived, as opposed to\ncontinental rationalists in particular, makes possible the\ninclusion in the conversation of other figures\u2014notably, women\nand non-Europeans\u2014who did not live on the Continent but who mark\nnodes of influence and importance in rationalist thought. Thus, an\nadditional strong motivation to call the distinction into question is\nin an effort to include other voices in this period.\n\n\nBefore we consider two final rationalist women philosophers from\nBritain, a brief digression is in order on the degree to which\nrationalism permitted the philosophical participation of women (and to\na lesser extent of racialized others).\n\n\nIt is by now a familiar trope that rationalism excludes women.\nGenevieve Lloyd famously argues that Descartes\u2019s\nreconceptualization of reason as an attainment, and as an attainment\nachieved by pure mind uncorrupted by sensuality and society,\nunintentionally (but significantly) excludes women\u2014whose\ndomestic roles inevitably involved the sensual and the social (Lloyd\n1984/1993, 40\u201351). Susan Bordo characterizes Cartesian\n\u201cobjectivism and mechanism\u201d as a \u201cflight\nfrom the female cosmos and \u2018feminine\u2019 orientation towards\nthe world\u201d (Bordo 1987, 100, emphasis in the original). Whether\nor not rationalism constitutively excludes women, it is clear that\nsome individual rationalists do so. See, for instance, Hasana\nSharp\u2019s argument that Spinoza sees the better but does the worse\nin his assertion in the\nPolitical Treatise that women are naturally unequal to men\n(Sharp 2012).\n\n\nAgainst the characterization of rationalism as excluding women,\nMargaret Atherton draws on Mary Astell and Damaris Lady Masham to\nargue that in fact rationalism offered a framework in which women\n(and, one presumes, members of non-European cultures) could do\nphilosophy. By prescribing a method of reasoning that doesn\u2019t hinge on\na particular education or social standing, argues Atherton (after\nAstell), rationalism reconceptualizes reason as in principle possible\nfor all humans\u2014man and woman, Plow-man and Doctor (Atherton,\n32). Erica Harth traces the history of sixteenth and seventeenth\ncentury French \u201csalon women\u201d and offers evidence that\nDescartes\u2019s clear, jargon-free French and commitment to being\nintelligible by lay people made Cartesianism appealing to the women\nwho regularly participated in philosophical salons. Further, Harth\nreconstructs the thought of the prominent salon women to show that\nthey extend Cartesianism in novel ways (Harth 1991). However, she\nnotes that most of what comes down to us from French Cartesianism of\nthe day originated in the male-only academy, and not the salons.\n\n\nWhatever the remaining legacy of Cartesian women in France, Astell\nremains an important interpreter and proponent of Descartes\u2019s\nepistemological method, a method she explicitly endorses as the basis\nfor supporting the education of, and philosophical inquiry by, women.\nIn her two-part 1694 and 1697 A Serious Proposal to the Ladies:\nWherein a Method is offer\u2019d for the Improvement of their\nMinds, Astell urges that meditation (in Descartes\u2019s sense\nof that term) avails itself to all who apply themselves to it with\ndedication. She admits that those (women or labourers, for instance)\nwhose circumstances do not permit them to contemplate truth may at\nfirst find such contemplation unfruitful. However, she proposes\nreading, discoursing, and serious meditation as remedies to this\nsituation. While Astell rejects the view that some people\u2019s\nembodiment make them more suited for practical than intellectual\npursuits, she acknowledges that some reasoners\u2019 animal spirits\nmay incline them to volatility of thought; she therefore counsels\nreasoners to withdraw their minds from their bodies and the material\nworld. Alice Sowaal identifies in Astell three central rationalist\nthemes: \u201can emphasis of the mind over the body; a theory of\ninnate ideas as the origin of knowledge; and a methodology that leads\nthe novice from confusion to clarity\u201d (Sowaal). Astell bolsters\nher Cartesian method with a theological argument that God would not\ncreate naturally defective rational beings, and hence that all human\nbeings are capable of rational thought. If women are at first unable\nto reason well, it is the result of their circumstances and not their\nnature, she argues. Astell thus both draws on Descartes and\nanticipates Wollstonecraft.\n\n\nRelaxing the criteria for inclusion in the \u201crationalist\u201d\ncamp also invites us to appropriately situate the rationalism of\nScottish philosopher Mary Shepherd. Shepherd was a sharp critic of\nHume\u2019s endorsement of the causal system we might call\n\u201cMalebranche without God\u201d. Shepherd raised her objections\nto Hume\u2019s theory on the basis of her commitment to the\nsuperiority of reason for knowledge, and in particular knowledge of\nthe truths of causation. Here we see that she shares at least one\ncharacteristic of those typically ascribed to rationalists, the\nexaltation of reason over the senses in knowledge acquisition. In\nAn Essay Upon the Relation of Cause and Effect (1824),\nShepherd seeks to dismantle Hume\u2019s causal theory of constant\nconjunction by arguing that we can indeed have intuitive knowledge\nthat everything that exists requires a cause. Moreover, on her view,\nit is reason, not \u201ccustom\u201d or \u201chabit\u201d, that is\nour chief guide in the understanding of our daily lives (27\u201328).\nShepherd\u2019s critique of Hume is important in its own right as a\nvaluable contribution to the philosophical conversation of her age. It\nis also, however, representative of the way that the rationalist\nperspective was being articulated in the first quarter of the 19th\ncentury. As such, it marks a moment in the history of rationalism.\nPutting Shepherd into conversation with her fellow rationalists across\ntime only serves to deepen and broaden our understanding of this line\nof thinking.\n\n\nIn sum then, while the notion of continental rationalism can be a\nuseful heuristic, especially for teaching and learning, it ought not\nto be a strict criterion. A less restrictive conception of rationalism\nnot only supports a more historically accurate, nuanced understanding\nof philosophical movements in the period; it also renders the\nrationalist canon more diverse. As historians of philosophy\nincreasingly work to develop more inclusive canons, such a\nreconceptualization is all to the good.\n",
