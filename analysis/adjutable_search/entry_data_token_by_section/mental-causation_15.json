Problem III: Exclusion\n\nWhile reflection on property dualism or anomalous monism can lead to\nour next property-based problem, another route is by way of the\ndoctrine of\n non-reductive physicalism.\n Like the property dualist, the non-reductive physicalist holds that\nmental properties are not physical. But unlike the property dualist,\nthe non-reductive physicalist insists on a strong dependence of the\nmental on the physical: mental properties are \u201crealized\u201d\nor \u201cconstituted\u201d by physical properties. This strong tie\nbetween the mental and physical is the subject of a large contemporary\nliterature, some of which we touch on below.\n",
