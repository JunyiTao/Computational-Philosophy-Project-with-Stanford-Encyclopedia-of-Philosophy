    "main_text": "Denial of Mind-Body Interaction, Assertion of Pre-established Harmony\n2. Denial of Mind-Body Interaction, Assertion of Pre-established Harmony\n\nA central philosophical issue of the seventeenth century concerned the\napparent causal relations which hold between the mind and the body. In\nmost seventeenth-century settings, this issue was discussed within the\ncontext of substance dualism, the view that mind and body are\ndifferent kinds of substance. As noted above, Leibniz remained\nfundamentally opposed to dualism. But although Leibniz held that there\nis only one type of substance in the world, and thus that mind and\nbody are ultimately composed of the same kind of substance (a version\nof monism), he also held that mind and body are metaphysically\ndistinct. There are a variety of interpretations of what this\nmetaphysical distinctness consists in for Leibniz, but on any\nplausible interpretation it is safe to assume (as Leibniz seems to\nhave done) that for any person P, P\u2019s mind is\na distinct substance (a soul) from P\u2019s body. With this\nassumption in hand, we may formulate the central issue in the form of\na question: how is it that certain mental states and events are\ncoordinated with certain bodily states and events, and vice-versa?\nThere were various attempts to answer this question in Leibniz\u2019s\ntime period. For Descartes, the answer was mind-body interactionism:\nthe mind can causally influence the body and (most commentators have\nheld) vice-versa. For Malebranche, the answer was that neither created\nminds nor bodies can enter into causal relations because God is the\nonly causally efficient being in the universe. God causes certain\nbodily states and events on the occasion of certain mental states and\nevents, and vice-versa. Leibniz found Descartes\u2019 answer\nunintelligible (cf. Theodicy, sec. 60; G VI, 135f.) and\nMalebranche\u2019s excessive because miraculous (cf. Letter to\nArnauld, 14 July 1686; G II, 57/LA 65).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s account of mind-body causation was in terms of his\nfamous doctrine of the pre-established harmony. According to\nthe latter, (1) no state of a created substance has as a real cause\nsome state of another created substance (i.e. a denial of\ninter-substantial causality); (2) every non-initial, non-miraculous,\nstate of a created substance has as a real cause some previous state\nof that very substance (i.e. an affirmation of intra-substantial\ncausality); and (3) each created substance is programmed at creation\nsuch that all its natural states and actions are carried out in\nconformity with all the natural states and actions of every other\ncreated substance.\n\nFormulating (1) through (3) in the language of minds and bodies,\nLeibniz held that no mental state has as a real cause some state of\nanother created mind or body, and no bodily state has as a real cause\nsome state of another created mind or body. Further, every\nnon-initial, non-miraculous, mental state of a substance has as a real\ncause some previous state of that mind, and every non-initial,\nnon-miraculous, bodily state has as a real cause some previous state\nof that body. Finally, created minds and bodies are programmed at\ncreation such that all their natural states and actions are carried\nout in mutual coordination.\n\nAccording to Leibniz, what appear to be real causal relations\nbetween mind and body are, in metaphysical reality, the mutual\nconformity or coordination of mind and body\u2014in accordance with\n(3)\u2014with no interaction or divine intervention involved. For\nexample, suppose that Smith is pricked with a pin (call this bodily\nstate Sb) and pain ensues (call this mental state\nSm), a case of apparent body to mind causation. Leibniz would\nsay that in such a case some state of Smith\u2019s mind (soul) prior\nto Sm was the real cause of Sm and Sb was\nnot a causal factor in the obtaining of Sm. Suppose now that\nSmith has a desire to raise his arm (call this mental state\nSm), and the raising of his arm ensues (call this bodily\nstate Sb), a case of apparent mind to body causation. Leibniz\nwould say that in such a case some state of Smith\u2019s body prior\nto Sb was the real cause of Sb and Sm was\nnot a causal factor in the obtaining of Sb. So although\nsubstances do not causally interact, their states accommodate one\nanother as if there were causal interaction among\nsubstances.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Leibniz did think that there was a\nsense in which one could say that mental events influence bodily\nevents and vice-versa. He wrote to Antoine Arnauld that although\n\u201cone particular substance has no physical influence on another\n\u2026 nevertheless, one is quite right to say that my will is the\ncause of this movement of my arm \u2026; for the one expresses\ndistinctly what the other expresses more confusedly, and one must\nascribe the action to the substance whose expression is more\ndistinct\u201d (28 November 1686 (draft); G II, 71/LA 87). In this\npassage, Leibniz sets forth what he takes the metaphysical reality of\napparent inter-substantial causation to amount to. We begin with the\nthesis that every created substance perceives the entire universe,\nthough only a portion of it is perceived distinctly, most of it being\nperceived unconsciously, and, hence, confusedly. Now consider two\ncreated substances, x and y (x not\nidentical to y), where some state of x is said to be\nthe cause of some state of y. Leibniz\u2019s analysis is\nthis: when the causal state of affairs occurred, the relevant\nperceptions of substance x became more distinct, while the\nrelevant perceptions of substance y became more confused.\nInsofar as the relevant perceptions of x become increasingly\ndistinct, it is \u201ccausally\u201d active; insofar as the relevant\nperceptions of substance y become increasingly confused, it\nis passive. In general, causation is to be understood as an increase\nin distinctness on the part of the causally active substance and an\nincrease in confusedness on the part of the passively affected\nsubstance. Again, each substance is programmed at creation to be\nactive/passive at the relevant moment with no occurrence of real\nsubstantial interaction.\n\nIt is difficult to say exactly why Leibniz denied inter-substantial\ncausation. Some of the things he tells us, in both private and public\nwritings, seem unsatisfactory. For example, in Primary Truths\n(1686?), we are given this:\n\nStrictly speaking, one can say that no created substance exerts a\nmetaphysical action or influx on any other thing. For, not to\nmention the fact that one cannot explain how something can pass from\none thing into the substance of another, we have already shown that\nfrom the notion of each and every thing follows all of its future\nstates. What we call causes are only concurrent requisites, in\nmetaphysical rigor. (C 521/A&G 33)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s first reason for denying inter-substantial causation,\nthat \u201cone cannot explain how something can pass from one thing\ninto the substance of another,\u201d is a clear reference to the\ninflux theory of causation. Leibniz found this theory\ninconsistent with his conception of substance. Influx theory could\nonly explain causal relations between entities with parts, according\nto Leibniz. It is through these parts that \u201csomething can pass\nfrom one thing into \u2026 another.\u201d But Leibnizian substances\ndo not have parts in the requisite sense. (For more on influx theory,\nsee O\u2019Neil 1993.) Leibniz also gives a reason tied to his\ncomplete concept theory of substance, according to which \u201cthe\nnature of an individual substance or of a complete being is to have a\nnotion so complete that it is sufficient to contain and to allow us to\ndeduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which this notion\nis attributed\u201d (Discourse on Metaphysics, sec. 8; (G\nIV, 433/A&G 41)). But there are, it seems, at least two problems\nwith this explanation. First, Leibniz moves rather quickly from a\nconceptual explanation of substance in terms of the complete concept\ntheory to the conclusion that this consideration is sufficient to\nexplain the activity of concrete substances. Second, even if\nconceptual considerations about substances were sufficient to explain\ntheir apparent causal activity, it does not seem to follow that\nsubstances do not interact\u2014unless one is assuming that causal\noverdetermination is not a genuine possibility. Leibniz seems to be\nassuming just that but without argument. \n\nSometimes Leibniz gives a more familiar line of reasoning. At\nMonadology 7, we read this:\n\nThere is no way of explaining how a monad can be altered or changed\ninternally by some other creature, since one cannot transpose anything\nin it, nor can one conceive of any internal motion that can be\nexcited, directed, augmented, or diminished within it, as can be done\nin composites, where there can be change among the parts. The monads\nhave no windows through which something can enter or leave. Accidents\ncannot be detached, nor can they go about outside of substances, as\nthe sensible species of the Scholastics once did. Thus, neither\nsubstance nor accident can enter a monad from without. (G VI,\n607/A&G 213f.)\n\n\nHe seems to think that causal interaction between two beings requires\nthe transmission or transposition of the parts of those beings. But\nsubstances are simple unextended entities which contain no parts.\nThus, there is no way to explain how one substance could influence\nanother. Unfortunately, however, this line of reasoning would seem to\nalso rule out one case of inter-substantial causation which Leibniz\nallows, viz., God\u2019s concurrent causal action on finite simple\nsubstances.\n",
