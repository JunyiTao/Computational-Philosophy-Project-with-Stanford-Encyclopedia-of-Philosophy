(Please\nrefer to the table of contents of the entry\n Charles Sanders Peirce.)\n Logic was one of the main topics on which Peirce wrote. If we focus\non logic, however, it becomes apparent that both Peirce\u2019s\nconcept of logic and his work on logic were much broader than his\npredecessors\u2019, his contemporaries\u2019, and ours. First,\nPeirce located logic in his large architectonic framework of\nphilosophy, which is why some strongly believe that Peirce\u2019s\nlogic cannot be properly understood without understanding his\npragmatism and his semiotics, to mention but two of his other\ncontributions. Even within the traditional boundaries of logic, Peirce\nmade too many contributions to outline in a single article.\n\nAcknowledging the nature of this next-to-impossible task, we single\nout the common theme of Peirce\u2019s various contributions to modern\nlogic\u2014to extend logic, as characterized by the three different\ndimensions: \n\n the scope of formalism (from monadic to relations), \n the kinds of systems (from symbolic to diagrammatic systems), and\n\n semantic values (from bivalence to three values).\n\n\nThe main goal of this entry is not only to present Peirce\u2019s\naccomplishments in each of these three extensions, but also to explore\nthe relations, if any, among these novel developments. The three\nsections of the entry will be devoted, respectively, to each of these\nthree ways how the horizon of deductive logic is expanded by\nPeirce.\n\nPeirce\u2019s journey on formal deductive logic started with Boolean\ncalculus and De Morgan\u2019s logic of relatives. Boolean algebra\ncreated a path to generalize Aristotelian syllogism and De\nMorgan\u2019s ambition to formalize relations opened a new territory\nto conquer. However, Peirce\u2019s predicate logic is neither a\nmechanical expansion from the existing logics nor a simple combination\nof these two. A leap made by Peirce from his contemporary logic is\nqualitatively substantial enough to call Peirce a founder of modern\ndeductive logic, as the entry explains. The first section explores\nPeirce\u2019s development of predicate logic presented in his several\nwell-known papers, by locating the root of Peirce\u2019s introduction\nof quantifiers and bound variables. While formal details and notations\nof Peirce\u2019s first-order logic can be overwhelming, one should\nnot lose the sight of the bigger picture by paying attention to the\nmain motivation behind Peirce\u2019s enterprise for a new logic.\nConquering new territory\u2014relations\u2014with new formal\nnotation, Peirce\u2019s adventure was launched into another\ndimension\u2014a new mode of representation, that is, diagrammatic\nrepresentation. This is the topic of the second section. While two\nsystems of Peirce\u2019s Existential Graphs (\u201cEG\u201d\nhenceforth) are presented, the following perspective is at the\nbackground: Peirce\u2019s EG were not invented just as random\nalternatives, logically equivalent to his own predicate logical\nnotation, but a reflection of Peirce\u2019s new approach to logic and\nformalization. As Peirce\u2019s tireless attempts for predicate logic\nbrought to us more powerful formal notation, Peirce\u2019s search for\nbetter representation of relational states of affairs was pursued\nbeyond his own symbolic system. Spatial, as opposed to linear,\nnotation is still not familiar to some of us, and the second section\nintroduces the basic notational aspects of Peirce\u2019s EG, and\ndiscusses the fundamental differences between EG and symbolic systems.\nThe third section about three-valued logic examines another new\nenterprise of Peirce, not in syntactic notation, but in semantic\nvalues. Peirce scholars propose various motivations behind\nPeirce\u2019s three value semantics and those different views will be\nbriefly discussed.\n\nWhile the first contribution, that is, an extension from monadic to\npredicate logic, has positioned Peirce as a founder of modern logic\nalong with Frege, it took much longer for Peirce\u2019s other\nachievements to receive proper attention from logicians or\nphilosophers. The entry aims to draw a road map for Peirce\u2019s\njourney in deductive logic so that one may realize his accomplishments\nare very much connected with each other. More specifically,\nPeirce\u2019s achievements in deductive logic were accumulative.\nAfter being able to formalize polyadic relations with new symbolic\nnotation, Peirce devised a totally new form of\nrepresentation\u2014diagrammatic systems. What we can formalize is\nextended and how we can formalize what we can formalize is\nextended. And Peirce ventured into what our formalization represents\nand suggested a more fine-grained or a bigger territory of semantic\nvalues than binary True or False values.\n", "toc": [{"#MonaPolyLogi": "1.

From Monadic to Polyadic Logic\n\nPeirce and Frege, independently of each other, took us from the\ntraditional Aristotelian logic to modern logic\u2014a large leap.\nNobody could deny the power of formalization which has led early\ntwentieth century mathematicians to surprising achievements and\n results.[1]\n What is the essence of the leap made by Peirce and Frege? Is it just\na matter of introducing new formal notations, i.e., quantifiers and\nvariables, so that we may easily formalize our reasoning? If so,\nmodern logic would be just dressing up Aristotelian logic with\nquantifiers/variables. This would equate one of Peirce\u2019s main\ncontributions in logic to the increase in formal vocabulary.\n\nThe enormous impact of the adoption of quantifiers/bound variables on\nthe world of logic and mathematics cannot be denied. However, that\nshould not overshadow Peirce\u2019s insight behind the new extended\nformalism. This section will explore how Peirce\u2019s conviction\nabout the novelty of the logic of relations led him to the\nintroduction of quantifiers/variables. Hence, quantification theory,\naccording to Peirce, is not a matter of a linear extension of formal\nvocabulary, but an expansion into territory that is qualitatively\ndifferent from what Aristotelian logic covers. At the same time, we\nshould not forget that Peirce extended the territory of logic in the\nspirit of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic.\n\nIn \u201cAn Improvement in Boole\u2019s Calculus of Logic\u201d\n(1867) Peirce hints at the need for an improvement of Boolean logic,\nnot in the context of predicate logic, but in its inability to express\nexistential statements in the context of term logic. His 1870 paper\n\u201cDescription of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives, Resulting\nfrom an Amplification of the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s\nCalculus\u201d (DNLR) reveals his ambition to marry Boole\u2019s\nalgebraic notation with De Morgan\u2019s effort at relational\nrepresentation. Many agree that this paper introduces essential\nvocabulary of first-order predicate logic for the first time in\nhistory. Subsequently, in \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d (1880)\nPeirce investigates two kinds of operations over\nrelations\u2014relative sum and relative product\u2014and \u201cThe\nLogic of Relatives\u201d (known as \u201cNote B\u201d) published in\nhis edited book Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity (1883) shows a major progress in quantification,\ninfluenced by the work of O. H. Mitchell (who was his student).\nFinally, Peirce\u2019s 1885 paper \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A\nContribution to the Philosophy of Notations\u201d has been considered\nto be the place where Peirce fully presented his quantification\ntheory.\n\nStarting with DNLR, the first subsection examines Pierce\u2019s\nsubsequent steps until he presented the final form of his first-order\nlogic in his 1885 paper \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: a Contribution\nto the Philosophy of Notations\u201d. (For a number of manuscripts\nwritten between these two papers, refer to Beatty 1969; Dipert 2004:\n297\u2013299; and Merrill 1978.) The second subsection locates\nPeirce\u2019s first-order predicate logic work in a larger\ncontext.\n1.1 Relations and quantification formalized\n\nPeirce\u2019s quantification theory is presented in a comprehensive\nway together with axiomlike \u201cicons\u201d in his 1885 paper\n\u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of\nNotations\u201d. Peirce\u2019s not-short journey to modern logic\nstarted with his attempt to extend the territory of formalization. In\nthis, Peirce was inspired by De Morgan\u2019s struggle for the\nrepresentation of relations, and at the same time Peirce was empowered\nwith Boolean calculus which formalizes Aristotelian term logic. That\nis, Peirce took De Morgan\u2019s ambition as a road map for the\ndirection while being equipped with Boole\u2019s method and notation\nfor getting there. This subsection will follow Peirce\u2019s journey\nto see how he reached the destination, by checking in at his main\nstops.\n\nThe title of Peirce\u2019s 1870 paper \u201cDescription of a\nNotation for the Logic of Relatives, Resulting from an Amplification\nof the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s Calculus\u201d (DNLR) is spelled\nout at the beginning of the paper in the following way:\n\n\n[I]t is interesting to inquire whether it [Boole\u2019s logical\nalgebra] cannot be extended over to the whole realm of formal logic,\ninstead of being restricted to that simplest and least useful part of\nthe subject, the logic of absolute terms,\u2026The object of this\npaper is to show that an affirmative answer can be given to this\nquestion. (DNLR [CP 3.45])\n\n\nBoolean logic needs to be \u201cextended\u201d if we want to cover\nthe entire realm of formal logic, Peirce states. What does Peirce mean\nby \u201cthe whole realm of formal logic\u201d? Peirce answers:\n\u201cDeductive logic can really not be understood without the study\nof the logic of relatives\u201d (1911a [CP\n 3.641]).[2]\n\nBeing encouraged by Boole\u2019s algebra of logic, but at the same\ntime taking his father, Professor Benjamin Peirce\u2019s negative\nview of logic\n seriously,[3]\n Peirce explored a way to apply Boole\u2019s method to a larger\ndomain of our reasoning so that relations may be formalized.\n\nWhat are relations and why are they so special? Let\u2019s compare\nthree sentences: \u201cJohn is an American\u201d, \u201cJohn is\ntaller than Tom\u201d, and \u201cJohn is between Tom and\nMary\u201d. The first sentence has a unary predicate \u201cis an\nAmerican\u201d, the second sentence a binary predicate \u201cis\ntaller than\u201d, and the third sentence a ternary predicate\n\u201cis between\u2026and\u2026\u201d. A unary predicate stands\nfor a property or quality, while a binary or ternary predicate stands\nfor a relation. If a first-order logical system has only unary\npredicates, then we say it is monadic. Otherwise, predicate logic is\nassumed to have binary or other higher predicates.\n\nWhen we move from monadic to polyadic logic, substantial changes take\nplace. The following three changes are at the top of the list.\nFirst of all, a move from property to relation is a territory\nexpansion. Noting that Aristotelian syllogisms are limited to unary\npredicates, one expects polyadic logic to represent more than the\nreasoning involved in Aristotelian syllogism, that is, term logic.\nSecond, monadic logic is decidable while polyadic logic is\nnot decidable, as Church\u2019s theorem proved. In some sense, as the\nterritory is expanded, we are losing its grip. Third, a\nchange in notation is inevitable, which necessitates modern\nquantification theory. How are these three important aspects are\nhandled by Peirce?\n\nThe realm of relations was a frontier where De Morgan did much of his\ncreative and novel work on\n logic.[4]\n However, his inquiry on the topic resides within the patterns of\ntraditional\n syllogisms.[5]\n Even more importantly, De Morgan did not have enough tools to\nformalize this newly extended\n realm.[6]\n Hence, not surprisingly De Morgan\u2019s relations are rather\nlimited to a certain group which fit in syllogistic reasoning. As\nMerrill points out, \n\n\nDe Morgan develops the general logic of relations only to the point\nwhere it can be used for his familiar syllogistic purposes. This means\nthat he is especially interested in relations which are convertible\nand/or transitive,\u2026. (Merrill 1990: 113) \n\n\nIt is somewhat unclear and controversial whether Peirce\u2019s\ninterest in the logic of relations started independently of De\nMorgan\u2019s work on the\n subject.[7]\n Regardless of the origin of Peirce\u2019s inquiry into relations,\nmany have come to agree that it is Peirce (not De Morgan) who\nsuccessfully formalized the logic of relations. Merrill, a De Morgan\nscholar, puts the matter in the following way:\n\n\nThe most obvious problem with this view of the proposition [De\nMorgan\u2019s way of handling relational arguments] is that it does\nnot seem general enough. If we can unite two terms into a proposition\nby relating them, why not three or four or ten terms? De\nMorgan\u2019s concern with the relational syllogism seems to have\nprecluded this generalization; but there is no reason in principle why\nit could not be made. For this, though, we must wait for Frege and\nPeirce. (Merrill 1990: 110)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Peirce\u2019s writings before 1870 DNLR show\nPeirce also attempted to solve relational arguments by traditional\nsyllogistic reasoning\n rules,[8]\n but the approach taken in DNLR is totally different\u2014not within\na syllogistic frame but by introducing Boolean algebra notation.\nPeirce must have realized the power of generalization that Boolean\nnotation could provide. Boole\u2019s algebra formalized Aristotelian\ncategorical syllogisms and opened a way for generalization of term\n logic.[9]\n Peirce, who was impressed with Boole\u2019s mathematical treatment\nof Aristotelian syllogisms, not surprisingly aimed to apply this\nmethod to relations. In that sense, modern predicate logic started in\nPeirce\u2019s 1870 pioneering work. Hence, the goal of Peirce\u2019s\nproject\u2014that is, to broaden the scope of formalization in\nlogic\u2014was a main motivation for the introduction of new\nvocabulary for quantifiers and bound variables. If so, Peirce\u2019s\ninsight early on as to the importance of reasoning involving relations\nis a key element in understanding a difference between Peirce\u2019s\nand Frege\u2019s developments of first-order\n logic.[10]\n Furthermore, the next section will show how Peirce\u2019s obsession\nwith the logic of relations led him to the invention of Existential\nGraphs.\n\nThe logic of relations formalizes a larger territory than monadic\nlogic, but there is a price to pay for obtaining the additional\nexpressive power: While monadic logic is decidable, polyadic logic is\nnot. Even though we need to wait until Church\u2019s theorem to see\nthe undecidability of first-order predicate logic, Peirce intuited a\nfundamental difference between the logic of non-relatives versus the\nlogic of relations. Here are Peirce\u2019s suggestive ideas over the\ncomparisons between monadic and relational logic: \n\n\nThe logic of relatives is highly multiform; it is characterized by\ninnumerable immediate inferences, and by various distinct conclusions\nfrom the same set of premises. (1883a [CP 3.342]) \n\n\nAnd: \n\n\n[T]he old syllogistic inference can be worked by machinery, but\ncharacteristic relative inferences cannot be performed by any mere\nmechanical rule whatever. (1896: 330) \n\n\nAs Dipert correctly points out, Peirce\u2019s remarks reveal his\n\u201cunderstanding of the richness and difficulty which\nrelations introduce into logic\u201d (Dipert 1984a:\n 63).[11]\n\nIn order to increase expressive power, Peirce left the traditional\nsyllogistic pattern and brought in Boolean algebra of logic. The\nfollowing comment emphasizes that Peirce\u2019s choice of notation\nmarks a clear departure from De Morgan\u2019s pursuit of relational\nlogic: \n\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s methodology is governed by the logic of syllogism\nwhile Peirce\u2019s methodology is entirely algebraic. This algebraic\nmodel taken over from Boole is foreign to De Morgan\u2019s methods.\nThis difference in methodology reflects a significant difference at\nthe level of definition. (Brunning 1991: 36)\n\n\nAnd after realizing the complicated nature of the logic of relations,\nPeirce explored new notation beyond Boolean calculus. That\nmove is predicted in the following passage: \n\n\nThe effect of these peculiarities [the non-mechanic nature of relative\nlogic] cannot be subjected to hard and fast rules like those of the\nBoolian calculus. (1883a [CP 3.342]) \n\n\nHere is the third aspect of a transition from monadic to polyadic\nlogic: The complication that relations bring in our reasoning,\nobviously, pushed Peirce to develop a new notational system. As the\nrest of this subsection shows, the process made over the course of 15\nyears\u2014from DNLR to \u201cOn the algebra of\nlogic\u201d\u2014is rather complicated. Importantly, Peirce\u2019s\nintroduction of quantifiers and bound variables could be seen as an\ninevitable outcome of his ambitious goal to expand the scope of\nformalization to cover relations, as Merrill says \u201cThe\nquantification complexities of many relational statements cried out\nfor quantifiers\u201d (1997: 158).\n\nThe third section of DNLR, as the title \u201cApplication of the\nAlgebraic Signs to Logic\u201d says, is one of the first places where\nBoolean algebraic notation and relational logic joined each other. In\nthe first subsection Peirce makes it clear that the territory he aims\nto cover is relational, by including polyadic predicates in the\nfollowing way: \n\n(DNLR [CP 3.63\u201364]; the entry adopts our modern terminology\ninstead of Peirce\u2019s.)\n\n\n\n\nPredicates\nPeirce\u2019s terminology\nLetters\nExamples  \n\n\nunary\nabsolute terms\n\\(\\unary{a}, \\unary{b}, \\unary{c},\\)\u2026 (Roman\nalphabet)\nFrenchman \\((\\unary{f})\\), violinist\n\\((\\unary{u})\\),\u2026 \n\nbinary\nsimple relative terms\n\\(\\binary{a}, \\binary{b}, \\binary{c}\\),\u2026 (italics)\nwife \\((\\binary{w})\\)), lover \\((\\binary{l})\\), owner \\((\\binary{o})\\),\u2026\n\n\nternary\nconjugative terms\n\\(\\ternary{a}, \\ternary{b}, \\ternary{c}\\)\u2026 (Kennerly\n[Kennerley])\ngiver to \u2014 of \u2014 \\((\\ternary{g})\\) \n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the third section, four kinds of algebraic signs are\nintroduced to be applied on these predicate letters: the inclusion\nsign (\\(\\inclusion\\)), the addition sign (\\(\\cunion\\)), the\nmultiplication sign (juxtaposition or \u201c,\u201d), and the\ninvolution sign (exponentiation).\n\nFirst, he combines the sign equality \u201c=\u201d and the sign\n\\(<\\) for \u201cless than\u201d to come up with the sign\n\u201c\\(\\inclusion;\\)\u201d to represent inclusion:\n\n\nThus, \n\n\\[\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\unary{m}\\]\n\n\nmeans \u201cevery Frenchman is a man\u201d, without saying whether\nthere are any other men or not. So, \n\n\\[\\binary{m} \\inclusion \\binary{l}\\]\n\n\nwill mean that every mother of anything is a lover of the same thing;\nalthough this interpretation in some degree anticipates a convention\nto be made further on. (DNLR [CP 3.66])\n\n\nNote that \u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\binary{m}\\)\u201d (unlike\n\u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\unary{m}\\)\u201d) would be\nungrammatical since \\(\\binary{m}\\), being a binary predicate, cannot\nhave an inclusion relation with a unary predicate \\(\\unary{f}\\).\n\nFor the sign of addition, Peirce brings in Boolean sign \\(+\\), but\nwith slight variation:\n\n\nThe sign of addition is taken by Boole, so that \n\n\\[x + y\\]\n\n\ndenotes everything denoted by \\(x\\), and besides, everything\ndenoted by \\(y\\).\u2026But if there is anything which is denoted by\nboth the terms of the sum, the latter no longer stands for any logical\nterm on account of its implying that the objects denoted by one term\nare to be taken besides the objects denoted by the other. For\nexample, \n\n\\[\\unary{f} + \\unary{u}\\]\n\n\nmeans all Frenchmen besides all violinists, and, therefore, considered\nas a logical term, implies that all French violinists are besides\nthemselves. For this reason alone\u2026I preferred to take as\nthe regular addition of logic a non-invertible process, such that\n\n\\[\\unary{m} \\cunion \\unary{b}\\]\n\n\nstands for all men and black things, without implication that the\nblack things are to be taken besides the men. (DNLR [CP 3.67])\n\n\nHence, Peirce\u2019s slightly modified addition sign, \\(\\cunion\\) ,\ndenotes inclusive disjunction. \u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\cunion\n\\unary{u}\\)\u201d denotes all those who are either a Frenchman or a\nviolinist. The notation does not imply that no Frenchman is a\nviolinist or no violinist is a Frenchman. Even though Peirce\u2019s\nexample is limited to unary predicates, we can extend the idea to\nbinary. Using modern notation, \n\n\\[\\binary{l} \\cunion \\binary{s}  = \\{\\langle x, y\\rangle \\mid lover(x, y) \\lor servant(x,y)\\}.\\] \n\n That is, it corresponds to\na union of relations.\n\nWhen the multiplication sign enters the picture, the logic of\nrelations becomes powerful, and here is Peirce\u2019s hallmark for\nthe interpretation of multiplication:\n\n\nI shall adopt for the conception of multiplication the application\nof a relation, in such a way that, for example,\n\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\) shall denote whatever is a lover of a\nwoman.\u2026\\(\\binary{s}(\\unary{m} \\cunion \\unary{w})\\) will, then,\ndenote whatever is a servant of anything of the class composed of men\nand women taken together. (DNLR [CP 3.68])\n\n\nWhen polyadic predicates are in the picture, how to form a new\nrelation becomes more interesting and complicated. This is why the\nmultiplication operation of relative product is extremely important\nfor further work on relational logic. A product between two predicates\nis much more interesting than an addition between two, depending on\nwhat kinds of predicates are involved: \n\nThe product between two properties is another property, being the\nintersection between two properties, \n the product of a relation and a property is another new property,\nand \n the product between relations produces a new relation. \n\n\nLet\u2019s try to understand Peirce\u2019s concept of relative\nproduct in terms of modern terminology:\n\n\nLet\n\n\u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d be a unary predicate, being a\nwoman,\n \u201c\\(\\unary{u}\\)\u201d be a unary predicate, being a\nviolinist,\n \u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\)\u201d a binary predicate, being a lover\nof, and\n \u201c\\(\\binary{s}\\)\u201d be a binary one, being a servant of.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\\(\\unary{w}\\bcomma\\unary{u} = \\{x \\mid \\textit{woman}(x) \\land\n \\textit{violinist}(x)\\}\\).[12]\n\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w} = \\{ x \\mid \\exists y (\\textit{lover}(x, y)\n\\land \\textit{woman}(y))\\}\\).\n\\(\\binary{l}\\binary{s} = \\{ \\langle x, z\\rangle \\mid \\exists y\n(\\textit{lover}(x, y) \\land \\textit{servant}(y, z))\\}\\).\n\n\n\nIn this modern translation, the existence of an existential quantifier\nis noticeable, even though Peirce himself did not mention it at all in\nDNLR.\n\nHidden quantifier implication becomes even more obvious in the\noperation of involution below.\n\n\nI shall take involution in such a sense that \\(x^y\\) will denote\neverything which is an \\(x\\) for every individual of \\(y\\).

On the other hand, considering that Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogisms have two quantifiers, Peirce\u2019s algebraic notation for\nquantifiers\u2014some and every\u2014should not\nsurprise us. However, a crucial aspect of this development is that\nBoole\u2019s unsatisfactory representation of existential\npropositions (as opposed to universal propositions) pushed Peirce and\nhis student O. H. Mitchell to go beyond Boole\u2019s\n logic.[13]\n The way Peirce interprets a relative\nproduct\u2014\u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\u201d meaning\n\u201clover of some woman\u201d\u2014allows an existential\nquantifier to be expressed implicitly in terms of multiplication.\n\nLet us see several different ways Peirce pursued to represent\nexistential statements in a more explicit way. In the above for\n\u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, the existential quantifier is\ncarried out in the way relation \\(\\binary{l}\\) is applied to a unary\npredicate \u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, but not explicitly. There are\nseveral different explicit ways Peirce represents existential\nstatements. One method: borrowing exponentiation (in which a binary\npredicate is applied to a unary predicate, e.g.,\n\\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\)), Peirce expresses an existential statement\nas a contradiction of a universal statement:\n\n\nParticular [existential] propositions are expressed by the\nconsideration that they are contradictory of universal propositions.\nThus, as \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})=0\\) means every horse is\nblack, so \\(0^{\\unary{h}, (1-\\unary{b})} = 0\\) means that some horse\nis not black; and as \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma \\unary{b}= 0\\) means that no\nhorse is black, so \\(0^{\\unary{h}, \\unary{b}} = 0\\) means that some\nhorse is black. (DNLR [CP 3.141])\n\n\nThe number 1 represents the universe class and 0 the null class.\nHowever, Peirce\u2019s notation of exponentiation whose base is 0 has\nsome slightly different nuance. Let\u2019s recall Peirce\u2019s\nexponentiation operation: \n\n\\[\n\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{woman} (y)  \\rightarrow \\textit{lover}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n0^{0} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{null-class}(y)  \\rightarrow  \\textit{null-relation}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n[Note: The base 0 denotes a relation\u2014the null relation, while\nthe exponent 0 a class\u2014the null class.]\n\nThere is no \\(y\\) such that \\(\\textit{null-class}(y)\\), since noting\ncould be in the null-class. Hence, vacuously, every object in\nthe domain gets in \\(0^{0}\\). That is, the class of things which has\nno relation to the null class is the universe class which is\nrepresented by 1. Hence, \\(0^{0} = 1\\).\n\n\nSuppose \\(\\unary{m}\\not = 0\\). \n\n\\[\n0^{\\unary{m}} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{non-null-class}(y)  \\rightarrow  \\textit{null-relation}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSince nothing can bear the null-relation to every member of any\nnon-null class, \\(0^{\\unary{m}} = 0\\). Hence, we get the following\nexponentiation notation:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{*}     \n\\begin{align}\n0^x = 0    &\\quad \\textrm{if } x \\not =0\\\\\n0^x = 1 &\\quad \\textrm{if } x  =0\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing this result, let\u2019s unpack Peirce\u2019s above\nquotation:\n\n1 represents the universe class and 0 the null class.\n(Boolean symbols)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})\\)\u201d denotes\nthe class of non-black horses. (Multiplication operation for\nintersection)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})=0\\)\u201d says\nthat there is nothing that is non-black horse. I.e., every horse is\nblack. (by\n 1\n and\n 2)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b}) \\not = 0\\)\u201d\nmeans it is not the case that every horse is black. I.e., some horse\nis not black. (by\n 3)\nSince \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma (1-\\unary{b}) \\not = 0,\n0^{\\unary{h},(1-\\unary{b})} = 0\\) (by\n (*)\n above)\n\n\nSimilarly, \u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma\\unary{b}=0\\)\u201d means no\nhorse is black. Hence, \u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma \\unary{b} \\not =\n0\\)\u201d says some horse is black. Therefore,\n\u201c\\(0^{\\unary{h}\\bcomma\\unary{b}} = 0\\)\u201d (being the\nexponent being not-zero) means that some horse is black.\n\nThe method presented in DNLR [CP 3.141] is interesting for several reasons.\nFirst of all, Peirce maintains Boole\u2019s theme that all\npropositions are represented as equations. Another is that Peirce\nutilizes the contradictory relation between universal and existential\npropositions. Even more interestingly and importantly, Peirce brings\nin his exponentiation notation, exponentiation between relation to\nproperty (that is, between binary to unary predicates), to express\nexistential statements.\n\nAfter the rather complicated presentation of existential statements,\nfocusing on the exponent part, Peirce suggests another, much simpler,\nway to express existential statements by using the inequality\nsign:\n\n\nParticular [Existential] propositions may also be expressed by means\nof the signs of inequality. Thus, some animals are horses, may be\nwritten \\(\\unary{a}\\bcomma\\unary{h} > 0\\). (DNLR [CP 3.143])\n\n\nAnother method Peirce adopts is to utilize the sign \\(\\inclusion\\) for\ninclusion and the sign \\(\\bar{ \\ \\ }\\) for complement. That is,\n\n\n All \\(a\\) is \\(b\\).\n \\(a \\inclusion b\\)\n\n No \\(a\\) is \\(b\\). \n \\(a \\inclusion \\bar{b}\\)\n\n Some \\(a\\) is \\(b\\). \n \\(\\overline{[a \\inclusion \\bar{b}]}\\)\n\n Some \\(a\\) is not \\(b\\). \n \\(\\overline{[a \\inclusion b]}\\)\n\n\nHowever, these explicit ways to handle existential statements are\nlimited to unary predicates or Aristotelian syllogisms, and cannot go\nbeyond them. Instead, we would like to examine Peirce\u2019s\nmultiplication and exponential expressions between relations and\nproperties more carefully. Let\u2019s recall \\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\nmeans \u201ca lover of some woman\u201d while\n\\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\) \u201ca lover of every woman\u201d. Here\nPeirce\u2019s proposal for individual terms gets in the picture so\nthat existential and universal quantifiers may become more explicitly\nrepresented. Peirce suggests individuals be denoted by capitals (DNLR\n[CP 3.96]). For example, for unary predicate \\(\\unary{w}\\), if\n\\(\\unary{w} > 0\\), then \\(\\unary{w} = \\unary{W}' \\cunion\n\\unary{W}'' \\cunion \\unary{W}''' \\cunion \\cdots\\),\nwhere each of \\(\\unary{W}'\\), \\(\\unary{W}''\\),\n\\(\\unary{W}'''\\),\u2026denotes an individual woman.\nHence, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\binary{l}\\unary{w} & = \\binary{l}(\\unary{W}' \\cunion  \\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots)\\\\\n&= \\binary{l}\\unary{W}' \\cunion  \\binary{l}\\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\binary{l}\\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots\\\\\n\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}} &= \\binary{l}^{(\\unary{W} ' \\cunion      \\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots)}\\\\\n& = \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}'}, \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}''}, \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}'''},\\ldots\\\\\n& = \\binary{l}\\unary{W}', \\binary{l}\\unary{W}'', \\binary{l}\\unary{W}''',\\ldots (\\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}}=\\binary{l}\\unary{W}, \\unary{W} \\textrm{ being an individual term.})\n  \\end{align}\n  \\]\n\n\nAt this point, Peirce makes a connection (i) between existential\nstatements and the sign \\(\\Sigma\\) (as logical addition) and (ii)\nbetween universal statements and \\(\\Pi\\) (as logical multiplication),\nand the following passage is a precursor for the notations which\nappear in subsequent papers: \n\n\\[\\Pi' \\inclusion \\Sigma',\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Pi'\\) and \\(\\Sigma'\\) signify that the addition and\nthe multiplication with commas are to be used. From this it follows\nthat \n\n\\[s^{\\unary{w}} \\inclusion s\\unary{w}. \\qquad \\textrm{(DNLR [CP 3.97])}\\]\n\n\nWe have now come quite close to a modern notation of quantifiers.\nDipert emphasizes the significance of Peirce\u2019s notations found\nin DNLR:\n\n\nC. S. Peirce was the first person in the history of logic to use\nquantifier-like variable binding operators (briefly in 1870, W2, 392f,\npredating Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879)). (Dipert\n2004: 290)\n\n\nTen years later, in a more comprehensive and more survey-style paper,\n\u201cOn the algebra of logic\u201d (1880), we find Peirce\u2019s\nideas of DNLR emerge more tightly and more systematically. Below we\nwill now summarize the developments of quantification presented in\n\u201cBrief description of the algebra of relatives\u201d (1882a),\n\u201cThe logic of relatives\u201d (1883a), and \u201cOn the\nalgebra of logic: A contribution to the philosophy of notations\u201d\n(1885a plus 1885b).\n\nFirst, he modifies the previous idea of representing a property in\nterms of individual terms and extends it to relations. In DNLR (1870),\n\u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, which stands for the property\n\u201cbeing a woman\u201d, is expressed as \n\n \\[\\unary{w} = \\unary{W}' + \\unary{W}'' + \\unary{W}''' + \\cdots\\] \n\n\n(where \\(\\unary{W}'\\),\u2026 denotes each individual woman).\nHowever, in 1882a, Peirce expresses a unary predicate using\ncoefficients: For each unary predicate \\(x\\) and for each object \\(a\\)\nin the domain, Peirce defines the coefficient \\((x)_a\\) in the following way.\n\nContinuing the example for the unary predicate \\(\\unary{w},\\) suppose\nthe domain has objects \\(\\unary{A},\\) \\(\\unary{B},\\)\n \\(\\unary{C},\\)\u2026.[14]\n Some object is a woman and some is not. A coefficient\n\\((\\unary{w})_a\\) is defined as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\unary{w})_{a} A & = 1 \\textrm{ if } A \\textrm{ is woman.}\\\\\n& = 0 \\textrm{ if } A \\textrm{ is not a woman.}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\unary{w} & = (w)_{a} A  + (w)_{b} B+ (w)_{c} C + \\cdots\\\\\n&  = \\Sigma_{i} (w)_{i} \\binary{I}.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nA unary predicate is successfully represented as a sum of individuals.\nMoving on to a binary predicate, a relation is modeled by a pair of\n objects:[15]\n\n\nA dual relative term [binary predicate], such as \u201clover\u201d,\n\u201cbenefactor\u201d, \u201cservant\u201d, is a common name\nsignifying a pair of objects. (1883a [CP 3.328])\n\n\nAnd he expresses a pair of objects as \u201c\\(A:B\\)\u201d, where\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are individual objects. Let \\(\\binary{l}\\) stand for\n\u201ca lover\u201d. Peirce defines a coefficient for each ordered\npair of objects in the following way: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\binary{l})_{i, j} (A_i: A_j) & = 1 \\textrm{ if } A_i \\textrm{ is a lover of } A_j.\\\\\n& = 0 \\textrm{ if } A_i \\textrm{ is not a lover of } A_j.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\binary{l} & = (l)_{1,1}(A_{1}: A_{1}) + (l)_{1,2}(A_{1}: A_{2})  + (l)_{2,1}(A_{2}: A_{1}) + (l)_{2,2}(A_{2}: A_{2})  + \\cdots\\\\\n&  = \\Sigma_{i} \\Sigma_{j}(l)_{i,j}(A_i: A_j).\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s generalization for a unary predicate \\(\\unary{x}\\) and\na binary predicate \\(\\binary{l}\\) goes like this (1883a [CP\n3.329]): \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\unary{x} & = \\Sigma_{i} (\\unary{x})_i \\binary{I} & \\textrm{ (1882a [CP 3.306])}\\\\\n\\binary{l} & =  \\Sigma_{i} \\Sigma_{j}(\\binary{l})_{i,j}(I: J) &\\textrm{ (1883a [CP 3.329])}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThis is what Peirce had in mind when he wrote \u201cEvery term\n[predicate] may be conceived as a limitless logical sum of\nindividuals\u201d (1880 [CP 3.217]). We take only objects whose\ncoefficients are 1. Suppose \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\) are women.\nApplying Peirce\u2019s sign \u201c+\u201d as inclusive-or,\n\\(\\unary{w} = \\{ A, B, D\\}\\). Suppose \\(A\\) is a lover of \\(C\\), and\n\\(B\\) is a lover of \\(D\\). Then, \\(l = \\{( A: C),\n(B:\n D)\\}\\).[16]\n\nThe next task is how to utilize this tool to express an existential\nproposition. If there is at least one woman, say \\(K\\), in the domain,\nthere is at least one coefficient \\(\\unary{w}_k\\) such that it is 1.\nHence, the sum of coefficients of the individuals in the domain is\ngreater than 0. That is, \\(\\Sigma_{i} w_i > 0\\). If nobody is a\nwoman, we will get \\(\\Sigma_{i} w_i = 0\\). In the case of the\nuniversal proposition that everybody is a woman, the product of\ncoefficients is 0 as long as one coefficient is 0, that is, there is\none person who is not a woman. That is, \\(\\Pi_{i} w_i = 0\\). When\neverybody is a woman, \\(\\Pi _{i} w_i = 1\\).\n\nWhile the Boolean approach for quantifiers is limited to term logic,\nthis way of handling quantifiers is so general that we can apply it\ndirectly to relations as well, as the following passage states:\n\n\nAny proposition whatever is equivalent to saying that some complexus\nof aggregates [sums] and products of such numerical coefficients is\ngreater than zero. Thus, \n\n\\[\\Sigma_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij} > 0\\]\n\n\nmeans that something is a lover of something; and \n\n\\[\\Pi_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij} > 0.\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is a lover of something. (1883a [CP 3.351])\n\n\nAnd Peirce proposes to drop the \\(\u201c>0\u201d\\) part:\n\n\nWe shall, however, naturally omit, in writing the inequality, the\n\\(\u201c>0\u201d\\) which terminates them all; and the above two\npropositions will appear as\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\Pi_{i}\\Sigma_{j}\n\\binary{l}_{ij}.\\qquad\\) (1883a [CP 3.351])\n\n\n\nGetting to Peirce\u2019s 1883 paper, we witness two significant steps\ntaken: One is the use of index-subscripts in a crucial way, and the\nother is the alternation of \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\). After dropping\n\u201c\\(>0\\)\u201d Peirce draws our attention to the role of\nsubscripts:\n\n\nThe following are other examples: \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (l)_{ij} (b)_{ij}\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is at once a lover and a benefactor of\nsomething. \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (l)_{ij} (b)_{ji}\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is a lover of a benefactor of itself. (1883a [CP 3.352])\n\n\nThe order of index-subscripts is crucial to make a distinction between\nthese two propositions. On the other hand, a difference between\n\u201cEverybody loves some woman\u201d and \u201cThere is a woman\neverybody loves\u201d relies on the order of \\(\\Pi\\) and\n\\(\\Sigma\\): \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (\\binary{l})_{ij} ({\\unary{w}})_j    \\quad \\textrm{ vs.}\\quad  \\Sigma_j \\Pi_i  (\\binary{l})_{ij }({\\unary{w}})_j.\\]\n\n\nFinally in \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the\nphilosophy of notation\u201d (1885a) all of these\ndevelopments\u2014(i) \\(\\Sigma\\) (sum) for some and \\(\\Pi\\)\n(product) for all, (ii) utilizing coefficients and their\nsubscripts to drop denotation of individuals (e.g., from \\((l)_{ij}\n(A_{i}: A_{j})\\) to \\((l)_{ij}\\)), (iii) mixing \\(\\Sigma\\) and\n\\(\\Pi\\), and (iv) omitting the \u201c\\(>0\\)\u201d part\u2014have\nbecome official:\n\n\nIn general, according to 1885a [CP 3.393]:\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma_i x_i\\) means that \\(x\\) is true of some one of the\nindividuals noted by \\(i\\) or \n\n   \\[\\Sigma_{i}x_i = x_i + x_j + x_k + \\textit{etc.}\\]\n\n\nIn the same way, \\(\\Pi_i x_i\\) means that \\(x\\) is true of all these\nindividuals, or \n\n     \\[\\Pi_{i}x_i = x_i   x_j   x_k, \\textit{etc.}\\]\n\n\nAnd if \\(x\\) is a simple relation [binary predicate],\n\n \\(\\Pi_i\\Pi_j x_{i,j}\\) means that every \\(i\\) is in this relation\nto every \\(j\\),\n \\(\\Pi_j\\Sigma_i x_{i,j}\\) that every \\(j\\) some \\(i\\) or other is\nin this relation,\n \\(\\Sigma_i\\Sigma_j x_{i,j}\\) that some \\(i\\) is in this relation\nto some \\(j\\).\n \nFor example, according to 1885a [CP 3.394]:\n\n\nLet \\(l_{ij}\\) mean that \\(i\\) is a lover of \\(j\\) and \\(b_{ij}\\) that\n\\(i\\) is a benefactor of \\(j\\).\n\nLet \\(g_i\\) mean that \\(i\\) is a griffin, and \\(c_i\\) that \\(i\\) is a\nchimera.\n\nThen \\(\\Pi_i\\Sigma_j (l)_{ij }(b)_{ij}\\) means that everything is at\nonce a lover and a benefactor of something; and\n\n [I.e., \\(\\forall x \\exists y [\\textit{Lover} (x, y) \\land\n\\textit{Benefactor} (x, y)]\\), meaning that everybody is a lover and a\nbenefactor of someone.]\n\n\nAnd \\(\\Pi_i\\Sigma_j (l)_{ij}(b)_{ji}\\) means that everything is a\nlover of a benefactor of itself.\n\n [I.e., \\(\\forall x \\exists y [\\textit{Lover} (x, y) \\land\n\\textit{Benefactor} (y, x)]\\), meaning that everybody is a lover of a\nbenefactor of himself/herself.]\n \n\n\nAnd we find ourselves arriving at the land of modern logic. At the\nsame time, we realize that the key concepts and vocabulary of\nfirst-order logic were already formed in his previous work discussed\nabove. We also note that the goal outlined in the first section of the\n1885 paper is more or less the same as the proposal made in his 1870\npaper: \u201cThe first is the extension of the power of logical\nalgebra over the whole of its proper realm\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]).\nAlso, he almost reiterates the limit of the project which he\n\u201cregrets\u201d in 1870: \u201cI shall not be able to perfect\nthe algebra sufficiently to give facile methods of reaching logical\nconclusions\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]). That is, we should not expect a\nfull-blown deductive system in this paper, but \u201cI can only give\na method by which any legitimate conclusion may be reached and any\nfallacious one avoided\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]). He carries out his\npromise in section 3 of the paper titled as \u201c\u00a73.\nFirst-intentional logic of\n relatives\u201d,[17]\n by suggesting a list of methods of transformation. He did not mean to\nclaim this list is exhaustive, but \u201cthe one which seems to me\nthe most useful tool on the whole\u201d (1885a [CP 3.396]). The\nfollowing are some of the rules involving\n quantifiers:[18]\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall x  \\phi(x) \\land \\forall y \\phi(y) & = \\forall x\\forall y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\exists x  \\phi(x) \\land \\forall y \\phi(y) & = \\exists  x\\forall y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\exists x  \\phi(x) \\land \\exists y \\phi(y) & = \\exists x\\exists y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall x   \\forall y \\chi(x,y)   & = \\forall y\\forall x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\exists x   \\exists y \\chi(x,y)  & = \\exists  y\\exists x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\forall x   \\exists y (\\phi(x) \\land \\psi(y))  & = \\exists  y\\forall x  (\\phi(x) \\land \\psi(y))\\\\\n\\forall x   \\exists y \\chi(x,y)   & \\not = \\exists  y\\forall x  \\chi(x,y), \\textrm{ but}\\\\ \n\\exists  x\\forall y  \\chi(x,y)   & \\Rightarrow  \\forall y   \\exists x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\exists x   \\forall y \\chi(x,y) = \\exists x   \\forall y (\\chi(x,y)\\land \\chi(x,x))\\]\n\n\nIn spite of the six-year interval between Frege\u2019s\nBegriffsschrift (1879) and Peirce\u2019s quantification\ntheory in 1885, credit has been given to both logicians. We call them\nboth the founders of modern logic, since Peirce was not aware of\nFrege\u2019s work on the topic. Also, it should be noted that Frege\npresented a logical system equipped with axioms and rules, which was\nnot pursued in Peirce\u2019s work.\n1.2 Boolean tradition\u2014algebraic and model-theoretic\n\nBoole\u2019s aspiration to capture logic in terms of an algebraic\nsystem has inspired many mathematicians and logicians who are\ninterested in connecting the two disciplines, logic and mathematics.\nAs seen in the previous section, Peirce is clearly one of them. He\npushed the Boolean idea of an algebraic system further in two ways:\nOne is to improve Boole\u2019s representation of particular\nproposition (i.e., \u201cSome A is B\u201d) so that\ntraditional Aristotelian syllogisms may fit in an algebraic system.\nThe other is to represent not only qualities but also relations so\nthat a new algebraic system may reach beyond traditional syllogisms.\nIn that process, new notations for quantifiers and variables were\ninvented.\n\nPeirce\u2019s two-decade work made a major contribution to the\nalgebra of logic tradition in two important ways. First,\nPeirce\u2019s introduction of quantifiers and variables itself is a\nsignificant advance in formal logic, close to the predicate logic we\nknow. Second, subsequent momentous work on mathematical logic was\nbuilt on the new notation and extended logic by Peirce and his\nstudents, O. H. Mitchell and C. Ladd (later Ladd-Franklin). A decade\nafter Peirce\u2019s \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d, (1885)\nErnst Schr\u00f6der published three volumes of mathematical logic\nVorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n (1890\u20131905).[19]\n His work was carried out squarely in the Boolean algebraic tradition,\nand two important aspects of the book reflect Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence: He adopted Peirce\u2019s notation (over Frege\u2019s),\nand the third volume is devoted to the logic of relations.\nGoldfarb\u2019s insightful paper expresses these two aspects of\nPeirce\u2019s influence in the following way:\n\n\nBuilding on earlier work of Peirce, in the third volume of his\nLectures on the algebra of logic [1895] Schr\u00f6der\ndevelops the calculus of relatives (that is, relations). Quantifiers\nare defined as certain possibly infinite sums and products, over\nindividuals or other relations. (Goldfarb 1979: 354)\n\n\nAs seen in the previous subsection, including relations (not just\nqualities) in algebraic expressions and representing the universal\nquantifier as products (i.e., \\(\\Pi\\)) and the existential quantifier\nas sums (i.e., \\(\\Sigma\\)) were the main output of Peirce\u2019s two\ndecade tireless work. Considering Schr\u00f6der\u2019s book was the\nmost popular logic textbook for mathematical logic students during\nthat era, we can easily say Peirce\u2019s legacy has lived on.\nPeckhaus, working on a delicate relation between Frege\u2019s and\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s quantification theory, locates where\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s modern quantification theory originates from:\n\n\n\nThis [Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der\nLogik was the result of his learning modern quantification from\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift] is a simple and plausible\nanswer, but it is false. Schr\u00f6der never claimed any priority for\nhis quantification theory, but he did not take it from Frege.\nSchr\u00f6der himself gives the credit for his use of \\(\\Sigma\\) and\n\\(\\Pi\\) to Charles S. Peirce and Peirce\u2019s student Oscar Howard\nMitchell (Schr\u00f6der 1891, 120\u2013121). (Peckhaus 2004: 12) \n\nAfterwards well-known mathematicians and logicians, L\u00f6wenheim,\nSkolem and Zermelo, all used Peirce-Schr\u00f6der notation. Peano was\nalso very much familiar with Peirce-Schr\u00f6der algebraic logic.\nPutnam includes Whitehead in this tradition as well:\n\n\nThis [Whitehead\u2019s Universal Algebra] is a work squarely\nin the tradition to which Boole, Schr\u00f6der, and Peirce belonged,\nthe tradition that treated general algebra and logic as virtually one\nsubject. (Putnam 1982: 298)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Putnam points out that this portion of\nWhitehead\u2019s work was prior to his collaboration with Russell,\nand during this early period Whitehead\u2019s work, especially on\nquantifiers, mentions Peirce and his students, but not Frege. Clearly\nwe needed to wait until Russell drew our attention to Frege, but\n\u201cit was Peirce who seems to have been known to the entire world\nlogical community\u201d (Putnam 1982: 297). Putnam\u2019s label of\nthe Peirce group as \u201ceffective\u201d discoverers of the\nquantifier and Frege as a discoverer could be a resolution to the\nFrege-first versus Peirce-first debate.\n\nWhile many have focused on the development of quantifiers, it is quite\nnoteworthy that Tarski drew our attention to the importance of the\nalgebra of relations in his 1941 paper \u201cOn the Calculus of\n Relations\u201d.[20]\n Just as Peirce did in his DNLR (1870) paper, Tarski acknowledges De\nMorgan\u2019s contribution: It is De Morgan who first realized the\nnecessity of representing relations as well as qualities and struggled\nover the limits of traditional logic. And Tarski gives full credit to\nPeirce in terms of solid advance over the calculus of relations.\n\n\nThe title of creator of the theory of relations was reserved for C. S.\nPeirce. In several papers published between 1870 and 1882a, he\nintroduced and made precise all the fundamental concepts of the theory\nof relations and formulated and established its fundamental\nlaws.\u2026In particular, his investigations made it clear that a\nlarge part of the theory of relations can be presented as a calculus\nwhich is formally much like the calculus of classes developed by G.\nBoole and W. S. Jevons, but which greatly exceeds it in richness of\nexpression and is therefore incomparably more interesting from the\ndeductive point of view. (Tarski 1941: 73)\n\n\nThis passage not only situates Peirce\u2019s logical achievement in\nthe context of the algebra of logic tradition but also characterizes\nPeirce\u2019s work as an extension of Boole\u2019s and Jevons\u2019\nmonadic logic. (For more details about Peirce\u2019s position in\nBoole\u2019s tradition, see the entry\n the algebra of logic tradition.)\n \n\nSome Peirce scholars have also claimed that Peirce\u2019s invention\nof quantifiers is a product of Peirce\u2019s own philosophy of logic,\nwhich is different from Frege\u2019s (Brady 1997; Burch 1997; Iliff\n1997; Merrill 1997). Hintikka\u2019s proposal (1997) to explain the\nmain difference between Frege\u2019s and Peirce\u2019s contributions\nto modern logic is quite intriguing. Tracing back to Frege\u2019s own\ndistinction between calculus ratiocinator versus a lingua\ncharacterica, van Heijenoort adds a new dimension to these two\nopposing views of logic beyond what Frege alluded to (van Heijenoort\n1967: footnote 1, p.\n 329).[21]\n While Frege emphasized a difference between propositional and\nquantification logic, van Heijenoort located a difference in what is\ntaken as a totality. Boole\u2019s tradition does not make any\nontological commitment about a totality, but it \u201ccan be changed\nat will\u201d (1967: 325). On the other hand, Frege\u2019s language\nis about the universe. Borrowing van Heijenoort\u2019s\ndistinction between Boole\u2019s logic as a calculus and\nFrege\u2019s universality of logic, Hintikka locates Peirce in\nBoole\u2019s camp, calling it the model-theoretic tradition. Unlike\nFrege\u2019s view of the universe, the model-theoretic tradition\nallows us to reinterpret a language and thus assign different\nuniverses to quantifiers. According to Hintikka, Peirce\u2019s\ndevelopment of modal logic is a good piece of evidence to show how\nfruitful Peirce\u2019s way of understanding quantifiers could be\n(Hintikka 1997). In the next section where Peirce\u2019s graphical\nsystems are introduced, we will revisit this issue.\n2. From Symbolic to Iconic Representation\n\nSo far, we have argued that Peirce\u2019s insight on relations pushed\nhim to extend the territory of logic from monadic,\nnon-relational, propositional logic to polyadic, relational,\nquantification logic. This is the beginning of modern logic as we know\nit. In this section, taking up a different angle of Peirce\u2019s\nadventure\u2014to extend forms of representation from\nsymbolic systems to diagrammatic systems, we present a story\nwhere his two different kinds of extension\u2014one from\nnon-relations to relations and the other from symbolic to\ndiagrammatic\u2014are connected with each other.\n\nPeirce presented propositional logic, quantification logic, and modal\nlogic in a graphical way, and invented three systems of Existential\nGraphs (EG)\u2014Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, respectively. In spite of\nPeirce\u2019s own evaluation of Existential Graphs as \u201cmy chef\nd\u2019oeuvre\u201d, EG had to wait to be understood for a half\ncentury until two philosophers\u2014Don Roberts and Jay\nZeman\u2014produced their impressive work. In the 1980s, EG was\nreceiving attention from new disciplines\u2014computer science and\nartificial intelligence\u2014thanks to John Sowa\u2019s novel\napplication of EG to knowledge representation in Conceptual\nStructure (1984). More recently, toward the end of the twentieth\ncentury interdisciplinary research on multi-modal reasoning has drawn\nour attention to non-symbolic systems (see, e.g., Barwise &\nAllwein [eds] 1996 and Barwise & Etchemendy 1991) and EG, not\nsurprisingly, occupied the top of their list. In that context, Shin\n(2002) focused on differences between symbolic versus diagrammatic\nsystems and suggested a new way of understanding the EG system, though\nthis was criticized in Pietarinen 2006.\n\nWhile Peirce mainly presented linear expressions in his official\nwritings from 1870 to\n 1885,[22]\n the notation adopted in Frege\u2019s 1879 Begriffsschrift\nis more iconic; it is at least not as linear as Peirce\u2019s in the\nabove period. However, it is Peirce, not Frege, who invented a\nfull-blown non-symbolic system for first-order logic\u2014Existential\nGraphs. It is Peirce\u2019s EG, not his linear first-order notation,\nwhich is presented as a deductive system with inference rules. As the\nEG system has been investigated more rigorously, philosophical\nquestions involving Peirce\u2019s invention of the system have been\nraised as well. The discovery of EG\u2019s power and novelty has\nnaturally led us to other parts of Peirce\u2019s philosophy. Why and\nhow did the invention of EG come about? What does EG reveal about\nPeirce\u2019s view of logic and representation?\n\nMany have pointed to Peirce\u2019s theory of signs, which classifies\nsigns as being of three kinds\u2014symbols, indices, and\nicons\u2014as the foremost theoretical background for Peirce\u2019s\n EG.[23]\n For example, as will be shown below, ovals and lines, along with\nletters, are the basic vocabulary of Peirce\u2019s EG. It is natural\nto connect Peirce\u2019s interest in icons with his invention of\ngraphical systems, and the connection is real (Shin 2002:\n22\u201335). However, to pinpoint the features of icons and the\niconic nature of Peirce\u2019s graphical systems requires much more\nwork than our intuition provides. Moreover, there is a big gap between\nPeirce\u2019s discussions of\n icons[24]\n and his invention of full-blown graphical systems; something else has\nto be brought into the picture to explain how Peirce got from his\ninitial ideas about icons all the way to his EG.\n\nIn a slightly different and bigger picture, van Heijenoort\u2019s\ndistinction between Boole\u2019s calculus ratiocinator\nversus Frege\u2019s lingua characteristica could be related\nto the topic. Agreeing with both Hintikka\u2019s and Goldfarb\u2019s\nevaluation that Peirce belongs to Boole\u2019s tradition, Shin finds\na connection between the model-theoretic view of logic (where Boole\nand Peirce are placed) and EG\u2019s birth (see Shin 2002:\n14\u201316 and Pietarinen 2006). However, Peirce\u2019s awareness of\nthe re-interpretation of language is necessary, but not sufficient,\nfor his pursuit of a different form of representation. While the\nacknowledgment of the possibility of different models of a given\nsystem was presupposed by Peirce\u2019s project for various kinds of\nsystems, not every Boolean has presented multiple systems. Boole\nhimself \n\n\nwas quite conscious of the idea of disinterpretaion, of the\nidea of using a mathematical system as an algorithm, transforming the\nsigns purely mechanically without any reliance on meanings. (Putnam\n1982: 294) \n\n\nOn the other hand, Burris and Legris\u2019s entry shows us how\nBoole\u2019s algebra of logic tradition has led us to the development\nof model theory (see the entry on\n the algebra of logic tradition).\n2.1 Pragmatic maxim applied to the logic of relations\n\nWithout challenging these existing explanations involving\nPeirce\u2019s EG, in this entry we would like to bring in one\noverlooked but crucial aspect of Peirce\u2019s journey to EG so that\nour story may fill in part of the puzzle of Peirce\u2019s overall\nphilosophy. Peirce\u2019s mission for a new logic started with how to\nrepresent relations, which led him to invent quantifiers and bound\nvariables, as we discussed in the previous section. The same\ncommitment, that is, to represent relations in a logical system, we\nclaim, was a main motivation behind Peirce\u2019s search for a new\nkind of sign systems\u2014iconic representation of relations.\nPeirce\u2019s work on Euler/Venn diagrams provides us with another\npiece of evidence to support our claim that the main motivation behind\nEG was to represent relations. While improving Venn systems, Peirce\nrealizes that the following defect cannot be eliminated:\n\n\n[T]he system [Venn\u2019s] affords no means of exhibiting reasoning,\nthe gist of which is of a relational or abstractional kind. It does\nnot extend to the logic of relatives. (Peirce 1911b [CP 4.356])\n\n\nAgain, we do not think this is the crucial ingredient for the\ncreation of EG, but one key element which works nicely together with\nhis theory of signs and his model-theoretic view of logic.\n\nPeirce\u2019s graphical representation first appears in his 1897\npaper \u201cThe Logic of Relatives\u201d. After his own new linear\nnotation came out in 1885 as seen above, why did Peirce revisit the\nlogic of relations? The first paragraph of the paper provides a direct\nanswer:\n\n\nI desire to convey some idea of what the new logic is, how two\n\u201calgebras\u201d, that is, systems of diagrammatical\nrepresentation by means of letters and other characters, more or less\nanalogous to those of the algebra of arithmetic, have been invented\nfor the study of the logic of relatives, and\u2026. (1897a [CP\n3.456])\n\n\nTwo things should be noted. One is that diagrammatic systems are also\ncalled \u201calgebra\u201d by Peirce. That is, according to Peirce,\nalgebra is not limited to symbolic systems. The other is that Peirce\nmakes it clear that two different forms of algebra carry out\nthe new logic, not new logics.\n\nIn thinking about the scope of the logic of relations, the question\narises: Why did Pierce feel the need for another form of\nrepresentation different from the 1885 notation? \u201cI must clearly\nshow what a relation is\u201d (1897a [CP 3.456]). The clear\nunderstanding of \u201crelations\u201d, Peirce believes, is a guide\nfor his excursion into different forms of logical systems. Here we\nwould like to draw reader\u2019s attention to Peirce\u2019s\nwell-known paper \u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear \u201d (1878),\nwhere three sections are devoted to the three grades of meaning (see\nthe entry on\n Peirce\u2019s theory of signs).\n\nThe first grade of understanding the word \u201crelation\u201d comes\nfrom our ordinary experience, and the second grade is to have a more\nabstract and general definition-like understanding. According to\nPeirce, that is not enough to achieve a full understanding of the word\n\u201crelation\u201d. Finally, Peirce\u2019s hallmark of the\npragmatic maxim leads us to the third grade of clarity:\n\n\nIt appears, then, the rule for attaining the third grade of clearness\nof apprehension is as follows: Consider what effects, which might\nconceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our\nconception to have. Then the whole of our conception of those effects\nis the whole of our conception of the object. (1878 [CP 5.402])\n\n\nIn order to understand what a relation is, we need to know what\nfollows from it. Then, the question is how we know what its\nconsequences are. Here is one answer given by Peirce in the 1897a\npaper, as far as the term \u201crelation\u201d goes:\n\n\nThe third grade of clearness consists in such a representation of the\nidea that fruitful reasoning can be made to turn upon it, and that it\ncan be applied to the resolution of difficult practical problems.\n(1897a [CP 3.457])\n\n\nTherefore, how a relation is represented is crucial in figuring out\nwhat follows from a relational state of affairs. Better\nrepresentations will yield more \u201cfruitful reasoning\u201d and\nhence, will be more helpful for solving practical problems. It is\nobvious that in the paper Peirce intends to search for more\ndesirable representations. Importantly, in section 4 when the\nthird grade of clearness of the meaning \u201crelation\u201d is\ndiscussed, diagrammatic representation of relations makes its first\nappearance.\n\nInfluenced by A. B. Kempe\u2019s graphic\n representation,[25]\n Peirce finds an analogy between relations and chemical compounds:\n\n\nA chemical atom is quite like a relative in having a definite number\nof loose ends or \u201cunsaturated bonds\u201d, corresponding to the\nblanks of the relative. (1897a [CP 3.469])\n\n\nA chemical molecule consists of chemical atoms, and how atoms are\nconnected with one another is based on the number of loose ends of\neach atom. For example, chemical atom H has one loose end and chemical\natom O has two. So, the following combination is possible, and it is a\nrepresentation of the water molecule, H2O:\n\n\n\n\nAn analogy to the logic of relations runs like this: A sentence\nconsists of names (proper names or indices) and predicates, and each\npredicate has a fixed arity. For example, the predicate\n\u201clove\u201d needs two names and \u201cgive\u201d three.\nHence, the following diagrammatic representation is grammatical and it\nis a representation of the proposition \u201cJohn loves\nMary\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nPeirce created a novel and productive analogy in representation\nbetween chemistry and the logic of relation by adopting the doctrine\nof valency as the key element for the analogy, as shown in the above\ntwo diagrams. Believing that this graphic style of representation\nwould help us conceive the consequences or effects of a given relation\nin a more efficient\n way,[26]\n Peirce presents Entitative Graphs, which is a predecessor of\n EG.[27]\n\nEG keeps the representation of a relation developed here, and remains\nas Peirce\u2019s final and the most cherished notation for the logic\nof relations (1903a). EG consists of three parts, Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, which correspond to propositional, first-order, and modal\nlogic, respectively. After presenting the Alpha system in a formal\nway, we discuss the Beta system of EG focusing on Peirce\u2019s novel\nideas in expanding a propositional graphic system to a\nquantificational graphic system. For more details, we recommend works\non EG by Roberts, Zeman, Sowa, and Shin.\n2.2 Alpha system\n\nPeirce\u2019s Alpha graphs may be drawn on a blackboard, on a\nwhiteboard, or on a sheet of paper. The basic unit is a simple\nsentence without any sentential connectives, that is, negation,\nconjunction, disjunction or conditional, etc. The following is an\nexample of a basic Alpha graph, asserting that it is sunny.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we would like to assert that it is sunny and windy, we juxtapose\ntwo basic Alpha graphs in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make the Alpha Graph Boolean-functionally complete, all we\nneed is to represent negation. The following Alpha graph says that it\nis not the case it is sunny, by enclosing the above graph with a\ncut:\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have negation and conjunction, it is important to keep the\norder in the right way. \u201cIt is not sunny and it is not\nwindy\u201d is different from \u201cIt is not the case that it is\nsunny and windy\u201d. Hence, the sentence \u201cIt is not the case\nthat it is sunny and it is windy\u201d is ambiguous, depending on the\nscope of \u201cit is not the case\u201d. In the case of sentential\nlogic, parentheses get in to prevent this ambiguity: \\(\\neg (S \\land\nW)\\) versus \\(\\neg S \\land W\\). Peirce\u2019s warning follows:\n\n\nThe interpretation of existential graphs is endoporeutic,\nthat is proceeds inwardly; so that a nest sucks the meaning from\nwithout inwards unto its centre, as a sponge absorbs water. (Peirce\n1910a: 18, Ms 650)\n\n\nHence, the following Alpha graph should be read not as\n\u201c\\(\\neg P \\land \\neg Q\\)\u201d, but as \u201c\\(\\neg(P\n\\land \\neg Q)\\)\u201d:\n\n\n\n\nThis way of understanding Alpha Graphs is not incorrect, but has given\na wrong impression that the Alpha system is equivalent to a sentential\nsystem with two connective symbols, negation and conjunction. We all\nprefer having more connectives than these two, especially when we use\nthe language. The section explores an alternative reading of Alpha\ndiagrams, beyond negation and conjunction only, without introducing\nany new syntactic device.\n\nBelow we introduce Alpha Graphs as a formal system equipped with its\nsyntax and semantics. These tools not being available to Peirce, the\npresentation aims to show Peirce\u2019s EG is not intrinsically\ndifferent from other formal systems. At the same time, in order to\nplace Peirce\u2019s graphical systems in the traditional\nwell-developed discourse of logic, there will be an intermediate\nstage, that is, to read off Peirce\u2019s graphs into symbolic\nlanguage. This will make Peirce\u2019s graphs more accessible, and at\nthe same time support our claim that Peirce extended forms of\nrepresentations with the same scope of logic as symbolic\nrepresentation.\nSyntax\nVocabulary\n\nSentence symbols: \\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\)\u2026\n\n\nCut\n\n\n \n\nWell-formed diagrams\n\nAn empty space is a well-formed diagram.\nA sentence symbol is a well-formed diagram.\nIf \\(D\\) is a well-formed diagram, then so is a single cut of\n\\(D\\) (we write \u201c\\([D]\\)]\u201d).\nIf \\(D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{2}\\) are well-formed diagrams, then so is\nthe juxtaposition of \\(D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{2}\\) (write \u201c\\(D_{1}\\\nD_{2}\\)\u201d).\nNothing else is a well-formed diagram.\n\n\nHere we present two equivalent reading methods for the system. The\nEndoporeutic reading algorithm, formalized based on Peirce\u2019s own\nsuggestion (as quoted above), is a traditional way to understand EG.\nAn alternative reading method, the Multiple reading algorithm, was\nmore recently presented to approach EG in a more efficient\n way.[28]\nEndoporeutic Reading Algorithm\n\nIf \\(D\\) is an empty space, then it is translated into\n\\(\\top\\).\nIf \\(D\\) is a sentence letter, say \\(A_{i}\\), then it is\ntranslated into \\(A_{i}\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D\\) is \\(\\alpha\\). Then, \\([D]\\) is\ntranslated into \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\).\n\n\nSuppose the translation of \\(D_{1}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) and the\ntranslation of \\(D_{2}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{2}\\).\n\nThen, the translation of \\(D_{1}\\ D_{2}\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1} \\land\n\\alpha_{2})\\).\n\nMultiple Readings Algorithm\n\nIf \\(D\\) is an empty space, then it is translated into\n\\(\\top\\).\nIf \\(D\\) is a sentence letter, say \\(A_{i}\\), then it is\ntranslated into \\(A_{i}\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D\\) is \\(\\alpha\\). Then,\n\\([D]\\) is translated into \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D_{1}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{1}\\)\nand the translation of \\(D_{2}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{2}\\).\n\n\nthe translation of \\(D_{1} D_{2}\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1}\n\\land \\alpha_{2})\\),\nthe translation of \\([D_{1} D_{2}]\\) is\n\\((\\neg\\alpha_{1} \\lor \\neg \\alpha_{2})\\),\nthe translation of \\([D_{1}\\ [D_{2}]]\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1}\n\\rightarrow \\alpha_{2})\\), and\nthe translation of \\([[D_{1}]\\ [D_{2}]]\\) is\n\\((\\alpha_{1} \\lor \\alpha_{2})\\).\n\n\n\nEach of these two readings has its own \n strength.[29]\n The Endopreutic\nreading assures us that the Alpha system is truth-functionally\ncomplete, since it has power to express conjunction and negation.\nHowever, this traditional method has been partly responsible for the\nfollowing two incorrect judgments about Alpha graphs: \n\n There is not much difference between the Alpha system and a\npropositional language with only two connectives, \\(\\land\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\), except that Alpha graphs have cuts instead of symbolic\nconnectives. \n When it comes down to practical use, just as we do not want to\nuse only two connectives in a language, we have no reason to adopt the\nAlpha system over propositional languages with more connectives.\n\n\nChallenging these misconceptions, the Multiple readings algorithm\nshows that Alpha diagrams do not have to be read off as a sentence\nwith \u201c\\(\\land\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\neg\\)\u201d only, but can\nbe directly read off in terms of other connectives as well. Two\nquestions may be raised: \n\n Is there a redundancy in the Multiple readings method? For\nexample, is\n clause 4(b)\n above dispensable in terms of\n clause 3\n and\n clause 4(a)?\n \n Does this new reading show that the Alpha system is just like a\npropositional language with various connectives?\n\n\nLet us answer these questions through the following example.\nExample\n\nThe following graph is translated into the following four\nformulas:\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\\(\\neg(\\neg R \\land \\neg S)\\)\nEndoporeutic Reading \n\n2.\n\\(R \\lor S\\)\n4(d)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n3.\n\\(\\neg R \\rightarrow S\\)\n3\n and\n 4(c)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n4.\n\\(\\neg\\neg R\\lor \\neg\\neg S\\)\n3\n and\n 4(b)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n\n\nThe Endoporeutic reading allows us to get the first reading only, but\nwe may obtain different sentences by the Multiple Readings. Of course,\nall of these sentences are logically equivalent. Here is an\ninteresting point: In the case of symbolic systems, we need to prove\nthe equivalence among the above sentences by using inference rules.\nBut, derivation processes are dispensable in the case of the Alpha\nsystem when the Multiple readings are\n adopted.[30]\n Hence, having the\n clause 4(b)\n above in addition to\n clause 3\n and\n clause 4(a)\n is not redundant, but instead highlights a fundamental difference\nbetween the Alpha system and a symbolic language with various\nconnectives (see Shin 2002: \u00a7\u00a74.3.2, 4.4.4, and 4.5.3).\n\nSince we have the semantics for propositional logic and our reading\nmethods translate Alpha diagrams into a propositional language, we can\nlive without the direct semantics. However, if one insists on the\ndirect semantics:\nSemantics\n\nLet \\(v\\) be a truth function such that it assigns t or f to each\nsentence letter and t to an empty space. Now, we extend this function\nto \\(\\overline{v}\\) as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(\\overline{v}(D) = v(D)\\) if \\(D\\) is a sentence symbol or an empty\nspace. \n\n\n\\(\\overline{v} ( {\\bf [}D{\\bf ]})\\) = t iff \\(\\overline{v}(D)\\) =\nf. \n\n\n\\(\\overline{v}(D_{1} D_{2})\\) = t iff \\(\\overline{v}(D_{1}) =\\)t and\n\\(\\overline{v}(D_{2})\\) = t. \n\n\nWe also would like to emphasize that this is not the only way to\napproach Peirce\u2019s EG. For example, some claim that\ngame-theoretic semantics were foreshadowed by Peirce, and thus argue\nfor a more dynamic understanding of EG from the game-theoretic point\nof view (Burch 1994; Hilpinen 1982; Hintikka 1997; Pietarinen\n2006).\n\nPeirce makes it clear his EG is a deductive system equipped with\ninference rules:\n\n\nThe System of Existential Graphs is a certain class of\ndiagrams upon which it is permitted to operate certain\ntransformations. (1903a [CP 4.414])\n\n\nThe inference rules for the Alpha system are presented as follows:\n(1903a [CP\n 4.415])[31]\n\n\nCode of Permissions\n\nPermission No. 1.

In\n \u00a72.1,\n we established a connection between Peirce\u2019s own pragmatic\nmaxim and his graphic representation of relations. Peirce did not aim\nto present a new logic by inventing a graphic system, but rather to\npresent another new notation for the logic carried out by quantifiers\nand bound variables. He almost took it for granted that a graphic\nrepresentation of relations helps us observe their consequences in a\nmore efficient way. Hence, the Beta system may be considered to be the\nfinal stop of Peirce\u2019s long journey to search for better\nnotation for the logic of relations, which started in 1870 at the\n latest.[34]\n\nWe will not go into the formal details of the Beta system in this\nentry but will instead refer to Chapter 5 of Shin, where three\nslightly different approaches to Beta graphs\u2014Zeman\u2019s,\nRoberts\u2019, and Shin\u2019s\u2014are discussed at a full length.\nWhile Zeman\u2019s reading is comprehensive and formal,\nRoberts\u2019 method seems to appeal to a more intuitive\nunderstanding of the system. Taking advantage of the merits of these\ntwo existing works, Shin developed a new reading method of Beta graphs\nand reformulated the transformation rules of the\n system.[35]\n Her approach focuses on visual features of Beta graphs and highlights\nfundamental differences between symbolic versus diagrammatic systems.\nIn the remaining part of the entry, we would like to examine how the\nessence of the logic of relations is graphically represented in the\nBeta system so that the reader may place EG in the larger context of\nPeirce\u2019s enterprise.\n\nThe introduction of quantifiers and bound variables is believed to be\none of the key steps of first-order logic in symbolic systems. This is\nwhy some logicians take Peirce\u2019s 1885 paper \u201cOn the\nAlgebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of Notations\u201d\nto be the birthplace of modern logic. If this is the case, then how\ndoes Peirce represent quantifiers and bound variables in Beta\ngraphs?\n\nInterestingly enough, when Peirce considered a graphic system his\nfirst concern was representation of relations, not representation of\nquantifiers. As we said in \u00a73.1, Peirce presented diagrammatic\nrepresentation based on an analogy to chemical molecules for a full\nunderstanding of relations. Hence, the arity of a predicate is\nrepresented by the number of lines radiating from the predicate term.\nNext, Peirce extends the use of a line to connect predicates:\n\n\nIn many reasonings it becomes necessary to write a copulative\nproposition in which two members relate to the same individual so as\nto distinguish these members.\u2026 [I]t is necessary that the signs\nof them should be connected in fact. No way of doing this can be more\nperfectly iconic than that exemplified in [the following graph]:\n\n\n\n\n(1903b [CP 4.442])\n\n\nThe line connecting two predicates, representing one and the\nsame object, is called a line of identity by Peirce.\nThat is, the sameness is represented visually in Beta\n diagrams.[36]\n In the case of a symbolic language, we may adopt one and the same\nquantified variable-type to represent the identity. For example, the\nabove diagram says \\(\\exists x(x <A \\ \\land \\ B < x)\\), and\nhence, the variable-type \\(x\\) (roughly) corresponds to the identity\nline. However, the same variable-type is not sufficient for expressing\nthe sameness in other cases, e.g., \\(\\exists x(x <A \\ \\land \\ B\n< x) \\rightarrow \\exists x (x < C)\\).\n\nThe way universal and existential statements are represented in the\nBeta system highlights a difference between graphic and symbolic\nsystems. Rather than adopting one more syntactic device for\nquantification, Peirce relies on the following visual features:\n\n\n[A]ny line of identity whose outermost part is evenly enclosed refers\nto something, and any one whose outermost part is\noddly enclosed refers to anything there may be.\n(1903b [CP\n 4.458][37])\n\n\nLet us borrow the two following graphs from Roberts (1973:\n 51):[38]\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph (where the outermost part of the line is evenly, zero,\nenclosed) says that something good is ugly, and the second graph\n(where the outermost part is enclosed once) says that everything good\nis\n ugly.[39]\n\nHow about the scope problem which arises when multiple quantifiers are\nused? In the case of a symbolic system, the linear order takes care of\nthe problem. Peirce\u2019s solution for EG is to read off another\nkind of visuality: The less enclosed the outermost part of a line is,\nthe larger the scope that the line gets.\n\nRoberts\u2019 following example illustrates the scope matter nicely\n(1973: 52):\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph says  \n\n\\[\\forall x (\\textit{Catholic}(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y [\\textit{Adores} (x,y) \\land \\textit{Woman}(y)])\\]\n\n\nand the second  \n\n\\[\\exists y (\\textit{Woman}(y) \\land  \\forall x [\\textit{Catholic}(x) \\rightarrow  \\textit{Adores} (x,y)]).\\]\n\n\nIn the first graph, the line whose outermost part is oddly enclosed is\nless enclosed than the line whose outermost part is evenly enclosed.\nTherefore, the universal quantifier has larger scope than the\nexistential quantifier. In the second graph, it is the other way\naround.\n\nLet us summarize three interesting features of the Beta system:\n\n\n\nRelations are represented graphically, not symbolically, in the Beta\nsystem, in terms of a line. We argued that ultimately Peirce\u2019s\npragmatic maxim was behind this alternative way of\nrepresentation.\n\n\nA distinction between universal versus existential statements is\nrepresented by the visual fact about whether the outermost part of a\nline lies in an area enclosed either by an odd number or by even\nnumber of cuts.\n\n\nThe order of quantification is represented by the following visuality:\nThe less enclosed a line is, the more extensive scope it has.\n\n3. From Bivalent to Triadic Logic\n\nFisch and Turquette (1966) discovered three crucial pages out of\nPeirce\u2019s Logic Notebook (1865\u20131909, Ms\n 339).[40]\n This shows that Peirce\u2019s invention of three-valued sentential\nlogic predates by at least a decade Jan Lukasiewicz\u2019s and Emil\nPost\u2019s achievements on the same topic. The three pages contain\nthe essential elements of triadic logic and an intriguing passage\nabout Peirce\u2019s motivation behind triadic logic. If we put\nPeirce\u2019s development of triadic logic in contemporary terms,\nPeirce seemed to be branching out to non-standard logic. If so, this\nadventure would be qualitatively different from the other two we have\njust discussed in the previous sections.\n\nWhen Peirce developed relational logic, the territory of formalization\nwas vastly expanded. New vocabulary, hence, new syntactic rules and\nsemantic rules, were added. Naturally we welcome the territory of\nformalization and, hence, theoretical justification is not needed.\nFrom sentential to relational logic\u2014this is an extension in a\nliteral sense: We do not discard the previous results\u2014hence they\nare preserved\u2014but all we do is to expand them.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of extension to non-symbolic languages,\nthe logic itself stays the same, without addition or subtraction, but\na new form of representation is introduced. That is, what to represent\nis not extended, but how to represent is. Some might not see the need\nfor various forms of representation, and might not be convinced of the\nnecessity of graphical systems. Nonetheless, at a theoretical level,\nPeirce\u2019s EG does not demand lengthy theoretical justification.\nIn some sense, the proof is in the pudding: Can this new graphical\nsystem carry out the same task as existing symbolic systems do? If so,\nwhich system is easier to use? Which system is more efficient? We\nmight not arrive at a clean consensus, but the discussions are more or\nless predictable.\n\nHowever, when one more semantic value is added to T (true) and\nF (false), logic is not preserved any more. When semantics is\nextended or changed, the new logic is neither a monotonic expansion of\nthe territory of logic nor an alternative syntactic form of\nrepresentation to existing symbolic systems. Triadic logic, by\nintroducing one more semantic value, departs from the standard logic\nwhich is based on bivalence. Here, the status of the principle of\nexcluded middle (\u201cQ or not-Q\u201d) is shaken. So\nis the law of contradiction. It is the burden of any non-standard\nlogic to justify its being non-standard: Why the third value? What is\nthe third value? Unknown? If so, is it an epistemological issue?\nIndeterminate? If so, does this require a metaphysical\nexplanation?\n\nThe first subsection summarizes Peirce\u2019s calculus of triadic\nlogic and the second briefly discusses Peirce\u2019s own motive for\ntriadic logic.\n3.1 Truth table of a three-valued system\n\nThree values, V, L, and F, are introduced, where\nV is true, L indeterminate, and F false. The\ntraditional semantic domain for sentential logic, true and false, is\nextended to include \u201cindeterminate\u201d. Based on this\nextended semantic territory, Peirce presents the semantics of several\nsentential operators, one unary and the others binary. Modifying\nPeirce\u2019s presentation slightly to make it more similar to our\nconventional truth table style without changing content, we present\nthe three operators\u2019 truth tables.\n\nThe semantics of a unary operator, which corresponds to negation:\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(\\bar{x}\\)  \n\n\nV\nF \n\nL\nL \n\nF\nV  \n\n\nThe semantics for six binary connectives is presented:\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(y\\)\n\\(\\Phi(x, y)\\)\n\\(\\Theta(x, y)\\)\n\\(\\Psi(x, y)\\)\n\\(Z(x, y)\\)\n\\(\\Omega(x, y)\\)\n\\(\\Gamma(x, y)\\)  \n\n\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV \n\nL\nV\nV\nV\nV\nL\nL\nL \n\nF\nV\nV\nV\nF\nF\nF\nV \n\nV\nL\nV\nV\nV\nL\nL\nL \n\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL \n\nF\nL\nF\nL\nF\nF\nL\nL \n\nV\nF\nV\nV\nF\nF\nF\nV \n\nL\nF\nF\nL\nF\nF\nL\nL \n\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF  \n\n\nWhy six? What is the rationale behind the semantics of these\nconnectives? One way to understand them is to figure out a dominance\nhierarchy among the three values.\n\nIn the case of \\(\\Phi\\),\n\nif at least one is V, then \\(\\Phi(x, y)\\) is V,\nelse if at least one is F, then \\(\\Phi(x, y)\\) is F,\nand\nelse \\(\\Phi(x, y)\\) is L.\n\n\nThat is, V is the most dominant, F next, and L is\nthe least.\n\nSix patterns of hierarchy emerges:\n\n \n\n\n\n\\(\\Phi\\)\nV \\(>\\) F \\(>\\) L \n\n\\(\\Theta\\)\nV \\(>\\) L \\(>\\) F \n\n\\(\\Psi\\)\nF \\(>\\) V \\(>\\) L \n\n\\(Z\\)\nF \\(>\\) L \\(>\\) V \n\n\\(\\Omega\\)\nL \\(>\\) F \\(>\\) V \n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\nL \\(>\\) V \\(>\\) F  \n\n\nPeirce\u2019s \\(\\Theta\\) is our familiar disjunction and\nPeirce\u2019s Z conjunction.\n3.2 Why the third value?\n\nIn Peirce\u2019s own words:\n\n\nTriadic Logic is that logic, which though not rejecting entirely the\nPrinciple of Excluded Middle, nevertheless recognizes that every\nproposition, S is P, is either true or false, or else\nhas a lower mode of being such that it can neither be determinately\nP, nor determinately not-P, but is at the limit between\nP and not P. (Ms 339, copied from Fisch & Turquette\n1966: 75)\n\n\nWhen do we have value L (indeterminate) for the proposition\n\u201cS is P\u201d? Sometimes S, Peirce says,\nhas a lower mode of being P and is at the limit between\nP and not P. The crux of the matter is how to interpret\nthe two phrases\u2014\u201clower mode of being P\u201d and\n\u201cbeing at the limit between P and not P\u201d.\nExisting literature offers two different explanations\u2014modality\nversus continuity.\n\nFisch and Turquette, upon the discovery of Peirce\u2019s notes on\ntriadic logic, locate the root of indeterminacy in potentiality. That\nis, indeterminacy is the semantic value assigned to an unrealized\nsituation; hence, we can say neither \u201cS is\nP\u201d nor \u201cS is not P\u201d at this\npoint. Potentiality, according to this view, cannot be captured by\ndyadic logic. If so, Peirce\u2019s triadic logic is directly related\nto modality talk, which Fisch and Turquette conclude:\n\n\nEssentially, Peirce seems to be saying that triadic logic may be\ninterpreted as a modal logic which is designed to deal with the\nindeterminacies resulting from that mode of being which Peirce has\ncalled \u201cPotentiality\u201d and \u201cReal Possibility\u201d.\nUnder such an interpretation, dyadic logic becomes a limiting case of\ntriadic modal logic resulting from removing indeterminacy and being\ndetermined entirely by \u201cActuality\u201d. (Fisch & Turquette\n1966: 79)\n\n\nAccording to the modality interpretation, Peirce\u2019s \u201clower\nmode of being P\u201d means P not being actual, and\nPeirce\u2019s third value L, being potential, is \u201cat the\nlimit between P (i.e., T) and not P (i.e.,\nF)\u201d. Later in the paper, suggesting a possible relation\nbetween Peirce\u2019s triadic logic and MacColl\u2019s implication\n(as opposed to material implication), the authors make an interesting\nremark: \n\n\nConsidering MacColl\u2019s rejection of Russell\u2019s material\nimplication, it is interesting to notice also that MacColl\u2019s\n\u201cDef. 13\u201d gives what is now called \u201cC. I.\nLewis\u2019s strict implication\u201d. (Fisch & Turquette 1966:\n83) \n\n\nEven though the connection was not pursued further in their paper, one\ncannot help realizing that their modality interpretation is boosted by\na relation to MacColl\u2019s implication since C. I. Lewis\u2019\nstrict implication is a beginning of modal logic. However, equating\nPeirce\u2019s triadic logic with modal logic, the modality view needs\nto explain the relation between Peirce\u2019s Gamma graph lecture in\n1903c (which is about\nmodality) and the triadic logic notes written in 1909 ([Ms 339] 340v, 341v, 344r).  Modal logic explored in Gamma\ngraphs is the extension of classical logic, which required new\nvocabulary, e.g., broken cuts and tincture. Modal logic does not have\nto be non-standard. On the other hand, triadic logic does not add any\nvocabulary, but brings in different interpretations, and becomes\nnon-standard logic. On a slightly different note, Fisch and\nTurquette\u2019s suggests Peirce\u2019s tychism (the view that\nindeterminacy is part of the reality) as a motivation for\nPeirce\u2019s invention of triadic logic. If so, Peirce\u2019s\ntriadic logic is a reflection of his own metaphysics.\n\nChallenging the modality view, Robert Lane proposes the continuity\ninterpretation for Peirce\u2019s triadic logic. According to Lane,\nPeirce\u2019s indeterminate value L has nothing to do with\nmodality, hence, Peirce\u2019s development of triadic logic is not\nanother mechanism for modal logic, but with Peirce\u2019s\nsynechism\u2014the doctrine \u201cthat all that exists is\ncontinuous\u201d (c. 1897b [CP 1.172])! How does Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophy of continuity justify the third value?\n\nFirst, Lane makes a distinction between the principle of excluded\nmiddle (PEM, henceforth) being false with regard to a\nproposition and PEM not being applied to a proposition. If\nPEM is true or false, it means the principle is applied to it. And,\nLane claims that PEM is applied to only non-general and non-modal\npropositions, citing the following passages from Peirce:\n\n\nanything is general in so far as the principle of excluded\nmiddle does not apply to it and is vague in so far as the\nprinciple of contradiction does not apply to it. (1905: 488 [CP\n5.448])\n\nan assertion is said to be made in \u201cthe mode of necessity\u201d\nif, and only if, the affirmation and the denial that [sic] which is so\nasserted could conceivably be both alike false. Thus if a\nperson says \u201cIt will certainly rain tomorrow\u201d, it\nmay be alike false that it is certain to rain and that it is certain\nnot to rain. (1910b: 26\u201328, Ms 678)\n\n\nIf a proposition is either general or expresses necessity, PEM is not\nfalse, but is not applied. Hence, focusing on individual and non-modal\npropositions, Lane draws our attention to a special nature of a\npredicate in L-propositions. Lane calls the kind of the\nproperty which results in L-propositions a\n\u201cboundary-property\u201d. Here is Peirce\u2019s own example of\na boundary-property:\n\n\nThus, a blot is made on the sheet. Then every point of the sheet is\nunblackened or blackened. But there are points on the boundary line,\nand those points are insusceptible of being unblackened or of being\nblackened, since these predicates refer to the area about S and a line\nhas no area about any point of it. (Ms 339: 344r, quoted in Lane 1999:\n294)\n\n\nThose points on the boundary line are neither black nor non-black.\nConsider the propositions \u201cPoint O is black\u201d and\n\u201cPoint O is not black\u201d (where point O is on\nthe boundary line of a black blot). Neither of them is true, but\nfalse, either. These are prime examples of Peirce\u2019s\nL-proposition. Using Peirce\u2019s own truth-tables in the\nprevious subsection, let\u2019s compute the truth value of\n\u201cPoint O is black or point O is not\nblack\u201d.\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be the value of \u201cPoint O is black\u201d,\nwhich is L.\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(\\bar{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(\\Theta(\\alpha, \\bar{\\alpha})\\)  \n\n\nL\nL\nL  \n\n\nNote that PEM is applied, but not true, period.\n\nLane\u2019s following conclusion would be welcomed by many Peirce\nscholars:\n\n\n[B]oundary-propositions were important to Peirce because continuity\nwas important to him;\u2026this [the thought that an actual\nbreach of continuity possesses neither of the properties that are the\nboundary properties relative to that breach] led him to think that\nboundary-propositions are neither true nor false. To accommodate such\npropositions, and thus the phenomenon of continuity, within the bounds\nof formal reasoning, was, I contend, the motivation behind\nPeirce\u2019s experiments in triadic logic. (Lane 1999: 304)\n\n\nRegardless of endorsement of the continuity talk, some might not\nwelcome metaphysics getting into logic. Moreover, if Peirce\u2019s\nsynechism is not embraced, Peirce\u2019s triadic logic, which Lane\nargues is an attempt to formalize the continuity phenomenon, might\nlose its force.\n\nThe previous two sections showed that Peirce\u2019s relational logic\nand graphical systems push us further both in what we do with logic\nand how we do logic so that we may formalize more and we may formalize\nin more diverse ways. Triadic logic, as explained at the beginning of\nthis section, is neither just a monotonic extension to get further nor\nan alternative to get to the same place. By extending semantic\nentities, we have a different logic, for example, PEM being not true.\nThat is why we call triadic logic a non-standard logic. However,\nPeirce\u2019s way of introducing the third value gives us some pause.\nFirst of all, unlike with contemporary triadic logic, Peirce does not\ndiscard PEM completely:\n\n\nTriadic Logic\u2026not rejecting entirely the Principle of Excluded\nMiddle,\u2026 (Ms 339: 344r, copied from Fisch & Turquette 1966:\n75)\n\nI do not say that the Principle of Excluded Middle is downright\nfalse; (1909: 21\u201322 [NEM 3/2: 851], quoted in Fisch\n& Turquette 1966: 81)\n\n\nFor certain (not all) properties, because of the way things are, we\nfind ourselves caught at limits between clearly P and clearly\nnon-P. If we want to formalize those cases as well, the third\nvalue, L, is needed to express the indeterminacy of boundary\ncases. Hence, Peirce himself does not think triadic logic is a new\nlogic, but an addition or extension of the existing dyadic logic:\n\n\nThe recognition [that there is an intermediate ground between\npositive assertion and positive negation which is\njust as Real as they are] does not involve any denial of existing\nlogic, but it involves a great addition to it. (1909: 21\u201322 [NEM\n3/2: 851], quoted in Fisch & Turquette 1966: 81)\n\n\nIf we accept Peirce\u2019s suggestion literally, his triadic logic is\nnot a typical form of non-standard logic but Peirce\u2019s another\nway to extend the territory of logic, along with his relational\nlogic.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
