    "main_text": "\n\nPaul Ricoeur (1913\u20132005) is a distinguished French philosopher\nof the twentieth century, one whose work has been widely translated\nand discussed across the world. In addition to his academic work, his\npublic presence as a social and political commentator, particularly in\nFrance, led to a square in Paris being named in his honor on the\ncentenary of his birth in 2013. In the course of his long career he\nwrote on a broad range of issues. In addition to his many books,\nRicoeur published more than 500 essays, many of which appear in\ncollections in English. The Ricoeur Archive in Paris has made many of\nthose originally published in French available online through its\nwebsite.\n\nA major theme that runs through Ricoeur\u2019s writings is that of a\nphilosophical anthropology. Ricoeur came to formulate this as the idea\nof the \u201ccapable human being\u201d. With it he seeks to give an\naccount of the fundamental capabilities and vulnerabilities that human\nbeings display in the activities that make up their lives, and to show\nhow these capabilities enable responsible human action and life\ntogether. Though the accent is always on the possibility of\nunderstanding human beings as agents responsible for their actions,\nRicoeur consistently rejects any claim that the self is immediately\ntransparent to itself or fully master of itself. Self-knowledge only\ncomes through our understanding of our relation to the world and of\nour life with and among others in time in the world.\n\nIn the course of developing this anthropology, Ricoeur made several\nmajor methodological shifts, partly in response to changes in his\nintellectual setting as new developments came to speak to the topics\nhe was dealing with, sometimes in ways that challenged his own\napproach, partly as he pursued questions that had arisen as a result\nof his published work or that had not yet been considered there. His\nearly academic training was in the tradition of French reflexive\nphilosophy, a tradition that seeks to understand how the\n\u201cI\u201d comes to be aware of itself and of its thought and\naction starting from the lived experience of reflexive consciousness,\nour being aware of ourselves as existing, thinking, and acting. This\nfocus on reflexive consciousness always played a role in organizing\nRicoeur\u2019s thinking. His first major publications after World War\nII, though, were written using existential phenomenology and the\nFrench tradition of reflexive philosophy, reflecting not just his\nstudy of Husserl, which had begun prior to World War II but also of\nKarl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty. By 1960, however, Ricoeur had concluded that to study\nhuman reality properly, particularly given the existence of evil, he\nhad to combine phenomenological description and analysis with\nhermeneutic interpretation. This shift led to an increasing focus on a\ntheory of interpretation that could be grafted to phenomenology, an\napproach which he came to see was in fact called for by phenomenology.\nFor this hermeneutic phenomenology, whatever is intelligible comes to\nus in and through our use of language to talk about our lived\nexperience. While philosophical language and the categories it uses\nalways aim at being founded on univocal concepts, as actually used\nlanguage is always polysemic; it can have more than one meaning, more\nthan one translation, so all uses of language necessarily call for\ninterpretation. This hermeneutic or linguistic turn in Ricoeur\u2019s\nthought did not require him to disavow the basic results of his\nearlier investigations. It did, however, lead him not only to revisit\nthat work but also to see more clearly its broader implications,\nparticularly in relation to and in response to the development of\nstructuralism which he saw as a challenge to such a hermeneutic\napproach. In his later work, this led to an increasing emphasis on the\nfact that we live in time and in history. He took up this insight\nthrough the philosophy of discourse that he developed on the basis of\nthe increased emphasis on language in his philosophy. His late\nwritings also reflect a more direct concern for making sense of\nselfhood and personal identity as something that goes beyond the\nepistemological subject, and for ethics at the individual as well as\nthe societal and political levels, leading to his essays on the idea\nof the just and his last book on the possibility of mutual recognition\nand states of peace.\n",
