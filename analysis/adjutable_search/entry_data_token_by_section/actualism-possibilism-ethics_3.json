    "main_text": "Possibilism || The Crux of the Debate\n2.1 The Crux of the Debate\n\nSuppose someone is trying to determine whether she is obligated to\nteach a summer school course that students would greatly benefit from,\nbut only if taught well. Do facts about how an agent would teach the\ncourse (e.g., well or poorly) have any role in determining whether she\nis morally obligated to teach the course? Actualists answer in the\naffirmative and possibilists in the negative. Possibilists hold that\nthe deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends on facts about how an\nagent could act were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to\npossibilists, what determines whether she should teach the summer\nschool course is whether she could teach it well,\nirrespective of whether she would teach it well. Actualists,\nby contrast, hold that the deontic status of an act \\(\\phi\\) depends,\nin part, on facts about how an agent would act (under certain\nconditions) were she to \\(\\phi\\). So, according to actualists, roughly\nwhat matters in determining whether one should teach the summer school\ncourse is whether she would teach it well, irrespective of\nwhether she could teach it well.\n",
