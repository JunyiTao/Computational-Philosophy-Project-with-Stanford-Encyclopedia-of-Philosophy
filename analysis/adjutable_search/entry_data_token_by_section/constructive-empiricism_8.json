    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || Empirical Adequacy versus Truth\n2.2 Empirical Adequacy versus Truth\n\nSo how might one argue for constructive empiricism? One argument for\nconstructive empiricism hinges on the fact that belief in the\nempirical adequacy of a theory is less epistemically audacious than\nbelief in the truth of the theory. Both beliefs, of course, go beyond\nthe evidence:\n\nIn either case we stick our necks out: empirical adequacy goes far\nbeyond what we can know at any given time. (All the results of\nmeasurement are not in; they will never all be in; and in any case, we\nwon\u2019t measure everything that can be measured.) (van Fraassen\n1980, 69)\n\n\nSo why is belief that a theory is empirically adequate preferable to\nthe belief that the theory is true? Van Fraassen famously and pithily\nputs the point as follows:\n\n\nit is not an epistemological principle that one might as well hang for\na sheep as for a lamb. (1980, 73)\n\n\nThe constructive empiricist rejects arguments that suggest that one is\nrationally obligated to believe in the truth of a theory, given that\none believes in the empirical adequacy of the theory.\n\nFor this epistemological argument to work, the distinction between\nempirical adequacy and truth has to be well-founded. A significant\npart of The Scientific Image is devoted to that task. As\ndescribed in Section 1.6, the constructive empiricist argues that one\ncan make sense of the observable/unobservable distinction, even if\nobservation is theory-laden. (If the distinction between observables\nand unobservables didn\u2019t make sense, the concept of empirical\nadequacy would be incoherent.)\n\nRosen (1994, 161\u2013163), as well as Monton and van Fraassen (2003,\n407\u2013408), offers an additional rationale for the constructive\nempiricist\u2019s embrace of empirical adequacy rather than truth as\nthe hallmark of the belief component of theory acceptance. One might\nreasonably think of belief in the empirical adequacy of accepted\ntheories as the weakest attitude one can attribute to scientists at\nthe same time that one is still able to make sense of their scientific\nactivity. At the same time, belief in the empirical adequacy of a\ntheory is sufficiently cautious as to allow the believer to remain\nfaithful to the spirit of empiricism. Thus, constructive empiricism is\na view which allows one to regard the activity of science as activity\nthe empiricist can safely endorse.\nBelief in empirical adequacy as too strong a criterion for acceptance?\n\nOne worry for the constructive empiricist is that theory acceptance\ncan be had under conditions that do not require belief in the\nempirical adequacy of the accepted theories. As Healey 2019 points\nout, scientists appreciate that many of our best scientific theories\nare not able properly to account for all the observable phenomena they\nare meant to account for; the theories are not, in fact, entirely\nempirically adequate. Scientists nevertheless accept those theories:\nthey treat them as working hypotheses to use in the undertaking of\ntheir work, and (as van Fraassen 1980, 88, suggests) the scientists\nare committed to confronting new empirical phenomena in the framework\nthose theories offer. If, then, we understand theory acceptance in the\nway the constructive empiricist does, we must take the scientists\u2019\nacceptance of these theories as misplaced, since the scientists do not\nbelieve the theories to be empirically adequate.\n\nOne initial response the constructive empiricist might offer to this\nchallenge is the following: if the scientists truly believe the\ntheories to be empirically inadequate, they are not actually accepting\nthe theories, after all. A more sophisticated reply the constructive\nempiricist might give invokes the recognition that, as \u00a7 1.7\nabove notes, acceptance comes in degrees and has a pragmatic element.\nThe constructive empiricist can allow that a scientist (mostly)\naccepts a theory, insofar as: \n\n\n\nthe scientist believes that many/most of the observable phenomena it\ndescribes can be embedded in the theory\u2019s substructures, and\n\n\n\nthe scientist is fairly strongly committed to using the theory as the\nbasis for the scientist\u2019s research program. \n\n\nThe satisfaction of (1) and (2) suffice for the scientist to accept\nthe theory to a high degree, even if the scientist does not accept the\ntheory in a categorical, unqualified way. As van Fraassen himself\nacknowledges, it is only unqualified acceptance of a theory\nthat involves the belief that the theory is empirically adequate\n(1998, 213).\n\nAny tendency we might have to think scientists do fully accept\ntheories may simply be the result of the social role the scientists\nplay as explainers of those theories (as also noted in \u00a7 1.7\nabove). In that role, the scientists \u201canswer questions ex\ncathedra \u201d (van Fraassen 2007, 12), in a manner that the\nunsophisticated listener might mistakenly perceive as a display of\nunqualified confidence in and acceptance of the theories\u2019 empirical\nadequacy. The reality is more subtle\u2014the acceptance is almost\nalways a qualified one. \n\nIn any case, even if there is disagreement about how fully scientists\naccept theories, the above reflections suggest that the constructive\nempiricist\u2019s position on theory acceptance is vindicated: the\ndegree to which scientists accept a theory is plausibly correlated\nwith the degree to which they believe the theory to be empirically\nadequate.\n",
