    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems || The problem of common causes of votes\n2.2 The problem of common causes of votes\n\nA tempting mistake is to believe that votes are probabilistically\nindependent as soon as they are causally independent, i.e.,\ndo not affect one another. Votes are often causally independent:\nsecret voting prevents someone\u2019s vote from influencing someone\nelse\u2019s vote. Sometimes not only the votes (or voting acts), but\neven the individuals more broadly (their reasonings, perspectives,\nknowledge, votes, etc.) are causally independent. This happens if\nindividuals do not deliberate or otherwise interact\u2014a rare, but\npossible scenario. Deliberation immediately creates causal dependence\nbetween individuals, but not between their (secret) votes.\n\nCausal independence (between votes or even individuals) by no means\nmakes votes probabilistically independent, since common\ncauses create correlations. This fact will be obvious to empirical\nscientists, statisticians, or causal-network theorists; see, for\ninstance, the entry on\n Reichenbach\u2019s common cause principle,\n as well as Reichenbach (1956), Pearl (2000) and Dietrich and List\n(2004) on common causes in jury theorems. Common causes of votes are\nfactors influencing two or more votes. They exist in abundance. Voters\nare usually exposed to\n\nshared evidence, such as witness reports;\nshared perspective-shaping influences, coming from a shared\nlanguage, shared concepts, a shared methodology, or shared\nhypotheses;\nshared contextual influences that are unrelated to the decision\ntask yet affect judgment skills, such as noise or heat.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting correlations between votes\u2014and\nultimately between correctness events \\(R_{1},R_{2},\\ldots\\)\u2014are\nusually positive, which undermines diversity and reinforces tendencies\nand errors. Positive correlation between correctness events means:\ngiven that someone votes correctly, others are more likely to\nvote correctly. Why is the correlation positive? A correct judgment\nby, say, individual 1 (the event \\(R_{1}\\)) raises the probability\nthat the common causes take a truth-conducive form (i.e., that\nevidence is non-misleading, contextual influences support judgmental\nskills, etc.), which in turn raises the probability that other\nindividuals are correct (the events \\(R_{2},R_{3},\\ldots\\)).\nConversely, an error by individual 1 raises the probability of\nmisleading common causes, which raises the probability of errors by\nothers.\n\nIn sum, voting and correctness are interpersonally (positively)\ncorrelated through common causes, against Condorcet\u2019s\nindependence assumption.\n",
