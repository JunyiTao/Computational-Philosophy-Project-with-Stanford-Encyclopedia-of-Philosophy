    "main_text": "Two Attempts to Create a Third Way || Republican Liberty\n3.2 Republican Liberty\n\nAnother increasingly influential group of philosophers has rejected\nboth the negative and the positive conception, claiming that liberty\nis not merely the enjoyment of a sphere of non-interference but the\nenjoyment of certain conditions in which such non-interference is\nguaranteed (Pettit 1997, 2001, 2014; Skinner 1998, 2002; Weinstock and\nNadeau 2004; Laborde and Maynor 2008; Lovett 2010, forthcoming; Breen and\nMcBride 2015, List and Valentini 2016). These conditions may include\nthe presence of a democratic constitution and a series of safeguards\nagainst a government wielding power arbitrarily, including popular\ncontrol and the separation of powers. As Berlin admits, on the negative\nview, I am free even if I live in a dictatorship just as long as the\ndictator happens, on a whim, not to interfere with me (see also Hayek\n1960). There is no necessary connection between negative liberty and\nany particular form of government. Is it not counterintuitive to say\nthat I can in theory be free even if I live in a dictatorship, or that\na slave can enjoy considerable liberty as long as the slave-owner is\ncompassionate and generous? Would my subjection to the arbitrary power\nof a dictator or slave-owner not itself be sufficient to qualify me as\nunfree? If it would be, then we should say that I am free only if I\nlive in a society with the kinds of political institutions that\nguarantee the independence of each citizen from such arbitrary power.\nQuentin Skinner has called this view of freedom\n\u2018neo-Roman\u2019, invoking ideas about freedom both of the\nancient Romans and of a number of Renaissance and early modern\nwriters. Philip Pettit has called the same view\n\u2018republican\u2019, and this label has generally prevailed in\nthe recent literature.\n\nRepublican freedom can be thought of as a kind of status: to\nbe a free person is to enjoy the rights and privileges attached to the\nstatus of republican citizenship, whereas the paradigm of the unfree\nperson is the slave. Freedom is not simply a matter of\nnon-interference, for a slave may enjoy a great deal of\nnon-interference at the whim of her master. What makes her unfree is\nher status, such that she is permanently exposed to\ninterference of any kind. Even if the slave enjoys non-interference,\nshe is, as Pettit puts it, \u2018dominated\u2019, because she is\npermanently subject to the arbitrary power of her owner.\n\nAccording to Pettit, then, republicans conceive of freedom not as\nnon-interference, as on the standard negative view, but as\n\u2018non-domination\u2019. Non-domination is distinct from negative\nfreedom, he says, for two reasons. First, as we have seen, one can\nenjoy non-interference without enjoying non-domination. Second, one\ncan enjoy non-domination while nevertheless being interfered with,\njust as long as the interference in question is constrained to track\none\u2019s avowed interests thanks to republican power structures:\nonly arbitrary power is inimical to freedom, not power as such.\n\nOn the other hand, republican freedom is also distinct from positive\nfreedom as expounded and criticized by Berlin. First, republican\nfreedom does not consist in the activity of virtuous political\nparticipation; rather, that participation is seen as instrumentally\nrelated to freedom as non-domination. Secondly, the republican concept\nof freedom cannot lead to anything like the oppressive consequences\nfeared by Berlin, because it has a commitment to non-domination and to\nliberal-democratic institutions already built into it.\n\nPettit\u2019s idea of freedom as non domination has caught the\nimagination of a great many political theorists over the last two\ndecades. One source of its popularity lies in the fact that it seems\nto make sense of the phenomena of oppression and structural injustice\nreferred to above, but without necessarily relying on references to\ninternal constraints. It has been applied not only to relations of\ndomination between governments and citizens, but also to relations of\ndomination between employers and workers (Breen and McBride 2015),\nbetween husbands and wives (Lovett forthcoming), and between able-bodied and\ndisabled people (De Wispelaere and Casassas 2014).\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the republican concept of\nfreedom is ultimately distinguishable from the negative concept, or\nwhether republican writers on freedom have not simply provided good\narguments to the effect that negative freedom is best promoted, on\nbalance and over time, through certain kinds of political\ninstitutions rather than others. While there is no necessary\nconnection between negative liberty and democratic government, there\nmay nevertheless be a strong empirical correlation between the two.\nIan Carter (1999, 2008), Matthew H. Kramer (2003, 2008), and Robert\nGoodin and Frank Jackson (2007) have argued, along these lines, that\nrepublican policies are best defended empirically on the basis of the\nstandard negative ideal of freedom, rather than on the basis of a\nconceptual challenge to that ideal. An important premise in such an\nargument is that the extent of a person\u2019s negative freedom is a\nfunction not simply of how many single actions are prevented, but of\nhow many different act-combinations are prevented. On this\nbasis, people who can achieve their goals only by bowing and scraping\nto their masters must be seen as less free, negatively, than people\nwho can achieve those goals unconditionally. Another important premise\nis that the extent to which people are negatively free depends, in\npart, on the probability with which they will be constrained\nfrom performing future acts or act-combinations. People who are\nsubject to arbitrary power can be seen as less free in the negative\nsense even if they do not actually suffer interference, because the\nprobability of their suffering constraints is always greater\n(ceteris paribus, as a matter of empirical fact) than it\nwould be if they were not subject to that arbitrary power. Only this\ngreater probability, they say, can adequately explain republican\nreferences to the \u2018fear\u2019, the \u2018sense of\nexposure\u2019, and the \u2018precariousness\u2019 of the dominated\n(for further discussion see Bruin 2009, Lang 2012, Shnayderman 2012,\nKirby 2016, Carter and Shnayderman 2019).\n\nIn reply to the above point about the relevance of probabilities,\nrepublicans have insisted that freedom as non-domination is\nnevertheless distinct from negative liberty because what matters for\nan agent\u2019s freedom is the impossibility of others\ninterfering, not the mere improbability of their doing so.\nConsider the example of gender relations with the context of marriage.\nA husband might be kind and generous, or indeed have a strong sense of\negalitarian justice, and therefore be extremely unlikely ever\nto deny his wife the same opportunities as he himself enjoys; but the\nwife is still dominated if the structure of norms in her\nsociety is such as to permit husbands to frustrate the choices of\ntheir wives in numerous ways. If she lives in such a society, she is\nstill subject to the husband\u2019s power whether he likes\nit or not. And whether the husband likes it or not, the wife\u2019s\nsubjection to his power will tend to influence how third parties treat\nher \u2013 for example, in terms of offering employment opportunities.\n\nTaken at face value, however, the requirement of impossibility of\ninterference seems over demanding, as it is never completely\nimpossible for others to constrain me. It is not impossible that I be\nstabbed by someone as I walk down the street this afternoon. Indeed,\nthe possible world in which this event occurs is very close to the\nactual world, even if the event is improbable in the actual world. If\nthe mere possibility of the stabbing makes me unfree to walk down the\nstreet, then unfreedom is everywhere and the achievement of freedom is\nitself virtually impossible. To avoid this worry, republicans have\nqualified their impossibility requirement: for me to be free to walk\ndown the street, it must be impossible for others to stab me with\nimpunity (Pettit 2008a, 2008b; Skinner 2008). This qualification\nmakes the impossibility requirement more realistic. Nevertheless, the\nqualification is open to objections. Is \u2018impunity\u2019 a\npurely formal requirement, or should we say that no one can carry out\na street stabbing with impunity if, say, at least 70% of such\nstabbings lead to prosecution? Even if 100% of such stabbings lead to\nprosecution, there will still be some stabbings. Will they not be\nsources of unfreedom for the victims?\n\nMore recently some republicans have sidelined the notion of impunity\nof interference in favour of that of \u2018ignorability\u2019 of\ninterference (Ingham and Lovett 2019). I am free to make certain\nchoices if the structure of effective societal norms, whether legal or\ncustomary, is such as to constrain the ability of anyone else to\nfrustrate those choices, to the point where the possibility of such\nfrustration, despite existing, is remote enough to be something I can\nignore. Once I can ignore that possibility, then the structure of\neffective norms makes me safe by removing any sense of exposure to\ninterference. Defenders of the negative concept of liberty might\nrespond to this move by saying that the criterion of ignorability\nlooks very much like a criterion of trivially low probability: we\nconsider ourselves free to do x to the extent that the\nsystem of enforced norms deters others\u2019 prevention of x\nin such a way as to make that prevention improbable.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether republicans have successfully carved\nout a third concept of freedom that is really distinct from those of\nnegative and positive liberty. This conceptual uncertainty need not\nitself cast doubt on the distinctness and attractiveness of\nrepublicanism as a set of political prescriptions. Rather, what it\nleaves open is the question of the ultimate normative bases of those\nprescriptions: is \u2018non-domination\u2019 something that\nsupervenes on certain configurations of negative freedom and\nunfreedom, and therefore explainable in terms of such configurations,\nor is it something truly distinct from those configurations?\n",
