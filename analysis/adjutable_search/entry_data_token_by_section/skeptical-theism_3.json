    "main_text": "Outweighing Goods and Noseeum Inferences || CORNEA-based Criticisms\n1.3 CORNEA-based Criticisms\n\nSome skeptical theists critique noseeum arguments by using what is\ncalled a CORNEA-based criticism (Wykstra 1984, 1996). Like many\nskeptical theistic critiques, this critique has two components\u2014a\ngeneral epistemic principle and some claims in philosophy of religion.\nBy combining the two components, skeptical theists aim to undermine\nsome argument.\n\nThe term \u2018CORNEA\u2019 is an unprincipled acronym: Condition On\nReasoNable Epistemic Access. A CORNEA principle is an epistemic\nprinciple stating conditions on when it is reasonable for a person to\nclaim or believe p on the basis of something q.\nWykstra himself formulated a range of principles that are not\nobviously equivalent. A simple CORNEA principle is:\n\nSimple-CORNEA (S-C)\n\nA person is prima facie reasonable in believing p on\nthe basis of q only if, given their cognitive abilities, it\nis reasonable for them to believe that if p were different,\nthen q would likely be different as well.\n\nTo illustrate the plausibility of CORNEA principles, consider the\nfollowing case. A doctor accidentally drops a needle on the floor. The\ndoctor picks up the needle, visually inspects it, and announces that\nthe needle is free of viruses and bacteria. Is the doctor prima\nfacie reasonable in believing the needle is free of viruses and\nbacteria on the basis of his visual experience? Intuitively not. A\nprinciple like S-C is well-suited to explain why. It\nis not reasonable for the doctor to believe that, given his cognitive\nabilities, if the needle were contaminated with bacteria or viruses,\nthen his visual experience would likely be different as well.\n\nA CORNEA principle like S-C is a general epistemic\nprinciple that can be applied to any range of cases. Skeptical theists\napply it to the inference from N-O1.21 to\nN-O1.22. Suppose we are prima\nfacie reasonable in believing that God\u2019s permission of the\nfawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering would not be\nnecessary for some outweighing good on the basis of our failure to see\nan outweighing good connected to their suffering by reflecting. Then,\nby S-C, it must be reasonable for us to believe that\nif God\u2019s permission of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering were necessary for some outweighing\ngood, then we would likely not fail to identify an outweighing good\nconnected to their suffering by reflecting.\n\nBut skeptical theists argue that this is not reasonable for\nus to believe. That is, they argue that even if God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering were\nnecessary for some outweighing good, then it is likely that we would\nfail to identify an outweighing good connected to their suffering\nsimply by reflecting. Skeptical theists give analogies to support\nthese claims. One extended analogy is a parent/child analogy (compare\nWykstra 1984: 88; 1996: 142\u20135). A baby infant is in no position\nto evaluate its parent\u2019s plans for its life. But our cognitive\nabilities are like a baby infant\u2019s in comparison to God\u2019s.\nSo too, we are in no position to evaluate all of God\u2019s plans.\nSimilarly, parents with increased intelligence, understanding of\ngoods, and abilities are more likely to plan for goods in their\nchildren\u2019s future\u2014a future which their children are not\nyet able to see. God, having maximum intelligence, understanding, and\nability, is thus likely to make plans where many goods will be in the\nfuture in ways we cannot expect to understand. Another analogy\ninvolves the \u201cphysical depth\u201d of the universe (cf. Russell\nand Wykstra 1988: 146\u20138; see also Alston 1991 [1996]: 109). If\nGod created the universe, God created it with \u201cphysical\ndepth,\u201d where many of the features of the universe are difficult\nto learn about. So too, if God has plans for creation, God is likely\nto have created it with \u201cmoral depth,\u201d where many of the\ngoods that play a role in God\u2019s plan are not\n\u201csurface\u201d goods easily identified but rather more obscure\nto\n us.\n\n\nThus, by S-C, believing\nN-O1.22 on the basis of\nN-O1.21 is reasonable only if it is\nreasonable to believe that, given our cognitive faculties, if\nGod\u2019s permission of their suffering were necessary for an\noutweighing good, we\u2019d identify that good by reflecting. But\nthat\u2019s not reasonable for us to believe\u2014even if there is\nan outweighing good justifying God\u2019s permission of their\nsuffering, then we likely wouldn\u2019t see it by reflecting. So\nit\u2019s not reasonable to believe\nN-O1.22 on the basis of\nN-O1.21. Thus, according to this line of\nreasoning, the sub-argument for N-O1.2\nfails.\n",
