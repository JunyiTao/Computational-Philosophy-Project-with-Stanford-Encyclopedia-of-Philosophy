In\n Kleene 1936 a simpler definition was given and in Kleene 1943 the\n standard form which uses the so-called minimization or\n \\(\\mu\\)-operator was introduced. For more information, see the entry\n on\n recursive functions.\n\nChurch used the definition of general recursive functions to state his\nthesis:\n\n\nChurch\u2019s thesis Every effectively calculable\nfunction is general recursive\n\n\nIn the context of recursive function one uses the notion of recursive\nsolvability and unsolvability rather than Turing computability and\nuncomputability. This terminology is due to Post (1944).\n",
