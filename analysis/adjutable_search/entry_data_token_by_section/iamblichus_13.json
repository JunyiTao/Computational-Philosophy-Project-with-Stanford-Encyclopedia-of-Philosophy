    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism, Mathematics || Mathematics\n4.2 Mathematics\n\nLimit and the Unlimited are also principles active among mathematical\nentities (On General Mathematical Science, chap. 13). Here\nthey play a role similar to that of the pairs Monad and Dyad, Odd and\nEven, or Same and Other according to Nicomachus of Gerasa, the\nneo-Pythagorean author of the Introduction to Arithmetic and\none of Iamblichus\u2019 intellectual heroes; similar pairs studied by\nthe mathematical sciences are \u201ccontinuous\u201d and\n\u201cdiscrete\u201d (sunekhes, di\u014drismenon),\n\u201cmagnitude\u201d and \u201cplurality\u201d\n(megethos, pl\u0113thos: cf. Nicomachus,\nIntr. arith. I, 2, 4\u20135), all of which concur\nto form a dynamic picture of reality. The four mathematical\nsciences\u2014arithmetic, which takes precedence over the others;\ngeometry, music and astronomy\u2014each study a corresponding kind of\nbeing, and were the object of On Pythagoreanism vol. IV and\nVIII\u2013X respectively (see the plan of the work as outlined by\nO\u2019Meara 1989).\n\nIamblichus\u2019 interest in mathematics is part of a larger trend\nthat includes authors such as Theon of Smyrna and Calcidius, but\nexcludes Plotinus and, to a lesser extent, Porphyry. For Iamblichus,\nmathematics is both a scientific discipline and concerns a realm of\nbeing, intermediate between the intelligible and the sensible: the\nlatter view is influenced by Aristotelian ontology as well as by the\nPlatonic analogy of the Line (Republic, 509d\u2013511e), but\nwith the Pythagorean proviso that mathematical entities \u201cexist\nin themselves\u201d and that each number possesses a distinct\nessence.\n\nThe study of mathematics allows the soul to disengage itself from the\nmaterial world, thus providing a starting point towards higher being.\nMore interestingly, mathematics is assigned symbolic significance in a\nvariety of fields: vol. V\u2013VII of On Pythagoreanism (now\nlost) dealt with the mathematical teachings that can be drawn\nconcerning ethics, physics and theology respectively (the anonymous\nTheologoumena arithmeticae might provide some insight into\nIamblichus\u2019 view of the relation between arithmetic and\ntheology, as they include extensive quotes from Nicomachus as well as\nIamblichus\u2019 first teacher Anatolius). Mathematics is therefore\nversatile and multivalent in its essence (see, e.g., On General\nMathematical Science, chap. 15; 18), and thus closely associated\nwith the soul (ibid., chap. 9). It is also very likely that\nSyrianus\u2019 distinction of various types of\n\u201cnumber\u201d\u2014in descending order: eidetic, mathematical,\nphysical, cf., e.g., In Metaphysica\n122.11\u201316\u2014stems from Iamblichean teachings.\n\nIamblichus\u2019 writings on mathematics were influential, and are\nused, e.g., in Syrianus\u2019 commentary on the Metaphysics\nand Proclus\u2019 commentary on Euclid. His views on the\nquadrivium, drawing upon Nicomachus, were also adopted by\nMartianus Capella and Boethius, and through them became an integral\npart of education in the Middle Ages.\n",
