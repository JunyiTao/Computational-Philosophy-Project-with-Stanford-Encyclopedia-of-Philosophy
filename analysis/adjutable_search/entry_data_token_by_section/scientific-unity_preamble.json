    "main_text": "\n\nThe topic of unity in the sciences can be explored through questions\nsuch as the following: Is unity a feature of reality or of our modes\nof cognition? Is there one privileged, most basic or fundamental\nconcept or kind of thing and, if not, how are the different concepts\nor kinds of things in the universe related? Can the various natural\nsciences (e.g., physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology) be unified\ninto a single overarching theory, and can theories within a single\nscience (e.g., general relativity and quantum theory in physics, or\nmodels of evolution and development in biology) be unified? How are\nthe so-called human sciences related to the natural ones? Are theories\nor models the relevant connected units? What other connected or\nconnecting units are there? Does the unification of these parts of\nscience involve only matters of fact or are matters of value involved\nas well? What about matters of method, material, institutional,\nethical and other aspects of intellectual cooperation? Moreover, what\nkinds of unity, not just units, in the sciences are there? And is the\nrelation of unification one of reduction, translation, explanation,\nlogical inference, collaboration or something else? What roles can\nunification play in scientific practices, their development,\napplication and evaluation? Are those expressions of more general\ncognitive activities? How are all these questions to be investigated?\nIs unification an aim of inquiry or a guiding idea at the service of\nulterior aims? Is it a question for philosophy, e.g., for metaphysics\nor epistemology? If so, how can examining scientific practices help?\nOr is philosophy, rather, a resource for understanding science?\n",
