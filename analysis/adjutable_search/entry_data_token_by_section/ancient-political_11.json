    "main_text": "Aristotle || Aristotle\u2019s Philosophical Method and Ethics\n4.1 Aristotle\u2019s Philosophical Method and Ethics\n\nWhereas Plato\u2019s philosophy continually sought a single or small\nset of unifying truths behind the veil of appearance,\nAristotle\u2019s wide-ranging researches into what would now be\nconsidered the natural sciences, as well as in logic and other areas\nof inquiry, manifested respect for the opinions of \u201cthe many and\nthe wise\u201d as a starting-point for philosophical understanding.\nHis approach likewise manifested appreciation of the multiplicity of\nforms of knowledge, in particular the cleavage between theoretical\nunderstanding of the world as it necessarily is, and practical\nknowledge of how to deliberate about acting in relation to whatever\n\u201ccould be otherwise.\u201d Uniting his accounts of phenomena as\ndifferent as plants, animals, ethics and politics, was a teleological\nstructure of explanation. Biological creatures work to fulfill the\nrealization of their end or telos, a specific way of living a\ncomplete life characteristic of the plants or animals of their own\nkind, which is the distinctive purpose that defines their fundamental\nnature\u2014just as human artifacts are designed and used for\nspecific ends. While every human being, in acting, posits a particular\ntelos as the purpose making that action intelligible, this\nshould ideally reflect the overall natural telos of humans as\nsuch.\n\nHere, however, arises a problem unique to humans. Whereas other\nanimals have a single telos defining their nature (living the\nfull life of a frog, including reproduction, being the sole\ntelos of each frog, in the example used by Lear 1998), humans\nboth have a distinctive human nature\u2014arising from the unique\ncapacity to use language to deliberate about how to act\u2014and\nalso share in the divine nature in their ability to use reason to\nunderstand the eternal and intelligible order of the world. Practical\nreason is the domain of ethics and politics, the uniquely human\ndomain. Yet the political life is not necessarily the best life,\ncompared with that devoted to the divinely shared human capacity for\ntheoretical reason and philosophical thinking (compare Nicomachean\nEthics I with X.7\u20139). Whether it is the life of\ncontemplative reason or the life of practical reason that is best for\nhumans, the good life will require the development of the various\nhuman moral and intellectual virtues, which include (without being\nlimited to) courage, moderation, justice, prudence, understanding, and\nwisdom. \n",
