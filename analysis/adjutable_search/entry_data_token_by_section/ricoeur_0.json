    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nPaul Ricoeur was born on February 27, 1913 in Valence, France. His\nmother died shortly thereafter and his father was killed in the Battle\nof the Marne in 1915, so Ricoeur and his sister were reared by their\npaternal grandparents and an unmarried aunt in Rennes. They were\ndevout members of the French Reformed Protestant tradition. He was\nlater to speak of the role of faith in his life as \u201can accident\ntransformed into a destiny through an ongoing choice, while\nscrupulously respecting other choices.\u201d As a war orphan his\nschooling was paid for by the French government. He studied philosophy\nfirst at the University of Rennes and then at the Sorbonne. From the\nearliest years of his academic life he was convinced that there is a\nbasic, irreducible difference between things and human beings as\npersons and as agents. Unlike things, persons can engage in free,\nthoughtful action. But Ricoeur never accepted any version of a\nsubstance dualism in the person as the Cartesian cogito and\nthe Kantian transcendental subject can be read to require. He did,\nhowever, accept Kant\u2019s doctrine regarding the antinomies of\nreason and the necessary distinction between theoretical and practical\nreason. Ricoeur was studying in Germany when World War II broke out.\nSoon after being called up for service in the French army in 1939 he\nwas captured and spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Germany.\nThere he was able to study the work of Karl Jaspers and to prepare a\ntranslation of Husserl\u2019s Ideas I in the margins of the\nbook which he had to conceal from his jailers. After the war, he\ncompleted his doctorate and was appointed lecturer, then professor of\nthe history of philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, where he\nsucceeded Jean Hyppolite. He remained there until 1956, when he was\nnamed to the chair of general philosophy at the Sorbonne. In 1965, he\njoined the faculty of the new University of Paris at Nanterre, now\nParis X, whose establishment he had supported in light of the rapid\ngrowth in the number of university students at that time. He served a\ndifficult year as Dean of the faculty of letters following the student\nuprising of 1968. Except for three years he then spent at Louvain, he\ncontinued to teach a seminar at the Husserl Archive in Paris until he\nreached the mandatory retirement age in 1980. From 1954 on, Ricoeur\nalso lectured regularly in the United States and Canada. In 1970 he\nwas named to succeed Paul Tillich as the John Nuveen professor of\nphilosophical theology at the University of Chicago, with a joint\nappointment in the Divinity School, the Philosophy Department, and the\nCommittee on Social Thought. He taught there regularly for a portion\nof each year until 1992. In 1986 he gave the Gifford Lectures in\nEdinburgh, Scotland. Ricoeur\u2019s work has been translated into\nmore than twenty-five languages and he was honored by a volume in the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers series. Among his many\nhonorary doctorates are ones from Chicago (1967), Northwestern (1977),\nColumbia (1981), G\u00f6ttingen (1987), and McGill (1992). He was the\nrecipient of numerous awards, among them the Hegel Prize (Stuttgart,\n1985), the Dante Prize (Florence, 1988), the Karl Jaspers Prize\n(Heidelberg, 1989), the Leopold Lucas Prize (T\u00fcbingen, 1990), the\nFrench Academy Grand Prize for Philosophy (1991), the Kyoto Prize\n(2000), and the Pope Paul VI International Prize (2003). In 2004, he\nwas co-recipient of the John W. Kluge Prize in the Human Sciences\nawarded by the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.\n",
