    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Later Work: Towards Relativism, but then Beyond It || Feyerabend in the Nineties\n6. Conclusion: Last Things\n\nFeyerabend\u2019s autobiography occupied him right up until his death\non February 11th, 1994, at the Genolier Clinic, overlooking Lake\nGeneva. At the end of the book, he expressed the wish that what should\nremain of him would be \u201cnot papers, not final\ndeclarations, but love\u201d (p. 181).\n\nHis autobiography was published in 1995, a third volume of his\nPhilosophical Papers appeared in 1999, and his last book\nThe Conquest of Abundance, edited by Bert Terpstra, appeared\nin the same year. A volume of his papers on the philosophy of quantum\nmechanics is currently being prepared, under the editorship of Stefano\nGattei and Joseph Agassi. \n\nAlthough the focus of philosophy of science has moved away from\ninterest in scientific methodology in recent years, this is not due in\nany great measure to acceptance of Feyerabend\u2019s\nanti-methodological argument. His critique of science (which gave him\nthe reputation for being an \u201canti-science philosopher\u201d,\n\u201cthe worst enemy of science\u201d, etc.) is patchy. Some of its\nflaws stem directly from his scientific realism. It sets up a straight\nconfrontation between science and other belief-systems as if they are\nall aiming to do the same thing (give us \u201cknowledge of\nthe world\u201d) and must be compared for how well they deliver the\ngoods. A better approach would be, in Gilbert Ryle\u2019s words,\n\u201cto draw uncompromising contrasts\u201d between the businesses\nof science and those of other belief-systems. Such an approach fits\nfar better with the theme Feyerabend approached later in his life:\nthat of the disunity of science.\n\nFeyerabend came to be seen as a leading cultural relativist, not just\nbecause he stressed that some theories are incommensurable, but also\nbecause he defended relativism in politics as well as in epistemology.\nHis denunciations of aggressive Western imperialism, his critique of\nscience itself, his conclusion that \u201cobjectively\u201d there\nmay be nothing to choose between the claims of science and those of\nastrology, voodoo, and alternative medicine, as well as his concern\nfor environmental issues ensured that he was a hero of the\nanti-technological counter-culture.\n\nDifferent components and phases of Feyerabend\u2019s work have\ninfluenced very different groups of thinkers. His early scientific\nrealism, contextual theory of meaning, and the way he proposed to\ndefend materialism were taken up by Paul and Patricia Churchland.\nRichard Rorty, for a time, also endorsed eliminative materialism.\nFeyerabend\u2019s critique of reductionism has influenced\nphilosophers of science such as Cliff Hooker, Bas van Fraassen, and\nJohn Dupr\u00e9, and his general point of view influenced books such\nas Alan Chalmers\u2019 well-known introduction to philosophy of\nscience What Is This Thing Called Science? (1978).\n\nFeyerabend has also had considerable influence within the social\nstudies. He directly inspired books like D.L. Phillips\u2019\nAbandoning Method (1973), in which the attempt was made to\ntranscend methodology. Less directly, he has exerted enormous\ninfluence on a generation of sociologists of science through his\nrelativism, social constructivism, and apparent irrationalism. It is\nstill far too early to say whether, and in what way, his philosophy\nwill be remembered.\n",
