    "main_text": "Progress\n2. Progress\n\nTechnological progress extends the frontiers of the possible. To\nHayek, it is the freedom of the few to do something novel that matters\nmost, not the freedom of the many to do something familiar.\nAccordingly, the freedom I exercise myself often is not the freedom\nthat has the most bearing on my future (Hayek 1960, 32). Consider that\nearly adopters finance research that brings down production costs and\nthus finances a dispersion of products and services at falling prices\nthat eventually bring late adopters like me to the market. I may never\ntrade with early adopters, yet even so I depend on them, for they help\nto finance the invention and ongoing re-invention of products whose\nmarginal cost eventually falls to a point where I can afford them.\n\nOften, technological progress consists of innovations that lower\ntransaction cost: steam boat, railroad, air travel, telegraph,\ntelephone, internet, bar code reader, \u201capps\u201d that make\npossible such businesses as Uber and AirBnB, along with innovative\norganizational structures and business models such as Federal Express\nor container ships (which, after a ten-year legal battle with trade\nunions, reduced from days to minutes the time that a truck\u2019s\ncontents would spend at the dockyard before being transferred to a\nship). In many cases, the cost of transacting concerns the cost of\ninformation. As the frontier of knowledge expands, the slice that a\ngiven individual can grasp inevitably becomes a smaller fraction of\nthe whole. Prices become an increasingly indispensable window to a\nworld of tacit knowledge.\n\nIn summary, technological innovation shocks economies. Formerly\nprofitable investments become relics of a bygone age and must be\nliquidated. Workers get laid off until they find some other way to\nproduce goods wanted by today\u2019s customers. Transitions are\ntough, miscalculations abound, but the upshot is that we grope toward\nheights made possible by a given innovation. Innovative ways of\nlowering transaction cost spread throughout a community, and failures\n(including once-useful but now obsolete innovations) are discarded.\nMore precisely, failures are discarded if and when decision makers are\ninnovators on the ground, learning to avoid losing their own money on\nideas that fail to bear fruit in a given time and place.\n\nHayek denies that resources will ever be used at theoretical peak\nefficiency (1945, 527). Humans being what they are, waste is\nubiquitous. Mistakes are ubiquitous. The \u201cmarvel\u201d of\nmarkets is that people make mistakes, get burnt, learn fast, and make\ncorrections. By contrast, if decision makers are bureaucrats in large\norganizations, their focus is not on avoiding mistakes but on avoiding\nbudget cuts. If bureaucrats acknowledge that their plan is failing,\nthe consequences is not that they retrench and divert their own\nresources to better purposes but that their supervisors cut their\nbudgets. Note: what cuts their budget is not the mistake so much as\nsomeone learning from the mistake. Bureaucratic structure makes new\ninformation a threat that needs to be suppressed, or smothered in\npropaganda (1944, 126ff, 153ff).\n\nBureaucrats and their expert advisors experience mistakes not as\nevents from which they need to learn but rather as events that they\nneed to cover up. Their mistakes are with other people\u2019s money,\nso bureaucrats learn to say with a straight face, when confronted,\nthat their budget was not large enough, or that things would have been\nworse without their\n policies.[1]\n They may even believe what they are saying, but they do not know and\nhave every incentive to avoid learning.\n",
