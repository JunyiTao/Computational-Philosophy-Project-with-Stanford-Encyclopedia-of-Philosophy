    "main_text": "Global Atheism Versus Local Atheisms\n3. Global Atheism Versus Local Atheisms\n\nJeanine Diller (2016) points out that, just as most theists have a\nparticular concept of God in mind when they assert that God exists,\nmost atheists have a particular concept of God in mind when they\nassert that God does not exist. Indeed, many atheists are only vaguely\naware of the variety of concepts of God that there are. For example,\nthere are the Gods of classical and neo-classical theism: the\nAnselmian God, for instance, or, more modestly, the all-powerful,\nall-knowing, and perfectly good creator-God that receives so much\nattention in contemporary philosophy of religion. There are also the\nGods of specific Western theistic religions like Christianity, Islam,\nJudaism, and Sikhism, which may or may not be best understood as\nclassical or neo-classical Gods. There are also panentheistic and\nprocess theistic Gods, as well as a variety of other God-concepts,\nboth of Western and non-Western origin, that are largely ignored by\neven the most well-informed atheists. (Philosophically sophisticated\ntheists, for their part, often act as if refuting naturalism\nestablishes the existence of the particular sort of God in which they\nbelieve.) Diller distinguishes local atheism, which denies the\nexistence of one sort of God, from global atheism, which is the\nproposition that there are no Gods of any sort\u2014that all\nlegitimate concepts of God lack instances.\n\nGlobal atheism is a very difficult position to justify (Diller 2016:\n11\u201316). Indeed, very few atheists have any good reason to\nbelieve that it is true since the vast majority of atheists have made\nno attempt to reflect on more than one or two of the many legitimate\nconcepts of God that exist both inside and outside of various\nreligious communities. Nor have they reflected on what criteria must\nbe satisfied in order for a concept of God to count as\n\u201clegitimate\u201d, let alone on the possibility of legitimate\nGod concepts that have not yet been conceived and on the implications\nof that possibility for the issue of whether or not global atheism is\njustified. Furthermore, the most ambitious atheistic arguments popular\nwith philosophers, which attempt to show that the concept of God is\nincoherent or that God\u2019s existence is logically incompatible\neither with the existence of certain sorts of evil or with the\nexistence of certain sorts of non-belief [Schellenberg 2007]),\ncertainly won\u2019t suffice to justify global atheism; for even if\nthey are sound, they assume that to be God a being must be omnipotent,\nomniscient, and perfectly good, and as the character Cleanthes points\nout at the beginning of Part XI of Hume\u2019s Dialogues\n(see also Nagasawa 2008), there are religiously adequate God-concepts\nthat don\u2019t require God to have those attributes.\n\nGlobal atheists might object that, even if atheism and (metaphysical)\nnaturalism are not identical, a belief in the former can be based on a\nbelief in the latter; in other words, if one has good arguments for\nthe view that nature is a closed system, then that removes any burden\nto consider each God-concept separately, so long as all legitimate\nconcepts of God imply that God is a supernatural entity\u2014that is,\nan entity that is not natural, yet affects nature. Whether or not this\nstrategy for justifying global atheism works depends on whether it is\npossible to define \u201cnaturalism\u201d narrowly enough to imply\nthe non-existence of all Gods but not so narrowly that no convincing\narguments can be given for its truth. This is no easy task, especially\ngiven recent work on naturalist forms of theism (e.g., Bishop 2008;\nBuckareff & Nagasawa 2016: Part V; Diller & Kasher 2013: Part\nX; and Ellis 2014). Nor is it obvious that evidential arguments from\nevil can be extended to cover all legitimate God concepts, though if\nall genuine theisms entail that ultimate reality is both aligned with\nthe good and salvific (in some religiously adequate sense of\n\u201cultimate\u201d and \u201csalvific\u201d), then perhaps they\ncan. The crucial point, however, is that no one has yet made that\ncase.\n\nConcerning the issue of what exactly counts as a legitimate or\nreligiously adequate concept of God, various approaches might be\ntaken. One general strategy is to identify the religious role or roles\nthat anything deserving of the name or title \u201cGod\u201d must\nplay and then distinguish legitimate or illegitimate concepts of God\ndepending on whether anything falling under the concept in question\ncould or would successfully play that role. (See, for example, Le\nPoidevin 2010: 52; and Leftow 2016: 66\u201371.)\n\nA second approach (compatible with the first) assumes plausibly that\nthe word \u201cGod\u201d is a title instead of a proper name and\nthen asks what qualifications are required to bear that title (Pike\n1970). The fact that most titles indicate either rank or function\nsuggests that the meaning of \u201cGod\u201d has something to do\neither with occupying a position in a hierarchy or performing some\nfunction. For example, the common dictionary definition of\n\u201cGod\u201d as the Supreme Being and the Anselmian idea of God\nas the greatest possible being suggest that the title\n\u201cGod\u201d is rank-indicating, while the definition of\n\u201cGod\u201d as \u201cruler of the universe\u201d fits well\nwith the view that \u201cGod\u201d is function-indicating and\nexplains why the ordinary class noun, \u201cgod\u201d, might be\ndefined as \u201cruler of some part of the universe or of some sphere\nof human activity\u201d (e.g., Neptune, god of the sea, and Mars, god\nof war).\n\nA third approach (compatible with the first two) is to start from the\nclose connection in meaning between \u201cGod\u201d and\n\u201cworship\u201d. Worship appears to be essential to theistic\nreligions and thus an essential role that any being must play to\nqualify for the title \u201cGod\u201d is to be an appropriate object\nof worship. Indeed, although there is risk of circularity here if\n\u201cworship\u201d is defined in terms of the actions or attitudes\nappropriately directed towards \u201cGod\u201d, it would not be\nobviously mistaken to claim that being worthy of some form of\nreligious worship is not just necessary for divinity but sufficient as\nwell, especially if worthiness of worship entails worthiness of\nallegiance. Of course, forms of worship vary widely from one religion\nto another, so even if worthiness of worship is the sole defining\nfeature of a God, that doesn\u2019t mean that beliefs about what\nthese Gods are like won\u2019t vary widely from one religion to\nanother. In some religions, especially (but not only) certain Western\nmonotheistic ones, worship involves total devotion and unconditional\ncommitment. To be worthy of that sort of worship (if that is even\npossible when the pool of potential worshipers are autonomous\nagents like most adult humans) requires an especially impressive God,\nthough it is controversial whether or not it requires a perfect\none.\n\nIf the ambiguity that results from defining \u201cGod\u201d in terms\nof worthiness of worship is virtuous, then one might be tempted to\nadopt the following account of global atheism and its opposite,\n\u201cversatile theism\u201d:\n\n\nglobal atheism: there are no beings worthy of religious worship.\n\nversatile theism: there exists at least one being that is worthy of\nsome form of religious worship.\n\n\nNotice that on this account of \u201cglobal atheism\u201d, the\natheist only denies the existence of beings that are worthy\nof worship. Thus, not even a global atheist is committed to denying\nthe existence of everything that someone has called a god or\n\u201cGod\u201d. For example, even if the ancient Egyptians\nworshipped the Sun and regarded it as worthy of such worship, the\nglobal atheist need not deny the existence of the Sun. Instead, the\nglobal atheist can claim that the ancient Egyptians were mistaken in\nthinking that the Sun is worthy of religious worship.\n\nSimilarly, consider this passage at the beginning of Section XI of\nDavid Hume\u2019s Natural History of Religion:\n\n\nIf we examine, without prejudice, the ancient heathen mythology, as\ncontained in the poets, we shall not discover in it any such monstrous\nabsurdity, as we may at first be apt to apprehend. Where is the\ndifficulty in conceiving, that the same powers or principles, whatever\nthey were, which formed this visible world, men and animals, produced\nalso a species of intelligent creatures, of more refined substance and\ngreater authority than the rest? That these creatures may be\ncapricious, revengeful, passionate, voluptuous, is easily conceived;\nnor is any circumstance more apt, among ourselves, to engender such\nvices, than the license of absolute authority. And in short, the whole\nmythological system is so natural, that, in the vast variety of\nplanets and world[s], contained in this universe, it seems more\nthan probable, that, somewhere or other, it is really carried into\nexecution. (Hume [1757] 1956: 53, emphasis added)\n\n\nThere is much debate about whether Hume was an atheist or a deist or\nneither, but no one uses this passage to support the view that he was\nactually a polytheist. Perhaps this is because, even if there are\nnatural alien beings that, much like the ancient Greek and Roman gods,\nare far superior in power to humans but quite similar in their moral\nand other psychological qualities, presumably no one, at least\nnowadays, would be tempted to regard them as worthy of religious\nworship.\n\nOne possible flaw in the proposed account of global atheism is that it\nseems to imply overlap between deism and atheism. Of course, it\nwasn\u2019t that long ago when all deists were widely regarded as\natheists. These days, however, the term \u201cdeistic atheist\u201d\nor \u201catheistic deist\u201d has an oxymoronic ring to it. Of\ncourse, not all deists would count as atheists on the proposed\naccount, but some would. For example, consider a deist who believes\nthat, while a supernatural person intentionally designed the universe,\nthat deity did not specifically intend for intelligent life to evolve\nand has no interest whatsoever in the condition or fate of such life.\nSuch a deity would not be worthy of anyone\u2019s worship, especially\nif worthiness of worship entails worthiness of allegiance, and so\nwould arguably not be a (theistic) god, which implies that an atheist\ncould on the proposed definition consistently believe in the existence\nof such a deity. Perhaps, then, \u201cglobal atheism\u201d should be\ndefined as the position that both versatile theism and (versatile)\ndeism are false\u2014that there are no beings worthy of religious\nworship and also no cosmic creators or intelligent designers whether\nworthy of worship (and allegiance) or not. Even this account of\n\u201cglobal atheism\u201d, however, may not be sufficiently\ninclusive since there are religious roles closely associated with the\ntitle \u201cGod\u201d (and thus arguably legitimate notions of God)\nthat could be played by something that is neither an appropriate\nobject of worship nor a cosmic designer or creator.\n",
