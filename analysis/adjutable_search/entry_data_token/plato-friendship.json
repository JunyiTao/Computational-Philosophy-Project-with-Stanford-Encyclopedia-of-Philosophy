Socrates and the Art of Love\n\n\u201cThe only thing I say I know,\u201d Socrates tells us in the\nSymposium, \u201cis the art of love\u201d (ta\ner\u00f4tika) (177d8\u20139). Taken literally, it is an\nincredible claim. Are we really to believe that the man who affirms\nwhen on trial for his life that he knows himself to be wise \u201cin\nneither a great nor a small way\u201d (Apology 21b4\u20135)\nknows the art of love? In fact, the claim is a nontrivial play on\nwords facilitated by the fact that the noun er\u00f4s\n(\u201clove\u201d) and the verb er\u00f4tan (\u201cto ask\nquestions\u201d) sound as if they are etymologically\nconnected\u2014a connection explicitly exploited in the\nCratylus (398c5-e5). Socrates knows about the art of love in\nthat\u2014but just insofar as\u2014he knows how to ask questions,\nhow to converse elenctically.\n\nJust how far that is, we discover in the Lysis, where\nSocrates makes a similar claim. Hippothales, like Socrates, loves\nbeautiful boys and philosophical discussions (203b6\u2013204a3). But\nhe does not know the art of love and so does not know how to talk to\nLysis\u2014the boy with whom he is in love. What Hippothales does is\nsing eulogies to Lysis, and that, Socrates argues, no skilled\nlover would ever do. For if your suit succeeds \u201ceverything\nyou\u2019ve said and sung turns out to eulogize yourself as victor in\nhaving won such a boyfriend,\u201d but if it fails, then \u201cthe\ngreater your praise of his beauty and goodness, the more you will seem\nto have lost and the more you will be ridiculed.\u201d Consequently,\nsomeone \u201cwho is wise in the art of love (ta\ner\u00f4tika) doesn\u2019t praise his beloved until he has him:\nhe fears how the future may turn out\u201d (205e2\u2013206a2).\nConvinced, Hippothales asks Socrates to tell him \u201cwhat someone\nshould say or do to get his prospective boyfriend to love him?\u201d\n(206c1\u20133). As in the Symposium, Socrates is\nuncharacteristically forthcoming: \u201cif you\u2019re willing to\nhave him talk with me, I might be able to give you a demonstration of\nhow to carry on a discussion with him\u201d (c4\u20136). What\nfollows is an elenctic examination of Lysis. Socrates\u2019 lessons\nin love, we may infer, are elenctic lessons\u2014lessons in how to\nask and answer questions.\n\nAt the end of the examination, Socrates characterizes what he has\naccomplished: \u201cThis is how you should talk to your boyfriends,\nHippothales, making them humble and drawing in their sails, instead of\nswelling them up and spoiling them, as you do\u201d (210e2\u20135).\nIt sounds simply chastening put like that. But in the overall context\nof the Lysis, where love is a desire and desire is an\nemptiness, it is much more. It is a step in the creation of the\ncanonical lover\u2014the philosopher:\n\nThose who are already wise no longer love wisdom\n(philosophein), whether they are gods or men. Neither do\nthose who are so ignorant that they are bad, for no bad and stupid\nperson loves wisdom. There remains only those who have this bad thing,\nignorance, but have not yet been made ignorant and stupid by it. They\nare conscious of not knowing what they don\u2019t know.\n(218a2-b1)\n\nSo by showing Lysis that he isn\u2019t already wise, by getting him\nto recognize that he doesn\u2019t know, Socrates sets him on the road\nto philosophy (cf. Sophist 231b3\u20138).\n\nThe elenchus is important to love, then, because it creates a hunger\nfor wisdom\u2014a hunger which it cannot itself assuage. So even\nthough Lysis is already something of a philosopher when he meets\nSocrates and receives a rare accolade from him\u2014\u201cI was\npleased with his love of wisdom (philosophia)\u201d\n(213d6)\u2014he, too, is left in puzzlement (aporia). He is\nmade aware of his desire by Socrates but the desire itself remains\nunsatisfied. Socrates may be the master of foreplay, of arousing\ndesire, and may to that extent be a master of the art of love, but\nwhen it comes to satisfying desire, he is a failure.\n\nThe connection\u2014amounting to an identification\u2014between the\nart of discussion and the art of loving boys explored in the\nLysis allows us to see why Plato\u2019s own explorations of\nlove invariably involve an exploration of discussion\ntoo\u2014love-talk in the Lysis, symposiastic speech-making\nand drama in the Symposium, oratory and rhetoric in the\nPhaedrus. Loving boys correctly, after all, is\u2014in part\nat least\u2014just a matter of knowing how to talk to them, of how to\npersuade them to love you back.\n2. Socrates and Athenian Paiderastia\n\nAs a man who loves boys in an idiosyncratic, because elenctic, way,\nSocrates is placed in potential conflict with the norms of a peculiar\nAthenian social institution, that of paiderastia\u2014the\nsocially regulated intercourse between an older Athenian male\n(erast\u00eas) and a teenage boy (er\u00f4menos,\npais), through which the latter was supposed to learn virtue.\nAnd this potential, as we know, was realized with tragic\nconsequences\u2014in 399 BC Socrates was found guilty of corrupting\nthe young men of Athens and condemned to death. The effect on Plato is\npalpable in his works, turning very many of them into\ndefenses\u2014not always uncritical\u2014of Socrates, and of what he\nrepresented for the young men he encountered. His account in the\nSymposium of one such relationship\u2014that with the\nbrilliant and beautiful Alcibiades\u2014is an illuminating case in\npoint.\n\nAlcibiades was so in love with Socrates\u2014\u201cit was\nobvious,\u201d the Symposium (222c1\u20132) tells\nus\u2014that when asked to speak of love, he speaks of his beloved.\nNo general theories of love for him, just the vividly remembered story\nof the times he spent with a man so extraordinary there has never been\nanyone like him\u2014a man so powerfully erotic he turned the\nconventional world of love upside down by \u201cseeming to be a lover\n(erast\u00eas) while really establishing himself as a\nbeloved boy (pais) instead\u201d (222b3\u20134).\n\nThe stories of all the other symposiasts, too, are stories of their\nparticular loves masquerading as stories of love itself, stories about\nwhat they find beautiful masquerading as stories about what\nis beautiful. For Phaedrus and Pausanius, the canonical image\nof true love\u2014the quintessential love story\u2014features the\nright sort of older male lover and the right sort of beloved boy. For\nEryximachus the image of true love is painted in the languages of his\nown beloved medicine and of all the other crafts and sciences. For\nAristophanes it is painted in the language of comedy. For Agathon, in\nthe loftier tones of tragedy. In ways that these men are unaware of,\nthen, but that Plato knows, their love stories are themselves\nmanifestations of their loves and of the inversions or perversions\nexpressed in them. They think their stories are the truth about love,\nbut they are really love\u2019s delusions\u2014\u201cimages,\u201d\nas Diotima will later call them. As such, however, they are essential\nparts of that truth. For the power of love to engender delusive images\nof the beautiful is as much a part of the truth about it as its power\nto lead to the beautiful itself. Later, we shall learn why.\n\nLove stories, however inadequate as theories of love, are nonetheless\nstories, logoi, items that admit of analysis. But because\nthey are manifestations of our loves, not mere cool bits of\ntheorizing, we\u2014our deepest feelings\u2014are invested in them.\nThey are therefore tailor-made, in one way at least, to satisfy the\nSocratic sincerity condition, the demand that you say what you believe\n(Crito 49c11-d2, Protagoras 331c4-d1). Under the\ncool gaze of the elenctic eye, they are tested for consistency with\nother beliefs that lie just outside love\u2019s controlling and often\ndistorting ambit. Under such testing, a lover may be forced to say\nwith Agathon, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was talking about in\nthat story\u201d (201b11\u201312). The love that expressed itself in\nhis love story meets then another love: his rational desire for\nconsistency and intelligibility; his desire to be able to tell and\nlive a coherent story; his desire\u2014to put it the other way\naround\u2014not to be endlessly frustrated and conflicted, because he\nis repetitively trying to live out an incoherent love story.\n\nIn Alcibiades\u2019 love story, in particular, these two desires are\nself-consciously in play: \u201cSocrates is the only man in the world\nwho has made me feel shame\u2026 I know perfectly well that I\ncan\u2019t prove he\u2019s wrong when he tells me what I should do:\nyet, the moment I leave his side, I go back to my old ways: I cave in\nto my desire to please the crowd\u201d (216b1\u20135). Even such\nawareness of conflict as is manifested here, however, is no guarantee\nof a satisfactory resolution. For the new love\u2014the one that\nseems to offer coherence, satisfaction, and release from\nshame\u2014may turn out to be just the old frustrating one in\ndisguise.\n\nAlcibiades\u2019 famous failed attempt to seduce Socrates shows that\nthis is so in his case too (218b8-e5). For Alcibiades doesn\u2019t\ntry to win Socrates\u2019 love by undertaking the difficult task of\nself-transformation required to become a more virtuous, and so more\ntruly beautiful and lovable, person. Instead, he takes the easy,\nfamiliar path of offering the physical attractions he already\nhas\u2014the ones that have earned him the approval of the crowd.\nWhen these fail him, it is to the crowd (in the form of the Bacchic\nrevelers we meet at the end of the Symposium) he will\nregressively return, having never really succeeded in turning\naway.\n\nThat he has never turned away is made yet more vivid in one of the\nmost intriguing passages in the Symposium. Socrates,\nAlcibiades says, is \u201cironical eir\u00f4neuomenos) and\nspends his whole life playing with people. Yet, I don\u2019t know\nwhether anyone else has seen the figures within (ta entos\nagalmata) when he is serious and opened up, but I saw them once,\nand I thought that they were so divine and golden, so marvelously\nbeautiful, that I just had to do whatever Socrates told me\u201d\n(216e4\u2013217a2). Imagine seeing Socrates without his ironic mask\nof mock modesty. What we wouldn\u2019t give to see that. As is so\noften the case with love, however, it is fantasy we are dealing with.\nWhat Alcibiades thinks he sees in Socrates are embryonic virtues,\nwhich\u2014like spermatazoa in the embryology the Symposium\nimplicitly embraces when it speaks of the lover as pregnant\nand as seeking a beautiful boy in which to beget an\noffspring\u2014need only be ejaculated into the right receptacle in\norder to grow into their mature forms (209a5-c2). Sex can lead to\nvirtue, in other words, without the need for hard work. As soon as the\nillusion is enjoyed, therefore, it gives birth not to a realistic\nattempt to acquire virtue, but to the sexual seduction fantasy\nmentioned earlier.\n\nThe origins of this fantasy\u2014though, no doubt, partly\npersonal\u2014are predominantly social. It is the complex ideology of\nAthenian paiderasteia that has shaped Alcibiades\u2019 own\ndesires. For, according to it, love is really \u201ctwo\nthings\u201d: good Uranian love, whose object is the soul, and whose\naim is to instill virtue in the younger male; and bad Pandemotic love,\nwhose object is the body and whose aim is sexual pleasure for the\nolder lover (180c1-d7). What causes the split is the need Pandemotic\nlove has to mask itself as Uranian love in order to preserve the\nillusion that the young man\u2019s participation in it is compatible\nwith his status as a future male citizen. It cannot, then, be\nmotivated by a reprehensible desire to adopt a passive, slavish,\nfemale pleasure-seeking role. Instead, another motive must be invented\nfor it\u2014a willingness to accept \u201cslavery for the sake of\nvirtue\u201d (184c2\u20133).\n\nA major cost of preserving this split, however, is that the older\nmale\u2019s body-focused, sexual intercourse must itself be masked as\nintercourse of a more respectable sort. Alcibiades\u2019 later\nre-description of Socrates\u2019 inner figures shows him succumbing\nto the double-vision that inevitably results:\n\nIf you were to listen to his arguments, at first they\u2019d strike\nyou as totally ridiculous; they\u2019re clothed in words as coarse as\nthe hides worn by the most vulgar satyrs. He\u2019s always going on\nabout pack asses, or blacksmiths, or cobblers, or tanners\u2026 But\nif the arguments are opened and one sees them from the inside, he will\nfind first that they are the only arguments with any sense in them,\nand next that they contain within themselves utterly divine and\nmultitudinous figures of virtue (agalmat\u2019\naret\u00eas). (221e1\u2013222a4)\n\nFor Alcibiades, then, Socrates\u2019 body is identical to his words;\nthe virtues that are in him are in them; talking philosophy is having\nsexual intercourse, and vice versa.\n3. Loving Socrates\n\nAt the beginning of the Symposium, an unidentified man wants\nto hear what was said about love by Socrates and the others at\nAgathon\u2019s house. He has heard a garbled account. Now he wants\nApollodorus to tell him what was really said. But Apollodorus\nwasn\u2019t there either. He got his account of the proceedings\nsecond-hand from Aristodemus. All these men who ought to be chasing\nboys are presented as so besotted with Socrates and his conversations\nthat one of them\u2014Apollodorus\u2014makes it his business to know\nexactly what Socrates does and says each day (172c4\u20136), while\nanother\u2014Aristodemus\u2014is so far gone in his passion for\nSocrates that he walks barefoot like his beloved (173b1\u20134). One\nreason for this complex set-up is to let us see the inverting impact\nof Socrates\u2014and so of philosophy\u2014on Athenian paiderastic\nnorms. Another is more subtle. Alcibiades\u2019 love for Socrates\nfocuses on the beautiful figures of virtue which he thinks he sees\nlying beneath those \u201cwords as coarse as the hides worn by the\nmost vulgar satyrs,\u201d which are the analog for him of\nSocrates\u2019 ugly, satyr-like body (215b3-4). Aristodemus\u2019\nlove for Socrates, by contrast, seems to focus on his coarse exterior,\nso that Aristodemus himself is a sort of inverted Alcibiades, whose\nvery name associates him with Pausanias\u2019 body-centered goddess\nof love, Pand\u00eamos. Loving Socrates, we may infer, is a\ncomplex business, since just what someone loves in loving him is tied\nto that person\u2019s peculiar desires, and the limits they impose on\nhow like Socrates he can become.\n\nIn the dialogue\u2019s next few scenes, this point is driven home.\nWhen Aristodemus meets him, Socrates has just bathed and put on his\nfancy sandals\u2014\u201cboth very unusual events\u201d\n(174a3\u20134). Aristodemus remarks on this because he is naturally\nsensitive to those aspects of Socrates which he himself\u2014perhaps\nbecause of his own size and appearance (173b2)\u2014has chosen to\nemulate. The reason for the departure from his usual habits, Socrates\nexplains, is that he is going to Agathon\u2019s party and wants\n\u201cbeauty to go to beauty\u201d (174a9). Oddly, this\ndoesn\u2019t stop him from bringing Aristodemus\u2014un-bathed,\nun-sandaled, un-beautiful\u2014along. But what is odd from the point\nof view of Socrates\u2019 self-ascribed motivations is not\nat all odd from that of Plato\u2019s. He has now made the\ncomplexity of Socrates\u2014his beautiful insides and ugly outsides\nor vice versa\u2014as dramatically present to our eyes as to those of\nAgathon and his other guests.\n\nSocrates is invited to Agathon\u2019s\u2014Goodman\u2019s.\n(\u2018Agathon\u2019 means good in Greek.) He thinks\u2014wrongly\nas it happens\u2014that Aristodemus isn\u2019t invited, but offers\nto take him along anyway. Aristodemus\u2019\nreply\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say\u201d\n(174b2)\u2014again connects him to Alcibiades: \u201cI just had to\ndo whatever he told me\u201d (217a1\u20132). \u201cCome with me\nthen,\u201d Socrates responds, \u201cand we shall prove the proverb\nwrong; the truth is, \u2018Good men go uninvited to Goodman\u2019s\nfeast\u2019\u201d\n (174b4\u20135).[1]\n Aristodemus is not convinced. \u201cSocrates, I\u2019m\nafraid\u2026 mine is the case of an inferior arriving uninvited at\nthe table of a wise man\u201d (174c5\u20137). The familiar Socratic\ntri-unity\u2014good, beautiful, wise\u2014are all now in play.\n\nDespite his reservations, Aristodemus agrees to accompany\nSocrates\u2014but with an important proviso: \u201cSee what defense\nyou\u2019re going to make (apolog\u00eas\u00ea) for\nbringing me along, because I won\u2019t admit I came uninvited,\nI\u2019ll say you brought me!\u201d (174c7-d1). It is this proviso\nthat initiates the next mystifying episode. It begins when Socrates\nreplies by under-quoting Homer: \u201cWe\u2019ll take counsel about\nwhat to say \u2018when two go together along the way\u2019\u201d\n(174d2\u20133). What he leaves out is what happens when two\ndo go together, namely, \u201cone of them knows before the\nother\u201d (Iliad X. 24). The elision of this phrase is\nmatched by an elision of Plato\u2019s own. For what happened on the\nroad to Agathon\u2019s is that \u201cSocrates began to think about\nsomething, lost himself in thought, and kept lagging behind\u201d\n(174d4\u20137). Yet we are never told what he thought\nabout\u2014what it was that one knew before the other.\n\nThat the match between these two elisions is significant is\nestablished by another match: the one between the defense Socrates\ndoesn\u2019t give for bringing Aristodemus to Agathon\u2019s and the\none he doesn\u2019t give before the jury in 399 B.C., when he is on\ntrial for corrupting the youth. I mean, the defense Socrates\u2019\nfamiliar spirit or daimonion prevents him from giving by not\npreventing him from giving the one in which he speaks and acts in his\nown accustomed elenctic way\u2014in which he plays the part of\nhimself (Ap. 40a2-b6). Later in the Symposium, the\nmatch is reestablished by the close parallels between the preamble to\nSocrates\u2019 speech in praise of Er\u00f4s and that to\nhis speech before the jury. There he is \u201camazed\n(ethaumasa)\u201d by what his accusers say (Ap.\n17a4\u20135); here Agathon\u2019s speech is \u201camazing\n(thaumasta)\u201d (Smp. 198b4). There he\nisn\u2019t a clever (deinos) speaker, unless cleverness\nconsists in speaking the truth (Ap. 17a4-b6). Here he\nisn\u2019t clever in the art of love unless encomia to\nEr\u00f4s involve telling the truth about it (Smp.\n198c5\u2013199a6). There \u201cwhat the jurors will hear will be\nspoken extemporaneously (epituchousin) in whatever words come\nto mind\u201d (Ap. 17c1\u20132); here the symposiasts will\n\u201chear the truth spoken about Er\u00f4s in such words\nand arrangements as occur to me extemporaneously (tuch\u00ea\nepelthousa)\u201d (Smp. 199b3\u20135). Whatever\noccupies Socrates on the road to Agathon\u2019s, we may infer, ends\nnot in the knowledge Homer is so confident either he or Aristodemus\nwill have, but in the aporetic awareness of the absence of knowledge\nthat distinguishes Socrates\u2019 \u201chuman wisdom\u201d from the\n\u201cmore than human wisdom\u201d claimed by the sophists\n(Ap. 20c4-e8).\n\nThe result of Socrates\u2019 losing his way in thought and ending up\nstymied in Agathon\u2019s neighbor\u2019s porch is that Aristodemus,\nlike a proper Socratic paraclete, arrives at Agathon\u2019s quite a\nbit before Socrates. When Socrates finally does arrive in propria\nperson, Agathon says: \u201cSocrates, come lie down next to me.\nWho knows, if I touch you, I may catch a bit of the wisdom that came\nto you under my neighbor\u2019s porch\u201d (175c7-d1). Socrates\nreplies with an obviously sexual simile, which acknowledges, so as\nlater once again to invert, paiderastic norms: \u201cIf only wisdom\nwere like water which always flows from a full cup into an empty one\nwhen we connect them with a piece of yarn. If wisdom were that way\ntoo, I value the place beside you very much indeed; for I think I will\nbe filled from you with wisdom of great beauty\u201d (175d4-e2). What\nactually happens, however, is the very reverse. Socrates responds to\nAgathon\u2019s fancy speech about love with an elenchus, so that his\nemptiness, his lack of knowledge, flows into Agathon, destroying the\nwisdom of great beauty that had won his tragedy a first prize the day\nbefore (175e4\u20137).\n4. Love and the Ascent to the Beautiful\n\nSocrates is adept at some parts of the art of love but cannot take his\nbeloveds all the way. So he is clearly in need of further instruction\nin the art of love. In the Symposium, this is provided to him\nby Diotima, whom he describes as \u201cthe one who taught me the art\nof love\u201d (201d5). And what she teaches him, in a nutshell, is\nPlatonism. What the elenchus needs if it is to satisfy rather than\nfrustrate love, in other words, is the theory of Platonic Forms. What\nSocrates needs\u2014and so ought to love\u2014is Plato! The story of\nPlatonic love is, one might say, the story of the Platonizing of\nSocrates.\n\nIf what Socrates learned from Diotima was about all love, however, it\nwould be refuted by the very fact of Alcibiades, whose love for\nSocrates has not led him to love the beautiful itself. It would be\nequally refuted, indeed, by all the other symposiasts, none of whom\nhas been led there by his love. But Diotima\u2019s love story is not\nso general. It is self-advertised as a story about \u201cloving boys\ncorrectly (to orth\u00f4s paiderastein)\u201d\n(211b5\u20136)\u2014as a lesson in \u201cthe correct way to go or\nto be led by another to the art of love\u201d (211b7-c1). To be sure,\nit doesn\u2019t itself explicitly provide us with a story about how\nEr\u00f4s can act as a force which retards development. But\nthat isn\u2019t because Plato thought Er\u00f4s could not\nact as such a force\u2014consider Alcibiades. Rather, it is because\nDiotima\u2019s story is a story about successful or correct love.\n\nThe credibility of Diotima\u2019s love story is another matter, of\ncourse. To many, it has seemed both incredible and distasteful,\nbecause it seems to say that beautiful individuals have only\ninstrumental value. When one has climbed the ladder, of which they are\nmerely the first rung, one should kick it\u2014and them\u2014away.\nBut is this message really Diotima\u2019s?\n\nWhat we all love, according to Diotima, is the good\u2014that is to\nsay, we want good things to be ours forever. But because we are\nmortal, the closest we can come to satisfying this desire is to\ninitiate an endless cycle of reproduction in which each new generation\nhas good things. We achieve this, in a famous phrase, by \u201cgiving\nbirth in beauty (tokos en kal\u00f4)\u201d (206b7\u20138,\ne5). What does this mean? Like Athenian paiderasteia, Diotima\nrecognizes two fundamentally different kinds of love, two\nfundamentally different varieties of the desire to give birth in\nbeauty. In the case of heterosexual lovers, who are \u201cpregnant in\nbody,\u201d such giving birth consists in producing children who\nresemble, and so share in the beauty of their parents (209a3\u20134).\nHomosexual lovers, however, are a different story. What they give\nbirth to is \u201cwisdom and the rest of virtue\u201d (209b8). When\na man who is pregnant in soul finds a beautiful boy, Diotima says, it\n\u201cmakes him instantly teem with accounts of virtue\u201d\n(209b8), or \u201cbeautiful accounts\u201d (210a8). Giving birth to\nvirtue and giving birth to accounts of it are obviously different. But\nsome of the other phrases Diotima uses show us how to mitigate the\ndifference. For what homosexual lovers want is to give birth to\naccounts of virtue of a particular sort\u2014ones that can be used in\n\u201cthe proper ordering of cities and households\u201d\n(209a6\u20137), and so can \u201cmake young men better\u201d\n(210c1\u20133).\n\nIf the lover\u2019s accounts are to achieve this goal, however, they\nmustn\u2019t be the product of distorting fantasy, as Nietzsche\nthinks so many of our moral concepts are and as some feminists think\nour concept of romantic love itself is. What is intended to insure\nthat they will not is their openness to reality\u2014an openness\nguaranteed by the fact that in the course of his ascent the lover must\nstudy the beauty of ways of life and laws (210c3\u20135) and the\nbeauty of the sciences (c6\u20137). What he gains from these studies\nare the conceptual resources needed to see the world, including the\nhuman world, aright\u2014to gain knowledge of it. This is not the\nproject an analysand takes up in psychoanalysis. Nor is it the one\nthat we less formally undertake when we reflect on our own love\nstories in hopes of understanding them (often a project provoked alas\nby an unhappy ending). It is instead the project of philosophy, as\nPlato conceives of it. That is why it culminates in \u201cthe birth\nof many gloriously beautiful accounts and theories in unstinting love\nof wisdom (philosophia)\u201d (210d5\u20136). Yet the\ngrander project intersects with the analysand\u2019s project and with\nours in an interesting way. The terms or concepts we use to tell our\nlove stories must themselves be coherent if the stories we use them to\ntell are themselves to be coherently livable.\n\nIn Plato\u2019s view, this means that they must be the concepts the\ntrue lover uses once he has seen the beautiful itself\u2014the\nconcepts whose ontological correlates are forms. If they are not, they\nwill be incoherent and the lover who employs them will find himself\nembroiled in a love story he does not understand, a love story whose\nincoherence the elenchus, or psychoanalysis, or just plain critical\nscrutiny will reveal. It is this incoherence, indeed, encountered at\nlower stages in the ascent, that leads the correct lover, under\npressure from his rational desire for truth and consistency, and the\npain of inconsistency, to climb to the next stage.\n\nWe can see Diotima, then, not only as revealing the other more\nabstract loves that a true lover of boys must have, but also as\nexploring the conditions concepts must meet if they are to figure in\ngenuinely coherent love stories. Her story isn\u2019t about a lover\nwho abandons the individual boys he loves, but about someone who comes\nto love boys successfully by coming to love something else as\nwell.\n\nLike Diotima herself, we have been concentrating on what other things\na lover is led to love by his love for his beloved boy. We have said\nnothing about the changes explorations in this enlarged erotic field\neffect in the desires and feelings of the lover himself. But these,\ntoo, help us to see what happens to his love for his boy in the course\nof his explorations. What hooks the lover to begin with is love for a\nparticular body: \u201cFirst, if the Leader leads aright, he should\nlove one body and beget beautiful accounts there\u201d\n(210a6\u20138). At this stage, what the boy engages in the lover is\nhis sexual desire for physical beauty, albeit one which, in firm\nkeeping with the norms of Athenian paiderastia, is supposedly\naim-inhibited: instead of sexual intercourse, it leads to discussions\nabout beauty and to accounts of it. Here the beauty at issue is, in\nthe first instance, the boy who represents beauty itself to the\nlover. That is why, when the lover finally comes to see the\nbeautiful itself, \u201cbeauty will no longer seem to you to be\nmeasured by gold or raiment or beautiful boys or youths, which now you\nlook upon dumbstruck\u201d (211d3\u20135). One effect of generating\naccounts of this beauty, however, is that the lover comes to\nsee his beloved\u2019s beautiful body as one among many: if it is\nbeautiful, so are any other bodies the accounts fit. And this\ninitially cognitive discovery leads to a conative change:\n\u201cRealizing this he is established as a lover of all beautiful\nbodies and relaxes this excessive preoccupation with one, thinking\nless of it and believing it to be a small matter\u201d\n(210b4\u20136).\n\nIt is important in reading Diotima\u2019s description of this change\nthat we see it as comparative and contrastive: the lover used to\novervalue his beloved (211d5\u20138, quoted below)\u2014now\nhe values him appropriately. But valuing appropriately is\nstill valuing. The boy is still included in the class of beautiful\nbodies the lover now loves. It is also important to notice that\ncognitive and conative change are going hand-in-hand. To recognize\nthat his beloved is one among many, the lover\u2019s love for him has\nto change. And that means that psychological resources within the\nlover\u2014beyond his sexual responsiveness to physical\nbeauty\u2014are coming into play. More of the lover is now involved\nin his love. Hence what his beloved might be thought to lose in\nexclusivity he gains in richness\u2014and no doubt in endurance and\nreliability\u2014of response. When his physical bloom fades, he will\nnow still be loved.\n\nBut love that is to escape frustration cannot stop with bodies. The\nattempt to formulate an account of love free from puzzles and immune\nto elenctic refutation must lead on from beautiful bodies to beautiful\nsouls, and so to the beautiful laws and practices that will improve\nsouls and make young men better. Again this cognitive achievement is\nmatched by a conative one. When the lover sees that all these\nbeautiful things are somehow akin in the beauty, he comes to think\nthat \u201cbodily beauty is a small thing\u201d (210c5\u20136), and\nso, as before, becomes less obsessed with it.\n\nAt the top of the scala amoris lies the beautiful itself, the\nfirst loved object that\u2014like the \u201cprimary object of love\u201d\n(pr\u00f4ton philon) in the Lysis\n(219d2-e4)\u2014is not in any way gone beyond. Here, it seems, the\nlover at last finds something worthy of the obsessive attention he had\nonce lavished on his beloved boy (211d8\u2013212a7). Nonetheless,\nobsession is out of place even here. For the beautiful itself can no\nmore satisfy the lover\u2019s desires to eat and drink than his\nbeloved can. Here\u2014as there\u2014what he would do if it were\npossible must not be confused with what he can and does do. After all,\nthe lover himself cannot become immortal except by giving birth in the\nbeauty he has at last found. He does that, however, precisely by\narranging for his beloved to grow up, become truly virtuous, and be\nwith him in the contemplation of\u2014and, to the extent that it is\npossible, the possession of\u2014true beauty.\n5. The Art and Psychology of Love Explained\n\nIn the Phaedrus we find a more detailed account of the\npsychology and art of love than in the Symposium. This\naccount will be our exclusive focus. The soul, whether divine or\nhuman, Socrates claims, is like \u201cthe natural union of a team of\nwinged horses and their charioteer\u201d (246a6\u20137). But whereas\nin a divine soul all three elements are \u201cgood and come from good\nstock,\u201d in a human soul the white horse (familiar from\nRepublic IV as the honor-loving spirited element) is\n\u201cbeautiful and good, and of similar stock,\u201d while the\nblack one (the Republic\u2019s appetitive element) is\n\u201cthe opposite and of the opposite stock,\u201d so that\n\u201cthe driving in our case is necessarily difficult and\ntroublesome\u201d (a7-b4). When spirit together with the charioteer\n(the Republic\u2019s rational element, there too identified\nwith what is truly human rather than bestial in us\n(588b10\u2013589a4)) \u201cleads us towards what is best and is in\ncontrol,\u201d we possess moderation\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) (237e2\u20133). But when\n\u201cappetite drags us irrationally towards pleasures and rules in\nus, its rule is called excess (hubris)\u201d\n(238a1\u20132). Of this excess, gluttony is one species, but erotic\nlove another (238b7-c4). This is the bad kind of love\u2014Pandemotic\nin the Symposium\u2014that Lysias rightly disparages in the\nspeech Phaedrus admires and reads to Socrates (230e6\u2013234c5).\n\nIn Socrates\u2019 view, however, there is also another kind of love,\nnamely, \u201cthe madness of a man who, on seeing beauty here on\nearth, and being reminded of true beauty, becomes winged, and\nfluttering with eagerness to fly upwards, but unable to leave the\nground, looks upwards like a bird, and takes no heed of things\nbelow\u2014and that is what causes him to be regarded as mad\u201d\n(249d5-e1). This madman is the philosopher of the Symposium,\nwho when he falls in love with a boy is led by his love to ascend by\nstages to the form of the beautiful. What makes his madness a divine\ngift, however, is that the ascent is now revealed as involving\nrecollection of a prior pre-natal ascent taken in the company of a\ngod.\n\nFrom the rich literary account of this ascent, we need to take away\njust one idea: souls have different psychological structures depending\non which god they followed, since this sets an upper limit on how much\nof the forms they see, and so how much they can subsequently\nrecollect. Since gaining access to forms nourishes and strengthens the\nrational element in the soul (248b5-c2), this also helps determine\ntheir motivational structure: the stronger their reason is, the more\nlikely it will be to succeed in controlling the other elements in the\nsoul.\n\nFollowers of Zeus, for example, choose someone to love whose soul\nresembles their patron god. So they seek someone who is\n\u201cnaturally disposed to philosophy and leadership, and when they\nhave found him and fall in love they do everything to make him\nphilosophical\u201d (252e1\u20135). Nonetheless, the falling itself\ninvolves a huge psychological upheaval. The black horse of appetite\nimmediately urges towards sexual intercourse. The white\nhorse\u2014\u201cconstrained then as always by shame\u201d\n(254a2)\u2014holds itself back. Eventually, however, the black horse\nforces both the charioteer and the white horse \u201cto move towards\nthe beloved and mention to him the delights of sex\u201d\n(a5\u20137). Again they balk, \u201cindignant at being forced to do\nterrible and improper things\u201d (b1). But finally, \u201cwhen\nthere is no limit to their plight, they follow its lead, giving in and\nagreeing to do what it tells them\u201d (b2\u20133). As they come\nclose to the beloved, however, to initiate intercourse, the flashing\nface of the beloved reminds the charioteer of the beautiful itself, so\nthat his memory \u201cagain sees it standing together with temperance\non a holy pedestal\u201d (b5\u20137). He becomes frightened and\n\u201cin sudden reverence falls on his back, and is forced at the\nsame time to pull back the reins so violently as to bring the horses\ndown on their haunches, the one willingly, because of it lack of\nresistance to him, but the unruly horse much against its will\u201d\n(b7-c3). Eventually, \u201cwhen the same thing happens to the evil\nhorse many times, it allows the charioteer with his foresight to\nlead\u201d (e5\u20137). If this control of appetite by reason and\nspirit continues\u2014even when the boy has accepted his lover and\nembraces, kisses, and lies down with him\u2014and draws them to\n\u201ca well-ordered life and to philosophy,\u201d they are\nblessedly happy here on earth, and, if they live such a life for three\nsuccessive incarnations, they re-grow their wings and re-join the\nentourage of their god (255e2-b7).\n\nWhen followers of Ares fall in love, on the other hand, they\n\u201cadopt a lower way of living, not philosophical, but\nhonor-loving\u201d (256b7-c1). When they are drinking together, for\nexample, or are careless in some other way, \u201cthe licentious\nhorses in the two of them catch their souls off guard,\u201d and\nsince the man\u2019s recollection of beauty is dimmer and is not\nrekindled by philosophical conversation, they end up having sex\ntogether\u2014something \u201cthe masses regard as the happiest\nchoice of all\u201d (c1\u20135). Nonetheless, they don\u2019t have\nsex very often, because \u201cwhat they are doing has not been\napproved by their whole mind\u201d (c6\u20137). So while the degree\nof their love and happiness is less than the philosophical pair and,\non their death, \u201cthey leave the body without wings,\u201d still\nthey have an impulse, coming from love, to try to gain them. Hence\nthey aren\u2019t punished in the next life, but helped on the way to\nfuture happiness together (c7-e2).\n\nThe love that is divine madness is a good thing, therefore, especially\nwhen, \u201caccompanied by philosophical discussions (er\u00f4ta\nmeta philosoph\u00f4n log\u00f4n)\u201d (257b6), it leads to\nthe beautiful itself and the other forms, which are what we\u2014as\nmost of all the rational element in our souls\u2014truly love and\ncrave. The question is what makes a discussion philosophical? What\nmakes it of the sort to be included in the true art of love that the\nphilosopher who loves the beautiful itself practices? The answer now\nproposed is that it must be a techn\u00ea or craft, and so\nmust have the defining characteristics of one. As applied to love\nitself, for example, it must begin with a definition of love, and\nreach its conclusions by ordering its discussion in relation to it\n(263d5-e3). And this definition, in turn, must be established by what\nSocrates refers to as collection and division (266b3\u20134).\n\nCollection is a process of \u201cperceiving together and bringing\ninto one form items that are scattered in many places\u201d\n(265d3\u20134). It is a process that we, unlike other animals, are\nable to engage in it, because our souls include a rational element\nthat has prior acquaintance with forms: \u201ca soul that never\n[prenatally] saw what is true cannot take a human shape, since a human\nbeing must understand what is said by relation to a form that is\nreached from many sense-perceptions being collected into one by\nreasoning\u201d (249b5-c1). (It is useful to compare this description\nwith the one given in Aristotle, Posterior Analytics II.\n19.)\n\nOnce a form has been reached in this way, division begins. This is a\nmatter of \u201ccutting the form up again, by relation to\n[sub-]forms, by relation to its natural joints\u201d (265e1-2). As an\nexample, Socrates cites the case of love itself:\n\njust as a single body naturally has its parts in pairs, with both\nmembers of each pair having the same name, and labeled respectively\nleft and right, so the two speeches regarded madness as naturally a\nsingle form in us. The one [Socrates\u2019 reorganized version of\nLysias\u2019 attack on love] cut off the part on the left side, then\ncutting it again, and not giving up until it had found among the parts\na love which is, as we say, \u201cleft-handed,\u201d and abused it\nwith full justice, while the other speech [Socrates\u2019 own defense\nof love] led us to the parts of madness on the right-hand side, and\ndiscovering and exhibiting a love which shares the same name as the\nother, but is divine, it praised it as a cause of our greatest goods.\n(265e4\u2013266b1)\n\n\nThus, while each speech tells only half the story, the two together\nshow how correct division should proceed. The goal, however,\nisn\u2019t just truth or correctness, but explanatory adequacy. Thus\nif the form in question \u201cis simple, we should\nconsider\u2026what natural capacity it has for acting and on what,\nor for being acted upon and by what,\u201d and if it is complex, we\nshould count its sub-forms, and consider the same things about them as\nabout the simple ones (270d3\u20137). That Socrates\u2014the\narchetypal searcher for explanatory definitions (Euthyphro\n6d9-e6)\u2014should pronounce himself \u201ca lover of these\ndivisions and collections\u201d is no surprise, therefore\n(266b3\u20134).\n\nPhilosophy aims at true definitions and true stories based on them.\nBut it also aims at persuasion, since the philosophical lover wants to\npersuade his boy to follow him on the path to the forms. Philosophy\nand rhetoric must thus go together, which means that rhetoric, too,\nmust be developed as a techn\u00ea. It must, first,\ndistinguish and give definitions of the various kinds of souls and\nkinds of speeches, revealing their respective capacities and\nsusceptibilities, and, second, \u201ccoordinate each kind of soul\nwith the kind of speech appropriate to it, explaining why one kind of\nsoul is necessarily convinced by one kind of speech, while another is\nnot\u201d (271b1\u20135). Mastery of such a science, however,\nrequires one further thing: \u201cthe student must observe these\nthings as they are in real life, and actually being put into practice,\nand be able to follow them with keen perception\u201d (d8-e1). It\nisn\u2019t enough, in other words, to know what kinds of speeches\naffect what kinds of soul, the philosophical rhetorician must also\nknow that this man in front of him is of such and such a kind, and be\nable to talk in the kind of way that will prove convincing to him\n(e2\u2013272b2).\n6. Writing About Love\n\nAt the end of the Symposium, Alcibiades has gone off,\npresumably with the throng of Bacchic revelers, who burst into his\nlife as representatives of his overpowering love for the approval and\nflattery of the crowd. Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon are left\nbehind discussing tragedy and comedy: \u201cthe main point was that\nSocrates was trying to prove to them that the same man knows\n(epistasthai) how to write both comedy and tragedy, that\nsomeone who is by craft (techn\u00ea) a tragic poet is a\ncomic poet too\u201d (223d2\u20136).\n\nThe key words here, as we learn in the Ion, are\nepistasthai and techn\u00ea. Ordinary poets cannot\nwrite both comedy and tragedy, because they do not write out of\nknowledge and craft (techn\u00ea) but out of divine\ninspiration (Ion 534c5\u20136). If they did write out of\ncraft and knowledge, if they were craftsmen poets, they would\nbe able to write both comedy and tragedy, because opposites are always\nstudied by the same craft. Thus the comedic craft and the tragic craft\nwould have to be one and the same; just as one and the same craft,\nmedicine, deals with both sickness and health.\n\nSocrates tells us what a craftsman poet would be able to\nwrite, he does not tell us what he would write. Other\nPlatonic spokesmen are somewhat more forthcoming. \u201cWe ourselves\nare poets,\u201d the Athenian Stranger tells us in the Laws,\n\u201cwho have to the best of our ability created a tragedy that is\nthe finest and the best; at any rate, our entire constitution is\nconstructed as an imitation of the finest and best way of\nlife\u2014the very thing which we claim is the truest tragedy\u201d\n(817b1\u20135). Earlier in the same discussion, the Stranger is\nequally explicit that this same constitution, though not a comedy,\ndoes nonetheless embody comedic knowledge:\n\nSomeone who is going to gain practical wisdom can\u2019t learn\nserious matters without learning ridiculous ones, or anything else,\nfor that matter, without its opposite. But if we intend to acquire\nvirtue, even on a small scale, we can\u2019t be serious and comic\ntoo, and this is precisely why we must learn to recognize what is\nridiculous, to avoid being trapped by our ignorance of it into doing\nor saying something ridiculous, when we don\u2019t have to.\n(816d5-e5)\n\nThe Laws is a tragedy, then, because it is \u201can\nimitation of the finest and best way of life.\u201d\n\nThe Symposium is a tragedy for an analogous reason: it\ncontains an imitation of one part of such a life, namely, what the\nProtagoras terms a \u201csymposium of beautiful and good\nmen\u201d who \u201ctest each other\u2019s mettle in mutual\nargument\u201d by asking and answering questions (347d3\u2013348a9).\nThis is how Socrates responds to Agathon\u2019s speech. It is how\nDiotima converses with Socrates. It is the type of symposium Socrates\ntries to re-establish when Alcibiades\u2019 \u201csatyr-play\u201d\nis finished, and the throng of Bacchic revelers has left.\n\nUnlike the Laws, however, the Symposium is a comedy\ntoo, since it also contains an imitation of the second best kind of\nsymposium described in the Protagoras\u2014one where there\nare poets present, and where the participants \u201cargue over points\nthat can\u2019t be established with any certainty\u201d\n(347e1\u20137). An accurate description, surely, of the speeches made\nby all the symposiasts who speak prior to Socrates.\n\nFinally, Alcibiades arrives with\u2014significantly enough\u2014a\nflute-girl (212c5-e3; compare 176e6-7). And though she does not play,\nher arrival inaugurates the further decline of the symposium into\nsomething even more like the kind of symposium reviled in the\nProtagoras as \u201ca symposium of common, vulgar\nfellows\u2026 who, unable to entertain one another with their own\nconversation, put up the price of flute-girls, and pay large sums to\nhear the sound of the flute instead of their own talk\u201d\n(347c4-d2). This is the element of satyr-play in the\nSymposium\u2014satyr imagery is frequent in\nAlcibiades\u2019\n speech.[2]\n\nThe idea is the one mentioned earlier. Some love stories\u2014the\ngood ones\u2014are tragedies (in the special sense of the term\nintroduced in the Laws): they involve the kind of love found\nin the best kind of life, a life that comes as close as possible to\nthe divine\u2014one in which we achieve happiness by having good\nthings be ours forever (205d1\u2013206a12). Other love stories are\ncomedies: they involve a lesser kind of love. Others still are satyr\nplays: genital farces. But the true story of love, the story that is\nPlato\u2019s Symposium itself, is the story of all these\nstories. In the Symposium, it takes the form appropriate to\nits genre and audience. But in the Phaedrus, we learn of the\nlonger more technical road it might take in the future, when armed\nwith a scientific psychology and rhetoric it becomes a matter for\nexperts.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, R.
