    "main_text": "Objections to Consequentializing\n4. Objections to Consequentializing\n\nConsequentializing has its fair share of detractors. Some deny that\nit\u2019s possible to consequentialize every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory. Others see it as possible but consider it\na mere gimmick. Others, still, take it to be possible and more than a\nmere gimmick but find the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheories to be explanatorily inadequate. Unfortunately, though, those\nleveling such objections haven\u2019t always been careful to note\nthat there are different types of consequentializing and that many of\nthese objections apply only to certain types. Below, I\u2019ll\nconsider these and other objections to consequentializing as well as\nwhich types of consequentializing are subject to them.\n",
