Mally\u2019s Formal Language\n\nMally based his formal system on the classical propositional calculus\nas formulated in Whitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (vol.\u00a01, 1910).\n\nThe non-deontic part of Mally\u2019s system had the following vocabulary:\nthe sentential letters A, B, C, P and Q (these symbols refer to states\nof affairs), the sentential variables M and N, the sentential\nconstants V (the Verum, Truth) and \u039b (the\nFalsum, Falsity), the propositional quantifiers \u2203 and\n\u2200, and the connectives \u00ac, &, \u2228, \u2192 and \u2194.\n\u039b is defined by \u039b = \u00acV.\n\nThe deontic part of Mally\u2019s vocabulary consisted of the unary\nconnective !, the binary connectives f and \u221e, and the sentential\nconstants U and \u2229.\n\nMally read !A as \u201cA ought to be the case\u201d (A soll\nsein) or as \u201clet A be the case\u201d (es sei\nA).\nHe read A f B as \u201cA requires B\u201d (A fordert\nB).\nHe read A \u221e B as \u201cA and B require each\nother.\u201d\nHe read U as \u201cthe unconditionally obligatory\u201d (das\nunbedingt Geforderte).\nHe read \u2229 as \u201cthe unconditionally forbidden\u201d\n(das unbedingt Verbotene).\n\n\nf, \u221e and \u2229 are defined by:\n\n\nDef. f .\nA f B = A \u2192 !B (Mally 1926, p.\u00a012) \n\nDef. \u221e .\nA \u221e B = (A f B) & (B f A) \n\nDef. \u2229.\n\u2229 = \u00acU \n\n\nMally did not only read !A as \u201cit ought to be the case that\nA.\u201d Because a person\u2019s willing that a given state of affairs A\nbe the case is often expressed by sentences of the form \u201cA ought\nto be the case\u201d (for example, someone might say \u201cit ought\nto be the case that I am rich and famous\u201d to indicate that she\nwants to be rich and famous), he also read !A as \u201cA is\ndesirable\u201d or \u201cI want it to be the case that A.\u201d As\na result, his formal system was as much a theory about Wollen\n(willing) as a theory about Sollen (ought to be the case).\nThis explains the subtitle of his book. In modern deontic logic, the\nbasic deontic connective O is seldom read in this way.\n\nWe have just described one respect in which Mally\u2019s deontic logic was\ndifferent from more modern proposals. There are two other conspicuous\ndifferences:\n\nMally was only interested in the deontic status of states of\naffairs; he paid no special attention to the deontic status of\nactions. Thus, his Deontik was a theory about\nSeinsollen (what ought to be the case) rather than\nTunsollen (what ought to be done). Modern authors often\nregard the concept of Tunsollen as fundamental.\nIn modern deontic logic, the notions of prohibition F, permission\nP and waiver W are usually defined in terms of obligation O: FA =\nO\u00acA, PA = \u00acFA, WA = \u00acOA. Such definitions are not to be\nfound in Mally\u2019s book.\n\n",
