    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLa Forge was born on 24 or 26 November 1632 in La Fl\u00e8che, in\nthe Loire valley in central France, the same town in which Descartes\nhad attended college between 1607 and 1615. He became a medical doctor,\nand then moved to Saumur, where he married Ren\u00e9e Bizard in 1653.\nHe practised medicine at Saumur until his premature death in 1666.\nThere had been a Huguenot college at Saumur since 1599, when it was\nfounded by Philippe Duplessis-Mornay (1549\u20131623). Mo\u00efse Amyraut (1596\u20131664) and\nRobert Chouet (1642\u20131731) were among the notable contemporary\nscholars who taught there. There was also an Oratorian school (the\nColl\u00e8ge royal des Catholiques) and an adjoining seminary\nin the same town, at Notre Dame des Ardilliers. A number of\nCatholic philosophers had studied in the latter, including Bernard Lamy\n(1640\u20131715) and, for a brief period, Nicolas Malebranche. Both\ncolleges were receptive to the \u2018new\u2019 philosophy of\nCartesianism and, apparently, their staff members enjoyed more amicable\nrelations than might have been expected from the history of the\nreligious traditions that they represented. Following revocation of the\nEdict of Nantes (1685), the Calvinist college was razed, while\nNotre Dame des Ardilliers survives as a school to this day.\n\nLa Forge became acquainted with Cartesianism when he studied at La\nFl\u00e8che, and he continued his interest while practicing medicine\nat Saumur, where he had opportunities to discuss philosophy with other\nsympathetic readers of Descartes at both the Oratorian school and at\nthe Reformed Academy, especially with Chouet. Although he lived in the\nprovinces, he corresponded with some leading Cartesians of the period,\nincluding G\u00e9raud de Cordemoy (1626\u201384), who published his\nown contribution to Cartesianism in the same year as La Forge (Cordemoy\n1666). When Claude Clerselier (1614\u201384) began to edit\nDescartes\u2019 works and prepare them for publication, he acquired\nmanuscript copies of two of his unpublished essays entitled\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme and Description du Corps\nHumain, both of which have since been lost. The\nTrait\u00e9 was the second part of a book that Descartes had\nplanned to publish as Trait\u00e9 de la lumi\u00e8re.\nHowever, those plans were deferred indefinitely when news of\nGalileo\u2019s condemnation reached Holland in 1633 and, as a result,\nthe Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme remained unpublished during\nits author\u2019s lifetime. Nonetheless, Descartes retained the\nmanuscript throughout his peripatetic life; he also appears to have\nmade at least two copies for friends (Otegem, 2002: II, 485\u2013536),\nthrough whom in turn his physiological studies acquired a limited\ndissemination. In 1648, Descartes revisited his early work in\nphysiology; he reported that it was almost illegible, due to the\ncondition of the manuscript, and he began to draft a supplementary\nsketch of the conception and birth of animals in a manuscript entitled\nDescription du Corps Humain.\n\nBoth unpublished texts were still in poor condition when Descartes\ndied in 1650. Among other deficiencies, they lacked most of the\ndiagrams that were required to make his theory intelligible to readers, which Descartes had been unable to draw. Since\nClerselier was equally incapable of providing adequate illustrations,\nhe invited various people to prepare them. A number of those who\nunderstood Cartesian physiology (including Henricus Regius) refused to\ncooperate. Clerselier eventually identified two willing collaborators;\none was Louis de la Forge, in Saumur, and the other was Gerard van\nGutschoven (1615\u201368), a professor of anatomy in Louvain.\nClerselier accepted both offers of assistance and published their\nillustrations in the first edition. When the results of their artistic\nefforts coincided, he usually preferred those of Gutschoven because\nthey were better drawn; however, when they differed, he published both\nand used the letters \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 to identify\ntheir respective authors. La Forge was thus credited with seven\nof the published illustrations. Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Homme, with these illustrations and extensive notes by La\nForge, was published in Paris in April 1664. Thus La Forge\u2019s first publication was the lengthy set of notes that explain various\nfeatures of Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9, which appeared as\nRemarques on pp. 171\u2013408 of the first French edition of\nthat work. Meantime, Florentius Schuyl (1619\u00ad\u201369) had already\npublished independently a Latin translation of the manuscript of the\nTrait\u00e9 in 1662, under the title De Homine\n(Descartes 1662).\n\nWhile preparing his explanatory notes for the French edition of\nDescartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme, La Forge\nadverted to the opening sentences of that book, which referred to the\nhypothetical men described in it:\n\n\n These men will be composed, as\nwe are, of a soul and body. First I must describe the body on its own;\nthen the soul, again on its own; and finally I must show how these two\nnatures would have to be joined and united in order to constitute men\nwho resemble us. (CSM I, 98)\n\n\n Since Descartes died\nbefore he had completed even the first of these three stages, La Forge\ndecided to fill the lacuna by developing what he believed Descartes would have\nwritten about the human mind and its union with the body had he had\ntime to complete his theory, and he did so by borrowing extensively from\nDescartes\u2019 published and unpublished work. The result was the Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Esprit de l\u2019Homme, which was composed contemporaneously with La Forge\u2019s commentary on Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9\nde l\u2019Homme, and in which he referred on numerous occasions\nto a work in progress on the human mind (H 172, 262, 299, 315,\n334, 335). This treatise was printed in Paris in November\n1665, although the publication date on the title page was 1666.\n\nThere is no official record of La Forge\u2019s death. However,\nClerselier confirmed in the preface to the third volume of\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence (which was printed in September 1666)\nthat La Forge had died soon after publishing his Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Esprit de l\u2019Homme (Clerselier 1667: Preface\n\u00e32). It seems likely that he died sometime in early 1666, at the\nage of thirty-three.\n",
