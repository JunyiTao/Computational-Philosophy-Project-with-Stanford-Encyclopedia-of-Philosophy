    "main_text": "\n\nThe Presocratics were 6th and 5th century BCE\nGreek thinkers who introduced a new way of inquiring into the world\nand the place of human beings in it. They were recognized in antiquity\nas the first philosophers and scientists of the Western tradition.\nThis article is a general introduction to the most important\nPresocratic philosophers and the main themes of Presocratic thought.\nMore detailed discussions can be found by consulting the articles on\nthese philosophers (and related topics) in the SEP (listed below).\n\nFor over a century, the standard collection of texts for the\nPresocratics has been that by H. Diels revised by W. Kranz\n(abbreviated as DK). DK provides the original language of the texts,\nusually Greek or Latin, with translation in German. In 2016, a new\ncollection was published by A. Laks and G. Most with original texts\nand translation into English (abbreviated as LM; a version with French\ntranslations was also published in 2016). In DK, each thinker is\nassigned an identifying chapter number (e.g., Heraclitus is 22,\nAnaxagoras 59); then the reports from ancient authors about that\nthinker\u2019s life and thought are collected in a section of\n\u201ctestimonies\u201d (A) and numbered in order, while the\npassages the editors take to be direct quotations are collected and\nnumbered in a section of \u201cfragments\u201d (B). Alleged\nimitations in later authors are sometimes added in a section labeled\nC. Thus, each piece of text can be uniquely identified: DK59B12.3\nidentifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12; DK22A1 identifies\ntestimonium 1 on Heraclitus.\n\nA similar system is adopted in LM. (LM provide helpful concordances to\nDK.) Section P contains passages dealing with the life and works of\nthe author (overlapping in some ways with DK\u2019s A section);\nsection D includes passages covering doctrine with direct quotations\nin boldface font (thus overlapping with DKB and somewhat with DKA);\nand a section R includes reaction to the author (Reception) and texts\nthe editors deem to be ancient forgeries or imitations. Like DK, LM\nassign an identifying number to each thinker and numbers to each piece\nof text: LM25D27 picks out Anaxagoras (25) doctrine number 27 (=\nDK59B12), LM25P37 is the same text as DK59A30, and LM25D94 is DK59A117.\n",
