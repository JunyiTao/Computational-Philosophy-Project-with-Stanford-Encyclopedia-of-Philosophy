    "main_text": "Debates in Contemporary Political Theory || Republican Nondomination and Global Democracy\n2.3 Republican Nondomination and Global Democracy\n\nDemocratic, republican and critical theorists have become concerned\nwith the global context of order and justice due to its importance for\nestablishing protective external conditions for the moral and\npolitical achievements of centuries of domestic democratic political\nstruggle. Traditionally, the main global threat was interstate war,\nthus the projects for perpetual peace. Today, democratic theorists\nworry that contemporary processes of globalization are undermining the\nachievements of democratic societies in the areas of civil and social\nrights such as access to education and healthcare, and the economic\nsecurities provided by the welfare state. From this perspective,\neconomic globalization and the growing power of international and\ntransnational institutions pose a potential threat to democratic\nideals of civic equality and self-determination. The task of the\ndemocratic theorist is to think about how democracies can respond to\nthese global developments in ways that best help preserve the fragile\nachievements of domestic democratic justice (Habermas 2004 [2006]; see\nalso Scheuerman 2008). Increasingly, theorists of global democratic\nreform envisage the need to develop new institutions and practices of\nrepresentation and accountability rather than merely to extend\ntraditional constitutional models and electoral mechanisms of domestic\ndemocratic governance (Archibugi 2008; Macdonald 2008; Marchetti 2008;\nTinnevelt 2012; Tanyi 2019; Erman 2019).\n\nKey to discussions in democratic, republican and critical theory about\nglobal order and justice is the political ideal of nondomination.\nNeo-republican theorist Philip Pettit understands commitment to this\nideal to entail reducing people\u2019s vulnerability to alien control\nor the arbitrary power of others to interfere with their choices and\ntheir lives. In the international context, Pettit has outlined a\n\u201crepublican law of peoples\u201d that has the twin goals of\nensuring that every people is represented by a non-dominating\ngovernment in a non-dominating international order (2010). Starting\nwith a world of states, Pettit argues that a state which is\n\u201ceffective and representative of its people\u201d fulfills the\nrepublican ideal of nondomination, and \u201cit would be\nobjectionably intrusive of other agents in the international\norder\u201d to bypass such states and assume responsibility for its\nmembers (2010: 71\u20132). A legitimate international order is\none\n\n\nin which effective, representative states avoid\ndomination\u2014whether by another state, or by a non-state\nbody\u2014and seek to enable other states to be effective and\nrepresentative too. (2010: 73)\n\n\nIn an international context, the sources of domination include other\nstates; \u201cnon-domestic, private bodies\u201d such as\n\u201ccorporations, churches, terrorist movements, even powerful\nindividuals\u201d; and \u201cnon-domestic, public bodies\u201d such\nas the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (2010: 77). While representative states\nrealize nondomination internally for their members, individuals\u2019\nenjoyment of freedom as nondomination is not secured unless their\nstates are protected in their external relations from dominating\nstrategies, including \u201cintentional obstruction, coercion,\ndeception, and manipulation\u201d as well as\n\u201cinvigilation\u201d, and \u201cintimidation\u201d (2010:\n74).\n\nPettit\u2019s account presupposes the legitimacy of domestic\ndemocracies that ensure nondomination as a starting point for thinking\nabout a legitimate international order, and he explicitly rejects the\nidea of a world state, modeled on a domestic republican regime, as an\ninfeasible remedy for the challenges posed by domination in an\ninternational context (2010: 81; but see Koenig-Archibugi 2011). There\nis no easy solution, but Pettit considers feasible improvements to the\ncurrent international order can be made by further developing\nmultilateral\n\n\ninternational agencies and forums by means of which states can work\nout their problems and relations in a space of more or less common\nreasons\n\n\nas well as fostering greater solidarity among subgroups of weaker\nstates so that they can form rival blocs that can resist domination by\nmore powerful agents (2010: 84). While Pettit is mostly concerned with\nthe dominating potential of powerful states, and considers\ninternational agencies to be less threatening (2010: 86),\nC\u00e9cile Laborde adds to Pettit\u2019s account not only a\nconcern for agent-relative domination, but also, and more centrally,\nsystemic domination, which entails a greater awareness of the\ndominating potential of international organizations such as the\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization and the World\nBank (2010). One of the ways that powerful states dominate weak states\nis by \u201centrenching and institutionalizing\u201d their dominant\nposition through unfair international social structures in areas such\nas trade (2010: 57).\n\nIndeed, Nancy Kokaz, in a republican interpretation of Rawls\u2019s\nLaw of Peoples, argues that \u201ca global republic cannot\nbe dismissed by a civic [republican] theory of global justice\u201d\n(2005: 94). The civic pluralist ideal that is threatened by the advent\nof global capitalism and ensuing deracination requires \u201ca global\nstate powerful enough to protect local communities\u201d from the\nhomogenizing tendencies and \u201cexcesses of global\ncapitalism\u201d (2005: 93). In a further development of republican\nideas about global order and justice, James Bohman has argued that a\nrepublican ideal of freedom as nondomination in the new global\n\u201ccircumstances of politics\u201d requires political struggle in\nthe direction of transnational democracy (2004 and 2007). According to\nBohman,\n\n\nunder conditions of globalization, freedom from tyranny and domination\ncannot be achieved without extending our political ideals of\ndemocracy, community and membership. (2004: 352)\n\n\nNot only are currently bounded democratic communities ineffective in\nresisting new global sources and forms of domination, they are also\n\u201cpotentially self-defeating\u201d, constituting\n\n\na thousand tiny fortresses in which the oldest form of domination is\npracticed at many different levels: the domination of noncitizens by\ncitizens, or nonmembers by members, using their ability to command\nnoninterference much like those who live within gated communities.\n(2007: 175 and 180)\n\n\nDaniele Archibugi has termed this\n\n\ndemocratic schizophrenia: to engage in a certain [democratic] behavior\non the inside and indulge in the opposite [undemocratic] behavior on\nthe outside. (2008: 6)\n\n\nSuch vicious circles of \u201cdemocratic domination\u201d can only\nbe overcome by making borders, membership and jurisdiction the\nsubjects of democratic deliberation across d\u00eamoi\n(Bohman 2007: 179). Whether or not democracy serves global justice\ndepends on the possibility of transnational democratization, and\nBohman sees two primary agents of such transformation, in democratic\nstates pursuing \u201cbroadly federalist and regional projects of\npolitical integration\u201d, such as the European Union, and in the\nless institutionalized activities of \u201cparticipants in\ntransnational public spheres and associations\u201d (2007: 189).\nWhile some think that the formal development of regional or global\ninstitutions must be democratized in order to realize republican\nnondomination or democratic agency (Valentini 2012), others argue that\nglobal democracy may be justified mainly for its instrumental role in\nprotecting and promoting\n\n\nthe fundamental interests of all the world\u2019s citizens, rather\nthan by that of maximizing citizens\u2019 democratic agency\n\n\nat the global level (Weinstock 2006: 10).\n\nCritical theorist Iris Marion Young similarly calls for a global\npolitics of nondomination, that would support \u201ca vision of local\nand cultural autonomy in the context of global regulatory\nregimes\u201d (2002: 237). Her model of global\ngovernance\u2014\u201ca post-sovereign alternative to the existing\nstates system\u201d (2000: 238)\u2014entails a \u201cdecentred\ndiverse democratic federalism\u201d (2000: 253). While everyday\ngovernance would be primarily local, it would take place in the\ncontext of global regulatory regimes, built upon existing\ninternational institutions, that would be functionally defined to deal\nwith\n\n\n(1) peace and security, (2) environment, (3) trade and finance, (4)\ndirect investment and capital utilization, (5) communications and\ntransportation, (6) human rights, including labor standards and\nwelfare rights, (7) citizenship and migration. (2002: 267)\n\n\nYoung envisages these global regulatory regimes to apply not only to\nstates, but also to non-state organizations, such as corporations, and\nindividuals. In terms of feasibility, Young points to the development\nof a robust \u201cglobal public sphere\u201d (Habermas 1998) as\ncrucial to bringing about \u201cstronger global regulatory\ninstitutions tied to principles of global and local democracy\u201d\n(Young 2002: 272).\n\nIncreasingly, then, republican and democratic theorists view\ntransnational and supranational institutions not as intrinsic threats\nto democratic freedom and justice, but as potentially instrumental\ninstitutional developments that are necessary to fortify the\ncapacities of contemporary states to deliver on democratic and\nrepublican values. In this sense, supporting the development of\ntransnational democratic institutions is consistent with upholding the\nvalues of national identity and belonging, and the proper functioning\nof states, by providing a robust framework to coordinate and\ndiscipline states into solving problems of human rights and global\njustice in areas such as labor, health, migration, and taxation, in a\nmore fair, equitable, and non-dominating manner (Abizadeh 2008;\nRonzoni 2012; Valentini 2012; Dietsch 2015; Fine & Ypi 2016;\nCabrera 2018). Paradoxically, it may be that in conditions of\nglobalization, only a world state can provide the essential supporting\nconditions for all states, including democratic ones, to enjoy\neffective and legitimate collective self-determination (Lu 2018).\nThus, republican cosmopolitanism in the form of a world state may be\nless of an oxymoron than Pettit suggests.\n",
