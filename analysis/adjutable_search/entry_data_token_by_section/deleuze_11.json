    "main_text": "The Reception of Deleuze || The Badiouan critique\n6.2 The Badiouan critique\n\nOne of the most important criticisms of Deleuze was put forth in\nBadiou 1997. Badiou claimed, contrary to the dominant perception, that\nDeleuze is not so much a philosopher of the multiple as of the One.\nConducted in the highly technical idiom for which he is known, Badiou\ncriticizes Deleuze for a certain vitalism, which in Badiou\u2019s\neyes falls short of the axiomatic austerity demanded of philosophy.\nWhereas Badiou merely ignored the collaborative works with Guattari,\n\u017di\u017eek 2003 conducts a polemic against the Guattari\ncollaborations in favor of a Deleuzean logic of Being characterized as\nan \u201cimmaterial affect generated by interacting bodies as a\nsterile surface of pure Becoming\u201d (as in Logic of\nSense). A third critical work in this vein is Hallward 2005. For\nHallward, the singular logic of Deleuze\u2019s thought is analogous\nto the tradition of theophantic thinkers, whereby the divine spark of\ncreation is entombed in creatures; the task of the creature is to\nredeem that divine spark from its creatural prison. But this\nredemption is not annihilation; Deleuze\u2019s philosophy is not that\nof Lacanian-\u017di\u017eekian\n\u201crenunciation-extinction.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Badiouan critique, we can note that one of the most\npromising leads for future research in discussing the relation of\nBadiou and Deleuze is to concentrate on the type of mathematics each\nthinker prefers. Rather than accepting Badiou\u2019s characterization\nof Deleuze as a thinker of reality in biological terms (as opposed to\nBadiou\u2019s mathematical orientation), we should see Deleuze as\nproposing a \u201cproblematic\u201d version of mathematics, versus\nBadiou\u2019s axiomatic conception. This tack has been taken by Smith\n2003.\n",
