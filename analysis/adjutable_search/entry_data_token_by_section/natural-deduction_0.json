    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\u2018Natural deduction\u2019 designates a type of logical system\ndescribed initially in Gentzen (1934) and Ja\u015bkowski (1934). A\nfundamental part of natural deduction, and what (according to most\nwriters on the topic) sets it apart from other proof methods, is the\nnotion of a \u201csubproof\u201d \u2014 parts of a proof in which\nthe argumentation depends on temporary premises (hypotheses\n\u201cassumed for the sake of argument\u201d). In the\nFitch-Ja\u015bkowski presentation of natural deduction, subproofs are\nmarked off in a way that makes them immediately visible in a written\nproof; with other presentations it takes a bit more work to pick out\nthe formulas forming a subproof. That is, we are justified in\nconcluding without any assumption that \u201cif A then\nX\u201d, i.e., \\((A\\rightarrow X)\\), because we could create this\nsubproof. This assumption-making can occur also within some\npreviously-made assumption, so there needs to be some method that\nprevents mixing up of embedded conclusions. That example is but one of\na number of different types of \u201csubordinate proof\u201d types\nthat can be found in textbooks as well as in research contributions.\nIn the Suppes-Lemmon style of proof \u2014 which is often or even\nusually called a style of natural deduction \u2014 the proofs can and\nprobably should instead be seen as operating with sequents, and so (by\nour stipulative definition) is not really a system of natural\ndeduction, but (i) it resembles other forms of natural deduction (as\nin Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculi \\(\\mathcal{NJ}\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{NK}\\)) by having elimination rules, rather than the rules\nfor the introduction of formulas on the left side of sequence (in this\nit mirrors Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculi), and (ii) when one works\nwith it in practice it feels like natural deduction. (We discuss this\nstyle in Section 4.) Various of these different styles will be\nillustrated in this survey.\n\n\u2018Natural deduction\u2019 also designates the type of reasoning\nthat these logical systems embody, and it is the intuition of very\nmany writers on the notion of meaning\u2014meaning generally, but\nincluding in particular the meaning of the connectives behind active\nreasoning\u2014is based on the claim that meaning is defined\nby use. Much has been written in this area that categorizes\nsome important aspects of formal logic as manifesting this feature\nalso, and in particular that it is most clearly at the fore in natural\ndeduction.\n\nAlthough the first formal descriptions of natural deduction were in\n1934, its acceptance and popularity weren\u2019t manifested until the\n1950s and 1960s when a huge number of elementary logic textbooks were\npublished, different ones using variations on the central ideas of the\nfoundational works from\n 1934.[1]\n We shall only briefly touch on a few of the ways that the logical\nsystems of these elementary textbooks differ from the original works,\nbut it should be noted that some of these differences are thought (by\nsome scholars) to be so important as to distinguish \u201ctrue\nnatural deduction\u201d from some other types of formalisms that are\nsometimes also called natural deduction. (We describe such a\nsystem-wide difference in\n \u00a74.)\n\nAnd our mention of other types of logical systems brings to the fore\nthe topic of certain other classes of logical formalisms, some of\nwhich are already described in the original (Gentzen 1934), and\nanother in Gentzen (1936). We will use some space discussing various\nimportant distinctions among these related theories. Some modern\ntheorists call them all \u2018natural deduction\u2019 while others\n(including one of us) think of them as distinct theories of logic.\n\nOf course, most logicians and logic-oriented philosophers of language\nare not especially interested in the various formalisms of elementary\nlogic, but rather in some metatheoretic properties that different\nlogics manifest. We consider here a number of places where natural\ndeduction is thought to be superior to (or at least, different from)\nvarious other formalisms of the underlying logic. Some of these\ndifferences are purely formal in nature (such as Normalization and\nHarmony) while others concern issues of The One True\n Logic[2],\n Inferentialism, and various other philosophical positions. We will\nalso look at extensions of natural deduction beyond intuitionistic and\nclassical logics, such as modal and relevance logics. Some of these\nfeatures are discussed in the original Gentzen works, but much later\nresearch has shed further light on the intricacies involved.\n",
