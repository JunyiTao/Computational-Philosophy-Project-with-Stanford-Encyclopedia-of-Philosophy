    "main_text": "The \u2018Ages of the World\u2019\n4. The \u2018Ages of the World\u2019\n\nSchelling\u2019s work from his middle period (1809\u20131827) is\nusually referred to as the philosophy of the Ages of the\nWorld (WA = Weltalter), after the title\nof the unfinished work of that name he worked on in the period\n1809\u20131827. The work characteristic of this period begins with\nthe 1809 On the Essence of Human Freedom (FS\n= Freiheitsschrift) (written in Stuttgart). The WA philosophy\nis an attempt to explain the emergence of an intelligible world at the\nsame time as coming to terms with mind\u2019s inextricable relation\nto matter. The initial concern is to avoid Spinoza\u2019s fatalism,\nwhich he thinks renders the human freedom to do good and evil\nincomprehensible. Schelling\u2019s crucial objection is to the idea\nthat evil should be understood as merely another form of negativity\nwhich can be comprehended by insight into the inherent lack in all\nfinite parts of a totality, rather than as a positive fact relating to\nthe nature of human freedom. He now sees the fundamental\ncontradictions of the Naturphilosophie in terms of the\nrelationship of the intelligibility of nature and ourselves to a\nground without which there could be no intelligibility, but which is\nnot the explicable cause of intelligibility. In an attempt to get to\ngrips with the problem of the ground of the finite world Schelling\nintroduces a Kant-derived conception of \u2018willing\u2019 in the\nFS which will be influential for Schopenhauer\u2019s conception of\nthe Will: \u201cIn the last and highest instance there is no other\nbeing but willing. Willing is primal being, and all the predicates of\nprimal being only fit willing: groundlessness, eternity, being\nindependent of time, self-affirmation\u201d (SW I/7, p. 350).\nSchelling now establishes a more conflictual version of the structure\nof the identity philosophy. The \u2018ground\u2019 is\n\u2018groundless\u2019 \u2014 in the sense of\n\u2018uncaused\u2019 \u2014 and it must be understood in terms of\nfreedom if a Spinozist determinism is to be avoided. This means there\ncannot be an explanation of why there is the finite world, because\nthat would entail taking the ground as a cause and thus rendering\nfreedom non-existent.\n\nAt the same time Schelling insists there must be that against which\nfreedom can be manifest \u2014 a being which is not free and is\ntherefore necessitated \u2014 for it to be meaningful freedom at all.\nThe theory is based on the antagonisms between opposing forces which\nconstitute the \u2018ages of the world\u2019, the past, present, and\nfuture. He argues that the world whose origins the WA wishes to\nunderstand must entail the same conflicting forces which\nstill act, though not necessarily in the same form, in this\nworld, of which the mind is an aspect: \u201cPoured from the source\nof things and the same as the source, the human soul has a\nco-knowledge/con-science (Mitwissenschaft) of creation\u201d\n(WA, p. 4). Schelling suggests that there are two principles in us:\n\u201can unconscious, dark principle and a conscious\nprinciple\u201d, which must yet in some way be identical. The same\nstructure applies to what Schelling means by \u2018God\u2019. At\nthis point his account of the ground is not consistent, but this\ninconsistency points to the essential issue Schelling is trying to\nunderstand, namely whether philosophy can give a rational account of\nthe fact of the manifest world. As that which makes the world\nintelligible, God relates to the ground in such a way that the\n\u2018real\u2019, which takes the form of material nature, is\n\u2018in God\u2019 but \u201cis not God seen absolutely, i.e.\ninsofar as He exists; for it is only the ground of His existence, it\nis nature in God; an essence which is inseparable from God,\nbut different from Him\u201d (SW I/7, p. 358). The point is that God\nwould be just be some kind of inarticulable, static One if there were\nnot that which He transcends: without opposition, Schelling argues,\nthere is no life and no sense of development, which are the highest\naspects of reality. The aim of the move away from Spinoza is to avoid\nthe sense of a world complete in itself which would render freedom\nillusory because freedom\u2019s goal would already be determined as\nthe goal of the totality. Schelling starts to confront the idea that\nthe rational reconciliation of freedom and necessity that had been\nsought by Kant in the acknowledgement of the necessity of the law, and\nwhich was the aim of German Idealism\u2019s attempt to reconcile mind\nand nature, might be intrinsically unattainable.\n\nWolfram Hogrebe has claimed that the WA philosophy is an ontological\ntheory of predication. Being, as initially One and enclosed within\nitself, is not manifest, and has no reason to be manifest. Hogrebe\nterms this \u2018pronominal being\u2019. The same being\nmust also, given that there is now a manifest world, be\n\u2018predicative being\u2019, which \u201cflows out, spreads,\ngives itself\u201d (SW I/8, p. 210\u2013211). The contradiction\nbetween the two kinds of being is only apparent. Schelling maintains,\nin line with the identity philosophy, that the \u201cproperly\nunderstood law of contradiction really only says that the same cannot\nbe as the same something and also the opposite thereof, but\nthis does not prevent the same, which is A, being able, as an other,\nto be not A\u201d (SW I/8, p. 213\u20134). One aspect of being, the\ndark force, which he sometimes terms \u2018gravity\u2019, is\ncontractive, the other expansive, which he terms \u2018light\u2019.\nDynamic processes are the result of the interchange between these\nultimately identical forces. If they were wholly separate there would\neither be no manifest universe, because contraction would dominate, or\nthe universe would dissipate at infinite speed because expansion would\ndominate. The result would be the same: there would not be a world. If\nsomething is to be as something it must both be, in the\npositive sense in which everything else is, which makes it\nindeterminately positive, pronominal, and it must have a relationship\nto what it is not, in order to be determinate, which brings it into\nthe realm of predication by taking it beyond itself. In the WA the One\ncomes into contradiction with itself and the two forces constantly vie\nwith each other. Differences must, however, be grounded in unity, as\notherwise they could not be manifest at all as differences.\nThe ground is now increasingly regarded as the source of the\ntransitory nature of everything particular, and less and less as the\nsource of tranquil insight into how we can be reconciled to finite\nexistence. The mood of the WA is summed up in Schelling\u2019s\nreference to the \u201cveil of melancholy which is spread over the\nwhole of nature, the deep indestructible melancholy of all life\u201d\n(SW I/7, p. 399). The source of this melancholy is that everything\nfinite must \u2018go to ground\u2019 and that we are aware\nof this. Awareness thus both makes sense of things and yet is also\nwhat is underpinned by a negativity it must constantly seek to come to\nterms with.\n\nThe abandonment of his residual Spinozism leads Schelling to a growing\nconcern with the tensions which result from contradictions that are\nalso embodied in human beings. The ages of the world are constituted\nby the development of forms and structures in the material and the\nmental world. This development depends upon the expanding\nforce\u2019s interaction with the contracting force\u2019s slowing\nof any expansion, which allows transient but determinate forms to\ndevelop. This process also gives rise to language, which Schelling\nregards as the model for the development of the whole world because it\nmanifests how expansion and the release of tension can lead to\nintelligibility, rather than mere dissipation:\n\nIt seems universal that every creature which cannot contain itself or\ndraw itself together in its own fullness, draws itself together\noutside itself, whence e.g. the elevated miracle of the formation of\nthe word in the mouth belongs, which is a true creation of the full\ninside when it can no longer remain in itself. (WA I, p. 56\u20137)\n\n\nLanguage as \u2018contracted\u2019 material signifier, and\n\u2018expanding\u2019 ideal meaning repeats the basic structure of\nthe WA, and Schelling insists that, like the material world without\nthe \u2018ideal\u2019 capacity for expansion, language can become\n\u2018congealed\u2019. This interaction between what is contained in\nitself and what draws something beyond itself is also what gives rise\nto consciousness, and thus to an inherent tension within\nconsciousness, which can only be itself by its relation to an other.\nHegel uses a related model of subjectivity, but Schelling will come to\nreject Hegel\u2019s model for its failure to confront the ultimately\nirresolvable tension in all subjectivity. Schelling\u2019s later\nphilosophy will present a subject whose origin prevents it from ever\nachieving the \u2018self-presence\u2019 that Hegel tries to\nexplicate by setting out the complete structure of\n\u2018self-reflection\u2019 in the other. Schelling\u2019s WA\nphilosophy is never completed: its Idealist aim of systematically\nunifying subject and object by comprehending the real development of\nhistory from the very origins of being founders on problems concerning\nthe relationship between philosophical system and historical\ncontingency which do not admit of solutions. Furthermore, the\nstructures he develops lead him to ideas which take him beyond\nIdealism and make him one of the crucial precursors of existential and\nother non-Idealist forms of modern philosophy.\n",
