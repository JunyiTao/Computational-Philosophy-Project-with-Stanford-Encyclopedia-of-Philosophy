    "main_text": "The Classical-Utilitarian Calculus || Zero Discounting of Future Well-Beings\n2.1 Zero Discounting of Future Well-Beings\n\n\nIn equation (3), future values of \\(U\\) are not discounted when\nviewed from the present moment, \\(t\\). This particular move has\nprovoked more debate among economists and philosophers than any other\nfeature of Ramsey\u2019s theory of optimum saving. The debate has on\noccasion been shriller than even we economists are used to (see in\nparticular Nordhaus 2007). At the risk of generalizing wildly,\neconomists have favoured the use of positive rates to discount future\nwell-beings (e.g., Arrow and Kurz 1970), whereas philosophers have\ninsisted that the well-being of future people should be given the same\nweight as that of present people (e.g., Parfit 1984).\n\n\nWhat would Classical Utilitarianism with positive discounting of\nfuture well-beings look like? Let \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) be the rate at which\nit is deemed desirable to discount future well-beings (for simplicity\nwe take the discount rate to be constant). Then, in place of equations\n(2)\u2013(3), intergenerational well-being at \\(t\\), would read as\n\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\n\\begin{align}\nV(t) &= \\int^{\\infty}_t [U(\\tau)e^{-\\delta(\\tau -t)}]d\\tau \\\\\n     &= \\int^{\\infty}_t [U(C(\\tau))e^{-\\delta(\\tau -t)}]d\\tau, t \\ge 0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn equation (4), \\(\\delta\\) the \u201ctime discount rate\u201d and\n\\(e^{-\\delta}\\) the resulting \u201ctime discount factor.\u201d\n\n\\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) implies \\(e^{-\\delta} \\lt 1\\). That\nmeans \\(e^{-\\delta(\\tau -t)}\\) tends to\nzero exponentially as \\(\\tau\\) tends to infinity. In the latter\npart of his paper Ramsey (1928: 553\u2013555) did use equation (4) to study\nthe problem of optimum saving, but he did not approve of the\nformulation. Instead, he wrote (p. 543) that to discount later\n\\(U\\)\u2019s in comparison with earlier ones is \u201c\u2026 ethically\nindefensible and arises merely from the weakness of the imagination.\u201d\nIn a book that inaugurated the formal study of economic development,\nHarrod (1948: 40) followed suit by calling the practice a \u201c\u2026\npolite expression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by\npassion.\u201d\n\n\nStrong words, but to some economists, the Ramsey-Harrod stricture in\na deterministic world reads like a Sunday pronouncement. Solow (1974a:\n9) expressed this feeling exactly when he wrote, \u201cIn solemn conclave\nassembled, so to speak, we ought to act as if the [discount rate on\nfuture well-beings] were zero.\u201d\n\n\nBut the matter cannot be settled without a study of production and\nconsumption possibilities open to an economy. Consider the following\ntension between two sets of considerations:\n\nLow rates of consumption by generations sufficiently far into\nthe future would not be seen to be a bad thing by the current DM if\nfuture well-beings were discounted at a positive rate. So today\u2019s DM\nwould recommend high consumption rates for now and the near future even\nif that meant generations in the distant future would live in penury.\nBut if such a policy were followed, the demands of a further moral\nrequirement to Classical Utilitarianism that DM may hold, namely,\n\u201cintergenerational equity,\u201d would not be met. Therefore we should\nfollow Ramsey and not discount future well-beings.\nWrite \\(dF(K)/dK\\) as \\(F_K\\). From equation (1) it is simple to\ndeduce that \\(F_K\\) is the rate of return on investment. In\nRamsey\u2019s economy \\(F_K \\gt 0\\), which means every unit of output\nthat is saved yields more than a unit of future consumption, other\nthings equal. For example, if DM were to reduce consumption at \\(t\\)\nby a unit, the additional consumption that would be available in the\nbriefest of periods later \u2013 we write that as \\(\\Delta t\\)\n\u2013 without affecting consumption at any future date would be\n\\(1+[dF(K(t))/dK(t)]\\Delta t\\).  The productivity of capital is thus\ntied to the arrow of time, which creates a bias in favour of future\ngenerations. This bias gives bite to the adage, \u201cWe can do\nsomething for posterity, but what can posterity ever do for us?\u201d\nThe thought inevitably arises that perhaps the bias should be\ncountered in DM\u2019s calculus if some attention were to be given by\nher to intergenerational equity in realized well-being as a supplement\nto Classical Utilitarianism. That in turn suggests that DM should\nabandon Ramsey and discount future well-beings at a positive rate.\n\n\n\nThe force of each consideration has been demonstrated in the\neconomics literature. It has been shown in the context of a simple\nmodel that if production requires produced capital and exhaustible\nresources, then optimum consumption declines to zero in the long run if\nfuture well-beings are discounted at a positive rate (Dasgupta and\nHeal 1974), but increases indefinitely if we follow Ramsey in not\ndiscounting future well-beings (Solow 1974b). The exercises tell us\nthat the long-run features of optimum saving policies depend on the\nrelative magnitudes of the rate at which future well-beings are\ndiscounted and the long-term productivity of capital assets.\n\n\nThere is a more general point here, which was explored by Koopmans\n(1960, 1965, 1967, 1972) in a remarkable set of publications on the\nidea of economic development. In such complex exercises as those\ninvolving consumption and investment over a long time horizon, it is\nfoolish to regard any ethical principle (e.g., Classical\nUtilitarianism) as sacrosanct. One can never know in advance what it\nmay run up against. A more judicious tactic than Ramsey\u2019s would be to\nto play off one set of ethical assumptions against another in\nnot-implausible worlds, see what their implications are for the\ndistribution of well-being across generations, and then appeal to our\nintuitive senses before arguing over policy. Settling ex ante\nwhether to use a positive rate to discount future well-beings could be\na self-defeating\n move.[1]\n",
