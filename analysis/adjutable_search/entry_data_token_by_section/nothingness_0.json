    "main_text": "Why is there something rather than nothing?\n1. Why is there something rather than nothing?\n\nWell, why not? Why expect nothing rather than something? No experiment\ncould support the hypothesis \u2018There is nothing\u2019 because\nany observation obviously implies the existence of an observer.\n\nIs there any a priori support for \u2018There is\nnothing\u2019? One might respond with a methodological principle that\npropels the empty world to the top of the agenda. For instance, many\nfeel that whoever asserts the existence of something has the burden of\nproof. If an astronomer says there is water at the south pole of the\nMoon, then it is up to him to provide data in support of the lunar\nwater. If we were not required to have evidence to back our\nexistential claims, then a theorist who fully explained the phenomena\nwith one set of things could gratuitously add an extra entity, say, a\npebble outside our light cone. We recoil from such add-ons. To prevent\nthe intrusion of superfluous entities, one might demand that\nmetaphysicians start with the empty world and admit only those\nentities that have credentials. This is the entry requirement imposed\nby Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He clears everything out and then only lets\nback in what can be proved to exist.\n\nSt. Augustine had more conservative counsel: we should not start at\nthe beginning, nor at the end, but where we are, in the middle. We\nreach a verdict about the existence of controversial things by\nassessing how well these entities would harmonize with the existence\nof better established things. If we start from nothing, we lack the\nbearings needed to navigate forward. Conservatives, coherentists and\nscientific gradualists all cast a suspicious eye on \u2018Why is\nthere something rather than nothing?\u2019.\n\nMost contemporary philosophers feel entitled to postulate whatever\nentities are indispensable to their best explanations of well accepted\nphenomena. They feel the presumption of non-existence is only\nplausible for particular existence claims. Since the presumption only\napplies on a case by case basis, there is no grand methodological\npreference for an empty world. Furthermore, there is no burden of\nproof when everybody concedes the proposition under discussion. Even a\nsolipsist agrees there is at least one thing!\n\nA more popular way to build a presumption in favor of nothingness is\nto associate nothingness with simplicity and simplicity with\nlikelihood. The first part of this justification is plausible.\n\u2018Nothing exists\u2019 is simple in the sense of being an easy\nto remember generalization. Consider a test whose questions have the\nform \u2018Does x exist?\u2019. The rule \u2018Always\nanswer no!\u2019 is unsurpassably short and comprehensive.\n\nIn Les Mis\u00e9rables, Victor Hugo contrasts universal\nnegation with universal affirmation:\n\nAll roads are blocked to a philosophy which reduces everything to the\nword \u2018no.\u2019 To \u2018no\u2019 there is only one answer\nand that is \u2018yes.\u2019 Nihilism has no substance. There is no\nsuch thing as nothingness, and zero does not exist. Everything is\nsomething. Nothing is nothing. Man lives more by affirmation than by\nbread. (1862, 439).\n\n\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, there is a tie between the\nnihilistic rule \u2018Always answer no!\u2019 and the inflationary\nrule \u2018Always answer yes!\u2019. Neither rule makes for serious\nmetaphysics.\n\nEven if \u2018Nothing exists\u2019 were the uniquely simplest\npossibility (as measured by memorability), why should we expect that\npossibility to be actual? In a fair lottery, we assign the same\nprobability of winning to the ticket unmemorably designated 4,169,681\nas to the ticket memorably labeled 1,111,111.\n\nIndeed, the analogy with a lottery seems to dramatically reverse the\npresumption of non-existence. If there is only one empty world and\nmany populated worlds, then a random selection would lead us to expect\na populated world.\n\nPeter van Inwagen (1996) has nurtured this statistical argument. In an\ninfinite lottery, the chance that a given ticket is the winner is 0.\nVan Inwagen reasons that since there are infinitely many populated\nworlds, the probability of a populated world is equal to 1. Although\nthe empty world is not impossible, it is as improbable as anything can\nbe!\n\nFor the sake of balanced reporting, van Inwagen should acknowledge\nthat, by his reasoning, the actual world is also as improbable as\nanything can be. What really counts here is the probability of\n\u2018There is something\u2019 as opposed to \u2018There is\nnothing\u2019.\n\nIs this statistical explanation scientific? Scientists stereotypically\noffer causal explanations. These are not feasible given the\ncomprehensive reading of \u2018Why is there something rather than\nnothing?\u2019. However, scientists also accept equilibrium\nexplanations (Sperry-Taylor 2019). These explain the actual situation\nas the outcome of most or all of the possible initial states. There is\nno attempt to trace the path by which the actual initial state\ndeveloped into the present situation. It suffices that the result is\ninvariant. Why do I have enough oxygen to breathe even though all the\noxygen molecules could have congregated in one corner of my room? The\nphysicist explains that while this specific arrangement is just as\nlikely as any other, the overwhelming majority of arrangements do not\nsegregate oxygen.\n",
