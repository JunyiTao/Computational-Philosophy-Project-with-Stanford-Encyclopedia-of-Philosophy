    "preamble": "\n\n Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939) was one of the\nprincipal founders and movers of the school of logic that flourished in\nWarsaw between the two world wars. He was the originator of an\nunorthodox system of the foundations of mathematics, based on three\nformal systems: Protothetic, a logic of propositions and their\nfunctions; Ontology: a logic of names, and functors of arbitrary order;\nand Mereology, a general theory of part and whole. His concern for\nutmost rigor in the formalization and execution of logic, coupled with\na nominalistic rejection of abstract entities, led to a precise but\nhighly unusual metalogic. His strictures on correctly\ndistinguishing use from mention of expressions, his canons of correct\ndefinition, and his mereology, have all informed the logical\nmainstream, but the majority of his logical views and innovations have\nnot been widely adopted. Despite this, his influence as a teacher and\nas a motor for logical innovation are widely acknowledged. He remains\none of logic\u2019s most original figures.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nStanis\u0142aw Kazimierz Le\u015bniewski was born on 28 March 1886 at\nSerphukhov, near Moscow, to Izydor, an engineer working on the\nconstruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and Helena, n\u00e9e\nPalczewska. He was baptised at St. Stanislav\u2019s church in\nSt. Petersburg. His mother died when he was young and his father\nremarried. He attended classical Gimnazjum (grammar school\nstudying classical languages) in Irkutsk in Siberia. Between 1904 and\n1910 Le\u015bniewski studied Philosophy and Mathematics in Germany,\nSwitzerland and Russia, at Leipzig, Zurich, Heidelberg,\nSt. Petersburg, and at Munich, where he heard lectures by Hans\nCornelius, Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pf\u00e4nder. In 1910 he went\nas a doctoral student to Lw\u00f3w University, then in\nAustria-Hungary, where the foremost Polish philosopher of the day,\nKazimierz Twardowski, a student of Franz Brentano, was professor and\nwas building up a cadre of outstanding young philosophers. In 1912 he\nobtained his doctorate with a dissertation Przyczynek do analizy\nzda\u0144 egzystencjalnych [Contributions to the Analysis of\nExistential Propositions]. This was published the previous year in the\nleading Polish-language philosophy journal Przegl\u0105d\nFilozoficzny. Several further publications followed until the\noutbreak of war, which Le\u015bniewski spent in Moscow teaching\nmathematics at Polish schools. During this period he developed what\nlater became known as Mereology. After the Bolshevik Revolution in\nRussia, Le\u015bniewski left Russia for Poland. During the\n1919\u201321 Polish\u2013Bolshevik War he worked under Lt. Col. Jan Kowalewski as a codebreaker\nfor the Polish General Staff\u2019s Cipher Section, in part because of his knowledge of Russian, helping Poland to\nsurvive Russia\u2019s attempt to reconquer it. He tried unsuccessfully to\nobtain his habilitation in Lw\u00f3w, where he was blocked, getting\nit instead in the University of Warsaw, where in 1919 he became\n(Extraordinary\u2014Associate) Professor of the Foundations of\nMathematics, a position especially created for him. From then until\nhis final illness Le\u015bniewski lectured regularly on logical and\nmathematical topics, and built up his logical systems. Though his\nlogic never became widely accepted, even in Poland, with Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz he was respected as one of the co-founders of the\nWarsaw School of Logic. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s only doctoral student,\nAlfred Tarski (Le\u015bniewski used to boast of having 100% geniuses\nas doctoral students) joined them to form the world\u2019s pre-eminent\ncentre of mathematical logic in the interwar years. Le\u015bniewski\nwas made a full professor in 1936. Always a smoker, he contracted\nthyroid cancer and died on 13 May 1939 at the age of 53. His papers,\nentrusted to his student Boles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski, included\nunfinished works on logical antinomies and on many-valued logic. All\nthese papers were destroyed during the Warsaw Rising of 1944.\n2. Early Works\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s early writings are all papers on topics in\nthe philosophy of logic and language, concerned with such issues as\ntruth, denotation and connotation, the status of the laws of logic, and\nRussell\u2019s Antinomy. The primary influences in this period were\nJohn Stuart Mill, Anton Marty, and Edmund Husserl: he himself described\nthe works as grammatical in nature. Although Le\u015bniewski later\nrepudiated his early works, they contain many seeds of his later\ninterests, attitudes, and working practices. From the beginning there\nis an obsessive rigor in developing logical principles, including an\ninstinctively clear and consistent marking of the use/mention\ndistinction, that is, distinguishing talk in a language from talk about\na language. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s early works are mainly reactions to\nwork by others, whether Brentano and Cornelius on existential\npropositions, \u0141ukasiewicz on the Principles of Contradiction and\nExcluded Middle, Twardowski on universals, or Kotarbi\u0144ski on the\ntimelessness of truth.\n\n The turning point in this period came when in 1911 Le\u015bniewski read\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s groundbreaking 1910 monograph O zasadzie\nsprzeczno\u015bci u Arystotelesa [On the Principle of\nContradiction in Aristotle], a radical rethink of the status of the\nprinciple of contradiction in the light of modern logic. That work\ncontained an appendix in which there was a short exposition of modern\nsymbolic logic, in the notation of Couturat, and in Chapter 18 a brief\ndiscussion of Russell\u2019s antinomy of the set of sets which are not\nmembers of themselves. Le\u015bniewski initially thought the Russell\nAntinomy was easy to fix\u2014and while trying to fix it missed a\nonce-a-day train when changing stations in Russia. He spent the next\nyears perfecting his solution, and indeed the rest of his life was\ndevoted to providing a rigorous, antinomy-free foundation for\nmathematics which avoided both the sloppiness of Principia and\nwhat he considered the fiction of standard set theory.\n\n According to Le\u015bniewski\u2019s dissertation and first paper, all\npositive existential propositions are analytic. This sounds absurd, but\nLe\u015bniewski has reasons. Like Mill, he distinguishes between a\nterm\u2019s denotation, which is the object or objects it stands for,\nand its connotation, which is the property or properties it ascribes to\nsomething. A proposition is defined to be analytic if it is (1) in\npositive subject\u2013predicate form, and (2) contains no predicates\nconnoting properties not connoted by the subject. A proposition is\nsynthetic if it is (1) positive and (2) contains some predicate\nconnoting a property not connoted by the subject. Contrary to Mill, who\nsaid that \u2018being\u2019 connotes the property of existing,\nLe\u015bniewski thinks the predicate \u2018exist\u2019 does not\nconnote any properties. A fortiori, \u2018exist\u2019 used as a\npredicate connotes no property not contained in the subject. Negative\nexistential propositions, which have the form \u2018\\(X\\) is/are\nnon-existing\u2019 are synthetic, except for such whose subject\nconnotes non-existence, e.g. \u2018A square circle does not\nexist\u2019 does not, so it is synthetic, but \u2018All non-existing\nobjects are non-existing\u2019 is analytic. All negative existential\npropositions are contradictory, because every subject connotes\nsomething of the form \u2018being which possesses properties\n\\(A, B, C, D\\), etc.\u2019 Analytic\nnegative existentials have contradictory subjects. So instead of saying\n\u2018\\(X\\) exists\u2019 we should, to express the proposition\nwe want to be synthetic and contingent, rather say \u2018Some being is\nthe object \\(X\\)\u2019.\n\n Le\u015bniewski saves appearances, which are that some existential\npropositions are true and others are false, by proposing a normative\nschema that propositions should fulfill to be proper expressions of the\nthought intended. Every proposition is to represent the possessing by\nthe object(s) denoted by the subject of the properties connoted by the\npredicate. Sentences which fail to conform to this norm are improper or\ninadequate, and should be replaced by proper alternatives. For example\n\u2018People exist\u2019, which is true but is intended to be\nsynthetic, should be expressed as \u2018Some beings are people\u2019,\nwhile \u2018A square circle does not exist\u2019 should be expressed\nby \u2018No being is a square circle\u2019. Here is a table of some\nof the equivalences:\n\n\nInadequate Expression\nAdequate Alternative\n\n\nOnly objects \\(A\\) exist\nAll beings are objects \\(A\\)\n\n\nObjects \\(A\\) exist\nSome beings are objects \\(A\\)\n\n\nObject \\(A\\) exists\nOne (a certain) being is object \\(A\\)\n\n\nObject \\(A\\) does not exist \nObjects \\(A\\) do not exist\nNo being is a/the object \\(A\\)\n\n\n\n In \u201cAn Attempt at a Proof of the Ontological Principle of\nContradiction\u201d (1912) Le\u015bniewski argues that \u2018No\nobject is able to be both \\(B\\) and not\\(-B\\)\u2019 is true\nbut disagrees with the equivalence (now generally accepted) that\n\u2018No \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018If\nsomething is \\(A\\) then it is not \\(B\\)\u2019. The article\nis written in criticism of some ideas of \u0141ukasiewicz and it\nafforded the occasion for the first personal meeting of the two later\ncolleagues. \u0141ukasiewicz described the meeting decades later in a\npoignant diary entry for 9 May 1949:\n\n\nYesterday was the feast of St. Stanislaus, Bishop. This was\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s name day. On his last one he already lay in the\nsame hospital in which five days later he was to die. I met\nLe\u015bniewski in Lw\u00f3w in 1912. I lived then with my uncle in\n10, Chmielowski Street. One afternoon someone rang at the entrance\ndoor. I opened the door and I saw a young man with a light, pointed\nbeard, a hat with a wide brim and a big black cockade instead of a tie.\nThe young man bowed and asked politely: \u201cDoes Professor\n\u0141ukasiewicz live here?\u201d. I replied that it was so.\n\u201cAre you Professor \u0141ukasiewicz?\u201d asked the stranger. I\nreplied that it was so. \u201cI am Le\u015bniewski, and I have come to\nshow you the proofs of an article I have written against you.\u201d I\ninvited the man into my room. It turned out that Le\u015bniewski was\npublishing in Przegl\u0105d Filozoficzny an article containing\ncriticism of some my views in The Principle of Contradiction in\nAristotle. This criticism was written with such scientific\nexactness that I could not find any points which I could take up with\nhim. I remember that when, after hours of discussion, Le\u015bniewski\nparted from me, I went out as usual to the Kawiarnia Szkocka [Scottish\nCaf\u00e9, a favorite meeting-place for academics in Lw\u00f3w],\nand I declared to my colleagues waiting there that I would have to give\nup my logical interests. A firm had sprung up whose competition I was\nnot able to face. [Translated by Arianna Betti and Owen LeBlanc;\nsee Polish Philosophy Page: Stanislaw Lesniewski, in the\nOther Internet Resources section below]\n\n\n\n In \u201cThe Critique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded\nMiddle\u201d (1913) Le\u015bniewski distinguishes between an\nontological principle \u2013 Every object is either \\(A\\) or not\n\\(A\\) \u2013 and a logical principle \u2013 Of two\ncontradictory propositions, at least one must be true. He rejects the\nlatter because he takes \u2018Every centaur has a tail\u2019 and\n\u2018Some centaur does not have a tail\u2019 to be contradictories,\nbut both to be false because the subject-term \u2018centaur\u2019 is\nempty. This clearly depends on a reading of the universal with\nexistential import. If instead for the universal we take \u2018Any\ncentaur has a tail\u2019, which is true if there are no centaurs,\nthen we do get a contradictory pair with opposite truth-values.\n\n In the course of this paper Le\u015bniewski argues against\nTwardowski\u2019s theory of general objects and Meinong\u2019s theory\nof impossible objects, as well as offering solutions to the paradoxes\nof Grelling and the Liar. The paper is the richest of his early\n\u201clogico-grammatical\u201d works. The argument against Twardowski\ngoes as follows. Call a general object one which has all and\nonly the properties shared by some group of objects. For example the\ngeneral horse has all and only the properties shared by all horses: it\nis neither black nor brown nor white, neither male nor female, neither\nyoung nor old, but it is indisputably equine, mammalian, and born of\ntwo equine parents. Le\u015bniewski now reduces the definition to\nabsurdity. Of any group of at least two objects, there will be some\nproperty that some of them have that others do not have. For example,\nsome horses are black and others are not black. So the general horse is\nnot black, because some horses are not black; but nor is it not black,\nbecause some horses are not not black. Hence the general horse is\nneither black nor not black, which is a contradiction. Hence there are\nno general objects for groups of more than one thing. Le\u015bniewski\nliked this argument well enough to retain his allegiance to it even\nwhile repudiating all other parts of his early work; he rejected\nuniversals consistently thereafter. But the argument does not affect\nthose theories of universals which are happy to accept that universals\nmay have properties their instances do not, for example being\ninstantiated, or repeated.\n\n In \u201cIs truth only eternal or both eternal and without a\nbeginning?\u201d (1913) he argues for timeless bivalence against\nKotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s view that future contingent propositions lack\na determinate truth-value. This paper convinced Kotarbi\u0144ski he had\nbeen in error. The exchange is notable for showing that the discussion\nof the logical status of future contingent propositions, which inspired\n\u0141ukasiewicz to invent many-valued logic a few years later, was\nalready under way in Lw\u00f3w before the First World War.\n\n In \u201cIs the class of classes not subordinate to themselves\nsubordinate to itself?\u201d (1914) Le\u015bniewski offers his first\npublished analysis of Russell\u2019s Paradox, claiming that \u2018the\nclass of \\(A\\)s\u2019 refers to the unique mereological sum of\n\\(A\\)s, so that since every object is subordinate to itself, no\nclass of objects is not subordinate to itself, and Russell\u2019s\nParadox fails to arise. The non-standard term \u2018subordinate\nto\u2019 which he took from \u0141ukasiewicz, is defined by\nLe\u015bniewski as follows. An object \\(P\\) is subordinate to a\nclass \\(K\\) if and only if, for some a, \\(K\\) is a class of\n\\(a\\)s (a mereological sum of \\(a\\)s, as we shall see), and\n\\(P\\) is an \\(a\\). Let \\(P\\) be a hemispherical part of\na sphere \\(Q\\). The class of all hemispheres of \\(Q\\) is, on\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s understanding, simply \\(Q\\) itself, so\n\\(P\\) is subordinate to \\(Q\\). In fact, according to this\nview, any object is a class, and subordinate to itself. Le\u015bniewski\nretained this \u201cconcrete\u201d understanding of classes\nthroughout his life, claiming that it conformed to Cantor\u2019s own\nstatements. That other set theories gave a different account of things\nwas in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s view their problem, not his.\n\n During World War I, when Le\u015bniewski lived in Moscow, he completed\n\u201cFoundations of a General Theory of Sets I\u201d (1916). Despite\nthe use of the term \u2018mnogo\u015b\u0107\u2019 (set),\nthis was a first rigorous deductive presentation of the theory of\nparts, wholes and concrete collections. Le\u015bniewski later dropped\nthe term \u2018mnogo\u015b\u0107\u2019 and instead invented\nthe term \u2018Mereology\u2019, meaning \u2018theory of\nparts\u2019, an irregular coinage from the Greek\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, part, in order to\ndifferentiate his view from what he ironically called\n\u201cofficial\u201d set theory. In this paper the language is a\nhighly regimented Polish supplemented with variables, because at the\ntime Le\u015bniewski did not trust symbolic methods, having found the\nuse/mention confusions in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica a barrier to understanding, and assuming any symbolic\nlogic had to be like that. Only later did Le\u015bniewski discover the\nmuch tidier work of Frege, which he thereafter held up as the foremost\nexample of symbolic logic to that date. Le\u015bniewski was one of the\nearliest logicians to appreciate the virtues of Frege\u2019s logical\nwork as largely independent of its inconsistency. In later years,\nLe\u015bniewski proved that Frege\u2019s \u201cway out\u201d of the\nparadox, which involved a restriction of the fatal abstraction\nprinciple Basic Law V, had the unacceptable consequence that there\ncould not be more than one object. This work was not published, but was\nreconstructed after World War II by Soboci\u0144ski (1949).\n3. Development of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logical Systems\n\n \nIt is important for understanding Le\u015bniewski\u2019s development and\nhis attitude to logical systems as endowed with meaning from the\nstart, and not meaningless formal games, to know that he developed in\nhis systems chronologically in the reverse order from their order of\nlogical priority. Logically, protothetic precedes ontology, and\nontology precedes mereology, but he worked them out starting from\nmereology and working through ontology to finish with\nprotothetic. Becoming frustrated with the inexactnesses and foibles of\nnatural language as a medium for working, in 1920 Le\u015bniewski let\nhimself be persuaded by Leon Chwistek that it would be advantageous to\novercome his distaste for symbolism and formulate his logical thoughts\nusing symbols. Mereology having been rather well formulated already in\n1916, the transition to symbolism was straightforward there. The fact\nthat axiomatization came first, and symbolization of the already\naxiomatized theory followed subsequently, gave Le\u015bniewski a\nstrong reason to dissociate the use of formal methods from\nformalism, according to which formulas are without\ninterpretation. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s formulas had an intended\ninterpretation from the start.\n3.1 Early Mereology\n\n \nThe original (1916) formulation of Mereology, not yet so called, and\nnot yet formalized with special symbols, had the primitive concept\n\u2018part\u2019, four axioms and three definitions at its basis.\nThey are:\n\n\nAxiom I. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), then\n\\(B\\) is not part of \\(A\\)\n\n \nAxiom II. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), and\nobject \\(B\\) is part of object \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) is part\nof C.\n\n\n \nThese specify respectively the asymmetry and transitivity of the\npart relation.\n\n \nDefinition I. The expression \u2018ingredient of object\n\\(A\\)\u2019 is used to denote \\(A\\), and every part of\n\\(A\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: Object \\(B\\) is an ingredient of object \\(A\\) if\nand only if either \\(B\\) is \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is part of\n\\(A\\). Nowadays the term \u2018ingredient\u2019 is often simply\nrendered as \u2018part\u2019 and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\n\u2018part\u2019 is called \u2018proper part\u2019.\n\n \nDefinition II. The expression \u2018set\n[mnogo\u015b\u0107] of objects \\(m\\)\u2019 is used to\ndenote every object \\(A\\) such that if \\(B\\) is any\ningredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of \\(B\\) is an\ningredient of some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is an ingredient of\n\\(A\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: \\(A\\) is a set of \\(m\\) if and only if every\ningredient of \\(A\\) has a common ingredient with (mereologically\noverlaps) some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is part of \\(A\\).\nIntuitively, a set of \\(m\\) is what we would now call a\nmereological sum, consisting of one or more \\(m\\), but not\nnecessarily all of the \\(m\\).\n\n \nDefinition III. The expressions \u2018set of all objects\n\\(m\\)\u2019 and \u2018class [klasa] of objects\n\\(m\\)\u2019 are used to denote every object \\(A\\) such that\n(i) every \\(m\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), and (ii) if\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of some \\(m\\).\n\n\n\n \nThat is: a class of \\(m\\) is a set of all the \\(m\\). The\nremaining two axioms state that such classes exist and are unique:\n\n\n Axiom III. If some object is (an) \\(m\\), then some object is a\nclass of objects \\(m\\).\n\n \nAxiom IV. If \\(A\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), and\n\\(B\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\).\n\n\n \nWith these axioms we may speak of \u2018the class of\n\\(m\\)\u2019 whenever there is at least one \\(m\\).\n\n In terms of these basic principles, Le\u015bniewski proves a number of\ntheorems and defines several important mereological concepts, such as\noverlapping (having an ingredient in common) and being exterior to\n(having no ingredient in common). It is characteristic of this essay\nthat Le\u015bniewski is keen to appropriate the terminology of set\ntheory for his own purposes. Further terminology includes\n\u2018element\u2019, which is defined as follows:\n\n \nDefinition IV. The term \u2018element of object \\(A\\)\u2019\nis used to denote any object \\(B\\) which, for some meaning of the\nexpression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, is such that (i) \\(A\\) is the\nclass of objects \\(x\\), and (ii) \\(B\\) is (an)\n\\(x\\).\n\n\n\n \nIt is swiftly proved that the ingredients of \\(A\\) and the\nelements of \\(A\\) are the same. The definition illustrates how\nLe\u015bniewski formulated the idea of quantification in his early\nsemi-prose work: instead of \u201cfor some \\(x\\)\u201d he says\n\u201cfor some meaning of the expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019\n\u201d. When showing all ingredients of an object are its elements,\nLe\u015bniewski instantiates the bound variable by saying \u201cUsing\nthe expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 with the meaning of the\nexpression \u2018ingredient of the object \\(A\\)\u2019\n\u2026\u201d. We will return to this below when discussing\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s understanding of the quantifiers.\n\n By Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own later and very exacting standards, this\nfirst formulation of Mereology is methodologically imperfect, because\nit intersperses axioms and definitions. A cleaner formulation would\nexpress all axioms in terms of the mereological primitive (here\n\u2018part\u2019) only. This would be possible in this case simply by\nsubstituting the definitions of defined terms in Axioms III and IV, but\nit would not be especially enlightening. It also results in an axiom\nsystem that can be substantially simplified, both by reducing the\nnumber of axioms and by simplifying and shortening them. These\ndesiderata (fewer, shorter, and more perspicuous axioms) often\npull in different directions.\n3.2 Ontology\n\n \nThe language of Mereology in 1916 used many expressions besides the\nspecifically mereological primitive \u2018part\u2019: in addition to\nnominal variables, there are expressions forming sentences from nominal\nvariables, as in \u2018\\(A\\) is (a) \\(b\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u2019, \u2018every \\(a\\) is a\n\\(b\\)\u2019, \u2018some \\(a\\) is a \\(b\\), \u2018no\n\\(a\\) is a \\(b\\)\u2019, as well as words such as\n\u2018object\u2019 and \u2018exist\u2019. Complex names also occur\nin sentences, as the expressions \u2018part of \\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018ingredient of \\(A\\)\u2019 in \u2018every part of\n\\(A\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\)\u2019. Le\u015bniewski had\nhitherto taken such logical bits of language for granted, but now he\nneeded to formalize them. He wanted a logical calculus of names and the\nexpressions involving them. There were precedents in traditional\nsyllogistic, and more especially in the algebra of logic of Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der, which Le\u015bniewski looked at in coming up with his\nown system, based as in the case of Mereology on his intuitive\nunderstanding of the relevant expressions as carefully used in ordinary\nlanguage. At first he gathered propositions he was sure were true, such\nas \u2018If \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(A\\)\u2019. We know about this one because it is mentioned,\npresumably scornfully, in a diary entry by Twardowski for 1 July 1919,\nas being the first axiom of the new system that Le\u015bniewski was\nworking on at the time. Le\u015bniewski has left us a graphic\ndescription of his method of working at this crucial and fluid time of\nhis development [Collected Works 366\u20139]:\n\n \nWhile using colloquial language in scientific work and attempting to\ncontrol its \u2018logic\u2019, I endeavoured to somehow rationalize\nthe way in which I was using in colloquial language various types of\npropositions passed down to us by \u2018traditional logic\u2019.\nWhile relying on \u2018linguistic instinct\u2019 and the often\nnon-uniform tradition of \u2018traditional logic\u2019, I attempted\nto devise a consistent method of working with propositions that were\n\u2018singular\u2019, \u2018particular\u2019,\n\u2018general\u2019, \u2018existential\u2019 etc. The results of my\nefforts were useful and I continued my efforts in applying to the\n\u2018symbolism\u2019 the equivalents of various types of\npropositions, after the change to the \u2018symbolic\u2019 way of\nwriting.\n\n \nWhile working in this way, and attempting to define some expressions\nin terms of others, Le\u015bniewski came to focus on singular\npropositions of the form \u2018\\(A\\) is (a) \\(b\\)\u2019,\nwhich he henceforth wrote as \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019, borrowing from Peano the lower-case epsilon, the\nfirst letter of the Greek \u2018\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u2019,\nis. It was this connection with meanings of \u2018is\u2019\nthat prompted Le\u015bniewski to name this system\n\u2018Ontology\u2019. He thought it would be possible to base it on\nsingular inclusions like \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019\nalone, in addition to concepts taken from the logic of connectives and\nquantifiers. The key thought was that the following should be true\n\n \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if (every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\), and at most one object is \\(A)\\)\n \n\n \nThis requires the two expressions \u2018every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\)\u2019 and \u2018at most one object is \\(A\\)\u2019 to\nbe defined. The first can be helped along by\n\n every \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if (some object is\n\\(a\\), and for any \\(X\\), if \\(X\\) is \\(a\\), then\n\\(X\\) is \\(b)\\)\n \n\n \nwhich requires \u2018some\u2019 and \u2018object\u2019 to be\ndefined: they can be helped further by\n\n\n some \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if for some \\(X,\nX\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(X\\) is \\(b\\)\n\n if \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is an object\n\n\n \nwhile the second can be helped by\n\n at most one object is \\(a\\) if and only if for any \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), if \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(a\\),\nthen \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\)\n \n\n \nand finally we have\n\n \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\) if and only if \\((A\\)\nis \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(A)\\).\n \n\n \nPutting these together, and inspired by Russell\u2019s theory of\ndefinite descriptions, Le\u015bniewski arrived in 1920 at a single\naxiom based on the single primitive \u2018is\u2019:\n\n \n\\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if ((for some \\(B,\nB\\) is \\(A)\\) and (for any \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), if\n\\(B\\) is \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)\nis \\(C)\\), and (for any \\(B\\), if \\(B\\) is \\(A\\)\nthen \\(B\\) is \\(a))\\)\n \n\n \nThe story has it that Le\u015bniewski discovered this axiom, his\nefforts fortified by eating bars of chocolate, while sitting on a bench\nin Warsaw\u2019s Saxon Garden. Symbolically, using a somewhat more\nmodern symbolism than Le\u015bniewski\u2019s, but borrowing his upper\ncorners for marking quantifier scope, the axiom becomes\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{OL} \n\\forall Aa\\ulcorner A \\isa a \\leftrightarrow (&\\exists B \\ulcorner B \\isa A\\urcorner \\\\\n&\\wedge \\forall BC \\ulcorner(B \\isa A \\wedge C \\isa A) \\rightarrow B \\isa C\\urcorner \\\\\n&\\wedge \\forall B \\ulcorner B \\isa A \\rightarrow B \\isa a\\urcorner)\\urcorner\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n \nSeveral things are notable about this axiom and its formulation. It is\nin the form of a universally quantified equivalence, with the\nright-hand side as it were explicating the left-hand side, so that it\nis a kind of implicit definition of the primitive\n\u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019. The right-hand side, taking its cue from\nRussell, says that there is at least one \\(A\\) (first conjunct),\nthere is at most one \\(A\\) (second conjunct), and any \\(A\\)\nis an \\(a\\) (third conjunct). The use of capital letter variables\nis an informal aid to perspicuity: they mark the positions in\nsentences (especially before \u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019) where a variable\ncan only yield a truth of its immediate context if it is\nsingular. Where small Italic variables are used, there is no such\npresumption of singularity. In principle only one typeface of\nvariables is needed. On the basis of his axiom and several rules of\ninference, Le\u015bniewski developed a powerful system of general\nlogic comparable in strength to a simple type theory: he writes in\n1929, \u201cIn 1921 I developed my \u2018theory of types\u2019\n[\u2026] It was something like Whitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s theory of\ntypes, which I had generalised and simplified in a certain way\u201d\n(Collected Works, 421). \n3.3 Protothetic\n\n \nBoth Mereology and Ontology presuppose a deeper logical layer,\ncomprising a propositional logic of connectives like \u2018if\u2019,\n\u2018not\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019, and the as yet unexplicated\nlogic of the quantifiers \u2018for all\u2019 (\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019)\nand \u2018for some\u2019 (\u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019). Having settled\nOntology on an axiomatic basis, Le\u015bniewski turned to the\naxiomatization of this. He originally spoke of the \u201ctheory of\ndeduction\u201d, which was the name Whitehead and Russell used for the\npropositional calculus, but because they did not introduce a logic of\nquantifiers until later, he coined the term \u2018Protothetic\u2019,\nfrom the Greek for \u2018first theses\u2019. It is characteristic of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logic that he introduces quantifiers in the\nmost basic part of his logic, even before names are introduced. This is\nunlike most modern theories, which introduce quantifiers only when\nnames and predicates are brought in. It leads to questions about the\nnature of quantification in Le\u015bniewski which we will revisit\nbelow.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s preference for an axiom system, based in part\non the success of Ontology, and also on considerations about the nature\nof definition, was to base a logical system on the single connective of\nmaterial equivalence, together with the universal quantifier. He was\nheld up for some time in doing this for Protothetic by his inability to\nsee how to eliminate the connective of conjunction in terms of\nequivalence. Given quantification and equivalence, negation is easy to\ndefine, in a way Russell once suggested to Frege:\n\n\\[\\tag{Def. \\({\\sim}\\)}\n\\forall p\\ulcorner{\\sim}p \\leftrightarrow \n(p \\leftrightarrow \\forall r \\ulcorner r\\urcorner)\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nThe solution was found for Le\u015bniewski by his 21-year-old\ndoctoral student Alfred Teitelbaum, later renowned under his adopted\nname as Alfred Tarski. It consisted in quantifying not just sentences\nbut sentential functions or connectives:\n\n\\[\\tag{Def. \\(\\wedge\\)}\n\\forall pq\\ulcorner p \\wedge q \\leftrightarrow \\forall f \\ulcorner p \\leftrightarrow(f(p)\n\\leftrightarrow f(q))\\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nin this case, quantifying one-place connectives. Assuming there are just four of\nthese connectives, assertion, negation, Verum (tautology) and\nFalsum (contradiction), it is straightforward to show that the\nright-hand side is equivalent to the conjunction of \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\). Tarski\u2019s doctoral dissertation centres around this\nresult.\n\n As to axiomatization, Le\u015bniewski knew that the pure theory of\nequivalence could be based on two axioms stating skew-transitivity and\nassociativity:\n\n\\[\\tag{P1}\n((p \\leftrightarrow r) \\leftrightarrow(q \\leftrightarrow p))\n\\leftrightarrow(r \\leftrightarrow q)\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{P2}\n(p \\leftrightarrow(q \\leftrightarrow r)) \\leftrightarrow((p \\leftrightarrow q) \\leftrightarrow r)\n\\]\n\n\n \nPure equivalential calculus has the quaint property, shown by\nLe\u015bniewski, that a formula is a theorem if and only if every\npropositional variable in it occurs an even number of times. After\nuniversally quantifying these axioms, a further axiom was added to\nintroduce propositional functions, in this case two-placed ones\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{P3}\n\\forall gp\\ulcorner \\forall f \\ulcorner g(pp) \\leftrightarrow (&\\forall r\\ulcorner f(rr) \\leftrightarrow g(pp)\\urcorner \\\\\n &\\leftrightarrow \\forall r\\ulcorner f(rr) \\leftrightarrow g((p \\leftrightarrow \\forall q\\ulcorner q\\urcorner) \\\\\n &\\leftrightarrow p)\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\forall q\\ulcorner g(qp)\\urcorner \\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n \nOnce again Le\u015bniewski and his students sought after shorter and\nmore perspicuous formulations, or ones consisting of a single axiom,\nthough the latter tended to be neither short nor perspicuous.\n\n With Protothetic launched, Le\u015bniewski could now look back on his\nsystem of foundations and see that it consisted of a hierarchy of three\nsystems, developed in reverse order: Protothetic, introducing\nconnectives, quantifiers and higher functions; Ontology, introducing\nthe new category of names, with the new primitive \u2018is\u2019, and\nMereology, based on a primitive mereological functor such as\n\u2018part of\u2019 or \u2018ingredient of\u2019, but introducing\nno new categories of expressions not already foreseen in Ontology.\n4. Philosophical Aspects of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logic\n4.1 Semantic Categories\n\n \nOne of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s most lasting contributions to the metatheory\nof logic is his theory of semantic categories. This replaced the\ntheory of simple types which he developed in 1921, about which he\nwrote, \u201c[E]ven as I was constructing my theory of types, I\nconsidered it to be only an inadequate stop-gap [\u2026] In 1922 I\noutlined a concept of semantical categories as a replacement for the\nhierarchy of types, which is quite unintuitive to me\u201d\n(Collected Works, 421). In type theory, expressions belonging\nto different logical types cannot be substituted for one another\nwithout turning grammatical or well-formed expressions into\nungrammatical or ill-formed ones. Only well-formed or grammatical\nexpressions may have a sense or meaning. The theory was developed by\nBertrand Russell as a way of blocking set-theoretic paradoxes, though\nthere were anticipations in the work of Ernst Schr\u00f6der and\nGottlob Frege. In type theory it is usually assumed that variables at\neach type range over a domain of entities specific to that type, and\nthat all such domains are mutually disjoint. In Frege for instance\nthe domains were objects and functions of various levels, while in\nRussell they are usually taken to be a hierarchy of propositional\nfunctions. This presumptively platonistic and ontologically\ninflationary position was naturally uncongenial to the nominalist\nLe\u015bniewski, and he readjusted the notion of category, turning\ncategories from classes of entities (with their attendant expressions)\nto classes of expressions alone. His inspiration was in part the\ntraditional syntactic theory of different parts of speech, and in part\nHusserl\u2019s theory of Bedeutungskategorien (meaning categories)\nfrom the latter\u2019s Logical Investigations. Where Husserl\u2019s\ncategories were of abstract meanings, Le\u015bniewski, ever the\nnominalist, substituted categories of (concrete) expressions. Although\nlike later writers he could have called the classes of expressions\n\u2018syntactic categories\u2019, he deliberately chose the\nexpression \u2018semantic categories\u2019 in order to emphasize\nthat the expressions combined grammatically are all meaningful, unlike\nthe meaningless marks proposed by formalist writers of the Hilbert\nSchool.\n\n Le\u015bniewski himself never gave an explicit formulation of the\ntheory of semantic categories, being content to work with them in\npractice. The first formulation was by his contemporary Kazimierz\nAjdukiewicz, in the 1935 article \u2018Syntactic Connection\u2019.\nAjdukiewicz\u2019s essay became the fountainhead of the subsequent\nsubdiscipline of categorial grammar. Modifying Ajdukiewicz\u2019s\nnotation, we may explain semantic categories as Le\u015bniewski used\nthem. Le\u015bniewski thought that the theory applies only to\nhis logical systems, not to ordinary language,\nabout which he became rather sceptical as to its ability\nto be unambiguously precise. Subsequently it has been shown that\ncategorial grammar can be applied quite successfully to the syntax of\nnatural languages.\n\n There are in Le\u015bniewski two basic categories: sentence (S) and\nname (N). In Protothetic, only the former is used: Ontology and\nMereology add the latter. The distinction between sentences and names\nis ultimate: what we can say about sentences is that they are there to\nsay things that are true or false (obviously from a logical point of\nview we are overlooking questions and commands), whereas names are\nthere to denote things. Le\u015bniewski, following tradition, allows\nnames to denote several things, or one thing, or indeed no things as\nall. So \u2018Istanbul\u2019 denotes one thing, namely the Turkish\ncity, \u2018city\u2019 denotes many things, namely all cities, and\n\u2018unicorn\u2019 denotes nothing at all. In\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s mature work Mill\u2019s notion of connotation\nis dropped, along with the concept of property which it employs, so the\nsole logical function of names is denoting. Again following tradition\nrather than the modern approach of Frege and Russell, Le\u015bniewski\nmakes no syntactic distinction between general terms or common\nnouns on the one hand and singular terms or proper names on the other.\nThis is often said to be because his native Polish lacks definite and\nindefinite articles, which make the distinction more grammatically\nobvious, but this conjecture is nonsense because Le\u015bniewski spoke\nand wrote fluent German, and German is awash with articles. It seems much more\nlikely that Le\u015bniewski deliberately chose to follow the\ntraditional rather than the modern way because he thought it both more\nexpressively powerful and closer to natural language.\n\n Since language does not consist solely of unarticulated sentences or\nnames, there are expressions of other categories, which combine in a\nrule-governed way with one another to produce further expressions,\nultimately sentences. In the regimented environment of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logical languages this always takes place in\nthe following way: a combining expression, which we may call a\nfunctor, precedes a left parenthesis of some kind, which is\nthen followed by a sequence of one or more argument\nexpressions, followed by a right parenthesis symmetric to the other\none, which terminates the complex. The general schema is then\n\n functor + left parenthesis + argument 1 + \u2026 + argument \\(n\\) + right parenthesis\n\n\n \nas exemplified by\n\n\\[F(a_1 \\ldots a_n)\n\\]\n\n \nor, more concretely, \\({\\sim}(p), \\koppa(pq), \\isa \\{Aa\\}\\).\n\n Now let us provide a notation, inspired by Ajdukiewicz, for the\ncategory of a functor such as \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019. If the category of\n\u2018\\(a_1\\)\u2019 is \\(\\alpha_1\\), the category of\n\u2018\\(a_n\\)\u2019 is \\(\\alpha_n\\), and the category of the whole\nexpression \u2018\\(F(a_1 \\ldots a_n)\\)\u2019 is \\(\\beta\\), then the\ncategory of the functor expression \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 we write as\n\n\\[\\beta \\langle \\alpha_1 \\ldots \\alpha_n \\rangle\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhich indicates the category of the output to the left and the\ncategory of its inputs in order within the angled brackets. Call this\nthe categorial index of the expression. Thus the category of\nsentential negation is\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\rangle\\),\n that of conjunction is\n\\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\rS\\rangle\\),\n while that of the epsilon functor \u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019 is \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\),\n since it builds a sentence using two names as arguments.\n\n What Ajdukiewicz showed in his 1935 paper was that we can develop a\ncalculus of grammatical combination using such a notation: we take a\nputatively well-formed expression, rearrange it if necessary into\nfunctor-first order, then see if we can \u201cmultiply out\u201d\narguments and functors to arrive at a single categorial index. If we\ncan, the complex expression is grammatical, well-formed, or\nsyntactically connected. For example\n\u2018\\(\\isa\\{Aa\\}\\)\u2019 is syntactically connected as\nfollows: writing the category of an expression \\(e\\) as\n\\(|e|\\) we have\n\n\\[\n|\\isa | = \\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle,\\\n|A| = |a| = \\rN, \\text{ so } |\\isa \\{Aa\\}| = \\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle \\times (\\rN \\times \\rN) = \\rS\n\\]\n\n\n \nas we would expect. Ajdukiewicz used a \u201cquotient\u201d\nnotation instead of our angled brackets; this makes the idea of\n\u201cmultiplying out\u201d more graphic, but becomes cumbersome for\ncomplex cases.\n\n There may be functors whose arguments are functors: for example a\nconjunction holding between two binary predicates has a category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\).\n There may also be what are called many-link functors, which\nare functors whose values are functors. For example, the English\nmorpheme \u2018\u2013ly\u2019 converts an adjective, category\n \\(\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle\\),\n into an adverb, for example of category \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\),\n so \u2018\u2013ly\u2019 has effective category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle \\langle\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\). \n In some subsequent categorial grammars, transitive verbs are quite\nplausibly taken to have the many-link category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rN\\rangle\\)\n rather than the binary predicate category \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\).\n This move is indeed a standard trick in logic, first introduced by\nMoses Sch\u00f6nfinkel in 1924, for dispensing with many-placed\nfunctors in favor of many-link but one-placed functors. Had he known\nof this, Le\u015bniewski would no doubt have disapproved. While there\nis no loss of logical power in eliminating many-placed functors, the\nmove is unnatural, and Le\u015bniewski would not have countenanced\ndefining many-placed functors as many-link ones in disguise,\nas we find in Church for instance.\n\n With the two basic categories of sentence and name, every category and\nexpression, no matter how complex, will have a categorial index\nbeginning either with \u2018S\u2019, so ultimately leading to the\nformation of a sentence, or \u2018N\u2019, so ultimately leading to\nthe formation of a name. Following a useful terminological suggestion\nof Eugene Luschei, we may call the former propositive\ncategories and expressions, the latter nominative categories\nand expressions (Luschei 1962, 169).\n\n Note that the parentheses in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s notation do not\nthemselves have a category: they are syncategorematic. Their function\nis twofold: to mark the beginnings and ends of argument strings, and to\nhelp indicate the semantic category of the functors. Thus\nLe\u015bniewski used round parentheses for functors yielding sentences\nfrom sentences, i.e. connectives, and braces for functors yielding\nsentences from names, i.e. predicates. In principle an unlimited number\nof shapes of parentheses might be required, and indeed in some works of\nstudents of Soboci\u0144ski there are several dozens of different\nshapes. Le\u015bniewski gave parentheses this second role because he\nwished to remain very flexible about the forms of expression used for\nfunctors, even allowing the same shape to be used in\n\u201canalogous\u201d functors, for example 3-placed conjunction, or\n\u201chigher-order\u201d epsilons and equivalences, or other logical\nconstants. Obviously this is a contingent feature of his notation:\nother conventions will do just as well.\n\nMore important for metalogical purposes is the fact that the universal\nquantifier too is syncategorematic in Le\u015bniewski. This is marked\nsymbolically in that the lower corners which he used to symbolize the\nuniversal quantifier are no more than a container for the variables,\nbut more crucially, in that any finite string of different variables\nmay occur in such a quantifier, no matter how assorted their\ncategories. There are some advantages in this\nflexibility. Le\u015bniewski does not need to give rules for many\ndifferent kinds of universal quantifier, but gives rules for the one\nsort in one go. But there are some disadvantages too. In his\n\u201cofficial\u201d notation for his logics, Le\u015bniewski has\nonly the universal quantifier, and does not define the particular\nquantifier or any others in the standard way. This was also Frege\u2019s\npractice, but whereas in Frege\u2019s case the parsimony seems to have been\nself-inflicted, in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s case there is a systematic\nreason. Le\u015bniewski was scrupulous about giving exact rules for\nadmitting new expressions by definition. He gave such rules for\nProtothetic, and extended them to Ontology. These rules govern only\nbasic and functor category expressions. Quantifiers, being variable\nbinders, are neither basic nor functor expressions, but\nLe\u015bniewski was unable to come up with acceptable canons of\ndefinition for such variable binders. He would have liked to have done\nso, and indeed offered students any degree they wanted, from Master\u2019s\nto\nHabilitation, if they could formulate adequate rules, but no\none could. Therefore in the \u201cofficial\u201d system the\nuniversal quantifier remained as a syncategorematic expression, but\nstill entered into legal combinations, which meant that the syntax of\nhis systems was not fully captured by categorial grammar. Such a\nlimitation became apparent to Ajdukiewicz also, who made an\nunsuccessful attempt to rectify it. Ajdukiewicz noted perceptively\nthat a language containing Russell\u2019s circumflex abstraction operator,\nwhich Alonzo Church had notated using the Greek lambda, would be able\nto express any operator as a combination of an abstraction operator with a\nfunctor. Church employed this method to considerable advantage in his\nlogic, but this work came too late to help Le\u015bniewski. In any\ncase, in Church it simply pushed the problem of syncategorematicity\nover to the lambda operator.\n4.2 Definitions\n\n \nThe status of definitions in logic and outside it has been\nsurprisingly controversial. Probably the standard view among logicians\nis that of Russell, according to which definitions are mere\nabbreviations whose role is to render complex propositions more easily\nsurveyable by feeble humans. According to this view, when a logician\ndefines, say, conjunction in terms of implication and negation, as\n\n\\[\np \\wedge q =_{df} {\\sim}(p \\rightarrow{\\sim}q)\n\\]\n\n\n \nthis is to be understood as merely a shorter expression substituting\nfor the longer one. In this case the abbreviatory value is negligible,\nbut in the case of some long expressions, such as that for the\nancestral of a relation, or in very many areas of mathematics, it may\nbe considerable. Russell expressed this view somewhat\nover-dramatically by calling a definition an expression of the\nauthor\u2019s will. On this view, a definition cannot be true or false; it\nmay be appropriate or helpful, or not, and there are certain\nproprieties to be observed, such as not having dangling variables in\neither definiens or definiendum, and not trying to define an\nexpression in terms of itself, but beyond this, the methodological\nrequirements on abbreviation are minimal. In many modern logical\nsystems, definitions are said to be confined to the metalanguage only,\nand not to appear in the object language at all.\n\n There is nothing wrong with this view, but it is emphatically not\nthat of Le\u015bniewski. According to him, a definition introduces a\nnew expression into the object language. Again, the proprieties have\nto be respected, and getting these right turns out to be a tricky\nmatter. Also, it is up to the author of a logical system as to which\ndefinitions he or she chooses to introduce. But there is an important\ndifference. Since definitions add new expressions to the object\nlanguage, they add expressions in places where they can be quantified,\nand so can enhance the system\u2019s expressive power. Le\u015bniewski\nadmits this option: according to him it is the logician\u2019s job to keep\nadding to the system. If in the process, new things are provable that\nwere not provable before, so much the better, provided the proprieties\nare respected. If we can prove a theorem not containing a defined\nexpression after a definition has been introduced that could\nnot be proved before, the definition is said to be\ncreative. Most logicians decry creative definitions:\nLe\u015bniewski embraced them. Le\u015bniewski contended that the\nsymbol \u2018=Def.\u2019 used by most logicians actually sneaks an\nunrecognized primitive into their work. He thought this of Whitehead\nand Russell, and it is why he wanted to formulate Protothetic based on\nequivalence alone, since then the same connective is primitive that is\nused for definitions. In his view, definitions are object-language\nequivalences and should be recognized as such. In retrospect we can\nsee that this view was too extreme. There is room for abbreviatory\ndefinitions, and indeed Le\u015bniewski \u201cunofficially\u201d used\none himself, that of the particular quantifier. What Le\u015bniewski\ncalls \u2018definitions\u2019 might better be called\n\u2018definitional axioms\u2019. That these can be added as we go\nalong rather than collected together at the beginning of a logic is\nsimply a feature of his way of doing logic.\n\n Perhaps the most important creative definition used by\nLe\u015bniewski is one from Ontology, due to Tarski in 1921. Is is for\na functor * of category\n \\(\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\forall AB\\ulcorner A \\isa *(B) \\leftrightarrow \\exists c\\ulcorner A \\isa c \\wedge B \\isa A\\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhere \u2018\\(A \\isa *(B)\\)\u2019 can be read as\n\u2018\\(A\\) is the unique \\(B\\)\u2019. It allowed the long\naxiom of Ontology to be replaced by the short one (see below): without\nit, the replacement was not possible.\n4.3 Nominalism\n\n \nWe noted that Le\u015bniewski, persuaded by his argument against\nTwardowski\u2019s general objects, was a nominalist. It was no doubt part\nof his antipathy towards set theory. His friend Kotarbi\u0144ski\nformulated a very extreme nominalism, called variously reism,\npansomatism, and concretism, according to which the only things that\nexist are material bodies. Le\u015bniewski would not go this far,\nbecause he did not see how after-images and dreamt things, which he\nthought existed, could be material bodies. But in elaborating his\nlogic he emphatically rejects anything which is not concrete,\nindividual, located in space and time. This goes for the logical\nsystems themselves. His view, which would nowadays be called\ninscriptionalism, is that logical systems are actual\ncollections of concrete marks, whether printed on paper in books and\njournals, or in handwritten notes, or more ephemerally as spoken\nwords, chalk marks on blackboards, or (nowadays) patterns on computer\nscreens. Leaving aside the non-trivial metaphysical question of what\ncan in principle count as a logical inscription, we must consider what\neffect this stance had on his attitude to logic and logic systems.\n\n The effect is far-reaching and radical. If a logical system is a\nconcrete complex of signs, then it cannot be infinite. Also, to\nconform to logical practice, it has to be admitted that logical\nsystems change over time. Ideally, they change by being added to, as\nnew theorems are proved. In practice, they may degrade or be wholly\ndestroyed, which was indeed the sad fate of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own\npersonally written systems in November 1944. If a logical system is\npublished in a book or journal, and there are several copies, then\nthere are as many such systems as there are copies. Assuming the\ncopies are all faithful, then each copy is typographically exactly\nlike all the others. They are, in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s parlance, all\nequiform. In practice of course, equiformity is not quite\nexact, even in printed works, but the minute variations are\ninsignificant, and in any case we wish to recognize handwritten\nmanuscripts and other variants to be equiform for logical purposes\nwith systems which are physically somewhat different. Again the\nmetaphysical fine detail is less important that the fact that we get\nby most of the time with constrainedly inexact similarity.\n\n Almost all metalogical ways of dealing with logical systems are\nplatonistic. They assume that the simple and complex expressions are\nabstract types, that they are infinite in number, that an axiom system\nhas infinitely many logical theorems, and so on. Le\u015bniewski can\nadmit none of this. So he has to find a way to deal with logical\nsystems as something organic, growing and changing with time. He does\nso by employing a complex system of metalogical definitions, which he\ncalls \u2018terminological explanations\u2019, and inference rules,\nwhich he calls \u2018directives\u2019. In effect Le\u015bniewski\ngives a schematic grammatical and logical framework for an\nindefinitely extensible language, decades in advance of the advent of\nformal descriptions of computer programming languages, which are the\nnearest equivalent elsewhere.\n\n It is hard to give a flavor of the terminological explanations (TEs)\nin a short space: their complexity and cumulative effect has to\nappreciated at first hand. The most thorough account is in the TEs for\nProtothetic in Grundz\u00fcge, Section 11, and there is also\na compressed account of TEs for Ontology. A somewhat more manageable\nset for a version of propositional calculus with definitions, based on\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s bracketless notation, is given in the 1931 paper\n\u2018\u00dcber Definitionen in der sogenannten Theorie der\nDeduktion\u2019, and based on lectures from 1930\u201331. There\nLe\u015bniewski gives TEs in words rather than symbolic abbreviations,\nand with copious examples. Nevertheless, it is intellectually\nchallenging, since for all the complex TEs (metalogical definitions),\nLe\u015bniewski demanded logical independence of all the various\nclauses, to be shown by suitable models. As a result, it took graduate\nstudents three semesters to work through a set of TEs in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s seminar (personal information from Czes\u0142aw\nLejewski) .\n\nThe TEs are a means to an end: that of formulating a system\u2019s\ndirectives. A directive sounds like an imperative, but its\nillocutionary force is subtler. Assume a logical system has been\ndeveloped up to a certain point, that is, up to a certain last written\nthesis (Le\u015bniewski\u2019s word covering axioms, theorems and\ndefinitions). At the very least, the axiom or axioms will have been\nwritten down. Assume for the sake of argument that the development has\nbeen fine up to now. There is no categorical imperative to extend the\nsystem by adding another thesis, but let us suppose the system\u2019s\nauthor (or indeed any assistant) wishes to do so. He or she writes\ndown a new collection of marks. Not just anything goes however. The\nmarks have to be legible (obviously), unequivocally dissectible into\nelementary symbols (that Le\u015bniewski calls words),\ngrammatically well-formed as a sentence (no unbound variables are\nallowed), and finally admissible according to the\ndirectives. The directives lay down what may be admitted next\nafter a given sequence of theses. For example, the next thesis may be\nan instantiation from a previous universally quantified thesis, or a\nmodus ponens from two previous theses, or a quantifier\ndistribution from a previous thesis, or a definition acceptable\naccording to the canons, or a thesis of extensionality. Admissibility\nis always relativized to the prior sequence: the order of introduction\nmatters. If the new candidate thesis is admissible according to one of\nthe directives, it passes the test and becomes part of the system,\nwhich can then be extended still further. Otherwise it is rejected and\nthe system is not extended.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s supreme achievement as a logician, in his own eyes,\nwas to formulate the metalogical requirements for extending a concrete\nsystem by directives, relative to the previous state of the\nsystem. Since the system is not planned or fixed in advance, the TEs\nand directives have to be schematically flexible enough to accommodate\nany future additions, while not being so liberal as to allow\ncontradictions or nonsense to arise. Finding that balance, most\nespecially in the rules for admissible definitions, was a considerable\nfeat. The definition of \u2018definition\u2019 for Protothetic run\nto 18 separate complex clauses, and in Ontology, which adds a second\nstyle of definition, another 18 clauses.\n\n Definitions, which seem so peripheral to most logical systems, are in\nfact key to the potential power of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logic. The axioms\nof a system generally use very few semantic categories near the bottom\nof the recursive hierarchy. It is by definitions that new semantic\ncategories are introduced into the system; once a new category is in,\nvariables for it may be introduced and quantified, a thesis of\nextensionality formulated for it, and it can provide arguments for\nfurther, higher-level functors. So although, unlike a typed logic\nconceived platonistically, only finitely many types or categories are\nactually in play in any one system, the potential to go on is\nrestricted only by contingent limitations.\n\n The easiest way to get an idea of how definitions work in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logic is not to look at the published work on\nMereology or Protothetic, but at the extended list of\n\u201cDefinitions and Theses of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Ontology\u201d\nfrom S. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Lecture Notes on Logic, published\nin 1988. Taken from student notes of a 1929\u201330 lecture\ncourse \u2018Elementary Outline of Ontology\u2019, they comprise one\naxiom, 59 definitions and 633 listed (not proved) theorems, covering\nsyllogistic, Boolean algebra, the notions of property(-predicate) and\nhigher-order property, relations, higher-order epsilons, and several\nchunks of the theory of relations including converses, fields and\nrelative products, as known from Peirce, Schr\u00f6der, Whitehead and\nRussell. Not coincidentally, the sketched development includes a large\nnumber of styles of parentheses.\n4.4 Quantification\n\n \nMuch has been written about the way in which Le\u015bniewski\nunderstood the quantifiers \u2018for some\u2019 \\((\\exists)\\) and\n\u2018for all\u2019 \\((\\forall)\\). There are three aspects to the\ncontroversy: (1) how the quantifiers are to be read; (2) how they are\nto be understood; and (3) the logical and philosophical significance\nof the way they are understood. The controversy arose principally\nbecause of a discrepancy between the way in which Le\u015bniewski and\nLe\u015bniewskians take the quantifiers to mean, and the orthodox way\nof understanding them, as formulated in particular by Quine.\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s student Lejewski recounts how after moving from\nPoland to Britain he was surprised to find that the local (Quinean)\nunderstanding was very different from the one he had grown up\nwith. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Le\u015bniewski did\nnot produce or even envisage a semantics for his logic, considering,\nas had Frege and Russell, that his system was already meaningful and\nhad no need of a semantics to be grafted onto it from\noutside. Historically it is interesting that Quine\u2019s preoccupation\nwith the idea of ontological commitment and its connection to\nquantification and its domain, go back to discussions he had with\nLe\u015bniewski when he visited Warsaw in 1933. Quine relates that he\nand Le\u015bniewski stayed up until late at night disputing whether\nthe use of higher-order variables committed Le\u015bniewski to\nplatonic objects, as Quine thought, or not, as Le\u015bniewski\nthought. Obviously to a nominalist like Le\u015bniewski the thought\nthat his cherished system should involve him in unwanted ontological\ncommitments would be most repugnant.\n\n As to the reading of the quantifiers, while we note that in his\npre-symbolic writings Le\u015bniewski favored expressions like\n\u201cfor some meaning of the expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019\n\u201d and \u201cfor every meaning of the expression\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 \u201d, which may give us a hint as to how\nhe understood quantification, he later preferred the unadorned\n\u2018for some\u2019 and \u2018for all\u2019, followed by the\nrelevant variables, and it seems sensible simply to follow this.\n\n The meaning or interpretation of the quantifiers is a more subtle\nquestion. It seems very likely that Le\u015bniewski thought of the\nquantifiers as a notational necessity when a domain could be infinite,\nsince infinite disjunctions and conjunctions were not possible. In\nProtothetic, as its computational variant makes clear, there is\nstrictly no need for quantifiers, since each semantic category, no\nmatter how high in the hierarchy, has only finitely many possible\n(extensional) values. But in Ontology, where there is no logical\nrequirement that the domain of individuals be finite, the quantifiers\nare indispensable. One thing for sure is that they cannot be given an\nexistentially committed reading, where \u2018for some\u2019 means\n\u2018there exists\u2019. The reason is that the laws of\nquantification and the definability in Ontology of a necessarily empty\nterm \u2018\\(\\Lambda\\)\u2019, for which it is true that no \\(\\Lambda\\)\nexists, entail the truth of the quantified proposition \u2018for\nsome \\(a\\), no \\(a\\) exists\u2019 (cf. T.127 of\n\u201cDefinitions and Theses of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Ontology\u201d\nin S. Lesniewski\u2019s Lecture Notes in Logic). This would be\ncontradictory if \u2018for some\u2019 meant \u2018there\nexists\u2019. Le\u015bniewski always used the expression\n\u2018particular quantifier\u2019 rather than \u2018existential\nquantifier\u2019. So the question is how the quantifiers are to be\nunderstood if not in the standard way.\n\n Quine took from his discussions with Le\u015bniewski the idea that\nthe quantifiers were somehow substitutional. There is an element of\ntruth in this. A universally quantified formula\n\\(\\forall X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)\u2014\\(X\\)\u2014\\(\\urcorner\\)\nlicenses the inference to any formula \u2014\\(C\\)\u2014\nobtained by substituting any well-formed expression \\(C\\) of the\nappropriate category in place of the bound variable \\(X\\), and\nlikewise for all the other variables occurring bound by the same\nquantifier. Dually, from \u2014\\(C\\)\u2014 one may infer\n\\(\\exists X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)\u2014\\(X\\)\u2014\\(\\urcorner\\) for\nsuitable categories of bound variable. These are the usual quantifier\nrules, liberalized to apply to any categories of variable in batches\nof one or more. So for example if there is a theorem universally\nquantifying nominal variables, such as\n\u2018\\(\\forall a\\ulcorner\\)any \\(a\\) is an\n\\(a\\urcorner\\)\u2019, we can validly infer \u2018any \\(\\Lambda\\) is a\n\\(\\Lambda\\)\u2019 even though the name is empty. Quine assumed that the\nlack of ontological commitment must entail that the quantifiers range\nover expressions rather than things. This would not have been\nacceptable to Le\u015bniewski, because it would constitute use/mention\nconfusion, and because while it is true for the nominalist that there\nare only finitely many expressions, it is not known to be true, and\nmay in fact be false, that there are only finitely many things.\n\n Is there then a third way to understand the quantifiers that is\nneither referential nor substitutional? Such a way has been suggested\nby Guido K\u00fcng, based on the young Le\u015bniewski\u2019s reading of\nthe quantifiers as \u201cfor all [some] meanings of the variable\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 \u201d. Take this preamble to be what\nK\u00fcng calls a prologue functor, which mentions\nthe expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, but takes its matrix (the part\nafter the quantifier, within the upper corners) to be a context of\nuse of the variable, and takes the variables to range over\nmeanings, in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s case, extensions (K\u00fcng 1977).\nAgain there is something right and something wrong about this. If\nextensions are (as standardly understood) various kinds of sets,\nnothing could be more abhorrent to Le\u015bniewski. He laid great\nstore on logic\nnot being committed to the existence of anything, being\nontologically neutral: no existence statement is a theorem of\nany of his systems. So to have found that after all he is committed, by\nthe back door as it were, to the hated sets, would have been a bitter\nblow. The correct insight of this understanding is that neither objects\nnor expressions are what quantifier expressions range over. They do\nnot range over extensions either: they do not range over\nanything. But for each category of expression there are numerous ways\nin which an expression of that category can mean. A sentence can be\ntrue or it can be false. A name can name one thing, or several\nthings, all things, or no things at all. Functor expressions mean\naccording to the way the outputs of their combinations mean when\ntheir inputs have certain meanings. Given a domain of individuals, in\nprinciple all possible ways of meaning are delimited for all categories\nof expression. Quantifiers tap into this potentiality. But it goes\nagainst the nominalist grain of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s thought to\nreify all the different potential ways an expression could mean as if\nthese were additional objects. So when Le\u015bniewski told Quine his\nuse of quantified variables in categories other than names did not\ncommit him to platonic objects, he was being truthful. What he was\ncommitted to, from the moment he accepted bivalence of truth and\nfalsity onwards, was that expressions of the various categories may be\nvariously meaningful.\n4.5 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Aversion to Semantics\n\n \nWe have seen how Le\u015bniewski developed his logical systems in\nthe struggle to provide an antinomy-free foundation for mathematics,\ncomparable to those of Frege or Whitehead and Russell, but without\ntheir defects. His gradual move from a highly stylized\nprose-with-variables to fully formalized systems precluded him from\nconsidering his logic as an uninterpreted system, as did Hilbert. From\nthe start, he considered his systems, even the fully formalized ones,\nto be comprised of constant expressions, primitive and defined, with a\nfixed intended meaning, which he attempted to make clear by examples\nand elucidations. He also considered all his axioms and theorems to be\ntrue. In this he was following Frege and Russell, who likewise did not\nenvisage an external source as somehow conveying a meaning upon\nexpressions and truth upon sentences of logic.\n\n This attitude to logic began to be overtaken by the development of\nlogical semantics, not least at the hands of his own former student\nTarski. The turning point came with the publication of Tarski\u2019s\nessay on the concept of truth in the languages of deductive sciences.\nThis paper was produced in a preliminary version in 1929\u201330,\nupdated when G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results became known in\n1931, and eventually published in Polish in 1933. Le\u015bniewski was\nknown to be opposed to it. There are probably two reasons for this. One\nis that in his metalogical apparatus Tarski avails himself of set\ntheory. Even though his use is not extensive, it is an incursion of set\ntheory into the metatheory of logic, of which Le\u015bniewski could not\nbut disapprove. The other reason is probably that whereas in earlier\nparts of the monograph Tarski adheres faithfully to a conception of\nfinite types akin to Le\u015bniewski\u2019s theory of semantic\ncategories, in later parts he distances himself from this as an\nunwarranted restriction and accepts the propriety of transfinite\ntypes.\n\n There is in fact nothing inherently anti-semantic about\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logical systems. They may be given more\nstandard formulations and considered model-theoretically (cf. Stachniak\n1981). They may also be investigated metalogically in their own terms,\nand without reneging on Le\u015bniewski\u2019s scruples about abstract\nentities. The fact is that few people have considered it worth the\neffort of pursuing the project.\n5. Mature Systems\n\n \nThroughout the 1920s, Le\u015bniewski and his students worked hard\nto improve the logical systems by finding single axioms, shorter\naxioms, trying out new primitives, and generally seeking logical\nperfection. The work, and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s involvement in\nteaching, were so intense that for several years he published nothing.\nAs this became something of an embarrassment, since his results were\nbeing quoted without being in print, he resolved to postpone a fully\nsystematic exposition and present instead a more autobiographical\naccount of how the systems arose and were improved. This took the form\nof two series of articles from 1927\u201331. One series, \u2018O\npodstawach matematyki\u2019 [\u2018On the Foundations of\nMathematics\u2019] appeared in the premier Polish philosophy journal\nPrzegl\u0105d Filozoficzny, and, eschewing mathematical\nsymbolism, was dedicated to an up-to-date exposition of Mereology. The\nother series, \u2018Grundz\u00fcge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen\nder Mathematik\u2019 [\u2018Fundamentals of a New System of the\nFoundations of Mathematics\u2019] began to appear in 1929 in the\nmathematical journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, and was\ndedicated to Protothetic. Its 81 pages and 11 sections ended with the\npromise \u2018Fortsetzung folgt\u2019, \u2018Continuation\nfollows\u2019, but it did not, because in the meantime Le\u015bniewski\nhad fallen out with the other editors of the journal over the status of\nset theory. The article did not get beyond the preliminaries of\nProtothetic, setting out the history, axioms, and rules (directives)\nfor extending the system, and outlining a number of variants, but not\nstarting the deductions proper. It was not until a new logic journal\nCollectanea Logica was set up in 1938 that Le\u015bniewski was\nable to continue. After a 60-page introduction to the continuation,\n\u2018Einleitende Bemerkungen zur Fortsetzung meiner Mitteilung u.d.T.\n\u201cGrundz\u00fcge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der\nMathematik\u201d \u2019, summarizing the earlier article and bringing\nthe story up to date, there followed another 83 pages comprising\nSection 12, and listing twelve definitions and 422 theorems of\nProtothetic, with skeletal information about how they are derived,\nexpressed in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own idiosyncratic notation for the\nconnectives and quantifiers. The journal did not appear in print\nbecause of the outbreak of the Second World War: the printing plates\nfrom which offprints had fortunately been made were destroyed in the\nbombing of Warsaw in September 1939, by which time Le\u015bniewski was\nalready dead.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own notation for Protothetic is explained in\n\u2018Supplementary Remark III\u2019 of the Introductory Remarks:\none-place connectives are made up of a horizontal bar\n\u2018\u2013\u2019 supplementable at either end by a vertical bar\n\u2018|\u2019. A bar at the right-hand end of the line signifies the\nconnective gives output value T(rue) for input value T, the absence of\na bar signifies the output value for input T is F(alse).  Similarly a\nbar at the left-hand end of the line signifies output value T for\ninput value F, the absence of a bar signifies output F for input\nF. The four extensional one-place connectives are thus systematically\nnotated, with negation, the most important, written as\n\u2018\\(\\vdash\\)\u2019. For two-place connectives bars are added\nradially as spokes to a circular central hub\n\u2018\\(\\circ\\)\u2019. As before the presence of a bar indicates an\noutput value T, its absence an output value F. The top position is for\nfirst and second inputs F, the bottom position for first and second\ninputs T, the left position for first input T and second input F, the\nright position for first input F and second input T. Thus all sixteen\npossibilities are catered for. For example the conjunction connective\nis written \u2018\\(\\koppa\\)\u2019. If one connective H is contained\ngeometrically in another G, the implication G\\((pq) \\rightarrow\\)\nH\\((pq)\\) holds, and merging two connectives gives a connective\nequivalent to their conjunction. While this notation is systematic and\nelegant, it has never caught on. Like \u0141ukasiewicz,\nLe\u015bniewski always puts the connective before its arguments, but\nhe encloses the arguments in parentheses, thus the conjunction of\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is written \u2018\\(\\koppa(pq)\\)\u2019. The reason\nfor parentheses, which \u0141ukasiewicz could dispense with, will\nbecome clear. In this \u201cofficial\u201d notation, the only\nquantifier is the universal, written by placing the variables bound\nbetween lower corners, as for example \u2018 \\(\\llcorner\npqf\\lrcorner\\) \u2019, and placing the quantifier scope or matrix\nwithin upper corners, so for example \u2018\\(\\llcorner pqf\\lrcorner\n\\ulcorner \\koppa(f(pq)f(qp))\\urcorner\\)\u2019 is\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s way of writing what we write as\n\u2018\\(\\forall pqf\\ulcorner f(pq) \\wedge f(qp)\\urcorner\\)\u2019. In\nhis everyday logical work and derivations however, Le\u015bniewski\nused a slightly modified version of Whitehead and\nRussell\u2019s Principia Mathematica notation.\n\n Among the variant versions of Protothetic Le\u015bniewski mentions in\nhis 1929 article, one is a single-axiom version containing 82 signs.\n(In 1945 Soboci\u0144ski produced a single axiom version with 54 signs\nonly.) The other and more interesting idea is an algorithmic or\n\u201ccomputative\u201d system of Protothetic, mentioned above in\nSection 8. This is in effect a way to formalize the idea of\ntruth-tables, but applied beyond truth-functions of sentences to more\ncomplex functors with arguments of first and higher order\ntruth-functions. Le\u015bniewski does not take the idea very far, but\nit was subsequently developed further by Owen Le Blanc (1991).\n\n To modern students of logic accustomed to streamlined methods of\nworking with propositional logic, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Protothetic,\nespecially in its \u201cofficial\u201d versions, must appear very\ncumbersome and difficult to understand and work with. In part this is a\nquestion of the age of the systems and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s aversion\nto semantics (see above). However, Le\u015bniewski did not\nalways present his work so fiercely. For purposes of everyday\nderivation he employed what can only be described as a system of\nnatural deduction, making assumptions, following their consequences,\ncollecting them and inferring conditionals and biconditionals, in the\nmanner to which all students of logic have since become accustomed.\nAstonishingly, neither he nor any of his students thought fit to codify\nthese practices into a system of rules. This was done instead at\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s suggestion by Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski.\nThe discovery of natural deduction is generally attributed to others,\nbut there is a chance that Le\u015bniewski used it, in a recognizably\nmodern form, earlier than others. That he did not codify it probably\nresulted from his viewing it as a pedagogical device and a way of\nsketching out how a \u201cproper\u201d (i.e. axiomatic) proof was to\ngo. Another way to take some of the forbidding appearance out of\nProtothetic is to look for more readily comprehensible axioms. The\nfollowing two-axiom set based on implication as the primitive (an\nalternative Le\u015bniewski also looked at) is rather straightforward;\nthe result was again obtained by Tarski:\n\n\\[\\tag{P3}\n\\forall pq\\ulcorner p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p)\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{P4}\n\\forall pqrf \\ulcorner f (rp) \\rightarrow \n(f (r (p \\rightarrow \\forall s\\ulcorner\\rs\\urcorner) ) \\rightarrow f (rq) )\n\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nThe first is the universal closure of a standard axiom of\npropositional calculus going back to Frege. Recalling that F(alse) can\nbe defined as \\(\\forall s\\ulcorner s\\urcorner\\) and negation as\n\\(p \\rightarrow\\) F, the second is the universal closure of\n\n\\[\nf (rp) \\rightarrow(f (r {\\sim}p) \\rightarrow f (rq))\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhich simply says that if \\(f (r\\) any truth-value) then\n\\(f(rq)\\) for arbitrary \\(q\\), and that it\nobviously correct. It can be (tediously) checked that the result is\nvalid for all sixteen extensional binary truth-functions substitutable\nfor \u2018\\(f\\) \u2019. Dragging the whole of Protothetic out\nof these simple beginnings is obviously much harder, and depends on\ncoming up with suitable definitions for the connectives.\n\n In Ontology, Le\u015bniewski and his students, particularly\nSoboci\u0144ski, worked on replacing the 1920 \u201clong\u201d\nsingle axiom by a shorter one, eventually arriving at the\nunshortenable\n\n\\[\\tag{OS}\n\\forall Aa\\ulcorner A \\isa a \\leftrightarrow \\exists B \\ulcorner A \\isa B \\wedge B \\isa a\\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nThis axiom gives a much less obvious insight into the intended\nmeaning of \u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019 than the original 1920 axiom. For a\ndelicately balanced combination of brevity with clarity the following\nequivalent two-axiom set is perspicuous:\n\n\\[\\tag{OS1}\n\\forall Ab\\ulcorner A \\isa b \\rightarrow A \\isa A\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{OS2}\n\\forall ABc \\ulcorner(A \\isa B \\wedge B \\isa c) \\rightarrow A \\isa c\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhere notably the first axiom is precisely the one that\nLe\u015bniewski mentioned to Twardowski in 1919.\n\n Although Ontology is perhaps the most generally interesting of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems, it was known during his lifetime less\nthrough his own published work, which was confined to a short,\ntechnical and inaccessible memoir, but through a gentle and\nsympathetic exposition in Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s 1929 widely read and\ninfluential Warsaw textbook known simply as the\nElementy. Kotarbi\u0144ski explains how he had no need to\ncome up with a logical system of names and predicates, since he could\nget one ready-made from a firm with an excellent\nreputation. Le\u015bniewski was duly grateful for the plug.\n\n The fact that the basic sentence-module in Ontology is singular\ninclusion of the form \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019\nhas misled some commentators into thinking that Le\u015bniewski turned\nhis back on the Fregean notion of predication as functional\napplication and instead reverted to a medieval \u201ctwo-name\u201d\naccount of predication. Indeed, except for the matter of tense,\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s account of the truth-conditions of such singular\nsentences\u2014that they are true if and only if the subject term\ndenotes a single object and the predicate term denotes one or more\nobjects of which this is one\u2014is almost exactly the same as that\ngiven by the medieval nominalist William of Ockham. However, whether\nor not Ockham was a two-name theorist, Le\u015bniewski definitely was\nnot. The general form of the singular sentence is the same as that of\nany binary predication, \\(f(ab)\\), or in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s notation, \\(f\\{ab\\}\\). Singular\ninclusion is no syncategorematic copula: it is a special binary\npredicate. That it is chosen as the primitive is understandable but\nnot compulsory. Le\u015bniewski knew that other predicates than\n\u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019 could be taken as primitive, a fact emphasized\nlater by Lejewski.\n\n It was in Mereology, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s oldest system, that there were\nthe most varied developments. The 1927\u201330 article series on\nMereology as part of the foundations of mathematics rang the changes\nin possible primitives. After scathing attacks on Whitehead\u2019s and\nRussell\u2019s use/mention confusions in Principia, and on\nstandard set theories, he retraces the formal development of his 1916\npaper, noting in a long footnote the similarities with Whitehead\u2019s\ntheory of events, whose formal development he also criticises. He\nthen summarizes the development up to 1920, continuing with additional\nresults unpublished in 1916, taking the number of theorems up to\n198. Further chapters tidy up the axiomatization in terms of\n\u2018part\u2019, and show that \u2018ingredient\u2019 can be\ntaken as primitive. The theorems are taken up to 264, then\n\u2018exterior\u2019 is shown to be a possible primitive. There the\ndevelopment is arrested, and a final section discusses singular\npropositions of the form \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019, with a note on how to understand propositions about\na thing which changes. Using the example \u2018Warsaw of 1830 is\nsmaller than Warsaw of 1930\u2019, Le\u015bniewski proposes to\nconsider \u2018Warsaw in 1830\u2019 and \u2018Warsaw in 1930\u2019\nas denoting time-slices of the temporally much longer object he calls\n\u2018Warsaw from the beginning to the end of its\nexistence\u2019. In this way he claims to bring many uses of\n\u2018is\u2019 in ordinary language within the scope of an analysis\nusing his Ontology. This four-dimensional understanding of ordinary\nobjects is now commonplace, but at that time it was something of a\nrarity. The discussion is one of the few places in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\nmature work where he indulges in anything similar to the philosophical\nlogic of his early years. Otherwise, when not discussing formal\nsystems and proving theorems, his prose discussions tend to be\nintemperate though frequently justified criticisms of the statements\nof others, most especially the proponents of standard set theory.\n6. Personality and Legacy\n6.1 Le\u015bniewski as a Person\n\n \nNormally the character of an academic is of marginal relevance to his\nor her work. In the case of Le\u015bniewski there is reason to think\notherwise. The extreme rigor that he applied in logic, the\nunflinchingly high standards he set himself and others, his blank\nincomprehension of intellectual, formal and linguistic inexactness,\nand his willingness to let academic disagreement sour his\nrelationships with colleagues, all speak of an unusual rigidity. This\nseems to have been deeply anchored: of his school days we know little\nother than that he was intolerant of exceptions to any rule, whether\nor not the rule was sensible. After one of his early Polish essays was\ntypeset with a spelling mistake in the title\n(\u2018\u015brodku\u2019 instead of \u2018\u015brodka\u2019), he\nalways quoted the incorrect title, because to correct it would have\nbeen to break the rule that quotation must be literal and exact. In\nhis early years he nursed the project of translating Anton Marty\u2019s\nrambling and polemical 1908 treatise Untersuchungen zur\nGrundlegung der allgemeinen Grammatik und Sprachphilosophie\n[Investigations on the Founding of General Grammar and Philosophy\nof Language]. He never got beyond the second word of the title,\n\u2018zur\u2019, which is admittedly not easily captured in all its\nnuances\u2014it can mean \u2018toward\u2019 as well as\n\u2018on\u2019 or \u2018about\u2019. Having carried a copy of the\nbook around for some time and asked all his friends and colleagues how\nthey would translate \u2018zur\u2019, he gave up. No doubt his\ninterests shifted, but the incident demonstrates both his\npunctiliousness and his inflexibility.\n\nBiographical material about Le\u015bniewski is fairly sparse, and it\nis even harder to gain a clear idea of what he was like as a person. Jadacki (2016) contains much new information about Le\u015bniewski, his family, and his relationships with colleagues and contemporaries, but even here the man behind the words and (invariably unsmiling) photographs is not easily discernible.\nA photograph of him in Twardowski\u2019s seminar in 1913 shows a short,\ndapper man with a goatee and a flamboyant neckscarf, as described by\n\u0141ukasiewicz. In later photographs from the same period he lacks the\ngoatee but retains a moustache. Two well-known later photos show a\nstiffly-posed, stocky, clean-shaven man in a business suit with the\nslicked-back hair of the period, looking more like a bank manager than\na professor of logic, except for an intense stare. Le\u015bniewski was\nknown to be a fierce critic of what he considered unclear, which was\npretty well everything. His stock complaint was that he could not\nunderstand what speakers were saying, or writers were writing. In the\nlight of his pathological inability to see beyond the literal meaning\non the page to any intended but inaccurately expressed meaning this is\nunsurprising, but also unendearing. In the early 1920s Marjan\nBorowski, the editor of\nPrzegl\u0105d Filozoficzny, complained to Twardowski that\npeople were afraid to submit papers or give talks in Warsaw because\nthey were fearful of being criticised by Le\u015bniewski, though he\nadded with some glee that the scourge of God had risen up against him\nin the shape of one Tajtelbaum \u2013 the young Tarski. Even the\nphlegmatic Twardowski found his former student irritating: in a diary\nentry for 12 August 1930 he complains, \u201cIn general those who\nbehave according to Lesniewski\u2019s model ask very arbitrarily for\nanalysis where it is convenient to them\u2014if, however, one of them\nasks for analysis where it is not convenient to him, they turn to\nintuition. And if the opposer in the discussion sometimes tries to\nturn to intuition, they reply \u2018We don\u2019t understand what\nyou consider to be intuitively given\u2019.\u201d Twardowski\u2019s 1921\npaper \u2018Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia\u2019 is a plea for\nphilosophers not to put symbols above things, and while its ostensible target is the French physicist Henri Bouasse, it is clearly implicitly directed\nagainst \u0141ukasiewicz and Le\u015bniewski and their students.\n\n Le\u015bniewski was however not lacking in a certain heavy humor.\nLejewski reported that he once mocked a Warsaw Professor of Classics\nfor wearing sunglasses (then rather rare): \u201cIs the world too dazzling for\nhim?\u201d He was equably resigned to his lectures being sparsely\nattended because of their extreme technicality. One semester,\nunexpectedly many students turned up at the first lecture. He looked\naround the room in surprise and asked \u201cWhat are you all doing\nhere? I am not Bergson.\u201d For those who were just there for the\nsake of doing a course and clocking up their attendance he quietly\nsigned off their lecture books straight away, and told them not to\nworry about coming again. The few die-hards came for the sake of the\nlogic. Le\u015bniewski would enter the lecture room with a briefcase\nstuffed with papers, root around, find where he had got to and\ncarry on, writing formulas and explaining how they were derived. When\nQuine visited some of these lectures, he was able to follow them\ndespite knowing no Polish.\n Le\u015bniewski married in 1913: his wife Zofia Prewysz-Kwinto\ncame of a landed family from Kimborciszki (Kimbarti\u0161k\u0117) in rural\nLithuania. They had no children. Before World War I Le\u015bniewski\nseems to have had the means to travel around to different German\ncities to study, and to spend time after his doctorate in Paris, San\nRemo and St. Petersburg.\n\n Le\u015bniewski inspired devotion in a very small coterie of students,\na few of whom stayed fiercely loyal, but sooner or later he ended up\nalienating nearly everyone, either through his robust professional\nopinions, or his manner, or his political views. He started out as a\nradical socialist\u2014his decision to spend the war in Russia was\npartly personal and partly political\u2014but after the excesses of\nthe October Revolution and its aftermath he rejected socialism. From\nthe 1920s he supported the authoritarianism of J\u00f3zef\nPi\u0142sudski, but from about 1930 his views took on a darker\nanti-Semitic tinge. An unsavory letter written to Twardowski in 1935\ncomplains of \u201cfilthy tricks\u201d being played on him \u201cby\ncertain Jew-boys or their foreign friends\u201d, declares a personal\nantipathy to Tarski, whose career he would not obstruct, but admits he\n\u201cwould be extraordinarily pleased if some day I were to read in\nthe newspapers that he was being offered a full professorship, for\nexample in Jerusalem, from where he could send us offprints of his\nvaluable works to our great profit.\u201d Tarski had been passed over\nfor the chair in Lw\u00f3w, which went to Chwistek on the strength of\npraise from Russell, even though the Varsovians, including\nLe\u015bniewski, had supported Tarski. Tarski certainly felt aggrieved\nand no doubt suspected anti-Semitic motives, but like Le\u015bniewski\nhe was prickly and sensitive about matters of priority. It is in\nretrospect mildly grotesque to see how carefully Le\u015bniewski and\nTarski dance around each other in their prefaces and acknowledgements,\nneither wishing to give public offence to the other. Despite their\ndisagreements and suspicions however, they long continued to meet once a week,\nwith no one else present, to discuss logic.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s antipathy towards set theory was so vehement and\nhis criticisms so intemperate that it led to a break in relations with\nhis set-theoretically minded mathematical colleagues Sierpi\u0144ski\nand Kuratowski; he resigned from the editorial board of Fundamenta\nMathematicae, with the result that he was no longer able to\npublish his own work there. By the end of his life, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\nonly surviving close friend was the saintly patient and faithful\nKotarbi\u0144ski, who alone of his colleagues visited him in hospital\nin his last illness. They had been born just days apart in\n1886. The cancer that killed Le\u015bniewski was no doubt exacerbated\nby smoking: cigars and a large pipe. During the operation he was\nconscious and without anaesthetic because of the dangers and he was\nallowed to smoke even then to distract himself from the pain. But he\ndid not recover, and died sitting in his favourite armchair, brought\nspecially into the hospital.\n6.2 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Legacy\n\n \nOf the students that Le\u015bniewski had taught at Warsaw, some went\non to logical and philosophical careers of their own, most notably\nTarski, whom Le\u015bniewski correctly recognized as a genius, and who\nwent on to outshine his teacher. Among those who stayed fairly close\nto Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own views were Jerzy S\u0142upecki, Boles\u0142aw\nSoboci\u0144ski, Czes\u0142aw Lejewski, and Henry Hi\u017c. The first\nthree in particular contributed after World War II to the\nreconstruction of many of the logical results that had been lost in\n1944. Serendipitously recovered students\u2019 notes from\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s lectures, translated and published in 1988, give\nsome idea of the detail of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s teaching, but his\nlectures ranged more widely than the extant works show. At all times\nhowever, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logical position was a minority one, which\nwas respected while being rejected, and it won few converts after his\ndeath. The reasons for his sidelining have been analysed by\nGrzegorczyk (1955). Le\u015bniewski\u2019s work was developed in the 1920s\nwhen an axiomatic approach was standard, as in Hilbert\u2019s school, but\nhis negative attitude to semantics as a separable part of logic meant\nhe was unsympathetic to the shift towards a semantic approach\ninitiated by Tarski, and he would have remained opposed even had he\nlived longer. His vituperative rejection of set theory made him no\nfriends and many enemies among mathematicians, while his unwillingness\nand inability to find anything worthwhile in the works of philosophers\nlost him their sympathy. His obsessive concern for the minute detail\nof axiomatizations was unattractive to many when more streamlined\nmethods were available, and his radical nominalism made the\npresentation of logic according to his principles a matter of extreme\ninconvenience. Even Tarski, who was initially very much a follower,\nhad to admit that Le\u015bniewski\u2019s conception of logical systems as\nconcrete collections of inscriptions growing in time through the\naddition of new theses made them \u201cthoroughly unrewarding objects\nfor methodological and semantic research\u201d.\n\n In retrospect we can see Le\u015bniewski\u2019s obsession with the\nfine detail of axiomatics and his rejection of semantics as conditioned\nby his own idiosyncratic development and the predominant research\ninterests of the 1910s and 1920s. It is in fact possible to apply more\nstandard metalogical considerations to his systems, such as\ninvestigating them for consistency and completeness. However, the\ndifficulties and complications of working within the confines of a\nfully nominalistic attitude\u2014sans sets, sans\nabstract expression types\u2014have put off all but a very few, and\nthe relative ease with which results can be obtained when fewer\nontological scruples are in play makes Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems\nand others like them interesting mainly to certain philosophers, while\nmathematicians and mathematical logicians have by-passed them.\n\n On the other hand, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s concerns for the proprieties\nof quotation and use/mention, the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction, canons of correct definition, and his development of\nMereology as the dominant formal theory of part and whole have all\npassed into the mainstream, and the logical expertise he helped to\ninstil into a generation of Poles contributed in large part to making\nWarsaw the premier interbellum location for mathematical logic. In the\nentrance to the 1999 University of Warsaw Library building stand four\nconcrete pillars and sculptures by Adam Myjak, celebrating the\nphilosophical achievements of Poland. The figures represented are\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s teacher Twardowski, his colleague\n\u0141ukasiewicz, his student Tarski, and Le\u015bniewski himself.\n",
