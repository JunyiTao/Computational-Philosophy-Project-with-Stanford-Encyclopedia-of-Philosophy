    "main_text": "The Perfect, Ideal Self\n2. The Perfect, Ideal Self\n\n\nVolitional choice therefore has a built-in normative feature in the\nform of an idea of a better state or self. But self-realization\nmeans more than this for ethical theory, for it purportedly represents\nthe over-arching, ultimate goal of moral action, which entails some\nidea of a perfect, ideal self that is being aimed at. This raises\nan epistemic problem. With individual cases, such as the addict\ncontemplating his situation, it may be that he gets an idea of how he\nmight change by observing other people or considering how he used to be\nbefore becoming an addict. But how can anyone know what the ideal\nself is, the superior self that is not merely better, but best?\nAnswering this is crucial if Bradley\u2019s ethical theory is not to\nfall victim to a criticism he made of Mill\u2019s thesis about the\nqualities of pleasures (Utilitarianism, Chapter 2).\nBradley leveled a barrage of criticisms against any theory, Utilitarian\nor otherwise, that proposed the maximization of pleasure as the\nultimate moral goal. The central objection was that since\npleasures are a \u201cperishing series,\u201d with each one passing\naway once it has been experienced, it is not possible to accumulate a\nsum of pleasures, and since there are always more pleasures available\nthan anyone has experienced, Mill\u2019s moral goal of maximizing\npleasant states was meaningless. But introducing the idea of\nqualitatively different kinds of pleasures that can be ranked suggests\nthat perhaps the hedonist can, after all, successfully articulate the\nself we should be aiming at. Perhaps the best self\u2014the ideal\nmoral self\u2014is the one that pursues the highest type of pleasure.\n\n\n In evaluating this Bradley stresses the relative,\ncomparative nature of terms such as \u2018higher\u2019 and\n\u2018lower\u2019. Contrast terms such as\n\u2018superior\u2019 and \u2018inferior\u2019 invite us to ask,\n\u201cin respect of what is A higher than, or superior to,\nB?\u201d Bradley insists that if I say Sally is superior\nto Joan I must first be comparing them in terms of some characteristic\nthey share\u2014for example, both are beautiful\u2014and, second, I am\npositioning them on a scale, which is conceived in terms of two\ndeterminate termini. We can perhaps see the point here by\nimagining what happens when, having said Sally is superior to Joan, we\nare next asked to rank Mary. If Mary is judged superior (in\nbeauty) to both, then she is being placed between Sally and someone who\nis right at the top of the scale. Mill\u2019s account of\nsuperior pleasures fails because he never explains what the scale is\nthat is being used and so never explains what the \u2018highest\u2019\nkind of pleasure is. Whether this criticism survives\nscrutiny does not matter all that much as far as the fate of hedonism\nis concerned, for Bradley\u2019s attack on qualitative hedonism is\nnothing short of thorough and he thinks there is no convincing case\nMill can make in support of it. For example, Mill\u2019s\ncompetent judges cannot say that this ranking just \u201cfeels\u201d\nright, for that is to confess that the talk of ranking is meaningless\nsince one could have just as well \u201cranked\u201d them\ndifferently. And the ranking cannot be made in terms of\nMary\u2019s beauty, because that is the quality that makes Mary a\ncandidate for placement on the scale in the first place; which leads\nBradley to hold, as did most of Mill\u2019s critics, that unless the\nwhole business really is nonsense, there must some criterion other than\npleasure being used and so Mill has given up hedonism. These, and\nsome other arguments are independent of the issue about knowing the\nupper limit end of the scale of pleasures That issue is\nimportant, however, because it marks a problem Bradley\u2019s theory\nof self-realization should also have to face: namely, that talk\nof a \u2018superior\u2019 or \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018more\nperfect\u2019 moral person would require an explication of the upper\nlimit of the scale these evaluations are employing. This seems a\nreasonable demand, for even apart from the question of whether judging\nsomething to be better than something else entails knowing what is\nbest, Bradley\u2019s thesis is not just that we try to become better\nwith each choice and action, but that we want to be the best possible,\nto be perfect moral agents.\n\n\nFortunately, Bradley has an answer. In the passage from\nEthical Studies quoted above Bradley said that in our\ntheoretical attempts at understanding the world we want to make our set\nof empirical beliefs coherent, and since we assume as a working\nhypothesis that the external world is systematic, a contradiction in\nour beliefs would indicate we have not yet arrived at the coherence and\nconsistency that is demanded. In addition, our empirical belief\nset has to include all the facts, has to be comprehensive.\nBradley claims a similar objective applies to intentional agents.\nWe look to produce a self that is an organic whole in which all is\nrelated so as to render it a system rather than a mere collection of\nrandom acts and characteristics. Yet it must also seek to be all\nit can become rather than living \u201cthe life of an\noyster.\u201d These two aspects he calls\n\u2018homogeneity\u2019 and \u2018specificity\u2019 respectively\n(Ethical Studies, p.74), and they appear to parallel\n\u201ccoherent\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d as applied to a\nset of beliefs.\n\n\nTo show that we aim at being a whole, Bradley first offers some\nempirical evidence.\n\n\nTo the extent that people consider the consequences of their actions\nthey demonstrate that they do not see their actions as disconnected\nfrom other things they have done and might do, and they subordinate\nsome ends to wider goals. That is, ordinary people not only\ndisplay a degree of prudence in making choices but also recognize that\nthe value of some actions is that they are means to more important\ngoals. In fact, he claims that most people act with some \u201cideal\nof life,\u201d or some idea of what would make them perfectly happy,\nhowever vaguely expressed, and this orders their lives, governing their\nchoices and actions. In a word, normal lives of mature adults are\nat least relatively systematic. Moreover, if a person has become\nhabituated to act in certain ways, has developed a disposition to act\nthus and so, then her actions will tend to be relatively\nconsistent. This sort of person has what Bradley calls a\n\u201cstanding will\u201d and it explains why those who know someone\nwell can predict what this person will do with a considerable\ndegree of certainty and why that person feels pleased that others know\nshe can be counted on to act appropriately. There is, in other words, a\nstructure to her actions suggesting her inner life\u2014her desires,\ndispositions, values and so on\u2014is unified. She is like an\norganism in that all these features work together as one unit, (= a\n\u201cwhole\u201d).\n\n\n Moving beyond empirical evidence,\nBradley claims that in volitional action \u201cthe self as a whole is,\nin the end, the content of our wills\u201d (Ethical Studies,\np. 71). In other words, in self-realization the ideal object with\nwhich the self will identify its ultimate satisfaction is a whole.\nThere are two articulations of this notion of a \u201cwhole\nself.\u201d First, Bradley notes that we find it natural to\nspeak of someone willing this or that, and we often speak of\nsomeone\u2019s will, as in \u201cher will to live.\u201d\nThis reveals two aspects of the will, of the individual person\ndeliberating and choosing a course of action. First, when Sally\nwills something there is a particular process that occurs in which\nSally deliberates, experiences certain desires or leanings toward one\nthing or another, eventually terminating in her doing such and\nsuch. Bradley calls this the particular aspect of the\nwill to indicate that volitional choice is geared toward specific\nactions in the world. Even if Sally cannot carry out her plans,\nsay because she is paralyzed, her willing still targets doing something\nspecific. On the other hand, when we say Sally has a will we are\nconceiving of her as persisting beyond any single specific choice, and\nseeing her as the owner and author of what she wills. Bradley\ncalls this the universal aspect of the will. The\n\u201cvolition as a whole \u00c9 is the unity of both these factors,\nand the projection or carrying of it out into external existence; the\nrealization both of the particular side, the this or that to be done,\nand the realization of the inner side of the self in the doing of\nit\u201d (Ethical Studies, p.72). The moral\nthesis of self-realization reflects the importance of both, for\ncreating our moral character through our choices and actions entails\nboth particular acts of will and a subsisting will that is\ndeveloped through these choices.\n\nIn his later articles on the will a volition is defined as \u201cthe\nself-realization of an idea with which the self is\nidentified.\u201d Again, this pictures a self that can identify\nwith an ideal object and can through action realize (bring\nabout) the state of affairs represented by the ideal object. When\nthis occurs the self is also realized because of its identification\nwith this object. The full analysis reveals five necessary\ncomponents:\n\n\nThere is (1) existence, (2) the idea of a change, and (3) the actual\nchange of the existence by the idea to (4) the idea\u2019s content.\nAnd (5) in this change the self feels itself realized. (Collected\nEssays, p. 477)\n\n\nThe self that entertains the ideal object (the intentional object)\nand identifies its satisfaction with that object and that feels\nsatisfaction when that object has become real in the world, must all be\nthe same self. This is the main point of saying that the will has\na universal aspect.\n\n\nThe thesis that we aim at being a whole is further illuminated by\nconsidering volitional choice from the inner perspective of the\nindividual moral agent. This agent is aware of being the same\nperson throughout specific acts of choosing\u2014an awareness of being the\n\u201cI\u201d that wills to do this or that. But at the same\ntime there is\u2014or should be\u2014some uncertainty about who or what this\n\u201cI\u201d is, for there is a dualism built right into the logical\nstructure of volitional choice in that it requires awareness of both\nthe existing state of the self and a superior state represented as a\npossible future state. Since both are felt to represent this\nperson a tension arises along with a desire to resolve the tension; so\nthere is, right at the heart the matter a kind of movement toward\nrestoring the unity of the self by overcoming the dualism that\nnecessarily exists in any volition. Later this sort of conflict\ngets introduced in Bradley\u2019s moral theory in terms of the\ndevelopment of, and the conflict between, the good self and the bad\nself.\n\nBradley next says that what we really desire is not merely to be a\nwhole, but an infinite whole. This introduces a\nparticular, and perhaps to some minds a peculiar, metaphysical\ndoctrine: that if A is dependent on B then A is not real in and\nof itself\u2014because it is defined by, or can only function\nthrough, its relationship to B. The real is independent; it is\nwhat it is in terms of its own features and functions. . (On this\nview \u2018real\u2019 is a normative term.) Something\nwhich has no external relations that impinge on what it is and can do\nis infinite. By contrast, a finite entity has something that\nlimits it. This relates to the analysis of the self of\nmoral action because, given this conception of what it means to be\n\u2018real\u2019\u2014as requiring total independence from anything else\nand thereby being free of all relations\u2014it would be analytic that the\ngoal of self-realization can be attained only if one could become an\ninfinite whole in Bradley\u2019s this technical sense of\n\u2018infinite\u2019. Of course, it is unlikely that the\neveryday moral agent has thought of her situation in these\nterms. But that is not necessary because each has a\nfelt impulse which points her in the right direction.\nExplaining this introduces yet another metaphysical doctrine,\nBradley\u2019s theory of immediate experience.\n\n\nThe best way to appreciate this theory is to consider the nature of\nthe most primitive stage of sensory experience. Some philosophers\nhave held that in our initial sensory states we have a subject or self\nconfronting and receiving information from an object\u2014which might be\neither a physical object or a sense-datum. The mistake here, in\nBradley\u2019s view, lies with the dualism this picture endorses, with\nthe idea that the initial experiences are ones in which the\nexperiencing self\u2019s consciousness is focused on an object.\nIn other words, these views see the initial stage of experience as\ncognitive (meaning there is an object before one\u2019s conscious\nawareness); in other words they are intentional mental states.\nBradley rejects this, arguing that there is level of a non-cognitive\nexperience at the foundation of all cognitive experiences. At\nthis logically prior level conscious experiences have no objects.\nBeing in pain is often offered as an example of this sort of mental\nstate. Bradley calls this level of experience\n\u201cfeeling\u201d to remind us that we are dealing with a\nnon-cognitive mental state below the level of thought; and it is also\ncalled \u201cimmediate experience\u201d because it is as yet\nunmediated by any mental operations such as attention and\nabstraction. The reason Bradley advances this view of immediate\nexperience lies with his analysis of the structure of thought.\nPut roughly, he claims that in judging that \u201cThe wolf is eating\nthe lamb,\u201d for example, we separate various aspects of what is\nimmediately given and assert a relationship between them, which\ninvolves mental operations such as attention and abstracting.\nOperations of this sort must be working on experience that is a\nnon-relational unity. (In a sense then, the argument for\nimmediate experience is transcendental, in the Strawsonian sense that\nit can be shown to be a necessary condition of the mental operations we\ncan and do perform.) Finally, at some point the subject-object or\nexperience-experienced dichotomy has to arise.\n\nThe details of Bradley\u2019s doctrine of immediacy need not detain us\nhere, but one point is of central importance: when we move to the\nhigher level of consciousness that entails intentional mental states\nthere supposedly remains a residual \u201cfeel\u201d of the unity of\nimmediate experience, and some residual sense of the\n\u201ccontents\u201d of immediate experience. This is relevant to\nthe question of why there is an impulse to become an infinite whole:\nit is because we carry a residual feel that all reality is a\nsystematic non-relational unity. In other words, there is a residual\ntrace of the primitive level of immediacy or feeling that moves us\ntoward wholeness in the sense that we feel at odds, incomplete, when\nwe conceive of ourselves as defined by our relations to\n\u2018things\u2019 and \u2018other selves\u2019. And when we\nconsider this along with the theory of the nature of thought, we\nrecognize that these experiences as they are expressed in statements\nactually leave out other aspects of the given and so are\nincomplete. In this way judgments are never completely accurate and\nonly partly true. (This is Bradley\u2019s theory of the degrees of truth.)\nThe consequence of this line of thinking for moral theory is that we\nhave a test by which to determine whether we have realized ourselves\nin a particular case: namely, have we arrived at a greater unity,\nwhich means fewer felt contradictions or explicit contradictions in\nour desires, our dispositions and the like? The ideal moral self is\nachieved when we arrive at a point at which it has no limiting\nrelations, which is to say, when we are an infinite whole, a\nsystematic organic unity. That we can be part way along in this\nprogress toward the ideal moral self, and in our understanding of what\nthe ideal moral self demands, reflects what will later become his\ntheory of degrees of reality. In the case of morality, one step on the\nroad to perfection occurs when we stop thinking of other people in our\ncommunity as forces or wills pitted against us\u2014that is, when we\nstop seeing our relations to them as external\u2014and begin to see\nothers as internally related to us. Being internally related to others\nin our community means that our relations to others are essential to\nus, in the sense of defining who and what we are. By contrast,\nexternal relations make no difference to their terms.  For example, my\nbeing in front of the Eiffel Tower is usually said to be an external\nrelation I bear to that object\u2014it does not make me a different\nperson. Put roughly, the difference between a mere collection of\npeople\u2014such as those who went to the parade yesterday\u2014and\na community or social unit such as a family\u2014lies in whether the\nrelationships each person bears to the others in the group makes a\ndifference to who and what they are. This internal bond is observed\nwhenever a member of the community talks of what \u201cwe\u201d\nbelieve, value, and so on. Here is the appearance of what has been\ncalled \u201cwe-intentionality.\u201d\n",
