Historical Antecedents to Current Views: Frege\n\nAs with many ideas discussed in contemporary philosophy of language,\nthe idea that propositions are structured is present in Gottlob\nFrege\u2019s writings. Frege had a view both about the constituents\nof structured propositions and about what held these constituents\ntogether in the proposition. Frege held that simple linguistic\nexpressions are associated with entities he called senses. Though\nthere is some controversy about precisely how to understand the notion\nof sense, Frege explicitly distinguishes the sense of a linguistic\nexpression from both the subjective ideas speakers associate with the\nexpression and the thing in the world the expression \u201cstands\nfor\u201d. Further, the sense of an expression determines what thing\nin the world the expression stands for. Thus the sense of a proper\nname such as \u2018Ronald Reagan\u2019 must be distinguished from\nany subjective ideas speakers associate with the name (e.g. feelings\nof anger, fondness, etc.) and from Reagan himself. And the sense of\nthe name \u201cpicks out\u201d Reagan as the thing in the world the\nname stands for. It may help to think of the sense as some descriptive\ncondition satisfied uniquely by Reagan (and not to think any more\nabout what is meant by a descriptive condition). Complex linguistic\nexpressions are also associated with senses. And Frege held that the\nsense of a complex expression is a function of the senses of its\nsimple parts and how they are put together. Frege called propositions\nthoughts (Gedanken), and held that the thought/proposition expressed\nby a sentence is itself a sense. And, like the senses of other complex\nlinguistic expressions, the proposition/thought expressed by a\nsentence is a function of the senses of the words in the sentence and\nhow they are put together. Now Frege at least sometimes appears to\nhold the stronger view that the sense of a sentence\n(proposition/thought) has as constituents the senses of the words in\nthe sentence. And as the following quotation shows, his account of how\nthese sense-constituents are held together in the proposition/thought\ndepends on different kinds of linguistic expressions having different\nkinds of senses:\n\nFor not all parts of a thought can be complete; at least one must be\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019, or predicative; otherwise they would not\nhold together. For example, the sense of the phrase \u2018the number\n2\u2019 does not hold together with that of the expression \u2018the\nconcept prime number \u2018 without a link. We apply such a link in\nthe sentence \u2018the number 2 falls under the concept prime\nnumber\u2019; it is contained in the words \u2018falls under\u2019,\nwhich need to be completed in two ways\u2014by a subject and an\naccusative; and only because their sense is thus\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019 are they capable of serving as a link.\n(Frege [1892] p. 54)\n\n\nRemarks like this suggest that Frege\u2019s view was that\npropositions are complex entities whose parts are other senses. The\nproposition is held together in virtue of the fact that at least one\nof the senses is unsaturated (Frege sometimes also says predicative,\nor in need of supplementation). Other senses \u201csaturate\u201d or\ncomplete the unsaturated senses and in so doing are bound to them to\nform the proposition/thought. Thus, on this way of interpreting Frege,\nthe mechanism for binding together the constituents of a structured\nproposition is built right into some of the constituents, (recall that\nthis was true of the view of Zalta [1988] as well).\n",
