    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Turn to Philosophy: The Vienna Circle, Popper, and Wittgenstein || Return to Vienna: University Life, Alpbach, and Popper (1947\u20131948)\n3.1 Return to Vienna: University Life, Alpbach, and Popper (1947\u20131948)\n\nFeyerabend therefore returned, still on crutches, to his\nparents\u201c apartment house in Vienna\u2019s 15th district.\nAlthough he planned to study physics, maths and astronomy, he chose\ninstead to read history and sociology at the University of\nVienna\u2019s Institut f\u00fcr Osterreichische\nGeschichtsforschung, thinking that history, unlike physics, is\nconcerned with real life. But he became dissatisfied with history, and\nreturned to theoretical physics. Together with a group of science\nstudents, who all regarded themselves as far superior to students of\nother subjects, Feyerabend invaded philosophy lectures and seminars.\nAlthough this was not his first contact with philosophy, it seems to\nhave been the period which cemented his interest. He recalls that in\nall interventions he took the radical positivist line that science is\nthe basis of knowledge; that it is empirical; and that nonempirical\nenterprises are either logic or nonsense (p. 68). These views would\nhave been familiar from the climate of Logical Positivism which found\nits main root in the Vienna Circle, a group of scientifically-minded\nphilosophers who, in the nineteen-twenties and \u201dthirties sought\nto deploy the newly-revitalised formal logic of Gottlob Frege and\nRussell and Whitehead\u2019s Principia Mathematica to\nrepresent the structure of human knowledge. As we shall see,\nFeyerabend\u2019s youthful positivist scientism makes quite a\ncontrast with his later conclusions. \n\nIn August 1948, at the first meeting of the international summer\nseminar of the Austrian College Society in Alpbach which he attended,\nFeyerabend met the philosopher of science Karl Popper, who had already\nmade a name for himself as the Vienna Circle\u2019s \u201cofficial\nopposition\u201d. (The Austrian College Society had been founded in\n1945 by Austrian resistance fighters, \u201cto provide a forum for\nthe exchange of scholars and ideas and so to prepare the political\nunification of Europe\u201d (Science in a Free Society, p.\n109)). In his 1934 book Logik der Forschung Popper had\nelaborated the straightforward and appealing falsificationist view\nthat great science could be characterised as a process in which\nthinkers put forward bold conjectures and then do their best to\nimprove them by trying to refute them. Instead of trying to develop an\ninductive logic, Popper argued for the (deductivist) view that\nscientific method could be characterised in terms of logically valid\ndeductive inferences.\n\nPopper\u2019s own autobiography, unfortunately, tells us nothing\nabout their meeting or their relationship, despite the fact that he\nwas to be the largest single influence (first positive, then negative)\non Feyerabend\u2019s work. For those hoping that Feyerabend might use\nthe occasion of his autobiography to settle accounts with his\nerstwhile philosophical conscience, it is disappointing that the book\ntells us so little about his acquaintance with Popper. Elsewhere\nFeyerabend tells us that he\n\nadmired [Popper\u2019s] freedom of manners, his cheek, his\ndisrespectful attitude towards the German philosophers who gave the\nproceedings weight in more senses than one, his sense of\nhumour\u2026 [and] his ability to restate ponderous problems in\nsimple and journalistic language. Here was a free mind, joyfully\nputting forth his ideas, unconcerned about the reaction of the\n\u201cprofessionals\u201d. (SFS, p. 115).\n\n\nBut Popper\u2019s ideas themselves, Feyerabend alleges, were not new\nto him, deductivism having been defended as early as 1925 by Viktor\nKraft, and falsificationism being \u201ctaken for granted\u201d at\nAlpbach. Popper\u2019s ideas, he remarks, were also similar to those\nof another Viennese philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein (!), although\n\u201cmore abstract and anaemic\u201d (SFS, p. 116). Over\nthe following years, Feyerabend attended the Alpbach symposium about\nfifteen times, first as a student, then as a lecturer and seminar\nchair. He was offered, and accepted, the post of \u201cscientific\nsecretary\u201d to the society, and this he calls \u201cthe most\ndecisive step of my life\u201d (p. 70). In fact, it is this decision\nwhich answers his self-addressed questions about the origin of his\ncareer, his reputation, and his situation at the time of writing his\nautobiography, since he traces his situation back to it. \n\nAt Alpbach he was also approached by communists, including the Marxist\nintellectual Walter Hollitscher, who became his teacher and friend.\nFeyerabend resisted Hollitscher\u2019s political arguments on the\nbasis of his own \u201cyouthful elitism\u201d and \u201can almost\ninstinctive aversion to group thinking\u201d (p. 73). But although\nFeyerabend later described himself as having been \u201ca raving\npositivist\u201d at the time, it was Hollitscher, he says, who\npersuaded him of the cogency of realism about the \u201cexternal\nworld\u201d (Popper\u2019s important arguments for realism came\nsomewhat later). The considerations Hollitscher deployed were, first,\nthat scientific research was conducted on the assumption of realism,\nand could not be otherwise conducted, and, second, that realism is\nfruitful and productive of scientific progress, whereas positivism was\nsimply a commentary on scientific results, barren in itself.\n\nHollitscher never presented an argument that would lead, step by step,\nfrom positivism to realism and he would have regarded the attempt to\nproduce such an argument as philosophical folly. He rather developed\nthe realist position itself, illustrated it by examples from science\nand commonsense, showed how closely it was connected with scientific\nresearch and everyday action and so revealed its strength.\n(SFS, p. 113).\n\n\nFeyerabend eventually developed these thoughts in a fascinating series\nof papers beginning in 1957, arguing that science needs realism in\norder to progress, and that positivism would stultify such progress.\nThe argument was entirely in line with Popper\u2019s approach, as\nwell as with his conclusions. \n",
