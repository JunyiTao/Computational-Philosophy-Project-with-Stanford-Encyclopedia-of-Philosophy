Brief Biography\n\n\nHans (born Johannes) Vaihinger\u2019s early life was in many ways\nthat of a typical intellectual in nineteenth-century Germany. Born on\n25 September 1852 near T\u00fcbingen, the son of the pastor Johann\nGeorg Vaihinger, Hans was intended for the clergy. He began his\nstudies in theology at the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1870, but,\nnever especially devout, he soon turned his attentions to other\nsubjects, primarily philosophy and natural science. Throughout the\nnext four years, Vaihinger\u2019s course of study emphasized the\nclassics of German philosophy\u2014Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel,\nand Schleiermacher\u2014but he also devoted himself intensely\nto the independent study of Schopenhauer and Darwin. In 1874,\nVaihinger completed his dissertation under the supervision of the\nlogician Christoph von Sigwart with a prize-winning essay,\nentitled Recent Theories of Consciousness according to their\nMetaphysical Foundation and their Significance for\nPsychology.\n\n\nLater in the same year, he reported to Leipzig for compulsory military\nservice, but was excused due to his poor eyesight. Free of his\nmilitary duties, Vaihinger had the opportunity to attend lectures at\nthe University from, among others, the founder of empirical psychology\nWilhelm Wundt. It was during this time that Vaihinger first\nencountered the work of a figure who, next to Kant, would be his most\nimportant and lasting philosophical influence, the Neo-Kantian\nFriedrich Lange. Vaihinger describes the impact\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism made on him as follows:\n\u201cNow at last I had found the man whom I had sought in vain\nduring those four years [at T\u00fcbingen]. I found a master, a guide,\nan ideal teacher\u2026 . All that I had striven for and aimed at\nstood before my eyes as a finished masterpiece. From this time onwards\nI called myself a disciple of F.A. Lange\u201d (PAO,\nxxi\u2013xxii).\n\n\nAfter a brief tenure in Leipzig, Vaihinger moved to Berlin, where he\ncontinued his studies with Hermann von Helmholtz and the Neo-Kantian\nEduard Zeller. In 1876, Vaihinger published his first work, an\nexposition and defense of Lange\u2019s brand of Neo-Kantianism,\nentitled Hartmann, D\u00fchring, and Lange: Towards a\nHistory of German Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century. It was\nhere that the views which would form the basis of the PAO\nfirst began to take shape. In autumn of the same year, Vaihinger again\nrelocated\u2014this time to the University of Strassburg\u2014and by\nearly 1877 he had habilitated with a work entitled Logical Studies\non Fictions. Part I: The Theory of Scientific Fictions. Though the\nPAO would not be published for more than 30 years, the\nLogical Studies is already, according to Vaihinger,\n\u201cexactly the same\u201d as Part I of the former work\n(PAO xxiii\u2013xxiv).\n\n\nThe extremely long gestation period of the PAO seems to\nhave been the product of a variety of factors. First and foremost,\nmonetary considerations compelled Vaihinger to find permanent academic\nemployment. To further his candidacy, Vaihinger decided to bring out a\nCommentary on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason in honor of\nthe centenary of the first Critique\u2019s publication. The\nfirst volume of the Commentary was released in 1881, and\nhelped Vaihinger secure a permanent position at the University of\nHalle. The second volume followed in 1892. A sense of the scholarly\ndepth of Vaihinger\u2019s work is given by the fact that the\ntwo-volume Commentary, which deals only with the\nKrV\u2019s Prefaces, Introductions, and Transcendental\nAesthetic, reaches nearly 1,100 pages. Moreover, a number of personal\nand professional engagements occupied Vaihinger in the last decade of\nthe century. In 1889 he married Elisabeth Schweigger, the daughter of\na Berlin bookseller. In 1892 they had a son, Richard, and in 1895 a\ndaughter, Erna. In 1896, he founded the journal Kant-Studien,\nand in 1901 the Kant Gesellschaft.\n\n\nFinally, in 1911, Vaihinger published the first edition of\nPAO. The work made him something like a philosophical\ncelebrity virtually overnight. It proved so popular that it had gone\nthrough no fewer than 10 editions by the time of his death in 1933,\nattracting the attention of luminaries from a wide variety of academic\nfields (including Einstein, Ostwald, and Freud). Halle even became\ninformally known as the \u201cVaihinger-Stadt\u201d (Vaihinger\ncity). The PAO\u2019s success enabled Vaihinger to found,\nin 1918, yet another journal, Annalen der Philosophie und\nphilosophischen Kritik, which dealt specifically with the themes\nbroached in the\nPAO, and included contributions from figures such as the\nmathematician Moritz Pasch, the embryologist Wilhelm Roux, and the\npositivist philosophers Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach. In 1930,\nCarnap and Reichenbach took over editorship of the Annalen and\nrenamed it Erkenntnis. \n\n\nThough this period of Vaihinger\u2019s life was marked by tremendous\nprofessional success, it was also a period of personal struggle. In\n1906, suffering badly from cataracts, Vaihinger was forced to\ndiscontinue his lecturing. Eventually, he was completely blinded. In\n1913, there occurred a rather bizarre incident: an anti-Semitic\npublication, the Semi-K\u00fcrschner, \u201caccused\u201d\nVaihinger of being a Jew. With anti-Semitism already on the rise in\nGermany, Vaihinger felt compelled to defend his reputation in court,\nand sued the publication for defamation. Though the\nSemi-K\u00fcrschner ultimately removed his name, the incident\nperhaps explains in part why his reputation would continue to suffer\nunder the Nazis. Additionally, Vaihinger had invested significant\nportions of his assets in Russia; the October Revolution, together with\nthe economic crisis after the First World War left him in dire\nfinancial straits, and he was forced to sell the bookstore he had\ninherited from Elisabeth\u2019s parents. Struggle turned to tragedy\nwhen, in 1918, Vaihinger\u2019s daughter Erna committed suicide. His\nson Richard also began suffering from neuropathy brought on by the war,\nand by 1929 he was completely incapacitated.\n\n\nVaihinger died in 1933, on the eve of the rise of the Third Reich. A\nlong-time liberal and pacifist, Vaihinger and his work were treated\nwith hostile silence throughout the Nazi period. A final, posthumous\ntragedy would thus befall him during these years: once among\nGermany\u2019s most celebrated and influential philosophers,\nVaihinger became a virtual nobody, and his works were quickly\nforgotten. Though contemporary philosophical literature reveals a\nrenewed interest in his ideas, it is fair to say that his reputation\nhas never fully recovered. For a more detailed treatment of\nVaihinger\u2019s biography, see (Simon 2014). Vaihinger himself\ndiscusses his intellectual development at length in his\nautobiographical (1921b) (also included as the introduction to\nC.K. Ogden\u2019s 1925 English translation of\nPAO).\n2. Early Views and Intellectual Context\n\n\nWith the hegemony of absolute idealism broken, Germany was awash with\ncompeting philosophical systems by the time Vaihinger habilitated in\n1877. Three important movements are worth emphasizing (for detailed\nstudies of the late nineteenth-century context, see Beiser [2013;\n2014; 2015; 2017]). First, under the influence of Lange and others,\nNeo-Kantianism had become a major force on the intellectual\nscene. Second, due partly to Schopenhauer\u2019s rising star, and\npartly to the continued influence of Hegel and Schelling, grand\nmetaphysical theorizing after the idealist model was experiencing a\nresurgence in the work of Adolf Trendelenburg, Hermann Lotze, and\nEduard von Hartmann. Finally, traditional materialism and empiricism,\nthough very much on the defensive, had nevertheless gained back\nconsiderable ground since their nadir in early decades of the\ncentury.\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s first intervention in these foundational debates\ncame in the form of his short tract Hartmann, D\u00fchring, and\nLange. Its title notwithstanding, the book is less a work of\nhistorical exegesis, and more a polemical defense of Lange\u2019s\nKantian standpoint against the dual assault of na\u00efve realism\n(represented by the positivism of Eugen D\u00fchring) and unchecked\nmetaphysical speculation (exemplified by Hartmann\u2019s\nNeo-Schopenhauerian view, according to which fundamental reality is a\nmonistic vital substance). Vaihinger\u2019s chief charge against\nHartmann and D\u00fchring is that they are dogmatists, that\nthey systematically overstep the critical strictures Kant had placed\non cognition, claiming knowledge of things in themselves (1876, 10,\n17). Both commit \u201cthe original sin of post-Kantian\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014Hegel\u2019s\n\u201cfantastic petitio principii\u201d of \u201cthe unity\nof thought and being\u201d (1876, 67). Lange\u2019s Neo-Kantianism,\nby contrast, represents something like the best of both worlds, and so\npromises a middle path in a seemingly intractable dispute. With\nD\u00fchring, Lange emphasizes the importance of grounding philosophy\nin the results of the empirical sciences. But with Hartmann, he avoids\nna\u00efvely eliding the empirical objects studied by the sciences\nwith things in themselves.\n\n\nIt is not, however, only Lange\u2019s in-principle restriction of\nknowledge to appearances that Vaihinger wishes to champion. More\nimportantly, he holds that Lange has demonstrated that the empirical\nsciences themselves conclusively support the transcendental\nidealist\u2019s position. In Chapter IV, Part 3 of the second volume\nof his magnum opus The History of Materialism and Critique of its\nContemporary Significance, Lange draws on the work of Johannes\nM\u00fcller and Helmholtz to argue that \u201cthe physiology of the\nsense organs is the developed, or corrected Kantianism, and\nKant\u2019s system can, as it were, be viewed as a program for the\nmore recent discoveries in this field\u201d (1873\u201375, 2:409).\nThe basic idea was that such research had shown that our perceptual\napparatus plays an active role in structuring our experience, and that\nthe output of such a process does not qualitatively resemble the\ninitial external stimulus, for which it is a mere \u201csign.\u201d\nSince what we perceive is always the product of such unconscious\nphysiological processes, it supposedly follows that we have no\nknowledge of the objects that ultimately cause our perceptions (for\nmore on these sorts of arguments, see [Hatfield 1990, 165\u201371,\n195\u2013208, and esp. 208\u2013218; Beiser 2014, 199\u2013205,\n381\u201386], and the entries on Hermann von Helmholtz, and Friedrich\nLange). Thus, if D\u00fchring rejects transcendental idealism, he\nsimply has not consistently followed his own prescription that\nphilosophy should base itself on the empirical sciences. And if\nHartmann claims to know the nature of things in themselves, he can do\nso only by flagrantly ignoring the results of those sciences.\n\n\nThough perhaps rhetorically effective, this argument leads to a basic\ntension in Vaihinger\u2019s early view. Vaihinger sums up\nLange\u2019s conclusion as follows: \u201cthe result of the\nphysiology of the senses is that we do not \u2026 perceive external\nobjects, but rather ourselves first produce the appearance of such\nthings, specifically as a consequence of the affection by\ntranscendent objects\u201d (1876, 56). These appearances are the\nresult of our \u201cphysiological organization\u201d operating on\nsensory stimuli. But he goes on to concede that this\n\u201c\u2018organization\u2019 signifies only the unknown \u2026\nY whose collaboration with the \u2018thing in itself\u2019,\nX, produces the world of inner and outer experience\u201d (1876,\n57), that \u201ceven our own body \u2026 is only a product of our\noptical apparatus\u201d (1876, 57), and that \u201cnot merely the\nexternal\nworld, but also the organs with which we grasp it are\nmere images of what truly exists, which itself remains unknown\nto us\u201d (1876, 58).\n\n\nSo, according to the Lange-Vaihinger view, the objects of our\nexperience are the joint product of affection by things in themselves\nand the operations of our physiological organization. This is supposed\nto have the conclusion that things in themselves are entirely\nunknowable, a fortiori not knowable through the methods of the\nempirical sciences. The problem becomes clear, then, when we ask what\nsort of thing \u2018physiological organization\u2019 is supposed to\nsignify. If it refers to a thing in itself (the cognitive apparatus in\nitself), then the empirical sciences could establish nothing about it.\nIn this case, the Langean argument is entirely impotent. If it refers\nto an appearance, then there is evidently a circle in the argument: the\nexistence of appearances is supposed to be explained by the causal\ncollaboration of things in themselves and the perceptual apparatus, but\nthe perceptual apparatus is itself an appearance. Finally, if the\nphysiological organization is both an appearance and a thing in itself,\nthen the empirical sciences can in fact yield knowledge of at\nleast some things in themselves. This, of course, is precisely what the\nargument is meant to forestall.\n\n\nVaihinger does little to assuage these problems in (1876). Sometimes\nhe suggests that they are rooted in the fact that the very notion of a\nthing in itself involves a contradiction, albeit one which is\n\u201cgrounded in the contradictory constitution of our cognitive\nfaculty itself\u201d (1876, 34). In other words, Vaihinger seeks to\nview the issue of things in themselves along the lines of a Kantian\nantinomy\u2014a conflict which arises necessarily from the nature of\nour reason, but which can at least be recognized as such. This,\nhowever, is of little help. For one, it is questionable whether the\nbasic epistemological standpoint of (1876) can even be coherently\nstated without commitment to things in themselves. For another, a\ncrucial feature of Kant\u2019s antinomies is that they are\nresolved by his transcendental idealism, thus lending that\ndoctrine an indirect proof (KrV, A 506/B 534). If the\ncritical philosophy itself were to generate insoluble contradictions,\nthat would be reason to reject, not accept, it. Vaihinger would\ncontinue to struggle with these issues in the PAO, which\nstill aims to advance the broadly Langean project of naturalizing\nKantianism. As we shall see in \u00a76, however, Vaihinger\u2019s\nconception of Kantianism undergoes a considerable shift, now taking\nthe form of what he calls \u201cidealistic positivism\u201d,\n\u201cpositivist idealism\u201d, or even (in what is evidently the\nfirst use of the phrase) \u201clogical positivism.\u201d For more on\nVaihinger\u2019s debt to Lange, see (Ceynowa 1993, 133\u201372;\nHeidelberger 2014).\n3. Interpretation of Kant\n\n\nBefore returning to Vaihinger\u2019s own positive philosophy, it is\nworth examining the task that occupied him intensely between the\npublication of (1876) and the PAO: the interpretation of\nKant. The rise of Neo-Kantianism in the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury brought with it a renewed interest in the historical study of\nthe critical philosophy. The majority of the works written during this\nperiod tended to approach Kant\u2019s texts polemically, either with\nthe aim of defending and \u201cupdating\u201d them, or with the\nintention of refuting them. In terms of its scholarly sobriety, depth\nof textual analysis, and sensitivity to Kant\u2019s immediate\nintellectual context, Vaihinger\u2019s Commentary was\nunique. He notes that his approach will be that of those who analyze\nancient texts \u201cwith philological sobriety and strict rigor\n\u2026 in order to determine their genuine meaning from\nan historical standpoint\u201d (1881\u201392, 1:iii). The\nextent to which Vaihinger resists allowing his own philosophical\ncommitments to influence his interpretation is indeed impressive. In\nfact, the very idea that understanding Kant\u2019s texts might\nrequire a distinctively historical kind of approach seems to have been\nsomething of a novelty and is among Vaihinger\u2019s lasting\ncontributions to Kant scholarship.\n\n\nThere are other important, and more substantive, respects in which the\nCommentary was at the vanguard of Kant scholarship. The\ndominant trend in the interpretation of Kant\u2019s theoretical\nphilosophy throughout most of the nineteenth century had been the\nphysio-psychological reading advanced by such figures as Schopenhauer,\nJakob Fries, Friedrich Beneke, J\u00fcrgen Bona Meyer, Helmholtz, and\nof course Lange (Beiser 2018, 64\u201372, 81\u201384; 2014,\n209\u201311, 460\u201363). According to this tradition, Kant\u2019s\nmain goal in the Critique was the discovery of the causal\nmechanisms underlying perception. Kant\u2019s conception of the\na priori was accordingly understood as referring to innate or\ningrained properties of the psychological subject that played an active\nrole in the construction of perception and acquisition of empirical\nknowledge. The first to break decisively with this tradition was\nprobably Hermann Cohen. Cohen (1871) highlighted the\nepistemological side of Kant\u2019s project\u2014his\ninterest in justifying various claims to knowledge.\nAccordingly, Cohen interpreted the a priori as referring to\nthe logical, rather than psychological, conditions of knowledge (1871,\n208). In this respect, Cohen\u2019s influence on the\nCommentary was decisive. Vaihinger insists at the outset that\nKant\u2019s \u201cphilosophy is, in the first instance,\nepistemology [Erkenntnistheorie]\u201d\n(1881\u201392, 1:8).\n\n\nVaihinger certainly does not, however, accept Cohen\u2019s\ninterpretation tout court. Though Cohen too had emphasized\nthe need for historical sensitivity in interpreting Kant, his aims\nwere ultimately still polemical: he believed more careful attention to\nKant\u2019s texts could exonerate his system from some of the\nperennial charges of inconsistency. For example, Kant\u2019s doctrine\nthat things in themselves exist independently of us and causally\naffect our minds to produce our representations had long been thought\nto violate his doctrine that the categories have validity only for\nobjects of possible experience. Another charge, very much alive at the\ntime, was that Kant\u2019s key arguments for the\nnon-spatiotemporality of things in themselves failed on the grounds\nthat they showed, at best, only the subjectivity of space and time,\nnot their mere subjectivity. According to this criticism,\nKant overlooked the possibility that space and time might\nbe both subjective forms of intuition and objective\nproperties of things in themselves (the classic statement of this\ncriticism is [Trendelenburg 1867]). Cohen\u2019s response to both\ncharges was to argue that interpreters were wrong to read Kant\u2019s\ndoctrine of things in themselves as positing a class of entities\nontologically distinct from appearances. Instead, he maintained, the\nKantian thing in itself is a mere \u201climiting concept\u201d\n(Grenzbegriff), to whose actual existence Kant was never\ncommitted (1871, 252, 268).\n\n\nVaihinger, by contrast, does not hesitate to admit that the above\nobjections are genuine problems for Kant. Indeed, he believes they\npinpoint serious inconsistencies in Kant\u2019s position. For\nexample, against Cohen\u2019s deflationary treatment of the thing in\nitself, Vaihinger notes, \u201cKant speaks thousands of times of\naffecting things in themselves; the impossibility of the existence and\ncausal efficacy of things in themselves is, by contrast, merely a\nconsequence that Kant\u2019s readers must certainly\ndraw from his theory of the categories, but which Kant himself\nhints at only seldom, and even then only timidly\u201d (1881\u201392,\n2:47) (the actual target of this remark is Fichte, but the point\napplies to Cohen\u2019s reading too). Vaihinger\u2019s goal in the\nCommentary is not to exonerate Kant from such inconsistencies,\nbut to explain why he fell into them. In particular, Vaihinger argues\nthat careful attention to both Kant\u2019s pre-critical writings and\nhis unpublished notes reveals that the Critique is really a\n\u201cpatchwork\u201d of inconsistent views and arguments from\nvarious periods of Kant\u2019s intellectual development. It consists\nof \u201cgeological strata which differ in both time of composition\nand content\u201d (1902, 27). In the case of the Deduction, Vaihinger\neven claims to have been able to trace precisely each portion of the\ntext to a particular series of notes from the decade between the\nDissertation and the KrV (1902). In this respect,\nthen, Kant\u2019s great book resembles more the texts of Homer than\nthe work of a single author, writing at a single time, with a single\nset of views.\n\n\nMore specifically, Vaihinger believes the development of Kant\u2019s\nthought proceeds through six stages. From 1750\u20131760 Kant is a\ndogmatic rationalist after the Leibnizian-Wolffian model.  Then, under\nthe influence of Locke and Hume, he endorses empiricism from\n1760\u20131764. With the publication of Dreams of a Spirit\nSeer, he begins to adopt the standpoint of the critical\nphilosophy, but by the time of the 1770 Inaugural\nDissertation, the influence of Leibniz (particularly of the\nNouveaux Essais) reasserts itself. This reversion to\ndogmatism lasts until 1772 when he becomes a skeptic, again under the\ninfluence of Hume. Finally, he arrives at the mature critical\nstandpoint with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 (1881\u201392, 1:47\u201349). Unfortunately, on\nVaihinger\u2019s reading, doctrines from the first five periods\ncontinue to figure in Kant\u2019s arguments for and even the core\ntenets of the critical philosophy. It is this which explains the\nnumerous inconsistencies besetting Kant\u2019s system.\n\n\nA clear example of Vaihinger\u2019s basic approach is his treatment\nof Kant\u2019s famous argument for the subjectivity of space from\nincongruent counterparts. In the Prolegomena, Kant argues\nthus:\n\n\n\nThere are no inner differences here [in the case of incongruent\ncounterparts] that any understanding could merely think; and yet the\ndifferences are inner as far as the senses teach \u2026 one\nhand\u2019s glove cannot be used on the other\u2026 . These objects\nare surely not representations of things as they are in themselves,\nand\nas the pure understanding would cognize them, rather, they are\nsensory intuitions, i.e., appearances. (4:286)\n\n\nRoughly, Vaihinger reconstructs the argument as follows: (1) Some\ndifferences in the spatial properties of objects cannot be known\nthrough the pure understanding; (2) All differences between things in\nthemselves can be known through the pure understanding; (C) Space is\nnot a thing in itself. Premise (2), however, violates Kant\u2019s\nnoumenal ignorance doctrine, according to which things in themselves\ncannot be known through the understanding\u2019s categories. Thus,\nVaihinger concludes, \u201cthis assumption [that things in themselves\nare knowable through the pure understanding] is obviously anathema to\nKantian criticism, and an archaic reversion to dogmatism\u201d\n(1881\u201392, 2:528). More specifically, his claim is that the\npremise is residue from Kant\u2019s view in the 1770\nDissertation, according to which things in themselves\nare objects as the pure understanding knows them\n(1881\u201392, 2:354, 453, 522).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s reading of the KrV, and especially of the\nDeduction, has become known as the \u201cpatchwork thesis.\u201d The\npatchwork reading has been influential in Anglophone scholarship, due\nlargely to its adoption by Norman Kemp Smith (1918), but it remains\ncontroversial. Since the reading apparently requires us to assume that\nKant failed to understand that combining views he knew were\ninconsistent with one another would produce a view that is itself\ninconsistent, it may be objected that, \u201cif such a conclusion is\ntrue, we must say that Immanuel Kant was either abnormally stupid, or\nelse that he took his thinking in a frivolous spirit\u201d (Paton\n1930, 157). However, the thesis that the Deduction, regardless of its\nprecise method of composition, at least contains multiple inconsistent\nlines of argument, rather than a single unified argument, has found\nable defenders since Vaihinger (see e.g., Wolff 1963; Guyer 1987). For a\nrecent challenge to this revised patchwork reading see (Allison\n2015).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretive work during the 1880\u2019s and\n90\u2019s did not extend to the other major part of the KrV,\nthe Transcendental Dialectic. The PAO, however, includes a\nsupplementary appendix in which Vaihinger lays out a novel\ninterpretation of this chapter (PAO 201\u201335). The\nDialectic was the part of the KrV that clearly had the most\nsignificant impact on Vaihinger\u2019s own thought, and his\ninterpretation of it is radical and interesting. It will therefore be\nworth briefly examining before turning to the main argument of the\nPAO. \n\n\nIn the Dialectic, Kant claims that certain concepts (e.g., those of an\nimmaterial soul, freedom of the will, and God) have their root in pure\nreason. He argues that such concepts are mere \u201cIdeas\u201d\n(Ideen), in the sense that they are not constitutive\nprinciples of experience, and thus yield no \u201ccognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnis) of objects. Nevertheless, he suggests they are\n\u201cnot arbitrarily thought up\u201d (A 327/B 384), but have a\nnumber of important \u201cregulative\u201d uses. In his works on\nmoral philosophy, Kant goes on to argue that we can even have a\ncertain kind of \u201cpractical cognition\u201d of or\n\u201crational faith\u201d in the Ideas. A natural interpretation of\nKant\u2019s position regarding the Ideas holds that we lack\ntheoretical justification for believing that they refer to objects,\nand this lack of justification is such that we cannot claim knowledge\nof the existence or non-existence of such objects. Practical reason,\nhowever, may provide justification for the belief in (say) the\nexistence of God, even if not of a sort sufficient to yield knowledge\nof him. Vaihinger disputes this reading. Instead, he interprets the\nIdeas as self-conscious fictions, which are nevertheless licensed by\ntheir theoretical and practical utility. This utility justifies us in\n\u201cmaking use\u201d of such concepts\u2014looking, e.g., at\nnature as though it were the product of an intelligent\ndesigner\u2014but never in believing they refer to objects.\nThe interpretation relies crucially on two factors: first, a\nsuggestive passage in which Kant calls Ideas \u201cheuristic\nfictions\u201d (A 771/B 799), and contrasts them with hypotheses; and\nsecond, Kant\u2019s frequent use of \u2018als ob\u2019 and\nrelated locutions when describing the regulative employment of the\nIdeas. Both the distinction between fictions and hypotheses, and the\nidea of treating reality as if certain concepts appropriately\napplied to it are major themes that find extensive development in the\nPAO.\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretation of the Ideas as fictions is highly\ncontroversial, and was already subjected to withering criticism in his\nown day by Erich Adickes (1927). Adickes accuses Vaihinger of ignoring\ncountless passages that flatly contradict his fictionalist reading,\nand of misleadingly paraphrasing or eliding passages he does cite. In\none way, at least, this criticism is unfair. Vaihinger explicitly\nconcedes: \u201cin Kant we also find in the same contexts many\npassages which permit or even demand a contrary interpretation\u2026\n. Two tendencies are revealed, a critical and a dogmatic, a\nrevolutionary and a conservative\u201d (PAO\n212). Vaihinger\u2019s interpretation is not, unlike his work in\nthe Commentary, intended to be strictly historical; he is\nrather presenting one strand in Kant\u2019s thought that he finds\nespecially promising. Adickes nevertheless makes a compelling case\nthat even those passages on which Vaihinger does rely do not speak\ndecisively in favor of his interpretation. Most contemporary Kant\nscholars follow Adickes in rejecting the fictionalist interpretation\nof the Ideas, though it continues to find some supporters (see e.g.,\nShaper 1966; Korsgaard 1996, 162\u201376; and esp. Rauscher\n2015). \n4. The Epistemology of the PAO\n\n\nI turn now to Vaihinger\u2019s chief systematic work, the\nPAO. That this work represents his attempt to continue\nLange\u2019s project of naturalizing Kantian epistemology\n(Heidelberger 2014, 51\u201355) may appear surprising given\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretation of Kant. Confusion here may be\nforestalled by attending to something Vaihinger himself says about the\naim of the work:\n\n\n\nThere were two possible ways of working out the Neo-Kantianism of\nF.A. Lange. Either the Kantian standpoint could be developed, on the\nbasis of a closer and more accurate study of Kant\u2019s teaching, and\nthis is what Cohen has done, or one could bring Lange\u2019s\nNeo-Kantianism into relation with empiricism and positivism. This has\nbeen done in my philosophy of \u201cAs if,\u201d which also leads to\na more thorough study of Kant\u2019s \u201cAs if\u201d theory.\n(PAO xxii)\n\n\nSo Vaihinger distinguishes between the views maintained by the\nhistorical Kant, and Lange\u2019s brand of\nKantianism, which his own systematic work defends and\ndevelops.\n\n\nBut, the PAO also builds on Lange\u2019s position in\nnon-trivial ways. Vaihinger\u2019s autobiographical essay \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Philosophy of \u2018As If\u2019\u201d points to two\nfurther significant influences, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin.\nVaihinger\u2019s interest in Schopenhauer was sparked by the doctrine\nthat the intellect is \u201ca mere tool in the service of the\nwill\u201d (Schopenhauer 1958, 2:205). This view is based in part on\nSchopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics, according to which the ultimate\nnature of reality is nothing other than a suprapersonal, aimless,\nquasi-volitional striving or \u201cwill.\u201d Schopenhauer holds\nthat this \u201cwill\u201d expresses itself empirically in the\nstriving of organic beings to preserve their individual existence, and\nthe intellect has accordingly developed as a mere tool to aid more\ncomplex organisms in this task. Vaihinger believed that Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of natural selection had provided an empirical grounding for\nSchopenhauer\u2019s hypothesis (PAO xviii). This was crucial,\nsince Vaihinger\u2019s own Kantianism prevented him from endorsing\nSchopenhauer\u2019s speculative vitalist metaphysics (PAO\nxvii). At the same time, Vaihinger comes to view Kant\u2019s doctrine\nof the essential limits of our cognition through this\nSchopenhauerian-Darwinian lens: the \u201climitations of human\nknowledge,\u201d he says, are \u201ca necessary and natural result of\nthe fact that thought and knowledge are originally only a means, to\nattain the Life-purpose, so that their actual independence signifies a\nbreaking-away from their original purpose; indeed, by the fact of this\nbreaking-loose, thought is confronted by impossible problems\u201d\n(PAO xviii). Vaihinger will use this idea to motivate his own\nfictionalism, and to provide a radical reinterpretation of\nKantianism.\n\n\nThese various influences are drawn together in the introductory\nchapters of PAO. Here, Vaihinger presents a view of the\n\u201cpsyche\u201d as a purely natural faculty, akin to a bodily\norgan, and bound by the same laws as the rest of the organic world. All\npsychic activities, including \u201cscientific thought,\u201d are\n\u201cto be considered from the point of view of an organic\nfunction\u201d (PAO 1). Like bodily organs, the psyche is\ndesigned (or rather, selected) to perform a particular role within the\ntotal economy of the organism. Its purpose is \u201cto change and\nelaborate the perceptual material into those ideas, associations of\nideas, and conceptual constructs,\u201d which produce \u201ca world\n[in which] objective happenings can be calculated and our behavior\nsuccessfully carried out in relation to phenomena\u201d(PAO\n2). Its purpose is therefore not \u201cto be a copy [Abbild]\nof reality,\u201d but rather \u201can instrument for finding our\nway about more easily in this world\u201d (PAO 22,\ntranslation altered). Though broadly in the spirit of Schopenhauer and\nDarwin, this instrumentalist conception of the mind is, as Ceynowa has\nargued (1993, 35\u2013132), also more specifically indebted to the\nnineteenth century psychologist Adolf Horwicz.\n\n\nWhatever its exact provenance, Vaihinger\u2019s basic thought is that\nwhat is selected for in the evolution of our cognitive capacities is\nthe ability to aid us in carrying out activities that are useful for\nthe purposes of survival. Specifically, Vaihinger seems to reason that\nany course of action\u2014say, procuring food for\noneself\u2014involves at least some minimal degree of planning, and\nthat in turn requires some basic ability to predict what the future\nwill be like, and to know how it will be different if we choose to\n\u03c6 rather than to \u03c8. Thus, he suggests that the purpose of\nthought is \u201cto calculate those events that occur without our\nintervention and to realize our impulses appropriately\u201d\n(PAO 3). For the bare purposes of carrying out those actions\nnecessary for survival, Vaihinger is claiming, the intellect would not\nhave to be a reliable guide to the way the world really is. On the\ncontrary, fictions may have an indispensable role to play here.\n\n\nWhat are we to make of this sort of argument? One might suggest that\nthe fact that our cognitive apparatus is a product of natural selection\nsupports, rather than undermines, the idea that it is a reliable guide\nto the way the world is. For, being mistaken about how things stand in\none\u2019s environment is surely an impediment, not an aid, to\nsurvival. Vaihinger would likely respond that this only shows that we\nhave to get the right things about the world right. It does\nnot mean that our total image of the world is, or even could be, a\ncopy of reality, accurate in all its details.\nVaihinger\u2019s view is that the picture of the world that is easiest\nto work with will depart from reality in certain crucial respects.\n\n\nOne may now wonder, however, what is to be made of Vaihinger\u2019s\nnear exclusive emphasis in PAO on fictions in the natural\nsciences and mathematics. After all, the theorizing in fundamental\nphysics is a rather different matter than determining how to find a\nmeal, and even if such theories turn out to be useful down the line, it\nseems that life would (and does) manage just fine without them. Here,\nVaihinger relies on another Darwinian idea, which he calls the\n\u201cLaw of Preponderance of the Means over the End,\u201d according\nto which \u201cmeans which serve a purpose often undergo a more\ncomplete development than is necessary for the attainment of their\npurpose\u201d (PAO xxix). In the language of contemporary\nevolutionary biology, scientific thought is like a\n\u201cspandrel.\u201d At the same time, Vaihinger is keen to\nemphasize the connection between scientific theorizing and more humdrum\ncognitive processes. He adopts the broadly Kantian view that what is\ngiven to us in experience is merely a \u201cchaos of sensations\u201d\n(PAO 117), which needs to be ordered and refined by the\nlogical functions of thought, or categories. For example, the repeated\nco-occurrence of sensations of a branching shape and sensations of\ngreen leads the psyche to postulate a relation of substantial inherence\nbetween a thing or substance (the tree) and its\nattribute (green) (PAO 122\u201323). However, he\nargues in a manner evocative of Berkeley, the notion of a substance is\nincoherent since it implies the existence of a bare substrate with no\nproperties whatsoever (PAO 125\u201326). The fiction is\nnevertheless justified, he suggests, because it facilitates the\nrecognition of regularities in the occurrences of our sensations, and\nthe communication of these regularities to others (PAO 130).\nGiven that our most immediate relation to the world is thus mediated by\nthe categories (which also include the relations of part-whole,\ncause-effect, inter alia), it is natural to suppose that these\nfictions will resurface in our more sophisticated theories, e.g., in the\nform of the atom (a simple material substance). Vaihinger is not\nsuggesting that genuine knowledge that serves no particular practical\naim is impossible; but he is suggesting that our total theoretic image\nof the world is ultimately limited by those fictions that have been\npreserved as most adaptive for our basic practical aims (PAO\n130).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s emphasis on the deep connection between cognition\nand action have led many interpreters to liken his views to those of\nthe American pragmatists (e.g., Appiah 2017, 4; Koridze 2014; Fine\n1993, 4; and esp. Ceynowa 1993). Others have disputed this connection\n(Bouriau 2016). Vaihinger himself tells us that fictionalism and\npragmatism share important similarities, but nevertheless are\ndistinguished by the fact that pragmatism accepts, whereas\nfictionalism rejects, the principle that \u201can idea which is found\nto be useful in practice proves thereby that it is also true in\ntheory\u201d (PAO viii). So, if one defines a pragmatist\nnarrowly as someone who endorses this Jamesian definition of truth,\nVaihinger is no pragmatist; his core contention is that \u201cwe may\nnot argue from the utility of a psychical and logical construct that\nit is right\u201d (PAO 51). Nevertheless, given\nVaihinger\u2019s emphasis on the inseparability of practical and\ntheoretical thought, his view that the use of a concept can be\njustified on purely practical grounds, and so forth, it does not seem\nunfair to liken him to the pragmatist tradition in a wider sense. \n5. The Nature of Vaihinger\u2019s Fictionalism\n\n\nCentral to Vaihinger\u2019s project in the PAO is a\ndistinction between two sorts of fictions: (1) what he (somewhat\ninaptly) terms \u2018semi-fictions,\u2019 which are \u201cmethods\nand concepts based upon a simple deviation from reality\u201d\n(PAO 59); and (2) \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018genuine\nfictions\u2019 which are self-contradictory concepts\n(ibid.).  In other words, semi-fictions are statements or propositions\nthat happen not to correspond to the world; genuine fictions are those\nthat claim something impossible about the world.\n\n\nAn important example the first kind is what Vaihinger calls the\n\u201cabstractive\u201d or \u201cneglective\u201d fiction\n(PAO, 14\u201317, 140\u201341). Such fictions are roughly\nwhat we have in mind today when we speak of \u2018idealized\nmodels\u2019 (contemporary philosophers of science sometimes\ndistinguish further between \u201cAristotelian\u201d and\n\u201cGalilean\u201d methods of idealization. See the article on\nModels in Science. Vaihinger does not clearly distinguish these). A\nstandard example is the model of the planetary system given in\nclassical mechanics:\n\n\n\nIn physics we find such a fiction in the fact that masses of\nundeniable extension, e.g., the sun and the earth, in connection with\nthe derivation of certain basic concepts of mechanics and the\ncalculation of their reciprocal attraction are reduced to points or\nconcentrated into points (gravitational points) in order, by means of\nthis fiction, to facilitate the presentation of the more composite\nphenomena. Such a neglect of elements is especially resorted to where\na very small factor is assumed to be zero. (PAO \n16)\n\n\nThe idea is familiar. If what we are interested in is determining\nthe trajectory and velocity of the planets around the Sun, then it is\nuseful to ignore or iron-out a wide variety of features of the system,\ne.g., the size of the planets, the presence of friction, the\ngravitational pull that the planets and their moons exert on one\nanother. Here, then, we evidently have a clear-cut case in which\n\u201cpretending\u201d that certain things are true of the solar\nsystem can greatly aid our aim of prediction. As Vaihinger notes, we\nget the \u201cright\u201d results here because the properties of the\nsystem we are ignoring have only a negligible influence on the\nphenomena we are interested in studying. The solar system behaves\nnearly just as it would if the planets were\nmass points, etc. This suggests a counterfactual understanding of\nfictions: by reasoning from assumptions that are false\u2014sometimes\nradically false\u2014at the actual world, we may still arrive at\nconclusions that are true, or quite nearly true, at the actual world.\nIf those results are arrived at more efficiently by entertaining the\nfiction, then the fiction is justified.\n\n\nIf this is Vaihinger\u2019s view, however, it would appear to face a\nserious difficulty. For, his main interest is in the so-called\n\u201creal fictions,\u201d which, as noted above, are not merely\nfalse, but contradictory. Since everything follows from a\ncontradiction, any counterfactual whose antecedent is a real fiction\nwill be trivially true, and this is to say they cannot possibly do the\nwork Vaihinger envisions (Appiah 2017, 11; Cohen 1923, 485). One way to\nrespond, here, is to note that the logic with which Vaihinger operates\nis still essentially the version of Aristotelian logic found in Kant\nand throughout much of the nineteenth century. Such\npre-twentieth-century logics often implicitly reject the principle\nex contradictione quodlibet. See, e.g., the discussion of\nconditionals in the influential Port-Royal Logic (Arnauld and\nNicole 1996, 100).\n\n\nRelatedly, but from a more contemporary perspective, one might read\nVaihinger as anticipating some recent views on counterpossible\nreasoning (Pollard 2010). Consider the following counterfactual\nconditionals:\n\n(1)\nIf Fermat\u2019s last theorem were false, then\n      no argument for it would be sound.\n(2)\nIf Fermat\u2019s last theorem were false, then\n      Andrew Wiles would deserve eternal fame.\n(3)\nIf intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law\n      of Excluded Middle would fail.\n(4)\nIf intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law\n      of Excluded Middle would hold.\n\n\n\nIntuitively, (1) and (3) are true while (2) and (4) are false.\nMoreover, someone who rejects intuitionism might well wish to\nargue against intuitionism by relying on something like (3),\neven though what the antecedent states is, by her lights, impossible.\nThese facts have led some to suppose that (1) and (3) are not merely\ntrue, but non-trivially true (for more on these sorts of arguments, see\nthe entry for Impossible Worlds). Vaihinger\u2019s fictionalism might\nthus be read as adding a heap of substantive examples to the list of\nalleged non-trivial counterpossible conditionals.\n\n\nThis sort of reading seems supported by examples that Vaihinger\nhimself gives, and the theory of \u201cfictive judgments\u201d he\nbases on them. One of Vaihinger\u2019s favorite examples is:\n\n(5)\nIf the circle were a polygon, then it would be\n      subject to the laws of rectilinear figures. (PAO,\n      193)\n\n\n\nThough (5)\u2019s antecedent and consequent both state something\nimpossible, Vaihinger contends it forms the basis of\nArchimedes\u2019s proof of the area of a circle using the method of\nexhaustion (PAO 177). Here, then, is a case in which a proof\nno one would wish to call trivial allegedly proceeds from a\ncontradictory assumption. Generalizing, Vaihinger claims, \u201cin a\nhypothetical connection [sc. conditional proposition], not only real\nand possible but also unreal and impossible things can be introduced,\nbecause it is merely the connection between the two presuppositions\nand not their actual reality that is being expressed\u201d\n(PAO 193\u201394).\n\n\nAnthony Appiah rejects this kind of interpretation, on the grounds\nthat such counterpossibles are unintelligible (2017, 11\u201317; cf.\nWilholt 2014, 112). Instead, he suggests Vaihinger\u2019s talk of\nuseful contradictions is more fruitfully understood as referring to\nthe use of multiple mutually incompatible models. In particular, the\npoint is that we may find it useful to regard certain phenomena in one\nway for some purposes, but in another, incompatible way for other\npurposes. Even when it turns out to be useful to combine incompatible\nmodels for understanding one and the same phenomenon (or range of\nphenomena), Appiah suggests, Vaihinger need not be committed to a\nparaconsistent logic. Rather, drawing on (Cartwright 1999), he\nsuggests that using a model does not involve drawing out each of its\nlogical implications, but instead a kind of skill of \u201cknowing\nwhich lines of inference one should and which one should not\nfollow\u201d (2017, 13). Moreover, because our main aim in using\nmodels is not ultimately to obtain the truth about the physical world,\nbut to get around in it, there is no reason to avoid such\ninconsistency (2017, 14\u201317).\n\n\nAppiah\u2019s interpretation allows those who are wary of\nparaconsistent logics to salvage something philosophically promising\nfrom Vaihinger\u2019s talk of contradictions. It also perhaps has the\nadvantage of doing greater justice to the multifarious character of\nVaihinger\u2019s theory of fictions. For, while Vaihinger claims that\nthe fictive judgment has a \u201chypothetical element,\u201d he does\nnot simply reduce fictive judgments to conditionals (PAO\n194).  On the other hand, the interpretation stumbles against texts in\nwhich Vaihinger suggests that the contradictions of real fictions\nexist\nwithin theories or models, not between them. For example, the\nconcept of a (classical) atom is supposed to be a real fiction because\nit is absurd to suppose something which occupies space, but\nnevertheless has no extension. This is to say that the atomistic\nfiction is itself contradictory, not merely that it conflicts with\nother ways of modeling matter. Another way of putting the worry is to\nnote that the interpretation blurs the apparently sharp distinction\nbetween semi-fictions and real fictions: any model will be a real\nfiction as long as we use it together with another model incompatible\nwith it.\n\n\nFor yet another approach, which denies that Vaihinger has or needs a\ngeneral account of how contradictory fictions can be fruitful, see\n(Fine 1993, 9\u201311). On this reading, Vaihinger is interested only\nin surveying actual scientific practice, and revealing that, as a\nmatter of fact, it does make fruitful use of real fictions;\nthe question of how this is possible is beside the point. There is\nsomething to this characterization of Vaihinger\u2019s procedure,\nwhich trades more in examples than in general pronouncements. However,\nit will also be difficult for proponents of this reading to explain\npassages like these: \u201cThis purpose [of thought] can only be that\nof facilitating conceptual activity, of effecting a safe and rapid\nconnection of sensations. What we have to show, therefore, is\nhow fictional methods and constructs render this\npossible\u201d (PAO 52, emphasis added); \u201cthe\nphilosophy of as if shows that and why these false and\ncontradictory representations are still useful\u201d (1921a, 532,\nemphasis added). Here, Vaihinger seems to indicate that his purpose is\nnot just to enumerate instances of useful fictions, but to explain how\nand why they are useful.\n\n\nIn addition to Vaihinger\u2019s specific analysis of fictions, one\nmight wonder about his precise brand of fictionalism. Contemporary\nphilosophers distinguish between \u201chermeneutic\nfictionalism\u201d and \u201crevolutionary fictionalism\u201d (see\nthe entry on Fictionalism). Hermeneutic fictionalism holds that\ncertain domains of discourse are fictional, in the sense that\ntheir participants are not aiming at literal truth, but only seeming\nto do so. Some textual evidence speaks in favor of reading Vaihinger\nas a hermeneutic fictionalist. For example, he writes: \u201cthe\naxiom and the hypothesis \u2026 endeavor to be expressions of\nreality. The fiction, on the other hand, is not such an expression nor\ndoes it claim to be one\u201d (PAO 60). And\nVaihinger\u2019s theory of the fictive judgment maintains that many\njudgements of the syntactic form \u2018A is B\u2019 are\nproperly analyzed as, or merely elliptical for, \u2018A is to be\nregarded as if it were B\u2019\u2014\u201cthe\n\u2018is\u2019 is a very short abbreviation for an exceedingly\ncomplicated train of thought\u201d (PAO 195). On the other\nhand, in many places Vaihinger clearly indicates that he thinks we\noften treat what would be better regarded as fictional discourse as\naiming at truth. Many disputes, he suggests, can be resolved by\nreinterpreting such discourse fictionally. Thus, for example,\nproponents of classical atomism have been wrong to think that their\ntheory is true, but their opponents have also been wrong to believe\nthat the theory should therefore be given up (PAO 53). He\nmakes an analogous point about the dispute between substantivalists\nand relationalists over the nature of space (PAO\n170\u201371). So, Vaihinger appears to be a revolutionary\nfictionalist at least about some discourses in which he is\ninterested.\n6. The As-If Philosophy and Kantianism\n\n\nThe most obvious aim of the PAO is to establish the\ncentrality of fictions to our cognitive life. But there is also a\nbroader, and in some ways more ambitious, aim to the book\u2014to\nprovide the kind of \u201ccorrected Kantianism\u201d Lange had tried\nto establish in the History of Materialism. As we saw above,\nVaihinger views Kant\u2019s system as riddled with inconsistencies,\nwhich arise from the alleged fact that Kant retains certain elements\nof his pre-critical dogmatism even after adopting the critical\nstandpoint.  The As-If philosophy can be seen as an attempt to retain\nwhat Vaihinger takes to be Kant\u2019s core philosophical insights,\nwhile removing the inconsistencies that beset the surrounding system\nin which those insights were originally couched. \n\n\nAs was noted above, a major problem for Vaihinger\u2019s early view,\nas for many of the Neo-Kantians of his day, was the status of the thing\nin itself. Vaihinger now consistently rejects this notion, predictably\nlabelling it a fiction. Given that things in themselves are supposed to\nbe transcendent substances that causally\naffect us, this rejection follows immediately from his view\nthat the concepts of substance and cause are themselves fictions\n(PAO 55\u201356). True to form, however, Vaihinger still\nholds that the concept of things in themselves has some utility: as\nCohen had argued, it serves as a \u201climiting concept\u201d\n(PAO 55), ensuring that we restrict our inquiries to what is\nempirically given to us. As we have seen, Vaihinger puts an\ninstrumentalist spin on this Kantian idea; all knowledge is empirical\nin the sense that our guiding cognitive aim is the prediction and\ncontrol of empirical phenomena, not correspondence to objective reality\n(though, once again, it bears emphasizing that Vaihinger does not seem\nto be claiming that such correspondence is impossible, only that it is\nincidental to our main epistemic aim).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s rejection of the thing in itself is implicit in\nthe general label he gives to his own philosophical view,\n\u201cidealistic positivism.\u201d The \u2018positivism\u2019 here\nis in part an epistemological, and in part a metaphysical thesis. The\nepistemological thesis is that \u201cwhat is given consists only of\nsensations\u201d (PAO 124; cf. xxviii). The metaphysical\nthesis is that \u201cwhat we usually term reality consists of\nour sensational contents [Empfindungsinhalte]\u201d\n(PAO xxx, emphasis added); \u201cNothing exists\nexcept sensations\u201d (PAO 44, emphasis added; cf. 1921a,\n532\u201333). This extreme view (for which Vaihinger does not argue)\nhas the immediate conclusion that all knowledge is of appearances,\nsince nothing exists except appearances.\n\n\nIn addition to this radical kind of empiricism, the PAO\ncontinues to uphold the broadly Kantian view that cognition is\nnecessarily limited, or, as Vaihinger sometimes puts it, that\nthere is no \u201cidentity between thought and being.\u201d However,\nit is no longer limited in the sense of being cut off from some\ntranscendent realm of things in themselves, but in being essentially\nincomplete. The point is best appreciated by attending to another\ndistinction central to the PAO\u2014that between\nfictions and hypotheses. Hypotheses (not to be\nconfused with so-called \u201chypothetical judgments\u201d) are\njudgments that are \u201cproblematic\u201d in form, i.e., which have\nthe form \u2018it is possible that A is B\u2019\n(where the relevant sense of possibility is epistemic). Thus, if the\njudgment \u2018matter is composed of atoms\u2019 is a hypothesis,\nthe person making it is maintaining that it may be true, and holds out\nhope that it may be confirmed or falsified in the future. By contrast,\nand as we have seen already, the fictive judgment has the form\n\u2018A is to be regarded as if it were B\n(when in fact A is not B).\u2019 Since Vaihinger\nholds that such judgments can be licensed by their practical utility,\nand because it is our practical aims that ultimately guide and\nconstrain theoretical inquiry, Vaihinger infers that every theory will\nnecessarily involve some fictions; not even the best theory will\nconsist entirely of hypotheses, much less true hypotheses.\n\n\nThe distinction between hypotheses and fictions is important for\nunderstanding Vaihinger\u2019s revised brand of Kantianism in another\nway as well. In the Dialectic, Kant had argued that dogmatic\nmetaphysics necessarily leads reason into a series of conflicts, or\n\u201cantinomies,\u201d with itself. It can produce, that is,\nequally valid arguments putatively establishing both that freedom\nexists and that freedom does not exist, that matter is composed of\nsimples and that matter is not composed of simples, and so on. Kant\nclaims that these conflicts are \u201cnatural\u201d to reason, since\nreason has an innate drive to know the \u201cunconditioned.\u201d He\nargues, however, that these conflicts can be avoided if (and only if)\none recognizes the non-spatiotemporality of things in themselves.\nTranscendental idealism allows us to maintain that in some of the\nantinomial conflicts it is possible for both the thesis and antithesis\nto be false without contradiction, and that in others it is possible\nfor both to be true without contradiction. The critical philosophy\nthus has the distinct advantage of being able to explain how certain\napparently insoluble metaphysical debates arise, and of providing the\nonly possible resolution of those debates. Vaihinger similarly posits\na natural human tendency to confuse, not appearances and things in\nthemselves, but fictions and hypotheses. Many statements that are\nintroduced into our discourse as fictions end up being taken for\nhypotheses. And vice versa, many propositions that are originally\nintended as hypotheses are retained with mere fictional significance.\nVaihinger calls this the \u201claw of ideational shifts\u201d\n(Gesetz der Ideenverschiebung) (PAO 92\u201399).\nSeemingly intractable debates in the sciences can be resolved, he\nmaintains, by systematically recognizing this distinction. Thus, for\ninstance, certain arguments against atomism are cogent if intended to\nestablish that atomism is false (since it is contradictory);\nbut they are erroneous if intended to imply that atomism should be\nrejected. Likewise, arguments for atomism are sure to fail if they are\nmeant to establish the existence of atoms; but they are perfectly\nacceptable if they only aim to show that atomistic discourse is useful\nand indeed essential for scientific practice. For, the atomist\u2019s\ndiscourse is best understood as a conscious fiction. As Vaihinger\nsuggests, the confusion arises from ignoring the essential practical\ndimension of thought (PAO xviii).\n\n\nHow successful is Vaihinger in resolving the alleged tensions in\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy? On one level, straightforwardly\nrejecting things in themselves and endorsing an ontology only of\nsensations clearly avoids the supposed problem of attributing causal\nefficacy to transcendent objects. On another, however, it would appear\nthat Vaihinger cannot so easily reject things in themselves without\ncausing problems for his basic epistemological view. For one, an\nobvious question arises as to what it is that has\nthe sensational contents that serve as Vaihinger\u2019s ontological\nbasics. For another, we have seen that Vaihinger\u2019s arguments in\nthe Introduction hold that the mind or\n\u201cpsyche\u201d operates on sensory stimuli, and that it\nhas certain ends to which fictions are expedient means. If nothing\nexists except sensations, then it seems we must read Vaihinger\u2019s\ntalk of \u2018mind\u2019 loosely, perhaps as referring to some\nparticular kind of collection of or relation between sensations. But,\none is tempted to say, it is simply incoherent to suggest that\nsensations themselves are the bearers of sensations, that they have\naims, that they operate on and systematize other sensations, etc. At\nthe very least, \u201coperation\u201d would seem to be a causal\nnotion, so that Vaihinger\u2019s causal fictionalism threatens to\nundermine the arguments at the foundation of his system. Vaihinger\nsometimes attempts to respond to these sorts of worries. He suggests,\nfor example, \u201cFrom our point of view the sequence of sensations\nconstitutes ultimate reality, and two poles are mentally added,\nsubject and object\u201d (PAO 56); \u201cnothing exists\nexcept sensations which we analyze into two poles, subject and\nobject\u2009\u2026\u2009. In other words, the ego and the\n\u2018thing in itself\u2019 are fictions\u201d (PAO\n44). The question of course is who the we is here that is\ndoing the mental adding. Perhaps Vaihinger intends such talk\nto itself be fictional. But he cannot hold that without undermining\nthe very motivation for his fictionalism. Nor does Vaihinger ever make\nclear and precise exactly what \u201cpoles\u201d of sensations are\nsupposed to be.\n\n\nOne may also worry that, throughout the PAO, Vaihinger has\nreverted to a crudely psychologistic version of Kantianism that both\nhe and Cohen had earlier rejected. On this score, Vaihinger is more\neasily defended. Though his fictionalism draws on certain biological\nand psychological theories, his main concern is still epistemological:\n\u201cApart from the general warning not to confuse fictions with\nreality, we may also call attention to the fact that every fiction\nmust be able to justify itself, i.e., must justify itself by\nwhat it accomplishes for the progress of science\u201d (PAO\n79). There would arguably be a confusion if Vaihinger held that the\nfact that certain concepts (or dispositions to form them) are\npsychologically innate justifies us in believing that there\nexist objects exemplifying them. But that is precisely the view he\nwishes to reject. The appeal to the theory of natural selection is\nintended to suggest a pragmatic, rather than evidential,\njustification for the use of those concepts. In this sense,\nVaihinger sees himself as drawing on Kant\u2019s method of justifying\nthe concepts of God, freedom, and immortality on practical grounds,\nbut extending it beyond the domain of moral philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<h4>Works by Vaihinger</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1876, <em>Hartmann, D\u00fchring, und Lange: zur\nGeschichte der deutschen Philosophie im XIX.
