History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance\n\nAlmost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance\nand an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy. The\nselection made will concentrate on those philosophers in whom the\nbroadly analytic tradition has shown most interest. First we shall\nlook at the development of the concept in the ancient world,\nculminating in the work of Aristotle. His account dominated debate\nthrough the Middle Ages and until the early modern period. We shall\nconsider various rationalist and empiricist treatments of the concept.\nLocke\u2019s contribution will be considered in especial detail\nbecause so much contemporary discussion is inspired (as we shall see\nin\n section 3)\n by an Aristotle-Locke nexus.\n",
