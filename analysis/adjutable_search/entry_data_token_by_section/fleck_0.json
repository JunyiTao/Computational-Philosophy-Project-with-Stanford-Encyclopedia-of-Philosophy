    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLudwik Fleck was born on July 11, 1896, in Lvov (now Lviv), at that\ntime under the rule of Austria-Hungary, to a family of Jewish\ncraftsman. His medical studies at the John Casimir University were\ninterrupted by military service. He graduated in 1922, when Lvov\nbelonged to the reborn Poland. At the end of his studies he was an\nassistant of the famous typhus specialist Rudolf Weigl. In 1923 Fleck\nfounded a private laboratory of medical analysis and was in charge of\nthe Lvov Sick Fund and the bacteriological-chemical laboratories of\nthe General Public Hospital.\n\nAlthough he was only loosely related with any academic environment at\nthat time, Fleck conducted medical research, the results of which he\npublished in about 40 papers, mostly in Polish and in German. In 1927\nhe published in Polish his first work in the philosophy of medicine:\n\u201cSome Specific Features of the Medical Way of Thinking\u201d.\nTwo years later he published in German a paper \u201cOn the Crisis of\n\u2018Reality\u2019\u201d(1929) inspired mostly by the quantum\nrevolution in physics. Both articles are of a provisional character,\nbut the first one already includes the terms \u201cthought\nstyle\u201d and \u201cincommensurability\u201d.\n\nIn September 1933 Fleck sent the manuscript of his book Die\nAnalyse einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache to Moritz Schlick. In\nMarch 1934, Schlick replied and expressed his willingness to recommend\nit for publication under the condition that a specialist on the\nhistory of medicine would also review it positively. In 1935, Benno\nSchwabe finally published the book Entstehung und Entwicklung\neiner wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einf\u00fchrung in die Lehre vom\nDenkstil und Denkkollektiv (The Genesis and Development of a\nScientific Fact: An Introduction to the Theory of Thought Style and\nThought Collective). It was accompanied by a Polish summary of the\nmain theses of the book (1934) and two important papers:\n\u201cScientific Observation and Perception in General\u201d (1935b)\nand \u201cThe Problem of Epistemology\u201d (1936). In Poland the\nbook was criticized by Izydora D\u0105mbska and Fleck answered her\ncritique in (1938). Fleck\u2019s next Polish philosophical article\n(1939a) referred, among others, to a book by a psychiatrist and\nhistorian of medicine, Tadeusz Bilikiewicz. Bilikiewicz replied with a\nmoderate critique of Fleck\u2019s epistemology. Fleck in turn wrote a\npaper \u201cRejoinder to the Comments of Tadeusz Bilikiewicz\u201d\n(1939b) in which he stated strong anti-realistic theses. \n\nWhen Lvov was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1939,\nFleck had been appointed the head of the municipal laboratory of\nhygiene and bacteriology. On June 30, 1941, Lvov was captured by\nGermans. Anti-Jewish pogroms began, and Germans also started to murder\nuniversity professors of Polish origin. Fleck and his wife survived,\nprobably because Rudolf Weigl included him on the list of employees of\nthe Lvov Institute of Research on Typhus and Viruses. In August 1941,\nGermans resettled Fleck to the Lvov ghetto, where he developed and\nproduced an anti-typhus vaccine from the urine of sick people. He was\nthen relocated with his family to the area of the pharmaceutical\ncompany Laokoon and tasked with producing an anti-typhus vaccine for\nGerman soldiers. Finally he and his wife and son were deported to the\nconcentration camp in Auschwitz. At first he was forced to do physical\nlabor, but later he was transferred to the camp\u2019s hospital with\nthe assignment to conduct bacteriological tests on prisoners. In\nDecember 1943 Fleck was transferred to the concentration camp in\nBuchenwald. There a group of prisoners\u2014scientists and medical\ndoctors of various nationalities\u2014led by a scientifically\nilliterate German doctor produced an anti-typhus vaccine.\n\nThe Buchenwald concentration camp was liberated in April 1945. One\nmonth later Fleck found his wife and son in Lvov, which once again\nbelonged to the Soviet Union. They hastily left for Poland, whose\nterritory\u2014by the decision of the Allies\u2014was moved 200 km\nto the west. The Communist government in Poland was establishing Maria\nCurie-Sk\u0142odowska University in Lublin, and since Germans murdered\nmany Polish scholars, there was a scarcity of employable professors.\nIn October 1945 Fleck became the head of the Institute of Medical\nMicrobiology at that university, and he became a full professor in\n1950. In 1948 he testified in the Nuremberg Trials of German doctors,\nwho conducted criminal experiments on prisoners of concentration\ncamps.\n\nHe published two more epistemological papers in Polish:\n\u201cProblems of the Science of Science\u201d (1946) and \u201cTo\nLook, To See, To Know\u201d (1947). Those texts do not add anything\nimportant to the theory which he formulated in the 1930s. He was\nabsorbed by research on a defence mechanism which he discovered in\n1942 and named \u201cleucergy\u201d. It was the chief subject of\nmost of his roughly 80 medical papers which he published in those\nyears, mostly in Polish, but also in English and French. In 1952 he\nbecame the director of the bacteriology and immunology laboratory of\nthe Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. Fleck was honored with\nmany high national distinctions; he had a company car at his disposal,\nand attended international conferences abroad. In 1954 he became a\nmember of the Polish Academy of Sciences. \n\nWhen Fleck emigrated with his wife to Israel in 1957, where his only\nson had been living for many years, he was already very ill with\ncancer and heart problems. For a few years he was employed in the\nInstitute of Biological Research in Ness Ziona. He then wrote in\nEnglish his last philosophical paper \u201cCrisis in Science. Towards\na Free and More Human Science\u201d, that was rejected by several\nphilosophical journals. Ludwik Fleck died on June 5, 1961, of a second\nheart attack.\n",
