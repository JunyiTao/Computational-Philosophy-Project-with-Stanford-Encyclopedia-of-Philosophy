    "main_text": "The Intrinsicness of Dispositions\n5. The Intrinsicness of Dispositions\n\nThe Intrinsic Dispositions Thesis (for short, IDT), the thesis that\ndispositions are intrinsic properties of their bearers, has been\nroutinely accepted by many philosophers like Harr\u00e9 (1970),\nArmstrong (1973), Mellor (1974), Mackie (1977), Bird (1998), Molnar\n(2003), Choi (2005b), and Menzies (2009). Accepting it, Lewis (1997)\nsays, \u2018if two things (actual or merely possible) are exact\nintrinsic duplicates (and if they are subject to the same laws of\nnature) then they are disposed alike\u2019 (p. 147). Lewis\u2019s\nqualification about the laws of nature is important, at least for\nthose who take the laws to be contingent, for without it IDT is\nscarcely plausible. If the laws are contingent then a fragile glass\nhas intrinsic duplicates that are not disposed to break when struck.\nSome of them will inhabit possible worlds whose laws of nature\ndetermine that, if struck, they would experience a gentle deformation\ntemporarily and then regain its original shape. IDT, therefore, should\nbe understood as the thesis that within any sphere of worlds with the\nsame laws of nature, any pair of objects with the same intrinsic\nproperties will have the same dispositions. (For discussion of the\nprecise meaning of the intrinsicness of dispositions, see Langton\n& Lewis 1998; Choi 2009; and Handfield 2009.)\n\nWidely accepted as it is, however, IDT is not obviously true.\nShoemaker (1980) considers a key\u2019s disposition to open his front door\nand points out that it could lose this disposition without undergoing\nany intrinsic change, for example, by the lock on his door being\nreplaced by one of a different kind. It would seem, then, that the\ndisposition to open Shoemaker\u2019s front door is not an intrinsic\nproperty of the key, and so IDT is false.\n\nThis apparent counterexample can be resisted, however. The only\nrelevant disposition possessed by Shoemaker\u2019s key, it might be\ninsisted, is the disposition to open locks of a\ncertain type\u2014the type of lock that is currently on\nShoemaker\u2019s front door. Since a change in the lock will not cause the\nkey to lose this disposition, it is an intrinsic disposition\u2014or\nat least the present example does not show that it is not intrinsic.\nAccording to this response, the predicate \u2018disposed to open\nShoemaker\u2019s front door\u2019 either fails to express a genuine\nproperty at all\u2014this is Shoemaker\u2019s view\u2014or else it\nsomehow manages to express the intrinsic disposition to open locks of\na certain type (Molnar 2003). McKitrick (2003a), however, argues that\nthis response fails. She goes further to argue that there are indeed\nmany cases of extrinsic dispositions, listing as\nexamples weight (a case borrowed from Yablo\n1999), vulnerability, visibility and recognizability.\nIn light of these examples, it seems hard to dismiss the\ncounterexamples to IDT as concerning spurious dispositions.\n\nIt is worth recalling that Lewis (1997) assumed IDT with a view to\nbolstering Martin\u2019s counterexamples to SCA. But it has\ncome to light that IDT is false. Does this necessitate that Lewis\nfails to bolster Martin\u2019s counterexamples? Choi (2009) answers this\nquestion in the affirmative.\n",
