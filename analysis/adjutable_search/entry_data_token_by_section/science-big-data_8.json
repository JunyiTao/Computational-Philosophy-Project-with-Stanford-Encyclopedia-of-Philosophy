Big Data Risks and the Ethics of Data Science\n\nIn closing, it is important to consider at least some of the risks and\nrelated ethical questions raised by research with big data. As already\nmentioned in the previous section, reliance on big data collected by\npowerful institutions or corporations risks raises significant social\nconcerns. Contrary to the view that sees big and open data as\nharbingers of democratic social participation in research, the way\nthat scientific research is governed and financed is not challenged by\nbig data. Rather, the increasing commodification and large value\nattributed to certain kinds of data (e.g., personal data) is\nassociated to an increase in inequality of power and visibility\nbetween different nations, segments of the population and scientific\ncommunities (O\u2019Neill 2016; Zuboff 2017; D\u2019Ignazio and\nKlein 2020). The digital gap between those who not only can access\ndata, but can also use it, is widening, leading from a state of\ndigital divide to a condition of \u201cdata divide\u201d\n(Bezuidenout et al. 2017).\n\nMoreover, the privatisation of data has serious implications for the\nworld of research and the knowledge it produces. Firstly, it affects\nwhich data are disseminated, and with which expectations. Corporations\nusually only release data that they regard as having lesser commercial\nvalue and that they need public sector assistance to interpret. This\nintroduces another distortion on the sources and types of data that\nare accessible online while more expensive and complex data are kept\nsecret. Even many of the ways in which citizens -researchers included\n- are encouraged to interact with databases and data interpretation\nsites tend to encourage participation that generates further\ncommercial value. Sociologists have recently described this type of\nsocial participation as a form of exploitation (Prainsack & Buyx\n2017; Srnicek 2017). In turn, these ways of\nexploiting data strengthen their economic value over their scientific\nvalue. When it comes to the commerce of personal data between\ncompanies working in analysis, the value of the data as commercial\nproducts -which includes the evaluation of the speed and efficiency\nwith which access to certain data can help develop new products -\noften has priority over scientific issues such as for example,\nrepresentativity and reliability of the data and the ways they were\nanalysed. This can result in decisions that pose a problem\nscientifically or that simply are not interested in investigating the\nconsequences of the assumptions made and the processes used. This lack\nof interest easily translates into ignorance of discrimination,\ninequality and potential errors in the data considered. This type of\nignorance is highly strategic and economically productive since it\nenables the use of data without concerns over social and scientific\nimplications. In this scenario the evaluation on the quality of data\nshrinks to an evaluation of their usefulness towards short-term\nanalyses or forecasting required by the client. There are no\nincentives in this system to encourage evaluation of the long-term\nimplications of data analysis. The risk here is that the commerce of\ndata is accompanied by an increasing divergence between data and their\ncontext. The interest in the history of the transit of data, the\nplurality of their emotional or scientific value and the re-evaluation\nof their origins tend to disappear over time, to be substituted by the\nincreasing hold of the financial value of data.\n\nThe multiplicity of data sources and tools for aggregation also\ncreates risks. The complexity of the data landscape is making it\nharder to identify which parts of the infrastructure require updating\nor have been put in doubt by new scientific developments. The\nsituation worsens when considering the number of databases that\npopulate every area of scientific research, each containing\nassumptions that influence the circulation and interoperability of\ndata and that often are not updated in a reliable and regular way.\nJust to provide an idea of the numbers involved, the prestigious\nscientific publication Nucleic Acids Research publishes a\nspecial issue on new databases that are relevant to molecular biology\nevery year and included: 56 new infrastructures in 2015, 62 in 2016,\n54 in 2017 and 82 in 2018. These are just a small proportion of the\nhundreds of databases that are developed each year in the life\nsciences sector alone. The fact that these databases rely on short\nterm funding means that a growing percentage of resources remain\navailable to consult online although they are long dead. This is a\ncondition that is not always visible to users of the database who\ntrust them without checking whether they are actively maintained or\nnot. At what point do these infrastructures become obsolete? What are\nthe risks involved in weaving an ever more extensive tapestry of\ninfrastructures that depend on each other, given the disparity in the\nways they are managed and the challenges in identifying and comparing\ntheir prerequisite conditions, the theories and scaffolding used to\nbuild them? One of these risks is rampant conservativism: the\ninsistence on recycling old data whose features and management\nelements become increasingly murky as time goes by, instead of\nencouraging the production of new data with features that specifically\nrespond to the requirements and the circumstances of their users. In\ndisciplines such as biology and medicine that study living beings and\ntherefore are by definition continually evolving and developing, such\ntrust in old data is particularly alarming. It is not the case, for\nexample, that data collected on fungi ten, twenty or even a hundred\nyears ago is reliable to explain the behaviour of the same species of\nfungi now or in the future (Leonelli 2018).\n\nResearchers of what Luciano Floridi calls the\ninfosphere\u2014the way in which the introduction of digital\ntechnologies is changing the world - are becoming aware of the\ndestructive potential of big data and the urgent need to focus efforts\nfor management and use of data in active and thoughtful ways towards\nthe improvement of the human condition. In Floridi\u2019s own words:\n\n\n\nICT yields great opportunity which, however, entails the enormous\nintellectual responsibility of understanding this technology to use it\nin the most appropriate way. (Floridi 2014: vii; see also\nBritish Academy & Royal Society 2017) \n\n\nIn light of these findings, it is essential that ethical and social\nissues are seen as a core part of the technical and scientific\nrequirements associated with data management and analysis. The ethical\nmanagement of data is not obtained exclusively by regulating the\ncommerce of research and management of personal data nor with the\nintroduction of monitoring of research financing, even though these\nare important strategies. To guarantee that big data are used in the\nmost scientifically and socially forward-thinking way it is necessary\nto transcend the concept of ethics as something external and alien to\nresearch. An analysis of the ethical implications of data science\nshould become a basic component of the background and activity of\nthose who take care of data and the methods used to view and analyse\nit. Ethical evaluations and choices are hidden\nin every aspect of data management, including those choices that may\nseem purely technical.\n",
