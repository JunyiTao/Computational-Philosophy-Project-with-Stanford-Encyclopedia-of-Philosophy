    "main_text": "Securitist Views || Fully Specified Immediate Options\n4.2 Fully Specified Immediate Options\n\nGoldman\u2019s revised view still adopts the insight behind\n (G*1)\n that, in order to avoid the possibility of jointly unfulfillable\nobligations, an obligatory act-set (or, as Goldman calls it, a sequence\nof acts) must be such that it would occur if the agent were to\nimmediately perform the first act of the act-set, and the agent can\nperform this first act of the act-set. Goldman\u2019s revised view\n(1978: 202) is referred to as \u201c4\u201d, but we will refer to\nit as (G+) here:\n\n\n(G+)\nS ought at\n\\(t_1\\) to perform maximal sequence X starting at \\(t_1\\) if\nand only if S has the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X,\nand X is better than any alternative maximal sequence starting\nfrom \\(t_1\\) which S also has the ability at \\(t_1\\) to\n  perform.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike\n (G*1) ,\n Goldman\u2019s revised view requires the first act to be a fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set. Moreover, the kind of act-set that\nshould be directly assessed is a maximal sequence. S\nhas the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X only if S has\nthe ability at \\(t_1\\) to immediately (at \\(t_1)\\) perform the first\nfully specific simultaneous act-set in \\(X.\\) Goldman\u2019s (1978:\n201) notion of a maximal sequence is different from the\npossibilist\u2019s aforementioned notion of a maximal act-set which\nextends to the end of one\u2019s life. For, according to Goldman\n(1978: 193\u2013195), at t an agent can perform an act-set\nover time if and only if, if at t the agent wanted to perform\nthis act-set, then the agent would do so over time. This implies that\nthe performable act-set over time must be such that the agent can, at\nt, form an intention to perform this act-set over time that\nwould be causally efficacious if the intention were formed.\nGoldman\u2019s notion of a maximal sequence is thus more restricted.\nThat is, a maximal sequence X is an act-set available to an\nagent at t is such that, at t, the agent can form an\nintention to perform X, and no other act-set that at t\nthe agent can intend to perform is a proper part of X. So,\nhenceforth, we will refer to Goldman\u2019s notion of a maximal\nsequence as an intentionally maximal act-set, and this is to\nbe distinguished from a maximal act-set.\n\nRecall that, according to Ability 2, an agent S has\nthe ability to immediately perform the first fully specific act-set in\nan intentionally maximal act-set if and only if S would perform\nthis fully specific act-set if S wanted to do so, and by\nextension we may assume Jones can perform each of (1)\u2013(4). Under\nthis assumption,\n (G+)\n implies that although Jones would \u27e8change lanes\u27e9 if she\nwere to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9, Jones nevertheless ought to do\nsomething that requires her to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9, viz.\n\u27e8not change lanes & not accelerate\u27e9. To see how (G+)\ndiffers from the versions of actualism in\n section 3,\n consider the following version of Professor\nProcrastinate:\n\n Professor Procrastinate*: If\nProcrastinate were to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\),\nthen Procrastinate would do so by deciding at \\(t_1\\) to harm the\nstudent by falsely promising to review at \\(t_2\\). So if Procrastinate\nwere to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would\n\u27e8not comment\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\). However, Procrastinate can\n\u27e8accept and comment\u27e9 by deciding at \\(t_1\\) to do so.\nMoreover, if Procrastinate were to do this, then it would be true that\nif Procrastinate were to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8comment\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\) (cf.\nPortmore 2011: 204).\n\n\nAccording to\n (G+)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform an intentionally\nmaximal act-set M that includes \u27e8accepting the request\nand commenting\u27e9 because there is an immediate fully specific\nact-set available to Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) such that if it were\nperformed then M would occur, and M is the best\nintentionally maximal act-set that is securable for Procrastinate at\n\\(t_1\\). By contrast, according to\n (G*1)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to \u27e8not accept the\nrequest\u27e9 because this would result in the performance of\nact-set M* that includes \u27e8not commenting\u27e9 at\n\\(t_2\\), and M* is better than the act-set M** that\nwould occur if Procrastinate were to \u27e8accept the\nrequest\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) because M** includes\n\u27e8accepting & not commenting\u27e9.\n\nOne might suspect that a modified version of\n (G*1)\n that focuses exclusively upon decisions rather than overt bodily acts\ncan handle synchronic actualist-possibilist cases, such as\nProfessor Procrastinate*. But this isn\u2019t so because it\nis possible for the following two counterfactuals to be true:\n\n If Procrastinate were to \u27e8decide to accept the\nrequest\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8decide to both\naccept the request & not comment\u27e9.\n If Procrastinate were to \u27e8decide to both accept the\nrequest & comment\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would\n\u27e8accept the request & comment\u27e9.\n\n\nEven though (i) is true, the best thing that Procrastinate can do\ninvolves \u27e8deciding to accept the request\u27e9, viz.\n\u27e8deciding to accept the request & commenting\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\). This shows that whether we assess an agent\u2019s\nobligations in terms of decisions or overt bodily acts, the acts that\nare to be directly assessed are fully specific simultaneous act-sets,\nwhich is precisely what\n (G+)\n accomplishes.\n\nContextualist actualism and Goldman\u2019s provisional but rejected\nprinciple\n (G)\n similarly imply that Jones is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform (1)\nrather than any of (2)\u2013(4) since these views permit a\ncandidate obligatory act to be fully specific. But these views do not\nrequire a candidate obligatory act to be fully specific, and\nthus these views also have the peculiar implication that in\nTraffic II Jones is obligated to \u27e8accelerate\u27e9\nand Jones is obligated to \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9.\n",
