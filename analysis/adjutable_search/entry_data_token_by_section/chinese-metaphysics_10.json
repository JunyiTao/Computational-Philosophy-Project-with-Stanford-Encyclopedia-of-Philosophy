Coherence and Vital Energy in Neo-Confucianism\n\nThe interpenetration of emptiness and phenomena is an affirmation of\nthe changing world in which we live. Thus, it is false to see Chinese\nBuddhism as life-negating or as denying the diversity of the world.\nNonetheless, the metaphysics of emptiness is directed toward\novercoming attachments. Diversity remains, but there are no\nindividuals to grasp. The Confucian response, which became a dominant\nforce in the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), was driven primarily by an\naversion to these consequences. This reaction can be seen in three\nconcrete positions\u2014the acceptance of suffering and death as\nunavoidable, the differentiation of roles and norms within society,\nand the embrace of negative affects such as sorrow at the death of a\nparent or anxious concern for a child in danger. This Confucian\nmovement is known in Chinese as the \u201cLearning of the Way\u201d\n(Daoxue \u9053\u5b78) and in English as\n\u201cNeo-Confucianism.\u201d\n\nWhile based on practical concerns, this Confucian revival was\nsupported by metaphysical\n claims.[11]\n In terms of the dialectal movement we have seen, the Neo-Confucians\ntake all of the Buddhist positions as nihilistic. The first\ninfluential Confucian responses appear in cosmological arguments. We\ncan take Zhang Zai \u5f35\u8f09 (1020\u20131077) as an example.\n(For studies of Zhang Zai, see Ziporyn 2015; Kim 2015; Kasoff 1984.)\nZhang Zai\u2019s basic move is to argue that the ultimate, labeled as\n\u201cSupreme Emptiness\u201d (Taixu \u592a\u865b),\ncannot be nothingness but must be qi, and the fundamental\ncharacteristic of this qi must be a dynamic interplay between\nopposites. Zhang explains:\n\n\nThe Supreme Emptiness of necessity consists of vital energy. Vital\nenergy of necessity integrates to become the myriad things. Things of\nnecessity disintegrate and return to the Supreme Emptiness. Appearance\nand disappearance following this cycle are a matter of necessity.\n(trans. modified from W. Chan 1969: 501)\n\n\nThere are several important points to note in Zhang Zai\u2019s\nposition. First, he explicitly argues that the only way to explain the\norigins of the world we experience is if dynamism and differentiation\nare the very nature of existence. For this reason, Brook Ziporyn\nargues that the ultimate for Zhang Zai is not qi but harmony\nitself (Ziporyn 2015). Second, by positing qi as fundamental,\nZhang Zai shifts from questions about nihilism and reification back to\nthe relationship between the formed and the formless. In making the\nformed and formless two modalities of existence, Zhang Zai allows that\nboth are equally real. In this way, he reaffirms the importance of\nindividuated things like parents and children.\n\nZhang Zai\u2019s cosmology echoes the earlier Chinese cosmologies\ndiscussed in Section 3. To say that the nature of qi is\nactive differentiation is to say that the nature of qi is\nsheng, vitality or generation. This emphasis on being as a\nforce of growth and vitality was a common point among Neo-Confucians,\nlinked directly to the virtue of ren \u4ec1, humaneness or\nbenevolence. To be humane is to support and extend the generative\nprocess of nature itself. Furthermore, there is a unity to things in\nthe world, grounded in the fact that they are all made up of\nqi and they unfold in interlocking patterns of influence. As\nZhang Zai puts it in the famous Western Inscription:\n\n\nHeaven is my father and earth is my mother, and even such a small\ncreature as I finds an intimate place in their midst. Therefore that\nwhich fills the universe I regard as my body [ti \u9ad4]\nand that which directs the universe I consider as my nature\n[xing \u6027]. All people are my brothers and sisters, and\nall things are my companions. (trans from W. Chan 1969: 497)\n\n\nCheng Hao \u7a0b\u9865 (1032\u20131085) compares one who does not\ncare for other things to someone who has lost sensation in their own\nlimbs. Wang Yangming \u738b\u967d\u660e (1472\u20131529)\nextends these feelings of concern even to trampled grass and broken\ntiles.\n\nDeriving inclusive care from the vitality and unity of nature appeared\nin the Warring States Period, but in opposition to Confucianism. For\nthe Confucians, this focus on being as vitality needs an inherent\norder, which came through a reinterpretation of the term li\n\u7406. The complexity of the term appears in the range of common\ntranslations: principle, patterns, coherence. Li often refers\nto something we should follow and in this sense it might be taken as\nprinciples, but li also refers to actual patterns of\ndifferentiation, not just to ideals. Considering that li is\ncontextual and involves human purposes and perspectives, translating\nthe term as \u201ccoherence\u201d or \u201ccoherent patterns\u201d\nprobably best brings these various aspects together. Stephen C. Angle\ngives an excellent brief definition of li as \u201cthe\nvaluable, intelligible way that things fit together\u201d (Angle\n2009:\n 32).[12]\n There are patterns of coherence in the world, and these patterns\ndefine individual things, constitute nature as a system, and structure\nhuman society. Li describes the way that these patterns can\nbe optimally harmonized or made to cohere so as to foster the human\ngood (i.e., to be valuable and intelligible).\n\nThe Neo-Confucian interpretation of li is a return to earlier\nChinese views that took nature as having stable patterns that we can\nrecognize and follow. The Neo-Confucians defend these earlier views\nagainst what they saw as Buddhist attacks by claiming that the\ndifferentiated structure of the world we live in is real. These\npatterns of coherence give specific form to our concerns and efforts,\nso that one can justify caring primarily for one\u2019s own parents\nwhile still taking all things as extensions of one\u2019s own body.\nEven so, the Neo-Confucian conception of li retains several\nBuddhist aspects.\n\nThe most obvious example is the claim that the totality of li\nis contained in any one thing. Cheng Yi \u7a0b\u9824\n(1033\u20131107) coined what became a standard motto: \u201cLi is\none but distinguished as many\u201d (li yi fen shu\n\u7406\u4e00\u5206\u6b8a) (Angle 2009: 44). This unity within\ndiversity was illustrated with a metaphor taken from\nBuddhism\u2014the moon reflects on many different surfaces, but it\nremains the one same moon. Since li refers to patterns of\ncoherence and all things ultimately form one body, it follows that all\nthings are mutually implicated, a point already discussed in relation\nto Huayan Buddhism above. The Neo-Confucians do not go so far as to\nsay that each thing contains all other things,\nthough. Any instance of coherence implicates all others, but events\nstill have their own reality.\n\nAnother common Neo-Confucian claim with Buddhist overtones follows: if\nthe totality of li is included within any particular thing,\nthen it must exist within each person\u2019s heart/mind. One of the\nmain disputes among the Neo-Confucians was on the precise meaning and\nsignificance of this point. Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\nargued that li is the nature (xing) found in the\nheart, while Lu Xiangshan \u9678\u8c61\u5c71 (1139\u20131192)\nand Wang Yangming took li and the heart to be identical. This\nleads to a difference in emphasis between the two main schools of\nNeo-Confucianism regarding their recommended process of accessing\nli: the \u201cSchool of Li\u201d (lixue\n\u7406\u5b78) (also known as the Cheng-Zhu school) placed more\nemphasis on study and learning, while the \u201cSchool of\nHeart/Mind\u201d (xinxue \u5fc3\u5b78) (the Lu-Wang\nschool) concentrated more on self-reflection. This difference, though,\nis one of emphasis: since they agreed that li could be\naccessed through our own heart and through things in the world, all\nNeo-Confucians promoted both self-reflection and learning.\n\nNeo-Confucians always discuss li in relation to qi,\nvital energy. If li refers to patterns of coherence,\nqi is the stuff in which those patterns inhere. This\ndistinction has functional similarities with Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between form and matter, but the force of activity and\nchange is with qi rather than li. That means that\nli must be immanent in qi in some sense. The precise\nontological status of li and qi became one of the\nmain metaphysical disputes among Confucian philosophers. One could\neasily claim that the distinction between patterns of coherence and\nthe stuff that follows the patterns is conceptual rather than\nontological. That is close to the view seen in Zhang Zai, for whom\nqi is active and inherently patterned. For Zhu Xi and Wang\nYangming, though, li has ontological priority over\nqi. Zhu Xi writes:\n\n\nFundamentally, li and vital energy cannot be spoken of as\nprior or posterior. But if we must trace their origin, we are obliged\nto say that li is prior. However, li is not a\nseparate entity. It exists right in vital energy. Without vital\nenergy, li would have nothing to adhere to. (trans. modified\nfrom W. Chan 1969: 634)\n\n\nThe question of the relationship between qi and li\nextended into cosmogonies as well. While Zhang Zai took qi to\nbe the ultimate, Zhu Xi claimed the ultimate was li (using\nthe term Supreme Polarity). Since li is the locus of\nintelligibility and values, the question ultimately was whether causal\nand explanatory priority was with this coherence or if coherence was\ninstead a product of the generative forces of nature\n(qi).\n\nThe distinction between li and qi provided a way to\ndeal with the tension between the claim that the nature of human\nbeings is good and the recognition that people need extensive\nself-cultivation in order to actually be good. Li is\ninherently good and is the same in all things. In that sense, we\nalready have all that we need. The quality of qi, though,\nvaries. Turbid qi\u2014which manifests itself as selfishness\nand partiality\u2014obscures li. Thus from the perspective\nof li human nature is good, but from the perspective of\nli and qi together, a person can be good, bad, or in\nbetween. On the psychological level, the work of self-cultivation is\ncultivating tranquility and impartiality; on the metaphysical level,\none purifies qi so as to more perfectly express and\nparticipate in li.\n\nThis view of self-cultivation inherits the Buddhist claim that, since\neveryone possesses Buddha-nature (fo xing), everyone is\nalready enlightened, but merges it with Mengzi\u2019s claim that\nhuman nature (xing) is good. Unlike Mengzi, the process of\nself-cultivation is not a process of extension but rather of removing\nthe obstacles that keep us from being what we already are. Phillip J.\nIvanhoe has nicely captured this point by contrasting the views of\nself-cultivation for Mengzi and Wang Yangming as the difference\nbetween a model of development and a model of discovery (Ivanhoe\n2002). As in Buddhism, what needs to be removed are selfish and biased\ndesires. Unlike Buddhism, and in line with Mengzi, this enlightened\ncondition does not lead to a calm state free of desires and negative\nemotions. Instead, the li within us is expressed as\nspontaneously appropriate desires and emotions, including negative\nemotions like grief for a dying parent or anxious concern for a child\nin danger.\n",
