Life and Career\n\nLuk\u00e1cs was born Bern\u00e1t Gy\u00f6rgy L\u00f6winger on\nApril 13, 1885, in Budapest. He received a Ph.D. in Political Science\nfrom the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r in 1906 and a doctorate from\nthe University of Budapest in 1909. In the following years,\nLuk\u00e1cs made a name for himself as a literary and aesthetic\ntheorist, working in Budapest, Berlin (where he was influenced by\nGeorg Simmel), Florence, and Heidelberg. In 1910 and 1911,\nLuk\u00e1cs published his essay collection Soul and Form\nand, together with Lajos F\u00fclep, founded the short-lived\navant-garde journal A Szellem (The Spirit).\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s world was sent into turmoil at that time by the\ndeath of his close friend Leo Popper and by the suicide of Irma\nSeidler, who had been his lover. He felt responsible for Seidler\u2019s\ndeath, and it proved to have an enormous impact on him, as reflected\nin his 1911 essay \u201cOn Poverty of Spirit.\u201d\n\nDuring the same period, Luk\u00e1cs developed a close connection\nwith Max and Marianne Weber in Heidelberg, with Ernst Bloch, and with\nthe Neo-Kantian philosophers Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask. Between\n1912 and 1914 he worked on a first attempt to formulate a systematic\napproach to art, which remained unpublished during his lifetime\n(GW 16). In the First World War, Luk\u00e1cs was exempted\nfrom frontline military service. In 1914, he married the Russian\npolitical activist (and convicted terrorist) Jelena Grabenko.\n\nIn 1913, Luk\u00e1cs began participating in the influential\n\u201cSunday circle\u201d of Budapest intellectuals, which included\nKarl Mannheim. After returning from wartime service in the Hungarian\ncensor\u2019s office, he published The Theory of the Novel\n(1916). In 1917, despite Weber\u2019s support, he failed to receive a\nHabilitation (teaching qualification) at the University of Heidelberg.\nBetween 1916 and 1918, he also resumed his work on aesthetics, which\nresulted in the unpublished manuscript of the so-called\n\u201cHeidelberg Aesthetics\u201d (GW 17). To the surprise\nof many of his friends, Luk\u00e1cs joined the Hungarian Communist\nParty in 1918, although, as his essay on \u201cBolshevism as a Moral\nProblem\u201d attests, not without reservations.\n\nFollowing his rapid ascent as one of the leading thinkers of the\nCommunist Party, Luk\u00e1cs became more involved in day-to-day\npolitics. After the revolution in 1919, he first served as a deputy\ncommissar and then as commissar of public education in B\u00e9la Kun\u2019s\ngovernment. Later, when war broke out, he served as a political\ncommissar in the Hungarian Red Army (in which role he ordered the\nexecution of several soldiers; see Kadarkay 1991: 223). After the\ncommunist government was defeated, Luk\u00e1cs fled to Vienna at the\nend of 1919, where he married his second wife, Gertrud Bortstieber.\nCharged with coordinating the clandestine activities of the exiled\nCommunist Party, he remained under constant threat of expulsion to\nHungary.\n\nIn 1923, Luk\u00e1cs published his most famous work, the essay\ncollection History and Class Consciousness. In these essays,\nLuk\u00e1cs argues forcefully for a philosophically self-reflective\nversion of Marxism as a solution to the problems that vexed modern\nphilosophy, develops the idea of capitalist society as a\n\u201ctotality\u201d that is totally integrated as the value-form,\nsketches a distinctive Marxist epistemology, and identifies structural\nunfreedom (rather than exploitation or inequality) as the fundamental\nproblem of capitalism. In these essays, Luk\u00e1cs draws not only\non Marxist classics but also on sociological insights into the\ncharacter of modern societies that he acquired through Weber and\nSimmel. His reformulation of the philosophical premises of Marxism\nentails a rejection of the then contemporary forms of materialism and\nscientism endorsed by many Soviet party intellectuals. Unsurprisingly,\nthe party orthodoxy condemned the book as an expression of\nultra-leftism (in spite of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s pro-Leninist revisions to\nthe articles in the volume that had already appeared previously; see\nL\u00f6wy 1979: 172\u2013179).\n\nNevertheless, the book had a decisive influence on the early Frankfurt\nSchool. Luk\u00e1cs participated in the 1923 \u201cMarxist Work\nWeek,\u201d which laid the foundation for the founding of the\nInstitute for Social Research, and there is evidence that the major\ncritical theorists of the time were all deeply impressed by the\nreification essay in particular (Stahl 2018). Overall, History and\nClass Consciousness cemented Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s position as a\nleading scholar of Marxism, putting him at the forefront of the\ndebates of the time (an example being his quickly written study on\nLenin on the occasion of the Soviet leader\u2019s death in 1924). In\n1928, however, Luk\u00e1cs had to give up his political activities\nafter he presented the so-called \u201cBlum Theses\u201d (see 1928).\nIn this draft of a party platform for Hungary, which was named after\nhis party alias, he argued for a broad, democratic dictatorship of\nworkers and peasants. These theses were condemned as a right-wing\ndeviation by the party (which denounced him as both a left-wing and a\nright-wing dissident within a span of five years).\n\nFollowing another arrest by the Austrian authorities, Luk\u00e1cs\nleft Vienna in 1929, first for Berlin and then for Budapest, where he\nwent underground for three months. He was eventually summoned by the\nSoviet party leadership to Moscow, where he stayed from 1930 on,\nleaving only for Comintern missions in Berlin and for Tashkent during\nthe war. In Moscow, Luk\u00e1cs held a position at the Marx-Engels\nInstitute. During this time, he first came into contact with early\nworks by Marx that had previously remained\nunpublished. As Luk\u00e1cs became (at least outwardly) increasingly\nsubservient to the Stalinist orthodoxy, he publicly retracted the\nviews espoused in History and Class Consciousness (see\n1933b). The degree of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s agreement with Stalinism is\ndisputed to this day (see Lichtheim 1970; Deutscher 1972; Kolakowski\n1978; Pike 1988). However, it is clear from his writings that while he\npublicly defended Stalinist dogmas in both aesthetics and politics\nduring the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s (1933a, 1938, 1951), he later\nrepeatedly criticized Stalin and Stalinism (see 1957, 1962).\n\nIn 1944, Luk\u00e1cs returned to Budapest and became a professor at\nthe local university. In 1948, he published his two-volume study\nThe Young Hegel (written partly during the 1930s in Moscow).\nIn 1949, he also traveled to Paris to engage in a debate about\nexistentialism and Marxism with Sartre. The works of this period\nreflect both his allegiance to orthodox Soviet Marxism and his\nuneasiness with the Stalinist post-war situation. A widely criticized\nwriting from this time is The Destruction of Reason,\npublished in 1954. It denounced much of the German philosophical and\nliterary tradition after Marx as an outgrowth of\n\u201cirrationalism\u201d and as bearing responsibility for the\nascent of National Socialism. During this time, Luk\u00e1cs also\ncontinued to defend a conservative ideal of realism in aesthetics (see\n1951).\n\nAfter again being subjected to criticism from the party and virtually\nexcluded from public life in the mid-1950s, Luk\u00e1cs was able to\nembark on a new chapter following the Hungarian uprising against\nSoviet rule in 1956. Following Stalin\u2019s death, not only did it\nbecome increasingly possible for him to publicly criticize Stalinism\nand to again voice his vision of the future of Marxism (for the first\ntime since 1928), arguing that the Communist Party should regain\npublic trust by competing with other leftist forces within a\nmulti-party democracy, but he also served in the short-lived Nagy\ngovernment as minister for public education. After the subsequent\nSoviet invasion, he was arrested and imprisoned in Romania. Unlike\nother members of the government, he was not executed but merely\nexpelled from the Communist Party, which he did not rejoin until 1969.\nFrom the 1960s on, Luk\u00e1cs\u2014having had to retire from all\nacademic positions\u2014worked on his two-volume Specificity of\nthe Aesthetic and on a Marxist ethics that would later partly\nbecome the Ontology of Social Being, which remained\nunfinished in his lifetime. He also continued to publish extensively\non literature and art. Luk\u00e1cs passed away on June 4, 1971, in\nBudapest.\n2. Early Writings\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early writings\u2014before his turn to Marxism in\n1918\u2014are animated by concerns that are also present, albeit\ntransformed, in his later political thought. In this period,\nLuk\u00e1cs formulates a sophisticated aesthetic theory and critique\nof modern culture, which he diagnoses as being characterized by an\ninsurmountable abyss between objective cultural forms and the richness\nof \u201cgenuine life.\u201d\n\nHe takes up the issue of the relationship between \u201cform\u201d\nand \u201clife\u201d in three different but closely interconnected\ndiscussions. First, there is the question of how the element of\n\u201cform\u201d distinguishes art as a separate sphere of value.\nThis is most explicitly discussed in his two attempts at a systematic\nphilosophy of art. Second, there is the sociological-historical\nquestion about the relation between (individual and collective) life\nand aesthetic and ethical forms in modern bourgeois society. This\ntopic is dominant both in the History of the Modern Drama\n(1909) and in the Theory of the Novel (1916). A third strand\nconcerns existential and ethical questions, most explicitly discussed\nin Soul and Form and in the essay \u201cOn Poverty of\nSpirit.\u201d\n\nAlongside \u201cform\u201d, two central concepts in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early thought are \u201ctotality\u201d and\n\u201clife.\u201d By \u201ctotality\u201d Luk\u00e1cs means a\nwhole set of elements that are meaningfully interrelated in such a way\nthat the essence of each element can only be understood in relation to\nthe others. \u201cLife\u201d denotes the intrinsic richness and\npotentiality of experiences and actions. Both individual and social\nlife are in principle capable of forming an integrated totality.\nHowever, this is only the case if the essential properties of life\u2019s\nelements are intelligible in terms of their relations to other\nparticulars of life. Luk\u00e1cs claims that this was the case in\nHomeric Greece, where a totality of meaning was immanent to life\nitself. This immanence of meaning and the totality it constituted were\nlost in subsequent historical developments, however, as form became\nexternal to life.\n\nIn regard to the relation between form and life, we can distinguish\nbetween forms that are forms of life itself, produced by that\nlife, and abstract forms which are imposed onto life from the outside.\nWhen a form is imposed on life that is not a form of that specific\nmode of life (or if the form in question cannot be realized in\nempirical life), such an imposition always runs the risk of distorting\nthe meanings of the particular actions or persons. But at the same\ntime, form is necessary for life to become intelligible and unified\n(see Bernstein 1984: 77\u201380). Within the sphere of individual\nagency, persons face this dilemma in regard to the choice of either\nauthentically expressing the particular meanings of their own life,\nrisking the loss of form and, consequently, the loss of intelligible\naccess to these meanings, or of imposing an external form as a\nnormative demand on their life, risking distortion, inauthenticity and\neven the denial of life itself.\n2.1 Life and Form\n\nExcept for the History of the Modern Drama (1909),\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s earliest work is self-consciously essayistic in\nform. As Luk\u00e1cs explains in \u201cOn the Nature and Form of\nthe Essay\u201d (1911a), this is because the essay addresses life\nthrough the medium of form (1911a: 8) and takes form (in particular,\nthe form of a work of art) seriously as a subject. Essayistic writing\nis not only writing about form, however; it must always\nexamine the conditions under which life can be given form in the first\nplace. Modernity has made this problem more virulent insofar as the\nexisting means by which life can give itself form have become\nproblematic, such that we now experience them as abstractions.\n\nFollowing Weber, Luk\u00e1cs characterizes the bourgeois form of\nlife in terms of the primacy of an ethics of work and inner strength.\nCorresponding to this form of life, Luk\u00e1cs claims, there was\nonce a form of art that was capable of expressing an unproblematic\nrelationship between life and form (for example, in Theodor Storm\u2019s\ncase, the insight that the bourgeois citizen must concentrate on work\nand entrust the formation of life to fate; see 1910a: 60). However,\nwhen that bourgeois life-form disappeared, the remaining bourgeois\n\u201cway of life\u201d was transformed into a kind of asceticism\nthat grew hostile to life itself. The same holds for the corresponding\nmovement, within art, of rejecting life in favor of \u201cart for its\nown sake,\u201d that is, a form of artistic production that\nself-consciously (and with justification) refuses to express life\nbecause it has no foundation in a corresponding life form.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs thus argues that modern art is caught in the dilemma of\nhaving to achieve harmony between life and form, either at the expense\nof life\u2019s intensity or at a purely symbolic and imaginary\nlevel\u2014by effectively withdrawing from life (an idea he discusses\nin reference to Novalis; see 1908: 50; see also Butler 2010: 9). In\nboth cases, art turns against life. By contrast, a genuine attempt to\ngive \u201creal\u201d or \u201cabsolute life\u201d (that is,\ngenuinely meaningful life as opposed to the chaos of \u201cempirical\nlife\u201d; see Kavoulakos 2014: 22\u201326; M\u00e1rkus 1983: 11;\nL\u00f6wy 1979: 104) a distinct form necessarily involves the\nrejection of the meaningless necessities of ordinary life. In\n\u201cThe Metaphysics of Tragedy\u201d (1910b), Luk\u00e1cs\nascribes this task to modern tragedy. When nature and fate have become\n\u201cterrifyingly soulless\u201d (1910b: 154) and any hope for a\n\u201cfriendly order\u201d (ibid.) has disappeared, the tragic\nbecomes a task\u2014that of rejecting ordinary life in favor of the\nopportunity to \u201clive within the periphery of tragedy\u201d\n(1910b: 173).\n\nThe ethical dimension of the relation between life and form is made\nmost explicit in Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s essay on Kierkegaard and in\n\u201cOn Poverty of Spirit.\u201d Kierkegaard\u2019s rejection of\nRegine Olsen\u2019s love is lauded for its expression of the need to give\none\u2019s own empirical life a definite, unambiguous form, thereby\ntransforming it into absolute life\u2014in Kierkegaard\u2019s case, by\nattempting to perform an authentic gesture (1910c: 28). Yet\nKierkegaard\u2019s ethical position suffered from a defect: he attempted\nto reconcile ordinary life with a form that was only appropriate for\ngenuine, \u201cabsolute\u201d life. Due to its inherent ambiguity\nand foreignness to form, ordinary life cannot ever be successfully\nlived in such a way (1910c: 40). Thus, Kierkegaard\u2019s attempt to live\na genuine life was doomed from the start.\n\nThe conclusion of this line of thought seems to point towards an\ninsoluble dilemma. But the 1911 essay \u201cOn Poverty of\nSpirit\u201d\u2014a fusion of an autobiographical reflection on\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s role in Irma Seidler\u2019s suicide and an examination\nof theoretical issues\u2014points to a different conclusion: the\nrejection of an \u201cethics of duty.\u201d Luk\u00e1cs argues\nthat our adherence to a formal, rule-based ethics is to be blamed for\nour alienation from life. Even though the submission to\n\u201cform\u201d that is implicit in adopting a formalist ethics is\nthe basis from which social life becomes possible in the first place,\nit prevents people from forming \u201chuman relationships.\u201d As\nLuk\u00e1cs writes, \u201c[f]orm [\u2026] is like a bridge that\nseparates\u201d (1911b: 44). Luk\u00e1cs contrasts such an ethics\nwith the ideal of \u201cgoodness,\u201d which represents \u201creal\nlife.\u201d \u201cGoodness\u201d involves a rejection of rules and\nduties towards others in favor of pure actions that may be sinful,\nchaotic, and futile. The soul of the good person, Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims, \u201cis a pure white slate, upon which fate writes its\nabsurd command\u201d (1911b: 48). This anti-consequentialist and\nanti-deontological ethics of pure action ultimately culminates in a\nconception of \u201cworks.\u201d Only by sacrificing themselves for\nthe sake of works can people (or, as Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s narrator\nclaims, \u201cmen\u201d) empty themselves of the psychological\ncontent of everyday life and prepare themselves for the grace of\ngoodness. This final line of thought points towards a social utopia:\nby overcoming the alienated world of \u201cmechanical forces\u201d\n(1911b: 45) through works that transform life, we may recover a\ngenuine community with and a direct knowledge of others wherein\n\u201csubject and object collapse into each other\u201d (1911b: 46).\nThis vision of a final overcoming of alienation seems to offer a way\nout of the theoretical impasse of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s earlier position,\nbut at the cost of endorsing ethical decisionism.\n2.2 Neo-Kantian Aesthetics\n\nWhile Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s cultural criticism seeks to capture\ndistinctively modern phenomena, its claims are backed up by an\naesthetic theory that aims to discover transcendental conditions of\nthe aesthetic that are immune to historical variability. Even though\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early work draws on Georg Simmel\u2019s theory of\nculture and on the Nietzschean idea of an intrinsic tension between\nlife and form, its central anchoring point is a Neo-Kantian framework\n(for a detailed discussion of the influence of Emil Lask in\nparticular, see Kavoulakos 2014). This framework is most clearly\nevident in his two systematic attempts to produce a philosophy of art\nin Heidelberg (GW 16 and 17). Here, Luk\u00e1cs seeks to\nprovide a philosophical explanation of the conditions of the\npossibility of art that takes the work of art as the\nfundamental locus of aesthetic meaning, rather than deriving this\nmeaning from either artistic creation or aesthetic experience.\n\nIn his early aesthetic thought, Luk\u00e1cs\ndistinguishes\u2014taking up Neo-Kantian terminology\u2014between\ndifferent spheres of reality. The most immediate sphere is the\n\u201creality of experience,\u201d in which everything appears as an\nobject of qualitative experience, or (in the 1916 version) as having a\ngiven object character (Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit) that is\nfundamentally heterogeneous. Luk\u00e1cs envisages two arguments\nconcerning the role that art can play in relation to this sphere: in\nthe 1912 Philosophy of Art, he argues that any adequate\ncommunication of meaning between people must appear impossible from\nwithin the experiential sphere, since the infinite qualitative\nparticulars of experience cannot ever be successfully communicated.\nHowever, the desire to communicate meaning drives people to adopt\ndifferent means of communication that, although inadequate for\nexpressing the reality of experience, enable them to overcome their\nseparateness by relating to each other in terms of other spheres of\nreality (for example, the sphere of logical validity). While logic and\nethics constitute \u201cpure\u201d spheres of communicable meaning,\nhowever, the categories of the aesthetic cannot be fully separated\nfrom experience.\n\nIn the 1916 Aesthetics, Luk\u00e1cs adopts a more radical\nversion of this Neo-Kantian argument: whereas the reality of everyday\nlife is characterized by a heterogeneity of forms of objects, the\naesthetic sphere of validity is characterized by a distinct form of\nobjectivity that is legislated as a norm by experience\nitself. Thus, the contrast between everyday life and art is not one\nbetween experience and validity but one between the heterogeneity of\neveryday life and the homogeneous form that is appropriate to the\nautonomy of experience (GW 17: 36). Consequently, in\ncomparison to the logical and ethical spheres of validity, aesthetics\nhas a distinct status. While in these other spheres of validity\nobjective norms and subjective attitudes are fully separable, the\nautonomy of experience legislates a normative standard that involves a\nspecific relationship between subjective experience and objective\nnorm.\n\nThe value that defines the aesthetic sphere, Luk\u00e1cs claims, can\nonly be derived from the concept of the work of art since this concept\nis presupposed by all descriptions of artistic production or aesthetic\nexperience. Even though neither production nor reception is\nconstitutive of the value of works of art, they can still serve as a\nbasis for reconstructing the independent normative status of\naesthetics. The result of this analysis is a conception of the work of\nart as an ideal homogeneous unity of form and material. In\nthe 1912 Philosophy of Art, this unity is characterized in\nterms of the experiential content\u2019s becoming completely communicable\nand containing all possible aspects of a possible experience, thus\nforming a \u201cconcrete totality\u201d (GW 16: 83, 91, 112\nand GW 17: 110) of its own world within itself. By contrast,\nin the 1916 Aesthetics, it is brought about through a process\nin which the constitutive function of experience becomes completely\nautonomous, determining both form and content. Such an ideal work of\nart is, in virtue of this harmony, a Utopian fulfillment of the\nattitudes that are already operative in the ordinary world of\nexperience (GW 16: 82).\n\nWorks of art therefore present us with an \u201cimmanent\nutopia\u201d of experience, that is, with the vision of a form of\nexperience that is ordered and unified by a constitutive\n\u201cstandpoint\u201d (GW 16: 82) such that form and\ncontent are completely appropriate for each other. Because of these\nfeatures, such an experience embodies a maximum of objectivity in the\nsubject\u2019s relation to an object that is completely appropriate to\nits subjectivity (GW 17: 100). This finally answers the\nquestion regarding the a priori conditions of art: as an\nideal of a particular kind of possible experience, the work of art is\nalways historically specific. However, both the potential to\nbecome a totality in virtue of their form and the normative\ndemand to do so are timeless, a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of works of art in the Neo-Kantian sense (GW\n16: 168).\n2.3 Modernity and the Loss of Totality\n\nAnother aspect of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s early work concerns the historical\nchanges undergone by our relation to form. In his early analysis of\nthe history and sociology of drama (History of the Modern\nDrama, 1909), Luk\u00e1cs develops an account of the connection\nbetween aesthetic genres and historical changes. He argues that drama\nis connected to specific historical circumstances: for drama to exist,\nthere needs to be a prevailing Weltanschauung (GW\n15: 44) that seeks drama as its preferred mode of expression. This\ntragic Weltanschauung only exists in periods of societal\ndisintegration, when individual emotions and objective facts are so\nmismatched as to elicit heroic forms of denial of social reality.\n\nIn The Theory of the Novel (1916), Luk\u00e1cs turns\ntowards the philosophy of history in order to clarify the relationship\nbetween the historical changes undergone by transcendental standpoints\nand the \u201cpure forms\u201d of aesthetic genres. The primary\nobject of his discussion is the epic: Luk\u00e1cs claims that works\nof art that belong to this genre\u2014for example Homeric epic poetry\nand the modern novel\u2014must always express the objective reality\nof social and individual human life as it is (1916: 46).\nHowever, because of the distinctive \u201cmetaphysical\nconditions\u201d of different epochs, they express this objective\nreality in radically different ways. Homeric epic poetry takes as its\nstarting point a world that constitutes a closed totality\n(1916: 33), that is, a world in which life, culture, meaning, actions,\nand social institutions form a harmonious whole. In particular,\nLuk\u00e1cs claims that in Ancient Greece the \u201cessence\u201d\nof being was immanent to life rather than having to be sought out in a\ntranscendent realm. Furthermore, there was no gap between individual\nconsciousness and objectified meaning in the world that would have\nrequired the individual to project meaning onto the world. Individuals\nin Ancient Greece only had to accept the totality of meaning within\ntheir world, even if they were, in some particular situation or\nanother, unable to understand it. By contrast, modern society is\nconstitutively alienated: merely conventional social institutions\ndevoid of meaning are disconnected from individuals and their highly\nindividualized self-understandings. Therefore, in modern society\nmeaning can only be found within the inner life of the individual\n(1916: 61).\n\nStarting from this description of a closed totality, Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims that the intellectual history of the modern world was\nprefigured in the cultural history of Ancient Greece, in the movement\nfrom epic poetry to tragedy and then ultimately to philosophy. In the\ncourse of this movement, the sources of meaning became increasingly\nmore external to immediate life. As a consequence, Luk\u00e1cs\nargues that these three genres inhabit three different\n\u201ctranscendental loci\u201d (1916: 36). Tragedy and\nphilosophy reflect the loss of a meaningful totality, whereas the\npossibility of epic poetry depends on its immanence. As Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims, this is why \u201cart forms become subject to a\nhistorico-philosophical dialectic\u201d (1916: 39).\n\nThe cause of this development is a loss of totality through historical\nchanges that transform the objective institutions of social life into\nmere conventions and into a purely external \u201csecond\nnature\u201d (1916: 62f., 112). This alienation of the individual\nfrom the world leads to a situation of \u201ctranscendental\nhomelessness\u201d (1916: 40, 60) in which individuals must take up a\npurely normative \u201cshould be\u201d (1916: 47) stance toward the\nworld. The novel is always related to the development of such\nindividuals. This development can take the form of a\nsubjective-idealist illusion (e.g., as in Don Quixote) or of\na disillusion, that is, of individuals understanding the impossibility\nof finding meaning in the world. Luk\u00e1cs consequently argues\nthat the novel is the form of epic writing that is appropriate to a\nspecific moment in history. In modernity, epic writing no longer has a\ndistinct form that can express a particular relation between life and\nessence within a totality. Rather, the form of the novel is an attempt\nto deal with the absence of this relation (1916: 59; see Jameson 1971:\n172).\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s understanding of alienation as a historical loss of\ntotality and the consequent problem of form allows him to formulate\nthe kernel of a Utopian vision: the very form of the novel points to\nthe possibility of a renewed relation between the individual and the\nworld in which meaning can again be found. \n3. History and Class Consciousness\n\nNot only did Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s 1918 conversion to communism and his\nsubsequent engagement with philosophical Marxism confound his friends,\nbut even today\u2019s readers can find it difficult to track the many\nshifts in Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s theoretical commitments between 1918 and\n1923.\n\nIn the December 1918 article \u201cBolshevism as an Ethical\nProblem,\u201d Luk\u00e1cs draws a connection between his newfound\nMarxist convictions and his previous ethical views: whereas the\nhistorical necessity of class struggle is only a descriptive\nclaim in Marxism, the normative, ethical requirement to\nestablish a classless society must be separated from issues of truth\nand recognized as a utopian form of ethical idealism, appropriate for\nthe expression of a pure will. In 1918, Luk\u00e1cs still thought\nthat this insight led to a paradox: In order for the proletarian\n\u201cmessianic class\u201d (1918: 218) to overcome class society,\nit must first seize power by creating the most extreme form of class\ndominance, i.e., a dictatorship. Bolshevism thus presupposes that evil\nactions can produce good outcomes, or, as Luk\u00e1cs puts it in the\nessay \u201cTactics and Ethics,\u201d that tragedy cannot be avoided\nin revolutionary politics (1919a: 10). By the time History and\nClass Consciousness appeared, however, Luk\u00e1cs seems to\nhave thought of himself as having found another conception of\nrevolutionary action that paved the way for a new approach to\npolitical practice.\n3.1 Reification Theory\n\nAt the foundation of this new conception lies the theory of\nreification that Luk\u00e1cs introduces in the essay\n\u201cReification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat.\u201d\nThis essay is credited not only with being one of the foundational\ntexts of \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d (Anderson 1976), but also with\nspelling out the paradigmatic \u201ccentral problem\u201d\n(Brunkhorst 1998) of critical theory.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs frames his argument as an extension of Marx\u2019s analysis\nof the \u201cfetishism of the commodity form\u201d in Capital I\n(Marx [1867] 1992: 163\u2013176), where Marx refers to the fact\nthat social relations between producers of commodities appear in\ncapitalism under the guise of objective, calculable, properties of\nthings (\u201cvalue\u201d). \n\nWhile in Marx the form that social relations acquire due to this\nfetishism (i.e., a form that furnishes commodities with features that\nmake taking an instrumental, quantifying attitude towards\nthem\u2014and ultimately towards social relations\nthemselves\u2014appropriate) is analyzed mainly with regard to how it\ndistorts the relationship between subjects and their economic\ncircumstances, Luk\u00e1cs adopts a far more radical claim. The\ncommodity form, he argues, has gradually become the \u201cuniversal\ncategory of society as a whole\u201d (1923a: 86). In capitalist\nsocieties, the commodity form even becomes the dominant form of\nobjectivity itself (Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeitsform). Drawing\non debates in contemporary Neo-Kantian thought (see Lotz 2020:\n27\u201331; Feenberg 2017: 113; Kavoulakos 2018), Luk\u00e1cs\nremains committed to the Kantian idea that the condition of the\npossibility of synthesizing our experience into an experience of\nobjects depends on our having access to \u201cforms,\u201d which\nthus have a transcendental status. In contrast to Kant, however,\nLuk\u00e1cs understands these forms as both socially shared and\nhistorically variable. In capitalist societies in particular, the\ncommodity form thus becomes the transcendental determining factor of\nboth objectivity and subjectivity.\n\nBoth the objective and the subjective dimension of the emergence of\nthe commodity form are analyzed by Luk\u00e1cs as emerging from\nconcrete changes to the economic structure. On the objective side,\nwhen industrial work processes become rationalized as a result of\ntheir subsumption under the dominance of commodity exchange, these\nprocesses no longer display the typical \u201cunity\u201d of\nintentionally integrated human work. As each individual labor effort\ncan in principle constitute an input to many products, each operation\nis related to a \u201cset of heterogeneous use-values\u201d (1923a:\n89) and thus no longer forms part of a unique, unified work process.\nOn the subjective side, reification entails the fragmentation of human\nexperience, leading to an attitude of \u201ccontemplation\u201d in\nwhich one passively adapts to a law-like system of social\n\u201csecond nature\u201d and to an objectifying stance towards\none\u2019s own mental states and capacities.\n\nAs Luk\u00e1cs writes concerning the commodity form:\n\n[it] stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man; his\nqualities and abilities are no longer an organic part of his\npersonality, they are things which he can \u201cown\u201d or\n\u201cdispose of\u201d like the various objects of the external\nworld. And there is no natural form in which human relations can be\ncast, no way in which man can bring his physical and psychic\n\u201cqualities\u201d into play without their being subjected\nincreasingly to this reifying process. (1923a: 100)\n\nLuk\u00e1cs calls this development \u201creification.\u201d It is\na process that primarily affects the objective way in which human\nbeings relate to the totality of social relationships that is\nconstitutive of the meaning of their actions, separating this totality\n(and thus the meaning of their actions) from their self-understanding\nand establishing it as a form of objective reality. Derivatively, the\nsocially created features of objects (primarily their features as\ncommodities), relations between individual people, and their relations\nto themselves also acquire the character of a subject-independent,\nalien objectivity (Stahl 2011). The objective and subjective\ndimensions of the dominance of the commodity form constitute a complex\nof reification because the properties of objects, subjects, and social\nrelations become \u201cthing-like\u201d in this particular way.\nThese properties become independent, quantifiable, non-relational\nfeatures that must remain alien to any subjective meaning that one\ncould attach to them.\n\nWith this description of the way in which the dynamics of capitalist\nsociety affect not only people materially but the very form of\nobjectivity by which they can relate to the world, Luk\u00e1cs\ncombines Weber\u2019s theory of rationalization, Simmel\u2019s theory of\nmodern culture, and his own idea of a modern contradiction between\n\u201cform\u201d and \u201clife\u201d (see Dannemann 1987) with\nMarx\u2019s theory of value. The resulting theory of reification as a\nsocially induced pathology not only had considerable influence on the\nFrankfurt School (Stahl 2018; on Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s influence on\nAdorno, see Schiller 2011 and Braunstein/Duckheim 2015; on the\nengagement of the later generations of Frankfurt School criticism with\nLuk\u00e1cs, see Habermas 1984: 355\u2013365; Honneth 2008; cf.\nalso Chari 2010, Kavoulakos 2017) but also led Lucien Goldmann to\nspeculate that Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time should be read as\nan answer to Luk\u00e1cs (Goldmann 1977).\n\nThe theory of social rationalization on which Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s\nargument rests goes beyond a mere description of economic relations,\ntowards a theory of cultural change. The core of this argument is the\nclaim that the dominance of the commodity form in the economic sphere\nmust necessarily lead to the dominance of rational\ncalculation and formal reason in society as a whole and\nwill consequently involve a break with the organic unity and totality\nof previous forms of human existence. By forcing politics and law to\nadapt to the demands of capitalist exchange, the commodity form\ntransforms these spheres into a mode of rational calculability (a line\nof thought that clearly stems from Weber)\u2014which helps to explain\nthe rise of the bureaucratic state and the dominance of formal,\npositive law that continues to alienate individuals from society and\nencourages their passivity in the face of objectified, mechanical\nrules (1923a: 98).\n\nThis development leads to a contradictory situation on both the\npractical and the theoretical level: because the process of\nrationalization precludes grasping society as a totality, it cannot\never succeed in making society subject to rational calculation in its\nentirety, for it must exclude all irrational, qualitative dimensions\nfrom such calculation. Here, Luk\u00e1cs rephrases his earlier\nargument regarding the tension between form and life in Marxist terms\n(L\u00f3pez 2019: 72), as an inability of theories that express a reified\nperspective to grasp the concrete, material content of history. One\nexample, Luk\u00e1cs alleges, is the inability of economics as a\nscience to explain the movements of the economy (1923a:\n105\u2013107). The same holds for formalist models of law, which\ncannot theoretically acknowledge the interdependence of their\nprinciples and their social content and must therefore treat this\ncontent as an extra-legal, irrational foundation (1923a:\n107\u2013110).\n\nThis analysis of the social and cultural features of reification\nallows Luk\u00e1cs, in a third step, to present an analysis of the\n\u201cantinomies of bourgeois thought\u201d (1923a:\n110)\u2014defending the radical claim that the unsolved\nepistemological problems of the entirety of modern philosophy are\nrooted in its failure to break through capitalist reification. In\nattempting to achieve a rational system of principles, Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims, modern philosophy is always confronted with the issue of there\nbeing a \u201ccontent\u201d necessary for the application of its\nformal principles of knowledge, a content which cannot be integrated\ninto a formal philosophical system\u2014a prime example of which is\nKant\u2019s \u201cthing in itself\u201d (see Bernstein 1984:\n15\u201322). Kantian dualism is nothing other than the most\nself-conscious expression of this \u201chiatus\u201d between subject\n(the source of rational unity) and object (the source of non-rational\ncontent). This dualism between subject and object\u2014and, in\nethics, between norms and facts\u2014haunts modern philosophy. As\nFichte and Hegel partly recognize, Luk\u00e1cs argues, this problem\narises only because modern thought takes the contemplative subject of\nreified self-world relations as its paradigm, ignoring the alternative\nof an active subject that is engaged in the\nproduction of the content. Fichte\u2019s proposal to postulate\nan \u201cidentical subject-object\u201d (that is, a subject that\nproduces objectivity by positing objective reality as\ndistinct from itself) is also the key to Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 answer. But\nFichte\u2019s solution still suffers from an inadequacy in that he\nconceives of the constitutive activity still as the act of an\nindividual subject confronted with an external, alien reality (1923a:\n124).\n\nAn alternative is to be found in the idealist conception of art as an\nactivity directed at the creation of a meaningful totality and in\nSchiller\u2019s view of artistic activity, which is not an application of\nexternal, given laws but a form of play (1923a: 138). However, the\nconceptualization of practice from the standpoint of aesthetics\nobscures its historical dimension. Luk\u00e1cs acknowledges Hegel as\nthe thinker who came nearest to finding a solution to this problem by\nrecognizing that it is the totality of concrete history,\nunderstood as the expression of a subject, of a \u201cwe\u201d,\nwhich is the only standpoint from which the antinomies between form\nand content can be overcome (1923a: 146f.). But Hegel adopts a\nmythologizing view of this subjectivity in terms of a \u201cWorld\nSpirit\u201d that lies beyond any concrete historical agency. The\nsubject Hegel desperately tried to find could only be discovered by\nMarx\u2014it is the proletariat to which Luk\u00e1cs assigns the\nrole of the \u201csubject-object\u201d of history (1923a: 149).\n3.2 Standpoint Theory and Revolution\n\nIn the \u201cReification\u201d essay, Luk\u00e1cs is one of the\nfirst authors defending what has later come to be called a\n\u201cstandpoint theory\u201d and thereby has become an important\nforerunner especially of models in feminist epistemology (Jameson\n2009).\n\nIn particular, Luk\u00e1cs argues that the position of the\nproletariat is one of epistemic advantage concerning the acquisition\nof knowledge about society. Both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie\nare confronted, Luk\u00e1cs argues, with a reified social reality\n(1923a: 164). They will therefore form correct beliefs about this\nreality, but only insofar as they understand it in the form in which\nit is immediately (\u201cunvermittelt\u201d) given to them.\nThis is contrasted by Luk\u00e1cs to a different understanding which\nrealizes that the nature of all the individual elements of social\nreality is ultimately to be explained in terms of their role and\nrelationships within the totality of society, which is governed by the\ncommodity form as its structuring principle. Although the\n\u201cempiricist\u201d beliefs that are immediately accessible to\nall members of society are thus not strictly speaking false, they are\nincomplete, insofar as they are insufficient to comprehend the\nultimate nature of social phenomena, and they are misleading, insofar\nas theorists will tend, on the basis of these beliefs, to adopt\nfurther, false beliefs about that nature. Luk\u00e1cs emphatically\ndoes not state, however, that the proletariat, merely in virtue of its\nsocial position, has access to this superior understanding, but that\nthe proletariat is capable of achieving it. While the bourgeoisie must\nremain \u201cimprisoned within this immediacy\u201d (1923a, 147),\nthe proletariat is \u201cforced\u201d to go beyond it.\n\nWhich feature of the proletariat\u2019s existence gives rise to this\nadvantage is a matter of interpretive disagreement. While many later\nforms of feminist standpoint theories assume that social positions\ngive rise to epistemic opportunities in virtue of the distinctive\nexperiences they make available that are positively contributing to\nacquiring knowledge (see, for example, Jaggar 1983, 371, Smith 1974,\n7), other feminist authors, such as Hartsock (1983), draw on the idea\nthat the distinctive proletarian standpoint might be one that is\ncloser to use-value than exchange value, since workers have to\ninteract more directly with material objects, rather than just\nexchanging them. While some authors (such as Jameson 2009) also read\nLuk\u00e1cs as endorsing the claim that it is the distinctive\nexperience that members of the proletariat have which gives rise to a\nhigher probability of forming correct beliefs, more recent\ninterpretations (see Teixeira 2020, Feinberg 2020) emphasize that\nLuk\u00e1cs characterizes the experience of workers as identical to\nthat of members of the bourgeoisie. However, whereas the latter can\nintegrate that experience into a consistent self-understanding, in the\ncase of workers, the experience of society as something alien and\nobjective includes understanding themselves and their own activities.\nIn Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s words, the worker \u201cappears to himself\nimmediately as an object and not as the active part of the social\nprocess of labour\u201d (1923a, 167). The epistemic privilege of the\nproletariat is not rooted in the fact that this experience would make\nsome truth accessible to them, but rather in the fact that this\nnecessitates workers to acquire a \u201cbifurcated\nconsciousness\u201d of themselves as subject and as pure objects\nwhich is inconsistent and thus drives them beyond accepting reality as\nit appears immediately. Therefore, the distinctive epistemic position\nof the proletariat is not that it is uniquely situated in a way that\nis conducive to forming correct beliefs, but that it is uniquely\nsituated in a way that makes it increasingly difficult to continue to\nhold a set of true beliefs that restrict themselves to immediate\nappearances.\n\nThe epistemic possibility of gaining insight into the mediated nature\nof social phenomena, however, cannot be realized merely by individual\nproletarians revising their beliefs. Ultimately, the epistemically\nsuperior perspective is one in which the proletariat not merely\ndiscovers this nature, but also discovers itself, as the collective\nauthor of the structures of social reality. By realizing that it is\nthe \u201csubject-object of history\u201d, the proletariat discovers\nitself to be the subject of the process of social\nreproduction (see 1923a: 181; Jay 1984: 107f). As Luk\u00e1cs\nwrites, this \u201cact of consciousness overthrows the objective form\nof its object\u201d (1923a: 178). The proletariat can thus overcome\nreification only through a practical engagement with totality\u2014by\nconsciously transforming reality into the product of the\nproletariat\u2019s collective action\u2014which this totality in\nits essence has always already been. This process is, in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 mind, nothing other than the communist revolution. As\nmany critics of Luk\u00e1cs have remarked (Adorno 1973: 190f., Bewes\n2002; Jay 1984; Rose 2009), this seems to commit Luk\u00e1cs to the\nview that there can be a complete overcoming of reification resulting\nin a totally transparent society. However, this interpretation\ndownplays Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 insistence that the resistance against\nreification must be understood as a never-ending struggle (see 1923a:\n199, 206; Feenberg 2011; Feenberg 2014: 116; L\u00f3pez 2019).\n\nAs Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 essay on the \u201cProblem of Organisation\u201d\n(1923b, written shortly before the reification essay) shows, the\ndistinction between \u201cempirical\u201d and \u201cimputed\u201d\nclass consciousness had not entirely been resolved by the introduction\nof a dialectics of consciousness that is supposed to ground the\nspontaneous process that is to lead the proletariat beyond immediacy.\nNon-reified consciousness remains only an objective possibility,\nalways threatened by the seductions of the immediate consciousness.\n\n\nThis has political consequences, as it seems to establish that the\ncommunist party has the function of expressing and disciplining the\nalready achieved forms of consciousness. This does not lead\nLuk\u00e1cs to endorse the Leninist party conception, however,\nmainly because Lenin\u2019s vision of politics is incompatible with\nhis radical criticism of bureaucracy in the reification essay (Arato\nand Breines 1979: 154). In his political writings immediately\npreceding History and Class Consciousness, Luk\u00e1cs\nrather seems to endorse at different points either a qualified\nLuxemburgian view of proletarian spontaneity (for example in 1920b)\nor an elitist conception of party vanguardism (a \u201cparty\nmyth\u201d, Arato and Breines 1979: 145), not arriving at an overall\nconsistent position on this question.\n3.3 Methodology and Social Ontology in History and Class Consciousness\n\nIt is easy to see that the resulting conception of society that\nLuk\u00e1cs articulates owes as much to Hegel as to Marx. This\ninheritance commits Luk\u00e1cs to a number of methodological claims\nwhich put him into stark opposition not only to social democrats like\nEduard Bernstein but also, perhaps unintentionally, to the orthodoxy\nof the Soviet party.\n\nIn his essay \u201cWhat is Orthodox Marxism?\u201d (1919b),\nLuk\u00e1cs contrasts his method with social democratic economic\ndeterminism. He describes Marxism as a purely methodological\ncommitment to Marx\u2019s dialectics rather than as depending on any\nbelief regarding the truth of Marx\u2019s economic theory. In his essay\non Luxemburg, Luk\u00e1cs even goes so far as to claim that\n\u201cit is not the primacy of economic motives in historical\nexplanation that constitutes the decisive difference between Marxism\nand bourgeois thought, but the point of view of totality\u201d (1921:\n27).\n\nThis primacy of the social totality not only affects the Marxist\nmethod, but also the conception of practice and the underlying social\nontology: by insisting on a foundational role of practice in the\nsocial totality, Luk\u00e1cs makes political action rather than\nlabor into the foundation for overcoming reification (Feenberg 1998).\nWithin his social ontology, Luk\u00e1cs is finally committed to the\nclaim that the totality of historical processes, rather than\nindividual facts, are the foundation of objective reality (1923a: 184;\nfor the resulting view of history, see Merleau-Ponty 1973), leading\nhim to a rejection of all \u201ccontemplative\u201d epistemologies\n(such as Lenin\u2019s) which rely on the idea of a simple correspondence\nbetween thoughts and facts (1923a: 199ff; see also Lichtheim 1970:\n62\u201365; in addition, it follows from the premise that only the\nperspective of the social totality solves the epistemological problems\nof classical philosophy that Luk\u00e1cs must reject Engels\u2019 claim\nthat the experimental method is a model for the type of defetishizing\npraxis that can overcome the subject-object divide, see\n1923a: 131\u2013133). This ontology of pure processuality finally\nentails a normative conception of society that is critical towards all\nforms of institutional rationalization which are rejected as forms of\nalienation across the board. At the same time, in insisting that the\nemancipated society must be capable of presenting itself as a totality\nfor its subjects, Luk\u00e1cs is unable to discover any resources\nfor progress in the differentiation of social spheres (Arato and\nBreines 1979: 155).\n4. The later Luk\u00e1cs: Praxis, Totality, and Freedom\n4.1 The Critique of History and Class Consciousness\n\nBy many of those who were looking for a sophisticated Marxist\nphilosophy, History and Class Consciousness was judged to be\na supremely important book (as for example by Karl Korsch and Ernst\nBloch, see Bloch 1923). The party orthodoxy, was not quite so enamored\nwith Luk\u00e1cs, however. In Germany and Hungary, party\nintellectuals disapproved of the book because of its idealist\ntendencies, culminating in its condemnation by Grigory Zinoviev in his\nopening address to the June 1924 World Congress of the Third\nInternational (see Arato and Breines 1979: 180). Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s\nhastily composed study on Lenin (1924) ultimately resolved the tension\nbetween a Luxemburgian view of revolutionary politics as an expression\nof the spontaneity of the proletariat and a Leninist conception of the\nparty as a vanguard agent\u2014a tension that characterizes\nHistory and Class Consciousness (see Feenberg 1988)\u2014in\nfavor of the latter. This anticipated a theoretical development\ntowards a more traditional form of Marxism to which he subscribed for\nthe remainder of his life (see also the unpublished defense of\nHistory and Class Consciousness in 1925a and L\u00f6wy\n2011).\n\nWhile the condemnation of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s work by party\nintellectuals and Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s reaction may have been motivated\nby political expediency, the conception of society and of political\npractice contained in History and Class Consciousness had\nreal shortcomings. Jay (1984: 106\u2013115) argues that the idea of\nthe proletariat as the \u201csubject-object\u201d of history seems\nto entail a Fichtean conception of the self-constitutive capacities of\nthe revolutionary agent, unlimited by historical circumstances, and,\ncorrespondingly, of a self-constitutive practice that is hostile to\nall objectivity, an objection that is echoed by many of his more\nrecent interpreters (e.g., Rose 2009: 30\u20131; for a criticism of\nthis interpretation, see L\u00f3pez 2019: 134).\n\nThat the reification essay is characterized by a problematic\ninsistence that it is the very objectivity of social relations that is\nto be rejected is bolstered by Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s own evaluation in the\n1967 preface to the new edition of History and\nClass-Consciousness. Here, Luk\u00e1cs claims (alongside a\nnumber of exercises in self-criticism, which appear both unjustified\nand externally motivated) that his earlier arguments involved a\nconfusion between objectification (Vergegenst\u00e4ndlichung),\nexternalization (Ent\u00e4u\u00dferung), and alienation\n(Entfremdung). Luk\u00e1cs argues that Hegel was\nessentially correct to view objectification (that is, the fact that\nthe objects of our labor and the institutions of society are\nindependent of our consciousness) not as a deficiency but as a\nnecessary stage in the development of self-consciousness. Extending\nthis argument, he claims that the fact that social relationships\nappear external is not problematic in itself. Rather, it is\nalienation (the causes of which Marx uncovered) that should\nbe the object of the critique of reification: \u201cOnly when the\nobjectified forms in society acquire functions that bring the essence\nof man into conflict with his existence [\u2026]. This duality was not\nacknowledged in History and Class Consciousness\u201d (1967,\nxxiv; see also Pitkin 1987; see L\u00f3pez 2019 for an argument that this\nself-critique was unjustified). \n\nThe distinction between objectification and alienation entails i) the\npossibility of a critique of reification that does not require a\ncomplete reappropriation of objective social forms by a collective\nsubject and ii) a conception of political praxis that\nacknowledges the mutual dialectical dependence of subject and object\n(an insight that, according to Feenberg 2014 and L\u00f3pez 2019, is\nalready present in History and Class Consciousness).\n4.2 Re-reading the Philosophical Tradition: Hegel and the Struggle against \u201cIrrationalism\u201d\n\nThese problems motivated Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s turn to another model of\npractice\u2014a model of political and social practice that he\nattempted to work out up until the end of his life. While the critique\nof Fichteanism in his writings between 1923 and 1928\u2014for example\nin his review of an edition of Lasalle\u2019s letters (1925b) and in a\npiece on Moses Hess (1926)\u2014constituted a significant step\ntowards such a model, it was impossible for him to write anything\ncontroversial on contemporary Marxism after the hostile reception of\nhis 1928 \u201cBlum Theses.\u201d Instead, he tackled the\nphilosophical foundations of these problems in the context of a new\nreading of the philosophical tradition, especially of Hegel.\n\nIn the reification essay, Luk\u00e1cs describes Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nas the only \u201cbourgeois\u201d theory of history and freedom that\ncomes close to solving the problem of reification due to its insight\nthat the abyss between subject and object can only be overcome by\nseeing both as elements within a process that actively produces the\nvery distinction between them. Thus, Luk\u00e1cs remains committed\nto the claim that Marxist social theory must be read as a critical\ncompletion\u2014rather than a rejection\u2014of Hegel. This means,\nhowever, that he must show that the Hegelian idealist metaphysics that\nMarx rejects does not exhaust Hegel\u2019s philosophy. His writings on\nHegel, most prominently The Young Hegel (1948) and the\nrelevant sections of the Ontology of Social Being, can be\nread as a defense of this commitment. In the former work,\nLuk\u00e1cs argues that Hegel\u2019s development of dialectics was\ninformed by his reading of the British economists Steuart and Smith.\nAccording to Luk\u00e1cs, this empirical grounding enabled Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics to draw on the idea of objective, social-historical\nprogress and to understand modern society and economy as a processual\ntotality that is structured by contradictions. Hegel\u2019s view of an\nontological dialectics must therefore be read as reflecting the\nstructure of objective social reality. The resulting\n\u201cobjectivism\u201d allowed Hegel to avoid the subjectivist\nconception of dialectics to which (as Luk\u00e1cs alleges) Kant and\nFichte still subscribed. Hegel, however, subordinated this objectivist\nontology to logic in the course of the development of his system. It\nis this \u201clogicism,\u201d i.e., the primacy of categories over\nbeing, that led Hegel to postulate the idealist conception of the\n\u201csubject-object\u201d that is needed to explain the identity of\nlogical categories and ontological determinations. This split between\na \u201cgenuine\u201d dialectics that reflects the objective\ncontradictions of society (even if in an idealist manner) and a\n\u201clogicist\u201d system is the main argument in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s discussion of Hegel in the Ontology (see\nGW 13: 489f., 506, 520\u2013523).\n\nA second, much more problematic set of commitments was made explicit\nin Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s writings between the 1930s and the 1950s. This\nconcerns his conviction that, after Hegel, modern thought had become\nsharply divided into two opposing tendencies: \u201cMarxist\ndialectics\u201d and \u201cbourgeois irrationalism.\u201d\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s view that virtually all non-Marxist theorists after\nHegel\u2014including Schelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and\nHeidegger\u2014can be subsumed under the label of irrationalism (a\nblanket term which, depending on the context, refers to everything\nfrom theories of \u201cintellectual intuition,\u201d ontological\nsubjectivism, and \u201caristocratic\u201d epistemological positions\nto the denial of progress in history) was perhaps motivated by an\nearnest desire to apply the method of immanent critique (see Aronowitz\n2005) to developments within philosophy that had facilitated the rise\nof National Socialism. Some of his arguments against Heidegger also\nresemble Adorno\u2019s critique (see also Adorno 1997). Overall, however,\nhis philosophical arguments for the simplistic distinction between\nprogressive materialism and irrationalism\u2014in particular those\nthat he presents in The Destruction of Reason (according to\nGeorge Lichtheim, \u201cthe worst book he ever wrote\u201d;\nLichtheim 1970: 68)\u2014are dogmatic and superficial. A number of\nparticularly problematic claims are made in the postscript to the\nDestruction, where Luk\u00e1cs not only defends the Soviet\nUnion under Stalin but also accuses Bertrand Russell of being secretly\nreligious (1954: 808) and Wittgenstein and the pragmatists of being\nproponents of a form of subjectivism that had facilitated the rise of\na new form of fascism (1954: 782ff.; for other examples, see the\nunpublished 1933a).\n4.3 The Ontology of Social Being\n\nThe most fundamental level on which Luk\u00e1cs develops his revised\nmodel of Hegelian Marxism is that of ontology, or, more specifically,\nan \u201contology of social being.\u201d Luk\u00e1cs claims that,\nas far as ontology is concerned, we can distinguish three levels of\nbeing in the world: material or inorganic being, organic life, and\nsocial reality (GW 13: 22). All three levels are\ndistinguished by a division between the genuine essence of entities\nand their appearance. While on all three levels entities appear as\nfixed objects, their real essence is always that of interrelated,\nirreversible processes (GW 13: 240). This entails that the\nbasic form of all being is temporality and historicity\n(GW 13: 228). \n\nWhile this general ontology remains underdeveloped and is not informed\nby much knowledge of concurrent philosophical developments,\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s theory of social reality has contemporary relevance.\nSocial reality, Luk\u00e1cs claims, differs from the other levels of\nreality not only insofar as it is governed by causal, non-teleological\nlaws but also insofar as it contains an element of teleology\nas a result of \u201cteleological positing\u201d (GW 13:\n20; 1971c: 12ff.). Due to their ability to perform labor, humans can\n\u201cposit\u201d functions or goals that are to govern the natural,\ncausal processes they manipulate. By choosing one of the potential\nresults of the employment of their natural and technological\ncapacities as the correct one, individuals can draw a distinction\nbetween successful and unsuccessful executions of their intended\nactions in labor. This, Luk\u00e1cs argues, introduces normative\ndistinctions or values into the world (see 1971b: 75f and\n153\u2013156; 1968: 140). In particular, Luk\u00e1cs claims that\nthe objectification of human intentions in institutions enables us to\nunderstand the existence of objective values as products of\nsocial-historical developments without sliding into historical\nrelativism. However, as some of his own students noted, this\nexplanation remains too unclear to solve the problem of normativity\nfor Marxism (see Feh\u00e9r et al., 1976). The same doubts remain with\nregard to Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s further claim that there is one\nfundamental, immanent value of social history, namely the unfettered\ndevelopment of human capacities (GW 14: 153).\n\nBecause Luk\u00e1cs sees the process of labor as the foundation of\nall social and normative phenomena (see also 1971c: 65; Thompson\n2011), the totality of society can be described as the totality of all\nrelations between the teleological acts of \u201cpositing\u201d\nconditions of success in labor. However, even though Luk\u00e1cs\nthus acknowledges intentional consciousness as an irreducible factor\nin these acts (see Luk\u00e1cs 1968: 138), their meaning is\nultimately determined by the objective, historical development of\nsocial relations. \n\nFrom these ontological commitments it follows that intentionality,\nwhich guides individual acts of labor, is a condition for the\nexistence of the totality of social facts, and vice versa\n(see Tertullian 1988). In particular, he describes language and\ninstitutions as media of \u201cindirect\u201d teleological positing\nbecause they enable forms of action that do not directly modify nature\nbut that indirectly aspire to bring others to do so (GW 14:\n172; 1968: 142). Although he remains committed to the primacy of\nlabor, Luk\u00e1cs allows that these linguistic and institutional\nmediations acquire a dynamic of their own over time, becoming\nindependent of the goal of dominating nature, in particular because\nthey allow for a generalization of the cognitive grasping of\nparticular phenomena (see GW 13: 47; GW 14: 165ff,\n342\u2013357) and for greater distance between subject and object\n(1971c: 100).\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s conception of individuality as a product of the\nchoice between alternatives within a socially determined totality\nultimately led to a theory of alienation that partially\nreplaced the theory of reification of his younger years. Whereas the\nlatter theory was closely connected to the ideal of the collective\nreappropriation of society, Luk\u00e1cs describes alienation in the\nOntology as primarily the result of social conditions that\nturn individuals into merely \u201cparticular\u201d\npersonalities (GW 14: 530) instead of allowing them to\ndevelop their capacities to the degree that the present development of\nproductive forces could make possible. This means that alienation (for\ninstance the alienation brought about by excessive professional\nspecialization) must be understood as the socially induced incapacity\nof individuals to participate in \u201cspecies being\u201d or the\nsocial totality. The overcoming of alienation thus always\ndemands\u2014along with social changes\u2014subjective\ntransformation, i.e., individual change (GW 14: 551). This\npoints towards the ethical dimension of the\nOntology. Luk\u00e1cs claims that there is a normative\nideal immanent in society as such, namely, the ideal of social\nrelations that allow all to fully participate in the social totality\nwith their whole personality, thereby realizing their universal\nnature. This suggests a conception of political praxis that\namounts to a form of democratic politics.\n4.4 Aesthetics: Realism and the Work of Art as a Closed Totality\n\nWhile Luk\u00e1cs made his ontological commitments explicit only\ntowards the end of his life, they informed the development of his\naesthetics from the 1930s on. From the general materialist premises of\nhis ontology and from his rejection of the epistemology of History\nand Class Consciousness in favor of the Leninist alternative (see\n1938), it follows that cultural and mental phenomena must always be\nseen as reflections (or \u201cmirroring,\u201d\nWiderspiegelungen) of an objective reality (GW 11:\n22, 55).\n\nLike science and ethics, art breaks with the immediacy of our everyday\npractical engagements that dominates more common forms of reflection\n(GW 11: 207, 214). Yet aesthetic reflections on reality\ndiffer from science (or more generally from conceptual and theoretical\nreflections) in three respects: First, while scientific knowledge\npresupposes the \u201cdeanthropomorphization\u201d of the subject\nmatter (meaning that reality is presented as independent of human\ndesires or subjectivity), the aesthetic subject matter remains\nanthropomorphized insofar as art presents reality in the form of inner\nexperience. Thus, aesthetic representation always remains connected to\na possible \u201cevocation\u201d of a human subject\u2019s reactions\n(GW 11: 438). Second, while science is always conceptually\nmediated, art breaks with the immediacy of everyday life in favor of a\nnew immediacy of experience (GW 11: 237, 509, 513). And\nthird, while science reflects reality in the form of general laws,\naesthetic representation is always bound to represent universal\naspects of the essence of reality in the form of the individuality (or\nspecificity) of the work of art (Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s term for\nindividuality is Besonderheit, a concept which he takes from\nHegel\u2019s Science of Logic, where it describes the\ndialectical sublation of both generality and particularity within the\n\u201cnotion\u201d).\n\nAccording to this conception of art as a mode of reflection, the\nfunction of a work of art is to present humans with the totality of\nthe objective, historical reality within an \u201chomogeneous\nmedium\u201d (such as pure visibility in painting or poetic language\nin poetry; see GW 11: 642). The employment of such a medium\nmakes it possible for art to single out and represent the universal\naspects of a given form of human reality as a \u201cclosed\nworld-in-itself\u201d or as an \u201cintensive totality\u201d\n(GW 11: 238, 461, 774; GW 12: 232). As Luk\u00e1cs\nargues (GW 11: 660), the medium of each specific form of art\nestablishes strict laws that allow the work of art to adequately\npresent the world of humanity from a specific standpoint. For this\nreason, such works of art allow us to comprehend the universal aspects\nof our existence and to consciously participate in the collective life\nof humanity (GW 11: 519\u2013530). Luk\u00e1cs describes\nthis effect as \u201cdefetishization\u201d (GW 11: ch. 9),\nanticipating the ethical call to overcome alienation formulated in the\nOntology. A successful work of art can thus have the effect\nof \u201ccatharsis\u201d (GW 11: 811), transforming the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d of everyday life (the person who is\nentangled in their diverse relationships) into a \u201cperson as a\nwhole\u201d (the person who realizes their humanity by acquiring a\nsense of self-consciousness regarding the richness of the human\nrelations that constitute the historical development of\nhumankind).\n\nEven though they represent objective reality, works of art are, in\nvirtue of this mode of reflection, subject-dependent because their\ncharacter is constituted by their capacity to evoke a subjective\nreaction: i.e., an understanding of how and why the world revealed in\nart is appropriate to the comprehending subject in its universal\nnature (GW 11: 305). This reaction is not only one of passive\nacknowledgment; it also actively transforms the subject by\nfacilitating consciousness of that very universal nature. Thus, in the\nwork of art, subjectivity and objectivity are mutually constitutive of\neach other. In a transformed sense\u2014as Luk\u00e1cs explicitly\nacknowledges (GW 11: 582; GW 12: 217)\u2014the\nsubject-object of idealism is an appropriate concept for works of art\n(which, one might add, fulfills Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s aspirations for the\nsocialist revolution he had to renounce, both politically and\nphilosophically). Of course, in this new sense the term\n\u201csubject-object\u201d no longer signifies a privileged agent\nbecoming self-conscious, but only the interdependence of subjectivity\nand objectivity in a specific sphere of experience.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs makes a similar conceptual move by endorsing the claim\nthat all consciousness is a reflection of reality. On the one hand,\nthis signals a revision of the epistemological position he defended in\nHistory and Class Consciousness (where he criticized the\ndistinction between a seemingly objective reality and purely\nsubjective forms of perception) in favor of Lenin\u2019s theory of\nconsciousness. On the other hand, Luk\u00e1cs is keen to make\nroom\u2014at least within the boundaries of the aesthetic\u2014for\nthe idea that some insights can be had only in relation to a totality\nthat encompasses subjectivity and objectivity.\n\nAt this point, Luk\u00e1cs no longer derives his aesthetic\ncommitments from purely philosophical premises\u2014as he did in his\nearly Heidelberg writings\u2014instead building on anthropological\npremises (especially concerning the concept of everyday life, in\nregard to which he notes the similarity between his analysis and\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of practical engagement; see GW 11:\n68\u201371; for related points on the Ontology see Jo\u00f3s\n1982), psychological theorizing (proposing an extension of Pavlov\u2019s\nbehaviorist classification of signal systems; see GW 12:\n11\u2013191), and a speculative notion of world history. The most\nimportant concept binding these premises together is the idea of\nmimesis. Mimetic behavior, Luk\u00e1cs argues, is a\nfundamental way of coping with the world and a source of both magic\nand art. Through the mimetic imitation of natural processes, humans\nacquire the ability to represent the salient aspects of the world in a\nclosed and totalizing manner, gradually learning to separate such\nimitations from the necessity of immediate reaction. In contrast to\nmagic, which does not separate reflection and objective causation,\nmimesis in art is consciously taken as reflection and has an aesthetic\neffect on its audience specifically in virtue of this feature\n(GW 11: 382). In other words, while both art and science\novercome the superstition of magic, only art can retain the mimetic\ndimension of representation.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s commitment to a conception of the work of art as a\nclosed totality structured by the strict laws of its medium and\nobjectively reflecting the development of humanity in the mode of\nmimetic evocation had considerable implications for his own judgments\nas an aesthetic theorist. His writings on literary realism published\nfrom the 1930s to the 1950s\u2014especially \u201cRealism in the\nBalance\u201d (1938), The Historical Novel (1955), and\nThe Meaning of Contemporary Realism (1955)\u2014display to\nvarious degrees a mixture of philosophical insight and Stalinist\northodoxy. In any case, they are animated by a strong commitment to\nthe superiority of realism, as exemplified by Balzac, Tolstoy, Gorky\n(see GW 5), and Thomas Mann (see 1949), which he contrasts\nwith the \u201cdecadent\u201d avant-garde literature of his time.\nThis position drew sharp criticism, for example from Seghers, Brecht,\nand Adorno (see Luk\u00e1cs 1981; Brecht 1977; Adorno [1958] 1977;\non the Luk\u00e1cs-Brecht debate, see Pike 1985).\n\nHowever, to the extent that Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s commitment to realism\nreflects a commitment to the notion that works of art should present a\ntotality of meaning that is not alien to the life of individuals but\nrather overcomes the alienation they suffer in everyday life, it\nexpresses (even in its most distorted versions) an intuition that\nsustained his work from the beginning: a desire to overcome the\ntension between human life and the objective social forms that\nconstitute modern society.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Biographies", "Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources and Selected Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Biographies": "</h3>\n<p>\nThe only English-language biography of Luk\u00e1cs is Kadarkay, A.,\n1991, <em>Georg Luk\u00e1cs.
