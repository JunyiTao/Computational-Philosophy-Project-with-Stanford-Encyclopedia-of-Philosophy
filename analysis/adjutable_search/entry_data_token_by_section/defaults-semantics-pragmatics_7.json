    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Types of Defaults in Default Semantics\n1.8 Types of Defaults in Default Semantics\n\nOne of the main questions to ask about any theory of utterance\ninterpretation is what sources information about meaning comes from.\nIn Default Semantics, (Jaszczolt, e.g., 2009, 2010, 2016a, 2021),\nutterance meaning is the outcome of merging of information that comes\nfrom five sources: (i) word meaning and sentence structure (WS); (ii)\nsituation of discourse (SD); (iii) properties of human inferential\nsystem (IS); (iv) stereotypes and presumptions about society and\nculture (SC); and world knowledge (WK). WS is the output of the\nsyntactic processing of the sentence, or its logical form. SD stands\nfor the broadly understood context in which the discourse is immersed.\nIS pertains to properties of mental states which trigger certain types\nof interpretations. For example, the property of intentionality\nensures that we normally use referring expressions with a referential\nintention that is the strongest for the given context. SC pertains to\nthe background knowledge of societal norms and customs and cultural\nheritage. WK encompasses information about physical laws, nature,\nenvironment, etc. It is important to stress that the four sources that\naccompany WS do not merely enrich the output of the latter. All of the\nsources are equally powerful and can override each other\u2019s\noutput. This constitutes a substantial breakaway from the established\nboundary between explicit and implicit content.\n\nThe identification of the sources also allows us to propose a\nprocessing model in Default Semantics in which three types of\ncontribution to utterance interpretation are distinguished: (i)\nprocessing of the sentence (called combination of word meaning and\nsentence structure, WS); (ii) conscious pragmatic inference (CPI) from\nthree of the sources distinguished above: SD, SC, and WK; and (iii)\ntwo kinds of default, automatic meanings: cognitive defaults (CD)\ntriggered by the source IS, and social, cultural and world-knowledge\ndefaults (SCWD).\n\nThe primary meaning is arrived at through the interaction of these\nprocesses and therefore need not bear close resemblance to the logical\nform of the sentence; the output of WS can vary in significance as\ncompared with the output of other types of processes. For example, to\nborrow Bach\u2019s (1994) scenario, let us imagine little Johnny\ncutting his finger and crying, to which his mother reacts by uttering\n(12a).\n\n(12a)You are not going to die.\n\nThe what is said/explicature of (12a) is something to the\neffect of (12b). There may also be other communicated meanings but\nthose fall in the domain of implicatures.\n\n(12b)You are not going to die from this cut.\n\nIn Default Semantics, the primary content of an utterance is its most\nsalient meaning. This is so even when this meaning does not bear any\nresemblance to the logical form derived from the syntactic structure\nof the uttered sentence. In other words, CPI can override WS and\nproduce, say, (12c) as utterance meaning (called  primary\nmeaning, represented in a merger representation) for the\ngiven context. The explicit content of the utterance need not be even\npartially isomorphic with the meaning of the uttered sentence: it need\nnot amount to the development of the sentence\u2019s logical\nform.\n\n(12c)There is nothing to worry about.\n\nCDs and SCWDs are default interpretations. Similar to Recanati\u2019s\nautomatic free enrichment, these default meanings cut across\nGrice\u2019s GCI/PCI divide. Some of them arise due to the properties\nof words or constructions used and are present by default\nindependently of the context of the utterance, while others are\ndefault meanings for the particular situation of discourse. CDs are\ndefault interpretations that are triggered by the properties of mental\nstates. For example, when speakers use a definite description in an\nutterance, they normally use it referentially (about a particular,\nknown, intersubjectively recognisable individual) rather than\nattributively (about whoever fits the description). This default\nreferential use can be given a functional as well as a cognitive\nexplanation. Firstly, it can be explained in terms of the strength of\nthe referential intention associated with the act of utterance:\nceteris paribus, humans provide the strongest information relevant and\navailable to them. At the same time, in cognitive terms, it can be\nexplained through the property of mental states that underlie the\nspeaker\u2019s speech act: this is the property of\nintentionality or aboutness, in the sense in which\nthe mental state is about a particular object, be it a person, thing,\nor situation. Like the strongest referring, so the strongest\naboutness, is the norm, the default. For example, the description\n\u2018the architect who designed St Paul\u2019s cathedral\u2019 in\n(13a) is likely to be interpreted as \u2018Christopher Wren\u2019,\nas in (13b).\n\n(13a)The architect who designed St Paul\u2019s cathedral was a\n    genius.\n(13b)Sir Christopher Wren was a genius.\n\nNext, SCWDs are default interpretations that arise due to the shared\ncultural and social background of the interlocutors. To use a well\nworn example, in (14a), it is the shared presumption that babies are\nraised by their own mothers that allows the addressee to arrive at\n(14b).\n\n(14a)The baby cried and the mother picked it up.\n(14b)The baby cried and the baby\u2019s mother picked it up.\n\nIn CDs and SCWDs, no conscious inference is involved. The natural\nconcomitant of reducing the role of the logical form (WS) to one of\nfour equally potent constituents of utterance meaning is a revised\nview of compositionality. The compositional nature of meaning is\nretained as a methodological assumption but this compositionality is\nnow sought at the level of the merger of information from the five\nsources, arrived at through the interaction of the four identified\nprocesses. The output of these processes is called merger\nrepresentation and is expected to be a compositional structure.\nCurrent research focuses of providing an algorithm for the interaction\nof the output of the identified processes.\n",
