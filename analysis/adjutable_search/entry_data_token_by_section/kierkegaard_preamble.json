Stephen Evans replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.] \n\n\nS\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) was an astonishingly\nprolific writer whose work\u2014almost all of which was written in\nthe 1840s\u2014is difficult to categorize, spanning philosophy,\ntheology, religious and devotional writing, literary criticism,\npsychology and social critique. Kierkegaard\u2019s mode of\nphilosophizing opposes system-building and owes more in its approach\nto the ancients, particularly his hero Socrates, though his work also\ndraws strongly and creatively on the Bible and other Christian\nsources. The opposition to system-building means that Kierkegaard has\noften been understood as an arch opponent of Hegel, but scholarship in\nrecent decades has challenged and complicated this view, suggesting\nboth that some of Kierkegaard\u2019s central ideas are creative\ndevelopments of Hegel\u2019s ideas, and that the main target of his\ncritique is certain Danish Hegelians influential in his day, rather\nthan Hegel himself (see especially Stewart 2003 and\n section 4\n below). Also often dubbed the \u201cfather of existentialism\u201d,\nthis label obscures at least as much as it reveals, especially to\nthose who associate existentialism with atheistic figures such as\nSartre. Kierkegaard\u2019s thought has certainly influenced thinkers\nin the phenomenological and existential traditions (including\nHeidegger, Sartre, Jaspers, Marcel, and L\u00e9vinas), but also\nthinkers in very different philosophical traditions, such as\nWittgenstein (who famously described him as a \u201csaint\u201d and\n\u201cby far the most profound thinker\u201d of the nineteenth\ncentury). In addition to influencing philosophers and\ntheologians\u2014inside and outside his own Lutheran\ntradition\u2014Kierkegaard\u2019s thought has also influenced\nvarious novelists and poets (including Henrik Ibsen, Franz Kafka,\nMiguel de Unamuno, August Strindberg, W. H. Auden, Walker Percy, John\nUpdike, Richard Wright, R. S. Thomas, and Haven Kimmel); artists and\nfilmmakers (including Edvard Munch and Carl Theodor Dreyer);\npsychiatrists and psychotherapists (including Ludwig Binswanger, Carl\nRogers, Rollo May, R. D. Laing, and Irvin Yalom). (For articles on\nseveral of these influences in philosophy, theology and literature,\nsee Carlisle 2013, Welz 2013, Shakespeare 2013, Rudd 2013, Lippitt\n2013b, Barrett 2013, Lisi 2013, and Pyper 2013.) One reason why\nKierkegaard has had an impact upon such a diversity of figures is his\nfocus on the question of what it means to be an existing, finite human\nbeing, a concern he associates with \u201cinwardness\u201d, and\nwhich contrasts with what he takes to be the misguided idea that one\ncan understand reality in a disengaged manner and from no particular\npoint of view. He believed that his age had in various ways forgotten\nthis fundamental truth, an enormous failing manifested in both its\nphilosophy and its theology.\n",
