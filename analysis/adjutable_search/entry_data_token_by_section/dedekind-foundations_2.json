But further reflection on Dedekind\u2019s procedure (and similar\nones) leads to a new question: What is involved in it if thought\nthrough fully, i.e., what does this account of the real numbers rely\non ultimately? As noted, Dedekind starts with the system of rational\nnumbers; he uses a set-theoretic procedure to construct, in a central\nstep, the new system of cuts out of them; and finally, the real\nnumbers are \u201ccreated\u201d on that basis. This suggests three\nsub-questions: First, how exactly are we to think about the rational\nnumbers in this connection? Second, can anything further be said about\nthe set-theoretic procedures that have been used? And third, how is\nthe creation at issue to be understood?\n\nIn his published writings, Dedekind does not provide an explicit\nanswer to our first sub-question. What suggests itself from a\ncontemporary point of view is that he relied on the assumption that\nthe rational numbers can be dealt with in terms of the natural numbers\ntogether with some set-theoretic techniques. And in fact, in\nDedekind\u2019s Nachlass explicit sketches of two now familiar\nconstructions can be found: that of the integers as (equivalence\nclasses of) pairs of natural numbers; and that of the rational numbers\nas (equivalence classes of) pairs of integers (Sieg & Schlimm\n2005, earlier Dugac 1976). It seems that these constructions were\nfamiliar enough at the time for Dedekind not to feel the need to\npublish his sketches. (There is also a direct parallel to the\nconstruction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers, known to\nDedekind from W.R. Hamilton\u2019s works, and a more general connection to\nthe use of residue classes in developing modular arithmetic. For the\nformer cf. Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, ch. 7, for the latter Dedekind 1857\nand Dugac 1976.)\n\nAll the material needed for analysis, including both the rational and\nall the real numbers, can thus be constructed out of the natural\nnumbers by set-theoretic means. At this point the question arises: Do\nwe have to take the natural numbers themselves as given; or can\nanything further be said about those numbers, perhaps by reducing them\nto something even more fundamental? Many mathematicians in the\nnineteenth century were willing to assume the former. A well-known\nexample is Leopold Kronecker, for whom the natural numbers are\n\u201cgiven by God\u201d while the rest of arithmetic and analysis\nis \u201cmade by mankind\u201d (Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, ch. 4). In\ncontrast Dedekind, and independently Frege, pursued the latter option:\nthey attempted to reduce arithmetic and the natural numbers to\n\u201clogic\u201d. This is the main goal of Was sind und was\nsollen die Zahlen? (The Nature and Meaning of Numbers,\nor more literally, What are the numbers and what are they\nfor?). Another goal is to answer the related second sub-question\nabove: whether more can be said about the set-theoretic procedures\nused. For Dedekind, again similar to Frege, those procedures are part\nof logic. Along the way, Dedekind also attempts to clarify his notion\nof creation. But then, what are the basic notions of\nlogic?\n\nDedekind\u2019s answer to this last question is: Basic for logic are the\nnotions of object (\u201cDing\u201d), set (or system,\n\u201cSystem\u201d), and function (mapping,\n\u201cAbbildung\u201d). \nThese notions are fundamental for human\nthought, as he emphasizes especially for the notion of function. They\nare \u201clogical\u201d \nin the sense of being applicable in all\ndomains, indispensable for exact reasoning, and not reducible further.\n(This interpretation of Dedekind, and with it whether he should\nbe understood as a logicist, is not uncontroversial. For the\ncorresponding controversy, cf. Klev 2017, Reck 2019, and\nFerreir\u00f3s forthcoming, on the one hand, and Benis-Sinaceur\n2008, 2015, 2017, on the other hand. We will come back to this issue\nin Section 3.) While not analyzable in terms of anything even more\nbasic, the fundamental logical notions are nevertheless capable of\nbeing elucidated, thus of being understood better. Part of their\nelucidation consists in observing what can be done with them,\nincluding how arithmetic can be reconstructed in terms of them (also\nanalysis etc.). For Dedekind that reconstruction starts with the\nconsideration of infinite sets, like in the case of the real numbers,\nbut now in a generalized, more explicit, and more systematic\nmanner.\n\nDedekind does not just assume, or simply postulate, the existence of\ninfinite sets; he tries to prove it. For that purpose, he considers\n\u201cthe totality of all things that can be objects of my\nthought\u201d and argues that this \u201cset\u201d is infinite\n(Dedekind 1888a, section v). He also does not just presuppose the\nconcept of infinity; he defines it (in terms of his three basic\nnotions of logic, as well as the definable notions of subset, union,\nintersection, etc.). The definition is as follows: A set of objects is\ninfinite\u2014\u201cDedekind-infinite\u201d, as we now say\u2014if\nit can be mapped one-to-one onto a proper subset of itself. (A set can\nthen be defined to be finite if it is not infinite in this sense.)\nMoving a step closer to arithmetic, this leads to the notion of a\n\u201csimple infinity\u201d (or \u201cinductive set\u201d). A\nrigorous introduction of that notion involves Dedekind\u2019s innovative\nidea of a \u201cchain\u201d. As one would say in contemporary\nterminology, a chain is the minimal closure of a set A in a\nset B containing A under a function f on\nB (where being \u201cminimal\u201d is captured of in terms\nof the general notion of intersection).\n\nWhat it means to be simply infinite can now be captured in four\nconditions: Consider a set S and a subset N of\nS (possibly equal to S). N is called simply\ninfinite if there exists a function f on S and an\nelement 1 of N such that: (i) f maps N into\nitself; (ii) N is the chain (minimal closure) of \\(\\{1\\}\\) in\nS under \\(\\,f\\); (iii) 1 is not in the image of N\nunder \\(f\\); and (iv) \\(f\\) is one-to-one. While at first unfamiliar,\nit is not hard to see that these Dedekindian conditions are a\nnotational variant of Peano\u2019s well-known axioms for the natural\nnumbers. In particular, condition (ii) is a version of the axiom of\nmathematical induction. These axioms are thus properly called the\nDedekind-Peano axioms. (Peano, who published his corresponding work in\n1889, acknowledged Dedekind\u2019s priority; cf. Ferreir\u00f3s 2005.) As\nis also not hard to see, any simple infinity will consist of a first\nelement corresponding to 1, a second element corresponding to\n\\(f(1)\\), a third corresponding to \\(f(f(1))\\), and so on, just like\nany model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms.\n\nGiven these preparations, Dedekind introduces the natural numbers as\nfollows: First, he proves that every infinite set contains a simply\ninfinite subset. Then he establishes that any two simply infinite\nsystems (any two models of the Dedekind-Peano axioms) are isomorphic\n(so that the axiom system is categorical). Third, he observes that, as\na consequence, exactly the same arithmetic truths hold for all simple\ninfinities; or closer to Dedekind\u2019s actual way of stating this point,\nany truth about one of them can be translated, via the isomorphism,\ninto a truth about the other. (That is to say, all models of the\nDedekind-Peano axioms are \u201clogically \nequivalent\u201d, which\nmeans that the axiom system is \u201csemantically \ncomplete\u201d;\ncf. Awodey & Reck 2002). In those respects, \neach simply infinity\nis as good as any other.\n\nAs a further step, Dedekind appeals again to the notion of\n\u201ccreation\u201d. \nStarting with some simple infinity constructed\ninitially\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter which one we start with, given their\nisomorphism\u2014he \u201ccreates\u201d new objects corresponding\nto its elements, thereby introducing a distinguished simple infinity\nDedekind calls \u201cthe natural \nnumbers\u201d. \nAs we saw, this last\nstep is parallel to his introduction of \u201cthe real \nnumbers\u201d\n(a parallel confirmed in Dedekind 1888b); but some aspects are clearer in the\npresent case. Namely, the newly created objects are characterized\ncompletely by all arithmetic truths, i.e., by those truths\ntransferable, or invariant, in the sense explained above. In other\nwords, their identity depends on relational or structural\nproperties alone, unlike for the elements of other simple infinities\nwhere intrinsic, non-arithmetic, or \n\u201cforeign\u201d properties\nare built in. In passing, Dedekind also uses the name\n\u201cabstraction\u201d \nfor the step from the initially constructed\nsimple infinity to the newly introduced one. (If Dedekind is\ninterpreted along such lines, his position is a form of\nnon-eliminative structuralism; cf. Reck 2003; but see Sieg &\nMorris 2018 and Benis-Sinaceur 2008, 2015, 2017, respectively, for two\nalternative interpretations. We will again come back to this issue in\nSection 3.)\n\nConsidered more generally, what Dedekind has introduced is the natural\nnumbers conceived of as finite \u201cordinal\u201d numbers (or\ncounting numbers: the first, the second, etc.). Later he adds an\nexplanation of how their usual employment as finite\n\u201ccardinal\u201d numbers (answering to the question: how many?)\ncan be recovered. This is done by using initial segments of the number\nseries as tallies: for any set we can ask which such segment, if any,\ncan be mapped one-to-one onto it, thus measuring its\n\u201ccardinality\u201d. (A set turns out to be finite in the sense\ndefined above if and only if there exists such an initial segment of\nthe natural numbers series.) Dedekind rounds off his essay by showing\nhow several basic and so far merely assumed facts in arithmetic can\nnow be proved as well. Especially significant is his purely\n\u201clogical\u201d justification of proofs by mathematical\ninduction and definitions by recursion (based on his theory of\nchains).\n",
