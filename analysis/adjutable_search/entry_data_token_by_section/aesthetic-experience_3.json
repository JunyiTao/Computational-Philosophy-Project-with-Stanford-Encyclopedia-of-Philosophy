    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience || Merit\n1.3 Merit\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, philosophers turned away from\nviews that took aesthetic experience to focus only on objects\u2019\npowers to produce pleasure. This seems to have taken place largely due\nto the influence of Kant\u2019s 1789 [1987] Critique of\nJudgment. There he distinguished the merely\nagreeable\u2014things which we simply like, e.g. because they satisfy\nour appetites\u2014from the beautiful. In doing so, he took it that\nan aesthetic experience of an object\u2019s free or pure beauty\ninvolves pleasure felt to be merited by the object so\nperceived (\u00a79). To have that response is to feel as though the\nobject deserves that very response you give it.\n\nThis is meant to make better sense of the way we discuss aesthetic\nexperiences and what we take to be authoritative on the matter of\nbeauty. To take pleasure in an aesthetic way in an object,\nKant thought, is just to engage your mental faculties of imagination\nand understanding in a pleasant free play with the form of the object\nyou perceive, unconstrained by thought of any real purpose that the\nobject might serve or any appetite it might satisfy (see Sections 2.3\nand 2.5). But any perceiver has these mental faculties, and must see\nthe same form in the object, and so (claimed Kant) aesthetic\nexperience involves a further thought that everyone ought to\ntake such pleasure in this object.\n\nOn this view of aesthetic experience, what you take to be merited is\nnot (just) a judgment about the aesthetic quality of an\nobject presented in perception. Kant is emphatic that what seems\nmerited to you, in having an aesthetic experience, is a\nfeeling, a form of pleasure. This is so in the case of beauty\nbut also in the case of the sublime (contrast the empiricists from the\nprevious section). The \u201cmathematically sublime\u201d is that\nwhich cannot be captured in full in our imagination, but about which\nwe can nonetheless reason, like infinitude itself. The\n\u201cdynamically sublime\u201d is that which looks to have total\npower over us\u2014like a massive storm or other monstrous aspects of\nnature\u2014but which we can nonetheless resist with the power of our\nown practical reason. In each, we feel pleased that our minds can\novercome limitations.\n\nThis is not a return to those thinkers (Augustine De Musica,\nAquinas Summa Theologica) who thought that aesthetic\nexperience was a direct apprehension of some inherent property of an\nobject, like its being well-formed for its function, or symmetrical in\na way that reflects the divine. According to Kant, beauty isn\u2019t\nstrictly speaking a property of objects (even though we speak as\nthough it is), and we aren\u2019t even tempted to attribute sublimity\nitself to objects. The focus here is pleasure in the powers of\nuniversal mental capacities themselves. Part of Kant\u2019s\ninnovation in aesthetics consists in the suggestion that objects might\ndeserve certain subjective responses.\n\nThis idea is not easy to understand, and many have done significant\ninterpretive and substantive philosophical work attempting to explain\nhow an object could deserve a subjective feeling (see e.g. Mothersill\n1988; Eaton 2001; Hamawaki 2006; Moran 2012; Cavell 1965 [2007];\nGinsborg 2015; Gorodeisky 2019, 2021). One approach here is to\ninterpret the pleasure in question as not just a phenomenal tone (see\nLabukt 2012, Bramble 2013) but rather as a kind of liking or\npro-attitude which, like other attitudes, could be suited or\n\u2018fitted\u2019 to its intentional object (Gorodeisky 2019, 2021;\nKriegel forthcoming; compare Hume 1757 [1987a]).\n\nDespite this difficulty, the idea that aesthetic experience involves a\nfocus on how an object merits a certain response has pervaded recent\ndiscussion. There\u2019s an important distinction to be made here\nbetween what it is to take aesthetic experience to involve (what feels\nlike) merited pleasure or admiration per se (Scruton 1974, Sibley\n1974, Walton 1993), and what it is to feel pleasure in or simply to\nlike some object when you have an otherwise merited kind of\nexperience of it (Beardsley 1970; Matthen 2017a, 2017b,\n2018). The challenge of making sense of what it is to merit a certain\nsubjective feeling of pleasure does not face this latter claim in the\nsame way, as we can make sense of how an artwork merits a general\nexperience in terms of that experience\u2019s accuracy, its\ncontextualization, or even how it matches the intentions of the artist\nwho created an object (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1949; Wollheim 1990).\n\nOne line of research pulls the idea of a merited response apart from\nKant\u2019s claim that the beautiful and the sublime universally\nmerit the same feelings across people. In his magnum opus In\nSearch of Lost Time (originally published 1913\u20131927),\nMarcel Proust (1913\u20131927 [2003]) suggested that an individual\nlike his narrator Marcel might feel an individualized, personal demand\nfor a feeling or an emotion from a certain scene or piece of artwork.\nPartly in response to Proust, and in resistance to Kant, Richard Moran\n(2012) and Nick Riggle (2016) have given substantive characterizations\nof the personal demands that artworks and natural scenes can make upon\nus (cf. Nussbaum 1990, Ch.13; Landy 2004, Chs. 1 and 3; Nehamas\n2007).\n\nThere is a challenge facing any theory that takes aesthetic experience\nto focus exclusively on objects\u2019 meriting certain pleasurable\nsubjective responses. It is possible to see that Michelangelo\u2019s\nstatue of David merits admiration, or that the view over Waimea Canyon\nmerits awe, without yourself feeling admiration or wonder in that\nmoment (cf. Moran 2012 on Proust 1913\u20131927 [2003]). Assuming\nthat other substantive restrictions can be met here (e.g. the demand\nfor disinterested attention; see Section 2.5), would this count as an\naesthetic experience? If so, it\u2019s not clear entirely what would\nbe valuable about it, even if it does involve a positive evaluation of\nits object. Some might say that you have gotten something right: you\nare correct in thinking that the statue merits admiration and the view\nmerits awe. It\u2019s not clear that this correctness would be enough\nto make sense of the great value of aesthetic experience.\n\nIt seems best to say here that this would not count as an aesthetic\nexperience because it does not bear the value of actually\ninvolving a subjective response that is itself of value. But this\ncould lead to trouble with dissociation in the other direction, which\nis also clearly possible: you could have a pleasurable experience\nas of some object\u2019s meriting that very kind of\npleasurable experience, while also being incorrect that it merits\nthat. If the value of aesthetic experience rests exclusively or\nprimarily on the value of the pleasure itself, then it seems that this\ninappropriate experience should share almost all the value that a\nmerited aesthetic experience would have. That, to some, is\ninconceivable (Budd 1985; see Shelley 2010, Peacocke 2021 for further\ndiscussion).\n\nThe view that aesthetic experience focuses primarily on object\u2019s\nmeriting certain positive responses can also clash with other\nintuitions about the nature of aesthetic experience. Some think that\nan experience should be counted as aesthetic even if it involves a\nnegative evaluation of its object: \u201can abominable performance of\nthe London Symphony is as aesthetic as a superb one \u2026\nThe symptoms of the aesthetic are not marks of merit,\u201d wrote\nNelson Goodman (1968 [1976], p. 255).\n",
