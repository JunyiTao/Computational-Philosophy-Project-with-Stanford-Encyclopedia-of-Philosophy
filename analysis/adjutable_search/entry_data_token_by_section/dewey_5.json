    "main_text": "Psychology || Perception/Sensation\n2.4 Perception/Sensation\n\nDewey\u2019s methodological lesson regarding instincts was twofold;\nfirst, one cannot premise an empirical science on unquestioned,\nmetaphysical posits; even basic terms must be open to revision or\ndeletion; second, strictly analytical methods using simple elements to\nbuild up complex behavior are often inadequate to explain the meaning\nof psychological phenomena. This lesson also applies to perception and\nsensation. Dewey attacked the view, common in his day, that a\nperception (1) was simply and externally caused, (2) completely\noccupied a mental state, and (3) was passively received into an empty\nmental space.\n\nAll three elements, he argued, grow out of \u201cpsychophysical\ndualism\u201d, the erroneous and radical separation of perceiver and\nworld. Consider (1), external causation. Perception as simply and\nexternally caused is contravened by the Darwinian, ecological model\nwhere ongoing interactions between organism and environment include,\nbut are not ontologically reducible to, \u201cminds\u201d,\n\u201cbodies\u201d, and their impingements\u2014the so-called\n\u201cimpressions\u201d and \u201cideas\u201d of modern\nphilosophy. While there are events which are unbidden,\nsurprising, or not under our control, this does not justify the\nmetaphysical conclusion of a world \u201cout there\u201d and a mind\n\u201cin here\u201d. While experience is profoundly qualitative,\nqualities are never merely received (like packages in the mail) nor\nare they simple or context-free. This is, in effect, a new view of\nqualities that also rejects a longstanding dualism between\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d. A lemon\u2019s\n\u201cyellowness\u201d or \u201ctartness\u201d are neither\nin a perceiver nor in a lemon; either quality\nemerges from complex interactions and later become characterized\n(as \u201ctartness\u201d) for reasons germane to the\ninquiry making that designation. Dewey wrote, \n\n\nThe qualities never were \u2018in\u2019 the organism; they always\nwere qualities of interactions in which both extra-organic things and\norganisms partake. (EN, LW1: 198\u2013199) \n\n\nThus, perceptions and qualities are discriminations made in inquiry\nand language; they are not reports of ontological entities which are\nsimple, ultimate, or discrete. Always, pragmatic factors are decisive.\n(Dewey makes the same point about nouns and concepts; cf. W.V.O.\nQuine\u2019s example of \u201cgavagai\u201d.)\n\u201cPerception\u201d, then, is shorthand for the more complicated\nprocesses of interacting events. \u201cRed\u201d is an abstraction\nfrom more complex experiences (such as red-car-merging-into-my-lane),\nand the pragmatic question becomes, What is the function of this\nabstraction? How does it mediate thought or action for future\nexperiences? (\u201cA Naturalistic Theory of Sense-Perception\u201d,\nLW2: 51; EN, LW1: 198\u2013199)\n\nRegarding (2), perceptions pervading mental states, Dewey echoes an\nimportant point made by James in \u201cThe Stream of Thought\u201d\n(James 1890: chapter 9). Namely, while a perception may occupy the\nfocus of awareness, each has an attendant \u201cfringe\u201d which\ncontributes a contrast and, to the wider situation, an\n\u201cunderlying qualitative character\u201d (\u201cQualitative\nThought\u201d, LW5: 238 fn. 1). In the lemon case, above, the\n\u201ctartness\u201d has its character amidst a slew of\n\u201cfringe\u201d conditions such as immediate past flavors,\nanticipations, etc.\n\nFinally, regarding (3), as mentioned, perception is an activity of\n\u201ctaking up\u201d by organisms already functioning in\nsituations, not an instant, passive apprehension of stimulus. As such,\nthere are always selective adjustments; quick or slow, they always\ntake some time. Perception is never na\u00efve, never a\nconfrontation with some \u201cgiven\u201d content already imbued\nwith inherent meaning. Long before Wilfred Sellars (see\n entry on Sellars)\n dismissed the passive-perception-encounter as modern\nempiricism\u2019s \u201cMyth of the Given\u201d, Dewey rebuked such\nclaims. All seeing is seeing as\u2014adjustments within\nlarger acts. Over time, these habits of adjustment change and, as a\nresult, what is perceived can also shift; subsequent selections and\ninterpretations are modified (DE, MW9: 346).\n",
