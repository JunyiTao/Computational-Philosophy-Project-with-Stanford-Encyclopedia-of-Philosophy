Cassirer regarded the theory as\na crucial test for Erkenntniskritik, the preferred term for\nthe epistemology of the physical sciences of Marburg\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism. The question, posed right at the beginning,\nis whether the Transcendental Aesthetic offered a foundation\n\u201cbroad enough and strong enough\u201d to bear the general\ntheory of relativity. Recognizing the theory\u2019s principal\nepistemological significance to lie in the requirement of general\ncovariance (\u201cthat the general laws of nature are not changed in\nform by arbitrary changes of the space-time variables\u201d),\nCassirer directed his attention to Einstein\u2019s remarks, cited in\n \u00a72\n above, that general covariance \u201ctakes away from space and time\nthe last remnant of physical objectivity\u201d. Cassirer correctly\nconstrued the gist of this passage to mean that in the general theory\nof relativity, space and time coordinates have no further importance\nthan to be mere labels of events (\u201ccoincidences\u201d),\nindependent variables of the mathematical (field) functions\ncharacterizing physical state magnitudes. In particular, the\nrequirement of general covariance had significantly improved upon Kant\nin bringing out far more clearly the exclusively methodological role\nof these conditions in empirical cognition, a role Kant misleadingly\nassigned to pure intuition. Not only has it has shown that space and\ntime are not \u201cthings\u201d, it has also clarified that they are\n\u201cideal principles of order\u201d applying to the objects of the\nphysical world as a necessary condition of their possible experience.\nAccording to Cassirer, Kant\u2019s intention with regard to\npure intuition was simply to express the methodological presupposition\nthat certain \u201cintellectual forms\u201d (Denkformen),\namong which are the purely ideal concepts of coexistence and\nsuccession, enter into all physical knowledge. According to the\ndevelopment of physics since the 17th century already\nchronicled in Substanzbegriff und Funktionsbegriff, these\nforms have progressively lost their \u201cfortuitous\u201d\n(zuf\u00e4lligen) anthropomorphic features, and more and more\ntake on the character of \u201csystematic forms of unity\u201d. From\nthis vantage point, general covariance is but the most recent\nrefinement of the methodological principle of \u201cunity of\ndetermination\u201d governing the constitution of objects of physical\nknowledge, notable in physics by the transition from concepts of\nsubstance into functional and relational concepts. In accord with\ncentral tenets of the Marburg Kant interpretation noted above,\nCassirer maintained that the requirement of generally covariant laws\nwas a vindication of the transcendental ideality of space and time,\nnot, indeed, as \u201cforms of intuition\u201d but as\n\u201cobjectifying conditions\u201d that further\n\u201cde-anthropomorphized\u201d the concept of object in physics,\nrendering it \u201cpurely symbolic\u201d. The fundamental concept of\nobject in physics no longer pertains to particular entities or\nprocesses propagating in space and time but rather to \u201cthe\ninvariance of relations among (physical state) magnitudes\u201d\nrepresented by generally covariant mathematical objects (tensors). For\nthis reason, Cassirer concluded, the general theory of relativity\nexhibits \u201cthe most determinate application and carrying through\nwithin empirical science of the standpoint of critical idealism\u201d\n(1921 [1957: 71; 1923: 412]).\n",
