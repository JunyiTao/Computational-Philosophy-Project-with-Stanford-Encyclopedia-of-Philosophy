    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Rousseau\u2019s claim to reconcile freedom and authority\n3.3 Rousseau\u2019s claim to reconcile freedom and authority\n\nWhat then of Rousseau\u2019s key claim that freedom and authority can\nbe reconciled in his ideal republic through obedience to the general\nwill? The opening words of The Social Contract themselves\nrefer to freedom, with the famous saying that \u201cMan is born free,\nbut is everywhere in chains\u201d. This ringing declaration, however,\nis almost immediately followed by a note of paradox, as Rousseau\ndeclares that he can make this subjection \u201cin chains\u201d\nlegitimate. The thought that Rousseau\u2019s commitment to freedom\nmight not be all that it first appears is strengthened by other\npassages in the book, most notably his notorious declaration in Book 1\nchapter 7 of The Social Contract that those subject to the\ngeneral will are \u201cforced to be free.\u201d\n\nThe value of freedom or liberty is at the center of Rousseau\u2019s\nconcerns throughout his work , though he uses the term in various\ndifferent ways (Simpson 2006). He regards the capacity for choice, and\ntherefore the ability to act against instinct and inclination, as one\nof the features that distinguishes humans from animals species and\nmakes truly moral action possible. In the Discourse on\nInequality, for example, he characterizes animals in essentially\nCartesian terms, as mechanisms programmed to a fixed pattern of\nbehavior, in contrast to humans, who are not tied to any particular\nmode of life and can reject the promptings of instinct. This makes\npossible both the development of the human species and also its fall\nfrom grace, since individuals can ignore benign impulses (such as\npiti\u00e9) if they wish to. The freedom to act contrary to\nthe \u201cmechanism of the senses\u201d, and the power of willing\nand choosing is, for Rousseau, something entirely outside the laws of\nthe physical world and is therefore not subject to scientific\nexplanation. Rousseau also takes this freedom to choose to act as the\nbasis of all distinctively moral action. In The Social\nContract the connection between freedom of choice and morality is\ncentral to his argument against despotic government, where he writes\nthat the renunciation of freedom is contrary to human nature and that\nto renounce freedom in favour of another person\u2019s authority is\nto \u201cdeprive one\u2019s actions of all morality\u201d (SC\n1.4).\n\nIn Book I chapter 8 of the The Social Contract, Rousseau\ntries to illuminate his claim that the formation of the legitimate\nstate involves no net loss of freedom, but in fact, he makes a\nslightly different claim. The new claim involves the idea of an\nexchange of one type of freedom (natural freedom) for another type\n(civil freedom). Natural freedom involves an unlimited right to all\nthings, an idea that is reminiscent of Hobbes\u2019s \u201cright of\nnature\u201d in Leviathan. Since all human beings enjoy this\nliberty right to all things, it is clear that in a world occupied by\nmany interdependent humans, the practical value of that liberty may be\nalmost nonexistent. This is because any individual\u2019s capacity to\nget what they wants will be limited by their physical power and the\ncompeting physical power of others. Further, inevitable conflict over\nscarce resources will pit individuals against each other, so that\nunhindered exercise of natural freedom will result in violence and\nuncertainty. The formation of the state, and the promulgation of laws\nwilled by the general will, transforms this condition. With sovereign\npower in place, individuals are guaranteed a sphere of equal freedom\nunder the law, with protection for their own persons and security for\ntheir property. Provided that the law bearing equally on everyone is\nnot meddlesome or intrusive (and Rousseau believes it will not be,\nsince no individual has a motive to legislate burdensome laws) there\nwill be a net increase in freedom compared to the pre-political\nstate.\n\nRousseau makes a further claim in the same chapter of The Social\nContract, namely that in conditions of civil society the citizen\nachieves \u201cmoral freedom,\u201d by which he means obedience to a\nlaw that one has prescribed to oneself (for discussion see especially\nNeuhouser 1993). Although this latter claim is presented almost as an\nafterthought, it is the form of freedom most directly responsive to\nthe challenge Rousseau had set for himself two chapters earlier, which\ninvolved finding \u201ca form of association\u201d in which each\ncitizen would \u201cobey only himself.\u201d Naturally, this raises\nthe question of whether the citizen does in fact obey only himself\nwhen he obeys the general will. On the face of it, this claim looks\ndifficult to reconcile with the fact of majorities and minorities\nwithin a democratic state, since those citizens who find themselves\noutvoted would seem to be constrained by a decision with which they\ndisagree. Rousseau\u2019s solution to this puzzle is found much\nlater, in Book 4 chapter 3 of The Social Contract, where he\nargues that those who obey laws they did not vote for remain bound by\na will that is their own, since the democratic process has enabled\nthem to discover the content of a general will in which they share.\nMany commentators have found this argument unconvincing.\n\nRousseau\u2019s invocation of three types of freedom (natural, civil,\nand moral) in the text of The Social Contract can appear\nconfusing. The picture is further complicated by the fact that he also\nrelies on a fourth conception of freedom, related to civil freedom but\ndistinct from it, which he nowhere names explicitly. This is\n\u201crepublican freedom\u201d and consists, not in my being subject\nto my own will, but rather in the fact that the law protects me from\nbeing subject to the will of any other particular person in the manner\nthat a slave or a serf is. To find Rousseau\u2019s explicit\nendorsement of this idea, we have to look not to The Social\nContract, but rather to some of his unpublished notes and to his\nLetters from the Mountains. Yet the concept is clearly\nimplicit in the notorious \u201cforced to be free\u201d passage in\nBook 1 chapter 7, since he there explains that when each citizen is\nconstrained to obey the general will, he is thereby provided with a\nguarantee against \u201call personal dependence\u201d.\n",
