    "main_text": "Is Hyperintensionality Real? || Hyperintensional Truth Conditions\n2.1 Hyperintensional Truth Conditions\n\nOne way to modify SPWS to give truth conditions for sentences is to\nresort to sets including both possible and impossible worlds (ways\nthings could not have been). Sentences that agree in truth\nvalue in very possible world can still be assigned distinct\ntruth-conditions, since those sentences might be true in different\nimpossible worlds. (See\n \u00a74.3).\n Another way is to use structured meanings, where sentences\nwith the same possible-worlds truth conditions can have different\nmeanings because of the way they are built up. (See\n \u00a74.5).\n An objection to these approaches can be generalized to any approach\nthat tries to make room for hyperintensionality in a truth-conditional\nframework.\n\nThe objection, presented in Cresswell (2002) against structured\npropositions and suggested by Stalnaker (1996) against impossible\nworlds, can be illustrated by focusing on the meaning of negation.\nGiven a statement \\(A\\), what truth-conditions can we offer for\n\\({\\sim}A\\)? Plausibly, the truth conditions can be exhausted by\nspecifying that \\({\\sim}A\\) is true when \\(A\\) is false, and not\notherwise. Since this exhausts the meaning of\n\u201c\\({\\sim}\\)\u201d, it is tempting to identify the proposition\n\\({\\sim}A\\) as being the proposition with this truth condition.\nPlausibly, also, the truth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) will just\nbe the truth conditions for \\(A\\). (We may even want to derive this\nsecond claim from plausible principles about truth, falsehood, and\nnecessity.) Now any theory which allows for distinct necessarily\nequivalent propositions will fall to the same objection: suppose \\(C\\)\nand \\(D\\) are distinct, necessarily equivalent propositions. Then\n\\({\\sim}C\\) will be the proposition that is true just in case \\(C\\) is\nfalse, and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the proposition that is true just in\ncase \\(D\\) is false: so \\({\\sim}C\\) and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the same\nproposition. But then there will be a unique proposition with the\ntruth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}C (/{\\sim}{\\sim}D)\\), since\n\\({\\sim}{\\sim}C\\) is the negation of \\({\\sim}C\\). So \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\nmust be the same proposition after all. This is a reductio of\nthe hypothesis that there can be a hyperintensional distinction\nbetween \\(C\\) and \\(D\\): if they are necessarily equivalent, they are\nidentical.\n\nWe might call this an objection from Booleanism, both because\nuniqueness of truth-conditional complementation is characteristic of\nBoolean approaches to negation, and because similar objections can be\nmotivated by Boolean thoughts about other operations. We might hope to\ndefine conjunction so that necessarily, \\((A \\land B)\\) is true iff\n\\(A\\) is true and \\(B\\) is true, and indeed the truth condition for\nthe proposition that \\((A \\land B)\\) is just that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare true. But then, with other innocuous assumptions, any two\nnecessarily equivalent sentences will express the same proposition, by\na similar chain of reasoning.\n\nCresswell (1975) was one of the pioneers of structured approaches to\nsentence meaning to handle hyperintensionality. So it is significant\nthat he thinks this objection refutes a contention at the heart of\northodox structured meaning projects, though Cresswell thinks that we\nmay still be interested in semantic structures for reasons other than\nhow they might make a difference to the truth-conditions of complex\nembeddings.\n\nDefenders of hyperintensional meanings need to resist the idea that\nfor each proposition \\(A\\) there is only one proposition true whenever\n\\(A\\) is false. This leaves them with a challenge: how are we to\nunderstand logical operations such as negation and conjunction once\nthese Boolean characterizations are rejected?\n",
