The Three Fundamental Principles of Plotinus\u2019 Metaphysics\n\n The three basic principles of Plotinus\u2019 metaphysics are called by him\n\u2018the One\u2019 (or, equivalently, \u2018the Good\u2019),\nIntellect, and Soul (see V 1; V 9.).  These principles are both\nultimate ontological realities and explanatory principles.  Plotinus\nbelieved that they were recognized by Plato as such, as well as by the\nentire subsequent Platonic tradition.\n\n The One is the absolutely simple first principle of all.  It is both\n\u2018self-caused\u2019 and the cause of being for everything else\nin the universe.  There are, according to Plotinus, various ways of\nshowing the necessity of positing such a principle.  These are all\nrooted in the Pre-Socratic philosophical/scientific tradition.  A\ncentral axiom of that tradition was the connecting of explanation with\nreductionism or the derivation of the complex from the simple. That\nis, ultimate explanations of phenomena and of contingent entities can\nonly rest in what itself requires no explanation.  If what is actually\nsought is the explanation for something that is in one way or another\ncomplex, what grounds the explanation will be simple relative to the\nobserved complexity.  Thus, what grounds an explanation must be\ndifferent from the sorts of things explained by it.  According to this\nline of reasoning, explanantia that are themselves complex,\nperhaps in some way different from the sort of complexity of the\nexplananda, will be in need of other types of explanation.  In\naddition, a plethora of explanatory principles will themselves be in\nneed of explanation.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the explanatory\npath must finally lead to that which is unique and absolutely\nuncomplex.\n\n The One is such a principle.  Plotinus found it in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic where it is named \u2018the Idea of the Good\u2019\nand in his Parmenides where it is the subject of a series of\ndeductions (137c ff.).  The One or the Good, owing to its simplicity,\nis indescribable directly.  We can only grasp it indirectly by\ndeducing what it is not (see V 3. 14; VI 8; VI 9. 3).  Even the names\n\u2018One\u2019 and \u2018Good\u2019 are fautes de mieux.\nTherefore, it is wrong to see the One as a principle of oneness or\ngoodness, in the sense in which these are intelligible attributes.\nThe name \u2018One\u2019 is least inappropriate because it best\nsuggests absolute simplicity.\n\n If the One is absolutely simple, how can it be the cause of the being\nof anything much less the cause of everything?  The One is such a\ncause in the sense that it is virtually everything else (see III 8. 1;\nV 1. 7, 9; V 3. 15, 33; VI 9. 5, 36). This means that it stands to\neverything else as, for example, white light stands to the colors of\nthe rainbow, or the way in which a properly functioning calculator may\nbe said to contain all the answers to the questions that can be\nlegitimately put to it.  Similarly, an omniscient simple deity may be\nsaid to know virtually all that is knowable. In general, if A is\nvirtually B, then A is both simpler in its existence than B and able\nto produce B. \n\n The causality of the One was frequently explained in antiquity as an\nanswer to the question, \u2018How do we derive a many from the\nOne?\u2019 Although the answer provided by Plotinus and by other\nNeoplatonists is sometimes expressed in the language of\n\u2018emanation\u2019, it is very easy to mistake this for what it\nis not.  It is not intended to indicate either a temporal process or\nthe unpacking or separating of a potentially complex unity.  Rather,\nthe derivation was understood in terms of atemporal ontological\ndependence.\n\n The first derivation from the One is Intellect.  Intellect is the\nlocus of the full array of Platonic Forms, those eternal and immutable\nentities that account for or explain the possibility of intelligible\npredication.  Plotinus assumes that without such Forms, there would be\nno non-arbitrary justification for saying that anything had one\nproperty rather than another.  Whatever properties things have, they\nhave owing to there being Forms whose instances these properties are.\nBut that still leaves us with the very good question of why an eternal\nand immutable Intellect is necessarily postulated along with these\nForms.\n\n The historical answer to this question is in part that Plotinus\nassumed that he was following Plato who, in Timaeus (30c;\ncf. Philebus 22c), claimed that the Form of Intelligible Animal\nwas eternally contemplated by an intellect called \u2018the\nDemiurge\u2019.  This contemplation Plotinus interpreted as cognitive\nidentity, since if the Demiurge were contemplating something outside\nof itself, what would be inside of itself would be only an image or\nrepresentation of eternal reality (see V 5) \u2013 and so, it would not\nactually know what it contemplates, as that is in itself.\n\u2018Cognitive identity\u2019 then means that when Intellect is\nthinking, it is thinking itself.  Further, Plotinus believed that\nAristotle, in book 12 of his Metaphysics and in book 3 of his\nDe Anima supported both the eternality of Intellect (in\nAristotle represented as the Unmoved Mover) and the idea that\ncognitive identity characterized its operation.\n\n Philosophically, Plotinus argued that postulating Forms without a\nsuperordinate principle, the One, which is virtually what all the\nForms are, would leave the Forms in eternal disunity.  If this were\nthe case, then there could be no necessary truth, for all necessary\ntruths, e.g., 3 + 5 = 8, express a virtual identity, as indicated here\nby the \u2018=\u2019 sign.  Consider the analogy of\nthree-dimensionality and solidity.  Why are these necessarily\nconnected in a body such that there could not be a body that had one\nwithout the other?  The answer is that body is virtually\nthree-dimensionality and virtually solidity.  Both\nthree-dimensionality and solidity express in different ways what a\nbody is.\n\n The role of Intellect is to account for the real distinctness of the\nplethora of Forms, virtually united in the One.  Thus, in the above\nmathematical example, the fact that numbers are virtually united does\nnot gainsay the fact that each has an identity.  The way that identity\nis maintained is by each and every Form being thought by an eternal\nIntellect.  And in this thinking, Intellect \u2018attains\u2019 the\nOne in the only way it possibly can.  It attains all that can be\nthought; hence, all that can be thought \u2018about\u2019 the\nOne.\n\n Intellect is the principle of essence or whatness or intelligibility\nas the One is the principle of being.  Intellect is an eternal\ninstrument of the One\u2019s causality (see V 4. 1, 1\u20134; VI 7. 42, 21\u201323).\nThe dependence of anything \u2018below\u2019 Intellect is owing to\nthe One\u2019s ultimate causality along with Intellect, which explains, via\nthe Forms, why that being is the kind of thing it is.  Intellect needs\nthe One as cause of its being in order for Intellect to be a\nparadigmatic cause and the One needs Intellect in order for there to\nbe anything with an intelligible structure.  Intellect could not\nsuffice as a first principle of all because the complexity of thinking\n(thinker and object of thought and multiplicity of objects of thought)\nrequires as an explanation something that is absolutely simple.  In\naddition, the One may even be said to need Intellect to produce\nIntellect.  This is so because Plotinus distinguishes two logical\n\u2018phases\u2019 of Intellect\u2019s production from the One (see V\n1. 7).  The first phase indicates the fundamental activity of\nintellection or thinking; the second, the actualization of thinking\nwhich constitutes the being of the Forms.  This thinking is the way\nIntellect \u2018returns\u2019 to the One.\n\n The third fundamental principle is Soul.  Soul is not the\nprinciple of life, for the activity of Intellect is the highest\nactivity of life.  Plotinus associates life with desire.  But in the\nhighest life, the life of Intellect, where we find the highest form of\ndesire, that desire is eternally satisfied by contemplation of the One\nthrough the entire array of Forms that are internal to it.\nSoul is the principle of desire for objects that are external\nto the agent of desire.  Everything with a soul, from human beings to\nthe most insignificant plant, acts to satisfy desire.  This desire\nrequires it to seek things that are external to it, such as food.\nEven a desire for sleep, for example, is a desire for a state other\nthan the state which the living thing currently is in.  Cognitive\ndesires, for example, the desire to know, are desires for that which\nis currently not present to the agent.  A desire to procreate is, as\nPlato pointed out, a desire for immortality.  Soul explains, as\nunchangeable Intellect could not, the deficiency that is implicit in\nthe fact of desiring.\n\n Soul is related to Intellect analogously to the way Intellect is\nrelated to the One.  As the One is virtually what Intellect is, so\nIntellect is paradigmatically what Soul is.  The activity of\nIntellect, or its cognitive identity with all Forms, is the paradigm\nfor all embodied cognitive states of any soul as well as any of its\naffective states.  In the first case, a mode of cognition, such as\nbelief, images Intellect\u2019s eternal state by being a\nrepresentational state.  It represents the cognitive identity of\nIntellect with Forms because the embodied believer is cognitively\nidentical with a concept which itself represents or images Forms.  In\nthe second case, an affective state such as feeling tired represents\nor images Intellect (in a derived way) owing to the cognitive\ncomponent of that state which consists in the recognition of its own\npresence.  Here, x\u2019s being-in-the-state is the\nintentional object of x\u2019s cognition.  Where the affective\nstate is that of a non-cognitive agent, the imitation is even more\nremote, though present nevertheless.  It is, says Plotinus, like the\nstate of being asleep in comparison with the state of being awake (see\nIII 8. 4).  In other words, it is a state that produces desire that is\nin potency a state that recognizes the presence of the desire, a state\nwhich represents the state of Intellect. In reply to the possible\nobjection that a potency is not an image of actuality, Plotinus will\nwant to insist that potencies are functionally related to actualities,\nnot the other way around, and that therefore the affective states of\nnon-cognitive agents can only be understood as derived versions of the\naffective and cognitive states of souls closer to the ideal of both,\nnamely, the state of Intellect.\n\n There is another way in which Soul is related to Intellect as\nIntellect is related to the One.  Plotinus distinguishes between\nsomething\u2019s internal and external activity (see V 4. 2, 27\u201333).  The\n(indescribable) internal activity of the One is its own\nhyper-intellectual existence.  Its external activity is just\nIntellect.  Similarly, Intellect\u2019s internal activity is its\ncontemplation of the Forms, and its external activity is found in\nevery possible representation of the activity of being eternally\nidentical with all that is intelligible (i.e., the Forms).  It is also\nfound in the activity of soul, which as a principle of\n\u2018external\u2019 desire images the paradigmatic desire of\nIntellect.  Anything that is understandable is an external activity of\nIntellect; and any form of cognition of that is also an external\nactivity of it.  The internal activity of Soul includes the plethora\nof psychical activities of all embodied living things.  The external\nactivity of Soul is nature, which is just the intelligible structure\nof all that is other than soul in the sensible world, including both\nthe bodies of things with soul and things without soul (see III 8. 2).\nThe end of this process of diminishing activities is matter which is\nentirely bereft of form and so of intelligibility, but whose existence\nis ultimately owing to the One, via the instrumentality of Intellect\nand Soul. \n\n According to Plotinus, matter is to be identified with evil and\nprivation of all form or intelligibility (see II 4).  Plotinus holds\nthis in conscious opposition to Aristotle, who distinguished matter\nfrom privation (see II 4. 16, 3\u20138).  Matter is what accounts for the\ndiminished reality of the sensible world, for all natural things are\ncomposed of forms in matter.  The fact that matter is in principle\ndeprived of all intelligibility and is still ultimately dependent on\nthe One is an important clue as to how the causality of the latter\noperates.  \n\n If matter or evil is ultimately caused by the One, then is not the\nOne, as the Good, the cause of evil?  In one sense, the answer is\ndefinitely yes.  As Plotinus reasons, if anything besides the One is\ngoing to exist, then there must be a conclusion of the process of\nproduction from the One.  The beginning of evil is the act of\nseparation from the One by Intellect, an act which the One itself\nultimately causes.  The end of the process of production from the One\ndefines a limit, like the end of a river going out from its sources.\nBeyond the limit is matter or evil.\n\n We may still ask why the limitless is held to be evil.  According to\nPlotinus, matter is the condition for the possibility of there being\nimages of Forms in the sensible world.  From this perspective, matter\nis identified with the receptacle or space in Plato\u2019s Timaeus\nand the phenomenal properties in the receptacle prior to the\nimposition of order by the Demiurge.  The very possibility of a\nsensible world, which is impressively confirmed by the fact that there\nis one, guarantees that the production from the One, which must\ninclude all that is possible (else the One would be self-limiting),\nalso include the sensible world (see I 8. 7).  But the sensible world\nconsists of images of the intelligible world and these images could\nnot exist without matter.\n\n Matter is only evil in other than a purely metaphysical sense when it\nbecomes an impediment to return to the One.  It is evil when\nconsidered as a goal or end that is a polar opposite to the Good.  To\ndeny the necessity of evil is to deny the necessity of the Good (I 8.\n15).  Matter is only evil for entities that can consider it as a goal\nof desire.  These are, finally, only entities that can be\nself-conscious of their goals.  Specifically, human beings, by opting\nfor attachments to the bodily, orient themselves in the direction of\nevil.  This is not because body itself is evil.  The evil in bodies is\nthe element in them that is not dominated by form.  One may be\ndesirous of that form, but in that case what one truly desires is that\nform\u2019s ultimate intelligible source in Intellect.  More typically,\nattachment to the body represents a desire not for form but a corrupt\ndesire for the non-intelligible or limitless. \n",
