    "main_text": "A Priori Justification and Early 20th Century Non-Naturalism || Prima Facie Moral Principles and Intuitionism\n3.2 Prima Facie Moral Principles and Intuitionism\n\nW. D. Ross (1930) is for many the paradigm intuitionist (see entry on\n William David Ross).\n He held both pluralism:\n\n(P)\nThere is no single, fundamental moral principle.\n\n\nand intuitionism:\n\n(I)\nWe can have intuitive, a priori knowledge of moral propositions.\n\n\nEven though (P) is not the focus of this entry, it might be useful to\nreview Ross\u2019s position on it. Ross provided principles\nspecifying various grounds of duty by using the concept of prima\nfacie duty. Ross thought of prima facie duty as a\ntendency to be a duty, not as a kind of duty. He held that we have\nprima facie duties to keep promises and tell the truth, to\nprovide reparation for harms we have done, to perform acts of\ngratitude, to insure just distributions, to benefit others, to improve\nourselves, and not to harm others. He held that an act is a prima\nfacie duty in virtue of some one component of its nature, e.g.,\nbeing a promise keeping. But a given act can have more than one\nmorally significant feature, and in virtue of some features it might\nbe prima facie right while also being prima facie\nwrong in virtue of other features. Imagine a mob enforcer has taken a\ncontract to kill someone. The act of fulfilling his contract would be\na prima facie duty in virtue of keeping a promise, but it\nwould be prima facie wrong in virtue of harming, indeed,\nkilling, a person. The act would be wrong all-things-considered.\nOne\u2019s all-things-considered duty, according to Ross, is\ndetermined by the entire nature of an action. Ross held that it is not\npossible to provide a general ranking of prima facie duties\naccording to their stringency, with more stringent duties always\ntrumping less stringent duties if they conflict. And he did not think\nit is possible to provide any other sort of general rule for\ndetermining which prima facie duty will take precedence in\ncases of conflict. Therefore, even if we had a set of principles\nidentifying every prima facie right making feature and every\nprima facie wrong making feature\u2014which Ross did not\nclaim to have provided\u2014and even if we had complete knowledge of\nthe non-moral features of all actions, we could not mechanically\ndeduce which actions we would be duty bound to perform.\n\nTurning now to (I): Ross held that his principles specifying prima\nfacie duties are self-evident. Here is a significant passage from\nRoss articulating his view:\n\n\nThat an act, qua fulfilling a promise, or qua\n\u2026, is prima facie right, is self-evident; not in the\nsense that it is evident from the beginning of our lives, or as soon\nas we attend to the proposition for the first time, but in the sense\nthat when we have reached sufficient mental maturity and have given\nsufficient attention to the proposition it is evident without any need\nof proof, or of evidence beyond itself. It is self-evident just as a\nmathematical axiom, or the validity of a form of inference, is\nevident\u2026. In our confidence that these propositions are true\nthere is involved the same trust in our reason that is involved in our\nconfidence in mathematics; and we should have no justification for\ntrusting it in the latter sphere and distrusting it in the former. In\nboth cases we are dealing with propositions that cannot be proved, but\njust as certainly need no proof. (1930: 29\u201330) \n\n\nRoss here not only provides some clarification of his notion of\nself-evidence, but also commits himself to a number of theses that are\ntypical of, or typically associated with, intuitionism (meaning (I)\nspecifically). By identifying these theses, we can begin to get a\nclearer picture of Ross\u2019s intuitionism.\n\nRoss claims that some propositions regarding prima facie\nduties are self-evident. However, as Ross understands the\nself-evidence of moral propositions, it is both stronger and weaker\nthan it is according to (SE).\n\nThe self-evidence Ross attributes to moral propositions is weaker in\nthat whereas on (SE) a self-evident proposition will be evident for\nany person who understands it, according to Ross a self-evident moral\nproposition is evident for any person who has attained sufficient\nmental maturity and given the proposition sufficient attention. Hence,\non Ross\u2019s conception, a self-evident proposition,\nPSE, might not be justified for some, and perhaps\neven many, who understand it; PSE may not be evident\nto persons who understand it if they either lack sufficient mental\nmaturity or have not considered PSE\n sufficiently.[6]\n Depending upon what is required for sufficient mental maturity and\nsufficient consideration, self-evident moral propositions might be\nevident, in virtue of their self-evidence, for precious few actual\nindividuals. Here\u2019s one way to think about it: Rossian\nself-evidence has less epistemic potency\u2014a person must satisfy\nmore conditions for a self-evident moral proposition to be evident\nthan merely understanding it.\n\nIf the requirements for sufficient maturity and consideration are\nminimal, then there will be little difference between self-evidence as\ndefined by Ross and (SE). But Ross\u2019s approach would include a\n\u201cfudge factor\u201d that might be useful. It could, e.g.,\nenable him to avoid purported counterexamples where S\nunderstands some self-evident moral proposition,\nPSE, but we are disinclined to grant that\nPSE is justified for S either because\nS suffers from some general cognitive deficiency, e.g.,\nexcessive credulity, or the circumstances in which S\nunderstands P are problematic for some reason, e.g., S\nis exhausted or distracted. Ross could simply point out that S\nlacks mental maturity or has failed to give PSE\nsufficient consideration, and thereby avoid having to say that\nS has a justification for PSE.\n\nRoss\u2019s more restricted conception of self-evidence has another\npotential advantage. We were all taught about morality. When children,\nwe were told, \u201cDon\u2019t hit!\u201d \u201cShare your\ntoys\u201d, \u201cYou ought not lie\u201d, etc. And when older,\nmost of us encountered situations where it was not clear to us what we\nshould do, so we sought the advice of someone we trusted. In some of\nthese cases the moral propositions at issue may have been\nself-evident, but at first the truth of these propositions was not\nobvious to us, so we believed on the basis of testimony. One might\naddress these moral cases in the way we\u2019ve suggested the\nstandard story could address analogous logical and mathematical cases.\nThat way of addressing the cases is not obviously mistaken, but one\nmight balk at the thought that a person who understands a self-evident\nproposition automatically has a justification for that proposition\neven before it is apparent to the person that the proposition is\ntrue.\n\nRoss\u2019s stronger requirements for self-evidence might provide a\nmore satisfactory account. Since on his view self-evident propositions\nare evident for any person who has attained sufficient mental maturity\nand given the propositions sufficient consideration, he could deny\nthat a child first being taught simple moral principles has a\njustification for these principles and deny that a math student who\nhas been introduced to an \u201cobvious\u201d truth, but has not yet\nhad a chance to give it any consideration, would have a justification\nfor the truth. Ross could make the more plausible claim that if we had\na justification for these propositions at first, it was only because\nof testimony. We did not, at first, have justifications for these\npropositions on our own. Later, when we were mature and had given\nthese propositions due consideration, they would be evident to us on\ntheir own.\n\nRoss\u2019s conception of self-evidence is stronger than the standard\nunderstanding because he held self-evident propositions are certain.\nIn the passage quoted, Ross does not explicitly claim that\nself-evident propositions are certain, but he suggests they\nare when he claims that self-evident moral propositions are like\nmathematical axioms and logical truths. And two paragraphs later he\nexplicitly claims that our judgments regarding prima facie\nduties are certain. (SE) asserts only that self-evident propositions\nare evident, not that they are certain.\n\nThree more elements of Ross\u2019s view deserve mention. First, the\nstandard story has it that self-evident propositions can be\njustified without additional evidence, but does not rule out being\njustified in believing a self-evident proposition on the basis of\nevidence or even proof. But Ross claims that self-evident propositions\ncannot be proved.\n\nSecond, Ross allowed that a person might come to be justified in\nbelieving one of his general principles regarding prima facie\nduties via what is sometimes called \u201cintuitive induction\u201d.\nOne recognizes prima facie duties in particular cases first,\nand then comes to apprehend the general principle. Thus, for example,\none intuits in a number of particular cases where one has promised,\nthat one has a prima facie obligation to do what one has\npromised, and then one \u201csees\u201d that one has a prima\nfacie obligation to keep promises. Intuitive induction is\nsupposed to produce a priori knowledge. When one knows on the\nbasis of an intuitive induction the justification for the general\nprinciple is not derived from one\u2019s justifications regarding the\nparticular cases, as one would be in a standard enumerative induction.\nSince Ross held that principles regarding prima facie duties\nare self-evident, he was committed to the claim that their\njustification does not depend upon anything else. So the idea must\ninstead be that thinking about the particular cases either enables one\nto truly understand the general principle or is involved in giving it\nsufficient consideration, whereupon one comes to see that it is\ntrue.\n\nThird, Ross denied that propositions regarding all-things-considered\nduties in particular cases are self-evident. Indeed, he denied that\none can know what one\u2019s all-things-considered duty is in any\nactual case; he held that this was a matter of \u201cprobable\nopinion\u201d. In Ross\u2019s view, a prima facie duty\nresults from some one property of an action, e.g., that it is a\npromise keeping or that it benefits some person. But one\u2019s\nall-things-considered duty results from the entire nature of an\naction. So one reason we cannot know our all-things-considered duty is\nthat we cannot know whether we have identified all the features of an\naction that are morally relevant. And even if we could, there is the\nadditional problem that prima facie duties can conflict, and\nit is not self-evident how such conflicts should be resolved.\n",
