In addition to the Sententiae, On\nAbstinence and To Gaurus, there are quite a few\nfragments of other works bearing on his psychological views, preserved\nespecially in Nemesius, Stobaeus, and St. Augustine.\n\nThe soul is an intelligible entity but, as noted above, it is the\nintelligible entity that is directly engaged with the sensible realm.\nIntelligible entities are incorporeal and without extension and not\npresent in bodies as in place. Following Plotinus, Porphyry\ndistinguishes between the soul in itself, which seems to be identical\nthe rational soul, and a second power of the rational, the lower soul,\nwhich is the soul in relation to the body and is alone directly\nengaged with it (Sent. 4). The lower soul is responsible for\nsoul-functions that directly involve the body, such as\nsense-perception, desires, emotions and purely biological functions\nsuch as growth. In the tradition before Porphyry, this distinction\nsometimes became so sharp that it was supposed that each person has\ntwo distinct souls. Porphyry, by contrast, insists on the unity of the\nhuman soul: the lower functions are powers that depend on the rational\nsoul (see Deuse 1983: 169\u2013217). The distinction between the soul\nitself and its powers (the lower soul) is an instance of the\ndistinction between internal and external acts, mentioned above. Thus,\nthe soul itself has an intellectual activity that has the second\npowers or lower soul as its external act.\n\nCertain problems arise in accounting for how something which in itself\nis incorporeal can be present in an extended body, as the soul\napparently is. Porphyry resolves this by saying that the soul is not\nlocally present in the body but is present to it by a certain\ndisposition or inclination towards the body (Sent.3; 4). In a\npassage preserved in Nemesius, On the Nature of Man, he says\nthat when something intelligible enters into a relation to some place\nor to a thing in a place, it is by a misuse of language that we say\nthat it is there. Because its activity is there, we speak of the place\nwhen we should speak of the relation to it and the activity. When one\nshould say \u201cit acts there\u201d we misleadingly say \u201cit\nis there\u201d (Nem. 3, 112\u2013114; cf. Sent. 28). From\nPorphyry\u2019s \u201cinquiry\u201d (z\u0113tema) about\nthe relation preserved by Nemesius we further learn that the embodied\nsoul\u2019s relation to the body is a case of \u201cunfused\nunion\u201d (asynchytos hen\u014dsis), (3, 1\u2013185;\nD\u00f6rrie 1959: cap. 2). This implies a relationship that amounts to\na fusion in which the two ingredients, however, retain their identity\nand can in principle be separated. Here, perhaps typically, Porphyry\nmakes use of Stoic theories about mixtures but comes up with an\naccount that does not essentially depart from Plotinus (see Emilsson\n1994: 5357ff.). In Against Boethus (a Peripatetic philosopher\nof the 1st century B.C.), fragments of which are preserved by\nEusebius, Porphyry argues that a distinction must be made between the\nsoul as the form of the body, what makes the body alive, and the soul\nas an intellective, transcendent entity, which is its essential\nnature. This latter soul is immortal and Boethus makes the mistake of\nconfusing the two (see Karamanolis 2006: 91\u201398 and Trabattoni\n2020).\n\nFor Porphyry, as for Plotinus, what matters most in life is to free\none\u2019s soul from the calamities of the body and the sensible\nworld in general so that it may become purely what it originally and\nessentially is, viz., a part of the intelligible world. Thus, reason\nshould endeavor to elevate itself to the level of the Intellect, which\nis distinguished by a much higher degree of unity than the mere\nordinary use of reason is capable of. It may even be possible to rise\nabove this to the level of the One itself. There seems to be a certain\ndifference in Porphyry\u2019s and Plotinus\u2019 emphasis here,\nhowever. Whereas Plotinus stresses episodic escapes in this life by\nmeans of philosophy, Porphyry, while admitting this possibility, seems\nto suppose that the soul may, after successive reincarnations, free\nitself from the sensible realm for good. At least according to some of\nthe evidence, he, however, rejects the incarnation of human souls into\nanimal bodies and interprets Platonic passages suggesting this as not\nliterally intended (see Smith 1984 and Deuse 1983: 129\u2013159).\n\nScholars now universally agree that the work, To Gaurus on How\nEmbryos are Ensouled attributed to Galen in the manuscripts, is\nnot by him but by Porphyry. There is now a fine edition, translations\nand commentaries of this work (Wilberding 2011; Brisson et al. 2012).\nThough arguably an elaboration of Plotinus\u2019 views, in To\nGaurus Porphyry gives the details of a very interesting account\nof the development of the embryo and its relations to the parents (see\nin particular Wilberding 2008). Among other things Porphyry gives an\nexplanation of how and why children resemble both their parents: the\nembryo develops from the seed of the father but it does not have a\nsoul of its own. It is ruled by the vegetative soul of the mother who\nputs a permanent stamp on the embryo through a process of blending in\nwhich the nature of the embryo retains its individuality. The account\ngiven diverges significantly from those of previous thinkers, allowing\nfor much greater influence of the mother.\n\nPorphyry is on record for his defense of vegetarianism in his On\nAbstinence. This work is addressed to a friend (an associate of\nPlotinus\u2019 circle in Rome) and former vegetarian who has resumed\nthe consumption of meat. On the one hand, Porphyry\u2019s abstinence\nfrom eating animals is motivated by the goal, mentioned above, of\nfreeing oneself from the body and the sensible realm as much as\npossible. The exhortation is addressed to those who have set\nthemselves such a goal. There are, however, ethical concerns as well.\nPorphyry accords certain rationality to the animals and in general\nemphasizes what they have in common with us humans. He claims that it\nis plainly unjust to harm those who intend no harm against us, and\nthis applies to the animals. So his vegetarianism is also a matter of\njustice (Tuominen 2015). The evidence suggests, however, that he did\nnot hold this view consistently: in his Philosophy from the\nOracles (see Smith 1993) he accepts animal sacrifices and does\nnot object to them on principle in his Letter to Anebo.\n\nIn Sententiae 32 Porphyry presents his views on the virtues,\nwhich, though a development of Plotinus\u2019 account in\nEnnead I. 2, are interesting in their own right. He\ndistinguishes between four kinds of virtue: civic, purgative,\ncontemplative and paradigmatic. The four kinds of virtue are\nhierarchically ordered so that paradigmatic virtue comprises in some\nway all the rest (paradigmatic virtues are the Platonic Forms, or\nparadigms, of the different virtues). On the other hand, even if,\ne.g., civic virtue naturally leads to purgative virtue, a person may\nbe virtuous at the civic level without possessing the higher forms. On\nall four levels Porphyry posits the four cardinal virtues of\nPlato\u2019s Republic (wisdom, courage, temperance and\njustice). The civic virtues are concerned with the virtuous actions of\nordinary life\u2014wise, temperate, just and courageous. These\ncardinal virtues are differently, albeit analogously, defined in the\ncase of each level. Thus, e.g., wisdom as a purgative virtue is\ndefined as the soul\u2019s \u201cnot forming opinions in accordance\nwith the body, but acting on its own\u201d, whereas wisdom as a\ncontemplative virtue consists in the contemplation of the essences\ninherent in Intellect. Thus, the virtues form a hierarchy where the\ninferior may be seen as a weaker manifestation of the superior. This\ntheory of virtue is a clever attempt at reconciling the\nRepublic, the Phaedo and the Theaetetus and\nfitting their teaching about virtue into a coherent Platonic\nmetaphysics. This kind of account of the virtues was accepted and\nexpanded on by later Neoplatonists.\n\nInteresting differences between Porphyry and Plotinus can be detected\nin their respective views on the emotions and on happiness. While\nPlotinus holds that the emotions should be eradicated and that\nhappiness consists in the life of Intellect alone, the perfect life\n(Ennead I.4.3), Porphyry recommends metriopatheia,\n\u201cmoderate emotions\u201d, and allows for degrees of happiness.\nNot only the intellectually virtuous person is happy, the civically\nvirtuous person is happy too, even if this is a lower form of\nhappiness (see Karamanolis 2006: 303\u2013308). These differences\nreflect Porphyry\u2019s endeavor to bring Plato and Aristotle into\nharmony.\n",
