    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || The Law of Nature\n3.4 The Law of Nature\n\nAccordingly, \u201cthe most common rule [regula]\u201d of\nactions, called the right (ius) or law (lex) of\nnature, enjoins that humans \u201cmust, inasmuch as [they] can,\ncultivate and maintain toward others a peaceable sociality that is\nconsistent with the native character and end of humankind in\ngeneral\u201d (DJN II.3. 1 and 15; Pufendorf 1994a, pp. 148, 152).\nThis law does not rest on an intrinsic morality of actions, an\nabsolute value of persons, on common agreement among humans, or even\non the long-term utility that generally follows compliance with its\ninjunctions (DJN II.3.4, 7\u20138,10) \u2013 though the latter two\nare not denied. Rather, it appeals to a divine superior who is taken\nto enjoin that which right reason itself can discover to be in\nhumans\u2019 interest. (DJN II.3.19) That is, while the law\u2019s\ncontent or practical purposiveness is articulated by right reason\nobserving \u201cman\u2019s nature, condition, and inclinations,\n\u2026 other things external to man, especially those capable of\nbenefiting or harming him in some way[,] \u2026 and the kinds of\nassistance and restraint he needs\u201d (DJN II.3.14; Pufendorf\n1994a, p. 151), its normative force as law depends formally on the\nwill of a super-human authority with the power of sanction (DJN\nII.3.19\u201320). Pufendorf grants that the latter relationship\nremains \u201csomewhat obscure\u201d for those who follow the light\nof reason alone, since natural sanctions are imperfect and\nsupernatural sanctions out of play (DJN II.3.21, III.4.6). However,\nthe voluntarist problem of arbitrariness is avoided by positing\n(Pufendorf thinks proving, through natural theology [DO I.4]) divine\nbenevolence (providence) and consistency: human nature and the law\nregulating it are willed together by God for human benefit (DJN\nII.3.4\u20135). (More agnostically, one might refer to the benignity\nof things, as it were, the starting assumption that, at the least, the\nworld is not decidedly against us.) And that supposition in turn is\nsupported by the evidence of actual experience (both historical and\ncontemporary), which is in any case the only way to discern and\nunderstand the law\u2019s requirements (DJN II.3.12). In short, God\nis not perverse, and the world not entirely inhospitable to morality\nand human welfare.\n\nPufendorf acknowledges the fundamental reality of self-love and the\npossibility of reading the natural law as a merely instrumental rule.\nHowever, he denies that self-love is the only human motive or\nnecessarily in conflict with other motives, and argues that in fact\nits aims can be fully or really achieved only through the natural law;\nthis does command humans to love themselves, albeit in a mitigated,\nrestrained, and thus more successful way (DJN II.3.14 and 18). That\nis, humans are not totally selfish or totally altruistic, but\npartially both. Hence the natural law does not forbid the pursuit of\nself-interest but merely regulates it, enjoining both the care of self\nand the care of others that humans already seek (in a limited and\ninadequate fashion). If human nature tended toward one or other\nextreme, the law\u2019s injunctions would be either impossible or\nunnecessary (i.e., pointless); it is precisely humans\u2019 medial\nnature, their motivationally mixed constitution, that accounts for the\nlaw\u2019s normative force \u2013 in both its rational (legitimate\nreasons) and sanctional (strength) aspects. The argument certainly\nrequires its voluntarist (and theistic) premise, but it relies as much\non the compatible (and, supposedly, confirmatory) deliverances of\ngeneral human experience. In practice, given the stakes involved\naccording to either interpretation, it often may not matter which is\nemphasized. And this was undoubtedly why (beside its non-theological\nfoundation) Pufendorf\u2019s more perceptive religious critics\nresisted it and often accused him of Hobbism, and why in turn his\nsecular adherents were not alienated by the deity lingering in the\nbackground.\n",
