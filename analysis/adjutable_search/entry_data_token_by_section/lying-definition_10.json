    "main_text": "Deceptionism vs. Non-Deceptionism About Lying || Non-Deceptionism\n2.4 Non-Deceptionism\n\n\nNon-Deceptionists hold that an intention to deceive is not necessary\nfor lying.\n\nFor Simple Non-Deceptionists (Augustine 1952 (cf. Griffiths 2003, 31);\nAquinas 1952; Shibles 1985), there is nothing more to lying than\nmaking an untruthful statement. According to Aquinas, for example, a\njocose lie is a lie. This position is not defended by contemporary\nphilosophers.\n\nFor Complex Non-Deceptionists, untruthfulness is not sufficient for\nlying. In order to differentiate lying from telling jokes, being\nironic, acting, etc., a further condition must be met. For some\nComplex Non-Deceptionists, that further condition is warranting the\ntruth of the untruthful statement. For other Complex\nNon-Deceptionists, that condition is making an assertion.\n\n\nThomas Carson holds that it is possible to lie by making a false and\nuntruthful statement to an addressee without intending to deceive the\naddressee, so long as the statement is made in a context such that one\n\u201cwarrants the truth\u201d of the statement (and one does not\nbelieve oneself to be not warranting the truth of the statement), or\none intends to warrant the truth of the statement:\n\n(L12)\nA person x tells a lie to another person y\niff (i) x makes a false statement p to y,\n(ii) x believes that p is false or probably false (or,\nalternatively, x does not believe that p is true),\n(iii) x states p in a context in which x thereby\nwarrants the truth of p to y, and (iv) x does not\ntake herself to be not warranting the truth of what she says to\ny. (Carson 2006, 298; 2010, 30)\n\n(L13)\nA person x tells a lie to another person y iff (i)\nx makes a false statement p to y, (ii) x\nbelieves that p is false or probably false (or,\nalternatively, x does not believe that p is true), and\n(iii) x intends to warrant the truth of p\nto y. (Carson 2010, 37)\n\n\n\nCarson includes the falsity condition in both of his definitions;\nhowever, he is prepared to modify both definitions so that the falsity\ncondition is not required (Carson 2010, 39). He also holds that the\nuntruthfulness condition is not stringent enough, since, if a speaker\nsimply does \u201cnot believe\u201d her statement to be true (but\ndoes not believe it to be false), or believes that her statement is\n\u201cprobably false\u201d (but does not believe it to be false),\nthen she is lying.\n\n\nCarson gives two examples of non-deceptive lies: a guilty student who\ntells a college dean that he did not cheat on an examination, without\nintending that the dean believe him (since \u201che is really\nhard-boiled, he may take pleasure in thinking that the Dean knows he\nis guilty\u201d), because he knows that the dean\u2019s policy is\nnot to punish a student for cheating unless the student admits to\ncheating, and a witness who provides untruthful (and false) testimony\nabout a defendant, where there is a preponderance of evidence against\nthe defendant, without the intention that the testimony be believed by\nanyone, in order to avoid suffering retaliation from the defendant\nand/or his henchmen (Carson 2006, 289; 2010, 21). Neither person is\nlying according to the definitions of lying of Simple Deceptionists\n(L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) or Complex Deceptionists (L6, L7, L8, and L9)\n(cf. Simpson 1992, 631) or Moral Deceptionists (L10, L11). Both are\nlying according to L12 and L13, because each warrants the truth of his\nstatement, even though neither intends to deceive his addressee.\n\n\nIt has been argued that the witness and the student do have an\nintention to deceive (Meibauer 2011, 282; 2014a, 105). It has also\nbeen argued that they are being deceptive, even if they lack an\nintention that their untruthful statements be believed to be true\n(Lackey 2013; but see Fallis 2015). However, it has also been argued\nthat they fail to warrant the truth of their statements, and hence\nfail to be lying according to L12 and L13. One argument is that, in\nthe witness example, the statement is coerced, and \u201cCoerced\nspeech acts are not genuinely assertoric\u201d (Leland 2013, 3;\ncf. Kenyon 2010). \u201cIn the context of a threat of violent death,\nthe mere fact that he is speaking under oath is not sufficient to\ninstitute an ordinary warranting context\u201d (Leland 2013,\n4). Another argument is that the witness and the student are not\nwarranting the truth of their statements because they believe that\ntheir audiences believe that they are being untruthful.\n\nCarson has said that \u201cIf one warrants the truth of a statement,\nthen one promises or guarantees, ether explicitly or implicitly, that\nwhat one says is true\u201d (Carson 2010, 26) and \u201cWarranting\nthe truth of a statement presupposes that the statement is being used\nto invite or influence belief. It does not make sense for one to\nguarantee the truth of something that one is not inviting or\ninfluencing others to believe\u201d (Carson 2010, 36). The result is\nthat to lie is to breach trust: \u201cTo lie, on my view,\nis to invite others to trust and rely on what one says by warranting\nits truth, but, at the same time, to betray that trust by making false\nstatements that one does not believe\u201d (Carson 2010, 34). The\ncombination of warranting the truth of one\u2019s statement and\nbreaching trust would appear to make Carson\u2019s definition of\nlying similar to that of Complex Deceptionists such as Chisholm and\nFeehan. It would also appear to produce similar results. For example,\nCarson says the following about negotiators:\n\nIn the US, it is common and often a matter of course for people to\ndeliberately misstate their bargaining positions during\nnegotiations. Such statements are lies according to standard\ndictionary definitions of lying\u2014they are intentional false\nstatements intended to deceive others. However, given my first\ndefinition of lying [L12], such cases are not lies unless the\nnegotiator warrants the truth of what he says\u2026 Suppose that two\n\u201chardened\u201d cynical negotiators who routinely misstate\ntheir intentions, and do not object when others do this to them,\nnegotiate with each other. Each person recognizes that the other party\nis a cynical negotiator, and each is aware of the fact that the other\nparty knows this. In this sort of case, statements about one\u2019s\nminimum or maximum price are not warranted to be true. (Carson\n2010, 191)\nIf a negotiator makes an untruthful statement, \u201cThat is the\nhighest I can go,\u201d to another negotiator, then, since the\nnegotiator believes that the other negotiator believes that he is\nmaking an untruthful statement, he cannot intend to warrant the truth\nof his statement, and/or the context (of negotiation) is such that he\nis not warranting the truth of his statement. As a result, he is is\nnot lying, according to L12. He is not lying according to L13, either,\nat least if it is true that you cannot \u201cintend to do something\nthat you do not expect to succeed at\u201d (Fallis 2009, 43 n 48;\ncf. Newey 1997, 96\u201397).\n\nIt seems that the same thing can be said about the student and the\nwitness. If the student believes that the dean already knows he is\nguilty, and if the witness believes that the jury, etc., already knows\nthat the defendant is guilty, then it seems that neither can intend to\nwarrant the truth of his statement, and/or the context is such that\nneither is warranting the truth of his statement. If this is so, then\nneither is lying according to L12 and L13. Carson has said, about\ntheir Complex Deceptionist definition of lying, \u201cChisholm and\nFeehan\u2019s definition has the very odd and unacceptable result\nthat a notoriously dishonest person cannot lie to people who he knows\ndistrust him\u201d (Carson 2010, 23). It does seem, however, that\nCarson\u2019s definition has the same result.\nJennifer Saul also holds that it is possible to lie without\nintending to deceive. She has provided a modified version of L12 that\ncombines the warranting context condition, and the not believing that\none is not warranting condition, in the single condition of\nbelieving that one is in a warranting context:\n\n(L14)\nIf the speaker is not the victim of linguistic error/malapropism\nor using metaphor, hyperbole, or irony, then they lie iff (i) they say\nthat p; (ii) they believe p to be false; (iii) they take\nthemselves to be in a warranting context. (Saul 2012, 3)\n\nAccording to Saul, it is not possible to lie if one does not\nbelieve that one is in a warranting context. Saul considers the case\nof a putative lie told in a totalitarian state: \u201cThis is the\ncase of utterances demanded by a totalitarian state. These utterances\nof sentences supporting the state are made by people who don\u2019t\nbelieve them, to people who don\u2019t believe them. Everyone knows\nthat false things are being said, and that they are only being said\nonly because they are required by the state. [\u2026] It seems\nsomewhat reasonable to suggest that, since everyone is forced to make\nthese false utterances, and everyone knows they are false, they cease\nto be genuine lies\u201d (Saul 2012, 9). Saul adds that \u201cPeople\nliving in a totalitarian state, making pro-state utterances, are a\ntrickier case (which they should be). Whether or not their utterances\nare made in contexts where a warrant of truth is present is not at all\nclear\u201d (Saul 2012, 11). If a speaker is making an untruthful\nstatement to a hearer, and \u201cEveryone knows that false things are\nbeing said,\u201d that is, the speaker knows that the hearer knows\nthat the speaker is being untruthful, then the speaker does not\nbelieve that she is in a warranting context. According to L14, the\nspeaker is not lying. However, it is arguable that in both the student\nand the witness cases, \u201cEveryone knows that false things are\nbeing said,\u201d and hence, that the speaker does not believe that\nhe is in a warranting context. If this is so, then according to L14,\nneither the student nor the witness is lying.\nRoy Sorensen agrees with Carson that lying does not require an\nintention to deceive, and that there can be non-deceptive\n\u201cbald-faced\u201d lies (Sorensen 2007) and\n\u201cknowledge-lies\u201d (Sorensen 2010). However, he rejects L12,\nsince it entails that one cannot lie when the falsity of what one is\nstating is common knowledge: \u201cCarson\u2019s definition of lying\ndoes not relieve the narrowness. The concept of warrant is not broad\nenough to explain how we can lie in the face of common knowledge. One\ncan warrant p only if p might be the case. When the\nfalsehood of p is common knowledge, no party to the common\nknowledge can warrant p because p is epistemically\nimpossible\u201d (Carson 2007, 254). According to Sorensen, a\nnegotiator who tells \u201ca falsehood that will lead to better\ncoordination between buyer and seller\u201d is telling a\nbald-faced lie (Sorensen 2007, 262).\nSorensen defines lying as follows: \u201cLying is just asserting\nwhat one does not believe\u201d (Sorensen 2007, 256). It is a\ncondition on telling a lie that one makes an assertion. Sorensen\ndifferentiates between assertions and non-assertions according to\n\u201cnarrow plausibility\u201d: \u201cTo qualify as an assertion,\na lie must have narrow plausibility. Thus, someone who only had access\nto the assertion might believe it. This is the grain of truth behind\n\u2018Lying requires the intention to deceive.\u2019 Bald-faced lies\nshow that assertions do not need to meet a requirement of wide\nplausibility, that is, credibility relative to one\u2019s total\nevidence\u201d (Sorensen 2007, 255).\nSorensen provides, as examples of assertions, and hence, lies, the\nservant of a maestro telling an unwanted female caller that the sounds\nshe hears over the phone are not the maestro and that the servant is\nmerely \u201cdusting the piano keys,\u201d and a doctor in an Iraqi\nhospital during the Iraq war telling a journalist who can see patients\nin the ward in uniforms that \u201cI see no uniforms\u201d (Sorensen\n2007, 253). The claim that these are assertions, however, and\ntherefore lies, is controversial (cf. Keiser 2015). These statements\nneither express the speaker\u2019s belief, nor aim to affect the\nbelief of the addressee in any way, since their falsehood is common\nknowledge (cf. Williams 2002, 74). As it has been said:\n\u201cSorensen does not offer a definition of asserting a proposition\n(with necessary and sufficient conditions)\u2026 To the extent that\nhe does not fully analyze the concept of assertion, Sorensen\u2019s\ndefinition of lying is unclear\u201d (Carson 2010, 36). It may be\nargued against Sorensen that the \u201cutterances in question are not\nassertions\u201d (Keiser 2015, 12), and hence, on his own account, fail to\nbe lies.\nDon Fallis also holds that it is possible to lie without intending\nto deceive. He has also defended the assertion condition for lying:\n\u201cyou lie when you assert something that you believe to\nbe false\u201d (Fallis 2009, 33). He has held that you assert\nsomething when you you make a statement and you believe that you are in\na situation in which the Gricean norm of conversation, \u2018Do not\nsay what you believe to be false,\u2019 is in effect. His definition\nof lying was thus as follows:\n\nYou lie to x if and only if (i) you state\nthat p to x, (2) you believe that you make this\nstatement in a context where the following norm of conversation is in\neffect: Do not make statements that you believe to be false, and (iii)\nyou believe that p is false.  (Fallis 2009, 34).\n\nCounterexamples to this definition\n(Pruss 2012; Faulkner 2013; Stokke 2013a) have prompted a revision of\nthis definition in order to accommodate these counterexamples:\n\n(L15)\nYou lie if and only if you say that p, you\nbelieve that p is false (or at least that p will be\nfalse if you succeed in communicating that p), and you intend\nto violate the norm of conversation against communicating something\nfalse by communicating that p (Fallis 2012, 569)\n\n(L16)\nYou lie if and only if you say that p, you believe that\np is false (or at least that p will be false if you succeed in\ncommunicating that p), and you intend to communicate something\nfalse by communicating that p. (Fallis 2012, 569)\n\n\n\nBoth L15 and L16 are able to accommodate the following\ncounterexample to the earlier definition: \u201cwhen Marc Antony said\nto the Roman people, \u2018Brutus is an honorable man\u2019 \u2026\nthe citizens of Rome know that (a) Antony did not believe that Brutus\nwas an honorable man, that (b) Antony was subject to a norm against\nsaying things that he believed to be false, and that (c) Antony had\nbeen a cooperative participant in the conversation so far. Thus, they\nwere led to conclude that Antony was flouting the norm in\norder to communicate something other than what he literally uttered. In\nfact, the best explanation of his statement was that he wanted to\ncommunicate the exact opposite of what he literally uttered\u201d\n(Fallis 2012, 567). Since Antony does not intend to violate the norm of\nconversation against communicating something that he believes to be\nfalse (that Brutus is an honorable man) by saying \u201cBrutus is an\nhonorable man,\u201d or, more simply, since Antony does not intend to\ncommunicate something false with his untruthful statement, it follows\nthat Antony is not lying. However, in the case of a guilty witness,\nTony, against whom there is overwhelming evidence, who says \u201cI\ndid not do it,\u201d without the intention that anyone believe him, he\ndoes intend to violate the norm of conversation against communicating\nsomething that he believes to be false (that he did not do it) by\nsaying \u201cI did not do it,\u201d or, more simply, he does intend\nto communicate something believed-false with his untruthful statement,\neven though he does not intend that anyone believe this.\n\n\nIt has been contended that non-deceptive liars do not intend to\ncommunicate anything believed-false with their untruthful statements,\nand, indeed, may even intend to communicate something believed-true\nwith their untruthful statements (Dynel 2011, 151). Fallis rejects the\nclaim that non-deceptive liars do not intend to communicate anything\nbelieved-false, even if they intend to communicate something\nbelieved-true:\nBald-faced liars might want to communicate something\ntrue. For instance, Tony may be trying to communicate to the police\nthat that they will never convict him. But that does not mean that he\ndoes not also intend to communicate something false in violation of\nthe norm. He wants what he actually said to be understood and accepted\nfor purposes of the conversation. It is not as if \u201cI did not do\nit\u201d is simply a euphemism for \u201cYou\u2019ll never take me\nalive, coppers!\u201d (Fallis 2012, 572 n 24)\nHowever, in the case of polite untruths, such as \u201cMadam is\nnot at home,\u201d the untruthful statement is simply a euphemism:\n\u201cFor example, the words \u201dShe is not at home,\u201c\ndelivered by a servant or a relative at the door, have become a mere\neuphemism for indisposition or disinclination\u201d (Isenberg 1973,\n256). In the case of polite untruths, it seems, there is no intention\nto communicate anything believed-false. In the case of the servant who\ntells the female caller, \u201cI\u2019m dusting the piano\nkeys,\u201d or the Iraqi doctor who tells the journalist \u201cI see\nno uniforms,\u201d or the negotiator who tells the other negotiator\n\u201cThat is the highest I can go,\u201d or the person living in\nthe totalitarian state who makes the pro-state utterance, it is also\narguable that there is no intention to communicate anything\nbelieved-false. If this is true, then there is some support for the\nclaim that non-deceptive liars do not intend to communicate anything\nbelieved-false with their untruthful statements, and hence, that they\nare not lying according to L15 or L16.\n\n\nAndreas Stokke also holds that it is possible to lie without\nintending to deceive. He has also defended the assertion condition for\nlying: \u201cyou lie when you assert something you believe to be\nfalse\u201d (Stokke 2013a, 33). According to Stokke, to \u201cassert\nthat p is to say that p and thereby propose that\np become common ground\u201d (Stokke 2013a, 47). A\nproposition, p, becomes common ground in a group \u201cif all\nmembers accept (for the purpose of the conversation) that p,\nand all believe that all believe that all accept that p,\netc.\u201d (Stokke 2013a, 49, quoting Stalnaker 2002, 716). Stokke thus\ndefines lying as follows:\n\n(L17)\nx lies to y if and only if  \u2026\nx says that p to y, and \u2026 x\nproposes that p become common ground, and \u2026 x\nbelieves that p is false. (Stokke 2013a, 49)\n\nIn the case of a speaker making an ironic untruthful statement,\nthe speaker does not propose that the believed-false proposition\n(e.g., \u201cBrutus is an honorable man\u201d) become common ground\n(Stokke 2013a, 50). However, in the case of a non-deceptive liar, the\nspeaker does propose that the believed-false proposition (e.g.,\n\u201cI did not cheat\u201d) become common ground (Stokke 2013a,\n52). The fact that in the case of a non-deceptive lie it is common\nknowledge that what the speaker is saying is (believed to be) false\ndoes not alter the fact that the speaker is proposing that the\nbelieved-falsehood become common ground. Indeed, even if the\n(believed) truth is initially common ground, before the speaker\nproposes that the believed-falsehood become common ground, it is still\nthe case that the non-deceptive liar is proposing to \u201cupdate the\ncommon ground with her utterance\u201d (Stokke 2013a, 54). For\nexample, in the case of the student and the dean, \u201cThe student\nwants herself and the Dean to mutually accept that she did not\nplagiarize\u201d (Stokke 2013a, 54).\nIt is possible to argue that Stokke\u2019s account of assertion,\nand hence L17, is faced with a dilemma when it comes to non-deceptive\nlies. Either, in the case of a non-deceptive lie, the speaker does\npropose that the believed-false proposition become common ground, but\nbecoming common ground is too weak to count as asserting, or becoming\ncommon ground is strong enough to count as asserting, but, in the case\nof a non-deceptive lie, the speaker does not propose that the\nbelieved-false proposition become common ground. Stokke considers\nStalnaker\u2019s example of a guest at a party saying to another\nguest, \u201cThe man drinking a martini is a philosopher,\u201d and\nof the two guests proceeding to talk about the philosopher, when it is\ncommon knowledge that the drink in question is not a martini. About\nthis example Stalnaker says: \u201cperhaps it is mutually recognized\nthat it is not a martini, but mutually recognized that both parties\nare accepting that it is a martini. The pretense will be\nrational if accepting the false presupposition is an efficient way to\ncommunicate something true\u201d (Stalnaker 2002, 718). However, if\nproposing that a believed-false proposition become common ground can\nmean engaging in and sustaining a \u201cpretence,\u201d possibly in\norder to communicate truths, then it is not clear that this counts as\nmaking an assertion (cf. Keiser 2015). Hence, a non-deceptive liar may\nbe proposing that her believed-false proposition become common ground\nwithout this being an act of making an assertion. But this means that\nshe is not lying, according to L17. Alternatively, if proposing that a\nbelieved-false proposition become common ground means something more\nthan this, such that the speaker intends or wants herself and her\nhearer \u201cto mutually accept\u201d her believed-false\nproposition, then it is not clear that a non-deceptive liar intends or\nwants this. If this is correct, then non-deceptive lies fail to be\nlies according to L17. \n",
