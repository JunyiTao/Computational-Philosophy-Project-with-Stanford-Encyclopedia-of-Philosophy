    "preamble": "\n\nThe term \u201clogical construction\u201d was used by Bertrand\nRussell to describe a series of similar philosophical theories\nbeginning with the 1901 \u201cFrege-Russell\u201d definition of\nnumbers as classes and continuing through his\n\u201cconstruction\u201d of the notions of space, time and matter\nafter 1914. Philosophers since the 1920s have argued about the\nsignificance of \u201clogical construction\u201d as a method in\nanalytic philosophy and proposed various ways of interpreting\nRussell\u2019s notion. Some were inspired to develop their own\nprojects by examples of constructions. Russell\u2019s notion of\nlogical construction influenced both Carnap\u2019s project of\nconstructing the physical world from experience and Quine\u2019s\nnotion of explication, and was a model for the use of set\ntheoretic reconstructions in formal philosophy later in the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nIt was only when looking back on his work, in the programmatic 1924\nessay \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d, that Russell first described\nvarious logical definitions and philosophical analyses as\n\u201clogical constructions\u201d. He listed as examples the\nFrege-Russell definition of numbers as classes, the theory of definite\ndescriptions, the construction of matter from sense data and then\nseries, ordinal numbers and real numbers. Because of the particular\nnature of Russell\u2019s use of \u201ccontextual\u201d definitions\nof expressions for classes, and the distinctive character of the\ntheory of definite descriptions, he regularly called the expressions\nfor such entities \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d and the entities\nthemselves \u201clogical fictions\u201d.\n\nLogical constructions differ in whether they involve explicit\ndefinitions or contextual definitions, and in the extent to which\ntheir result should be described as showing that the constructed\nobject is a mere \u201cfiction\u201d. Russell\u2019s 1901\ndefinition of numbers as classes of equinumerous classes is\nstraightforwardly a case of constructing one sort of entity as a class\nof others with an explicit definition. This was followed by the theory\nof definite descriptions in 1905 and the \u201cno-classes\u201d\ntheory for defining classes in Principia Mathematica in 1910,\nboth of which involved the distinctive technique of contextual\ndefinition. In a contextual definition apparent singular terms (either\ndefinite descriptions or class terms) are eliminated through rules for\ndefining the entire sentences in which they occur. Constructions which\nare like those using contextual definitions are generally called\n\u201cincomplete symbols\u201d, while those like the theory of\nclasses are called \u201cfictions.\u201d Russell included the\nconstruction of matter, space and time as classes of sense data at the\nend of his 1924 list. The main problem for interpreting the notion of\nlogical construction is to understand what these various examples have\nin common, and how the construction of matter is comparable to either\nof the early constructions of numbers as classes or the theory of\ndefinite descriptions and \u201cno-classes\u201d theory of classes.\nNone of the expressions \u201cfiction\u201d, \u201cincomplete\nsymbol\u201d or even \u201cconstructed from\u201d seems appropriate\nfor an analysis of the fundamental features of the familiar physical\nworld and the material objects that occupy it.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Honest Toil\n\nThe earliest construction on Russell\u2019s 1924 list is the famous\n\u201cFrege/Russell definition\u201d of numbers as classes of\nequinumerous classes from 1901 (Russell 1993, 320). The definition\nfollows the example of the definitions of the notions of limit and\ncontinuity that were proposed for the calculus in the preceding\ncentury. Russell did not rest content with adopting the Peano-Dedekind\naxioms as the basis for the theory of the natural numbers and then\nshowing how the properties of the numbers could be logically deduced\nfrom those axioms. Instead, he defined the basic notions of\n\u201cnumber\u201d , \u201csuccessor\u201d and \u201c0\u201d and\nproposed to show, with carefully chosen definitions of their basic\nnotions in terms of logical notions, that those axioms could be\nderived from principles of logic alone. \n\nRussell defined natural numbers as classes of equinumerous classes.\nAny pair, a class with two members, can be put into a one to\none correspondence with any other, hence all pairs are \nequinumerous. The number two is then identified with the\nclass of all pairs. The relation between equinumerous classes when\nthere is such a one to one mapping relating them is called\n\u201csimilarity\u201d. Similarity is defined solely in terms of\nlogical notions of quantifiers and identity. With the natural numbers\nso defined, Peano axioms can be derived by logical means alone. After\nnatural numbers, Russell adds \u201cseries, ordinal numbers and real\nnumbers\u201d (1924, 166) to his list of constructions, and then\nconcludes with the construction of matter.\n\nRussell credits A. N. Whitehead with the solution to the problem of\nthe relation of sense data to physics that he adopted in 1914:\n\n\nI have been made aware of the importance of this problem by my friend\nand collaborator Dr Whitehead, to whom are due almost all the\ndifferences between the views advocated here and those suggested in\nThe Problems of Philosophy. I owe to him the definition of\npoints, and the suggestion for the treatment of instants and\n\u201cthings,\u201d and the whole conception of the world of physics\nas a construction rather than an inference. (Russell\n1914b, vi)\n\n\nIt is only later, in an essay in which Russell reflected on his\nphilosophy that he also described his earlier logical proposals as\n\u201clogical constructions.\u201d The first specific formulation of\nthis method of replacing inference with construction as a general\nmethod in philosophy is in the essay \u201cLogical\nAtomism\u201d:\n\n\nOne very important heuristic maxim which Dr. Whitehead and I found, by\nexperience, to be applicable in mathematical logic, and have since\napplied to various other fields, is a form of Occam\u2019s Razor.\nWhen some set of supposed entities has neat logical properties, it\nturns out, in a great many instances, that the supposed entities can\nbe replaced by purely logical structures composed of entities which\nhave not such neat properties. In that case, in interpreting a body of\npropositions hitherto believed to be about the supposed entities, we\ncan substitute the logical structures without altering any of the\ndetail of the body of propositions in question. This is an economy,\nbecause entities with neat logical properties are always inferred, and\nif the propositions in which they occur can be interpreted without\nmaking this inference, the ground for the inference fails, and our\nbody of propositions is secured against the need of a doubtful step.\nThe principle may be stated in the form: \u2018Whenever possible,\nsubstitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to\nunknown entities\u2019. (Russell 1924, 160)\n\n\nRussell was referring to logical constructions in this frequently\nquoted passage from his Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy. He objects to introducing entities with implicit\ndefinitions, that is, as being those things that obey certain axioms\nor \u201cpostulates\u201d:\n\n\nThe method of \u2018postulating\u2019 what we want has many\nadvantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest\ntoil. Let us leave them to others and proceed with our honest toil.\n(Russell 1919, 71)\n\n\nHe charges that we need a demonstration that there are any objects\nwhich satisfy those axioms. The \u201ctoil\u201d here is the work of\nformulating definitions of the numbers so that they can be shown to\nsatisfy the axioms using logical inference alone.\n\nThe description of logical constructions as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d derives from the use of contextual definitions that\nprovide an analysis or substitute for each sentence in which a defined\nsymbol may occur. The definition does not give an explicit definition,\nsuch as an equation with the defined expression on one side that is\nidentified with a definiendum on the other, or a universal\nstatement giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the\napplication of the term in isolation. The connection between being a\nfiction and expressed by an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d can be\nseen in Russell\u2019s constructions of finite cardinal and ordinal\nnumbers by means of the theory of classes. That\n\u201cno-classes\u201d theory, via the contextual definitions for\nclass terms, makes all the numbers \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d,\nand so numbers can be seen as \u201clogical fictions\u201d.\n\nThe notions of construction and logical fiction appear together in\nthis account from Russell\u2019s \u201cPhilosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d lectures:\n\n\nYou find that a certain thing which has been set up as a metaphysical\nentity can either be assumed dogmatically to be real, and then you\nwill have no possible argument either for its reality or against its\nreality; or, instead of doing that, you can construct a logical\nfiction having the same formal properties, or rather having formally\nanalogous formal properties to those of the supposed metaphysical\nentity and itself composed of empirically given things, and the\nlogical fiction can be substituted for your supposed metaphysical\nentity and will fulfill all the scientific purposes that anyone can\ndesire. (Russell 1918, 144)\n\n\nIncomplete symbols, descriptions, classes and logical fictions are\nidentified with each other and then with the \u201cfamiliar objects\nof daily life\u201d in the following passage from earlier in the\nlectures:\n\n\nThere are a great many other sorts of incomplete symbols besides\ndescriptions. There are classes\u2026 and relations taken in\nextension, and so on. Such aggregations of symbols are really the same\nas what I call \u201clogical fictions\u201d, and they embrace\npractically all the familiar objects of daily life: tables, chairs,\nPiccadilly, Socrates, and so on. Most of them are either classes, or\nseries, or series of classes. In any case they are all incomplete\nsymbols, i.e. they are aggregations that only have a meaning in use\nand do not have any meaning in themselves. (Russell 1918, 122)\n\n\nIn what follows these various features of logical constructions will\nbe disentangled. The result appears to be a connected series of\nanalyses sharing at least a family resemblance with each other. The\ncommon feature is that in each case some formal or \u201cneat\u201d\nproperties of objects that had to be postulated in axioms before could\nnow be derived as logical consequences of definitions. The replaced\nentities are variously \u201cfictions\u201d, \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d or simply \u201cconstructions\u201d depending on the\nform that the definitions take.\n2. Logical Analysis and Logical Construction\n\nIt would be a mistake to see Russell\u2019s logical constructions as\nthe product of the converse operation of a method that begins with\nlogical analysis. Analysis was indeed the distinctive method of\nRussell\u2019s realist and atomistic philosophy with the method of\nconstruction appearing only later. Russell\u2019s new philosophy was\nself-consciously in opposition to the Hegelianism prevailing in\nphilosophy at Cambridge at the end of the nineteenth century (Russell\n1956, 11\u201313). Russell first needed to defend the process of\nanalysis, and to argue against the view of the idealists that complex\nentities are in fact \u201corganic unities\u201d and that any\nanalysis of these unities loses something, as the slogan was\n\u201canalysis is falsification\u201d. (1903, \u00a7439) The subject\nof our analysis is reality, rather than merely our own ideas: \n\n\nAll complexity is conceptual in the sense that it is due to a whole\ncapable of logical analysis, but is real in the sense that it has no\ndependence on the mind, but only upon the nature of the object. Where\nthe mind can distinguish elements, there must be different elements to\ndistinguish; though, alas! there are often different elements which\nthe mind does not distinguish. (1903, \u00a7439)\n\n\nAs ultimate constituents of reality are what is discovered by logical\nanalysis, logical construction cannot be the converse operation, for\nundoing the analysis by putting things back together only returns us\nto the complex entities with which we began. What then is the point of\nconstructing what has already been analyzed? \n\nThe distinction made here between analysis and construction\ndeliberately side-steps an important discussion among scholars of\nFrege and Russell about the nature of analysis. Frege held, in his\nFoundations of Arithmetic (1884, \u00a764), that a\nproposition about identity of numbers could be also analyzed as one\nabout the similarity of classes. He describes this as\n\u201crecarving\u201d one and the same content in different ways.\nLater Frege asserted that the same thought could be viewed as the\nresult of the application of a function to an argument in different\nways. As the logical form of a thought is the result of the\napplication of concepts to arguments, this means that distinct logical\nforms are assigned to the same thought. To resolve the apparent\nconflict with Frege\u2019s famous thesis of \ncompositionality, that a thought is built up from its\nconstituents in a fashion that by and large follows its syntactic\nform, Michael Dummett (1981, chapter 15) distinguishes two notions of\nanalysis in Frege, one as \u201canalysis\u201d proper, the other as\n\u201cdecomposition\u201d. Peter Hylton (2005, 43) argues that there\nis a problematic notion of analysis in Russell, with it being very\ndifficult to say that sentences containing definite descriptions have\nthe complicated quantificational structures assigned to them in\n\u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905) as their \u201creal\nstructure\u201d. Michael Beaney, in his introduction to (2007, 8)\ngives the names \u201cdecompositional\u201d and\n\u201ctransformative\u201d to two kinds of analysis in his\nintroduction to papers that discuss the significance of this\ndistinction for Russell. James Levine claims that in fact the first\nform of analysis, by which the project is to find the ultimate\nconstituents of propositions, belongs to an early project of\n\u201cMoorean Analysis\u201d that Russell abandoned early. Indeed,\nby the time of the account of numbers as classes of equinumerous\nclasses, Russell had already adopted what Levine calls\n\u201cRussell\u2019s Post-Peano Analysis \u201d. \n\nThis debate is certainly relevant to the study of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy, and its connections with Russell\u2019s role as a founder\nof Analytic Philosophy as a movement, but it is perhaps out of keeping\nwith Russell\u2019s own use of the terminology of\n\u201canalysis\u201d. While Peter Strawson, in his \u201cOn\nReferring\u201d (1950) makes numerous allusions to Russell\u2019s\n\u201canalysis\u201d of definite descriptions, in fact the term does\nnot appear in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d. Russell refers to his\n\u201ctheory\u201d of descriptions, and acknowledges that it is not\na proposal that will be recognized immediately as what we have always\nmeant by such sentences, but instead says of his somewhat complicated\nuse of quantifiers and identity symbols that: \n\nThis may seem a somewhat incredible interpretation: but I am not a\npresent giving reasons, I am merely stating the theory. (Russell 1905,\n482)\n\n\nHe then goes on to defend his theory by \u201cdealing\u201d with the\nthree puzzles including the famous example of whether \u201cThe\npresent King of France is bald\u201d is true or false. At no point\ndoes he appeal to what a speaker may have in mind upon uttering one of\nthese sentences. As a result of these facts, it seems that\nRussell\u2019s methodology is best understood by analogy with the\nlogical approach to scientific theories. On this model the result of\n\u201clogical analysis\u201d will be the definitions and primitive\npropositions or axioms from which the laws of a formalized scientific\ntheory can be derived by logical inference. The reduction of one\ntheory to another consists of rewriting the axioms of the target\ntheory using the language of the reducing theory, and then proving\nthem as theorems of that reducing theory. Construction, then, is best\nseen as the process of choosing definitions so that previously\nprimitive statements can be derived as theorems. (See Hager 1994 and\nRussell 1924.)\n\nThis picture fits best with this linguistically oriented notion of\n\u201ctheory construction\u201d rather than the project of\nphilosophical analysis. It also follows the use of the notion of\nconstruction in the tradition of mathematics. Euclid prefaces each\ndemonstration with a \u201cconstruction\u201d of a figure that\nfeatures in the following proof. Gottlob Frege begins every proof in\nhis Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1893) with an\n\u201cAnalysis\u201d, which informally explains the notions used in\nthe theorems and the strategy of the derivation, followed by the\nactual, gapless proof, which is called the \u201cConstruction\u201d.\nHistorically, then, there is no notion of a construction as a\nsynthetic stage following an analytic stage as two processes of a\ncomparable nature, but leading in opposite directions.\n\nEven when described in terms of stages of theory construction,\nanalysis and logical construction are not simply converse operations.\nRussell stresses that the objects discovered and distinguished in\nanalysis are \u201creal\u201d as are their differences from each\nother. Thus there is a constraint on the \u201cchoice\u201d of\ndefinitions and primitive propositions with which to begin. The\nrelationships between a deductive system and a realistic ontology\ndiffer among the various cases that Russell lists as examples of\nlogical constructions. Propositions and \u201ccomplexes\u201d such\nas facts are analyzed in order to find the real objects and relations\nof which they are composed. A logical construction, on the other hand,\nresults in a theory from which truths follow by logical inferences.\nThe truths that are part of a deductive system resulting from logical\nconstruction are only \u201creconstructions\u201d of some of the\n\u201cpre-theoretic\u201d truths that are to be analyzed. It is only\ntheir deductive relations, in particular their deducibility from the\naxioms of the theory, that are relevant to the success of a\nconstruction. Logical constructions do not capture all of the features\nof the pre-theoretic entities with which one begins.\n\nMuch of the attention to logical construction has focused on whether\nit is in fact a unified methodology for philosophy that will introduce\na \u201cscientific method in philosophy\u201d as Russell says in the\nsubtitle of (Russell 1914b). Commentators from Fritz (1952) through\nSainsbury (1979) have denied that Russell\u2019s various\nconstructions fit into a unified methodology, as well as questioning\nthe applicability of the language of \u201cfiction\u201d and\n\u201cincomplete symbol\u201d to all examples. Below it will be\nshown how, nevertheless, constructions do fall into several natural\nfamilies that are described by various of these terms with a\nconsiderable degree of accuracy.\n3. Natural Numbers\n\nRussell\u2019s definition of natural numbers as classes of\nsimilar, or equinumerous, classes, first published in\n(Russell 1901), was his first logical construction, and was the model\nfor those that followed. Similar classes are those that can be mapped\none to one onto each other by some relation. The notion of a\n\u201cone-to-one relation\u201d is defined with logical notions:\n\\(\\rR\\) is one-one when for every \\(x\\) there is a unique \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(x \\rR y\\), and for every such \\(y\\) in the range of \\(\\rR\\)\nthere is a unique such \\(x\\). These notions of existence and\nuniqueness come from logic, and so the notion of number is thus\ndefined solely in terms of classes and of logical notions. Russell\nannounced the goal of his logicist program in The Principles of\nMathematics: \u201cthe proof that all pure mathematics deals\nexclusively with concepts definable in terms of a very small number of\nfundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions are\ndeducible from a very small number of fundamental logical\nprinciples\u2026\u201d (Russell 1903, xv). If  class\n is also shown to be a logical notion, then this definition would\ncomplete the logicist program for the mathematics of natural numbers.\n\n\nGiuseppe Peano (Peano 1889, 94) had stated axioms for elementary\narithmetic, which were later formulated by Russell (1919, 8) as:\n\n0 is a number.\nThe successor of any number is a number.\nNo two numbers have the same successor.\n0 is not the successor of any number.\nIf a property belongs to 0 and belongs to the successor of \\(x\\)\nwhenever it belongs to \\(x\\), then it belongs to every number.\n\n\nFor Peano these were the axioms of number, which, along with axioms of\nclasses and propositions, describe the properties of these entities\nand lead to the derivation of theorems that express the other\nimportant properties of those entities.\n\nRichard Dedekind (Dedekind 1887) had also listed the properties of\nnumbers with similar looking axioms, using the notion of\nchain, an infinite sequence of sets, each a subset of the\nnext, that is well ordered and has the structure of the natural\nnumbers. Dedekind then proves that the principle of induction (Axiom 5\nabove) holds for chains. (See entry on\n Dedekind).\n Although Russell finds it \u201cmost remarkable that\nDedekind\u2019s previous assumptions suffice to demonstrate this\ntheorem\u201d (Russell 1903, \u00a7236), he compares the two\napproaches, of Peano and Dedekind, with respect to simplicity and\ntheir differing ways of treating mathematical induction, and concludes\nthat:\n\n\nBut from a purely logical point of view, the two methods seem equally\nsound; and it is to be remembered that, with the logical theory of\ncardinals, both Peano\u2019s and Dedekind\u2019s axioms become\ndemonstrable. (Russell 1903, \u00a7241)\n\n\nIt was Peano and Dedekind that Russell had in mind when he later\nspeaks of \u201cthe method of \u2018postulating\u2019\u201d when\nhe compares the \u201cadvantages\u201d of their method over\nconstruction as those of theft over honest toil.\n\nTo complete his project Russell needed to find definitions and some\n\u201cvery small number of fundamental logical principles\u201d\n(Russell 1903, xv) and then produce the required derivations.\nFinding an adequate definition of classes with the \u201cno-classes\ntheory\u201d and the principles of logic needed to derive the\nproperties of numbers and classes was only completed with\nPrincipia Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313).\nThis construction of numbers was a clear example of defining entities\nas classes of others so as to be able to prove certain properties as\ntheorems of logic rather than having to rest with the theft of\nhypotheses. With the device of contextual definition from the theory\nof descriptions Russell then eliminated classes too, taking as\nfundamental the logical notion of a propositional function and so\nshowing that the principles of classes where a part of logic. \n4. Definite Descriptions\n\nDefinite descriptions are the logical constructions that Russell has\nin mind when when he describes them as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d. The notion of a \u201clogical fiction\u201d, on the\nother hand, applies most straightforwardly to classes. Other\nconstructions, such as the notions of the domain and range of a\nrelation, and of one to one mappings that are crucial to the\ndevelopment of arithmetic, are only \u201cincomplete\u201d in an\nindirect sense due to their being defined as classes of a certain\nsort, which are in turn constructions.\n\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions was introduced in his\npaper \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (Russell 1905) published in the\njournal Mind. Russell\u2019s theory provides the logical\nform of sentences of the form \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(G\\)\u2019 where\n\u2018The \\(F\\)\u2019 is called a definite description in\ncontrast with \u2018An \\(F\\)\u2019 which is an indefinite\ndescription. The analysis proposes that \u2018The \\(F\\) is\n\\(G\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018There is one and only one \\(F\\)\nand it is \\(G\\)\u2019. Given this account, the logical properties of\ndescriptions can be deduced using just the logic of quantifiers and\nidentity. Among the theorems in \u221714 of Principia\nMathematica are those showing that, (1) if there is just one\n\\(F\\) then \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019 is true, and if there is\nnot, then \u2018The \\(F\\) is \\(G\\)\u2019 is always false and then,\n(2) if the \\(F = \\text{the } G\\), and the \\(F\\) is \\(H\\), then the\n\\(G\\) is \\(H\\). These theorems show that proper (uniquely referring)\ndescriptions behave like proper names, the \u201csingular\nterms\u201d of logic. Some of these results have been controversial\n\u2014 Strawson (1950) claimed that an utterance of \u2018The\npresent King of France is bald\u2019 should be truth valueless since\nthere is no present king of France, rather than \u201cplainly\u201d\nfalse, as Russell\u2019s theory predicts. Russell\u2019s reply to\nStrawson in (Russell 1959, 239\u201345) is helpful for understanding\nRussell\u2019s philosophical methodology of which logical\nconstruction is just a part. It is, however, by assessing the logical\nconsequences of a construction that it is to be judged, and so\nStrawson challenged Russell in an appropriate way. \n\nThe theory of descriptions introduces Russell\u2019s notion of\nincomplete symbol. This arises because no definitional\nequivalent of \u2018The F\u2019 appears in the formal analysis of\nsentences in which the description occurs. The sentence \u2018The\n\\(F\\) is \\(H\\)\u2019 becomes: \n\\[\n\\exists x [ \\forall y (Fy \\leftrightarrow y=x) \\ \\&\\  Hx ]\n\\]\n\n\nof which no subformula, or even a contiguous segment, can be\nidentified as the analysis of \u2018The F\u2019. Similarly, talk\nabout \u201cthe average family\u201d as in \u201cThe average family\nhas 2.2 children\u201d becomes \u201cThe number of children in\nfamilies divided by the number of families = 2.2\u201d. There is no\nsegment of that formula that corresponds to \u201cthe average\nfamily\u201d. Instead we are given a procedure for eliminating such\nexpressions from contexts in which they occur, hence this is another\nexample of an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d and the definition of an\naverage is an example of a \u201ccontextual definition.\u201d \n\nIt is arguable that Russell\u2019s definition of definite\ndescriptions was the most prominent early example of the philosophical\ndistinction between surface grammatical form and logical form, and\nthus marks the beginnings of linguistic analysis as a method in\nphilosophy. Linguistic analysis begins by looking past superficial\nlinguistic form to see an underlying philosophical analysis. Frank\nRamsey described the theory of descriptions as a \u201cparadigm of\nphilosophy\u201d (Ramsey 1929, 1). While in itself surely not a model\nfor all philosophy, it was at least a paradigm for the other examples\nof logical constructions that Russell listed when looking back on the\ndevelopment of his philosophy in 1924. The theory of descriptions has\nbeen criticized by some linguists and philosophers who see\ndescriptions and other noun phrases as full-fledged linguistic\nconstituents of sentences, and who see the sharp distinction between\ngrammatical and logical form as a mistake. (See the entry on\n descriptions.)\n\nFollowing Gilbert Ryle\u2019s (1931) influential criticisms of\nMeinong\u2019s theory of non-existent objects, the theory of\ndescriptions has been taken as a model for avoiding ontological\ncommitment to objects, and so logical constructions in general are\noften seen as being chiefly used to eliminate purported entities. In\nfact, that goal is at most peripheral to many constructions. The\nprincipal goal of these constructions is to allow the proof of\npropositions that would otherwise have to be assumed as axioms or\nhypotheses. Nor need the introduction of constructions always result\nin the elimination of problematic entities. Yet other constructions\nshould be seen more as reductions of one class of entity to another,\nor replacements of one notion by a more precise, mathematical,\nsubstitute.\n5. Classes\n\nRussell\u2019s \u201cNo-Class\u201d theory of classes from\n\u221720 of Principia Mathematica provides a contextual\ndefinition like that of the theory of definite descriptions. One of\nRussell\u2019s early diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all\nclasses that are not members of themselves was that it showed that\nclasses could not be individuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come\nacross his paradox by applying Cantor\u2019s famous diagonal argument\nto show that there are more classes of individuals than individuals.\nHence, he concluded, classes could not be individuals, and expressions\nfor classes such as \u2018\\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\)\u2019 cannot be the\nsingular terms they appear to be. Inspired by the theory of\ndescriptions, Russell proposed that to say something \\(G\\) of the\nclass of \\(F\\)s, \\(G\\) \\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\), is to say that there is some\n(predicative) property \\(H\\) coextensive with (true of the same things\nas) \\(F\\) such that \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). The restriction to predicative\nproperties, or those which are not defined in terms of quantification\nover other properties, was a consequence of the ramification\nof the theory of types to avoid intensional or \u201cepistemic\u201d\nparadoxes which motivated the theory of types in addition to the set\ntheoretical \u201cRussell\u2019s Paradox\u201d (see Whitehead and\nRussell 1910\u201313, Introduction, Chapter II). These predicative\nproperties are intensional, however, in the sense that two distinct\nproperties might hold of the same objects. (See the entry on the\n notation in Principia Mathematica.)\n That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus\nderivable, rather than postulated. If \\(F\\) and \\(H\\) are coextensive\nthen anything true of \\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\) will be true of \\(\\{x:Hx \\}\\).\nFeatures of classes then follow from the features of the logic of\nproperties.\n\nBecause classes would at first seem to be individuals of some sort,\nbut on analysis are found not to be, Russell speaks of them as\n\u201clogical fictions,\u201d an expression which echoes Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s notion of \u201clegal fictions.\u201d (Hart 1994,\n84) (See entry on\n law and language).\n That a corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d at law was for Bentham\nmerely a fiction that could be cashed out in terms of the notion of\nlegal standing and of limits to the financial liability of real\npersons. Thus any language about such \u201clegal fictions\u201d\ncould be translated in other terms to be about real individuals and\ntheir legal relationships. Because statements attributing a property\nto particular classes are replaced by existential sentences saying\nthat there is some propositional function having that property, this\nconstruction also can be characterized as showing that class\nexpressions, such as \u2018\\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\)\u2019, are incomplete\nsymbols. They are not replaced by some longer formula expressing a\nterm. On the other hand, the definition should not be seen as avoiding\nontological commitment entirely, as showing that something is\nliterally a \u201cfiction\u201d. Rather it shows how to reduce\nclasses to propositional functions. The properties of classes are\nreally properties of propositional functions and for every class said\nto have a property there really is some propositional function having\nthat property.\n6. Series, Ordinal Numbers and Real Numbers\n\nWhitehead and Russell define a series in volume II of\nPrincipia Mathematica at \u2217204.01 as the class\nSer of all relations which is transitive, connected\nand irreflexive. A relation \\(R\\) is transitive when, if\n\\(xRy\\) and \\(yRz\\) then \\(xRz\\). It is connected when for\nany \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for which it is defined, either \\(xRy\\) or\n\\(yRx\\). Finally, an irreflexive relation is one such that\nfor all \\(x\\), it is not the case that \\(xRx\\). Any relation that has\nthose properties forms a series of the things that it\nrelates. Such relations are now called \u201clinear orderings\u201d\nor simply, \u201corderings\u201d. Here the \u201clogical\nconstruction\u201d simply consists of an implicit definition of a\ncertain property of relations. There is certainly no thought that\nseries are merely invented \u201cfictions\u201d, and the symbol\n\u2018Ser\u2019 for them is\n\u201cincomplete\u201d only in that it can be explicitly defined as\nthe intersection of other classes (a class of classes) and classes are\nthemselves \u201cincomplete\u201d.\n\nRussell\u2019s definitions of ordinal numbers and real numbers\nresemble the definitions of natural numbers. Ordinal numbers are a\nspecial case of  relation numbers. Just as a cardinal number\ncan be defined as a class of similar classes where the similarity is\nsimply equinumerosity, the existence of a one to one mapping between\nthe two classes, a relation number is a class of similar classes which\nare ordered by some relation. Ordinal numbers are the relation numbers\nof well-ordered classes. \u201cRelation-Arithmetic\u201d is the\nsubject of Part IV of Volume II of Principia Mathematica,\nchapters \u2217150 to \u2217186. All of the properties of the\narithmetic of ordinal numbers are derived from the more general\narithmetic of relation numbers. Thus, for example, the addition of\nordinal numbers is not commutative. The first infinite ordinal\n\\(\\omega\\) is the relation number of the well-ordered classes similar\nto \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\) etc. The sum \\(1 + \\omega\\) will be the\nrelation number of ordered classes which result from adding one\nelement at the beginning of the ordering, say \\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)\netc., which has the same ordinal number \\(\\omega\\). Thus \\(1 + \\omega\n= \\omega\\). On the other hand, adding an element at the\n\u201cend\u201d of such a well ordered class will give an ordering\nthat is not similar: \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\text{etc.}, 0\\). Consequently,\n\\(1 + \\omega \\ne \\omega + 1\\). On the other hand addition of ordinals,\nand indeed relation numbers in general, is associative, that is,\n\\((\\alpha + \\beta) + \\gamma = \\alpha + (\\beta + \\gamma)\\), which is\nproved with certain restrictions in \u2217174. Ordinal numbers are\nthus defined exactly as natural numbers, as classes of similar\nclasses, in such a way that all the desired theorems can be proved.\nDescribing ordinal numbers as \u201cfictions\u201d,\n\u201cincomplete symbols\u201d and \u201cconstructions\u201d\napplies in the same way as in the case of natural numbers.\n\nThe class of real numbers, \u0398, is defined in Volume III of\nPrincipia Mathematica at \u2217310.01 as consisting of\n\u201cDedekindian series\u201d of rational numbers, which are in\nturn relation numbers of \u201cratios\u201d of natural numbers.\nWhitehead and Russell follow the account of real numbers as\nDedekind cuts of the rational numbers, and only differ from\nmore standard developments of the numbers in contemporary set theory\nby treating rational numbers as relation numbers of a certain sort,\nrather than ordered pairs of integers (the \u201cnumerator\u201d and\n\u201cdenominator\u201d). Like the construction of relation numbers\nas classes of similar classes, the \u201clogical construction\u201d\nof real numbers differs from the theory of definite descriptions and\nclasses in general in not defining \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d or\nby showing that these numbers are really \u201cfictions\u201d. They\nare best characterized as definitions that allow for the proof of\ntheorems about these numbers that would otherwise have to be\npostulated as axioms. They are the product of the \u201chonest\ntoil\u201d that Russell prefers.\n7. Mathematical Functions\n\nMathematical functions are not mentioned by Russell in the 1924 list\nof \u201clogical constructions\u201d although the analysis of\nmathematical functions is the principal application of the theory of\ndefinite descriptions in PM. The basic \u201cfunctions\u201d of PM\nare propositional functions. The Greek letters \\(\\phi, \\psi, \\theta,\n\\ldots\\) are variables for propositional functions, and, with\nindividual variables \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) go together to form open\nsentences \\(\\phi(x), \\psi(x,y)\\), etc. This is the familiar syntax of\nmodern predicate logic. Mathematical functions, such as the\nsine function and addition, are represented as  term\nforming operators such as \\(\\sin x\\), or \\(x + y\\). In\ncontemporary logic they are symbolized by function letters that are\nfollowed by the appropriate number of arguments, \\(f(x),g(x,y)\\), etc.\nIn chapter \u221730 Whitehead and Russell propose a direct\ninterpretation of such expressions for mathematical functions in terms\nof definite descriptions, which they call \u201cdescriptive\nfunctions\u201d. Consider the relation between a number and its sine,\nthe relation which obtains between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when \\(y = \\sin\nx\\). Call this relation \u201c\\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)\u201d or more\nsimply, \u201c\\(\\bS(x,y)\\)\u201d, as a two-place relation. The\nmathematical function can then be expressed with a definite\ndescription, interpreting our expression \u201cthe sine of\n\\(x\\)\u201d not as \u201c\\(\\sin(x)\\)\u201d, but literally as\n\u201cthe Sine of \\(x\\)\u201d, with a definite description,\nor \u201cthe \\(y\\) such that \\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)\u201d. Using the\nnotation of the theory of definite descriptions, this is \u2018\\((\\iota\nx)\\bS(x,y)\\)\u2019. The effect of\nthis analysis is that Whitehead and Russell can replace all\nexpressions for mathematical functions with definite descriptions\nbased on relations. This definition involves relations in\nextension, which are represented with upper case Roman letters\nand with the relation symbol between the variables. The definition in\nPM is: \u221730.01. \\(R`y = (\\iota x)xRy\\), with the notation\n\\(R`y\\) to be read as \u201cthe \\(R\\) of \\(y\\).\u201d As with the\ntheory of descriptions, the result of this definition is to facilitate\nthe proofs of theorems which capture the logical properties of\nmathematical functions that will be needed in the further work of\nPM.\n\nThe logical analysis of function expressions in PM presents them as a\nspecial case of definite descriptions, \u201cthe \\(R\\) of\n\\(x\\)\u201d. In the Summary of \u221730 we find:\n\nDescriptive functions, like descriptions in general, have no meaning\nin isolation, but only as constituents of propositions. (Whitehead and\nRussell 1910\u201313, 232)\n\n\nMathematical or descriptive functions are thus explicitly included\namong the incomplete symbols of Principia Mathematica.\n8. Propositions and Propositional Functions\n\nIn Principia Mathematica Russell\u2019s multiple\nrelation theory of judgment is introduced by presenting an\nontological vision:\n\n\nThe universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing\nin various relations. (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313, 43)\n\n\nRussell goes on to explain the multiple relation theory of judgment,\nwhich finds the place of propositions in this world of objects and\nqualities standing in relations. (See the entry on\n propositions.)\n \n\nRussell\u2019s multiple relation theory, that he held from 1910 to\naround 1919, argued that the constituents of propositions, say\n\u2018Desdemona loves Cassio\u2019, are unified in a way that does\nnot make it the case that they constitute a fact by themselves. Those\nconstituents occur only in the context of beliefs, say, \u2018Othello\njudges that Desdemona loves Cassio\u2019. The real fact consists of a\nrelation of Belief holding between the constituents Othello,\nDesdemona, and Cassio; \\(B(o,d,L,c)\\). Because one might also have\nbelieved propositions of other structures, such as \\(B(o,F,a)\\) there\nneed to be many such relations \\(B\\), of different\n\u201carities\u201d, or number of arguments, hence the name\n\u201cmultiple relation\u201d theory. Like the construction of\nnumbers, this construction abstracts from what a number of occurrences\nof a belief have in common, namely, a relation between a believer and\nvarious objects in a certain order. The account also makes the\nproposition an incomplete symbol because there is no constituent in\nthe analysis of \u2018\\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\u2019 that\ncorresponds to \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019. As a result Russell concludes\nthat:\n\n\nIt will be seen that, according to the above account, a judgment does\nnot have a single object, namely a proposition, but has several\ninterrelated objects. That is to say, the relation which constitutes\njudgment is not a relation of two terms, namely the judging mind and\nthe proposition, but is a relation of several terms, namely the mind\nand what we call the constituents of the proposition\u2026\n\nOwing to the plurality of the objects of a single judgment, it follows\nthat what we call a \u201cproposition\u201d (in which it is to be\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an \u201cincomplete\u201d symbol; it does not have meaning\nin itself, but requires some supplementation in order to acquire a\ncomplete meaning. (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313,\n43\u201344)\n\n\nAlthough bound variables ranging over propositions hardly occur in\nPrincipia Mathematica (with a prominent exception in\n\u221714.3), it would seem that the whole theory of types is a\ntheory of propositional functions. Yet following on the claim that\npropositions are \u201cnot single entities at all\u201d, Russell\nsays the same for propositional functions. In the Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy, Russell says that propositional\nfunctions are really \u201cnothing\u201d, but \u201cnonetheless\nimportant for that\u201d (Russell 1919, 96). This comment makes best\nsense if we think of propositional functions as somehow constructed by\nabstracting them from their values, which are propositions. The\npropositional function \u201c\\(x\\) is human\u201d is abstracted from\nits values \u201cSocrates is human\u201d, \u201cPlato is\nhuman\u201d, etc. Viewing propositional functions as constructions\nfrom propositions, that are in turn constructions by the multiple\nrelation theory, helps to make sense of certain features of the theory\nof types of propositional functions in Principia Mathematica.\nWe can understand how propositional functions seem to depend on their\nvalues, namely propositions, and how propositions in turn can\nthemselves be logical constructions. The relation of this dependence\nto the theory of types is explained in the Introduction to\nPrincipia Mathematica in terms of the notion of\n\u201cpresupposing\u201d:\n\n\nIt would seem, however, that the essential characteristic of a\nfunction is ambiguity\u2026 We may express this by saying\nthat \u201c\\(\\phi x\\)\u201d ambiguously denotes \\(\\phi a, \\phi b,\n\\phi c,\\) etc., where \\(\\phi a, \\phi b, \\phi c,\\) etc. are the various\nvalues of \u201c\\(\\phi x\\).\u201d \u2026 It will be seen that,\naccording to the above account, the values of a function are\npresupposed by that function, not vice versa. It is sufficiently\nobvious, in any particular case, that a value of a function does not\npresuppose the function. Thus for example the proposition\n\u201cSocrates is human\u201d can be perfectly apprehended without\nregarding it as a value of the function \u201c\\(x\\) is human.\u201d\nIt is true that, conversely, a function can be apprehended without its\nbeing necessary to apprehend its values severally and individually. If\nthis were not the case, no function could be apprehended at all, since\nthe number of values (true and false) of a function is necessarily\nindefinite and there are necessarily possible arguments with which we\nare not acquainted. (Russell 1910\u201313, 39\u201340)\n\n\nThe notion of \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d seems less appropriate\nthan \u201cconstruction\u201d in the case of propositional functions\nand propositions. To classify propositions and even propositional\nfunctions as instances of the same logical phenomenon as definite\ndescriptions requires a considerable broadening of the notion.\n\nThe ontological status of propositions and propositional functions\nwithin Russell\u2019s logic, and in particular, in Principia\nMathematica, is currently the subject of considerable debate. One\ninterpretation, which we might call \u201crealist,\u201d is\nsummarized in this footnote by Alonzo Church in his 1976 study of the\nramified theory of types:\n\n\nThus we take propositions as values of the propositional variables, on\nthe ground that this is what is clearly demanded by the background and\npurpose of Russell\u2019s logic, and in spite of what seems to be an\nexplicit denial by Whitehead and Russell in PM, pp. 43\u201344.\n\nIn fact, Whitehead and Russell make the claim: \u201cthat what we\ncall a \u2018proposition\u2019 (in the sense in which this is\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an \u2018incomplete symbol\u2019 \u2026\u201d They seem\nto be aware that this fragmenting of propositions requires a similar\nfragmenting of propositional functions. But the contextual definition\nor definitions that are implicitly promised by the \u201cincomplete\nsymbol\u201d characterization are never fully supplied, and it is in\nparticular how they would explain away the use of bound propositional\nand functional variables. If some things that are said by Russell in\nIV and V of his Introduction to the second edition may be taken as an\nindication of what is intended, it is probable that the contextual\ndefinitions would not stand scrutiny.\n\nMany passages in [(Russell 1908)] and [(Whitehead and Russell\n1910\u201313)] may be understood as saying or as having the\nconsequence that the values of propositional functions are sentences.\nBut a coherent semantics of Russell\u2019s formalized language can\nhardly be provided on this basis (notice in particular, that, since\nsentences are also substituted for propositional variables, it would\nbe necessary to take sentences as names of sentences.) And since the\npassages in question seem to involve confusions of use and mention or\nkindred confusions that may be merely careless, it is not certain that\nthey are to be regarded as precise statements of a semantics. (Church\n1976, n.4)\n\n\nGregory Landini (1998) has proposed that there is indeed a coherent\nsemantics for propositions and propositional functions in PM, which\ntreats functions and propositions as linguistic entities. Landini\nproposes that this \u201cnominalist semantics\u201d is the intended\ninterpretation of PM and is what remains of Russell\u2019s earlier\n\u201csubstitutional theory.\u201d He argues that Russell was led to\nthis nominalism after first rejecting the reality of classes, then of\npropositional functions, and finally the reality of propositions. This\nrejection, according to Landini, leaves us with only a nominalist\nmetaphysics of individuals and expressions as the interpretation of\nRussell\u2019s logic. See also Cocchiarella (1980), who describes a\n\u201cnominalist semantics\u201d for ramified type theory, but\nrejects it as Russell\u2019s intended interpretation. Sainsbury\n(1979) describes a \u201csubstitutional\u201d interpretation of the\nquantifiers over propositional functions, but combines this with a\ntruth-conditional semantics that does not require the ramification of\nthe theory of types that is central to Russell\u2019s interpretation\nin PM.\n\nPropositions and propositional functions are unlike definite\ndescriptions and classes in that there are no explicit definitions of\nthem in PM. It is unclear what it means to say: a symbol for a\nproposition \u2014 such as a variable \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) \u2014 has\n\u201cno meaning in isolation\u201d, but the meaning can be given\n\u201cin context\u201d. No such contextual definition seems possible\nin a logic in which propositions and propositional functions appear as\nprimitive notions.\n9. The Construction of Matter, Space, and Time\n\nWhether or not they are provided with contextual definitions by\nWhitehead and Russell, logical constructions do not appear as the\nreferents of logically proper names, and so by that account\nconstructions are not a part of the fundamental\n\u201cfurniture\u201d of the world. Early critical discussions of\nconstructions, such as Wisdom (1931), stressed the contrast between\nlogically proper names, which do refer, and constructions, which were\nthus seen as ontologically innocent.\n\nBeginning with The Problems of Philosophy in 1912, Russell\nturned repeatedly to the problem of matter. As has been described by\nOmar Nasim (2008), Russell was stepping into an ongoing discussion of\nthe relation of sense data to matter that was being carried on by T.P.\nNunn (1910), Samuel Alexander (1910), G.F. Stout (1914), and G.E.\nMoore (1914), among others. The participants of this \u201cEdwardian\ncontroversy\u201d, as Nasim terms it, shared a belief that direct\nobjects of perception, with their sensory qualities, were nonetheless\nextra-mental. The concept of matter, then, was the result of a loosely\ndescribed social or psychological \u201cconstruction\u201d, going\nbeyond what was directly perceived. A project shared by the\nparticipants in the controversy was the search for a refutation of\nGeorge Berkeley\u2019s idealism, which would show how the existence\nand real nature of matter can be discovered. In The Problems of\nPhilosophy (Russell 1912) Russell argues that the belief in the\nexistence of matter is a well supported hypothesis that explains our\nexperiences. Matter is known only indirectly, \u201cby\ndescription\u201d, as the cause, whatever it may be, of our sense\ndata, which we directly know by \u201cby acquaintance\u201d. This is\nan example of the sort of hypothesis that Russell contrasts with\nconstruction in the famous passage about \u201ctheft\u201d and\n\u201chonest toil\u201d. Russell saw an analogy between the case of\nsimply hypothesizing the existence of numbers with certain properties,\nthose described by axioms, and hypothesizing the existence of\nmatter.\n\nThe need for some sort of account of the logical features of matter,\nwhat he called \u201cthe problem of matter\u201d, had already\noccupied Russell much earlier. While we distinguish the certain\nknowledge we may have of mathematical entities from the contingent\nknowledge of material objects, Russell says that there are certain\n\u201cneat\u201d features of matter that are just too tidy to have\nturned out by accident. Examples include the most general\nspatiotemporal properties of objects, that no two can occupy the same\nplace at the same time, which he calls \u201cimpenetrability\u201d,\nand so on. In The Principles of Mathematics (Russell 1903,\n\u00a7453) there is a list of these features of matter including\n\u201cindestructibility\u201d, \u201cingenerability\u201d and\n\u201cimpenetrability\u201d, which were all characteristic of the\natomic theory of the day. Russell followed the progression through the\nexact sciences from logic through arithmetic, and then real numbers\nand then to infinite cardinals. There followed a discussion of space\nand time, with the book ending with a last part (VII) on Matter and\nMotion, chapters \u00a753 to \u00a759. In them Russell discusses what\nhe calls \u201crational Dynamics as a branch of pure\nmathematics\u201d (Russell 1903, \u00a7437). This rational\nDynamics, would involve justifying many of the fundamental\nprinciples of physics with pure mathematics alone, from definitions\nthat yield the geometry of space and time and the formal properties of\nits occupants, quantities of matter and energy. In this respect the\nconstruction of matter most resembles the construction of numbers as\nclasses as an effort to replace the \u201ctheft\u201d of postulating\naxioms with the \u201chonest toil\u201d of devising definitions that\nwill validate those postulates. \n\nIn the later project of constructing matter, from 1914 on, beginning\nwith Our Knowledge of the External World (Russell 1914b),\nmaterial objects come to be seen as collections of sense data, then of\n\u201csensibilia\u201d. Sensibilia are potential objects of\nsensation, which, when perceived become \u201csense data\u201d for\nthe perceiver. Influenced by William James, Russell came to defend a\nneutral monism by which matter and minds were both to be\nconstructed from sensibilia, but in different ways. Intuitively, the\nsense data occurring as they do \u201cin\u201d a mind, are material\nto construct that mind, the sense data derived from an object from\ndifferent points of view to construct that object. Russell saw some\nsupport for this in the theory of relativity, and the fundamental\nimportance of frames of reference in the new physics.\n\nIn the passage in Our Knowledge of the External World quoted\nabove, Russell acknowledges that Whitehead initiated the project of\n\u201cconstructing\u201d points and instants of time as classes of\noverlapping events, that is, regions of space and intervals\nof time. Whitehead had developed the logical foundations of theories\nof mathematical physics in his \u201cOn Mathematical Concepts of the\nMaterial World\u201d (Whitehead 1906). There he considered\nalternative definitions based on different conceptions of projective\ngeometry, in which lines can be seen as classes of points, or else\npoints as where lines intersect. Whitehead then went on to propose the\nmethod of  extensive abstraction (Whitehead 1920, Chapter 4)\nwhich follows the construction of numbers as classes of equivalence\nclasses. Whitehead\u2019s project was to construct points of the\nspace-time of relativity theory from nested classes of classes of\nevents. Discussions of difficulties for this project began in the\n1920s, including a variant that Whitehead himself proposed in \nProcess and Reality (1929). See de Laguna (1922), Bostock (2010)\nand Varzi (2021) for the history of these proposals. \n\nRussell first constructed moments of time as classes: \n\nThe assumptions made regarding time-relations in the above are as\nfollows:\n\n\nI. In order to secure that instants form a series, we assume: (a) No\nevent wholly precedes itself. (An \u201cevent\u201d is defined as\nwhatever is simultaneous with something or other.) (b) If one event\nwholly precedes another, and the other wholly precedes a third, then\nthe first wholly precedes the third. (c) If one event wholly precedes\nanother, it is not simultaneous with it. (d) Of two events which are\nnot simultaneous, one must wholly precede the other. \n\nII. In order to secure that the initial contemporaries of a given\nevent should form an instant, we assume: (e) An event wholly after\nsome contemporary of a given event is wholly after some \ninitial contemporary of the given event. \n\nIII. In order to secure that the series of instants shall be compact,\nwe assume: (f) If one event wholly precedes another, there is an event\nwholly after the one and simultaneous with something wholly before the\nother. \n\nThis assumption entails the consequence that if one event covers the\nwhole stretch of time immediately preceding another event, then it\nmust have at least one instant in common with the other event; \ni.e. it is impossible for one event to cease just before another\nbegins. I do not know whether this should be regarded as inadmissable.\nFor a mathematico-logical treatment of the above topics,  cf \nN. Wiener, \u201cA Contribution to the Theory of relative\nposition,\u201d  Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., xvii 5, pp.\n441\u2013449. (Russell 1914b, 120n) \n\n\nSee Anderson (1989) for a discussion of Norbert Wiener\u2019s\ncontribution to this account in (Wiener 1914b). Wiener (1921)\napproached the issue of the sensation of  intensive qualities\nusing the idea of  just noticeable differences  originally\nproposed by Fechner (1860). (See the entry on\n measurement in science.)\n The difference of loudness of sounds, intensity of heat sensations,\nor brightness of lights was previously contrasted with  extensive\nqualities  such as length and weight. Fechner\u2019s idea was\nthat intensive qualities could be seen as composed of parts, detected\nas just noticeable differences, and their number counted to measure\nthe quality. Wiener made use of Russell\u2019s ontology of \nsensibilia, or potential sense data, counting the shortest path\nthrough a space of just noticeable differences. \n10. From Logical Constructions to Measurement Theory\n\nAt just this time, Norman R. Campbell (1920) introduced the ideas of\nwhat is known as Measurement Theory which can be seen as an\nalternative to the logical construction of physical quantities.\nCampbell proposed the  direct measurement of length, for\nexample, by correlating objects with numbers in a scale, say meters,\nthrough performing a number of operations of laying down meter sticks\nuntil the combination is longer than the given object.\nCampbell\u2019s  direct measurement of weight can be\nperformed by placing the measured object on one pan of a balance\nscale, and adding unit weights, say of one gram each, in the other pan\nuntil the pan no longer tilts to the side of the weighed object. In\neach case there is an operation (concatenating measuring rods or\nadding weights to a pan) and a relation (of overlapping with length or\ntipping the scale with weight). \n\nThe logical construction of an extended object in Russell\u2019s\napproach specifies a class of sensibilia that occupy a given region of\nspace. Measurement would thus attribute a quality to that class.\nCampbell\u2019s account of direct measurement, however, is completely\nnon-committal about the nature of the object of measurement, and\nsimply describes the operations and relations that allow one to assign\nnumbers to the values.\n\nIn his summary of Wiener (1921), Henry Kyburg notes that\nWiener\u2019s suggested treatment of measurement did not change the\ndirection of the theory, that is, away from the notion of measurement\nas the assignment of numbers to physical entities in the manner of\nCampbell (1920). Kyburg\u2019s assessment is at Wiener (1976, 86).\nCampbell\u2019s lengthy 1920 book in which he presents his theory of\nmeasurement does not include any references to previous writers, but\ndoes dedicate the book to Russell and with a qualification: \u201cBut\nfor the general train of thought which inspires the whole I can make\nacknowledgement to my masters, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Mr Bertrand\nRussell; but I fear that the latter (at any rate) will think his pupil\nanything but a credit to him.\u201d (Campbell 1920, vii)\n11. Successors to Logical Construction\n\nIn the 1930s Susan Stebbing and John Wisdom, founding what has come to\nbe called the \u201cCambridge School of Analysis,\u201d paid\nconsiderable attention to the notion of logical construction (see\nBeaney 2003). Stebbing (1933) was concerned with the unclarity over\nwhether it was expressions or entities that are logical constructions,\nand with how to understand a claim such as \u201cthis table is a\nlogical construction\u201d and indeed what it could even mean to\ncontrast logical constructions with inferred entities. \n(See the entry on Susan Stebbing.)\nRussell had been motivated by the logicist project of finding\ndefinitions and elementary premises from which mathematical statements\ncould be proved. Stebbing and Wisdom were concerned, rather, with\nrelating the notion of construction to philosophical analysis of\nordinary language.  Wisdom\u2019s (1931) series of papers\nin Mind interpreted logical constructions in terms of ideas\nfrom Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus (1921).\n\nDemopoulos and Friedman (1985) find an anticipation of the recent\n\u201cstructural realist\u201d view of scientific theories in\n(Russell 1927), The Analysis of Matter. They argue that the\nlogical constructions of sense data in Russell\u2019s earlier\nthinking on the \u201cproblem of matter\u201d were replaced by\ninferences to the structural properties of space and matter from\npatterns of sense data. We may sense patches of color next to each\nother in our visual field, but what that tells us about the causes of\nthose sense data, about matter, is only revealed by the structure of\nthose relationships. Thus the color of a patch in our visual field\ntells us nothing about the intrinsic properties of the table that\ncauses that experience. Instead it is the structural properties of our\nexperiences, such as their relative order in time, and which are\nbetween which others in the visual field, that gives us a clue as to\nthe structural relationships of time and space within the material\nworld that causes the experience. The contemporary version of this\naccount, called \u201cstructural realism\u201d, holds that it is\nonly the structural properties and relations that a scientific theory\nattributes to the world about which we should be scientific realists.\n(See the entry on\n structural realism.)\n\nAccording to this account, Russell\u2019s initial project of\nreplacing inference with logical construction was to find for each\npattern of sense data some logical construction that bears a pattern\nof isomorphic structural relations. That project was transformed,\nDemopoulos and Friedman argue, by replacing inference from the given\nin experience to the cause of that experience with an inference to the\nrather impoverished, structural, reality of the causes of those\nexperiences. Russell\u2019s matter project was interpreted in this\nway by others, and led, in 1928, to G.H. Newman\u2019s apparently\ndevastating objection. Newman (1928) pointed out that there is always\na structure of arbitrarily \u201cconstructed\u201d relations with\nany given structure if only the number of basic entities, in this case\nsense data, is large enough. According to Demopoulos and Friedman,\nNewman shows that there must be more to scientific theories than\ntrivial statements to the effect that matter has some structural\nproperties isomorphic to those of our sense data. The project of\nThe Analysis of Matter does indeed face a serious difficulty\nwith \u201cNewman\u2019s problem\u201d, whether or not those\ndifficulties arise for the earlier project of logical construction\n(see Linsky 2013).\n\nThe notion of logical construction had a great impact on the future\ncourse of analytic philosophy. One line of influence was via the\nnotion of a contextual definition, or paraphrase, intended to minimize\nontological commitment and to be a model of philosophical analysis.\nThe distinction between the surface appearance of definite\ndescriptions, as singular terms, and the fully interpreted sentences\nfrom which they seem to disappear was seen as a model for making\nproblematic notions disappear upon analysis. Wisdom (1931) proposed\nthis application of logical construction in the spirit of\nWittgenstein. In this way the theory of descriptions has been viewed\nas a paradigm of philosophical analysis of this\n\u201ctherapeutic\u201d sort that seeks to dissolve logical\nproblems.\n\nA more technical strand in analytic philosophy was influenced by the\nconstruction of matter. Rudolf Carnap quotes (Russell 1914a, 11) as\nthe motto for his \u201cAufbau\u201d, the Logical\nStructure of the World (1967):\n\n\nThe supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Whenever\npossible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred\nentities. (Carnap 1967, 6)\n\n\nIn the Aufbau the construction of matter from\n\u201celementary experiences\u201d, and later Nelson Goodman (1951)\ncontinued the project. Michael Friedman (1999) and Alan Richardson\n(1998) have argued that Carnap\u2019s project of construction owed\nmuch more to his background in neo-Kantian issues about the\n\u201cconstitution\u201d of empirical objects than with\nRussell\u2019s project. See, however, Pincock (2002) for a response\nthat argues for the importance of Russell\u2019s project of\nreconstructing scientific knowledge in (Carnap 1967). More generally,\nthe use of set theoretic constructions became widespread among\nphilosophers, and continues in the construction of set theoretic\nmodels, both in the sense of logic where they model formal theories\nand to provide descriptions of truth conditions for sentences about\nentities.\n\nThe most faithful successor to Russell\u2019s notion of logical\nconstruction is to be found in Willard van Orman Quine\u2019s\n\u201cexplication\u201d. Quine presents his methodology in Word\nand Object (1960) beginning with an allusion to Ramsey\u2019s\nremark in the title of section 53: \u201cThe Ordered Pair as\nPhilosophical Paradigm\u201d. The difficulties with apparently\nreferring expressions that motivated Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions are presented as a more general problem:\n\n\nA pattern repeatedly illustrated in recent sections is that of the\ndefective noun that proves undeserving of objects and is dismissed as\nan irreferential fragment of a few containing phrases. But sometimes\nthe defective noun fares oppositely: its utility is found to turn on\nthe admission of denoted objects as values of the variables of\nquantification. In such a case our job is to devise interpretations\nfor it in the term positions where, in its defectiveness, it had not\nused to occur. (Quine 1960, 257)\n\n\nThe notion of a \u201cdefective noun\u201d that is to be\n\u201cdismissed as an irreferential fragment\u201d clearly echoes\nthe description of constructions as logical fictions and their\nexpressions as mere incomplete symbols that so aptly describe the\ncontextual definitions for definite descriptions and classes. The task\nof \u201cdevising interpretations\u201d is more like the positive\naspect suggested by the term \u201cconstruction\u201d and\nillustrated in the cases of the construction of numbers and matter.\nAfter concluding that the expression \u201cordered pair\u201d was\nsuch a \u201cdefective noun\u201d, Quine says that the notion of an\nordered pair \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) of two entities \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\ndoes have \u201cutility\u201d and is limited only in having to\nfulfill one \u201cpostulate\u201d:\n\n(1)\nIf \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle = \\langle z,w \\rangle\\) then \\(x = z\\)\nand \\(y = w\\).\n\n\nIn other words, that ordered pairs are distinguished by having unique\nfirst and second elements. Quine then continues:\n\n\nThe problem of suitably eking out the use of these defective nouns can\nbe solved once for all by systematically fixing upon some suitable\nalready-recognized object, for each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with which to\nidentify \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\). The problem is a neat one, for we\nhave in (1) a single explicit standard by which to judge whether a\nversion is suitable. (Quine 1960, 258)\n\n\nAgain Quine echoes Russell\u2019s language with his mention of a\n\u201cneat\u201d property that calls out for a\n\u201cconstruction\u201d from known entities. Quine distinguishes\nhis project, which he calls \u201cexplication\u201d, by the fact\nthat there are alternative possible ways to fix the notion. Although\nWhitehead and Russell give an account in PM \u221755, where they are\ncalled \u201cordinal couples\u201d, the first proposal to treat\nordered pairs as classes of their members is from Norbert Wiener\n(1914a) who identifies \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) with \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{ y,\n\\Lambda \\}\\}\\), where \\(\\Lambda\\) is the empty class. From this\ndefinition it is easy to recover the first and second elements of the\npair, and so Quine\u2019s (1) is an elementary theorem. Later,\nKazimierz Kuratowski proposed the definition \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{x,y\\}\\}\\),\nfrom which (1) also follows. For Quine it is a matter of choice which\ndefinition to use, as the points on which they differ are\n\u201cdon\u2019t-cares\u201d (1960, 182), issues which give a\nprecise answer to questions about which our pre-theoretic account is\nmute. An explication thus differs considerably from an\n\u201canalysis\u201d of ordinary, or pre-theoretic language, both in\ngiving a precise meaning to the expression where it might have been\nobscure, or perhaps simply silent and in possibly differing from\npre-theoretic use, as suggested by the name. This fits well with the\nasymmetries we have noted between analysis and construction, with\nanalysis aimed at the discovery of the constituents and structure of\npropositions which are given to us, and construction which is more a\nmatter of choice, with the goal being the recovery of particular\n\u201cneat\u201d features of the construction in a formal theory.\nThe ordered pair is thus a \u201cphilosophical paradigm\u201d for\nQuine just as Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions was a paradigm of\nphilosophy for Ramsey, and each is a \u201clogical\nconstruction\u201d.\n",
