Indeed, these rules are part of\nAstell\u2019s version of Arnauld and Nicole\u2019s Port-Royal\nLogic, which she designs specifically for the women of her\naudience so that they can escape their everyday skepticism; only once\nthey resolve their skeptical predicaments can they begin to embark on\na project of reflection involving philosophical skepticism, as\nDescartes presents it in Discourse on the Method and\nMeditations on First Philosophy (see Sowaal 2007).\n\nThe method encapsulated in these six rules is to be employed when a\nmeditator addresses a particular subject of inquiry. Astell recognizes\nthat even prior to such reflections, the meditator must first\ndisengage from the skeptical predicament that can arise from having\nadopted the social prejudice that they are defective (see section 3).\nInstead of holding beliefs because authorities told them to, and\ninstead of continuing to hold them because they once did, these women\nshould learn to maintain beliefs because they are self-evident. To\nlearn how to reveal self-evident truths, Astell suggests a number of\nstrategies. One strategy involves reflecting on how the former\nprejudices led to mischief, promoted error, and hindered the free\nrange of thought. Another strategy involves reflecting on how the\nprejudices provided a means for skepticism to take root. For example,\nwhen one holds a belief, one often draws further conclusions from it.\nBut when one finds that the conclusion is false, one often questions\nthe whole group of claims, concluding that nothing can be known\n(Astell SP, 133\u20134). Here Astell\u2019s treatment is largely\nCartesian.\n\nHowever, Astell departs from the Cartesian project when she presents\nanother strategy her novice can use to release herself from the\nskeptical predicament. This strategy involves reflecting on\nteleological arguments about the design of God\u2019s creation\n(153\u20134, 168). These arguments are designed to help the novice\nrealize that God would not have created her so that she is naturally\ndefective (that is, naturally proud, vain, and unimprovable). Such\nreflection will lead the novice to search for the perfections God has\nbestowed upon her and the role they play in her life, as well as in\nher community and creation as a whole. Through these considerations,\nshe will be drawn to the conclusion that she is a rational being who\ncan and ought to improve her rationality in order to fulfill\nGod\u2019s plan for creation.\n\nUltimately Astell\u2019s novice will benefit from metaphysical\nreflection on what truly exists\u2014God, mind, and body\u2014for\nsuch reflection will result in her correctly understanding what she is\nand how she stands in relation to God. A central aspect of this will\nbe her new comprehension of the understanding, the will, and the\norigin of error. She will come to grasp that the limitation of the\nunderstanding is not a defect, but rather that limitations are natural\nand necessary; thus, while ignorance cannot be avoided, error can. She\nwill realize that the understanding is passive and that\njudgment\u2014and therefore error\u2014belongs to the will. She will\nlearn to suspend her judgment until she has clarity and to direct her\nwill to a good end (159). With this new understanding of her will and\nher new resolution to develop better habits in employing her will, her\ngenerosity (which formerly degraded into pride, vanity) will be\nrestored, as will her virtue.\n",
