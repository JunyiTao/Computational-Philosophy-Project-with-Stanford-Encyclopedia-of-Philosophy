    "main_text": "\n1. The Central Questions\n\nThe core concepts of ancient skepticism are belief, suspension of\njudgment, criterion of truth, appearances, and investigation.\nImportant notions of modern skepticism such as knowledge, certainty,\njustified belief, and doubt play no or almost no role. This is not to\nsay that the ancients would not engage with questions that figure in\ntoday\u2019s philosophical discussions. Ancient debates address\nquestions that today we associate with epistemology and philosophy of\nlanguage, as well as with theory of action, rather than specifically\nwith the contemporary topic of skepticism. They focus on the nature of\nbelief, the relationship of belief to speech and action, and the\nmental states of inquiry (on the role of ancient skepticism throughout\nthe history of Western philosophy up to today, cf. Lagerlund 2020; on\nthe relation between ancient skepticism and philosophical debates\ntoday, cf. Machuca and Reed 2018, Vlasits and Vogt 2020, and Machuca\n2022).\n\nFrom the point of view of the ancient skeptics, assertions are\nexpressions of dogmatism. And yet, the best-known ancient skeptic,\nSextus Empiricus, wrote extensively. Can the skeptics say anything\nmeaningful about their philosophy without asserting anything about how\nthings are (Bett 2013, 2019)? Skeptical writings have a peculiar\nformat, one that comes with its own challenges: the skeptics aim to\ndescribe their philosophy tout court, as they practice it,\nwithout laying out any particular theories or doctrines. Skeptical\nideas have been charged with a family of objections: they might be\nself-refuting, inconsistent, self-contradictory, and so on (Castagnoli\n2010). Another line of objection is associated with Hume, namely that\n\u201cnature is always too strong for principle.\u201d As Hume puts\nit, \u201ca Pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have\nany constant influence on the mind\u201d (part 2 of section 12,\n\u201cOf the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy,\u201d An\nEnquiry Concerning Human Understanding, London, 1748). It is one\nthing for skepticism to be coherent. It is another thing for it to be\nlikely that anyone, no matter how much they rehearse skeptical\narguments in their mind, will succeed in adhering to it (Johnson\n2001), as ancient Pyrrhonist philosophers claimed to be able to\ndo.\n\nLike later epistemologists, the ancient skeptics start from questions\nabout knowledge. But discussion quickly turns to beliefs (Fine 2000).\nThe Greek term translated here as belief, doxa, can also be\ntranslated as opinion. The root of doxa is dokein,\nseeming. In a belief, something seems so-and-so to someone. But there\nis also an element of judgment or acceptance. The relevant verb,\ndoxazein, often means \u2018to judge that something is\nso-and-so.\u2019 Hellenistic discussions envisage three attitudes\nthat cognizers take to impressions (how things seem to them): assent,\nrejection, and suspension of judgment (epoch\u00ea).\n\nSuspension is a core element of skepticism: the skeptic suspends\njudgment. However, if this means that the skeptic forms no beliefs\nwhatsoever, then skepticism may be a kind of cognitive suicide.\nArguably, belief-formation is a basic feature of human cognitive\nactivity. It is not clear whether one can lead an ordinary human life\nwithout belief, or indeed, ancient opponents of the skeptics say,\nwhether one can even survive. Perhaps even the simplest actions, such\nas eating or leaving a room without running into a wall, involve\nbeliefs (Annas-Barnes 1985, 7; Burnyeat 1980). It is also hard to say\nwhether someone who succeeded in not forming any beliefs could\ncommunicate with others, whether they could engage in philosophical\ninvestigation, or whether they could even think at all.\n\nThe ancient skeptics are well aware of these objections. The most\nwidely discussed charge is that they cannot act without belief\n(Apraxia Charge). In response, the skeptics describe their actions\nvariously as guided by the plausible, the convincing, or by\nappearances. The notion of appearances gains great importance in\nPyrrhonian skepticism, and poses difficult interpretive questions\n(Barney 1992). When something appears so-and-so to someone, does this\nfor the skeptics involve some kind of judgment on their part? Or do\nthey have in mind a purely phenomenal kind of appearing? The skeptical\nproposals (that the skeptic adheres to the plausible, the convincing,\nor to appearances) have in common their appeal to something less than\nfull-fledged belief about how things are, while allowing something\nsufficient to generate and guide action.\n\nHowever, the claim that ancient skepticism is about belief, while\nmodern skepticism is about knowledge, needs to be qualified. Ancient\nskepticism is not alone in being concerned with belief. Descartes\nspeaks repeatedly of demolishing his opinions (for example,\nMed 2:12, AT 7:18; cf. Broughton, 2002,\n33\u201361). Contemporary epistemology often pays equal attention to\nthe notions of both belief and knowledge. The distinctive focus\nof ancient skepticism on belief becomes clearer once we consider a\nthird concept that figures centrally in ancient discussions: the criterion\nof truth. The skeptics and their opponents discuss how one\nrecognizes a true impression as true. Are there some evident things\n(some kind of impressions), which can be used as standards or\ncriteria, so that nothing is to be accepted as true if it is not in\nagreement with these evident things? The Stoics and Epicureans\nformulate theories that conceive of such criteria. The skeptics\nrespond critically to their proposals. Accordingly, the conception of\na criterion of truth assumes as central a role in ancient debates as\ndoes the notion of knowledge in modern discussions. This debate\nincludes in-depth analysis of sense perception and its relation to\nbelief. According to Epicurus, all sense perceptions are true, but\njudgments based on these perceptions are true or false (Striker 1977,\nVogt 2017). The Stoics explore differences between sense perception,\nillusion, and hallucination (Vasiliou 2019). Their account of the\ncriterion of truth starts from perceptual impressions that qualify, or\nfail to qualify, as cognitive (Shogry 2018). The Stoics propose that\nwe should accept only cognitive impressions, and accordingly we should\nonly form beliefs based on a subset of true perceptual\nimpressions.\n\nDiscussion of the criterion of truth arguably also covers some of the\nground that is later discussed in terms of certainty. The Stoics say\nthat a particular kind of impression is the criterion of truth: the\ncognitive impression. Cognitive impressions make it clear through\nthemselves that they reveal things precisely as they are. This notion\nis an ancestor to the later conception of clear and distinct\nimpressions, and thus, to discussions of certainty.\n\nConsider next the notion of doubt. Doubt is often considered the\nhallmark of skepticism. So how can it be that ancient skepticism is\nnot about doubt (Corti 2010, Vogt 2014a)? Insofar as \u2018to\ndoubt\u2019 means no more than \u2018to call into question,\u2019\nthe ancient skeptics might be described as doubting things. However,\nskeptical investigation as Sextus Empiricus describes it does not\ninvolve doubt (I shall focus here on Pyrrhonism; on Cicero\u2019s use\nof dubitari, see Section 3.3). Skeptics find themselves\nstruck by the discrepancies among impressions. This experience is\ndescribed as turmoil (Machuca 2019). They aim to resolve this\ndisturbance by settling what is true and what is false among them. But\ninvestigation leads them to suspension of judgment, which brings its\nown peace of mind (Outlines of Skepticism [= PH]\n1.25\u201330). Where in this account should we locate doubt? Is the\ninitial turmoil the ancient skeptic experiences a kind of doubt? Are\nthe ancient skeptic\u2019s investigations a kind of doubting? Should\nwe describe suspension of judgment as a kind of doubt? All three\nstages may resemble doubt, at least insofar as the ancient skeptics\nhave not settled on answers to the questions they investigate. But all\nthree stages are also different from doubt as it is conceived in later\nepistemology. The ancient skeptics do not describe themselves as\nmaking an active effort at doubting what ordinarily they would\nbelieve, as some philosophers in the Cartesian tradition have it.\nInstead the ancient skeptics find themselves in turmoil because of\ndiscrepancies in how things strike them. Moreover, the progression\nthat ancient skeptics describe differs from the doubt-belief model\nthat later thinkers tend to employ. The ancient skeptics improve their\npsychological condition by moving from turmoil to suspension of\njudgment, not by removing doubt. It seems best, then, to refrain from\ninvoking the modern conception of doubt as at all fundamental in the\nreconstruction of ancient Greek skepticism.\n\nSome of the distinctness of ancient skepticism lies in the fact that\nit is developed by philosophers who genuinely think of themselves as\nskeptics. In later epistemology, skepticism is largely construed from\nthe outside. In particular, early modern skepticism is, for the most\npart, conceived by philosophers who aim to refute it. But ancient\nskepticism is explored by skeptics, and that is, by philosophers who\nintend their lives to be reflective of their philosophy (Cooper 2012\nch. 5.5\u20137; Bett 2013b). Socrates raises the challenge that it\nmight be truly bad (for one\u2019s life, for the state of one\u2019s\nsoul, and so on) to base one\u2019s actions on unexamined beliefs.\nFor all one knows, these beliefs could be false, and without\ninvestigation, one does not even aim to rid oneself of false belief,\nwhich is admittedly a bad thing for one\u2019s soul. Only an examined\nlife is worth living (Cooper 2007). Once we take this challenge\nseriously, as the ancient skeptics do, we embark on a kind of\ninvestigation that is seen as directly relevant to our lives. Our\nbeliefs are assumed, at this pre-skeptical phase, to be guiding our\nactions. Confidence in unexamined views seems misplaced. Others\nregularly disagree with us. In favor of each view, some arguments\ncan be adduced, some practices invoked, some experiences cited. These\nconflicting arguments, practices and experiences need to be examined.\nBut that just raises further views that are in conflict. As a\nconsequence, suspension of judgment on every such question looks\nrationally mandatory. But it is also rational to persist in\ninvestigation. The skeptic is committed to a search for the truth, on\nvirtually all questions, even if this search repeatedly and\npredictably leads to suspension of judgment (Cooper 2012).\n2. Skeptical Ideas in Early and Classical Greek Philosophy\n2.1 Early Greek Philosophy\n\nThe early Greek philosophers develop distinctions between reality and\nappearances, knowledge and belief, and the non-evident and the\nevident. These distinctions form the framework in which skepticism can\nbe conceived. The idea that truth is seen and knowledge gained from\nsome perspective outside of the ordinary ways of mortal life, and that\nmortals rely on something lesser, be it the hear-say of fame, or\nsigns, or appearances, runs through much of early Greek thought.\nHowever, few early Greek thinkers seem to have had skeptical or\nproto-skeptical inclinations. Xenophanes and Democritus are perhaps\nthe most prominent apparent exceptions.\n\nXenophanes famously insists that all conceptions of the gods are\nanthropomorphic and culturally contingent (DK 21B14, B15). The\nEthiopians pray to gods who look like Ethiopians, the Thracians to\ngods who look like Thracians (B16). If horses and cows had hands, the\nhorses would draw pictures of gods that look like horses, and the cows\nwould draw gods as cows (B15). Xenophanes puts forward a number of\ntheological theses of his own. But he says that no man will know the\nclear truth about such matters. He makes a point that has lasting\nrelevance in discussions of skepticism: even if someone succeeded in\nsaying something that actually is the case, he himself would not know\nthis. Thus, all is belief (120: B34) (cf. Sassi 2011 on\ninterpretations of Xenophanes that influence the history of\nskepticism).\n\nAtomism\u2014a theory which thrives in Hellenistic times as the\nphysical theory of Epicureanism, and is thus an interlocutor of\nskepticism\u2014leads into difficult epistemological questions. The\natomist can argue that sense perceptions are explicable as complex\nevents, initiated by objects each one made up of a lot of atoms\nfloating in the void, from which atoms proceed and traverse the\nintervening space, and affect the senses. It is certain objects, made\nup by the atoms proceeding from the objects in question (filmy images)\nthat we actually perceive. We neither perceive \u2018real\nreality\u2019 (atoms and void), nor even macroscopic objects and\ntheir properties (for example, a square tower). Democritus seems to\nhave argued along these lines (SE M 7.135\u20139; cf. fr. 9,\nSE M 7.136; Theophrastus, De Sensibus 2.60\u20131,\n63\u20134), and accordingly his atomist view of perception can be\nseen as grounding a kind of proto-skepticism.\n\nDemocritus\u2019 student Metrodorus of Chios says at the beginning of\nhis book On Nature \u201cNone of us knows anything, not even\nthis, whether we know or we do not know; nor do we know what \u2018to\nnot know\u2019 or \u2018to know\u2019 are, nor on the whole,\nwhether anything is or is not\u201d (Cicero, Acad. 2.73;\ntrans. Lee (2010) = DK 70B1; SE M 7.48, 87\u20138; Eusebius,\nPraep. evang. 14.19.9). This formulation reflects awareness\nof the fact that a simpler statement than the one reported in Cicero,\nsuch as \u201cthere is no knowledge,\u201d can be turned against\nitself. In particular, Metrodorus recognizes the role that\nunderstanding concepts plays in any such statement. Does its proponent\nknow something, merely by virtue of understanding what the terms she\nuses in her philosophizing refer to? Sextus presents Metrodorus\u2019\npronouncement as related to an enigmatic idea that he ascribes to two\nother philosophers, the Democritean Anaxarchus of Abdera and the Cynic\nMonismus (SE M 7.87\u201388). Both are said to have likened existing\nthings to a stage-painting. This comparison, which Burnyeat captures\nin the catch-phrase \u201call the world\u2019s a\nstage-painting,\u201d is open to a range of interpretations (Burnyeat\n2017). For Monismus, Burnyeat argues, it is likely to have had a\nmoralistic upshot, along the lines of \u201call is vanity.\u201d In\nDemocritean philosophy, and insofar as later skepticism recalls the\nsaying, it is bound to be a proposal in epistemology (or possibly\nepistemology and metaphysics).\n\nThe 5th century sophists develop forms of debate which are\nancestors of skeptical argumentation (Bett 2020b). They take pride in\narguing in a persuasive fashion for both sides of an issue and\nin developing an agonistic art of refuting any claim put forward.\nFurther, the sophists are interested in the contrast between nature\nand convention. The formative roles of custom and law were discussed\nby some of the earliest Greek authors (consider Pindar\u2019s\n\u201claw is king\u201d and its many interpretations, for example in\nHerodotus). The sophists explore the idea that, if things are\ndifferent for different cultures, there may be no fact of the matter\nof how those things really are. The skeptics engage with both legs of\nthe distinction between nature and convention. Pyrrhonian skepticism\nemploys an argument to the effect that, if something is by nature\nF, it is F for everyone (affects everyone as\nF) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Pyrrhonism further associates\nconvention with appearances, so that the sceptic, by adhering to\nappearances, can lead an ordinary life (see section 4). However, the\ncontrast between nature and convention does not figure importantly in\nancient skepticism, and there is no skeptical school that would\nconfine itself to \u2018moral\u2019 skepticism, or skepticism about\nvalues.\n\nSextus Empiricus, whose writings provide the most detailed extant\naccount of Pyrrhonian skepticism, emphasizes how strongly the skeptics\ndepart from all other philosophers. As he presents it, the\nPre-Socratics who put forward some of the views cited above are what\nhe calls dogmatists. They make claims about nature, reality,\nknowability, and so on. The second-most detailed extant account of\nPyrrhonian skepticism is offered by Diogenes Laertius, in his\nLives of Eminent Philosophers 9.61\u2013116. It contains a\nlarge number of references to early Greek poets and Pre-Socratic\nphilosophers, suggesting that these early thinkers formulate ideas\nthat are similar to skeptic ideas (\u00a7\u00a761\u201373). It is\ncontroversial whether the skeptics Diogenes has in mind claim this\nancestry. Alternatively, other philosophers may have charged the\nskeptics with sharing ideas with non-skeptical thinkers, thereby\ndeparting from their non-dogmatic approach (Warren 2015). Either way,\ntwo observations seem relevant. Contrary to a classic assessment of\nDiogenes\u2019 report by Jonathan Barnes (1992), the sections of text\nin which connections are made between early Greek thought and\nskepticism may be worth exploring. Moreover, scholars may have paid\ntoo little attention to skepticism\u2019s ancestry in poetry (Clayman\n2009). Pyrrho seems to have referred to Homer as a proponent of ideas\nhe approves of, ideas about change, the status of human rationality\nand language, and more.\n2.2 Plato\n\nThe Socrates of Plato\u2019s Apology tries to solve a\npuzzle. The Delphic oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates.\nBut Socrates does not think himself wise. He calls into question the\ntruth of neither the oracle\u2019s pronouncements nor his\nself-perception. Accordingly, he must figure out how both are\nconsistent with each other. In order to do so, Socrates talks to\nvarious groups of experts in Athens: politicians, poets, and\ncraftsmen. As it turns out, all of them think that they know something\nabout great and important things, but in fact, it seems clear to\nSocrates, they do not. When asked they cannot provide reasons for\nbelieving the things they claim to know that are rationally\nsatisfactory. Socrates knows that he does not know about these most\nimportant matters (megista; 22d); his interlocutors, it\nappears, do not know that they lack this knowledge. In this respect,\nSocrates is wiser than everyone else who has any general reputation\nfor wisdom. In the course of recounting his conversations with others,\nSocrates says something enigmatic: \u201cAbout myself I knew that I\nknow nothing\u201d (22d; cf. Fine 2008). Some readers (ancient and\nmodern) take Socrates to profess that he knows nothing. But the\ncontext of the dialogue allows us to read his pronouncement as\nunproblematical. Socrates knows that he does not know about important\nthings. He advocates the importance of critically examining\none\u2019s own and others\u2019 views on important matters,\nprecisely because one does not know about them (Vogt 2012a, ch. 1).\nSuch examination is the only way to find out.\n\nSocrates\u2019 commitment to reason\u2014examination as the way to\nfind out\u2014inspires the skepticism of the Hellenistic Academy\n(Cooper 2004b, Vogt 2013). One is bound to lead one\u2019s life based\non one\u2019s beliefs, he assumes. Therefore, one ought to examine\none\u2019s beliefs, and abandon those that one finds to be false. One\nought to do so because otherwise one might lead a bad life.\nSocrates\u2019 questioning is rooted in a concern with the good life.\nInsofar as it is, one might think that the Socratic roots of ancient\nskepticism lead one toward a kind of limited, wholly moral skepticism.\nHowever, Socrates\u2019 examinations are not confined to value\nquestions. While ethical questions may be the starting-point, they\nimmediately lead to questions about the soul, the gods, knowledge, and\nso on. For Socrates and his Hellenistic followers, value questions\ncannot be insulated from questions of psychology, physics, and\nepistemology.\n\nAnother strand of skeptical thought begins with questions about the\nnature of philosophical investigation. In the Meno, Plato\nformulates a famous puzzle. How is investigation possible? We cannot\ninvestigate either what we know or what we do not know. In the former\ncase, there is no need to investigate, and besides, if we really do\nknow we already have in mind everything that investigation could\nreveal to us about the matter. In the latter case, we would not know\nwhat to look for, and we would not recognize it if we found it\n(80d-86c). So there is no room for investigating anything. Socrates\ncalls this an eristic argument, thus drawing attention to the fact\nthat this is a puzzle that sophists have put forward (cf.\nPlato\u2019s Euthydemus).\n\nPlato\u2019s solutions to this puzzle are difficult to assess (Fine\n2014). Learning is recollection, says one proposal (this is the one\nthat Socrates himself immediately offers). We already know, but only\nin some implicit way, what it takes investigation to come to know\nexplicitly. This is the famous Anamnesis theory (81a-d). If we give up\non investigation, we shall be lazy people, says another argument\n(81d-e). A third solution of the puzzle arguably says that one of its\npremises is false. It is not the case that, for everything, we either\nknow it or are entirely ignorant of it. Rather, there is a third\nstate, namely belief (83a-86a). Investigation can begin from\nbeliefs.\n\nThe Meno explores a mix of these solutions. Plato develops\nwhat he calls a hypothetical method (86c-100b). That is, the\ninterlocutors in some sense begin from their beliefs (for example,\n\u201cvirtue is good\u201d). But they do not endorse them. They set\nthem up as hypotheses, and employ these hypotheses in investigation\n(on the relationship between Pyrrhonian skepticism and Plato\u2019s\nand Aristotle\u2019s notions of hypothesis, cf. Corti 2011). A\nspurious dialogue, the Sisyphus, discusses a similar puzzle,\nthough with respect to deliberation. Deliberation either involves\nknowledge or is mere guesswork; either way, deliberation is\nimpossible. Here, too, we may ask whether the distinction between\nknowing and not knowing is exhaustive, or whether attention to belief\nchanges the picture (Fine 2021, ch. 8).\n\nPlato discusses and re-formulates several of the metaphysical\nconsiderations that back up proto-skeptical and early skeptical\nintuitions. The relevant passages are spread out over a number of\ndialogues, among which passages in the Phaedo,\nRepublic, Theaetetus and Timaeus are\nperhaps most important. In these dialogues, Plato develops some of his\nown metaphysical ideas. He also engages critically with metaphysical\ntheories that he does not ultimately adopt. However, in order to\nexplore these theories he formulates them in detail, often invoking a\nPre-Socratic ancestor as a proponent of a given idea. These\ndiscussions are a great source of inspiration for Pyrrhonian skeptics,\nwho are interested in what may be called a metaphysics of\nindeterminacy (Bett 2000, Vogt 2021).\n\nIn contrasting the Forms with the perceptible realm, Plato discusses\nproperties. For example, for all sensible items, A is tall\nrelative to some B and short relative to some C.\nThere is no such thing as anything\u2019s being tall\nsimpliciter. When we call something tall, we measure it\nagainst something else, look at it from a particular perspective, and\nso on. As we might say, \u201ctall\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d\nare relative predicates. But perhaps many more, or indeed all,\npredicates work that way, even where this is less obvious.\nPlato\u2019s arguments lead to the question of whether it is\nconceivable that all our predications are, in this particular sense,\nrelative. If this were the case, it might quite fundamentally upset\nour conception of the world as furnished with objects that have\nproperties. Such considerations lead to another idea about properties\nin the perceptual realm. If a fence is low and high, a cloud is bright\nand dark, a vase beautiful and ugly, and so on, then it seems that,\nperhaps quite generally, perceptual things are F and\nnot-F. Only the Form of F is F (for\nexample, only the Beautiful is beautiful). While the relevant passages\nare difficult to interpret, it is clear enough which line of thought\ncomes to influence later skeptics. The skeptics engage with the idea\nthat, if something appears to be F and not-F, it is\nnot really (or: by nature) either F or not-F.\n\nIn the Timaeus, Plato argues that an account of the natural\nworld can only be \u2018likely\u2019: it is an eik\u00f4s\nlogos. Most generally speaking, the idea here is that certain\nexplananda are such that theorizing about them can do no more than\nmirror their, comparatively speaking deficient, nature. This idea has\nancestors in Xenophanes and Parmenides, and it plays a crucial role in\nthe Timaeus (Bryan 2012). Academic skeptics employ various\nnotions of the plausible and the convincing, thus developing further\nthis tradition, albeit no longer with the assumption that different\ndomains require different kinds of theorizing.\n\nIn the Theaetetus, Plato explores the kind of cultural\nrelativism that is associated with some sophists. In his examination\nrelativism is extended to a general theory, not restricted to the\ndomain of values. Socrates (as main speaker of the dialogue) ascribes\nrelativism to Protagoras, who is famous for saying that \u201cman is\nthe measure.\u201d Socrates reformulates this claim as follows: what\nappears to A is true for A, and what appears to\nB is true for B. On this premise, Socrates argues,\nthere is no rational way to prefer our perceptions while awake to our\nperceptions while asleep, or similarly, to prefer sober to intoxicated\nor deranged perceptions. In each state, our perceptions are true for\nus. Socrates analyzes relativism in several steps, pointing to ever\nmore radical implications. Along the way, he envisages a moderate\nmetaphysics of flux, where objects do not have stable properties. But\neventually he points out that relativism is committed to an even\nstarker revisionist metaphysics, radical flux. For it to be possible\nthat what seems to A is true for A, and what seems\nto B is true for B, there cannot be a stable world\nthat A and B both refer to. Rather,\n\u201ceverything is motion\u201d (Tht. 179c-184b). The\nskeptics employ versions of some of the arguments in the\nTheaetetus, without, however, arriving at relativist\nconclusions. Schematically speaking, the relativist says that,\nif X is F for A and F*\nfor B, then X is F-for-A and\nF*-for-B. Pyrrhonian skepticism of the variant found\nin Sextus reacts by continued investigation into whether X is\nF or F* (or both or neither).\n2.3 Aristotle\n\nAristotle engages, at several points in his works, with the\nMeno Problem. For example, Aristotle points out that, for\nsuccessful investigation to proceed, one first needs a well-formulated\nquestion. One needs to know the knot in order to untie it. In order to\nknow what to look for and recognize it when one finds it, one needs to\nfirst think one\u2019s way through the difficulties involved, and\nthereby formulate a question. If one does, then one shall be able to\nrecognize the solution once one hits upon it (Met. 3.1,\n995a24\u2013b4). These ideas are highly relevant to Hellenistic\ndiscussions. The skeptic is an investigator, and one anti-skeptical\ncharge says that, if indeed a skeptic knew nothing, they could not\neven formulate the questions they investigate. Interpreters have\nemphasized a contrast between Aristotle and the skeptics. For\nAristotle, formulating puzzles and thinking one\u2019s way through\nthem puts one in a better position, such that one gets clear about how\nmatters are. This may be different for the skeptics: engagement with\ndifferent angles of philosophical problems leads them to suspension of\njudgment (Long 2006, Code 2010). Other scholars argue that the\nskeptics\u2019 way of thinking through puzzles improves their\ncognitive condition even though they do not settle for an answer to a\ngiven question (Vogt 2012a, ch. 5). Also, scholars point to modes of\nthinking in Plato and Aristotle that are not primarily concerned with\nresults. In contemplation, a cognizer may think again and again\nthrough the same kinds of matters, and yet doing so presumably\nimproves their cognitive condition (Olfert 2014).\n\nIn Posterior Analytics I.1, Aristotle says that all teaching\nand learning comes about through things we already know. When we\nphrase questions, we already have \u2018That-Knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018What-Knowledge.\u2019 For example, when we ask questions about\ntriangles, we need to know that there are triangles (otherwise we\nwould not have questions about their properties). We also need to have\na notion of what triangles are (we draw a triangle, not a square, when\nwe phrase a question about its properties). Another way in which\nAristotle addresses the Meno Problem conceives of particular\nperceptions as the starting-points of investigation. Complex cognitive\nactivities arise from simpler ones. Many particular perceptions lead\nto memory, to experience, and eventually to expert understanding\n(Met. 1.1, An. Post. II.19). With the\ngeneralizations of memory, experience, and expertise comes the ability\nto investigate. With respect to skepticism, the important point here\nis that the starting-points of investigation are not themselves in\nneed of justification.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle engages with the Protagorean claim that, as\nAristotle puts it, all seemings (dokounta) and appearances\n(phainomena) are true (Met 4.5). If this were so,\nAristotle says, everything would have to be true and false at the same\ntime. Aristotle argues that earlier thinkers arrived at such views\nbecause they identified being solely with the perceptual (4.5,\n1010a1\u20133). Caught up in this assumption, they did not see who or\nwhat was going to judge between conflicting sense perceptions. For\nexample, it seemed unsatisfactory to dismiss the views of sick and mad\npeople simply on the grounds that they are in the minority, thereby\nconsidering as true what appears to the greater number of people.\nSimilarly, Aristotle reports that these earlier thinkers looked at the\nways in which things appear differently to different kinds of living\nbeings, and to one person at different times (4.5,\n1099b1\u201311).\n\nIn Metaphysics 4.4, Aristotle notes that some people consider\nit possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and for someone to\nbelieve so (he refers to a range of positions, all of which in some\nway are related to denial of the Principle of Non-Contradiction; see\nCastagnoli 2010, I.5.4). Against this, Aristotle says it is the\nfirmest of principles that things cannot be and not be at the same\ntime. To deny this shows a lack of training. With adequate training,\none recognizes for which things proof should be sought, and for which\nit ought not to be sought (see also An. Post. I.3). It is\nimpossible that there be demonstration for everything. Otherwise\ndemonstration would go on ad infinitum. Scholars often refer\nto this point when discussing the skeptical modes of argument. The\nskeptics might be guilty of what, from Aristotle\u2019s perspective,\nwould be a mistake of exactly this kind (on this theme in later\nAristotelian logic, cf. Malink 2020).\n\nAristotle continues in a way that is highly relevant to discussions of\nskeptical language and action. A person who wishes to deny that things\ncannot be and not be at the same time has two options. Either they say\nnothing, or they talk to us. In the first case, there is no need for\nus to refute them. This person is like a plant\u2014they do not talk.\nIn the second case, either their utterance signifies something, or it\nsignifies nothing. If it signifies something, then they say that\nsomething is so-and-so (which Aristotle takes to be self-defeating for\nthem). If it signifies nothing, then it does not qualify as speech.\nEven though they make an utterance, the person is in effect not\nspeaking with us (or to themselves). Aristotle also explains the\nplant-metaphor in terms of action (1008b10-30). A person who believes\nnothing is like a plant because they cannot act. Pursuit and avoidance\ntestify to the fact that people have beliefs. (On Aristotle and\nskepticism, see the papers collected in Irwin 1995.)\n3. Academic Skepticism\n3.1 Arcesilaus\n\nWith Arcesilaus (316/5\u2013241/0 BCE) and his role as leader of the\nAcademy (266/268 BCE), Plato\u2019s Academy turns skeptical.\nArcesilaus does not refer to himself as a skeptic\u2014this\nnomenclature is a later designation. However, Arcesilaus stands at the\nbeginning of a re-orientation in the history of Platonically inspired\nphilosophy. He rediscovers Socrates the examiner, arguably based on\nhis reading of Plato\u2019s dialogues (Thorsrud 2018).\nSocrates\u2019 commitment to investigation, to the testing and\nexploring of one\u2019s own and others\u2019 beliefs, and his\npassion for weeding out falsehoods, are the starting-points of his\nAcademic skepticism (Cicero, Acad. 2.74, 1.46). Throughout\nthe history of this skeptical school, these traits, and the\ncorresponding commitment to a life guided by reason, remain alive\n(Cooper 2004b, Vogt 2013). When, as we shall see below, Arcesilaus\ndefends a skeptical life without belief, this is because, as he\nthinks, reason itself, if properly and faithfully followed, leads us\nto live that way. To Arcesilaus, the skeptical life is a life lived\nfollowing reason, a life based on reason\u2014just as the\ncompeting Stoic and Epicurean lives are alleged by their proponents to\nbe. Arcesilaus engages with the epistemologies of these contemporaries\nof his. In particular, the Academics call into question that there is\na criterion of truth, as both Epicureans and Stoics, beginning in the\ngeneration before Arcesilaus, claim there is. One interpretive\nquestion that concerns Arcesilaus, but also later Academic skeptics,\nis especially vexed. According to Seneca (Letter 88,\n44), the Academics paradoxically claim to know that nothing can be\nknown. Scholars disagree on how this and similar reports fit together\nwith the picture of Academic skeptics as open-minded inquirers (Allen\n2017). According to Sextus Empiricus, the Academics skeptics say that\neverything is inapprehensible (PH 1.226, cf. PH 1.3). Is\n\u201ceverything is inapprehensible\u201d the single thing that can\nbe apprehended? Does so-called \u201cnon-apprehension\u201d\n(akatal\u00eapsia) amount to the general claim that there is\nno knowledge? Alternatively, the Academics may dialectically\nappeal to the Stoic notion of katal\u00eapsis, and argue\nmerely that the Stoic notion of apprehension is not compelling (Allen\n2022).\n\nLike Socrates, Arcesilaus did not write anything. His views must be\nunearthed from Sextus\u2019 comparisons between Pyrrhonian and\nAcademic skepticism, from Cicero\u2019s discussions in the\nAcademica, and from a range of shorter (and sometimes\nhostile) reports. Major themes in Arcesilaus\u2019 philosophy are (i)\nhis dialectical method, (ii) discussion of whether there is a\ncriterion of truth, and (iii) his defense of the skeptic\u2019s\nability to act.\n\n(i) Method. Arcesilaus embraces what scholars call a dialectical\nmethod (Couissin 1929 [1983], Perin 2013, Thorsrud 2018). This method\nis inspired by Socrates. It proceeds by asking one\u2019s real or\nimaginary interlocutor what they think about a given question, then\nplunging into an examination of their views, employing their premises.\nCan they explain their position without running into inconsistencies,\nand without having to accept implications that they want to resist? As\na consequence of this method, it sometimes appears as if a skeptic,\nwhile examining someone\u2019s view and its consequences, makes a\npositive claim: \u201cso, such-and-such is not so-and-so.\u201d\nHowever, within a dialectical exchange, this should be read as\n\u201caccording to your premises, such-and-such\nfollows.\u201d This method remains a key ingredient of Greek\nskepticism. While the different skeptical schools develop variants of\nthe dialectical method, skeptical argument is often characterized by\nthe fact that skeptics think of themselves as engaging with\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d interlocutors. In the skeptical tradition, as\narticulated for example by Sextus Empiricus (see section 4.4.),\n\u201cdogmatists\u201d are philosophers who put forward, and defend,\npositive answers to philosophical questions about reality, knowledge,\nethical values, etc. They need not do so dogmatically or rigidly or\nwithout consideration of alternatives in order to count, in skeptical\nterms, as \u201cdogmatists.\u201d\n\n(ii) The Criterion of Truth. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, and\nroughly 20\u201330 years Arcesilaus\u2019 senior, was for a time a\nstudent at the Academy. He was still in the Academy when he formulated\nkey Stoic doctrines. Like Arcesilaus, he claims Socratic ancestry.\nZeno is inspired by some of the same ideas that inspire the skeptics.\nIn particular, he engages with the Socratic idea that knowledge is\nintegral to virtue. Contrary to Arcesilaus, Zeno aims to give accounts\nof knowledge and virtue, and holds them up as ideals that human nature\npermits us to achieve. For him, knowledge is very difficult to attain,\nbut ultimately within the reach of human beings. From the point of\nview of Arcesilaus, Zeno\u2019s claim to Socratic heritage is almost\noffensive: Zeno seems to be too optimistic about our cognitive powers\nto be following Socrates (Frede 1983). Scholars have traditionally\nenvisaged an exchange of arguments between Zeno and Arcesilaus, where\neach modified his views in the light of the other\u2019s criticism.\nHowever, Zeno most likely formulated his views between 300\u2013275,\nand Arcesilaus argued against him c. 275 to 240, when Zeno (who died\nc. 263) was probably already retired (Brittain 2006, xiii; Alesse\n2000, 115 f.; Long 2006, ch. 5).\n\nThe core of the dispute between Arcesilaus and the early Stoics\nconcerns the question of whether there is a criterion of truth. The\nnotion of a criterion is introduced into Hellenistic discussions by\nEpicurus, who speaks about the kan\u00f4n (literally\nmeasuring stick) and krit\u00earion. For Epicurus, a\ncriterion is that evident thing, viz., the content of a\nsense-perception, against which claims about the non-evident are\ntested. For example, physics advances claims about non-evident things,\nsuch as atoms and void. These are not accessible to the senses, and\naccordingly, do not count as evident. Perception rules out various\nphysical theories. For example, a physical or metaphysical theory\naccording to which there is no movement can be dismissed because it is\nin disagreement with the evident.\n\nZeno argues that a certain kind of impression\u2014namely a cognitive\nimpression (phantasia\nkatal\u00eaptik\u00ea)\u2014is the criterion of truth (cf.\nShogry 2018). Zeno\u2019s conception of cognition\n(katal\u00eapsis, literally grasping, apprehension), and the\nrelated notion of a cognitive impression, aim to solve an\nepistemological problem. Belief-formation aims at the truth; there is\na norm inherent in the practice of believing that one should only\nbelieve truths. It is not transparent to us, however, which of our\nbeliefs, or claims to the effect that such-and-such is true, are\nsuccessful in their aim and hit the truth. Zeno argues that some\nimpressions are cognitive. A number of Stoic definitions of the\ncognitive impression, formulated by Zeno and his successors, are\ntransmitted.  Scholars approach them in at least three ways. First,\nsome scholars consider one of the Stoic definitions (SE M 7.247\u201352) as\ncanonical (Nawar 2014, Shogry 2018). Two, scholars at times examine\nspecific exchanges between Stoics and skeptics in the assumption that\nsome clauses in Stoic definitions respond to skeptic objections (for\nexample, Nawar 2017). Three, scholars have also pointed out that, here\nas elsewhere, the Stoics offer a multitude of definitions, without\nprivileging one of them as \u201cthe\u201d definition; different\ndefinitions may speak to different dialectical contexts or theoretical\nfoci (Vogt 2022).\n\nWith some simplification, a cognitive impression reveals its content\nand that it is kataleptic (cf. Cicero, Academica\n2.77\u20138). For example, when I look at my computer screen\nwhile typing this, I may very well have a cognitive impression that\nthis is my computer screen. When I look up and out of the window, I\nhave an impression of a friend walking across campus that is probably\nnon-cognitive. This impression might be true. But since I see her from\nsuch a distance, it is pretty surely not cognitive. That is, not all\ntrue impressions are cognitive, but all cognitive impressions are\ntrue. We should only assent to cognitive impressions, and so in\nforming our beliefs, hold only those certified beliefs (cf. Brittain\n2014 on the Stoic view that assent to cognitive impressions is not\ncompelled).\n\nArcesilaus calls into question whether there are impressions of this\nkind. His main point seems to be that there could be an impression\nthat is phenomenologically indistinguishable from cognitive\nimpressions, but nevertheless misrepresents the matters it gives an\nimpression about. To use an example that may derive from Carneades\n(see section 3.2), there is no impression of a given egg such that no\nimpression of any other egg could be phenomenologically\nindistinguishable from it (Shogry 2018 and 2021, Machek and Veres\nforthcoming). Assuming that some clauses in Stoic definitions respond\nto specific skeptic challenges, the following clause, added to a\nshorter definition, appears to speak to these cases: \u201cand\nof such a kind as could not arise from what is not\u201d\n(Long and Sedley (1987) [= LS] 40; DL 7.46, 54; Cicero Acad.\n1.40\u20131, 2.77\u20138; SE M 7.247\u201352). Absent a\ncriterion of truth, Arcesilaus\u2019 skeptic suspends judgment about\neverything (PH 1.232). Reason itself, Arcesilaus thinks,\ndemands such suspension.\n\n(iii) Action. If skeptics suspend judgment, argues their dogmatic\nopponent, they are not able to act. Stoic philosophy conceives of\nthree movements of the mind: impression, assent, and impulse\n(Plutarch, Col. 1122a-d). All three figure in action. The\nagent assents to the impression that A is to be done; their\nassent is an impulse for the action A; if there is no\nexternal impediment, the impulse sets off the action (Inwood 1985). It\nis a cornerstone of Stoic philosophy that there can be no action\nwithout assent, and so without the belief that the action done is\nto be done. The Stoics aim to avoid the kind of determinism\naccording to which actions are not \u2018up to\u2019 the agent\n(Bobzien 1998); for them, assent, but not impression, is up to the\nagent. In response to the Apraxia Charge, Arcesilaus seems to have\nargued that the skeptic can act without having assented (Plutarch,\nCol. 1122A-d), and so without believing that the action done\nis to be done. However, this is not his complete response.\nFrom the point of view of the Stoics, skeptical action, if performed\nwithout the relevant kind of assent (that is, assent that it is up to\nthe agent to give, and that is a rational acceptance of the\nimpression), is like the action of a non-rational animal, or like the\nautomatic movement of plants when they grow and flourish. Arcesilaus\nis robbing people of their minds (Cicero Acad. 2.37\u20139;\nObdrzalek 2013). But Arcesilaus need not and does not go so far as to\ncompare human agents with non-rational agents. As human beings,\nskeptics have rational impressions. They perceive the world\nconceptually, and think about it. Arcesilaus does not suggest that\nskeptical action is causally set off by impressions, or in the way,\nwhatever that is, that animal actions are set off. This would be a\nproblematic proposal, for it would disregard that the skeptic has a\nhuman mind. Given the complexity of human thought, the skeptic is\nlikely to have several, and often competing impressions. If all\nimpressions triggered impulses, the skeptic would be inactive due to a\nkind of paralysis. The second component of Arcesilaus\u2019 reply,\nthus, is that the skeptic, in acting without assenting, adheres to the\nreasonable (eulogon) (SE M 7.158; 7.150; Striker\n2010). That is, Arcesilaus aims to explain skeptic action as rational\nagency (Cooper 2004b). Arcesilaus disputes the dogmatic claim that\nsome impressions can be identified as true, and the related claim that\none can only act on the belief that some impression is true.\nBut he does not argue that there are no differences between\nimpressions which agents could take into account. His agents are\nrational: they think about their options, and go with what looks, in\none way or another, more plausible.\n\nArcesilaus defends skeptical action also against Epicurean critics\n(Plutarch, Col. 1122A-d), again by showing on the basis of\nthe Epicureans\u2019 own premises that skeptical action is possible.\nCan the sceptic explain why, when leaving a room, they go through the\ndoor rather than running into the wall? Arcesilaus seems to have\nexploited the Epicurean view that, while all sense-perception is true,\nbelief can introduce falsehood. Like the Epicurean, the skeptic can\nkeep apart the perception and a view formed on its basis. By not\nassenting to the perception, thus adding belief (\u201chere is the\ndoor\u201d), the skeptic guards against the source of falsehood,\nnamely belief. But a skeptic has perception of the door available to\nthem, which is enough for not running into walls.\n3.2 Carneades\n\nLike Arcesilaus, Carneades (214\u2013129/8 BCE) refrains from writing\nand philosophizes in a Socratic spirit. Carneades led an embassy of\nthree philosophers from Athens to Rome in 156/5 BCE. Aside from his\nofficial role, he is said to have given two speeches, arguing for\njustice one day and against justice the next. Whether or not this is\nhistorically correct (Powell 2013), the traditional take on\nCarneades\u2019 speeches is not that he aims to overthrow justice.\nInstead, the upshot is taken to be that he wants to show that the\nsupporters of justice\u2014including Plato and Aristotle\u2014do not\nhave the successful arguments they think they have to show what\njustice is and what it requires (Lactantius, Epitome 55.8, LS\n68M). Like Arcesilaus, Carneades (i) engages with Stoic epistemology.\nHis account of skeptical action includes (ii) a detailed proposal\nregarding the criterion. As part of his less radical skepticism,\nCarneades seems (iii) to allow for a certain kind of assent, and\nperhaps for belief.\n\n(i) The Stoic-Academic Debate. Chrysippus, the third major Stoic\n(after Zeno and Cleanthes), and his student Diogenes of Babylon,\nrevise Zeno\u2019s epistemology, defending it against\nArcesilaus\u2019 arguments (Brittain 2006, xiii). In response to\ntheir arguments, Carneades continues the exchange with the Stoics that\nArcesilaus began (SE M 7.402\u201310). His first move\naddresses the link between mental states and action. People in states\nof madness, he argues, act just as easily and naturally on their\nimpressions as other people, even those who act on cognitive\nimpressions (if there are any). From the point of view of exhibited\nbehavior, there does not seem to be a difference: any and all\nimpressions, even those the Stoics think clearly arise from something\nthat is not, are in all respects relevant to action completely on a\npar. Cognitive impressions, if there are any, have no superiority.\n\nIn a second argument, Carneades points to objects that are similar to\none another: can the wise person discern any two eggs, two grains of\nsand, and so on? The Stoics have multiple replies. It is conceivable\nthat, in some contexts of action, the wise person assents to what is\nreasonable (eulogon) (DL 1.177), without having a cognitive\nimpression of how things are. Or, if faced with the task to identify\ngrains of sand while lacking a cognitive impression, the wise person\ncan suspend judgment. However, the wise will train themselves so as to\nbe able to perceive minute differences (Cicero, Acad. 2.57),\nwhere it might be important to do so. This point is backed up by Stoic\nphysics: no two items in the universe are identical, and their\ndifferences are in principle perceptible (Sedley 1982, 2002).\nCarneades replies that even if no two things were exactly alike\n(consistent with his general line of argument, he does not take a\nstance on such questions), a very close similarity could appear to\nexist for all perceivers (Cicero, Acad. 2.83\u20135); that\nis, the impressions of two items, though in fact these items might\ndiffer from each other, could be indistinguishable (Nawar 2017, Shogry\n2018 and 2021). Discussion continues with a move on the part of the\nStoics: they add to their definition of the cognitive impression\n\u201cone that has no impediment.\u201d Sometimes an impression\nis\u2014as it were, by itself\u2014cognitive, but is unconvincing\ndue to external circumstances (SE M 7.253). It is a difficult\nquestion whether this addition harms the Stoics more than it helps\nthem. If the initial conception of a cognitive impression hangs on the\nidea that something about its phenomenological nature, or something\ninternal to the impression, marks it as cognitive, the Stoics give up\non a crucial assumption if they grant that sometimes there are\n\u201cimpediments.\u201d If, however, cognitive impressions are\ndifferentiated by a causal feature (the way they are caused by the\n\u2018imprinter\u2019 which causes the \u2018imprint\u2019), the\nfurther addition might help (Frede 1983, Nawar 2014), since the\nimpediment might need to be removed before the causal connection could\nbe confirmed (Hankinson 2003).\n\n(ii) Carneades\u2019 Criterion. Even though Carneades further pursues\na discussion begun by Arcesilaus, he does not simply continue within\nthe framework of Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism. The distinctiveness of\nhis position is best seen in the context of his criterion: the\npersuasive (pithanon). The notion of the persuasive can be\nunderstood in two distinctively different ways. Persuasiveness might\nbe a causal feature, so that a persuasive impression sets off a\nphysiological process of being moved in a certain way. But there may\nalso be a rational kind of persuasiveness. Carneades construes\npersuasiveness in rational terms. For him, the persuasive is the\nconvincing, or perhaps even the plausible.\n\nCarneades develops a three-stage criterion: (1) In matters of\nimportance, skeptics adhere to the persuasive. (2) In matters of\ngreater importance, they adhere to the persuasive and undiverted. A\npersuasive impression is undiverted if there is no tension between it\nand its surrounding impressions. (3) In matters that contribute to\nhappiness, skeptics adhere to persuasive, undiverted, and thoroughly\nexplored impressions. A persuasive impression is undiverted and\nthoroughly explored when it and the surrounding impressions are\nclosely examined without its persuasiveness being diminished (SE\nM 7.166\u201384). Consider an example. A skeptic looks in a\ndark room for a rope. Before they pick up what appears to them to be a\nrope, they look closely and poke it with a stick. Coiled objects can\nbe ropes, but they can also be snakes. The persuasive impression that\nthis is a rope must be examined before the skeptic adheres to it\n(M 7.187).\n\nThe three-stage criterion is put forward in the context of action.\nHowever, Sextus describes Carneades\u2019 criterion as a criterion of\ntruth, not a criterion of action (M 7.173). Carneades might\ntake himself to offer more than a practical criterion. His discussions\nof the persuasive come close to a general epistemological theory\n(Couissin 1929 [1983], Striker 1980, Bett 1989 and 1990, Allen 1994\nand 2004 [2006], Brittain 2001). Cicero renders the Greek\npithanon as probabile (and sometimes as veri\nsimile), which modern editors sometimes translate in terms of\nwhat is probable or likely to be true. Some scholars think that\nCarneades is an early thinker about likelihoods, and argue that he\ndevelops a fallibilist epistemology (Obdrzalek 2004).\n\n(iii) Assent and Belief. Does adherence to persuasive impressions\ninvolve belief? Carneades coins a term for the kind of adherence he\nhas been describing: approval (Cicero, Acad. 2.99). He\ndistinguishes it from assent in the sense of Stoic and other dogmatic\ntheories, which establishes a belief that something is in actual fact\ntrue; but he nevertheless describes it as a kind of assent (Cicero,\nAcad. 2.104). Carneades\u2019 disciples disagree on whether\napproval is any kind of genuine assent. That is, they disagree on\nwhether, in approval, one forms a belief. Philo and Metrodorus think\nthat Carneades allows for some kind of belief, close to or identical\nwith belief as the Stoics understand it. Clitomachus disagrees, and\nCicero follows Clitomachus (Acad. 2.78, see also 2.59, 2.67).\nScholars continue to debate these issues (Allen 2022), and the basic\nproblem remains unchanged. It is not clear whether there is a\nplausible notion of belief according to which belief falls short of\n\u2018holding to be true\u2019 (or according to which, though some\nkind of \u2018holding true\u2019 is involved, the relevant\naffirmation-as-true is weaker than in beliefs as Stoics and other\ndogmatist epistemologists conceive of them). In any event,\naffirmations as true, at least of the full and flat-out (\u201cin\nactual fact\u201d) sort the Stoics think of, are precisely what the\nskeptic does not make.\n\nAnother approach to Carneades\u2019 stance toward belief is to ask\nwhether he might invoke Platonic considerations. Consider that\nSocrates, when asked in the Republic what he thinks the good\nis, refuses to reply because he thinks beliefs without knowledge are\nshameful (Rp. 506c). In response to this, his interlocutors\npoint out that there is a difference between putting forward\none\u2019s beliefs as if one knew them to be true, and putting them\nforward with the proviso that they are merely beliefs (Vogt 2012a, ch.\n2). The shamefulness of mere belief might disappear through this\nproviso. A passage in Cicero\u2019s Academica suggests that\nCarneades invokes this thought. According to Carneades, the wise\nperson can hold beliefs if they fully understand them to be beliefs\n(2.148). Along similar lines, it has been suggested that Carneades\nmight conceive of a hypothetical mode of believing (Striker 1980\n[1996, 112]), perhaps engaging with a move in Plato\u2019s\nMeno. Investigation cannot get off the ground if we do not,\nin some sense, begin with our beliefs about the matter under\ninvestigation. But how can we do so without endorsing our beliefs, not\nknowing whether our views are true? Plato\u2019s answer at this point\nis: by hypothesizing our beliefs. Today we would insist that\nhypotheses are not beliefs. However, it is conceivable that Carneades\nargued along these lines, and that the details of his vocabulary got\nlost or confused in doxography.\n3.3 Later Academic Skepticism\n\nCarneades was an enigma to his students and immediate successors.\nClitomachus (head of the Academy from 127 to 110 BCE) seems to have\nattempted the impossible: to adhere closely to Carneades\u2019\nphilosophy, even though he never understood what Carneades truly meant\n(Levy 2010). The cornerstone of his adherence lies in the view that\nCarneades argues for suspension of judgment and against beliefs\nunderstood as Stoics understand them. Philo of Larissa, another\nstudent of Carneades, interprets his teacher as allowing for tentative\nbeliefs in the skeptic\u2019s life. With Philo, the skeptical era of\nPlato\u2019s Academy comes to an end. Philo\u2019s philosophy seems\nto divide into two phases. In Athens, and as head of the Academy, he\nstays relatively close to Carneades. Moving to Rome later in his\ncareer, he develops a markedly different position. He argues only\nnarrowly against the Stoic criterion and their conception of\ncognition. One can apprehend things and so come to know\nthem\u2014one just cannot apprehend them in the way in which the\nStoics construe cognition (PH 1.235). The fact that there is\nno apprehension in the sense of the Stoics does not mean that there is\nno knowledge (Acad. 2.14). This move shifts the discussion in\nseveral important ways. First, Philo can be interpreted as a kind of\nexternalist: one can know something without knowing that one knows it.\nAbsent Stoic cognitive impressions, we are not able to identify which\ninstances of \u2018holding-true\u2019 qualify as knowledge; but we\nnevertheless have some knowledge (Hankinson 2010). Second, this\nproposal is a step toward modern skepticism, which is not concerned\nwith criteria of truth, but with knowledge.\n\nCicero\u2019s skeptical philosophy in his own philosophical writings\nis again distinctively different. In line with his notions of what is\nprobable (probabile) or likely to be true (veri\nsimile), Cicero often examines a range of philosophical\npositions, aiming to find out which of them is most rationally\ndefensible. He thinks it is better for us to adopt a view that is\nlikely to be true, rather than remain unconvinced by either side\n(Thorsrud 2009, 84\u2013101). Cicero is of the greatest importance\nfor the transition between ancient and early modern skepticism. As in\nother fields of philosophy, Cicero\u2019s influence is partly the\ninfluence of the translator. In transposing philosophical ideas into\nthe language of a different culture, the ideas change. Cicero\nsometimes speaks of doubting, dubitari (e.g., Acad.\n2.27, 106; however, he often sticks with the earlier language of\nassent and suspension). But doubt has no place in Greek skepticism\n(see section 1).\n4. Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n4.1 Early Figures: Pyrrho and Timon\n\nWhen comparing Pyrrhonian and Academic skepticism, two topics stand\nout: Pyrrhonism aims at tranquility; and it assigns pride of place to\nappearances. Anecdotes about Pyrrho\u2019s life (365/60\u2013275/70\nBC) convey how unaffected he was (DL 9.61\u201369). This kind of\nideal\u2014a tranquil state of mind\u2014is not part of Academic\nskepticism, and scholars disagree on its role in Pyrrhonism\n(Machuca 2006; Striker 2010; Perin 2020; on Democritean\ninfluences on tranquility in Pyrrho and Timon, cf. Svavarsson 2013).\nInsofar as the point of the anecdotes about Pyrrho\u2019s life is\nthat Pyrrho did not avoid or pursue anything with fervor, or that he\ndid not despair about things that other people find terrible, they\ncapture ideas that remain central to Pyrrhonism (for a general account\nof early Pyrrhonism, cf. Castagnoli 2013; on Sextus\u2019 take\non Pyrrhonian tranquility, cf. Svavarsson 2015).\n\nThe biographical anecdotes portray Pyrrho as a strikingly\nunconventional figure, unaffected not just by emotion and belief, but\nalso by perception\u2014to the extent that friends had to pull him\noff the street when a wagon approached (DL 9.62). At the same time,\nPyrrho seems to have said that the skeptic adheres to appearances\n(phainomena) (DL 9.106; Bett 2000, 84\u201393; on earlier\nnotions of appearances relevant to skepticism, cf. Barney 1992). This\nmight suggest that he would not cross the street when a wagon is\napproaching, and so appears to him. One story makes Pyrrho appear\nnot only unusual, but arguably a not so sympathetic character. Passing\nby a drowning man, he was so unmoved that he simply walked on (DL\n9.63). This is in rather stark contrast with Stoic notions of\nunaffectedness, where the idea would be that, not being disturbed by\nemotions like fear and panic, the passerby is ideally equipped to help\neffectively. Some biographical details can seem to mold\nPyrrho\u2019s life to fit the schema of the sage: a traveler to the\nEast (Flintoff 1980), whose insights are conveyed in brief sayings; an\nenigmatic figure, exemplary and shocking at the same time. Though it\nis difficult to assess the testimony on Pyrrho\u2019s travels,\nscholars increasingly explore resonances between Pyrrho\u2019s\npronouncements, later Pyrrhonian skepticism, and dimensions of\nBuddhist philosophy (Hanner 2020). For example, Mill (2018) argues\nthat a tradition in classical Indian philosophy develops a\n\u201cskepticism about philosophy\u201d that resembles dimensions of\nPyrrhonian thought.\n\nEven though he discussed tranquility and adherence to appearances,\nPyrrho was arguably no Pyrrhonian skeptic (Bett 2000, 14\u201362).\nThat is, it is likely that he put forward a dogmatic position, in the\nsense that he had positive philosophical views about the character of\nreality. Pyrrho wrote nothing. Much of what we know about him is\npreserved through the writings of Timon, his adherent\n(325/20\u2013235/30 BCE) (Burnyeat 1980b; Clayman 2009). The\nmost important piece of testimony is a passage reporting an account by\nTimon:\n\nIt is necessary above all to consider our own knowledge; for if it is\nin our nature to know nothing, there is no need to inquire any further\ninto other things. [\u2026] Pyrrho of Elis was also a powerful\nadvocate of such a position. He himself has left nothing in writing;\nhis pupil Timon, however, says that the person who is to be happy must\nlook to these three points: first, what are things like by nature?\nsecond, in what way ought we to be disposed towards them? and finally,\nwhat will be the result for those who are so disposed? He [Timon] says\nthat he [Pyrrho] reveals that things are equally indifferent and\nunstable and indeterminate (adiaphora kai astathm\u00eata kai\nanepikrita); for this reason, neither our perceptions nor our\nbeliefs tell the truth or lie (adoxastous kai aklineis kai\nakradantous). For this reason, then, we should not trust them,\nbut should be without opinions and without inclinations and without\nwavering, saying about each single thing that it no more is than is\nnot, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not (ou mallon\nestin \u00ea ouk estin \u00ea kai esti kai ouk estin\n\u00ea oute estin oute ouk estin). Timon says that the result\nfor those who are so disposed will be first speechlessness\n(aphasia), but then freedom from worry (ataraxia);\nand Aenesidemus says pleasure. These, then, are the main points of\nwhat they say (Aristocles in Eusebius PE 14.18.1\u20135 =\nDC53; tr. Bett 2000 with changes)\n\n\nIn response to the first question, how things are in their nature,\nPyrrho makes a metaphysical claim: they are indeterminate (Bett 2000,\n14\u201329). There are no stable items, or no items with stable\nproperties. Scholars sometimes hesitate to ascribe such a position to\nPyrrho, because it is undoubtedly dogmatic. Perhaps the text can be\ngiven an epistemological reading: things are indifferentiable and\nunmeasurable and undecidable, because we fail in differentiating,\nmeasuring, and determining how they are (Svavarsson 2010; Thorsrud\n2010). But Pyrrho\u2019s response to the second question may only\nfollow if we adopt the metaphysical reading (Bett 2000, 29\u201337).\nPyrrho infers that our perceptions and beliefs are neither true nor\nfalse. They are not truth-evaluable, presumably because there are no\nfacts which could be correctly captured. Third, if we understand these\nthings, speechlessness (aphasia) follows, and then\ntranquility (ataraxia). Pyrrho does not say that we should\ncease to speak. He suggests that we adopt a complicated mode of\nspeech, constructed around the expression ou mallon\n(\u201cno more\u201d), which aims to capture the indeterminate\nnatures of things, when we attempt to say anything about anything\n(Bett 2000, 37\u201339; Vogt 2021).\n4.2 Aenesidemus, the Ten Modes, and Appearances\n\nAenesidemus (first century BCE) was discontented with the views\ndiscussed in the Academy at his time, of which he began as an\nadherent. Philo\u2019s proto-externalism as well as a counterposition\nformulated by Antiochus both appeared to him dogmatic. Aenesidemus\naimed to revive a more radical skepticism, and left the Academy for\nthis purpose. Arguably, he is the first Pyrrhonian skeptic.\nAenesidemus wrote a treatise, the Pyrrhonian Discourses,\nprobably similar in structure to Sextus\u2019 Outlines of\nPyrrhonism and partially preserved in a summary by Photius:\na general account of skepticism, followed by books on particular\nphilosophical questions (Hankinson 2010). The basic elements of\nAenesidemus\u2019 skepticism are: the skeptic puts appearances and\nthoughts into opposition; this generates equipollence\n(isostheneia, lit. \u201cof equal weight\u201d) between\nseveral appearances and/or thoughts; suspension of judgment follows;\nwith it comes tranquility; and the skeptic leads a life according to\nappearances (DL 9.62, 78, 106\u20137). However, we do not know much\ndetail of his views on these matters. Instead, Aenesidemus is famous\nfor having developed Ten Modes or Tropes\u2014forms of argument by\nwhich the sceptic puts appearances and thoughts into opposition. Key\nquestions about Aenesidemus\u2019 skepticism concern (i) the\ninterpretation of his Modes, (ii) the relationship of his philosophy\nto competing theories, (iii) the scope of the Ten Modes, and (iv) the\nskeptic\u2019s mode of speech.\n\n(i) Conflicting Appearances or Causal Invariance. The Ten Modes are\npreserved in Diogenes Laertius (9.78\u201388), Philo of Alexandria\n(On Drunkenness 169\u2013202), and Sextus. Diogenes\u2019\naccount of the Ten Modes may postdate Sextus\u2019 (Sedley\n2015). Sextus gives extensive illustrations, and integrates the Ten\nModes into his general account of Pyrrhonism (PH\n1.36\u2013163; cf. M 7.345 for ascription of the Ten Modes\nto Aenesidemus; cf. Annas-Barnes 1985 and Hankinson 1995, 268; the\nsequence below follows Sextus). Here is the first of the Ten Modes,\ninterpreted in two ways.\n\n\n10\u20131:\n\nArguments concerning oppositions based on the differences between\nkinds of animals.\n\nConflicting Appearances Interpretation:\n\nX appears F to animal of kind A (e.g.,\nhumans) and F* to animal of kind B [where F\nand F* are opposite or otherwise incompatible properties]. We\ncannot judge how X really is, because we are a party to the\ndispute.\n\nCausal Invariance Interpretation:\n\nFor something to be \u2018really\u2019 F, it would have to\nconsistently affect different perceivers as F. But different\nconstitutions of different animals cause different impressions of the\nsame thing. For different animals, something is F and\nF* (where F and F* are opposite or\notherwise incompatible properties). Therefore, things do not seem to\nreally be F or F*.\n\n\nThe Conflicting Appearances Interpretation is based on Sextus\u2019\naccount (Annas-Barnes 1985). The focus here is on the idea that every\nkind of animal, perceiver, sensory faculty, thinker, or judger\n(depending on which mode we consider) is only one of several animals,\nperceivers, sensory faculties, thinkers, or judgers. The object is\nperceived or considered from a particular point of view. Everyone is a\nparty to the dispute, and there is no \u2018view from nowhere.\u2019\nAccordingly, the dispute cannot be decided. The Causal Invariance\nInterpretation, on the other hand, suggests that the focus on\ndecidability is introduced by Sextus. Aenesidemus may (implicitly or\nexplicitly) have endorsed the following idea: if X were\nF by nature, X would affect everyone as F.\nIf X affects different people (living beings, sensory\nfaculties, etc.) as F and F*, X is by\nnature neither F nor F*. For example, if X\nis harmful to A and beneficial to B, it is neither\nharmful nor beneficial in its nature (Woodruff 2010, Bett 2000). The\nTen Modes can generally be construed as engaging either with conflicts\nbetween appearances or with causal invariance:\n\n\n10\u20132:\n\nArguments based on the differences among human beings (differences in\nbody and in soul).\n\n10\u20133:\n\nArguments based on the differences between the senses and on the\ncomplexity of perceived objects.\n\n10\u20134:\n\nArguments based on states (dispositions and conditions of a human\nbeing, such as age, motion versus rest, emotions, etc.).\n\n10\u20135:\n\nArguments based on positions, distances, and places.\n\n10\u20136:\n\nArguments based on mixtures (objects in conjunction with external\nthings like air and humidity; physical constituents of sense organs;\nphysiology of thought).\n\n10\u20137:\n\nArguments based on the composition of the perceived object.\n\n10\u20138:\n\nArguments based on relativity (to the judging subject, to\ncircumstances, etc.). 10\u20138 comprises at least 10\u20131 to 10\u20137, or all Ten\nModes.\n\n10\u20139:\n\nArguments based on constancy or rarity of occurrence.\n\n10\u201310:\n\nArguments concerned with ways of life, customs, laws, mythical\nbeliefs, and dogmatic assumptions, all of which can be put into\nopposition to each other.\n\n\n(ii) Skepticism, Relativism, Epicureanism. Consider first the\nrelationship between skepticism and relativism (cf. Bett 2000; Vogt\n2012a, ch. 4). Relativism, as envisaged in Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus, looks at a similar range of phenomena. Things\nappear different to different kinds of animals; to different people;\nand so on. Relativism embraces the intuition that there is (as we\nwould say today) faultless disagreement. That is, you and I disagree,\nbut neither of us is wrong. Accordingly, metaphysical relativism\nclaims we must give up the intuition that we both refer to the same\nthing. In the Theaetetus, the world dissolves into radical\nflux: there are no stable items with stable properties that we both\nrefer to.\n\nThe Ten Modes, according to Conflicting Appearances, differ from\nrelativism by turning precisely the other way (Annas-Barnes 1985,\n97\u20138; Pellegrin 1997, 552\u20133). They implicitly rely on the\nintuition that there are stable items with stable properties. Of\ncourse, the skeptic is not committed to the thesis that opposites\ncannot hold of the same thing, and that therefore no two conflicting\nappearances can be true. However, the modes presuppose a common sense\nmetaphysics that does not accommodate faultless disagreement. In all\ncases of disagreement, at best one of us can be right. If we cannot\nfigure out which view is right, we should suspend. This does not mean\nthat Pyrrhonians are committed to a common-sense metaphysics. The Ten\nModes are only one of several tools that skeptics have at their\ndisposal. They may thus imply a metaphysics that, at other points,\nskeptics would call into question (cf. Fine 2003b, 352).\n\nCausal Invariance differs from Conflicting Appearances precisely with\nrespect to the metaphysics that is, even if only dialectically,\ninvoked. Aenesidemus seems to have explored the relationship between\nskepticism and flux. He remarks that skepticism leads to Heraclitean\nphilosophy. The idea that one thing appears to have contrary\nproperties (the ones it appears to different animals/persons/senses to\nhave) leads to the idea that one thing actually has contrary\nproperties (PH 1.210; cf. Schofield 2007 on the role of\nHeraclitus and causal invariance). This remark can be taken as an\nexpression both of moderate flux and of relativism (Aenesidemus does\nnot seem to think of radical flux, where it is no longer even possible\nto refer to anything). There is no stable reality of how things are\n(moderate flux); X is F and F* insofar as,\nif X seems F to A, this is true for\nA, and F* to B, this is true for B\n(relativism). This proposal differs from the Causal Invariance\ninterpretation of the Modes presented above. There, Aenesidemus seems\nto argue that things do not really have stable properties (they are\nneither F nor F* by nature); he does not say that\nthey are F and F* (as relativism says).\n\nA third approach, competing with skepticism and relativism, is\nEpicurean epistemology. Again, the set of phenomena to be accounted\nfor is the same. But it is described differently. Epicurus insists\nthat we should not even speak of conflicting appearances. Rather, we\nshould speak of different perceptions. Perceptions cannot refute each\nother, because they are of the same weight. Epicurus here uses the\nterm that is central to Pyrrhonism: equal weight,\nisostheneia (DL 10.31\u20132). The fact that\nperceptions differ has perfectly reasonable explanations: I look from\na distance, you look from nearby; I have a cold, you are healthy; I am\na human being, another cognizer is a dog; and so on. These facts\nfigure in the explanations of how our perceptions are constituted.\nAccordingly, Epicurus argues, all perceptions, even though they\ndiffer, are true. They all have a causal history that physics can\nexplain. The precise interpretation of this proposal is controversial.\nOne might object that the notion of truth employed here is deeply\npuzzling. It is not clear what it means to describe all perceptions as\ntrue if they cannot be true or false.\n\n(iii) Scope. For the greatest part, the Ten Modes seem to be concerned\nwith perception in a broad sense, so that it includes pleasure and\npain, harm and benefit, as well as pursuit and avoidance. To perceive\nsomething as pleasant or beneficial is to pursue it. Perception and\nevaluation are also mixed in another way: depending on the frequency\nwith which we perceive something, it seems more or less amazing and\nprecious to us. 10\u201310 envisages oppositions that can\nbe construed with the help of dogmatic theses. The Ten Modes thus fit\nSextus\u2019 description of what skepticism is: the ability to put\nappearances and thoughts (phainomena and nooumena)\ninto opposition (PH 1.8, 1.31\u201333; cf. DL 9.78).\n\nAnother issue concerning the scope of the Ten Modes is whether they\naddress general or particular matters. Compare the example of whether\nthe tower is round or square (T) to the example of whether honey is\nsweet or bitter (H). (T) is a particular; the question is whether this\ntower is round or square. (H) can be construed as a particular\n(\u201cis this bit of honey sweet?\u201d), or as a general issue\n(\u201cis honey sweet?\u201d). The Ten Modes offer strategies for\nsuspension of judgment on both kinds of questions.\n\nScholars have asked whether it is a problem for skepticism if the Ten\nModes appear \u2018systematic\u2019 (Sedley 2015). A set of\narguments that aims to be complete, covering domains according to a\nstandardized pattern, may appear to be out of tune with the\nskeptic\u2019s presumed mode of investigation. Purportedly, skeptics\nthink through given questions as they arise, arriving at suspension of\njudgment in a piecemeal fashion. If this self-description is to be\ntaken at face value, then modes of generating suspension of judgment\nacross the board may appear problematic. In this respect, Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 report of the Ten Modes may be superior to\nSextus\u2019 account. Diogenes begins with a remark that suggests\nthat skeptics pick up where other philosophers have already begun to\nmake an argument (9.78\u20139). Other philosophers have collected,\npresumably, ways in which \u2018we are persuaded\u2019, say, because\nthings regularly appear the same way. Now the skeptics, as it were in\nresponse to this, add a collection of further cases, where things do\nnot appear the same way to different cognizers. If this is the\ndialectical set-up, the Ten Modes may not be \u2018systematic\u2019\nin ways that harm skepticism. They may co-opt the patterns of dogmatic\nreports about cases where appearances are stable (Sedley 2015).\n\n(iv) Language. Aenesidemus contributes an interesting move to the\nquestion of how the skeptic can speak. Consider the relationship\nbetween a skeptic\u2019s state of mind and their utterances. One way\nto construe this relationship is that an utterance reflects a state of\nmind. This is a background assumption to the idea that, if skeptics\nuse assertoric language, they hold beliefs. Another option is to\nassume that language does not have the means to capture the\nskeptic\u2019s state of mind. On this premise, a skeptic might flag\ntheir utterances as falling short of doing so. This is\nAenesidemus\u2019 strategy. He says that the Pyrrhonian determines\nnothing, and not even this fact that he determines nothing. The\nPyrrhonian puts matters in such terms, he says, because he has no way\nto express the actual thought of the sceptic in determining nothing\n(Photius, Bibl. 169b40\u2013170a14, = 71C(6)-(8) LS).\n4.3 Agrippa, and the Five Modes\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Agrippa (1st to\n2nd century CE; SE PH 1.164\u2013177; DL\n9.88\u201389). However, the modes of argument that Sextus calls the\nFive Modes are attributed to him. These modes are among the most\nfamous arguments of ancient skepticism (Barnes 1990, Hankinson\n2010).\n\n\n5\u20131 Diaph\u00f4nia:\n\nThe mode that argues from disagreement. With respect to some matter\nthat presents itself, there is undecided (anepikriton)\nconflict, both among the views of ordinary life and the views held by\nphilosophers. Due to this, we are unable to choose or reject one\nthing, and must fall back on suspension.\n\n5\u20132 Eis apeiron ekballonta:\n\nArguments that throw one into an infinite regress. That which\nis brought forward to make a given matter credible needs yet something\nelse to make it credible, and so on ad infinitum.\nSince we thus have no starting point for our argument, suspension of\njudgment follows.\n\n5\u20133 Pros ti:\n\nArguments from relativity. X only ever appears\nsuch-and-such in relation to the subject judging and to the things\nobserved together with it. Suspension on how X really is\nfollows.\n\n5\u20134 Hypothesis:\n\nSomeone makes an assumption without providing argument. A dogmatist,\nif thrown back into an infinite regress of arguments, just assumes\nsomething as a starting-point, without providing an argument\n(anapodeikt\u00f4s). We suspend over mere\nhypotheses\u2014they could be false, opposite hypotheses could be\nformulated, and so on.\n\n5\u20135 Ton diall\u00ealon:\n\nArguments that disclose a circularity. This mode is used when\nthat which ought to confirm a given investigated matter requires\nconfirmation (pistis\u2014credibility) from that matter. We\nare unable to assume either in order to establish the other. We\nsuspend judgment on both.\n\n\nIt is a commonplace to say that, while the Ten Modes, as presented in\nSextus, are concerned with conflicting appearances, the Five Modes are\nabout argument or proof. In these modes, the skeptics develop\nstrategies by which to attack theories that the dogmatists defend. If\nthis is how we characterize the Modes, Aristotle\u2019s objection\n(section 2.3) immediately comes to mind. Do the Five Modes reveal the\nskeptic\u2019s lack of understanding because they presuppose that\neverything is subject to proof? (Barnes 1990; Hankinson 1995,\n182\u201392; Long 2006, ch.3) The three so-called formal\nmodes\u2014Regress, Hypothesis, and Circularity\u2014can be\nconstrued in this fashion: when employing them, the skeptic can argue\nthat every premise must be supported by argument; if it is not so\nsupported, the theory begins from a mere hypothesis (on earlier uses\nof the term hupothesis in Plato and in medicine, cf. Cooper\n2002 [2004a]); or it is ultimately circular.\n\nHowever, the skeptic might not be vulnerable to this objection. First,\nthe Five Modes can be construed as dialectical, invoking dogmatic\ntheories of justification (Striker 2004). Second, they might be\nbroader in scope. 5\u20131 and 5\u20133\nexplore disagreement and relativity. Skeptical examination often\nbegins with the Mode of Disagreement: different answers to a given\nquestion are surveyed, and the conflict between them is observed. The\ninterpretation of 5\u20131 hangs, for the most part, on\nthe question of whether anepikriton should be translated as\n\u2018undecided\u2019 or \u2018undecidable\u2019 (Barnes 1990). It\nwould be dogmatic to claim that matters are undecidable. The\nPyrrhonist must prefer the idea that, up to now, matters have not been\ndecided. In applying the Mode of Disagreement, skeptics can\neither record a conflicting argument that others have formulated or\ncome up with an argument that disagrees with a view formulated by a\ndogmatist (cf. Sienkiewicz 2019, 47\u201351). This leads to the question of\nwhether something can be found that would decide matters, and thus to\nthe application of further modes. Scholars have observed that\n5\u20133, the Mode of Relativity, does not really fit into\nthe Five Modes. However, the Five Modes could be designed to supersede\nand include the Ten Modes, and 5\u20133 might be viewed as\ncapturing the common thread of the Ten Modes. With the help of\n5\u20133, the skeptic can argue that the premises that\ntheorists employ are formulated from particular points of view, in\nparticular contexts, and so on (for a reading that emphasizes the role\nof the first mode at the expense of the role of the third, cf.\nSienkiewicz 2019).\n\nThird, even the so-called formal modes (5-2,\n5\u20134, 5\u20135) might not be narrowly\nconcerned with proof, but rather with everything that can lend\ncredibility to something else. Consider Regress\n(5\u20132), the first of the formal modes. The text does\nnot actually speak of proof (apodeixis) (this is obscured by\nBury\u2019s Loeb translation; 5\u20134 is the only place\nin Sextus\u2019 report of the Five Modes that uses a cognate of\napodeixis). Sextus\u2019 language is wider: the mode deals\nwith everything that can make something else credible. We might read\nthis in the context of the Hellenistic view that proof is a species of\nsign (PH 2.122). A sign reveals something non-evident. Smoke\nthat reveals fire has, from this point of view, a function and\nstructure that is similar to a proof. The target of the Five Modes\nmight be sign-inferences in general. If this is so, then their target\nmight include what we would call inductive reasoning and causal\nexplanations (when Sextus introduces a further set of modes, the\nCausal Modes, he says that they are not really needed, because the\nrelevant work can be done by the Five Modes; PH\n1.180\u201386). Taken together, the Five Modes deny all \u201cproof,\ncriterion, sign, cause, movement, learning, coming into being, and\nthat there is anything by nature good or bad.\u201d (DL 9.90). This\nis notably more than just proof. Indeed, it is an excellent summary of\nthe key topics in Sextus\u2019 discussions of logic, physics, and\nethics.\n4.4 Sextus Empiricus\n\nSextus\u2019 (ca. 160\u2013210 CE) epithet, Empiricus, indicates\nthat he belonged to the empiricists, a medical school (cf.\nSvavarson 2014 for a brief conspectus of Sextus\u2019 philosophy).\nThe empiricist medical school argued against rationalistic tendencies\nin medicine (Frede 1990; Allen 2010). Rationalism in medicine aims to\ngive causal explanations as a basis for therapies. Empiricism, on the\ncontrary, confines itself to observation and memory. Somewhat\nconfusingly (considering his name), Sextus discusses differences\nbetween Pyrrhonism and empiricism, and says that skepticism is closer\nto medical methodism than to empiricism (Allen 2010). On the whole, it\nmay be safest to think of Sextus as rejecting medical rationalism as\nwell as other trends within medicine that by Sextus\u2019 lights are\ndogmatic. Methodism follows appearances, and derives from them what\nseems beneficial. No explanations are attempted, no underlying\nsubstances postulated, and no regularities assumed\u2014these are\nsome of the rationalistic methods that both methodism and empiricism\nargue against. Methodism also makes no statements to the effect that\nsuch explanations cannot be given, or that underlying substances and\nregularities do not exist, as Sextus says empiricism does (SE\nPH 1.236\u2013241). Beyond the fact that Sextus was a\ndoctor and wrote on medicine (M 7.202, M 1.61), his philosophical\nthinking seems shaped by engagement with medical writers. Scholars\nhave long been interested in the relationship between medicine and\nskeptical arguments that pertain to be therapeutic (Voelke 1990). More\nrecently, scholars explore ways in which medical writings, in\nparticular by Galen, inform Sextus\u2019 thinking, even on specific\nissues such as how to conceive of and solve sophisms (Schmitt,\nforthcoming). It has also been argued that the skeptics\u2019\napplication of the modes should be interpreted in light of the\nmethodological commitments of non-rationalist medicine (Sienkiewicz\n2019, 2021).\n\nSextus\u2019 philosophical writings are traditionally divided into\ntwo groups. The Outlines of Pyrrhonism [PH] consists\nof three books. PH 1 is the only general account of\nPyrrhonism that survives. PH 2 and 3 discuss questions of\nlogic, physics, and ethics. The other writings are summarily referred\nto, traditionally, as Against the Mathematicians\n[M]. In fact, they oppose not just mathematical, but also\nother theorists: the title really means Against the\nTheoreticians, or Against the Learned (Bett 2012). In a\nsense, only M 1\u20136 should go by that title. It is a\ncomplete work, and M 7 does not seem to be its continuation\n(Bett 2012, \u201cIntroduction\u201d). M 1\u20136 discuss\ngrammar, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astrology, and music theory.\nThey argue against theoretical \u2018learning\u2019 in these fields.\nM 7\u201311 discuss core questions of the three\nphilosophical disciplines, logic, physics, and ethics, and could\nplausibly be referred to as Against the Logicians (M\n7\u20138), Against the Physicists (M 9\u201310),\nand Against the Ethicists (M 11). Scholars disagree\non whether M is earlier (Bett 1997) or later than PH\n(Janacek 1948 and 1972). Scholars also disagree on whether we can\nevaluate different strands of skepticism within Sextus as more or less\nsophisticated. Those who consider PH as later often do so\nbecause they think it shows greater philosophical sophistication,\neither by avoiding claims that a certain matter cannot be known\n(sometimes described as negative dogmatism), as found in M\n1\u20136 and M 11, or by streamlining discussions from\nM 7\u201310 (Bett 1997; Brunschwig 1980).\n\nThese questions are complicated further by Sextus\u2019 attempt to\nincorporate diverse material, such as different sets of Modes, into\nhis skepticism. According to recent interpretations, the\ndifferent sets of modes are part of an integrated philosophical\napproach (Powers 2010). Morison (2018) argues that the Ten Modes and\nFive Modes both serve the same purpose: to produce equal and opposing\narguments to arguments in support of philosophical or scientific\nviews. Arguably, two kinds of consistency are at work in Sextus\u2019\nwritings. On the one hand, Sextus aims at the consistency of one\nphilosophical outlook. On the other hand, he aims at the consistency\nof having a response to every objection. These two aims overlap\ngreatly, but they can also come apart. A given argument might refute a\nparticular critic. This argument may go back to various earlier\nversions of Pyrrhonism. Similarly, the critical objection that is\nrefuted may be traced to dogmatic theories formulated over the course\nof several centuries. As a result, a given argument in Sextus may be\neffective against a given objection he has in mind. It may thus\npreserve consistency in the sense of leaving the skeptic unharmed by\ndogmatic criticism. But at the same time, this argument may have\nimplications that are in tension with the way in which Sextus explains\nskepticism in other passages. Such tensions are particularly important\nwith respect to the way in which Sextus uses core concepts. For\nexample, it is not clear that Sextus uses the notion of appearances\n(phainomena) in a consistent fashion (PH\n1.8\u20139; 1.15; 1.22; for the view that Sextus employs the notion\nconsistently throughout, see Barney 1992). At times, he draws on the\ncontrast between appearances and thoughts (noumena). But for\nthe most part, the term refers to all cases where something seems\nso-and-so to the skeptic, either perceptually or in thought. In some\ncontexts, Sextus draws on the idea that appearances are impressions,\ninvoking the dogmatic assumption that impressions are passive. In\nother contexts, he does not envisage appearances as entirely passively\nexperienced (Vogt 2012b).\n\nIt is thus no surprise that the interpretation of Sextus\u2019\nPyrrhonism is quite controversial. This applies in particular to the\nquestion of whether the skeptic has any beliefs, or beliefs of any\nkind. In the past 40 years, scholars have paid attention to this\nquestion more than to any other interpretive issue. Insofar as the\ntexts may contain different strands of Pyrrhonian argument, exegesis\nis to some extent shaped by the philosophical interests we bring to\nthe texts. Two ideas are particularly prominent here. First, some\nscholars find in Sextus an account of action that challenges standard\nancient and modern theories of agency. These theories might portray\nordinary agents as all-too-rational, as if every action involved an\nactively formed belief that such-and-such is good. Scholars explore\nhow far we can draw on Sextus, asking whether a life guided by\nappearances (as Sextus says the skeptic\u2019s life is) might after\nall be rather ordinary (Frede 1979 [1997]). Second, one might on the\nother hand embrace those aspects of Sextus\u2019 texts that make\nPyrrhonism look radically different from ordinary life. From this\nperspective, Sextus\u2019 writings invite reflection on the question\nof whether it would be possible to live without belief (Burnyeat 1980\n[1997]; Barnes 1982 [1997]; Burnyeat 1984 [1997]).\n\nPH 1, which figures most prominently in scholarly\ndiscussions, is a tour de force. Sextus gives a general\naccount of what skepticism is, including skeptical investigation,\nsuspension of judgment, the skeptic\u2019s end, action, and language;\nhe gives lists and illustrations of various sets of Modes; he explains\nthe so-called skeptical formulae (ph\u00f4nai), such as\n\u201cI determine nothing,\u201d \u201cnon-assertion,\u201d\n\u201cmaybe,\u201d and so on; and he compares skepticism to\nrelevantly similar philosophies.\n\nSextus emphasizes that the skeptic is an investigator. Others either\narrive at theories (dogmatism) or at claims about inapprehensibility\n(negative dogmatism\u2014that the matter investigated is beyond\none\u2019s capacity to decide, and so is unknowable). But the skeptic\ncontinues to investigate (PH 1.1\u20134). Investigation is\ndescribed as setting appearances and thoughts into opposition\n(PH 1.8) (Morison 2011 offers a reconstruction of skepticism\nthat takes its starting\u2013point from this description), and as the\napplication of the various sets of Modes (PH 1.36\u2013186).\nSkepticism does not have teachings, but it is an approach in\nphilosophy (Smith 2022). Many of the thoughts the skeptics arrive at\nare expressed in the skeptical formulae (PH 1.13\u201315;\n187\u2013209). The starting\u2013point (arch\u00ea) of\nskepticism is divergency\u2014an\u00f4malia. The\nproto-skeptics are disturbed by the discrepancies they encounter, and\nbegin to investigate (PH 1.12). They hope to gain quietude by settling\nwhat is true and what is false. But then they have a surprising\nexperience. Encountering disagreement where several views appear to be\nof equal weight (isostheneia), they find themselves unable to\ndecide things, give up, and experience tranquility (ataraxia)\n(Striker 1990 [1996]; Nussbaum 1994). The skeptic\u2019s end\n(telos) is tranquility in matters of belief (kata\ndoxan) and moderate affection (metriopatheia) in matters\nthat are forced upon us (PH 1.25\u201329). That is, skeptics\ncan free themselves from those kinds of turmoil that come with holding\nbeliefs. They cannot free themselves from freezing, thirst, or pain.\nBut they suffer less than others, for they do not add the belief\n(prosdoxazein) that, for example, pain is bad. The skeptic\nmust explain how, without belief (adoxast\u00f4s), they can\nbe active. Sextus says that skeptics follow appearances, and that is,\nthat they adhere to the fourfold ways of life (PH\n1.21\u201324). Nature supplies them with perception and thought;\nnecessary affections compel them (for example, thirst guides them to\ndrink); they go along with traditions and customs; and they can do\ntechnical things by having been instructed in skills. The notion of\nappearances is also central to Sextus\u2019 account of how the\nskeptic can speak. Without making assertions, a skeptic reports\n(apangellein) like a chronicler (historik\u00f4s)\nwhat appears to them now (PH 1.4).\n\nI shall discuss the following aspects of Sextus\u2019 skepticism: (i)\ninvestigation and tranquility, (ii) concepts and inference rules,\n(iii) belief, (iv) the formulae, (v) appearances, (vi) language, (vii)\naction, and (viii) the so-called special arguments (that is, arguments\nthat do not explain the nature of Pyrrhonism, but engage with specific\ndogmatic theories in logic, physics, and ethics).\n\n(i) Investigation and tranquility. Investigation must aim at discovery\nof the truth, otherwise it is not genuine investigation. However, a\nskeptic seems to mechanically apply the skeptical Modes, in order to\ngenerate suspension of judgment and tranquility. Scholars disagree on\nwhether the skeptics genuinely aim at the truth (Palmer 2000;\nStriker 2001; Perin 2006; Veres 2020b), while they (also) aim at\ntranquility. Note that this objection, unlike the other problems\ncentral to contemporary engagement with ancient skepticism, was not\nraised in antiquity. If ancient skepticism is approached in the\ncontext of the larger study of ancient philosophy, we might first of\nall note that the skeptics in a sense agree with Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics. All these philosophers defend, in\nso many formulations, a life of reason, of contemplation, of wisdom,\nor of inquiry as the best or at least a very good human life (on\naffinities between the skeptics\u2019 commitment to inquiry and\nAristotle, cf. Olfert 2015). The objection that skeptical inquiry\nseems insincere, then, may not have come up in antiquity in quite the\nway in which it is discussed today because a commitment to inquiry\nwould be common ground among most philosophers. Further, we might\nobserve that aiming at the truth includes two aims: to accept truths,\nand to avoid falsehoods. The Modes are tailored to keep us from\nassenting to something that could be false. Insofar as the\nskeptic\u2019s effort to avoid falsehoods expresses a valuation for\nthe truth, the skeptic might be a genuine investigator (Vogt 2012a,\nch. 5; Olfert 2014).\n\nA related objection calls into question the actual practice of\nskeptical inquiry. Does Sextus rely on the assumption that, in any\ngiven case of putting several arguments into opposition, these\narguments are equally persuasive for the skeptic? This seems\nunrealistic: at least in some cases, skeptical inquirers are bound to\nbe more strongly attracted to one view than to another. How then do\nthey arrive at suspension of judgment? One skeptical strategy is to\nremind oneself that additional arguments will be formulated in the\nfuture (PH 1.33\u201334, 89, 96\u201397; 2.38\u201341;\n3.233\u201334). Another strategy is to consider that different\narguments are persuasive to different people (Svararsson 2014).\nRelatedly, skeptics may find themselves in a position comparable to a\nstudent who takes a seminar on freedom and determinism: it is possible\nto be more attracted to one view rather than another, and at the same\ntime be aware that as far as the arguments are concerned, there is\nunresolved disagreement among several views, to the effect that\nneither of the views seems compelling in ways that warrant assent (cf.\nVogt 2012a, ch. 5, on how the skeptical expression \u201cas far as\nthe argument is concerned\u201d bears on this question; for general\ndiscussion of this expression, cf. Brunschwig 1990).\n\n(ii) Concepts and rules of inference. If skeptics do not assent, then\nhow can they understand the terms philosophers use (M\n8.337\u2013332a)? Even more radically, how can they even think\n(PH 2.1\u201312)? This objection, which Sextus says is\ncontinually raised against the skeptics, proceeds on the assumption\nthat possession of concepts involves the acceptance of assumptions.\nFor example, in order to examine a given theory of proof, the skeptic\nmust have a notion of what proofs are. This involves assumptions: for\nexample, the assumption that a proof contains premises and a\nconclusion. Sextus\u2019 response to this objection invokes the\nEpicurean and Stoic theories of preconceptions. Human beings are not\nborn with reason (Frede 1994, 1996). The acquisition of reason is a\nnature-guided process of concept acquisition. At a given age, children\nhave completed this process. They have become rational, which means\nthat they can perceive and think in a conceptual way. Only now, they\nhave rational impressions to which they can assent. The acquisition of\npreconceptions did not involve assent, simply because the child was\nnot yet rational (Brittain 2005).\n\nSextus invokes dogmatic ideas about the acquisition of reason (or: the\nabilities of conceptual thought) in his response to the Apraxia Charge\n(PH 1.23\u20134). Skeptics are, first of all, active because\nnature has equipped them with perception and thought (Vogt 1998,\n2010). More generally, the skeptics\u2019 ability to think and\ninvestigate depends on the fact that they have acquired concepts as\npart of growing up. This process did not involve assent, and\naccordingly, Sextus argues that the skeptic\u2019s ability to think\ndoes not violate suspension of judgment (cf. Brunschwig 1988; Vogt\n2012a ch. 6; Grgic 2008; Fine 2011). It is conceivable, though, that\nthe skeptic\u2019s ability to understand involves some knowledge,\nnamely a kind of knowledge that does not entail any belief (Corti\n2009, part III; Corti 2015). This option appears counterintuitive\ngiven today\u2019s premises in epistemology, according to which\nsomeone who knows that p also believes that p. The relevant notion of\nbelief in skeptical discussions, doxa, as well as the\nrelevant ancient notions of knowledge, however, may behave quite\ndifferently (cf. Vogt 2012a and Moss and Schwab 2019 on belief;\nBurnyeat 1980c, Frede 2008 and Schwab 2016 on knowledge). Insofar as\ndoxa is an inherently deficient activity and attitude, and\ninsofar as knowledge is conceived in elevated ways, knowledge without\nbelief is a rather intuitive option within ancient epistemology. If\nunderstanding concepts and arguments involves knowledge that does not\nentail beliefs, the skeptics may be taken to have such knowledge.\nModern critics raise the further question of whether the skeptic must\nendorse logical laws (such as the Principle of Non-Contradiction) and\nrules of inference. In particular, they ask whether a skeptic is\ncommitted to the logical validity of the conditionals they formulate\nwhen arguing against the dogmatists (Sorensen 2004). Sextus records no\nancient version of this complaint, and accordingly no direct\nresponse. Relatedly, one may ask whether Sextus\u2019 method, in\nparticular regarding the Five Modes, is systematic in a way that is in\ntension with suspension of judgment (cf. Sienkiewicz 2021, who defends\nSextus against this charge).\n\n(iii) Belief. Bury, in his Loeb translation, translates\nadoxast\u00f4s as \u201cundogmatically,\u201d for example,\nwhen Sextus speaks (PH 1.15) of skeptics as saying that\n\u201cnothing is true.\u201d This translation suggests that Sextus\nbans dogmatism from the skeptic\u2019s life, where this still leaves\nroom for other, non-dogmatic beliefs. But adoxast\u00f4s\nmeans non-doxastically or \u2018without belief\u2019 (cf. Burnyeat\n1980 [1997]). As noted above, the skeptic\u2019s end is tranquility\nin matters relating to belief\u2014kata doxan. A skeptic\nlives adoxast\u00f4s. And even more confusingly, the\nskeptics assent adoxast\u00f4s, when they act.\n\nContemporary interest in Pyrrhonian skepticism was much spurred by\nMichael Frede\u2019s paper \u201cThe Sceptic\u2019s Beliefs\u201d\n(1979 [1997]). Frede argues that ancient skepticism was traditionally\ndismissed too easily as vulnerable to the Apraxia Charge, the charge\nthat, without belief, the skeptic cannot act. The skeptics seem to be\nconfident that they have replies to this objection. Thus, it seems\nuncharitable not to look closely at these replies. Further, insofar as\nthese replies respond to the charge that without belief one cannot\nact, we should focus on what the skeptics say about the role of belief\nin their lives. Frede cites PH 1.13, and claims that in this\npassage we find a distinction between two kinds of belief:\n\nWhen we say that the skeptic does not dogmatize, we are not using\n\u2018dogma\u2019 in the more general sense in which some say it is\ndogma to accept anything (for the skeptic does assent to the\nexperiences forced upon him in virtue of this-or-that impression: for\nexample, he would not say, when warmed or cooled, \u2018I seem not to\nbe warmed or cooled\u2019). Rather, when we say he does not\ndogmatize, we mean \u2018dogma\u2019 in the sense in which some say\nthat dogma is assent to any of the non-evident matters investigated by\nthe sciences. For the Pyrrhonist assents to nothing that is\nnon-evident. (PH 1.13; trans. Burnyeat (1984) [1997] with\nchanges)\n\n\nFollowing Frede, several scholars focus on PH 1.13 when\ndiscussing skeptical belief (with the notable exceptions of Barnes\n1980 [1997] and Barney 1992). They take it to be obvious that, in this\nparagraph, Sextus distinguishes between two kinds of belief, one which\nhe bans from the skeptic\u2019s life, and one which he allows into\nthe skeptic\u2019s life. Barnes (1982 [1997]) employs a distinction\nbetween rustic and urbane skepticism. The rustic skeptic suspends on\nall matters. The urbane skeptic suspends on scientific matters, but\nholds ordinary beliefs. The clause \u201cnon-evident matters\ninvestigated in the sciences\u201d in PH 1.13 might be taken\nas a point of reference for the urbane interpretation. However, Barnes\npoints out that this cannot be right. Everything can be considered as\na non-evident matter, even such things as whether honey is sweet.\n\nAgainst Barnes, Frede argues that the relevant distinction must be\ndrawn between two kinds of assent, such that \u201chaving a view\ninvolves one kind of assent, whereas taking a position, or making a\nclaim, involves another kind of assent, namely the kind of assent the\nsceptic will withhold\u201d (1984 [1997], 128). Sextus characterizes\nskeptical assent in three ways. He speaks of forced assent (PH\n1.23\u201324), involuntary assent (PH 1.19), and\nadoxast\u00f4s assent (PH 2.102). Frede does not explore the\ndetails of how Sextus uses these notions. The core of his proposal is\nthat Sextus allows for a kind of assent that does not involve a claim\nas to how things are in actual fact.\n\nIn (1979 [1997]), Frede is predominantly concerned with the\nskeptic\u2019s reply to the Apraxia Charge. In (1984 [1997]) his\nfocus is on skeptical pronouncements such as \u201cnothing can be\nknown.\u201d His distinction between two kinds of assent, and\naccordingly two kinds of belief, is explored with respect to such\nsentences. Frede writes that \u201c[t]o be left with the impression\nor thought that p [\u2026] does not involve the further thought that\nit is true that p\u201d (133). This is the sense in which, on his\ninterpretation, the skeptic might think \u201cnothing is\nknown.\u201d The thought counts as a belief, but not as a claim that,\nin actual fact, nothing is known by anybody. Contrary to Frede\u2019s\ninterpretation, one might argue that to believe simply is to hold\ntrue, at least according to the notions of belief that the skeptics\ninvoke in discussions with their contemporary critics (Vogt 2012b). It\nis thus not clear that Frede\u2019s distinction is genuinely one\nbetween two kinds of beliefs (Burnyeat 1980 [1997]). Perhaps it is a\ndistinction between two different propositional attitudes, only one of\nwhich is belief. As Striker (2001) points out, there is a danger that\ndebates over this issue become merely terminological. We might thus\ndraw a distinction between two issues. It is one thing to disagree\nwith Frede on what should or should not be called belief, and another\nto dispute whether he identifies and characterizes a phenomenon in the\nskeptic\u2019s mental life. As Frede argues, skeptics find themselves\nwith a rather persistent thought, without having accepted it as true\nin actual fact. This appears to capture a core element of skepticism:\nthe way in which the skeptic thinks such thoughts as \u201ceverything\nis inapprehensible.\u201d\n\n(iv) The Skeptical Formulae. PH 1.13, the passage in which\nscholars find a distinction between two kinds of belief, occurs in a\nchapter entitled \u201cDoes the Skeptic dogmatize?\u201d One angle\nfrom which we might disagree with Frede is to insist that PH\n1.13 addresses the status of the core thoughts of skeptical\nphilosophy, rather than the question of skeptical belief. Consider the\nrest of the chapter:\n\nNot even in uttering the skeptical formulae about unclear\nmatters\u2014for example, \u201cIn no way more,\u201d or \u201cI\ndetermine nothing,\u201d or one of the other formulae which we shall\nlater discuss\u2014do they dogmatize (dogmatizein). For if\nyou dogmatize, then you posit as real the things that you are said to\ndogmatize about; but skeptics posit these formulae not as necessarily\nbeing real. For they suppose that, just as the formula\n\u201cEverything is false\u201d says that it too, along with\neverything else, is false (and similarly for \u201cNothing is\ntrue\u201d), so also \u201cIn no way more\u201d says that it too,\nalong with everything else, is no more so than not so, and hence\ncancels itself along with everything else. And we say the same of the\nother skeptical formulae. Thus, if people who dogmatize posit as real\nthe things they dogmatize about, while skeptics utter their own\nphrases in such a way that they are implicitly cancelled by\nthemselves, then they cannot be said to dogmatize in uttering them.\nBut the main point is this: in uttering these formulae they say what\nappears to themselves and report their own feelings without any belief\n(adoxast\u00f4s), affirming nothing about external objects.\n(PH 1.14\u201315; trans. Annas-Barnes with changes)\n\n\nWhen explaining in PH 1.13 how the skeptic does not\ndogmatize, Sextus may have a particular issue in mind: that some\nskeptical formulae look like doctrines, and have traditionally been\nturned against themselves due to their dogmatic surface-structure. For\nexample, \u201call things are indeterminate\u201d looks like a\nstraightforward dogmatic statement. There is a long history of\nskeptical attempts to explain the nature of such pronouncements so\nthat they no longer undermine themselves. Sextus arguably mentions\nseveral solutions to this problem (PH 1.13\u201315 and\n1.187\u2013209; cf. Pellegrin 2010). In PH 1.15, Sextus\nidentifies the following as his main point: the skeptic merely reports\nwhat appears to them. Along these lines, Sextus calls indeterminacy an\naffection of thought (pathos dianoias; PH 1.198), a\nstate that the utterance \u201call things are indeterminate\u201d\naims to capture. The other solution mentioned in PH\n1.14\u201315 is somewhat more problematic: the skeptical formulae\ncancel themselves out. That is, one can say them and convey something\nthrough them. But then, once one has made a point, they as it were\nturn back upon themselves and eat themselves up\u2014as fire first\nburns combustible materials and then destroys itself. This idea became\nfamous through another comparison Sextus uses (invoked by Wittgenstein\n1922, 6.54): the skeptical pronouncements are like a ladder that\none climbs up; once one is on top, one can throw the ladder away\n(M 8.481). Scholars disagree on whether Sextus in some sense\nadmits that these statements are self-refuting (McPherran 1987), or\nwhether he defuses their self-refutational structure (Castagnoli 2010,\nIII.14).\n\n(v) Appearances (phainomena). While it is difficult to\nestablish a clear distinction between two kinds of belief in Sextus,\nthere is a comparatively more explicit distinction between two ways of\nengaging with appearances. Sextus says that, while things\nappear X to the skeptic, the skeptic does not affirm that\nthey are X. Questions that are traditionally discussed in\nterms of whether the skeptic has beliefs thus might be addressed in\nterms of whether the way things appear to the skeptic has a\njudgment-component. Arguably, \u201cA appears X to\nme now\u201d can be construed in different ways. Certain examples\n(say, the way in which it makes sense to say both that the moon\nappears small and that it appears large) may suggest that appearance\ncan but need not involve something like a judgment (Barney 1992). Some\nformulations in Sextus seem to insist on a significant difference\nbetween the mental activity of something appearing to a cognizer on\nthe one hand, and on the other hand the mental activity that, on the\nlevel of language, is represented by assertion. This suggests that,\nfor Sextus, A appearing F to me now does not entail\nthat I hold it to be true that A is F (Vogt\n2012b).\n\n(vi) Language. Another approach to the question of whether the skeptic\nhas beliefs looks at skeptical language. Sextus insists that the\nskeptic does not accept or reject any impression, and associates the\nabsence of these mental acts with the fact that the skeptic does not\naffirm or deny anything (e.g., PH 1.4, 7, 10). Arguably, we\ncan infer from Sextus\u2019 account of the skeptic\u2019s utterances\nwhat Sextus wants to say about the skeptic\u2019s mental states and\nacts. That is, the question of language immediately bears on the\nquestion of belief. The report on Pyrrhonian skepticism in Diogenes\nLaertius is particularly instructive in this respect. Contrary to\nscholarly focus on belief in reconstructing skepticism, it barely\nmentions belief. Discussion of the skeptics\u2019 attitudes is almost\nentirely conducted in terms of skeptical language and the skeptical\nformulae (for detailed discussion of the relevant paragraphs, DL\n9.74\u20137, cf. Corti 2015). If Sextus is read in light of the\nreport in DL IX, PH 1.13 may appear to be more of an isolated\npassage than scholarly debates imply. Sextus too devotes much space to\naccounts of skeptical expressions and language. It may thus be asked\nwhether scholars should reframe discussions, and pay more attention to\nskeptical language then they previously have. As of now, there is one\nmonograph on skeptical language, Corti (2009), and one approach to\nbelief that focuses on language, Vogt (1998). Both scholars pursue\nfurther ideas put forward by Barnes (1982 [1997]), who compares the\nskeptic\u2019s utterances to avowals. The skeptic lays open their\nstate of mind, they announce or record (apangellein) it (Fine\n2003a). In order to do this, the skeptic must misuse language\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]). Some strategies to avoid assertion are given\nin the context of the skeptical formulae (\u201cnon-assertion,\u201d\n\u201cI determine nothing,\u201d and so on). (i) Skeptical\nexpressions can be used as signs, which reveal a state of mind\n(PH 1.187). (ii) Expressions like \u201cou\nmallon\u201d (no more) and \u201couden mallon\u201d\n(nowise more) can be used indifferently (in the sense of\ninterchangeably) (PH 1.188). (iii) As is the practice in\nordinary language, the skeptic can use expressions elliptically; for\nexample \u201cno more\u201d for \u201cno more this-than-that\u201d\n(PH 1.188). (iv) People often use questions instead of\nassertions and the other way around. Similarly, \u201cno more\u201d\ncan be construed as a question: \u201cWhy more this-than-that?\u201d\n(v) The skeptic misuses language and uses it in a loose way\n(PH 1.191).\n\nIn M 1 and M 2, Sextus says that the skeptic goes\nalong with ordinary ways of using language (M 1.172, 193, 206, 218,\n229, 233; M 2.52\u20133, 58\u20139). This seems to be a key resource\nin construing skeptical ways of speaking: the skeptic exploits the\nways in which ordinary speakers can diverge from grammatically correct\nspeech, and still be understood. Apart from using their skeptical\nformulae, and apart from conducting philosophical investigations,\nwhich they can do in a dialectical mode, referring to theses,\narguments, and inferences, the skeptic also has to talk in everyday\ncontexts. It is here where we see best how skeptical utterances are\ntailored to reveal a state of mind in which nothing is accepted or\nrejected. Sextus takes great pains to construe his examples of\nskeptical utterances according to the following schema:\n\u201cX appears F to me now.\u201d This will\ngenerally be understood as an elliptical version of \u201cX\nappears to be F to me now.\u201d However, Sextus\nconsistently avoids \u201cto be\u201d (Vogt 1998; for the view that\n\u201cX appears F\u201d avoids reference to external\nobjects, see Everson 1991). The peculiar form of skeptical utterances\nsuggests that Sextus sees a relevant difference between\n\u201cX appears to be F to me now\u201d and\n\u201cX appears F to me now.\u201d The former\nmight imply reference to a state of affairs, and an epistemic usage of\n\u201cto appear\u201d that could be rendered as \u201cIt appears to\nme, that p,\u201d or, \u201cI take it that p.\u201d This, however,\nwould be assertoric: the skeptic would state that it appears to them\nthat such-and-such is the case. But the skeptic\u2019s elliptical\nutterances about what appears to them aim to be purely\nphenomenological. They aim to report a condition of the\nskeptic\u2019s mind, without expressing a judgment of any kind\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]; Annas-Barnes 1985, 23\u20134; for an\nassessment of these strategies in terms of modern philosophy of\nlanguage, cf. Pagin 2020). As part of the skeptics\u2019 way of life,\nlanguage can also be seen as an activity. That is, how the skeptics\ncan speak can be considered a sub\u2013question of how the skeptics\ncan act. Skeptical utterances have been compared to Wittgensteinian\nconfessions, arguably a kind of speech act that is consistent with the\nskeptics\u2019 avoidance of belief (Corti 2009, Parts I and II).\nMoreover, the skeptics not only speak. They presumably also understand\nwhat others say. A persuasive account of skeptical language must\nexplain both speaking and understanding (Corti 2009, Part III).\n\n(vii) Action. Sextus says that appearances (phainomena) are\nthe practical criterion of the skeptic (PH 1.23\u201324). By\nadhering to appearances, the skeptic is prevented from inactivity\n(anenerg\u00easia). Note that Sextus does not describe the\nskeptic as performing actions in the sense of dogmatic theory of\naction, which involves belief and choice (cf. M\n11.162\u2013166). Contrary to the Academic skeptic, a Sextan skeptic\ndoes not view themselves as a rational agent, who chooses one course\nof action over another. Sextus claims an active life for the skeptic,\nbut not the life of a rational agent, as conceived by dogmatic\nphilosophers (Vogt 2010; Schwab 2020). This attitude has been\ncritically discussed for a long time, for example, with respect to its\nethical (Bett 2019) and political upshots (Marchand 2015) and with\nrespect to the skeptics\u2019 relation to the law (Marchand\n2021).\n\nThe skeptic\u2019s forced assent is situated in the domain of action\n(PH 1.13, 19, 29\u201330, 193, 237\u20138). Thirst, for\nexample, necessitates assent, and that means, it moves the skeptic to\ndrink. This kind of assent may be genuinely unrelated to\nbelief-formation of any kind. Rather, forced assent generates the\nmovement of action. But what about more complex kinds of activities,\nsuch as applying a medication, or attending a festival? Sextus argues\nthat the skeptic adheres to custom, convention, and tradition, and to\nwhat they have been trained to do. In explaining how adherence to\nappearances in these domains generates activity, Sextus does not\nmention assent. However, he might have to concede that, like drinking\nwhen thirsty, more complex actions also involve some kind of assent.\nIn PH 2.102, Sextus says that the sceptic assents\nnon-doxastically (adoxast\u00f4s) to the things relied on in\nordinary life. In PH 1.19, he mentions involuntary assent.\nAccordingly, non-doxastic and involuntary assent may figure in those\ndomains of skeptical action that do not involve necessitation by\nbodily affections. Non-doxastic assent is, from the point of view of\nthe Stoics, a contradiction in terms, just like forced and involuntary\nassent. Assent is defined as in our power, and as that by which\nbeliefs are formed. If Sextus intends skeptical assent to be genuinely\nnon-doxastic and involuntary, then it does not have the core features\nof assent as defined by the dogmatists.\n\n(viii) Logic, Physics, Ethics, and the \u201cdisciplines.\u201d The\nspecial arguments of the skeptic are directed against particular\ntheories in the three disciplines of Hellenistic philosophy: logic,\nphysics, and ethics. In addition, they address the so-called\ndisciplines, namely grammar, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,\nastrology, and music-theory. Sextus\u2019 treatments of logic divide\nup into two main topics: sign and criterion (cf. Bett 2005 on signs).\nThis structure reflects central concerns of Hellenistic epistemology\nas well as of ancient skepticism. Skepticism looks for a\n\u2018decider\u2019 between conflicting appearances and thoughts. A\ndecider could be something evident. Dogmatic philosophers associate\nthe evident with the criterion of truth. For something to serve the\nrole of criterion, it cannot be equally disputed as the matters it\nhelps to decide. Or something non-evident could take on the role of\ndecider. For that to be the case, the skeptics argue, it would have to\nbe conclusively revealed by a sign or proof. If there is no compelling\ntheory of the criterion and no compelling account of sign and proof,\nthen there is nothing that can decide between several conflicting\nviews. Sextus\u2019 treatises on logic thus are not simply a\ncollection of individual arguments against various dogmatic theories.\nTheir main line of thought sketches a route into\nskepticism. Along these lines, Vlasits (2020b) argues that\nSextus\u2019 treatment of logic in PH 2 is unified. Sextus\u2019\nargument is structured such as to lead to suspension of judgment on\nthe methodologies of the dogmatists. The final section of M 8 (463\u201381)\nformulates a challenge for the skeptic that scholars interested in\nself-refutational arguments have examined (Castagnoli 2010): does the\nskeptic aim to prove that proof does not exist (Sienkiewicz\n2022)?\n\nSextus\u2019 discussions of ethics also focus on issues that\nplausibly lead into skepticism. Again, there are two central\nquestions: whether there is anything good and bad by nature; and\nwhether there is an art of life (Bett 2010, 2011 and 2019),\nas the Epicureans and Stoics claim there is. If we could settle what\nis good and what is bad, some of the most disturbing anomalies would\nbe resolved. If there were an art of life, there would be a teachable\nbody of knowledge about the good and the bad. In both cases, questions\nthat can cause a great deal of puzzlement would be resolved.\nSextus\u2019 discussions of ethics are in part famous because Sextus\nascribes outlandish and shocking views to the Stoics. As Sextus\nconstrues his arguments, the contrast between \u2018ordinary\nlife\u2019 and philosophical views leads to suspension of judgment\n(Vogt 2008a, ch. 1). In the modern tradition, a number of philosophers\nincluding Hegel and Nietzsche have engaged with aspects of\nSextus\u2019 outlook and in particular with the skeptical adherence\nto ordinary life (Berry 2010 and 2020; Bett 2020a). Recently,\nscholars have asked how ethical a skeptic can be, to use a phrased\nemployed by Bett (2019), given that it may seem that suspension of\njudgment on grave ethical challenges can seem facile. At the same\ntime, scholars point out that some dimensions of ethical frameworks\nwent unquestioned a long time, for example, with respect to gender;\nhere suspension of judgment may appear innovative (Olfert\nforthcoming).\n\nThe books on physics discuss god, cause, matter, bodies, mixture,\nmotion, increase and decrease, subtraction and addition, whole and\npart, change, becoming and perishing, rest, place, time, and number.\nNotably, god is one of the topics explored in physics. This stands in\nstark contrast to medieval and early modern discussions, where the\nquest for knowledge of God often frames and motivates engagement with\nskepticism. In PH 3, Sextus prefaces his discussion of arguments\nfor and against the existence of gods by saying that the\nskeptics\u2019 ordinary life without opinions\n(adoxast\u00f4s) includes the following: the skeptics say\nthat there are gods, are pious toward the gods, and say that the gods\nare provident. Scholars discuss how this relates to Sextus\u2019\ndiscussions of theology qua topic in physics on the one hand (PH\n3.2\u201312, M 9.11\u2013194), and to his portrayal of the skeptics\u2019\nordinary life in PH 1 on the other hand (Annas 2011, Veres 2020a). The\nskeptics come to suspend judgment on all central questions in ancient\nphysics (Bett 2012). This means, they come to suspend judgment on\nwhether, for example, there are causes, time, place, and bodies (cf.\nBobzien 2015 and Warren 2015). Their suspension does not merely mean\nthat they have not yet found a satisfying theory of, say, body. It\nmeans that they find themselves unable to say whether there is body\n(Burnyeat 1997). (On the cumulative force of these arguments, see\nsection 5.4.)\n\nThe six books entitled Against those in the Disciplines\n(M 1\u20136) have traditionally received less attention.\nOnly in the last few years have scholars begun to explore them with\nthe kind of philosophical subtlety that has been brought to bear in\nthe study of ancient skepticism in recent decades. M\n1\u20136 skeptically examine six fields of study, namely grammar,\nrhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music-theory. Sextus\nbegins with an astonishing move. Contrary to his usual strategy of\nemphasizing the distance between skeptics and dogmatists, he admits\nthat Pyrrhonians and Epicureans share much in viewing standard\ndisciplines as useless (M 1.1\u20137; cf. Thorsrud 2019).\nGenerally speaking, increased attention to M 1\u20136 may\nprovide additional occasion to modify the long-standing assumption\nthat the Stoics are Sextus\u2019 most important dogmatic\ninterlocutors. Throughout M 1\u20136, resonances between\nEpicurean and Pyrrhonian philosophy are remarkably visible (Bett 2018,\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d). Engagement with Epicurean philosophy\nshapes Sextus\u2019 approach deeply, to the extent that both schools,\nStoics and Epicureans, should be considered fundamental points of\nreference.\n\nAfter his remarks on how Pyrrhonians and Epicureans take issue with\nthe presumed usefulness of the disciplines, Sextus lays out general\narguments, suitable for skeptical examination of any field. He argues\nthat, for there to be a discipline, there must be the matter being\ntaught, the teacher, the learner, and the means of learning. If,\nhowever, neither of these things exists, then the discipline\ndoesn\u2019t exist. This is how Sextus proceeds. He argues, or seems\nto argue, for the non-existence of the disciplines (M 1.9).\nAlready in the very first sentence of M 1, Sextus describes\nhis own approach as one of putting forward counterarguments, a\nstrategy that he mentions repeatedly throughout M\n1\u20136.\n\nThese moves give rise to the most contentious question regarding\nM 1\u20136. Are these books negatively dogmatic? Or do they\nfit in with Sextus\u2019s outlook in PH 1\u20133, where\nskeptical arguments are described as leading up to suspension of\njudgment? Bett (2018, \u201cIntroduction\u201d) argues that, with\nsome qualifications, Sextus\u2019 approach is to be explained as\nfollows. Sextus lays out counterarguments based on the assumption that\nthe arguments of the dogmatists have already been formulated. For\nthere to be arguments of equal weight on both sides, only the\nanti-dogmatic arguments need to be adduced. The intended effect is\nthat jointly, these opposing sets of arguments lead us to suspend\njudgment. In addition, Bett notes that the remarkable emphasis on\ncounterarguments, non-existence, and uselessness suggests that some of\nthe material in M 1\u20136 goes back to an earlier phase of\nPyrrhonism.\n\nIn four of the six fields, namely grammar, rhetoric, music, and\nastrology, Sextus admits non-technical versions into the\nskeptic\u2019s life, while subjecting all theoretical claims to\nskeptical examination. For example, he distinguishes between the\nordinary ability to read and write on the one hand and grammar as a\ntechnical discipline on the other, or the ability to play a musical\ninstrument on the one hand and music theory on the other (cf. Corti\n2015b on why this kind of contrast does not come up in the books on\narithmetic and geometry, Corti 2015c on Sextus\u2019 attack on\nthe Platonic-Pythagorean notion of the Two, and Corti\nforthcoming).\n\nIt is remarkable that, qua theoretical field, Sextus examines\nastrology rather than astronomy. The latter would make for a more\ntypical sequence: apart from the fact that in Sextus, logic is\nconsidered part of philosophy rather than a \u201cdiscipline,\u201d\nthe six fields otherwise correspond to the so-called trivium of\ngrammar, logic, and rhetoric and quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy, and music theory. Sextus\u2019 attention to astrology\nrather than astronomy highlights a deep feature of his philosophy\n(Corti 2015, Bett 2018). Astronomy, from Sextus\u2019 point of view,\nis concerned with appearances; and hence there is a sense in which the\nskeptic does not object to it. Astronomy, then, is the\n\u201cversion\u201d of astrology that skeptics can admit into their\nadherence to ordinary life (M 5.1\u20133). Presumably,\nastronomy is concerned with predicting things like droughts, floods,\nearthquakes, and plagues based on appearances. Astrology, on the other\nhand, is concerned with matters of great obscurity.\n5. Ancient and Modern Skepticism: Transitions\n5.1 Augustine: Re-Conceiving Skepticism in a Theological Framework\n\nHistorians of philosophy sometimes argue that Henri Etienne\u2019s\nrediscovery of Sextus in 1562 initiated an era of epistemology. Early\nmodern engagement with skepticism is here seen as a turn to arguments\nfound in Sextus (Annas-Barnes 1985, 5\u20137; Bailey 2002,\n1\u201320). Via Cicero, early modern and modern philosophers seem to\nhave engaged also with Academic arguments (for a recent analysis of\nAcademic skepticism in Hume and Kant, cf. Gonz\u00e1lez Quintero\n2022). In particular the beginning of Descartes\u2019\nMeditations may display a kind of Socratic spirit: a\ncommitment to calling into question all one\u2019s beliefs. However,\nearly modern philosophers work within a theologically framed tradition\nthat importantly begins with St. Augustine (354\u2013430) (cf. Menn\n1998 and Lagerlund 2009; on the history of medieval skepticism cf.\nLagerlund ed. 2009; cf. Carriero 2009 on Descartes\u2019 engagement\nwith Aquinas; for an analysis of the transformation of skepticism that\nturns immediately to Descartes, cf. Williams 2010).\n\nA major part of Augustine\u2019s early education consisted in the\nstudy of Cicero\u2019s writings. He was thus closely acquainted with\nAcademic skepticism (Cicero was one kind of Academic skeptic).\nAugustine sees the force of ancient skeptical strategies. Even though\nhe does not become a skeptic, he integrates distinctively skeptical\nmoves into his thought. This has a long-standing effect on the history\nof theology and science. For example, Galileo Galilei is able to cite\nAugustine when he defends himself against the charge that his physics\nis in opposition to the Bible (Letter to the Grand Duchess,\nin Drake 1957). Augustine supplies arguments to the effect that we\nshould keep an open mind. Both our physical theories and our\ninterpretations of the Bible are likely to evolve. This idea figures\nimportantly in Pyrrhonism. Past experience tells us that, on every\ngiven issue, someone eventually came up with a new argument.\nAccordingly, even if the skeptics cannot find an objection to a given\nclaim right now, they expect that in the future, a conflicting view\nwill be formulated.\n\nHowever, such traces of skepticism are integrated into an ultimately\nnon-skeptical philosophy. In Contra Academicos, Augustine\nrecognizes a core feature of ancient skepticism, namely that it is a\ncommitment to ongoing inquiry (cf. Nawar 2019 on Augustine\u2019s\ndefense of knowledge against the skeptics in Contra\nAcademicos 3). The question that Augustine considers vital, then,\nis whether a life devoted to inquiry can be compelling, if seemingly\nthere is no prospect for ever attaining truth (cf. Lagerlund 2009). It\nis as a philosophy of inquiry that skepticism makes a lasting\ncontribution to ethics, continuing, as it were, a Socratic legacy\n(Vogt 2017).\n\nAugustine creates the framework that will become characteristic of\nearly modern discussions. First, in his work skeptical arguments are\nexplored in order to be refuted. Second, the key issue is whether we\nhave knowledge, not whether we should hold anything to be true. In\nAugustine, the background for caring so much about knowledge is the\npressing question of whether we can know God: whether we can know that\nhe exists and what his properties are. This might also be the reason\nwhy knowledge of testimony gains importance (De Trinitate,\n15.12; in Schoedinger 1996). The Bible, or parts of it, might be\nconsidered testimony about God, and accordingly as one possible way of\nattaining knowledge of God.\n\nThird, in the process of asking whether we can have knowledge of God\nit makes sense to distinguish between kinds of knowledge (sensory,\nrational, by testimony, etc.). If we know God, then we do so via one\nof the kinds of knowledge. This becomes a standard feature of\ndiscussions of skepticism. Philosophers go through the different kinds\nof knowledge that are conceivable, and examine them in turn. In\nAugustine as well as later authors, this includes mathematical\nknowledge (Nawar 2022). Though Sextus wrote on geometry and\narithmetic, questions about knowledge in mathematics do not shape\nHellenistic debates between skeptics on the one hand and Epicureans\nand Stoics on the other hand. Fourth, Augustine conceives of what he\ncalls \u2018inner knowledge.\u2019 He envisages a skeptical\nscenario. Suppose we have no sensory knowledge, no rational knowledge,\nand no knowledge of testimony. We still know that we think, love,\njudge, live, and are (De Trinitate 15.12). In the City of\nGod 11.26, Augustine uses his well-known phrase \u201csi\nenim fallor, sum\u201d (even if I err, I am). That is, Augustine\nsuggests that we have knowledge of our mental acts (cf. Nawar 2022 on\nAugustine\u2019s concern with self-knowledge). However, Augustine\ndoes not consider these pieces of knowledge foundational. While he\npoints to them when he discusses the challenges of Academic\nskepticism, he does not systematically build upon them in refuting\nskepticism about sense perception, rational knowledge, and knowledge\nof testimony. Rather, he refutes skepticism by stating that God\ncreated us and the things that are known to us; God wanted these\nthings to be known to us (De Trinitate 15.12). In later\nepistemology, the idea of the turn into one\u2019s mind and an\nintrospective access to one\u2019s mental acts becomes a secular\nidea. Augustine is a transitional figure in the philosophy of mind,\nand thereby re-conceives skepticism. By focussing on a gap between\n\u2018what is in the mind\u2019 and the world outside, he as it were\ninvites external world skepticism (Vogt 2014a). But Augustine is\nconcerned with the path to God: the mind turns into itself and\nfrom there it moves further, toward God (e.g., Confessions 7.\n17,23).\n\nNext to Augustine, Al-Ghazali (1085-1111) plays a major role in\nre-conceiving the questions relevant to skepticism (Menn 2003,\nKukkonen 2009). In The Rescuer From Error, Al-Ghazali\nliterally describes God as the rescuer from error (in Khalidi 2005).\nLike Augustine before and Descartes after him, Al-Ghazali moves\nthrough different cognitive faculties. Do the senses or reason allow\nus to gain knowledge? These questions are framed by the quest for\nknowledge of God. While Augustine thinks that knowledge of God comes\nthrough a combination of seeking God on the one hand and God\u2019s\ngrace on the other, Al-Ghazali thinks it comes through spiritual\nexercises. However, once confidence in God is secured, trust in the\nmore familiar ways of gaining knowledge\u2014sense perception,\nrational reasoning, and so on\u2014is restored (for a detailed\ntreatment of skepticism in Classical Islam, cf. Heck 2014).\n\nOne key difference between ancient skepticism on the one hand, and\nmedieval as well as Cartesian skepticism on the other, is that ancient\nskepticism is not framed by theological concerns. Note that in\nCartesian skepticism, God is not only invoked when it comes to\nrefuting skepticism. More importantly, the skeptical problems arise in\na way that depends on God as creator. Our cognitive faculties are seen\nas created faculties, and the world as a created world. A kind of\n\u2018faculty-skepticism\u2019 that asks whether our cognitive\nfaculties are built so as to be erroneous is formulated, and a\npotential gap between our minds and the world opens up. Perhaps God\nmade us in such a way that we are fundamentally wrong about everything\n(or, as later secular versions have it, a mad scientist experiments on\na \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d).\n\nThese are important steps away from the non-theological ancient\nconstrual of skepticism. The theological premises of early modern\nskepticism are not only foreign to ancient debates; they would be seen\nas misguided. From the Hellenistic point of view, theology is part of\nphysics. An account of god is part of an account of the natural world\n(as such, it is unrecognizable as \u2018theology\u2019 from the\npoint of view of later theologies). Human beings and their cognitive\nfaculties are natural parts of a natural world. They are organic and\nfunctional parts, interconnected with the other parts of the large\nwhole which the universe is. A mind-world-gap (of the kind envisaged\nin the Cartesian tradition) is inconceivable. Each \u2018mind,\u2019\nand that is, rational soul, is an integrated physical part of the\nphysical world. Like a part of a complex organism, it would not exist\nwere it not for the interrelations it has with the other parts. A\nphysiological account of the mind makes the stark divide between mind\nand world that figures in early modern skepticism unimaginable.\n5.2 Skepticism About Induction\n\nContemporary discussions inherit long-standing problems from early\nmodern philosophy. Among them, external world skepticism, skepticism\nabout other minds, and skepticism about induction are particularly\nprominent. In assessing ancient skepticism, we might ask whether the\nancients saw these problems.\n\nAmong the skeptical problems of modern philosophy, skepticism about\ninduction stands out. Its early formulation in Hume does not depend on\nthe idea that our faculties are created by God, who also created the\nworld. Hume takes himself to engage with Pyrrhonian skepticism\n(Ainslie 2003). Induction proceeds from particular observations to a\ngeneral conclusion. Skepticism about induction points out that, no\nmatter how many particulars were observed, the general claim\npronounces also on what has not been observed. In this respect, the\ninference seems unwarranted and so we should suspend judgement on its\neffectiveness. Induction can concern the ascription of properties to\nsome kind of entity as well as causal claims. In the latter, the\nskeptic observes that what regularly precedes a type of event may not\nbe its cause. Perhaps we cannot infer anything from the fact that\ncertain properties or events regularly occur together (Vlasits 2020a;\nfor a related argument in Al-Ghazali, cf. Kukkonen 2009).\n\nRelevant ideas can be traced in various aspects of Sextus\u2019\nphilosophy. First, Sextus sides with anti-rationalist tendencies in\nmedicine. According to these schools, a doctor remembers that, in\nearlier cases, symptom A was alleviated by medication\nB. They do not infer that medication B makes symptom\nA disappear, or that the illness C is the cause of\nsymptom A. Second, the Five Modes do not exclusively target\nproof. They address everything that lends credibility to something\nelse. They may thus also call into question signs that are taken as\nindicative of their causes. Sextus\u2019 skeptic does not accept such\nindicative signs. Third, Sextus discusses the role of so-called\ncommemorative signs in the skeptic\u2019s life (PH\n2.100\u2013102; Allen 2001). For example, a scar is a commemorative\nsign of a wound. Both were co-observed in the past. A skeptic will\nthink of a wound when seeing a scar. But they do not commit to causal\nor explanatory claims. Fourth, Sextus records a set of Causal Modes\n(PH 1.180\u201386), which are specifically targeted toward\ncausal explanations (Corti 2014; on the relation between the Causal\nModes and Hume cf. Garrett 2020). He does not ascribe the kind of\nrelevance to them that the Ten Modes and the Five Modes have. Indeed,\nhe thinks the Five Modes can do the work of Causal Modes (that is,\ncall into question causal and explanatory theses and theories).\nHowever, the Causal Modes go into great detail on how the skeptic\ninvestigates any kind of causal thesis or theory.\n5.3 Subjectivity and Other Minds\n\nThe distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is central to\nmodern discussions of skepticism. It is not envisaged in ancient\nthought. However, this does not mean that ancient philosophers do not\nreflect on questions relevant to this distinction. Arguably,\nPyrrhonism conceives of the affections of the mind in ways that\nanticipate later thought about subjectivity (Fine 2003a and 2003b).\nSextus describes the skeptic\u2019s states of\n\u2018being-appeared-to\u2019 as affections of the mind. A skeptic\ncan report these states in their utterances. Illustrating this point,\nSextus uses expressions associated with the Cyrenaics, a Socratic\nschool of thought. These expressions literally mean something like\n\u2018I am being heated\u2019 or \u2018I am being whitened.\u2019\nThey aim to record affections without claiming anything about the\nworld. Fine argues that the skeptic\u2019s beliefs are beliefs about\nthese affections (2000). With this proposal, Fine turns against two\nprominent positions in scholarly debate about skeptical belief (see\nsection 4.4), that skeptics have no beliefs whatsoever, and that they\nhave beliefs that fall short of holding true. Fine envisages\nreflective beliefs: beliefs about one\u2019s states of mind (on\nrelated issues in contemporary epistemology, cf. Feeney and\nSchellenberg 2020 and Gl\u00fcer 2020).\n\nWhether or not Sextus\u2019 account of the skeptic\u2019s mental\nlife includes reflective beliefs about one\u2019s mental states, we\nshould note an important difference to later proposals of that kind.\nLater philosophers focus on the particular kind of certainty attached\nto reflective knowledge. Reflective knowledge is sometimes seen as a\nstepping-stone towards greater confidence in our cognitive powers, and\nour ability to also attain other kinds of knowledge. But it may not be\nobvious that reflective knowledge can take on this important role. In\nthis respect, Augustine is still closer to ancient than to modern\nintuitions. He says that such pieces of knowledge as \u201cI know\nthat I think\u201d are not what we are looking for. Augustine\nenvisages that reflective knowledge-claims can be iterated, so that we\nwould have infinitely many pieces of knowledge (\u201cI know that I\nknow that I think\u2026\u201d). But from his point of view, this\nkind of knowledge leads nowhere. When we ask whether we can have\nknowledge, we are interested in knowledge of the world and of God\n(De Trinitate 15.12).\n\nModern philosophers also pay great attention to the privileged access\ncognizers have to their own cognitive activities. Augustine introduces\na distinction that paves the way for this idea. He argues that the\nmind cannot know what kind of stuff it is (De Trinitate 10.10\nand 15.12). The mind does not know its substance, but it knows its\nactivities. For Augustine, this means that the mind knows itself. The\nmind is precisely what it knows itself to be: in knowing that one\nthinks, judges, lives, and so on, one knows the mind (Vogt 2014a).\nNote that this argument indicates that knowing that one lives and is\nare not pieces of knowledge about one\u2019s bodily existence, but\nabout the activities of the mind.\n\nFinally, modern philosophers conceive of the special kind of access to\none\u2019s own mind not only in contrast with our access to the\nworld. They also compare it to our access to what goes on in other\nminds. One of their core problems is skepticism about other minds. If\nour own minds are accessible to us in the way nothing else is, then we\nmight not be able to ascribe mental states to others. For example, we\nmight not know that someone who looks as if she is in pain really is\nin pain. The ancient skeptics envisage nothing of this kind (Warren\n2011). This suggests that, insofar as they draw a distinction between\naffections of the mind and the world, this distinction is construed\ndifferently than in modern skepticism.\n5.4 External World Skepticism\n\nIn its early modern versions, external world skepticism involves the\nidea that there is a creator\u2014someone who made the world and our\nfaculties, and the fit or misfit between them. If this assumption is\ncrucial to external world skepticism, then the ancients do not\nconceive of this skeptical problem. From the point of view of modern\nphilosophy, ancient skepticism may appear limited by not addressing\nsome of the most radical skeptical scenarios (Burnyeat 1980 [1997] and\n1982; Williams 1988; Fine 2003a and 2003b). From the point of view of\nancient skepticism, early modern skepticism and the long life that its\nproblems enjoy, however, would seem to originate in a flawed\ntheology.\n\nContemporary philosophers sometimes discuss external world skepticism\nin terms of a paradox: one thinker finds herself torn between the\nstrength of skeptical arguments and her ordinary convictions. For\nexample, she thinks that this is her hand. But she concedes\nthat the skeptical hypothesis that a mad scientist might have set\nthings up so that she has such perceptions and thoughts (the so-called\nbrain in a vat scenario) is hard to refute. This way of framing\ndiscussions of skepticism is foreign to antiquity. In antiquity,\nskeptics and their opponents are different thinkers, each of them with\none set of intuitions, arguing against each other. It is also foreign\nto ancient skepticism insofar as it inherits the early modern idea\nthat some greatly powerful agent sets things up, and in a sense\ncreates the thinker\u2019s faculties and the world as it appears to\nthem.\n\nHowever, the ancient skeptics might conceive of their own kind of\nexternal world skepticism. One way to explore this question is to turn\nto the way in which Sextus describes that which is outside of the\nskeptic\u2019s mind (Fine 2003 and 2003(2)). Throughout his work,\nSextus employs the distinction between appearances and what really is\nthe case. Consider some of the detail of how he characterizes the\nlatter. One phrase in the Ten Modes is \u201cta ektos\nhupokeimena,\u201d the externally underlying things\n(PH 1.61, 127, 128, 134, 144). Other phrases, meant to\ndemarcate roughly the same contrast with appearances, are how things\nare in their nature (phusei) (PH 1.78, 123, 140),\n\u201cthe underlying things\u201d (hupokeimena)\n(PH 1.106), as well as a combination: \u201cthe nature of\nthe underlying external things\u201d (PH 1.117, 163). The\nexpressions which contain the word \u201cexternal\u201d might read\nas if Sextus was talking about the external world in a sense familiar\nto us from early modern skepticism.\n\nBut what are the underlying or external objects, as Sextus conceives\nof them? For example, Sextus speaks of the underlying reality of\nwhether honey really is sweet (PH 1.19). In such a case, it\nis assumed that there are ordinary objects. But we do not have access\nto the properties they really have (Fine calls this Property\nSkepticism, 2003b). However, external objects in Sextus\u2019 sense\nalso include objects that later philosophers would not obviously see\nas part of the external word. For example, an answer to the question\nof what kind of life really is good would count as a claim about\nexternal or underlying reality (cf. Pellegrin 2010).\n\nAnother approach to the question of whether Sextus envisages some kind\nof external world skepticism is to turn to his discussions of physics.\nOrdinarily we take ourselves to live in a world in which there are\nbodies, movement, place, time, and so on. But as Sextus argues, we do\nnot have compelling accounts of any of these core conceptions of\nphysics. This leads to suspension of judgment on whether there are\nbodies, movement, place, time, and so on. Sextus\u2019 discussions of\nphysics might add up to a rather far-reaching skepticism about the\nnatural world.\n",
