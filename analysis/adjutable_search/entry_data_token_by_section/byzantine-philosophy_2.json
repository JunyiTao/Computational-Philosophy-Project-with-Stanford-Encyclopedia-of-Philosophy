    "main_text": "Historical Survey || People, Works, Currents\n1.3 People, Works, Currents\n\n\nOur brief survey of the philosophical production in Byzantium starts\nin the 9th century with the work of the patriarch of Constantinople,\nPhotios (c. 810\u2013after 893), though there is\nevidence of elementary teaching of logic and ethics in the 7th and 8th\ncenturies, during the period of Iconoclasm. The most important\nphilosophical work from this period is the Dialectica, the\nfirst part of John of Damascus\u2019 (c.\n675\u2013749) widely influential Source of Knowledge, which\ndraws mainly on the late antique commentators on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and Aristotle\u2019s logical works. Unfortunately, the\nonly surviving works by Leo the Mathematician\n(c. 790\u2013after 869), who taught Aristotelian logic at the\nMagnaura School in Constantinople, established soon after the end of\nIconoclasm, are some notes in manuscripts containing Platonic\ndialogues.\n\n\nBut it is undoubtedly with Photios that we first encounter in\nByzantine times a large-scale revival of the study of antiquity and a\nprofound interest in the texts of ancient philosophers. Photios is\nfamous mainly for his Bibliotheke, a vast compilation of\nancient Greek literature, and a Lexicon, in which he collected\nnotable words and expressions. He also taught Aristotelian logic and\nwrote, for this purpose, a series of small essays on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, which are included in the Amphilochia,\nan unsystematic collection of texts on theological and philosophical\ntopics. In these and other essays, Photios engages in a critical\ndiscussion of some of the most central theses in ancient philosophy,\nsuch as Plato\u2019s conception of forms, whose capacity to function\nas predicates he rejects, and Aristotle\u2019s distinction between\nprimary and secondary substances, which he thinks entails that\n\u2018substance\u2019 is an ambiguous term.\n\n\nDuring this \u201cfirst Byzantine Renaissance\u201d, as the period\nhas sometimes been characterized, the archbishop of\nCaesarea, Arethas (c. 850\u2013932/44) also\ncommented on Aristotle\u2019s Categories and\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge (cf. section 1.2). He is better\nknown, however, for having been instrumental in the transmission of\nancient texts, in particular the Platonic corpus. He commissioned the\ntranscription of a complete copy of Plato\u2019s works to which he added\nmarginal notes; the first part of his Plato text is extant as the\nfamous Clarkianus 39 manuscript in the Bodleian Library of Oxford.\n\n\nIn the mid-11th to early 12th centuries, there is a significant\ndevelopment from the widely humanistic character of Photios\u2019 and\nArethas\u2019 interests towards a new understanding of the\nphilosophical enterprise. The philosopher is now regarded as someone\nwith a hard-earned knowledge in all branches of learning, who forms his\nown views on the philosophical topics discussed by the ancients, and\nmoreover as someone who is interested in applying the philosophical\ncategories to various problems in theology or in everyday affairs.\n\nMichael Psellos (1018\u20131078) was one of\nthe most erudite and intriguing figures of the Byzantine Middle Ages.\nHe was given the title \u201cConsul of the Philosophers\u201d and\ntaught all branches of philosophy. He commented on and paraphrased\ntreatises from the Aristotelian Organon (De\ninterpretatione, Prior Analytics), and wrote a large\nnumber of short treatises discussing particular philosophical issues\nraised, in part at least, by his pupils: e.g., on the distinction\nbetween homonyms and synonyms, on the characteristic of substance as\nself-existent (authuparktos), on the Platonic forms, on the\nunity of the soul and the body, on the problem of evil, on dreams. He\nalso compiled the De omnifaria\ndoctrina, a short encyclopedia in which various philosophical notions are explained in close dependence on Christian as well as pagan authors. His speeches are famous as examples of rhetorical style; there is also a collection of about five hundred of his letters. Although the amount of attention he paid to Aristotle\u2019s works was significant, there is no doubt that Psellos had a strong preference for Plato and the Neoplatonists. On this account he has often \u2014 and not unreasonably \u2014 been identified as a pivotal figure in the transmission of the Platonic heritage through the Middle Ages. His works show that he carefully read Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and especially Proclus, whom he considered as an authority among ancient authors. In particular, he found in the Elements of Theology an elaborate metaphysical system open to adaptation to Christian theology. For although the Christian Trinity differed significantly from the Neoplatonic first principle, Psellos found that Proclus\u2019 view of the general structure of reality, descending from the first cause to intellect, soul nature, body, and matter, could be adopted with some modifications. However, in his attempts to advance\nphilosophical learning, he was often attacked concerning his\ntheological orthodoxy, with the result that he often had to be careful\nto distance himself from heretical doctrines, e.g., in his writings on\nthe Chaldaean Oracles.\n\nJohn Italos (c. 1025\u2013after 1082) was a pupil\nof Michael Psellos, and his successor in the Imperial School as\n\u201cConsul of the Philosophers\u201d, where he also taught all\nbranches of philosophy. Anna Komnene refers to him in the\nAlexiad, the history she wrote of the events during the reign\nof her father Alexios I (1081\u20131118), as an exceptional thinker\nand an excellent logician who interpreted Aristotle better than anyone\nelse in his time. Indeed, Italos occupies a special place in the\nhistory of Byzantine thought for having been put on trial and condemned\nby the Church in 1082, on the charge of having advocated the systematic\nuse of philosophical analysis and logical reasoning in clarifying\ntheological issues. Regardless of the positions he defended on such\nissues, positions some of which, after all, were not at all different\nfrom those of other philosophers, notably from Psellos\u2019, what\nseems to have been really unacceptable for the religious and the\npolitical establishment at the time was his rationalist approach\ntowards doctrines which the Orthodox Church considered beyond\ncomprehension, as something Christians should simply accept on faith\nand as something only the Church had the authority to judge. It is\ntelling that to this day, during the mass of the first Sunday in Lent,\nthe so-called Synodikon of the Greek Orthodox Church is read,\nin which Italos is anathematized in eleven articles. What mainly\nsurvives from his writings are the commentary on the second, third and\nfourth book of the Topics; two small treatises on dialectic\nand on the Aristotelian syllogisms together with a very brief synopsis\nof rhetoric; and finally, the Quaestiones quodlibetales, a\ncollection of ninety-three answers to philosophical questions posed to\nhim by his students, among which were the emperor Michael VII (ruled\n1071\u20131078) and his brother Andronikos Doukas. In these texts\nItalos seems to question the supremacy of theology over philosophy and\neven to overturn the established hierarchy. That is to say, Italos\nobviously follows the ancient conception of philosophy, well known from\nboth the Platonic and the Aristotelian traditions, according to which\ntheology is part of philosophy, since philosophy culminates in the\nattempt to understand the first principle of everything. It probably\nwas this supposedly arrogant attempt on his part to develop a natural\nor philosophical theology that led to his trial and condemnation.\n\n\nAfter John Italos, Theodore of Smyrna (mid-11th\ncentury\u2013after 1112) was appointed \u201cConsul of the\nPhilosophers\u201d. His work Epitome of All Things Pertaining to\nNature and to Natural Principles according to the Ancients is\nstill unpublished. It was conceived as an introductory compendium in\nfour books (three of which survive) to the topics and terminology of\nAristotle\u2019s Physics. \n\n\nAccording to a widely accepted hypothesis, Eustratios of\nNicaea and Michael of Ephesus were two of\nthe contributors to a series of commentaries, initiated by the\nprincess and historian Anna Komnene, on previously neglected\nAristotelian works. Their commentaries, in which they followed ancient\nmodels, some of which are now lost, but also added their own\ninsightful remarks, were partly translated into Latin and played a\nrole in the development of Western Aristotelianism in the 13th\ncentury.\n\n\nEustratios was a pupil of John Italos and became the Metropolitan of\nNicaea at the beginning of the 12th century. Anna Komnene in the\nAlexiad presents him as an extremely erudite scholar both of\nreligious and of secular literature as well as a master of dialectic.\nHe was also asked by the emperor Alexios I to participate in various\ntheological debates with the Latin Church, until he himself, just like\nhis teacher Italos, was finally condemned for heresy in 1117. The\nreasons for his condemnation are a rather complicated matter involving\nboth theological and political issues. In this connection, however, it\nis interesting to note that he was famous for his strong conviction of\nthe propriety of using Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic in theology; he even\nstated that Christ himself had argued with the help of Aristotelian\nsyllogisms. What we have of his work as a commentator are his comments\non the first and sixth book of the Nicomachean Ethics and his\ncommentary on the second book of the Posterior Analytics. In\ninterpreting Aristotle, Eustratios clearly followed the late antique\nNeoplatonic philosophers, though at certain places, like the issue\nconcerning the knowledge of first principles, he advocated theses\nwhich seem closer in line with his Christian beliefs. For Eustratius,\ncontrary to Plato and Aristotle, did not claim that the human soul\nregains pieces of knowledge that we possessed at some former time, nor\nthat it has only potential knowledge which then becomes actual. He\nbelieved that the human soul, when created by God, is created perfect,\nthat is, it has full knowledge of the principles and self-evident\ncommon concepts, but human beings lose sight of this knowledge and\nunderstanding, because they are susceptible to the impulses generated\nby their body.\n\n\nAbout Michael of Ephesus\u2019 life next to nothing is known. On\nthe other hand, it is perfectly clear that his breadth as an\nAristotelian commentator is remarkable. Indeed, Michael has been\ncompared to Alexander of Aphrodisias in respect both of his mode of\nexposition and method of interpretation. He wrote commentaries not only\non the fifth, ninth, and tenth books of the Nicomachean\nEthics, but also on Metaphysics 6\u201314 and on the\nSophistical Refutations (both wrongly attributed to\nAlexander), on the Generation of Animals (wrongly attributed\nto Philoponus), on the Parva naturalia, on the Parts of\nAnimals, on the Movement of Animals, on the\nProgression of Animals; furthermore, he wrote comments on the\npseudo-Aristotelian treatise De coloribus, and on\nthe Politics, the latter of which have only partly\nsurvived.\n\nTheodore Prodromos (c. 1100\u2013c. 1170) continued\nthe tradition of writing extensive commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s works\nby authoring a still unedited commentary on the second book of\nAristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, heavily influenced by\nEustratios\u2019. A couple of his minor works are also worth\nmentioning. His Xenedemus is a short Plato-style elenctic\ndialogue on themes from Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge. He also wrote a small essay, On\n\u2018Great\u2019 and \u2018Small\u2019, which contains a\nseries of arguments against Aristotle\u2019s doctrine in the sixth\nchapter of the Categories that \u2018great\u2019 and\n\u2018small\u2019 are not quantities but relatives, and not\ncontraries.\n\n\nNevertheless, not all Byzantine philosophers at the time were in\nfavor of harmonizing ancient wisdom with the Christian doctrines. In\nfact, since Proclus seems to have represented the ancient philosopher\npar excellence, being so much admired by Psellos and his\npupils, he understandably became the target of Nicholas of\nMethone (early 12th century\u2013c. 1160/66), who wrote a\ndetailed refutation of the Elements of Theology.\nNicholas\u2019 aim clearly was to provide the pious readers with the\nnecessary arguments against the Neoplatonic influences on Christian\ndogmas, influences that on his view could lead the believers away from\nthe true faith. For instance, Nicholas systematically argues against\nthose of Proclus\u2019 propositions which try to establish that the\nunderlying principle of the universe is pure unity, because he\nconsiders them contrary to the Christian belief in the Holy\nTrinity.\n\n\nThe capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204 dealt a\nsevere blow to the Byzantine institutions of education and learning.\nMany teachers and scholars fled the city to find a haven in Nicaea,\nwhere the Laskarid dynasty had settled. Education and learning were\nmatters of great concern to the Laskarid emperors; one of them,\nTheodore II Doukas Laskaris (ruled 1254\u20131258),\nwas himself the author of two works on natural\nphilosophy, Kosmik\u0113 d\u0113l\u014dsis (Cosmic\nExposition) and Peri phusik\u0113s koin\u014dnias\n(On Physical Community), in which he brought simple\nmathematical schemes to bear on elemental theory and cosmology. In\n1261 Constantinople was recaptured by Michael VIII Palaiologos, and\nthe period of cultural prosperity that followed is sometimes referred\nto as the \u201cPalaiologan renaissance\u201d.\n\n\nThe most important philosophy teacher and scholar in the period\nleading up to this \u201crenaissance\u201d was\nundoubtedly Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197\u2013c. 1269). Through his students \u2013 who included Doukas\nLaskaris as well as the historian George Akropolites\n(1217\u20131282), later charged by Michael VIII with the\nheadmastership of the Imperial School in Constantinople \u2013 and\nthrough his widely read compendia on logic and natural philosophy (see\nsect. 1.2), Blemmydes exerted an influence that is clearly discernible\nin many later philosophical works although it has never been\nsystematically measured. In a prefatory note to his compendium on\nlogic, the first version of which was apparently composed in 1237 at\nthe behest of Emperor John III Batatzes, he somewhat unexpectedly\nemphasizes the utility of logic for theology.  Indeed,\nBlemmydes\u2019 services were employed on more than one occasion to\ndefend the Orthodox dogma of the procession of the Holy Ghost in\nofficial debates with papal legates. The relation to the Catholic\nChurch was the dominating political and religious issue for most of\nthe 13th century. A reunion was negotiated at the Second Council of\nLyons in 1274, but it lacked popular support, and after the death of\nMichael VIII in 1282, the new emperor and his patriarch pulled out of\nthe deal. Encounters with Dominican and Franciscan theologians may\nhave helped fuel the interest in logic in Byzantium during this time.\nThe Greek translations of Boethius\u2019 De hypotheticis\nsyllogismis and De topicis differentiis\nby Manuel Holobolos, who taught logic at the\nPatriarchal School between 1265 and 1273, must be seen against this\nbackground. Other Latin philosophical and theological works were\ntranslated by Maximos Planoudes\n(1260\u2013c. 1310). They do not seem to have had any discernible\nimpact until the mid-14th century, when Augustine\u2019s\n\u201ccogito\u201d appears as one of several arguments against\nScepticism in a pamphlet by Nicholas Kabasilas\nChamaetos (c. 1322/3\u2013after 1391); it reappears in a\nsimilar work of unknown date, transmitted as chapter 3 of a miscellany\nattributed in the (late) manuscripts to\none Herennius.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the development of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy at the hands of Western masters may have encouraged their\nGreek-speaking colleagues to a more intense study of the relevant\ntexts. As noted in section 1.2, a great number of commentaries,\nparaphrases and compendia of Aristotle\u2019s works, mainly but\nnot exclusively on logic and natural philosophy, were produced in the\n13th and early 14th centuries.\n\n\nBlemmydes\u2019 compendia draw for the most part on Aristotle and\nhis late antique commentators, but occasionally other influences are in\nevidence, such as that of John of Damascus in the Epitome\nlogica and that of the Stoic cosmologist Cleomedes in the\nEpitome physica. Besides these two compendia, Blemmydes\ncomposed two anthropological works, De anima and\nDe corpore, and two short treatises on a much-discussed\nquestion of both theological and philosophical import, Against the\nPredetermination of the Terminus of Life, in which he defends\nthe causal connection between moral choice and life span, although he\nproceeds mostly by appeal to authority.\n\n\nThe historian George Pachymeres (1242\u2013c.\n1310), who also taught at the Patriarchal School, wrote a voluminous\nAristotelian paraphrase-compendium covering not only logic and natural\nphilosophy but also metaphysics and ethics, the Philosophia.\nIn addition, he wrote a textbook on the four mathematical disciplines\n(the Quadrivium) and, more importantly,\n\u201cexegetical\u201d commentaries on four Aristotelian works, or\ngroups of works, namely the Organon, the Physics,\nthe Metaphysics and the Nicomachean Ethics, as well\nas the only Late Byzantine commentary on Plato, a continuation of\nProclus\u2019 incompletely transmitted commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which contrasts starkly with its ancient\npredecessor by applying a \u201clogical\u201d (i.e.,\nnon-metaphysical) method of interpretation and a paraphrastic mode of\nexposition. A growing body of evidence shows that Pachymeres was\ndeeply engaged in collecting, transcribing, and editing manuscripts of\nphilosophical authors.\n\n\nPachymeres\u2019 concern with Plato was not coincidental. If the\nboom in Aristotelian studies in this period was partly a response to\nthe challenge of Western philosophy and theology, it seems reasonable\nto think that a similar cause may be found for the rising popularity of\nPlato, who was much less known than Aristotle in the West. Ever since\nLate Antiquity Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy had been\ncommonly regarded as propaedeutic to Platonic metaphysics, and the\nhierarchical relation between the two philosophers was now increasingly\nstressed, sometimes (as in Nikephoros Gregoras\u2019\nPhlorentius) in the context of open criticism of the\nAristotelian inclinations of Latin philosophy. Platonic metaphysics\nwas, however, a theologically precarious field, and it is hardly\nsurprising if those who plowed it were not at all times equally\noutspoken about the fruits of their labor. Still, in the 1260s, George\nAkropolites willingly admitted that his interpretations of Church\nFathers were informed by the divinely inspired Plato, Proclus,\nIamblichus and Plotinus; and towards the end of our period George\nGemistos Plethon went so far as completely to discard Christianity in\nfavor of Neoplatonic polytheism.\n\n\nAnother early Palaiologan compendium extends its ambit to cover\nrhetoric and medicine as well as the whole of philosophy. This is\nthe Encyclopedia of Joseph Rhakendytes\n(aka Joseph the Philosopher, died 1330). Joseph drew heavily on the\nworks of his Byzantine predecessors. His part on logic reproduces\nBlemmydes\u2019 Epitome logica with some additions; his part\non natural philosophy combines works by Blemmydes with works by\nPachymeres and Michael of Ephesus; his part on the quadrivial\ndisciplines is identical with the Logic and Quadrivium by\nthe anonymous of 1007.\n\n\nA contemporary of Pachymeres was Sophonias, a\nConstantinopolitan monk and later Catholic convert, whose hybrid\nparaphrase of Aristotle\u2019s De anima was mentioned in\nsection 1.2. On stylistic grounds the anonymously transmitted\nparaphrases of the Categories, the Prior\nAnalytics, the Sophistici elenchi, and the Parva\nnaturalia edited in CAG 23 and 5 may also be attributed\nto Sophonias. Even though these works are in themselves of limited\nphilosophical interest, it has been shown that Sophonias draws on John\nPhiloponus\u2019 lost commentary on book 3 of the De\nanima (Van Riet 1965).\n\n\nOf more interest is the mostly anonymously transmitted paraphrase of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics edited in CAG 19 as the work\nof Heliodorus of Prusa. This attribution is clearly a\nhoax; in fact the only thing we know about the circumstances under\nwhich the work was composed is that it must have been before 1366,\nwhen the earliest manuscript is dated, and after the composition of\nEustratios\u2019 commentary, on which it draws. It has recently been\nargued (by Trizio 2011) that it originated in the milieu around the\nformer emperor John Kantakouzenos (abdicated 1354).\n\n\nNot all Late Byzantine philosophical authors were content to write\ncompendia, paraphrases, and commentaries on the classical authors. One\nwho decided to write essays on natural philosophy in order to\ninvestigate the relevant questions independently of Aristotle and\nPlato was Nikephoros Choumnos\n(c. 1250/55\u20131327), a leading \ufb01gure at the court of\nAndronikos II in the 1290s and 1300s. Choumnos\u2019 main concern was\nwith elemental theory, cosmology, and psychology. Many of his essays\nseem to have been composed on the occasion of literary gatherings\n(theatra), some of which were presided over by the\nemperor.\n\n\nIt is typical of Choumnos\u2019 approach that he seeks to argue\nphilosophically, that is by valid inference from principles and\ndefinitions that are universally accepted, for views that are already\ntheologically established. Thus he attempts to refute\nAristotle\u2019s theory that the heavens are composed of a fifth,\nnaturally ungenerable and imperishable body, not by simply appealing\nto the Christian doctrine that the world was created at the beginning\nof time and persists only through the grace of its creator, but by\npointing out that Aristotle\u2019s attempt to deduce his theory from the\nfact that the heavens have a circular movement fails, inasmuch as he\nhas only secured the premise that all simple bodies have simple\nmovements, not that all simple movements belong to simple bodies,\nwhich is what his argument requires. Likewise, Choumnos argues by\nelimination against the theory of pre-existing matter (which is how\nhe, following Aristotle, interprets the ch\u014dra of\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus), and insists against the theory of\nseparate forms that if forms do not allow self-predication, they are\nnot participated in by individuals; but if they do, they are not\nuniversal and eternal, but individual and perishable. The bottom line\nis that matter and form are inseparable and simultaneously\ncreated. Another time he attacks the theory of recollection, which he\ntakes to entail the pre-existence of the soul, by flatly denying that\nknowledge can suffer destruction or, obviously, be revived, and\nstressing the fact that this follows from Plotinus\u2019 (whom he\nconsiders to be his main opponent) view that the activities of the\nsoul are immortal. He even prides himself on having proved the\ndoctrine of the resurrection of the body on the basis of Plato\u2019s\nviews on the migration of souls.\n\n\nOriginality of thought and expression was also striven for by\nChoumnos\u2019 rival and adversary at court, Theodore\nMetochites (1270\u20131332). It is perhaps most clearly\nattained in his S\u0113mei\u014dseis gn\u014dmikai\n(Sententious Notes), a collection of 120 essays on subjects as\ndiverse as the reasons for Aristotle\u2019s obscurity and for\nPlato\u2019s use of the dialogue form, the interrelations between\ndifferent faculties of soul, and the pros and cons of different\npolitical constitutions. A significant part of the essays are taken up\nby meditations on the transience of human life, not\ninfrequently bearing on the vicissitudes of Metochites\u2019 own\nlife and career. He also lingered over many of these themes in his\norations, notably On Education.\n\n\nIn a more traditional vein, Metochites wrote paraphrases of all of\nAristotle\u2019s writings on natural philosophy; his proudest\naccomplishment, however, was his monumental Introduction to\nthe study of Ptolemaic astronomy. The superiority of mathematics\n(including astronomy) to natural philosophy is in Metochites\u2019\nview warranted by the higher degree of reality of mathematical objects,\nwhich he seems (especially in his hexameter poem On\nMathematics) to have conceived of as being ultimately derived by\nprocession from intelligible objects, even if he sometimes speaks of\nthem as the products of abstraction from sensibles. The two conceptions\nare probably intended to be complementary, as indeed they are in many\nNeoplatonic writers.\n\n\nMetochites\u2019 student and intellectual heir, Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94\u20131360/61), began his career as an\nastronomer and ended it as a theological controversialist. Some of his\nletters and a few passages of his Roman History touch upon\nphilosophical subjects: especially noteworthy is the vehement criticism\nof Aristotle in the dialogue Phlorentius, ostensibly an\naccount of the author\u2019s debate with Barlaam of\nCalabria (c. 1290\u20131348) in 1331\u20131332. As Gregoras\nnotes with disdain, Barlaam was well-versed in contemporary Latin\nscholasticism; but it was his knowledge in ancient Greek philosophy and\nmathematics (including astronomy) that aroused both admiration and\nhostility when he arrived at Constantinople in the 1320s. In his\nSolutions for George Lapithes he is largely concerned with\ndefending Aristotle against accusations of inconsistency with Plato as\nwell as with himself. In so doing he addresses issues of more profound\nimportance than Gregoras does in his Solutions for Helena\nPalaiologina, which deal principally with problems of natural\nphilosophy; but the Neoplatonic epistemology in Barlaam\u2019s\nSolution 4 and especially his First Greek Letter,\naccording to which scientific knowledge rests on innate\n\u201csubstantial principles\u201d in our souls, which reflect the\ncreative principles in the Divine Intellect, and thus indicate the\ntrue causes of the nature of things, is curiously inconsistent with\nthe theory expounded in his Anti-Latin Treatises, which\nstates that the universal principles in our souls, on which\ndemonstrative arguments are based, are completely derived from the\nexperience of particulars.\n\n\nBarlaam and Gregoras were both on the losing side in the Hesychast\nstrife, which raged between c. 1337 and 1351 and revolved around the\nquestion of theological method. The winner was Gregory\nPalamas (1296\u20131359), famous for his claim that even\nthough God\u2019s substance (ousia) is necessarily concealed\nto us, we can have direct experience of his activities\n(energeiai). The first 29 of Palamas\u2019 150\nChapters attempt to put natural philosophy on a more secure\nfooting by placing facts about the world as a whole\u2014in contrast\nto particular facts, such as astronomical phenomena\u2014in the same\nepistemological category as facts about God and Man, which are only\nknowable through the teaching of the spirit. Thus Palamas expends\nconsiderable energy on denouncing the erroneous views of the Greek\nnatural philosophers, Platonists as well as Aristotelians.\n\n\nIn the last years of the Byzantine Empire, philosophical writers\ntended indeed to identify themselves as either Platonists or\nAristotelians, and to emphasize the disagreements existing between the\ntwo ancient authorities. This approach was very different from the\nharmonizing endeavors of the late antique commentators, and it was left\nas a legacy to Renaissance and early modern Aristotelianism and\nPlatonism. Its roots are to be found in the anti-Aristotelian\nsentiments of 14th-century authors such as Metochites and Gregoras, but\nit came into full blossom in the great controversy which started in\n1439, when George Gemistos Plethon (c.\n1360\u20131452) published his pamphlet De differentiis, and\nground to a halt after the Latin version of Cardinal\nBessarion\u2019s (1403\u20131472) In\ncalumniatorem Platonis was printed thirty years later.\n\n\nPlethon\u2019s pamphlet purported to show how inferior Aristotle was\nto Plato, in spite of being more admired especially in the Latin\nWest. Like Metochites before him, Plethon seems to have drawn on the\nMiddle Platonist Atticus for his criticisms, which cover every part of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy and end with a refutation of\nAristotle\u2019s objections to the Theory of Forms. Aristotle was\nduly assisted by George (Gennadios) Scholarios (c.\n1405\u2013after 1472), whose Contra Plethonem bears\ntestimony to a philosophical education that was clearly more Latin\nthan Greek. Of paramount concern to Gennadios was the repudiation of\nPlethon\u2019s claim that Aristotle\u2019s God is not creator of the\nworld. This is achieved inter alia by recourse to the\ntime-honored hypothesis of eternal creation. As his sobriquet\nsuggests, Gennadios was an extremely erudite man, who prided himself\non being a better Aristotelian commentator than his Byzantine\nforerunners precisely on account of his vast knowledge of the Latin\nliterature, including translations of Avicenna and Averroes. His\ncommentaries on Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories and De interpretatione\nare the most extensive Byzantine ones on these works, and owe a great\ndeal, with respect to their content and form, to earlier and\ncontemporary works in Latin. Especially strong is the influence of\nThomas Aquinas, many of whose works Gennadios also translated, thus\ncontinuing the efforts of\nDemetrios (c. 1323/26\u2013c. 1397/98) and\nProchoros (c. 1333/34\u2013c. 1370/71)\nKydones in the preceding century.\n\n\nThe controversy dragged on with new contributions on Plato\u2019s\nbehalf by Plethon and Michael Apostoles; and on\nAristotle\u2019s by Theodore of Gaza, Andronikos\nKallistos, and George of Trebizond. All\nthese men were native Greek speakers; and except for Trebizond, they\nall wrote in their mother tongue. The importance of the controversy\nfor Renaissance philosophy is largely due to Bessarion, who tried, in\nthe work already mentioned, to give a fair hearing to both\nphilosophers (thus reverting to the traditional approach of\nharmonization), and whose systematic account of Platonism was\nunprecedented in the Latin literature.\n\n\nA few years after his appointment as patriarch in 1454 (thus after the\nfall of Constantinople), Scholarios gave orders for all existing\ncopies of Plethon\u2019s Book of Laws to be destroyed. It is clear\nfrom the remaining fragments that this work constituted Plethon\u2019s\nprescription for a happy life for humankind, advocating an ethics and\na politics inspired by Plato himself as well as by Middle Platonic,\nNeoplatonic, and Stoic writers, and propagating a philosophically\nrefined form of the old Olympian religion. It has been claimed (by\nTambrun 2007 and Siniossoglou 2011) that Plethon rejected the\ntranscendence of the highest god (Zeus), and that his theology\ntherefore, in contrast to both the Christian and the Neoplatonic\nconsensus, was entirely positive, but this appears dubious (see\nHladk\u00fd 2014). One surviving chapter of the Book of\nLaws (De fato) argues, both from the nature of causation\nand from the assumption that the gods have foreknowledge, that all\nevents are determined by fate. According to Plethon, this is\ncompatible with freedom, not in the sense that human beings are not\nruled by anything, but in the sense that they are ruled by their own\nintellect: being free is simply submitting to the decree of Zeus.\nDivine punishment is justified as a method for teaching human beings\nto become free. A combination of Platonic and Stoic influences is also\nmanifest in another short treatise by Plethon, On\nVirtues.\n",
