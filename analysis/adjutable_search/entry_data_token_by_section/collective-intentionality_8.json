    "main_text": "What Is Collective about Collective Intentionality? || Subject\n3.3 Subject\n\nThe philosophically intriguing issues in the theory of intentionality\nare not confined to its content and mode but include the question as\nto what sort of entity is or can be a subject of intentionality. This\nis obviously another core question in the theory of collective\nintentionality, one where philosophical analysis meets with the\ninterests of social science and normative theorizing. Does it ever\nmake sense to say that a social group is the subject of, or just has,\nan intention, a belief, or an emotion? Or are such attributions of\nintentionality to groups merely metaphorical shorthand for referring\nto the attitudes of their members (Quinton 1975)?\n\nSome authors have developed qualified affirmative responses to the\nfirst of these questions and claimed that groups can indeed be\nsubjects (or bearers) of intentional states. One apparently\nstraightforward approach consists in applying the \u2018intentional\nstance\u2019 to groups, i.e., in making groups\u2019 status as\nintentional subjects dependent on whether their behavior can be\ninterpreted as intentional (cf. Tollefsen 2002a, 2002b, and 2015). For\ninstance, if I see a number of people trying to pull a car out of a\nditch, I may be warranted in ascribing relevant beliefs and desires to\nthe group, as in \u201cthe group wants to move the car back onto the\nroad.\u201d Cases like this one are familiar from everyday parlance,\nin which we often encounter attributions of intentional states to\ncorporations or governments. In this respect, interpretationism has\nthe clear advantage of shedding light on the social practice of\nascribing intentionality to groups, but the view needs to integrate an\naccount of the conditions under which such ascriptions are justified.\nIt just does not seem to be all there is to being a collective subject\nof intentionality that a given group can be viewed as such. What is\nneeded to establish that groups can be subjects of intentional states\nis an elaborate account of their internal structure, i.e., of what\nconstitutes them as proper targets for ascriptions of intentionality.\nTollefsen\u2019s interpretationist account here focuses on the\nrational unity certain groups, such as organizations, are capable of\ndisplaying (see Tollefsen 2002a and 2002b, and Rovane 1998).\n\nOne influential account along these lines is Margaret Gilbert\u2019s\nplural subject theory (Gilbert 1989, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2009, and\n2014). Gilbert starts from the basic case of two individuals going for\na walk together. On her account, such an activity requires that they\ntake on what she calls a \u2018joint commitment,\u2019 which she\nexplains as \n\n\na kind of commitment of the will. In this case, the wills of two or\nmore people create it, and two or more people are committed by it.\n(Gilbert 2006: 134) \n\n\nA joint commitment can, on this account, only be brought about (or\nrescinded) jointly. A joint commitment of this kind does not require a\n\u201csingle centre of consciousness\u201d or a \u201cdistinctive\nform of \u2018subjectivity\u2019\u201d (2006: 134), it is the\ncommitment precisely of those bound by it. According to Gilbert, each\njoint commitment is a joint commitment to do X as a body, where\nsubstitutions for \u201cX\u201d include \u201cintend\u201d,\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201caccept\u201d, and so on. A joint\ncommitment to believe something as a body, for instance, is a\ncommitment to constitute as far as possible a single body that\nbelieves that thing, where \n\n\nthe concept of a \u2018single body\u2019 is neutral with respect to\nthe question whether the body in question is in some sense composed of\nindividual human beings. (2006:137) \n\n\nGilbert takes this not to imply that the individuals involved are (or\nhave to be) personally committed to the attitude in question, e.g.,\nthat each or any of them believes what they are jointly committed to\nbelieving as a body (cf. Gilbert 2009). However, joint commitments\nthus specified imply a normative relationship between the parties\nthereby committed: if A and B are jointly committed in\nsome way, then each of them is obligated to act accordingly and each\nof them is entitled to demand the other\u2019s conforming action; in\nother words, they owe each other such action (cf. Gilbert 2009).\n\nGilbert uses this basic structure of joint commitment to define the\ntype of social group she calls \u2018plural subject\u2019: \n\n\nA and B [\u2026] constitute a plural subject\n(by definition) if and only if they are jointly committed to doing\nsomething as a body\u2014in a broad sense of \u2018do\u2019.\n(Gilbert 2006: 145) \n\n\nSuch plural subjects, as a particular sort of social group, can be\nsubjects of intentional states such as intentions, beliefs, and\nacceptance; this is the point at which the account regards the subject\nof collective intentionality.\n\nA number of criticisms can be put forth against Gilbert\u2019s plural\nsubject theory; although they were voiced at earlier stages of the\ndevelopment of the theory, their target has not decisively been moved.\nThe first critical point to note is familiar from the discussions in\nearlier sections of this entry, as it regards a problem of\ncircularity. Does the formation of a joint commitment not already\npresuppose the sort of joint action by plural subject it is meant to\nbring about? It seems to be crucial to the account that when two\nagents say, for instance, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether!\u2019, they unite in virtue of the joint commitment this\ninvolves. But why start precisely there? Couldn\u2019t the two also\nsay, at an earlier point in time, \u2018Let\u2019s jointly commit to\ngoing to the Taj Mahal together\u2019? There is an apparent danger of\nregress or indeed of circularity. However, this objection may rely on\na superficial reading of Gilbert\u2019s theory. Already in the first\ncomplete statement of her view (in Gilbert 1989), she elaborated that\nthe formation of a plural subject, or the entering of a joint\ncommitment, is preceded by an open display of \u2018readiness\u2019\non the part of the individual agents. So before they actually become\njointly committed to do such-and-such \u2018as a body,\u2019\nA and B each indicate that they are ready or willing to\ndo so. This reply by extended narrative is weaker than it might look,\nfor either this means that joint commitments are, as it were,\nput together from personal attitudes of the participants or\nthe respective attitudes instantiate the same sort of circularity that\nwas to be avoided. A possible resort consists in saying that the\nagents themselves do not presuppose the complicated technical\nstructure termed \u2018joint commitment\u2019 or \u2018plural\nsubject,\u2019 which renders the alleged problem of circularity one\nthat exists only for the theorist.\n\nA related critical point is that the process through which joint\ncommitments are brought about, in Gilbert\u2019s analysis, already\ninvolves some form of collective intentionality. This seems obvious in\nthe case of explicit communication, as any communication is a joint\naction. But it is also true in those cases in which the agreement is\ntacit rather than explicit, as this implies some form of mutual\nunderstanding between the participants. It seems plausible to assume\nthat mutual understanding, even if it is tacit, is collectively\nintentional. If Gilbert\u2019s claim is that all collective\nintentionality is of the form of a joint commitment, her account of\nthe process through which joint commitments are generated seems to\npresuppose another joint commitment. If individuals already have to be\njointly committed in some way in order to enter into a joint\ncommitment, however, either a vicious circle or an infinite regress\nseems to ensue. A possible solution would be to claim that joint\ncommitments of the sort that Gilbert envisages are a special\nkind of collective intention, and that they presuppose more basic\nforms of collective intentionality, which are not joint commitments of\nthe Gilbertian sort (Schmid 2005).\n\nA third critique regards the normative internal structure of plural\nsubject, i.e., the claims that the parties to a joint commitment\nassume mutual obligations and entitlements and that this is\ncharacteristic of the basic phenomenon of joint action. In his\ndiscussion of Gilbert\u2019s view, Bratman (1999, chap. 7; 2014,\nchap. 5) rejects the claim that mutual obligations and entitlements\nare constitutive features of joint action. He deems it part of the\nnormal etiology of joint activities that the participants create\nmutual expectations and take on obligations to fulfill them (cf. also\nAlonso 2009, who elaborates a similar point using the concept of\n\u2018reliance\u2019). But Bratman regards these as consequences\nrather than as constituents of such activities. In support of Gilbert\nit should be clarified that she does not speak of the obligations and\nentitlements in question as moral obligations and\nentitlements, but treats them rather as directed obligations\nand as part of the social relationship between the\nparticipants (cf. Gilbert 2006: 155).\n\nA fourth criticism of Gilbert\u2019s view targets the scalability of\nthe conception of joint commitment and plural subjects. Gilbert\naffirms this at great length and claims that even political\ncommunities (or societies) can be understood along those lines, thus\narguing for a view of which she takes traditional social contract\ntheory to be one version (cf. Gilbert 2006, part II). The merits of\nsuch a contractualist approach need not be discussed in the present\ncontext, but the underlying claim that one can extrapolate from the\nbasic case of joint action runs into difficulties when it is viewed in\ncombination with Gilbert\u2019s claim that joint commitments cannot\nbe rescinded unilaterally, but only jointly by all of the individuals\nwho undertake it (cf. Gilbert 2009: 182). This feature of the account\nmay seem counterintuitive already in cases of rather spontaneous\nsmall-scale joint actions, such as when I meet a colleague on the way\nto the lecture hall and we fall into walking together for a bit. But\nthe larger the scale, the more implausible this implication becomes.\nAre we to accept, by way of reductio, that one member of a\npolitical community can hold all others to a social contract (Baltzer\n2002)?\n\nAlthough these critical points might affect the overall reception of\nGilbert\u2019s theory, it surely provides insights concerning some\nfeatures a group is likely to exhibit in order to count as a subject\nof collective intentionality. In particular, its members need to\ncreate a structure that turns the group into an unified entity in the\nsense that it is made the subject of attitudes they together accept\nand are committed to act on. This may, as Hindriks (2008a) notes,\nimply that more is needed than the joint commitment that can be\nexplicated in view of phenomena such as spontaneous joint walks. For\ninstance, the formation of an effective citizens\u2019 movement may\nrequire that the individual agents involved accept the goal of the\njoint enterprise and an internal structure in which roles,\ncompetencies and decision-making mechanisms are defined (see also\nFrench 1984).\n\nRaimo Tuomela gives a more detailed account of the internal structure\nof what he calls \u2018we-groups,\u2019 which he takes to come in\ndifferent varieties, depending on the strength of their members\u2019\nendorsement of and identification with the respective group\u2019s\ngoals (Tuomela 2007, 2013). He draws an analogy between single agents\nand collective agents (cf. 2007: 85\u201386), thus setting the stage\nfor the study of the intentionality specific to group phenomena.\nTuomela acknowledges that the most familiar collective agents,\norganizations and corporations, require a more detailed internal\nstructure that encompasses the relationships between their members,\nrelationships between the members and the respective collective\nagents, and a number of organizational characteristics. In summary,\nthese features comprise members\u2019 collective acceptance\nof and collective commitment to the group\u2019s goals, a\ndistinction between operative and non-operative group\nmembers, the definition of roles and positions\nwithin the group, and the institution (or even codification) of a\ngroup-internal authority system (see also French 1984 for a\nsimilar view of the structure of groups).\u2014It would not pay out\nat this point to reiterate the reflections on Tuomela\u2019s\nindividualism and we-mode analysis mentioned above; instead, we do\nwell to focus on his specification of the status of such groups.\n\nTuomela explains that his \n\n\naccount entails that a we-mode group [\u2026] is a collective\nartefact and indeed an organized institutional entity [\u2026].\nGroup members are viewed as functioning in group positions (be they\ndifferentiated or not). Thus, a we-mode group can indeed be said to\nconsist of such positions. (Tuomela 2007: 20) \n\n\nDespite the emphasis he puts on the organizational features of groups,\nthe following statement testifies to the reductionist social ontology\nTuomela adopts:\n\n\nWe are here somewhat metaphorically viewing groups as analogous to\nindividual agents (persons). [\u2026] In a nutshell, my view is that\ngroups can but need not be taken as (singular) entities, and they are\nagents and persons only in a metaphorical sense. (Tuomela 2007: 140\nand 145) \n\n\nThus, on this account, the aforementioned analogy between single and\ncollective agents is not to be overstated and used to infer that\ncollectives are agents that are (ontologically) on a par with single\nagents. But they may, even on Tuomela\u2019s account, qualify as\nsubjects of intentional states, even as autonomous (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n234), insofar as they consist in a particular organizational structure\nand are upheld by the respective (we-mode-) attitudes of their\nmembers.\n\nA third influential \u2018subject account\u2019 of collective\nintentionality was propounded by Philip Pettit (2001a,b, 2003, 2009).\nThe theory of group agency Pettit has since expounded jointly with\nChristian List (see List & Pettit 2011) is not specifically\ntailored to this issue or voiced in the respective terminology; the\nreconstruction in the following thus concentrates on a brief account\nof Pettit\u2019s initial statement of his view, as it is (in argument\nand terminology) more explicitly stated within a framework that\noverlaps with other conceptions of collective intentionality. In\ncontrast to other accounts, Pettit\u2019s does not start from an\nanalysis of joint action or collective intentional states, thus\ntreating the issues of joint agency and group agency as\ndistinguishable (cf. Pettit & Schweikard 2006). Instead, he\napproaches the issue of whether groups can be subjects of (or have)\nintentions directly by asking whether they can fulfill general\nconditions of agency. And he claims that not only can groups fulfill\nsuch conditions, but that such groups fulfill them as collective units\nof agency whose attitudes may be discontinuous with the attitudes of\ntheir members (cf. Pettit 2002 and 2003).\n\nIn the present context, the latest statement and defense of the entire\nargumentation centered on conditions of agency cannot be taken up (see\nPettit 2007a and List & Pettit 2011, chapters 1\u20133), the\nfocus will instead be on a partial argument regarding one important\nstep in the larger argumentation. It concerns the question whether\ngroups can be subjects of intention. Here it is:\n\n\nFirst premise: there is no intention without a minimum of rationality\non the part of the relevant agent. Second premise: collectives can\ndisplay that minimum of rationality only insofar as they collectivise\nreason, as I shall put it. Conclusion: only groups that collectivise\nreason can properly have intentions. (Pettit 2001b: 241) \n\n\nIn short, the argument supports the view that only those groups\nqualify as subjects of intentions that instantiate a specific kind of\nrationality (see also Tollefsen 2002). In the initial defense of this\nview Pettit refers to consistency, closure, and completeness as\nrequirements of rationality (see Pettit 2001b: 243). By this he means\nthat in order to be rational an entity has to maintain only co-tenable\nattitudes, it forms \n\n\nall those beliefs and intentions, and performs those actions, that are\nrationally required by the things it is rightly said to intend\n(ibid.), \n\n\nand it forms attitudes on all matters relevant to what it can rightly\nbe said to intend. Whether these requirements are really weak enough\nto ground only a \u2018minimum of rationality\u2019 is not entirely\nclear.\n\nIn view of this description of the conditions of rationality it would\nnot seem as though fulfilling them required a complex form of social\norganization. A number of agents, one might say, could simply get\ntogether, jointly pursue a certain goal and decide all relevant\nmatters by majority voting; it might need some organizational\nstructure, depending on the size of the group, but the aforementioned\nconditions of rationality should be satisfiable in this way. Pettit\nrejects this view on the basis of observations about schemes of\nmajority voting that were first, under the label \u201cdoctrinal\nparadox,\u201d noted in jurisprudence, then generalized under the\nlabel of the \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d and became the starting\npoint for the \u2018theory of judgment aggregation\u2019 (cf.\nKornhauser 1992; Pettit 2003; List 2012). The central tenet of these\ndebates is that there is no principled way of securing that\naggregations of consistent sets of votes on interconnected issues are\nthemselves consistent.\n\nAccording to a main lesson from the discursive dilemma, a group that\nis to count as a subject of intentional states has to implement an\ninternal structure and in particular a mechanism for decision-making.\nIf it is to fulfill the requirements initially given by Pettit, it is\n\u201cforced to collectivize reason\u201d (Pettit 2001a: 110). This\nagain means that it has to ensure that the majority votes, which are\neach treated as the group\u2019s view on the respective question,\nform a consistent set of attitudes, even if that implies reconsidering\npast or constraining future judgments. So the group has to monitor its\nattitudes or it may institute a straw vote procedure, which\nfacilitates joint awareness of and deliberation about the\ngroup\u2019s views (cf. Pettit 2007a). In the case described above,\nthe only satisfactory strategy, Pettit holds, would consist in\ntreating the majority votes regarding p and q as\nauthoritative, embrace the logical implication and affirm\n>p&q< (cf. Pettit 2001b: 247). In this way,\nthe group could meet the requirements of rationality. This\nconcludes Pettit\u2019s (early) analysis of the conditions under\nwhich groups can count as subjects of intentional states. It targets\nprimarily the processes of group-internal reflection and\ndecision-making.\n\nTo conclude this section, it bears mentioning that there is an\nimportant but often neglected alternative to studying the\nsubject-aspect of collective intentionality with respect to social\ngroups only. According to this alternative, the subject of\nintentionality does not have to be a \u2018rational unity\u2019 of\nagents (cf. Rovane 1998; Tollefsen 2002; Pettit 2003). Instead, a\nconception of collective intentionality can be open to the view that\ntwo or more individuals jointly form the subject of their collective\nintentional attitudes (cf. Smith 2011). At this systematic juncture,\nthe ontological commitment of an account that specifies the nature of\nthe subject of collective intentionality takes center stage. Here\nagain the crucial questions\u2014and the structure is familiar from\nthe discussion of the other two issues of collectivity\u2014are\nwhether what one wants to call the subject of an intentional attitude\nis irreducible, whether reference to such collective subjects is\nmerely metaphorical, or whether this particular kind of subjecthood\ncan be instantiated by two or more agents jointly.\n",
