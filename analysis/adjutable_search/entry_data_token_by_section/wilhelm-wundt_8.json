    "main_text": "The order of knowledge || Psychology in its relation to the sciences\n7.1 Psychology in its relation to the sciences\n\nAs we have seen, Wundt was concerned not only with expanding the set\nof known psychological facts, but also with interpreting them within\nan appropriate explanatory framework. Of course, the necessity of\nestablishing such a closed framework distinct from physiology amounted\nto distinguishing psychological causality from physical causality in\ngeneral, and hence psychology from the natural sciences altogether.\nBut psychology has to be defined against two other areas of\n\u201cscientific\u201d (wissenschaftlich) inquiry; first,\nin its v\u00f6lkerpsychologisch dimension, against the\nGeisteswissenschaften or \u201chuman sciences\u201d, and\nsecond, against the non-psychological domains of philosophy. As these\nrelationships are laid out below, it must always be remembered that\nalthough these four areas\u2014psychology, philosophy, natural\nscience, human science\u2014are irreducible, this irreducibility is\nnot a metaphysical or ontological one, but merely one of explanatory\nfunction (and commensurate methodology). They do not have distinct\nobjects, but again merely represent ways of describing irreducible\nperspectives upon the same object, namely experience. Wundt\nwrites:\n\n\nObjects of science do not in and of themselves yield starting points\nfor a classification of the sciences. Rather, it is only regarding the\nconcepts that these objects call for that we can undertake\nthis classification. Therefore, the same object [Gegenstand]\ncan become the object [Objekt] of several sciences: geometry,\nepistemology, and psychology each deals with space, but space is\napproached in each discipline from a different angle. \u2026 The\ntasks of the sciences are therefore never determined by the objects in\nthemselves, but are predominantly dependent upon the logical points of\nview from which they are considered. (SP I: 12\u20133; cf.\nL III: 228)\n\n\nWundt\u2019s monism has serious consequences for the sort of claim\nphilosophy (and thus psychology) can make to be scientific. The most\nobvious is that neither can lay claim to synthetic knowledge that is\nnot founded in or (also) describable in terms of the natural or human\nsciences.\n\nFor Wundt, it is only the sciences that have methodologies by which to\nsynthesize our representations, sensible as well as\n\u201cprocessed\u201d, into \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201cpieces\nof\u201d knowledge (Erkenntnisse). Hence, while strictly\nspeaking he is committed to considering psychology (i.e.,\nphysiological psychology and VP) a part of philosophy, he\nusually speaks of them as distinct enterprises. This is because\npsychology is hybrid, adapting scientific methodologies to its\nparticular aims; in this sense psychology, although part of\nphilosophy, synthesizes facts, just like the\n sciences.[47]\n By contrast, philosophy\u2019s pure task is universal,\noperating over all scientific domains; it is, he writes,\n\u201cthe general science whose task it is to unify the general\npieces of knowledge yielded by the particular sciences into a system\nfree of contradiction\u201d (SP I: 9). Philosophy\u2019s\npositive role, therefore, is not to provide the foundations of\nscience, nor can it ever \u201cstep into the role of a particular\nscience\u201d (cf. Kusch 1995: 129); rather it is \u201cto take in\nevery case the already secured results of those sciences as\nits foundation\u201d, and organize them into a single,\noverarching system by determining their points of connection\n(PP I: 8; 6). Wundt calls this side of philosophy\nPrinzipienlehre or \u201cdoctrine of principles\u201d. By\ncontrast, its negative or critical role is to regulate the sciences in\naccord with the imperative of consistent systematicity. In short, it\nhas no constitutive but merely a regulative role\nvis-\u00e0-vis the sciences. Thus, when we return to the\nphilosophical as opposed to the scientific aspect of\npsychology\u2019s hybrid structure, we see that this aspect consists\nin its aim (as opposed to its method) of explaining rules of genesis,\nconnection, and separation of those mental representations with an\nepistemic character. Wundt calls this psychological contribution to\nphilosophy Erkenntnislehre or \u201cdoctrine of\nknowledge\u201d (i.e., the theory of the coming-to-be of knowledge).\nThis explanation then provides to philosophy the scientific foundation\nfor its pure\n task.[48]\n\nWundt divides up the sciences into two large families, the\n\u201cformal\u201d sciences and the \u201creal\u201d sciences. The\nformer include mathematics; the latter study the natural and spiritual\naspects of\n reality,[49]\n and correspondingly are divided into the natural and the human\nsciences. The human sciences in turn are divided into two genera, one\nof which deals with spiritual processes (geistige\nVorg\u00e4nge), the other with spiritual products (geistige\nErzeugnisse). The former just is the science of psychology; the\nlatter includes the general study of these products as such (e.g.,\nphilology, political science, law, religion, etc.), as well as the\nparallel historical study of these products as they have in\nfact been created (This taxonomy is given in SP I:\n19\u201320). Since the process precedes the product (cf. Kusch 1995:\n132), psychology as \u201cthe doctrine of spiritual\n[geistig] processes as such\u201d is the foundation of all\nthe other human sciences (SP I:\n 20).[50]\n Philosophy, in turn, takes psychology\u2019s results and\nagain abstracts from them the normative rules governing the\norganization of the human and natural sciences, something the\nlatter cannot do themselves. In this way psychology as a science\nmediates between the sciences and philosophy.\n",
