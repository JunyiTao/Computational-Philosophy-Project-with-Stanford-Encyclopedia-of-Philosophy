    "main_text": "Constructive Reverse Mathematics\n5. Constructive Reverse Mathematics\n\nIn the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of\nreverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems\naccording to their equivalence to one of a small number of\nset-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals\ninteresting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic\ncomplexity. For example, although the Ascoli\u2013Arzel\u00e0\ntheorem is used in the standard proof of Peano\u2019s existence\ntheorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz\n[1958], page 10), a reverse-mathematical analysis shows that the\nformer is equivalent to a strictly stronger set-theoretic principle\nthan the one equivalent to Peano\u2019s theorem (Simpson [1984],\nTheorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard treatise on classical reverse\nmathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]). \n\nAround the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet\nResources), in the Netherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,\nindependently initiated a programme of constructive reverse\nmathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the\nmodern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which\nwas twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,\nwe describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework\nof BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in\nthe three standard models\u2014CLASS, INT, and RUSS\u2014according\nto which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to\nprove them. \n\nWe stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal CRM, in\nwhich we take for granted the principles of function- and\nset-construction described in the first chapters of Bishop [1967] or\nBishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal, though\nrigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist, topologist,\n\u2026 . \n\nIn practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of\nthese, we consider a theorem \\(T\\) of INT or RUSS, and try to find\nsome principle, valid in that model and other than \\(T\\) itself, whose\naddition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof\nof \\(T\\). In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem \\(T\\) of\nCLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive, and we try to prove that\n\\(T\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one of a number of known\nessentially-nonconstructive principles, such as MP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM.\nFor an example of this part of CRM, we mention our earlier proof that\nthe classical least-upper-bound principle implies, and hence is\nequivalent to, LEM. \n\nIncidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the\nfirst to deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian\ncounterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section\n1 above) lie squarely in the second part of CRM. Even if Brouwer did\nnot state those examples as logical equivalences, but as implications\nof the type \n\\[\nP \\Rightarrow \\text{ some nonconstructive principle},\n\\]\n\n\nit is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side\nimplied the left in such cases.\n",
