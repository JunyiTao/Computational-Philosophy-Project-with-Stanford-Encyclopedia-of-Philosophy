    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege\u2019s Theorem || The Existence of Extensions\n6.4 The Existence of Extensions\n\nThough the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of\nidentity (\u00a72.3) once terms of the form \\(\\epsilon F\\) are added\nto second-order logic, the existence of extensions that are correlated\none-to-one with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question\nfor Frege\u2019s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of\nlogic a statement that implies the existence of individuals and a\ncorrelation of this kind? Frege recognized that Basic Law V\u2019s\nstatus as a logical law could be doubted: \n\n[Gg I, Preface, p. 3:]\n\nA dispute can arise, so far as I can see, only with regard to my Basic\nLaw concerning courses-of-values (V) \\(\\ldots\\) I hold that it is a\nlaw of pure logic. [from the Furth translation in Frege 1967]\n\n\nMoreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of\nthe questions that motivated his work: \n\n[Letter to Russell, July 28, 1902:]\n\nI myself was long reluctant to recognize ranges of values and hence\nclasses [sets]; but I saw no other possibility of placing arithmetic\non a logical foundation. But the question is, How do we apprehend\nlogical objects? And I have found no other answer to it than this, We\napprehend them as extensions of concepts, or more generally, as ranges\nof values of functions. [from the Kaal translation in Frege 1980]\n\n\nNow it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question\nposed here by saying that we apprehend numbers as the extensions of\nconcepts. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question\n\u201cHow do we apprehend extensions?\u201d by saying \u201cby way\nof Basic Law V\u201d. \n\nHis idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be\npurely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we\napprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are materially equivalent. Some philosophers do argue\nthat certain\nconsistent principles having the same logical form as Basic\nLaw V are analytic, and that such principles justify\nreference to the entities described in the left-side\ncondition by grounding such reference in the truth of the\nright-side\n condition.[15]\n\nWhy did Frege think that Basic Law V is analytic and that the material\nequivalence of concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is analytically equivalent to\nan identity that implies the existence of extensions? To hold that\nBasic Law V is analytic, it seems that one must hold that the\nright-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as\na matter of\n meaning.[16]\n This view, however, can be questioned. Suppose the right hand\ncondition implies the left-side condition as a matter of meaning. That\nis, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{R} &\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx) \\\\\n\\tag{L} &\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nNow note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of\nview. The expression \u2018\\(\\epsilon F\\)\u2019, though constructed\nfrom a term-forming operator, is really a definite description\n(\u2018the extension of \\(F\\)\u2019) and so, using\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed\nas the claim: \n\nThere is an object \\(x\\) and an object \\(y\\) such that:\n\n(1) \\(x\\) is a unique extension of \\(F\\),\n\n(2) \\(y\\) is a unique extension of \\(G\\), and\n\n(3) \\(x = y\\). \n\nThat is, for some defined or primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x,F)\\) (\u2018\\(x\\) is an extension of\n\\(F\\)\u2019), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a matter of\nmeaning:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\tag{D} &\\exists x\\exists\ny[\\mathit{Extension}(x,F) \\amp \\forall z(\\mathit{Extension}(z,F) \\to\nz\\eqclose x)\\ \\amp \\\\ &\\quad \\mathit{Extension}(y,G) \\amp \\forall\nz(\\mathit{Extension}(z,G) \\to z\\eqclose y) \\amp x\\eqclose y]\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nBut if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as\na matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This\nconclusion can be questioned: why should the material equivalence of\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning?\nIn other words, the suggestion that Va (i.e., the right-to-left\ndirection of Basic Law V) is analytic leads to a question that has no\nobvious answer. Below, this line of reasoning will be adapted to\nquestion the analyticity of the right-to-left direction of\nHume\u2019s Principle. See Boolos 1997 (307\u2013309), for reasons\nwhy \\(Vb\\) (the left-to-right direction of Hume\u2019s Principle) is\nnot analytic.]\n\nThe moral to be drawn here is that, even if Basic Law V were\nconsistent, it is not exactly clear how its right side analytically\nimplies the existence of extensions. In the end, we may need some\nother way of justifying our knowledge of principles like Basic Law V,\nthat imply the existence of abstract objects \u2013 the justification\ndiscussed so far seems to contain a gap. Even if we follow Frege in\nconceiving of extensions as \u2018logical objects\u2019, the\nquestion remains: how can the claims that such objects exist be true\non logical or analytic grounds alone? We might agree that there must\nbe logical objects of some sort if logic is to have a subject matter,\nbut if Frege is to achieve his goal of showing that our knowledge of\narithmetic is free of intuition, then at some point he has to address\nthe question of how we can know that numbers exist. We\u2019ll return\nto this issue in the final subsection.\n",
