    "main_text": "First-order Probability Logic\n5. First-order Probability Logic\n\nIn this section we will discuss first-order probability logics. As was\nexplained in \n Section 1\n of this entry, there are many ways in\nwhich a logic can have probabilistic features. The models of the logic\ncan have probabilistic aspects, the notion of consequence can have a\nprobabilistic flavor, or the language of the logic can contain\nprobabilistic operators. In this section we will focus on those\nlogical operators that have a first-order flavor. The first-order\nflavor is what distinguishes these operators from the probabilistic\nmodal operators of the previous section.\n\nConsider the following example from Bacchus (1990):\n\nMore than 75% of all birds fly.\n\nThere is a straightforward probabilistic interpretation of this\nsentence, namely when one randomly selects a bird, then the\nprobability that the selected bird flies is more than 3/4. First-order\nprobabilistic operators are needed to express these sort of\nstatements.\n\nThere is another type of sentence, such as the following sentence\ndiscussed in Halpern (1990):\n\nThe probability that Tweety flies is greater than \\(0.9\\).\n\nThis sentence considers the probability that Tweety (a particular\nbird) can fly. These two types of sentences are addressed by two\ndifferent types of semantics, where the former involves probabilities\nover a domain, while the latter involves probabilities over a set of\npossible worlds that is separate from the domain.\n",
