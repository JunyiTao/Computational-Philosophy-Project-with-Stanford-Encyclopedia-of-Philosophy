    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || Problems and Limitations\n4.8 Problems and Limitations\n\nBSM enjoys great popularity in foundational debates due to its clear\nand intuitive theoretical structure. Nevertheless, BSM faces a number\nof problems and limitations.\n\nThe first problem is that BSM only deals with closed systems that\nevolve under their own internal dynamics. As we will see in\n Section 6,\n GSM successfully deals with systems that can exchange energy and even\nparticles with their environments, and systems of this kind play an\nimportant role in SM. Those who think that SM only deals with the\nentire universe can set this problem aside because the universe\n(arguably) is a closed system. However, those who think that the\nobjects of study in SM are laboratory-size systems like gases and\ncrystals will have to address the issues of how BSM can accommodate\ninteractions between systems and their environments, which is a\nlargely ignored problem.\n\nA second problem is that even though macro-states are ubiquitous in\ndiscussions about BSM, little attention is paid to a precise\narticulation of what these states are. There is loose talk about how a\nsystem looks from macroscopic perspective, or there is a vague appeal\nto thermodynamic variables. However, by the lights of thermodynamics,\nvariables like pressure and temperature are defined only in\nequilibrium and it remains unclear how non-equilibrium states, and\nwith them the approach to equilibrium, should be characterised in\nterms of thermodynamic variables. Frigg and Werndl (forthcoming-a)\nsuggest solving this problem by defining macro-states in terms of\nlocal field-variables, but the issue needs further attention.\n\nA third problem is that current formulations of BSM are closely tied\nto deterministic classical systems\n (\u00a73).\n Some versions of BSM can be formulated based on classical stochastic\nsystem (Werndl & Frigg 2017). But the crucial question is whether,\nand if so how, a quantum version of BSM can be formulated (for a\ndiscussion see the entry on\n quantum mechanics).\n Dizadji-Bahmani (2011) discusses how a result due to Linden and\nothers (2009) can be used to construct an argument for the conclusion\nthat an arbitrary small subsystem of a large quantum system typically\ntends toward equilibrium. Chen (forthcoming) formulates a quantum\nversion of the Mentaculus, which he calls the Wentaculus (see\nalso his 2022). Goldstein, Lebowitz, Tumulka, and Zangh\u00ec (2020)\ndescribe a quantum analogue of the Boltzmann entropy and argue that\nthe Boltzmannian conception of equilibrium is vindicated\u00a0also in\nquantum mechanics by recent work on thermalization of closed quantum\nsystems. These early steps have not yet resulted in comprehensive and\nwidely accepted formulation of quantum version of BSM, the formulation\nof a such a version of remains an understudied topic. Albert (2000:\nCh. 7) suggested that the spontaneous collapses of the so-called GRW\ntheory (for introduction see the entry on\n collapse theories),\n a particular approach quantum mechanics, could be responsible for the\nemergence of thermodynamic irreversibility. Te Vrugt, T\u00f3th and\nWittkowski (2021) put this proposal to test in computer simulations\nand found that for initial conditions leading to anti-thermodynamic\nbehaviour GRW collapses do not lead to thermodynamic behaviour and\nthat therefore the GRW does not induce irreversible behaviour.\n\nFinally, there is no way around recognising that BSM is mostly used in\nfoundational debates, but it is GSM that is the practitioner\u2019s\nworkhorse. When physicists have to carry out calculations and solve\nproblems, they usually turn to GSM which offers user-friendly\nstrategies that are absent in BSM. So either BSM has to be extended\nwith practical prescriptions, or it has to be connected to GSM so that\nit can benefit from its computational methods (for a discussion of the\nlatter option see\n \u00a76.7).\n",
