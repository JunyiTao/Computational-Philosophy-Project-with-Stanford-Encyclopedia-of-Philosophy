Clearly there would be no\ngood reason to keep so many of them around unless they did something\nfor us. Function is also a salient feature of biological traits.\nAccounts of biological function, which now comprise a large\nliterature, have inspired many accounts of artifact function. But\nunlike organisms, artifacts are made to serve human purposes, so human\nintentional states must be considered. Accounts of artifact function\ncan be usefully categorized in terms of the role they give to\nintentions in the establishment of functions (Preston 2009; Houkes\n& Vermaas 2010). At one end of the spectrum are accounts that\nrevolve around human intentions, while at the other end are accounts\nthat focus on non-intentional factors; in between are a variety of\naccounts that mix intentional and non-intentional factors in various\nproportions.\n\nKaren Neander (1991) distinguishes artifact function sharply from\nbiological function. Natural selection acting over the long course of\nevolutionary history establishes specific effects of biological traits\nas their functions, in virtue of the reproduction of those traits for\nthose effects. For example, the wings of birds are the result of eons\nof selection for their effect as airfoils. In contrast, intentional\nhuman selection, acting with knowledge and foresight, establishes\nspecific effects of artifacts as their functions immediately, without\nany reference to a history of reproduction for those effects.\n\n\nIt is enough, in the case of intentional selection, if the designer\nbelieves or hopes that the artifact will have the desired effect and\nselects it for that purpose. (Neander 1991, 462)\n\n\nFor example, an individual who designs a hammer, or who uses the heel\nof her shoe to pound in a nail, believing these items to have the\ncapacity to deliver a hard blow and intending to use that effect for\nher purposes, endows them with the relevant function forthwith. John\nSearle (1995) calls such artifact functions \u201cagentive\u201d\nfunctions to distinguish them from the \u201cnon-agentive\u201d\nfunctions of biological traits. Searle also distinguishes a special\nsub-category of agentive functions which he terms \u201cstatus\u201d\nfunctions. These are related in a relatively arbitrary way to the\nphysical structure of the artifact. Money, for example, runs the gamut\nfrom gold ingots to bitcoin. Its functions\u2014medium of exchange,\nmeasure of value, and so on\u2014are imposed on these physical\nbearers by our collective acceptance of them as money. According to\nSearle, the intentional states constituting this collective acceptance\ncreate an \u201cinstitutional fact\u201d that would not exist\nwithout collective human agency. Status functions thus illustrate not\nonly the creative capacity of human intentionality already\nforegrounded in Neander\u2019s account, but also its typically\ncollective nature in the case of artifact function. Searle supplies an\naccount of collective intentionality to underwrite this feature. Other\nauthors who subscribe to intentionalist theories of artifact function\ninclude Randall Dipert (1993), Peter McLaughlin (2001), Lynne Rudder\nBaker (2007), and Simon Evnine (2016).\n\nRuth Millikan (1984) offers a general theory of function that, in the\ncase of artifacts, mixes intentional and non-intentional elements. Her\nmain interest is in proper functions\u2014what a biological trait or\nartifact is supposed to do, and is malfunctioning if it cannot do. On\nMillikan\u2019s view, what she calls direct proper functions, whether\nbiological or artifactual, are established by a history of selection\nand reproduction for the effect constituting the function. So what is\nessential for the establishment of an artifact\u2019s function is\nwhether or not its ancestors\u2014artifacts of that kind\u2014were\nreproduced for that effect. This is what the artifact is supposed to\ndo, even if it is not able to do it because of damage or an\nunfavorable environment. Thus far Millikan\u2019s account is\nnon-intentional, for the role of human intentional states is merely\none factor in the implementation of the reproduction process. However,\nthe other half of Millikan\u2019s account concerns what she calls\nderived proper functions. These are functions that are established by\nsomething that has the direct proper function of producing something\nelse to accomplish a purpose. Millikan\u2019s favored example of\nbiological derived proper function is a novel shade of brown sported\nby a chameleon. It has no history of selection and reproduction for\nthe effect of camouflaging the chameleon, and yet we want to say that\nthat is its proper function. And we can say so, according to Millikan,\nbecause the color-alteration mechanism possessed by chameleons has the\ndirect proper function of changing chameleons\u2019 skin color to\ncamouflage them by matching their surroundings. Thus this novel shade\nof brown does have the derived proper function of\ncamouflaging the chameleon. Derived proper functions in the realm of\nartifacts bring intention back to the fore. On Millikan\u2019s view,\nintentional states have evolutionarily established direct proper\nfunctions. The direct proper function of intentions is to produce\nsomething else to accomplish whatever purpose the intention\nincorporates. Thus, if you intend to produce a can opener, the\nexecution of your intention brings into existence a device having the\nderived proper function of opening cans. Even if this device works in\na completely novel way, and even if it is not capable of performing as\nenvisioned, opening cans is still what it is supposed to do. Usually,\nthe direct and derived proper functions of artifacts coincide\u2014in\nthe case of a standard can opener, for instance, we have both a\nhistory of selection and reproduction and a current intention to\nreproduce yet another can opener. But in the case of novel prototypes,\nespecially, it is intention alone that establishes the (derived)\nproper function.\n\nWybo Houkes and Pieter Vermaas (Houkes & Vermaas 2004; 2010;\nVermaas & Houkes 2003) also have a mixed theory, although\nintentionalist factors predominate, in contrast to Millikan\u2019s\nfocus on non-intentionalist history of reproduction. Their approach is\nto derive a theory of artifact function from a theory of artifact use\nand design.\n\n\nOn our theory, an artifact function is a capacity, supposed or actual,\nwhich has a preferential status in the context of certain actions and\nbeliefs. It is therefore a highly relational property, which\nsupervenes on both the actual physical makeup of an artifact and on\nthe beliefs and actions of human agents, designers as well as users.\n(Houkes & Vermaas 2004, 67)\n\n\nHoukes and Vermaas focus on the use plan formulated by designers as\nestablishing the function of the artifact in the first instance. This\nis the predominant intentionalist element in their account. But on\ntheir view, this use plan must be supported by a justification that\nthe plan will realize the function, and this requires knowledge of the\ncausal roles of the physicochemical capacities of the artifact.\nThrough this required justification the actual physical structure of\nthe artifact constrains the intentions articulated in the use plan.\nThis is a non-intentionalist element. In addition, they require a\nhistorical element in the form of the communication of the use plan\nfrom designer to user and subsequently from user to user. They refer\nto this element as \u201cevolutionary\u201d, in an apparent\nreference to cultural evolution, but clearly this element, too, is\nprimarily intentional since the evolution is carried out in a series\nof intentional communications. Houkes and Vermaas refer to their\ntheory as the ICE (Intention, Causal role, Evolution) theory of\nartifact function. Other mixed theories include those of Paul\nGriffiths (1993) and Philip Kitcher (1993).\n\nAt the lonelier, non-intentionalist end of the spectrum is Beth\nPreston\u2019s (1998; 2013) account. Her initial concern is to\nadvance a pluralist theory of artifact function according to which\nartifacts have both proper functions and what Preston calls system\nfunctions. For example, the proper function of plates is to hold food\nfor serving or eating. But they function equally well as saucers for\npotted plants, or in a stack to weight down tofu or eggplant slices to\nextract the moisture. For proper function, Preston relies on\nMillikan\u2019s account of direct proper function, but without the\nadded element of derived proper function that brings intention back\nin. For system function, she relies on Robert Cummins\u2019 (1975)\ntheory of biological function, according to which function is\nestablished by the causal role a component plays in a system. Neither\nMillikan\u2019s nor Cummins\u2019 account is intrinsically\nintentionalist, since they are designed to fit both the biological and\nthe artifactual cases. Preston resists reformulating them in\nintentionalist terms, while acknowledging that in the artifact case\nhuman intentions and other intentional states do play a role in\nimplementing the history of selective reproduction and the system\ncontext, respectively. In support of this resolutely\nnon-intentionalist stance, Preston argues that human intentions do not\narise in a vacuum, but are reproduced in and through the process by\nwhich material culture, with its myriad of functional artifacts, is\nreproduced. Intentions to make plates are reproduced in plate cultures\nas surely as the plates themselves; and only in cultures with both\npotted plants and plates can intentions to use plates as pot\nsaucers form.\n\n\nThe only viable view is one that sees human purposes and the proper\nfunctions of items of material culture indissolubly linked in patterns\nof use and reproduction. Thus, it no longer seems reasonable to ask\nwhich came first, the purpose or the proper function. Both are\nproduced and reproduced through the self-same social process. (Preston\n2013, 206)\n\n\nPreston is joined here by Crawford Elder (2004), whose account of\ncopied kinds, as we noted above, similarly characterizes human\nintentions as themselves dependent on the copying process rather than\ninitiating and controlling it.\n\nThe theories discussed in this section encounter a number of important\nproblems in accounting for function phenomena in the artifact realm.\nOne such problematic phenomenon is the distinction between proper and\nnon-proper functions. This does occur in the biological\nrealm\u2014pigeon beaks did not evolve to peck buttons for a food\nreward, for example\u2014but it is relatively rare. In material\nculture, it is ubiquitous. Humans are just very good at adopting\nwhatever artifact will accomplish their purposes, regardless of its\nproper function. Stop a random person in the street and ask\u2014she\nwill have a story. Intentionalist approaches have more difficulty\nmaking this distinction, because for these views human intentions are\nthe only mechanism for establishing functions, and this elides the\ndistinction unless some difference can be discerned in the intentions\nthemselves. Authors who have discussed this issue recently include\nWybo Houkes and Pieter Vermaas (2010), Beth Preston (2013) and Simon\nEvnine (2016). Another problem is accounting for malfunction. Just as\nany theory of representation must account for misrepresentation, any\ntheory of function must say something about cases of failure to\nperform, and whether or not that failure is a malfunction or something\nelse. Addressing this issue depends to some extent on the distinction\nbetween proper and non-proper functions, because malfunction only\nseems an appropriate designation in the case of failure to perform a\nproper function\u2014failure to do what the artifact is supposed to\ndo, in other words. This issue is especially important for the\nphilosophy of technology and engineering side of the artifact debates,\nwhere understanding the epistemology of problem solving and innovation\ndepends in part on understanding failure to function and how to learn\nfrom and deal with it. Authors who have covered this issue include\nNeander (1995), Baker (2007), Franssen (2006; 2009), Houkes and\nVermaas (2010) and Kroes (2012).\n\nA third problem is how to account for the functions\u2014if\nany\u2014of novel prototypes. Non-intentional accounts have more\ndifficulty in this case, for a truly novel prototype has no history of\nselection and reproduction; and if it does not work, as many\nprototypes in fact do not, then function established in terms of\nsystemic causal role or physicochemical capacities is not possible\neither. This problem is one of the main motivations for\nMillikan\u2019s (1984) introduction of derived proper function, since\ndesigner intention seems to be the only way unsuccessful novel\nprototypes could acquire any kind of function at all. The\nnon-intentionalist then is caught between biting the\nbullet\u2014unsuccessful novel prototypes just do not have\nfunctions\u2014or introducing an ad hoc intentionalist\nelement. This issue has been canvassed by Preston\n(1998; 2003; 2013), Millikan (1999), Vermaas and Houkes\n(2003) and Kroes (2012). A related problem is how to account for\nso-called phantom functions (Preston 2013)\u2014the functions of\nartifacts that are constitutionally incapable of ever fulfilling them.\nTalismans to ensure fertility, for example, are now widely believed in\nWestern culture to have no efficacy, but it is difficult to escape the\nintuition that ensuring fertility is nevertheless their proper\nfunction. Here again, it is the non-intentionalist who is caught\nflatfooted. Although artifacts like fertility talismans are indeed\nreproduced for a purpose, the standard requirement for establishing\nproper function is that the artifact be selected for reproduction on\nthe basis of successful performance. Similarly, function established\nby systemic causal role requires that the artifact actually perform\nthe relevant causal role. Worse yet, the option of just biting the\nbullet and agreeing that such artifacts have no functions is nowhere\nnear as plausible as in the case of unsuccessful novel prototypes\nbecause of the prevalence of talismans, amulets, religious artifacts,\ninefficacious medicines and supplements, and the like. Authors who\nhave addressed this issue include Griffiths (1993), Preston\n(1998; 2013), Thomasson (2009), Parsons (2016) and Holm\n(2017).\n2.4 Abstract Artifacts\n\nMany works of art are typical artifacts, ontologically no more or less\nmysterious than hats or hacksaws. Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a\nPearl Earring has extraordinary aesthetic qualities, but\notherwise it is just a concrete, spatiotemporal object, created by\nsomeone and straightforwardly subject to change and destruction. Not\nso with Amy Beach\u2019s Gaelic Symphony, which we hesitate\nto identify with its performances, singly or collectively, and which\ntherefore does not appear to be located in time and space. However, it\ndoes purport to have a creator, and may perhaps be destroyed if all\ntraces of its performances and scores are wiped away. A symphony is a\nso-called repeatable work of art, that is, a work with multiple\ninstances. Performance arts of all kinds fall into this category, but\nso do cast sculptures, limited edition prints, art photographs, films,\nand the like. So understanding the ontology of repeatable works is a\ncentral task for philosophy of art.\n\nThe initial difficulty is that such works do not fit neatly into the\nstandard ontological bifurcation between concrete, spatiotemporal\nobjects such as hats and hacksaws and abstract, eternal objects such\nas numbers and sets. Like concrete objects, but unlike abstract\nobjects, repeatable works of art appear to be created and may change\nor be destroyed. Unlike concrete objects, but like abstract objects,\nthey do not appear to be located in space and time. Amie Thomasson\n(1999; 2004; 2006) sought to resolve this difficulty by proposing an\nintermediate ontological category of abstract artifacts\u2014abstract\nin that they are not located in space and time; artifactual in that\nthey are intentionally created and can be destroyed. Thomasson\noriginally proposed this new category as part of her theory of\nfictional characters, but she noted its usefulness to the analysis of\nthe literary works those characters inhabit, repeatable works of art\nin general, and perhaps other social objects as well. (For application\nto repeatable works of art, see the essays in Art and Abstract\nObjects (Mag Uidhir 2012). Applications to other social objects\ninclude software (Irmak 2012), establishments (Korman 2020), and\nnormativity (Frug\u00e9 2022).)\n\nHowever, further difficulties beset the positing of abstract\nartifacts. It is commonly thought that abstract objects are not just\nnon-spatiotemporal, but non-causal. Our causal commerce is with their\ninstances, not with the abstract objects themselves. But this makes it\nhard to understand how abstract objects could possibly be created.\nErik Satie could certainly create an instance of his\nGymnop\u00e9dies by playing it on his piano, but it is\nunclear in what sense he could be the author of this musical work as\nan abstract object separate from its instances. According to Jerrold\nLevinson (1980), the last decades of the 20th century saw a\nnear consensus that musical works are abstract objects of a more\nfamiliar sort\u2014structural types that exist eternally and without\nchange, independent of their instances in the causally governed,\nspatiotemporal realm. A leading objection to this consensus is that\ncomposers cannot then bring their works into existence, contrary to\ncommon sense. So the music ontologist faces a dilemma\u2014give up on\nthe idea that musical works are abstract structural types, or explain\nhow the composer can reasonably be said to create musical works even\nthough the abstract structural types that comprise them are already in\nexistence. This difficulty generalizes to other repeatable types of\nartworks that are held to be abstract objects. But most importantly,\ncharacterizing repeatable artworks as abstract artifacts does not\nallow the ontologist to escape this difficulty. Abstract artifacts do\nnot belong to the causal realm of space and time any more than their\neternal and changeless cousins do. So simply saying that they are\nartifacts, and therefore created and destroyed like all other\nartifacts, does not by itself explain how this creation and\ndestruction is possible.\n\nResponses run the gamut. Julian Dodd (2000) bites the bullet and\nargues that musical works are discovered, not created. Levinson (1980)\nfamously proposes that composers create musical works by selecting\namong and indicating pre-existing abstract sound structures and\npreferred performance means. In western classical music, for example,\nthese indications are embodied in the written score for the work,\nwhich guides the production of instances. However, abstract artifacts,\nby hypothesis, do not pre-exist the creative acts of authors, so they\ncannot be created by Levinson\u2019s selection-and-indication\nprocess. A popular alternative involves the metaphysical relationship\nof existential dependence. On this view, repeatable works of art have\na dependence base, typically consisting of an author\u2019s mental\nand physical acts which bring an initial instance of the work into\nexistence, subsequent copies of that instance that sustain the work,\nand an audience capable of appreciating and interpreting those\ninstances. The work itself is an abstract artifact, dependent on, but\nexisting separately from, these acts and instances. It begins when\nthey begin and ends when they all cease or are destroyed. Nurbay Irmak\n(2021) argues that existential dependence allows for a non-causal type\nof creation. The artist engages in causal relations with concrete\nobjects and by so doing non-causally creates the dependent abstract\nartifact. Lee Walters (2013), on the other hand, argues that some\nabstract objects can enter into causal relationships, so the process\nof creating an existentially dependent abstract artifact might\nconceivably qualify as ordinary causal creation.\n\nThese difficulties have prompted some philosophers to avoid the moves\nthat generate them. An early such attempt is Guy Rohrbaugh\u2019s\n(2003) view that works of art are not abstract objects at all, but\nrather historical individuals\u2014non-physical entities\nontologically dependent on a physical series of historically and\ncausally linked physical objects. For example, a photograph is a\nnon-physical entity dependent on its \u201cembodiments\u201d in a negative\nand subsequent prints. In a more recent proposal, Christy Mag\nUidhir (2013) argues that works of art must have authors, but that\nneither discovery, nor indication of abstract structures, nor\nexistential dependence satisfies the requirements for authorship. He\nconcludes that repeatable works of art cannot be abstract objects of\nany kind, but must rather be ordinary concrete objects. Their apparent\nrepeatability does not mean that they are instances of an abstract\nwork, but only that they bear relevant similarity to one another. In a\nrelated vein, Allan Hazlett (2012) claims that there are no repeatable\nartworks. If there were, he says, they would have to be abstract\nobjects. But abstract objects have all their intrinsic properties\nessentially, whereas artworks typically do not. For example, Alvin\nAiley\u2019s major work, Revelations, premiered as a 10\nsection work lasting an hour, but evolved into a half hour long piece\nin three sections. So, clearly, many of its original properties were\nnot essential to it. Hazlett concludes that apparent repetitions are\nnot instances of an abstract object. They are either separate, similar\nartworks, or copies of an original.\n\nThe discussion of abstract artifacts has been largely confined to the\nontology of art. But as some of the participants have noted (e.g.,\nLevinson 1980, 21\u201322), repeatable works are not confined to\nworks of art. This is particularly clear for named artifacts such as\nChanel No. 5, the Ford F-150, Campbell\u2019s tomato soup, Earl Grey\ntea, the Hepplewhite chair, or the Washington quarter. It is possible\nto see each bottle of Chanel No. 5 or each quarter not as a\ndistinctive artifact in its own right, but as an instance of an\nabstract artifact\u2014Chanel No. 5 tout court, or the\nWashington quarter. Apart from marketing and branding concerns, what\ndoes the naming of such ordinary artifacts accomplish? It highlights\ntheir standardization, and often designates the entity responsible for\nmaintaining it\u2014Ford, in the case of the F-150, for instance. But\nstandardization is a virtually universal feature of human artifacts,\nfrom the Acheulean handaxe to the Apple MacBook Air. There are\nvanishingly few artifacts that are unique in the way non-repeatable\nartworks like paintings are supposed to be. Failed prototypes that\nwere never reproduced might be an example. This means that we are\npotentially swimming in abstract artifacts, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that would entail. This, in turn, highlights views\nopposed to the positing of abstract artifacts, which are more\nplausible in the case of everyday artifacts. We resist thinking of\nperformances of Beach\u2019s Gaelic Symphony as separate,\nrelevantly similar artifacts because we are used to thinking of\nsymphonies as unique, individual works. But the Washington\nquarter does not seem like a work in the same sense, and there is thus\nless reason to resist the idea that individual quarters are just\nrelevantly similar artifacts produced by a copying process managed by\nthe United States Mint. In this regard, we might consider that the\nnotion of the work, functioning as a regulatory concept for the arts,\nis arguably neither universal nor of ancient lineage, even in the\nwestern tradition (Goehr 1993). In short, the time may be ripe\nfor the discussion of abstract artifacts to be expanded to cover\nartifacts in general, perhaps with different outcomes than in its\nnative context.\n",
