    "main_text": "Human Nature\n3. Human Nature\n\nBecause of the absence of a priori demonstrative premises, a moral\nphilosopher arguing from matters of fact had to have detailed\nknowledge of the principles of action in human nature and of moral\npsychology as well as arguments to show how these principles had\nbearing on virtue and vice. Human beings, according to Butler, had\nwithin their nature various instincts and principles of action:\ndesires for particular pleasures, benevolence, self-love, and\nconscience. The practitioner of moral science aimed to discover what\nthese principles are and the ways in which these desires, reasons, and\nmotivations fit together. This is difficult in practice since the\nactions that we observe in ourselves and in others almost always draw\non more than one principle. For example both self-love and the\nparticular passions often go into the motivation or justification for\nparticular actions. Consequently the moral scientist could be said to\nbring a version of Locke\u2019s negative program of underbrush\nclearing in the theory of knowledge to moral philosophy, by analyzing\nand disambiguating principles, motivations, and passions which give\nrise to actions which we judge to be virtuous and vicious. At the same\ntime Butler\u2019s way of thinking about morality as dictated by\nnature had strong resonances with the Stoics and other ancient\nmoralists.\n\nIn order to show how these principles, motivations, and passions bear\non virtue and vice Butler distinguished between three senses of\n\u201cnature\u201d (Sermon 2). Nature (N1) can refer to any\nprinciple or element that belongs to or motivates human beings. It can\nalso refer (N2) to the strongest among a group of principles, i.e., it\nis in our nature to get angry, not to giggle, when unjustly accused.\nFinally it can refer (N3) to natural supremacy, i.e., that a principle\nacts as a law, guide, or authority to other principles or passions.\nButler suggests that whatever is naturally supreme unites various\nprinciples in a teleological system. Consequently Butler can be seen\nto be arguing that when we take a survey of all that belongs to human\nnature (N1) we discover that conscience has natural supremacy (N3) in\na united hierarchy (although see Section Five for Butler\u2019s claim\nthat self-love is also a supreme principle). N1 principles can be\nidentified piecemeal, particular passions that belong to the human\nframe. N2 principles are relational, i.e. the strongest of a group of\nprinciples. N3 principles are relational as well but they are also\nrational and they unify other sorts of principles. By educing a\nhierarchy in the principles of human nature, and by showing that the\nhierarchy is independent of the strength (N2) of the principles as\nmotivations for action, we can demonstrate that what we ought to do\nmorally (N3) may differ from what we are most strongly motivated to do\n(N2) without reflection.\n\nButler\u2019s best-known arguments for the natural hierarchy of\nprinciples draw on a number of analogies: to a watch\n(\u201cPreface\u201d), to a civil constitution (Sermon III), to a\ntree, and to a machine (Sermon 3 Note 1). Just as a clock is not an\nindividual gear, or a pile of gears, but is what it is due to the ways\nin which the gears move together towards an end, so too human nature\nis not a particular principle of action, or a bundle of principles,\nbut the interaction of principles, desires, and reasons, as a system\ntowards ends. That our nature is structured towards ends, which Butler\ntakes to be empirically evident, gives evidence of a hierarchy of\nprinciples to attain the ends, a hierarchy where some principles must\nbe naturally subordinate to others (N3). This shows that there is\nsomething natural to us in the sense of N3, in addition to N1 and N2\n(both of which are a matter of observed fact). \u201cA civil\nconstitution implies in it united strength, various subordinates under\none direction \u2026 a superior faculty whose office it is to\nadjust, manage, and preside over them\u201d (Sermon III \u00a72). The\ngoverning faculty has authority. When a civil constitution is violated\nor overthrown by \u201cmeer power\u201d this goes against the nature\nof the constitution. When a machine\u2019s or a tree\u2019s parts no\nlonger bear proportionate relations among themselves and are no longer\nguided by superior principles, it is broken or sick. By analogy, when\nforceful principles and passions (N2) go against authoritative\nprinciples (N3), or when the principles and passions no longer bear\nthe same relations or are in conflict this goes against our nature and\nis unnatural.\n\nThe analogy suggests that it is unnatural when a N2 principle\noverpowers a N3 principle. The subordination of N2 principles to N3\nprinciples is natural and preserves and guides our natures. N3\nprinciples are what we ought to act on or act in accordance with.\nDeciding whether Butler holds that we ought to act on them just\nbecause they are in accordance with our nature or we ought to act on\nthem because they are morally right and in accordance with our nature\nhas led to some of the most salient objections to Butler\u2019s moral\nphilosophy (see Section 4).\n\nThe supremacy of conscience in human nature can also be shown by a\ncomparison of the constitutions and natures of animals with human\nnature. Animals are driven by principles similar to (or identical to)\nthose that give rise to human actions: they share many of our passions\nand they too are driven by self-interest. When animals act according\nto these principles they act appropriately to their natures (in senses\nN1 and N2). But humans have a principle, conscience, which animals\nlack. This suggests that when humans act only from those principles\nthat they share with animals and not according to conscience they do\nnot act suitably to what is distinctive to their whole nature, and in\nparticular suitable to that end which draws on many of the principles\nof human nature .\n\nInterpreters of Butler have disagreed about the degree to which\nButler\u2019s teleological and hierarchical account of human nature\nrelies on theological premises, and on what sort of teleology is at\nplay. Some interpreters hold that Butler\u2019s arguments that there\nare N3 principles only go through if we assume that God created human\nbeings for a purpose and in accordance with providence (Darwall 1995;\nPenelhum 1985). On this account what human beings ought to be or ought\nto do follows from what they were designed for. Humans were designed\nfor virtue and so they ought to be virtuous. Others suggest that the\nargument has support without recourse to theological arguments, and\nthat the teleological facts about human nature imply norms and values\nthat are obliging without reference to design (Wedgwood 2007; Irwin\n2008).\n",
