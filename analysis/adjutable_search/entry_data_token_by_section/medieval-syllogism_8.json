Later Medieval Developments of the Theory\n\nSyllogistic logic reached the height of its development in Buridan and\nfor the next two hundred years, little was said about it. Buridan\u2019s\nyounger associates at Paris, Albert of Saxony and Marsilius of Inghen,\nwere both competent logicians, but neither made any substantive\nadditions to the theory developed by their master. Paul of Venice was\na well-known early fifteenth-century logician, but he had little to\nsay about the theory of the syllogism. In the late fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries, several very good logicians wrote books on logic,\nperhaps the most skillful being Jodocus Trutfetter, a follower of\nOckham who is better known as a teacher of Martin Luther. But\nTrutfetter\u2019s logic is wholly based on Buridan. In his massive work,\nthe modestly titled, Little Compendium of the Whole of Logic\n(Summulae totius logicae), he extends modal logic beyond\nBuridan to include discussions of epistemic and doxastic modalities.\nHis treatment of syllogistic is perhaps the most extensive in the\nmedieval tradition. \n\nAs noted above, the syllogistic logic of Ockham and Buridan was not\nprimarily aimed at saving Aristotle. But historical interest in\nAristotle returned in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and\nsome scholars, mainly from the Thomistic and Albertist traditions,\nwanted to know what Aristotle had said about syllogistic. There was\nalso the nominalist commentator George of Brussels, who tried to offer\na historically accurate interpretation of Aristotle together with a\nsystematic account along the lines of Buridan. It is interesting to\nnote that the modal syllogistic these philosophers ascribe to\nAristotle is identical to that provided under Kilwardby\u2019s\ninterpretation. (For further discussion of modal logic in the later\nMiddle Ages, see Coombs 1990, Roncaglia 1996, and Lagerlund 2000,\nChapter 8.)\n",
