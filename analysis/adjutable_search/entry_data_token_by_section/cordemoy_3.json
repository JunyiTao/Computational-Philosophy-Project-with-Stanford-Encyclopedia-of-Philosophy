    "main_text": "The Mind and the Body\n4. The Mind and the Body\n\nLike Descartes\u2019 Meditations, the Discernement\ncontains six sections, and also like the Meditations, it\nconcludes with discussions of the union of and the distinction between\nthe mind and the body (though while Cordemoy addresses them in this\norder, Descartes, in the 6th Meditation, first tackles the\ndistinction, and later the nature of the union). But unlike Descartes,\nwho had gone to some length to argue that the nature of the mind is to\nthink, Cordemoy\u2019s Fifth Discourse accepts this as a given.\nFurther, Cordemoy does not provide an argument that the mind and body\nform a substantial union, but gives an example to show that they are\nunited, that of the body moving when the mind wills that it do so. In\nfact, the union is defined in terms of this sort of\ninteraction: to say that the mind and body are united simply is to say\nthat they interact. (Thus the question of whether the problem of the\nmind-body union is distinct from that of mind-body interaction, which\nhas been much discussed in Descartes scholarship, does not arise for\nCordemoy.) The Fifth Discourse also contains Cordemoy\u2019s\nexpansion of his occasionalism to cover interaction between the mind\nand the body. God\u2019s activity is required here on the grounds\nthat as the union is defined in terms of the interaction of\nessentially distinct substances with mutually exclusive essences, we\nmust go outside that union to account for the ability of one substance\nto effect change in the other.\n\nThe final of the six discourses which make up the\nDiscernement addresses the question of the distinction\nbetween the mind and the body, as well as an argument that the\nexistence of the mind is better known than the existence of the body\n(but note: not that the nature of the former is better known\nthan the nature of the latter, as Descartes had claimed) and\na glossary of the affects of the mind, the body, and the mind-body\nunion. Cordemoy\u2019s first argument for the distinction begins by\nlisting a number of features of bodies, and contrasts this with a list\nof features of minds. Seeing that what is most fundamental to body is\nabsent from the list of properties of the mind, and vice versa, he\nconcludes that we thus \u201chave reason to judge that they are two\ncompletely different things\u201d (1968, 153).\n\nCordemoy employs a second argument for the distinction, one which,\nwhile much less rigorous than Descartes\u2019, follows in spirit the\nargument from the Discourse on Method by appealing to doubt:\n\u201cI even see that when I wish to doubt everything that I know\nwhen I think of bodies, I am not able at the same time to doubt my\nthought. For let it be false, if you will, that there are any bodies\nin the world; it cannot be that there are no thoughts, inasmuch as I\nwould be thinking. How could I believe that my thought might be the\nsame thing that I call \u2018body\u2019? I can suppose that there\naren\u2019t any bodies, and I cannot suppose that I do not think, the\nsupposition itself being a thought. Thus I know firstly that the soul,\nor that which thinks, is different from the body\u201d (1968, 153).\nCordemoy goes on to argue along similar lines that he can be assured\nof the existence of his mind, but that the existence of his body, and\nall other bodies, must be taken as an article of faith.\n",
