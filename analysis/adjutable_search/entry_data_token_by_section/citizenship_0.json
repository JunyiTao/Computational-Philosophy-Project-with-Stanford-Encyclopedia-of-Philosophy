    "main_text": "Dimensions of citizenship || Definitions\n1.1 Definitions\n\nThe concept of citizenship is composed of three main elements or\ndimensions (Kymlicka and Norman 2000; Carens 2000). The first is\ncitizenship as legal status, defined by civil, political and social\nrights. Here, the citizen is the legal person free to act according to\nthe law and having the right to claim the law\u2019s protection. It\nneed not mean that the citizen takes part in the law\u2019s\nformulation, nor does it require that rights be uniform between\ncitizens. The second considers citizens specifically as political\nagents, actively participating in a society\u2019s political\ninstitutions. The third refers to citizenship as membership in a\npolitical community that provides a distinct source of identity.\n\nIn many ways, the identity dimension is the least straightforward of\nthe three. Authors tend to include under this heading many different\nthings related to identity, both individual and collective, and social\nintegration. Arguably, this is inescapable since citizens\u2019\nsubjective sense of belonging, sometimes called the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d dimension of citizenship (Carens 2000,\n166), necessarily affects the strength of the political\ncommunity\u2019s collective identity. If enough citizens display a\nrobust sense of belonging to the same political community, social\ncohesion is obviously strengthened. However, since many other factors\ncan impede or encourage it, social integration should be seen as an\nimportant goal (or problem) that citizenship aims to achieve (or\nresolve), rather than as one of its elements. As we will see, one\ncrucial test for any conception of citizenship is whether it can be\nsaid to contribute to social integration.\n\nRelations between the three dimensions are complex: the rights a\ncitizen enjoys will partly define the range of available political\nactivities while explaining how citizenship can be a source of\nidentity by strengthening her sense of self-respect (Rawls 1972, 544).\nA strong civic identity can itself motivate citizens to participate\nactively in their society\u2019s political life. That distinct groups\nwithin a state do not share the same sense of identity towards\n\u2018their\u2019 political community (or communities) can be a\nreason to argue in favour of a differentiated allocation of rights\n(Carens 2000, 168\u2013173).\n\nDifferences between conceptions of citizenship centre around four\ndisagreements: over the precise definition of each element (legal,\npolitical and identity); over their relative importance; over the\ncausal and/or conceptual relations between them; over appropriate\nnormative standards.\n",
