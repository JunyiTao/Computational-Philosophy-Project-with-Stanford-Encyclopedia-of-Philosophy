    "main_text": "What is Architecture? || The Kinds of Things Architecture Makes\n2.3 The Kinds of Things Architecture Makes\nYet another way to pose the question of what architecture is\nfocuses on the sorts of things architectural objects are. In\nparticular, and relative to architecture\u2019s possible status as\nartform, architecture as a domain may be defined variously in terms of\nits objects being art objects (or not), being distinctive sorts of art\nobjects, or belonging exhaustively to a special class of\nbuilt structures (rather than including all such structures). \nWhether architecture always, only sometimes, or never is an\nartform. At the negative extreme, architecture may be viewed\nlike any engineered artifact that only incidentally bears aesthetic\nvalue. Any view of even slightly more positive valence bows in the\ndirection of intent to generate aesthetic value. The classic Vitruvian\nview, for example, has it that engineered design and aesthetic design\nare conjoint intentional elements of architectural objects. At the\npositive extreme, that is, the suggestion that architecture is always\nand in all ways an art, we may lose any means of discriminating among\nbuilt structures as art or not. This is a troubling prospect to\nexclusivists who see architecture as a high art only (see below). \nIn the negative camp, S. Davies (1994) argues that mere production\nof occasional artworks does not suffice to constitute an\nartform\u2014crafts being a notable example\u2014and the aim of\narchitecture is frequently, or even typically, not the production of\nart but useful items that do not aim at artistic value. In the\npositive camp, Stecker (2010) responds that we can carve out a\nsubclass of architectural objects that are art even if not all are. He\nadds, by way of historical argument, that architecture was included\namong the artforms, by early agreement among aestheticians. We might\nhave grounds for dismissing architecture from the canonical list if\nthe nature of architecture has changed, and in this vein Stecker notes\na rising tide of building design that is functionally oriented without\nsignificant aesthetic investment. A further alternative is to say that\narchitectural objects are all art works, or at least intended as such,\nwithin bounds. To make sense of the term \u201cvernacular\narchitecture\u201d requires that we see architectural objects as\ntypically art objects, while we make allowance for a broad class of\narchitectural objects that are low-art rather than high-art. \nIf the negative view is correct, then we need at least a workable\nset of criteria by which to discriminate architectural objects as\nart. To this end, we may draw on our intuitions, norms, or socially\nexpressed views. Further considerations may include the pertinent\ncultural tradition in which an architectural object is created,\nwhether particular sorts of aesthetic qualities count more towards\nartwork status, or whether there is instrumental benefit in\nconsidering the object as art.\nWhat renders architecture distinct from other artforms (if\nit is one). If architecture counts among the artforms, we may\nthink that it has distinctive features as such.  For example, Scruton\n(1979/2013) suggests that architecture is a\nnon-representational artform since it need not\u2014and\ngenerally does not\u2014represent any content. Despite\narchitecture\u2019s non-representational status, Scruton agrees with\nLanger (1953) (and anticipates Goodman (1985)) that architectural\nobjects can express or refer; in his view, to thoughts associated with\nexpressed properties. Others focus on architecture\u2019s distinctive\ncommitments to creator or user engagement. Winters (2011) sees\narchitecture as a \u201ccritical\u201d artform, requiring the\ncreator\u2019s engagement in the environment where other artforms may\ntolerate a creator\u2019s detached stance. Another distinctive mark\nof architecture among the artforms is its nontraditional status as a\nnarrative medium: the design of circulatory pathways allows\narchitectural objects to communicate a sequence of events through the\nmovement of visitors or inhabitants.\nWhether architecture includes all built\nstructures. Among the issues noted here, that of the greatest\nconsequence is the question of what counts among architectural\nobjects. On an inclusivist or expansive conception,\narchitectural objects are those designed objects ranging over the\nwhole of the built environment; on an exclusivist conception,\nthe range describes only some coherent subset of the whole of the\nbuilt environment. Examples of exclusivist subsets include (a) only\nbuilt structures that people can occupy (typically: houses, temples,\noffice buildings, factories, etc.), or (b) only built structures\ndesigned in primarily aesthetic (rather than purely functional)\nterms. An inclusivist conception entails a vastly larger architectural\ndomain of objects\u2014and areas of practice and inquiry.\nProponents of exclusivity (S. Davies 1994, Scruton 1979/2013) are\neager to protect architecture as the preserve of just those objects in\nthe built environment with abundant, apparent, and appreciable\naesthetic qualities; clear creator\u2019s intentions to generate art;\nor the panache of high art and engagement with art historical\ntrajectories. Stecker (2010) offers a putative variation, allowing\nthat as a broader creative medium architecture has an inclusivist\ncharacter\u2014though, as an artform, architecture is\nexclusivist. Scruton, for his part, identifies a specific intent to\nexalt: architecture as a pursuit has lofty goals or purposes,\nsuch that architectural objects do as well. One commonsense\njustification for exclusivity overlaps with an institutionalist\nperspective: laymen and connoisseurs alike can differentiate between\nthe striking work of an architect and the humdrum, cookie-cutter\nbuilding design of a draftsman.\nArguments for inclusivity include Carlson\u2019s appeal (1999) to\nconsider the class of architectural objects as of a continuum with the\nbroader class of everyday designed objects, where everything admits of\npossible aesthetic appreciation. Then, contra Stecker, we can\neffortlessly count all built structures as architecture, though some\nsuch things\u2014like garage doors or drainage ditches\u2014will\nneither look like, nor be, art. Another line of attack is to respond\nto exclusivists that architects simply have intentions to create\nobjects that are, in one aspect, art\u2014and that they may fail as\nart is beside the point. Further, it may be that recognizing\nintentions is irrelevant to judging a built structure as architecture,\nas when we judge as architecture the vernacular structures of foreign\ncultures. In response to Scruton\u2019s exaltation criterion, the\ninclusivist may note that for all artforms, there are typically\ninnumerable objects in the domain with no such goals\u2014and\npossibly no goals at all. Finally, inclusivism has its own commonsense\njustification: we standardly refer to a creator of a mundane built\nstructure as the architect, which seems less a linguistic shortcut\nthan recognition of the training and ethos attached to the creator of\narchitectural objects.\nIt is not clear how to craft intermediary positions between\ninclusivism and exclusivism, given that the various brands of\nexclusivism are not absolute and test cases are instead subject to\njudgment along any number of parameters. Stecker\u2019s exclusivism\nfor only architecture as art represents one such relativized\nstance. Inclusivism, by contrast\u2014along with any attached views\non, for example, architectural appreciation or the nature of aesthetic\nsuccess in architecture\u2014is an absolutist doctrine. All elements\nof the built environment\u2014and much else besides\u2014must count\nas architectural objects, or else the view fails. \n",
