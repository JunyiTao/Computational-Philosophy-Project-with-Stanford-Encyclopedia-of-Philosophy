In the next month\u2019s\nObservatory\u2014the informal monthly publication of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\u2014he took Eddington and his\ntheoretical-realist colleagues to task, concluding that\n\u201ctheories differ simply and solely when their predictions as to\nphenomena differ\u201d; most importantly, \u201cthis method of\ncomparison avoids all reference to distance-assignments,\nworld-geometry, schemes of projection or the like\u201d (Milne\n1934b). In other words, metaphysics was to be avoided in cosmology;\nspace, spacetime, geometry and the like were to be rejected as\nscientific realities, replaced by reference simply and solely to\nobservations. The only realities, according to Milne, were what could\nbe reported among observers about light signals and clocks.\n\nDuring 1934 Milne worked together with his new student A.G. Walker.\nWalker never evinced much interest in the philosophical aspects of\nkinematic relativity, choosing instead to focus tightly upon working\nout the physical details of the theory itself. He had immediate\nsuccess (Walker 1934). One of his important conclusions was that other\nauthors, specifically McVittie and Robertson, were wrong to conclude\nthat the physics of Milne\u2019s theory ultimately corresponded to\nrelativistic cosmology: \u201cMilne\u2019s system is\nfundamentally different from that of general relativity\u201d\n(Walker 1934 p. 489; emphasis in original).\n",
