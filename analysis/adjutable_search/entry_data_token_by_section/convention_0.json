    "main_text": "Issues raised by convention\n1. Issues raised by convention\n\n\nIn everyday usage, \u201cconvention\u201d has various meanings, as\nsuggested by the following list: Republican Party Convention; Geneva\nConvention; terminological conventions; conventional wisdom; flouting\nsocietal convention; conventional medicine; conventional weapons;\nconventions of the horror genre. As Nelson Goodman observes:\n\n\nThe terms \u201cconvention\u201d and \u201cconventional\u201d are\nflagrantly and intricately ambiguous. On the one hand, the\nconventional is the ordinary, the usual, the traditional, the orthodox\nas against the novel, the deviant, the unexpected, the heterodox. On\nthe other hand, the conventional is the artificial, the invented, the\noptional, as against the natural, the fundamental, the mandatory.\n(1989, p. 80)\n\n\nAdding to the confusion, \u201cconvention\u201d frequently serves\nas jargon within economics, anthropology, and sociology. Even within\nphilosophy, \u201cconvention\u201d plays so many roles that we must\nask whether a uniform notion is at work. Generally speaking,\nphilosophical usage emphasizes the second of Goodman\u2019s\ndisambiguations. A common thread linking most treatments is that\nconventions are \u201cup to us,\u201d undetermined by human nature or\nby intrinsic features of the non-human world. We choose our\nconventions, either explicitly or implicitly.\n",
