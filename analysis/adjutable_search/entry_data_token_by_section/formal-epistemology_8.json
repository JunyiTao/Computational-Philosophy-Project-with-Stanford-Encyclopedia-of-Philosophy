    "main_text": "Second Case Study: The Problem of Induction || Updating & Inference\n2.2 Updating & Inference\n\nWhether we prefer the subjectivist\u2019s response to Hume\u2019s\nproblem or the objectivist\u2019s, a crucial element is still\nmissing. Earlier we noted that justifying a Carnapian assignment of\nprior probabilities only gets us half way to a solution. We still have\nto turn these prior probabilities into posterior\nprobabilities: initially, the probability of tails on the tenth toss\nwas \\(1/2\\), but after observing the first 9 tosses come out tails,\nit\u2019s supposed to be \\(10/11\\). Having justified our initial\nassignment of probabilities\u2014whether the subjectivist way or the\nobjectivist way\u2014we can prove that \\(p(T_{10}\\mid\nT_{1\\ldots9})=10/11\\) compared to \\(p(T_{10})=1/2\\). But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean the new probability of \\(T_{10}\\) is\n\\(10/11\\). Remember, the symbolism \\(p(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\\)\nis just shorthand for the fraction \\(p(T_{10} \\wedge\nT_{1\\ldots9})/p(T_{1\\ldots9})\\). So the fact that \\(p(T_{10}\\mid\nT_{1\\ldots9})=10/11\\) just means that this ratio is \\(10/11\\), which\nis still just a fact about the initial, prior\nprobabilities.\n\nTo appreciate the problem, it helps to forget probabilities for a\nmoment and think in simple, folksy terms. Suppose you aren\u2019t\nsure whether \\(A\\) is true, but you believe that if it is true, then\nso is \\(B\\). If you then learn that \\(A\\) is in fact true, you then\nhave two options. You might conclude that \\(B\\) is true, but you might\ninstead decide that you were wrong at the outset to think \\(B\\) is\ntrue if \\(A\\) is. Faced with the prospect of accepting \\(B\\), you\nmight find it too implausible to accept, and thus abandon your\ninitial, conditional belief that \\(B\\) is true if \\(A\\) is (Harman\n1986).\n\nLikewise, we might start out unsure whether the first \\(9\\) tosses\nwill come up tails, but believe that if they do, then the probability\nof the \\(10\\)th toss coming up tails is \\(10/11\\). Then, when we see\nthe first \\(9\\) tosses come up tails, we might conclude that the\n\\(10\\)th toss has a \\(10/11\\) chance of coming up tails, or,\nwe might instead decide we were wrong at the outset to think it had a\n\\(10/11\\) chance of coming up tails on the \\(10\\)th toss if it came up\ntails on the first \\(9\\) tosses.\n\nThe task is to justify taking the first route rather than the second:\nsticking to our conditional belief that, if \\(T_{1\\ldots9}\\), then\n\\(T_{10}\\) has probability \\(10/11\\), even once we\u2019ve learned\nthat indeed \\(T_{1\\ldots9}\\). Standing by one\u2019s conditional\nprobabilities in this way is known as \u201cconditionalizing\u201d,\nbecause one thereby turns the old conditional probabilities into new,\nunconditional probabilities. To see why sticking by your old\nconditional probabilities amounts to turning them into unconditional\nprobabilities, let\u2019s keep using \\(p\\) to represent the prior\nprobabilities, and let\u2019s introduce \\(p'\\) to stand for the new,\nposterior probabilities after we learn that \\(T_{1\\ldots9}\\). If we\nstand by our prior conditional probabilities, then \n\n\\[p'(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9}) = p(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9})=10/11.\\]\n\n And\nsince we now know that \\(T_{1\\ldots9}\\), \\(p'(T_{1\\ldots9})=1\\). It\nthen follows that \\(p'(T_{10})=10/11\\):\n\\[\\begin{align} p'(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\n&= \\frac{p'(T_{10} \\wedge T_{1\\ldots9})}{p'(T_{1\\ldots9})}\\\\\n&= p'(T_{10} \\wedge T_{1\\ldots9})\\\\ &= p'(T_{10})\\\\ &=\n10/11\\end{align}\\]\n\nThe first line follows from the definition of conditional probability.\nThe second follows from the fact that \\(p'(T_{1\\ldots9})=1\\), since\nwe\u2019ve seen how the first \\(9\\) tosses go. The third line follows\nfrom an elementary theorem of the probability axioms: conjoining \\(A\\)\nwith another proposition \\(B\\) that has probability 1 results in the\nsame probability, i.e., \\(p(A \\wedge B)=p(A)\\) when \\(p(B)=1\\).\n(Deriving this theorem is left as an exercise for the reader.)\nFinally, the last line just follows from our assumption that\n\n\\[p'(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9}) = p(T_{10}\\mid T_{1\\ldots9})=10/11.\\]\n\n The thesis that we should generally update probabilities\nin this fashion is known as conditionalization. \n\nConditionalization\n\nGiven the prior probability assignment \\(p(H\\mid E)\\), the new,\nunconditional probability assignment to \\(H\\) upon learning \\(E\\)\nshould be \\(p'(H)=p(H\\mid E)\\).\n\nA number of arguments have been given for this principle, many of them\nparallel to the previously mentioned arguments for the axioms of\nprobability. Some appeal to Dutch books (Teller 1973; Lewis 1999),\nothers to the pursuit of cognitive values (Greaves and Wallace 2006),\nespecially closeness to the truth (Leitgeb and Pettigrew 2010a,b), and\nstill others to the idea that one should generally revise one\u2019s\nbeliefs as little as possible when accommodating new information\n(Williams 1980).\n\nThe details of these arguments can get very technical, so we\nwon\u2019t examine them here. The important thing for the moment is\nto appreciate that (i) inductive inference is a dynamic process, since\nit involves changing our beliefs over time, but (ii) the general\nprobability axioms, and particular assignments of prior probabilities\nlike Carnap\u2019s, are static, concerning only the initial\nprobabilities. Thus (iii) a full theory of inference that answers\nHume\u2019s challenge must appeal to additional, dynamic principles\nlike Conditionalization. So (iv) we need to justify these additional,\ndynamic principles in order to justify a proper theory of inference\nand answer Hume\u2019s challenge.\n\nImportantly, the morals summarized in (i)\u2013(iv) are extremely\ngeneral. They don\u2019t just apply to formal epistemologies based in\nprobability theory. They also apply to a wide range of theories based\nin other formalisms, like\n Dempster-Shafer theory,\n ranking theory,\n belief-revision theory,\n and\n non-monotonic logics.\n One way of viewing the takeaway here, then, is as follows.\n\nFormal epistemology gives us precise ways of stating how induction\nworks. But these precise formulations do not themselves solve a\nproblem like Hume\u2019s, for they rely on assumptions like the\nprobability axioms, Carnap\u2019s assignment of prior probabilities,\nand Conditionalization. Still, they do help us isolate and clarify\nthese assumptions, and then formulate various arguments in their\ndefense. Whether formal epistemology thereby aids in the solution of\nHume\u2019s problem depends on whether these formulations and\njustifications are plausible, which is controversial.\n",
