    "main_text": "\n\nAnthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of Shaftesbury, lived from 1671\nto 1713. He was one of the most important philosophers of his day, and\nexerted an enormous influence on European thought throughout the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Shaftesbury received less\nattention in the twentieth century, but in the twenty-first century\nthere has been a significant increase in scholarship on his work.\n\nShaftesbury believed that humans are designed to appreciate order and\nharmony, and that proper appreciation of order and harmony is the\nbasis of correct judgments about morality, beauty, and religion. He\nwas at the forefront of developing the idea of a moral sense, of\nexplicating aesthetic experience, of defending political liberty and\ntolerance, and of arguing for religious belief based on reason and\nobservation rather than revelation or scripture. Shaftesbury thought\nthe purpose of philosophy was to help people lead better lives.\nTowards that end, he aimed to write persuasively and for the educated\npopulace as a whole, deploying a wide variety of styles and literary\nforms.\n",
