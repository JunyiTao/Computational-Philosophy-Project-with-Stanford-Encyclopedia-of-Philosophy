    "main_text": "Life || Logical Empiricism\n2.3 Logical Empiricism\n\nScholz and his followers adopted the scientific world view as\nadvocated by the philosophers of the neo-positivistic movement, in\nparticular of the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society for Scientific\nPhilosophy. However, contrary to this movement, he even applied the\nscientific world view to metaphysics. This was observed with\nreservations. Otto Neurath, e.g., mentioned Scholz and the\nM\u00fcnster Group as having contributed much of value, but Scholz\n\u201crepresents nevertheless a full-blown metaphysics\u201d\n(Neurath 1937, reprint Neurath 1981, pp. 804\u2013805) which has to\nbe rejected. The relation between Neurath and Scholz remained\nambivalent. At least, they met at the First International Congress for\nUnity of Science at Paris in September 1935. The congress saw the\nestablishment of a committee for the standardization of logical\nsymbolism with members of the Vienna Circle, the Hilbert School, and\nthe M\u00fcnster Group. The initiative had come from Scholz and his\nschool. The results of the committee\u2019s negotiations were\npresented at the Forth International Congress for the Unity of Science\nat Cambridge (England) in July 1938 (cf. Peckhaus 2008, pp.\n78\u201380; Behmann et al. 1937/38).\n",
