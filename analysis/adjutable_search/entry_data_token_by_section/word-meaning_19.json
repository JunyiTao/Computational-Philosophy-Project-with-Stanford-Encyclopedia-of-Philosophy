    "main_text": "Cognitive Science || Psycholinguistics\n5.2 Psycholinguistics\n\nIn psycholinguistics, the study of word meaning is understood as the\ninvestigation of the mental lexicon, the cognitive system\nthat underlies the capacity for conscious and unconscious lexical\nactivity (Jarema & Libben 2007). Simply put, the mental lexicon is\nthe long-term representational inventory storing the body of\nlinguistic knowledge speakers are required to master in order to make\ncompetent use of the lexical elements of a language; as such, it can\nbe equated with the lexical component of an individual\u2019s\nlanguage capacity. Research on the mental lexicon is concerned with a\nvariety of problems (for surveys, see, e.g., Traxler & Gernsbacher\n2006, Spivey, McRae & Joanisse 2012, Harley 2014), that center\naround the following tasks:\n\n Define the overall organization of the mental lexicon, specify\nits components and clarify the role played by such components in\nlexical production and comprehension;\n Determine the internal makeup of single components and the way\nthe information they store is brought to bear on lexical\nperformance;\n Describe the interface mechanisms connecting the mental lexicon\nto other domains in the human cognitive architecture (e.g.,\ndeclarative memory);\n Illustrate the learning processes responsible for the acquisition\nand the development of lexical abilities.\n\n\nFrom a functional point of view, the mental lexicon is usually\nunderstood as a system of lexical entries, each containing\nthe information related to a word mastered by a speaker (Rapp 2001). A\nlexical entry for a word w is typically modeled as a complex\nrepresentation made up of the following components (Levelt 1989,\n2001):\n\n A semantic form, determining the semantic contribution\nmade by w to the meaning of sentences containing\nw;\n A grammatical form, assigning w to a\ngrammatical category (noun, verb, adjective) and regulating the\nbehavior of w in syntactic environments;\n A morphological form, representing the morphemic\nsubstructure of w and the morphological operations that can\nbe applied on w;\n A phonological form, specifying the set of phonological\nproperties of w;\n An orthographic form, specifying the graphic structure\nof w.\n\n\nFrom this standpoint, a theory of word meaning translates into an\naccount of the information stored in the semantic form of lexical\nentries. A crucial part of the task consists in determining exactly\nwhat kind of information is stored in lexical semantic forms as\nopposed to, e.g., bits of information that fall under the scope of\nepisodic memory or general factual knowledge. Recall the example we\nmade in\n Section 3.3:\n how much of the information that a competent zoologist can associate\nto tigers is part of her knowledge of the meaning of the word\n\u2018tiger\u2019? Not surprisingly, even in psycholinguistics\ntracing a neat functional separation between word processing and\ngeneral-purpose cognition has proven a problematic task. The general\nconsensus among psycholinguists seems to be that lexical\nrepresentations and conceptual representations are richly interfaced,\nthough functionally distinct (e.g., Gleitman & Papafragou 2013).\nFor example, in clinical research it is standard practice to\ndistinguish between amodal deficits involving an inability to\nprocess information at both the conceptual and the lexical level, and\nmodal deficits specifically restricted to one of the two\nspheres (Saffran & Schwartz 1994; Rapp & Goldrick 2006;\nJefferies & Lambon Ralph 2006; more in more in\n Section 5.3).\n On the resulting view, lexical activity in humans is the output of\nthe interaction between two functionally neighboring systems, one\nbroadly in charge of the storage and processing of\nconceptual-encyclopedic knowledge, the other coinciding with the\nmental lexicon. The role of lexical entries is essentially to make\nthese two systems communicate with one another through semantic forms\n(see Denes 2009). Contrary to the folk notion of a mental lexicon\nwhere words are associated to fully specified meanings or senses which\nare simply retrieved from the lexicon for the purpose of language\nprocessing, in these models lexical semantic forms are seen as highly\nschematic representations whose primary function is to supervise the\nrecruitment of the extra-linguistic information required to interpret\nword occurrences in language use. In recent years, appeals to\n\u201cultra-thin\u201d lexical entries have taken an eliminativist\nturn. It has been suggested that psycholinguistic accounts of the\nrepresentational underpinnigs of lexical competence should dispose of\nthe largely metaphorical notion of an \u201cinternal word\nstore\u201d, and there is no such thing as a mental lexicon in the\nhuman mind (e.g., Elman 2004, 2009; Dilkina, McClelland & Plaut\n2010).\n\nIn addition to these approaches, in a number of prominent\npsychological accounts emerged over the last two decades, the study of\nword meaning is essentially considered a chapter of theories of the\nmental realization of concepts (see the entry on\n concepts).\n Lexical units are seen either as ingredients of conceptual networks\nor as (auditory or visual) stimuli providing access to conceptual\nnetworks. A flow of neuroscientific results has shown that\nunderstanding of (certain categories of) words correlates with neural\nactivations corresponding to the semantic content of the processed\nwords. For example, it has been shown that listening to sentences that\ndescribe actions performed with the mouth, hand, or leg activates the\nvisuomotor circuits which subserve execution and observation of such\nactions (Tettamanti et al. 2005); that reading words denoting specific\nactions of the tongue (\u2018lick\u2019), fingers\n(\u2018pick\u2019), and leg (\u2018kick\u2019) differentially\nactivate areas of the premotor cortex that are active when the\ncorresponding movements are actually performed (Hauk et al. 2004);\nthat reading odor-related words (\u2018jasmine\u2019,\n\u2018garlic\u2019, \u2018cinnamon\u2019) differentially activates\nthe primary olfactory cortex (Gonzales et al. 2006); and that color\nwords (such as \u2018red\u2019) activate areas in the fusiform gyrus\nthat have been associated with color perception (Chao et al. 1999,\nSimmons et al. 2007; for a survey of results on visual activations in\nlanguage processing, see Martin 2007).\n\nThis body of research originated so-called simulationist (or\nenactivist) accounts of conceptual competence, on which\n\u201cunderstanding is imagination\u201d and \u201cimagining is a\nform of simulation\u201d (Gallese & Lakoff 2005). In these\naccounts, conceptual (often called \u201csemantic\u201d) competence\nis seen as the ability to simulate or re-enact perceptual (including\nproprioceptive and introspective) experiences of the states of affairs\nthat language describes, by manipulating memory traces of such\nexperiences or fragments of them. In Barsalou\u2019s theory of\nperceptual symbol systems (1999), language understanding (and\ncognition in general) is based on perceptual experience and memory of\nit. The central claim is that \u201csensory-motor systems represent\nnot only perceived entities but also conceptualizations of them in\ntheir absence\u201d. Perception generates mostly unconscious\n\u201cneural representations in sensory-motor areas of the\nbrain\u201d, which represent schematic components of perceptual\nexperience. Such perceptual symbols are not holistic copies of\nexperiences but selections of information isolated by attention.\nRelated perceptual symbols are integrated into a simulator\nthat produces limitless simulations of a perceptual component, such as\nred or lift. Simulators are located in long-term\nmemory and play the roles traditionally attributed to concepts: they\ngenerate inferences and can be combined recursively to implement\nproductivity. A concept is not \u201ca static amodal structure\u201d\nas in traditional, computationally-oriented cognitive science, but\n\u201cthe ability to simulate a kind of thing perceptually\u201d.\nLinguistic symbols (i.e., auditory or visual memories of words) get to\nbe associated with simulators; perceptual recognition of a word\nactivates the relevant simulator, which simulates a referent for the\nword; syntax provides instructions for building integrated perceptual\nsimulations, which \u201cconstitute semantic\ninterpretations\u201d.\n\nThough popular among researchers interested in the conceptual\nunderpinnings of semantic competence, the simulationist paradigm faces\nimportant challenges. Three are worth mentioning. First, it appears\nthat imulations do not always capture the intuitive truth conditions\nof sentences: listeners may enact the same simulation upon exposure to\nsentences that have different truth conditions (e.g., \u201cThe man\nstood on the corner\u201d vs. \u201cThe man waited on the\ncorner\u201d; see Weiskopf 2010). Moreover, simulations may\noverconstrain truth conditions. For example, even though in the\nsimulations listeners typically associate to the sentence \u201cThere\nare three pencils and four pens in Anna\u2019s mug\u201d, the pens\nand the pencils are in vertical position, the sentence would be true\neven if they were lying horizontally in the mug. Second, the framework\ndoes not sit well with pathological data. For example, no general\nimpairment with auditory-related words is reported in patients with\nlesions in the auditory association cortex (e.g., auditory agnosia\npatients); analogously, patients with damage to the motor cortex seem\nto have no difficulties in linguistic performance, and specifically in\ninferential processing with motor-related words (for a survey of these\nresults, see Calzavarini, to appear; for a defense of the embodied\nparadigm, Pulverm\u00fcller 2013). Finally, the theory has\ndifficulties accounting for the meaning of abstract words (e.g.,\n\u2018beauty\u2019, \u2018pride\u2019, \u2018kindness\u2019),\nwhich does not appear to hinge on sensory-motor simulation (see Dove\n2016 for a discussion).\n",
