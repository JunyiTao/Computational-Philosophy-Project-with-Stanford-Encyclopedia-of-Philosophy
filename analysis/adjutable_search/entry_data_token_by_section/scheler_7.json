    "main_text": "Philosophical Anthropology and Metaphysics\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nScheler occupies a precarious position in the history of the\nphenomenological movement. Unlike many of the giants in the tradition,\nScheler was not a student of the master, Husserl. Phenomenology is an\n\u201cattitude\u201d to which Scheler arrives after he completes his\nformal studies. His first published works are not, strictly speaking,\nphenomenological. Husserl and the phenomenological approach provided\nScheler access to phenomena he had previously only hinted at or viewed\nfrom afar, phenomena such as moral and emotional experience. When\nScheler was introduced to phenomenology, it was in its infancy, still\ndiscovering itself as a distinctive approach. Both of these factors,\nScheler\u2019s maturity as a philosopher and phenomenology\u2019s\nimmaturity as a movement, provided Scheler the freedom to develop\nphenomenology in his own unique style as well as to test its\nlimits.\n\nMany of the differences between Scheler and his fellow\nphenomenologists, whether in terms of style or content, could be\nattributed to a difference in their personalities. Yet, there are at\nleast notable and substantial differences between Scheler and other\nphenomenologists such as Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. For\nexample, Scheler draws a much sharper line between existence and\nspirit, between the real and the ideal, between object and act. This\ncan be seen most acutely in Scheler\u2019s understanding of the\nintuition of essences and how such an intuition participates in the\nbecoming-God. In terms of style, Scheler worked solely from insight\nand refused to follow any prescribed method or pedagogy. His tendency\nwas to move directly to the most profound or deepest of insights,\nrather than develop levels of phenomenological analysis, e.g., static\nand genetic, or hermeneutic. As a result, Scheler does not hesitate to\ntake up subjects such as ethics, politics and religion. This lack of\nmethod in Scheler is in part due to the foundational nature of the\nemotional life, his conviction that love is the ground for knowledge\n\u2013 a foundational relation in direct opposition to Husserl. If\nthere is a single point or thought that best captures the distinctive\nnature of Scheler\u2019s approach in contrast to that of his fellow\nphenomenologists, it is his notion of the human being as person. This\n\u201cchoice\u201d of human being as person in contrast to\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental ego, Heidegger\u2019s Dasein or\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s lived-body gives a particular directedness to\nScheler\u2019s thought, an emphasis on the personal dimension of\nexperience. Scheler\u2019s world is cast in a much different relief\nand as a consequence, is illuminated by such personal experiences as\nthe love of others and the divine.\n",
