    "main_text": "Objections to Externalist Versions of Foundationalism || A Challenge to Necessity: The New Evil Demon Problem\n7.2 A Challenge to Necessity: The New Evil Demon Problem\n\nThe objections discussed above challenge the sufficiency of the\nexternalist\u2019s proposed conditions for justification. However,\neven if the above counterexamples to sufficiency are met, we might\nquestion whether the externalist\u2019s conditions capture something\nessential to or necessary for foundational justification, or for the\njustification of other beliefs on the basis of foundational ones. Is\nunconditional, belief-independent reliability, for example, really\nnecessary for justification at the foundational level? And is\nconditional, belief-dependent reliability really necessary for the\njustification of other beliefs?\n\nThe \u201cnew evil demon problem\u201d (Lehrer and Cohen 1983; Cohen\n1984) challenges the claim that externalist conditions like\nreliability really are necessary. Suppose that there is a subject that\nis just like you in all internal respects, except that while your\nbeliefs are (let\u2019s assume) reliably produced, your twin\u2019s\nor counterpart\u2019s are not, for his or her beliefs are produced by\na powerful deceiving demon. Intuitively, your twin is no less\njustified than you are. But given that your twin\u2019s beliefs are\nnot reliable, the reliabilist must say that your twin\u2019s beliefs\nare not justified.\n\nVarious responses have been proposed. Some see no significant problem\nwith denying that the evil demon victim is justified. If this is not a\nblanket rejection of the appeal to intuitions, it would help to\naccount for the intuitions in some way, and some responses that appeal\nto an ambiguity in \u201cjustification\u201d could be understood as\ndoing just that. For example, Goldman (1988) says that the\ncounterpart\u2019s belief is \u201cweakly justified\u201d in the\nsense that the belief, though formed by an unreliable process, is one\nthe subject is epistemically responsible or blameless for having, but\nthe belief is not \u201cstrongly justified\u201d in the sense that\ninvolves reliability. This does not seem to be adequate, for\nintuitively, there is something positive about the deceived\ncounterpart\u2019s situation that is not captured by saying that he\nis epistemically responsible or blameless. A subject who reasons in\naccordance with principles that are horribly defective in ways he\ncannot detect may have tried his best and be as epistemically\nblameless as an evil demon victim who attends carefully to his\nexperiences and follows good principles of reasoning, but\nthere\u2019s something clearly positive about the latter\u2019s\nepistemic situation that goes beyond epistemic blamelessness (see Audi\n1993: 28, and Pryor 2001: 117 for discussion of this point). Some\nexternalists like Bach (1985) and Engel (1992) posit a similar sort of\nambiguity between doxastic and personal justification, i.e., between a\nbelief\u2019s being justified and a person\u2019s\nbeing justified in holding the belief, so that the demon victim is\njustified in believing as he does, but his beliefs are not justified.\nKvanvig and Menzel (1990) object that a person\u2019s being justified\nin believing something entails that their belief is justified, so that\nthe distinction cannot help with the problem, but Littlejohn (2009)\nargues that there is no such entailment, that the distinction between\npersonal and doxastic justification is coherent and well-motivated,\nand that it can help with the new evil demon problem.\n\nRather than simply deny the intuition, or explain it away by positing\nan ambiguity, a number of reliabilists attempt to accommodate the\nintuition by amending the conditions for justification. An earlier\nresponse by Goldman (1986) attempts to defend \u201cnormal worlds\nreliabilism\u201d according to which a subject\u2019s belief is\njustified if the process producing the belief is reliable in normal\nworlds, where a \u201cnormal world\u201d is, roughly, a world where\nour general beliefs about the actual world are true. It is no surprise\nthat Goldman himself was quick to give this up. One obvious worry with\nthis response is that it rules out even the possibility that\n\u201cabnormal\u201d processes like clairvoyance be justified.\nAnother is that it rules out the possibility that our general beliefs\nabout the world are unjustified (Pollock and Cruz 1999: 115). More\nrecently, some have suggested more sophisticated amendments to the\nconditions or to the sort of reliability required so as to accommodate\nthe intuition while avoiding the problems of normal worlds reliabilism\n(see Comesa\u00f1a 2002; Majors and Sawyer 2005; Henderson and\nHorgan 2006).\n",
