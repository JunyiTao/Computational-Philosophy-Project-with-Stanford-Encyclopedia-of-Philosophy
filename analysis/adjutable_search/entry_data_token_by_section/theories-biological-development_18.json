At early stages of\nmammalian development when embryonic stem cells are most plentiful, in\nthe blastocyst stage just before implantation, stem cells can be\nharvested and cultured to become a large number of different kinds of\ncells (Thomson et al. 1998). In theory, they have the capacity to\nbecome any kind of differentiated cell, but it is impossible to prove\nthat conclusively (Fagan 2013b). Position in the organism and with\nrespect to other cells seems to be decisive in directing\ndifferentiation. Although genetics provides information about the\nrange of possibilities, regulation of gene expression involves diverse\nfactors\u2014and stem cells\u2019 plasticity and context-dependence\nfits a more epigenetic view. Cell reprogramming, for example, is a\nmethod of producing stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) from\nmore differentiated cells, effectively reversing normal development\n(Takahashi & Yamanaka 2006). This contradicts any strict principle\nof development as irreversible and internally-directed, undermining\nthe notion of a fixed program for development (Brandt 2010). Melinda\nCooper (2003) examines how central concepts of stem cell research\n(potency, differentiation, form, and regeneration) fit within the long\ntradition of theorizing about epigenesis and self-organization, dating\nfrom seventeenth-century revivals of Aristotelian embryology.\n\nAriane Dr\u00f6scher (2014) traces the history of conceptual change\nconcerning stem cells via lineage tree diagrams, a form of visual\nrepresentation common to studies of development and of evolution.\nLineage diagrams track relations between generations of reproducing\nentities. From Haeckel\u2019s speculative image of the Tree of Life\nand Weismann\u2019s introduction of \u201ccytogenetic tree\ndiagrams\u201d, Dr\u00f6scher examines this cell-centric way of\nunderstanding development from the mid-nineteenth century onward.\nScott Gilbert (1991) shows that branching tracks have been used to\nrepresent cell development since the late nineteenth century, most\nprominently in cell lineage diagrams that track cell pedigrees and\ndivision events. In these models, branch-points represent cell\ndivision events and branching tracks represent genealogical relations\namong cells. Other cell characteristics are also represented, such as\nposition within the developing embryo, morphology, and developmental\nfate. Waddington\u2019s landscape is a model of this type (see\n Section 8.1).\n Fagan (2013a) uses this modeling approach to characterize cell\ndevelopment in general. Any process of cell development produces a\ncell lineage tree with a specific topology, representing developmental\nand reproductive relations between cells. Different stem cell concepts\ncorrespond to models that differentially constrain the space of\npossible topologies for cell lineage trees. This framework provides a\nsystematic representation of the many different varieties of stem\ncell.\n\nFagan (2013a, 2017) extends this cell lineage framework to\ncell-molecular and cell-organism relations, yielding a cell-centric\nmulti-level model of development. Her view of the cell-molecular\nrelation is that of systems biology: a cell state is a pattern of gene\nexpression and molecular interactions that determines a cell\u2019s\nstructural and functional characteristics. The cell-organism relation\nis \u201cenkaptic\u201d\u2014that is, cells reproduce and\ndifferentiate (the two defining stem cell abilities) and are collected\nor encapsulated into a higher-level system: gastrula, tissue, organ,\nor an experimentally-produced organoid or embryo-like structure. The\nhigher-level system emerges via formation of a boundary separating it\nfrom its environment. So different levels or scales of a developmental\nprocess are related by \u201cboundary-formation\u201d. On this view,\ndevelopment is a process comprised of multi-layered interactive\nnetworks, arranged in strata (layers) related by an encapsulating\nboundary. Each network is related to the one below by\nboundary-formation, conceived as emerging out of (and imposing\nconstraints on) smaller-scale interactions such that an encapsulating\nsystem is distinguished from its environment.\n\nJane Maienschien and Kate MacCord offer a suggestive look at\nregeneration as a response of complex systems to injury through\nrepair. (Maienschein and MacCord, 2022) The repair draws on inherited\nand in some ways predelineated organization, as well as on responses\nto changing environments. Both Fagan\u2019s stem cell-based\nalternatives to predetermined development and Maienschein and\nMacCord\u2019s suggestions about regeneration across all scales of\nlife hark back to Morgan\u2019s suggestion that\n\n\na process of pure epigenetic development, as generally understood\nnowadays, may also be predetermined in the egg. (Morgan 1901: 968)\n\n\nThe nowadays of the twenty-first century may take us back to some of\nthe understanding and insights of the early twentieth, a time when a\nbalance of epigenesis and preformation seemed likely.\n",
