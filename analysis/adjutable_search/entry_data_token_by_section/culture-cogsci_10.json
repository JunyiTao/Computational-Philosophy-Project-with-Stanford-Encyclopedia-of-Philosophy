    "main_text": "Influence on Philosophical Debates\n4. Influence on Philosophical Debates\n\nAs illustrated throughout the previous sections, philosophers have not\nbeen mere consumers of research on the cognitive science of culture,\nbut also active contributors to various projects. This section shifts\ngears, highlighting several areas in which philosophers have worked to\nclarify the implications of this research for more conceptual debates\nand to draw out its consequences for discussions that have\ntraditionally been seen as philosophical.\n\nIndeed, philosophers are more and more frequently weaving insights and\nevidence about culture and cognition into discussions across a number\nof areas of philosophical inquiry. This entry does not pretend to\nprovide an exhaustive overview of such work. Thus, it is worth\nexplicitly noting that scholars in nearly every philosophical subfield\nhave used findings from the cognitive science of culture and cultural\ndiversity to enrich their understanding of their subject matter and\nsupport their arguments. For example, in the philosophy of religion\nand philosophy of language, recent insights into the cognitive\nfoundations and dynamics of culture have been used to argue that human\ncapacities for religion and language are not as universal and/or\ninnate as many philosophers have taken them to be (Cloud 2014; Davis\n2020). In aesthetics, philosophers have used work on culture and\ncognition to explore more specific questions about phenomena that were\nalready taken to exhibit significant culturally variation, such as\nartistic form and aesthetic taste (Jan 2007; Verpooten & Dewitte\n2017). In what follows, the focus will be on philosophical\nsubdisciplines were the influence of work on the cognitive science of\nculture and cultural diversity seems to have been most pervasive:\nphilosophy of mind, philosophy of psychiatry, ethics, epistemology,\nand philosophical methodology.\n",
