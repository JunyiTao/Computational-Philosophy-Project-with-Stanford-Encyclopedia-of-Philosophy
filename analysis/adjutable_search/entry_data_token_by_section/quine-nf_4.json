Other Current Research Areas\n\n\nZF arose as an attempt to axiomatise the theory of wellfounded sets,\nand this principle is kept constantly in mind by the ZF-istes as they\nstruggle to find new and more informative axioms. In contrast, the\nsyntactic version of the noncircularity insight (which is the one that\nunderlies NF) has been a much less fertile source of axioms for its\noffspring. Most new axioms for NF are either versions of AC or\npostulates of smooth behaviour by the \\(T\\) functions. It may be\nmore natural to compare/contrast NF with Zermelo set theory rather\nthan with ZF(C); Zermelo was a first attempt at formalising a theory\nof sets-of-ordinary-mathematics; it took a few decades for it to\nbecome clear that the pack of axioms needed the axiom scheme of\nreplacement, and it could be argued that NF should be analogously\naugmented with axioms such as the axiom of counting (which says that\nthe singleton function restricted to the natural numbers is a set), or\nwith the axiom of choice for wellfounded sets.\nNF and Proof Theory\n\n The proof theory of stratified formul\u00e6 is intriguing but\nfrustratingly little work has been done on\nit. The sentence\n\n\\[\n\\forall x[\\forall y(y \\in x \\rightarrow \\forall z(z \\in y) \\rightarrow \\bot)\n\\rightarrow \\forall z(z \\in x) \\rightarrow \\bot]\n\\]\n\n\n is an example of a stratified theorem of first-order logic that has\nstratified proofs but no stratified cut-free proofs. Crabb\u00e9\n[1991], [1994] has given two proofs of the fact that SF (NF with\nextensionality dropped altogether) admits cut-elimination. The\nconnections with type theory make constructive versions of NF an\nobvious target for investigation, but nothing publishable has emerged\nso far. The only known proof (Specker\u2019s) of the axiom of infinity in\nNF has too little constructive content to allow a demonstration that\nINF (NF with a constructive instead of classical ambient logic) admits\nan implementation of Heyting arithmetic, but opinion is divided on\nwhether or not this tells us that INF is significantly weaker than NF.\n\n",
