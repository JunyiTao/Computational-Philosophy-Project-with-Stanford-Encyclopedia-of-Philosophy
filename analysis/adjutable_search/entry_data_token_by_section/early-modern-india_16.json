    "main_text": "Causation and the Causal Theory of Knowledge || Overview of Causation\n6.1 Overview of Causation\n\nThe study of causation is an important part of Indian philosophical\nthought. One reason for this is the early interest in cosmological\nspeculation: \u201cWe should remember that philosophic activity in\nIndia arose out of the cosmogonic speculations of the Vedas and the\nUpani\u1e63ads. The all-important business of philosophy was to\nattempt to discover some simple, unitary cause for the origin of this\ncomplex universe\u201d (Matilal 1985: 287). Another reason is that\nIndian linguistics (especially the P\u0101\u1e47inian system of\n\u2018k\u0101rakas\u2019 or relations between verb and\nnoun, which greatly influenced Ny\u0101ya,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Buddhist thinkers) is based on an\nunderlying causal model, in which the verb in a sentence designates an\nevent, for the production of which each such object as is designated\nby a noun has a particular causal role. This same model informed and\ninfluenced Indian epistemology, and led to the development of the\ntheory of \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2019, the causal means\nor processes leading to an epistemically accredited awareness-event\n(pram\u0101). In the Ny\u0101ya tradition, four such\npram\u0101\u1e47as are recognised: perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\n\u2018analogical identification\u2019 or \u2018comparison\u2019\n(upam\u0101na) and testimony (\u015babda). The\naccounts given of each of these employ an extremely causalistic idiom,\ntypical questions being \u2018what causes a perceptual\nexperience?\u2019, \u2018what are the distinguishing causal factors\nof true and false perceptual experiences?\u2019, \u2018under what\nconditions does knowledge of the premises of an argument cause\nknowledge of the conclusion?\u2019, etc.\n\nThe choice of examples undoubtedly influences one\u2019s causal\ntheory. The Naiy\u0101yikas almost invariably illustrate their\ndiscussions with one of the following three examples: (i) The\npotter-pot example. The effect is the finished pot. Some of its\ncauses are the pot-halves (which the potter joins to form the pot),\nthe potter, his wheel and stick, the contact between each of the\npot-halves, and between them and the stick, etc. (ii) The\nthread-cloth example. Here the effect is the piece of cloth.\nAmong its causes are the threads from which it is woven, the weaver,\nthe shuttle, the loom, various contacts, etc. (iii) The axe-tree\nexample. The effect, i.e. the felling of the tree, is caused by\nthe axe, its contact with the tree, the axeman, etc. Some of the\nquestions we would like to ask here are these. Can all instances of\ncausation be fitted into the general pattern illustrated by these\nexamples (e.g. is there always an \u2018agent\u2019)? Do the\nNaiy\u0101yikas have an adequate account of causation even for these\nexamples (i.e. can they distinguish between those factors which are,\nand those factors which are not, causes of the effect)? Can both\nobjects and events be causes? Are causal relations singular or based\non repeatable regularities? Attempts to answer such questions as these\nled to increasingly sophisticated accounts of causation as the\nNy\u0101ya school evolved.\n",
