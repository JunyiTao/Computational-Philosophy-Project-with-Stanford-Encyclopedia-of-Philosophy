    "main_text": "Ontological: Moral Facts and Moral Naturalism || Non-natural Facts\n3.2 Non-natural Facts\n\n\nOne might suppose that the obvious alternative is to think of moral\nreality as embedded in the natural world as opposed to the\nsupernatural. However, for reasons that we will turn to shortly, many\nphilosophers have strongly resisted this option and have proposed that\nmoral knowledge has its basis in non-natural aspects of the world that\ncan be apprehended only through a faculty of moral intuition or reason\nthat is independent of sense experience. Moral reality, so conceived,\nis posited as sui generis, reducible to neither the natural nor the\nsupernatural and requiring a mode of apprehension comparable to\nmathematical intuition.\n\n\nAn immense variety of views fall within this category. At one extreme\nis the idea that we can apprehend a priori a general principle from\nwhich we can derive particular moral claims using non-moral facts as\nminor premises. According to Henry Sidgwick (Sidgwick, The Methods\nof Ethics, 1907), we know a priori several self-evident axioms\nthat are objectively true, including axioms of benevolence and\njustice, and that lead together to the conclusion that each of us\nought to do what will bring about the best consequences when their\nvalue is known by the ratio of pleasure over pain in them viewed\nimpartially. (See de Lazari-Radek & Singer, 2014, for an\nup-to-date exposition and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s famous work in light\nof current issues in moral philosophy and Sidgwick\u2019s struggle to do\njustice to Egoism.) Sidgwick\u2019s ethical theory, a form of\nutilitarianism, contrasts with Kant\u2019s deontological theory, according\nto which we know, again a priori, that we ought to treat each person\nas an end, never merely as a means (Kant, Groundwork of the\nMetaphysic of Morals, 1785). Both imply specific moral\nconclusions, such as that a given promise ought to be kept, once we\nunderstand what is involved in breaking and keeping the promise,\neither regarding their consequences (Sidgwick) or regarding what is\nentailed in the will to do either act (Kant). The important point is\nthat the derivations depend on assuming as a premise something that\ncan be known only a priori. \n\n\nAt the other extreme are forms of moral particularism, according to\nwhich one directly intuits the moral rightness or wrongness of an act\nonce one has understood its particular natural features (see the entry\non\n moral particularism).\n As in\nthe previous case it is necessary to comprehend the non-moral features\nof the situation before a specific moral judgment can be made and known\nto be true. In making this judgment, however, one must rely not merely\non knowledge of these non-moral features but on one\u2019s ability to intuit\nthe moral significance of these features. The difference between the\ncases is only that in the first we appeal to a general principle, while\nin the second we intuit the moral truth directly. In both, moral\nintuition is essential to arriving at moral knowledge. W. D. Ross\nprovides an example of a mixed form of moral intuitionism (Ross 1930).\nOn his theory we have an intuitive grasp of principles that tell us\nwhat we ought to do \u201cother things being equal\u201d (e.g., one ought to be\nkind, other things being equal). Then we must use moral intuition again\nto decide in a given case, which may involve conflicting principles,\nwhat action we ought to perform, all things considered.\n\n\nOne concern about all forms of moral intuitionism is the fact that\npeople can continue to disagree about the moral facts when they appear\nto agree on the non-moral facts. If we all possess the same faculty of\nmoral intuition, should such disagreement be possible at all? But the\nmoral intuitionist can counter this objection in the way suggested\nearlier when we considered the argument against the possibility of\nmoral knowledge based on disagreement. There are too many other\nfactors that may explain disagreement without giving up the assumption\nthat we share a faculty of moral intuition. Another concern is that we\nlearn what is right and wrong initially from examples and advice of\nour elders. Isn\u2019t this fact about moral development inconsistent with\nthe idea that morals are based ultimately on a priori intuition? It\nappears not. We begin to learn mathematics in a similar way, using\nconcrete examples and relying on authority. Then, as we develop\nunderstanding, we are eventually able to grasp relevant truths, such\nas that 2 + 2 = 4, in a way that is not dependent on the vagaries of\nexperience. If we put two oranges in a hat and then add two more and\nsubsequently find five there, we assume an extra one was there to\nbegin with or that it is a trick hat or that the oranges can\nmysteriously reproduce themselves. We don\u2019t doubt that 2 + 2 =\n4. Similarly, it may be argued, once we grasp the wrongness of\ntreating another person merely as a means, finding many examples of\nthis treatment or many people who think the treatment is right won\u2019t\nin the least alter, or even seem relevant to, our perception of its\nwrongness. (See, however, Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, and the reply by\nShafer-Landau 1988.)\n\n\nA less superficial objection is that it is possible to explain both\nthe origin and usefulness of our moral perceptions without supposing\nthat any non-natural moral realm exists as an object of moral\nknowledge. This objection is similar to the last in that it emphasizes\nour dependence on examples and authority in acquiring moral perceptions\nthat are stable once the relevant non-moral facts are at hand, but the\nclaim is not that this dependence is inconsistent with the existence of\na non-natural moral reality. Rather the claim is that postulating the\nlatter reality is unnecessary to comprehending all the facts about\nmoral development and the social usefulness of moral codes. We don\u2019t\nneed to assume such a reality in order to explain all that is beyond\ndoubt and hence don\u2019t need to postulate a faculty of moral intuition of\nany of the kinds just canvassed. Moral intuition and the moral\nknowledge it is presumed to make possible are redundant hypotheses that\nwe can safely discard. It is largely this dismissal of moral\nintuitionism that has given rise in the second half of the last century\nto moral naturalism as the dominant moral theory among those who\ncontinue to believe that moral knowledge is possible.
