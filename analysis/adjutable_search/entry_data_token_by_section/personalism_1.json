Personalism\u2019s historical antecedents\n\n\nThe term \u201cpersonalism\u201d made its world debut in Germany,\nwhere \u201cder Personalismus\u201d was first used by F. D. E.\nSchleiermacher (1768\u20131834) in his book \u00dcber die\nReligion in 1799. Amos Bronson Alcott seems to have been the\nfirst American to use the term, calling it in an 1863 essay \u201cthe\ndoctrine that the ultimate reality of the world is a Divine Person who\nsustains the universe by a continuous act of creative will.\u201d The\nterm \u201cAmerican personalism\u201d was coined by Walt Whitman\n(1819\u20131892) in his essay \u201cPersonalism,\u201d which was\npublished in The Galaxy in May 1868. In 1903 Charles\nRenouvier published Le Personnalisme, thereby introducing the\nword into the French as well. The word \u201cpersonalism\u201d first\nappeared as an encyclopedic entry in Volume IX of Hastings\u2019s\nEncyclopedia of Religion and Ethics in 1915 in an article by\nRalph T. Flewelling.\n\n\nAccording to Albert C. Knudson, personalism is \u201cthe ripe fruit\nof more than two millenniums of intellectual toil, the apex of a\npyramid whose base was laid by Plato and Aristotle.\u201d\nCatholic personalists emphasize more specifically\nthe decisive role of medieval thought, and in particular scholasticism,\nfor the development of personalism. \u00c9tienne Gilson, for\ninstance, has observed that where Plato locates the center of reality\nin ideas with concrete instantiations of these being merely accidental,\nand Aristotle places emphasis not on numerical individuals but on the\nuniversal specific form, Thomas Aquinas saw the individual person as\nunique among beings because of reason and self-mastery. Though none\ngoes so far as to call Aquinas a personalist, some suggest that he\nfurnished the necessary soil in which personalistic theory could take\nroot. In this regard, Karol Wojty\u0142a wrote that Aquinas\n\u201cprovided at least a point of departure for personalism in\ngeneral.\u201d\n\n\nThe term\nperson comes from the Latin persona, whose origins\nare traceable to Greek drama, where the\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, or mask,\nbecame identified with the role an actor would assume in a given\nproduction. Such usage is carried over today in the word\n\u201cpersona,\u201d referring to characters in fictional literature\nor drama, or second identities which people adopt for behavior in given\nsocial contexts. Its introduction into the mainstream of intellectual\nparlance, however, came with theological discourse during the patristic\nperiod, notably the attempts to clarify or define central truths of the\nChristian faith. These discussions focused primarily on two\ndoctrines: the Trinity (three \u201cpersons\u201d in one God) and the\nincarnation of the second person of the Trinity (the\n\u201chypostatic\u201d union of two natures \u2013 divine and\nhuman \u2013 in one \u201cperson\u201d). Confusion marred these\ndiscussions because of ambiguities in the philosophical and theological\nterminology, such that, for example, the thesis \u2013 ascribed to Sabellius\n\u2013 would be advanced that in God there was one\n\u03cd\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 and\nthree \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1, where\n\u03cd\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\nconveyed the meaning of \u201cperson\u201d and\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1 bore the sense of\n\u201croles\u201d or \u201cmodes\u201d of being. In order to\npresent these mysteries with precision, the concept of person and the\nrelationship of person to nature needed clarification. The debates\nculminated in the First Council of Nicaea (325) and the First Council\nof Constantinople (381), and in the drafting and propagation of the\nNicene-Constantinopolitan creed.\n\n\nThough the philosophical concept of person first developed in this theological\ncontext, with reference to the persons of the Trinity, the general\nGreek philosophical concepts involved in these Trinitological origins\nfacilitated its application to human beings as well. Philosophical\npersonalism may or may not appropriate the theological suppositions\nwith which the early usage of the term \u201cperson\u201d is\nladen. The classic, basic, and purely philosophical definition which\nis still accepted by personalists, as far as it goes, was given early\non by Boethius (ca. 480\u2013524): \u201cpersona est naturae\nrationalis individua substantia.\u201d This definition consists of\ntwo parts. The essential starting point is a subsistent individual: a\nsingular, existing suppositum or\n\u03cd\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Here the\nadjective \u201cindividual\u201d distinguishes an existing substance\nfrom common or second substance. The second element of the\ndefinition \u2013 naturae rationalis \u2013 qualifies the\nnotion of individual substance: the person is an individual possessing\na\nrational nature. It is this rational, spiritual nature that\ngives rise to the different qualities that distinguish the person,\nqualities to which personalists attach decisive importance.\n\n\nThe Trinitological concept of the person was far from the modern\nmeaning that the term assumes in personalism, and Boethius\u2019\ndefinition too indicates only in the barest abstract outline the deep\nand comprehensive signification that personalism ascribes to it. As\naccepted by personalism, it is the result of a long and complex\ncumulative development, resulting in a rich, if somewhat elusive,\nconcept which in some respects wholly inverts the original\nconnotations of exteriority in the early meanings of\n\u201cmask\u201d and \u201crole\u201d: person comes rather to\ndenote the innermost spiritual and most authentic kernel of the unique\nindividual, while retaining a radical openness to the\nexternal. Already in the course of the Middle Ages, further\ndefinitions were provided, and not just by Aquinas. Not least the\nAugustinian example of experienced interiority and reflexivity, the\nidea of form as the principle of individuation, and the late medieval\nand Franciscan emphasis on will and singularity entered into early\nmodern thinking about the person, and combined with the stronger focus\non human personality that was characteristic of Renaissance\nhumanism.\n\n\nAlong these lines, the early modern concepts of subjectivity and\nself-consciousness added new elements to the definition and\nunderstanding of the central concept in personalism, or even\nsubstantially altered it. Immanuel Kant\u2019s epistemic dualism,\nunderscoring the importance of both subject and object in knowledge,\nopened the door both to the idealistic form of personalism and to the\nphenomenology and existentialism that became so important for\ntwentieth-century personalism. Kant also contributed significantly to\nthe personalist understanding of human dignity. Unlike Hobbes, for\nwhom \u201cthe worth of a man\u201d is \u201chis price,\u201d and\ndignity is \u201cthe publique worth of a man,\u201d Kant regarded\ndignity as \u201cintrinsic worth\u201d. He posited a dichotomy\nbetween price and dignity, whereby \u201csomething that has a price\ncan be exchanged for something else of equal value; whereas that which\nexceeds all price and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a\ndignity.\u201d His celebrated practical categorical\nimperative \u2013 Act so as to treat humanity, whether in your own\nperson or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means\nonly \u2013 was incorporated nearly verbatim into Karol\nWojty\u0142a\u2019s \u201cpersonalist principle.\u201d\n\n\nPersonalism in the sense of a distinct philosophy or worldview\nfocusing on the full, accumulated import of the concept of the person,\nhowever, emerged only in the context of the broad critical reaction\nagainst what can be called the various impersonalistic\nphilosophies which came to dominate the Enlightenment and Romanticism\nin the form of rationalistic and romantic forms of pantheism and\nidealism, from Spinoza to Hegel.  Key figures in this reaction were\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743\u20131819), the initiator of the\nso-called Pantheismusstreit in the 1780s, and\nF. W. J. Schelling (1775\u20131854), who in his later work rejected\nthe impersonalist positions of his early idealist systems. But these\nwere only the most important figures in a broad movement that included\nmany other philosophers, primarily the so-called speculative theists,\nas well as theologians, both Catholic and Protestant. The modified\nidealistic, theistic personalism developed in this counter-movement\nbecame decisive, not least via its late German representative, Rudolph\nHermann Lotze (1817\u201381), not only for the American, idealistic\npersonalism of Bowne, but also for the parallel, British idealistic\npersonalism whose leading representative was Andrew Seth\nPringle-Pattison (1856\u20131931). Although the continental European\npersonalists of the twentieth century would reject Hegelian idealism and turn\ninstead to phenomenology, existentialism, and Thomism, the outline of\nthe personalistic criticism of impersonal modes of thought was already\nclearly and consistently developed by the thinkers here mentioned,\never since the last decades of the eighteenth century.\n\n\n\nPersonalism thus arose as a reaction to impersonalist modes of thought\nwhich were perceived as dehumanizing. The impersonal dynamic of modern\npantheism and monism in both their rationalistic and Romantic forms\nunderlie many of the modern philosophies that personalism turns\nagainst, idealistic as well as materialistic. The radical idealism of\nG. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) held that Kant\u2019s noumenal reality is\nnot an unknowable substratum of appearances, but a dynamic process,\nwhich in thought and in reality passes from thesis to antithesis, and\nfinally resolves itself in synthesis. This process is absolute mind,\nthe state, religion, philosophy. Hegel\u2019s idealism saw history as an\nunfolding of absolute spirit through a necessary dialectical process,\nand this framework left little room for the freedom or significance of\nindividual persons. Through the Young Hegelians, this impersonalist\nform of idealism was soon transformed into equally impersonalist forms\nof materialism, culminating in Marxism, which regards the essence of\nman as his true collectivity; impersonalist determinism, in the form\nof Communism, decisively determined twentieth-century political\ntotalitarianism. In other thinkers, idealism tended to merge with\nincreasingly naturalistic forms of nationalism and racialism, giving\nrise to other new political movements in the twentieth century that\nelevated alternative collectivities above the person, such as national\nsocialism. Personalism always resisted the absorption of the\nindividual into the collectivity by asserting the inherent worth of\nthe singular person. The person should never be a mere means to an\nend, subordinated to the will and purposes of another. The state\nexists for persons, and not persons for the state. In this regard,\npersonalism stands as a foil to totalitarianisms that value persons\nonly for their worth to the community, and insists instead on their\ninherent dignity. Thus R. T.  Flewelling could write that \u201cthe\nperson is the supreme essence of democracy and hostile to\ntotalitarianisms of every sort.\u201d Personalism\u2019s insistence on\npersonal freedom and responsibility, self-determination, creativity,\nand subjectivity all bear out this deep-seated resistance to\ncollectivism.\n\n\nParallel to the development and transformation of Hegelianism, other\ntheories of human nature were developed in the course of the\nnineteenth century that blurred or cancelled the distinction between\nman and the rest of nature, and downplayed or denied man\u2019s unique\nindividual value, spiritual nature, and free will. These theories too,\ndirectly or indirectly, contributed to twentieth-century\ntotalitarianism. The philosophical positivism of Auguste Comte\n(1798\u20131857) affirmed as a historical law that every science (and\nthe human race itself) passes through three successive stages, the\ntheological, the metaphysical, and the positive, each superior to the\nlast. Comte insisted so much on the reality and predominance of\nsociety that this became for him the true subject, while the\nindividual was regarded as an abstraction.  Darwinism, in particular,\nuprooted the classical understanding of human beings as essentially\nsuperior to the rest of creation by offering a theory whereby man\nwould be simply the most advanced life form along an unbroken\ncontinuum, and the difference between man and irrational animals would\nmerely be one of degree, not of kind.\n\n\nThe emerging personalist philosophy, however, rejected impersonalism\nnot only in the form of idealistic or materialistic determinism and\ncollectivism, but also in the form of the radical individualism that\nwas equally a product of modern rationalism and romanticism, and\nwhich, through, for instance, certain forms of liberalism and\nanarchism, was also characteristic of the nineteenth century. From the\nbeginning, personalism proclaimed in its own way the communitarian\nvalues of solidarity and inter-relation. In their insistence on\ninviolable dignity, personalists resisted a utilitarianism which would\nmake one person merely \u201cuseful\u201d for another. Whereas\nindividualism tends to seek the self above all and often views others as means to\none\u2019s own profit, personalism seeks to make of the self a gift to\nanother.  \u201cThus,\u201d Emmanuel Mounier later wrote, \u201cif\nthe first condition of individualism is the centralization of the\nindividual in himself, the first condition of personalism is his\ndecentralization, in order to set him in the open perspectives of\npersonal life.\u201d Where individualism hopes to find personal\nrealization in self-interest, personalism asserts the need\nfor relational openness to others, even as a condition for one\u2019s own\nrealization.\n\n\nKarol Wojty\u0142a characterized the two extremes of individualism and\ncollectivism in the following way: \u201cOn the one hand, persons may\neasily place their own individual good above the common good of the\ncollectivity, attempting to subordinate the collectivity to themselves\nand use it for their individual good. This is the error of\nindividualism, which gave rise to liberalism in modern history and to\ncapitalism in economics. On the other hand, society, in aiming at the\nalleged good of the whole, may attempt to subordinate persons to\nitself in such a way that the true good of persons is excluded and\nthey themselves fall prey to the collectivity. This is the error of\ntotalitarianism, which in modern times has borne the worst possible\nfruit.\u201d\n\n\nThe existentialism that gave such important impulses to much\ncontinental European personalism in the twentieth century developed in\ncertain respects in the line of the later Shelling\u2019s philosophy, and\ntraces even of Jacobi\u2019s criticism of impersonal pantheism can be found\nin it.  With Schelling, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855)\nopposed Hegel\u2019s idealism and underscored the value of the individual\nperson, both for philosophy and for life in general. He accused\nidealism of emptying life of meaning by neglecting the reality of\nhuman existence. Whereas Kierkegaard and some later existentialists\n(Marcel, Sartre, Camus, Blondel) focused on issues central to the\nmeaning of human existence (love, marriage, death, faith, morality,\netc.), other thinkers continued to focus on the more direct\nexploration of the meaning and nature of the person himself, and it\nwas these thinkers that came to be known as, and to call themselves,\npersonalists.\n\n\nThe philosophy of Friedrich W. Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) gave its\nown, distinct expression to these themes, showing, as many of the\nromantic poets and philosophers had done before him, and despite his\ncriticism of romanticism, that the new individualism was in reality\nclosely interrelated with the general impersonalism of the dominant\nstrain of romanticism: from the exaltation of the individualist ego,\nthe step was never far to its extinction in a larger impersonal whole\nof any of the many available varieties. Modern individualism\nrepresented no real challenge to the intellectual environment in which\nman tended to be seen as a mere phenomenal being, easily assimilated\ninto nature, the impersonal principle of idealism, the unconscious,\nthe cosmic will, or the collectivities of the family, the state, the\nnation, the social class.  Man was a product of external forces, an\ninsignificant piece in a cosmic puzzle, without dignity, freedom,\nresponsibility, or fundamental existential significance. It was this\noverall, many-faceted intellectual climate and development that\nproduced the personalist counter-movement throughout the nineteenth\ncentury, a movement which, by drawing on other, alternative resources\nin the thought of the Enlightenment and Romanticism as well as on the\nclassical, medieval Christian, and early modern legacy, sought to\nrescue the unique position and status of the singular human\nperson.\n\n\nThe personalist Jean Lacroix is justified in declaring personalism to be an\n\u201canti-ideology,\u201d awoken by social and political situations\nthat are alienating to the human person; in the face of such\nimpersonalist forces, personalism reaffirms the absolute dignity and\ninterrelationality of the human person. Maritain, too, wrote of\npersonalism as \u201ca phenomenon of reaction\u201d against the\n\u201ctwo opposite errors\u201d of totalitarianism and\nindividualism.  Contrary to Hegelian collectivism and the fierce\nindividualism of Nietzsche\u2019s superman, these thinkers stressed both\nthe inviolable dignity of the individual person and at the same time\nhis social nature and essential relationality.\n",
