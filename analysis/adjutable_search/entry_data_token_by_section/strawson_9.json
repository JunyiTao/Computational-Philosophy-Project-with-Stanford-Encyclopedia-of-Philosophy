    "main_text": "Some Themes in Strawson\u2019s Writings || Perception\n9.1 Perception\n\nStrawson made a major contribution to the theory of perception. His\nconception is articulated to some extent in The Bounds of\nSense, but also in a series of articles, of which the most famous\nis \u2018Perception and Its Objects\u2019 (1979). He suggests that\nthe concept of perception should be analysed as a causal concept. His\nversion of the causal theory differs in two main respects from that of\nGrice, who also famously defended a similar analysis. First,\nStrawson\u2019s argument for view turns on the idea that perception\nis essentially a method of acquiring knowledge; he suggests that this\nrequires that the concept of perception is a causal concept. Second,\nStrawson claims that Grice\u2019s attempt to spell out the right\ncausal chain by picking it out via examples is circular, and he\ninstead invokes notions of match and range. Strawson\u2019s version\nattracted considerable attention. More important is Strawson\u2019s\nclaim that there is no way to describe perceptual experience in terms\nwhich are not physical-object concept involving. That this can be\ndone, he thinks, is the crucial mistake of the traditional empiricist\nmodel, as represented, for example, in the thought of A. J. Ayer.\nAccording to Strawson we are not reading in or interpreting our\nexperiences when we respond to them by making objective judgements; we\nare simply endorsing their content. Strawson therefore holds that it\nis myth to suppose that we can locate a level of claim on the basis of\nwhich we can defend the validity of our application of physical object\nconcepts. Rather, our experience is \u2018saturated\u2019 by those\nconcepts themselves. In a more recent terminology, Strawson holds that\nperception involves the occurrence in us of experiences having\nobjective representational content, and that there can be\nhallucinations with a similar content but which are not properly\nperceptual because the complex causal requirements for being\nperceptual are not met. Strawson\u2019s claims about perception are\ndiscussed in Snowdon 1998.\n",
