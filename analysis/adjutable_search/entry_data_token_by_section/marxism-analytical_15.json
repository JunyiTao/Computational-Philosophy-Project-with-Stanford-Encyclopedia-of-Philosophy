    "main_text": "Socialism || Transition\n6. Overarching Criticisms\n\nThis entry already contains many examples of criticisms of particular\nauthors and particular arguments within analytical Marxism. However,\nthese were not typically targeted at the intellectual current as a\nwhole. Indeed, some were advanced from perspectives sympathetic to the\napproaches, concerns, and commitments, of analytical Marxism. However,\nthere are also less sympathetic critics willing to move beyond\nspecific authors and arguments, and issue a negative verdict on\nanalytical Marxism as such. These comprehensive criticisms are varied,\nbut might be grouped roughly according to which of the three sources\nand component parts of analytical Marxism forms their central\ntarget.\n\nA first group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the methodological\nclaims of analytical Marxism. The diversity of positive methodological\napproaches amongst analytical Marxists has been emphasised here, but\nthere remains a shared (negative) premise; namely, that there is no\ndistinct and valuable Marxist method. And there are critics\nwho\u2014holding that there is such a method, and that it is superior\nto the \u201cbourgeois\u201d tools adopted by analytical\nMarxism\u2014reject that premise. For example, they might maintain\nthat Marxism is necessarily committed to a \u201cdialectical\u201d\napproach\u2014sometimes based on a wider philosophy of\n\u201cinternal relations\u201d\u2014which analytical Marxists are\nbound to reject (Sayers 1984, 2015). Or, they might suggest that\n\u201canalytical\u201d and \u201cMarxist\u201d are rival\nmethodologies embodying a tension that can only be resolved fully by\none side routing the other; on this account, some September Group\nparticipants are portrayed as remaining true to their analytical\nmethods by slowly abandoning their Marxism (Roberts 1996: 14).\n\nA second group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the substantive\nconcerns of analytical Marxism. The critical suggestion here is\ntypically that in translating the substantive concerns of traditional\nMarxism into the language and frameworks of \u201cmainstream social\nscience\u201d, analytical Marxism has lost what was valuable about\nthem (Levine 2003: 123). For instance, it is suggested that analytical\nMarxism\u2019s treatment of exploitation, class, and history,\ninvolves an abstract, individualistic, and ahistorical, framework that\nmakes its conclusions hard to distinguish, in many respects, from the\ntheories of \u201cbourgeois social science\u201d (E. Wood 1989: 55).\nOr, in an another variant, that analytical Marxists seem to have lost\nsight of, or never really appreciated, the centrality of the\n\u201csystem of labour\u201d to Marx\u2019s substantive account of\nhuman society (Chitty 1998: 40).\n\nA third, and final, group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the\n\u201cnormative turn\u201d of analytical Marxism, reacting against\nthe suggestion that the predictive failures of classical Marxism might\nhave amplified the need for normative clarification and argument (G.\nCohen 2000a: 103\u20134). One variant insists that Marxism neither\nhas, nor needs, a normative theory. Marx is rather to be commended for\nholding that normative theory is pointless because it is\nmotivationally ineffective or unnecessary (Leiter 2002, 2015). Another\nvariant criticises the content, rather than the fact, of analytical\nMarxist commitment to normative theory. For instance, normatively\nspeaking, it suggests that analytical Marxism has increasingly\n\u201cfused and interpenetrated\u201d with left-liberalism, to a\npoint where it is difficult to tell them apart (Bertram 2007:\n137).\n\nThese comprehensive criticisms are not directly challenged here.\nHowever, there are reasons, at least, to hesitate before endorsing\nthem.\n\nFirst, it might simply be too early for comprehensive criticism.\nAttempts at the latter sometimes fail to consider that only a very\nprovisional assessment of analytical Marxism as a research programme\nmight be appropriate at this point. After all, many participants in\nthe first wave of analytical Marxism\u2014including Brenner, Roemer,\nand Van Parijs\u2014continue to produce significant and interesting\nwork. In addition, there are more recent contributions which offer the\npossibility of a constructive future development of the paradigm.\nConsider, for example, the \u201cAfro-analytical Marxism\u201d\noutlined and endorsed by Tommie Shelby (2021). Very roughly, Shelby\napproves of analytical Marxism\u2019s methodological combination of\nanalytical and empirical rigour, together with its substantive\ninterest in exploitation and ideology, but regrets\u2014and seeks to\nmake good\u2014its failure, both to theorise racism and racial\nhierarchy, and to examine the place of the black radical resistance in\nthe fight for social justice and a \u201cpost-capitalist\u201d\nfuture (2021, and Mills 2003: 155). More generally, the future of\nanalytical Marxism looks open; its research programme does not appear\nclosed to future development, nor has it been replaced decisively by a\ncompetitor. The intellectual merits of intellectual\ntraditions\u2014think of utilitarianism, for instance\u2014are not\nalways exhausted by one\u2019s judgement of the first group of\nauthors with whom they are associated. Simply put, it might be better\nto leave the full autopsy until the death of the patient is more\ncertain.\n\nSecond, some of these comprehensive criticisms might appear to be\nunproductively preoccupied with the Marxist credentials of\nanalytical Marxism. \u201cMarxism\u201d is treated stipulatively as\nan honorific, and then this analytical variant is located beyond the\npale\u2014exposed as not Marxist, or not Marxist enough, or not\nMarxist in the right kind of way, or even \u201canti-Marxist\u201d\n(Lebowitz 1988: 195; Hunt 1992: 105).) Of course, this issue\u2014of\nwhether, and to what extent, analytical Marxism is Marxist\u2014can\ntake a legitimate form. It might, for instance, form a step in a more\nsubstantive argument, or the context might be one in which proper\nlabelling is an appropriate concern (intellectual history, for\ninstance). However, in the absence of further argument, these\ncriticisms can appear to adopt an inappropriately\n\u201creligious\u201d approach to the evaluation of an ongoing\nresearch programme. Cohen expresses regret that, historically, it was\nthe label \u201cMarxism\u201d\u2014rather than, say, that of\n\u201cscientific socialism\u201d\u2014that came to be associated\nwith the relevant concerns and commitments. After all, it is typically\nreligions, rather than sciences, which are named after their founders.\nProgressive disciplines are not expected to preserve the\ntheses of their founders (G. Cohen 2000b: xxvii). We do not, for instance, ask\nphysicists whether they are still sufficiently Galilean (assuming, for\nthe sake of the example, that Galileo founded physics)?\n\nThird, and finally, some of these comprehensive criticisms look\nungenerous and one-sided, making little effort to consider the\npotential achievements here. More positively, analytical Marxism might\nbe said to have established itself as an intelligent and valuable form\nof \u201cEnlightenment Marxism\u201d. Its enthusiasm for clarity in,\ncareful elaboration of, and honesty about, arguments, constitute\ncontextually-important reminders of significant intellectual virtues.\nSubstantively, its evolving treatment of core Marxist\nconcerns\u2014including historical development, class, and\nexploitation\u2014reflect and confirm an openness to science, reason,\nand empirical evidence. As such, analytical Marxism recognises and\ncontinues certain valuable, and often neglected, elements of\nMarx\u2019s own thought (Little 1986). In addition, analytical\nMarxism aspires to advance our understanding of the social world\nwithout abandoning, or obscuring, or disparaging, the role of\nnormative theory. Finally, its rejection of Marx\u2019s\n\u201cutopophobia\u201d is well-founded, and its corresponding\nefforts to explore and promote alternatives to capitalism, in ways\nwhich balance the concerns of desirability and feasibility, are\nimaginative and thought-provoking. Analytical Marxism, it might be\nsuggested, rightly takes its place as one current of thought, in a\nwider radical stream, striving to understand social oppression, and to\ncontribute to its reduction and elimination (G. Cohen 2001: 14).\n",
