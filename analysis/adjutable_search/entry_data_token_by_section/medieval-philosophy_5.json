    "main_text": "Styles of Medieval Philosophy || Falsafa\n2.3 Falsafa\n\nThe abundant translations of Greek philosophical texts\n (\u00a71.3.1)\n made it possible for some thinkers in the Islamicate world themselves\nto engage in the Greek-style philosophizing they called\n falsafa.[11]\n Its exponents (fal\u0101sifa; sing. faylasuf) did\nnot, however, fit into the educational system, based around Islamic\nlaw. The earliest faylasuf was the prince and polymath\n al-Kind\u012b\n (c. 801\u201366), who was especially attracted to\u00a0Platonist\nmaterial. In the next century, a circle of Peripatetics, Muslim and\nChristian, flourished in Baghdad, dedicated to the close study and\nexegesis of Aristotle\u2019s texts. The most outstanding,\n al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\n (c. 870\u2013950/1), wrote shorter and longer commentaries on\nAristotle, including a discursive exposition of On\nInterpretation full of original thought about both semantics and\ndeterminism. Elsewhere, he provides a naturalistic account of the\norigins of language, philosophy and religion, and he championed the\nview, adopted by other faylasuf, that in their discipline\nthey provide demonstrative science (as described by Aristotle in the\nPosterior Analytics)\n (\u00a74.1).\n His view of the ideal state is clearly influenced by knowledge of\nPlato (through epitomes) and is linked to his conception of the order\nof the universe, which melds Proclus\u2019s theory of emanation from\nthe One with Ptolemean cosmology (see entries on\n al-Farabi\u2019s metaphysics,\n al-Farabi\u2019s psychology and epistemology,\n al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of logic and language,\n al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion).\n\nUnquestionably the most important faylasuf\u2014fundamental\nto the subsequent Arabic Islamic tradition, but highly influential too\non Jewish and Latin philosophy\u2014was\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n (before 980\u20131037; known in Latin as \u201cAvicenna\u201d, see\nentries on\n Ibn Sina\u2019s logic,\n Ibn Sina\u2019s metaphysics,\n Ibn Sina\u2019s natural philosophy).\n Avicenna was born in present-day Uzbekistan and spent his life in the\nEastern part of the Islamicate world, serving various princes in the\narea (he was also a renowned doctor and writer on medicine). He\ndistinguished his approach sharply from that of the\n\u201cWesterners\u201d, the Baghdad Peripatetics. Like them, he\nconsidered himself an Aristotelian. But whereas they sought to expound\nAristotle\u2019s texts line by line, Avicenna believed his genius\nallowed him to present the underlying truth in Aristotle\u2019s\nthought, by rearranging, rethinking and systematizing it. His output\nconsisted mostly, therefore, of philosophical encyclopaedias each\ncovering much of the range of Aristotle\u2019s work,\nlonger\u2014such as The Cure\u2014or shorter\u2014such as\nPointers and Reminders, the presentation most distant from\nAristotle\u2019s texts and most studied by his Arabic successors.\n\nFor Avicenna, as for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, God moves the universe\nnot just as final cause, but as that from which emanate the series of\nIntelligences and celestial spheres, down to the Agent Intellect,\ngiver of forms to our sublunar world and so assurer of the continued\nregularity of nature. His innovation was to identify this first cause\nas the one necessary being, that which is necessary through itself:\nits nature is to exist and so it cannot but exist. All other things\nare merely possible in themselves, but necessary through\nanother\u2014that is, through God, the necessary being. Since\nAvicenna\u2019s God, like that of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the\nPlatonists and Aristotle himself, is not a being that chooses and\nwills, his theory of necessity in itself and through another binds the\nwhole history of the universe to a very strict Principle of Sufficient\nReason.\n",
