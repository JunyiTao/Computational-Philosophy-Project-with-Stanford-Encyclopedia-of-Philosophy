    "main_text": "\n\n\nPerhaps no other classical philosophical tradition, East or West, \noffers a more complex and counter-intuitive account of mind and \nmental phenomena than Buddhism. While Buddhists share with other \nIndian philosophers the view that the domain of the mental \nencompasses a set of interrelated faculties and processes, they do \nnot associate mental phenomena with the activity of a substantial, \nindependent, and enduring self or agent. Rather, Buddhist theories of\nmind center on the doctrine of\n not-self[1]\n (P\u0101li anatta, \n Skt.[2]\nan\u0101tma), which postulates that human beings are \nreducible to the physical and psychological constituents and \nprocesses which comprise them.\n\n\nIndian Buddhist analyses of the mind span a period of some fifteen\ncenturies, from the earliest discourses of the Buddha (ca. 450 B.C.E.)\nto the systematic developments of late Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism\n(500\u20131000 C.E.). Although philosophical accounts of mind emerge\nonly within the Abhidharma scholastic traditions (roughly 150\nB.C.E. to 450 C.E.), their roots are found in the Buddha's teachings\nof the not-self doctrine. At the same time, these accounts parallel\nsimilar theoretical developments within the Brahmanical traditions,\nwith which they share a common philosophical vocabulary (and a general\nview of mental processes as hierarchical and discrete). This article\nfocuses on the picture of mind and mental phenomena that emerges from\nthe canonical literature, the theories of mind advanced by the main\nAbhidharma scholastic traditions, and the epistemological issues of\nperception and intentionality debated by philosophers such as\nVasubandhu, Dign\u0101ga, Dharmak\u012brti, Candrak\u012brti,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, and Dharmottara.\n\n\nAll references to the canonical literature are to the major \ncollections of texts in the P\u0101li Canon, primarily to the \nLong, Middle, and Connected Discourses of \nthe Buddha (the D\u012bgha, Majjhima, and \nSa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101yas respectively). For the\nAbhidharmic account of mind and related phenomena I draw almost\nexclusively from Vasubandhu's Treasury of Higher Knowledge\n(Abhidharmako\u015ba and its bh\u0101\u1e63ya;\nhereafter AKBh), a foundational text for most of the philosophical\ndevelopments of late Indian Buddhism.
