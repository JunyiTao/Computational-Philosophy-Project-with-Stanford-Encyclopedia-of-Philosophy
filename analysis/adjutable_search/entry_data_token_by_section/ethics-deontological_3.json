    "main_text": "Deontological Theories || Patient-Centered Deontological Theories\n2.2 Patient-Centered Deontological Theories\n\nA second group of deontological moral theories can be classified, as\npatient-centered, as distinguished from the\nagent-centered version of deontology just considered. These\ntheories are rights-based rather than duty-based; and some versions\npurport to be quite agent-neutral in the reasons they give moral\nagents.\n\nAll patient-centered deontological theories are properly characterized\nas theories premised on people\u2019s rights. An illustrative version\nposits, as its core right, the right against being used only as means\nfor producing good consequences without one\u2019s consent. Such a\ncore right is not to be confused with more discrete rights, such as\nthe right against being killed, or being killed intentionally. It is a\nright against being used by another for the user\u2019s or\nothers\u2019 benefit.  More specifically, this version of\npatient-centered deontological theories proscribes the using\nof another\u2019s body, labor, and talent without the latter\u2019s\nconsent. One finds this notion expressed, albeit in different ways, in\nthe work of the so-called Right Libertarians (e.g., Robert Nozick,\nEric Mack), but also in the works of the Left-Libertarians as well\n(e.g., Michael Otsuka, Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne) (Nozick 1974;\nMack 2000; Steiner 1994; Vallentyne and Steiner 2000; Vallentyne,\nSteiner, and Otsuka 2005). On this view, the scope of strong moral\nduties\u2014those that are the correlatives of others\u2019\nrights\u2014is jurisdictionally limited and does not extend to\nresources for producing the Good that would not exist in the absence\nof those intruded upon\u2014that is, their bodies, labors, and\ntalents. In addition to the Libertarians, others whose views include\nthis prohibition on using others include Quinn, Kamm, Alexander,\nFerzan, Gauthier, and Walen (Quinn 1989; Kamm 1996; Alexander 2016;\nAlexander and Ferzan 2009, 2012; Gauthier 1986; Walen 2014, 2016).\n\nJust as do agent-centered theories, so too do patient-centered\ntheories (such as that forbidding the using of another) seek to\nexplain common intuitions about such classic hypothetical cases as\nTrolley and Transplant (or Fat Man) (Thomson 1985). In Trolley, a\nrunaway trolley will kill five workers unless diverted to a siding\nwhere it will kill one worker. Most people regard it as permissible\nand perhaps mandatory to switch the trolley to the siding. By\ncontrast, in Transplant, where a surgeon can kill one healthy patient\nand transplant his organs to five dying patients, thereby saving their\nlives, the universal reaction is condemnation. (The same is\nby-and-large true in Fat Man, where the runaway trolley cannot be\nswitched off the main track but can be stopped before reaching the\nfive workers by pushing a fat man into its path, resulting in his\ndeath.)\n\nThe injunction against using arguably accounts for these contrasting\nreactions. After all, in each example, one life is sacrificed to save\nfive. Yet there appears to be a difference in the means through which\nthe net four lives are saved. In Transplant (and Fat Man), the doomed\nperson is used to benefit the others. They could not be saved in the\nabsence of his body. In Trolley, on the other hand, the doomed victim\nis not used. The workers would be saved whether or not he is present\non the second track.\n\nNotice, too, that this patient-centered libertarian version of\ndeontology handles Trolley, Transplant et al. differently from how\nthey are handled by agent-centered versions. The latter focus on the\nagent\u2019s mental state or on whether the agent acted or caused the\nvictim\u2019s harm. The patient-centered theory focuses instead on\nwhether the victim\u2019s body, labor, or talents were the means by\nwhich the justifying results were produced. So one who realizes that\nby switching the trolley he can save five trapped workers and place\nonly one in mortal danger\u2014and that the danger to the latter is\nnot the means by which the former will be saved\u2014acts permissibly\non the patient-centered view if he switches the trolley even if he\ndoes so with the intention of killing the one worker. Switching\nthe trolley is causally sufficient to bring about the consequences\nthat justify the act\u2014the saving of net four\nworkers\u2014and it is so even in the absence of the one\nworker\u2019s body, labor, or talents. (The five would be saved\nif the one escaped, was never on the track, or did not exist.) By\ncontrast, on the intent and intended action versions of agent-centered\ntheories, the one who switches the trolley does not act\npermissibly if he acts with the intention to harm the one\nworker. (This could be the case, for example, when the one who\nswitches the trolley does so to kill the one whom he hates, only\nknowing that he will thereby save the other five workmen.) On the\npatient-centered version, if an act is otherwise morally justifiable\nby virtue of its balance of good and bad consequences, and the good\nconsequences are achieved without the necessity of using\nanyone\u2019s body, labor, or talents without that person\u2019s\nconsent as the means by which they are achieved, then it is morally\nimmaterial (to the permissibility of the act but not to\nthe culpability of the actor) whether someone undertakes that\nact with the intention to achieve its bad consequences. (This is true,\nof course, only so long as the concept of using does not\nimplicitly refer to the intention of the user) (Alexander 2016).  And\nin assessing the culpability of risky conduct, any good consequences\nmust be discounted, not only by the perceived risk that they will not\noccur, but also by the perceived risk that they will be brought about\nby a using; for any such consequences, however good they otherwise\nare, cannot be considered in determining the permissibility and,\nderivatively, the culpability of acts (Alexander 2016).\n\nPatient-centered deontologists handle differently other stock examples\nof the agent-centered deontologist. Take the acceleration cases as an\nexample. When all will die in a lifeboat unless one is killed and\neaten; when Siamese twins are conjoined such that both will die unless\nthe organs of one are given to the other via an operation that kills\nthe first; when all of a group of soldiers will die unless the body of\none is used to hold down the enemy barbed wire, allowing the rest to\nsave themselves; when a group of villagers will all be shot by a\nblood-thirsty tyrant unless they select one of their numbers to slake\nthe tyrants lust for death\u2014in all such cases, the\ncausing/accelerating-distinguishing agent-centered deontologists would\npermit the killing but the usings-focused patient-centered\ndeontologist would not. (For the latter, all killings are merely\naccelerations of death.)\n\nThe restriction of deontological duties to usings of another\nraises a sticky problem for those patient-centered deontological\ntheories that are based on the core right against using: how can they\naccount for the prima facie wrongs of killing, injuring, and\nso forth when done not to use others as means, but for some other\npurpose or for no purpose at all? The answer is that such\npatient-centered deontological constraints must be supplemented by\nconsequentialist-derived moral norms to give an adequate account of\nmorality. Killing, injuring, and so forth will usually be\nunjustifiable on a consequentialist calculus, especially if everyone\u2019s\ninterests are given equal regard. It is when killing and injuring are\notherwise justifiable that the deontological constraint against using\nhas its normative bite over and against what is already prohibited by\nconsequentialism. (This narrowness of patient-centered deontology\nmakes it counterintuitive to agent-centered deontologists, who regard\nprohibitions on killing of the innocent, etc., as paradigmatically\ndeontological.)\n\nThe patient-centered version of deontology is aptly labeled\nlibertarian in that it is not plausible to conceive of not being aided\nas being used by the one not aiding. Using is an action, not a failure\nto act. More generally, it is counterintuitive to many to think that\nany of us have a right to be aided. For if there were a\nstrong (that is, enforceable or coercible) duty to aid others, such\nthat, for example, A had a duty to aid X,\nY, and Z; and if A could more effectively\naid X, Y, and Z by coercing B and\nC to aid them (as is their duty), then A\nwould have a duty to \u201cuse\u201d B and C in\nthis way. For these reasons, any positive duties will not be\nrights-based ones on the view here considered; they will be\nconsequentially-justified duties that can be trumped by the right not\nto be coerced to perform them.\n\nPatient-centered deontological theories are often conceived in\nagent-neutral reason-giving terms. John has a right to the exclusive\nuse of his body, labor, and talents, and such a right gives everyone\nequal reason to do actions respecting it. But this aspect of\npatient-centered deontological theories gives rise to a particularly\nvirulent form of the so-called paradox of deontology (Scheffler 1988;\nHeuer 2011)\u2014that if respecting Mary\u2019s and Susan\u2019s\nrights is as important morally as is protecting John\u2019s rights,\nthen why isn\u2019t violating John\u2019s rights permissible (or\neven obligatory) when doing so is necessary to protect Mary\u2019s\nand Susan\u2019s rights from being violated by others?\nPatient-centered deontological theories might arguably do better if\nthey abandoned their pretense of being agent-neutral. They could\nconceive of rights as giving agent-relative reasons to each actor to\nrefrain from doing actions violative of such rights. Take the core\nright against being used without one\u2019s consent hypothesized\nearlier. The correlative duty is not to use another without his\nconsent. If such duty is agent-relative, then the rights-based\ndeontologist (no less than the agent-centered deontologist) has the\nconceptual resources to answer the paradox of deontology. That is,\neach of us may not use John, even when such using of John would\nminimize usings of John by others in the future. Such duties are\npersonal to each of us in that we may not justify our violating such a\nduty now by preventing others\u2019 similar violations in the\nfuture. Such personal duties are agent-centered in the sense that the\nagency of each person is central to the duties of each person, so that\nyour using of another now cannot be traded off against other\npossible usings at other times by other people.\n\nPatient-centered deontologies are thus arguably better construed to be\nagent-relative in the reasons they give. Even so construed, such\ndeontologies join agent-centered deontologies in facing the moral\n(rather than the conceptual) versions of the paradox of deontology.\nFor a critic of either form of deontology might respond to the\ncategorical prohibition about using others as follows: If usings are\nbad, then are not more usings worse than fewer? And if so, then is it\nnot odd to condemn acts that produce better states of affairs than\nwould occur in their absence? Deontologists of either stripe can just\ndeny that wrong acts on their account of wrongness can be translated\ninto bad states of affairs. Two wrong acts are not \u201cworse\u201d\nthan one. Such wrongs cannot be summed into anything of normative\nsignificance. After all, the victim of a rights-violating using may\nsuffer less harm than others might have suffered had his rights not\nbeen violated; yet one cannot, without begging the question against\ndeontological constraints, argue that therefore no constraint should\nblock minimizing harm. That is, the deontologist might reject the\ncomparability of states of affairs that involve violations and those\nthat do not. Similarly, the deontologist may reject the comparability\nof states of affairs that involve more or fewer rights-violations\n(Brook 2007). The deontologist might attempt to back this assertion by\nrelying upon the separateness of persons. Wrongs are only wrongs to\npersons. A wrong to Y and a wrong to Z cannot be\nadded to make some greater wrong because there is no person who\nsuffers this greater wrong (cf. Taurek 1977).\n\nThis solution to the paradox of deontology, may seem attractive, but\nit comes at a high cost. In Trolley, for example, where there is\nneither agency nor using in the relevant senses and thus no bar to\nswitching, one cannot claim that it is better to switch and save the\nfive. For if the deaths of the five cannot be summed, their deaths are\nnot worse than the death of the one worker on the siding. Although\nthere is no deontological bar to switching, neither is the saving of a\nnet four lives a reason to switch. Worse yet, were the trolley heading\nfor the one worker rather than the five, there would be no reason not\nto switch the trolley, so a net loss of four lives is no reason not to\nswitch the trolley. If the numbers don\u2019t count, they seemingly don\u2019t\ncount either way.\n\nThe problem of how to account for the significance of numbers without\ngiving up deontology and adopting consequentialism, and without\nresurrecting the paradox of deontology, is one that a number of\ndeontologists are now working to solve (e.g., Kamm 1996; Scanlon 2003;\nOtsuka 2006, Hsieh et al. 2006). Until it is solved, it will remain a\nhuge thorn in the deontologist\u2019s side.\n",
