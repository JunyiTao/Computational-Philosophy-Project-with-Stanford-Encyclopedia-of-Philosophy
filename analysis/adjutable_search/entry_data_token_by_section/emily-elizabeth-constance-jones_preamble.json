    "main_text": "\n\nEmily Elizabeth Constance Jones (1848\u20131922), a contemporary of\nBertrand Russell and G. E. Moore at Cambridge University, worked\nprimarily in philosophical logic and ethics. Her most significant\ncontribution to the former area is her application of the\nintension-extension distinction to singular terms, anticipating\nFrege\u2019s related distinction between sense and reference and\nRussell\u2019s pre-\u201cOn Denoting\u201d distinction between\nmeaning and denotation. Widely regarded as an authority on\nphilosophical logic by figures as diverse as F. C. S. Schiller and G.\nF. Stout on the one hand and C. S. Peirce on the other, Jones appeared\nin published symposia alongside such eminent contemporaries as W. E.\nJohnson and Bernard Bosanquet and became, in 1896, the first woman to\npresent a paper at the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club. Her major\npublication, A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearings,\npublished in 1911 by Cambridge University Press, contained an\nenthusiastic preface by Stout and was received favorably in\nMind, where the reviewer, Schiller, remarked: \u201cMiss\nJones has made a great discovery.\u201d In the same year, Russell\ndelivered a paper to the Moral Sciences Club, subsequently published\nas \u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription\u201d, responding to a critical paper by Jones, delivered\nto the same society some months earlier. In ethics, Jones was well\nknown as a defender and expositor of the views of her teacher and\nmentor, Henry Sidgwick. (Sidgwick regarded Jones as one of his prize\nstudents.) Yet, despite the fact that she published numerous articles,\na monograph and several textbooks (some going into multiple editions),\nand was a very visible member of the English philosophical community\nfrom the 1890s until her death in 1922, she is now almost entirely\nforgotten.\n\nFollowing a biographical sketch (section 1), sections 2\u20136 focus on\nJones\u2019s work in philosophical logic\u2014in particular, her law\nof significant assertion and her criticisms of Russell; section 7 is\ndevoted to Jones\u2019s contributions to ethical theory. A closing\nsection provides a brief survey of women\u2019s contributions to\nearly analytic philosophy.\n",
