Kinds of Moral Assessment\n\nThe Control Principle states that we are morally assessable only to\nthe extent that what we are morally assessed for is under our control.\nBut it is important to recognize that there are many different kinds\nof moral assessment. For example, there are judgments about a\nperson\u2019s character, for example, as \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cbad\u201d (sometimes called \u201caretaic\u201d judgments).\nThere are also judgments of states of affairs that concern\npeople\u2019s actions as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d\n(sometimes called \u201caxiological\u201d judgments. Then there are\njudgments of actions as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d\n(sometimes called \u201cdeontic\u201d judgments). There are also\njudgments of responsibility, blame, and praise. As we will see, this\ncategory can be further divided in various ways.\n\nDistinguishing between the various notions of moral assessment allows\nfor the possibility that the Control Principle should be read as\napplying to some, but not to other forms of moral assessment. For\nexample, some argue that there is a perfectly acceptable form of moral\nluck which does not conflict with the true spirit of the Control\nPrinciple, namely, luck in what you are responsible for\n(e.g., Richards 1986, Zimmerman 2002). For example, it will be readily\nadmitted by many that the successful murderer can be responsible for a\ndeath, whereas the one who unsuccessfully attempts murder is not\nresponsible for a death. At the same time, both could be\nequally responsible, or blameworthy, in degree (Zimmerman\n2002, 560) or both could be equal in their moral worth (Richards 1986,\n171, Greco 1995, 91). If the most important kind of moral assessment\nis, say, one\u2019s moral worth, then the Control Principle can be\nsuitably restricted to apply to assessments of moral worth. As will\nbecome clear, a number of responses to the problem of moral luck\nappeal to the general strategy of distinguishing among different forms\nof moral assessment. Most focus on two families of moral assessment:\n(i) the family that includes responsibility, blame, and praise for\nactions and/or for one\u2019s own traits or dispositions, and (ii)\nthe family that includes the notion of the moral worth of an agent and\nthe moral quality of her character. (But see Zimmerman 2006 for a\nrecent discussion of luck and deontic judgments.)\n",
