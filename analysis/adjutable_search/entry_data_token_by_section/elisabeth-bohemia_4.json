    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes || Provenance\n4.1 Provenance\n\nWhile many of Descartes\u2019s letters to Elisabeth were published in the\nvolumes of his correspondence edited by Clerselier after his death,\nElisabeth refused Pierre Chanut\u2019s request to publish her side of the\nexchange. Elisabeth\u2019s side of the correspondence was first published\nin a volume by A. Foucher de Careil, after he was alerted to its\nexistence by an antiquarian bookseller, Frederick M\u00fcller, who had\nfound a packet of letters in Rosendael, outside Arnhem. These same\nletters are what appear in the Oeuvres of Descartes, edited\nby Charles Adam and Paul Tannery. The letters from Rosendael are not\noriginals, but rather copies that date from the early 18th century.\nWhile we do not know the provenance of the copies, the consistency of\ntheir content with that of Descartes\u2019s letters, along with allusions\nto events in Elisabeth\u2019s family and private life, argues strongly in\nfavor of the authenticity of the copies.\n",
