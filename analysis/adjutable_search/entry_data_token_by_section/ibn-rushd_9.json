    "main_text": "Ethics and Politics\n8. Ethics and Politics\n\nThe sciences, for Ibn Rushd, fundamentally divide into the theoretical\n(na\u1e93ar\u012bya), which is aimed at knowledge\n(\u02bfilm), and the practical (\u02bfamal\u012bya),\nwhich is concerned with voluntary action (Republic I.21;\nLongPhys proem). The chief practical science is politics,\nwhich Ibn Rushd sees as dividing, much like medicine, into a more\ntheoretical and a more practical part. The first and more theoretical\npart examines voluntary actions in general, their associated\ndispositions (the virtues and vices), and the relationships between\nthese elements. The second, more practical part examines how these\ndispositions become established within souls and how they are\nperfected and impeded (Republic I.21). The first part is\nfound in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, and the second\npart in his Politics. Although Ibn Rushd composed a\ncommentary on the first of these, and although he knew the second was\navailable in Arabic elsewhere, he complains that it \u201chas not yet\nreached us on this peninsula\u201d (ParaEthics X.160G).\nAccordingly, he chose to comment on Plato\u2019s Republic as\nan alternative source for the second part of political science.\n\nFollowing the Nicomachean Ethics, Ibn Rushd takes the goal of\nhuman life to be happiness (Hourani 1962). For ordinary people, the\nultimate guide to happiness is the Qur\u02be\u0101n, which exhibits\nmiraculous wisdom in the rules it sets out to promote human\nflourishing (see \u00a76.1). But the ultimate human happiness, for\nthose who are capable of it, is to become perfect in the theoretical\nsciences (LongPhys proem). Such perfection arrives when human\nbeings conjoin themselves to the separate Agent Intellect, which is to\nsay that they pass from a partial conception of intelligible objects\nto a conception of the Agent Intellect itself. At this point a human\nbeing in some sense takes on an \u201ceternal existence\u201d\n(PossibConj 5.41; LongPhys proem), and is\n\u201cmade like unto God\u201d (LongAnima III.36 {501}),\nand even \u201cbecomes one of the eternal, incorporeal beings\u201d\n(PossibConj 5.40). This notion of conjunction\n(itti\u1e63\u0101l) had a complex history among earlier\nAristotelians, and Ibn Rushd\u2019s views about what it involves, and\nwhether it is possible, developed over time (Davidson 1992,\n321\u201356; Black 1999). The texts here are complicated, but suggest\nthat he rejected al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s complaint that\nconjunction is nothing other than \u201can old woman\u2019s\ntale\u201d (PossibConj 14.85; Epistle 1 par. 40),\nand that he accepted it as, in some sense, the goal of human life, one\nthat would be achieved through contemplation, with the assistance of\nprayer and the Qur\u02be\u0101n (PossibConj\n15.103\u20134).\n\nA perfect, conjoined grasp of the theoretical sciences carries with\nit, necessarily, the complete possession of the moral virtues. One so\npossessed will be perfect both in intellectual understanding and in\n\u201cthe activity proper to him\u201d (LongAnima III.36\n{500, 501}). If this sort of moral excellence is not much on display\nin those we see make the greatest claims to the possession of science,\nthis only testifies to the poverty of their achievements\n(LongPhys proem). The perfection Ibn Rushd describes,\nhowever, through conjunction with the Agent Intellect, seems to entail\nsomething other than personal immortality. For he expressly refuses,\nagainst al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, to endorse bodily resurrection\n(Incoherence II.4 {580\u20136}), and yet he also insists\nthat the human soul is individuated in virtue of its body. So, as he\nexplicitly concludes, \u201cif the soul does not die when the body\ndies, or if there is anything of this kind within the soul, then it\nmust, once it has left the bodies, be one in number\u201d\n(Incoherence I.1 {29}). So\u2014although scholarship is not\nunanimous on this point\u2014it seems that Ibn Rushd, whatever he\nmight have thought about conjunction, did not mean for the promise of\nthe soul\u2019s immortality to extend to each of us as\nindividuals (Taylor 1998).\n\nJust as the theoretical part of medicine has as its aim the more\npractical business of preserving health and curing disease, so too, in\nthe political sphere, the first part has as its end the perfection of\nthe second part. This is to say that the goal of ethical inquiry is\nultimately \u201cthe governance of cities\u201d (ParaEthics\nI.3, 3F). This instrumental conception of ethics looks strange from\nthe perspective of later European philosophy, but it is what Aristotle\nhimself expressly affirms at Nicomachean Ethics I.2, and it\ncomports well with Ibn Rushd\u2019s orientation away from individual\nhuman beings as the ultimate locus of value in the universe.\n\nFrom the start, Ibn Rushd announces that the goal of his commentary on\nthe Republic will be to strip away the parts that are merely\ndialectical, so as to identify the claims that achieve the level of\ndemonstrative science (Republic I.21). Accordingly, he\nattends very selectively to the ten books that comprise Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, dispensing entirely with the first and tenth books\nand the first half of the second book, and merging the rest into three\nbooks. The first presents political science and reflects on the\ncomponents of the virtuous city, especially the guards. The second\nconsiders virtuous governments and the qualities of the ruler of the\nvirtuous city and the philosopher. The third is devoted to\nnon-virtuous governments, comparisons between them, and the transition\nfrom one to another.\n\nThe Platonic text is subjected to two parallel frameworks. The first\nis Aristotelian, both in its overarching theoretical\nframework\u2014replacing the dialectical and dialogical character of\nthe Platonic text with Aristotle\u2019s ethical and logical framework\n(Butterworth 1986)\u2014and in its particular details, as when Ibn\nRushd emphasizes the role of logic rather than mathematics in the\ntraining of the guards and the ruler of the virtuous city\n(Republic II.76\u20137). The second is the contextualization\nof this text in the Islamic and Andalusian environment. Ibn Rushd\ntakes the Umayyad, Almoravid, and Almohad dynasties as examples of\nmany of the issues he deals with in the text, and harshly criticizes\nthe current Almohad reign (e.g., Republic III.103) as well as\nthe position of the philosopher at the time, which he compares to\nbeing surrounded by ferocious monsters (Republic II.64). This\ncritical attitude is particularly notable when he discusses how women,\nsharing the same natures as men, are suited to the same activities,\nfit to serve as guardians, philosophers, and rulers. Yet, as things\nare, these capacities are not fostered: \u201csince women in these\ncities are not prepared with respect to any of the human virtues, they\nfrequently resemble plants. Their being a burden upon the men in these\ncities is one of the causes of poverty\u201d (Republic\nI.54).\n\nIt is clear that Ibn Rushd comments on the Republic only for\nlack of Aristotle\u2019s superior work. At the end of his paraphrase\non the Nicomachean Ethics, he describes the shortcomings in\nPlato\u2019s treatise, and criticizes Ibn B\u0101jja for having\njudged the Republic as the perfect treatise on the virtuous\ncity. What is less clear is exactly what Ibn Rushd\u2019s own textual\nsources were. Did he deal directly with Plato\u2019s text, with the\nassistance of Galen, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, and Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric? Or was the Platonic text not in his hands, which\nmeans that he was commenting on Galen\u2019s Compendium on\nPlato\u2019s Politics, with the help of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nand Aristotle? While the use of Aristotle\u2019s and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s texts is clear, the question of his\naccess to Plato remains obscure (Mahdi 2016).\n",
