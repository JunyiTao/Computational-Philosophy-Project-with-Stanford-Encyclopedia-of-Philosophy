    "main_text": "Origins of the Universe || Puzzling Features of the Initial State\n3.3 Puzzling Features of the Initial State\n\nIn practice, cosmologists often take the physical state at the\nexpected boundary of the domain of applicability of GR as the\n\u201cinitial state\u201d. (For example, this might be taken as the\nstate specified on a spatial hypersurface at a very early cosmic time.\nHowever, the domain of applicability of GR is not well understood,\ngiven uncertainty about quantum gravity.) Projecting observed features\nof the universe backwards leads to an initial state with three\npuzzling\n features:[35]\n\n\nUniformity: The FLRW models have a finite particle\nhorizon distance, much smaller than the scales at which we observe the\n CMB.[36]\n Yet the isotropy of the CMB, among other observations, indicate that\ndistant regions of the universe have uniform physical properties.\nFlatness: An FLRW model close to the \u201cflat\u201d\nmodel, with nearly critical density at some specified early time is\ndriven rapidly away from critical density under FLRW dynamics if\n\\(\\Lambda = 0\\) and \\(\\rho+3p>0\\). Given later observations, the\ninitial state has to be very close to the flat model (or,\nequivalently, very close to critical density, \\(\\Omega=1\\))\nat very early\n times.[37]\n\nPerturbations: The SM includes density perturbations that\nare coherent on large scales and have a specific amplitude,\nconstrained by observations. It is challenging to explain both\nproperties dynamically. In the standard FLRW models, the perturbations\nhave to be coherent on scales much larger than the Hubble radius at\nearly\n times.[38]\n\n\n\nOn a more phenomenological approach, the gravitational degrees of\nfreedom of the initial state could simply be chosen to fit with later\nobservations, but many proposed \u201ctheories of initial\nconditions\u201d aim to account for these features based on new\nphysical principles. The theory of inflation discussed below aims to\nexplain these issues.\n",
