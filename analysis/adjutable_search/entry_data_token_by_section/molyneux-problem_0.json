    "main_text": "Molyneux\u2019s Formulation of the Problem\n1. Molyneux\u2019s Formulation of the Problem\n\nAs is apparent from both his writings and his lectures, Molyneux was\nhighly interested in optics and in the psychology of sight. To some\nextent this simply reflects the general attitude of his time: optics\nwas a subject that was then engaging the attention of a number of\nleading scientists. His interest also had a more personal background,\nhowever, for his wife had lost her sight in the first year of their\nmarriage. The immediate cause of his formulating the problem and\nsending it to Locke is to be found in Locke\u2019s French extract of\nAn Essay Concerning Humane Understanding, published in 1688\nin the Biblioth\u00e8que Universelle & Historique. In\nthis extract Locke distinguished between ideas we acquire by means of\none sense and those we acquire by means of more than one sense. He\nmaintained that someone who lacks a sense will never be able to\nacquire the ideas pertaining to it. A blind man, for example, will\nnever be able to have any idea of colour. Among the ideas we are able\nto acquire by means of a combination of senses, Locke reckoned those\nof space, rest, motion and figure. Molyneux\u2019s problem had to do\nwith the last of these. Molyneux was probably inspired by\nLocke\u2019s exposition of the ideas of persons born blind and the\nideas which can be acquired by means of both sight and touch. He was,\nmoreover, a great admirer of Locke. (Although earlier we suggested\nthat Molyneux might have been inspired by Ibn Tufail\u2019s\ntwelfth-century philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, which\nhad just been published in Latin (1671) and English (1674) and also\nhad an influence on Locke, there seems to be no indication that\nMolyneux read Ibn\n Tufail.)[1]\n\nOn Saturday 7 July 1688 William Molyneux wrote a letter to John Locke\nsetting out for the first time his problem concerning the person born\nblind:\n\n\nDublin July. 7. 88\n\nA Problem Proposed to the Author of the Essai Philosophique\nconcernant L\u2019Entendement \n\nA Man, being born blind, and having a Globe and a Cube, nigh of the\nsame bignes, Committed into his Hands, and being taught or Told, which\nis Called the Globe, and which the Cube, so as easily to distinguish\nthem by his Touch or Feeling; Then both being taken from Him, and Laid\non a Table, Let us Suppose his Sight Restored to Him; Whether he\nCould, by his Sight, and before he touch them, know which is the Globe\nand which the Cube? Or Whether he Could know by his Sight, before he\nstretch\u2019d out his Hand, whether he Could not Reach them, tho\nthey were Removed 20 or 1000 feet from Him?\n\nIf the Learned and Ingenious Author of the Forementiond Treatise think\nthis Problem Worth his Consideration and Answer, He may at any time\nDirect it to One that Much Esteems him, and is,\n\nHis Humble Servant\n\nWilliam Molyneux\n\nHigh Ormonds Gate in Dublin. Ireland\n\n\nFor reasons unknown Locke never replied to the letter. However, a\ncouple of years later, after the two men had started an amicable\ncorrespondence, Molyneux returned to his problem. This time with\nsuccess. In his letter, dated 2 March 1693, Molyneux presented Locke\nwith his problem, though in a somewhat altered form, asking Locke if\nhe could perhaps find some place in his Essay to say\nsomething about it. This time Locke reacted with enthusiasm:\n\u201cYour ingenious problem will deserve to be published to the\nworld.\u201d From the second edition of his Essay (that of\n1694) Locke included Molyneux\u2019s problem in his work and thereby\nmade it accessible to a wider audience:\n\nSuppose a Man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to\ndistinguish between a Cube, and a Sphere of the same metal, and nighly\nof the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and\nt\u2019other; which is the Cube, which the Sphere. Suppose then the\nCube and Sphere placed on a Table, and the Blind Man to be made to\nsee. Quaere, Whether by his sight, before he touch\u2019d them, he\ncould now distinguish, and tell, which is the Globe, which the Cube.\n\n\nIn this formulation Molyneux\u2019s problem attracted the attention\nof lots of philosophers and other men of learning, such as Berkeley,\nLeibniz, Voltaire, Diderot, La Mettrie, Helmholtz and William\nJames. In which ways did they approach the problem?\n",
