    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality || Which is the real distinction?\n2.5 Which is the real distinction?\n\nIn the last three subsections, we distinguished a number of distinct\nnotions that are characterised by Lewis\u2019s three\ncharacterisation: locality, duplication preservation, and several\ndifferent kinds of interiority. We now need to address the question of\nwhether there is a single notion of intrinsicality, and, if there is,\nwhich of these notions is it? More precisely, we need to determine\nwhether there is a single notion that philosophers typically use\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express, and, if so, which notion is\nit.\n\nOne might attempt to answer this question by first noting that it is\nmuch more common for philosophers to use Lewis\u2019s second\n\u201cin virtue\u201d characterisation (or some variant of it), than\neither of the other two characterisations when explaining what they\nmean by \u2018intrinsic\u2019. (For example, as far as we know,\nLewis uses the \u201cin virtue\u201d characterisation whenever he\nexplains what he means by \u2018intrinsic\u2019, but only uses the\nother characterisations once.) This suggests that philosophers\ntypically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express a notion of\ninteriority rather than either of the notions of locality or\nduplication preservation.\n\nGiven philosophers typically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express\nsome notion of interiority, there are several reasons to think that\nthe notion of interiority they typically express is that of identity\ninteriority. First, identity interiority is more fundamental, or\nsimpler, than the other notions of interiority, and philosophers are\noften interested in employing more fundamental notions than less\nfundamental notions. Second, the intrinsic properties of a thing\nshould be the properties that thing has \u201cin itself\u201d,\nrather than merely the properties that are metaphysically\nnecessitated, or nomically necessitated, or metaphysically explained,\nby the properties the thing has \u201cin itself\u201d. But this\nsuggests that the intrinsic properties should be the identity interior\nproperties, rather than the metaphysical necessitation interior\nproperties, or the nomic necessitation interior properties, or the\nweak grounding interior properties. Finally, while the identity\ninteriority of necessarily coextensive properties can intuitively\ndiffer, this is not true for at least some of the other notions of\ninteriority, such as metaphysical necessitation interiority and nomic\nnecessitation interiority. (Properties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are necessarily\ncoextensive iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) iff \\(x\\)\nhas \\(q\\).) Since it is a widespread intuition that necessarily\ncoextensive properties can differ in whether they are intrinsic, this\nsuggests these other notions of interiority aren\u2019t what\nphilosophers typically express by \u2018intrinsic\u2019. (This last\nreason also provides a further reason to think that duplication\npreservation isn\u2019t the notion of intrinsicality philosophers\ntypically employ, since it also does not differ among necessarily\nequivalent properties.)\n\nThere are therefore reasons to think that the notion philosophers\ntypically use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express is identity\ninteriority. These reasons, however, are not decisive. First,\nphilosophers often take intrinsic properties to be qualitative, and\nuse \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to distinguish only among qualitative\nproperties. (See Sider 1996.) Since each local property and each\nduplication preserving property is qualitative, but this is not true\nfor interior properties, this possibly suggests that at least some\nphilosophers at least some of the time use \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to\nexpress either locality or duplication preservation. Secondly, while\nidentity interiority can do much of the theoretical work\nintrinsicality is meant to do, it arguably cannot do all of it, with\nsome of this work being better done by some of the other notions of\nintrinsicality described above. For example, Sider (1996) has argued\nthat duplication preservation is better able to be used to define\nindividualism about mental states than identity interiority. Finally,\nthe failure of many philosophers to clearly distinguish which notion\nof intrinsicality they are employing provides at least some reason to\nsuspect that those philosophers have often used\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 indeterminately to express a multiplicity of\nnotions of intrinsicality.\n\nAn alternative view has been put forward by Plate 2018, who has argued\nthat there is a single notion of intrinsicality and that none of the\nnotions discussed above correspond to it. Plate points out that, on\neach of the alleged notions of intrinsicality discussed above, either\nthe property of having Paris as a part is classified as non-intrinsic\nor the uninstantiable property of being such that Socrates is\nnon-self-identical is classified as intrinsic. Plate then argues that,\nsince having Paris as a part is intrinsic while being such that\nSocrates is non-self-identical is non-intrinsic, it follows that none\nof the above notions is intrinsicality. A response to Plate\u2019s\nargument is given by Marshall 2021, who argues that there is no notion\nof intrinsicality on which these properties are respectively intrinsic\nand non-intrinsic. Instead, according to this response, there are only\nnotions of intrinsicality on which either both are intrinsic or both\nare non-intrinsic.\n\nIn the next section, we will consider a number of attempts to analyse\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019. Unless otherwise made clear, we will use\n\u2018intrinsic\u2019 to express identity interiority, and we will\nassume that identity interiority is the most dominant notion of\nintrinsicality employed by philosophers. As we will see, however, a\nnumber of these attempts are most charitably seen as attempts to\nanalyse notions of intrinsicality other than identity interiority.\n",
