    "main_text": "Character, Wellbeing, Emotion, and Moral Standing || Emotion and Affect\n3.3 Emotion and Affect\n\nAs much of the previous discussion reveals, the relationship between\nemotion and moral judgment is one of the central concerns of both\ntraditional and experimental moral philosophy. Our discussion of this\ntopic will focus on two types of research: the role of emotion in\nmoral reasoning generally, and the role of a specific\nemotion\u2014disgust\u2014in moral judgments.\n\nOne debate concerns whether hot, emotion-driven reasoning is\nnecessarily better or worse than reasoning based only on cooler, more\nreflective thinking\u2014a distinction sometimes referred to using\nKahneman\u2019s terminology of system 1/system 2 thinking. The\nterminology is not perfect, though, because Kahneman\u2019s terms map\nonto a quick, automatic, unconscious system of judgments (system 1)\nand a slow, effortful, deliberative decision-making process (system\n2), and as we saw above, this is not a distinction between emotion and\nreason, since rule-based judgments can be automatic and unconscious\nwhile emotional judgments might be effortful and conscious. The debate\nbetween Mikhail and Haidt is a debate over the extent to which\nemotions rather than rules explain our moral judgments; Singer and\nGreene\u2019s arguments against deontology rest on the claim that\nemotion-backed judgments are less justified than their utilitarian\ncounterparts.\n\nOne reason for thinking that moral judgments essentially involve some\nemotional component is that they tend to motivate us.\nInternalism is the view that there is a necessary connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation. This contrasts with\nexternalism, which doesn\u2019t deny that moral judgments\nare usually motivating, but does deny that they are necessarily so, as\nthe link between judgment and motivation is only contingent. Since\nemotions are intrinsically motivational, showing that moral judgments\nconsist, even in part, of emotions would vindicate internalism. One\nroute to this conclusion has involved surveying people\u2019s\nintuitions about moral judgment. Nichols (2002: 289) asked subjects\nwhether an agent who \u201chad no emotional reaction to hurting other\npeople\u201d but claims to know that hurting others is wrong really\nunderstands that hurting others is wrong. He found that most subjects\ndid attribute knowledge in such cases, suggesting that the ordinary\nconcept of moral judgment is externalist, a claim that is further\nsupported by Strandberg and Bj\u00f6rklund (2013). An additional\nsource of evidence comes from psychopaths and patients with traumatic\nbrain injuries, both of whom show evidence of impaired moral\nfunctioning\u2014though how one regards this evidence depends on\nwhich perspective one begins with: while externalists (Nichols\n2002; Roskies 2003) claim that the existence of psychopaths\nprovides a counterexample to the claim that moral judgment is\nmotivating (since psychopaths lack empathy and an aversion to harming\nothers), internalists (Smith 1994; Maibom 2005; Kennett\n& Fine 2008) argue that psychopaths don\u2019t actually make\nfull-fledged moral judgments. Psychologist Robert Hare (1993: 129)\nquotes a researcher as saying that, they \u201cknow the words but not\nthe music.\u201d Psychopaths also display other cognitive and\naffective deficiencies, as evidenced by their poor decision-making\nskills in other areas. This may mean that they should not be taken as\nevidence against internalism.\n\nA reason for thinking that moral judgments ought not involve emotion\nis that emotions sometimes seem to lead to judgments that are\ndistorted or off-track, or that seem otherwise unjustified. One\nemotion in particular is often mentioned in this context: disgust.\nThis emotion, which seems to be unique to human animals and emerges\nrelatively late in development (from the ages of about 5\u20138),\ninvolves a characteristic gaping facial expression, a tendency to\nwithdraw from the object of disgust, a slight reduction in body\ntemperature and heart rate, and a sense of nausea and the need to\ncleanse oneself. In addition, the disgusted subject is typically\nmotivated to avoid and even expunge the offending object, experiences\nit as contaminating and repugnant, becomes more attuned to other\ndisgusting objects in the immediate environment, and is inclined to\ntreat anything that the object comes in contact with (whether\nphysically or symbolically) as also disgusting. This last\ncharacteristic is often referred to as \u2018contamination\npotency\u2019 and it is one of the features that makes disgust so\npotent and, according to its critics, so problematic. The disgust\nreaction can be difficult to repress, is easily recognized, and\nempathically induces disgust in those who do recognize\n it.[13]\n There are certain objects that almost all normal adults are disgusted\nby (feces, decaying corpses, rotting food, spiders, maggots, gross\nphysical deformities). But there is also considerable intercultural\nand interpersonal variation beyond these core objects of disgust,\nwhere the emotion extends into food choices, sexual behaviors,\nout-group members, and violations of social norms. Many studies have\nclaimed to show that disgust is implicated in harsher moral judgments\n(Schnall, Haidt, & Clore 2008), citing experiments in which\nsubjects filling out questionnaires in smelly or dirty rooms evaluated\nmoral transgressions more harshly. Many of these studies have however\nfailed to replicate, raising doubts about the influence of incidental\ndisgust on moral judgment (e.g., Johnson, Cheung &\nDonnellan\u2019s (2014) failed replication of Schnall et al. (2008);\nGhelfi et al. 2020). \n\nOthers have gone further and argued that disgust might itself cause or\ncomprise a part of moral judgment (Haidt 2001; Wheatley & Haidt\n2005). If this is true, critics argue, we ought to be wary of those\njudgments, because disgust has a checkered past in multiple senses.\nFirst, it\u2019s historically (and currently) associated with racism,\nsexism, homophobia and xenophobia; the language of disgust is often\nused in campaigns of discrimination and even genocide. Secondly,\ndisgust\u2019s evolutionary history gives us reason to doubt it.\nKelly (2011) argues that the universal bodily manifestations of\ndisgust evolved to help humans avoid ingesting toxins and other\nharmful substances, while the more cognitive or symbolic sense of\noffensiveness and contamination associated with disgust evolved to\nhelp humans avoid diseases and parasites. This system is later\nrecruited for an entirely distinct purpose: to help mark the\nboundaries between in-group and out-group, and thus to motivate\ncooperation with in-group members, punishment of in-group defectors,\nand exclusion of out-group members.\n\nIf Kelly\u2019s account of disgust is on the right track, it seems to\nhave a number of important moral upshots. One consequence, he argues,\nis \u201cdisgust skepticism\u201d (139), according to which the\ncombination of disgust\u2019s hair trigger and its ballistic\ntrajectory mean that it is especially prone to incorrigible false\npositives that involve unwarranted feelings of contamination and even\ndehumanization. Hence, \u201cthe fact that something is disgusting is\nnot even remotely a reliable indicator of moral foul play\u201d but\nis instead \u201cirrelevant to moral justification\u201d (148).\n\nIt is important to note that the skeptical considerations Kelly raises\nare specific to disgust and its particular evolutionary history, so\nthey aren\u2019t intended to undermine the role of all emotions in\nmoral judgment. Still, if Kelly is correct, and if disgust is\nimplicated in lots of moral judgments, we may have a reason to be\nskeptical of many of our judgments. Plakias (2011, 2017) argues\nagainst the first half of this antecedent, claiming that Kelly and\nother \u2018disgust skeptics\u2019 are wrong to claim that the\npurposes of moral and physical disgust are totally distinct; she\nsuggests that disgust is sometimes a fitting response to moral\nviolations that protects against social contagion. May (2014) argues\nagainst the second half, claiming that disgust\u2019s role in moral\njudgment has been significantly overblown; at most, we have evidence\nthat disgust can, in certain cases, slightly amplify moral judgments\nthat are already in place. Recent empirical work indicates that\nincidental disgust has little effect on the harshness of moral\njudgments, though dispositional disgust-sensitivity does (Landy &\nGoodwin 2015; Landy & Piazza 2019).\n",
