    "main_text": "Philosophical Relevance || Philosophical Applications\n5.1 Philosophical Applications\n\nMuch philosophical research today is naturalistic, treating\nphilosophical investigations as continuous with empirical work in\nfields such as psychology. From a naturalistic perspective, philosophy\nof mind is closely allied with theoretical and experimental work in\ncognitive science. Metaphysical conclusions about the nature of mind\nare to be reached, not by a priori speculation, but by informed\nreflection on scientific developments in fields such as psychology,\nneuroscience, and computer science. Similarly, epistemology is not a\nstand-alone conceptual exercise, but depends on and benefits from\nscientific findings concerning mental structures and learning\nprocedures. Ethics can benefit by using greater understanding of the\npsychology of moral thinking to bear on ethical questions such as the\nnature of deliberations concerning right and wrong. Here are some\nphilosophical problems to which ongoing developments in cognitive\nscience are highly relevant. Links are provided to other relevant\narticles in this Encyclopedia.\n\nInnateness.\n To what extent is knowledge innate or acquired by experience? Is\nhuman behavior shaped primarily by nature or nurture?\nLanguage of thought.\n Does the human brain operate with a language-like code or with a more\ngeneral\n connectionist\n architecture? What is the relation between symbolic cognitive models\nusing rules and concepts and sub-symbolic models using neural\nnetworks?\nMental imagery.\n Do human minds think with visual and other kinds of imagery, or only\nwith language-like representations?\nFolk psychology.\n Does a person\u2019s everyday understanding of other people consist\nof having a theory of mind, or of merely being able to simulate\nthem?\nMeaning.\n How do\n mental representations\n acquire meaning or\n mental content?\n To what extent does the meaning of a representation depend on its\nrelation to other representations, its relation to the world, and its\nrelation to a community of thinkers?\nMind-brain identity.\n Are mental states brain states? Or can they be\n multiply realized\n by other material states? What is the relation between psychology and\nneuroscience? Is\n materialism\n true?\nFree will.\n Is human action free or merely caused by brain events?\nMoral psychology.\n How do minds/brains make ethical judgments?\nThe meaning of life.\n How can minds construed naturalistically as brains find value and\nmeaning?\nEmotions.\n What are emotions, and what role do they play in thinking?\nConsciousness.\n Can conscious experience be scientifically explained, for example by\nthe\n neuroscience of consciousness?\nMental disorder.\n What are mental disorders, and how are psychological and neural\nprocesses relevant to their explanation and treatment?\nPerception and reality.\n How do minds/brains form and evaluate representations of the external\nworld?\nPerception and cognition.\n How does perception differ from other kinds of cognition with respect\nto representational format and justification?\nRealism.\n Is cognitive science consistent with views that minds grasp the real\nworld? Could minds be computer simulations? Is virtual reality a kind\nof reality?\nInformation.\n How does cognitive science illuminate the operations of information\nand misinformation in minds and societies?\nSocial science.\n How do explanations of the operations of minds interact with\nexplanations of the operations of groups and societies?\n\n\nAdditional philosophical problems arise from examining the\npresuppositions of current approaches to cognitive science.\n",
