    "main_text": "The Nature of Moral Judgment\n6. The Nature of Moral Judgment\n\n\nOn Hume\u2019s view, what is a moral evaluation? Four main interpretations\nhave significant textual support. First, as we have seen, the\nnonpropositional view says that for Hume a moral evaluation does not\nexpress any proposition or state any fact; either it gives vent to a\nfeeling, or it is itself a feeling (Flew, Blackburn, Snare,\nBricke). (A more refined form of this interpretation allows that moral\nevaluations have some propositional content, but claims that for Hume\ntheir essential feature, as evaluations, is non-propositional.) The\nsubjective description view, by contrast, says that for Hume moral\nevaluations describe the feelings of the spectator, or the feelings a\nspectator would have were she to contemplate the trait or action from\nthe common point of view. Often grouped with the latter view is the\nthird, dispositional interpretation, which understands moral\nevaluations as factual judgments to the effect that the evaluated\ntrait or action is so constituted as to cause feelings of approval or\ndisapproval in a (suitably characterized) spectator (Mackie, in one of\nhis proposals). On the dispositional view, in saying some trait is\ngood we attribute to the trait the dispositional property of being\nsuch as to elicit approval.  A fourth interpretation distinguishes two\npsychological states that might be called a moral evaluation: an\noccurrent feeling of approval or disapproval (which is not truth-apt),\nand a moral belief or judgment that is propositional.  Versions of\nthis fourth interpretation differ in what they take to be the content\nof that latter mental state.  One version says that the moral\njudgments, as distinct from the moral feelings, are factual judgments\nabout the moral sentiments (Capaldi).  A distinct version, the moral\nsensing view, treats the moral beliefs as ideas copied from the\nimpressions of approval or disapproval that represent a trait of\ncharacter or an action as having whatever quality it is that one\nexperiences in feeling the moral sentiment (Cohon).  This last view\nemphasizes Hume\u2019s claim that moral good and evil are like heat, cold,\nand colors as understood in \u201cmodern philosophy,\u201d which are\nexperienced directly by sensation, but about which we form\nbeliefs.\n",
