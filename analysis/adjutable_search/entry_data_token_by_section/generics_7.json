    "main_text": "Semantic Analyses of Gen || Possible Worlds and Normalcy-Based Approaches\n2.1 Possible Worlds and Normalcy-Based Approaches\n\nMany accounts of generics are framed in terms of some or other type of\nquantification over possible worlds (Dahl 1975, Delgrande 1987,\nSchubert and Pelletier 1989, Asher and Morreau 1995, Krifka et al.\n1995, Pelletier and Asher 1997, Greenberg 2003, and others). Often,\nthese possible worlds are employed to capture the intuition that\ngenerics tell us something about what is normal for members\nof a kind (see Nickel 2008, 2016). For example, it is natural to think\nthat a generic such as \u201ctigers are striped\u201d tells us\nsomething about normal tigers; the only exceptions to it are those\ntigers who are albino, and so, one could argue, in some respect\nout-of-step with the norm for the kind. Similarly, \u201cdogs have\nfour legs\u201d may strike us as true because the only dogs that do\nnot have four legs either have birth defects or have met with\nmisfortune.\n\nPossible worlds are helpful here, because they allow us to consider,\nsay, worlds in which things go as normally as possible for a\ngiven tiger, even if life is actually quite abnormal for that\ntiger. For example, Asher, Morreau, and Pelletier argue that\n\u201cKs \u03a6\u201d is true iff for each individual\nK, the most normal worlds for that K (according to a\ncontextually determined ordering base), are such that that K\n\u03a6s (Asher and Morreau 1995; Pelletier and Asher 1997). Glossed in\nmore intuitive terms, the account states that a generic\n\u201cKs \u03a6\u201d is true iff each individual K\nwould have the property \u03a6 if all were to go as normally as\npossible for that K with respect to the relevant property.\nThus, while in actuality some dogs are three legged, one might suppose\nthat, had things gone more normally for each of those dogs with\nrespect to how many legs they have, they would have had four\nlegs.\n\nPelletier, Asher, and Morreau connect their semantic account of\ngenerics to the literature on defeasible validity (McCarthy 1986;\nReiter 1987, and others). A set of premises defeasibly or\nnon-monotonically entails a conclusion if the conclusion is\nlikely or reasonable given the premises, yet it is nonetheless\npossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. They\nargue that there are many defeasibly valid patterns of entailment that\ninvolve generics, and that their semantics explains why this is so.\nFor example, if Fido is a dog and dogs have four legs, then the\ninference that Fido has four legs is held to be defeasibly valid. It\nis possible that Fido is a three legged dog, but it is still\nreasonable to suppose that Fido is four legged on the basis\nof the premises. The reasonableness of this inference is explained on\nPelletier, Asher, and Morreau\u2019s semantics\u2014the generic\n\u201cdogs have four legs\u201d guarantees that, if things go\nnormally for a given dog with respect to its number of legs, then that\ndog will have four legs. Since we have been given no reason to suppose\nthat Fido is abnormal, one may defeasibly conclude that Fido is four\nlegged.\n\nIndisputably, a large number of true generics of the form\n\u201cKs \u03a6\u201d are such that, if things go normally\nfor a given K, then it has the property \u03a6. However, there\nwould seem to also be a number of true generics which do not fit this\nprofile: \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d, \u201clions have manes\u201d,\n\u201cmosquitoes carry the West Nile virus\u201d, and \u201csharks\nattack swimmers\u201d. The last two generics present a significant\ndifficulty for normalcy-based accounts, since it is surely not\nnormal for a mosquito to carry the virus, nor is it\nnormal for a shark to attack a bather. For generics such as\n\u201cducks lay eggs\u201d and \u201clions have manes\u201d,\nseveral theorists have argued that the domain of discourse is\nrestricted so that we are talking about only the female ducks and the\nmale lions respectively, and thus have aimed to rescue normalcy-based\napproaches from this criticism (e.g., Pelletier and Asher 1997), since\nperhaps it is abnormal for a given female duck to fail to lay eggs.\nPelletier and Asher suggest that a generic can be restricted to a\nsubkind of the kind in question in this way; that is, \u201cducks lay\neggs\u201d means female ducks lay eggs because female\nducks constitute a subkind of the kind ducks.\n\nHowever, on such a proposal, it is difficult to avoid the prediction\nthat \u201cducks are female\u201d should also be a true\ngeneric\u2014why can this generic not be made true by similarly\nrestricting the domain to include only this subkind of ducks? Or\nconversely, consider \u201cducks don\u2019t lay eggs\u201d.\nCertainly one subkind of ducks\u2014namely the male\nducks\u2014don\u2019t lay eggs, but this does not seem to suffice to\nmake the generic \u201cducks don\u2019t lay eggs\u201d\ntrue.\u00a0Asher and Pelletier (2012) offer a development of the\nnormalcy-based account intended to remedy these problems.\n\nFurther, a recent experiment examined whether people think that a kind\nin which a property is had only by one sex (i.e., where domain\nrestriction to a subkind is possible) is a better satisfier of the\ngeneric than a kind in which half the members, regardless of sex, have\nthe property (i.e., where no such restriction to a subkind is\npossible). If generics like \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d are only\naccepted because people are implicitly restricting the domain to a\nsubkind whose members generally possess the property, then they should\nshow a preference for one of the possible distributions over the\nother. However, no such preference was found (Cimpian, Gelman and\nBrandone 2010). Khemlani, Leslie, and Glucksberg (2012) also report\nempirical evidence that further suggests that people do not understand\nthese generics to involve domain restriction\u2014in particular, that\npeople are more likely to judge that an arbitrary duck lays eggs than\nthey are to judge that an arbitrary duck is female (but see\nLazaridou-Chatzigoga and Stockall (2013) for some evidence in favor of\ndomain restriction). This pattern is difficult to explain if people\nonly accept \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d because of domain\nrestriction. If one cannot appeal to domain restriction to handle\n\u201cducks lay eggs\u201d, then such generics would appear to\nconstitute counterexamples to this sort of approach.\n",
