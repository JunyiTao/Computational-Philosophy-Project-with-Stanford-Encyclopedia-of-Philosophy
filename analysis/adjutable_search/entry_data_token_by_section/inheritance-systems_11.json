Their approach can be described as focused on\nthe mechanismic basis for different types of hereditary phenotypic\nvariation. They have identified multiple inheritance systems, each\nwith several modes of transmission, that have different properties,\nand that interact and coevolve (Jablonka 2001: 100; Jablonka &\nLamb 2005/2014). The systems are said to carry information, defined as\nthe transmissible organization of an actual or potential state of a\nsystem. A detailed account of their mechanismic classification is\npresented in\n section 3.3.\n\nA different approach to characterizing and possibly for identifying\nand delimiting inheritance systems posits that to count as an\ninheritance system a system has to have evolved for the purpose of\ntransmitting hereditary information, i.e., to have the\n\u201cmeta-function\u201d of producing heritable phenotypes (Shea\n2007). In this respect this approach is reminiscent of the extended\nreplicator approach of Sterelny et al. (1996). Other requirements that\nhave been proposed in the literature are the demand for\n\u201cunlimited\u201d heredity, i.e., unlimited repertoire of\nvariants the system can store and transmit, needed for sustained or\ncumulative evolution (see discussion in Godfrey-Smith 2000; Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 43), and the ability to generate\nfine-grained response to selection (see Griffiths 2001: 460). Both\nthese requirements regard genetic inheritance as having a privileged\nrole in development and evolution in comparison with epigenetic\ninheritance processes. Jablonka and Lamb address these concerns with\nevolvability by noting that multiple instances of limited systems of\ninheritance may exist within one cell (e.g., multiple self-sustaining\nmetabolic cycles), thus extending the repertoire of hereditary\nvariations, and by emphasizing the effects limited hereditary systems\ncan have on the evolution of genetic variations (see the discussion of\ngenetic assimilation below). Jablonka also argues that the requirement\nfor high fidelity of replication (e.g., Sterelny 2001) is not as\nnecessary for inheritance systems that employ filtering mechanisms\nthat ensure that transmitted variations are typically adaptive\n(Jablonka 2002). For further discussion of the requirement for\nevolvability see the discussion of Sterelny\u2019s Hoyle conditions\nin\n section 4.6.\n\nIt should be noted that all the properties discussed above are\nproperties of systems, not properties of particular hereditary\nrelations, of particular transmission events, or of replicator\ntokens.\n",
