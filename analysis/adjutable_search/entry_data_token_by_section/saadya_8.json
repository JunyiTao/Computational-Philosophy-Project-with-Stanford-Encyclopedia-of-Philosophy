    "main_text": "Revelation as Praxis\n9. God, Unity, Creation, Soul\n\n Saadya upholds the absolute unity of God, and argues firmly for\ncreation ex nihilo. In this former regard, Saadya shares a\nsensibility with the Mu\u2018t\u00e2zilite theologians, and reveals\na knowledge of various heated debates on this theme at play in Islamic\ncircles during his time. On the issue of creation, Saadya defends a\ncreation ex nihilo position (though here breaks further company\nwith the Mu\u2018t\u00e2zilites who, in addition to creation ex\nnihilo, advanced an atomistic doctrine of continuous\n[re-]creation). In fact, between the various arguments he offers in\nhis Am\u00e2n\u00e2t as well as in his Commentary on the\nBook of Creation, Saadya defends the creation ex nihilo\nposition against 18 other theories, each of which he critiques in\nturn. In this series of arguments, Saadya reveals a familiarity with a\nnumber of philosophical and theological doctrines, including those of\nthe pre-Socratics, Plato and the Pythagoreans (though it should be\nnoted that his knowledge of these thinkers would have been largely\nbased on doxographies and other Arabic encyclopedic sources). \n\n In addition to refutations of 12 of the cosmogonic views (more of\nwhich he refutes in other works), Saadya provides us in the\nAm\u00e2n\u00e2t with proofs for the creation of the world\nex nihilo by God. He proceeds in three stages: he begins with\nfour proofs for the creation of the world (described respectively as\nproofs from finitude, composition, accidents, and time), moves on to\nthree reasons for why that creation must be rooted in an external\ncreator (as opposed to some idea of the self-createdness of the\nworld), and ends by showing how that creation must furthermore be\nunderstood as creation ex nihilo (as opposed to a creation out\nof some pre-existent matter). As Harry Wolfson has shown, Saadya bases\nhis four proofs for the createdness of the world on Islamic\nKal\u00e2m traditions (see Wolfson, 1943).\n\n Providing details of Saadya's arguments for creation ex nihilo\nis less interesting for our current purposes than making some\nobservations about Saadya's sensibilities about reason and revelation\nin these discussions. In the case of creation as well as the case of\nGod's unity, Saadya sees demonstration by reason as a cornerstone of\nbelief. At least in the case of some religious beliefs, reason alone\narrives at the ideas in question, and, furthermore, can prove that\nthey are true. It is worth noting in this regard a potential contrast\nwith some of the other chapters in the Am\u00e2n\u00e2t (such\nas chapters 6 and 7 on soul and resurrection respectively) which start\nwith the phrase \u201cOur Lord has informed us that...\u201d Might\nthis suggest that, for Saadya, the analysis of certain religious\ntopics is predicated on a somewhat different methodological\nperspective on the role of reason? However we answer this question, it\nis at least true that for Saadya, in the case of creation, reason is\nable to prove the religious idea of an external, ex nihilo\ncreatedness. And so, Saadya speaks here of the thesis which \u201cwe\nseek to establish\u201d (49), and ends the section with the\ndescription of \u201chaving thus succeeded in demonstrating by\nargument [the doctrine of creation ex nihilo]...\u201d (62). This\nestablished, though, he then goes on to add \u201c...as it has been\nverified by the Tradition of the Prophets and by miracles...\u201d\n(62). The role of revelation in Saadya's thought is always present. In\naddition to supplementing each demonstration with a supporting text\nfrom either the Bible or the Talmud (the written Rabbinic tradition),\nhe ends his exercise in reason with reference to tradition, prophets,\nand miracles.\n\n Following upon this delicate interplay of reason and revelation, it\nis interesting to note how the proofs for creation come up again in\nSaadya's treatment of resurrection. While the reasons Saadya gives for\nbelieving in the truth of resurrection have primarily to do with the\nreliability of Tradition, Saadya additionally invokes his reason-based\nproofs of creation ex nihilo to support the at least prima\nfacie reasonabless of such beliefs. Speaking against the critic who\nfinds the very idea of God's rejuvenating the dead philosophically\nuntenable, Saadya stresses that resurrection is not \u201crejected by\nreason because the second creation of a thing which was already in\nexistence and became dissolved, is more acceptable to reason than the\ncreation ex nihilo\u201d (158). Since the idea of something's\nbeing created ex nihilo is less reasonable than the idea of its\nbeing re-created, and since the idea of creation ex nihilo has\nalready been proven true by reason, therefore, a fortiori,\nsurely belief in resurrection is at least reasonable. Here, Saadya's\nproof for creation ex nihilo emerges in the service of his\nbelief in resurrection.\n\n Preceeding the discussion of resurrection, and following a few\nchapters after his analyses of creation, Saadya addresses the nature\nof soul. Although rejecting Plato's creation view, Saadya rests his\nown theory of soul upon a Platonic tripartite psychology. And so,\nafter rejecting a number of other views of soul, Saadya describes the\nsoul's three faculties as \u201cthe faculty of discernment, the\nfaculty of appetite, and the faculty of courage\u201d (147). Of\ncourse, to this Platonic foundation, he adds a number of\nTradition-rooted descriptions of soul as well. In fact, even before\nany philosophical consideration of the nature of soul, Saadya begins\nhis discussion with a quote from Zechariah 12:1 about God's\nforming \u201cthe spirit of man within him.\u201d Also before any\nphilosophical considerations, Saadya \u2014 following on this opening\nScriptural text \u2014 speaks of God's \u201cset[ting] a time-limit\nto the combined existence of body and soul\u201d (141), to His\n\u201cseparating\u201d body and soul at the time of death\n\u201cuntil the time when the number of souls which His wisdom has\ndecided to call into being is completed\u201d (141), and to the time\nwhen \u201cHe re-unites [souls] with their respective bodies and\nmetes out their reward\u201d (141). Scriptural citations coupled with\ndoctrines of resurrection and final judgement set the stage for\nSaadya's discourse on the nature of soul, leading us once again to\nconsider the delicate interplay of reason and revelation in the pages\nof his thought. This interplay can be further seen in Saadya's own\nPlato-plus-Tradition understanding of soul. In addition to coupling\nPlatonic tripartite psychology with Jewish beliefs about resurrection,\nSaadya actually links each of Plato's three discrete soul-fuctions to\nthree discrete Hebrew terms for \u201csoul\u201d found in Scriptures\n(nefesh as corresponding to the appetitive function,\nruah as corresponding to the faculty of passion and courage,\nand neshamah in correspondence to the faculty of knowledge)\n(147). Saadya additionally cites the Scriptural tendency to speak of\n\u201cheart and soul together\u201d (148) in support of what he\ntakes to be provable on empirical grounds (upon which he elaborates),\nviz. that \u201cthe soul is in the heart of man\u201d (148).\n",
