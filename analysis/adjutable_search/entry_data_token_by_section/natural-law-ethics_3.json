    "main_text": "Key Features of Natural Law Theories || The substance of the natural law view\n1.3 The substance of the natural law view\n\nThe center of Aquinas\u2019s natural law view as described thus far\nconcerns what we might call the metaphysics of morals: its role in\ndivine providence and the universally authoritative character of its\nnorms. What, though, of the normative content of\nAquinas\u2019s natural law position?\u00a0 Is there anything\ndistinctive about the normative natural law position?\u00a0 Here it is\ndifficult to say much that is uncontroversial, but we can say a\nsufficient amount about Aquinas\u2019s natural law theory to make\nclear that it is an interesting alternative to utilitarian (and more\ngenerally consequentialist) ethics, Kantian views, and standard\nAristotelian positions. (For a magisterial treatment of\nAquinas\u2019s natural law ethic, see Rhonheimer 2000.)\n\nAquinas says that the fundamental principle of the natural law is that\ngood is to be done and evil avoided (ST IaIIae 94, 2). This is, one\nmight say, a principle of intelligibility of action (cf. Grisez 1965):\nonly action that can be understood as conforming with this principle,\nas carried out under the idea that good is to be sought and bad\navoided, can be understood as an intelligible action. But no one can\nin acting simply pursue good \u2014 one has to pursue some particular\ngood. And Aquinas holds that we know immediately, by inclination, that\nthere are a variety of things that count as good and thus to be\npursued \u2014 life, procreation, knowledge, society, and reasonable\nconduct (ST IaIIae 94, 2; 94, 3) are all mentioned by Aquinas (though\nit is not clear whether the mentioned items are supposed to constitute\nan exhaustive list).\n\nSo on Aquinas\u2019s view it is the good that is fundamental: whether\nan action, or type of action, is right is logically posterior\nto whether that action brings about or realizes or is some\ngood. The good is, on Aquinas\u2019s view, prior to the\nright. But on Aquinas\u2019s view we are, somehow, able to reason\nfrom these principles about goods to guidelines about how these goods\nare to be pursued. Aquinas\u2019s thoughts are along the following\nlines: first, there are certain ways of acting in response to the\nbasic human goods that are intrinsically flawed; and second, for an\nact to be right, or reasonable, is for it to be an act that is in no\nway intrinsically flawed (ST IaIIae 18, 1).\n\nThe important task, then, is to identify the ways in which an act can\nbe intrinsically flawed. Aquinas does not obviously identify some\nmaster principle that one can use to determine whether an act is\nintrinsically flawed (though for an attempt to identify such a master\nprinciple in Aquinas\u2019s work see Finnis 1998, p. 126), though he\ndoes indicate where to look \u2014 we are to look at the features\nthat individuate acts, such as their objects (ST IaIIae 18, 2), their\nends (ST IaIIae 18, 3), their circumstances (ST IaIIae 18, 4), and so\nforth. An act might be flawed through a mismatch of object and end\n\u2014 that is, between the immediate aim of the action and its more\ndistant point. If one were, for example, to regulate one\u2019s\npursuit of a greater good in light of a lesser good \u2014 if, for\nexample, one were to seek friendship with God for the sake of mere\nbodily survival rather than vice versa \u2014 that would count as an\nunreasonable act. An act might be flawed through the circumstances:\nwhile one is bound to profess one\u2019s belief in God, there are\ncertain circumstances in which it is inappropriate to do so (ST\nIIaIIae 3, 2). An act might be flawed merely through its intention: to\ndirect oneself against a good \u2014 as in murder (ST IIaIIae 64, 6),\nand lying (ST IIaIIae 110, 3), and blasphemy (ST IIaIIae 13, 2)\n\u2014 is always to act in an unfitting way. Aquinas has no illusions\nthat we will be able to state principles of conduct that exhaustively\ndetermine right conduct, as if for every situation in which there is a\ncorrect choice to be made there will be a rule that covers the\nsituation. He allows for the Aristotelian insight that the particulars\nof the situation always outstrip one\u2019s rules, so that one will\nalways need the moral and intellectual virtues in order to act well\n(Commentary on NE, II, 2, 259). But he denies that this means that\nthere are no principles of right conduct that hold everywhere and\nalways, and some even absolutely. On Aquinas\u2019s view, killing of\nthe innocent is always wrong, as is lying, adultery, sodomy, and\nblasphemy; and that they are always wrong is a matter of natural law.\n(These are only examples, not an exhaustive list of absolutely\nforbidden actions.)\n\nPart of the interest of Aquinas\u2019s substantive natural law ethic\nlies in its not falling into the neat contemporary categories for\nmoral theories. His natural law view understands principles of right\nto be grounded in principles of good; on this Aquinas sides with\nutilitarians, and consequentialists generally, against Kantians.\u00a0\nBut Aquinas would deny that the principles of the right enjoin us to\nmaximize the good \u2014 while he allows that considerations of the\ngreater good have a role in practical reasoning, action can be\nirremediably flawed merely through (e.g.) badness of intention, flawed\nsuch that no good consequences that flow from the action would be\nsufficient to justify it \u2014 and in this Aquinas sides with the\nKantians against the utilitarians and consequentialists of other\nstripes. And while Aquinas is in some ways Aristotelian, and\nrecognizes that virtue will always be required in order to hit the\nmark in a situation of choice, he rejects the view commonly ascribed\nto Aristotle (for doubts that it is Aristotle\u2019s view; see Irwin\n2000) that there are no universally true general principles of right.\nThe natural law view rejects wholesale particularism.\n",
