    "main_text": "William of Ockham\n6. William of Ockham and the Possibility of Scientific Knowledge\n\n\nWilliam of Ockham discusses the Posterior Analytics and\ndemonstration in two places, his Summa Logicae III.II, On\nDemonstrative Syllogism, and his Scriptum in Librum\nSententiarum Ordinatio, Prologue, Questions 2 through 6 (before\n1324). In the latter, he develops an account of demonstration to\ndiscuss the question what, if anything, can be demonstrated of God. In\nboth places he lays out his views systematically, rather than in\ncommentarial form.\n\n\nOckham agreed with Scotus and Aquinas that the definition of the\nsubject is the middle term in a demonstration of the highest sort, but\nhe is no more comfortable with the notion that the subject somehow\nefficiently causes an attribute in itself through its essence than is\nAlbert. Indeed, he insists that nothing of interest follows for a\ndemonstration from the real definition of a subject giving its genus\nand difference. This is because what follows demonstratively follows\non some real structure of really distinct parts within the\nsubject. This means, first of all, that a genus-difference definition\nof a thing, which does not identify really distinct parts in it,\ncannot serve as a middle term in demonstration. Moreover, since God\nhas no real parts, but is perfectly simple, no demonstration\nconcerning God can be constructed at all. But some definitions of a\nsubject do identify real parts within it. One case occurs in\nmathematics, in which the real definition of a subject obliquely\nconveys parts of the subject, for instance, as in the definition of a\ntriangle, which is not said directly to be identical to its parts, the\nlines making it up, say, but is said obliquely to be something\ncomposed from those lines.  This, for Ockham, is the only\npossibility for the highest sort of demonstration (Summa\nLogicae III.II 40). It alone meets Thomas's criterion for such a\ndemonstration, i.e. it shows the attribute to belong actually to the\nsubject necessarily and in every case, Albert's criterion, that the\nattribute be occurrent and not merely a capacity, and Giles's\nrequirement that the attribute be really distinct from the subject, so\nthat it can reasonably be said that the conclusion is not an immediate\nproposition. In another case, one can demonstrate an implicitly\nnegative attribute of something from the fact that it is composed of\nreal parts, arguing, for instance, that \u201cWhatever has separable\nparts is destructible, every material thing has separable parts,\ntherefore every material thing is destructible.\u201d This, however,\nsince it shows an attribute which conveys the parts of the subject\nnegatively, is not a demonstration of the highest sort.\n\n\nIn another type of demonstration, the middle term may be a\ndefinition of a concrete subject obliquely referring to its parts\nwithout any determination, namely in demonstrations concerning animals\nand human beings, in which the reality contains a plurality of forms.\nThus a particular human being is able to learn, say, in virtue of the\nform which is its rational soul. If, as Thomas held, there is no\nplurality of forms here, but every natural substantial form, including\nbiological forms, is simple, and its rational soul just is the\nform of the body, then no demonstration is possible at all, for the\nability to learn is immediately in a human being through itself, so\nthat to say that a human being is rational is to express a first\nprinciple. If there is a plurality of forms, this sort of demonstration\nnonetheless falls short of the highest sort, for it concerns only the\nconcretum, the concrete instance that has several forms, not\nthe substance considered in itself (simply as possessor of the form).\n(Note that here forms are the parts expressed in the\ndefinition obliquely, so the case differs from mathematical\ndemonstrations.) Moreover, since the concretum receives the attribute,\nthe attribute is either learning itself, which is clearly not\ndemonstrable of every concrete instance of a human being, since some\nhuman beings may fail to realize their capacity to learn, or merely the\nability to learn, which is not an actual occurrent constituting part of\na real fact about the world as it is, but, as Albert insisted, merely a\nkind of possibility of an occurent thing. The notion that a kind of\nefficient causation produces the capacity for learning, which is to be\ntaken as something really present in a human being even when the human\nbeing is not learning, is rejected by Ockham, of course, for he takes\nit that talk about the capacity is only oblique talk about real events,\nusing modal propositions. All natural demonstration concerning\nefficient causes is reduced to this sort of thing by Ockham, and he\nnever allows that, for instance, it can be shown that fire is capable\nof heating, unless it is taken that we are talking about concrete\ninstances of fire, in which case the whole essence of a particular fire\ncan be expressed in the middle term, thus: \u201cEvery hot thing is\ncapable of heating, every concrete instance of fire is (essentially) a\nhot thing, therefore every concrete instance of fire is capable of\nheating.\u201d This is as close as Ockham gets to Thomas's notion of\nthe highest sort of demonstration.\n\n\nFor Ockham, a demonstration arising from natural efficient causes\ntakes the following pattern: \u201cWhen there is no opaque medium\nbetween the moon and the sun, the moon will be illuminated by the sun,\nwhen the moon is in such a place, there will be no opaque medium\nbetween the moon and the sun; therefore the moon is then\nilluminated.\u201d Here, the attribute \u201cilluminable,\u201d an\nattribute predicated of its subject without further determination, is\nindemonstrable, but the attribute \u201cilluminated when in such a\nplace\u201d is predicated of its subject with a further determination,\nand so can be demonstrated. This form of demonstration agrees closely\nwith the highest form of demonstration in Albert and Giles of Rome, but\nOckham does not regard it as demonstration of the highest sort, since\nits conclusion is hypothetical rather than categorical.\n\n\nOckham did not allow any demonstration from final causes on the\npattern of Grosseteste's demonstration of a material from a formal\ndefinition of an attribute, because he did not think that final causes\nhave any genuine productive power. When a final cause is identified,\nthe causal power involved is always the efficient causal power of some\nagent with a purpose in mind. This raised a problem with the account of\nthe science of demonstration Ockham inherited from Grosseteste.\nGrosseteste expected the science of demonstration to argue from the\nfunction of demonstration to the material structure required to realize\nthat function. The procedure seems inadmissible to Ockham, since it\ndoes not follow the path of actual (efficient) causation. Thus the\ndemonstrations making up the science of demonstration seem to be\nillegitimate. Ockham responds to this problem by holding on to the\nformal structure that Grosseteste had identified for the science of\ndemonstration, but making demonstration follow the natural (and\nreliably functional) efficient causal path from knowledge of its\npremisses to knowledge of its conclusion. Thus the conclusion that a\ndemonstration has necessary premisses cannot be drawn concerning\ndemonstration defined in terms of its purpose, but only for\ndemonstration defined in such a way that that sort of thing actually\nproduces knowledge. So the definition will be \u201ca syllogism with\nnecessary premisses etc,\u201d which, as it happens, supposits for the\nsame things as \u201csyllogism intended by the artisan, the logician,\nto produce knowledge.\u201d It is as though we were to define an axe\nby describing those aspects of its structure responsible for its\nfunctionality (a handle of a certain shape, a head made of iron with a\nsharp edge, etc.), and then deducing from this structure that it will\nactually serve that function (actually cut wood) under the right\nconditions, and then applying this piece of natural science to the\npractical issue by giving the advice to use an axe so defined in the\nappropriate way when one wants to cut wood.\n",
