    "main_text": "Conceptions, theories, and kinds of agency\n2. Conceptions, theories, and kinds of agency\nThe contributions of Anscombe and Davidson have established a\nstandard conception of action, and Davidson\u2019s work has provided\nthe groundwork for a standard theory of action. At the core of the\nstandard conception are the following two claims. First, the notion of\nintentional action is more fundamental than the notion of action. In\nparticular, action is to be explained in terms of the intentionality\nof intentional action. Second, there is a close connection between\nintentional action and acting for a reason.\nThere are two ways of spelling out the first claim (which\ncorrespond to two different views on the individuation of actions; see\nsection 3.4). According to the first, one\nand the same event can be more than one action under different\ndescriptions, and an event is an action just in case it is an\nintentional action under some description. An action, that\nis, may be intentional under some description and unintentional under\nothers (Anscombe 1957; Davidson 1963). Suppose that you alert the\nburglar by turning on the light, and suppose that this is one event\nthat is intentional under the description \u2018turning on the\nlight\u2019, but not under \u2018alerting the burglar\u2019. On this view, alerting the burglar is nevertheless something that you do,\ngiven that the event is an intentional action under some description.\nAccording to a second way of spelling out the first claim, something\nis an action either if it is identical with or \u201cgenerated\nby\u201d an intentional action (Goldman 1970; see also Ginet\n1990).[4] On this view, alerting the burglar is an action of yours either if it\nis an intentional action or if it is generated by an intentional\naction (your turning on the light, in this case). If it is merely\ngenerated by an intentional action, it is an unintentional action of\nyours. On both views, intentional action is more fundamental than\naction itself: action derives from and is dependent on intentional\naction.[5]\nAccording to the second claim of the standard conception, there is\na close connection between acting intentionally and acting for a\nreason. According to Anscombe and Davidson\u2019s early view, this\nclose connection is identity. Following Aristotle, they both held the\nview that to act intentionally is to act for a reason, and that to\nact for a reason is to act in a way that can be rationalized by the\npremises of a sound practical syllogism, which consists, typically,\nof a major premise that corresponds to the agent\u2019s goal and a\nminor premise that corresponds to the agent\u2019s take on how to\nattain the goal. Furthermore, Davidson held the view that having an\nintention consists in having a desire and a belief that correspond to\nthe major and the minor premise of the relevant syllogism (Davidson\n1963, 1970; see also Goldman 1970; Audi\n1986).[6]\nOne can still find a fairly widespread commitment to this\ndesire-belief version of the standard conception (in the philosophy of\nmind, the philosophy of psychology, ethics, meta-ethics, and in other\nareas of research). In the philosophy of action, however, it is now\nwidely thought that intentions cannot be reduced to desires and\nbeliefs (and combinations thereof). On this view, intentions play a\ncrucial and irreducible role in practical reasoning, long-term\nplanning, and in the initiation and guidance of action (see,\nespecially, Bratman 1987; see also Harman 1976; Brand 1984; Bishop\n1989; Mele 1992, 2003; En\u00e7 2003). It is nevertheless still\nwidely accepted that there is a close connection between intentional\naction and acting for reasons and that intentional actions are\ntypically performed for reasons (Mele and Moser 1994; Mele 2003;\nEn\u00e7 2003; Clarke 2010b, for instance).\nThe standard conception is not committed to a particular\naccount of what it is to act intentionally and for reasons, and it is\nnot committed to a particular account of the nature of reason\nexplanations. It is important to distinguish the standard conception\nfrom the standard theory, which provides a causal account of\nintentional action and reason explanation. This theory says, very\nroughly, that something is an intentional action and done for reasons\njust in case it is caused by the right mental states and events in the\nright way. The right mental states and events are states and events\nthat rationalize the action from the agent\u2019s point of view (such\nas desires, beliefs, and intentions). The right way of causation is\nnon-deviant causation (see\nsection 3.2). On this view, a reason explanation is an explanation in terms of\nmental states and events that cause the action and that rationalize it\nfrom the agent\u2019s point of view (typically by providing a\nmeans-end rationale). This theory is often called \u201cthe causal\ntheory of action\u201d. Strictly speaking, it is an event-causal\ntheory and it consists of an event-causal theory of reason explanation\nand an event-causal theory of intentional action. In conjunction with\nthe standard conception, this causal theory provides us with a theory\nof action, which has been the standard theory in the contemporary\nphilosophy of mind and action (see also the entry on\naction).\nAs indicated, the standard conception is compatible with non-causal\ntheories of intentional action and reason explanation. It is generally\nagreed that a reason explanation of an action usually renders the\naction intelligible by revealing the agent\u2019s goal or intention.\nAccording to non-causal theories, having the relevant goals or\nintentions does not consist in the possession of causally\nefficacious mental states or events (Melden 1961; Ginet 1990;\nO\u2019Connor 2000; Sehon 2005). Non-causal theories are, however,\nwidely rejected (the most influential critique is due to Davidson\n1963; see also Goldman 1970: 76\u201385; Mele 2003: 38\u201351;\nClarke 2003: 21\u201324). The standard conception is compatible,\nfurthermore, with dual standpoint theories. We will turn to this view\nin\nsection 3.3.\n",
