    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n7. Aesthetics\n\nUnlike his teacher Kant, who had relatively little interest in or\nknowledge of literature and art, and whose treatment of them in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment (1790) is correspondingly\nweak, Herder had a passionate interest in and a deep knowledge of\nthem, and as a result was able to develop a rich set of original and\nimportant ideas about them. In this respect he set a valuable\nprecedent that would be followed in the next generation by the\nRomantics (especially Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel) and\nHegel.\n\nHerder also anticipated and influenced the Romantics in another\nimportant way. One of their most striking and distinctive positions\nwas a certain valorization of literature and art over other areas of\nculture (such as science, religion, and morality). But Herder had\nalready developed such a position before them. First, from an early\nperiod he argued that song was the origin of all language\n\u2013 and consequently also of all thought. Second, in works such as\nthe Treatise on the Origin and especially the essay On\nImage, Poetry, and Fable (1787) he argued that all language (and\nconsequently also all thought) is fundamentally figurative or\nmetaphorical in nature\u2014for example, that its grammar typically\nprojects the two genders onto the whole of nature, and that it\npervasively involves a set of creative transitions from an object to a\nsensory stimulus to an individualistically formed image and thence to\nthought and language\u2014and is thus poetic. Third, he\nargued in works such as Attempt at a History of Lyric Poetry\n(1764) and On the Spirit of Hebrew Poetry that poetry has\nbeen fundamental to religion from the beginning, and elsewhere that\nnon-linguistic art, especially sculpture, has played an important role\nin religion from an early period as well. Fourth, he also argued that\npoetry has a very important function in moral education, indeed one\neven more important than that of other mechanisms of moral education\nsuch as laws.\n\nWhat, beyond this, are Herder\u2019s most important contributions to\naesthetics? He is skeptical about the sort of aprioristic and\nsystematic aesthetics that the inventor of the discipline of\naesthetics, the Rationalist philosopher Baumgarten, had recently\ndeveloped. Instead, he calls for a bottom-up, or empirical,\napproach to the discipline. And his considered position concerning the\nideal of an aesthetic system is dismissive as well. It is\ntrue that he began his career aspiring to something of the sort and\nthat in the Critical Forests (1769) he accordingly set out to\nargue for the following little aesthetic system: whereas music is a\nmere succession of objects in time, and sculpture and painting are\nmerely spatial, poetry has a sense, a soul, a force; whereas music,\nsculpture, and painting belong solely to the senses (namely, to\nhearing, feeling, and vision, respectively), poetry not only depends\non the senses but also relates to the imagination; whereas music,\nsculpture, and painting employ only natural signs, poetry\nuses voluntary and conventional ones. It is also\ntrue that this system would later be taken over (with only minor\nmodifications) by Schleiermacher in his aesthetics lectures, and that\nit has sometimes been touted as Herder\u2019s main achievement in\naesthetics more recently as well (for example, by Robert Norton). But\nas Herder himself quickly came to realize after formulating it, it is\na very naive system. And his real achievements in aesthetics are other\nthan and contrary to it.\n\nLet us turn to those real achievements, then. One of them concerns the\nrelation between art and language. As we saw earlier, Herder\u2019s\nphilosophy of language is committed to the two doctrines that thought\nis essentially dependent on and bounded by language, and that meaning\nis word-usage. This prompts certain questions. These doctrines make a\nplausible break with a common Enlightenment assumption that thought\nand meaning are in principle autonomous of whatever material,\nperceptible expressions they may happen to receive. Following Charles\nTaylor, we might call such a move one to \u201cexpressivism\u201d.\nBut what form should expressivism take exactly? Is the\ndependence of thought and meaning on external symbols strictly one on\nlanguage (in the usual sense of \u201clanguage\u201d)? Or\nis it rather a dependence on a broader range of symbolic media\nincluding, besides language, also such things as painting, sculpture,\nand music\u2014so that a person might be able to entertain thoughts\nthat he was not able to express in language but only in some other\nsymbolic medium? Let us call the former position narrow\nexpressivism and the latter broad expressivism.\n\nHamann in his Metacritique, despite verbally echoing\nHerder\u2019s two doctrines in the philosophy of language, espoused a\nversion of broad expressivism. But Herder adopted narrow expressivism,\nas those two doctrines already seem to imply. Moreover, after much\nwrestling with the subject, he eventually developed a very attractive\nversion of narrow expressivism. The key work here was again the\nCritical Forests. By the time of writing this work, Herder\nwas already committed to the two doctrines in question, and, as this\nwould suggest, from the start in the work he was committed to narrow\nexpressivism. However, his commitment to it there was initially\nunsatisfactory and indeed inconsistent. For one thing, it initially\ntook the implausible form of denying to the non-linguistic arts any\ncapacity to express thoughts autonomously of language by\ndenying that they can express thoughts at all. This was the\nforce of the naive theory recently described that the work initially\nset out to develop. Adding inconsistency to this unsatisfactoriness,\nHerder was from the start in the work also committed to saying (far\nmore plausibly) that visual art often does express\nthoughts\u2014for example, he intervened in a quarrel between Lessing\nand Winckelmann on the question of whether linguistic art (especially\npoetry) or visual art (especially sculpture) is expressively superior\nin ways that tended to support Winckelmann\u2019s case for visual\nart. This unsatisfactoriness and inconsistency mainly resulted\nfrom Herder\u2019s oversight of a single fact: that it is perfectly\npossible to reconcile narrow expressivism with the attribution of\nthoughts to non-linguistic art, namely, by insisting that the\nthoughts expressed by non-linguistic art must be derivative from and\nbounded by the artist\u2019s capacity for linguistic expression.\nHowever, by the time Herder wrote the later parts of the Critical\nForests, he had found this solution. Thus in the third part,\nfocusing on a particularly instructive example, he notes that the\npictorial representations on Greek coins are typically allegorical in\nnature. And by the time he writes the fourth part he is prepared to\nsay something similar about much painting as well, writing there, for\nexample, of \u201cthe sense, the allegory, the story/history that is\nput into the whole of a painting\u201d (G2:313). By\n1778 he extends this account to sculpture as well. Thus in the essay\nSculpture [Plastik] from 1778 he abandons the merely\nsensualistic conception of sculpture that had predominated in the\nCritical Forests and instead argues that sculpture is\nessentially expressive of, and therefore needs to be interpreted by, a\nsoul. But this no longer forces him into unfaithfulness to\nhis principle that thought is essentially dependent on, and bounded\nby, language, for he now conceives the thoughts that are expressed by\nsculpture as having a linguistic source:\n\n\nThe sculptor stands in the dark of night and gropes toward the forms\nof gods. The stories of the poets are before and in him.\n(G4:317)\n\n\nSubsequently, in the Theological Letters (1780\u20131) and\nthe Letters for the Advancement, Herder extends the same\nsolution to instrumental music as well.\n\nThe considered position at which Herder eventually arrived also\nimplies that \u201cnon-linguistic\u201d art is dependent on thought\nand language in another way: In the fourth and final part of the\nCritical Forests (which was only published posthumously in\nthe nineteenth century) he develops the point that human perception is\nof its nature infused with concepts and beliefs, and consequently with\nlanguage\u2014which of course implies that the same is true of the\nperception of \u201cnon-linguistic\u201d artworks in particular. So\n\u201cnon-linguistic\u201d art is really doubly dependent on thought\nand language: not only for the thoughts that it expresses but\nalso for those that it presupposes in perception.\n\nWith Herder\u2019s achievement of this refined form of narrow\nexpressivism and Hamann\u2019s articulation of his broad\nexpressivism, there were now two somewhat plausible but competing\ntheories available. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century German theorists\n(e.g., Hegel, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Gadamer) would subsequently\nbe deeply torn between them. And the issue remains an important one\ntoday. While the philosophical considerations involved are difficult,\nI believe, and have argued elsewhere, that Herder\u2019s position is\nthe correct one.\n\nHerder\u2019s position here also carries important implications for\nhermeneutics. Since, in his considered view, thought/meaning and\nlanguage play important roles not only in literature but also in\n\u201cnon-linguistic\u201d art, for him both cases present similar\ninterpretive challenges, requiring similar interpretive solutions.\n\nAnother of Herder\u2019s most important contributions to aesthetics\nlies in his historicism, or, more broadly, his recognition that there\nare radical mental differences between historical periods, cultures,\nand even individuals. In connection with literature and art this\nposition takes five main specific forms.\n\nFirst, as we have already seen, Herder holds that concepts, beliefs,\nvalues, and so on vary deeply between historical periods, cultures,\nand even individuals. This obviously applies to literature in\nparticular. Moreover, since, as we have just seen, for Herder\nseemingly non-linguistic arts such as painting, sculpture, and music\nlikewise presuppose and express concepts, beliefs, and values, it also\napplies to them.\n\nSecond, Herder holds that genre\u2014i.e., a certain set of purposes\nand rules\u2014is an essential aspect of any work of literature or\nart. But he also holds that genres differ in deep ways between\nhistorical periods (as well as between cultures and even individuals),\nand this not only in the sense that new genres emerge and old ones\ndie, but also in the sense that seeming continuities in genre\ntypically in fact mask important differences. For example, in the\nessay Shakespeare (1773) he argues in detail that the genres\nof ancient Greek \u201ctragedy\u201d and Shakespearean\n\u201ctragedy\u201d, which interpreters have often assumed to be the\nsame, are in fact deeply different from each other, constituted by\ndifferent purposes and rules. Similarly, in This Too a Philosophy\nof History (1774), he argues, against Winckelmann, who had tended\nto assimilate the genres of ancient Greek portrait sculpture and\nPharaonic Egyptian portrait sculpture, that whereas the former was\ndominated by the genre-purpose of portraying this-worldly life, charm,\nand beauty, the latter had the quite contrary genre-purpose of\nconveying ideas of death and eternity.\n\nThird, Herder argues that literature started out predominantly\nsensuous in character but then became increasingly intellectual as\nhistory proceeded. In the early essays On the Ode (1764/5)\nand Attempt at a History of Lyric Poetry he explains this\ndevelopment in terms of a diminution of strong feelings (e.g., fear)\nand an increase in mental complexity and science, and he regards it as\na sort of decline. Later on, in the Letters for the\nAdvancement, he retains the descriptive part of this account, but\nrevises its conception that a decline is involved: the more sensuous\npoetry of the ancients and the more intellectualized poetry of the\nmoderns are two different but equally legitimate types of poetry.\n(This new position would strongly influence the Romantics.)\n\nFourth, Herder holds that aesthetic values such as beauty are\nfundamentally a matter of feelings and that the feelings in question\nvary in important ways between one period, culture, or even individual\nand another. This theme is already prominent in On the Ode,\nwhere he discusses major differences in the feelings of beauty that\noccur between different periods/cultures\u2014for example, between\nhis own age and the age of the ancient Greeks. It is also prominent in\nOn the Change of Taste (1766), where he adds that the changes\ninvolved are indeed sometimes extreme enough to amount to an outright\ninversion.\n\nFifth, Herder holds that it is an essential part of the function of\nliterature and art to communicate moral values, but he also observes\nthat the moral values communicated often differ in deep ways from one\nperiod, culture, or individual to another. For example, in Attempt\nat a History of Lyric Poetry he argues (very insightfully) that\nearly Greek poetry, especially Homer, communicates a very different\nset of moral values than our own.\n\nThese historicist insights concerning literature and art are extremely\nimportant in their own right. In addition, Herder sees that they carry\ndeep implications for the interpretation and the critical\nevaluation of literature and art. Let us reconsider the first two\nof them in this connection.\n\nThe first insight concerns radical differences in concepts, beliefs,\nvalues, and so on. Since literature paradigmatically expresses such\nthings and is obviously linguistic, Herder\u2019s general hermeneutic\nprinciples for interpreting linguistic texts and discourse in the face\nof radical mental difference (as already discussed) of course apply to\nliterature in particular. Accordingly, in the Critical\nForests he emphasizes that it is important to penetrate\nHomer\u2019s alien linguistic and conceptual world by using careful\nphilological means; that it is always necessary to interpret the local\nfeatures within a work, for example, \u201cridiculous\u201d\npassages, such as the Thersites passage, in the Iliad (II:\n211\u2013277), in light of the economy of the whole work; and (this\ntime in connection with the example of Horace\u2019s odes) that the\nsolution to the problem of achieving such holism despite the need to\ninterpret the parts of a text sequentially lies in working through the\ntext in sequence in order to arrive at a provisional interpretation of\nall its parts together, then applying this provisional interpretation\nof the whole text in order to refine the interpretation of each part,\nand so on indefinitely.\n\nBut since Herder also holds that such seemingly non-linguistic forms\nof art as painting, sculpture, and music likewise presuppose and\nexpress concepts, beliefs, values, and so on that are ultimately\ngrounded in language, he believes that the same general hermeneutic\nprinciples for interpreting linguistic works in the face of radical\nmental difference also make an essential contribution to the\ninterpretation of this sort of art.\n\nMoreover, since understanding what a piece of literature or art\npresupposes or expresses is obviously a prerequisite for evaluating it\nproperly, this sort of hermeneutic approach is not only essential for\ninterpreting it but also for evaluating it.\n\nOur second example concerns genre. Herder believes,\nplausibly, that a work of art is always written or made in order to\nexemplify a certain genre, and that it is vitally important for the\ninterpreter to identify its genre if he is to understand it.\n\nWhy does Herder believe that identifying genre is essential for\nunderstanding? He has at least three reasons in mind (all of them good\nones): First, grasping a work\u2019s genre is itself an essential\nconstituent of understanding the work and its contents (much as\ngrasping a sentence\u2019s meaning and illocutionary force is an\nessential constituent of understanding the sentence and its contents).\nSecond, since an author intends his work to exemplify a certain genre,\nthere will normally be aspects of the work\u2019s meaning that are\nexpressed, not explicitly in any of its parts, but rather through its\nintended exemplification of the genre. Third, correctly identifying\nthe genre is also vitally important for accurately interpreting many\nthings that are expressed explicitly in the parts of a\nwork.\n\nHowever, as we noted, Herder introduces an important historicist\ninsight about genre here: he recognizes that even when different\nhistorical periods, cultures, or individuals appear to share a single\ngenre\u2014for example, ancient Greek \u201ctragedy\u201d and\nShakespearean \u201ctragedy\u201d, or Pharaonic Egyptian\n\u201cportrait sculpture\u201d and ancient Greek \u201cportrait\nsculpture\u201d\u2014this appearance usually in fact masks important\ndifferences.\n\nThis has important consequences for interpretation. For example, it\nleads Herder to emphatically reject apriorism as an approach to\nidentifying a work\u2019s genre\u2014certainly the absolute\napriorism of refusing in one\u2019s definition of the genre to be\nguided by an observation of examples at all, but also the more\ntempting relative apriorism of indeed allowing oneself to be guided by\nit but restricting the examples considered to a limited number of\ncases to the exclusion of other ones to which the resulting\ngenre-conception is then to be applied in interpretation. For, in\nlight of the historicist insight just mentioned, even the latter\nprocedure will usually turn out to be disastrously misleading, in\nHerder\u2019s view.\n\nInstead, according to Herder, the interpreter should approach the task\nof identifying the genre involved in a work in a thorough and\nscrupulous empirical manner. As one might expect, this above all\nrequires examining the work itself closely in order to discover which\ngenre-purposes and -rules are operative within it. But it also\nrequires taking into account the whole social context within which the\nwork was produced and the historical genesis of its genre through\nantecedent genres. In addition, it may sometimes include taking into\naccount an author\u2019s or artist\u2019s explicit statements about\nthe genre that he is using.\n\nMoreover, Herder emphasizes that correctly identifying the genre of a\nwork by these means is vitally important not only for\ninterpreting the work correctly, but also for critically\nevaluating it correctly: French critics not only make an\ninterpretive mistake when they go to Shakespeare\u2019s\ntragedies with a genre in mind from the ancient world that was not in\nfact his, but they also, on this basis, make an evaluative\nmistake: because they falsely assume that he somehow must be aspiring\nto realize the genre-purpose and -rules that Aristotle found in\nancient tragedy, they fault him for failing to realize these, while at\nthe same time they overlook the quite different genre-purpose and\n-rules that he really does aspire to realize and his success in\nrealizing these. Similarly, Winckelmann not only makes an\ninterpretive mistake when he implicitly imputes to the\nEgyptians a Greek genre-conception for sculpture that was not theirs,\nbut also, on this basis, makes an evaluative one: because he\nfalsely assumes that the Egyptians somehow must be aspiring to realize\nthe Greek genre-purpose and -rules, he faults them for failing to\nrealize these, and at the same time he overlooks their success in\nrealizing the very different genre-purpose and -rules that they really\ndo aspire to realize.\n\nHerder\u2019s new historicist approach to interpreting and evaluating\nliterature and art led to enormous progress in the actual\ninterpretation and critical evaluation of both. For example, it\nenabled the Schlegel brothers to achieve a much deeper understanding\nof ancient tragedy than had been achieved before, an\n(anti-Aristotelian) understanding of it on which all serious classical\nscholarship concerned with it has rested since. And it not only\nenabled Friedrich Schlegel (in his work on paintings in the Louvre and\non cathedral architecture) to develop a similar approach to visual\nart, but also (in part thereby) made possible the highly sophisticated\ntwentieth-century art history of Erwin Panofsky and Ernst Gombrich,\nwhich transcended previous art historians\u2019 (Kant-influenced)\noveremphasis on style in visual art to include a scrupulously\nhistoricist attention to the role of meaning and genre in it as\nwell.\n\nHerder also has important ideas concerning a topic that has often been\nassumed to be central to aesthetics: beauty. A first\nimportant idea he develops here (both in relation to art and more\ngenerally) is that standards of beauty vary greatly from one\nhistorical period or culture to another. At least, this is his normal\nposition, from early works such as On the Ode and On the\nChange of Taste to late ones such as the Calligone\n(where he invokes it against Kant\u2019s Critique of the Power of\nJudgment). Occasionally\u2014for example, in the Critical\nForests and even at points in the Calligone\u2014he\ninstead argues (as other thinkers, such as Hume, had done before him)\nthat there is a deeper uniformity in standards of beauty across\nhistorical periods and cultures. However, the former position is his\nmore considered one and is ultimately the more plausible one.\n\nA second important idea, which he already develops in the Critical\nForests and then repeats in the Calligone, concerns the\nvery concept of beauty. He argues, plausibly, that the concept\u2019s\norigins lay in visual experience (as, he thinks, is suggested\nby an etymological connection in German between the words\nsch\u00f6n [beautiful] and Schein [shine,\nappearance]), but that it has since been extended from that primary\ndomain to cover virtually \u201ceverything that has a pleasurable\neffect on the soul\u201d, that in this sense \u201csight \u2026\nallegorizes the images, the representations, the conceits of the\nsoul\u201d, so that beauty just becomes our most general\nterm of approval for whatever we find pleasing in relation to any of\nthe senses and indeed even mental life more broadly\n(G2:289\u2013291).\n\nA third important idea that he develops is that beauty is in fact much\nless important in literature and art than it has often been thought to\nbe. This demotion of beauty is based not only on his somewhat\ndeflationary genealogy of the concept just mentioned but also on his\nproto-Romantic conception that literature and art have fundamental\nfunctions in relation to language/thought, religion, and morality, and\non his mature insistence that meaning and thought play a vital role\neven in \u201cnon-linguistic\u201d art. He tended to accentuate this\ndemotion of beauty increasingly as time went on. Accordingly, whereas\nin early works such as On the Ode and the Critical\nForests he still treated beauty as central to aesthetics, by the\ntime he writes the Calligone he has changed his mind and now\ninsists that it is not nearly as essential to art as it is often taken\nto be. In particular, he argues there that art is much more\nessentially a matter of Bildung\u2014cultural formation or\neducation (especially in moral respects).\n\nFinally, let us consider Herder\u2019s thesis that literature and art\nhave a morally educative function a little further. In On the\nEffect of Poetic Art on the Ethics of Peoples in Ancient and Modern\nTimes (1778), On the Influence of the Belles Lettres on the\nHigher Sciences (1781), and the Calligone he not only\nsees this as one of their most essential functions, but also holds\nthat literature has a more powerful effect as an instrument of moral\neducation than other such instruments, including law.\n\nHe also develops a nuanced account of how literature and art do and\nshould perform this function. For example, in On the\nInfluence he specifies three distinct ways in which literature or\npoetry promotes the formation of moral character. First, it does so\n\u201cthrough light rules\u201d\u2014in other words, through a\nsubtle articulation of ethical principles. Second, and more\nimportantly in his view, it does so by representing good moral role\nmodels in a positive light so that people will emulate them:\n\u201cstill better, through good examples\u201d. Third, it also does\nso by conveying a range of practical experience that is conducive to\nthe formation of moral character and which would otherwise have to be\nacquired, if at all, by the more arduous and painful route of\nfirst-hand experience. In addition, Herder elsewhere implies a fourth\nimportant way in which literature contributes to moral character\nformation: it is a fundamental principle underlying his Popular\nSongs that literature, by vividly conveying the inner\nlives\u2014for instance, the fears, hopes, and joys\u2014of other\npeople to its audience or readership, will stir the latter\u2019s\nsympathies for them and thereby inculcate more moral attitudes toward\nthem. Fifth, Herder in the Calligone adds a further point,\nconcerning \u201cnon-linguistic\u201d art, namely, that visual art\nhas a power to make moral ideals attractive by presenting them blended\nwith physical beauty, and that, similarly, music has a power to affect\nmoral character either for good or for ill depending on the principles\nof conduct that are associated with it.\n\nHerder\u2019s conception that the formation of moral character both\nis and ought to be a primary function of literature and art serves him\nas an important criterion for evaluating individual works. For\nexample, when he observes in On the Effect that unlike\nearlier poetry modern poetry has typically lost this function, he\nmeans this as a serious criticism of modern poetry. And he applies\nthis criterion as a ground for criticizing certain works by his friend\nGoethe that he considers to be immoral or amoral in content.\n",
