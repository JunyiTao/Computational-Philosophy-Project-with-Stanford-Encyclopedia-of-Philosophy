    "main_text": "Defaults and Accountability\n5. Defaults and Accountability\n\nInteractional pragmatics discussed in the previous section highlights\nanother important aspect of communication that was largely neglected\nin early pragmatic theories, namely speaker accountability. Haugh\n(2013: 53) presents it as follows:\n\nFirst, what a speaker is held accountable for goes beyond the veracity\nof information to include other moral concerns, such as social rights,\nobligations, responsibilities and the like. Second, to be held\ninteractionally accountable differs from inferring\ncommitment. The former is tied to an understanding of speaker meaning\nas arising through incremental, sequentially grounded discourse\nprocessing \u2026, while the latter is tied to a punctuated view of\nspeaker meaning that arises at the level of utterance processing.\n\n\nAs he says, it is important to view speaker meaning as a\ndeontological concept \u2013 that is, view it from the\nperspective of moral philosophy and norms of what actions are\npermitted or not permitted in conversation. Viewing speaker meaning as\ndeonotological puts emphasis on practical applications of speech, on\nsuch moral norms and on the consequences of conversational behaviour.\nAnd this is where defaultness comes to the fore, propelled by the\nquestion as to what kind of content speakers ought to be held\naccountable for. Should it be the kind of meaning that speakers feel\ncommitted to, or the kind of meaning that they, sometimes\ninadvertently, communicated? Or, perhaps, merely the minimal semantic\ncontent? Emma Borg (2019), for example, distinguishes between what she\ncalls (i) strict liability, that is liability for the minimal\nproposition pertaining to one\u2019s utterance, delimited according\nto the principles of her Minimal Semantics (Borg 2004, 2012), and (ii)\nconversational liability (a gradable concept), applied to potential\ninterpretations of an utterance in the context of conversation. But\nsuch philosophical solutions don\u2019t go far enough in that they\nmerely offer a more fine-grained classification rather than\nimplementable answers. Next, Elder and Haugh (2018) focus on\n\u2018the most salient propositional meaning that is\nostensively made operative between interlocutors\u2019 (p. 595),\nwhich allows them to offer a proposal with more direct utility for\ndiscussions of moral responsibility. The concept of dynamic, operative\nmeaning allows them to argue that it is the addressee\u2019s response\nthat makes the speaker accountable for the emergent meaning \u2013\nthe meaning that the interlocutors settle for in the next turn when\nthe original speaker becomes aware of their \u2018reflexive\naccountability\u2019. But, again, feasibility of implementation has\nto wait for a model with some predictive power.\n\nAll in all, the concepts of commitment, liability (including legal\nliability) and accountablity are beginning to get to the forefront of\nphilosophy of language, pragmatics, and contextualist semantics (and\nas such, necessarily, also metasemantics and metapragmatics, see\nJaszczolt 2022), and take the concept of defaultness with them to the\nnew dynamic, interactive dimension. The offshoots of those debates are\nample. For example, they open up new perspectives on such questions as\nwhat counts as an assertion, insult, slur, or a lie: what kind of\ncontent ought we to include, and, on the other hand, what norms ought\nwe to adopt? Here are a few snapshots.\n\nSanford Goldberg asks what constitutes the speech act of assertion,\nand what epistemic norm assertion should satisfy. He says that\nassertions are \u201cspeech acts in which a given proposition is\npresented as true, where this presentation has certain\nforce (what we might call assertoric force)\u201d\n(Goldberg 2015: 5) and that \u201c[i]t is mutually manifest to\nparticipants in a speech exchange that assertion has a robustly\nepistemic norm; that is, that one must: assert that p, only if E(one,\n[p])\u201d (p.96), where \u2018E\u2019 stands for a description of\na mutually manifest epistemic standard. But this opens up the question\nas to what counts as asserted content, for linguistic as well as\nsocial, legal, and ethical purposes. Is it merely minimal content?\nBut, perhaps, there is no such thing as minimal content in that here\nare no core meanings, no context-free concepts (cf. Rayo 2013)? Or,\nperhaps, one ought to opt for Levinson-style presumptive meanings\n(Section 1.3), or context-driven defaults (Sections 1.7\u20131.8), or even\ninteractive meanings that emerge thanks to salience and defaultness of\ncertain interpretations (Section 4)? Scope for theorizing and\nexperimentation is still ample.\n\nRelatedly, default meaning is an important concept for the discussion\nof deception, such as lying and misleading. Insincerity has recently\nengendered heated debates in linguistic pragmatics in that it is a\nmoot point what exactly counts as lying. For example, is lying saying\nsomething that the speaker believes to be false? Or is it saying\nsomething with an intention to deceive but the content of which need\nnot necessarily be false (see e.g., Stokke 2018)? And, what exactly\ncounts as \u2018saying\u2019 for the purpose of lying (see e.g Saul\n2012)? Further, can one lie through implicatures and presuppositions\n(Meibauer 2014)? And perhaps we ought to venure even further. As\nHeffer (2020: 6) says, \u201c\u2026we need to extend the\nscope of untruthfulness both from utterance insincerity\n(lying and misleading) to discursive insincerity (withholding), and\nfrom intentional insincerity to epistemic irresponsibility\u201d (see\nalso Carson 2010). Epistemic sincerity is the default in ordinary,\n\u2018non-strategic\u2019 contexts, so, lying, misleading, and\nbullshitting (that is, speaking without regard for truth or falsehood)\ncan easily go through. But here the question as to what exact meaning\nthe speaker is accountable for is intimately related to the question\nof conversational salience and defaults.\n\nNow, it appears that for the debates at a crossroads of theory of\nmeaning and ethics, the crucial understanding of defaultness is that\nof salient emergent meaning in conversation. As we have seen here,\nsuch defaults can be abused \u2013 a topic that is of interest to\npragmatics as well as to theories of argumentation. Let us consider\none more snapshot, this time an example of an argumentative strategy\nof decontextualisation, where instead of inferring the default\ninterpretation (in the sense of the automatic, most salient\ninterpretation for the context), the addressee reacts to the\ndecontextualized semantic content of the speaker\u2019s utterance.\nThis is traditionally called \u2018the fallacy of ignoring\nqualifications\u2019 (secundum quid or secundum quid et\nsimpliciter, loosely translatable as \u2018what is true in a way\nand what is true absolutely\u2019. It is a form of deceit that, as\nMacagno (2022) argues, is best explicated in a broader pragmatic\ncontext of ignoring not only what is explicit but also of what is\nimplicit:\n\nAccording to this view, the secundum quid does not result\nfrom the \u2018suppression\u2019 or \u2018ignoring\u2019 of\nexplicit qualifications or evidence (\u2026); rather, it is\ncommitted when an implicit qualification is reconstructed in a way\nthat was not intended and could not be presumed. (Macagno 2022: 6)\n\n\nAs he says, post-Gricean pragmatic theories are indispensable here for\nexplaining how this form of manipulation works, in that they can\ninvoke principles and heuristics of how the intended meaning is\nrecovered by the addressee. He focuses on contextualist accounts that\ncapture the proposition expressed, or Recanati\u2019s what is said\nand Sperber and Wilson\u2019s explicature. Secundum quid is\nexplained as a strategy of manipulation that makes use of the\npragmatic process of enrichment, but relying not on the\nassumptions shared by the interlocutors but instead substituting\nunwarranted, strategically chosen ones:\n\nThe qualified or absolute interpretations are fallacious because they\nare different from the \u2018default\u2019, \u2018salient\u2019,\nor more generally \u2018plain\u2019 meaning. (Macagno 2022: 7)\n\n\nThe importance of such defaults for argumentation theory requires no\nfurther defence.\n",
