    "main_text": "Probability || Infinitude in the interpretations of probability\n6.2 Infinitude in the interpretations of probability\n\nInfinitary considerations also enter into certain\ninterpretations of probability\u2014attempts to explain what\nprobabilities are and what probability statements mean. (See the entry\non\n interpretations of probability\n for more details on what follows.) Hypothetical frequentism\nregards probabilities as limiting relative frequencies in hypothetical\ninfinite sequences of trials. For example, we may toss a coin\nrepeatedly, generating a sequence of outcomes\u2014e.g.\n\nheads, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads, \u2026\n\nWe can keep track after each trial of the relative frequency of heads\nso far: the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of\ntosses. In our example, the sequence of relative frequencies is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{3}{6}, \\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{4}{8}, \\ldots \\]\n\n\nWe may then imagine this sequence extended indefinitely, and identify\nthe probability of heads with the limit of this sequence. However, the\nvery same results may be reordered, one way or another, to generate\nany limiting relative frequency in [0, 1] whatsoever, if there are\ninfinitely many heads and infinitely many tails. Infinitude rears its\nugly head here\u2014for a finite sequence, reordering can make no\ndifference to the relative frequencies of its outcomes.\n\nAccording to Popper\u2019s propensity interpretation, a\nprobability \\(p\\) of an outcome of a certain type is a propensity of a\nrepeatable experiment to produce outcomes of that type with limiting\nrelative frequency \\(p\\). Again, infinitude is central to this\ninterpretation, and its ugly head rears as it did for hypothetical\nfrequentism. The best-system interpretation of probability,\nassociated with Lewis (1994) and others, is also prey to problems if\nthere are infinitely many events of a particular kind in the\nuniverse\u2014for example, infinitely many coin tosses. As Elga\n(2004) shows, the interpretation\u2019s central notion of\nfit is compromised. And even the subjective probabilities of\nidealized rational agents have tacit infinitary assumptions underlying\nthem\u2014for example, that the agents are logically omniscient, and\ntheir probability assignments are infinitely sharp (single real\nnumbers). These assumptions have also been regarded as problematic,\nespecially when modeling agents who are anything like us.\n",
