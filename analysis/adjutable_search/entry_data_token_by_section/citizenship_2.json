    "main_text": "Dimensions of citizenship || The feminist critique\n1.3 The feminist critique\n\nSince the 1970s, feminist theorists have sharply criticized the\nrepublican and liberal models\u2019 shared assumption of a rigid\nseparation between the private and the public spheres. Their critique\nhas provided the impetus to the development of alternative conceptions\nof politics and citizenship.\n\nIn its classical formulation, the republican conception sees the\npublic/political sphere as the realm of liberty and equality: it is\nthere that free, male citizens engage with their peers and deliberate\nover the common good, deciding what is just or unjust, advantageous or\nharmful (Aristotle Politics, 1253a11). The political space\nmust be protected from the private sphere, defined as the domain of\nnecessity and inequality, where the material reproduction of the\npolis is secured. Women, associated with the \u2018natural\nworld\u2019 of reproduction, are denied citizenship and relegated to\nthe household.\n\nFeminists have criticized this rigid division as mythical since both\nthe separation itself and the radically unequal conception of the\nhousehold that it presupposed \u201cwere clearly the outcome of\npolitical decisions made in the public sphere\u201d (Okin 1992, 60).\nIf the division ostensibly made it possible for citizens to engage\nwith each other as equals, feminists doubt whether it ever was the\nideal way of achieving this goal. Hence Susan Okin\u2019s question to\nrepublicans: \u201cWhich is likely to produce better citizens,\ncapable of acting as each other\u2019s equals? Having to deal with\nthings part of the time \u2014 even the \u2018mundane\u2019 things\nof daily life? Or treating most people as things?\u201d\n(Okin 1992, 64\u201365). An egalitarian family is a much more fertile\nground for equal citizens than one organized like a school for\ndespotism (J.S. Mill); if this means that the political space cannot\nremain insulated from the world of things, there\u2019s no great\nloss.\n\nThe liberal model, for its part, gives primacy to the private sphere.\nPolitical liberty is seen in instrumental terms: the formal rights of\nindividuals secure the private sphere from outside interference,\nallowing the free pursuit of their particular interests (Dietz 1998,\n380\u201381). However, the neutral language of Lockean egalitarian\nindividualism hides the reality of women\u2019s subjection:\n\u201cwoman\u2019s sphere\u201d can be read as \u201cmale\nproperty\u201d since wives are described as naturally subordinated to\ntheir husbands. Here as well, the division between private and public\nhas prevented women from gaining access to the public (Pateman 1989,\n120; Dietz 1998, 380\u201381; Okin 1991, 118).\n\nSince the public and private \u201care, and always have been,\ninextricably connected\u201d (Okin 1992, 69), the upshot of the\nfeminist critique is not simply to make models of citizenship\ninclusive by recognizing that women are individuals or to acknowledge\nthat they too can be citizens. Rather, we must see how laws and\npolicies structure personal circumstances (e.g. laws about rape and\nabortion, child-care policies, allocation of welfare benefits, etc.)\nand how some \u2018personal problems\u2019 have wider significance\nand can only be solved collectively through political action (Pateman\n1989, 131). This does not make the distinction irrelevant and the\ncategories collapsible. However, it does mean that the boundaries\nbetween public and private should be seen as a social construction\nsubject to change and contestation and that their hierarchical\ncharacterization should be resisted.\n\nOnce the abstractions that characterize both the classical and the\nliberal conceptions are discarded, the citizen sheds his\n\u201cpolitical lion skin\u201d (Pateman 1989, 92 quoting Marx 1843)\nand appears as \u201csituated\u201d in a social world characterized\nby differences of gender, class, language, race, ethnicity, culture,\netc. To accept that politics cannot and should not be insulated from\nprivate/social/economic life is not to dissolve the political, but,\nrather, to revive it since anything is as political as citizens choose\nto make it. This contextualized conception of the political has\ninformed much of the criticism aimed at the universalist model of\ncitizenship and has inspired the formulation of a differentialist\nalternative.\n",
