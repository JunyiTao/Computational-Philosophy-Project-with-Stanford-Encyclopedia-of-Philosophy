    "main_text": "\n\nIn light of logic\u2019s historical roots in dialogue and\nargumentation, games and logic are a natural fit. Argumentation is a\ngame-like activity that involves taking turns, saying the right things\nat the right time, and, in competitive settings, has clear pay-offs in\nterms of winning and losing. Pursuing this connection, specialized\nlogic games have already been used in the middle ages as a tool for\nlogic training (Hamblin 1970). The\nmodern area augmented this picture with formal dialogue games as\nfoundation for logic, relating winning strategies in argumentation to\ncogent proofs (Kamlah 1973 [1984]).\nToday, connections between logic and game theory span across a great\nnumber of different strands, involving the interface with game theory,\nbut also linguistics, computer science, and further fields.\n\nThemes from the extensive and growing area surrounding logic and games\noccur in various entries of this Encyclopedia, in particular on\n uses of games in logic,\n epistemic foundations of game theory,\n formal approaches to social procedures,\n logics for analyzing powers of agents, and\n game semantics for programming and process languages.\n These entries differ in their emphasis, which may be on logic, game\ntheory, or foundations of computer science. The present entry is\nconcerned with logics for analyzing games, broadly speaking. It makes\nreference to other perspectives in this Encyclopedia where\nrelevant.\n",
