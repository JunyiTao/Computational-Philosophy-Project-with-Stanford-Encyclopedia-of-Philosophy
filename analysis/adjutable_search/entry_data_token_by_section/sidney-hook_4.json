    "main_text": "The Pragmatic Philosopher as Public Intellectual\n5. Hook\u2019s Place in the History of Pragmatism\n\nAccording to a narrative that is common in contemporary accounts of\n20th Century philosophy in America, pragmatism fell into decline\nshortly following World War II. Professional philosophy, it is said,\nhad become dominated by the pretensions to formalism and precision\nthat is the mark of the \u201canalytic philosophy\u201d that had\nemigrated from the UK. Turning to technical topics in the philosophy\nof language, philosophy of mind, and epistemology, American\nphilosophers abandoned the vision of philosophy as a publicly engaged\npractice of social critique that had been championed by Dewey, opting\ninstead for view of philosophy as a highly specialized and anemically\nacademic discipline. Pragmatism, this account has it, was\n\u201ceclipsed\u201d and \u201cmarginalized\u201d by analytic\nphilosophy. The popular account continues that in the 1980s,\npragmatism was revived in the form of the \u201cneo-pragmatism\u201d\nproposed by Richard Rorty, Cornel West, Hilary Putnam, and Stanley\nCavell, among others. However, when this account is presented by\nadvocates of the tradition of \u201cclassical\u201d pragmatism, the\nemphasis is placed on the allegation that neo-pragmatism is no true\npragmatism at all, but a counterfeit of the movement begun by Perice,\nJames, and Dewey. According to those allied with the classical\npragmatists, pragmatism remains in eclipse. Hence there has emerged a\nsignificant \u201cback to Dewey\u201d movement within contemporary\nAmerican philosophy, a movement that overtly sets itself in opposition\nto mainstream analytic philosophy and seeks to reestablish\npragmatism\u2019s predominance.\n\nWhat is puzzling in all of this is that those invested in the idiom of\nclassical pragmatism nearly always write Sidney Hook out of\npragmatism\u2019s history. Once Hook is acknowledged, one sees the\nDeweyan vision of philosophy thriving throughout the period of alleged\nmarginalization. That is, one finds in Hook not only a high-profile\npublicly engaged philosopher employing the methods of experimental\ninquiry to present social problems, but also an influential academic\nphilosopher engaged with the professional debates of his day, and\noften making necessary concessions and adjustments to the pragmatist\ncommitments in light of new objections and evidence. Although\nHook\u2019s results do not always reflect \u201cchapter and\nverse\u201d Deweyanism, they do retain what is far more important,\nnamely, the unflagging commitment to the application of experimental\nintelligence to the social and political problems of the day.\n\nSeveral new studies of the history and mid-century development of\npragmatism have appeared recently, including the landmark work of\nCheryl Misak, which does much to dislodge the dominant \u201ceclipse\nnarrative\u201d and recast pragmatism as continuous with the\nmainstream trends within the so-called \u201canalytic\u201d\nphilosophy of C. I. Lewis, Nelson Goodman, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald\nDavidson. Nonetheless, apart from a suggestive but still only\npreliminary discussion by Cornel West in his study of American\npragmatism, Sidney Hook\u2019s place in the pragmatist story remains\nlargely unexplored.\n",
