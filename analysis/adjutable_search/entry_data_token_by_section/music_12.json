    "main_text": "Music and Value || Music\u2019s Artistic Value\n5.2 Music\u2019s Moral Value\n\nThere are musical aspects or elements of many uncontroversially\nrepresentational art forms, such as song. Jeanette Bicknell (2015:\n81\u201391) and Aaron Smuts (2013) discusses the ethics of song\nperformance. But there has been little discussion, in the analytic\ntradition, of the relationship between musical and ethical values (as\nopposed to musical examples of more general ethical concerns, such as\ncultural appropriation). Kathleen Higgins (1991, 2012) and Roger\nScruton (1997: 457\u2013508) argue in very different ways that music\nis \u2013 or should be \u2013 central to our thinking about ethics.\nGarry Hagberg has explored many connections between improvisatory jazz\npractice, ethics, and politics (2002, 2006, 2008, 2021; see also\nHiggins 1991: 177). Peter Kivy (2008) argues against music\u2019s\ncapacity to affect our moral knowledge, behavior, or character.\nJerrold Levinson (2013: 51\u20135), Philip Alperson (2014), and James\nHarold (2016) defend music\u2019s moral efficacy.\n\nThe debate over whether an artwork\u2019s moral flaws are artistic\nflaws has focused almost exclusively on representational (especially\nnarrative) art forms. (Gaut (2007) offers an excellent overview.)\nMusic has largely been ignored because it has been assumed to lack\nsufficient representational capacity to embody an attitude toward some\nobject. Maria Jos\u00e9 Alcaraz Le\u00f3n (2012), however, argues\nthat music\u2019s emotional expressiveness is enough to apply\narguments about whether moral flaws are artistic flaws to pure\ninstrumental music. (For critical discussion, see Kania 2020:\n254\u20135.) Musicologist Susan McClary argues that canonical works\nof instrumental classical music oppress women by expressing a positive\nattitude toward narratives of the subjection of feminine elements\n(e.g., certain musical themes) by masculine ones. (See, for example,\nMcClary 1991: 19\u201323, 53\u201379; for critical discussion, see\nMaus (2011).)\n",
