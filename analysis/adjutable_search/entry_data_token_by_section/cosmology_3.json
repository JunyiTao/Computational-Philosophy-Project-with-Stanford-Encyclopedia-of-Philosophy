    "main_text": "Cosmology\u2019s Standard Model || Historical Epochs\n1.3 Historical Epochs\n\nThe SM\u2019s account of the evolution of the matter and radiation in\nthe universe reflects the dynamical effect of expansion. Consider a\ncube of spacetime in the early universe, filled with matter and\nradiation. The dynamical effects of the universe\u2019s expansion are\nlocally the same as slowly stretching the cube. For some stages of\nevolution the contents of the cube interact sufficiently quickly that\nthey reach and stay in local thermal equilibrium as the cube changes\nvolume. (Because of isotropy, equal amounts of matter and radiation\nenter and leave the cube from neighboring cubes.) But when the\ninteractions are too slow compared to the rate of expansion, the cube\nchanges volume too rapidly for equilibrium to be maintained. As a\nresult, particle species \u201cfreeze out\u201d and decouple, and\nentropy increases. Without a series of departures from equilibrium,\ncosmology would be boring\u2014the system would remain in equilibrium\nwith a state determined solely by the temperature, without a trace of\nthings past. The rate of expansion of the cube varies with cosmic\ntime. Because radiation, matter, and a cosmological constant term (or\ndark energy) dilute with expansion at different rates, an expanding\nuniverse naturally falls into separate epochs, characterized by\ndifferent expansion rates.\n\nThere are several distinctive epochs in the history of the universe,\naccording to the SM, including the following:\n\n Quantum gravity: Classical general relativity is\nexpected to fail at early times, when quantum effects will be crucial\nin describing the gravitational degrees of freedom. There is\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding physics at this scale.\n Inflation: A period of exponential, quasi-De Sitter\nexpansion driven by an \u201cinflaton\u201d field (or fields),\nleading to a uniform, almost flat universe with Gaussian linear nearly\nscale invariant density perturbations. During inflation pre-existing\nmatter and radiation are rapidly diluted; the universe is repopulated\nwith matter and energy by the decay of the inflaton field into other\nfields at the end of inflation (\u201cre-heating\u201d).\n Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: At \\(t \\approx 1\\) second, the\nconstituents of the universe include neutrons, protons, electrons,\nphotons, and neutrinos, tightly coupled and in local thermal\nequilibrium. Synthesis of light elements occurs during a burst of\nnuclear interactions that transpire as the universe falls from a\ntemperature of roughly \\(10^9\\) K to \\(10^8\\) K after neutrinos fall\nout of equilibrium and consequent onset of neutron decay. The\npredicted light-element abundances depend on physical features of the\nuniverse at this time, such as the total density of baryonic matter\nand the baryon to photon ratio. Agreement between theory and\nobservation for a specific baryon to photon ratio (Steigman 2007) is a\ngreat success of the SM.\n Decoupling: As the temperature drops below \\(\\approx\n4,000 K\\), electrons become bound in stable atoms, and photons\ndecouple from the matter with a black-body spectrum. With the\nexpansion of the universe, the photons cool adiabatically but retain a\nblack-body spectrum with a temperature \\(T \\propto 1/R\\). This\n\u201ccosmic background radiation\u201d (CBR) has been aptly called\nthe cosmic Rosetta stone because it carries so much information about\nthe state of the universe at decoupling (Ade et al. 2016).\n Dark Ages: After decoupling, baryonic matter consists\nalmost entirely of neutral hydrogen and helium. Once the first\ngeneration of stars form, the dark ages come to an end with light from\nthe stars, which re-ionizes the universe.\n Structure Formation: Cold dark matter dominates the\nearly stages of the formation of structure. Dark matter halos provide\nthe scaffolding for hierarchical structure formation. The first\ngeneration of stars aggregate into galaxies, and galaxies into\nclusters. Massive stars end their lives in supernova explosions and\nspread through space heavy elements that have been created in their\ninteriors, enabling formation of second generation stars surrounded by\nplanets.\n Dark Energy Domination: Dark energy (or a non-zero\ncosmological constant) eventually comes to dominate the expansion of\nthe universe, leading to accelerated\n expansion.[13]\n This expansion will be never-ending if the dark energy is in fact a\ncosmological constant.\n\n",
