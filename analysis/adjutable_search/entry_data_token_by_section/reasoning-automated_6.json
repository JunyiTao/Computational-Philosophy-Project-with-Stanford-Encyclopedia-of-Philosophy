    "main_text": "Deduction Calculi || Natural Deduction\n2.3 Natural Deduction\n\nAlthough LK and NK are both commonly labeled as \u201cnatural\ndeduction\u201d systems, it is the latter which better deserves the\ntitle due to its more natural, human-like, approach to proof\nconstruction. The rules of NK are typically presented as acting on\nstandard logic formulas in an implicitly understood context, but they\nare also commonly given in the literature as acting more explicitly on\n\u201cjudgements\u201d, that is, expressions of the form\n\u0393\u00a0\u22a2\u00a0\u03b1 where \u0393 is a set of formulas\nand \u03b1 is a formula. This form is typically understood as making\nthe metastatement that there is a proof of \u03b1 from \u0393\n(Kleene 1962). Following Gentzen 1935 and Prawitz 1965 here we take\nthe former approach. The system NK has no logical axioms and provides\ntwo introduction-elimination rules for each logical connective:\n\n\n Introduction Rules (\u0398I)\n Elimination Rules (\u0398E)\n\n\n&I\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1 \n\n\u03b2  \n\n \u03b1\n& \u03b2  \n \n&E\n\n\n\n\n\u03b11 & \u03b12\n \n\n\n\u03b1i (for i = 1,2)  \n  \n\n\u2228I\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1i (for i =\n1,2)  \n\n \u03b11 \u2228 \u03b12  \n \n\u2228E\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 \n\n[\u03b1 \u2014 \u03b3] \n\n[\u03b2 \u2014 \u03b3]  \n\n \u03b3\n \n  \n\n\u2283I\n\n\n\n\n[\u03b1 \u2014 \u03b2]  \n\n \u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2\n \n \n\u2283E\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1 \n\n\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2  \n\n \u03b2  \n  \n\n\u2261I\n\n\n\n\n[\u03b1 \u2014 \u03b2] \n\n[\u03b2 \u2014 \u03b1]  \n\n \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2  \n \n\u2261E\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1i (i = 0,1) \n\n\u03b10 \u2261 \u03b11  \n\n \u03b11\u2212i  \n  \n\n~I\n\n\n\n\n[\u03b1 \u2014 \u22a5]  \n\n ~\u03b1  \n \n~E\n\n\n\n\n[~\u03b1 \u2014 \u22a5]  \n\n \u03b1  \n  \n\n\u2203I\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1(t/x)  \n\n\n\u2203x\u03b1(x)  \n \n\u2203E\n\n\n\n\n\u2203x\u03b1(x) \n\n[\u03b1(a/x) \u2014 \u03b2]  \n\n \u03b2  \n  \n\n\u2200I\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1(a/x)  \n\n\n\u2200x\u03b1(x)  \n \n\u2200E\n\n\n\n\n\u2200x\u03b1(x)  \n\n\n\u03b1(t/x)  \n  \n\n\nA few remarks: First, the expression\n[\u03b1\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u03b3] represents the fact that \u03b1\nis an auxiliary assumption in the proof of \u03b3 that eventually\ngets discharged, i.e. discarded. For example, \u2203E tells us that\nif in the process of constructing a proof one has already derived\n\u2203x\u03b1(x) and also \u03b2 with\n\u03b1(a/x) as an auxiliary assumption then the\ninference to \u03b2 is allowed. Second, the eigenparameter,\na, in \u2203E and \u2200I must be foreign to the premises,\nundischarged\u2014\u201cactive\u201d\u2014assumptions, to the\nrule\u2019s conclusion and, in the case of \u2203E, to\n\u2203x\u03b1(x). Third, \u22a5 is shorthand for\ntwo contradictory formulas, \u03b2 and ~\u03b2. Finally, NK is\ncomplete: If \u0393\u00a0 \u22a8\u00a0\u00a0\u03b1 then there is a\nproof of \u03b1 from \u0393 using the rules of NK.\n\nAs in LK, proofs constructed in NK are represented as trees with the\nproof\u2019s conclusion sitting at the root of the tree, and the problem\u2019s\nassumptions sitting at the leaves. (Proofs are also typically given as\nsequences of judgements, \u0393\u00a0\u22a2\u00a0\u03b1, running\nfrom the top to the bottom of the printed page.) Here is a natural\ndeduction proof tree of \u2203xR(x) from\n\u2200x(P(x) \u2228\nQ(x)), \u2200x(P(x)\n\u2283 R(x)) and\n\u2200x(Q(x) \u2283\nR(x)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200x(P(x)\u2228Q(x))\n \n\n P(a)\u2228Q(a)  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200x(P(x)\u2283R(x))\n \n\n P(a)\u2283R(a)  \n \n\n[P(a)\u2014R(a)]  \n\n R(a)  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200x(Q(x)\u2283R(x))\n \n\n Q(a)\u2283R(a)  \n \n\n[Q(a)\u2014R(a)]  \n\n R(a)  \n  \n\n\n R(a)\n\n \n\n\n \u2203xR(x) \n \n\n\n\nAs in LK, a forward-chaining strategy for proof construction is not\nwell focused. So, although proofs are read forwards, that is,\nfrom leaves to root or, logically speaking, from assumptions to\nconclusion, that is not the way in which they are typically\nconstructed. A backward-chaining strategy implemented by\napplying the rules in reverse order is more effective. Many of the\nobstacles that were discussed above in the implementation of sequent\ndeduction are applicable to natural deduction as well. These issues\ncan be handled in a similar way, but natural deduction introduces some\nissues of its own. For example, as suggested by the \u2283-Introduction\nrule, to prove a goal of the form \u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2 one could\nattempt to prove \u03b2 on the assumption that \u03b1. But note that\nalthough the goal \u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2 does not match the conclusion\nof any other introduction rule, it matches the conclusion of all\nelimination rules and the reasoning program would need to\nconsider those routes too. Similarly to forward-chaining, here there\nis the risk of setting goals that are irrelevant to the proof and that\ncould lead the program astray. To wit: What prevents a program from\nentering the never-ending process of building, say, larger and larger\nconjunctions? Or, what is there to prevent an uncontrolled chain of\nbackward applications of, say, \u2283-Elimination? Fortunately, NK\nenjoys the subformula property in the sense that each\nformula entering into a natural deduction proof can be restricted to\nbeing a subformula of \u0393 \u222a \u0394 \u222a {\u03b1}, where\n\u0394 is the set of auxiliary assumptions made by the ~-Elimination\nrule. By exploiting the subformula property a natural deduction\nautomated theorem prover can drastically reduce its search space and\nbring the backward application of the elimination rules under control\n(Portoraro 1998, Sieg & Byrnes 1996). Further gains can be realized\nif one is willing to restrict the scope of NK\u2019s logic to its\nintuitionistic fragment where every proof has a normal form in the\nsense that no formula is obtained by an introduction rule and then is\neliminated by an elimination rule (Prawitz 1965).\n\nImplementations of automated theorem proving systems using NK\ndeduction have been motivated by the desire to have the program reason\nwith precisely the same proof format and methods employed by the human\nuser. This has been particularly true in the area of education where\nthe student is engaged in the interactive construction of formal\nproofs in an NK-like calculus working under the guidance of a theorem\nprover ready to provide assistance when needed (Portoraro 1994, Suppes\n1981). Other, research-oriented, theorem provers true to the spirit of\nNK exist (Pelletier 1998) but are rare.\n",
