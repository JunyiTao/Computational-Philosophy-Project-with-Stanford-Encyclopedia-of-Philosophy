    "main_text": "Political Thought || The Concept of Liberty\n5.1 The Concept of Liberty\n\nBerlin\u2019s best-known contribution to political theory is his\nessay on the distinction between positive and negative liberty. This\ndistinction is explained, and the vast literature on it summarised,\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia; the following therefore focuses only\non Berlin\u2019s original argument, which has often been\nmisunderstood, in part because of his own ambiguities. It should be\nstressed that the essay in question is principally concerned with\npolitical liberty, not with what, late in life, he dubbed\n\u2018basic liberty\u2019, which is freedom of choice (or free\nwill), without which any other kinds of liberty would be impossible:\nindeed, \u2018which men cannot be without and remain men\u2019 (A\n518; cf. UD 218, CTH2 309, and 2.4 above).\n\nIn Two Concepts of Liberty Berlin sought to explain the\ndifference between two (out of more than two hundred, he said)\ndifferent ways of thinking about political liberty. These, he said,\nhad run through modern thought, and were central to the ideological\nstruggles of his day. Berlin called these two conceptions of liberty\nnegative and\n positive.[23]\n Berlin\u2019s treatment of these concepts was less than fully\neven-handed from the start: while he defined negative liberty fairly\nclearly and simply, he gave positive liberty two different basic\ndefinitions, from which still more distinct conceptions would branch\nout. Negative liberty Berlin initially defined as freedom\nfrom, that is, the absence of constraints on the agent imposed by\nother people. Positive liberty he defined both as freedom to,\nthat is, the ability (not just the opportunity) to pursue and achieve\nwilled goals; and also as autonomy or self-rule, as opposed to\ndependence on others. These are not the same.\n\nBerlin\u2019s account was further complicated by combining conceptual\nanalysis with history. He associated negative liberty with the liberal\ntradition as it had emerged and developed in Britain and France from\nthe seventeenth century to the early nineteenth. He later regretted\nthat he had not made more of the evils that negative liberty had been\nused to justify, such as exploitation under laissez-faire capitalism;\nin Two Concepts, however, negative liberty is portrayed\nfavourably, and briefly. It is on positive liberty that Berlin\nfocused, since it was, he claimed, both a more ambiguous concept, and\none which had been subject to greater and more sinister\ntransformation, and ultimately perversion.\n\nBerlin traced positive liberty back to theories that focus on the\nautonomy, or capacity for self-rule, of the\n agent.[24]\n Of these, he found Rousseau\u2019s theory of liberty particularly\ndangerous. For, in Berlin\u2019s account, Rousseau had equated\nfreedom with self-rule, and self-rule with obedience to the so-called\n\u2018general will\u2019. By this, Berlin alleged, Rousseau meant,\nessentially, the common or public interest \u2013 that is, what was\nbest for all citizens qua citizens. The general will was quite\nindependent of, and would often be at odds with, the particular wills\nof individuals, who, Rousseau charged, were often deluded as to their\nown genuine interests.\n\nThis view clashed with Berlin\u2019s political and moral outlook in\ntwo ways. First, it posited the existence of a unique,\n\u2018true\u2019 public interest, a single set of arrangements that\nwas best for all citizens, and was thus opposed to the main thrust of\npluralism. Second, it rested on a bogus transformation of the concept\nof the self. In his doctrine of the general will Rousseau moved from\nthe conventional and, Berlin insisted, correct view of the self as\nindividual to the self as citizen \u2013 which for Rousseau meant the\nindividual as member of a larger community, an individual whose\nidentity and well-being were exactly the same as those of the larger\ncommunity. Rousseau transformed the concept of the self\u2019s will\nfrom what the empirical individual actually desires to what the\nindividual as citizen ought to desire, that is, what is in\nindividuals\u2019 real best interest, whether they realise it or\nnot.\n\nFor Berlin, this transformation became more sinister still in the\nhands of Kant\u2019s German disciples. Kant himself had identified\n\u2018positive\u2019 freedom with autonomy, or self-determination,\nby the rational personality \u2013 the self freed from all that\nrenders it \u2018heteronymous\u2019 and irrational. Later German\nphilosophers influenced by Kant went further in identifying the\n\u2018self\u2019 whose self-determination constitutes freedom with\nentities other than the individual. Freedom becomes a matter of\novercoming the poor, flawed, false, empirical self \u2013 what one\nappears to be and want \u2013 in order to realise one\u2019s\n\u2018true\u2019, \u2018real\u2019, \u2018noumenal\u2019 self.\nThis \u2018true\u2019 self may be identified with one\u2019s best\nor true interests, either as an individual or as a member of a larger\ngroup or institution. Thus Fichte (who began as a radically\nindividualist liberal, only to become, later, an ardent, even\nhysterical, nationalist \u2013 an intellectual forefather of Fascism\nand even Nazism) came to equate freedom with the rule of the\n\u2018true\u2019 self understood as the nation, or Volk. On\nthis view, the individual achieves freedom only through renunciation\nof his or her desires and beliefs as an individual and submersion in a\nlarger group. The \u2018true\u2019 self might also be identified\nwith a cause, an idea, or the dictates of rationality, as in the case\nof Hegel\u2019s definition of liberty, which equated it with\nrecognition of, and obedience to, the laws of history as revealed by\nreason. Such theoretical shifts set the stage, for Berlin, for the\nideologies of the totalitarian movements of the twentieth century,\nboth Communist and Fascist\u2013Nazi, which claimed to liberate\npeople by subjecting \u2013 and often sacrificing \u2013 them to\nlarger groups or principles. To do this was the greatest of political\nevils; and to do it in the name of freedom, a political principle that\nBerlin, as a genuine liberal, especially cherished, struck him as a\n\u2018strange [\u2026] reversal\u2019 or \u2018monstrous\nimpersonation\u2019 (2002b, 198, 180). Against this, Berlin\nchampioned, as \u2018truer and more humane\u2019, negative liberty\nand an empirical view of the self.\n\nThis account is subject to serious and plausible objections, on both\nhistorical and conceptual grounds. But beyond the considerable debates\nconcerning the conceptual validity and historical accuracy of\nBerlin\u2019s account (extensively documented in Harris 2002 and\nCrowder 2016), there is considerable misunderstanding of\nBerlin\u2019s own attitudes to the concepts he discussed, and of the\ngoals of his lecture. Berlin has often been interpreted, not entirely\nunreasonably, as a staunch enemy of the concept of positive liberty.\nThis was simply false, and elides opposition to distortions of\npositive liberty with opposition to positive liberty itself. Berlin\nregarded both concepts of liberty as centring on valid claims about\nwhat is necessary and good for human beings; both negative and\npositive liberty were for him genuine values, which might in some\ncases clash, but in other cases could be combined and might even be\nmutually interdependent. Indeed, Berlin\u2019s own earlier\narticulations of his political values included a notable component of\npositive liberty alongside negative liberty (see e.g. 2002b,\n336\u201344). What Berlin attacked were the many ways in which\npositive liberty had been used to justify the denial, betrayal or\nabandonment of both negative liberty and the undistorted forms of\npositive liberty itself. Berlin\u2019s main targets were not positive\nliberty as such, but the metaphysical or psychological assumptions\nwhich, combined with the concept of positive liberty, had led to its\nperversion: monism, and a metaphysical or collective conception of the\nself. Two Concepts of Liberty, and Berlin\u2019s liberalism,\nare therefore based not on championing negative liberty against\npositive liberty, but on advocating individualism, empiricism and\npluralism against collectivism, holism, metaphysical rationalism (cf.\nnote 14a) and monism.\n",
