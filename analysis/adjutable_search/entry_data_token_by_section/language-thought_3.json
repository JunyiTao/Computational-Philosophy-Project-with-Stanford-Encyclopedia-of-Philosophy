    "main_text": "Mental Language || Logical Structure\n1.3 Logical Structure\n\nIn practice, LOT theorists usually adopt a more specific view of the\ncompositional semantics for Mentalese. They claim that Mentalese\nexpressions have\n logical form\n (Fodor 2008: 21). More specifically, they claim that Mentalese\ncontains analogues to the familiar logical connectives (and,\nor, not, if-then, some,\nall, the). Iterative application of logical\nconnectives generates complex expressions from simpler expressions.\nThe meaning of a logically complex expression depends upon the\nmeanings of its parts and upon its logical structure. Thus, LOT\ntheorists usually endorse a doctrine along the following lines:\n\n\nLogically structured mental representations\n(LOGIC): Some mental representations have logical\nstructure. The compositional semantics for these mental\nrepresentations resembles the compositional semantics for logically\nstructured natural language expressions.\n\n\nMedieval LOT theorists used syllogistic and propositional logic to\nanalyze the semantics of Mentalese (King 2005; Normore 1990).\nContemporary proponents instead use the predicate calculus,\nwhich was discovered by Frege (1879 [1967]) and whose semantics was\nfirst systematically articulated by Tarski (1933 [1983]). The view is\nthat Mentalese contains primitive words\u2014including predicates,\nsingular terms, and logical connectives\u2014and that these words\ncombine to form complex sentences governed by something like the\nsemantics of the predicate calculus.\n\nThe notion of a Mentalese word corresponds roughly to the\nintuitive notion of a concept. In fact, Fodor (1998: 70)\nconstrues a concept as a Mentalese word together with its denotation.\nFor example, a thinker has the concept of a cat only if she has in her\nrepertoire a Mentalese word that denotes cats.\n\nLogical structure is just one possible paradigm for the structure of\nmental representations. Human society employs a wide range of\nnon-sentential representations, including pictures, maps, diagrams,\nand graphs. Non-sentential representations typically contain parts\narranged into a compositionally significant structure. In many cases,\nit is not obvious that the resulting complex representations have\nlogical structure. For example, maps do not seem to contain logical\nconnectives (Fodor 1991: 295; Millikan 1993: 302; Pylyshyn 2003:\n424\u20135). Nor is it evident that they contain predicates (Camp\n2018; Rescorla 2009c), although some philosophers contend that they do\n(Blumson 2012; Casati & Varzi 1999; Kulvicki 2015).\n\nTheorists often posit mental representations that conform to COMP but\nthat lack logical structure. The British empiricists postulated\nideas, which they characterized in broadly imagistic terms.\nThey emphasized that simple ideas can combine to form complex ideas.\nThey held that the representational import of a complex idea depends\nupon the representational import of its parts and the way those parts\nare combined. So they accepted COMP or something close to it\n(depending on what exactly \u201cconstituency\u201d amounts\n to).[2]\n They did not say in much detail how compounding of ideas was supposed\nto work, but imagistic structure seems to be the paradigm in at least\nsome passages. LOGIC plays no significant role in their\n writings.[3]\n Partly inspired by the British empiricists, Prinz (2002) and Barsalou\n(1999) analyze cognition in terms of image-like representations\nderived from perception. Armstrong (1973) and Braddon-Mitchell and\nJackson (2007) propose that propositional attitudes are relations not\nto mental sentences but to mental maps analogous in important\nrespects to ordinary concrete maps.\n\nOne problem facing imagistic and cartographic theories of thought is\nthat propositional attitudes are often logically complex (e.g., John\nbelieves that if Pl\u00e1cido Domingo does not sing then either\nGustavo Dudamel will conduct or the concert will be cancelled).\nImages and maps do not seem to support logical operations: the\nnegation of a map is not a map; the disjunction of two maps is not a\nmap; similarly for other logical operations; and similarly for images.\nGiven that images and maps do not support logical operations, theories\nthat analyze thought in exclusively imagistic or cartographic terms\nwill struggle to explain logically complex propositional\n attitudes.[4]\n\nThere is room here for a pluralist position that allows mental\nrepresentations of different kinds: some with logical structure, some\nmore analogous to pictures, or maps, or diagrams, and so on. The\npluralist position is widespread within cognitive science, which\nposits a range of formats for mental representation (Block 1983; Camp\n2009; Johnson-Laird 2004: 187; Kosslyn 1980; Mandelbaum et al. 2022;\nMcDermott 2001: 69; Pinker 2005: 7; Sloman 1978: 144\u201376). Fodor\nhimself (1975: 184\u2013195) suggests a view on which imagistic\nmental representations co-exist alongside, and interact with,\nlogically structured Mentalese expressions.\n\nGiven the prominent role played by logical structure within historical\nand contemporary discussion of Mentalese, one might take LOGIC to be\ndefinitive of LOTH. One might insist that mental representations\ncomprise a mental language only if they have logical\nstructure. We need not evaluate the merits of this terminological\nchoice.\n",
