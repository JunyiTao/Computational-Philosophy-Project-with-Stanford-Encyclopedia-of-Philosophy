    "main_text": "Relations between markets and other institutions || The interrelatedness of institutions\n4.4 The interrelatedness of institutions\n\nThe interrelatedness of markets and other institutions is also\nconfirmed by sociological research on the \u201cvarieties of\ncapitalism\u201d and similar approaches. They argue that rather than\nthere being one \u201cbest\u201d set of institutions, there are\ncertain sets of institutions in the economic and the political realm\nthat fit together better than others: they form \u201cinstitutional\ncomplementarities\u201d. As Hall and Soskice show, one can\ndistinguish \u201cliberal\u201d from \u201ccoordinated\u201d\nmarket economies in which mutually related mechanisms reign with\nregard to areas such as industrial relations between employers and\nemployees (or unions), institutions for vocational training and\neducation, corporate governance, or inter-firm relations. In liberal\nmarket economies, as they predominate in Anglo-Saxon countries, market\nmechanisms are much more pervasive; for example, employment contracts\nare typically shorter. In coordinated market economies, as one finds\nthem for example in continental Europe, other forms of coordination,\ne.g., collective bargaining, play a greater role (Hall and Soskice\n2001). Such interrelations, which can be neglected in highly abstract\ntheorizing, should be taken into account when political philosophers\naddress concrete questions about markets in \u201cnon-ideal\u201d\ntheory (as is done, for example, in Keat 2008). Philosophers have\noften focused on rules and regulations while taking individuals\u2019\npreferences as given, implicitly adopting an \u201ceconomic\u201d\nperspective on markets. But a \u201csociological\u201d perspective,\nin which the generation of preferences and the wider social context\nare also taken into account, allows one to see other ways in which the\noutcomes of markets can be changed. Changes in different institutions,\nin individuals\u2019 preferences, and in the \u201cethos\u201d that\nrules in certain markets should, ideally, go hand in hand and be\nconsistent with one another. It is unlikely that the current problems\nin which markets are involved, such as global justice and climate\nchange, can be solved by relying only on one of these instruments. The\ndesirability and feasibility of different market and non-market\narrangements for addressing these issues, together with questions\nabout the international dimension of markets and how they can be\ngeared towards normative goals such as human flourishing and greater\nequality, are among the most important contemporary research areas\nabout markets.\n",
