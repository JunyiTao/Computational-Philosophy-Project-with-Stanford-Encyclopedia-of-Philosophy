    "main_text": "Hermeneutics and Existence || The Hermeneutics of Facticity\n3.1 The Hermeneutics of Facticity\n\nHeidegger clarifies the role played by hermeneutics in his early\nphenomenological inquiries into human existence through a critical\nreconsideration of Husserl\u2019s classical phenomenology, or more\nspecifically, a critical reconsideration of the aspects of\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology that rely on his transcendental and\neidetic\n methods.[4]\n In this, Heidegger opposes his own \u2018hermeneutical\u2019\nphenomenology against Husserl\u2019s \u2018transcendental\u2019\napproach.\n\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology is guided by epistemological\nconsiderations, and his principal concern is to find a priori\nfoundations for research in the sciences. Husserl believes that modern\nscience, despite all methodological and technological sophistication,\nhas failed to account for the basic epistemic foundation on which it\nrelies. He maintains that this foundation may be discerned in\nconsciousness\u2014not, however, in any factual consciousness or ego,\nbut rather in the transcendental ego and its a priori eidetic\nstructures. He argues that phenomenological inquiry into these\nstructures proceeds methodologically on the basis of what he refers to\nas the \u2018epoch\u00e9.\u2019 The\nepoch\u00e9 is a universal suspension of the \u2018natural\nattitude,\u2019 that is, belief in the existence of objects. The epoch\u00e9 thereby allows us to redirect our awareness to objects in their\nappearance as such. In contrast with Cartesian methodological doubt,\nthe epoch\u00e9 is not a doubt about the existence of\nmind-independent reality, but, instead, a \u2018bracketing\u2019 of\nour belief in existence that frees us to focus on a priori\neidetic structures of appearance (see, for example, Husserl,\nIdeas I, \u00a7\u00a7 27\u201332).\n\nHeidegger\u2019s critical reconsideration of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology is guided not by epistemological concerns, but, instead,\nfundamental ontological ones. Heidegger agrees with Husserl that\nmodern science has failed to account for the grounds on which it\nrelies, and he also turns to phenomenology in order to bring these\ngrounds into focus. Yet, Heidegger believes that phenomenology\nconcerns an origin much deeper than consciousness, the transcendental\nego, and its eidetic structures. For him, phenomenology contributes to\nontology, first of all, by bringing into focus the being, or,\nontological structures, that comprise human existence itself. For the\nearly Heidegger, these structures involve what he calls\n\u2018facticity.\u2019 By this, he does not mean that human\nexistence is a fact. Rather, he means that the ontological structures\nthat comprise human existence are found not in consciousness, but,\ninstead, in our being in the world\u2014or, as he determines this\nterminologically, being-in-the-world (in-der-Welt-sein)\n(Heidegger, Being and Time, \u00a7 12 ff.). Thus, our\nattempts to understand ourselves (or, for that matter, to understand\nanything else) remain bound by structures of being in the world.\nSpecifically, our attempts to understand ourselves (or anything else)\nremain conditioned by pre-structures that determine in advance which\npossibilities of a situation we find significant, and by moods that\ndetermine in advance our attunement to a situation we are\n\u201cthrown\u201d into, that is, a situation that affects us even\nthough we have not chosen to be in it (Heidegger, Being and\nTime, \u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334).\n\nHeidegger, on the basis of his consideration of the facticity of human\nexistence, concludes that it would be a fool\u2019s errand for\nphenomenological inquiry to proceed on the basis of Husserl\u2019s\nepoch\u00e9. After all, the epoch\u00e9 merely\nallows us to reflect on a priori eidetic structures of\nconsciousness, when what we should be after are structures of our\nbeing in the world. Heidegger argues that phenomenological inquiry\nshould begin instead with consideration of these structures of being\nin the world as they come into view through our own individual\ninvolvement in the world. Heidegger\u2019s phenomenology proves to be\nself-interpretation, as it seeks to clarify the structure of being in\nthe world on the basis of nothing else than our own individual\nexperience of being in the world. Thus, phenomenology unfolds as the\nexplication of the structures of being in the world that, initially at\nleast, we experience more or less vaguely, more or less tacitly, in\nour own everyday involvements with things and others. In\nHeidegger\u2019s critical reconsideration of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology, hermeneutics is a possibility of human existence itself\nand, indeed, a possibility that aims at our explication of ourselves\nin our very existence.\n",
