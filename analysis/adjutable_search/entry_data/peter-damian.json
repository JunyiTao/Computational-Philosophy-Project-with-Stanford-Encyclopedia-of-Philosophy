    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nPeter Damian (Petrus Damianus or Petrus Damiani) was born in or\naround 1007 in Ravenna, Italy. He acquired the name Damianus or Damiani\nafter his elder brother Damianus, who cared for him in his youth. Peter\nstudied liberal arts and law in Ravenna, Faenza and Parma, and gained a\nreputation as a teacher of rhetoric. About 1035, Damian experienced a\nreligious conversion and entered the monastery at Fonte Avellana, near\nGubbio. Because of his zealous devotion and his learning, Damian was\nsoon entrusted with administrative and teaching tasks in his own and\nother monasteries. He became prior of Fonte Avellana in 1043, and led\nthe monastery to a new prosperity. Damian developed into one of the\nmost influential persons in the Church of his time who, through his\nwritings and personal contacts, sought to foster monastic reform and\nreform of the Church. In 1057, Damian was nominated Cardinal-Bishop of\nOstia against his will; he was relieved of at least some of the duties\nrelated to the office a few years later. Because of Damian\u2019s rhetorical\nskills and his knowledge of Canon Law, the Pope used him as his legate\non several occasions. Damian died when returning from one such mission\non the 22nd or 23rd of February 1072 in Faenza.\n\n\nPeter Damian was a voluminous writer. The most important part of his\nproduction is his letters, which number 180. Damian\u2019s treatises are\nalso included in the collection of letters because they take the form\nof letters. The only one of Damian\u2019s works which is considered to be of\nphilosophical interest is Letter 119, which is better known as De\ndivina omnipotentia (On Divine Omnipotence). This letter\nis addressed to Abbot Didier of Monte Cassino and his community, and it\nis dated at the beginning of 1065.\n \n\nThe recent book-length studies on Damian\u2019s life and thought by\nMcCready (2011) and Ranft (2012) are not philosophical in orientation,\nbut they can be usefully read to gain an understanding of Damian's\ncareer and his personality.\n2. Passage 612A\u2013B and Damian\u2019s Reputation\n\n\nDamian\u2019s reputation as a thinker who denies the universal validity\nof the principle of non-contradiction goes back to a series of studies\nthat the German scholar J.A. Endres published early in the twentieth\ncentury (Endres 1906, Endres 1910, and some others). This notion is one\nof the central pieces in Endres\u2019s more comprehensive thesis about a\ncontroversy between \u201cdialecticians\u201d and\n\u201canti-dialecticians\u201d in the eleventh century \u2014\n\u201cdialecticians\u201d being thinkers with a rational tendency\nwhile \u201canti-dialecticians\u201d are suspicious of or hostile\ntowards use of secular arts in discussions related to Christian faith.\nPeter Damian is Endres\u2019s prime representative of the anti-dialectical\nattitude. Endres\u2019s interpretation of Damian\u2019s position ultimately\ndepends on a single passage in De divina omnipotentia, passage\n612A\u2013B (in the Migne edition). To better understand that passage, some\npreliminary remarks about the content and aim of De divina\nomnipotentia should be made. (However, see also\n Section 6.)\n\n\nIn De divina omnipotentia, Damian treats two questions\nrelated to divine power: Can God restore virginity to a woman who has\nlost it? Can God bring it about that what has been done has not been\ndone? These questions had been brought up at a mealtime discussion\nduring Damian\u2019s recent visit to the Abbey of Monte Cassino. The first\nquestion was suggested by a passage in a letter by Jerome which had\nbeen read aloud during one of the meals (596C\u2013D). Damian maintained the\nview of divine omnipotence and claimed that God can restore virginity.\nThe second question was suggested by the first one: some people asked\nDamian whether, in his view, God can undo the done; for example, can\nGod bring it about that Rome was never founded (601C)? The general\ntendency in Damian\u2019s treatment is clear: he aims at defending the\ndoctrine of divine omnipotence. It is also clear that Damian\u2019s answer\nto the first question is affirmative: he explicitly and emphatically\ndeclares that God can restore virginity to a woman who has lost it.\n\n\nGiven the information in the previous paragraph, one can construct\nthe following argument for the claim that Damian has to deny the\nuniversal validity of the principle of non-contradiction: (1) Damian\nmaintains that God can restore virginity to a woman who has lost it.\n(2) But restoration of virginity consists in removing those events in\nthe woman\u2019s past that are incompatible with her being a virgin. (3)\nTherefore, Damian has to maintain that God can undo what has been done.\n(4) But the undoing of what has been done involves a contradiction. (5)\nTherefore, Damian has to claim that the principle of non-contradiction\nis not universally valid.\n\n\nThis construction of Damian\u2019s view is not entirely unrelated to the\ntext of De divina omnipotentia. There is a passage in De\ndivina omnipotentia where Damian touches upon the connection\nbetween the question of restoring virginity, the question of undoing\nthe done, and the validity of the principle of non-contradiction, viz.\nthe very passage on which Endres based his view about Damian\u2019s\nposition. The passage reads as follows (the preceding sentences are\nalso included to provide the context):\nLet the quibbling of the impious question be once more put\nforth; let it also be seen from what root it was produced, for then the\nstream that ought to be engulfed by the ground lest it should flood and\nruin the rich fruits of sound faith may just dry out with its source.\nFor in order to prove that God could not restore a virgin after her\nlapse, they add, as if it were a consequence [of the original question]\n(quasi consequenter): for would even God be able to bring it\nabout that what has been done, has not been done? As if [it were so\nthat] if it is ever established that a virgin has been spoilt, it could\nnot happen that she would be intact again. This is assuredly true as\nfar as nature is concerned, and the opinion holds. Also, that something\nhas been done and that the very same thing has not been done cannot be\nthe case. These, to be sure, are contraries to each other in such a way\nthat if one of them is, the other cannot be. For of what has been it\ncannot truly be said that it has not been, and, the other way around,\nof what has not been it is not correctly said that it has been. For\ncontraries cannot coincide in one and the same subject. This\nimpossibility, then, (haec porro inpossibilitas) is indeed\nrightly affirmed if it is attributed to the lack of means of nature,\nbut on no account should it be applied to the divine majesty. For he\nwho has given birth to nature easily removes the necessity of nature\nwhen he wills. (611D\u2013612B).\n\n\nTowards the end of this passage, Damian appears to be saying that\nGod can restore virginity and undo what has been done even if it\nrequires that the principle of non-contradiction is violated. At least\nthis is how Endres interpreted the passage. According to Endres, Damian\ncounts the principle of non-contradiction among the laws of nature; as\nsuch, it belongs to the sphere of the contingent and cannot restrict\nthe agency of God Almighty. Because of this passage, the critique of\ndialectic and other secular arts that Damian presents elsewhere (see,\ne.g., 603C\u2013604A, 610D\u2013611D) acquires a new significance. Damian was not\nsatisfied with simply criticizing the misplaced and mistaken use of\ndialectic in theology; he aimed at denying the possibility of science\nexisting independent of theology (Endres 1906, 30\u201331; 1910, 23\u201330).\n\n\nRecent commentators disagree about the correct interpretation of\n612A\u2013B, but none of them find Endres\u2019s conclusions justified (see,\ne.g., Gonsette 1956, 100\u2013101; Cantin 1972, 139\u2013140, 173\u2013176, 203\u2013206;\nRemnant 1978, 260\u2013261; Resnick 1992, 110\u2013111; Knuuttila 1993, 65\u201366;\nHolopainen 1996, 36\u201339, 42; Gaskin 1997, 232\u2013233, 240\u2013243; closest to\nEndres\u2019s view comes Bauke-Ruegg 1998, 443\u2013451). The problem with\nEndres\u2019s reading of 612A\u2013B is that it fits badly with what Damian says\nelsewhere in De divina omnipotentia. Namely, Damian rejects\nas outrageous the suggestion that God could bring about something that\nviolates the principle of non-contradiction (see\n Section 5.1).\n Either Endres\u2019s reading of 612A\u2013B is\naltogether wrong, or at least the passage does not have the weight that\nEndres wants to give it.\n\n\nThere is a curious feature in Damian\u2019s idea about restoring\nvirginity. Damian talks about kinds of restoration of virginity that do\nnot require any interfering with past events (see\n Section 4).\n This is significant because it ruins our constructed argument\nfor the claim that Damian has to deny the universal validity of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (above, steps [1]\u2013[5]). If Damian does\nnot share the assumption that restoration of virginity consists in\nremoving some events in the past (step [2]), then the two questions in\nDe divina omnipotentia can be treated and answered separately.\nEven though Damian affirms the possibility of restoring virginity, he\nneed not affirm the possibility of undoing the done.\n\n\nPassage 612A\u2013B (or 611D\u2013612B) appears to be connected to this issue.\nThe beginning of the passage shows that Damian intends to make a point\nabout the relation (or unrelatedness) of the two questions in De\ndivina omnipotentia. (By \u201cimpious question\u201d Damian\nmeans the question about undoing the done.) From 612B onwards, Damian\ndiscusses God\u2019s power to reverse the laws of nature and arrives at the\nconclusion that God can restore virginity through a miracle within some\npresent moment of time (cf.\n Section 4).\n As for\nDamian\u2019s claim about \u201cthis impossibility\u201d (haec ...\ninpossibilitas), which applies to nature but not to God, it is not\nclear whether he refers to the impossibility of bringing about\nsomething that violates the principle of non-contradiction or the\nimpossibility of restoring virginity. If he refers to the latter, his\npoint would be to say that God can restore virginity even though it is\nnot possible to undo the done (Holopainen 1996, 36\u201339).\n\n\nPassage 612A\u2013B is too ambiguous to support any substantial claims\nabout Damian\u2019s view; Damian does not deserve his reputation as a\nthinker who denies the universal validity of the principle of\nnon-contradiction in order to defend the divine omnipotence. (At the\nsame time, it must be added that Damian is not quite clear about the\nvalidity of the principle of non-contradiction for those things for\nwhich God is not responsible. See\n Section 5.1.)\n3. Definition of Omnipotence\n\n\nDamian\u2019s central interest in De divina omnipotentia is to\ndefend the doctrine of omnipotence against certain challenges. The\ndefense that Damian offers rests on a specific understanding of what\nconstitutes omnipotence.\n\n\nThe doctrine of omnipotence (omnipotentia) implies that God\n\u201cis capable of everything\u201d (omnia possit; e.g.,\n596C\u2013D, 610C\u2013D). In Damian\u2019s view, it does not follow from the doctrine\nthat we should think that God would be able to do anything whatsoever.\nAdmittedly, there are many things that God cannot do, e.g., God cannot\nlie (e.g., 597C). Lying is an evil thing. In Damian\u2019s view, an agent\nneed not be able to do evil in order to qualify as omnipotent because\nnot being able to do evil is no sign of impotence or inability.\nActually, God cannot do anything that is evil and he can do anything\nthat is good. By \u201comnipotence\u201d, Damian means this ability\nto do anything that is good. This ability can properly be characterized\nas \u201comnipotence\u201d because evil things are\n\u201cnothing\u201d (nihil). To be capable of\n\u201ceverything\u201d (omnia), an agent must be capable of\nanything that is \u201csomething\u201d (aliquid), but he\nneed not be capable of \u201cnothing\u201d (598D\u2013599A, 600A\u2013B,\n610C\u2013D).\n\n\nThe remarks about \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201csomething\u201d\nare related to Damian\u2019s conception of the major metaphysical division\namong things in the world. The things in the world can be divided into\nthe good (bona) and the bad or evil (mala), and these\nare quite different from each other (see 602A\u2013C, 608B\u2013610D, 618B\u2013C).\nWhat is characteristic of good things is that they are (esse)\nand that they are something (aliquid). The good things that\nare have been made by God and are willed by God. Evil things are not\nwilled by God, and they are far away from him. The being of evil is\napparent and not real. Evil things seem to be, but in the testimony of\nthe truth, they are not (non esse); they are not something but\nnothing (nihil). God is not the author of evil, for\n\u201cnothing was made without him\u201d (sine ipso factum est\nnihil, John 1:3).\n\n\nIn some passages, Damian assumes that divine omnipotence can be\ncharacterized as God\u2019s ability to bring about anything that he can\nwill. Because God can will anything that is good, and he cannot will\nanything that is evil, this amounts to the same as the characterization\nof omnipotence as God\u2019s ability to bring about anything that is good\n(cf. 596C\u2013597B, 599A, 600A\u2013B). However, the characterization of\nomnipotence as God's ability to bring about anything that he can will\nreveals an important aspect in Damian\u2019s view of divine power, viz.\ndivine freedom. Damian is very emphatic about God\u2019s freedom in his\ncreative activity. In his omnipotence, God can do anything that is\ngood, but he need not do everything that is good \u2014 he need not do\nanything at all (600B, 605C, 607A; for the Augustinian background, see\nKnuuttila 1993, 66\u201370).\n\n\nGiven Damian\u2019s understanding of omnipotence, it is, in principle,\neasy to determine whether God can do some given thing or not. One just\nhas to find out whether the thing in question is a good thing or a bad\nthing. If it is a good thing, then God can both will it and bring it\nabout. If it is evil, it is something that God cannot even will (cf.\n600B).\n4. Can God Restore Virginity?\n\n\nTo determine whether God can restore virginity, we need to find out\nwhether getting virginity back is a good thing. In Damian\u2019s view, there\nis no doubt about it. As the loss of virginity is an evil, getting\nvirginity back would be a good thing. Since God Almighty can will and\ndo anything that is good, he can will to restore virginity, and he can\nrestore it. This is Damian\u2019s general solution to the first question\n(599C\u2013600B).\n\n\nDamian expands his solution by explaining that there are two\nrelevant ways of understanding what the restoration of virginity means\n(see 600C\u2013601B). Restoring virginity concerns either the fullness of\nmerits (iuxta meritorum plenitudinem) or the integrity of the\nflesh (iuxta carnis integritatem). Restoration of virginity\naccording to merit is possible, maintains Damian, for it consists of\nreturning to the Lord. And, surely, the creator of humans can also\nrepair the damage that the loss of virginity causes to the flesh. Thus,\nDamian can end his main discussion concerning the first question by\nboldly declaring that God can restore virginity to a woman, no matter\nhow many husbands she has had, and that he can also repair the sign of\nvirginity in her flesh, so that it is as good as when she emerged from\nher mother\u2019s womb.\n\n\nAs already intimated (Section 2), the restoration of virginity that\nDamian affirms as possible does not imply any interfering with past\nevents. This goes both for restoration of fullness of merits and\nrestoration of the integrity of the flesh. In the remarks related to\nrestoration of virginity that Damian presents later in De divina\nomnipotentia, he mainly concentrates on the restoration of\nvirginity according to the integrity of the flesh (see 611B\u2013D,\n614C).\n\n\nDamian makes some comparisons that make it clear that the\nrestoration of virginity is a miracle within some present moment of\ntime. Damian says that restoring virginity is a lesser miracle than the\nvirgin birth. The virgin birth is like going through doors without\nopening them; the restoring of virginity is like closing doors that\nhave been opened (611B\u2013C). Damian further compares the virgin birth and\nthe restoration of virginity to the eternal life of Enoch (Sirach\n44:16; Hebrews 11:5) and the resurrection of Lazarus (John 11) (614C).\nWhat seems to be common to the restoration of virginity, the\nresurrection, and the closing of doors is that, in all three cases,\nsomething is restored to its original state. Such a restoration need\nnot affect the past in any way. Restoring virginity does nothing to the\nfact that a woman has lost her virginity and has been without it, as\nthe resurrection of Lazarus does not remove the fact that he has died\nand been dead. Restoration of virginity is an \u201cordinary\u201d\nmiracle comparable to some of the miracles that are reported in the\nBible.\n\n\nIn De divina omnipotentia, Damian presents some systematic\nremarks concerning God\u2019s power to produce miracles. God has sovereign\npower over nature. As the author of nature and its laws, he has\nreserved to himself the right to change the laws of nature according to\nhis free choice and bend them as he wishes. Nature cannot but obey the\nwill of its maker (612B\u2013D). As evidence for this view, Damian\nenumerates a large number of miracles and miraculous phenomena that are\ncontrary to the ordinary laws of nature (612D\u2013614B; cf. 610D\u2013611D). The\ndiscussion ends with the renewed affirmation that God is capable of\nrestoring virginity if he wills (614C). None of the miracles that\nDamian mentions imply that God could undo the done or bring about a\ncontradictory state of affairs. The aim of Damian\u2019s discussion appears\nto be to argue that God can miraculously restore the physical integrity\nof the flesh even though it is not possible to change the past (cf.\n615A\u2013B and\n Section 2).\n5. Can God Undo the Done?\n5.1. Damian\u2019s Main Approach\n\n\nThe second question discussed by Damian in De divina\nomnipotentia asks whether God is able to bring it about that what\nhas been done has not been done. Damian\u2019s discussion of the question is\nsomewhat complicated, and he is not too explicit about what he is\ndoing. There are some interrelated passages which offer what can be\nidentified as Damian\u2019s main approach (601C\u2013610D, 615A\u2013B, 618B\u2013D,\n620C\u2013D). Towards the end, there is a passage which Damian marks as an\nadditional consideration (619A\u2013620C; see\n Section 5.2).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s main approach to the second question is to argue that the\npast cannot be undone because what God has made cannot lose its status\nof having been. Before directly arguing this point, Damian presents two\npreliminary considerations which help to put the question in the proper\nsetting. The first of these preliminary considerations is related to\nsome discussions within the art of dialectic whereas the second is\ntheological in nature.\n\n\nIn the first preliminary consideration (602D\u2013604B; see also 609A and\n615A\u2013B), Damian connects the question about undoing the done to what he\nsays is a disputed question of dialectic, \u201cthe question about the\nconsequence of necessity and impossibility\u201d (quaestio ... de\nconsequentia necessitatis vel inpossibilitatis, 604A).\n\n\nIn Damian\u2019s view, those who have put the question about God\u2019s\nability to undo what has been done have acted impetuously, for they do\nnot understand the import of their query. They are asking whether God\ncan bring it about that what has been done, will not have been done.\nHowever, the kind of impossibility that is implied here concerns not\nonly what is past but also what is present or future. One must also ask\nwhether God can bring it about that what is, is not, or whether he can\nbring it about that what will be, will not be. In Damian\u2019s view, the\nlogic in these questions is the same. The rules of dialectic say that\nfrom the factuality of any statement, regardless of the tense, you can\ninfer its necessity and the impossibility of its contradictory in the\nfollowing manner: what has been, necessarily has been, and it is\nimpossible that it has not been; what is, necessarily is, as long as it\nis, and it is impossible that it is not; what will be, necessarily will\nbe, and it is impossible that it will not be (602D\u2013603B).\n\n\nWhat should one think of the necessity and impossibility which\nfollow from any true singular statement? Does it follow that everything\nhappens of necessity (so that not even God can do anything about it)?\nThere was a disputed question in the dialectic of Damian\u2019s time which\ndealt with these kinds of queries. The root of the question is\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of singular future statements in De\ninterpretatione 9 which the eleventh-century dialecticians read in\nBoethius\u2019s Latin translation. They also knew what Boethius said about\nthe theme in his two commentaries to De interpretatione and in\nPhilosophiae consolatio. These works provide the background\nfor the question that Damian refers to, but the formulation which\nDamian knows appears to be of early medieval invention (see Holopainen\n1999, 230\u2013232; Holopainen 2006). Damian himself says that the question\nis an old question from the liberal arts which has newly been taken up\nagain. However, the contemporary discussion is different from the\nancient one in that the ancients discussed the question purely as a\nquestion of dialectic, whereas the contemporary writers have turned it\ninto a quasi-theological question that has bearing on divine power\n(604A).\n\n\nAnother contemporary source with information about the question is\nthe discussion in Cur deus homo II.17 by Anselm of Canterbury,\nsome thirty years later. Anselm makes a distinction between two kinds\nof necessity: there is preceding necessity (necessitas\npraecedens) and there is subsequent necessity (necessitas\nsequens). Preceding necessity is an efficient kind of necessity,\nand it is the cause of a thing\u2019s being the case. The subsequent\nnecessity does not cause anything, but is caused by a thing\u2019s being the\ncase. The necessity which follows from any true singular statement in\nany tense is subsequent necessity. Anselm\u2019s discussion implies that the\nquestion about the consequence of necessity and impossibility arises\nfrom the failure to keep the two kinds of necessity separate (Knuuttila\n1993, 74; Knuuttila 2004, 122\u2013124; Marenbon 1996, 12\u201316; Holopainen\n1999; Binini 2017, 251\u2013253).\n\n\nDamian does not tell us how the question about the consequence of\nnecessity and impossibility can be resolved. It is possible that he was\nfamiliar with the kind of solution that one can find in Cur deus\nhomo II.17 (see Holopainen 1999, 227\u2013232; Holopainen 2006,\n116\u2013119). At any rate, Damian takes it for granted that the question\ncan be solved in a manner which does not restrain omnipotence for he\nrejects the question as irrelevant to a discussion about divine power\n(604A\u2013B; cf. 609A and 615A\u2013B). In the same context, Damian also makes a\ncomment about applying dialectic to theology: when dialectic and other\nbranches of human knowledge are applied to the investigation of\ntheological matters, they must serve as a maid (ancilla)\nserves her mistress; they must not try to adopt the leading position.\nDamian also accuses his discussion companions of being incompetent in\nthe field of their art: they do not yet know the rudiments of\ndialectic, but nevertheless they try to apply it to theological issues\n(603B\u2013D).\n\n\nThe second preliminary consideration in Damian\u2019s main approach to\nthe second question focuses on divine providence. Drawing mainly on\nAugustine\u2019s writings, Damian presents a lengthy discussion concerning\nGod\u2019s eternity and his relation to created beings (604C\u2013608A; see also\n599A\u2013B and 618C\u2013D). God is immutable, both in himself and in his\nrelation to creation. He is not in any time or place, but all times and\nplaces, as well as all creatures, are contained in \u201cthe treasure\nof God\u2019s wisdom\u201d, or in his providence (providentia). To\nGod there is no past or future; everything is present to him in an\neternal now. To him, nothing changes or moves; everything that streams\nby or goes past in time stands immutably and eternally in his\nprovidence.\n\n\nThe doctrine of divine providence puts the question about changing\nthe past in a new perspective (see 607A\u2013610D). This doctrine warrants\nDamian\u2019s claim that the same considerations apply to things past,\npresent and future, at least when we are discussing God\u2019s power. The\ndoctrine of divine providence also makes it immediately clear what the\nanswer to the second question has to be: the past cannot be changed\nbecause the past events are immutably present in the divine\nprovidential plan which is immutable (607A).\n\n\nTo Damian, asking whether God can undo the done is asking whether\nGod can bring about a contradictory state of affairs. In Damian\u2019s view,\nit is obvious that this is something that God cannot do:\nYou, therefore, while you demand that one and the same\nthing both has been and has not been, is and is not, will be and will\nnot be, you truly strive to confuse everything that has been made or is\nto be made and to show that it wavers between being and non-being.\nCertainly, the nature of things will not tolerate this. For nothing can\nbe and not be at the same time; but what is not in the nature of\nthings, is undoubtedly nothing. You ask, therefore, harsh critic, that\nGod make what is not his, that is to say nothing. But behold! the\nEvangelist stands against you, saying that nothing is made without\nhim (John 1:3). God has not yet learned to make nothing. You,\nteach him, and command him to make nothing for you! (608C; translated\nin Holopainen 1996, 32).\n\n\nThe passage provides a justification for the idea that God\u2019s\ninability to undo what has been done does not contradict his\nomnipotence. In Damian\u2019s view, omnipotence consists of God\u2019s power to\nbring about anything that is good. A contradictory state of affairs\nwould be nothing and evil, and therefore the ability to bring it about\nis not included in omnipotence (cf.\n Section 3).\n\n\nIn another passage (608D\u2013610D), Damian appeals to the efficacy of\nGod\u2019s will to argue that a contradictory state of affairs cannot become\nactualized. Here, different considerations apply to the good and the\nevil (cf.\n Section 3).\n The good things are because God\nwills them to be. God\u2019s will as the efficient cause of the being of\nbeings has such intensity that what he wills to be, cannot not be, and\nwhat he does not will to be, cannot be. Good things, then, are\nunequivocally in the case that they are, and a contradictory state of\naffairs cannot be realized through some good thing\u2019s being and not\nbeing at the same moment. As far as good things are concerned, we can\nsay that the validity of the principle of non-contradiction is a\nconsequence of divine omnipotence: it is an indication of the might of\nGod\u2019s will as the efficient cause of being. The same is true of the\nvalidity of the consequence of necessity and impossibility; what some\npeople see as a limitation to God\u2019s power is really an expression of\nhis power (608D\u2013609A, 610B).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s view is blurry when it comes to the validity of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction for evil things. He states that a\ncontradictory state of affairs cannot be realized through some evil\nthing\u2019s being and not being at the same time. However, he supports this\nstatement by pointing out that the being of evil things is apparent and\nnot real: they cannot both \u201cbe\u201d and \u201cnot be\u201d at\nthe same time because they never have the kind of \u201cbeing\u201d\n(esse) that good things have (610B\u2013C). This leaves open the\npossibility that some evil thing could have and not have its\nquasi-being at the same moment of time (cf. Resnick 1992, 110\u2013111). It\nis not clear whether this is an intended feature of Damian\u2019s view or\nnot. In any case, the issue is not relevant for Damian\u2019s discussion\nabout the power of God because God gives being in an unequivocal\nmanner.\n\nIn the conclusion to his main approach, Damian focuses on the principle\nof non-contradiction as he understands it. He first lets us understand\nthat we need not bother about the evil things. As for the rest, i.e.,\nthe good things, it is outrageous to suggest that their being would not\nbe unequivocal: \n\nWhen therefore this question is proposed, with these words:\n\u201cHow can God bring it about that what has been done will not have\nbeen done\u201d, let a brother of sound faith answer that what has\nbeen done, if it was an evil, was not something but nothing, and on\nthat account it must be said not to have been, because what the Maker\nof things did not order to be, did not have the grounds for existence.\nFor he said, and they were made, he ordered, and they were\ncreated (Psalms 32:9). For everything was made by him, and\nnothing was made without him (John 1:3). And therefore to ask,\n\u201cHow can God make it so that what has been done will not have\nbeen done?\u201d is the same as to ask, \u201cCan God bring it about\nthat what he has made he will not have made?\u201d Undoubtedly, what\nGod has made, God will not have made! Therefore, who utters this is to\nbe spat upon, and he is not worthy of reply, but rather should be\ncondemned to branding. (618B\u2013C; translated in Holopainen 1996,\n40).\n\n\nIn Damian\u2019s view, the past cannot be undone because what God has\nmade cannot lose its status of having been (because God has made what\nhe wanted to make, and his will is immutable in eternity). For the same\nreason, the principle of non-contradiction is universally valid for\neverything which has being from God. Also, the things that have being\nfrom God cannot but be when they are, and therefore the consequence of\nnecessity and impossibility is valid for them (609A).\n5.2. A Supplementary Approach\n\n\nTowards the end of De divina omnipotentia, Damian presents\nan additional approach to the question of undoing the done (619A\u2013620C).\nDamian clearly marks the passage as an additional consideration that\ncan be used to combat those impudent people who are not satisfied with\nhis principal solution (619A). In spite of this, the passage has often\nbeen mistaken for Damian\u2019s principal statement of the matter; in many\nselections from the text, only the additional approach is included\nwhereas Damian\u2019s main approach is omitted (except for the question\nabout the consequence of necessity and impossibility).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s main approach has been to show that divine omnipotence\nremains intact even though God cannot undo the done. In the\nsupplementary approach, he pursues a different strategy: there is a\nsense in which it can be said, and not in a foolish way (non\ninepte), that God \u201ccan\u201d (potest) bring it\nabout that what has been done, has not been done. This can be proved as\nfollows. Since God\u2019s power (posse) is coeternal with God\nhimself, it is immutably the same. Before the beginning of time, it was\npossible for God that none of those things that we know as the past\nwould come into being. Therefore, this is possible for him now and\nalways (620A\u2013B).\n\n\nIn his additional approach, Damian purposefully put forward ideas\nthat he knew were problematic. For if it is true that God cannot undo\nwhat has been done, there must be something wrong in any argument that\nseems to prove that he can. To save the faithful among the readers from\ntoo much bewilderment, Damian suggests that the additional\nconsideration that he presents is principally of a grammatical nature.\nNamely, he points out that when we speak about God\u2019s ability to bring\nit about that what has been done, has not been done, the expression\n\u201cHe can (potest) do it\u201d is appropriate for\nspeaking of the eternal God; from our temporal point of view, \u201cHe\ncould have (potuit) done it\u201d is the appropriate way of\nexpressing it (619A\u2013C). If we follow this lead, the statement that God\ncan undo what has been done collapses into the statement that God could\nhave chosen to make the past different from what it actually was\n(Remnant 1978; Moonan 1980; Holopainen 1996, 42). Of course, this is\nnot changing the past properly speaking. What Damian assumes here is\nthat God could have chosen a different providential plan, not that God\ncould make changes in the providential plan that he has actually\nchosen.\n6. Damian\u2019s Objective\n\n\nIt is easy to misunderstand Damian\u2019s position regarding the validity\nof the principle of non-contradiction and the possibility of altering\nthe past. This is partly due to the disorderliness of some of Damian\u2019s\nideas. There is also another important factor which promotes\nmisunderstanding. In Damian\u2019s view, there are some ideas that you\nshould not articulate even though they are true. The idea that God\ncannot undo the done counts among these.\n\n\nThe situation from which De divina omnipotentia resulted\nbegun from Damian\u2019s attempt to regulate what one may utter about God.\nDamian had been sitting at the table of Abbot Didier in Monte Cassino\nand eating. While they were eating, a passage in Jerome\u2019s letter to\nEustochium was read in which it is claimed that even though God is\ncapable of everything (omnia possit), he cannot restore\nvirginity to a woman who has lost it. Damian stated that he had always\nfound it disturbing that an inability (inpossibilitas) was so\nlightly ascribed to God. A discussion followed in which Damian defended\nthe view that God has the power of restoring virginity whereas Didier\nargued for Jerome\u2019s view that he cannot restore it. In Damian\u2019s view,\nthere is a sense in which we can say that God can restore virginity,\nand therefore we must affirm that he can restore it (596C\u2013601B).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective at the table of Monte Cassino was to protect the\ndoctrine of divine omnipotence by advising that we should abstain from\nsaying anything which implies that God is powerless in some respect.\nSome of the monks sitting at the table were less interested in Damian\u2019s\nadvice and more interested in the issue of omnipotence in itself. They\nwere bold enough to put a question to Damian: if God is omnipotent in\nall things, as Damian has asserted, does he have the power of bringing\nit about that what has been done has not been done (601C)? We can be\nsure that Damian found this question very annoying. It is a difficult\nquestion, and it is a question that is difficult to handle without\nmaking statements about what God cannot do. Damian does not offer us\nany report about how the discussion continued. However, there is a\nremark in De divina omnipotentia which suggests that Damian\nhimself was accused of implying that God is impotent in a certain\nrespect (620D).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective in De divina omnipotentia is twofold.\nFirst, Damian reiterates his point about moderation while talking about\nGod (e.g., 597B\u2013599A, 603B\u2013604B, 614D\u2013616C). He strongly advises that\nwe should abstain from spreading certain kinds of statements, even in\ncases where they are found in the Bible (597B\u2013C). Damian\u2019s most\nimportant motive here seems to be to protect the faith of the simple\nbelievers:\nFor if it should reach the common people that God is\nasserted to be impotent in some respect (which is a wicked thing to\nsay), the unschooled masses would instantly be confused and the\nChristian faith would be upset, not without grave danger to souls.\n(597C; tr. Spade 3.18\u201322).\n\n\nSecond, Damian defends himself against the accusation that he said\nthat God is impotent in a certain respect (620D). His delicate task in\nDe divina omnipotentia is to convince his readers of the view\nthat divine omnipotence remains intact even though God cannot undo the\ndone, without ever saying that God cannot undo the done because this is\n\u201ca wicked thing to say\u201d.\n",
