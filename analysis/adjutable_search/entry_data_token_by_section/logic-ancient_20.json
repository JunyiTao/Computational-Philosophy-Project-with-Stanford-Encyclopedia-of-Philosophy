    "main_text": "Epicurus and the Epicureans\n7. Later Antiquity\n\n\nVery little is known about the development of logic from c. 100 BCE to\nc. 250 CE. It is unclear when Peripatetics and Stoics began taking\nnotice of each others\u2019 logical achievements. At some point during that\nperiod, the terminological distinction between \u2018categorical\nsyllogisms\u2019, used for Aristotelian syllogisms, and\n\u2018hypothetical syllogisms\u2019, used not only for those\nintroduced by Theophrastus and Eudemus, but also for the Stoic\npropositional-logical syllogisms, gained a foothold. In the first\ncentury BCE, the Peripatetics Ariston of Alexandria and Boethus of\nSidon wrote about syllogistic. Ariston is said to have introduced the\nso-called \u2018subaltern\u2019 syllogisms (Barbari, Celaront,\nCesaro, Camestrop and Camenop) into Aristotelian syllogistic (Apuleius\nInt. 213.5\u201310), i.e. the syllogisms one gains by\napplying the subalternation rules (that were acknowledged by Aristotle\nin his Topics)\n\n From \u2018A holds of every B\u2019 infer\n\u2018A holds of some B\u2019\n \n\n From \u2018A holds of no B\u2019 infer\n\u2018A does not hold of some B\u2019\n \n\n\nto the conclusions of the relevant syllogisms. Boethus suggested\nsubstantial modifications to Aristotle\u2019s theories: he claimed that all\ncategorical syllogisms are complete, and that hypothetical syllogistic\nis prior to categorical (Galen Inst. Log. 7.2), although we\nare not told what this priority was thought to consist in.  The Stoic\nPosidonius (c. 135\u2013c. 51 BCE) defended the possibility of\nlogical or mathematical deduction against the Epicureans and discussed\nsome syllogisms he called \u2018conclusive by the force of an\naxiom\u2019, which apparently included arguments of the type\n\u2018As the 1st is to the 2nd, so the\n3rd is to the 4th; the ratio of the\n1st to the 2nd is double; therefore the ratio of\nthe 3rd to the 4th is double\u2019, which was\nconsidered conclusive by the force of the axiom \u2018things which\nare in general of the same ratio, are also of the same particular\nratio\u2019 (Galen Inst. Log. 18.8). At least two Stoics in\nthis period wrote a work on Aristotle\u2019s Categories. From his\nwritings we know that Cicero (1st c. BCE) was knowledgeable\nabout both Peripatetic and Stoic logic; and Epictetus\u2019 discourses\n(late 1st\u2013early 2nd c. CE) prove that he\nwas acquainted with some of the more taxing parts of Chrysippus\u2019\nlogic. In all likelihood, there existed at least a few creative\nlogicians in this period, but we do not know who they were or what\nthey created.\n\n\nThe next logician of rank, if of lower rank, of whom we have\nsufficient evidence to speak is Galen (129\u2013199 or 216 CE), who\nachieved greater fame as a physician. He studied logic with both\nPeripatetic and Stoic teachers, and recommended availing oneself of\nparts of either doctrine, as long as it could be used for scientific\ndemonstration. He composed commentaries on logical works by Aristotle,\nTheophrastus, Eudemus and Chrysippus, as well as treatises on various\nlogical problems and a major work entitled On\nDemonstration. All these are lost, except for some information in\nlater texts, but his Introduction to Logic has come down to\nus almost in full. In On Demonstration, Galen developed,\namong other things, a theory of compound categorical syllogisms with\nfour terms, which fall into four figures, but we do not know the\ndetails. He also introduced the so-called relational syllogisms,\nexamples of which are \u2018A is equal to B,\nB is equal to C; therefore A is equal to\nC\u2019 and \u2018Dio owns half as much as Theo; Theo owns\nhalf as much as Philo. Therefore Dio owns a quarter of what Philo\nowns\u2019 (Galen Inst. Log, 17\u201318). All the relational\nsyllogisms Galen mentions have in common that they are not reducible\nin either Aristotle\u2019s or the Stoic syllogistic, but it is difficult to\nfind further formal characteristics that unite them. In general, in\nhis Introduction to Logic Galen merges Aristotelian\nSyllogistic with a strongly Peripatetic reinterpretation of Stoic\npropositional logic. This becomes apparent in particular in Galen\u2019s\nemphatic denial that truth-preservation is sufficient for the validity\nor syllogismhood of an argument, and his insistence that, instead,\nknowledge-introduction or knowledge-extension is a necessary condition\nfor something to count as a\n syllogism.[5]\n\n\n\nThe second ancient introduction to logic that has survived is\nApuleius\u2019 (2nd cent. CE) De Interpretatione. This\nLatin text, too, displays knowledge of Stoic and Peripatetic logic; it\ncontains the first full presentation of the square of opposition,\nwhich illustrates the logical relations between categorical sentences\nby diagram. The Platonist Alcinous (2nd cent. CE), in his\nHandbook of Platonism chapter 5, is witness to the emergence\nof a specifically Platonist logic, constructed on the Platonic notions\nand procedures of division, definition, analysis and hypothesis, but\nthere is little that would make a logician\u2019s heart beat\nfaster. At some time between the 3rd and 6th century\nCE Stoic logic faded into oblivion, to be resurrected only in the\n20th century, in the wake of the (re)-discovery of\npropositional logic.\n\n\nThe surviving, often voluminous, Greek commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical works by Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. c. 200 CE), Porphyry\n(234\u2013c. 305), Ammonius Hermeiou (5th century),\nPhiloponus (c. 500) and Simplicius (6th century) and the\nLatin ones by Boethius (c. 480\u2013524) are mainly important for\npreserving alternative interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s logic and as\nsources for lost Peripatetic and Stoic works. They also allow us to\ntrace the gradual development from a Peripatetic exegesis of\nAristotle\u2019s Organon to a more eclectic logic that resulted\nfrom the absorption and inclusion of elements not just from Stoic and\nPlatonist theories but also from mathematics and rhetoric. Two of the\ncommentators in particular deserve special mention in their own right:\nPorphyry, for writing the Isagoge or Introduction\n(i.e. to Aristotle\u2019s Categories), in which he discusses the\nfive notions of genus, species, differentia, property and accident as\nbasic notions one needs to know to understand the\nCategories. For centuries, the Isagoge was the first\nlogic text a student would tackle, and Porphyry\u2019s five predicables\n(which differ from Aristotle\u2019s four) formed the basis for the medieval\ndoctrine of the quinque voces. The second is Boethius. In\naddition to commentaries, he wrote a number of logical treatises,\nmostly simple explications of Aristotelian logic, but also two very\ninteresting ones: (i) His On Topical Differentiae bears\nwitness to the elaborated system of topical arguments that logicians\nof later antiquity had developed from Aristotle\u2019s Topics\nunder the influence of the needs of Roman lawyers. (ii) His On\nHypothetical Syllogisms systematically presents wholly\nhypothetical and mixed hypothetical syllogisms as they are known from\nthe early Peripatetics; it may be derived from Porphyry. Boethius\u2019\ninsistence that the negation of \u2018If it is A, it is\nB\u2019 is \u2018If it is A, it is not\nB\u2019 suggests a suppositional understanding of the\nconditional, a view for which there is also some evidence in Ammonius,\nbut that is not attested for earlier logicians. Historically, Boethius\nis most important because he translated all of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon into Latin, making these texts (except the\nPosterior Analytics) available to philosophers of the\nmedieval period.\n",
