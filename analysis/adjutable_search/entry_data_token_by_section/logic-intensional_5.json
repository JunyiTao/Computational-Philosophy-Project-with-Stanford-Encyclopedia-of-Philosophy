    "main_text": "A Brief History || Marcus\n2.4 Marcus\n\n Carnap\u2019s work was primarily semantic, and resulted in a logic that did not\ncorrespond to any of the formal systems that had been studied up to\nthis point. Axiomatically presented propositional modal logics were\nwell-established, so it was important to see how (or if) they could be\nextended to include quantifiers and equality. At issue were decisions\nabout what sorts of things quantifiers range over, and substitutivity\nof equals for equals. Quine\u2019s modal objections needed to be\naddressed. Ruth Barcan Marcus began a line of development in (Marcus\n1946) by formally extending the propositional system S2 of C. I. Lewis\nto include quantification, and developing it axiomatically in the\nstyle of Principia Mathematica. It was clear that other\nstandard modal logics besides S2 could have been used, and S4 was\nexplicitly discussed. The Barcan formula, in the form\n \\(\\Diamond (\\exists \\alpha )\\)A \\(\\supset (\\exists \\alpha )\\Diamond\\)A, made its first\nappearance in (Marcus\n 1946),[1]\n though a full understanding of its significance would have to wait\nfor the development of a possible-world semantics. Especially\nsignificant for the present article, her system was further extended\nin (Marcus 1947) to allow for abstraction and identity. Two versions\nof identity were considered, depending on whether things had the same\nproperties (abstracts) or necessarily had them. In the S2 system the\ntwo versions were shown to be equivalent, and in the S4 system,\nnecessarily equivalent. In a later paper (Marcus 1953) the\nfundamental role of the deduction theorem was fully explored as\nwell. \n\n Marcus proved that in her system identity was necessary if true, and\nthe same for distinctness. She argued forcefully in subsequent works,\nprimarily (Marcus 1961), that morning star/evening star problems were\nnonetheless avoided. Names were understood as tags. They\nmight have their designation specified through an initial use of a\ndefinite description, or by some other means, but otherwise names had\nno meaning, only a designation. Thus they did not behave like\ndefinite descriptions, which were more than mere tags. Well, the\nobject tagged by \u201cmorning star \u201d and that tagged by\n\u201cevening star \u201d are the same, and identity between objects\nis never contingent.\n\n The essential point had been made. One could develop formal modal\nsystems with quantifiers and equality. The ideas had coherence.\nStill missing was a semantics which would help with the understanding\nof the formalism, but this was around the corner.\n",
