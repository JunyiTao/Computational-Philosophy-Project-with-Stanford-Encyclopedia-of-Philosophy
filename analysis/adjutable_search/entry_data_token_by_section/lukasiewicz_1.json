    "main_text": "The Influence of Twardowski\n2. The Influence of Twardowski\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz was one of Twardowski\u2019s first students in\nLw\u00f3w, and was influenced in his attitudes and methods by his\nteacher. Twardowski was born and studied in Vienna, where he became a\ndisciple of Franz Brentano, and was imbued with the latter\u2019s\npassionate advocacy of philosophy as a rigorous discipline, to be\ninvestigated with the same care and attention to detail as any\nempirical science, and to be communicated with utmost transparency. In\n1895 Twardowski was appointed Professor Extraordinary in Lw\u00f3w.\nHe found Polish philosophical life dormant and third-rate, and set\nabout vitalising the subject and building its Polish institutions, at\nthe cost of his own academic output. Like Brentano, he believed that a\nsound descriptive psychology was methodologically basic for\nphilosophy, and like Brentano he advocated modest reforms in formal\nlogic. \u0141ukasiewicz, under the influence of Husserl, Russell and\nFrege, rejected any foundational role for psychology, and inspired in\nparticular by the latter two, he carried the reform of logic far\nbeyond anything Twardowski envisaged. He read Russell\u2019s The\nPrinciples of Mathematics in 1904 and it influenced him\nconsiderably. The general attitude that philosophy could and should\naspire to be scientifically exact was one that stayed with\n\u0141ukasiewicz, though his estimation of the state of the subject\ntended to become more pessimistic than optimistic, and he advocated\nfundamentally reforming philosophy along logical lines.\n\nAnother respect in which \u0141ukasiewicz continued the tradition of\nthe Brentano School was in his respect for the history of philosophy,\nparticularly that of Aristotle and the British empiricists. (He and\nTwardowski translated Hume\u2019s first Enquiry into\nPolish.) Twardowski, who knew Bolzano\u2019s work well, pointed out\nsimilarities between concepts in Bolzano\u2019s and\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s theories of probability. The respect for\nhistory also lay behind \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s groundbreaking\nstudies in the history of logic, notably his accounts of Stoic\npropositional logic and Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz emulated and indeed surpassed Twardowski in his\nattention to clarity of expression. Qualified experts agree that\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s scientific prose, in whichever of the three\nlanguages in which he wrote, is of unmatched clarity and beauty.\n",
