    "main_text": "\n\n\u2018Default\u2019 can mean many different things in theories of\nmeaning. It is so not only because of the multiplicity of approaches\nand dimensions from which meaning can be studied but also due to the\nfact the theoretical landscape is changing swiftly and dynamically.\nFirst, there is the dimension of the ongoing debates concerning the\ndelimitation of explicit content (e.g., Jaszczolt 2009a, 2016a).\nSecond, discussions about \u2018defaultness\u2019 are propelled by\nthe debates concerning the literal/nonliteral vis-\u00e0-vis\nsalient/nonsalient distinction (e.g., Giora & Givoni 2015; Ariel\n2016). Next, defaultness plays an important role in computational\nlinguistics that develops statistical models for learning\ncompositional meaning using \u2018big data\u2019 (Jurafsky &\nMartin 2017 [Other Internet Resources]; Liang & Potts 2015). More\nrecently, the ongoing \u2018revolution\u2019 in philosophy of\nlanguage noticeable in the progressing departure from analytic\nphilosophy has brought in the debates on socially expected, or\nsocially and politically correct \u2013 and as such, standard, or\ndefault \u2013 meanings in the context of discussions on epistemic\nnorms for assertion (e.g., Goldberg 2011, 2015), theories of\nargumentation (e.g., Macagno 2022), and, relatedly, commitment and\naccountability for one\u2019s linguistic actions (e.g., Haugh 2013;\nBorg 2019). Defaults are also relevant in the discussions of the\nconventional import of lexical items such as expressives in that their\nstandard expressive (often offensive) meaning may not arise in certain\ntypes of context; the view on their truth-evaluability (or at least on\nwhat aspects of their meaning are truth-evaluable) is then closely\nrelated to the value one attaches to this context-dependence (Potts\n2007, 2012; Richard 2008; Geurts 2007).\n\nAll in all, the term \u2018default meaning\u2019 has been used in a\nvariety of ways in the literature, including statistically common\ninterpretation, predictable meaning, salient meaning, or automatically\nretrieved meaning. To begin with a common-sense definition, default\ninterpretation of the speaker\u2019s utterance is normally understood\nto mean salient meaning intended by the speaker, or presumed by the\naddressee to have been intended, and recovered (a) without the help of\ninference from the speaker\u2019s intentions or (b) without any\nconscious inferential process whatsoever. Default interpretations,\ninterpretations producing the standard content, are defined\ndifferently depending on how \u2018default\u2019 is defined: as a\ndefault for the lexical item, a default for the syntactic structure, a\ndefault for a particular construction, or even a default for a\nparticular context (where, in addition, there is a necessary\ncorrelation with the adopted definition of \u2018context\u2019). The\ndelimitation of such defaults can proceed according to different\nmethods that, again, can affect the results, and as such further\ncontribute to the definition of defaults. For example, the\npsychological route is associated with automatic, inference-free\ninterpretations, while the statistical route appeals to quantitative\nanalyses of data, where the latter can pertain to corpora of\nconversations or big databases of word co-occurrence as used in\nstatistical, distributional approaches in computational semantics.\n\nIn what follows, I attend to such seminal conceptualisations of\ndefaultness, their provenance, and their relative merits (Sections\n1\u20133). Section 4 follows with some remarks on what can be called\n\u2018dynamic defaultness\u2019 in the theories and models of a\njoint construction (\u2018co-construction\u2019) of meaning that are\nsteadily gaining ground across different strands of pragmatic research\n(Lewis 1979; Asher and Lascarides 2013; Elder and Haugh 2018). Next, I\nbriefly move to the role of defaults on the crossroads of philosophy\nof language with disciplines such as ethics, epistemology, and law\n(Section 5).\n\nThe overview of the major perspectives and debates makes it clear that\nthere is no consensus in the literature as to the unique set of\nproperties that default interpretations should exhibit, opening up the\ndiscussion as to whether the term has only an intra-theoretic utility.\nNext, of course, comes the question of the utility of the\nterm and the utility of the concept \u2013\nsomething I touch upon in the concluding section in the context of\nconceptual engineering.\n",
