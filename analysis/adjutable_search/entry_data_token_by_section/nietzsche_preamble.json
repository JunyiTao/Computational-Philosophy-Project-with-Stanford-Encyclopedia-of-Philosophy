    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was a German philosopher and\ncultural critic who published intensively in the 1870s and 1880s. He\nis famous for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European\nmorality and religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas\nand social and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of\nthese criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false\nconsciousness infecting people\u2019s received ideas; for that\nreason, he is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers\n(including Marx and Freud) who advanced a \u201chermeneutics of\nsuspicion\u201d against traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990,\nRicoeur [1965] 1970, Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his\npsychological analyses to support original theories about the nature\nof the self and provocative proposals suggesting new values that he\nthought would promote cultural renewal and improve social and\npsychological life by comparison to life under the traditional values\nhe criticized.\n",
