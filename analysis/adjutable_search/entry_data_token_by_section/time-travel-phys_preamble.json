    "main_text": "\n\nTime travel has been a staple of science fiction. With the advent of\ngeneral relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists. But,\nespecially in the philosophy literature, there have been arguments\nthat time travel is inherently paradoxical. The most famous paradox is\nthe grandfather paradox: you travel back in time and kill your\ngrandfather, thereby preventing your own existence. To avoid\ninconsistency some circumstance will have to occur which makes you\nfail in this attempt to kill your grandfather. Doesn\u2019t this\nrequire some implausible constraint on otherwise unrelated\ncircumstances? We examine such worries in the context of modern\nphysics.\n",
