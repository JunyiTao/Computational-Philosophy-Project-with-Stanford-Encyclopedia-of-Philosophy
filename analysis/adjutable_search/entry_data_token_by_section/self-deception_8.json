    "main_text": "Morality and Self-Deception\n5. Morality and Self-Deception\n\nEven though much of the contemporary philosophical discussion of\nself-deception has focused on epistemology, philosophical psychology,\nand philosophy of mind, historically, the morality of self-deception\nhas been the central focus of discussion. Self-deception has been\nthought to be morally wrong or, at least, morally dangerous insofar as\nit represents a threat to moral self-knowledge, a cover for immoral\nactivity, or a violation of authenticity. Some thinkers, what Martin\n(1986) calls \u2018the vital lie tradition,\u2019 however, have held\nthat self-deception can, in some instances, be salutary, protecting us\nfrom truths that would make life unlivable (e.g., Rorty 1972, 1994).\nThere are two major questions regarding the morality of\nself-deception: First, can a person be held morally responsible for\nself-deception, and if so, under what conditions? Second, is there\nanything morally problematic with self-deception, and if so, what and\nunder what circumstances? The answers to these questions are clearly\nintertwined. If self-deceivers cannot be held responsible for\nself-deception, then their responsibility for whatever morally\nobjectionable consequences self-deception might have will be mitigated\nif not eliminated. Nevertheless, self-deception might be morally\nsignificant even if one cannot be taxed for entering it. To be\nignorant of one\u2019s moral self, as Socrates saw, may represent a\ngreat obstacle to a life well lived, whether or not one is at fault\nfor such ignorance.\n",
