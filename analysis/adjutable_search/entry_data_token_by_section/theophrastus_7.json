    "main_text": "Rhetoric, Poetics and Music\n8. Theophrastus\u2019 Legacy\n\nThe impact of Theophrastus\u2019 various writings cannot be\nexaggerated; his treatises were read and respected by subsequent\ngenerations of philosophers and others, whose works contain sometimes\nclear and sometimes latent signs of his influence. To start with the\nHellenistic period, Epicurus took careful note of Theophrastus\u2019\nwritings and seems to have made use both of his reports concerning the\ntheories and arguments of previous philosophers as well as of his\nobjections against them. In physics, in particular, it has been shown\nthat Epicurus owes a direct and positive debt to Theophrastus\u2019\nexclusion of divine causes as well as to his principle of multiple\nexplanation. It is noteworthy, however, that Theophrastus\u2019\nacceptance of multiple explanations differs from that of Epicurus;\nTheophrastus seems to have correlated different explanations with\ndifferent forms of a phenomenon in our experience, whereas Epicurus\nclaimed that any possible explanation will be true somewhere in the\ninfinite Atomist universe (see Sedley 1998).\n\nRegarding, on the other hand, Theophrastus\u2019 influence on\nStoicism, at least in its earliest years, it has been argued that it\nwas probably minimal in all three parts of Stoic philosophy: Stoic\nethics presented happiness as entirely independent of external\ncircumstances or chance events, while the Stoics\u2019 account of\nphysical phenomena was mainly influenced by Heraclitus and\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus. In logic, finally, it may be true that\nTheophrastus elaborated a logic of propositions, but there is no doubt\nthat he considered the categorical syllogism as primary, and never\ncame close to developing Chrysippus\u2019 sophisticated hypothetical\nsyllogistic. Therefore, it is not the case that the early Stoics put\nforward positions that they could scarcely have adopted without the\nhelp of Theophrastus\u2019 doctrines or methods, even if it proves\nthat he left a stronger imprint on Chrysippus than on\nChrysippus\u2019 Stoic predecessors (see Barnes 1985; Long 1998).\n\nCicero often refers to Theophrastus together with Aristotle in matters\nof ethics, politics and rhetoric. Although he gives Theophrastus a\nsubordinate role, he regards the encyclopedic research carried out by\nhim as a guide containing useful directives to politicians and\nrhetoricians, but also as a helpful example in his attempt to present\nGreek philosophy to the Roman society (see Gigon 1988; Runia 1989;\nFortenbaugh 2005). The encyclopedic character of Theophrastus\u2019\nwritings, and in particular of his treatise Opinions of the\nNatural Philosophers or Opinions in Natural Philosophy,\nhas also been assumed to be the source for much of the material on the\nPresocratics in later doxographic accounts. In his seminal work\nDoxographi Graeci (1879), Hermann Diels argued that\ndoxography proper began with the Theophrastean writings; according to\nhim, the fragmentary information on the Presocratics found in his\nreconstructed A\u00ebtius\u2019 Placita\n(1st/early 2nd cent.), though debased and\nmodified in the course of transmission, is linked to\nTheophrastus\u2019 treatises in a direct and vertical line of\ndescent. He further argued that also a number of doxographical\npassages in Hippolytus\u2019 Refutatio Omnium Haeresium\n(early 3rd cent.), in Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nLives (early 3rd cent.), in the\nStromateis preserved by Eusebius (early 4th cent.)\nand in a few other works of minor importance, in some way or other for\nthe most part go back to Theophrastus himself. By and large Hermann\nDiels\u2019 argument as pertaining to A\u00ebtius, though in need of\nrevision, has been judged as correct; but the relation of the\ndoxographical sections in the person-oriented overviews of the later\nauthors to the topic-oriented work of Theophrastus seems to be more\ncomplicated than he believed. Moreover, Diels has also been criticized\nfor having failed to take into account the possibility that already\nbefore A\u00ebtius more than a single tradition existed, or mutually\ndiverging witnesses belonging to the same tradition may have been\navailable (see Mansfeld 1992, 1998).\n\nIn the Arabic sources we find many references to Theophrastus\u2019\nlife, works and sayings, but only the translations of two genuine\nTheophrastean texts have been preserved; namely, the\nMetaphysics or On First Principles and the\nMeteorology. It is not surprising, however, that\nTheophrastus\u2019 works were neither extensively copied nor much\nquoted in the Arabic philosophical literature. One of the reasons\nsuggested is the fact that from 900 to 1050 the promotion of Aristotle\nby the school of Baghdad as the most important philosopher eclipsed\nother Peripatetics, whose works were not seen to be commentaries on\nthe Aristotelian treatises. In addition, Theophrastus\u2019 treatises\nwith their aporetic nature and identical titles with those of\nAristotle were hardly appropriate for constructing a dogmatic\nAristotelian system, which the Baghdad Peripatetics were seeking.\nFinally, after 1050 the crushing influence of Avicenna caused the\ndisappearance of manuscript copies even of Aristotle\u2019s works,\nlet alone of Theophrastus (see Gutas 1985, 1999; Daiber 1985).\n\nByzantine scholars, on the other hand, appreciated and cited\nTheophrastus\u2019 works, and it is thanks to their efforts that some\nof his works survived. The Patriarch Photius (9th cent.),\nfor instance, refers both in his Lexicon and in his\nLibrary to a number of Theophrastus\u2019 treatises.\nByzantine rhetoricians incorporated the Characters within a\ncollection of rhetorical writings of Hermogenes and Aphthonius, whose\ndiscussions of \u0113thos they were taken to illustrate, and\nthus contributed to the survival of this book (see Diggle 2004: 13;\n38). In the twelfth century the polymath John Tzetzes and the\narchbishop of Thessaloniki Eustathius drew material from\nthe Characters and imitated its style, while Michael of\nEphesus used Theophrastus\u2019 ethical and biological writings when\ncompiling his comments on Aristotle\u2019s treatises. Finally, there\nis clear evidence that in the fifteenth century Cardinal Bessarion was\nwell familiar with Theophrastus\u2019 views and his testimony may be\nused as a reliable source (see Lautner 1995).\n\nDuring the Western Middle Ages, direct knowledge of\nTheophrastus\u2019 writings was very limited, and it was not until\nthe fifteenth century that some of his more important works were\nrecovered and translated into Latin, even though not all of them also\nappeared in print (see Schmitt 1971). Two Theophrastean treatises were\ntranslated by Bartolommeo da Messina for King Manfred of Sicily during\nthe years 1278\u20131266, namely De principiis and De\nsignis; at first they were thought to be Aristotle\u2019s and\ntheir influence was scant, but in the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies they were finally attributed to Theophrastus and attained\nsome importance. During the Renaissance, though, the fortuna\nof Theophrastus\u2019 writings changed considerably: The Latin\ntranslations by Theodore of Gaza of the two major botanical works,\nEnquiry into Plants and Plant Explanations, were\nprinted in 1483, even before the edition of the Greek text from the\npress of Aldus Manutius in 1495\u20131498. In 1644 Johannes Bodaeus\npublished in Amsterdam a frequently cited folio edition of these works\nwith commentaries and woodcut illustrations. The Latin version of the\nMetaphysics by Cardinal Bessarion was published in 1515,\nwhile the classical scholar Adrianus Turnebus began publishing Latin\ntranslations of Theophrastus\u2019 opuscula in 1553.\nFinally, the Latin translation of the Characters by Lapo da\nCastiglionchio was produced around 1430 and appeared in print in 1517.\nIt is worth adding that the Characters became the inspiration\nfor the literary genre of the character study, and found many\nimitators in the seventeenth century, notably Bishop Joseph Hall, Sir\nThomas Overbury, Bishop John Earle and the French satirist Jean de La\nBruy\u00e8re; finally, George Eliot was also inspired by this\nTheophrastean work, and wrote her own book of caricatures,\nImpressions of Theophrastus Such, which was first published\nin 1879.\n",
