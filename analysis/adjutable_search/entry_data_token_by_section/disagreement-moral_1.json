    "main_text": "The Nature of Moral Disagreement || Conflicts of Belief or Clashes of Conative Attitudes?\n1.1 Conflicts of Belief or Clashes of Conative Attitudes?\n\n\nPeople disagree morally when they have opposing moral convictions.\nThat much can be agreed by all theorists. What is debated is rather\nwhat it means for such convictions to be opposing. For example, moral\nrealism entails cognitivism, and cognitivism is the view that moral\nsentences\u2014the sentences we typically use to express our moral\nconvictions\u2014can be true and false and that the convictions\nthemselves constitute beliefs that purport to represent aspects of\nreality. That element of their position allows realists to construe\nmoral disagreements as conflicts of belief along the lines of disputes\nabout (other) factual matters, i.e., as cases where persons give\ninconsistent verdicts on one and the same truth-evaluable claim or\nproposition. On that conception, if Jane thinks that meat-eating is\nmorally wrong while Eric denies so then they have incompatible beliefs\nboth of which cannot be true, just as when Jane believes while Eric\ndenies that the Earth is older than four thousand years.\n\n\nTo construe moral disagreements in that way is not, however, an\noption for those non-cognitivists who deny that moral convictions are\nbeliefs and think that to judge that meat-eating is wrong is\ninstead to have a conative attitude towards meat-eating (such as an\nattitude of dislike or a desire). Theorists of that kind rather\nconceive of the opposition that a moral disagreement involves as a\nclash of such attitudes (see, e.g., Stevenson 1944; and Blackburn 1984,\n168). What the clash more specifically is supposed to consist in\ndepends on which version of non-cognitivism one is considering. If\nmoral convictions are taken to be desires, for example, then a moral\ndisagreement can be construed as a case where people have desires which\nare not jointly satisfiable and thus motivate different courses\nof\n action.[1]\n",
