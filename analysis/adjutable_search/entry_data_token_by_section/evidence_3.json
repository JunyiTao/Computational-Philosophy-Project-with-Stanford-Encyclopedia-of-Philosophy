Objectivity, Publicity, and Intersubjectivity: Evidence as Neutral Arbiter\n\nWhat is creditable \u2026 is not the mere belief in this or that,\nbut the having arrived at it by a process which, had the evidence been\ndifferent, would have carried one with equal readiness to a contrary\nbelief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Blanshard, Reason and Belief\n\n\n It is natural to suppose that the concept of evidence is intimately\nrelated to the cognitive desideratum of objectivity.\nAccording to this line of thought, individuals and institutions are\nobjective to the extent that they allow their views about what is the\ncase or what ought to be done to be guided by the evidence, as opposed\nto (say) the typically distorting influences of ideological dogma,\nprejudice in favor of one's kin, or texts whose claim to authority is\nexhausted by their being venerated by tradition. To the extent that\nindividuals and institutions are objective in this sense, we should\nexpect their views to increasingly converge over time: as shared\nevidence accumulates, consensus tends to emerge with respect to\nformerly disputed questions. Objective inquiry is evidence-driven\ninquiry, which makes for intersubjective agreement among\n inquirers.[26]\n Thus, it is widely thought that the reason why the natural sciences\nexhibit a degree of consensus that is conspicuously absent from many\nothers fields is that the former are evidence-driven\u2014and therefore,\nobjective\u2014in ways that the latter are not. \n\n According to this picture, a central function of evidence is to serve\nas a neutral arbiter among rival theories and their\nadherents. Whatever disagreements might exist at the level of theory,\nif those who disagree are objective, then the persistence of their\ndisagreement is an inherently fragile matter, for it is always hostage\nto the emergence of evidence which decisively resolves the dispute in\none direction or the other. Our ability to arrive at consensus in such\ncircumstances is thus constrained only by our resourcefulness and\ningenuity in generating such evidence (e.g., by designing and\nexecuting crucial experiments) and by the generosity of the world in\noffering it up.\n\n The slogan \u2018the priority of evidence to theory\u2019 has\nsometimes been employed in an attempt to capture this general\ntheme. However, this slogan has itself been used in a number of\nimportantly different ways that it is worth pausing to\ndistinguish. \n\n First, the claim that \u2018evidence is prior to theory\u2019 might\nsuggest a simple model of scientific method that is often associated\n(whether fairly or unfairly) with Francis Bacon. According to the\nmodel in question, the collection of evidence is temporally\nprior to the formulation of any theory or theories of the\nrelevant domain. That is, the first stage in any properly-conducted\nscientific inquiry consists in gathering and classifying a large\namount of data; crucially, this process is in no way guided or aided\nby considerations of theory. Only after a large amount of data has\nbeen gathered and classified does the scientist first attempt to\nformulate some theory or theories of the domain in question. On this\nmodel, then, evidence is prior to theory within the context of\ndiscovery. This model\u2014which Hempel (1966) dubbed \u2018the\nnarrow inductivist account of scientific inquiry\u2019\u2014is now\nuniversally rejected by philosophers. For it is now appreciated that,\nat any given time, which theories are accepted\u2014or more weakly,\nwhich theories are taken to be plausible hypotheses\u2014typically\nplays a crucial role in guiding the subsequent search for evidence\nwhich bears on those theories. Thus, a crucial experiment might be\nperformed to decide between two rival theories T1\nand T2; once performed, the outcome of that\nexperiment constitutes an expansion in the total evidence which is\nsubsequently available to the relevant scientific community. If,\nhowever, the two leading contenders had been theories\nT1 and T3, a different crucial\nexperiment would have been performed, which would have (typically)\nresulted in a different expansion in the total evidence. The point\nthat the formulation of hypotheses is often temporally prior to the\ncollection of evidence which bears on their truth (and that this\npriority is no accident) is perhaps most immediately apparent on\nPopper's falsificationist model of science (1959), according to which\nexemplary scientific practice consists in repeatedly attempting to\nfalsify whichever theory is presently most favored by the relevant\nscientific community. But it is no less true on other, less radical\nmodels of science, which (unlike Popper's) allow a role for confirming\nevidence as well as disconfirming evidence. As Hempel puts the\npoint,\n\n In sum, the maxim that data should be gathered without guidance by\nantecedent hypotheses about the connections among the facts under\nstudy is self-defeating, and it is certainly not followed in\nscientific inquiry.  On the contrary, tentative hypotheses are needed\nto give direction to a scientific investigation. Such hypotheses\ndetermine, among other things, what data should be collected at a\ngiven point in a scientific investigation (1966,\n p. 13).[27]\n\n\n A second, quite different, sense of \u2018priority\u2019 in which\nevidence has sometimes been held to be prior to theory is that of\nsemantic priority. According to this view, the meanings of\nhypotheses that involve \u2018theoretical terms\u2019 (e.g.,\n\u2018electron\u2019) depend upon the connections between such\nhypotheses and that which would count as evidence for their\ntruth\u2014typically on such accounts, the observations that would\nconfirm them. The view that (observational) evidence is semantically\nprior to theories was central to the logical positivist conception of\nscience. On this picture, meaning flows upward from the level of\nobservation; a given theory is imbued with whatever meaning it has in\nvirtue of standing in certain relations to the observational level,\nwhich constitutes the original locus of meaning. The picture was\ngradually abandoned, however, in the face of repeated failures to\ncarry through the kind of theoretical reductions that the picture\nseemed to demand, as well as appreciation of the point, forcefully\nemphasized by\n Putnam[28]\n and others, that the meanings of\ntheoretical terms do not seem to change as our views about what counts\nas confirming evidence for hypotheses in which they occur evolve.\n\n A third and final sense of \u2018priority\u2019 in which evidence\nhas often been thought to be prior to theory is that of\nepistemic priority. On this view, it is not that the task of\nevidence gathering either is or ought to be performed earlier in time\nthan the task of formulating theories; nor is semantic priority at\nissue. Rather, the thought is that theories depend for their\njustification on standing in certain relations to evidence (understood\nhere, once again, as that which is observed), but that observations do\nnot themselves depend upon theories for their own justification. That\nis: (observational) evidence is prior to theory within the context\nof justification. This, perhaps, is the interpretation of\n\u2018evidence is prior to theory\u2019 on which the slogan enjoys\nits greatest plausibility. For it seems that our justification for\nbelieving any presently-accepted theory of natural or social science\ntypically does depend upon suitable observations having been made, but\nthat, on the other hand, one can be justified in taking oneself to\nhave observed that such-and-such is the case even if there is\nat present no available theory as to why such-and-such is the\ncase (and indeed, even if such-and-such's being the case is unexpected\nor unlikely given the theories that one presently accepts). To the\nextent that such a justificational asymmetry exists, there would seem\nto be some truth to the idea that evidence is epistemically prior to\n theory.[29]\n And this sort of priority might seem to be exactly what is required\nif evidence is to play the role of neutral arbiter among those who\ncome to the table with different theoretical commitments.\n\n The idea of evidence as a kind of ultimate court of appeal, uniquely\nqualified to generate agreement among those who hold rival theories,\nis a highly plausible one. Nevertheless, complications with this\nsimple picture\u2014some more serious than\nothers\u2014abound. Above, we took note of the widely-held view\naccording to which the bearing of a given piece of evidence on a given\nhypothesis depends on considerations of background theory. Thus, two\nindividuals who hold different background theories might disagree\nabout how strongly a particular piece of evidence confirms a given\ntheory, or indeed, about whether the evidence confirms the theory at\nall. Of course, if the question of who has the superior background\ntheory is itself susceptible to rational adjudication, then this\npossibility need pose no deep threat to objectivity. Often enough,\nthis will be the case. Suppose, for example, that you treat the fact\nthat \n\n(i) the patient has Koplik spots on her skin\n \nas evidence that\n\n (ii) the patient has measles\n \n\n while I do not, simply because you know that Koplik spots are\ntypically an effect of measles while I am ignorant of this fact. Here,\nthat you treat (i) as evidence for (ii) while I do not is attributable\nto the straightforward superiority of your background theory to mine:\nyou possess a crucial piece of medical knowledge that I\nlack. Presumably, if I were to acquire the relevant bit of medical\nknowledge, then I too would treat (i) as confirming evidence for\n(ii). The possibility that those who are relatively ill-informed might\ndiffer from those who are better informed in the way that they respond\nto evidence does not itself cast doubt on the capacity of evidence to\nplay the role of neutral arbiter among theories; clearly, what is\nneeded in such cases is for the worse informed party to become privy\nto those facts of which they are presently ignorant. \n\n However, a recurrent motif in twentieth century philosophy of science\nis that the bearing of evidence on theory is mediated by factors that\nmight vary between individuals in ways that do not admit of such\nrational adjudication. Imagine two eminent scientists, both of whom\nare thoroughly acquainted with all of the available evidence\nwhich bears on some theory. One believes the theory, the other\nbelieves some different, incompatible theory instead.  Must one of the\ntwo scientists be making a mistake about what their shared evidence\nsupports? Perhaps the most natural answer to this question, at least\nat first blush, is \u2018Yes\u2019. A fair amount of twentieth\ncentury philosophy of science shied away from this natural answer,\nhowever, at least in part because of a growing awareness of just how\noften eminent, fully-informed and seemingly rational\nscientists have disagreed in the history of\n science.[30]\n Thus, Thomas Kuhn (1962) would maintain that both scientists might be\nperfectly rational in holding incompatible theories, inasmuch as\nrationality is relative to a paradigm, and the two scientists might be\noperating within different paradigms. Similarly, Carnap (1952) would\nmaintain that both scientists might be rational because rationality is\nrelative to an inductive method or confirmation function, and the two\nscientists might be employing different inductive methods or\nconfirmation functions. As we have noted, for the contemporary\nBayesian, how it is reasonable to respond to a given body of evidence\ndepends upon one's prior probability distribution: the two scientists\nmight thus both be rational in virtue of possessing different prior\nprobability distributions. There are, of course, important differences\namong these accounts of rationality. But notice that they each possess\nthe same structure: what it is reasonable for one to believe depends\nnot only on one's total evidence but also on some further feature\nF (one's prior probability distribution, paradigm, inductive\nmethod.).  Because this further feature F can vary between\ndifferent individuals, even quite different responses to a given body\nof evidence might be equally reasonable. On such views, the bearing of\na given body of evidence on a given theory becomes a highly\nrelativized matter. For this reason, the capacity of evidence to\ngenerate agreement among even impeccably rational individuals is in\nprinciple subject to significant limitations. \n\n Why is relativity to a prior probability\ndistribution (paradigm, inductive method) any more threatening to the\nidea of evidence as neutral arbiter than the previously mentioned\nrelativity to background theory? The difference is this: when I fail to\ntreat Koplik spots as evidence of measles, there is a clear and\nstraightforward sense in which my background theory is inferior to\nyours. By contrast, proponents of the views presently under\nconsideration typically insist that a relatively wide range of prior\nprobability distributions (confirmation functions, inductive methods,\nparadigms) might be equally good. For this reason, such views\nare often criticized on the grounds that they turn the relationship\nbetween evidence and theory into an overly subjective affair.\n\n Proponents of such views are not wholly without resources for\nattempting to alleviate this concern. In particular, many subjective\nBayesians place great weight on a phenomenon known as the\n\u2018swamping\u2019 or \u2018washing out\u2019 of the\npriors. Here, the idea is that even individuals who begin with quite\ndifferent prior probabilities will tend to converge in their views\ngiven subsequent exposure to a sufficiently extensive body of common\nevidence. However, the significance of the relevant convergence\nresults is highly\n controversial.[31] \n\n According to the accounts briefly canvassed here, two individuals of\nimpeccable rationality might radically disagree about the bearing of a\nparticular piece of evidence E on a given hypothesis\nH. Even in such cases, the disputants are not wholly without\ncommon ground. For they at least agree about the characterization of\nthe evidence E: their disagreement concerns rather the\nprobative force of E with respect to H. An even more\nradical challenge to the capacity of evidence to serve as neutral\narbiter among rival theories concerns the alleged theory-ladenness\nof observation.  According to proponents of the doctrine of\ntheory-ladenness, in cases of fundamental theoretical dispute, there\nwill typically be no theoretically-neutral characterization of the\nevidence available.  Rather, adherents of rival theories will\nirremediably differ as to the appropriate description of the\n data itself.[32] \n\n The doctrine of theory-ladenness is perhaps best appreciated when it\nis viewed against the background of the positivist tradition to which\nit was in large part a reaction. For the positivists, evidence was\nboth epistemically and semantically prior to theory. Moreover, central\nto the positivist conception of science as a paradigm of rationality\nand objectivity is the idea that its disputes admitted of rational\nadjudication by appeal to evidence that could be appreciated by both\nsides. For these reasons, the positivists often insisted that the\nfundamental units of evidential significance\u2014observation\nstatements or \u2018protocol sentences\u2019\u2014should employ\nonly vocabulary that is within the idiolect of any minimally competent\nspeaker of the relevant language.  Ideally then, observation\nstatements should be comprehensible to and verifiable by individuals\nwho possess no specialized knowledge or terminological\nsophistication. Thus, Carnap recommended \u2018blue\u2019 and\n\u2018hard\u2019 as exemplary predicates for observation\n sentences.[33]\n As against this, Hanson insisted that\n\n \u2026 the layman simply cannot see what the physicist sees\n\u2026 when the physicist looks at an X-ray tube, he sees the\ninstrument in terms of electrical circuit theory, thermodynamic\ntheory, the theories of metal and glass structure, thermionic\nemission, optical transmission, refraction, diffraction, atomic\ntheory, quantum theory and special relativity (1961:19).\n \n\n But what holds for the physicist and the layman holds also for two\nphysicists with sufficiently different theoretical\ncommitments. Thus\n\n To say that Tycho and Kepler, Simplicius and Galileo, Hooke and\nNewton, Priestly and Lavoisier, Soddy and Einstein, De Broglie and\nBorn, Heisenberg and Bohm all make the same observations but use them\ndifferently is too easy. This parallels the too-easy epistemological\ndoctrine that all normal observers see the same things in x, but\ninterpret them differently. It does not explain controversy in\nresearch science (1961:13).\n \n\n The extent to which observation is theory-laden remains a contested\n matter.[34]\n To the extent that evidence which bears on a theory does not admit of\na neutral characterization among those with sufficiently different\ntheoretical commitments, this threatens to limit the ability of such\nevidence to successfully discharge the role of neutral arbiter in such\ncases. Still, whatever concessions to the proponents of\ntheory-ladenness might be in order, the significance of the doctrine\nthat they defend should not be overstated. For in any case, it seems\nundeniable that theories sometimes are discredited by the emergence of\nevidence which is taken to undermine them\u2014even in the eyes\nof their former\n proponents.[35]\n Let's assume then that evidence sometimes does successfully discharge\nthe function of neutral arbiter among theories and is that which\nsecures intersubjective agreement among inquirers. What must evidence\nbe like, in order for it to play this role? That is, given that\nevidence sometimes underwrites intersubjective agreement, what\nconstraints does this place on answers to the question: what sorts of\nthings are eligible to count as evidence?\n\n Above, we noted that the traditional epistemological demand that\none's evidence consist of that to which one has immediate and\nunproblematic access\u2014and indeed, that one's evidence must be\nsuch that one can appreciate it (at least it in principle) even when\none is in the most dire of epistemic predicaments\u2014has often\nencouraged a phenomenal conception of evidence, according to which\none's evidence is limited to one's experiences or sense data. On this\npicture, evidence consists of essentially private mental states,\naccessible only to the relevant subject. This picture of evidence\nstands in no small measure of tension with the idea that a central\nfunction of evidence is to serve as a neutral arbiter among competing\nviews. For it is natural to think that the ability of evidence to play\nthis latter role depends crucially on its having an\nessentially public character, i.e., that it is the sort of\nthing which can be grasped and appreciated by multiple\nindividuals. Here, the most natural contenders would seem to be\nphysical objects and the states of affairs and events in which they\nparticipate, since it is such entities that are characteristically\naccessible to multiple observers. (I ask what evidence there is for\nyour diagnosis that the patient suffers from measles; in response, you\nmight simply point to or demonstrate the lesions on\nher skin.) On the other hand, to the extent that one's evidence\nconsists of essentially private states there would seem to be no\npossibility of sharing one's evidence with others. But it is precisely\nthe possibility of sharing relevant evidence which is naturally\nthought to secure the objectivity of science. Indeed, it has often\nbeen held that inasmuch as the objectivity of science is underwritten\nby the fact that science is evidence driven, it is the public\ncharacter of scientific evidence which is crucial. On this view, it is\na central methodological norm of science to eschew as inadmissible\n(e.g.) any alleged episodes of incommunicable insight in considering\nwhether to accept or reject a claim. The theme of the essentially\npublic character of scientific evidence has been prominent from the\nearliest days of modern science\u2014it was championed, for example,\nby Robert Boyle, founder of the Royal Society, who insisted that the\n\u2018witnessing\u2019 of experiments was to be a collective\n act[36]\u2014and\n has remained so up until the present day. Unsurprisingly, the theme\nwas taken up by philosophers of science with gusto. Thus, Hempel\nrequired that \u2018all statements of empirical science be capable of\ntest by reference to evidence which is public, i.e., evidence which\ncan be secured by different observers and does not depend essentially\non the observer\u2019 (1952: 22). The idea was echoed by other\nleading positivists (see, e.g., Feigl 1953) as well as by Popper\n(1959). More recently, in the course of reviewing \u2018some of the\nthings objectivity, and specifically scientific objectivity, has been\nthought to involve\u2019, Peter Railton singles out the idea that\n\n\n \u2026 objective inquiry uses procedures that are intersubjective\nand independent of particular individuals and circumstances\u2014for\nexample \u2026 it makes no essential use of introspective or\nsubjectively privileged evidence in theory assessment (1985: 764).\n \n\n In short, it is not simply that the conception of evidence gleaned\nfrom exemplary scientific practice differs from the conception of\nevidence that traditional epistemology seemed to demand (as would be\nthe case if, for example, one was somewhat more inclusive than the\nother). Rather, what seemed to be one of the characteristic features\nof scientific evidence, viz. its potential publicity, is the exact\ncontrary of one of the characteristic features of evidence as\nconstrued by much traditional epistemology, viz. its privacy. Such a\ntension was bound to generate a certain amount of dissonance. One\nhistorically noteworthy manifestation of this dissonance was the\nprotracted debate within the positivist tradition over the nature of\n\u2018protocol sentences\u2019. Here, Carnap's odyssey is perhaps\nthe most illuminating. Early in his philosophical career, Carnap,\nunder the influence of Russell and Ernst Mach (and through them, the\ntradition of classical empiricism) took sense data as the ultimate\nevidence for all of our empirical knowledge.  (Indeed, his early work\nDer Logischer Aufbau der Welt (1928) is largely devoted to\nthe Russellian project of \u2018constructing\u2019 the external\nworld out of sense data.) During this period, Carnap maintained that\nthe protocol sentences that serve as the \u2018confirmation\nbasis\u2019 for scientific theories refer to sense data or (to be\nmore precise) \u2018the sensing of sense data\u2019. However, under\nthe influence of both Popper and Otto Neurath, Carnap ultimately\nabandoned this view of protocol sentences in favor of one on which\nsuch sentences refer not to private mental events but rather to public\nobjects and states of affairs. As recounted in his philosophical\nautobiography, the primary motivation for this change of heart was the\ngrowing conviction that the conception of evidence as private mental\nstates rendered it inadequate to ground the intersubjectivity and\nobjectivity of\n science.[37]\n In this area as in others, the evolution of Carnap's own views was\ncrucial to the evolution of the views of the Vienna Circle as a whole.\nThe episode was well-recounted years later by Ayer: \n\n At the outset \u2026 the prevailing view was that these\n[observation] statements referred to the subject's introspectible or\nsensory experiences \u2026 [I]t was held, following Russell and\nultimately Berkeley, that perceiving physical objects was to be\nanalyzed in terms of having sensations, or as Russell put it, of\nsensing sense data. Though physical objects might be publicly\naccessible, sense data were taken to be private. There could be no\nquestion of our literally sharing one another's sense data, any more\nthan we can literally share one another's thoughts or images or\nfeelings \u2026 [T]his conception of elementary statements was exposed\nto attack on various grounds.\u2026 [T]he most serious difficulty lay\nin the privacy of the objects to which the elementary statements were\nsupposed to refer.\u2026 Because of such difficulties, Neurath, and\nsubsequently Carnap, rejected the whole conception of elementary\nstatements. They argued that if elementary statements were to serve as\nthe basis for the intersubjective statements of science, they must\nthemselves be intersubjective. They must refer, not to private\nincommunicable experiences, but to public physical events (1959:\n17\u201320).\n \n\n Inasmuch as it is the distinctive function of protocol sentences to\nreport one's evidence, a view about what sorts of contents a protocol\nsentence might have is in effect a view about what sorts of things can\ncount as evidence. To abandon a view according to which the subject\nmatter of any protocol sentence concerns the \u2018private\nincommunicable experiences\u2019 of some particular individual is in\neffect to abandon a version of the phenomenal conception of\nevidence. To adopt in its place a view according to which the subject\nmatter of any protocol sentence concerns \u2018public physical\nevents\u2019 is thus a particularly radical shift, inasmuch as this\nlatter view seems to entail that only public physical events\ncan count as evidence\u2014and in particular, that experiences,\nformerly taken to exhaust the category of evidence, are ineligible to\ncount as\n such.[38] \n\n Underneath the positivists' changing views about the nature of\nprotocol sentences, however, lay a fundamental assumption that they\nnever questioned. The assumption in question is the following: that\nthere is some general restriction on the subject matter of a sentence\nif that sentence is a potential statement of one's evidence. This\nassumption was explicitly rejected by Austin: \n\n It is not the case that the formulation of evidence is the function\nof any special sort of sentence.\u2026 In general, any kind\nof statement could state evidence for any other kind, if the\ncircumstances were appropriate.\u2026 (1962: 116; emphases his).\n \n\n According to the alternative picture sketched by Austin, there are,\nindeed, circumstances in which one's having knowledge that things\nare a certain way depends upon one's having\n\u2018phenomenal\u2019 evidence provided by the fact that is how\nthings look, seem, or appear.  Traditional\nepistemology errs, however, in thinking that this is the general\ncase. Indeed, there are circumstances in which the fact that things\nare a certain way constitutes one's evidence for judgements about how\nthey look, seem or\n appear.[39] \n\n Inasmuch as he denies that there are any general restrictions on the\nsubject matter of an evidence statement, Austin's way of thinking\nabout evidence is considerably more liberal or inclusive than that of\nmuch of the tradition. In this respect, his account of evidence\nresembles Williamson's (2000) later theory. As we have seen,\nWilliamson holds that one's evidence consists of everything that one\nknows. In particular, one's evidence is not limited to one's knowledge\nof one's experiences, nor is it limited to one's observational\nknowledge\u2014one's evidence also includes any theoretical\nknowledge that one might possess (p. 190). \n\n On such liberalized views, although one's evidence is not limited to\none's introspectively arrived at knowledge of one's experiences, it\nincludes everything that one knows about one's experiences on\nthe basis of introspection. In this respect, such views are\nincompatible not only with the phenomenal conception of evidence but\nalso with views that would rule out the objects of introspection as\nevidence on the grounds that the objects of introspection lack the\nobjectivity and publicity that is characteristic of genuine\nevidence. However, it is dubious that any view on which evidence plays\na role in justifying belief can consistently observe a constraint\nwhich would preclude the objects of introspection from counting as\ngenuine evidence. Goldman (1997) argues that any such constraint is\ninconsistent with the introspectionist methodology employed in various\nareas of contemporary cognitive science and that this undercuts\n\u2018the traditional view \u2026 that scientific evidence can be\nproduced only by intersubjective methods that can be used by different\ninvestigators and will produce agreement\u2019 (p. 95).\n\n Reflection on examples drawn from more homely contexts also casts\ndoubt on the idea that all genuine evidence is in principle accessible\nto multiple individuals. When one has a headache, one is typically\njustified in believing that one has a headache. While others might\nhave evidence that one has a headache\u2014evidence afforded,\nperhaps, by one's testimony, or by one's non-linguistic\nbehavior\u2014it is implausible that whatever evidence others\npossess is identical with that which justifies one's own belief that\none has a headache. Indeed, it seems dubious that others could have\none's evidence, given that others cannot literally share one's\nheadache. \n\n Here then we see another context in which theoretical demands are\nplaced on the concept of evidence that seem to pull in different\ndirections. On the one hand, it is thought central to the concept of\nevidence that evidence is by its very nature the kind of thing that\ncan generate rational convergence of opinion in virtue of being shared\nby multiple individuals. This encourages the idea that any genuine\npiece of evidence can in principle be grasped by multiple individuals;\nanything which cannot be so grasped is either not genuine evidence or\nis at best a degenerate species thereof. On the other hand, evidence\nis taken to be that which justifies belief. And it seems that many of\nthe beliefs which individuals hold about their own mental lives on the\nbasis of introspection are justified by factors with respect to which\nthey enjoy privileged access. Notably, the positivists' embrace of the\nidea that protocol sentences refer exclusively to publicly-observable\nphysical objects and events was accompanied by an embrace of\nbehaviorism in\n psychology.[40]\n It is characteristic of behaviorism to denigrate the idea that the\ndeliverances of introspection can constitute genuine evidence; on this\ncombination of views then, the thesis that all evidence consists of\nthat which can be shared by multiple observers is upheld. For those who\nreject behaviorism, however, the idea that at least some evidence does\nnot meet this condition is a more difficult one to resist.\n",
