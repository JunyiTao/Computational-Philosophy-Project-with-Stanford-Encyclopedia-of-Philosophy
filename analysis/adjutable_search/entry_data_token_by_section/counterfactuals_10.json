    "main_text": "The Logic of Counterfactuals || Truth-Conditions Revisited\n2.5 Truth-Conditions Revisited\n\n\nIn their own ways, Stalnaker (1968,\n1984) and D. lewis (1973b) are\ncandid that the similarity analysis is not a complete analysis of\ncounterfactuals. As should be clear\nfrom \u00a72.3, the formal constraints they\nplace on similarity are quite minimal and only serve to settle matters\nof logic. There are, in general, very many possible selection\nfunctions\u2014and corresponding conceptions of similarity\u2014for\nany given counterfactual. To explain how a given counterfactual\nlike (40) expresses a true proposition, a\nsimilarity analysis must specify which particular conception of\nsimilarity informs it.\n\n\n(40)\nIf my computer were off, the screen would be blank.\n\n \n\nOf course, the strict analysis is in the same position. It cannot\npredict the truth of (40) without specifying\na particular accessibility relation. In turn, the same question\narises: on what basis do ordinary speakers determine some worlds to be\naccessible and others not? This section will overview attempts to\nanswer these questions, and the many counterexamples those attempts\nhave invited. These counterexamples have been a central motivation for\npursuing alternative semantic analyses, which will be covered\nin \u00a73. While this section follows\nthe focus of the literature on the similarity analysis\n(\u00a72.5.1), \u00a72.5.2\nwill briefly detail how parallel criticisms apply to strict\nanalyses.\n2.5.1 Truth-Conditions and Similarity\n\n\nWhat determines which worlds are counted as most similar when\nevaluating a counterfactual? Stalnaker\n(1968) explicitly sets this issue aside,\nbut D. Lewis (1973b: 92) makes a clear\nproposal:\n\nLewis\u2019 (1973b: 92) Proposal\nOur familiar, intuitive concept of comparative overall similarity, just applied to possible worlds, is employed in assessing counterfactuals. \n\n\nJust as counterfactuals are context-dependent and vague, so is our\nintuitive notion of overall similarity. In comparing cost of living,\nNew York and San Francisco may count as similar, but not in comparing\ntopography. And yet, Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92)\nProposal has faced a barrage of counterexamples. Lewis and\nStalnaker parted ways in their responses to these counterexamples,\nthough both grant that Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92)\nProposal was not viable. Stalnaker (1984:\nCh.7) proposes the projection strategy: similarity is\ndetermined by the way we \u201cproject our epistemic policies onto\nthe world\u201d. D. Lewis 1979)\nproposes a new system of weights that amounts to a kind of\ncurve-fitting: we must first look to which counterfactuals are\nintuitively true, and then find ways of weighting respects of\nsimilarity\u2014however complex\u2014that support the truth of\ncounterfactuals. Since Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92)\nProposal and Lewis\u2019 (1979)\nsystem of weights are more developed, and have received extensive\ncritical attention, they will be the focus of this\nsection.[35]\nIt will begin with the objections to Lewis\u2019\n(1973b: 92) Proposal that motivated Lewis\u2019\n(1979) system of weights, and then some\nobjections to that approach.\n\nFine (1975: 452) presents\nthe future similarity objection\nto Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92)\nProposal. (41) is plausibly a true\nstatement about world history.\n\n\n(41)\nIf Nixon had pressed the button there would have a been a nuclear holocaust\n    (\\(\\mathsf{B>H}\\))\n\n \n\nSuppose, optimistically, that there never will be a nuclear\nholocaust. Then, for every \\(\\mathsf{B\\land H}\\)-world, there will be\na more similar \\(\\mathsf{B\\land\\neg H}\\)-world, one where a small\ndifference prevents the holocaust, such as a malfunction in the\nelectrical detonation system. In short, a world where Nixon presses\nthe button and a malfunction prevents a nuclear holocaust is more like\nour own than one where there is a nuclear holocaust that changes the\nface of the planet. But then Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92)\nProposal incorrectly predicts\nthat (41) is false.\n\nTich\u00fd (1976: 271) offers a\nsimilar\ncounterexample. Given\n (42a)\u2013(42c),\n (42d)\n sounds false. \n\n\n\n(42)\n\n\na.\nInvariably, if it is raining, Jones wears his hat.\nb.\nIf it is not raining, Jones wears his hat at random.\nc.\nToday, it is raining and so Jones is wearing his hat.\nd.\nBut, even if it had not been raining, Jones would have been wearing his hat.\n\n\n\nLewis\u2019 (1973b: 92) Proposal  does not seem to predict the falsity of (42d). After all, Jones is wearing his hat in the actual world, so isn\u2019t a world where it\u2019s not raining and he\u2019s wearing his hat more similar to the actual one than one where it\u2019s not raining and he isn\u2019t wearing his hat?\n\n(1979: 472) responds to these examples by proposing a ranked system of weights that give what he calls the standard resolution of similarity, which may be further modulated in context:\n\n\nLewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights\n\nAvoid big, widespread, diverse violations of law. (\u201cbig miracles\u201d) \nMaximize the spatio-temporal region throughout which perfect match of particular fact \n\t\t\t\tprevails.\n\nMaximize the time period over which the worlds match exactly in matters of fact\n\nAvoid even small, localized, simple violations of law. (\u201clittle miracles\u201d) \nIt is of little or no importance to secure approximate similarity of particular fact, even in matters that concern us greatly. \n\n\n\nWhile weight 2 gives high importance to keeping particular facts fixed up to the change required by the counterfactual, weight 4 makes clear that particular facts after that point need not be kept fixed. In the case of (42d) the fact that Jones is wearing his hat need not be kept fixed. It was a post-rain fact, so when one counterfactually supposes that it had not been raining, there is no reason to assume that Jones is still wearing his hat. Similarly, with example (41). A world where Nixon pushes the button, a small miracle occurs to short-circuit the equipment and the nuclear holocaust is prevented will count as less similar than one where there is no small miracle and a nuclear holocaust results. A small-miracle and no-holocaust world is similar to our own only in one insignificant respect (particular matters of fact) and dissimilar in one important respect (the small miracle).\n\nIt is clear, however, that Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights  is insufficiently general. Particular matters of fact often are held fixed. \n\n\n(43)\n[You\u2019re invited to bet heads on a coin-toss. You decline. The coin comes up heads.] See, if you had bet heads you would have won! (Slote 1978: 27 fn33)\n(44)\nIf we had bought one more artichoke this morning, we would have had one for everyone at dinner tonight. (Sanford 1989: 173)\n\nExample (43) crucially holds fixed the outcome of a highly contingent particular fact: the coin outcome. Cases of this kind are discussed extensively by Edgington (2004). Example (44) shows that a chancy outcome is not an essential feature of these cases. Noting the existence of recalcitrant cases, (1979: 472) simply says he wishes he knew why they came out differently. Additional counterexamples to the Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights  have been proposed by Bowie (1979), Kment (2006), and Wasserman (2006).[36] Kment (2006: 458) proposes a new similarity metric to handle this example which is sensitive to the way particular facts are explained, and is integrated into a general account of metaphysical modality in Kment (2014). Ippolito (2016) proposes a new theory of how context determines similarity for counterfactuals which aims to make the correct predictions about many of the above cases.\n\nAnother response to these counterexamples has been to develop alternative semantic analyses of counterfactuals such as premise semantics (Kratzer 1989, 2012; Veltman 2005) and causal models (Schulz 2007 2011;  Briggs 2012; Kaufmann 2013). These accounts start from the observation that the counterexamples can be easily explained in a model where matters of fact depend on each other. In (42), when we counterfactually retract the fact that it rained, we don\u2019t keep the fact that the man was wearing his hat because that fact depended on it raining. Hence, (42d) is false. In (43), when we counterfactually retract that you didn\u2019t bet on heads, we keep the fact that the coin came up heads because it is independent of the fact that you didn\u2019t bet on heads. These accounts offer models of how laws, and law-like generalizations, make facts dependent on each other, and argue that once this is done, there is no work left for similarity to do in the semantics of counterfactuals. While these accounts are the focus of \u00a73, it is worth presenting one of the additional counterexamples to the similarity analysis that has emerged from this literature.\n\nRecall (38) from \u00a72.4. Champollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang (2016) and Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion (forthcoming) argue on the basis of this example that any similarity analysis will make incorrect predictions about the truth-conditions of counterfactuals. In this example a light is on either when Switch A and B are both up, or they are both down. Otherwise the light is off. Suppose both switches are up and the light is on.\n\n\n(38)\n\n\na.\nIf Switch A or Switch B were down, the light would be off. \n        \\(\\mathsf{(\\neg A\\lor\\neg B)>\\neg L}\\)\nb.\nIf Switch A and Switch B were not both up, the light would be off. \n        \\(\\mathsf{\\neg (A\\land B)>\\neg L}\\)\n\n\n\nIntuitively, (38a) is true, as are \\(\\mathsf{\\neg A >\\neg L}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{\\neg B >\\neg L}\\), but (38b) is false. Champollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang (2016: 321) argue that a similarity analysis cannot predict \\(\\mathsf{\\neg A >\\neg L}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{\\neg B >\\neg L}\\) to be true, while (38b) is false. In order for \\(\\mathsf{\\neg A >\\neg L}\\) to be true, the particular fact that Switch B is up must count towards similarity. Similarly, for \\(\\mathsf{\\neg B >\\neg L}\\) to be true, the particular fact that Switch A is up must count towards similarity. But then it follows that (38b) is true on a similarity analysis: the most similar worlds where A and B are not both up have to either be worlds where Switch B is down but Switch A is still up, or Switch A is down and Switch B is still up. In those worlds, the light would be off, so the similarity analysis incorrectly predicts (38b) to be true. Champollion, Ciardelli, and Zhang (2016) instead pursue a semantics in terms of causal models where counterfactually making \\(\\neg \\mathsf{(A\\land B)}\\) true and making \\(\\mathsf{\\neg A\\lor\\neg B}\\) true come apart.\n2.5.2 Truth-Conditions and the Strict Analysis\n\nDo strict analyses avoid the troubles faced by similarity analyses when it comes to truth-conditions? This question is difficult to answer, and has not been explicitly discussed in the literature. Other than the theory of Warmbr\u014dd (1981a,b), strict theorists have not made proposals for the accessibility relation analogous to Lewis\u2019 (1973b: 92) Proposal  for similarity. And, Warmbr\u014dd\u2019s proposal about the pragmatics of the accessibility relation is this:\n\nWarmbr\u014dd\u2019s (1981b: 280) Proposal\nIn the normal case of interpreting a conditional with a nonabsurd antecedent p, the worlds accessible from w will be those that are as similar to w as the most similar p-worlds.\n\n\n\nAll subsequent second wave strict analyses have ended up in similar\nterritory. The dynamic analyses developed\nby Fintel\n(2001), Gillies (2007),\nand Willer (2015, 2017, 2018) assign\nstrict truth-conditions to counterfactuals, but have them induce\nchanges in an evolving space of possible worlds. These changes must\nrender the antecedent consistent with an evolving body of\ndiscourse. While Fintel (2001)\nand Willer (2018) explicitly appeal to a\nsimilarity ordering for this purpose, Gillies\n(2007) and Willer (2017) do\nnot. Nevertheless, the formal structures used\nby Gillies (2007)\nand Willer (2017) for this purpose give\nrise to the same question: which facts stay and which facts go when\nrendering the counterfactual antecedent consistent? Accordingly, at\npresent, it does not appear that the strict analysis avoids the kinds\nof concerns raised for the similarity analysis\nin \u00a72.5.1.\n2.6 Philosophical Objections\n\nRecall Goodman\u2019s Problem\nfrom \u00a71.4: the truth-conditions of\ncounterfactuals intuitively depend on background facts and laws, but\nit is difficult to specify these facts and laws in a way that does not\nitself appeal to counterfactuals. Strict and similarity analyses make\nprogress on the logic of conditionals without directly confronting\nthis problem. But the discussion\nof \u00a7 2.5 makes salient a\nrelated problem. Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of\nWeights amounts to reverse-engineering a similarity relation to\nfit the intuitive truth-conditions of counterfactuals. While\nLewis\u2019 (1979) approach avoids\ncharacterizing laws and facts in counterfactual\nterms, Bowie (1979: 496\u2013497)\nargues that it does not explain why certain counterfactuals are true\nwithout appealing to counterfactuals. Suppose one asks why certain\ncounterfactuals are true and the similarity theorist replies with\nLewis\u2019 (1979) recipe for\nsimilarity. If one asks why those facts about similarity make\ncounterfactuals true, the similarity theorist cannot reply that they\nare basic self-evident truths about the similarity of worlds. Instead,\nthey must say that those similarity facts make those counterfactuals\ntrue. Bowie\u2019s (1979:\n496\u2013497) criticism is that this is at best uninformative,\nand at worst circular.\n\nA related concern is voiced by Horwich (1987:\n172) who asks \u201cwhy we should have evolved such a baroque\nnotion of counterfactual dependence\u201d, namely that captured\nby Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of\nWeights. The concern has two components: why would humans find it\nuseful, and why would human psychology ground counterfactuals in this\nconcept of similarity rather than our ready-at-hand intuitive concept\nof overall similarity? These questions are given more weight given the\ncentrality of counterfactuals to human rationality and scientific\nexplanation outlined in \u00a71. Psychological\ntheories of counterfactual reasoning and representation have found\ntools other than similarity more fruitful\n(\u00a71.2). Similarly, work on\nscientific explanation has not assigned any central role for\nsimilarity (1.3), and\nas H\u00e1jek (2014: 250) puts it:\n\n\nScience has no truck with a notion of similarity; nor does\nLewis\u2019 (1979) ordering of what\nmatters to similarity have a basis in science.\n\nMorreau (2010) has recently argued on\n formal grounds that similarity is poorly suited to the task assigned\n to it by the similarity analysis. The similarity analysis, especially\n as elaborated by D. Lewis (1979), tries\n to weigh some similarities between worlds against their differences\n to arrive at a notion of overall comparative similarity between those\n worlds. Morreau (2010: 471) argues\n that:\n\n\n[w]e cannot add up similarities or weigh them against differences. Nor\ncan we combine them in any other way\u2026 No useful comparisons of\noverall similarity result. (Morreau 2010:\n\u00a74)\n\n\narticulates this argument formally via a reinterpretation of\nArrow\u2019s Theorem in social choice theory. Arrow\u2019s Theorem\nshows that it is not possible to aggregate individuals\u2019\npreferences regarding some alternative outcomes into a coherent\n\u201ccollective preference\u201d ordering over those outcomes,\ngiven minimal assumptions about their rationality and autonomy. As\nsummarized in \u00a76.3\nof Arrow\u2019s\ntheorem, Morreau (2010) argues that\nthe same applies to aggregating respects of similarity and difference:\nthere is no way to add them up into a coherent notion of overall\nsimilarity.\n2.7 Summary\n\nStrict and similarity analyses of counterfactuals showed that it was\npossible to address the semantic puzzles described\nin \u00a71.4 with formally explicit\nlogical models. This dispelled widespread skepticism of\ncounterfactuals and established a major area of interdisciplinary\nresearch. Strict analyses have been revealed to provide a stronger,\nmore classical, logic, but must be integrated with a pragmatic\nexplanation of how counterfactual antecedents are interpreted\nnon-monotonically. Similarity analyses provide a much weaker, more\nnon-classical, logic, but capture the non-monotonic interpretation of\ncounterfactual antecedents within their core semantic model. It is now\na highly subtle and intensely debated question which analysis provides\na better logic for counterfactuals, and which version of each kind of\nanalysis is best. This intense scrutiny and development has also\ngenerated a wave of criticism focused on their treatment of\ntruth-conditions, Goodman\u2019s Problem, and\nintegration with thinking about counterfactuals in psychology and the\nphilosophy of science\n(\u00a72.5, \u00a72.6). None\nof these criticisms are absolutely conclusive, and these two analyses,\nparticularly the similarity analysis, remain standard in philosophy\nand linguistics. However, the criticisms are serious enough to merit\nexploring alternative analyses. These alternative accounts take\ninspiration from a particular diagnosis of the counterexamples\ndiscussed in \u00a72.5: facts\ndepend on each other, so counterfactually assuming p involves\nnot just giving up not-p, but any facts which depended\non not-p. The next section will examine analyses of this\nkind.\n3. Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence\n\nSimilarity and strict analyses nowhere refer to facts, or\npropositions, depending on each\nother. Indeed, 1979 was primarily\nconcerned with explaining which true counterfactuals, given a\nsimilarity analysis, manifest a relation of counterfactual\ndependence. Other analyses have instead started with the idea that\nfacts depend on each other, and then explain how these relations of\ndependence make counterfactuals true. As will become clear, none of\nthese analyses endorse the naive idea that \\(\\mathsf{A > B}\\) is\ntrue only when B counterfactually depends on A. The\ndependence can be more complex, indirect, or B could just be\ntrue and independent of A. Theories in this family differ\ncrucially in how they model counterfactual dependence. In premise\nsemantics (\u00a73.1) dependence is modeled in\nterms of how facts, which are modeled as parts of worlds, are\ndistributed across a space of worlds that has been constrained by\nlaws, or law-like generalizations. In probabilistic semantics\n(\u00a73.2), this dependence is modeled as\nsome form of conditional probability. In Bayesian networks, structural\nequations, and causal models\n(\u00a73.3), it is modeled in\nterms of the Bayesian networks discussed at the beginning\nof \u00a71.2.3. Because theories of\nthese three kinds are very much still in development and often involve\neven more sophisticated formal models than those covered\nin \u00a72, this section will have to be more\ncursory than \u00a72 to ensure breadth and\naccessibility.\n3.1 Premise Semantics\n\nVeltman (1976)\nand Kratzer (1981b) approached\ncounterfactuals from a perspective closer\nto Goodman (1947): counterfactuals\ninvolve explicitly adjusting a body of premises, facts or propositions\nto be consistent with the counterfactual\u2019s antecedent, and\nchecking to see if the consequent follows from the revised premise\nset\u2014in a sense of \u201cfollow\u201d to be articulated\ncarefully. Since facts or premises hang together, changing one\nrequires changing others that depend on it. The function of\ncounterfactuals is to allow us to probe these connections between\nfacts. While D. Lewis (1981) proved that\nthe Kratzer (1981b) analysis was a\nspecial case of similarity semantics, subsequent refinements of\npremise semantics in Kratzer (1989, 1990, 2002,\n2012) and Veltman (2005)\nevidenced important differences. Kratzer (1989:\n626) nicely captures the key difference:\n\n\n[I]t is not that the similarity theory says anything false about [particular] examples\u2026 It just doesn\u2019t say enough. It stays vague where our intuitions are relatively sharp. I think we should aim for a theory of counterfactuals that is able to make more concrete predictions with respect to particular examples.\n\n\nFrom a logical point of view, premise semantics and similarity semantics do not diverge. They diverge in the concrete predictions made about the truth-conditions of counterfactuals in particular contexts without adding additional constraints to the theory like Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights.\n\nHow does premise semantics aim to improve on the predictions of similarity semantics? It re-divides the labor between context and the semantics of counterfactuals to more accurately capture the intuitive truth-conditions of counterfactuals, and intuitive characterizations of how context influences counterfactuals. In premise semantics, context provides facts and law-like relations among them, and the counterfactual semantics exploits this information. By contrast, the similarity analysis assumes that context somehow makes a similarity relation salient, and has to make further stipulations like Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights  about how facts and laws enter into the truth-conditions of counterfactuals in particular contexts. This can be illustrated by considering how Tich\u00fd\u2019s (1976) example (42) is analyzed in premise semantics. This illustration will use the Veltman (2005) analysis because it is simpler than Kratzer (1989, 2012)\u2014that is not to say it is preferable. The added complexity in Kratzer (1989, 2012) provides more flexibility and a broader empirical range including quantification and modal expressions other than would-counterfactuals.\n\nRecall Tich\u00fd\u2019s (1976) example, with the intuitively false counterfactual (42d): \n\n\n(42)\n\n\na.\nInvariably, if it is raining, Jones wears his hat.\nb.\nIf it is not raining, Jones wears his hat at random.\nc.\nToday, it is raining and so Jones is wearing his hat.\nd.\nBut, even if it had not been raining, Jones would have been wearing his hat.\n\n\n\n Veltman (2005) models how the sentences leading up to the counterfactual (42d) determine the facts and laws relevant to its interpretation. The law-like generalization in (42a) is treated as a strict conditional which places a hard constraint on the space of worlds relevant to evaluating the counterfactual.[37] The particular facts introduced by (42c) provide a soft constraint on the worlds relevant to interpreting the counterfactual. Figure  9 illustrates this model of the context and its evolution, including a third atomic sentence \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) for reasons that will become clear shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(C_0\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{W}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{H}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_0}\\)\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_1}\\)\n0\n0\n1 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_2}\\)\n0\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_3}\\)\n0\n1\n1 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_4}\\)\n1\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_5}\\)\n1\n0\n1 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_6}\\)\n1\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_7}\\)\n1\n1\n1 \n\n\n\n\\(\\hspace{15px}\\underrightarrow{\\medsquare(\\mathsf{R\\supset W})}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(C_1\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{W}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{H}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_0}\\)\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_1}\\)\n0\n0\n1 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_2}\\)\n0\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_3}\\)\n0\n1\n1 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_4}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\) \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_5}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_6}\\)\n1\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_7}\\)\n1\n1\n1 \n\n\n\n\\(\\quad\\underrightarrow{\\mathsf{R\\land W}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(C_2\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{R}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{W}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{H}\\) \n\n\\(w_0\\)\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\\(w_1\\)\n0\n0\n1 \n\n\\(w_2\\)\n0\n1\n0 \n\n\\(w_3\\)\n0\n1\n1 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_4}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\) \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_5}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_6}\\)\n1\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_7}\\)\n1\n1\n1 \n\n\n\nFigure 9: Context for (42), Facts in Bold, Laws Crossing out Worlds\n\n\nOn this model a context provides a set of worlds compatible with the facts, in \\(C_2\\) \\(\\textit{Facts}_{C_2}={\\{w_6,w_7\\}}\\), and the set of worlds compatible with the laws, in \\(C_2\\) \\(\\textit{Universe}_{C_2}={\\{w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3,w_6,w_7\\}}\\). This model of context is one essential component of the analysis, but so too is the way Veltman (2005) models worlds, situations, and dependencies between facts. These further components allow Veltman (2005) to offer a procedure for \u201cretracting\u201d the fact that \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) holds from a world.\n\nVeltman\u2019s (2005) analysis of counterfactuals identifies possible worlds with atomic valuations (functions from atomic sentences to truth-values) like those depicted in Figure  9. So \\(w_6={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{R},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{W},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{H},0\\rangle}\\}}\\). This makes it possible to offer a simple model of situations, which are parts of worlds: any subset of a world.[38] It is now easy to think about one fact (sentence having a truth-value) as determining another fact (sentence having a truth value). In context \\(C_3\\), \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) being 1 determines that \\(\\mathsf{W}\\) will be 1. Once you know that \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is assigned to 1, you know that \\(\\mathsf{W}\\) is too. Veltman\u2019s (2005) proposal is that speakers evaluate a counterfactual by retracting the fact that the antecedent is false from the worlds in the context, which gives you some situations, and then consider all those worlds that contain those situations, are compatible with the laws, and make the antecedent true. If the consequent is true in all of those worlds, then we can say that the counterfactual is true in (or supported by) the context. So, to evaluate \\(\\neg \\mathsf{R>W}\\), one first retracts the fact that \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is true, i.e., that \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is assigned to 1, then one finds all the worlds consistent with the laws that contain those situations and assign \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) to 0. If all of those worlds are also \\(\\mathsf{W}\\) worlds, then the counterfactual is true in (or supported by) the context. For Veltman (2005), the characterization of this retraction process relies essentially on the idea of facts determining other facts.\n\nAccording to Veltman (2005), when you are \u201cretracting\u201d a fact from the facts in the context, you begin by considering each \\(w\\in \\textit{Facts}_C\\) and find the smallest situations in w which contain only undetermined facts\u2014he calls such a situation a basis for w. This is a minimal situation which, given the laws constraining \\(\\textit{Universe}_C\\), determines all the other facts about that world. For example, \\(w_6\\) has only one basis, namely \\(s_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{R},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{H},0\\rangle}\\}}\\), and \\(w_7\\) has only one basis, namely \\(s_1={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{R},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{H},1\\rangle}\\}}\\). Once you have the bases for a world, you can retract a fact by finding the smallest change to the basis that no longer forces that fact to be true. So retracting the fact that \\(\\mathsf{R}\\) is true from \\(s_0\\) produces \\(s'_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{H},0\\rangle}\\}}\\), and retracting it from \\(s_1\\) produces \\(s'_1={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{H},1\\rangle}\\}}\\). The set consisting of these two situations is the premise set.\n\nTo evaluate \\(\\mathsf{\\neg R>W}\\), one finds the set of worlds from \\(\\textit{Universe}_{C_3}\\) that contains some member of the premise set \\(s'_0\\) or \\(s'_1\\): \\({\\{w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3\\}}\\)\u2014these are the worlds consistent with the premise set and the laws. Are all of the \\(\\neg \\mathsf{R}\\)-worlds in \\({\\{w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3\\}}\\) also \\(\\mathsf{W}\\)-worlds? No, \\(w_2\\) and \\(w_3\\) are not. Thus, \\(\\neg \\mathsf{R>W}\\) is not true in (or supported by) the context \\(C_3\\). This was the intuitively correct prediction about example (42). Of course, the similarity analysis supplemented with Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of Weights  also makes this prediction. But consider again example (43), which is not predicted: \n\n\n(43)[You\u2019re invited to bet heads on a coin-toss. You decline. The coin comes up heads.] See, if you had bet heads you would have won! (Slote 1978: 27 fn33)\nThis example relies seamlessly on three pieces of background knowledge about how betting works:\n\nIf you don\u2019t bet, you don\u2019t win: \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare(\\neg B\\supset\\neg W)}\\)\nIf you bet and it comes up heads, you win: \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((B\\land H)\\supset W)}\\)\nIf you bet and it doesn\u2019t come up heads, you don\u2019t win: \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((B\\land\\neg H)\\supset\\neg W)}\\)\n\n\nAnd it specifies facts: \\(\\mathsf{\\neg B\\land H}\\). The resulting context is detailed in Figure  10:\n\n\n\nC(43)\n\\(\\mathsf{B}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{H}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{W}\\) \n\n\\(w_0\\)\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_2}\\)\n0\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_3}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(w_4\\)\n1\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_5}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_6}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\) \n\n\\(w_7\\)\n1\n1\n1 \n\nFigure 10: Context for (43)\n\n\nNow, consider the counterfactual \\(\\mathsf{B>W}\\). The first step is to retract the fact that \\(\\mathsf{B}\\) is false from each world in \\(\\textit{Facts}_{C_{(43)}}\\). That\u2019s just \\(w_2\\). This world has two bases\u2014minimal situations consisting of undetermined facts\u2014\\(s_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{B},0\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{H},1\\rangle}\\}}\\) and \\(s_1={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{H},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{W},0\\rangle}\\}}\\).[39] The next step is to retract the fact that \\(\\mathsf{B}\\) is false from both bases. For \\(s_0\\) this yields \\(s'_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{H},1\\rangle}\\}}\\) and for \\(s_1\\) this also yields \\(s'_0\\)\u2014since the fact that you didn\u2019t win together with the fact that the coin came up heads, forces it to be false that you bet. Given this situation, the premise set consists of the two worlds in Universe(43) that contain \\(s'_0\\): \\({\\{w_2,w_7\\}}\\). Now, are all of the \\(\\mathsf{B}\\)-worlds in this set also \\(\\mathsf{W}\\)-worlds? Yes, \\(w_7\\) is the only \\(\\mathsf{B}\\)-world, and it is also a \\(\\mathsf{W}\\)-world. So Veltman (2005) correctly predicts that (43) is true in (supported by) its natural context.\n\nIt should now be more clear how premise semantics delivers on its promise to be more predictive than similarity semantics when it comes to counterfactuals in context, and affords a more natural characterization of how a context informs the interpretation of counterfactuals. This analysis was crucially based on the idea that some facts determine other facts, and that the process of retracting a fact is constrained by these relations. However, even premise semantics has encountered counterexamples.\n\nSchulz (2007: 101) poses the following counterexample to Veltman (2005). \n\n\n(45)\n\n\na.\nIf both Switch A and Switch B are up, the light is on.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((A\\land B)\\supset L)}\\)\nb.\nIf either Switch A or Switch B is down, the light is off.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((\\neg A\\lor\\neg B)\\supset \\neg L)}\\)\nc.\nSwitch A is up, Switch B is down, and the light is off.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{A\\land\\neg B\\land\\neg L}\\)\nd.\nIf Switch B had been up, the light would have been on.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\)\n\n\n\nIntuitively, (45d) is true in the context. Figure  11 details the context predicted for it by Veltman (2005).\n\n\n\n\\(C_2\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{B}\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{L}\\) \n\n\\(w_0\\)\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(w_2\\)\n0\n1\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_3}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{w_4}\\)\n1\n0\n0 \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_5}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\) \n\n\\(\\xcancel{w_6}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{1}\\)\n\\(\\xcancel{0}\\) \n\n\\(w_7\\)\n1\n1\n1 \n\nFigure 11: Context for (45d)\n\n\nThere are two bases for \\(w_4\\): \\(s_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{A},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{L},0\\rangle}\\}}\\)\u2014the fact that Switch A is up and the light is off determines that Switch B is down\u2014and \\(s_1={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{A},1\\rangle},{\\langle \\mathsf{B},0\\rangle}\\}}\\)\u2014the fact that Switch A is up and the fact that B is down determines that the light is off. (No smaller situation would determine the facts of \\(w_4\\).) Retracting \\(\\mathsf{B}\\)\u2019s falsity from \\(s_0\\) leads to trouble. \\(s_0\\) forces \\(\\mathsf{B}\\) to be false, but there are two ways of changing this. First, one can remove the fact that the light is on, yielding \\(s'_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{A},1\\rangle}\\}}\\). Second, one can eliminate the fact that Switch A is up, yielding \\(s''_0={\\{{\\langle \\mathsf{L},0\\rangle}\\}}\\). Because of \\(s''_0\\), the premise set will contain \\(w_2\\), meaning it allows that in retracting the fact that Switch B is down one can give up the fact that Switch A is up. But then there is a \\(\\mathsf{B}\\)-world where \\(\\mathsf{L}\\) is false, and \\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\) is incorrectly predicted to be false.\n\nIntuitively, the analysis went wrong in allowing the removal of the fact that Switch A is up when retracting the fact that Switch B is down. Schulz (2007: \u00a75.5) provides a more sophisticated version of this diagnosis: although the fact that Switch A is up and the fact that the light is off together determine that Switch B is down, only the fact that the light is off depends on the fact that Switch B is down. If one could articulate this intuitive concept of dependence, and instead only retract facts that depend on the fact you are retracting (in this case the fact that B is down), then the error could be avoided. It is unclear how to implement this kind of dependence in Veltman\u2019s (2005) framework. Schulz (2007: \u00a75.5) goes on show that structural equations and causal models provide the necessary concept of dependence\u2014for more on this approach see \u00a73.3 below. After all, it seems plausible that the light being off causally depends on Switch B being down, but Switch A being up does not causally depend on Switch B being down. It remains to be seen whether the more powerful framework developed by Kratzer (1989, 2012) can predict (45).\n3.2 Conditional Probability Analyses\n\nWhile premise semantics has been prominent among linguists, probabilistic theories have been very prominent among philosophers thinking about knowledge and scientific explanation.[40] Adams (1965, 1975) made a seminal proposal in this literature:\n\nAdams\u2019 Thesis\nThe assertability of q if p is proportional to \\(P(q\\mid p)\\), where P is a probability function representing the agent\u2019s subjective credences\u2014see Definition  1.\n\n\nHowever, Adams (1970) was also aware\nthat indicative/subjunctive pairs\nlike (3)/(4)\ndiffer in their assertability. To explain this, he proposed\nthe prior probability analysis of\ncounterfactuals (Adams 1976):\n\nAdams\u2019 Prior Probability Analysis The\nassertability of \\(\\phi>\\psi\\) is proportional to\n\\(P_0(\\psi\\mid\\phi)\\), where \\(P_0\\) is the agent\u2019s credence\nprior to learning that \\(\\phi\\) was false.\n\n\nIt would seem that this analysis accurately predicts our intuitions\nin (45) about \\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\). Let\n\\(P_0\\) be an agent\u2019s credence before learning that Switch B is\ndown. (45a) requires that\n\\(P_0(\\mathsf{L}\\mid \\mathsf{A\\land B})\\) is (or is close to)\n1, (45b) requires that \\(P_0(\\mathsf{\\neg\nL}\\mid \\mathsf{\\neg A\\lor \\neg B})\\) is (or is close to) 1. The agent\nalso learns that Switch A is up, so \\(P_0(\\mathsf{A})\\) is (or is\nclose to) 1. All of this together seems to guarantee that\n\\(P_0(\\mathsf{B\\mid L})\\) is also very high. However, this is due to\nan inessential artifact of the example: the agent learned that Switch\nB was down after learning that Switch A is up. This detail\ndoes not matter to the intuition. As was seen with\nexample (43), we often hold fixed facts that\nhappen after the antecedent turns out false. Indeed, Adams\u2019\nPrior Probability Analysis makes the incorrect prediction\nthat (43) is unassertible in its natural\ncontext.\n\nThis problem for Adams\u2019 Prior Probability Analysis is addressed in Edgington (2003, 2004: 21) who amends the analysis: \\(P_0\\) may also reflect any facts the agent learns after they learn that the antecedent is false, provides that those facts are causally independent of the antecedent. This parallels the idea pursued by Schulz (2007: Ch.5) to integrate causal dependence into the analysis of counterfactuals. This idea was also pursued in a probabilistic framework by Kvart (1986, 1992). Kvart (1986, 1992), however, does not propose a prior probability analysis and does not regard the probabilities as subjective credences: they are instead objective probabilities (propensity or objective chance). Skyrms (1981) also proposes a propensity account, but pursues a prior propensity account analogous to the subjective one proposed by Adams (1976).\n\nObjective probability analyses have been popular among philosophers trying to capture the way that counterfactuals feature in physical explanations, and why they are so useful to agents like us in worlds like ours. Loewer (2007) is a good example of such an account, who grounds the truth of certain counterfactuals regarding our decisions like (46) in statistical mechanical probabilities.\n\n\n(46)\nIf I were to decide to bet on the coin\u2019s landing heads, then the chance I would win is 0.5\n\n Loewer (2007) proposes that (46) is true just in case (where \\(P_{\\textit{SM}}\\) is the statistical mechanical probability distribution and \\(M(t)\\) is a description of the macro-state of the universe at t): \n\n\n(47)\n\\(P_{\\textit{SM}}(W\\mid M(t)\\land D_1)=0.5\\)\n\nLoewer (2007) acknowledges that this analysis is limited to counterfactuals like (46). He argues that it can address the philosophical objections to the similarity analysis discussed in \u00a72.6, namely why counterfactuals are useful in scientific explanations, and for agents like us in a world like our own.\n\nConditional probability analyses do not proceed by assigning\ntruth-conditions to (all) counterfactuals. They instead associate them\nwith certain conditional\nprobabilities.[41] This makes it difficult to integrate the\ntheory into a comprehensive compositional semantics and logic for a\nnatural language. Kaufmann (2005 2008)\nmakes important advances here, but it remains an open issue for\nconditional probability analyses. Leitgeb\n(2012a,b) thoroughly develops a new conditional probability\nanalysis which regards \\(\\mathsf{\\phi>\\psi}\\) as true when the\nrelevant conditional probability is sufficiently\nhigh.[42] But\nconditional probability analyses have other limitations. Without\nfurther development, these analyses are limited in their ability to\nexplain how humans judge particular counterfactuals to be true. There\nis a large literature in psychology, beginning\nwith Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982,\nshowing that human reasoning diverges in predictable way from precise\nprobabilistic reasoning. Even if these performance differences\ndidn\u2019t turn up in counterfactuals and conditional probabilities,\nthere is an implementation issue. As discussed\nin \u00a71.2.3, directly implementing\nprobabilistic knowledge makes unreasonable demands on memory. Bayesian\nNetworks are one proposed solution to this implementation issue. They\nare also used in the analysis of causal dependence\n(\u00a71.3), which conditional\nprobability analyses must appeal to anyway. Since Bayesian Networks\ncan also be used to directly formulate a semantics of counterfactuals,\nthey provide an worthwhile alternative to conditional probability\nanalyses despite proceeding from similar assumptions.\n3.3 Bayesian Networks, Structural Equations, and Causal Models\n\nRecall from \u00a71.2.3 the basic idea of a Bayesian Network: rather than storing probability values for all possible combinations of some set of variables, a Bayesian Network represents only the conditional probabilities of variables whose values depend on each other. This can be illustrated for (45). \n\n\n(45)\n\n\na.\nIf both Switch A and Switch B are up, the light is on.\n        \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((A\\land B)\\supset L)}\\)\nb.\nIf either Switch A or Switch B is down, the light is off.\n        \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((\\neg A\\lor\\neg B)\\supset \\neg L)}\\)\nc.\nSwitch A is up, Switch B is down, and the light is off.\n        \\(\\mathsf{A\\land\\neg B\\land\\neg L}\\)\nd.\nIf Switch B had been up, the light would have been on.\n        \\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\)\n\n\n\nSentences (45a)-(45c) can be encoded by the Bayesian Network and structural equations in Figure  12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \nA = 1\\\\\nB = 0\\\\\nL = 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n  Figure\n12: Bayesian Network and Structural Equations for\n (45)\n  Recall that \\(L\\dequal A\\land B\\) means that the value of\nL equals the value of \\(A\\land B\\), but also asymmetrically\ndepends on the value of \\(A\\land B\\): the value of \\(A\\land B\\)\ndetermines the value of L, and not vice-versa. How, given the\nnetwork in\n Figure 12,\n does one evaluate the counterfactual \\(\\mathsf{B>N}\\)? Several\ndifferent answers have been given to this question.\n\nPearl (1995, 2000, 2009, 2013: Ch.7)\nproposes:\n\nInterventionism Evaluate \\(\\mathsf{B > L}\\)\nrelative to a Bayesian Network by removing any incoming arrows to\nB, setting its value to 1, and projecting this change forward\nthrough the remaining network. If L is 1 in the resulting\nnetwork, \\(\\mathsf{B > L}\\) is true; otherwise it\u2019s\nfalse.\n\n\nOn this approach, one simply deletes the assignment \\(B=0\\), replaces\nit with \\(B=1\\), and solves for L using the equation \\(L\\dequal\nA\\land B\\). Since the deletion of \\(B=0\\) does not effect the\nassignment \\(A=1\\), it follows that \\(L=1\\) and that the\ncounterfactual is true. This simple recipe yields the right result.\nPearl nicely sums up the difference between this kind of analysis and\na similarity analysis:\n\n\nIn contrast with Lewis\u2019s theory, counterfactuals are not based\non an abstract notion of similarity among hypothetical worlds;\ninstead, they rest directly on the mechanisms (or \u201claws,\u201d\nto be fancy) that produce those worlds and on the invariant properties\nof those mechanisms. Lewis\u2019s elusive \u201cmiracles\u201d are\nreplaced by principled [interventions] which represent the minimal\nchange (to a model) necessary for establishing the antecedent\u2026\nThus, similarities and priorities\u2014if they are ever\nneeded\u2014may be read into the [interventions] as an\nafterthought\u2026 but they are not basic to the analysis. (Pearl\n2009: 239\u2013240)\n\n\nAs interventionism is stated above, it does not apply to conditionals\nwith logically complex antecedents or consequents. This limitation is\naddressed by Briggs (2012), who also\naxiomatizes and compares the resultant logic to D.\nLewis (1973b) and Stalnaker\n(1968)\u2014significantly extending\nthe analysis and results in Pearl (2009:\nCh.7). Integrations of causal models with premise semantics\n(Schulz 2007, 2011; Kaufmann 2013; Santorio\n2014; Champollion, Ciardelli, & Zhang 2016; Ciardelli, Zhang,\n& Champollion forthcoming) provide another way of\nincorporating an interventionist analysis into a fully compositional\nsemantics. However, interventionism does face other limitations.\n\nHiddleston (2005) presents the following\nexample.\n\n\n(48)\n\n\na.\nIf the cannon is lit, there is a simultaneous flash and bang.\nb.\nThe cannon was not lit, there was no flash, and no bang.\nc.\nBut, if there had been a flash, there would have been a bang.\n\n\n\n\n(48c)\n is intuitively true in this context. The network for\n (48)\n is given in\n Figure 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \nL = 0\\\\\nF = 0\\\\\nB = 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Bayesian Network and\nStructural Equations for\n (48)\n\n\n\nHiddleston (2005) observes that\ninterventionism does not predict \\(\\mathsf{F>B}\\) to be true. It\ntells one to delete the arrow going in to F, set its value to\n1, and project the consequences of doing so. However, none of the\nother values depend on F so they keep their actual values:\n\\(L=0\\) and \\(B=0\\). Accordingly, \\(\\mathsf{F>B}\\) is false,\ncontrary to intuition. Further, because the intervention on F\nhas destroyed its connection to B, it\u2019s not even possible\nto tweak interventionism to allow values to flow backwards (to the\nleft) through the\n network.[43]\n Hiddleston\u2019s (2005)\ncounterexample highlights the possibility of another kind of\ncounterexample featuring embedded conditionals. Consider again the\nnetwork in\n Figure 12.\n The following counterfactual seems true (Starr\n2012: 13).\n\n\n(49)\nIf the light had been on, then if you had flipped Switch A down, the light would be off.\n\n\nAnd, considering a simple match, Fisher (2017b:\n\u00a71) observes that\n (50b)\n is intuitively false.\n\n\n(50)\n\n\na.\nA match is struck but does not light.\nb.\nIf the match had lit, then (even) if it had not been struck, it would have lit.\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, interventionism is destined to make the wrong\nprediction. With\n (49),\n the intervention in the first antecedent removes the connection\nbetween Switch A and the light, so when the antecedent of the\nconsequent is made true by intervention, it does not result in\nL\u2019s value becoming 0. And so the whole counterfactual\ncomes out false. Similarly with\n (50b),\n when the first antecedent is made true by intervention, it stays true\neven after the second antecedent is evaluated. Hence the whole\nconditional is predicted to be true. Fisher\n(2017a) also observes that interventionism also has no way of\ntreating counterlegal counterfactuals like if Switch A had alone\ncontrolled the light, the light would be on.\n\nThese counterexamples to interventionism have stimulated alternative\naccounts like Hiddleston\u2019s (2005)\nminimal network analysis and further developments of that\nanalysis (Rips 2010; Rips & Edwards 2013;\nFisher 2017b). Instead of modifying an existing network to make\nthe antecedent true, this analysis considers alternate networks where\nonly the parent nodes of the antecedent which directly influence it\nare changed to make the antecedent come true. However, Pearl\u2019s\n(2009) interventionist analysis has also\nbeen incorporated into the extended structural models\nanalysis (Lucas & Kemp 2015). This\nanalysis aims to capture interventions as a special case of a more\ngeneral proposal about how antecedents are made true. One important\naspect of this proposal is that interventions often involve inserting\na hidden node that amounts to an unknown cause of the antecedent. The\nanalysis of Snider and Bjorndahl (2015)\npursues a third idea: counterfactuals are not interpreted by\nmanipulating a background network, but instead serve to constrain the\nclass of possible networks compatible with the information shared in a\nconversation, as in Stalnaker\u2019s (1978)\ntheory of\n assertion.[44]\n Among these relations can be cause-to-effect networks as in\n (45d),\n but also networks that involve the antecedent and consequent having a\ncommon cause, as in\n (48c).\n As should be clear, this is a rapidly developing area of research\nwhere it is not possible to identify one analysis as standard or\nrepresentative. It does bear emphasizing that this literature is\ndriven not only by precise formal models, but also by experimental\ndata which is brought to bear on the predictions of these\nanalyses.\n\nA few final philosophical remarks are in order about the kinds of\nanalyses discussed here. If one follows Woodward\n(2002) and Hitchcock\n(2001) in their interpretation of\nthese networks, a structural equation should be viewed as a primitive\ncounterfactual. It follows that this is a non-reductive analysis of\ncounterfactual dependence: it only explains how the truth of\narbitrarily complex counterfactual sentences are grounded in basic\nrelations of counterfactual dependence. However, note in the earlier\nquotation above from Pearl (2009:\n239\u2013240) that he interprets structural equations as basic\nmechanisms or laws, and so arguably counts as an analysis of\ncounterfactuals in terms of laws. These amount to two very different\nphilosophical positions that interact with the philosophical debates\n surveyed in\n \u00a71.3.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that while many working in this framework\napply these networks to causal relations, there is no reason to assume\nthat the analysis would not apply to other kinds of dependence\nrelations. For example, constitutional dependence is at the heart of\ncounterfactuals like: \n\n\n(51)\nIf Socrates hadn\u2019t existed, the set consisting of Socrates wouldn\u2019t have existed.\n\n\nFrom a Bayesian Network approach to mental representation\n (\u00a71.2.3),\n this makes perfect sense: the networks encode probabilistic\ndependence which can come from causal or constitutional facts.\n\nFinally, it is worth highlighting that the philosophical objections\ndirected at the similarity analysis in\n \u00a72.6\n are addressed, at least to some degree, by structural equation\nanalyses. Because the central constructs of this\nanalysis\u2014structural equations and Bayesian Networks\u2014are\nalso employed in models of mental representation, causation, and\nscientific explanation, it grounds counterfactuals in a construct\nalready taken to explain how creatures like us cope with a world like\nthe one we live in.\n3.4 Summary\n\nPremise semantics\n (3.1),\n conditional probability analyses\n (\u00a73.2)\n and structural equation analyses\n (\u00a73.3)\n all aim to analyze counterfactuals by focusing on certain relations\nbetween facts, rather than similarities between worlds. These accounts\nmake clearer and more accurate predictions about particular\ncounterfactuals in context than similarity analyses. But, ultimately,\nboth premise semantics and conditional probability analyses had to\nincorporate causal dependence into their theories. Structural equation\nanalyses do this from the start, and improve further on the\npredictions of premise semantics and conditional probability analyses.\nAnother strength of this analysis is that it integrates elegantly into\nthe broader applications of counterfactuals in theories of\nrationality, mental representation, causation, and scientific\nexplanation surveyed in\n \u00a71.1.\n There is still rapid development of structural equation analyses,\nthough, so it is too early to say where the analysis will stabilize,\nor how it will fair under thorough critical examination.\n4. Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers, linguists, and psychologists remain fiercely divided on\nhow to best understand counterfactuals. Rightly so. They are at the\ncenter of questions of deep human interest\n (\u00a71).\n The renaissance on this topic in the 1970s and 1980s focused on\naddressing certain semantic puzzles and capturing the logic of\ncounterfactuals\n (\u00a72).\n From this seminal literature, similarity analyses (D.\nLewis 1973b; Stalnaker 1968) have enjoyed\nthe most widespread popularity in philosophy\n (\u00a72.3).\n But the logical debate between similarity and strict analyses is\nstill raging, and strict analyses provide a viable logical alternative\n (\u00a72.4).\n Criticisms of these logical analyses have focused recent debates on\nour intuitions about particular utterances of counterfactuals in\nparticular contexts. Structural equation analyses\n (\u00a73.3)\n have emerged as a particularly prominent alternative to similarity\nand strict analyses, which claims to improve on both in significant\nrespects. These analyses are now being actively developed by\nphilosophers, linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists.",
