    "main_text": "Physical Theory and Biological Concepts || Substances and Powers\n6.4 Substances and Powers\nThis leads us to a more focussed discussion of the notion of substance, ousia, and also the role in Galen\u2019s explanations of powers or capacities (dunameis). The notion of ousia in Galen is a complex one, because he uses the term both to refer to material stuffs of various kinds (as in the everyday contemporary English usage of the term \u201csubstance\u201d), and in an Aristotelian metaphysical sense, to refer to something\u2019s essence, what it defintionally is (see above, \u00a73.1). Thus, ousia is used as synonymous with matter (hul\u0113), and contrasted with form, in the embryological treatise Sem.; but the question, \u201cwhat is the ousia of the soul?\u201d admits of non-materialist as well as materialist answers.\nGalen\u2019s conception of ousia is complex and under-researched, involving a huge number of potentially relevant texts; his conception of dunamis is also subtle and difficult to summarize conclusively (see Hankinson 2014). One line of interpretation that seems plausible in relation to ousia is that its very homonymy is in fact significant for Galen\u2019s metaphyics: that is to say, that although the Aristotelian sense of ousia is in principle distinct from the \u201ceveryday\u201d, material one, there may be a tendency in Galen to elide the two usages, to conceive the answer to the question of something\u2019s ousia in physical terms.\nIn either case, different ousiai are items that are definitionally different, different types of thing, not just qualitatively different versions or sub-categories of one thing. A relevant example is that of the three parts of the Platonic tripartite soul. Although typically referred to as different capacities (dunameis), it is more correct to state that they are three different substances (ousiai)\u2014partly because, in fact, each one of them itself has a number of capacities (PHP VI.3, 374\u20135; cf. QAM 2, 377 and 4, 386). And, as we have seen, the notion of a change \u201cin the whole substance\u201d as opposed to a mere change in qualities is an important one in Galen\u2019s physics; this gives an account of one type of thing\u2019s turning into another.\nSo, a substance has capacities. This is important for Galen because it provides him with a way of formulating his natural philosophy in opposition to either Atomism (random motions of bodies which are themselves indistinguishable in their properties) or mechanism, in particular the view attributed to Erasistratus that all processes in the body can be causally reduced to the mechanical principle of horror vacui (pros to kenoumenon akolouthia)\u2014a view attacked at length in Nat. Fac.\nRather, Galen insists, bodies (or substances) in the natural world have distinct capacities; in particular, there are four such capacities shared by all plant and animal bodies, the actions of which account for biological functions such as nutrition in a way which Atomist or mechanist views cannot. These capacities are: attractive, retentive, alterative, expulsive (e.g., Nat. Fac. III.4\u20138; UP IV.7; Temp. III.1, 269\u201370).\nAgain, we may think in terms of emergent properties: how these natural capacities come about is not something that Galen is able to explain in detail, but they are properties of higher-level bodies which are not present in the elements, and must somehow arise in the former through the process of composition from the latter. (These latter also have capacities, but fundamental ones: fire has the capacity of heating, water of moistening, etc.) It is noteworthy that in a passage already cited (Prop. Plac. 9, 84\u20137) the \u201cinternal management\u201d (dioikein) of the parts according to the natural capacities is closely related to this notion of activities or functions belonging to a part of the body \u201cin virtue of its whole substance\u201d.\nGalenic explanations in terms of capacities risk appearing circular; indeed, their post-Galenic descendants were famously mocked as such by Moli\u00e8re. Galen in fact admits openly that the statement that a substance or body \u201chas an f-ic capacity\u201d does not add anything to the statement that that substance or body \u201cis capable of f-ing\u201d (QAM 2, 377), even commenting that \u201cwe use the term \u2018capacity\u2019 when we do not know the substance (ousia!) of the active cause\u201d (Nat. Fac. I.4).\nThe statement that bodies have capacities, then, can be understood simply as the acknowledgement of the existence of tendencies to perform specific activities of functional relevance for the organism. For Galen, of course, this acknowledgement is intimately linked with the assertion of purposive design and the denial that Atomism or mechanism could ever give a satisfactory account of such properties.\nWe can, however, go a little further, and state that there are points, at least, where Galen attempts to give some more concrete account of what a capacity is or how it works. At Praes. Puls. II.9, 305\u20136, he states that \u201cthe substance (ousia) of a capacity is nothing other than a certain mixture\u201d. And we might relate that formulation to the central, if not definitional, role given to mixture in the account of the soul\u2019s capacities (see \u00a77.2).\n",
