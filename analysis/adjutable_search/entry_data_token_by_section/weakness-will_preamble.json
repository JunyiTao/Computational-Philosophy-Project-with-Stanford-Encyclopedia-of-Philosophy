    "main_text": "\n\n(1)\n\nJulie chose b over a, even though she\nknew b was more expensive than a.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing puzzling about Julie\u2019s choice. Perhaps Julie was \nchoosing among vacation options, and b was a week\u2019s vacation\nin Paris, while a was a week\u2019s vacation in Peoria. In any \nevent, Julie evidently took the overall merits of b to \noutweigh those of a, even if b was inferior from a \nfinancial standpoint.\n\n(2)\n\nJimmy opted for d over c, despite his judging\nc to be a healthier choice than d.\n\n\n\nAgain, we find Jimmy\u2019s decision unremarkable. Perhaps c and \nd were competing dessert options: c, let us \nsuppose, was a dish of dry Wheaties, rich in fiber and whole grain, \nwhereas d was a gossamer-light yet oh-so-rich Valrhona \nchocolate mousse. Jimmy obviously (and reasonably!) assessed \nd as the better dessert option all things considered, even \nthough he knew d was less good for his health than \nc would be. Nothing puzzling about that.\n\n(3)\n\nJoseph did f rather than e, even though he was\nconvinced that e was the better thing to do all things\nconsidered.\n\n\n\nHere, by contrast, we have a genuinely puzzling case, one we cannot \nmake sense of in the same way. Why would Joseph do f when he\nassessed e as the superior course of action all things \nconsidered? Joseph\u2019s choice sounds so inexplicable that we might\neven query whether the case has been accurately described. If Joseph \nis really freely choosing f over e, we might think \nit questionable that he does genuinely assess e as better \nall things considered. Perhaps he actually takes f to be \nsuperior (for him, under the circumstances), although he thinks most \npeople would opt for e or would say e was a better \nchoice.\n\n\nOur divergent reactions to these three examples point to something \ndistinctive about the judgment that one course of action is better \nthan another. (Better overall, or better all things \nconsidered, that is\u2014not simply better in some respect.) Such \njudgments appear to enjoy a special connection to the agent\u2019s actions\nwhich other judgments do not possess. We are puzzled by Joseph\u2019s \nchoice precisely because we expect people\u2019s actions\u2014at least \nwhen freely undertaken\u2014to reflect their overall assessment of \nthe merits of the alternative courses of action before them. We \nexpect their actions, in other words, to reflect that special \njudgment. And Joseph\u2019s\u2014at least as reported \nabove\u2014doesn\u2019t. When judgment and action are said to have \ndiverged in this way, we are often sceptical: we question whether the\nagent really held the course of action not taken to be better. And \neven when we accept the description of the case, we find such action \nsomehow puzzling, defective, or dubiously intelligible, in a way that\naction contrary to one\u2019s judgments of financial wisdom (for example) \nis not. We can conclude that the particular judgment contrary to \nwhich Joseph acts\u2014the judgment that one course of action is \nbetter than another\u2014has what we can vaguely term a special \ncharacter, in comparison with other judgments such as that one course\nof action is healthier than another.\n\n\nLet us give a name to the assessment of his options contrary to which\nJoseph acts. Let us call his judgment that e is a better \nthing to do all things considered Joseph\u2019s better judgment. \n(\u201cBetter judgment\u201d does not mean \u201csuperior \njudgment\u201d; it simply means a judgment as to which option is \noverall better.) Joseph, then, appears to have acted, freely and \nintentionally, contrary to his better judgment. And this is precisely\nthe phenomenon the philosophical tradition calls \u201cweakness of \n will.\u201d[1]\n Philosophers have been perplexed by or dubious about such action for \na very long \n time.[2]\n Indeed, Plato\u2019s Socrates famously denied its possibility in the \nProtagoras. \u201cNo one,\u201d he declared, \u201cwho \neither knows or believes that there is another possible course of \naction, better than the one he is following, will ever continue on \nhis present course\u201d (Protagoras 358b\u2013c). And \nphilosophers have been wrestling with the issue ever since. It is not\nsurprising that weakness of will has such a long and distinguished \npedigree as a topic of philosophical discussion: it is both an \nintrinsically interesting phenomenon and a topic rich in implications\nfor our broader theories of action, practical reasoning, rationality,\nevaluative judgment, and the interrelations among these.\n",
