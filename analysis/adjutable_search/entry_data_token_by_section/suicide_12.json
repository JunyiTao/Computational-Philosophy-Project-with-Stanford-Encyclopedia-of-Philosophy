    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Duties Toward the Suicidal\n3.8 Duties Toward the Suicidal\n\nWith the exception of the unqualified libertarian position that each\nperson has a right against others that they not interfere with her\nsuicidal intentions (Szasz 2002) each of the moral positions on\nsuicide we have addressed so far would appear to justify others\nintervening in suicidal plans, at least on some occasions. Little\njustification is necessary for actions that aim to prevent\nanother\u2019s suicide but are non-coercive. Pleading with a suicidal\nindividual, trying to convince her of the value of continued life,\nrecommending counseling, etc. are morally unproblematic, since they do\nnot interfere with the individual\u2019s conduct or plans except by\nengaging her rational capacities (Cosculluela 1994, 35; Cholbi 2002,\n252). The more challenging moral question is whether more coercive\nmeasures such as physical restraint, medication, deception, or\ninstitutionalization are ever justified to prevent suicide and when.\nIn short, the question of suicide intervention is a question of how to\njustify paternalistic interference (Kleinig 1983, 96\u2013104).\n\nAs mentioned in\n section 3.6,\n the impulse toward suicide is often sporadic, ambivalent, and\ninfluenced by mental illnesses such as depression, all indicators that\nsuicide may be undertaken on irrational grounds. And while individuals\nusually have the right to make bad or irrational decisions on their\nown behalf, these indicators, when juxtaposed with the stakes of the\ndecision to end one\u2019s life (that death is irreversible, that\ncontinued life is a condition of all other goods, etc.), justify\nintervention in others\u2019 suicidal plans on the \u2018soft\u2019\npaternalist grounds that suicide is not in the individual\u2019s\ninterests as they would rationally conceive those interests. We might\ncall this the \u2018no regrets\u2019 or \u2018err on the side of\nlife\u2019 approach to suicide intervention (Martin 1980; Pabst\nBattin 1996, 141; Cholbi 2002). Since most situations in which another\nperson intends to kill herself will be ones where we are unsure of\nwhether she is rationally choosing to die, it may well be justifiable\nto temporarily prevent \u201can informed person who is in control of\nhimself from committing suicide\u201d than to do \u201cnothing\nwhile, say, a confused person kills himself, especially since, in all\nlikelihood, the would-be suicide could make another attempt if this\none were prevented and since the suicidal option is irreversible if\nsuccessful\u201d (Cosculluela 1994, 40). Further psychiatric or\nmedical examinations may settle the matter regarding the rationality\nof the suicidal individual\u2019s decision. The coerciveness of the\nmeasures used should be proportional to the apparent seriousness of\nthe suicidal person\u2019s intention to die (Cholbi 2011,\n122\u2013129).\n\nInquiry into the ethics of suicide prevention should also take stock\nof variations in when preventive actions occur and how carefully\ntargeted they are. Some preventive actions, such as the short-term\ninstitutionalization of suicidal persons, are undertaken in clinical\nor criminal justice settings, whereas other preventive actions (such\nas calls to suicide hotlines) occur at greater distance from the\nsuicidal individual. These different settings raise different ethical\nconcerns about individual rights, privacy, and autonomy, as well as\nconcerns trust and honesty. (On ethical questions related to suicide\nhotlines, see Martin 2011.) Still other preventive actions\n(restricting legal access to firearms or household poisons often used\nin suicide, or adding lithium to drinking water supplies to reduce the\nincidence of suicidal emotions) occur at a population level, thus\nraising concerns not only about their efficacy but about the risks\nposed to the non-suicidal individuals\u2019 well-being and rights.\n(Cholbi 2011, 135\u2013138, Ng, Sj\u00f6strand, and Eyal, 2019)\n\nLastly, if there is sometimes a duty to prevent acts of suicide, is it\never morally permissible, or even morally obligatory, to aid others in\nending their lives? (This possibility is directly related to\nphysician-assisted suicide and the larger question of whether the\nright to suicide is a claim right.) If there are circumstances that\njustify our intervening to prevent suicide undertaken irrationally or\ncontrary to a person\u2019s self-interest, then the same\npaternalistic rationale would justify our helping to promote or enable\nthose suicides that are rational and in accordance with a\nperson\u2019s self-interest.\n\nCritics of a duty to assist in suicide assert that the widespread\nmoral acceptance of aiding others in suicide invites the prospect of a\n\u2018slippery slope,\u2019 wherein assisted suicide becomes so\ncommonplace that individuals (particularly members of vulnerable\npopulations such as the aged, the disabled, or socially marginalized\npopulations) for whom suicide is not rational could nevertheless be\nsusceptible to various forms of abuse, manipulation, or undue\npressure, By giving license for others to assist in suicides, critics\nallege, we may unwittingly permit them to encourage suicides not\nbecause those suicides are in fact in the best interests of the\nindividual in question, but because those suicides advance the\ninterests of other people or of institutions.(Pabst Battin 1996,\n145\u2013157). Whether such \u2018slippery slope\u2019 worries are\nwarranted is an empirical matter, and existing studies of societies\nthat have legalized assisted suicide by medical personnel do not\nprovide unequivocal support for these worries (Cholbi 2011,\n148\u2013157).\n3.9 Suicide, Virtue, and Life\u2019s Meaning\n\nSections 3.1\u20133.8 largely address suicide as a question of\ninterpersonal morality, that is, as a question about our duties to one\nanother (though it should be noted that Kant\u2019s opposition to\nsuicide was rooted in his belief that it violates duties we owe to\nourselves rather than duties we owe to others). However, suicide also\nraises what might be termed ethical questions, such as whether suicide\nexemplifies virtue. Bogen (1980) observes that even when we have\nadequately determined that a given act of suicide is morally\npermissible, questions remain about whether that act represents\n\u201cthe best way to live and to end one\u2019s life.\u201d A full\naccount of the ethics of suicide may therefore benefit by\nsupplementing the language of interpersonal obligation and rights with\nthe language of virtues and vices: Under what conditions does an act\nof suicide exhibit a vice such as cowardice, for example? (Benatar\n2021: 220\u2013221) While such questions are germane to whether\nsuicide is defensible all things considered, they are infrequently\naddressed in the philosophical literature (though see van Zyl 2000;\nHardwig 1997 can plausibly be read as claiming that continuing to live\nis sometimes selfish).\n\nSuicide also raises other normative questions that are not obviously\nmoral, such as how suicide may contribute to or detract from the\nmeaningfulness of an individual\u2019s life. For the twentieth\ncentury existentialists, suicide was not a choice to be made mainly by\nappeal to moral considerations but by analyzing whether suicide is an\nappropriate response to the absurdity or meaninglessness of the world\nand of human endeavor. Albert Camus illustrated this absurdity in his\nphilosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus. For Camus, Sisyphus\nheroically does not try to escape his absurd task of endlessly and\nfutilely pushing a rock up a mountain, but instead perseveres and in\nso doing resists the lure of suicide. An appreciation of the absurdity\nof life, Camus contends, should lead us to repudiate rather than\nembrace suicide. For suicide avoids the encounter between human life\nand its absurdity in an indifferent universe. (DeLancey 2021)\n.Jean-Paul Sartre was likewise struck by the possibility of suicide as\nan assertion of authentic human will in the face of absurdity. Suicide\nrepresents, according to Sartre, an opportunity to stake out our\nunderstanding of our essence as individuals in a godless world.\nQuestions of whether a life saturated with pain or suffering can be\nmeaningful have also played a part in recent debates about the\njustification of assisted suicide (Little 1999, Varelius 2013).\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs the foregoing discussion indicates, suicide has been and continues\nto be a rich field of philosophical investigation. Recent advances in\nmedical technology are responsible for the extensive philosophical\nattention paid to one kind of suicide, euthanasia or\nphysician-assisted suicide (PAS), while more\n\u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d suicide motivated by psychological\nanguish is somewhat overlooked. This is somewhat unfortunate:\nEuthanasia and physician-assisted suicide raise issues beyond those\nassociated with other suicides, including the allocation of health\ncare resources, the nature of the medical profession, the\npatient-physician relationship, and the prospect that allowing\nrelatively benign forms of killing such as voluntary euthanasia of PAS\nwill lead down a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to more morally\nworrisome killings. However, many of the same issues and concerns that\nsurround PAS and euthanasia also surround run-of-the mill suicide, and\nmany writers who address the former often disregard the vast\nliterature on the latter. (In addition to the entry on voluntary\neuthanasia, Dworkin et al. 1998, Barry 2007, Pabst Battin\n2003, and Cholbi 2011, 139\u201361, provide overviews of the moral\ndebates surrounding euthanasia and PAS.)\n\nNot only is suicide worthy of philosophical investigation in its own\nright, it is a source of insight for various philosophical\nsubdisciplines: moral psychology, ethical theory, social and political\nphilosophy, the metaphysics of personhood, and action theory. Suicide\nis also an area where philosophical interests intersect with those of\nthe empirical sciences. The collective efforts of philosophers and\nothers continue to illuminate one of the most enigmatic of human\nbehaviors.",
