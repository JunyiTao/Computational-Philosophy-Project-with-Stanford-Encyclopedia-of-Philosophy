    "main_text": "\n\nConservatism and its modernising, anti-traditionalist rivals,\nliberalism and socialism, are the most influential political\nphilosophies and ideologies of the post-Enlightenment era.\nConservatives criticise their rivals for making a utopian exaggeration\nof the power of theoretical reason, and of human perfectibility.\nConservative prescriptions are based on what they regard as experience\nrather than reason; for them, the ideal and the practical are\ninseparable. Most commentators regard conservatism as a modern\npolitical philosophy, even though it exhibits the standpoint of\npaternalism or authority, rather than freedom. As John Gray writes,\nwhile liberalism is the dominant political theory of the modern age,\nconservatism, despite appealing to tradition, is also a response to\nthe challenges of modernity. The roots of all three standpoints\n\u201cmay be traced back to the crises of seventeenth-century\nEngland, but [they] crystallised into definite traditions of thought\nand practice only [after] the French Revolution\u201d (Gray 1995:\n78).\n\nIt is contested both what conservatism is, and what it could or ought\nto be\u2014both among the public and politicians, and among the\nphilosophers and political theorists that this article focuses on.\nPopularly, \u201cconservative\u201d is a generic term for\n\u201cright-wing viewpoint occupying the political spectrum between\nliberalism and fascism\u201d. Philosophical commentators offer a more\ndistinctive characterisation. Many treat it as a standpoint that is\nsceptical of abstract reasoning in politics, and that appeals instead\nto living tradition, allowing for the possibility of limited political\nreform. On this view, conservatism is neither dogmatic reaction, nor\nthe right-wing radicalism of Margaret Thatcher or contemporary\nAmerican \u201cneo-conservatives\u201d. Other commentators, however,\ncontrast this \u201cpragmatic conservatism\u201d with a universalist\n\u201crational conservatism\u201d that is not sceptical of reason,\nand that regards a community with a hierarchy of authority as most\nconducive to human well-being (Skorupski 2015).\n\nCompared to liberalism and socialism, conservatism has suffered\nphilosophical neglect (Broad 1913: 396\u20137). Many deny that it is\nan ideology, or even a political philosophy, regarding it instead as a\ndisposition that resists theoretical expression\u2014a\n\u201cnon-ideology\u201d that attempts to avoid the errors of\nideologies (Graham 1986: 172; in contrast, Nisbet 1986). Is it an\nancient attitude, or one that developed only in response to\nEnlightenment rationality and its political products, liberalism and\nsocialism? How is it related to contemporary\n\u201cneo-conservatism\u201d? Is it a coherent position, or does it,\nas many have argued, fail to distinguish what is worth conserving from\nwhat is not? These are some of the questions commonly raised about\nconservatism, and explored here.\n",
