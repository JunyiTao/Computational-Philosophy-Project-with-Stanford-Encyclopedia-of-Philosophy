    "main_text": "Belief Revision Approaches || G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem\n6.2 G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1986; 1988 sects. 7.4\u20137.7) soon noticed that\ncoupling the Ramsey test with the AGM theory of belief revision leads\nto a trivialization, which is in many respects similar to\nLewis\u2019s trivialization (see\n section 5.2).\n\nTriviality Theorem (G\u00e4rdenfors):A belief\nrevision model satisfies the AGM postulates\n (\\(*\\)4)\n and\n (\\(*\\)5)\n and G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s Ramsey Test only if it is trivial in the\nsense that it does not contain any belief set that is logically\ncompatible with three sentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) that are\npairwise inconsistent with each other.\n\n\nA quick and simple proof goes as follows: Suppose for reductio that we\nhave a BRM \\(M = \\langle \\cK, *\\rangle\\) with a belief set \\(K\\in\n\\cK\\) that is logically compatible with three pairwise inconsistent\nsentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). First notice that \n\n\\[B\\in K+(\\neg A\\wedge B) = (K+(A\\vee B))+\\neg A \\subseteq(K+(A\\vee B))*\\neg A,\\]\n\n\nby (\\(*\\)4), and similarly \\(C\\in (K+(A\\vee C))*\\neg A\\). So by\nGRT, \n\n\\[\\neg A > B \\in K+(A\\vee B)\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\neg A > C \\in K+(A\\vee C).\\]\n\n\nSince \\(A\\) is logically stronger than both \\(A\\vee B\\) and \\(A\\vee\nC\\), we have \n\n\\[K+(A\\vee B)\\subseteq K+A\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[K+(A\\vee C)\\subseteq K+A.\\]\n\n\nBut since \\(A\\) is compatible with \\(K\\), \\(K+A \\subseteq K*A\\), by\n(\\(*\\)4). So both \\(\\neg A > B\\) and \\(\\neg A > C\\) are in\n\\(K*A\\). This implies, by GRT again, that both \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are in\n\\((K*A)*\\neg A\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are inconsistent with each\nother, the latter belief set is inconsistent, contradicting (\\(*\\)5).\nSo the supposition is impossible.\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem was widely perceived as an\nunexpected and somewhat shocking result. Postulate\n (\\(*\\)5)\n can hardly been seen as the culprit, so the triviality theorem was\ninterpreted by G\u00e4rdenfors basically as a conflict between\n (\\(*\\)4)\n or the Preservation Principle on the one hand, and the Ramsey Test on\nthe other. But the reactions to his result were mixed, and no\nconsensus has emerged so far.\n\nA first position, taken by Levi and very much in line with those\ndenying that conditionals have truth values, was that conditionals do\nnot express propositions, but epistemic appraisals, and thus should\nnot be objects of belief and elements of belief sets, but rather\nsentences that can only be accepted. This amounts to rejecting\nGRT.\n\nAnother group of researchers suggested to modify or restrict the\nRamsey test. Solutions of this kind were discussed, amongst others, by\nRott (1986), G\u00e4rdenfors (1987, 1988), Levi (1996: Chapter 2),\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1998) and Nute and Cross (2001).\nArguably, none of these adaptations of the Ramsey test has retained\nthe intuitive appeal of the original idea.\n\nOthers think that the Ramsey test is perfectly all right. Some authors\nargue that the right reaction is to say that conditionals should not\nbe analyzed by AGM-style revisions, but rather by\nupdates in the style of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Members\nof this party include Ryan and Schobbens (1997), Grahne (1998) and\nCrocco and Herzig (2002). Updates in this sense are closely related to\nLewis\u2019s (1976) imaging (see\n section 5.3.2\n above). These operations violate the AGM-postulate (\\(*\\)4) and the\nPrinciple of Preservation, but satisfy the following Monotonicity\ncondition which is immediately entailed by GRT: \n\n\\[\\tag{MON} \\text{If } K_1\\subseteq K_2 \\text{ then } K_1*A \\subseteq K_2*A.\\]\n\n\nRott (2011) defends G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s Ramsey test by showing\nthat it does not create a specific problem for the Preservation\nPrinciple. Its consequence is rather that both preservation of factual\nbeliefs and preservation of flat conditionals entail that there is no\npreservation of right-nested conditionals of depth 2. GRT allows for\nright-nested conditionals if a model for iterated belief revision is\navailable (other compounds of conditionals are more difficult to make\nsense of). It can be shown, for instance, that supposing there is an\natom \\(p\\) on which the believer suspends judgment, the\nconditional \n\n\\[(\\neg A\\vee p)>((\\neg A\\vee \\neg p)>\\neg A)\\]\n\n\nfunctions exactly like the epistemic modal \u201cmight \\(\\neg\nA\\)\u201d: it is believed (or accepted) if and only if \\(A\\) is not\nbelieved. Thus, if our language includes right-nested conditionals,\nthere are no two belief sets \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\) such that \\(K\\) is a\nstrict subset of \\(K'\\). Rott argues that it has simply been a mistake\nto take it for granted that Preservation can and should be transferred\nfrom factual language to languages containing nested conditionals.\n\nDetailed analyses of the dialectics of the situation emerging from\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem can be found in\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1998), Nute and Cross (2001), and\nArl\u00f3-Costa (2007).
