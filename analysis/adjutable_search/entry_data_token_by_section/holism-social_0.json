    "main_text": "The Dispensability Debate\n1. The Dispensability Debate\n\nThe defense of methodological holism dates back to at least the turn\nof the nineteenth century. Around this time, Emile Durkheim advocated\nthe indispensability of holist explanations in a number of writings\n(see e.g., Durkheim 1938[1895], 1951[1897]). He famously stated that\nthe\n\n\ndetermining cause of a social fact should be sought among the\nsocial facts preceding it and not among the states of the individual\nconsciousness. (Durkheim 1938 [1895]: 110\u2014italics in the\noriginal)\n\n\nHis work is typically juxtaposed to that of Max Weber, who is regarded\nas the main proponent of methodological individualism during this\nperiod. In the subsequent history of the debate, there are two phases\nthat particularly stand out. The first began around the 1950s, when\nFriedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, and J.W.N. Watkins argued ardently in\nsupport of methodological individualism. In response, Ernest Gellner,\nLeon G. Goldstein, Maurice Mandelbaum, and others maintained that\nthere were alternative ways of cashing out, and defending,\nmethodological holism that were left unscathed by Hayek\u2019s,\nPopper\u2019s and Watkins\u2019 objections (see Gellner 1973 [1956];\nGoldstein 1973a [1956], 1973b [1958]; Mandelbaum 1955, 1973 [1957].\nThey all appear in O\u2019Neill 1973, which also contains other\nimportant contributions from this period).\n\nThe second significant period stretches from around the 1980s up until\ntoday. From the perspective of methodological holism, this phase is\nmarked by the appearance of a number of new, or new versions of,\narguments in support of the indispensability of holist explanations.\nIn this phase, seminal contributions to the dispensability debate were\nmade by Roy Bhaskar, Alan Garfinkel, Harold Kincaid, Frank Jackson and\nPhilip Pettit to mention just a few (see Bhaskar 1979; Garfinkel 1981;\nKincaid 1996, 1997; Jackson and Pettit 1992a, 1992b). The following\nsection focuses on the most important arguments advanced during this\nlast\u2014and still unfolding\u2014period. (See Zahle and Collin\n2014a for a collection of papers from this period.) The remainder of\nthe present section is concerned with the further introduction of the\npositions at play within the dispensability debate. As noted above,\nspecial attention will be paid to the methodological holist\nstance.\n\nThere are three basic views within the debate:\n\n\nStrong methodological holism: Holist explanations alone\nshould be offered within the social sciences; they are indispensable.\nIndividualist explanations may, and should, be dispensed with.\n\nModerate methodological holism: In certain cases, holist\nexplanations should be advanced; in other cases individualist\nexplanations should be advanced; both holist and individualist\nexplanations are indispensable within the social sciences.\n\nMethodological individualism: Individualist explanations\nalone should be put forward within the social sciences; they are\nindispensable. Holist explanations may, and should, be dispensed\nwith.\n\n\nAmong these positions, the thesis of strong methodological holism has\nenjoyed relatively little support and today it has few, if any,\nproponents. The vast majority of methodological holists are of the\nmoderate variety. Accordingly, the debate has mainly played itself out\nbetween the moderate holist view and the individualist position.\nBecause both parties agree that individualist explanations should be\nadvanced, their efforts have first and foremost been directed toward\nthe question of whether holist explanations are indispensable or\nnot.\n\nThe three basic positions may be further characterized in three ways.\nFirst, each relies on a distinction between holist and individualist\nexplanations. This raises the issue of exactly how to differentiate\nbetween these two categories of explanation. The answer to this\nquestion is a matter of dispute among participants in the debate. One\npossible formulation of the distinction is that holist explanations\nappeal to social phenomena, whereas individualist explanations invoke\nindividuals, their actions, beliefs, etc. To elaborate further on this\nsuggestion, it may be specified that holist explanations contain\nsocial terms, descriptions, or predicates set apart by their reference\nto, and focus on, social phenomena. By contrast, individualist\nexplanations contain individualist terms, descriptions, or predicates\ndistinguished by their reference to, and focus on, individuals, their\nactions, beliefs, desires, etc.\n\nOne issue still left open by this supplementary characterization is\nhow to understand the notion of a social phenomenon. Methodological\nholists commonly take the following list of items to exemplify social\nphenomena: (a) Organizations\u2014like universities, firms, and\nchurches; (b) social processes\u2014like revolutions and economic\ngrowth; (c) statistical properties\u2014like the literacy rate or the\nsuicide rate within a group; (d) cultures and traditions\u2014like\nthe Mayan culture or a democratic tradition; (e) beliefs, desires, and\nother mental properties ascribed to groups\u2014like the\ngovernment\u2019s desire to stay in power; (f) norms and\nrules\u2014like the proscription of sex with family members and the\nrule requiring cars to drive on the right-hand side of the road; (g)\nproperties of social networks\u2014like their density or cohesion;\n(h) social structures, typically identified with one or more of the\nitems already listed; and (i) social roles\u2014like being a bus\ndriver or a nurse. The list includes social phenomena in the form of\nsocial entities, social processes, and social properties. The latter\nare first and foremost properties ascribed to social groups or\nconstellations of individuals. Yet social properties also include\ncertain features ascribed to individuals, such as an\nindividual\u2019s social role. These properties are social\nproperties, it is sometimes suggested, because they presuppose the\nsocial organization of individuals, or the existence of social\nentities. (For a discussion of different kinds of social properties,\nsee also Ylikoski 2012, 2014.)\n\nMethodological individualists typically disagree that all the items\nlisted above constitute social phenomena. They contend that some\nexemplify individualist properties because they are properties of\nindividuals. For instance, some methodological individualists maintain\nthat norms and rules are individualist properties since they express\nindividuals\u2019 beliefs as to how they should\u2014or should\nnot\u2014act. Likewise, many hold that social roles are individualist\nproperties because they are ascribed to individuals. (For holist\ndefenses of the view that social roles should be classified as social\nproperties, see e.g., Kincaid 1997; Lukes 1968; Elder-Vass 2010;\nHodgson 2007.) In this fashion, the dispute about how to distinguish\nbetween holist and individualist explanations translates into a\ndifference in opinion concerning what constitutes social phenomena.\nMethodological holists consider more phenomena to be social and hence\nthey classify more explanations as holist, whereas methodological\nindividualists view fewer phenomena as social, the result being that\nthey categorize fewer explanations as holist and more as\nindividualist. Due to such disagreements, methodological holists and\nindividualists often talk past one another: each offers arguments\npresupposing a distinction between holist and individualist\nexplanations that is at odds with that relied upon by their opponent\n(see Zahle 2003, 2014).\n\nThe question of how to differentiate between holist and individualist\nexplanations may also be approached by drawing on the analysis of\nexplanations as consisting of an explanans, i.e., what does the\nexplaining, and an explanandum, i.e., what is in need of explanation.\nConsider the following options: (a) both the explanans and the\nexplanandum are expressed in terms of social phenomena (e.g., the\ngovernment\u2019s decision to lower the national minimum wage led to\nprotests from the unions); (b) the explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena while the explanandum is described in terms of\nindividuals, their actions, etc. (e.g., the government\u2019s\ndecision to lower the national minimum wage resulted in several\nindividuals writing public letters of protest); (c) both the explanans\nand the explanandum are expressed in terms of individuals, their\nactions, etc. (e.g., because the small children started crying, a\nnumber of people came over to help out); (d) the explanans is stated\nin terms of individuals, their actions, etc. while the explanandum is\ndescribed in terms of social phenomena (e.g., the fact that many\nindividuals withdrew their money at once had the result that the bank\nexhausted its cash reserves). With these options in mind, three\ndifferent ways of circumscribing holist and individualist explanations\nmay be registered:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is expressed either in terms of\nsocial phenomena, or in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals; the explanandum is expressed either in terms of\nsocial phenomena, or in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n \n(2)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is described in terms of social\nphenomena.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals, their actions, etc.; the explanandum is\ndescribed in terms of social phenomena.\n \n(3)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is expressed in terms of social\nphenomena.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals, their actions, etc.; the explanandum is\nexpressed in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n \n\n\nAll three conceptions have been advocated in the dispensability\ndebate. Among them, the first position is the most inclusive, while\nalso being the most widespread.\n\nSecond, the basic positions of strong methodological holism, moderate\nmethodological holism and methodological individualism can be further\ncharacterized by noting that holist and individualist explanations may\nbe categorized into different types. For instance, both holist and\nindividualist explanations may be classified according to whether they\nare functional, intentional, or straightforward causal explanations.\nThis point may be illustrated in relation to holist explanations.\nHolist explanations of the functional variety state that the continued\nexistence of a social phenomenon is explained by its function or\neffect. For instance, it may be suggested that \u201cthe state\ncontinues to exist because it furthers the interests of the ruling\nclass\u201d. In the past, but no longer today, methodological holism\nhas often been associated with the advancement of holist explanations\nof this type. (On the use of functional holist explanations, see e.g.,\nMacdonald and Pettit 1981: 131ff.) Intentional holist explanations\npurport to explain an action ascribed to a group by reference to the\ngroup\u2019s reasons for performing it. For example, it may be\naffirmed that \u201cthe government decided to call a general election\nin May because it believed this would increase its chances of being\nreelected\u201d. (On the use of intentional holist explanations, see\ne.g., Tollefsen 2002; List and Pettit 2011.) Nowadays, both functional\nand intentional explanations are often regarded as special kinds of\ncausal explanation to be distinguished from more straightforward\ncausal explanations. This latter kind of causal explanation is\nillustrated by assertions such as \u201cthe rise in unemployment led\nto an increase in crime\u201d, or \u201cthe government\u2019s\nlowering of the taxes led to an increase in the consumption of luxury\ngoods\u201d.\n\nAlternatively, to note an additional example, holist and individualist\nexplanations may be categorized by reference to their focus. In this\nspirit, holist explanations may be classified according to whether\nthey focus on, say, the statistical properties of social groups, on\nsocial organizations and their actions, and so on. Likewise,\nindividualist explanations may be categorized according to whether,\nsay, their descriptions of individuals are informed by rational choice\nmodels, by accounts that stress how actions are largely habitual and\nbased on various forms of tacit knowledge, etc. The advocacy of a\nbasic position may go together with the favoring of certain types of\nholist or individualist explanations over others.\n\nThird, the positions of strong methodological holism, moderate\nmethodological holism and methodological individualism can be further\nexplicated by observing that each stance may either be formulated as a\nclaim about explanations in general, that is, all explanations\nadvanced within the social sciences, or as pertaining to final\nexplanations only, that is, explanations that are satisfactory rather\nthan being merely tolerable in the absence of better ones. Sometimes\nmethodological individualists tend to regard the discussion as\nrevolving solely around final explanations. Accordingly, they maintain\nthat though holist explanations may be advanced, they are only\ntolerable as stopping points that are temporarily acceptable in\nanticipation of individualist explanations that, alone, will qualify\nas final explanations. Among both strong and moderate methodological\nholists, it is less commonly maintained that the debate concerns final\nexplanations only.\n\nThere are additional dimensions along which the three basic positions\nwithin the dispensability debate may be clarified. For instance, each\nstance is compatible with different views of what constitutes an\nexplanation, different notions of causation, and so on. Occasionally,\nthe divergence of opinion with respect to these issues will surface in\nthe discussion that follows.\n",
