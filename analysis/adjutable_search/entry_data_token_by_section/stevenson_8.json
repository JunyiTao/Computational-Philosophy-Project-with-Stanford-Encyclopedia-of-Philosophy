    "main_text": "Ethics, Language, and Methods\n4. Ethics, Language, and Methods\n\nEthical language should be suitable for the purposes of ethics. Since,\nfor Stevenson, the purposes of ethics are to settle, coordinate, or\notherwise resolve disagreements in attitude (and ethical uncertainty),\nan analysis of ethical language must display how ethical language is\napt for performing these functions. It is apt, according to Stevenson,\nbecause ethical language (i) almost always has both emotive and\ndescriptive meaning, where (ii) emotive meaning is essential and (iii)\noften strongly independent of descriptive meaning (in the sense in\nwhich \u201cthin\u201d ethical terms, such as \u2018good\u2019,\nmight be said to have emotive meaning that is strongly independent of\nany descriptive meaning it might have). That ethical language has\nessential emotive meaning\u2014that is, has dispositions in which\nattitudes play a most prominent role\u2014implies as it should that\nattitudes and feelings are at issue in cases of moral disagreement or\nuncertainty. That ethical language usually has both emotive and\ndescriptive meanings which often interact in various ways suggests as\nit should that beliefs, and therefore rational methods, can be\nrelevant to resolving moral disagreement or uncertainty. That emotive\nmeaning is often strongly independent of descriptive meaning suggests\nas it should that nonrational \u201cpersuasive\u201d methods can\nalso play a role in settling or resolving moral disagreement or\nuncertainty.\n",
