What Sort of Thing Can Have Intrinsic Value?\n\nAmong those who do not doubt the coherence of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue there is considerable difference of opinion about what sort or\nsorts of entity can have such value. Moore does not explicitly address\nthis issue, but his writings show him to have a liberal view on the\nmatter. There are times when he talks of individual objects (e.g.,\nbooks) as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of the\nconsciousness of individual objects (or of their qualities) as having\nintrinsic value, others when he talks of the existence of individual\nobjects as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of types of\nindividual objects as having intrinsic value, and still others when he\ntalks of states of individual objects as having intrinsic value.\n\nMoore would thus appear to be a \u201cpluralist\u201d concerning the\nbearers of intrinsic value. Others take a more conservative,\n\u201cmonistic\u201d approach, according to which there is just one\nkind of bearer of intrinsic value. Consider, for example,\nFrankena\u2019s long list of intrinsic goods, presented in Section 1\nabove: life, consciousness, etc. To what kind(s) of entity do\nsuch terms refer? Various answers have been given. Some (such as\nPanayot Butchvarov) claim that it is properties that are the\nbearers of intrinsic value (Butchvarov 1989, pp. 14\u201315). On this\nview, Frankena\u2019s list implies that it is the properties of being\nalive, being conscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Others\n(such as Chisholm) claim that it is states of affairs that\nare the bearers of intrinsic value (Chisholm 1968\u201369, 1972,\n1975). On this view, Frankena\u2019s list implies that it is the\nstates of affairs of someone (or something) being alive, someone being\nconscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Still others (such\nas Ross) claim that it is facts that are the bearers of\nintrinsic value (Ross 1930, pp. 112\u201313; cf. Lemos 1994, ch. 2).\nOn this view, Frankena\u2019s list implies that it is the facts that\nsomeone (or something) is alive, that someone is conscious, and so on,\nthat are intrinsically good. (The difference between Chisholm\u2019s\nand Ross\u2019s views would seem to be this: whereas Chisholm would\nascribe intrinsic value even to states of affairs, such as that of\neveryone being happy, that do not obtain, Ross would ascribe such\nvalue only to states of affairs that do obtain.)\n\nOntologists often divide entities into two fundamental classes, those\nthat are abstract and those that are concrete. Unfortunately, there is\nno consensus on just how this distinction is to be drawn. Most\nphilosophers would classify the sorts of entities just mentioned\n(properties, states of affairs, and facts) as abstract. So understood,\nthe claim that intrinsic value is borne by such entities is to be\ndistinguished from the claim that it is borne by certain other closely\nrelated entities that are often classified as concrete. For example,\nit has recently been suggested that it is tropes that have intrinsic\n value.[7]\n Tropes are supposed to be a sort of particularized property, a kind\nof property-instance (rather than simply a property). (Thus the\nparticular whiteness of a particular piece of paper is to be\ndistinguished, on this view, from the property of whiteness.) It has\nalso been suggested that it is states, understood as a kind of\ninstance of states of affairs, that have intrinsic value (cf.\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3).\n\nThose who make monistic proposals of the sort just mentioned are aware\nthat intrinsic value is sometimes ascribed to kinds of entities\ndifferent from those favored by their proposals. They claim that all\nsuch ascriptions can be reduced to, or translated into, ascriptions of\nintrinsic value of the sort they deem proper. Consider, for example,\nKorsgaard\u2019s suggestion that a gorgeously enameled frying pan is\ngood for its own sake. Ross would say that this cannot be the case. If\nthere is any intrinsic value to be found here, it will, according to\nRoss, not reside in the pan itself but in the fact that it plays a\ncertain role in our lives, or perhaps in the fact that something plays\nthis role, or in the fact that something that plays this role exists.\n(Others would make other translations in the terms that they deem\nappropriate.) On the basis of this ascription of intrinsic value to\nsome fact, Ross could go on to ascribe a kind of extrinsic\nvalue to the pan itself, in virtue of its relation to the fact in\nquestion.\n\nWhether reduction of this sort is acceptable has been a matter of\nconsiderable debate. Proponents of monism maintain that it introduces\nsome much-needed order into the discussion of intrinsic value,\nclarifying just what is involved in the ascription of such value and\nsimplifying the computation of such value\u2014on which point, see\nthe next section. (A corollary of some monistic approaches is that the\nvalue that something has for its own sake supervenes on the intrinsic\nproperties of that thing, so that there is a perfect convergence of\nthe two sorts of values that Korsgaard calls \u201cfinal\u201d and\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d. On this point, see the last section;\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3; Tucker 2016; and Tucker (forthcoming).)\nOpponents argue that reduction results in distortion and\noversimplification; they maintain that, even if there is intrinsic\nvalue to be found in such a fact as that a gorgeously enameled frying\npan plays a certain role in our lives, there may yet be\nintrinsic, and not merely extrinsic, value to be found in the\npan itself and perhaps also in its existence (cf. Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Some propose a compromise\naccording to which the kind of intrinsic value that can sensibly be\nascribed to individual objects like frying pans is not the same kind\nof intrinsic value that is the topic of this article and can sensibly\nbe ascribed to items of the sort on Frankena\u2019s list (cf. Bradley\n2006). (See again the cautionary note in the final paragraph of\nSection 2 above.)\n",
