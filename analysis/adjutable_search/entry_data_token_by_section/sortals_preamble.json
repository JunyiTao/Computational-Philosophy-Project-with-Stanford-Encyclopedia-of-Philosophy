    "main_text": "\n\nThe world seems to consist of stuff and things. Some of the stuff\ncomposes things\u2014that wood constitutes this ship. Some things\nendure for a long time\u2014the 2nd century Pantheon\nbuilding in Rome\u2014others are transient\u2014a sandcastle on the\nbeach. People care, to varying degrees, what kind of thing is being\nconsidered, and whether the one they are discussing is the same one.\nThe Pantheon in Rome today is the same one that was there in AD 150;\nthe sandcastle on the beach today, though it is in the same location\nand looks the same, is not the one the tide washed away last night.\nWhy do we care about objects and not just the stuff? Because objects\nare stuff with extra properties, properties that often persist and are\noften useful to know about even if the stuff changes.\n\nPhilosophical realists view the emergence of objects from the stuff as\nan objective matter independent of human thought or interests; conceptualist \nphilosophers argue instead that it is human cognition (and nominalist that it is language as well) that produces the appearance of objects. Many philosophers have believed\nthat the notion of a sortal is a, perhaps the, crucial philosophical\ntool in analyzing these issues and resolving the debates. Recently\npsychologists have also taken notice of the concept and argued for the\nimportance of sortals in cognitive development. And researchers in\nartificial intelligence, specifically knowledge representation, have\nalso started to use the idea. Unfortunately, there are conflicting\nunderstandings of the technical philosophical term sortal; authors\noften write at cross-purposes, which means that readers of any text\nabout sortals should approach cautiously. \n\nThe three main ideas are that a sortal\n\n tells us what the essence of a thing is \n tells us how to count things of that kind, which requires knowing\nwhich things are different and which are the same\n tells us when something continues to exist, and when it goes out\nof existence\n\n\nJohn Locke, who coined the term in 1690, was primarily concerned with\n(1), Peter Strawson, who in 1959 was the next to use the term, was\nprimarily concerned with (3). Two historically intermediate\nphilosophers who did not use the term but were interested in the\nconcept, Spinoza and Frege, were primarily interested in (2).\n\nWhat are some examples of sortals? The most generally agreed upon\nfeature of sortals is that they provide a criterion for what is to be\ncounted. All of the sortals listed next are counting sortals. Among\nthe counting sortals, some are phase sortals\u2014sortals that\ntypically apply to something during part of its existence. An example\nis colt\u2014the horse does not go out of existence when it\nmatures and ceases to be a colt. Another category is restricted\nsortals, which also may cease to be true of the object without its\ngoing out of existence, for example a brown dog may turn\ngray. Philosophers debate about sortals and essences; we would\ndistinguish between basic level sortals, the kind of noun or phrase\nthat is most typically given as an answer to What is it? Questions.\nGood examples of answers to the question understood this way would be\nelephant or car. This form of sortal has strong\naffinities in some domains with what are called natural kinds, but\nmany sortals apply to artifacts and not to natural objects. Another\nlevel of What is it? answer is at a very general categorial level,\nwhere some of the typical answers would be animal\nor vehicle. \n\nMost nouns that are not sortals can form sortals in contexts where a\nunit is implicated, often without the supplementary unit being\nexplicit. Coffee and gold are not sortals by most accounts, but we can\nintelligibly ask how many coffees Harry drank or how many golds the\nski team won. It is understood from context that we are asking about\ncups of coffee and gold medals.  These unitized\nsortals can be in any of the forms discussed above.\n\nOne of the most central kinds of sortal, and one of the most difficult\nto give uncontroversial examples of, are the persistence sortals. A\npersistence sortal is one where, if the sortal is no longer true of\nthe object, the object no longer exists. If a car is crushed into a\nmetal cube, the car no longer exists. But if the car is transformed\ninto a boat, does some one thing exist first as a car and then as a\nboat? According to some views, when someone dies they cease to exist;\naccording to various other views, the same person may be reincarnated\nin a new form. Is a werewolf sometimes a person and sometimes a wolf,\nor are they always a werewolf and neither a person nor wolf. \n",
