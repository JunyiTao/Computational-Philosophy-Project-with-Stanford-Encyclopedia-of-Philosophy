    "main_text": "Drift as Models, Drift as a Law\n5. Drift as Models, Drift as a Law\n\nAs noted above, the phenomenon of drift is represented in mathematical\nmodels of population genetics. The standard mathematical model of\ndrift found in textbooks is the Wright-Fisher model, the core of which\nis the binomial distribution, and it is the model that philosophers of\nbiology typically appeal to. In the Wright-Fisher model\u2014an\nidealized model, as all models are\u2014there are assumed to be\n\\(N\\) diploid adults in a population, mating randomly, with an\nallele \\(A\\) that has a frequency of \\(p_0\\) and an alternate\nallele at the same locus. The model further assumes that adults\nproduce an infinite number of gametes having the same allele\nfrequency. \\(2N\\) gametes are drawn from the \u201cgamete pool\u201d\nat random to constitute the \\(N\\) diploid individuals of the next\ngeneration. (See Ishida and Rosales 2020 for important clarifications\non the historical development of the Wright-Fisher model).\n\nHowever, as Millstein, Skipper, and Dietrich (2009) point out, the\nWright-Fisher model is quite idealized, since, of course,\n\n\npopulations do not reproduce by calling in their local statistician\nand asking her to pick exactly \\(2N\\) gametes at random (with\nreplacement) and toss them into the next generation (Gillespie 2004:\n49)\n\n\n\u2014but there are more realistic alternatives. John\nGillespie\u2019s model, for example, similarly assumes a diploid\npopulation of \\(N\\) members and a two-allele locus, with\nfrequencies \\(p\\) and \\(q = (1 - p)\\); it also similarly assumes\nrandom mating. Where it differs from the Wright-Fisher model is that\neach of the \\(2Np A\\) gametes constitutes the next generation with a\nrandom number of offspring gametes. There is no restriction\non the distribution of the numbers of offspring nor on the total\nnumber of offspring gametes. Thus, unlike the Wright-Fisher model,\nGillespie\u2019s model is not tied to binomial sampling,\nalthough sampling more generally is still being modeled. Millstein,\nSkipper, and Dietrich suggest that the philosophical significance of\nsuch alternative models (including others such as the Moran model, the\nCannings model, or the coalescent) is that we need to be careful about\ndrawing conclusions about drift from any one particular mathematical\nmodel, always keeping in mind Giere\u2019s (1988) point that models\nare built as representations of specific aspects of physical\nsystems.\n\nClatterbuck (2015) similarly reminds the philosophical community that\nit is a mistake to just focus on the Wright-Fisher model, highlighting\nthe Eldon\u2013Wakeley model in particular. She emphasizes that\ndifferent drift models are not predictively equivalent, so that\ndetails of the causal network (represented by the differing\nassumptions of the different models) underlying a population can be\nseen to change the outcomes of drift. This challenges\nstatisticalists\u2019 assumptions that drift is purely mathematical.\nRelatedly, she argues that broadening our conception of drift to\ninclude alternative models reveals novel ways of intervening on drift\nthat strengthen the causal argument against its statisticalism. For\nexample, by intervening\n\n\non the population in such a way as to increase the probability that\nindividuals have a far greater number of offspring (relative to the\npopulation size) than allowed by the Wright\u2013Fisher model\n\n\nwe would increase the probability of a neutral allele increasing in\nfrequency (2015: 3501). This is an improvement over Reisman and\nForber\u2019s manipulationist arguments (discussed above), since it\nis more clearly the drift (the sampling process) that is being\nmanipulated rather than just population size.\n\nBut perhaps drift is more than just a model (or a set of models);\nperhaps it is a scientific law of evolutionary biology. Or so Brandon\n(2006) argues, dubbing a \u201cPrinciple of Drift\u201d analogous to\nthe Principle of Inertia in that both are intended to be\n\u201czero-force\u201d laws. According to the Principle of\nDrift,\n\n\u201cA population at equilibrium will tend to drift from that\nequilibrium unless acted on by an evolutionary force\u201d\n\n\nand\n\n\u201cA population on evolutionary trajectory t, caused by\nsome net evolutionary force F, will tend to depart from the\nextrapolated path predicted based on F alone (in either\ndirection or magnitude or both) even if no other evolutionary force\nintervenes, unless F continues to act\u201d (Brandon 2006:\n328).\n\n\nOn this view, drift\u2014and thus change\u2014is the default state\nof evolutionary systems, challenging Sober\u2019s view (discussed\npreviously), that the Hardy-Weinberg Principle characterizes the\nzero-force state in evolutionary biology. In defending the Principle\nof Drift, Brandon challenges those who would argue that there are no\nlaws of biology (e.g., Beatty 1995; see cites within), although\nBrandon (1990) had already done so by defending a Principle of\nSelection (see also the related work by McShea and Brandon 2010, in\nwhich drift is characterized as a special case of what they dub the\n\u201cZero-Force Evolutionary Law\u201d, or ZFEL).\n",
