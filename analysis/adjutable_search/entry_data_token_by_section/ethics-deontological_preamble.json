    "main_text": "\n\nThe word deontology derives from the Greek words for duty\n(deon) and science (or study) of (logos). In\ncontemporary moral philosophy, deontology is one of those kinds of\nnormative theories regarding which choices are morally required,\nforbidden, or permitted. In other words, deontology falls within the\ndomain of moral theories that guide and assess our choices of what we\nought to do (deontic theories), in contrast to those that guide and\nassess what kind of person we are and should be (aretaic [virtue]\ntheories). And within the domain of moral theories that assess our\nchoices, deontologists\u2014those who subscribe to deontological\ntheories of morality\u2014stand in opposition to\nconsequentialists.\n",
