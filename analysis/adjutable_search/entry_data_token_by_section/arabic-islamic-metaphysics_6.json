    "main_text": "Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna)\n7. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna)\n\nOutlines of metaphysics, of various lengths, can be found in\nAvicenna\u2019s treatises on the classifications of the sciences, as\nwell as in the surveys of the different branches of philosophy\ninterspersed in many of his other works. These epistemological\nsketches are substantiated in his summae, a literary genre of\nwhich he can be considered the inventor. In all these\n\u201cencyclopedias\u201d of philosophy\u2014addressed to different\naudiences and displaying various formats, methodologies and\nstyles\u2014metaphysics constitutes, together with logic and natural\nphilosophy, a permanent and pivotal part of philosophy. In those\nwritten in Arabic, after the propaedeutic treatment of logic, the\nsequence of theoretical disciplines is given\u2014along traditional\nlines\u2014as natural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics, or\nsimply as natural philosophy and metaphysics, with mathematics\nfrequently omitted. By contrast, in the Persian summa, Philosophy\nfor \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be al-Dawla\n(D\u0101ni\u0161n\u0101mah-yi \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b),\nand possibly also in the incompletely extant Eastern\nPhilosophy (Al-\u1e24ikma al-ma\u0161riqiyya), the\norder is reversed and, as Avicenna himself avows, much more original:\nmetaphysics constitutes the beginning, rather than the end, of\ntheoretical philosophy. These two opposite arrangements are in fact\ncompatible and underscore complementary aspects of the primacy of\nmetaphysics within theoretical philosophy: metaphysics is last in the\norder of learning as the pinnacle of philosophical instruction, while\nit is first in the order of reality on account of the supreme rank of\nthe things it deals with.\n\nIn Avicenna\u2019s literal commentaries on the philosophical\ncorpus, most of which are lost, metaphysics represents the\nsection about which we are best informed by either Avicenna himself or\nhis disciples (e.g., The Available and the Valid,\nAl-\u1e24\u0101\u1e63il wa-l-ma\u1e25\u1e63\u016bl), or by\nthe surviving portions (e.g., Book of the Fair Judgment,\nKit\u0101b al-In\u1e63\u0101f). Judging from the extant\nfragments, conciseness and selectiveness appear to have been the\nstylistic and methodological hallmarks of Avicenna\u2019s exegesis of\nthe Metaphysics.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s original adaptation of the Metaphysics can\nbe best appreciated in the metaphysical sections of his\nsummae of philosophy, which combine the taxonomical and\nexegetical approaches to Aristotle\u2019s work (see\n section 1),\n with the main intent of updating and upgrading Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysical model. On the one hand, in so far as they are collections\nof the different branches of philosophy, and expound metaphysics\ntogether with logic, natural philosophy, and mathematics, these works\ngive metaphysics a precise position in the system of the philosophical\ndisciplines. On the other hand, they provide an explanation of\nAristotle\u2019s text by incorporating it into Avicenna\u2019s own\ndiscourse by means of a report which modifies the formulation of the\noriginal text and changes the arrangement of its parts. More\nimportantly, they adapt the scientific profile and the specific\ncontent of the Metaphysics to new epistemological\nrequirements, to the doctrinal progress of post-Aristotelian\nphilosophy, and to the Islamic setting with which metaphysics is now\ncalled to interact. Specifically, they adjust the tentative scientific\nconfiguration assigned to Metaphysics by Aristotle himself to\nhigher epistemological standards; they refine the doctrine of the\nMetaphysics and mold it with theories taken from other\nauthors and works within the Aristotelian tradition, or from the\nfruits of Avicenna\u2019s own mind; and they make the final treatment\nof philosophical theology in metaphysics compliant with religious\nconcerns and the theological agenda of the Islamic milieu in which\nAvicenna\u2019s summae are produced.\n\nAmong Avicenna\u2019s summae, the most extensive,\ninfluential, and, by the author\u2019s own admission, the most\ndependent upon Aristotelian sources is the Book of the\nCure/Healing (Kit\u0101b al-\u0160if\u0101\u02be). The\n\u201ctraditional\u201d character of the work, however, far from\npreventing originality, allows the reader to observe more keenly the\nauthor\u2019s subtle and wide-ranging adaptation of the Aristotelian\nmodel and his free disposal of the received material. This applies to\nmetaphysics in an eminent way. The metaphysical section of the\nCure/Healing, The Science of Divine Things\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t), comes at the end of a massive work\nconsisting in a collection of twenty-two volumes, which is unique\namong Avicenna\u2019s summae not only with regard to length\n(more than 5000 pages in the current printing of the Arabic text, one\nof the longest works ever written in the history of philosophy) but\nalso because it is the only summa that contains both a\nfull-fledged mathematics before metaphysics, and an extensive\ntreatment of practical philosophy as an appendix to metaphysics. In\nthis way, only in The Science of Divine Things, metaphysics\nfigures as a real cornerstone of the entire philosophical curriculum,\nboth with respect to what precedes (logic and the other two parts of\ntheoretical philosophy), and with respect to what follows (practical\nphilosophy).\n\nAs to the text of the Metaphysics, Avicenna uses several\nArabic translations of Aristotle\u2019s work, and adopts various\ntechniques for quoting it: his way of referring to the\nMetaphysics is usually very selective in content and free in\nstyle, although in a few cases his quotations become continuous and\nresemble a real paraphrase. This latter case happens with\nMetaphysics \u03b1, 2, which Avicenna cites in its entirety,\nwith explicative expansions, in the eighth treatise, introducing into\nthe paraphrase frequent references to the Metaphysics\n(\u201cFirst Teaching\u201d) and its author (\u201cFirst\nTeacher\u201d), as well as an explicit mention of book Alpha Elatton\nitself, and defending the doctrines at stake by offering solutions to\na series of possible objections. Within the ninth treatise, the same\nspecial treatment is given, to a lesser degree, to Metaph.\n\u039b, 6\u201310.\n\nThe liberty with which Avicenna reports the text of the\nMetaphysics is paramount to his effort of adapting it to a\nnew context. With respect to Aristoteles\u2019 work, The Science\nof Divine Things exhibits three radical aspects of modification.\nAvicenna changes, first of all, the \u201cform\u201d, i.e., the\nscientific profile, of Aristotle\u2019s work. Accordingly, he also\nmodifies its \u201ccontent\u201d, namely the disposition and\ndoctrinal purport of the individual treatises of the work. These two\nmodifications are concomitant with a third, more general, change,\nregarding the position and role of the science of metaphysics in the\nsystem of the sciences. The change regarding the \u201cform\u201d\naffects all the fundamental aspects of a science singled out by\nAristotle in the Posterior Analytics: the theme of\nmetaphysics, its structure, and its method. The content of the\nMetaphysics, on the other hand, is reworked by means of a\ndifferent arrangement of its parts, the integration of\nAristotle\u2019s thought with subsequent metaphysical speculation,\nboth Greek and Arabic, the introduction of some original key\ndoctrines, and a treatment of the divine realm very attentive to the\nconcerns of Islamic religion and theology. The change regarding the\nsystemic function of metaphysics, finally, involves a precise view of\nits relationship with the other sciences as both foundational and\ncrowning discipline, thus overcoming Aristotle\u2019s veto in the\nPosterior Analytics on the subalternation under a single\nscience of all other disciplines. Cumulatively, in these three ways\none observes on Avicenna\u2019s part a thorough and radical revision\nof the authoritative text on metaphysics, which can be rightly\nregarded as a sort of second \u201cedition\u201d of the\nMetaphysics, or second \u201cbeginning\u201d of the Western\nmetaphysical speculation.\n\nIn the context of the epistemological reshaping of the metaphysics,\nAvicenna shows first that the subject-matter of this science conforms\nto all the different characteristics that Aristotle assigns to it in\nthe Metaphysics. Thus, metaphysics is a study of the First\nCauses and God (cf. Metaph. \u0391, 1, 981b28\u201329;\n\u0391, 2, 982b9\u201310), since the First Causes and God are its\n\u201cgoal\u201d. But it is also a study of \u201cthe\nexistent\u201d (cf. Metaph. \u0393, 1, 1003a20\u201326),\nsince \u201cthe existent qua existent\u201d is its\nsubject-matter. Finally, metaphysics is a study of immaterial and\nunmoved things (cf. Metaph. \u0395, 1, 1026a13\u201323),\nsince both the First Causes and God, and \u201cthe existent\nqua existent\u201d are realities of this kind. This\nharmonization of Aristotle\u2019s different points of view is\nundertaken with the intent of conforming metaphysics to the\nepistemological canons of the Posterior Analytics, which\nposit the subject-matter as the fundamental element of every science.\nAvicenna is the first thinker in the history of philosophy to have\ndevoted a distinct and articulated treatment to the issue of the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics, whose later impact on Arabic and Latin\nphilosophy has been enormous, insofar as it settled the issue of how\nmetaphysics can be both an ontology and a philosophical theology. The\nother aspects of the scientific reform of metaphysics introduced by\nAvicenna are also the result of applying the epistemological\nrequirements of the Posterior Analytics to this discipline.\nIn this way, Avicenna bestows on metaphysics an articulated and\ncoherent structure, based on the main elements that the Posterior\nAnalytics spell out as fundamental to every science: the parts,\nproperties, and principles of its subject-matter, and a method that\nis, as much as possible, demonstrative, in keeping with the\nPosterior Analytics\u2019 claim that demonstration is the\nmost perfect type of proof.\n\nAs to the recasting of the content of the Metaphysics in\nThe Science of Divine Things, Avicenna quotes all the\nfourteen books into which the Metaphysics is traditionally\ndivided (apart, perhaps, from book \u039a), but according to an order\nthat is strikingly different from that of Aristotle\u2019s work. In\nThe Science of Divine Things, however, Avicenna not only\nmodifies the content of the Metaphysics; he also integrates\nthemes taken from other sources, either from other Aristotelian\nwritings; or from texts belonging to the Greek and Arabic Peripatetic\ntradition, in which Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics was\ncommented, elaborated, and expanded; or from his own cultural context.\nIn this last respect, the philosophical theology of The Science of\nDivine Things includes a series of themes familiar to the Muslim\naudience of the work (the existence of God, His attributes,\nprovidence, theodicy, man\u2019s destiny in the afterlife, prophecy\netc.), which are treated on a strictly philosophical basis, but with\noccasional recourse to examples, terminology, and scriptural\nquotations of clear Islamic provenance, used to confirm the rational\nconclusions reached. This, together with the theological views debated\nthroughout the work, indicates Avicenna\u2019s intention to show that\nthe philosophical world-view expressed in metaphysics is not contrary\nor alien to the Islamic one, and that it can provide rational access\nto some of the tenets of the Muslim creed. The Science of Divine\nThings, however, is not the mere sum of its many sources. Within\nthe framework of metaphysics, Avicenna introduces original doctrines,\nsome of which are narrower in scope and occur in localized parts of\nthe work, while others are recurrent and serve to connect and unify\nits various themes. Most notorious among this latter category\nare\u2014besides the already mentioned account of the subject-matter\nof metaphysics\u2014the distinction between essence and existence in\ncreated beings, which is the theoretical leitmotif of the work, and\nthe metaphysical proof of God\u2019s existence, grounded in\nAvicenna\u2019s view of the subject-matter of metaphysics and of\ncausation, and placed at the beginning of the section on philosophical\ntheology (chapters 1\u20133 of treatise VIII). The distinction\nbetween essence and existence is the most famous among\nAvicenna\u2019s own doctrines and underlies many themes of\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics: it justifies, for instance, the\ndifference between the primary concepts \u201cthing\u201d (i.e.,\n\u201cthat which has an essence\u201d) and \u201cexistent\u201d at\nthe beginning of the work; it grounds the theory of universals\n(universality is an attribute that belongs to an essence not as such,\nbut when this latter exists in the human mind, abstracted from the\nextra-mental things in which it is instantiated); and it leads to the\nfundamental characterization of God as the only being that has no\nessence apart from existence, or whose essence is totally identical to\nits existence. Equally important in The Science of Divine\nThings is the proof of God\u2019s existence, which is announced\nat the beginning of the work (I.6) and completed towards its end\n(VIII.1\u20133). It involves a precise view of the relationship\nbetween metaphysics and natural philosophy, being properly\nmetaphysical and independent from the conclusions reached in physics;\nit turns out to be original with regard to the other metaphysical\nwritings of Avicenna, because it is based not only on a precise\ndoctrine of the Metaphysics (the finiteness of causal chains\nin Metaph. \u03b1, 2), but also on the text itself of this\nchapter of Aristotle\u2019s work, as we have seen.\n\nAs to the role of metaphysics among the sciences, this discipline for\nAvicenna holds a position of eminence with respect to all other\nbranches of philosophy. The series of disciplines constituting the\n\u0160if\u0101\u02be amounts to a concrete classification\nof the sciences: in it, metaphysics functions as the \u201cqueen of\nthe sciences\u201d that ascertains the principles taken for granted\nby all the other sciences, and interconnects and orders hierarchically\nthe system. Metaphysics is foundational insofar as it is the universal\nscience of the existent qua existent (ontology). The\nscientific principles assessed by metaphysics are, on the one hand,\nthe logical laws common to all the sciences (the axioms), and the\nuniversal concepts that every science uses without examining them (the\nprimary concepts like \u201cexistent\u201d, \u201cthing\u201d,\n\u201cnecessary\u201d, \u201cone\u201d). On the other hand,\nmetaphysics clarifies the principles that are proper to each of the\nparticular sciences, i.e., their specific assumptions or hypotheses.\nThus, metaphysics proves the very existence and the mode of existence\nof the subject-matters of the other sciences (for example, the\nexistence of universals and categories in logic, of matter and form in\nnatural philosophy, and of discrete and continuous quantity in\nmathematics).\n\nIn Avicenna, all the previous trends of the Arabic tradition of the\nMetaphysics converge and find their synthesis. This is\nparticularly manifest in the philosophical theology that invariably\nconcludes his accounts of metaphysics in the summae and that\nfinds its most lucid expression in The Science of Divine\nThings. In this section, Avicenna reiterates the connection\nbetween Metaph. \u03b1, 2 and \u039b, 6\u201310 that is\ntypical of al-Kind\u012b\u2019s selective way of approaching the\nMetaphysics, while also incorporating procedures of\nexplanation ad litteram and by way of questions (per\nmodum quaestionis) of Metaph. \u03b1, 2 that are\nreminiscent of the Baghdad Aristotelians\u2019 exegetical method, and\ndiscussing a sequence of themes that mirrors the structure of the\ntheological philosophy of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s political\ntreatises. The Aristotelian core of this section is then expanded by\nmeans of accretions taken from Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 and\nThemistius\u2019 works on metaphysics (the Aristotelian commentators\nmentioned by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and translated into Arabic by\nthe Baghdad Aristotelians), and from the pseudo-Aristotelian,\nNeoplatonic works that were commonly appended to the\nMetaphysics in Arabic philosophy, i.e., the Plotinian\nTheologia Aristotelis and the Proclean Liber de\nCausis, produced within al-Kind\u012b\u2019s circle. As a\nresult, Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics harmonizes al-Kind\u012b\u2019s\nemphasis on the theological component of the Metaphysics with\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s vindication of the foundational role\nof ontology; by the same token, Avicenna reconciles\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s view of metaphysics as a science\nmodeled on the epistemology of the Posterior Analytics with\nthe Baghdad Aristotelians\u2019 project of an integral explanation of\nAristotle\u2019s text. In this way, the congruence of metaphysics\nwith Islamic theology is not realized in a \u201cKindian\u201d way,\ni.e., by limiting the scope of this discipline to a part of the\nMetaphysics, but depends, in a more \u201cFarabian\u201d\nvein, upon the entire work of Aristotle once its inner structure has\nbeen properly underscored. Likewise, the task of conforming\nmetaphysics to the methodological standards of the Posterior\nAnalytics is accomplished at the same time as the goal of\nelucidating the textual obscurities and the interpretative problems of\nthe Metaphysics.\n\nThe other metaphysical summae by Avicenna single out and\nemphasize particular aspects of the overarching architecture of\nmetaphysics displayed in The Science of Divine Things. Thus,\nThe Book of Pointers and Reminders (Kit\u0101b\nal-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t wa-l-Tanb\u012bh\u0101t) underscores\nthe importance of philosophical theology within metaphysics by\nexpanding it with respect to a much thinner ontology; the Persian\nThe Book of Science for \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be-al-Dawla\n(D\u0101ne\u0161n\u0101me-ye \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b)\nplaces metaphysics as first theoretical discipline (before natural\nphilosophy and mathematics), after the preliminary logic, in order to\nsignal its priority in the system of the sciences; the lost\nmetaphysics of The Easterners\n(Al-Ma\u0161riqiyy\u016bn) or The Eastern\nPhilosophy (Al-\u1e24ikma al-ma\u0161riqiyya) might\nhave assigned a clear-cut epistemological role to the divide between\nontology and philosophical theology within metaphysics by splitting\nmetaphysics into two distinct sciences corresponding to these two\nparts. The metaphysics of The Book of Salvation\n(Kit\u0101b al-Na\u01e7\u0101t), finally, though structurally\nsimilar to The Science of Divine Things, differs from it in\nspecific points and formulations, in so far as it incorporates\ndoctrines from Avicenna\u2019s previous metaphysical works.\n\nBesides the overall treatment of metaphysics in the summae,\nAvicenna investigates particular metaphysical areas in specific\ntreatises, such as the Book of Provenance and Destination\n(Kit\u0101b al-Mabda\u02be wa-l-ma\u02bf\u0101d), which\nfocuses, within metaphysics, on philosophical theology, or the\nEpistle of Immolation about Destination (Al-Ris\u0101la\nal-a\u1e0d\u1e25awiyya f\u012b amr al-ma\u02bf\u0101d), which\nconcentrates on a specific topic of philosophical theology, or in\nallegorical writings, such as the \u1e24ayy Ibn\nYaq\u1e93\u0101n or the Epistle of the Bird\n(Ris\u0101lat al-\u1e6cayr). Various issues pertaining to\nmetaphysics are extensively debated in works that contain his\nreflections on key philosophical themes, such as the Notes\n(Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t), or that derive from the teaching\nactivity and the dialectical practices performed within his circle,\ni.e., the Discussions\n(Mub\u0101\u1e25a\u1e6f\u0101t). Related to metaphysics are\nthe specific essays ascribed to Avicenna and devoted to the\nphilosophical and allegorical interpretation of some Qur\u2019anic\nverses, whose authenticity however remains to be assessed.\n",
