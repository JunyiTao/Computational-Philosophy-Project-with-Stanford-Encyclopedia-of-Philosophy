    "main_text": "Non-Doxastic Accounts || Asymmetry\n3.3 Asymmetry\n\n\nAsymmetry accounts explain modesty not in terms of particular\nstates, but in different norms governing self and other. Maes (2004)\nemphasizes differences between what we can acceptably say or think\nabout ourselves and others. So, for example, saying \u201cI deserve a\nstanding ovation\u201d is very different from \u201cShe deserves a\nstanding ovation\u201d (2004, 489). Utterances and thoughts about\nourselves have special norms that are different from those concerning\nothers.\n\n\nThis is in stark contrast with views that see modesty rooted in\nattitudes that apply to everyone, like egalitarian accounts. Modesty on\nthis view is not about seeing some features of the world that apply to\neveryone, but instead seeing how different norms apply to\nself-references. What explains modesty\u2019s self-attribution\nstrangeness on this view is a more general difference in self-regarding\nattitudes; Maes (2004, 490ff.) also discusses, for example, gift-giving\nand receiving compliments in this way too.\n",
