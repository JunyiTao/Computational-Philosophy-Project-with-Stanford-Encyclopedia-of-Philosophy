    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination || Psychopathology\n3.3 Psychopathology\n\nAutism and delusions have been\u2014with much\ncontroversy\u2014characterized as disorders of imagination. That is,\nthe atypical patterns of cognition and behavior associated with each\npsychopathology have been argued to result from atypical functions of\nimagination.\n\nAutism can be characterized in terms of a trio of\natypicalities often referred to as \u201cWing\u2019s triad\u201d:\nproblems in typical social competence, communication, and imagination\n(Happ\u00e9 1994; Wing & Gould 1979). The imaginative aspect of\nautism interacts with other prominent roles of imagination, namely\nmindreading, pretense, and engagement with the arts (Carruthers 2009).\nChildren with autism do not engage in spontaneous pretend play in the\nways that typically-developing children do, engaging instead in\nrepetitive and sometimes obsessional activities; and adults with\nautism often show little interest in fiction (Carpenter, Tomasello,\n& Striano 2005; Happ\u00e9 1994; Rogers, Cook, & Meryl 2005;\nWing & Gould 1979). The degree to which an imaginative deficit is\nimplicated in autism remains a matter of considerable debate. Most\nradically, Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) have argued that,\nwith respect to Wing\u2019s triad, problems in typical social\ncompetence and communication are rooted in an inability to engage in\nimaginative activities.\n\nDelusions can be characterized as belief-like mental\nrepresentations that manifest an unusual degree of disconnectedness\nfrom reality (Bortolotti & Miyazono 2015). Particularly striking\nexamples would include Capgras and Cotard delusions. In the former,\nthe sufferer takes her friends and family to have been replaced by\nimposters; in the latter, the sufferer takes himself to be dead. More\nmundane examples might include ordinary cases of self-deception.\n\nOne approach to delusions characterize them as beliefs that are\ndysfunctional in their content or formation. (For a representative\ncollection of papers that present and criticize this perspective, see\nColtheart & Davies (eds.) 2000). However, another approach to\ndelusions characterize them as dysfunctions of imaginings. Currie and\nRavenscroft (2002: 170\u2013175) argue that delusions are imaginings\nthat are misidentified by the subject as the result of an inability to\nkeep track of the sources of one\u2019s thoughts. That is, a delusion\nis an imagined representation that is misidentified by the subject as\na belief. Tamar Szab\u00f3 Gendler (2007) argues that in cases of\ndelusions and self-deceptions, imaginings come to play a role in\none\u2019s cognitive architecture similar to that typically played by\nbeliefs. Andy Egan (2008a) likewise argues that the mental states\ninvolved in delusions are both belief-like (in their connection to\nbehaviors and inferences) and imagination-like (in their\ncircumscription); however, he argues that these functional\nsimilarities suggest the need to posit an in-between attitude called\n\u201cbimagination\u201d.\n",
