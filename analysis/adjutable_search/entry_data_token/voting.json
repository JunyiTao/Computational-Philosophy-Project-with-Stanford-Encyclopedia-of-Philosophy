The Rationality of Voting\n\nThe act of voting has an opportunity cost. It takes time and effort\nthat could be used for other valuable things, such as working for pay,\nvolunteering at a soup kitchen, or playing video games. Further,\nidentifying issues, gathering political information, thinking or\ndeliberating about that information, and so on, also take time and\neffort which could be spent doing other valuable things. Economics, in\nits simplest form, predicts that rational people will perform an\nactivity only if doing so maximizes expected utility. However,\neconomists have long worried that, that for nearly every individual\ncitizen, voting does not maximize expected utility. This leads to the\n\u201cparadox of voting\u201d(Downs 1957): Since the expected costs\n(including opportunity costs) of voting appear to exceed the expected\nbenefits, and since voters could always instead perform some action\nwith positive overall utility, it\u2019s surprising that anyone\nvotes.\n\nHowever, whether voting is rational or not depends on just what voters\nare trying to do. Instrumental theories of the rationality of voting\nhold that it can be rational to vote when the voter\u2019s goal is to\ninfluence or change the outcome of an election, including the\n\u201cmandate\u201d the winning candidate receives. (The mandate\ntheory of elections holds that a candidate\u2019s effectiveness in\noffice, i.e., her ability to get things done, is in part a function of\nhow large or small a lead she had over her competing candidates during\nthe election.) In contrast, the expressive theory of voting holds that\nvoters vote in order to express themselves and their fidelity to\ncertain groups or ideas. Alternatively, one might hold that voting is\nrational because it is has consumption value; many people enjoy\npolitical participation for its own sake or for being able to show\nothers that they voted. Finally, if one believes, as most democratic\ncitizens say they do (Mackie 2010), that voting is a substantial moral\nobligation, then voting could be rational because it is necessary to\ndischarge one\u2019s obligation.\n1.1 Voting to Change the Outcome\n\nOne reason a person might vote is to influence, or attempt to change,\nthe outcome of an election. Suppose there are two candidates, D\nand R. Suppose Sally prefers D to R. Suppose she\ncorrectly believes that D would do a trillion dollars more\noverall good than R would do. If her beliefs were correct, then\nby hypothesis, it would be best if D won.\n\nHere, casting the expected value difference between the two candidates\nin monetary terms is a simplifying assumption. Whether political\noutcomes can be described in monetary terms as such is not without\ncontroversy. To illustrate, suppose the difference between two\ncandidates came down entirely to how many lives would be lost in the\nway they would conduct a current war. Whether we can translate\n\u201clives lost\u201d into dollar terms is controversial. Further,\nwhether we can commensurate all the distinct goods and harms a\ncandidate might cause onto a common scale is also controversial.\n\nEven if the expected value difference between two candidates could be\nexpressed on some common value scale, such as in monetary terms, this\nleaves open whether the typical voter is aware of or can generally\nestimate that difference. Empirical work generally finds that most\nvoters are badly informed, and further, that many of them are not\nvoting for the purpose of promoting certain policies or platforms over\nothers (Achen and Bartels 2016; Kinder and Kalmoe 2017; Mason 2017).\nBeyond that, estimating the value difference between candidates\nrequires evaluating complex counterfactuals, estimating what various\ncandidates are likely to achieve, and determining what the outcomes of\nthese actions would be (Freiman 2020).\n\nThese worries aside, even if Sally is correct that D will do a\ntrillion dollars more good than R, this does not yet show it is\nrational for Sally to vote for D. Instead, this depends on how\nlikely it is that her vote will make a difference. In much the same\nway, it might be worth $200 million to win the lottery, but that does\nnot imply it is rational to buy a lottery ticket.\n\nSuppose Sally\u2019s only goal, in voting, is to change the outcome\nof the election between two major candidates. In that case, the\nexpected value of her vote (\\(U_v\\)) is: \n\n\\[\nU_v = p[V(D) - V(R)] - C\n\\]\n\n\nwhere p represents the probability that Sally\u2019s vote is\ndecisive, \\([V(D) - V(R)]\\) represents (in monetary terms) the\ndifference in the expected value of the two candidates, and C\nrepresents the opportunity cost of voting. In short, the value of her\nvote is the value of the difference between the two candidates\ndiscounted by her chance of being decisive, minus the opportunity cost\nof voting. In this way, voting is indeed like buying a lottery ticket.\nUnless \\(p[V(D) - V(R)] > C\\), then it is (given Sally\u2019s stated\ngoals) irrational for her to vote.\n\nThe equation above models the rationality of Sally\u2019s choice to\nvote under the assumption that she is simply trying to change the\noutcome of the election, and gets no further benefit from\nvoting. Further, the equation assumes her vote confers no other\nbenefit to others than having some chance of changing which candidate\nwins. However, these are controversial simplifying assumptions. It is\npossible that the choice to cast a vote may induce others to vote,\nmight improve the quality of the ground decision by adding cognitive\ndiversity, might have some marginal influence on which candidates or\nplatforms parties run, or might have some other effect not modeled in\nthe equation above.\n\nAgain, it is controversial among some philosophers whether the\ndifference in value between two candidates can be expressed, in\nprinciple, in monetary terms. Nevertheless, the point generalizes in\nsome way. If we are discussing the instrumental value of a vote, then\nthe general point is that the vote depends on the expected difference\nin value between the chosen candidate and the next best alternative,\ndiscounted by the probability of the vote breaking a tie, and we must\nthen take into account the opportunity cost of voting. For instance,\nif two candidates were identical except that one would save one more\nlife than another, but one had a 1 in 1 billion chance of being\ndecisive, and instead of voting one could save a drowning toddler,\nthen it seems voting is not worthwhile, even if we cannot assign an\nexact monetary value to thee consequences.\n\nThere is some debate among economists, political scientists, and\nphilosophers over the precise way to calculate the probability that a\nvote will be decisive. Nevertheless, they generally agree that the\nprobability that the modal individual voter in a typical election will\nbreak a tie is small. Binomial models of voting estimate the\nprobability of a vote being decisive by modeling voters as if they\nwere weighted coins and then asking what the probability is that a\nweighted coin will come up heads exactly 50% of the time. These models\ngenerally imply that the probability of being decisive, if any\ncandidate has a lead, is vanishingly small, which in turn implies that\nthe expected benefit of voting (i.e., \\(p[V(D) - V(R)]\\)) for a good\ncandidate is worth far less than a millionth of a penny (G. Brennan\nand Lomasky 1993: 56\u20137, 119). A more optimistic estimate in the\nliterature, which uses statistical estimate techniques based on past\nelections, claims that in a typical presidential election, American\nvoters have widely varying chances of being decisive depending on\nwhich state they vote in. This model still predicts that a typical\nvote in a \u201csafe\u201d states, like California, has a\nvanishingly small chance of making a difference, but suggests that\nthat a vote in very close states could have on the order of a 1 in 10\nmillion chance of breaking a tie (Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan\n2007). Thus, on both of these popular models, whether voting for the\npurpose of changing the outcome is rational depends upon the facts on\nthe ground, including how close the election is and how significant\nthe value difference is between the candidates. The binomial model\nsuggests it will almost never be rational to vote, while the\nstatistical model suggests it will be rational for voters to vote in\nsufficiently close elections or in swing states.\n\nHowever, some claim even these assessments are optimistic. One worry\nis that if a major election in most places came down to a single vote,\nthe issue might be decided in the courts after extensive lawsuits\n(Somin 2013). Further, in making such estimates, we have assumed that\nvoters can reliably identify which candidate is better and reliably\nestimate how much better that candidate is. But perhaps voters cannot.\nAfter all, showing that individual votes matter is a double-edged\nsword; the more expected good an individual vote can do, the more\nexpected harm it can do (J. Brennan 2011a; Freiman 2020). \n1.2 Voting to Change the \u201cMandate\u201d\n\nOne popular response to the paradox of voting is to posit that voters\nare not trying to determine who wins, but instead trying to change the\n\u201cmandate\u201d the elected candidate receives. The assumption\nhere is that an elected official\u2019s efficacy\u2014i.e., her\nability to get things done in office\u2014depends in part on how\nlarge of a majority vote she received. If that were true, I might vote\nfor what I expect to be the winning candidate in order to increase her\nmandate, or vote against the expected winner to reduce her mandate.\nThe virtue of the mandate hypothesis, if it were true, is that it\ncould explain why it would be rational to vote even in elections where\none candidate enjoys a massive lead coming into the election.\n\nHowever, the mandate argument faces two major problems. First, even if\nwe assume that such mandates exist, to know whether voting is\nrational, we would need to know how much the nth\nvoter\u2019s vote increases the marginal effectiveness of her\npreferred candidate, or reduces the marginal effectiveness of her\ndispreferred candidate. Suppose voting for the expected winning\ncandidate costs me $15 worth of my time. It would be rational for me\nto vote only if I believed my individual vote would give the winning\ncandidate at least $15 worth of electoral efficacy (and I care about\nthe increased efficiency as much or more than my opportunity costs).\nIn principle, whether individual votes change the\n\u201cmandate\u201d this much is something that political scientists\ncould measure, and indeed, they have tried to do so. \n\nBut this brings us to the second, deeper problem: Political scientists\nhave done extensive empirical work trying to test whether electoral\nmandates exist, and they now roundly reject the mandate hypothesis\n(Dahl 1990b; Noel 2010). A winning candidate\u2019s ability to get\nthings done is generally not affected by how small or large of a\nmargin she wins by.\n\nPerhaps voting is rational not as a way of trying to change how\neffective the elected politician will be, but instead as a way of\ntrying to change the kind of mandate the winning politician enjoys\n(Guerrero 2010). Perhaps a vote could transform a candidate from a\ndelegate to a trustee. A delegate tries to do what she believes her\nconstituents want, but a trustee has the normative legitimacy to do\nwhat she believes is best.\n\nSuppose for the sake of argument that trustee representatives are\nsignificantly more valuable than delegates, and that what makes a\nrepresentative a trustee rather than a delegate is her large margin of\nvictory. Unfortunately, this does not yet show that the expected\nbenefits of voting exceed the expected costs. Suppose (as in Guerrero\n2010: 289) that the distinction between a delegate and trustee lies on\na continuum, like difference between bald and hairy. To show voting is\nrational, one would need to show that the marginal impact of an\nindividual vote, as it moves a candidate a marginal degree from\ndelegate to trustee, is higher than the opportunity cost of voting. If\nvoting costs me $15 worth of time, then, on this theory, it would be\nrational to vote only if my vote is expected to move my favorite\ncandidate from delegate to trustee by an increment worth at least $15\n(Guerrero 2010: 295\u2013297).\n\nAlternatively, suppose that there were a determinate threshold (either\nknown or unknown) of votes at which a winning candidate is suddenly\ntransformed from being a delegate to a trustee. By casting a vote, the\nvoter has some chance of decisively pushing her favored candidate over\nthis threshold. However, just as the probability that her vote will\ndecide the election is vanishingly small, so the probability that her\nvote will decisively transform a representative from a delegate into a\ntrustee would be vanishingly small. Indeed, the formula for\ndetermining decisiveness in transforming a candidate into a trustee\nwould be roughly the same as determining whether the voter would break\na tie. Thus, suppose it\u2019s a billion or even a trillion dollars\nbetter for a representative to be a trustee rather than a candidate.\nEven if so, the expected benefit of an individual vote is still less\nthan a penny, which is lower than the opportunity cost of voting.\nAgain, it\u2019s wonderful to win the lottery, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s rational to buy a ticket.\n1.3 Other Reasons to Vote\n\nOther philosophers have attempted to shift the focus on other ways\nindividual votes might be said to \u201cmake a difference\u201d.\nPerhaps by voting, a voter has a significant chance of being among the\n\u201ccausally efficacious set\u201d of votes, or is in some way\ncausally responsible for the outcome (Tuck 2008; Goldman 1999).\n\nOn these theories, what voters value is not changing the outcome, but\nbeing agents who have participated in causing various outcomes. These\ncausal theories of voting claim that voting is rational provided the\nvoter sufficiently cares about being a cause or among the joint causes\nof the outcome. Voters vote because they wish to bear the right kind\nof causal responsibility for outcomes, even if their individual\ninfluence is small.\n\nWhat these alternative theories make clear is that whether voting is\nrational depends in part upon what the voters\u2019 goals are. If\ntheir goal is to in some way change the outcome of the election, or to\nchange which policies are implemented, then voting is indeed\nirrational, or rational only in unusual circumstances or for a small\nsubset of voters. However, perhaps voters have other goals.\n\nThe expressive theory of voting (G. Brennan and Lomasky 1993) holds\nthat voters vote in order to express themselves. On the expressive\ntheory, voting is a consumption activity rather than a productive\nactivity; it is more like reading a book for pleasure than it is like\nreading a book to develop a new skill. On this theory, though the act\nof voting is private, voters regard voting as an apt way to\ndemonstrate and express their commitment to their political team.\nVoting is like wearing a Metallica T-shirt at a concert or doing the\nwave at a sports game. Sports fans who paint their faces the team\ncolors do not generally believe that they, as individuals, will change\nthe outcome of the game, but instead wish to demonstrate their\ncommitment to their team. Even when watching games alone, sports fans\ncheer and clap for their teams. Perhaps voting is like this.\n\nThis \u201cexpressive theory of voting\u201d is untroubled by and\nindeed partly supported by the empirical findings that most voters are\nignorant about basic political facts (Somin 2013; Delli Carpini and\nKeeter, 1996). The expressive theory is also untroubled by and indeed\npartly supported by work in political psychology showing that most\ncitizens suffer from significant \u201cintergroup bias\u201d: we\ntend to automatically form groups, and to be irrationally loyal to and\nforgiving of our own group while irrationally hateful of other groups\n(Lodge and Taber 2013; Haidt 2012; Westen, Blagov, Harenski, Kilts,\nand Hamann 2006; Westen 2008). Voters might adopt ideologies in order\nto signal to themselves and others that they are certain kinds of\npeople. For example, suppose Bob wants to express that he is a patriot\nand a tough guy. He thus endorses hawkish military actions, e.g., that\nthe United States nuke Russia for interfering with Ukraine. It would\nbe disastrous for Bob were the US to do what he wants. However, since\nBob\u2019s individual vote for a militaristic candidate has little\nhope of being decisive, Bob can afford to indulge irrational and\nmisinformed beliefs about public policy and express those beliefs at\nthe polls.\n\nAnother simple and plausible argument is that it can be rational to\nvote in order to discharge a perceived duty to vote (Mackie 2010).\nSurveys indicate that most citizens in fact believe there is a duty to\nvote or to \u201cdo their share\u201d (Mackie 2010: 8\u20139). If\nthere are such duties, and these duties are sufficiently weighty, then\nit would be rational for most voters to vote.\n2. The Moral Obligation to Vote\n\nSurveys show that most citizens in contemporary democracies believe\nthere is some sort of moral obligation to vote (Mackie 2010:\n8\u20139). Other surveys show most moral and political philosophers\nagree (Schwitzgebel and Rust 2010). They tend to believe that citizens\nhave a duty to vote even when these citizens rightly believe their\nfavored party or candidate has no serious chance of winning (Campbell,\nGurin, and Mill 1954: 195). Further, most people seem to think that\nthe duty to vote specifically means a duty to turn out to vote\n(perhaps only to cast a blank ballot), rather than a duty to vote a\nparticular way. On this view, citizens have a duty simply to cast a\nvote, but nearly any good-faith vote is morally acceptable.\n\nMany popular arguments for a duty to vote rely upon the idea that\nindividual votes make a significant difference. For instance, one\nmight argue that that there is a duty to vote because there is a duty\nto protect oneself, a duty to help others, or to produce good\ngovernment, or the like. However, these arguments face the problem, as\ndiscussed in section 1, that individual votes have vanishingly small\ninstrumental value (or disvalue)\n\nFor instance, one early hypothesis was that voting might be a form of\ninsurance, meant to to prevent democracy from collapsing (Downs 1957:\n257). Following this suggestion, suppose one hypothesizes that\ncitizens have a duty to vote in order to help prevent democracy from\ncollapsing. Suppose there is some determinate threshold of votes under\nwhich a democracy becomes unstable and collapses. The problem here is\nthat just as there is a vanishingly small probability that any\nindividual\u2019s vote would decide the election, so there is a\nvanishingly small chance that any vote would decisively put the number\nof votes above that threshold. Alternatively, suppose that as fewer\nand fewer citizens vote, the probability of democracy collapsing\nbecomes incrementally higher. If so, to show there is a duty to vote,\none would first need to show that the marginal expected benefits of\nthe nth vote, in reducing the chance of democratic collapse,\nexceed the expected costs (including opportunity costs).\n\nA plausible argument for a duty to vote would thus not depend on\nindividual votes having significant expected value or impact on\ngovernment or civic culture. Instead, a plausible argument for a duty\nto vote should presume that individual votes make little difference in\nchanging the outcome of election, but then identify a reason why\ncitizens should vote anyway.\n\nOne suggestion (Beerbohm 2012) is that citizens have a duty to vote to\navoid complicity with injustice. On this view, representatives act in\nthe name of the citizens. Citizens count as partial authors of the\nlaw, even when the citizens do not vote or participate in government.\nCitizens who refuse to vote are thus complicit in allowing their\nrepresentatives to commit injustice. Perhaps failure to resist\ninjustice counts as kind of sponsorship. (This theory thus implies\nthat citizens do not merely have a duty to vote rather than abstain,\nbut specifically have a duty to vote for candidates and policies that\nwill reduce injustice.) \n\nAnother popular argument, which does not turn on the efficacy of\nindividual votes, is the \u201cGeneralization Argument\u201d:\n\nWhat if everyone were to stay home and not vote? The results would be\ndisastrous! Therefore, I (you/she) should vote. (Lomasky and G.\nBrennan 2000: 75)\n\n\nThis popular argument can be parodied in a way that exposes its\nweakness. Consider:\n\nWhat if everyone were to stay home and not farm? Then we would all\nstarve to death! Therefore, I (you/she) should each become farmers.\n(Lomasky and G. Brennan 2000: 76)\n\n\nThe problem with this argument, as stated, is that even if it would be\ndisastrous if no one or too few performed some activity, it does not\nfollow that everyone ought to perform it. Instead, one conclude that\nit matters that sufficient number of people perform the activity. In\nthe case of farming, we think it\u2019s permissible for people to\ndecide for themselves whether to farm or not, because market\nincentives suffice to ensure that enough people farm.\n\nHowever, even if the Generalization Argument, as stated, is unsound,\nperhaps it is on to something. There are certain classes of actions in\nwhich we tend to presume everyone ought to participate (or ought not\nto participate). For instance, suppose a university places a sign\nsaying, \u201cKeep off the newly planted grass.\u201d It\u2019s not\nas though the grass will die if one person walks on it once. If I were\nallowed to walk on it at will while the rest of you refrained from\ndoing so, the grass would probably be fine. Still, it would seem\nunfair if the university allowed me to walk on the grass at will but\nforbade everyone else from doing so. It seems more appropriate to\nimpose the duty to keep off the lawn equally on everyone. Similarly,\nif the government wants to raise money to provide a public good, it\ncould just tax a randomly chosen minority of the citizens. However, it\nseems more fair or just for everyone (at least above a certain income\nthreshold) to pay some taxes, to share in the burden of providing\npolice protection.\n\nWe should thus ask: is voting more like the first kind of activity, in\nwhich it is only imperative that enough people do it, or the second\nkind, in which it\u2019s imperative that everyone do it? One\ndifference between the two kinds of activities is what abstention does\nto others. If I abstain from farming, I don\u2019t thereby take\nadvantage of or free ride on farmers\u2019 efforts. Rather, I\ncompensate them for whatever food I eat by buying that food on the\nmarket. In the second set of cases, if I freely walk across the lawn\nwhile everyone else walks around it, or if I enjoy police protection\nbut don\u2019t pay taxes, it appears I free ride on others\u2019\nefforts. They bear an uncompensated differential burden in maintaining\nthe grass or providing police protection, and I seem to be taking\nadvantage of them.\n\nA defender of a duty to vote might thus argue that non-voters free\nride on voters. Non-voters benefit from the government that voters\nprovide, but do not themselves help to provide government. \n\nThere are at least a few arguments for a duty to vote that do not\ndepend on the controversial assumption that individual votes make a\ndifference:\n\n The Generalization/Public Goods/Debt to Society\nArgument: Claims that citizens who abstain from voting thereby\nfree ride on the provision of good government, or fail to pay their\n\u201cdebts to society\u201d.\n The Civic Virtue Argument: Claims that citizens have a\nduty to exercise civic virtue, and thus to vote.\n The Complicity Argument: Claims that citizens have a\nduty to vote (for just outcomes) in order to avoid being complicit in\nthe injustice their governments commit.\n\n\nHowever, there is a general challenge to these arguments in support of\na duty to vote. Call this the particularity problem: To show\nthat there is a duty to vote, it is not enough to appeal to some goal\nG that citizens plausibly have a duty to support, and then to\nargue that voting is one way they can support or help achieve\nG. Instead, proponents of a duty to vote need to show\nspecifically that voting is the only way, or the required way, to\nsupport G (J. Brennan 2011a). The worry is that the three\narguments above might only show that voting is one way among many to\ndischarge the duty in question. Indeed, it might not be even be an\nespecially good way, let alone the only or obligatory way to discharge\nthe duty.\n\nFor instance, suppose one argues that citizens should vote because\nthey ought to exercise civic virtue. One must explain why a duty to\nexercise civic virtue specifically implies a duty to vote, rather than\na duty just to perform one of thousands of possible acts of civic\nvirtue. Or, if a citizen has a duty to to be an agent who helps\npromote other citizens\u2019 well-being, it seems this duty could be\ndischarged by volunteering, making art, or working at a productive job\nthat adds to the social surplus. If a citizen has a duty to to avoid\ncomplicity in injustice, it seems that rather than voting, she could\nengage in civil disobedience; write letters to newspaper editors,\npamphlets, or political theory books; donate money; engage in\nconscientious abstention; protest; assassinate criminal political\nleaders; or do any number of other activities. It\u2019s unclear why\nvoting is special or required.\n\nNote that the particularity problem need not be framed in\nconsequentialist terms, i.e., both defenders and critics of the duty\nto vote need not say that what determines whether voting is morally\nrequired depends on whether voting has the highest expected\nconsequences. Rather, the issue is whether voting is simply one of\nmany ways to discharge an underlying duty or respond to underlying\nreasons, or whether voting is in some way special and unique, such\nthat these reasons select voting in particular as an obligatory means\nof responding to these underlying reasons.\n\nMaskivker (2019) responds partly to this objection by saying, in\neffect, \u201cWhy not both?\u201d J. Brennan (2011a) and Freiman (2020) say\nthat the underlying grounds for any duty to vote can be discharged\n(and discharged better) through actions other than voting. Maskivker\ntakes this to suggest not that voting is optional, but that one should\nvote (if one is already sufficiently well-informed and\npublicly-spirited) and also performs these other actions. Maskivker\ngrounds her argument on a deontological duty of easy aid: if one can\nprovide aid to others at very low cost to oneself, then one should do\nso. For already well-informed citizens, voting is an instance of easy\naid. \n2.1 A General Moral Obligation Not to Vote?\n\nWhile many hold that it is obligatory to vote, a few have argued that\nmany people have an obligation not to vote under special\ncircumstances. For instance, Sheehy (2002) argues that voting when one\nis indifferent to the election is unfair. He argues that if one\u2019s\nvote makes a difference, it could be to disappoint what otherwise\nwould be have been the majority coalition, whose position is now\nthwarted by those who, by hypothesis, have no preference. \n\nAnother argument holds that voting might be wrong because it is an\nineffective form of altruism. Freiman (2020) argues that when people\ndischarge their obligations to help and aid others, they are obligated\nto pursue effective rather than ineffective forms of altruism (see\nalso MacAskill 2015). For instance, suppose one has an obligation to\ngive a certain amount to charity each year. This obligation is not\nfundamentally about spending a certain percentage of one\u2019s money. If\na person gave 10% of their income to a charity that did no good at\nall, or which made the world worse, one would not have discharged the\nobligation to act beneficently. Similarly, Freiman argues, if a person\nis voting for the purpose of aiding and helping others, then they\nwould at the very least need to be sufficiently well-informed to vote\nfor the better candidate, a condition few voters meet (see section 3.2\nbelow). In part because most voters are in no position to judge\nwhether they are voting for the better or worse candidates, and in\npart simply because individual votes make little difference, votes and\nmost other forms of political action (such as donating to political campaigns,\ncanvassing, volunteering, and the like) are highly ineffective forms\nof altruism. Freiman claims that we are instead obligated to pursue\neffective forms of altruism, such as collecting and making donations\nto the Against Malaria Foundation. \n3. Moral Obligations Regarding How One Votes\n\nMost people appear to believe that there is a duty to cast a vote\n(perhaps including a blank ballot) rather than abstain (Mackie 2010:\n8\u20139), but this leaves open whether they believe there is a duty\nto vote in any particular way. Some philosophers and political\ntheorists have argued there are ethical obligations attached to how\none chooses to vote. For instance, many deliberative democrats (see\nChristiano 2006) believe not only that every citizen has a duty to\nvote, but also that they must vote in publicly-spirited ways, after\nengaging in various forms of democratic deliberation. In contrast,\nsome (G. Brennan and Lomasky 1993; J. Brennan 2009, 2011a)\nargue that while there is no general duty to vote (abstention is\npermissible), those citizens who do choose to vote have duties\naffecting how they vote. They argue that while it is not wrong to\nabstain, it is wrong to vote badly, in some theory-specified\nsense of \u201cbadly\u201d.\n\nNote that the question of how one ought to vote is distinct from the\nquestion of whether one ought to have the right to vote. The right to\nvote licenses a citizen to cast a vote. It requires the state to\npermit the citizen to vote and then requires the state to count that\nvote. This leaves open whether some ways a voter could vote could be\nmorally wrong, or whether other ways of voting might be morally\nobligatory. In parallel, my right of free association arguably\nincludes the right to join the Ku Klux Klan, while my right of free\nspeech arguably includes the right to advocate an unjust war. Still,\nit would be morally wrong for me to do either of these things, though\ndoing so is within my rights. Thus, just as someone can, without\ncontradiction, say, \u201cYou have the right to have racist\nattitudes, but you should not,\u201d so a person can, without\ncontradiction, say, \u201cYou have the right to vote for that\ncandidate, but you should not.\u201d\n\nA theory of voting ethics might include answers to any of the\nfollowing questions:\n\n The Intended Beneficiary of the Vote: Whose interests\nshould the voter take into account when casting a vote? May the voter\nvote selfishly, or should she vote sociotropically? If the latter, on\nbehalf of which group ought she vote: her demographic group(s), her\nlocal jurisdiction, the nation, or the entire world? Is it permissible\nto vote when one has no stake in the election, or is otherwise\nindifferent to the outcome?\n The Substance of the Vote: Are there particular\ncandidates or policies that the voter is obligated to support, or not\nto support? For instance, is a voter obligated to vote for whatever\nwould best produce the most just outcomes, according to the correct\ntheory of justice? Must the voter vote for candidates with good\ncharacter? May the voter vote strategically, or must she vote in\naccordance with her sincere preferences?\n Epistemic Duties Regarding Voting: Are voters required\nto have a particular degree of knowledge, or exhibit a particular kind\nof epistemic rationality, in forming their voting preferences? Is it\npermissible to vote in ignorance, on the basis of beliefs about social\nscientific matters that are formed without sufficient evidence?\n\n3.1 The Expressivist Ethics of Voting\n\nRecall that one important theory of voting behavior holds that most\ncitizens vote not in order to influence the outcome of the election or\ninfluence government policies, but in order to express themselves (G.\nBrennan and Lomasky 1993). They vote to signal to themselves and to\nothers that they are loyal to certain ideas, ideals, or groups. For\ninstance, I might vote Democrat to signal that I\u2019m compassionate\nand fair, or Republican to signal I\u2019m responsible, moral, and\ntough. If voting is primarily an expressive act, then perhaps the\nethics of voting is an ethics of expression (G. Brennan and Lomasky\n1993: 167\u2013198). We can assess the morality of voting by asking\nwhat it says about a voter that she voted like that: \n\nTo cast a Klan ballot is to identify oneself in a morally\nsignificant way with the racist policies that the organization\nespouses. One thereby lays oneself open to associated moral liability\nwhether the candidate has a small, large, or zero probability of\ngaining victory, and whether or not one\u2019s own vote has an\nappreciable likelihood of affecting the election result. (G. Brennan\nand Lomasky 1993: 186)\n\n\nThe idea here is that if it\u2019s wrong (even if it\u2019s within\nmy rights) in general for me to express sincere racist attitudes, and\nso it\u2019s wrong for me to express sincere racist commitments at\nthe polls. Similar remarks apply to other wrongful attitudes. To the\nextent it is wrong for me to express sincere support for illiberal,\nreckless, or bad ideas, it would also be wrong for me to vote for\ncandidates who support those ideas.\n\nOf course, the question of just what counts as wrongful and\npermissible expression is complicated. There is also a complicated\nquestion of just what voting expresses. What I think my vote expresses\nmight be different from what it expresses to others, or it might be\nthat it expresses different things to different people. The\nexpressivist theory of voting ethics acknowledges these difficulties,\nand replies that whatever we would say about the ethics of expression\nin general should presumably apply to expressive voting.\n3.2 The Epistemic Ethics of Voting\n\nConsider the question: What do doctors owe patients, parents owe\nchildren, or jurors owe defendants (or, perhaps, society)? Doctors owe\npatients proper care, and to discharge their duties, they must 1) aim\nto promote their patients\u2019 interests, and 2) reason about how to\ndo so in a sufficiently informed and rational way. Parents similarly\nowe such duties to their children. Jurors similarly owe society at\nlarge, or perhaps more specifically the defendant, duties to 1) try to\ndetermine the truth, and 2) do so in an informed and rational way. The\ndoctors, parents, and jurors are fiduciaries of others. They owe a\nduty of care, and this duty of care brings with it certain\nepistemic responsibilities. \n\nOne might try to argue that voters owe similar duties of care to the\ngoverned. Perhaps voters should vote 1) for what they perceive to be\nthe best outcomes (consistent with strategic voting) and 2) make such\ndecisions in a sufficiently informed and rational way. How voters vote\nhas significant impact on political outcomes, and can help determine\nmatters of peace and war, life and death, prosperity and poverty.\nMajority voters do not just choose for themselves, but for everyone,\nincluding dissenting minorities, children, non-voters, resident\naliens, and people in other countries affected by their decisions. For\nthis reason, voting seems to be a morally charged activity (Christiano\n2006; J. Brennan 2011a; Beerbohm 2012).\n\nThat said, one clear disanalogy between the relationship doctors have\nwith patients and voters have with the governed is that individual\nvoters have only a vanishingly small chance of making a difference.\nThe expected harm of an incompetent individual vote is vanishingly\nsmall, while the expected harm of incompetent individual medical\ndecisions is high. \n\nHowever, perhaps the point holds anyway. Define a \u201ccollectively\nharmful activity\u201d as an activity in which a group is imposing or\nthreatening to impose harm, or unjust risk of harm, upon other\ninnocent people, but the harm will be imposed regardless of whether\nindividual members of that group drop out. It\u2019s plausible that\none might have an obligation to refrain from participating in such\nactivities, i.e., a duty to keep one\u2019s hands clean.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose a 100-member firing squad is about to shoot an\ninnocent child. Each bullet will hit the child at the same time, and\neach shot would, on its own, be sufficient to kill her. You cannot\nstop them, so the child will die regardless of what you do. Now,\nsuppose they offer you the opportunity to join in and shoot the child\nwith them. You can make the 101st shot. Again, the child will die\nregardless of what you do. Is it permissible for you join the firing\nsquad? Most people have a strong intuition that it is wrong to join\nthe squad and shoot the child. One plausible explanation of why it is\nwrong is that there may be a general moral prohibition against\nparticipating in these kinds of activities. In these kinds of cases,\nwe should try to keep our hands clean.\n\nPerhaps this \u201cclean-hands principle\u201d can be generalized to\nexplain why individual acts of ignorant, irrational, or malicious\nvoting are wrong. The firing-squad example is somewhat analogous to\nvoting in an election. Adding or subtracting a shooter to the firing\nsquad makes no difference\u2014the girl will die anyway. Similarly,\nwith elections, individual votes make no difference. In both cases,\nthe outcome is causally overdetermined. Still, the irresponsible voter\nis much like a person who volunteers to shoot in the firing squad. Her\nindividual bad vote is of no consequence\u2014just as an individual\nshot is of no consequence\u2014but she is participating in a\ncollectively harmful activity when she could easily keep her hands\nclean (J. Brennan 2011a, 68\u201394).\n4. The Justice of Compulsory Voting\n\nVoting rates in many contemporary democracies are (according to many\nobservers) low, and seem in general to be falling. The United States,\nfor instance, barely manages about 60% in presidential elections and\n45% in other elections (Brennan and Hill 2014: 3). Many other\ncountries have similarly low rates. Some democratic theorists,\npoliticians, and others think this is problematic, and advocate\ncompulsory voting as a solution. In a compulsory voting regime,\ncitizens are required to vote by law; if they fail to vote without a\nvalid excuse, they incur some sort of penalty.\n\nOne major argument for compulsory voting is what we might call the\nDemographic or Representativeness Argument (Lijphart 1997; Engelen\n2007; Galston 2011; Hill in J. Brennan and Hill 2014: 154\u2013173;\nSingh 2015). The argument begins by noting that in voluntary voting\nregimes, citizens who choose to vote are systematically different from\nthose who choose to abstain. The rich are more likely to vote than the\npoor. The old are more likely to vote than the young. Men are more\nlikely to vote than women. In many countries, ethnic minorities are\nless likely to vote than ethnic majorities. More highly educated\npeople are more likely to vote than less highly educated people.\nMarried people are more likely to vote than non-married people.\nPolitical partisans are more likely to vote than true independents\n(Leighley and Nagler 1992; Evans 2003: 152\u20136). In short, under\nvoluntary voting, the electorate\u2014the citizens who actually\nchoose to vote\u2014are not fully representative of the public at\nlarge. The Demographic Argument holds that since politicians tend to\ngive voters what they want, in a voluntary voting regime, politicians\nwill tend to advance the interests of advantaged citizens (who vote\ndisproportionately) over the disadvantaged (who tend not to vote).\nCompulsory voting would tend to ensure that the disadvantaged vote in\nhigher numbers, and would thus tend to ensure that everyone\u2019s\ninterests are properly represented.\n\nRelatedly, one might argue compulsory voting helps citizens overcome\nan \u201cassurance problem\u201d (Hill 2006). The thought here is\nthat an individual voter realizes her individual vote has little\nsignificance. What\u2019s important is that enough other voters like\nher vote. However, she cannot easily coordinate with other voters and\nensure they will vote with her. Compulsory voting solves this problem.\nFor this reason, Lisa Hill (2006: 214\u201315) concludes,\n\u201cRather than perceiving the compulsion as yet another unwelcome\nform of state coercion, compulsory voting may be better understood as\na coordination necessity in mass societies of individual strangers\nunable to communicate and coordinate their preferences.\u201d\n\nWhether the Demographic Argument succeeds or not depends on a few\nassumptions about voter and politician behavior. First, political\nscientists overwhelmingly find that voters do not vote their\nself-interest, but instead vote for what they perceive to be the\nnational interest. (See the dozens of papers cited at Brennan and Hill\n2014: 38\u20139n28.) Second, it might turn out that disadvantaged\ncitizens are not informed enough to vote in ways that promote their\ninterests\u2014they might not have sufficient social scientific\nknowledge to know which candidates or political parties will help them\n(Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Caplan 2007; Somin 2013). Third, it\nmay be that even in a compulsory voting regime, politicians can get\naway with ignoring the policy preferences of most voters (Gilens 2012;\nBartels 2010).\n\nIn fact, contrary to many theorists\u2019 expectations, it appears\nthat compulsory voting has no significant effect on individual\npolitical knowledge (that is, it does not induce ignorant voters to\nbecome better informed), individual political conversation and\npersuasion, individual propensity to contact politicians, the\npropensity to work with others to address concerns, participation in\ncampaign activities, the likelihood of being contacted by a party or\npolitician, the quality of representation, electoral integrity, the\nproportion of female members of parliament, support for small or third\nparties, support for the left, or support for the far right (Birch\n2009; Highton and Wolfinger 2001). Political scientists have also been\nunable to demonstrate that compulsory voting leads to more egalitarian\nor left-leaning policy outcomes. The empirical literature so far shows\nthat compulsory voting gets citizens to vote, but it\u2019s not clear\nit does much else.\n\n5. The Ethics of Vote Buying\n\nMany citizens of modern democracies believe that vote buying and\nselling are immoral (Tetlock 2000). Many philosophers agree; they\nargue it is wrong to buy, trade, or sell votes (Satz 2010: 102; Sandel\n2012: 104\u20135). Richard Hasen reviews the literature on vote\nbuying and concludes that people have offered three main arguments\nagainst it. He says,\n\nDespite the almost universal condemnation of core vote buying,\ncommentators disagree on the underlying rationales for its\nprohibition. Some offer an equality argument against vote buying: the\npoor are more likely to sell their votes than are the wealthy, leading\nto political outcomes favoring the wealthy. Others offer an efficiency\nargument against vote buying: vote buying allows buyers to engage in\nrent-seeking that diminishes overall social wealth. Finally, some\ncommentators offer an inalienability argument against vote buying:\nvotes belong to the community as a whole and should not be alienable\nby individual voters. This alienability argument may support an\nanti-commodification norm that causes voters to make public-regarding\nvoting decisions. (Hasen 2000: 1325)\n\n\nTwo of the concerns here are consequentialist: the worry is that in a\nregime where vote-buying is legal, votes will be bought and sold in\nsocially destructive ways. However, whether vote buying is destructive\nis a subject of serious social scientific debate; some economists\nthink markets in votes would in fact produce greater efficiency\n(Buchanan and Tullock 1962; Haefele 1971; Mueller 1973; Philipson and\nSnyder 1996; Hasen 2000: 1332). The third concern is deontological: it\nholds that votes are just not the kind of thing that ought be for\nsale, even if it turned out that vote-buying and selling did not lead\nto bad consequences.\n\nMany people think vote selling is wrong because it would lead to bad\nor corrupt voting. But, if that is the problem, then perhaps the\npermissibility of vote buying and selling should be assessed on a\ncase-by-case basis. Perhaps the rightness or wrongness of individual\nacts of vote buying and selling depends entirely on how the vote\nseller votes (J. Brennan 2011a: 135\u2013160; Brennan and Jaworski\n2015: 183\u2013194). Suppose I pay a person to vote in a good way.\nFor instance, suppose I pay indifferent people to vote on behalf of\nwomen\u2019s rights, or for the Correct Theory of Justice, whatever\nthat might be. Or, suppose I think turnout is too low, and so I pay a\nwell-informed person to vote her conscience. It is unclear why we\nshould conclude in either case that I have done something wrong,\nrather than conclude that I have done everyone a small public service.\n\n\nCertain objections to vote buying and selling appear to prove too\nmuch; these objections lead to conclusions that the objectors are not\nwilling to support. For instance, one common argument against voting\nselling is that paying a person to vote imposes an externality on\nthird parties. However, so does persuading others to vote or to vote\nin certain ways (Freiman 2014: 762). If paying you to vote for\nX is wrong because it imposes a third party cost, then for the\nsake of consistency, I should also conclude that persuading you to\nvote for X, say, on the basis of a good argument, is equally\nproblematic. \n\nAs another example, some object to voting markets on the grounds that\nvotes should be for the common good, rather than for narrow\nself-interest (Satz 2010: 103; Sandel 2012: 10). Others say that\nvoting should \u201cbe an act undertaken only after collectively\ndeliberating about what it is in the common good\u201d (Satz 2010:\n103). Some claim that vote markets should be illegal for this reason.\nPerhaps it\u2019s permissible to forbid vote selling because\ncommodified votes are likely to be cast against the common good.\nHowever, if that is sufficient reason to forbid markets in votes, then\nit is unclear why we should not, e.g., forbid highly ignorant,\nirrational, or selfish voters from voting, as their votes are also\nunusually likely to undermine the common good (Freiman 2014:\n771\u2013772). Further these arguments appear to leave open that a\nperson could permissibly sell her vote, provided she does so after\ndeliberating and provided she votes for the common good. It might be\nthat if vote selling were legal, most or even all vote sellers would\nvote in destructive ways, but that does not show that vote selling is\ninherently wrong.\n\nOne pressing issue, though, is whether vote buying is compatible with\nthe secret ballot (Maloberti 2018). Regardless of whether vote buying\nis enforced through legal means (such as through enforceable\ncontracts) or social means (such as through the reputation mechanism\nin eBay or through simply social disapproval), to enforce vote buying\nseems to require that voters in some way actively prove they voted in\nvarious ways. But, if so, then this will partly eliminate the secret\nballot and possibly lead to increased clientelism, in which\npoliticians make targeted promises to particular bands of voters\nrather than serve the common good (Maloberti 2018).\n\nNot all objections to vote-buying have this consequentialist flavor.\nSome argue that vote buying is wrong for deontological grounds, for\ninstance, on the grounds that vote buying in some way is incompatible\nwith the social meaning of voting (e.g. Walzer 1984). Some view voting\nis an expressive act, and the meaning of that expression is\nsocially-determined. To buy and sell votes may signal disrespect to\nothers in light of this social meaning.\n6. Who Should Be Allowed to Vote? Should Everyone Receive Equal Voting Rights?\n\nThe dominant view among political philosophers is that we ought to\nhave some sort of representative democracy, and that each adult ought\nto have one vote, of equal weight to every other adult\u2019s, in any\nelection in her jurisdiction. This view has recently come under\ncriticism, though, both from friends and foes of democracy.\n\nBefore one even asks whether \u201cone person, one vote\u201d is the\nright policy, one needs to determine just who counts as part of the\ndemos. Call this the boundary problem or the problem of constituting\nthe demos (Goodin 2007: 40; Ron 2017). Democracy is the rule of the\npeople. But one fundamental question is just who constitutes\n\u201cthe people\u201d. This is no small problem. Before one can\njudge that a democracy is fair, or adequately responds to\ncitizens\u2019 interests, one needs to know who \u201ccounts\u201d\nand who does not.\n\nOne might be inclined to say that everyone living under a particular\ngovernment\u2019s jurisdiction is part of the demos and is thus\nentitled to a vote. However, in fact, most democracies exclude\nchildren and teenagers, felons, the mentally infirm, and non-citizens\nliving in a government\u2019s territory from being able to vote, but\nat the same time allow their citizens living in foreign countries to\nvote (L\u00f3pez-Guerra 2014: 1).\n\nThere are a number of competing theories here. The \u201call affected\ninterests\u201d theory (Dahl 1990a: 64) holds that anyone who is\naffected by a political decision or a political institution is part of\nthe demos. The basic argument is that anyone who is affected by a\npolitical decision-making process should have some say over that\nprocess. However, this principle suffers from multiple problems. It\nmay be incoherent or useless, as we might not know or be able to know\nwho is affected by a decision until after the decision is made (Goodin\n2007: 52). For example (taken from Goodin 2007: 53), suppose the UK\nvotes on whether to transfer 5% of its GDP to its former African\ncolonies. We cannot assess whether the members of the former African\ncolonies are among the affected interests until we know what the\noutcome of the vote is. If the vote is yay, then they are affected; if\nthe vote is nay, then they are not. (See Owen 2012 for a response.)\nFurther, the \u201call affected interests\u201d theory would often\ninclude non-citizens and exclude citizens. Sometimes political\ndecisions made in one country have a significant effect on citizens of\nanother country; sometimes political decisions made in one country\nhave little or no effect on some of the citizens of that country.\n\nOne solution (Goodin 2007: 55) to this problem (of who counts as an\naffected party) is to hold that all people with possibly or\npotentially affected interests constitute part of the polity.\nThis principle implies, however, that for many decisions, the demos is\nsmaller than the nation-state, and for others, it is larger. For\ninstance, when the United States decides whether to elect a\nwarmongering or pacifist candidate, this affects not only Americans,\nbut a large percentage of people worldwide.\n\nOther major theories offered as solutions to the boundary problem face\nsimilar problems. For example, the coercion theory holds that anyone\nsubject to coercion from a political body ought to have a say\n(L\u00f3pez-Guerra 2005). But this principle might be also be seen\nas over-inclusive (Song 2009), as it would require that resident\naliens, tourists, or even enemy combatants be granted a right to vote,\nas they are also subject to a state\u2019s coercive power. Further,\nwho will be coerced depends on the outcome of a decision. If a state\ndecides to impose some laws, it will coerce certain people, and if the\nstate declines to impose those laws, then it will not. If we try to\novercome this by saying anyone potentially subject to a given\nstate\u2019s coercive power ought to have a say, then this seems to\nimply that almost everyone worldwide should have a say in most\nstates\u2019 major decisions.\n\nThe commonsense view of the demos, i.e., that the demos includes all\nand only adult members of a nation-state, may be hard to defend.\nGoodin (2007: 49) proposes that what makes citizens special is that\ntheir interests are interlinked. This may be an accidental feature of\narbitrarily-decided national borders, but once these borders are in\nplace, citizens will find that their interests tend to more linked\ntogether than with citizens of other polities. But whether this is\ntrue is also highly contingent.\n6.1 Democratic Challenges to One Person, One Vote\n\nThe idea of \u201cOne person, one vote\u201d is supposedly grounded\non a commitment to egalitarianism. Some philosophers believe that\ndemocracy with equal voting rights is necessary to ensure that\ngovernment gives equal consideration to everyone\u2019s interests\n(Christiano 1996, 2008). However, it is not clear that giving every\ncitizen an equal right to vote reliably results in decisions that give\nequal consideration to everyone\u2019s interests. In many decisions,\nmany citizens have little to nothing at stake, while other citizens\nhave a great deal at stake. Thus, one alternative proposal is that\ncitizens\u2019 votes should be weighted by how much they have a stake\nin the decision. This preserves equality not by giving everyone an\nequal chance of being decisive in every decision, but by giving\neveryone\u2019s interests equal weight. Otherwise, in a system of one\nperson, one vote, issues that are deeply important to the few might\ncontinually lose out to issues of only minor interest to the many\n(Brighouse and Fleurbaey 2010).\n\nThere are a number of other independent arguments for this conclusion.\nPerhaps proportional voting enhances citizens\u2019 autonomy, by\ngiving them greater control over those issues in which they have\ngreater stakes, while few would regard it as significant loss of\nautonomy were they to have reduced control over issues that do not\nconcern them. Further, though the argument for this conclusion is too\ntechnical to cover here in depth (Brighouse and Fleurbaey 2010; List\n2013), it may be that apportioning political power according to\none\u2019s stake in the outcome can overcome some of the well-known\nparadoxes of democracy, such as the Condorcet Paradox (which show that\ndemocracies might have intransitive preferences, i.e., the majority\nmight prefer A to B, B to C, and yet also prefer C to A).\n\nHowever, even if this proposal seems plausible in theory, it is\nunclear how a democracy might reliably instantiate this in practice.\nBefore allowing a vote, a democratic polity would need to determine to\nwhat extent different citizens have a stake in the decision, and then\nsomehow weight their votes accordingly. In real life,\nspecial-interests groups and others would likely try to use vote\nweighting for their own ends. Citizens might regard unequal voting\nrights as evidence of corruption or electoral manipulation (Christiano\n2008: 34\u201345). \n6.2 Non-Democratic Challenges to One Person, One Vote\n\nEarly defenders of democracy were concerned to show democracy is\nsuperior to aristocracy, monarchy, or oligarchy. However, in recent\nyears, epistocracy has emerged as a major contender to\ndemocracy (Estlund 2003, 2007; Landemore 2012). A system is said to be\nepistocratic to the extent that the system formally allocates\npolitical power on the basis of knowledge or political competence. For\ninstance, an epistocracy might give university-educated citizens\nadditional votes (Mill 1861), exclude citizens from voting unless they\ncan pass a voter qualification exam, weigh votes by each voter\u2019s\ndegree of political knowledge while correcting for the influence of\ndemographic factors, or create panels of experts who have the right to\nveto democratic legislation (Caplan 2007; J. Brennan 2011b;\nL\u00f3pez-Guerra 2014; Mulligan 2015).\n\nArguments for epistocracy generally center on concerns about\ndemocratic incompetence. Epistocrats hold that democracy imbues\ncitizens with the right to vote in a promiscuous way. Ample empirical\nresearch has shown that the mean, median, and modal levels of basic\npolitical knowledge (let alone social scientific knowledge) among\ncitizens is extremely low (Somin 2013; Caplan 2007; Delli Carpini and\nKeeter 1996). Further, political knowledge makes a significant\ndifference in how citizens vote and what policies they support\n(Althaus 1998, 2003; Caplan 2007; Gilens 2012). Epistocrats believe\nthat restricting or weighting votes would protect against some of the\ndownsides of democratic incompetence. \n\nOne argument for epistocracy is that the legitimacy of political\ndecisions depends upon them being made competently and in good faith.\nConsider, as an analogy: In a criminal trial, the jury\u2019s\ndecision is high stakes; their decision can remove a person\u2019s\nrights or greatly harm their life, liberty, welfare, or property. If a\njury made its decision out of ignorance, malice, whimsy, or on the\nbasis of irrational and biased thought processes, we arguably should\nnot and probably would not regard the jury\u2019s decision as\nauthoritative or legitimate. Instead, we think the criminal has a\nright to a trial conducted by competent people in good faith. In many\nrespects, electoral decisions are similar to jury decisions: they also\nare high stakes, and can result in innocent people losing their lives,\nliberty, welfare, or property. If the legitimacy and authority of a\njury decision depends upon the jury making a competent decision in\ngood faith, then perhaps so should the legitimacy and authority of\nmost other governmental decisions, including the decisions that\nelectorates and their representatives make. Now, suppose, in light of\nwidespread voter ignorance and irrationality, it turns out that\ndemocratic electorates tend to make incompetent decisions. If so, then\nthis seems to provide at least presumptive grounds for favoring\nepistocracy over democracy (J. Brennan 2011b). \n\nSome dispute whether epistocracy would in fact perform better than\ndemocracy, even in principle. Epistocracy generally attempts to\ngenerate better political outcomes by in some way raising the average\nreliability of political decision-makers. Political scientists Lu Hong\nand Scott Page (2004) adduced a mathematical theorem showing that\nunder the right conditions, cognitive diversity among the participants\nin a collective decision more strongly contributes to the group making\na smart decision than does increasing the individual\nparticipants\u2019 reliability. On the Hong-Page theorem, it is\npossible that having a large number of diverse but unreliable\ndecision-makers in a collective decision will outperform having a\nsmaller number of less diverse but more reliable decision-makers.\nThere is some debate over whether the Hong-Page theorem has any\nmathematical substance (Thompson 2014 claims it does not), whether\nreal-world political decisions meet the conditions of the theorem, and\nif so, to what extent that justifies universal suffrage, or merely\nshows that having widespread but restricted suffrage is superior to\nhaving highly restricted suffrage (Landemore 2012; Somin 2013:\n113\u20135).\n\nRelatedly, Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem holds that under the right\nconditions, provided the average voter is reliable, as more and more\nvoters are added to a collective decision, the probability that the\ndemocracy will make the right choice approaches 1 (List and Goodin\n2001). However, assuming the theorem applies to real-life democratic\ndecisions, whether the theorem supports or condemns democracy depends\non how reliable voters are. If voters do systematically worse than\nchance (e.g., Althaus 2003; Caplan 2007), then the theorem instead\nimplies that large democracies almost always make the wrong\nchoice.\n\nOne worry about certain forms of epistocracy, such as a system in\nwhich voters must earn the right to vote by passing an examination, is\nthat such systems might make decisions that are biased toward members\nof certain demographic groups. After all, political knowledge is not\nevenly dispersed among all demographic groups. (At the very least, the\nkinds of knowledge political scientists have been studying are not\nevenly distributed. Whether other kinds of knowledge are better\ndistributed is an open question.) On average, in the United States, on\nmeasures of basic political knowledge, whites know more than blacks,\npeople in the Northeast know more than people in the South, men know\nmore than women, middle-aged people know more than the young or old,\nand high-income people know more than the poor (Delli Carpini and\nKeeter 1996: 137\u2013177). If such a voter examination system were\nimplemented, the resulting electorate would be whiter, maler, richer,\nmore middle-aged, and better employed than the population at large.\nDemocrats might reasonably worry that for this very reason an\nepistocracy would not take the interests of non-whites, women, the\npoor, or the unemployed into proper consideration. \n\nHowever, at least one form of epistocracy may be able to avoid this\nobjection. Consider, for instance, the \u201cenfranchisement\nlottery\u201d: \n\nThe enfranchisement lottery consists of two devices. First, there\nwould be a sortition to disenfranchise the vast majority of the\npopulation. Prior to every election, all but a random sample of the\npublic would be excluded. I call this device the exclusionary\nsortition because it merely tells us who will not be entitled to vote\nin a given contest. Indeed, those who survive the sortition (the\npre-voters) would not be automatically enfranchised. Like everyone in\nthe larger group from which they are drawn, pre-voters would be\nassumed to be insufficiently competent to vote. This is where the\nsecond device comes in. To finally become enfranchised and vote,\npre-voters would gather in relatively small groups to participate in a\ncompetence-building process carefully designed to optimize their\nknowledge about the alternatives on the ballot. (L\u00f3pez-Guerra\n2014: 4; cf. Ackerman and Fishkin 2005)\n\n\nUnder this scheme, no one has any presumptive right to vote. Instead,\neveryone has, by default, equal eligibility to be selected to become a\nvoter. Before the enfranchisement lottery takes place, candidates\nwould proceed with their campaigns as they do in democracy. However,\nthey campaign without knowing which citizens in particular will\neventually acquire the right to vote. Immediately before the election,\na random but representative subset of citizens is then selected by\nlottery. These citizens are not automatically granted the right to\nvote. Instead, the chosen citizens merely acquire permission to earn\nthe right to vote. To earn this right, they must then participate in\nsome sort of competence-building exercise, such as studying party\nplatforms or meeting in a deliberative forum with one another. In\npractice this system might suffer corruption or abuse, but,\nepistocrats respond, so does democracy in practice. For epistocrats,\nthe question is which system works better, i.e., produces the best or\nmost substantively just outcomes, all things considered.\n\nOne important deontological objection to epistocracy is that it may be\nincompatible with public reason liberalism (Estlund 2007). Public\nreason liberals hold that distribution of coercive political power is\nlegitimate and authoritative only if all reasonable people subject to\nthat power have strong enough grounds to endorse a justification for\nthat power (Vallier and D\u2019Agostino 2013). By definition,\nepistocracy imbues some citizens with greater power than others on the\ngrounds that these citizens have greater social scientific knowledge.\nHowever, the objection goes, reasonable people could disagree about\njust what counts as expertise and just who the experts are. If\nreasonable people disagree about what counts as expertise and who the\nexperts are, then epistocracy distributes political power on terms not\nall reasonable people have conclusive grounds to endorse. Epistocracy\nthus distributes political power on terms not all reasonable people\nhave conclusive grounds to endorse.
