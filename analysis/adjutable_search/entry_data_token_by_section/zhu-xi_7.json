Complementarity between li and qi, and among related terms\n\nRecognizing li and qi as complements serves to\nunderscore their unity in difference and their implicatedness in not\njust the forms but in the flow of events comprising the\n world.[18]\n This complementary relationship, moreover, underscores the basic\nholism and power of Zhu\u2019s thought regarding the formation of the\nworld and things.\n\nZhu Xi was inspired by Cheng Hao\u2019s formulation of the principle\nof complementarity, which he placed prominently in sec. 1 of the authoritative\nNeo-Confucian anthology, Reflections on Things at Hand (par.\n25):\n\n\nMaster Cheng Hao said: The li of heaven, earth and the myriad\nthings is that nothing exists in isolation; everything certainly has\nits opposite/complement. This is spontaneously so and not artificially\narranged. When I reflect on this truth late at night, I feel delighted\nas if my hands were waving and my feet were dancing. (based on Chan\n1967, edited) \n\nZhu Xi regarded this complementary pattern as describing the most\nfundamental ordering tendency of cosmos, phenomena, and self. Notably,\nthis is li (pattern) in a new sense, now more as a\npattern of creative intercourse than just as inherent\npatterning or order. It generalizes the significance of\ntaiji, though it prima facie lacks\ntaiji\u2019s insistent implication of li into\nqi intercourse and derived phenomena. Zhu remarks that Cheng\nHao felt delighted about his insight into this li\nbecause,\n\n\nOnce he had grasped deeply the truth that, \u201cnothing exists in\nisolation but certainly has its opposite/complement,\u201d it seemed\nto him marvelous and joyous. (based on Chan 1967, edited) \n\n\nZhuzi yulei (Classified Dialogues of Master Zhu),\njuan 95, contains Zhu\u2019s discussions with students on\nthis Cheng Hao quotation. As mentioned, Zhu usually construes this as\na li pattern underlying the complementary relationships among\nqi phenomena, which li itself transcends, hence\nimplying a vertical bifurcation between li and qi.\nWhen a disciple asks Zhu whether the complements have to be\n\u201cthings\u201d or whether, \u201cLi too could have a\ncomplement?\u201d The Master replies,\n\n\nAs to the categories of above and below, small and great, clear and\nturbid, they also pertain to things. But, if we were to say,\n\u201chaving the above, there must be the below; having the large,\nthere must be the small\u201d, that would be purely a matter of\nli, that is to say it has to be like this, as a sort\nof logical necessity. For example, in nature\u2019s production of\nthings, there cannot only be yin, there must also be\nyang; there cannot only be yang, there must also be\nyin. These [yin and yang] are mutual\ncomplements. The contexts of these complements are not themselves\ncomplementary li. Rather, the li are the very reason\nby which there are these complements. (trans. by the author)\n\n\nZhu also applies this li pattern creatively to number,\nspeech, objects, and games. According to this pattern, \u201cOne\ncomplements two\u201d, \u201cabove forms\u201d complements\n\u201cwithin forms\u201d. Any word will bear its semantic complement\nwithin.[19]\nAnd, this object before your eyes has its complements of back, front,\ntop, and bottom. Moreover, each side has its complement\u2026. Any\nsingle thing bears its complement\nwithin.[20]\nFor example, the paths on a checkerboard form series of complementary\npairs. In the end, when only one path remains open and it seems that\nno other complement remains, this very path still complements the 360\nother\n paths.[21] \n This is called a \u2018one-many\ncomplement\u2019, like the \u2018Way-implement complement\u2019\n(Zhuzi yulei, juan 95).\n\nAt the same time, Zhu hesitates to accept that li and\nqi themselves are complementary, but this primarily reflects\nhis ethical\n concerns.[22]\n On the ontological side, he eventually does affirm that li\nand qi are complementary by saying:\n\n\nAs to what would be the complement of taiji, it is said that\ntaiji is wuji (free of polarity)\u2026.\nTaiji also complements yin-yang\u2026. [Regarding]\nthe Way above forms and\u2026 utensil within forms\u2026 these are\n\u2018horizontal oppositions\u2019\u2026. (trans. by the\nauthor)\n\n\nThis is just like,\n\n\nHaving the tranquility of the pre-aroused emotions of pleasure and\nanger, grief and joy, there is the harmony of these emotions when\naroused in due degree. (trans. by the author) \n\n\nTaiji and wuji are opposed, apparently\ncontradictory, expressions. Signifying the most basic complementarity,\nnamely, that between yin and yang, taiji is\nthe most primitive and original form of li. It is\nquintessential li, or elementary form (patterning).\nSignifying something unbounded and free of polarity, wuji\ndescribes the unformed primal qi whence yin and\nyang emerge through the taiji impulse. It is\nquintessential qi, pure potentiality. Hence, Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s proposition, \u201cWuji er taiji\u201d (Free\nfrom polarity, and yet the supreme polarity), expresses the identity\nof opposites (li and qi) that gives rise to the\ninitial impulse of\n phenomena.[23]\n In the next step of this impulse, yin and yang are\nformed. They complement taiji as pure energy to pure form,\nthus expressing another dimension of the li-qi\ncomplementarity.\n\nAlthough the distinction between \u201cabove forms\u201d and\n\u201cwithin forms\u201d does not strictly mark the distinction\nbetween li and qi; nevertheless, as the way is\ncorrelated with li, and implement is embodied qi,\ntheir \u201chorizontal complementarity\u201d implies a\nsimilar pattern for li and qi. Strikingly, whereas\nthose who take this above-below forms distinction as\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d would have to\ndescribe the opposition as \u201cvertical\u201d, Zhu says\nplainly that it is horizontal, thus imputing a closer, more\ninteractive relationship between these complements than could obtain\nhad their relationship been strictly vertical.\n\nA final reason why Zhu Xi\u2019s ideas of li and qi\nought to be taken as horizontal and not vertical complements, that is,\nas a complex unity and not as a metaphysical duality, is found when\nZhu makes two seemingly contradictory claims about li and\nqi: (1) Li is prior to qi. 2) Li\nis not present apart from qi formations. Whereas 1) is\nusually regarded as a positive metaphysical claim, it means rather\nthat li in this sense refers to \u201cpermanent\npossibilities of qi formation\u201d. For example, for any\nparticular qi formation to have come about, it had to have\nbeen possible for the qi constituents to combine in that\nparticular way to yield those properties and\n capacities.[24]\n Whereas (2) is often taken to mean that li subsist until\ninstantiated, it means rather that li are the patterning of\nreal processes and things; they exist immanently in processes and\nthings, though they can be analyzed and discussed separately from\ntheir real contexts. This is why, methodologically, Zhu insists that\nlearners acquaint themselves with the li of things, processes,\naffairs, ethics, etc., by examining actual things, processes,\nphenomena, etc. He regards the study of li in abstraction\nfrom phenomena to be wooden, hollow, empty, etc. Hence, Zhu\u2019s\nclaims (1) and (2) and his methodological strategy all indicate that,\nfor him, the relation of complementarity between li and\nqi is essentially horizontal.\n\nThe \u201cli\u201d pattern in the Cheng Hao quotation thus\nturns out to be a \u201cmeta-li\u201d about the\ndynamic li-qi complements that originate and comprise the\nworld and its constituents, that is, as a second-order abstraction\nfrom the li and qi that are actually implicated in\nphenomena. Again, this meta-li confirms the basic unity and\ndynamism of Zhu\u2019s li-qi system. It reveals the pulse of\nlife at the heart of li and affirms the possibilities of form\nin the vagaries of qi movement. It enlivens Zhu\u2019s\nsystem and makes it flexible and conceptually adaptable to experience\nand thinking.\n\nWe may reflect that Zhu\u2019s original notion of li as\npattern involves restrictions that conflict with experience or\nexpression, so he reconfigures it in light of Zhou Dunyi\u2019s\nExplanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity and the\nCheng Hao\n quotation.[25]\n To work as intended, li has to tolerate and express\nsimultaneous assertions of \u201ccontradictory\u201d complementary\nterms. At the same time, this reconfiguration marks a step away from\nprimarily immanental aesthetic pattern of the li conception\nto a\n more\n abstract, more self-consciously meta-pattern.\n",
