Baumgarten and Meier: Aesthetics as the Analogue of Rational Cognition\n\n\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714\u20131762), as previously\nmentioned, introduced the term \u201caesthetics\u201d in his 1735\nthesis Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema\npertinentibus (\u201cPhilosophical meditations pertaining to\nsome matters concerning poetry\u201d). Baumgarten\u2019s new name for the\ndiscipline did not, however, signify a complete break with earlier\nphilosophical views, that is, with the perfectionist aesthetics of\nLeibniz and Wolff. By introducing the concept of \u201canalogue of\nreason\u201d Baumgarten did however make one key departure from the\nWolffian model that would eventually open the way for much more\nradical reconceptions of aesthetic experience in Germany; Baumgarten\nwould also introduce an emphasis on the emotional impact of art that\nis lacking in Wolff. But Baumgarten nevertheless remained more a Moses\nwho glimpsed the new theory from the shores of Wolffianism than a\nJoshua who conquered the new aesthetic territory.\n",
