    "main_text": "\n\n\nA.J. Ayer (1910\u20131989) was only 24 when he wrote the book that made his\nphilosophical name, Language, Truth, and Logic (hereafter\nLTL), published in 1936. In it he put forward what were\nunderstood to be the major theses of logical positivism, and so\nestablished himself as the leading English representative of the\nmovement, Viennese in origin. In endorsing these views Ayer saw\nhimself as continuing in the line of British empiricism established by\nJohn Locke and David Hume, an empiricism whose most recent\nrepresentative was Bertrand Russell. Throughout his subsequent career\nhe remained true to this tradition\u2019s rejection of the\npossibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, and so he saw\nthe method of philosophy to be the analysis of the meaning of key\nterms, such as \u2018causality\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019,\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019, and so on. The major\nportion of his work was devoted to exploring different facets of our\nclaims to knowledge, particularly perceptual knowledge and knowledge\nthat depended on inductive inference for its credence. Along the way\nhe defended a \u2018justified true belief\u2019 account of\nknowledge, a Humean account of causation, and compatibilism with\nrespect to freedom.  In\nLTL he put forward an emotivist theory of ethics, one that he\nnever abandoned.\n\nAyer always wrote with stylish crispness and clarity; he could lay\nbare the bones of a philosophical difficulty in a few paragraphs of\nstrikingly simple prose. On many a philosophical problem Ayer cannot\nbe bettered for providing a lucid, informative, and revealing\ndescription of its contours. Above all, on reading an essay of his,\nwhether it be on basic propositions, sense data, induction, or\nfreedom, one comes away recognizing that the aim of the author has\nbeen to reach the truth, no matter what that turned out to be.\nUnfortunately, he sometimes rushed to reach it, which, together with\nthe directness of his style, gave him a reputation for mere cleverness\nthat he never lived down. Nevertheless, amongst British philosophers\nof the 20th Century he has been ranked as second only to\nRussell (Foster 1985); P.F. Strawson, at his memorial service, stated\nthat his contribution to the theory of knowledge and general\nmetaphysics was \u201cin no way inferior to Russell\u2019s\u201d\n(see Rogers 1999, 358).\n",
