    "main_text": "Zombies and physicalism\n2. Zombies and physicalism\n\nA metaphor of Saul Kripke\u2019s helps to show how the zombie idea\nthreatens physicalism (Kripke 1972/80, 153f.). Imagine God creating\nthe world and deciding to bring into existence the whole of the purely\nphysical universe. Having created this physical universe, did he have\nto do any more work to provide for consciousness? Answering yes to\nthis question implies there is more to consciousness than the physical\nfacts alone can supply. If nothing else, it implies that consciousness\ndepends at least partly on nonphysical properties, ones that would not\nexist in a purely physical world; it would be a zombie world.\nPhysicalists, on the other hand, are committed to answering no. They\nhave to say that by fixing the purely physical facts, God did\neverything necessary to fix the mental facts about the organisms\nthereby created, including their thoughts, feelings, emotions, and\nexperiences. In other words, it seems that physicalists must say that\nin some sense the purely physical truths entail the mental truths\n(Kirk 1974a, 1974b argued that physicalism requires an\n\u2018Entailment Thesis\u2019 to that effect). If indeed fixing the\nphysical facts alone is enough to fix the mental facts, then a zombie\nworld is impossible. \n\nNot everyone agrees that physicalism entails the impossibility of\nzombies. One suggestion is that physicalists can concede there are\npossible worlds which are exact duplicates of our world in all purely\nphysical respects, but where the physical properties which give rise\nto consciousness in our world are prevented from doing so by\nnonphysical items which block consciousness. That would let\nphysicalists consistently allow the possibility of zombie worlds\n(Leuenberger 2008. On such \u2018blockers\u2019 see Hawthorne 2002b;\nChalmers 2010, 163\u2013165). This approach, however, is inconsistent\nwith maintaining that actual conscious states are either identical\nwith or constituted by physical or functional states. If my conscious\nstate is the same as or constituted by a physical state, then there is\nno possible world where the latter exists without the former. It is\ntherefore not clear that physicalists can consistently allow the\npossibility of consciousness-blockers. Lei Zhong 2021 takes a very\ndifferent approach, challenging the widely held view that physicalism\ncommits one to the supervenience of the mental on the physical. \n\nBut what kind of impossibility is relevant here? Physicalists cannot\njust say zombies are ruled out by the laws of nature, since even\ndualists can agree they are impossible in that sense: that it is by\nnomological necessity that the physical facts about us bring\nconsciousness with them. Physicalism therefore needs something\nstronger. \n\nTwo further kinds of necessity are usually considered: logical and\nmetaphysical. Now, many philosophers (largely influenced by the zombie\nidea) believe the connection from physical facts to consciousness\ncannot be logical even in a broad sense. And certainly the conceptual\nscheme of physics does not appear to leave room for logical\nlinks from physical to phenomenal (see e.g. Kriegel 2011; Stoljar\n2006). However, some argue that nevertheless zombies are not really\nconceivable at all (Kirk 2005, 2008, 2013; Tye 2006); Kirk 2013 also\nmaintains that although the physical facts do not entail the truth\nabout conscious experience a priori, they nevertheless entail\nit by logical necessity. \n\nStill, many physicalists hold that what guarantees the impossibility\nof zombies is \u2018metaphysical\u2019 necessity. Typically they\nmaintain that states of phenomenal consciousness are identical with\nphysical states, and that these identities are necessary a posteriori\nas argued by Kripke (see e.g. McLaughlin 2005, and for criticism,\nStoljar 2000). But the vocabulary of possibility and necessity is\nslippery. For example there is disagreement over whether logical and\nmetaphysical possibility are different (section 3.1 below); when\nKripke (1972/80) writes of \u2018logical\u2019 and\n\u2018metaphysical\u2019 possibility he seems to use those words\ninterchangeably (Yablo 1999: 457n.), and some use\n\u2018logical\u2019 where others prefer \u2018conceptual\u2019\n(Chalmers 1999: 477); compare Latham 2000, 72f.).\n\nMany think that if the physical facts entail consciousness by\nmetaphysical necessity, then physicalists can maintain that even\nthough zombies are metaphysically impossible, they are still\nconceivable (Balog 2012; Loar 1990/97; McLaughlin 2005;\nSections 5.1, 5.2 below). To the contrary, Chalmers argues that\nconceivability actually entails metaphysical possibility. If he is\nright, then that popular brand of physicalism is mistaken. The\nso-called \u2018conceivability argument\u2019 for the possibility of\nzombies will provide a focus for discussing some of the main problems\nraised by the zombie idea.\n",
