    "main_text": "Time and Tense (1941; 1956)\n5. Time and Tense (1941; 1956)\n\n\u201cThe founding father of modern tense logic was J. N.\nFindlay\u201d, Arthur Prior wrote in 1967. \n\n\n[Findlay] said in a paper published in 1941 [1941b [1963]] that\n\u201cour conventions with regard to tenses are so well worked out\nthat we have practically the materials in them for a formal calculus.\n\u2026the calculus of tenses should have been included in the modern\ndevelopment of modal logics\u201d. (1967: 1)\n\n\nFindlay\u2019s commitment to tense logic in 1941 went beyond the\nannouncement of project for future logicians. He supplied in the\narticle a modal form for tensed statements, and laid down a few tense\nlogical \u201claws\u201d governing such.\n\nThe form of tensed statements, Findlay insisted, was modal, not\nvariable. It had been the custom of logicians previously to consider\ntensed statements as \u201cincomplete\u201d statements, like\nRussellian propositional functions, where the gap in the function was\nto be filled in by supplying a date. So\n\nArchduke Ferdinand was shot at Sarajevo\n\n\nwas considered incomplete, neither true nor false, until the verb was\nde-tensed and a date added to the statement:\n\nArchduke Ferdinand is assassinated on June 28, 1914\n\n\nBut adding a date does not tell us that the assassination has\nhappened. To preserve the temporal claim, Findlay suggested the modal\nform: \n\nPast (Archduke Ferdinand being assassinated)\n\n\nThe truth conditions of A and B differ. C is the correct translation\nof A. \n\nPrior claimed what is modalized by Findlay is a statement, but in\nFindlay\u2019s text it is more like an event description, symbolized\nby \u201cx\u201d. What is modalized is a mode of occurring.\nThree modal laws are suggested in the 1941 article:\n\nPresent (x) implies Present (Present (x)):\n\nWhat is present is presently present.\nFuture (Present x) implies Present (Future x):\n\nWhat will be present is presently future.\n(Past x) or (Present x) or (Future x) implies\nFuture (Past x):\n\nWhat is either past or present or future will be past. \n\n\nLaw III shows that Findlay has not excluded vacuous names for events.\nThe laws apply to non-occurring events. For example, what is never\nfuture, for example, is never past, in models with no earliest\nmoment.\n\nIt appears, then, that we have two different languages. In the first,\nverbs are tenseless but dated. In the second, verbs are tensed but\nundated. Do we need two languages? In the language with dates, we can\nmeasure that interval between two events, and compare it with the\ninterval between two other events. In a system of moving objects, we\ncan partially order the dates via the Special Theory of Relativity.\nWhy bother with the tensed system at all?\n\nIn \u201cAn Examination of Tenses\u201d (1956a), Findlay gives\nreasons for retaining the tensed system. The dated system implies a\n\u201cblock universe\u201d of events pinned at unchanging locations\nin space-time. But the essence of time is change. Furthermore, and\nmore interestingly, Findlay argues that a block universe cannot\nexplain the fact that we know so much more about the past than the\nfuture, and that this asymmetry is not inferable from the structure of\nspace-time or the laws relating events within it. (Findlay cites\nEhrenfels [1916] for noticing that all the basic laws of physics are\ntime symmetric.) Findlay proposes his own explanation of the\nasymmetry: collisions between particular substances changes their\nconfiguration, and these changes, or \u201ctraces\u201d provide\nevidence in the present for collisions in the past. (This explanation\nof temporal asymmetry via traces is distinct from claiming that the\ncollisions release heat and increase entropy, which would reduce\ntemporal asymmetry to principles of thermodynamics.) General\nprinciples are not involved, only the historical facts of particular\ncollisions when world lines criss-cross. Why are there no present\ntraces of the future events? Because future collision have not yet\noccurred.\n",
