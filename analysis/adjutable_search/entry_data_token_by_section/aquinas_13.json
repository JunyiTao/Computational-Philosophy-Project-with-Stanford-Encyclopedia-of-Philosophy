    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue Theory\n8.3 Virtue Theory\n\nThe theory of natural law gives us Aquinas\u2019s moral theory: it\nidentifies the foundations of ethics and frames the general contours\nof the moral law. For us to adhere to that law, however, it is not\nenough to trust to the light of intellect and our natural\ninclinations. Reliably moral agents must, in addition, cultivate the\nright sorts of virtuous dispositions. Accordingly, Aquinas develops a\ncomplex\n virtue ethics\n to frame his account of our moral psychology.\n\nThe virtues are a certain kind of psychological disposition\n(habitus): they are the perfections of those powers of the\nsoul that are under our voluntary control. Aquinas devotes roughly a\nquarter of the Summa theologiae\u2014mainly the\n2a2ae\u2014to his theory of the virtues, and also dedicates a series\nof disputed questions to the subject. He takes from Aristotle the\nfamiliar idea that it is through the repetition of certain kinds of\nactions that we acquire the virtues (as well, of course, as the\nvices): by acting honestly we acquire, over time, the virtue of\nhonesty. Less familiarly, he imposes a very high standard on what\ncounts as a virtue: it must be incapable of giving rise to an immoral\nact.\n\nTwo things are required for an act\u2019s perfection: first, the act\nmust be right; second, the [underlying] disposition must be incapable\nof being the source of a contrary act. For that which is the source of\ngood and bad acts cannot, of itself, be the perfect source of a good\nact. (Quest. on the Virtues in General 2c)\n\n\nThis is not to say that a person with the virtue of honesty cannot be\ndishonest. Just as virtues can be acquired through practice, so they\ncan be lost through the wrong kind of practice, and that loss must\nbegin somewhere. Still, in such a case, the dishonesty will not arise\nthrough the virtue. Any characterization of a virtue that would make\nits possession a mixed blessing would have failed to delimit a true\nvirtue.\n\nThe reason that the virtues are so important to Aquinas\u2019s ethics\nis that he thinks that we cannot, over time, act morally without them.\nHe highlights three reasons why moral activity requires the virtues\n(Quest. on the Virtues in General 1c):\n\nfor uniformity of action, avoiding unreliable vicissitudes;\nto be prompt in that action, rather than needing constantly to\ndeliberate;\nto take pleasure in the action, as a kind of second nature.\n\n\nThese are not meant to be necessary conditions on an act\u2019s\ngoodness, but Aquinas thinks they are required for a person\u2019s\nactions to count as wholly praiseworthy. In contrast to the effortful\ncalculations of a utilitarian striving to maximize the beneficial\nconsequences of every act, he thinks moral goodness requires a\ndispositional stability in our underlying psychology. And given\nmorality\u2019s ultimate basis in Aquinas\u2019s overarching theory\nof happiness, it should be no surprise that he thinks happiness, in\nthis life, consists in our acting through these virtues (ST\n1a2ae 5.5\u20136).\n\nAmong the many fine-grained distinctions that Aquinas makes between\nvarious virtues and vices, he treats as preeminent the traditional\nfour cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues. The cardinal\nvirtues are\n\nprudence: the perfection of the intellect\u2019s\n practical reasoning\n (ST 2a2ae 47\u201351);\njustice:\n the will\u2019s stable disposition to give to each individual what\nis due to him (ST 2a2ae 58);\nbravery: the strength of the irascible appetite in pursuing what\nis in accord with reason (ST 2a2ae 143);\ntemperance: the moderation of the concupiscible appetite with\nrespect to its desires that conflict with reason (ST 2a2ae\n141).\n\n\nUnlike some of his contemporaries, who argued that all the virtues\nshould be dispositions of the will (Kent 1995), Aquinas thinks that\neach of these four virtues perfects a different power of the soul.\nBravery and temperance, indeed, are not perfections of rational powers\nat all. They are, however, defined in terms of right reason, and this\nboth connects his virtue theory to the theory of natural law and helps\nto explain why the virtues cannot be the cause of immoral actions. The\nperson who is \u201cbrave\u201d in a foolhardy way would not\nstrictly count as brave. Deepening the connection between these\nvirtues and right reason is that Aquinas treats the intellectual\nvirtue of prudence (prudentia, or phron\u0113sis in\nGreek) as foundational to all the other cardinal virtues:\n\u201crightness and full goodness in all the other virtues comes from\nprudence\u201d (Quest. on the Virtues in General 6c; see\nWestberg 1994). Without prudence, none of the other virtues are\npossible. Conversely, prudence itself requires the proper disposition\nof our various appetitive powers. Accordingly, Aquinas endorses the\ntraditional doctrine of the unity of the virtues: one cannot have any\nof them without having all of them (ST 1a2ae 65.1).\n\nAlthough the four cardinal virtues, as their name suggests, have\nhistorically been given pride of place within philosophy, Aquinas\ngives greater preeminence to the theological virtues that Paul\ndescribes in 1 Corinthians 13:\n\nfaith: the intellectual disposition to assent to what is not\napparent (ST 2a2ae 1\u20137);\nhope: the will\u2019s dispositional confidence in achieving a\ngood that is difficult to obtain (ST 2a2ae 17\u201318);\ncharity: the will\u2019s disposition for perfect love\n(ST 2a2ae 23\u201327).\n\n\nFor these to count as theological virtues, rather than as\ngeneric dispositions, they must each be further defined as having God\nas their object. They must also be understood to be infused in us by\nGod, because the humanly attainable versions of these virtues are not\nsufficient for our moral perfection (ST 1a2ae 62.1). Indeed,\nfor similar reasons, moral perfection requires that even the cardinal\nvirtues be infused by God (ST 1a2ae 63.3). To receive the\nvirtues from God requires grace, which is something we can never fully\nmerit, and which God freely chooses to give or to withhold: \u201cno\nmatter how much someone prepares himself, he does not receive grace\nfrom God necessarily\u201d (ST 1a2ae 112.3sc). Only through\nthis grace, and the infused virtues it brings, can we achieve the\nperfect happiness that is our ultimate end. (On the cardinal virtues\nsee Hause 2007; Stump 2011.
