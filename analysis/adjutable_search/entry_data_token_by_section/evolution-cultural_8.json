    "main_text": "Looser Analogies || Cultural Systems\n5.3 Cultural Systems\n\nA more recent approach within the cultural evolutionary research\ncommunity\u2014albeit one with a lengthy pedigree outside that\ndomain\u2014examines cultural change through the lens of systems\nthinking (Buskell, Enquist, & Jansson 2019; Jansson et al. 2021).\nThis approach starts from an observation that there is a difference in\nhow cultural traits (in individuals and in groups) are acquired as\ncompared with biological traits: while the latter are largely\ninherited all at once (in a sexual species, at the moment of\nfertilization, say), cultural traits can be acquired over a protracted\nperiod of time. The sequential acquisition of cultural traits means\nthose acquired earlier in time can affect the acquisition of those\nencountered later.\n\nAcerbi, Enquist, and Ghirlanda (2009) illustrate the general idea of\nthe cultural systems approach with a model that explores the\ntransmission of traits that make individuals either \u201copen\u201d\nor \u201cconservative\u201d\u2014that is, open to acquiring new\ntraits, or happy to sit tight. As they suggest, a trait making one\n\u201cconservative\u201d could spread to \u201copen\u201d\nindividuals\u2014but the converse is not the case. Once an agent\nacquires the \u201cconservative\u201d trait, no new learning will\noccur. Expanding this line of thought, Jansson et al. (2021) argue for\nthe importance of cultural filters: collections of traits that\nregulate the attentiveness towards, evaluation of, and potential\nacceptance of novel traits. The general idea is that relations of\ncompatibility holding between already acquired traits will influence\nthe addition of new ones. Thus, idiosyncratic collections of traits\nand their respective compatibility profiles\u2014themselves the\nresult of the sequential acquisition of traits\u2014will modulate\ndownstream acquisition.\n\nThe systems approach is less overtly evolutionary than either\ndual-inheritance theory or cultural epidemiology. Proponents argue\nthat a systems approach provides a framework well-suited for\nformalizing and exploring the population level consequences of claims\nmade about culture in the humanities and social sciences. Yet given\nthe approach\u2019s similarity to longstanding network approaches in\nquantitative sociology (e.g., Axelrod 1997; Centola 2015; Goldberg\n& Stein 2018), one might rightly wonder\u2014at this point, what\nremains of the analogy between biology and culture?\n",
