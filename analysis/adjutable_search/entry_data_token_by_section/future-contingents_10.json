Richmond H. Thomason (1970, 1981, 1984) has formulated a\ntheory based on so-called supervaluations. According to this theory a\nproposition \\(p\\) is true at a moment \\(t\\) if and only if it is true\nat \\(t\\) for every chronicle \\(c\\) passing through \\(t\\), and a\nproposition \\(p\\) is false if and only if it is false for every\nchronicle \\(c\\) passing through \\(t\\). Formally speaking, we may again\nuse the Ock-function to recursively define truth at a moment \\(t\\) and\na chronicle \\(c\\). Then we may define truth at a moment of time by\nsupervaluating. This means that \\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\) if and only if\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) for all \\(c\\) with \\(t \\in c\\). Future contingent\npropositions will not meet that condition, nor will their negations,\nso they are considered neither true nor false. They are\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d in the sense that they lack\ntruth-values.\n\nThis theory allows the supervaluationist to reject (P3) and to accept\nfuture excluded middle, (P5), without accepting the idea of \u2018the\nthin red line\u2019 or \u201cthe true future\u201d. It should be\npointed out, however, that although this theory implies a rejection of\n(P3), it does in fact accept a related inference principle i.e., if\n\\(P(x)p\\) is true at a certain moment of time, \\(t\\), then \\(\\Box\nP(x)p\\) will also be true at \\(t\\).\n\nThomason has shown that the supervaluation theory can in fact meet\nsome of the basic challenges related to the future contingents. He has\nalso shown that the theory can be extended in such a way that it may\nalso incorporate deontic logic i.e., the logic of moral obligation\n(Thomason 1981, pp. 165 ff.). A crucial question for this approach is,\nhowever, whether the idea of truth-value gaps for future contingents\nis philosophically acceptable. In other words, is it acceptable that\nsome well-formed propositions simply lack truth-values?\n\nA distinctive feature of Thomason\u2019s theory is that the usual\ntruth-functional technique breaks down. For instance, if \\(F(1)p\\) is\na future contingent, then \\(F(1)p\\) and \\(F(1){\\sim}p\\) are both\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d, but the conjunction \\(F(1)p\n\\wedge F(1){\\sim}p\\) will be false and the\ndisjunction \\(F(1)p \\vee F(1){\\sim}p\\) will be\ntrue. It may be objected that it seems odd that a disjunction could be\ntrue when neither of the disjuncts is true, and a conjunction false\nwhen neither of the conjuncts is false.\n",
