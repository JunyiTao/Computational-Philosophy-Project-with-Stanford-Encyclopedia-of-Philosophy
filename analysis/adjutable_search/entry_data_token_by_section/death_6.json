    "main_text": "Death || Death and Suspended Vitality\n2.2 Death and Suspended Vitality\n\nThe loss of life account of death has been challenged by theorists who\nclaim that things whose vital activities are suspended are not alive\n(Feldman 1992, Christopher Belsaw 2009, Cody Gilmore 2013, and David\nDeGrazia 2014). When zygotes and embryos are frozen for later use in\nthe in vitro fertilization procedure, their vital activities are\nbrought to a stop, or very nearly so. The same goes for water bears\nthat are dehydrated, and for seeds and spores. It seems clear that the\nzygotes and water bears are not dead, since their vital activities can\neasily be restarted\u2014by warming the zygote or by wetting the\nwater bear. They are not dead, but are they alive? If we deny that\nthey are alive, presumably we would do so on the grounds that their\nvital activities are halted. If something\u2019s life can be ended by\nsuspending its vital activities without its dying, then we must reject\nthe loss of life account of death.\n\nHowever, the loss of life account is thoroughly established in\nordinary usage, and is easily reconciled with the possibility of\nsuspended vitality. In denying that frozen embryos are dead, it is\nclear that we mean to emphasize that they have not lost the\ncapacity to deploy their vital activities. When we say that\nsomething is dead, we mean to emphasize that this capacity\nhas been lost. Having used \u2018dead\u2019 to signal this\nloss, why would we want to use the word \u2018alive\u2019 to signal\nthe fact that something is making active use of its vital activities?\nOur best option is to use a pair of contrasting terms. We can use\n\u2018viable\u2019 to indicate that something has the capacity to\ndeploy vital activities and \u2018unviable\u2019 to indicate that it\nhas lost this capacity. When instead we are concerned about whether or\nnot something is engaging its vital activities, we can use different\ncontrasting terms, say \u2018vital\u2019 and \u2018nonvital\u2019,\nthe former to characterize something that is employing its capacity\nfor vital activities and the latter to characterize something that is\nnot making use of its capacity for vital activities. What seems\nrelatively uncontroversial is that being dead consists in unviability.\nTo retain the loss of life account, we have only to add that being\nalive consists in viability. We can then say that a frozen embryo is\nviable and hence alive despite its lack of vitality, and it will die\nif its life ends (it will die if it ceases to be viable). Of course,\nif we are willing to abandon the loss of life account, we could\ninstead use \u2018alive\u2019 to characterize something that is both\nviable and vital. We would then say that a frozen embryo is not alive\n(since it lacks vitality) but also that it is not dead (since it\nremains viable).\n",
