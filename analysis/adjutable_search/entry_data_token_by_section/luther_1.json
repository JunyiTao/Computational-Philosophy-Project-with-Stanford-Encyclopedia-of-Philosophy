Theology and Philosophy\n\nWhilst there is no doubt that Luther saw himself primarily as a\ntheologian, as we have seen his education also involved significant\nphilosophical aspects, whilst he engaged with philosophical issues and\ndebates throughout his career. Nonetheless, he was concerned to\ndemarcate clearly between the two disciplines, which for him also\ninvolved becoming clear about the limitations of reason in relation to\nmatters of faith. In some contexts, this led him to polemicizing\nagainst reason and philosophy (most notoriously in his assertion that\n\u201creason is the devil\u2019s whore\u201d as it \u201ccan do\nnothing else but slander and dishonour what God does and says\u201d\n(Against the Heavenly Prophets, 1525, WA 18:164/LW 40:175));\nbut as many would now argue, it would be wrong to take such remarks in\nisolation and out of context, and to thereby characterise his position\nas \u201cirrationalist\u201d in a broad sense. Rather, it would be\nmore accurate to say that he was keen to keep reason within its proper\nboundaries and under the right tutelage.\n\nOne text that brings out some of the complexities of Luther\u2019s\nposition on these issues is Disputatio de homine (\u201cThe\nDisputation Concerning Man\u201d, 1536). Comprising 40 theses, the\nfirst 9 present the view of human beings and our relation to the world\nproposed by \u201cphilosophy or human wisdom\u201d, which is then\ncontrasted with the view taken by theology (see Ebeling 1977, 1982,\n1989; but cf. White 1994: 60\u201381\nfor criticisms of Ebeling). The position of philosophy is not rejected\nentirely, but shown to be severely truncated in the light of theology.\nAccording to philosophy, a human being is an embodied animal equipped\nwith a reason that relies on sensations or experience; it thus\nconceives of us in merely mortal terms and in relation to the world\naround us. Luther agrees that in this context philosophy is right to\nview reason as \n\n\nthe most important and the highest in rank among all things and, in\ncomparison with other things of this life, the best and something\ndivine, \n\n\nfor in this realm \n\n\nit is the inventor and guide of all the arts, medicine, law, and of\nwhatever wisdom, power, virtue, and glory human beings possess in this\nlife. (1536, WA 39.I:175/LW 34:137) \n\n\nLuther thus also agrees that it is reason that makes the fundamental\ndifference between human beings and animals, by virtue of which we are\ngiven dominion over the latter, so that reason is \u201ca sun and a\nkind of god appointed to administer these things in this life\u201d\n(ibid.). And Luther also asserts that even after the Fall, God did not\ntake away this role for reason, but continued to uphold it, so in this\ncontext it remains a divine gift and a fundamental way in which we fit\ninto God\u2019s creation. Thus, set within a worldly arena, Luther\nhere and\n elsewhere[9]\n is happy to affirm the value and function of reason, and\nphilosophy\u2019s high estimate of its significance.\n\nHowever, Luther then goes on to argue that precisely because\nphilosophy is confined to reason that operates within empirical\n constraints,[10]\n and is unaided by revelation, faith, and scripture, it cannot hope to\ntell us the whole story about human beings and the world, for which\nthe extra resources available to theology are required, which can\nthereby put all this in relation to God and so define \u201cthe whole\nand perfect human being\u201d (1536, WA 39.I: 176/LW 34:138). This\nmeans that theology can not only treat God as fundamental in its\naccount of efficient and of final causes (as creator, and as the\nsource of eternal happiness and salvation respectively), but it also\nsees human beings in the light of the Fall and also of grace and\nsalvation, in a way that reason without theology cannot\nfathom\u2014and if it tries to do so, will distort in a fundamental\nway.\n\nA contemporary empiricist or naturalistic philosopher might have\nlittle cause to challenge Luther\u2019s assumptions concerning the\nnature of reason, and so accept this demarcation between philosophy\nand theology. However, a more rationalistic philosopher might question\nwhether Luther underestimates the a priori capacities of reason, thus\ngiving reason more of a role within the theological realm when it\ncomes to our knowledge of God. In response, Luther makes several\nrelated claims. First, while he does not reject such a priori\nknowledge altogether (which he takes to be innate), he stresses it is\nseverely limited, partly because it can only bring us a rather general\nknowledge of\n God,[11]\n and partly because it can never lead to the kind of certainty\nregarding God which can be found through faith and taking seriously\nhis promise to us, particularly when it comes to matters of\n salvation.[12]\n Second, he has theological reasons connected not just to the Fall\nitself but also to his conception of the \u201chiddenness\u201d of\nGod, to question the scope of such rational capacities, so that reason\nknows \u201cthat there is a God, but it does not know who or which is\nthe true God\u201d (Lectures on Jonah (1526, WA 19:206/LW\n19:54\u201355). Third, in attributing these capacities to ourselves,\nthere is the danger of a kind of theological pride which will\ndisastrously distort our proper relation to God. Fourth, to take\nreason to be capable of more than helping us navigate the world is to\nmisunderstand its function in our epistemic economy, an economy which\ncan ultimately be traced back to God\u2019s\n design.[13]\n Finally, and perhaps most importantly, reason must struggle to make\nsense of the sheer gratuitousness of God\u2019s forgiveness of our\nsins, which transcend its sense of justice and fairness, and will as a\nresult lead us to question and doubt that forgiveness, with disastrous\n consequences.[14]\n\nFor Luther, these limitations of reason can be felt within theology in\nthe kind of puzzlement and perplexity which reason feels when\nconfronted by the scriptures and faith, where such puzzlement combined\nwith an undue estimation of reason can lead to the overthrow of the\nlatter by the former. But viewed from Luther\u2019s perspective, this\nis clearly unwarranted, as within theology this puzzlement is\nprecisely to be expected and even predicted, given the hiddenness of\nGod on the one hand and the effects of the Fall on the other, as well\nas God\u2019s desire to humble\n us.[15]\n Luther is thus happy to revel in the apparently paradoxical nature of\nreligious belief, on some accounts going as far as accepting a\ndoctrine of \u201cdouble truth\u201d: namely that the same\nproposition might be true in theology and false in philosophy, and\nvice versa. That he held this view may seem supported by\nThesis 4 of the Disputation Concerning the Passage: \u201cThe\nWord Was Made Flesh\u201d (John 1:14)\u2019 of 1539, which\nstates: \n\n\nThe Sorbonne, the mother of errors, very badly laid down that the same\nthing is true in philosophy and in theology. (WA 39.2:3/LW 38:239)\n\n\n\nHowever, it is more commonly held that in making this claim, Luther\nhas something more moderate in mind, which is suggested by Thesis 1 of\nthis Disputation: \n\n\nAlthough the saying \u201cEvery truth is in agreement with every\nother truth\u201d is to be upheld, nevertheless, what is true in one\nfield of learning [professionibus] is not always true in\nother fields of learning. (ibid) \n\n\nThis can be interpreted as holding that realms of truth are diverse,\nin the sense that some truth can only be stated in certain fields but\nnot others, but nonetheless all truths are consonant with one another\n(see Gerrish 1962: 53\u20134; White 1994: Chapter 3; Dieter 2009; Luy\n2017: 15\u201316; and\nsee Bianchi 2008 for a history of this issue).\n\nNonetheless, even this more modest position means that Luther can\nclaim that there are truths in theology that philosophy cannot grasp\nor properly articulate in its own terms, and when it tries to do so,\nwill generate what in philosophy appear to be absurdities or\naporia\u2014such as the doctrine of the Trinity, or of the Eucharist,\nboth of which require different ways of thinking than is available to\nphilosophers, who can aspire to no more than \u201ccreaturely\nthought\u201d (The Promotions disputation of Erasmus\nAlberus, 1543, WA 39.2:254/Appendix to Bielfeldt, Mattox, &\nHinlicky 2008: 191\u2013197,\n 194).[16]\n It is in this context that Luther can speak of the language of\ntheology needing to be \u201cnew\u201d because it behaves\ndifferently from that of the \u201cold\u201d language of philosophy,\nthough not necessarily from the language of ordinary life, which can\nbe more flexible than that of philosophy in certain respects (cf.\nWhite 1994: 332\u201348,\nBielfeldt 2002b). Likewise, because the philosopher operates with\nformal systems of syllogistic logic, which do not sufficiently take\ninto account the special nature of the objects of faith, such logics\nwill also break down when dealing with theological\n matters.[17]\n To philosophy, these problems will wrongly suggest that theology is\nnonsensical or is grasping at falsehoods, while instead Luther argues\nit just highlights the limitations of philosophical concepts and\nmethods when dealing with the subject-matter of theology (see White\n1994 for more extensive\ndiscussion of these issues). As Luther puts it in Disputation\nConcerning the Passage: \u201cThe Word Was Made Flesh\u201d:\n\n\n\nSt. Ambrose has rightly said that the dialecticians have to give way\nwhere the apostolic fishermen are to be trusted. (1539, WA 39.2:4/LW\n38:239)\n\n\nHowever, having marked out a hierarchy between philosophy and theology\nin this manner, Luther does not entirely reject a role for reason\nwithin theology, when properly understood, and when thereby\nilluminated by faith so that it becomes \u201cright reason\u201d\n(recta\n ratio).[18]\n Thus, as Gerrish has argued in relation to Luther\u2019s famous\nstatement when asked to recant at the Diet of Worms, that he refused\nto do so unless \u201cconvinced by the testimony of Scripture or\nplain reason\u201d, Luther did not mean here to set up reason\nalongside scripture, but rather to accept the evidential\nauthority of rational inferences from it (Gerrish 1962:\n 24\u20135).[19]\n Likewise, while his doctrine of putting scripture first as the basis\nfor faith (sola scriptura) means he has a correspondingly dim\nview of theological debates carried out at a purely philosophical\nlevel, Luther nonetheless accepts the importance of reason to the\ninterpreter and translator of the scriptural texts such as himself.\nIndeed, part of his grounds for rejecting Erasmus\u2019s humanistic\nappeal to authority and tradition in matters of interpretation lies in\nLuther\u2019s confidence in the capacity of reason to make the Bible\nclear, when properly coupled with faith and the \u201cunderstanding\nof the heart\u201d (see Grosshans 2017: 15\u201317). However, Luther\nwas himself to face the challenge of those (such as the Anabaptists\nand the Sacramentarians at the Colloquy of Marburg in 1529) who\ninterpreted scripture in different ways, and for whom conscience\nguided by \u201cright reason\u201d was to counsel different\nresponses to such key passages as \u201cFor this is my body\u201d,\nleaving little agreed common ground on which to adjudicate these\ndisputes; some see this situation as ironically generating a kind of\nscepticism which is the very converse of the certainty which Luther\nhimself craved and claimed to make\n possible.[20]\n\nLuther\u2019s conception of the relation between theology and\nphilosophy, faith and reason, may also be seen to influence his\ncorresponding assessment of mysticism. On the one hand, against the\nperceived rationalism of the scholastics, Luther was clearly attracted\nto the need for inner experience, and spoke of achieving a kind of\nunion with or participation in God, while attaching great merit to\nsome writings in the mystical tradition, particularly the\nTheologia deutsch, a late fourteenth-century work which he\ndiscovered and twice edited, in 1516 and 1518, wrongly attributing it\nto Johann Tauler (c. 1300\u20131361), though it is influenced by the\nlatter\u2019s ideas. At the same time, Luther also distanced himself\nfrom mystical writers such as Dionysius, whose theology (like that of the so-called \u201cZwickau Prophets\u201d) he accused of making the mediating role for Christ redundant (cf. 1537, First Disputation Against the Antinomians, WA 39.1:389\u201391, translated in Sonntag (ed. and trans.), Only the Decalogue is Eternal, 55\u201357), while it is debatable whether\nLuther\u2019s emphasis on the authority of scripture is compatible\nwith a mystical approach (for further discussion, see Oberman 1992:\n126\u201354, and Leppin 2017b).\n",
