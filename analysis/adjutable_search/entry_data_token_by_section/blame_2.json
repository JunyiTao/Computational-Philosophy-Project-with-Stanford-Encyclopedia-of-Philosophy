    "main_text": "What is Blame? || Emotional Theories of Blame\n1.2 Emotional Theories of Blame\n\nDespite the fact that P. F. Strawson\u2019s \u201cFreedom and\nResentment\u201d (1962) contains little sustained discussion of blame\nas such, many take it to be the contemporary genesis of emotional\ntheories of blame. According to Strawson, our status as morally\nresponsible agents is grounded in the non-detached attitudes and\nemotions that are (in part) constitutive of ordinary interpersonal\nrelationships. Regarding others as morally responsible agents, for\nStrawson, is not a matter of judgment but of emotional response. (Note that according to cognitivist theories of the emotions, emotional\nstates are identified with a suite of judgments (Solomon 1993;\nNussbaum 2001). Thus, if the cognitivist theory of emotions were\ncorrect, there would be no fundamental difference between cognitive\nand emotional theories of blame. However, cognitivist theories of the\nemotions are very controversial, and so we will set this important\nquestion aside.)\n\nR. Jay Wallace (1994) has developed this idea into an account of\n\u201cholding responsible\u201d according to which we hold others\nmorally responsible just in case we experience resentment,\nindignation, or (in the self-regarding case) guilt as a response to\ntheir actions, or judge that such a response would be appropriate.\nThus, for Wallace, (a specific subset of) Strawson\u2019s \u201creactive\nattitudes\u201d are essentially implicated in the stance we take up\nwhen we hold others responsible. But though it is possible to take up\nthe stance of \u201cholding responsible\u201d without being\nemotionally exercised, Wallace stresses (and reiterates this in\nWallace 2011) that to actually blame an agent, one must be\nexercised emotionally. \n\nOf course, Strawson and Wallace are hardly alone in endorsing\nemotional theories of blame. While these \u201cStrawsonian\u201d\naccounts of blame focus on the reactive attitudes (particularly\nresentment, indignation, and guilt), other emotional theories of blame\nare more inclusive. Susan Wolf (2011), David Shoemaker (2015, 2017), and\nLeonhard Menges (2017), for example, defend accounts of blame that\nemphasize anger (in the case of Shoemaker, it\u2019s actually three\ndistinct species of anger). Similarly, Macalester Bell (2013a, 2013b)\nargues for a \u201chostile attitudes\u201d account of blame that\nincludes the attitude of contempt as a blaming attitude. Consequently,\nwhat holds emotional theories of blame together is not widespread\nagreement over which emotions constitute blame. Rather, it is a shared\ncommitment to thinking that to blame is to respond to others\u2019 actions\nwith a negative emotion.\n\nThough it\u2019s very plausible that we blame others by responding to their\nactions with anger, resentment, indignation, or even contempt, there\nare a number of objections to emotional theories of blame. George Sher\n(2006) argues that emotional responses are unnecessary for blame. For\nexample, Sher argues that we can blame a loved one without feeling\nnegative emotional reactions. So too, we can blame villains from whom\nwe are temporally distant without any emotional response. The thought\nhere is simply that it is possible to blame Nero for the burning of\nRome, even though we do not feel any resentment or indignation towards\nNero for his cruelty. In response, defenders of emotional theories\nmight simply argue that despite appearances, without the emotions, one\nis simply not blaming Nero but instead merely judging blameworthy (see\nWallace 1994, 2011). Alternatively, a defender of emotional theories\ncould argue (plausibly, but by no means uncontroversially) that one\ncan be in an emotional state even if one does not experience any felt\naffect.\n\nA second objection to emotional theories of blame might be called the\n\u201cforce objection\u201d. Pamela Hieronymi develops this\nobjection by noting that\n\n\nan affective accompaniment of a judgment would be a certain unpleasant\nemotional disturbance \u2026 but, the force of blame seems deeper, more\nserious or weightier (Hieronymi 2004: 121).\n\n\nThus, in Hieronymi\u2019s view, the normative force of blame must be grounded in the cognitive\nelements of blaming emotions, since it is these elements that are\nresponsive to and reflect our concern for morality. But if the force\nof blame is grounded in the cognitive elements of the emotion, then\nwhy wouldn\u2019t a judgment with the same content constitute an instance\nof blame? It seems that while emotions might be concomitant with\nblame, it is the cognitive element\u2014one that can be present even\nif the blamer is not emotionally exercised\u2014and not the emotion\nitself that constitutes one\u2019s blame. In response to this sort of\nobjection, Wallace (2011) has argued that the reactive emotions are\nnot superfluous add-ons to the judgment, but instead they serve to\nchange the meaning of the judgment, imbuing the judgment with the sort\nof expressive significance that is characteristic of blame and that\nwould otherwise be lacking from a mere judgment.\n\nMore recently, Miranda Fricker (2016) has argued that our blaming\npractices evince too much internal diversity to be so neatly\nidentified with the narrow set of attitudes that emotion theorists\nfocus on. Because blame in one context can vary so significantly from\nblame in another context\u2014self-blame is different than direct\nsecond-personal blame, and each of these forms of blame is importantly\ndifferent than third-party blame\u2014there is very little that is\npresent in all instances of blame. And surely no specific emotional\nexperience will be present in all cases. In response to this, Leonhard\nMenges (2017) has claimed that there is actually less diversity in our\nblaming practices than Fricker supposes, and that to the degree there\nis any diversity in how we blame, it does nothing to undermine the\nrationale for emotional accounts of blame.\n",
