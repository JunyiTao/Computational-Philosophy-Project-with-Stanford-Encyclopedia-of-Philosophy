In the context of the\nmeasurement problem, imprecision seems to be a defect of the theory\nwhich impedes the exact determination of the theoretical quantities.\nHowever, imprecision and non-uniqueness is crucial in the context of\nevolution of theories and the transition to new and\n\u201cbetter\u201d theories. Otherwise the new theory could in\ngeneral not encompass the successful applications of the old theory.\nConsider for example the transition of Kepler\u2019s theory of\nplanetary motion to Newton\u2019s and Einstein\u2019s theories:\nNewtonian gravitation theory and general relativity replace the Kepler\nellipses with more complicated curves. But these should still be\nconsistent with the old astronomical observations, which is only\npossible if they don\u2019t fit exactly into Kepler\u2019s theory\n.\n",
