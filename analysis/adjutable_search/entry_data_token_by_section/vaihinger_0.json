    "main_text": "Brief Biography\n1. Brief Biography\n\n\nHans (born Johannes) Vaihinger\u2019s early life was in many ways\nthat of a typical intellectual in nineteenth-century Germany. Born on\n25 September 1852 near T\u00fcbingen, the son of the pastor Johann\nGeorg Vaihinger, Hans was intended for the clergy. He began his\nstudies in theology at the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1870, but,\nnever especially devout, he soon turned his attentions to other\nsubjects, primarily philosophy and natural science. Throughout the\nnext four years, Vaihinger\u2019s course of study emphasized the\nclassics of German philosophy\u2014Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel,\nand Schleiermacher\u2014but he also devoted himself intensely\nto the independent study of Schopenhauer and Darwin. In 1874,\nVaihinger completed his dissertation under the supervision of the\nlogician Christoph von Sigwart with a prize-winning essay,\nentitled Recent Theories of Consciousness according to their\nMetaphysical Foundation and their Significance for\nPsychology.\n\n\nLater in the same year, he reported to Leipzig for compulsory military\nservice, but was excused due to his poor eyesight. Free of his\nmilitary duties, Vaihinger had the opportunity to attend lectures at\nthe University from, among others, the founder of empirical psychology\nWilhelm Wundt. It was during this time that Vaihinger first\nencountered the work of a figure who, next to Kant, would be his most\nimportant and lasting philosophical influence, the Neo-Kantian\nFriedrich Lange. Vaihinger describes the impact\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism made on him as follows:\n\u201cNow at last I had found the man whom I had sought in vain\nduring those four years [at T\u00fcbingen]. I found a master, a guide,\nan ideal teacher\u2026 . All that I had striven for and aimed at\nstood before my eyes as a finished masterpiece. From this time onwards\nI called myself a disciple of F.A. Lange\u201d (PAO,\nxxi\u2013xxii).\n\n\nAfter a brief tenure in Leipzig, Vaihinger moved to Berlin, where he\ncontinued his studies with Hermann von Helmholtz and the Neo-Kantian\nEduard Zeller. In 1876, Vaihinger published his first work, an\nexposition and defense of Lange\u2019s brand of Neo-Kantianism,\nentitled Hartmann, D\u00fchring, and Lange: Towards a\nHistory of German Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century. It was\nhere that the views which would form the basis of the PAO\nfirst began to take shape. In autumn of the same year, Vaihinger again\nrelocated\u2014this time to the University of Strassburg\u2014and by\nearly 1877 he had habilitated with a work entitled Logical Studies\non Fictions. Part I: The Theory of Scientific Fictions. Though the\nPAO would not be published for more than 30 years, the\nLogical Studies is already, according to Vaihinger,\n\u201cexactly the same\u201d as Part I of the former work\n(PAO xxiii\u2013xxiv).\n\n\nThe extremely long gestation period of the PAO seems to\nhave been the product of a variety of factors. First and foremost,\nmonetary considerations compelled Vaihinger to find permanent academic\nemployment. To further his candidacy, Vaihinger decided to bring out a\nCommentary on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason in honor of\nthe centenary of the first Critique\u2019s publication. The\nfirst volume of the Commentary was released in 1881, and\nhelped Vaihinger secure a permanent position at the University of\nHalle. The second volume followed in 1892. A sense of the scholarly\ndepth of Vaihinger\u2019s work is given by the fact that the\ntwo-volume Commentary, which deals only with the\nKrV\u2019s Prefaces, Introductions, and Transcendental\nAesthetic, reaches nearly 1,100 pages. Moreover, a number of personal\nand professional engagements occupied Vaihinger in the last decade of\nthe century. In 1889 he married Elisabeth Schweigger, the daughter of\na Berlin bookseller. In 1892 they had a son, Richard, and in 1895 a\ndaughter, Erna. In 1896, he founded the journal Kant-Studien,\nand in 1901 the Kant Gesellschaft.\n\n\nFinally, in 1911, Vaihinger published the first edition of\nPAO. The work made him something like a philosophical\ncelebrity virtually overnight. It proved so popular that it had gone\nthrough no fewer than 10 editions by the time of his death in 1933,\nattracting the attention of luminaries from a wide variety of academic\nfields (including Einstein, Ostwald, and Freud). Halle even became\ninformally known as the \u201cVaihinger-Stadt\u201d (Vaihinger\ncity). The PAO\u2019s success enabled Vaihinger to found,\nin 1918, yet another journal, Annalen der Philosophie und\nphilosophischen Kritik, which dealt specifically with the themes\nbroached in the\nPAO, and included contributions from figures such as the\nmathematician Moritz Pasch, the embryologist Wilhelm Roux, and the\npositivist philosophers Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach. In 1930,\nCarnap and Reichenbach took over editorship of the Annalen and\nrenamed it Erkenntnis. \n\n\nThough this period of Vaihinger\u2019s life was marked by tremendous\nprofessional success, it was also a period of personal struggle. In\n1906, suffering badly from cataracts, Vaihinger was forced to\ndiscontinue his lecturing. Eventually, he was completely blinded. In\n1913, there occurred a rather bizarre incident: an anti-Semitic\npublication, the Semi-K\u00fcrschner, \u201caccused\u201d\nVaihinger of being a Jew. With anti-Semitism already on the rise in\nGermany, Vaihinger felt compelled to defend his reputation in court,\nand sued the publication for defamation. Though the\nSemi-K\u00fcrschner ultimately removed his name, the incident\nperhaps explains in part why his reputation would continue to suffer\nunder the Nazis. Additionally, Vaihinger had invested significant\nportions of his assets in Russia; the October Revolution, together with\nthe economic crisis after the First World War left him in dire\nfinancial straits, and he was forced to sell the bookstore he had\ninherited from Elisabeth\u2019s parents. Struggle turned to tragedy\nwhen, in 1918, Vaihinger\u2019s daughter Erna committed suicide. His\nson Richard also began suffering from neuropathy brought on by the war,\nand by 1929 he was completely incapacitated.\n\n\nVaihinger died in 1933, on the eve of the rise of the Third Reich. A\nlong-time liberal and pacifist, Vaihinger and his work were treated\nwith hostile silence throughout the Nazi period. A final, posthumous\ntragedy would thus befall him during these years: once among\nGermany\u2019s most celebrated and influential philosophers,\nVaihinger became a virtual nobody, and his works were quickly\nforgotten. Though contemporary philosophical literature reveals a\nrenewed interest in his ideas, it is fair to say that his reputation\nhas never fully recovered. For a more detailed treatment of\nVaihinger\u2019s biography, see (Simon 2014). Vaihinger himself\ndiscusses his intellectual development at length in his\nautobiographical (1921b) (also included as the introduction to\nC.K. Ogden\u2019s 1925 English translation of\nPAO).\n",
