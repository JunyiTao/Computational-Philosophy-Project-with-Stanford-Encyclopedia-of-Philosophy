    "main_text": "The Science of the Soul\n6. The Science of the Soul\n\n\nThe most influential section in the Aristotelian tradition, where the\nrelationship between the theoretical or speculative sciences is dealt\nwith, is the beginning of Aristotle\u2019s treatise On the Soul.\nAristotle gives two criteria for the hierarchy: the dignity of their\nsubject-matter and the exactness of their demonstrations. In his\nposthumous commentary on De anima Zabarella raises the\nquestion of the hierarchy of the sciences. In most cases, in\nZabarella\u2019s view, the science with a nobler subject-matter can be\nconsidered superior, but not always. All human knowledge can be\ncompared and there are no grounds for giving either of these criteria\nabsolute priority. In the contemplative sciences the nobility of the\nsubject-matter should be considered superior to the causality of\nknowledge. In logic, however, where the instruments of science are\nconsidered, the nobler instrument is the one that is more precise and\nproduces more certain knowledge.\n\n\nZabarella, then, did not give one decisive criterion according to\nwhich all arts and sciences could be arranged into one single\nhierarchy. However, when dealing with the place of the science of the\nsoul among the other sciences, Zabarella gives an description of the\nnobility of this part of natural philosophy. Zabarella opposed the\ndefinition of the science of the soul as a middle discipline between\nphysics and metaphysics. He states that Aristotle did not only wish to\ncompare the science of the soul with other sciences, but to compare it\nwith other parts of natural science. In Zabarella\u2019s view it is obvious\nthat the science of the soul is the most noble part of natural\nphilosophy, the king and emperor of every other part, which are all\ndependent upon it, because it shows the first cause and the sum of\neverything that is in animals and in plants. The science of the soul\nis more exquisite and certain than all the parts of natural\nphilosophy, because the causes of the science of the soul are more\nexact, not only to us, but also according to nature (Mikkeli 1997,\np. 220).\n\n\nZabarella\u2019s position here can be interpreted as an attempt to raise\nthe status of an independent natural philosophy by emphasizing the\nnobility of the science of the soul. In fact, it seems that he wanted\nto elevate the status of De anima to that of a special\nscience among other natural disciplines that is the noblest and most\nprecise of all natural sciences on which all the other parts of\nnatural philosophy could rely. What in the medieval times had perhaps\nbeen considered to be part of metaphysics was now the most valuable\npart of natural philosophy. Following the Alexandrian tradition,\nZabarella himself left the question of the immortality of the soul to\nthe theologians, because it did not belong to natural philosophy, and\nsince Aristotle, as a natural philosopher, had not been explicit about\nit (Kessler 2011, p. 52). It is, in fact, hard to be sure, whether\nZabarella himself thought that the soul was mortal. However, in his\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s treatise On the Soul Zabarella\ntried at least to prove that Aristotle himself did not consider it\nimmortal (Mitrovic 2009; Valverde 2012).\n\n\nZabarella reconstructed the process of intellection on the lines of\nsense-perception, that is that the intelligible species,\nproduced concurrently by the phantasma and the illuminating\nagent intellect, moved the possible intellect into cognition. To be\nknown, the phantasma, which was gained by sense-perception,\nhad to undergo a double process. Itself material and consequently\ncontaining the universal structure needed in science only in a\nconfused and unintelligible way, it had to be illuminated by the agent\nintellect, so that the universal in the individual was rendered\ndistinct and intelligible. Since the illumination was generally\nrequired for any act of knowledge in the same way, its agent did not\nhave to be an individual operating individually in the different acts\nof intellection, but rather could be an universal one, which rendered\nreality in general intelligible, thus serving as an all-embracing\nguarantee of intelligibility. The agent intellect could therefore be\nidentified with God himself as the principle of intelligibility. When\nidentifying the active intellect with God as the first cause of all\nthat exists and can be known, Zabarella has clearly in his mind that\nthe active intellect does no longer play a substantial role in this\nnaturalistic philosophy of nature after this initial act of intellection (Kessler 2011, pp. 56\u201357).\n\n\nTherefore with the metaphysical requirements of intellection taken for\ngranted, the main epistemological problem shifted to the manner in\nwhich the intelligible species was turned into a known\nobject.  Zabarella, considering the agent intellect as the divine\ncause of general intelligibility, could renounce innate principles and\nretain the Aristotelian teaching of the inductive acquisition of the\nfirst principles themselves. But Zabarella had instead the problem of\nrestoring to the human mind an active faculty which would account for\nthe act of judgement. Therefore he redefined the possible intellect as\nan active faculty as well. This equally active and passive human\nintellect (which Zabarella called patibilis instead of\npossibilis) considered all that was offered to it by the\nilluminated phantasma, contemplated whatever it wanted to,\nand in doing so selected and abstracted those structures it wished to\nknow and through judging understood them and became itself the object\nof knowledge. For Zabarella intellection therefore was not a process\nautomatically determined whenever an exterior impulse was given, but\nrather depended essentially on human will and intention. In\nZabarella\u2019s view, the science of the soul was concerned with what was\nnecessary and therefore always equally present in any human mind, even\nif unconsciously. Methodology, on the other hand, was concerned with\nthe use a human being made of these natural faculties. Since this use\ncould be true or false, better or worse, truth and error depended\nentirely on whether or not the correct method was being used (Kessler\n1988, pp. 530\u2013534).\n",
