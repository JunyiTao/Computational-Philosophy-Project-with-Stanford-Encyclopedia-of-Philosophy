    "main_text": "The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality\n3. The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality\n\nIt is widely held that ascriptions of irrationality involve a certain\nkind of criticism and, thus, that truths about rationality or\nirrationality are, or at least appear to be, normative or normatively\nsignificant (e.g. Parfit 2001; Kolodny 2005; Broome 2007b; Scanlon\n2007). A natural (and dominant) way to spell out this intuition is to\nsay that there necessarily are normative reasons to conform to\nrational requirements. But while it seems evident that there\nnecessarily are reasons to conform to substantive\nrequirements (at least on standard conceptions of substantive\nrationality), it is much less clear why this should be so in the case\nof structural requirements. In this section, we give an overview of\nthe most important challenges for the assumption that there\nnecessarily are reasons to conform to structural requirements and\ndiscuss the major theoretical options that one can adopt with respect\nto the normativity of rationality more generally.\n",
