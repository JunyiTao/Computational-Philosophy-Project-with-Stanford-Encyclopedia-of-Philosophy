    "main_text": "\n\nGeometrical knowledge typically concerns two kinds of things:\ntheoretical or abstract knowledge contained in the definitions,\naxioms, theorems, and proofs in a system of geometry; and some\nknowledge of the external world, such as is expressed in terms of a\nsystem of physical geometry. The nature of the relation between the\nabstract geometry and its practical expression has also to be\nconsidered.\n\nThis essay considers various theories of geometry, their grounds for\nintelligibility, for validity, and for physical interpretability in\nthe period largely before the advent of the theories of special and\ngeneral relativity in the 20th century. It turns out that a\ncomplicated interplay between two basic properties of lines, being\nshortest and being straightest, is at work in many stages.\n\nBefore the 19th century only one geometry was studied in\nany depth or thought to be an accurate or correct description of\nphysical space, and that was Euclidean geometry. The 19th\ncentury itself saw a profusion of new geometries, of which the most\nimportant were projective geometry and non-Euclidean or hyperbolic\ngeometry. Projective geometry can be thought of as a deepening of the\nnon-metrical and formal sides of Euclidean geometry; non-Euclidean\ngeometry as a challenge to its metrical aspects and implications.\n\nBy the opening years of the 20th century a variety of\nRiemannian differential geometries had been proposed, which made\nrigorous sense of non-Euclidean geometry. There were also significant\nadvances in the domain of abstract geometries, such as those proposed\nby David Hilbert. It follows that the terms \u2018geometry\u2019 and\n\u2018physical space\u2019 do not have simple meanings in the\n19th century, and changing conceptions of these terms do\nnot follow a simple pattern of refinement. Their inter-relations\ntherefore also have a complicated history.\n\nGeometry has been a school of systematic logical thinking, with\nEuclid\u2019s work taken to be the paradigm of a well-founded science\nfor millennia, but with a sudden change of views around 1900. It has\nalso been a place of privilege for the elaboration of mathematical\nmethods, from synthetic to analytic treatments, algebraic\ndevelopments, the rise of structuralism, and more. Contemplating the\ndevelopment of geometry through the ages, one can see how it started\nas the study of figures (and their measurement) to become the study of\nspace, and ended up being the study of spatial structures \u2013 from\nthe most basic topology, to n-manifolds, to the geometries\npicked up by physicists.\n\nAt the same time, geometry has posed fundamental epistemological\nproblems, and has been a decisive locus of philosophical debate. One\nmay quickly mention: 1, the problem of certainty and apriority of\ngeometric knowledge, linked to the question \u2013 one geometry, or\nmany? 2, the problem of the role of intuition (was Kant right? is the\naxiom of parallels intuitively grounded?) 3, the problem of\nidealization, concerning the relation between perfect geometric\nfigures and their real instantiations; 4, the shifting conceptions of\nthe interrelation between mathematics and natural science.\n",
