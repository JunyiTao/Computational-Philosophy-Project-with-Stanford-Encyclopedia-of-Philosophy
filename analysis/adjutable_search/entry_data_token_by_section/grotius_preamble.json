His work ranged over a wide array of topics, though he is\nbest known to philosophers today for his contributions to the natural\nlaw theories of normativity which emerged in the later medieval and\nearly modern periods. This article will attempt to explain his views\non the law of nature and related issues while simultaneously providing\nsome broader assessment of his place in the history of ideas.\n",
