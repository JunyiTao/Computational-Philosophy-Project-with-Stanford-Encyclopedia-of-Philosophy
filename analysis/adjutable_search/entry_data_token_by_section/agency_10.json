    "main_text": "The metaphysics of agency || Disappearing agents, naturalism, and dual standpoint theory\n3.3 Disappearing agents, naturalism, and dual standpoint theory\nSometimes it is suggested that the problem of deviant causal chains\nis merely a symptom of the deeper problem that event-causal theories\naltogether fail to capture agency, because they reduce actions to\nthings that merely happen to us (Lowe 2008: 9, for instance). Put\ndifferently, this challenge says that the event-causal framework is\ndeficient because it leaves out agents: all there is, on this view, is\na nexus of causal pushes and pulls in which no one does\nanything (Melden 1961; Nagel 1986; see also Velleman 1992). This\nhas been called the problem of the \u201cdisappearing agent\u201d\n(Mele 2003: Ch. 10; Lowe 2008: 159\u2013161; Steward 2013).\nAccording to Mele (2003: Ch. 10), some formulations of this\ndisappearing agent objection are easily dismissed. Some proponents of\nthis challenge use the terms \u2018event-causal order\u2019 and\n\u2018natural order\u2019 interchangeably. This would seem to\nsuggest that, on their view, agency is a supernatural\nphenomenon\u00ad\u2014a view that most contemporary philosophers find\nhard to take seriously. However, sometimes the challenge is raised in\norder to motivate alternative agent-causal or volitionist theories of\nagency, and the main proponents of agent-causal and volitionist\ntheories maintain that their views are compatible with\nnaturalism. They would argue that it is a mistake to presume that the\nevent-causal order exhausts the natural order of things.\nFurther, the disappearing agent objection is not always put forward\nas a general objection to the event-causal framework. As we have seen\n(section 2.3), Velleman (1992) argued\nthat the standard theory leaves out the agent, or the agent\u2019s\nparticipation, and he proposed a solution to this\nproblem within the event-causal framework. In his reply,\nMele (2003: Ch. 10) suggested that it would be more appropriate to\ncall this the problem of the \u201cshrinking agent\u201d. According to\nVelleman, the standard theory captures only deficient instances of\nagency, in which the agent\u2019s participation is\n\u201cunwitting\u201d or \u201chalfhearted\u201d. Instances of\ndeficient agency can be explained in terms of various capacities or\nproperties that the agent does not possess, exercise, or instantiate;\ncapacities and properties such as conscious awareness, reflective\nawareness, reason-responsiveness, self-control, self-governance, and\nso on. Given this, there is no need to conceptualize instances of\ndeficient agency in terms of the agent\u2019s absence. Further,\ndoing so creates a rather implausible dichotomy between a kind of\nagency in which the agent does participate and a kind of agency in\nwhich the agent does not participate (Schlosser 2010).\nOthers, yet, press the disappearing agent objection in order to\nmotivate a dual standpoint theory. According to dual standpoint\ntheories, agency cannot be explained from any theoretical standpoint\nor metaphysical framework. Agency can only be understood from a\npractical and normative standpoint (Nagel 1986; Korsgaard 1996;\nBilgrami 2006, for instance). Arguably, this view has its roots in\nKant\u2019s account of practical reason (see the entry on\nKant and Hume on morality). Usually, dual standpoint theories do not reject metaphysics as such,\nand they often provide a metaphysical framework of their own. But they\nreject both reductive and non-reductive theories of agency, and they\nreject, in general, the notion that we can have a metaphysical account\nof what the exercise of agency consists in. They align themselves\nnaturally with non-causal theories of reason explanation (see\nsection 2).\nBoth views tend to emphasize the normative and irreducibly\nteleological nature of reason explanation and, hence, agency. Dual\nstandpoint theories have received relatively little attention in the\nphilosophy of action. To many, it seems that such views are deeply\nunsatisfactory precisely because they refuse to face a central\nquestion in the metaphysics of agency: how can agents exercise control\nover their actions in a world in which all movements can be explained\nin terms of event-causation? It seems that this is in need of\nexplanation, and it seems that this requires a metaphysics of agency\n(see Bishop 1989; Schlosser 2010). Nelkin (2000) has questioned the\ncoherence of dual standpoint theories on the basis of an argument for\nthe claim that they entail commitments to contradictory beliefs about\nfree will.\n",
