    "main_text": "History of Cosmopolitanisms || Greek and Roman Cosmopolitanism\n1.1 Greek and Roman Cosmopolitanism\n\n\nThe political culture idealized in the writings of Plato and\nAristotle is not cosmopolitan. In this culture, a man identifies\nhimself first and foremost as a citizen of a particular polis or city,\nand in doing so, he signals which institutions and which body of people\nhold his allegiance. He would then be counted on for help in defending\nthe city from attacks, sustaining its institutions of justice, and\ncontributing to its common good. In this way, his own pursuit of a good\nlife is inextricably bound to the fate of the city and to the similar\npursuit carried out by other inhabitants of the city. By contrast, the\ngood person would not be expected to share with or serve any foreigners\nwho live outside the city. Any cosmopolitan expectations on a good\nAthenian extended only to concern for those foreigners who happen to\nreside in Athens.\n\n\nIt would, however, be wrong to assume that Classical Greek thought\nwas uniformly anti-cosmopolitan. Actively excluding foreigners\nfrom any ethical consideration or actively targeting foreigners for\nmistreatment goes one step beyond focusing one\u2019s service and\nconcern on compatriots, and in fact, the targeting of\n\u2018barbarians\u2019 is historically linked with the rise of\npanhellenism and not with the more narrow emphasis on the polis. It\nwould be more accurate to call the Classical emphasis on the polis\nuncosmopolitan.\n\n\nYet even as Plato and Aristotle were writing, other Greeks were\nissuing cosmopolitan challenges. Perhaps the most obvious challenges\ncame from the traveling intellectuals who insisted on the contrast\nbetween the conventional ties of politics and the natural ties of\nhumanity. Notice, for example, the way Plato has the Sophist Hippias\naddress the motley crew of Athenians and foreigners present at Callias\u2019\nhouse in Plato\u2019s Protagoras (337c7\u2013d3):\nGentlemen present \u2026 I regard you all as kinsmen,\nfamiliars, and fellow-citizens \u2013 by nature and not by\nconvention; for like is by nature akin to like, while convention,\nwhich is a tyrant over human beings, forces many things contrary to\nnature.\n\n\nSocrates, too, it can be argued, was sensitive to this more\ncosmopolitan identification with human beings as such. At least as\nPlato characterizes him, Socrates avoids traditional political\nengagement as much as he can, in favor of an extraordinary career of\nexamining himself and others, and he insists that these examinations\nare both genuinely political (Gorg 521d6\u20138) and extended to\nall, Athenians and foreigners alike (Apol 23b4\u20136, 30a3\u20137; cf. Eu. 3d5\u20139). Of course,\nSocrates chose not to travel widely, but this decision could well have\nbeen consistent with cosmopolitan ideals, for he may have thought that\nhis best bet for serving human beings generally lay in staying at\nhome, on account, ironically, of Athens\u2019 superior freedom of speech\n(Gorg 461e1\u20133; cf. Apol 37c5\u2013e2 and Meno\n80b4\u20137). Whether Socrates was self-consciously cosmopolitan in this\nway or not, there is no doubt that his ideas accelerated the\ndevelopment of cosmopolitanism and that he was in later antiquity\nembraced as a citizen of the world.\n\n\nIn fact, the first philosopher in\nthe West to give perfectly explicit expression to cosmopolitanism was\nthe Socratically inspired Cynic Diogenes in the fourth century BCE. It\nis said that \u201cwhen he was asked where he came from, he replied,\n\u2018I am a citizen of the world\n[kosmopolit\u00eas]\u2019\u201d (Diogenes Laertius VI 63).\nBy identifying himself not as a citizen of Sinope but as a citizen of\nthe world, Diogenes apparently refused to agree that he owed special\nservice to Sinope and the Sinopeans. So understood, \u2018I am a\ncitizen of the cosmos\u2019 is a negative claim, and we might wonder\nif there is any positive content to the Cynic\u2019s world citizenship. The\nmost natural suggestion would be that a world citizen should serve the\nworld-state, helping to bring it about in order to enable the later\nwork of sustaining its institutions and contributing to its common\ngood. But the historical record does not suggest that Diogenes the\nCynic favored the introduction of a world-state. In fact, the\nhistorical record does not unambiguously provide Diogenes any positive\ncommitments that we can readily understand as cosmopolitan. The best\nwe can do to find positive cosmopolitanism in Diogenes is to insist\nthat the whole Cynic way of life is supposed to be cosmopolitan: by\nliving in accordance with nature and rejecting what is conventional,\nthe Cynic sets an example of high-minded virtue for all other human\nbeings.\n\n\nA fuller exploration of positively committed philosophical\ncosmopolitanism arrives only with the Socratizing and Cynic-influenced\nStoics of the third century CE. These Stoics are fond of saying that\nthe cosmos is, as it were, a polis, because the cosmos is put in\nperfect order by law, which is right reason. They also embrace the\nnegative implication of their high standards: \nconventional poleis do not, strictly speaking, deserve the name, and human beings who are not wise and virtuous do not count as citizens of the cosmos. But\nthe Stoics do not believe that living in agreement with the cosmos \u2013\nas a (virtuous) citizen of the cosmos \u2013 requires maintaining critical distance\nfrom conventional poleis. Rather, as the traces of Chrysippus\u2019 On\nLives make clear, the Stoics believe that goodness requires\nserving other human beings as best one can,\nthat serving all human beings equally well is impossible, and that the\nbest service one can give typically requires political engagement. Of\ncourse, the Stoics recognize that political engagement will not be\npossible for everyone, and that some people will best be able to help\nother human beings as private teachers of virtue rather than as\npoliticians. But in no case, the Stoics insist, is consideration of\npolitical engagement to be limited to one\u2019s own polis. The motivating\nidea is, after all, to help human beings as such, and sometimes the\nbest way to do that is to serve as a teacher or as a political advisor\nin some foreign place. In this fashion, the Stoics introduce clear,\npractical content to their metaphor of the cosmopolis: a cosmopolitan\nconsiders moving away in order to serve, whereas a non-cosmopolitan\ndoes not.\n\n\nThis content admits of a strict and a more moderate interpretation.\nOn the strict view, when one considers whether to emigrate, one\nrecognizes prima facie no special or stronger reason to serve\ncompatriots than to serve a set of human beings abroad. On the moderate\nview, one does introduce into one\u2019s deliberations extra reason to serve\ncompatriots, although one might still, all things considered, make the\nbest choice by emigrating. The evidence does not permit a decisive\nattribution of one or the other of these interpretations to any of the\nearliest Stoics. But if we think that Chrysippus was deeply\nattracted to the Cynics\u2019 rejection of what is merely conventional, then\nwe will find it easy to think of him as a strict\ncosmopolitan.\n\n\nThings are a bit different for at least some of the Stoics at Rome.\nOn the one hand, the cosmopolis becomes less demanding. Whereas\nChrysippus limits citizenship in the cosmos to those who in fact live\nin agreement with the cosmos and its law, Roman Stoics extend\ncitizenship to all human beings by virtue of their rationality. On the\nother hand, local citizenship becomes more demanding. There is no\ndoubt that the Stoicism of Cicero\u2019s De Officiis or of\nSeneca\u2019s varied corpus explicitly acknowledges obligations to\nRome in addition to obligations to the cosmos. This is a moderate Stoic cosmopolitanism, and empire made the\ndoctrine very easy for many Romans by identifying the Roman\npatria with the cosmopolis itself. But neither imperialism\nnor a literal interpretation of world citizenship is required for the\nphilosophical point. The maximally committed cosmopolitan looks around\nto determine whom he can best help and how, knowing full well that he\ncannot help all people in just the same way, and his decision to help\nsome people far more than others is justified by cosmopolitan lights\nif it is the best he can do to help human beings as such.\n\n\nStoic cosmopolitanism in its various guises was enormously persuasive\nthroughout the Greco-Roman world. In part, this success can be\nexplained by noting how cosmopolitan the world at that time was.\nAlexander the Great\u2019s conquests and the subsequent division of his\nempire into successor kingdoms sapped local cities of much of their\ntraditional authority and fostered increased contacts between cities,\nand later, the rise of the Roman Empire united the whole of the\nMediterranean under one political power. But it is wrong to say what\nhas frequently been said, that cosmopolitanism arose as a\nresponse to the fall of the polis or to the rise of the Roman\nempire. First, the polis\u2019 fall has been greatly exaggerated. Under the\nsuccessor kingdoms and even \u2013 though to a lesser degree \u2013\nunder Rome, there remained substantial room for important political\nengagement locally. Second, and more decisively, the cosmopolitanism\nthat was so persuasive during the so-called Hellenistic Age and under\nthe Roman Empire was in fact rooted in intellectual developments that\npredate Alexander\u2019s conquests. Still, there is no doubting\nthat the empires under which Stoicism developed and flourished made\nmany people more receptive to the cosmopolitan ideal and thus\ncontributed greatly to the widespread influence of Stoic\ncosmopolitanism.\n\n\nNowhere was Stoic cosmopolitanism itself more influential than in\nearly Christianity. Early Christians took the later Stoic recognition\nof two cities as independent sources of obligation and added a twist.\nFor the Stoics, the citizens of the polis and the citizens of\nthe cosmopolis do the same work: both aim to improve the\nlives of the citizens. The Christians respond to a different call:\n\u201cRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s; and\nunto God the things that are God\u2019s\u201d (Matthew 22:21). On this\nview, the local city may have divine authority (John 19:11;\ncf. Romans 13:1,4,7), but the most important work for human\ngoodness is removed from traditional politics, set aside in a sphere in\nwhich people of all nations can become \u201cfellow-citizens with the\nsaints\u201d (Ephesians 2:20).\n\n\nThis development has two important and long-lasting consequences,\nwhich are canonized by Augustine. First, the cosmopolis again becomes a\ncommunity for certain people only. Augustine makes this point most\nexplicitly by limiting the citizenship in the city of God to those who\nlove God. All others are relegated to the inferior \u2013 though still\nuniversal \u2013 earthly city by their love of self. These two cities of\nthe world, which are doomed to coexist intertwined until the Final\nJudgment, divide the world\u2019s inhabitants. Second, the work of politics\nis severed from the task of building good human lives, lives of\nrighteousness and justice. While Augustine can stress that this allows\ncitizens in the city of God to obey local laws concerning \u201cthe\nnecessaries for the maintenance of life,\u201d he must also\nacknowledge that it sets up a potential conflict over the laws of\nreligion and the concerns of righteousness and justice (e.g.,\nCivitas Dei XIX 17).\n\n\nFor hundreds of years to come, debates in political philosophy would\nsurround the relation between \u2018temporal\u2019 political\nauthority and the \u2018eternal Church.\u2019 But emphasis on the\ncosmopolitan aspect of the Church waned, despite its ideal of a\nreligious community comprising all humans. In a nutshell, the debate\nnow opposed the secular and the religious, and not the local and the\ncosmopolitan. To be sure, this debate often had cosmopolitan\nramifications, which are clear enough in Dante Alighieri\u2019s plea for a\nuniversal monarchy in De Monarchia (ca. 1314).  But his case\ndraws from Aristotle and Roman history, not explicitly from the ideal\nof a cosmopolis or of world citizenship, and he remains deeply\nconcerned to adjudicate between the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n",
