    "main_text": "Symmetry Principles || C, P, T\n2.4 C, P, T\n\nBecause of the specific properties of the quantum description, the\ndiscrete symmetries of spatial reflection symmetry or parity\n(P) and time reversal (T) were\n\u201crediscovered\u201d in the quantum context, taking on a new\nsignificance. Parity was introduced in quantum physics in 1927 in a\npaper by Wigner, where important spectroscopic results were explained\nfor the first time on the basis of a group-theoretic treatment of\npermutation, rotation and reflection symmetries. Time reversal\ninvariance appeared in the quantum context, again due to Wigner, in a\n1932\n paper.[13]\n To these was added the new quantum particle-antiparticle symmetry or\ncharge conjugation (C). Charge conjugation was\nintroduced in Dirac\u2019s famous 1931 paper \u201cQuantized\nsingularities in the electromagnetic field\u201d.\n\nThe discrete symmetries C, P and T are\nconnected by the so-called CPT theorem, first proved by L\u00fcders\nand Pauli in the early 1950s, which states that the combination of\nC, P, and T is a general symmetry of\nLorentz-invariant physical laws. For philosophical reflections on the\nmeaning and grounding of the CPT theorem see Wallace (2009) and\nGreaves (2010). Greaves (2010) in particular argues that the\nquantization of the classical T operator leads to a CT operator, using\nthis in support of Feynman\u2019s famous suggestion that time reversal\nhas the effect of transforming particles into anti-particles. Roberts\n(2022, 2.8) argues against this claim, by maintaining that the\nFeynman\u2019s approach is an artifact that does not accurately capture the\ndescription of temporal symmetry. A discussion of the proofs of\nthe theorem, both within the standard quantum field theory framework\nand the axiomatic field theory framework, is provided in Greaves and\nThomas (2014).\n\nThe laws governing gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong\ninteraction are invariant with respect to C, P and\nT independently. However, in 1956 T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang\npointed out that \u03b2-decay, governed by the weak interaction, had\nnot yet been tested for invariance under P. Soon afterwards\nC. S. Wu and her colleagues performed an experiment showing that the\nweak interaction violates parity. Nevertheless, \u03b2-decay respects\nthe combination of C and P as a symmetry. In 1964,\nhowever, CP was found to be violated in weak interaction by\nCronin and Fitch in an experiment involving K-mesons. This implied, in\nvirtue of the CPT theorem, the violation of T-symmetry as\nwell; since then, there have been direct observations of\nT-symmetry violation, as reported by e.g., CPLEAR\nCollaboration (1998). For a careful analysis of the underlying\nassumptions working in the assessment of T-violation see\nRoberts (2015) and Ashtekar (2015). The philosophical puzzle is how we\ncan come to know this time asymmetry, given that we cannot truly\n\u2018reverse\u2019 time. Roberts proposes three templates for\nexplaining how this is possible, drawing in particular on a version of\nCurie\u2019s principle. By contrast, Go\u0142osz (2016) argues that\nthis asymmetry should be understood as applying to a physical process,\nrather than to time itself. Roberts (2022, Chapter 7) responds\nthat, on the Representation View, the asymmetry does indeed apply to\ntime itself.\n\nThis debate stems from the more basic question of what time\nreversal symmetry actually means. Some have argued that the textbook\ntime reversal operator T does not really represent the reversal\nof time alone, due to its unusual properties like conjugation of the\nwavefunction and the reversal of magnetic fields, including Albert\n(2000), Callender (2000), Lopez (2021, 2023). Others maintain,\ninstead, that the T operator is indeed the right definition of\ntime reversal, including Earman (2002), Malament (2004) and\nRoberts (2017). An ecumenical response is given by Roberts (2022,\nChapter 2), arguing that these two approaches can be viewed as the two\nsides of the same coin, corresponding, respectively, to a reversal of\ntime translations on spacetime and to the representation of that\nreversal on state space. A response in a similar spirit for\nelectromagnetism is given by Struyve (forthcoming). \n\nThe existence of parity violation in our fundamental laws has led to a\nnew chapter in an old philosophical debate concerning chiral or handed\nobjects and the nature of space. A description of a left hand and one\nof a right hand will not differ so long as no appeal is made to\nanything beyond the relevant hand. Yet left and right hands do\ndiffer  \u2014 a left-handed glove will not fit on a right hand.\nFor a brief period,  Kant saw in this reason to prefer a\nsubstantivalist account of space over a relational one, the difference\nbetween left and right hands lying in their relation to absolute\nspace. Regardless of whether this substantivalist solution succeeds,\nthere remains the challenge to the relationalist of accounting for the\ndifference between what Kant called \u201cincongruent\ncounterparts\u201d \u2014 objects which are the mirror-image of one\nanother and yet cannot be made to coincide by any rigid motion. The\nrelationalist may respond by denying that there is any\nintrinsic difference between a left and a right hand, and\nthat the incongruence is to be accounted for in terms of the relations\nbetween the two hands (if a universe was created with only one hand in\nit, it would be neither left nor right, but the second hand to be\ncreated would be either incongruent or congruent with it). This\nresponse becomes problematic in the face of parity violation, where\none possible experimental outcome is much more likely than its\nmirror-image. Since the two possible outcomes don\u2019t differ\nintrinsically, how should we account for the imbalance? This issue\ncontinues to be discussed in the context of the\nsubstantivalist-relationalist debate. For further details see Pooley\n(2003) and Saunders (2007).\n",
