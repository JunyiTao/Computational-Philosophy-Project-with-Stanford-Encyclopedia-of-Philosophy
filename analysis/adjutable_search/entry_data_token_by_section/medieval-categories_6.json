    "main_text": "Thirteenth Century || Thomas Aquinas (b. 1224/6, d. 1274)\n4.3 Thomas Aquinas (b. 1224/6, d. 1274)\n\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Aquinas did not\ncompose a commentary on Categories. Nevertheless, there are\nplenty of references to categories scattered throughout his writings.\nTwo texts are particularly important: one from his Commentary on\nAristotle's \u201cMetaphysics,\u201d the other from his\nCommentary on Aristotle's \u201cPhysics\u201d\n(Met., V. lect. 9; nn. 889\u201391, Phys. III, lect.\n5, nn. 310\u201320). These texts are important for understanding two\naspects of Aquinas' view, the derivation of the categories from\nmodes of predication and the isomorphism between language, thought, and\nreality.\n\n\nThe derivation of the ten categories is most originally presented in\nthe Commentary on the \u201cMetaphysics.\u201d Aquinas\nbegins by dividing being into three modes: outside the mind\n(extra animam), in the mind (in mente), and\nas divided into act and potency (per potentiam et actum).\nBeing, considered in the first way (which is the one pertinent to the\ndiscussion here), is not divided as a genus (e.g., animal) is into\nspecies (e.g., human) by means of differences (differentiae,\ne.g., rational), because such differences need to be outside the\ngenus's essence (e.g., rationality is not included in animality),\nand nothing lies outside being. Being, as found outside the mind, is\ninstead divided into categories (praedicamenta) on the basis\nof how it is predicated (modi praedicandi). Predication occurs\nin three fundamental ways to indicate: (1) what a subject is (id\nquod est subiectum); (2) that something inheres in a\nsubject (inest subiecto); and (3) that something does not\ninhere in the subject and is beyond it but nonetheless affects it\n(sumatur ab eo quod est extra subiectum). These three modes of\npredication are in turn divided and subdivided to account for the ten\ncategories.\n\n\nIn the first kind of predication, the predicate expresses what a\nsubject is. For example, in \u2018Socrates is a man,\u2019\n\u2018man\u2019 indicates that Socrates is a man. Of course,\none can ask further what man is, and so on until one reaches the\nhighest term, which is substance. The same is true, mutatis\nmutandis, of any other individual subject, for all subjects are in\nthe end some kind of primary substance, of which everything else is\npredicated. This kind of predication accounts for the first and most\nbasic category, substance [substantia].\n\n\nIn the second kind of fundamental predication, the predicate\nindicates inherence in a subject. According to Aquinas, this kind of\npredication is initially divided into absolute (per se et\nabsolute) and relative (in respectu ad aliud). In\nabsolute predication the inherence comes from either the\nsubject's matter or form. When it comes from the matter, then the\npredicate falls into the second category, quantity\n[quantitas]. For example, in \u2018Socrates is five and a\nhalf feet tall,\u2019 \u2018five and a half feet tall\u2019 is taken\nfrom Socrates' matter. But when the inherence comes from the\nform, the predicate falls into the third category, quality\n[qualitas]. For example, in \u2018Socrates is\nrational,\u2019 \u2018rational\u2019 is taken from the form of\nSocrates, his humanity. If the predication is relative, however, then\nthe predicate falls into the fourth category, relation [ad\naliud]. For example, in \u2018Socrates is the father of\nphilosophy,\u2019 \u2018father\u2019 indicates the relation of\nSocrates to philosophy.\n\n\nIn the third kind of fundamental predication, the predicate\nindicates something that does not inhere in a subject and is beyond it,\nalthough it affects it in some manner. This kind of predication\naccounts for the remaining six categories. It is initially divided into\ntwo sorts: those that are completely extrinsic to the subject\n(omnino extra subiectum), and those that, while strictly\nspeaking are not in the subject, are nonetheless in some way in the\nsubject (secundum aliquid sit in subiecto).\n\n\nThe predications that are taken from something completely extrinsic\nto the subject are divided into those that do not in any way measure\nthe subject and those that do. In the former, predicates indicate\nsomething that affects the subject without measuring it. For example,\nin \u2018Socrates is wearing clothes,\u2019 \u2018being\nclothed\u2019 expresses that Socrates is affected but does not in any\nway measure him. These predicates belong to the fifth category,\nhabit [habitus] (a habit is a garment used by the\nreligious). Predications that in some way indicate a measuring of a\nsubject are divided into those that measure time (e.g., in\n\u2018Socrates came yesterday,\u2019 \u2018yesterday\u2019 tells us\nthe pertinent time) and those that indicate place. In the first, the\npredicates fall into the sixth category, time\n[quando]. The second can in turn be divided into two\nkinds: predications in which the predicate signifies the parts of a\nsubject in relation to one another and those that do not. For example,\nin \u2018Socrates is sitting,\u2019 \u2018sitting\u2019 indicates\nSocrates' position. Likewise, in the example, \u2018Socrates is\nin the market place,\u2019 \u2018market place\u2019 identifies\nSocrates' location. The first kind of predication accounts for\nthe seventh category, position [situs], and the\nsecond for the eighth, location [ubi].\n\n\nPredications indicating that something is not strictly speaking in\nthe subject but nonetheless in it in some way can be of two sorts. One\ninvolves a cause of an action. For example, in \u2018Socrates is\nteaching,\u2019 \u2018Socrates\u2019 refers to the cause of the\naction of teaching, and therefore accounts for the ninth category,\naction [agere]. The other involves being affected by\nan action. For example, in \u2018Plato is being taught,\u2019\n\u2018Plato\u2019 refers to the recipient of the action of teaching,\nand therefore accounts for the tenth category, passion\n[pati].\n\n\nFundamental to Aquinas' derivation of the categories is an isomorphism\nbetween language and reality. Only because language parallels reality\nin some way can Aquinas derive the ten categories of extra-mental\nthings from the ten different kinds of predication he accepts; we know\nthat there are ten different kinds of things based on the different\nways something is \u201csaid of\u201d or \u201cpredicated of\u201d\na subject. As John Wippel puts it, the \u201cdiverse modes of\npredication correspond to and reflect diverse ways in which being\nitself is realized, or what [Thomas] calls diverse modes of being\n(modi essendi). Moreover, this diversity in the order of\npredication follows from and depends upon diversity in the order of\nbeing\u201d (Wippel 1987, 17).\n\n\nThis isomorphism holds not only between language and reality, but\nextends also to thought, which mediates between language and reality.\nAgain, as Wippel notes: \u201cThe mode or way in which words signify\ndoes not immediately follow upon modes of being of such things, but\nonly as mediated by the way in which such things are understood\u201d\n(Wippel 1987, 17\u201318). Thus, one could say that things in the\nworld are isomorphic with concepts, and that concepts in turn are\nisomorphic with words insofar as our use of language follows the way we\nthink and this in turn follows the way the world is.\n\n\nFor many medieval Aristotelians, the isomorphism between language,\nthought, and reality does not apply only to the derivation of the ten\ncategories. A group of thirteenth-century thinkers commonly referred to\nas the modistae go well beyond Aquinas in\nthis respect. Although there is little consensus on exactly who these\nthinkers are, most accounts include Martin of Dacia (d. 1304), John of\nDacia (d. ca. 1280), Petrus Croccus (d. 1304), Michael of Marbais (fl.\nca. 1300), Radulphus Brito (ca. 1270\u20131320), and Thomas of Erfurt (fl.\nca. 1300). They are important in particular because of their views\nconcerning the strong isomorphism between language and reality. For\nmany of them this isomorphism is so profound that the boundaries\nbetween grammar, logic, and metaphysics are either non-existent or\nfuzzy. Thus, conclusions about the nature of things (reality) can be\nderived from grammatical (language) or logical (thought)\nconsiderations, just as Aquinas derives the ten ultimate\ncategories of reality from ten modes of predication. As Sten Ebbesen\ndescribes it: \u201cThe basic idea of modism is this: each constituent\nof reality (each res) has a number of ways or modes of being\n(modi essendi) which determine the number of ways in which it\ncan be correctly conceptualized; the ways in which it can be\nconceptualized (modi intelligendi) in turn determine in which\nway it can be signified\u201d (Ebbesen 1998, 274). Christian Kloesel\nadds that by \u201cdiscovering the logical structure and the causes of\nlanguage, a modista tried to explain the essential nature and\npurpose of human speech and the ways in which words have meaning. [For\nthe modistae thought] that the structure of language mirrors\nthe structure of reality and the operations of the human mind\u201d\n(Kloesel 1981, 130).\n\n\nNot every late medieval author held that one can\ndemonstrate the number of categories, or that there is an isomorphism\nbetween language, thought, and reality. Some of them doubted\nthe possibility of proving that there are only ten\ncategories of reality, while some went so far as to reduce them to two\n(Ockham) or three (Buridan).\n",
