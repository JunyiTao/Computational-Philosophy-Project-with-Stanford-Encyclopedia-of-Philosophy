    "main_text": "Malament\u2019s Theorem\n4. Other Considerations\n\n\nSince the conventionality thesis rests upon the existence of a fastest\ncausal signal, the existence of arbitrarily fast causal signals would\nundermine the thesis. If we leave aside the question of causality, for\nthe moment, the possibility of particles (called tachyons) moving with\narbitrarily high velocities is consistent with the mathematical\nformalism of special relativity (see, for example, Feinberg 1967).\nJust as the speed of light in vacuum is an upper limit to the possible\nspeeds of ordinary particles (sometimes called bradyons), it would be\na lower limit to the speeds of tachyons. When a transformation is made\nto a different inertial frame of reference, the speeds of both\nbradyons and tachyons change (the speed of light in vacuum being the\nonly invariant speed). At any instant, the speed of a bradyon can be\ntransformed to zero and the speed of a tachyon can be transformed to\nan infinite value. The statement that a bradyon is moving forward in\ntime remains true in every inertial frame (if it is true in one), but\nthis is not so for tachyons. Feinberg (1967) argues that this does not\nlead to violations of causality through the exchange of tachyons\nbetween two uniformly moving observers because of ambiguities in the\ninterpretation of the behavior of tachyon emitters and absorbers,\nwhose roles can change from one to the other under the transformation\nbetween inertial frames. He claims to resolve putative causal\nanomalies by adopting the convention that each observer describes the\nmotion of each tachyon interacting with that observer\u2019s apparatus in\nsuch a way as to make the tachyon move forward in time. However, all\nof Feinberg\u2019s examples involve motion in only one spatial\ndimension. Pirani (1970) has given an explicit two-dimensional example\nin which Feinberg\u2019s convention is satisfied but a tachyon signal is\nemitted by an observer and returned to that observer at an earlier\ntime, thus leading to possible causal anomalies.\n\n\nA claim that no value of \u03b5 other than 1/2 is mathematically\npossible has been put forward by Zangari (1994). He argues that\nspin-1/2 particles (e.g., electrons) must be represented\nmathematically by what are known as complex spinors, and that the\ntransformation properties of these spinors are not consistent with the\nintroduction of nonstandard coordinates (corresponding to values of\n\u03b5 other than 1/2). Gunn and Vetharaniam (1995), however,\npresent a derivation of the Dirac equation (the fundamental equation\ndescribing spin-1/2 particles) using coordinates that are consistent\nwith arbitrary synchrony. They argue that Zangari mistakenly required\na particular representation of space-time points as the only one\nconsistent with the spinorial description of spin-1/2 particles.\n\n\nAnother argument for standard synchrony has been given by Ohanian (2004),\nwho bases his considerations on the laws of dynamics. He argues that a\nnonstandard choice of synchrony introduces pseudoforces into Newton\u2019s\nsecond law, which must hold in the low-velocity limit of special\nrelativity; that is, it is only with standard synchrony that net force\nand acceleration will be proportional.  Macdonald (2005) defends the\nconventionality thesis against this argument in a fashion analagous to\nthe argument used by Salmon (mentioned above in\nthe first paragraph of the second section of this article) against the\nuse of the law of conservation of momentum to define simultaneity:\nMacdonald says, in effect, that it is a convention to require Newton\u2019s\nlaws to take their standard form.\n\n\nMany of the arguments against conventionality involve viewing the\npreferred simultaneity relation as an equivalence relation that is\ninvariant under an appropriate transformation group.  Mamone Capria\n(2012) has examined the interpretation of simultaneity as an invariant\nequivalence relation in great detail, and argues that it does not have\nany bearing on the question of whether or not simultaneity is\nconventional in special relativity.\n\n\nA vigorous defense of conventionality has been offered by Rynasiewicz\n(2012). He argues that his approach \u201chas the merit of nailing\nthe exact sense in which simultaneity is conventional. It is\nconventional in precisely the same sense in which the gauge freedom\nthat arises in the general theory of relativity makes the choice\nbetween diffeomorphically related models conventional.\u201d He\nbegins by showing that any choice of a simultaneity relation is\nequivalent to a choice of a velocity in the equation for local time in\nH.A. Lorentz\u2019s Versuch theory (Lorentz 1895). Then, beginning\nwith Minkowski space with the standard Minkowski metric, he introduces\na diffeomorphism in which each point is mapped to a point with the\nsame spatial coordinates, but the temporal coordinate is that of a\nLorentzian local time expressed in terms of the velocity as a\nparameter. This mapping is not an isometry, for the light cones are\ntilted, which corresponds to anisotropic light propagation. He\nproceeds to argue, using the hole argument (see, for example, Earman\nand Norton 1987) as an analogy, that this parametric freedom is just\nlike the gauge freedom of general relativity.  As the tilting of the\nlight cones, if projected into a single spatial dimension, would be\nequivalent to a choice of Reichenbach\u2019s \u03b5, it seems that\nRynasiewicz\u2019s argument is a generalization and more completely argued\nversion of the argument given by Janis that is mentioned above in the\nthird paragraph of Section 3.\n\n\nThe debate about conventionality of simultaneity seems far from\nsettled, although some proponents on both sides of the argument might\ndisagree with that statement. The reader wishing to pursue the matter\nfurther should consult the sources listed below as well as additional\nreferences cited in those sources.\n",
