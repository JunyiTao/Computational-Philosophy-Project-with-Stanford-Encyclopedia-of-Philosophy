    "main_text": "Alternative Historical Models of Computability\n4. Alternative Historical Models of Computability\n\nBesides the Turing machine, several other models were introduced\nindependently of Turing in the context of research into the foundation\nof mathematics which resulted in theses that are logically equivalent\nto Turing\u2019s thesis. For each of these models it was proven that\nthey capture the Turing computable functions. Note that the\ndevelopment of the modern computer stimulated the development of other\nmodels such as register machines or Markov algorithms. More recently,\ncomputational approaches in disciplines such as biology or physics,\nresulted in bio-inspired and physics-inspired models such as Petri\nnets or quantum Turing machines. A discussion of such models, however,\nlies beyond the scope of this entry.\n",
