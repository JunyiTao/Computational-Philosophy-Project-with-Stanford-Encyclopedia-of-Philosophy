Inexactness, ceteris paribus clauses, tendencies, \u201cunrealistic assumptions\u201d and models\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the most important\nmethodological issue concerning economics involves the very\nconsiderable simplification, idealization, and abstraction that\ncharacterizes economic theory and the consequent doubts these features\nof economics raise concerning whether economics is well supported.\nClaims such as, \u201cAgents prefer larger commodity bundles to\nsmaller commodity bundles,\u201d raise serious questions, because if\nthey are interpreted as universal generalizations, they are false; and\nphilosophy of science has traditionally supposed that science is\ndevoted to the discovery of genuine laws\u2014that is, true universal\ngeneralizations. Even though it is false that everyone always prefers\nlarger commodity bundles to smaller, the generalization seems\ninformative and useful. Can a science rest on false generalizations?\nIf these claims are not universal generalizations, then what is their\nlogical form? And how can claims that appear in this way to be false\nor approximate be tested and confirmed or disconfirmed? These problems\nhave bedeviled economists and economic methodologists from the first\nmethodological reflections to the present day.\n",
