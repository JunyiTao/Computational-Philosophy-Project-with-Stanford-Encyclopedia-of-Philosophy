    "main_text": "Radical Meliorism\n5. Socializing Care\n\nAn analysis of Addams\u2019 moral philosophy suggests at least three\nclaims about her relationship to feminist care ethics avant la\nlettre. One, Addams\u2019 approach to the important social\nissues of her day reflected the relationality and contextualization\nthat are important to what is called care ethics today. Two, although\nAddams employed caring in response to the needs of others, she\ncontributes an active, even assertive, dimension to care ethics not\ncommonly found in feminist theory. Third, Addams advocates what might\nbe called \u201csocializing care\u201d: systemically instantiating\nthe habits and practices of care in social institutions.\n\nAlthough care is a simple and widely invoked word, many feminist\ntheorists have invested it with a particular meaning as it applies to\nethics. The original motivation for developing care ethics was an\nacknowledgment that traditional forms of morality, in particular\nprinciple-based and consequence-based ethics, did not adequately\naddress the richness of the human condition. These approaches bracket\nout emotions, relationships, temporal considerations, reciprocity, and\ncreativity to focus on immediate adjudication of moral conflicts.\nAccordingly, the use of rules or consequences can become a\nreductionist and formulaic response resulting in shortsighted answers\nto complex and systemic issues. For care ethicists, principles can be\nuseful, but a concern for interpersonal connection tempers them.\nPrinciples and consequences can be important in moral\ndeliberation, but care theorists seek a more robust and complex sense\nof morality that cannot ignore the context and people involved. For\nexample, the claim that people who spray-paint graffiti on a building\nought to be punished because they have damaged someone else\u2019s\nproperty (rule/principle violation) will likely receive widespread\nassent. Care ethicists do not necessarily deny such an assertion, but\nthey want to know more. The person doing the spray-painting is a human\nbeing whose motivations and circumstances may reveal other variables\nnot sufficiently addressed by the mere recognition of rule violations.\nSystemic issues involving social opportunities, discrimination, or\nlack of voice may have contributed to this behavior. Care ethicists\nshift the moral focus from abstract individuals and their actions to\nconcrete, situated people with feelings, friends, and\ndreams\u2014persons who can be cared about. Care ethics demands\neffort, experience, knowledge, imagination, and empathy to effectively\nunderstand the totality of the moral context. The result is not an\nexoneration of personal responsibility but a richer understanding of\nthe human condition where we are all actors and acted upon.\n\nAddams consistently moves beyond formulaic moral accounts of\nprinciples or consequences to apply a kind of care ethics to her\nexperiences in the Hull House neighborhood. Proximity is once again\ncrucial as she has direct experience with individuals, providing the\nresources for a caring response. However, as a philosopher, Addams\nextrapolates her experiences to theorize about others of similar\ncircumstances. For example, in The Spirit of Youth and the City\nStreets Addams addresses juvenile delinquency. She recounts\ncharges against young men who were brought before the Juvenile Court\nin Chicago (which Hull House had helped establish). These charges were\ncategorized by type, such as stealing, which included the pilfering of\npigeons, blankets, and a bicycle. Another category was disorderly\nconduct which included picking up coal from railroad tracks, throwing\nstones at railroad employees, and breaking down a fence. There was\nalso vagrancy, which included loafing, sleeping on the streets all\nnight, and wandering (SYC 56\u201357). Addams does not deny the\nseriousness of some of these infractions, but she does not rush to\njudgment, instead choosing to investigate the context further. She\ntalks to the young men and asks them about their motivations. She\nidentifies a listlessness, a desire for adventure not quieted by what\nthe city has to offer: \u201ctheir very demand for excitement is a\nprotest against the dullness of life, to which we ourselves\ninstinctively respond\u201d (SYC 71). Addams views the city as built\naround the possibility of factory production but ignores the needs of\nfuture workers. Among \u201cjuvenile delinquents,\u201d Adams\nfinds many young people who simply seek adventure and excitement\nbecause their lives have little of it. Had Addams merely abstracted\nyouth as a category of individuals who seem prone to break the law,\nshe could have easily found principles to judge them negatively.\nHowever, Addams saw them as humans, many of whom she witnessed growing\nup in the neighborhood, and she cared for them beyond the alienating\nlabel of \u201ctroubled youth.\u201d\n\nMore than merely prefiguring care ethics, Addams infuses a high social\nresponsibility standard into this moral approach. Addams advocates a\nduty of social awareness and engagement, thus creating the potential\nfor care. Many care ethicists are wary of the notion of duty as it has\nbeen traditionally formulated. Moral duties have historically entailed\nclaims regarding actions that a person is required to offer on behalf\nof another. Because the \u201cother\u201d is an abstract other and\nthe requirements are universalized (I must act in such a way in all\ncases), duties toward others have tended toward moral minimums of\nobligation. For example, a moral obligation to act is present if\nsomeone\u2019s life is in peril and minimal effort is required to\nprevent it, such as an infant drowning in 3 inches of bathwater.\nAlthough such cases get widespread agreement, it becomes more\nchallenging to ascertain what obligation one has to distant others\nwith unclear expectations of success. For example, many Americans have\ndisposable income that could save the life of someone in a\npoverty-stricken country on a distant continent; do they have a moral\nobligation to give them money, and to what extent? Addams constructs\nthe duty to care differently. Hers is an epistemological demand.\nAddams claims that good citizens actively pursue knowledge of\nothers\u2014not just facts but a more profound\nunderstanding\u2014for the possibility of caring and acting on their\nbehalf: \u201cif we grow contemptuous of our fellows, and consciously\nlimit our intercourse to certain kinds of people whom we have\npreviously decided to respect, we not only tremendously circumscribe\nour range of life, but limit our scope of ethics\u201d (DSE 8). For\nAddams, care ethics must be actively pursued, not passively fostered.\nAddams\u2019 language is more assertive than much of the current care\nethics discourse.\n\nFinally, Addams extends care ethics to the public realm. She is not\ncontent to compartmentalize personal and social morality. Caring is\nwhat she desires for democracy and its various institutions. Addams\nviews the residents of social settlements, for example, as having\n\u201can opportunity of seeing institutions from the\nrecipient\u2019s standpoint\u201d because they are not distant\ninstitutions but neighbors. She finds this perspective significant and\nbelieves that it should ultimately \u201cfind expression in\ninstitutional management\u201d (OVS 39). Furthermore, she\ndifferentiates the epistemological project of the settlement from the\nuniversity in language that acknowledges a caring element: \u201cThe\nsettlement stands for application as opposed to research; for emotion\nas opposed to abstraction, for universal interest as opposed to\nspecialization\u201d (FSS 189). While social settlements epitomize a\ndemocratic endeavor for Addams, she applies the same caring values to\nother institutions. The creation of the juvenile courts in Chicago\nrepresented an example of caring because it mandated contextualized\nregard for the context of young people. The creation of adult\neducation that addressed tangible and contemporary issues also\ndemonstrated a caring regard for the needs of Hull-House neighbors.\nPerhaps most of all, the comportment of the Hull-House residents\nmanifested care ethics in their willingness to listen, learn and\nrespond. Addams viewed socializing care as participating in a rich\nideal of democracy.\n",
