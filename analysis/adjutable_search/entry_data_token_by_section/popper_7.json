Social and Political Thought\u2014The Critique of Historicism and Holism\n\nGiven Popper\u2019s personal history and background, it is hardly\nsurprising that he developed a deep and abiding interest in social and\npolitical philosophy. He understood holism as the view that human\nsocial groupings are greater than the sum of their members, that they\nact on their human members and shape their destinies and that they are\nsubject to their own independent laws of development. Historicism he\nidentified as the belief that history develops inexorably and\nnecessarily according to certain principles or rules towards a\ndeterminate end (as for example in the Marx\u2019s dialectical\nmaterialism). The link between them is that holism holds that\nindividuals are essentially formed by the social groupings to which\nthey belong, while historicism suggests that we can understand such a\nsocial grouping only in terms of the internal principles which\ndetermine its development.\n\nThese lead to what Popper calls \u201cThe Historicist Doctrine of the\nSocial Sciences\u201d, the views (a) that the principal task of the\nsocial sciences is to make predictions about the social and political\ndevelopment of man, and (b) that the task of politics, once the key\npredictions have been made, is, in Marx\u2019s words, to lessen the\n\u201cbirth pangs\u201d of future social and political developments.\nPopper thinks that this view of the social sciences is both\ntheoretically misconceived and socially dangerous, as it can give rise\nto totalitarianism and authoritarianism\u2014to centralised\ngovernmental control of the individual and the attempted imposition of\nlarge-scale social planning. Against this, he advances the view that\nany human social grouping is no more (or less) than the sum of its\nindividual members, that what happens in history is the (largely\nunforeseeable) result of the actions of such individuals, and that\nlarge scale social planning to an antecedently conceived blueprint is\ninherently misconceived\u2014and inevitably\ndisastrous\u2014precisely because human actions have consequences\nwhich cannot be foreseen. Popper, then, is an historical\nindeterminist, insofar as he holds that history does not\nevolve in accordance with intrinsic laws or principles, that in the\nabsence of such laws and principles unconditional prediction in the\nsocial sciences is an impossibility, and that there is no such thing\nas historical necessity.\n\nThe link between Popper\u2019s theory of knowledge and his social\nphilosophy is his fallibilism. We make theoretical progress in science\nby subjecting our theories to critical scrutiny, and abandoning those\nwhich have been falsified. So too in an open society the rights of the\nindividual to criticise administrative policies will be safeguarded\nand upheld, undesirable policies will be eliminated in a manner\nanalogous to the elimination of falsified scientific theories, and\npolitical differences will be resolved by critical discussion and\nargument rather than by coercion. The open society as thus conceived\nof by Popper may be defined as\n\n\nan association of free individuals respecting each other\u2019s\nrights within the framework of mutual protection supplied by the\nstate, and achieving, through the making of responsible, rational\ndecisions, a growing measure of humane and enlightened life. (R. B.\nLevinson 1953: 17)\n\n\nSuch as society is not a utopian ideal, Popper argues, but an\nempirically realised form of social organisation which is in every\nrespect superior to its (real or potential) totalitarian rivals. His\nstrategy, however, is not merely to engage in a moral defence of the\nideology of liberalism, but rather to show that totalitarianism is\ntypically based upon historicist and holist presuppositions, and of\ndemonstrating that these presuppositions are fundamentally\nincoherent.\n",
