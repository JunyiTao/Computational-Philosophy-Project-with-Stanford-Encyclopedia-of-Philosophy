The first part of\nthe Encyclopaedia is essentially a condensed version of his\nearlier Science of Logic, considered above. We will pass over\na consideration of this work to the next component of\nthe Encyclopaedia, Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of\nNature.\n3.2.1. Philosophy of Nature\nHegel\u2019s Philosophy of Nature (first published as\nsuch in 1842, and based on \u00a7\u00a7245\u2013376 from the\n1830 Encyclopaedia, supplemented by material and student\ntranscripts from Hegel\u2019s Berlin lectures) has often been damned\nby the contention that Hegel had simply dismissed the\nactivity of the natural sciences, especially Newtonian science, as\nbased upon the inadequacies of the Understanding, and in\ntheir place had tried to somehow deduce the natural\nworld from philosophical first principles. Recently, however, defenses\nof Hegel\u2019s philosophy of science have started to emerge,\nespecially from the side of Hegel\u2019s reformed\nmetaphysical interpreters. Thus, it has been argued by Westphal\n(2008) for example, that Hegel\u2019s philosophy of nature actually\nrepresents a sophisticated attempt to think through epistemological\nassumptions that are presupposed by the development of Newton\u2019s\ntheory. Defending Hegel\u2019s philosophy of science from a similar\npoint of view, James Kreines (2008) has argued for the relevance of\nHegel\u2019s logical categories for the biological sciences of his\ntimes. We won\u2019t here attempt to present such arguments, but\nbefore any such reassessment of Hegel\u2019s work here could\nbe undertaken, the fundamental criticism raised above of a project\nthat attempts to base a philosophy of nature on his logic rather than\nthe empirical sciences must be addressed. Was not Hegel simply trying\nto pre-empt the work of empirical scientists by somehow attempting to\nanticipate the very contents of their discoveries from\nlogical considerations alone?\nThis objection is often summed up under the slogan of\n\u201cdeducing Krug\u2019s pen\u201d, in that in 1801 the\nphilosopher W.T. Krug had accused Schelling\u2019s idealist\nphilosophy of nature of aiming to deduce the nature of all contingent\nphenomena, even that of the pen with which he, Krug, was writing his\ncritique. Hegel responded to Krug\u2019s accusation in the following\nyear, claiming that Krug had made the common mistake of conflating the\nunderstanding with reason, and treating the Absolute as something on\nthe same level as finite things.\nHegel was, at this time, closely aligned with Schelling\u2019s\nviews, and would separate his own views from\nSchelling\u2019s in subsequent years leading up to the writing\nof Phenomenology of Spirit. Nevertheless, Hegel clearly\nthought that his point held regardless of the relation of his own\nviews to Schelling\u2019s as he was to make similar points against\nKrug in a remark added to the Philosophy of Nature from the\nHeidelberg and Berlin periods. While logic must not be restricted to\nthe \u201cform\u201d of an externally given \u201cmatter\u201d,\nnevertheless,\nit is the height of pointlessness to demand of the\nconcept that it should explain \u2026 construe or deduce these\ncontingent products of nature. (PN: \u00a7250, remark. Krug is\nmentioned explicitly in a footnote at this point.)\n\n\nThe point is expanded upon further when it is\nsaid that it is\nan error on the part of the philosophy of nature\nto attempt to face up to all phenomena; this is done in the finite\nsciences, where everything has to be reduced to general conceptions\n(hypotheses). In these sciences the empirical element is the sole\nconfirmation of the hypothesis, so that everything has to be\nexplained.  (PN: \u00a7270, addition)\nIn keeping with the more general idea that that philosophy attempts\nto discern or recognize concepts in\nrepresentations (Vorstellungen) or empirical appearances, philosophy of\nnature investigates the conceptual structures that are manifest in the\nproducts of the scientific work that is done on the basis of those\nappearances.\nTraces of conceptual determination will certainly\nsurvive in the most particularized product, although they will not\nexhaust its nature. (PN: \u00a7250 remark)\n\n\nClearly, philosophy of nature is not in competition with the empirical\nnatural sciences; it takes as its subject matter the results of those\nsciences in order to discover within them the particular ways in which\nthe necessary categorial structures deduced in the logic are\nexpressed.\nIn terms of topics treated, the Philosophy of Nature\nlargely coincides with those treated in the third book of\nthe Science of Logic when the logical processes and relations\nin question have returned to objectivity after the\nexcursion into the subjectivity of formal logic at the outset\nof Book 3.  In Mechanism Hegel had reconstructed a\nmovement in thought from a primitive cosmology in which all objects\nare conceived in relation to a central object (the sun) that\nexemplifies objecthood per se, to a system of objects within\nwhich any such self-sufficient center has been\neliminated. In this Newtonian world, that which gives order to the\nwhole now has the ideality of law, but this\nis itself thought of as external to the system\nof objects.\nAfter an Introduction, Section One of\nthe Philosophy of Nature, Mechanics, expands on this\nprogression through considerations of space and time, matter\nconsidered as the diversity of individual bodies distributed in space\nand time, and finally the idea of universal gravitation as the\ndeterminate concept of such corporeal matter realized as idea\n(PN: \u00a7270). In the Newtonian laws of mechanics, however, the\nunity of matter is still only formal, and in Section\nTwo, Physics, the determinateness of form is now considered\nas immanent within such corporeal matter.\n\nMatter has individuality to the extent that it is\ndetermined within itself by having being-for-self developed within\nit. It is through this determination that matter breaks away from\ngravity and manifests itself as implicitly self-determining. (PN:\n\u00a7273)\n\n\nWhile Mechanics clearly reflects the\nmore space-filling conception of matter dominant in\nBritish thought, Physics is consistent with the more\ndynamic continental European conception of matter\noriginating in Leibniz with his idea of living\nforces. Within this framework, Hegel attempts to organize a\nvast array of areas of contemporary physical investigation including\nmeteorology, theories of sound and heat, light and electricity up to\nand including chemical processes which stand on the\nthreshold of Organic Physics, dealt with in Section\nThree. The study of organics represents a return to the consideration\nof the individual body with which Mechanics had\nstarted, but now considered as \u201cinfinite process in which\nthe individuality determines itself as the particularity or\nfinitude which it also negates, and returns into itself by\nre-establishing itself at the end of the process as the beginning\u201d. The\nbody is now \u201can impregnated and negative unity, which\nby relating itself to itself, has become essentially self-centred\nand subjective\u201d (PN: \u00a7337). From such a conception,\nthe first body to be considered is that of the earth\nitself, along with its history. Chapter Two moves to a\nconsideration of the plant and Chapter Three, the animal\norganism.\nFrom the point of view of the actual content of scientific theories\nand approaches that Hegel summarizes and locates within his system,\nhis Philosophy of Nature is clearly a product of his time.\nNevertheless, many of the underlying philosophical issues dealt with\nare still now far from settled. Thus, while Newtonian physics clearly\nbecame established in ways that made Leibniz\u2019s dynamic physics\nseem obsolete as empirical theory, debate still goes on as to\nwhether conceptions of space-time in post-Newtonian physics is to be\nconceived in Newtonian or Leibnizian ways.\n3.2.2 Philosophy of Subjective and Objective Spirit\nIn the Encyclopaedia, Philosophy of Nature is\nfollowed by Philosophy of Spirit (Geist).\nHegel\u2019s usual triadic pattern when applied here results in\nsections devoted to the philosophies of subjective spirit, objective\nspirit, and absolute spirit. Philosophy of subjective spirit\nconstitutes what is closest in Hegel\u2019s philosophy to a\nphilosophy of mind in the contemporary sense, while the philosophy\nof objective spirit concerns those objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified in patterns of human life we have seen at work\nin Phenomenology of Spirit. Within subjective spirit, we may\nanticipate that the first division, Anthropology, will\nfollow on from topics with which Philosophy of Nature\nends\u2014the animal organism\u2014and so it does. Thus here Hegel\nis concerned with what he terms \u201cSeele\u201d,\n\u201csoul\u201d\u2014which seems to translate more the ancient\nGreek term, \u201cpsyche\u201d\u2014and hence\nthe mind-body relation:\nIf soul and body are absolutely opposed to one\nanother as is maintained by the abstractive intellectual consciousness,\n\n\nHegel comments,\nthen there is no possibility of any community\nbetween them. The community was, however, recognized by ancient\nmetaphysics as an undeniable fact. (PN: \u00a7 389\nadd)\nThe Seele of Anthropology should therefore not be\nconfused with the modern subjective conception of mind, as exemplified\nby Descartes and other early modern philosophers. Aristotle had\nconceived of the soul as the form of the body, not as a\nsubstance separate from that of the body, and had attributed lesser\nsouls to animals and even plants. (Again, Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nsubstantial form comes into view.) Concomitantly, in\nthis section Hegel describes spirit as sunk in nature,\nand treats consciousness as largely limited to what now might be\ndescribed as sentient or phenomenal consciousness\nalone\u2014the feeling soul. Consciousness in\nthe sense of the modern subject\u2013object opposition only makes its\nappearance in the following second section, Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which, reprising key moments from the earlier book of\nthat name, raises a problem for how we are to understand the relation\nof phenomenology and systematic philosophy: is it\na path to it or part of it? Given that the\nrecognitive approach to self-consciousness presupposes that\npotential self-consciousnesses are in fact embodied and\nlocated in the world, we would expect the mind as treated\nin Psychology to be no less embodied as the way in which it\nis conceived in Anthropology. What in fact distinguishes the\nmind of Psychology from that of Anthropology is its\nrational capacities, considered in terms that would now be described\nas normative rather than simply naturalistic, and this\nfor Hegel clearly signals a difference in the way in which an actual\npsychological subject relates to his or her own body. The\ntype of abstractive thinking found in Psychology\ndoes not, of course, as in mythical images of metempsychosis\u2014a\nfavorite trope of Platonists\u2014involve the mind leaving\nthe body.  This would count for Hegel as a piece of mythical\npicture thinking\u2014a Vorstellung. Rather,\nit involves a certain capacity of the psychological subject to suspend\nunreflected-upon endorsement of the claims made on behalf of\nhis or her body, for example, to subject the evidence\ngiven by the senses to rational scrutiny.\nGiven the dialectical mode in which Hegel\u2019s texts progress,\nas seen already in both Phenomenology of Spirit\nand Science of Logic, we will expect the capacities examined\nin Psychology to ultimately depend upon those that come under\nconsideration in the context of objective spirit. In this\nsense, we are witnessing within another mode, the type of progression\nseen in the movement in Phenomenology from shapes of\nconsciousness to shapes of spirit. The\ninternal Phenomenology of Spirit seems to play an important\nrole in setting up this transition from Psychology\nto Objective Spirit (Williams 2007), but it might also be\nseen as crucial in relating the more cognitive dimensions\nof Psychology back to the theme of embodiment prominent\nin Anthropology (Nuzzo 2013a).Thus any naturalistic analysis is ultimately\nsurpassed by a social and historical one, which itself cannot\nbe understood as anti-naturalistic.\nThe philosophy of subjective spirit passes over into that\nof objective spirit, which concerns the objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified. The book entitled Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight, published in 1821 as a textbook to accompany Hegel\u2019s\nlectures at the University of Berlin, essentially corresponds to a\nmore developed version of the philosophy of objective spirit and will\nbe considered here.\nElements of the Philosophy of Right\nThe Philosophy of Right (as it is more commonly called)\ncan be read as a political philosophy that stands independently of the\nsystem (Tunick 1992), despite the fact that Hegel intended it to be\nread against the background of the developing conceptual\ndeterminations of the Logic. The text proper starts from the\nconception of a singular willing subject (grasped from the point of\nview of its individual self-consciousness) as the bearer of\nabstract right. While this conception of the individual\nwilling subject possessing some kind of fundamental rights was in fact\nthe starting point of many modern political philosophies (such as that\nof Locke, for example) the fact that Hegel commences here does not\ntestify to any ontological assumption that the consciously willing and\nright-bearing individual is the basic atom from which all society can\nbe understood as constructed\u2014an idea at the heart of standard\nsocial contract theories. Rather, this is simply the\nmost immediate starting point of Hegel\u2019s\npresentation and corresponds to analogous starting places of\nthe Phenomenology and the Logic. Just as the\ncategories of the Logic develop in a way meant to demonstrate\nthat what had at the start been conceived as simple is in fact only\nmade determinate in virtue of its being a functional part of some\nlarger structure or process, here too it is meant to be shown that any\nsimple willing and right-bearing subject only gains its determinacy in\nvirtue of a place it finds for itself in a larger social, and\nultimately historical, structure or process. Thus, even a contractual\nexchange (the minimal social interaction for contract theorists) is\nnot to be thought simply as an occurrence consequent upon the\nexistence of two beings with natural animal wants and some natural\ncalculative rationality, as in Hobbes, say; rather, the system of\ninteraction within which individual exchanges take place (the economy)\nwill be treated holistically as a culturally-shaped form of social\nlife within which the actual wants of individuals as well as their\nreasoning powers are given determinate forms. Hegel is well aware of\nthe distinctive modernity of this form of social-life.\nHere too it becomes apparent that Hegel, taking up themes from\nthe Phenomenology, follows Fichte in treating property in\nterms of a recognitive analysis of the nature of such a\nright. A contractual exchange of commodities between two individuals\nitself involves an implicit act of recognition in as much as each, in\ngiving something to the other in exchange for what they want, is\nthereby recognizing that other as a proprietor of that thing,\nor, more properly, of the inalienable value attaching to it\n(PR: \u00a7\u00a772\u201381). By contrast, such proprietorship would\nbe denied rather than recognised in fraud or\ntheft\u2014forms of wrong (Unrecht) in which\nright is negated rather than acknowledged or posited\n(\u00a7\u00a782\u201393). Thus what differentiates property from\nmere possession is that it is grounded in a relation of\nreciprocal recognition between two willing subjects (\u00a771 and\nremark). Moreover, it is in the exchange relation that we can see what\nit means for Hegel for individual subjects to share a common\nwill\u2014an idea which will have important implications with\nrespect to the difference of Hegel\u2019s conception of the state\nfrom that of Rousseau. Such an interactive constitution of the common\nwill means that for Hegel that the identity among wills is\nachieved because of not in spite of co-existing\ndifferences between the particular wills of the subjects involved:\nwhile contracting individuals both will the\nsame exchange, at a more concrete level, they do so with\ndifferent ends in mind. Each wants something different from\nthe exchange. Without this difference, the type of\nabsorption of individual subjects into\ncollective substance of the type of Hegel worries about in\nrelation to Spinoza would occur (\u00a7258 remark).\nHegel passes from the abstractly individualistic frame of\nAbstract Right to the social determinacies of\nSittlichkeit or Ethical Life (PR: \u00a7142) via\nconsiderations first of wrong, the negation of right,\n(\u00a7\u00a782\u201396) and the punishment that such wrong entails\nthe negation of wrong, and hence the \u201cnegation of the\nnegation\u201d of the original right (\u00a7\u00a797\u2013104), and\nthen of morality, conceived more or less as an\ninternalisation of the external legal relations presupposed by\npunishment. Consideration of Hegel\u2019s version of the\nretributivist approach to punishment affords a good example of his use\nof the logic of negation. In punishing the criminal the state makes it\nclear to its members that it is the acknowledgment of right per\nse that is essential to developed social life: the significance\nof acknowledging another\u2019s right in the contractual exchange\ncannot be, as it at first might have appeared to the participants,\nsimply that of an instrumental means by which each gets what he or she\nwants from the other.\nHegel\u2019s treatment of punishment also brings out the\ncontinuity of his way of conceiving of the structure and dynamics of\nthe social world with that of Kant, as Kant too, in\nhis Metaphysics of Morals had employed the idea of the\nstate\u2019s punitive action as a negating of the original\ncriminal act. Kant\u2019s idea, conceived on the model of the\nphysical principle of action and reaction, was structured by the\ncategory of community or reciprocal interaction, and was\nconceived as involving what he called real\nopposition. Such an idea of opposed dynamic forces seems to\nform something of a model for Hegel\u2019s idea of contradiction and\nthe starting point for his conception of reciprocal\nrecognition. Nevertheless, clearly Hegel articulates the structures of\nrecognition in more complex ways than those derivable from\nKant\u2019s category of community.\nFirst of all, in Hegel\u2019s analysis of Sittlichkeit\nthe type of sociality found in the market-based civil\nsociety is to be understood as dependent upon and in\ncontrastive opposition with the more immediate form found in the\ninstitution of the family: a form of sociality mediated by a\nquasi-natural inter-subjective recognition rooted in sentiment and\nfeeling\u2014love (PR: \u00a7\u00a7 158\u201360). (This dependence\nshows how anthropological determinations do not simply\ndisappear with the development of more psychological\nones\u2014they are preserved as well as\nnegated as in the pattern of what\nis aufgehoben. It also shows the mutual dependence of the\ndeterminations of the singularity of the atomistic subjects\nof civil society and their particularity as members (parts)\nof holistically conceived families.) Here Hegel seems to have extended\nFichte\u2019s legally characterized notion of recognition into the\ntypes of human inter-subjectivity earlier broached by H\u00f6lderlin\nand the romantics. In the family the particularity of each individual\ntends to be absorbed into the social unit (one is a part of\none\u2019s family), giving this manifestation\nof Sittlichkeit a one-sidedness that is the inverse of that\nfound in market relations in which participants grasp themselves in\nthe first instance as singular [einzeln]\nself-identical individuals who then enter into relationships\nthat are external to them.\nThese two opposite but interlocking principles of social existence\nprovide the basic structures in terms of which the component parts of\nthe modern state are articulated and understood. As both contribute\nparticular characteristics to the subjects involved in them, part of\nthe problem for the rational state will be to ensure that each of\nthese two principles mediates the other, each thereby mitigating\nthe one-sidedness of the other. Thus, individuals who\nencounter each other in the external relations of the\nmarket place and who have their subjectivity shaped by such relations\nalso belong to families where they are subject to opposed\ninfluences. Moreover, even within the ensemble of production and\nexchange mechanisms of civil society individuals will belong to\nparticular estates (the agricultural estate, that of\ntrade and industry, and the universal estate of civil\nservants (PR: \u00a7\u00a7199\u2013208)), whose internal forms of\nsociality will show family-like features.\nAlthough the actual details of Hegel\u2019s mapping\nof the categorical structures of the Logic onto\nthe Philosophy of Right are far from clear, the general\nmotivation is apparent.  Hegel\u2019s logical categories can be read\nas an attempt to provide a schematic account of the material (rather\nthan formal) conditions required for developed self-consciousness for\nwhom rationality and freedom are maximized. Thus we might regard the\nvarious syllogisms of Hegel\u2019s Subjective\nLogic as attempts to chart the skeletal structures of those\ndifferent types of recognitive inter-subjectivity necessary to sustain\nvarious aspects of rational cognitive and conative functioning\n(self-consciousness). From this perspective, we might\nsee his logical schematisation of the modern\nrational state as a way of displaying just those sorts\nof mediating institutions that a state must provide if it is to answer\nRousseau\u2019s question of the form of association needed for the\nformation and expression of the general will.\nConcretely, for Hegel it is representation of the estates within\nthe legislative bodies that is to achieve this (PR:\n\u00a7\u00a7301\u201314). As the estates of civil society group their\nmembers according to their common interests, and as the deputies\nelected from the estates to the legislative bodies give voice to those\ninterests within the deliberative processes of legislation, the\noutcome of this process might give expression to the general\ninterest. But Hegel\u2019s republicanism is here\nbalanced by his invocation of the familial principle: such\nrepresentative bodies can only provide the content of the\nlegislation to a constitutional monarch who must add to it\nthe form of the royal decree\u2014an individual \u201cI will\n\u2026\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7275\u201381). To declare that for Hegel\nthe monarch plays only a symbolic role here is to miss\nthe fundamentally idealist complexion of his political philosophy. The\nexpression of the general will in legislation cannot be thought of as\nan outcome of some quasi-mechanical process: it must\nbe willed. If legislation is to express the general will,\ncitizens must recognize it as expressing their wills; and\nthis means, recognising it as willed. The monarch\u2019s\nexplicit \u201cI will\u201d is thus needed to close this recognitive\ncircle, lest legislation look like a mechanical compromise resulting\nfrom a clash of contingent interests, and so as\nactively willed by nobody. Thus while Hegel is critical of\nstandard social contract theories, his own conception of\nthe state is still clearly a complicated transformation of those of\nRousseau and Kant.\nPerhaps one of the most influential parts of\nHegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right concerns his analysis of\nthe contradictions of the unfettered capitalist economy. On the one\nhand, Hegel agreed with Adam Smith that the interlinking of productive\nactivities allowed by the modern market meant that \u201csubjective\nselfishness\u201d turned into a \u201ccontribution towards the\nsatisfaction of the needs of everyone else\u201d (PR: \u00a7199). But\nthis did not mean that he accepted Smith\u2019s idea that this\n\u201cgeneral plenty\u201d produced thereby diffused (or\n\u201ctrickled down\u201d) though the rest of society. From within\nthe type of consciousness generated within civil society, in which\nindividuals are grasped as bearers of rights abstracted\nfrom the particular concrete relationships to which they belong,\nSmithean optimism may seem justified. But this simply attests to the\none-sidedness of this type of abstract thought, and the need for it to\nbe mediated by the type of consciousness based in the family in which\nindividuals are grasped in terms of the way they belong to\nthe social body. In fact, the unfettered operation of the\nmarket produces a class caught in a spiral of poverty.\nStarting from this analysis, Marx later used it as evidence of the\nneed to abolish the individual proprietorial rights at the heart of\nHegel\u2019s civil society and socialise the means of\nproduction.  Hegel, however, did not draw this conclusion. His\nconception of the exchange contract as a form of recognition that\nplayed an essential role within the state\u2019s capacity to provide\nthe conditions for the existence of rational and free-willing subjects\nwould certainly prevent such a move. Rather, the economy was to be\ncontained within an over-arching institutional framework of the state,\nand its social effects offset by welfarist intervention. Some of\nHegel\u2019s most telling criticisms of the unmediated effects of\nmodern civil society concern those on the psychological lives of\nindividuals. Recently, an approach to social reality with Hegelian\nprovenance that uses the notion of recognition to articulate such\npathologies has been developed by Axel Honneth (2010),\ntestifying to the continuing relevance of Hegel\u2019s analyses.\nPhilosophy of History\nThe final 20 paragraphs of the Philosophy of Right (and\nthe final 5 paragraphs of objective spirit section of\nthe Encyclopaedia) are devoted to world history\n(die Weltgeschichte), and they also coincide with the point\nof transition from objective to absolute spirit. We have\nalready seen the relevance of historical issues for Hegel in the\ncontext of the Phenomenology of Spirit, such that a series of\ndifferent forms of objective spirit can be grasped in terms of the\ndegree to which they enable the development of a universalizable\nself-consciousness capable of rationality and freedom. Hegel was to\nenlarge on these ideas in a lecture series given five times during his\nBerlin period, and it was via the text assembled on the basis\nof these lectures by his son Karl, that many readers would be\nintroduced to Hegel\u2019s ideas after his death.\nWorld history is made up of the histories of particular\npeoples within which spirit assumes some \u201cparticular principle\non the lines of which it must run through a development of its\nconsciousness and its actuality\u201d (PM: \u00a7548). Just the same\ndialectic that we have first seen operative among shapes of\nconsciousness in the Phenomenology and among categories or\nthought-determinations in the Logic can be observed here. An\nhistorical community acts on the principle that informs its\nsocial life, the experience and memory of this action and the\nconsequences it brings\u2014a memory encoded in the stories that\ncirculate in the community\u2014results in this principle becoming\navailable for the self-consciousness of the community, thus breaking\nthe immediacy of its operation. This loss of immediacy brings\nabout the decline of that community but gives rise to the principle of\na new community:\nin rendering itself objective and making this its\nbeing an object of thought, [spirit] on the one hand destroys the\ndeterminate form of its being, and on the other hand gains a\ncomprehension of the universal element which it involves, and thereby\ngives a new form to its inherent principle \u2026 [which] has risen\ninto another, and in fact a higher principle.  (PWH: 81)\n\n\nThis dialectic linking concrete communities into a\ndevelopmental narrative which shows\nthe path of liberation for the spiritual\nsubstance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is\nrealized in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness\nand self-consciousness. (PM: \u00a7549)\n\n\nIt is a dialectic, however, which only passes\n through some communities. Hegel\u2019s is a\n clearly Eurocentric account of history.\nIt is thus that \u201cthe analysis of the successive grades [of\nuniversal history] in their abstract form belongs to logic\u201d\n(PWH: 56), but once more, it must be stressed that, as with philosophy\nof nature, philosophy of history is not meant to somehow\nmagically deduce actual empirical historical phenomena, like\nKrug\u2019s pen; rather, it takes the results of actual empirical\nhistory as its material and attempts to find exemplified within this\nmaterial the sorts of categorial progressions of the logic. Thus the\nactivity of the philosophical historian presupposes that of\n\u201coriginal\u201d and \u201creflective\u201d historians (PWH:\n1\u20138). The actual world is full of contingencies from which\nempirical historians will have already abstracted in constructing\ntheir narratives, for example, when writing from\nparticular national perspectives. To grasp\nhistory philosophically, however, will be to grasp it\nfrom the perspective of world-history itself, and this\nprovides the transition to absolute spirit, as world history\nwill understood in terms of the manifestation of what from a religious\nperspective is called \u201cGod\u201d, or from a philosophical\nperspective, \u201creason\u201d. Hegel clearly thinks that there is\na way of cognitively relating to history in a way that goes beyond the\nstandpoint of consciousness and the\nunderstanding\u2014the standpoint of what we now think of as\ninforming scientific history. From the perspective of consciousness\nhistory is something that stands over against me qua\nsomething known, but from the standpoint\nof self-consciousness I grasp this history as the history of\nthat which contributes to me, qua rational and free\nbeing.\n3.2.3 Philosophy of Absolute Spirit\nThe subject matter of the final 25 paragraphs of\nthe Encyclopaedia Philosophy of Spirit, Absolute\nSpirit, came to be expanded massively into the contents of\nthree different lectures series on philosophy of art, religion, and\nhistory of philosophy given multiple times during Hegel\u2019s decade in\nBerlin. Assembled and published in the years immediately following his\ndeath, these were the works through which Hegel was to become known as\nperhaps the most significant synoptic theorist of these cultural\nphenomena. Rather than to attempt to capture the richness of his\nthought here in a few paragraphs, which would be bound to be futile, I\nwill simply try to allude to how this material is meant to draw upon\nthe conceptual resources noted so far.\nArt\nHegel was writing in a time of intense development of ideas about\nthe arts. Kant had treated aesthetic experience largely in relation to\nthe experience of the beauty of nature, but for Hegel aesthetics\nbecomes primarily about art. The reason for this is simple:\nart is an objective medium in which a community collectively reflects\nupon itself, and the art of historical peoples is to be understood\nas the attempt to bring before the consciousnesses of its members the\ntotality of what is. It is as art that \u201cconsciousness\nof the Absolute first takes shape\u201d (PM: \u00a7556). The\npeculiarity of art lie in the sensuousness of the medium in\nwhich its content is objectified.\nIn the 1790s, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel had given\naesthetics an historical dimension, distinguishing the forms of\nancient and modern art in terms of the contrasts\nna\u00efve\u2013sentimental and classical\u2013romantic\nrespectively. Hegel adopts Schlegel\u2019s terminology to distinguish\nas classical the art that thrived in the Greek and Roman\nworlds from the romantic art of post-classical\ntimes. Again, the romantic or modern here will be characterized by the\ndepth of a form of individual subjective consciousness that\nis largely missing in antiquity. But those in Greek antiquity,\nwhere psychological determinations were closer\nto anthropological ones, had lived with a comfortable felt\nunity between spirit and body and between the individual and\nsociety. A characteristic of the Greeks was their\nHeimatlichkeit\u2014their collective feeling\nof being at home in the world as they were each\nat home in their bodies. Modern subjectivity is thereby\npurchased as the expense of a sense of abstraction\nand alienation from the actual world and from the\nself\u2014a consequence of the way the modern subject has become\nrelated to his or her body in a different way.\nHegel, influenced by the work of a former colleague, the Heidelberg\nphilologist Friedrich Creuzer, adds to Schlegel\u2019s categorization\nof art forms by positing a further category of symbolic\nart, characterizing the material cultures of ancient Eastern\ncivilizations such as Persia, India and Egypt. The symbolic art of\npantheistic religions of the East used natural elements to\nsymbolize the gods of their cultures: Zoroastrianism had taken light,\nfor example, to symbolize the divine (Aes I: 325), and animal worship\nwas found in the Egyptians (Aes I: 357). But such\nactual things had to be distinguished from what was meant to\nbe symbolized by them, so violence had to be done to such natural\nforms in attempts to represent the absolute\u2014such cultural\nproducts thus becoming \u201cbizarre, grotesque, and tasteless\u201d\n(Aes I: 77), This, however, undermined their initial function, and the\nGreeks were able to offer a dialectical solution to this\ncontradiction. They gave expression to the Absolute or\nthe Idea by taking as its material the\nspecifically human form, but only on condition of its being\nrendered \u201cexempt from all the deficiency of the purely sensuous\nand from the contingent finitude of the phenomenal world\u201d. But\neven as idealized in Greek sculpture, say, the represented Greek god\nis still an object of \u201cna\u00efve intuition and sensuous\nimagination\u201d (Aes I: 77\u20138), and as such the classical gods\ncontained the germ of their own decline as they could not evade\nthe finitudes incidental to anthropomorphism\n[which] pervert the gods into the reverse of what constitutes the\nessence of the substantial and Divine (Aes I: 502\u20134)\n\n\nA new form of art will be needed to resolve these contradictions, and\nthis is provided by romantic art. But the material for this\nform will not come from within art itself. While Greek art can be\nunderstood as simultaneously belonging to aesthetic and religious\nrealms, romantic art results from a fission within the symbolic realm\nof what in the Phenomenology Hegel had treated as a single\ncategory, Art-Religion. The transition from classical art to romantic\nart represents both a liberation of art from religion and of religion\nfrom art and the sensuous. Thus Christianity, whose rituals centered\naround the myth of God becoming man in the person of Jesus, had\navoided the type of reliance on the beautiful productions of art in\nthe way that characterized Greek religions. The shift from classical\nto romantic art, then, represents a broader shift between a culture\nwhose final authority was an aesthetic one and a culture in which this\nauthority was handed over to religion, and thus represents a shift in\nthe authoritativeness of different cognitive forms. This loss of\nultimate authority is the meaning of Hegel\u2019s often misunderstood\nthesis of the death of art.\nFor further discussion, see the entry on \nHegel\u2019s aesthetics.\nReligion\nIt is well known that after Hegel\u2019s death in 1831, his\nfollowers soon split into left, centre and right\nfactions over the issue of religion. A dispute over an\nappropriately Hegelian philosophical attitude to religion had been\nsparked by the publication in 1835\u20136 of David\nStrauss\u2019s The Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined\u2014the conservative right claiming that\nHegelianism reflected Christian orthodoxy, the left seeing it\nas a humanistic doctrine concerning the historical emancipation of\nmankind. In fact the implications of Hegel\u2019s philosophy for\nreligious belief had been contentious since his rise to prominence in\nthe 1820s. While officially declaring that philosophy and religion had\nthe same content\u2014God\u2014Hegel claimed\nthat the conceptual form of philosophy dealt with this\nconcept in a more developed way than that which was achievable in the\nimagistic representational form of religion. Many opponents were\nsuspicious that the concept of God was emptied of its\nproper meaning in the process of Hegel\u2019s philosophical\ntranslations and Hegel was suspected by some of pantheism or\natheism. Ultimately, then, the source of the corrosive effects of\nHegel\u2019s philosophy on religion indeed could appear to be the\ninsistence that the content of religious belief, like everything else,\nbe grounded on rational, in fact logical,\nconsiderations\u2014the logical coherence of the system of philosophy\nitself\u2014rather than on anything like revelation.\nIn the writings he had produced in the 1790s Hegel had shown a\nclear attraction to the type of folk art-religions of ancient Greece\nin contrast to Christianity, whose other-worldly doctrines did not\nreflect the kind of Heimatlichkeit he valued in\nthe ancient world, and it is common to see Hegel\u2019s later embrace\nof the Christianity he described as \u201cthe consummate religion\u201d as an\nexpression of a cultural and political conservatism of his later\nyears. This under-estimates the complexity of Hegel\u2019s evolving\nviews on both philosophy and religion, however. The limitations of\nGreek at-homeness in the world had to do with the inability\nof Greek life and thought to sustain that dimension of human existence\nthat is reflected in the category of singularity of the\nsubject.  The fate of Socrates had thus represented the ultimate\nincompatibility with the Greek form of life itself of the type of\nindividual, reflective individual who could reflectively\nbring any belief into question and take a stand against\nconvention. Similar incompatibilities could be seen reflected in Greek\ntragedies such as Antigone.\nWith the decline of the Greek world and the rise of the Roman one,\nmovements such as Stoicism and Christianity would come to give\nexpression to an individual point of view, but under the social\nconditions of Rome or the Middle Ages such a subjective point of view\ncould only be an alienated one attracted to what, in contrast to Greek\nconcreteness, would be seen as abstractions. Prior to the modern world\nthere would be no real place in either everyday life or in\nphilosophical culture for any non-alienated versions of the\nreflective or subjective position that had first emerged with\nSocrates\u2014no form of life in which this individual dimension of\nhuman subjectivity could be at home. But\nChristianity marked a type of advance over Stoicism in that its\ndoctrines of the nature of a good life had a this\nworldly exemplar. Thus in describing the doctrine of the\nStoic sage, Hegel seemed fond of quoting Cicero\u2019s dictum\nthat nobody can say who this sage is (LHP II: 250\u20131,\n256). It was the abstractness of the Stoic\u2019s conception of the\ngood man that was answered by the new religious cult centred on the\nlife of the historical Christ.\nIn this sense Christianity marked a definite advance over the more\nintuitively based religious cults to which Hegel had been attracted in\nhis youth, but it would only be in the modern world that the content\nof the core ideas of Christianity could be given proper\nexpression. Thus Hegel treats medieval Catholicism as still caught in\nthe abstractions of a transcendent realm and as caught up in a type of\nliteral reading of this\nreligion\u2019s Vorstellungen\u2014its\npictures. These need to become conceptualized, and this\nhappens under modern Protestantism, and this, for Hegel, requires a\ntype of demythologization of the religious content\nhanded down from the past. Christ must somehow come to stand as an\nexample of the human kind in general, which is the ultimate bearer of\nthe status of being the son of God. Once more, it is the\npurported singularity of the category son of God\nthat must be brought back into relation to the universality\nof the human genus. It is the nature of this result that\ndivided Hegel\u2019s followers into their right and\nleft camps. The understanding of what Hegel means by the\nconcept religion in turn becomes tied to understanding what\nhe means by philosophy. Appropriately the Philosophy of\nReligion thus passes over into the final form of Absolute\nSpirit, Philosophy\u2014a science that is the \u201cunity of\nArt and Religion\u201d (PM: \u00a7572). The mere six paragraphs devoted to this\nscience in the Encyclopaedia and dealing almost exclusively\nwith the relation of philosophy to religion were to be expanded into\nthe massive posthumously published three volumes on the\n(philosophical) history of philosophy based on various sources\nincluding student transcripts for his lecture series given in\nBerlin.\nHistory of Philosophy\nIn Hegel\u2019s time, the idea that philosophy had a\nhistorical development had only recently come into focus. Both Fichte\nand Schelling had discussed the idea of a history of\nreason following Kant\u2019s allusion to such a notion in the\nclosing pages of Critique of Pure Reason, and systematic\napproaches to the history of philosophy had emerged like that of\nW.G. Tennemann, who presupposed a type of Kantian framework. Clearly\nHegel\u2019s history of philosophy would be a present-centered one,\nin which the philosophical narrative would reveal a development up to\nthe point represented by his own philosophy as its\nculmination. It is thus predictably Eurocentric: philosophy\n\u201ccommences in the West\u201d because the West is where\n\u201cthis freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth\u201d\n(LHP I: 99). There is an important caveat to add here,\nhowever. Philosophy is often identified with the capacity\nfor abstract thought, and this is not confined to Europe and\nits history. Rather, it is typical of eastern cultures like\nthose of India and China. As we have seen in the context\nof art, Hegel identifies Greek culture with a type of\nat-homeness in the world\u2014what we might think of as\nthe opposite of a tendency to abstraction and its typical\nattraction to the transcendent or other-worldly.\nGreek philosophy, and so philosophy itself, starts with\nThales and Ionian natural philosophy. When Thales\nchoses water as the \u201cthe principle and substance of all\nthat is\u201d (LHP I: 175) he has abstracted the concept\nwater from the stuff immediately encountered in puddles and so\non. Subsequent attempts to specify what it is that underlies all\nthings show influences of eastern abstraction as in\nPythagoras\u2019s numericism, which is static and \u201cdestitute of\nprocess or dialectic\u201d (LHP I: 212) but later thinkers such as Zeno and\nHeraclitus grasp that which is at the heart of things in more dynamic\nways. This type of dialectical thought which grasps the unity\nof opposites, familiar from the Phenomenology and\nthe Logic, comes to fruition in Plato\u2019s\ndialogue Parmenides (LHP I: 261). What we are witnessing\nhere, of course, is meant to be a progression that in some sense\nmirrors the progression of categories in Hegel\u2019s\nown Logic, but this progression of objective content\ngets joined to another dynamic with the appearance of Socrates. \nSocrates was more than a philosopher: he was a\n\u201cworld-historical person\u201d\u2014a \u201cmain\nturning-point [Hauptwendepunkt] of spirit on itself\u201d\nexhibited itself in his philosophical thought (LHP I: 384). In short,\nSocrates had added a subjective dimension to the otherwise\nnatural moral lives of Athenian citizens, in that he had\nchallenged them to find the principles not of worldly things but\nof their own actions, and challenged them to find these\nwithin the resources of their own individual consciousnesses.\nIn him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of\nconsciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first\ninstance in him and became later on a usual thing. (LHP I: 391)\n\n\nWith this we see \u201cmoral substance [Sittlichkeit] turn\ninto reflective morality [Moralit\u00e4t]\u201d and\n\u201cthe reflection of consciousness into itself\u201d. \u201cThe\nspirit of the world here begins to turn, a turn that was later carried\nto its completion\u201d (LHP I: 407). This completion would be only\nachieved in modernity because, as we have seen, Socrates\u2019s\nchallenging of convention in terms of resources taken from individual\nconsciousness itself was incompatible with the immediacy of\nGreek Sittlichkeit.\nPlato and, especially Aristotle, represent the pinnacle of ancient\nphilosophy, but this philosophy, no matter how great,\nrepresents its time, that is, the time of the Greek form of\nspirit, raised to the level of thought. Neither Plato nor Aristotle\ncan break free in thought from the contradiction between the\nconception of autonomous subjectivity represented by Socrates and the\nessential collectivity of Greek culture. Classical Greek philosophy\nwill succumb in the same way that the Greek polis succumbs to its own\ninternal contradictions, and what will eventually replace it will be a\ntype of philosophizing constrained within the doctrinal constraints of\nthe new religion, Christianity. But Christianity, as we have seen,\ngives representation to a solution to the problem of subjectivity\nencountered in the form of Socrates.\nPhilosophy proper only thrives under conditions of\nat-homeness in the world and such conditions obtained in\nneither the Roman nor medieval world. Hegel then sees both periods of\nphilosophy as effectively marking time, and it is only in the modern\nworld that once more develops. What modern philosophy will reflect is\nthe universalization of the type of subjectivity we have seen\nrepresented by Socrates in the Greek polis and Jesus in the Christian\nreligious community. Strangely, Hegel nominates two very antithetic\nfigures as marking the onset of modern philosophy, Francis Bacon and\nthe German Christian mystic, Jacob B\u00f6hme (LHP III:\n170\u2013216).  In the 1825\u20136 lectures, from there Hegel traces\nthe path of modern philosophy through three phases: a first\nperiod of metaphysics comprising Descartes, Spinoza and\nMalebranche; a second treating Locke, Leibniz and others; and the\nrecent philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Jacobi and\nSchelling. Of course the perspective from which this narrative has\nbeen written is the absent final stage within this\nsequence\u2014that represented by Hegel himself.  Hegel concludes the\nlectures with the claim that he has\ntried to exhibit their (this series of\nspiritual configurations) necessary procession out of one\nanother, so that each philosophy necessarily presupposes the one\npreceding it. Our standpoint is the cognition of spirit, the knowledge\nof the idea as spirit, as absolute spirit, which as absolute opposes\nitself to another spirit, to the finite spirit. To recognize that\nabsolute spirit can be for it is this finite spirit\u2019s\nprinciple and vocation. (LHP 1825\u20136, III: 212)",
