    "main_text": "Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis || Virtue, Value, Status, and the \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d point reconsidered\n3.1 Virtue, Value, Status, and the \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d point reconsidered\n\nOne could take all the existing literature on human dignity and\narrange it into three groups, depending on whether any given argument\nrenders dignity as a kind of (i) virtue or quality of character; (ii)\nvalue or worth; or (iii) status or standing. Our analysis already laid\nout the most important aspects in deciding between these\nclassifications. We also noted that the trend in secular accounts is\nto articulate dignity as a kind of status rather than as a virtue or\nvalue. To this it should be added that virtue accounts make up the\nminority of all modern positions, no doubt because most contemporary\npositions eschew the hierarchical drift that comes with tying dignity\nto virtue.\n\nPerhaps less obvious in the literature, is the agreement to articulate\nwhat is distinctive about dignity, regardless of which way it is\nrendered: virtue, value, or status. This \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d\npoint is pressing, given Etinson\u2019s (2020) argument that a\nnegative analysis of dignity\u2019s fragility is crucial to\nunderstanding what is \u201cspecial\u201d about dignity as a\nnormative concept. On his view, a good theory of dignity will pick out\na \u201cmeaningful distinct set of concerns\u201d (2020: 354), if it\nis to justify using the term at all. The force of this point extends\nbeyond the question of whether fragility is a defining property of\ndignity. But to appreciate fully why, we need to contextualize it. So,\nconsider the following:\n\nThe idea that human beings are morally special or distinctive has\nfound expression in the religion, philosophy, literature, and art of\nall societies, modern and ancient. And connected to that idea and\nthose expressions is an enduring struggle to understand what this\npeculiar \u201cvalue\u201d is. Since antiquity many have leveraged\nthis idea about human distinctiveness into the idea that humans are\nsupremely valuable. The chorus in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone (c. 441 BCE), for example, lauds man as the most\n\u201cwondrous\u201d of all things in the world, a prodigy who cuts\nthrough the natural world the way a sailor cuts through the\n\u201cperilous\u201d surging seas that threaten to engulf him\n(verses 332 ff., cited in Debes 2009 at p. 52). Similarly, the\nJudeo-Christian doctrine of imago Dei trumpets human dominion\nover the earth and the distinctive value of humanity. Excluding God\nand angels, the doctrine implies that humankind is preeminently\nvaluable.\n\nAdmittedly, these are not references to theory, strictly speaking.\nHowever, the historical development of dignity has long been tangled\nup with this kind of widespread attempt to explain human\ndistinctiveness, even if only implicitly or under cognate terms like\n\u201cuniqueness\u201d (e.g., Muray 2007 and Rolston 2008). Indeed,\none might say that the most basic point of the concept of\ndignity, especially as it was molded into the category of \u201chuman\ndignity\u201d, just is to describe the distinctive virtue, value, or\nstatus of humans. From Cicero\u2019s ancient claim about the special\nworth of the \u201chuman race\u201d; to Schacter\u2019s (1983)\nanti-Waldron argument that dignity\u2019s importance outside of legal\ncontexts highlights the need \u201cto treat it as a distinct\nsubject\u201d (1983: 854); to Iglesias\u2019s (2001) attempt to\nexplain our \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d as human beings; to\nKateb\u2019s (2011) claim that human dignity involves the unique role\nhumans have as \u201cstewards\u201d of the earth\u2014in all these\narguments the distinctiveness point is in play. Or consider Simone\nWeil, writing in the shadow of World War II, and who inspired\nIglesias:\n\n\nThere is something sacred in every man, but it is not his person. Nor\nyet is it the human personality. It is this man; no more nor\nless\u2026 The whole of him. The arms, the eyes, the thoughts,\neverything. Not without infinite scruple would I touch anything of\nthis. (first published 1957 [1986: 50\u201351])\n\n\nSimilarly, Malpas (2007) explicitly argues that insofar as we are\ninvestigating human dignity, it seems we are inquiring into what is\ndistinctively valuable about \u201cbeing\u201d human, by which he\nmeans something like the experience of being human.\n\nThis said, we must understand Etinson as arguing that it is not enough\nto claim that what explains the moral distinctiveness of humans is\ntheir \u201cdignity\u201d. We have to say what about human dignity\nitself is distinctive. And we must do so in a way that would\nsubstantiate (in part or in whole) the more general claim of human\ndistinctiveness. After all, Etinson argues, not all kinds of harms to\nhumans count as harms to their human dignity. Not even all harms to\ntheir status are obviously harms to their human dignity. Slapping\nsomeone in the face is certainly an affront to their status in some\nsense, and perhaps even necessarily to their social-status dignity\n ((3)\n in the general schema), but not necessarily to their human\ndignity\n ((4)\n in the general schema). (See also, Valentini 2017.)\n\nSo, what is distinctive about human dignity itself? There is more than\none way to answer this question. Etinson\u2019s own suggestion, as we\nhave seen, is to use a negative normative lens to articulate what\nkinds of harms to humans count distinctively as harms against their\ndignity. But rather than tracing out further particular answers to\nthis question, let us note a few final general observations about the\ndistinctiveness point.\n\nFirst, most theorists of dignity do not explicitly parse out the need\nto explain the distinctiveness of dignity itself, as contrasted with\nhuman distinctiveness in general. However, I submit that explaining\nthe distinctiveness of dignity (itself) is often part of what\nmany theorists take themselves to be doing, however indirectly. In\nother words, explaining dignity\u2019s \u201cdistinct set of\nconcerns\u201d, to use Etinson\u2019s phrase, seems to be\nconstitutive of many theories of dignity. There is no space to\nsubstantiate this contention here, but we risk losing valuable\ninsights about dignity\u2019s distinctiveness if we don\u2019t take\nthis charitable approach.\n\nSecond, it is important not to run together the normative upshot of\nany claim about the grounds of dignity, with a\ndefinitional point about dignity\u2019s distinctiveness. For\nexample, if one thinks humans have dignity in virtue of their rational\nagency, then in one sense, this will entail a kind of\ndistinctiveness. For, it will necessarily inform the substance of\nwhatever rights or duties we think dignity justifies. In other words,\nthe content of such rights and duties will need to be\n\u201cdistinctively\u201d tied to rational agency, and what it means\nto protect, harm, or nurture this agency. Likewise for any other\ncandidate account of dignity\u2019s grounds. Nevertheless, this is\ndifferent than talking about distinctiveness as a defining property of\nhuman dignity. Scholars like Etinson and Killmister are trying to\narticulate the distinctive normative function that defines\ndignity, regardless of its grounds\u2014indeed, which any\nsatisfactory account of dignity\u2019s grounds must be able to\nexplain.\n\nFinally, Debes (2009) adds the following qualification to the\n\u201cdistinctiveness\u201d point:\n\n\nA proper account of dignity must pick out a distinctive value\nbelonging to humans. This is not equivalent to demanding a value that\nbelongs distinctively to humans.\n\n\nThe latter demand (which some theorists do insist on), not only\narbitrarily rules out a shared space of dignity between different\nentities but also risks ruling out the best options for\ndignity\u2019s grounds:\n\n\nFor example, if rationality should after all turn out to be the most\ndefensible basis for a theory of human dignity, we [humans]\nwouldn\u2019t want to yield it simply because we discovered that\nchimps and whales were rational or that Martians really have been\ntrying to communicate with us for millennia.
