    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories\n3. Teleosemantic Theories\n\nWhat all teleological (or \u201cteleosemantic\u201d) theories of\nmental content have in common is the idea that psycho-semantic norms\nare ultimately derivable from functional norms. Beyond saying this, it\nis hard to give a neat definition of the group of theories that\nqualify.\n\nAn appeal to functional norms can be combined with a variety of other\nideas about content-determination. For example, there can be both\nisomorphic and informational versions of teleosemantics. In the former\ncase, the proposal might be that the relevant isomorphism is one that\ncognitive systems are supposed to exploit. In the latter case, the\ntheory might say that mental content depends on the information\ncarrying, storing or processing functions of mechanisms. (The relevant\nnotion of information is variously defined but, roughly speaking, a\ntype of state or event is said to carry information about some other\nstate or event when it is caused by it or reliably co-occurs with\nit.\n\nIt is sometimes said that the role of functions in a teleological\ntheory of content is to explain how error (misrepresentation) is\npossible, rather than to explain how content is determined (Millikan\n2004, 63), but the two go hand in hand. To see this, it helps to start\nwith the crude causal theory of content and to see how the problem of\nerror arises for it. According to the crude causal theory, a mental\nrepresentation R represents that an F is present if\nand only if Rs are always caused by an F\u2019s\nbeing present. One problem with this simple proposal is its failure to\nprovide for the possibility of misrepresentation, as Fodor (1987,\n101\u2013104) points out. To see the problem, consider a mundane case\nwhere Joan\u2019s belief that there is a cat (which is usually caused\nby cats) is caused by a small fox. The crude causal theory does not\npermit this characterization of the situation because, if a small fox\ncaused Joan\u2019s belief, then belief states of this type cannot\nrepresent that a cat is present; instead, their content must be\nsomething like a cat or a small fox is present. In other\nwords, as soon as the state of a small fox\u2019s being present\ncauses Joan\u2019s belief, it is included in the truth-conditions of\nthat (type of) belief and so, on this theory, there is no logical\nspace for the possibility of error: all candidate errors are\ntransformed into non-errors by their very occurrence. Note that the\nproblem of making room for error can also be described as the problem\nof specifying the content of representations in such a way that error\nis possible. So explaining how content is determined and how the\npossibility of error are accommodated are not separate tasks.\n\nThe error problem is an aspect of what (after Fodor) is often called\n\u201cthe disjunction problem.\u201d With respect to the crude\ncausal theory, the name applies because the theory entails disjunctive\ncontents when it should not. For example, it entails that Joan\u2019s\nbelief has (something like) the content a cat or a small fox is\npresent in the case just considered.\n\nAsking how to alter the crude causal theory to allow for error is one\nplace to begin looking for a more adequate proposal. One approach\nwould be to try to describe certain situations in which only the right\ncauses can produce the representation in question and to maintain that\nthe content of the representation is whatever can cause the\nrepresentation in such situations. This is sometimes referred to as a\n\u201ctype 1 theory.\u201d A type 1 theory distinguishes between two\ntypes of situations, ones in which only the right causes can cause a\nrepresentation (\u201ctype 1 situations\u201d) and ones in which\nother things can too (\u201ctype 2 situations\u201d) (Fodor 1990b,\n60). A type 1 theory says that the first type of situation is\ncontent-determining. A type 1 teleological theory might state, for\nexample, that the content of a perceptual representation is whatever\ncan cause it when the perceptual system is performing its proper\nfunction, or when conditions are optimal for the proper performance of\nits function. Not all teleological theories of content are type 1\ntheories, however. The theory described in the next section is\narguably a variant of a type 1 theory but some of the theories\ndescribed in later sections are not.\n\nThe following sub-sections describe some key differences among\nteleological theories. It is not possible to describe all extant\ntheories but most major approaches are sketched, along with a brief\nreview of some of their strengths and weaknesses. General objections\nto teleological theories are discussed later, in\n section 4.\n",
