    "main_text": "Historical Background || Bradley\u2019s Regress Arguments in Appearance and Reality (1893)\n1.2 Bradley\u2019s Regress Arguments in Appearance and Reality (1893)\n\nBradley\u2019s original formulation of the regress arguments can be\nfound in chapters II and III of his Appearance and Reality\n(1893). Bradley starts the discussion in chapter II on\n\u201cSubstantive and Adjective\u201d, by taking as an example a\nlump of sugar. He notes that there appears to be such a thing\nas a lump of sugar and this thing appears to have qualities\nsuch as whiteness, sweetness, and hardness.\nBut\u2014asks Bradley - what is this \u201cthing\u201d that bears\nproperties? On the one hand, he thinks it is odd to assume that there\nis something to the lump of sugar beside its several qualities, thus\nimplying that postulating a property-less bearer of properties is\nincoherent. On the other hand, he notes that the lump cannot merely be\nits qualities either, since the latter must somehow be united. For\nBradley, unity or \u201ccoexistence\u201d of qualities presupposes\nrelations, which is why he next turns to examine different conceptions\nof relations.\n\nOne at a time, Bradley examines relations conceived as attributes of a\nsingle thing; relations conceived as attributes of two or more terms;\nand relations conceived as entirely \u201cindependent\u201d of their\nrelata.\n\nThe trouble with the conception of relations as attributes of a single\nthing or attributes of two or more things comes down, for Bradley, to\nthe more general problem of predication. The problem, according to\nhim, is expressed by the following question: \u201cwhat is it that we\ndo when we predicate a property of a thing?\u201d Bradley argues that\n\n\n\nif you predicate what is different, you ascribe to the subject what it\nis not; and if you predicate what is not different,\nyou say nothing at all. (Bradley 1893:17) \n\n\nTo understand what Bradley means by this, we need to keep in mind that\nhe is here presupposing a bundle view of particulars and that he is\nusing \u201cis\u201d to indicate the identity of the subject with\nthe bundle of qualities (see Wollheim (1959), Bonino (2012) and Baxter\n(1996) for an interpretation that reads his \u201cis\u201d as an\n\u201cis\u201d of identity in this context). His concern is thus\nwith the relationship between the whole, conceived as a bundle of\nqualities, and the qualities themselves. He is worried that if a given\nquality, say blackness, is different from the whole,\nand separate from it (i.e., it is not in the bundle of\nqualities that constitutes the lump of sugar), then it is wrong to\nattribute it to the whole. But if the quality, say whiteness,\nis not distinct from the whole, but just a part of the bundle, then\nthe attribution does not add anything new at all, it trivially states\nwhat is already the case.\n\nEqually troubling, for Bradley, is the conception of relations as\n\u201cindependent\u201d from their terms. Indeed, it leads to the\nfirst of the infinite regresses that Bradley discusses in these pages.\nHe writes:\n\nLet us abstain from making the relation an attribute of the related,\nand let us make it more or less independent. \u2018There is a\nrelation C, in which A and B stand; and it\nappears with both of them.\u2019 But here again we have made no\nprogress. The relation C has been admitted different from A and\nB, and no longer is predicated of them. Something, however,\nseems to be said of this relation C, and said again, of\nA and B. And this something is not to be the ascription\nof one to the other. If so, it would appear to be another relation\nD, in which C, on one side, and, on the other side,\nA and B stand. But such a makeshift leads at once to the\ninfinite process. (Bradley 1893: 18)\n\n\nIn this famous passage, Bradley does not make it sufficiently clear\nwhat exactly generates the infinite regress. He also shifts between\nthe linguistic worry about \u201csomething being said\u201d of\nrelation C and relata A and B, and the more\nsubstantial ontological worry about the unity of qualities A,\nB, and the relation C conceived as\n\u201cindependent\u201d from relata. Despite this, it seems clear\nthat for Bradley it is the assumed independence of the\nrelation C that generates the problem. An independent relation\nis, according to him, incapable of relating A and B, and\nno amount of further independent relations can do the job either, thus\ngenerating the regress that has the following structure.\n\n\nRegress 1 \u2013 against \u201cindependent\u201d relations as\nunifiers of qualities\n\nSuppose that there is an independent relation C, in which\nqualities A and B stand. \nIndependent relations are different from their relata and as such\ncannot relate.   \nTherefore, an independent relation C cannot relate A\nand B. \nNew relation D is needed to relate C, A, and\nB. \n D is an independent relation.   \nFrom 2, 4 and 5, it follows that D cannot relate C,\nA, and B.\nA new relation E is needed to\nrelate A, B, C, and D. And so on\nad infinitum.\n\n\n\nFor this argument to have some force, Bradley needs to argue in\nsupport of his conception of \u201cindependent\u201d relations as\nrelations that cannot relate. Although he offers no such argument, he\ndoes give us a clue as to what \u201creal\u201d relations ought to\nbe like: \n\n\nIf it [relation] is to be real [i.e., actually relating], it must be\nsomehow at the expense of the terms, or, at least, must be something\nwhich appears in them or to which they belong. A relation\nbetween A and B implies really a substantial foundation\nwithin them. (Bradley 1893: 18) \n\n\nThis suggests that for Bradley, \u201creal\u201d relations have to\nbe in some way ontologically grounded in their relata. Since his\n\u201cindependent\u201d relations are not conceived as grounded in\ntheir relata in such a way, they cannot relate.\n\nBradley\u2019s \u201creal\u201d relations might sound like\ninternal relations to a contemporary ear. Internal relations,\nfollowing Armstrong (1989: 43) and Lewis (1986: 62), are often\ncharacterized as relations that supervene on the intrinsic properties\nof their relata and that present no ontological addition. Common\nexamples of such relations are taller than, being the\nsame shade of blue, having the same mass. In contrast,\nexternal relations are frequently understood as relations the holding\nof which does not depend on the intrinsic features of particulars that\nthey relate; they present a genuine ontological addition (for\ndifferent ways of understanding the internal/external discussion see\nsection 1 of SEP entry on Relations). Frequently cited\nexamples of external relations are spatio-temporal relations such as\nbeing 2 feet apart, etc. Thus, in the contemporary debate,\nthe question concerning whether or not relations exist turns on the\nquestion of whether or not external relations exist (internal\nones are considered an \u201contological free lunch\u201d). But for\nBradley, it is the other way around: according to him, the only\nrelations that stand a chance at being \u201creal\u201d are the ones\nthat are ontologically founded in the terms, the internal ones. The\npeculiar way that such relations are founded in their terms for\nBradley, becomes central for the second regress, which we find in\nchapter III of Appearance and Reality.\n\nChapter III focuses on the relationship between qualities and\nrelations. The conclusion of the overarching argument in that chapter\nis that the entire relational way of thought is unintelligible and\nflawed. Bradley arrives at this conclusion by arguing first that\nqualities need relations; he then tries to prove that qualities are\nunintelligible with relations; and finally, he argues the same for\nrelations\u2014i.e., that relations need qualities but are\nunintelligible with them.\n\nBradley\u2019s starting thesis in this chapter is that qualities\nneed relations. He assumes that without relations qualities\nwould just collapse into an indistinguishable blob; thus qualities, in\norder to exist, need relations to somehow separate them out from that\nblob, i.e., to act as difference-makers. In addition, qualities need\nrelations to unify them. Thus, the demand on relations is to act as\nboth distinction-makers and as unifiers of qualities. Qualities, on\ntheir part, also have a \u201ca double character as both supporting\nand as being made by the relation\u201d (Bradley 1893:26). Qualities\nare made by relations through relations\u2019\ndifference-making role, but qualities also need to be related into a\nunified whole.\n\nFor Bradley, as we saw above, only internal relations stand a chance\nof being\n \u201creal\u201d[1]\n and, subsequently, of doing the double duty just described. At the\nsame time, Bradley\u2019s internal relations (from\nnow on, internalB relations) are meant to be\ngrounded in the proper parts of qualities (see more below on\nthis peculiar understanding of relations). But if different proper\nparts of a quality are to be truly different, they must be made\ndifferent by some additional internal relations. The latter, in\ntheir turn, must be grounded in further different proper parts of\nparts of qualities. This \u201cprocess of fission\u201d, as Bradley\ncalls it, continues ad infinitum, thus generating the second\ninfinite regress of relations in these pages, and providing Bradley\nwith the alleged \u201cproof\u201d that qualities standing in\nrelations are unintelligible.\n\nRegress 2 \u2013 against internalB relations\nas unifiers of qualities\n\n Relating relations are internalB in the sense\nthat they are grounded in parts of qualities that they\nrelate.\n Qualities need relations to differentiate them from other\nqualities. \n Qualities need relations to unite them with other qualities.\n \n From (1) and (2), it follows that a given quality A must have\na part a, which is part of the ontological ground for the\ndifference-making relation Rd, i.e., it is a\npart on which the distinctness of A from other qualities is\nbased. \n From (1) and (3), it follows that quality A must have a part\n\u03b1, which is part of the ontological ground for the unifying relation\nRu, i.e., it is a part on which the unity with other\nqualities is based. \n Parts a and \u03b1 of quality A are different. \n Difference within parts of a quality requires\ninternalB relations. \n Each of the original parts of A, namely a and\n\u03b1, must have a part that grounds the distinction of a\nfrom \u03b1, say a\u2032 and \u03b1\u2032, respectively,\nas well as a part that grounds the unity of a with \u03b1,\nsay a\u2033 and \u03b1\u2033, respectively. \n But the parts a\u2032 and a\u2033 are distinct\nand yet unified; and so are \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b1\u2033.  Thus,\neach of these parts must have further parts that ground such\ndistinctness and unity. And so on ad infinitum.\n\n\n\nThe main work in this regress is being done by premises (1), (2), and\n(3). It is thus quite unfortunate that Bradley does not spend time\nsubstantiating them. This is especially needed when it comes to his\npeculiar interpretation of internality of a relation as being grounded\nin proper parts of qualities. For why not claim that the quality in\nits entirety can act as part of the ground (the other part being the\nother quality or qualities) for different internal relations? This\nwould certainly be more in keeping with the contemporary understanding\nof internality of a relation and it could stop the regress. To this\nsuggestion, Bradley would probably respond by reiterating the\nunintelligibility of the idea that the very same quality can serve as\npart of an ontological ground for distinctness from other qualities\nas well as part of an ontological ground for the unity with\nother qualities. In response to this, one could challenge\nBradley\u2019s reliance on the assumption that relations need to\naccount for difference between qualities, as well as for their unity.\nIn fact, it would be much simpler to claim that, say,\nwhiteness and sweetness are different not because\nthere is a difference-making part in them, but simply because\nthey are, in their entirety, intrinsically different.\nIntrinsic difference of qualities could be Bradley\u2019s bottom\nline, a primitive of the theory and it would eliminate the need for\nrelations as difference-makers, thus rejecting premise (2) above.\n\nOne possible interpretation (see Perovic 2014: 381) of why Bradley\ndoes not wish to take distinctness of qualities as ontologically\nprimitive is that he might already be presupposing a primitive which\nis contrary to it\u2014a monistic undifferentiated whole. From such\nmonistic perspective, it would then seem that differentiation of\nqualities would need an explanation and an ontological ground, whereas\nthe lack of differentiation would appear to be an ontological default,\nrequiring no explanation at all. However, although this interpretation\nwould help us understand better why Bradley might have assumed that\nrelations need to act as difference-makers for qualities, it is\ncertainly not terribly charitable to Bradley; that is, it would assume\nthat Bradley had already question-beggingly presupposed monism as the\ndefault ontological position in his arguments against\nrelations.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s consider the third and final regress brought\nforward by Bradley in chapter III. After claiming that relations are\nunintelligible without qualities, he wants to show that the way\nrelations stand to qualities is equally unintelligible. He writes:\n\n\nIf it [relation] is nothing to the qualities, then they are not\nrelated at all; and, if so, as we saw, they have ceased to be\nqualities, and their relation is a nonentity. But if it is to be\nsomething to them, then clearly we now shall require a new\nconnecting relation. For the relation hardly can be the mere adjective\nof one or both of its terms; or, at least, as such it seems\nindefensible. And, being something itself, if it does not itself bear\na relation to the terms, in what intelligible way will it succeed in\nbeing anything to them? But here again we are hurried off into the\neddy of a hopeless process, since we are forced to go on finding new\nrelations without end. The links are united by a link, and this bond\nof union is a link which also has two ends; and these require each a\nfresh link to connect them with the old. (Bradley 1893:\n27\u201328)\n\n\nThe regress presented here is somewhat similar to the one expressed in\nRegress 1 above. In both cases relations are assumed to be\nincapable of relating. In Regress 1, however, Bradley\nexplicitly targeted only the \u201cindependent\u201d relations.\nHere, Bradley is assuming the results of his previous arguments, and\nattacking all relations, i.e., relations as such.\n\nRegress 3 \u2013 against relations as such as unifiers of\nqualities\n\n Suppose that there is a relation R uniting\nqualities A and B.\n\n If R is nothing to A and B, they are not\nrelated. \n If R is something to A and B, then R\nitself is something. \n If R is something itself then it cannot relate and needs\nfurther relations, such as R\u2032 to relate it to A\nand B. \n The same process is then repeated with R\u2032 and\nfurther relations, ad infinitum.\n\n\n\nIn this regress, Bradley is employing the phrases \u201cbeing nothing\nto the qualities\u201d and \u201cbeing something to the\nqualities,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t explain what he means by these\nphrases. If, however, Bradley is to be consistent with his previous\nclaims, relations that are \u201cnothing to the qualities\u201d have\nto be his internalB relations which he dismissed\nwith Regress 2, and relations that are \u201csomething to\nthe qualities\u201d have to be his \u201cindependent\u201d\nrelations which he dismissed with Regress 1.\nWe should thus read premise\n(2) in Regress 3 as follows: if R is an\ninternalB relation, A and B will end\nup not just not related, but will instead end up in the infinite\nprocess of division, as seen in Regress 2. If, on the other\nhand, R is something to A and B, as in\npremise (3) in Regress 3, it itself has to be\nsomething\u2014that is, it is, in Bradley\u2019s terminology a\nnon-internal, \u201cindependent\u201d relation. And\n\u201cindependent\u201d relations, as we have seen in Regress\n1, cannot relate and no amount of further independent relations\ncan relate either.\n\nAfter presenting Regress 3, Bradley believes that he has\nsucceeded in showing that the entire relational way of thought is\nflawed and that relations as such should be relegated to the sphere of\nappearance, rather than to reality. Central to arriving at such a\nconclusion has been his assumption that what he calls\n\u201cindependent\u201d relations cannot relate. It seems as if\nBradley simply did not know how to think of such entities and often\nresorts to metaphors and talks about links needing further links at\ntheir ends and insists on our inability to show how \u201csolid\nthings\u201d can be joined to other \u201csolids\u201d (cf. Bradley\n1893: 28). As these metaphors indicate, Bradley\u2019s worry seems to\nbe that if relations are conceived of as independent from the terms\nthat they relate, they themselves will become just like the terms that\nneed relating and this way they will lose their relating power.\n",
