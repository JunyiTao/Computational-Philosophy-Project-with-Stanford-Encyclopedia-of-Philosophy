It is best to start with the\nextensive but problematic later evidence and work back to the earlier\nreliable evidence. The most detailed, extended and hence most\ninfluential accounts of Pythagoras\u2019 life and thought date to the third\ncentury CE, some 800 years after he died. Diogenes Laertius\n(ca. 200\u2013250 CE) and Porphyry (ca. 234\u2013305 CE) each wrote\na Life of Pythagoras, while Iamblichus (ca. 245\u2013325 CE)\nwrote On the Pythagorean Life, which includes some biography\nbut focuses more on the way of life established by Pythagoras for his\nfollowers. All of these works were written at a time when Pythagoras\u2019\nachievements had become considerably exaggerated. Diogenes may have\nsome claim to objectivity, but both Iamblichus and Porphyry have\nstrong agendas that have little to do with historical\naccuracy. Iamblichus presents Pythagoras as a soul sent from the gods\nto enlighten mankind (O\u2019Meara 1989, 35\u201340).  Iamblichus\u2019 work\nwas just the first in a ten volume work, which in effect\nPythagoreanized Neoplatonism, but the Pythagoreanism involved was\nIamblichus\u2019 own conception of Pythagoras as particularly concerned\nwith mathematics rather than an account of Pythagoreanism based on the\nearliest evidence. Porphyry also emphasizes Pythagoras\u2019 divine aspects\nand may be setting him up as a rival to Jesus (Iamblichus 1991,\n14). These three third-century accounts of Pythagoras were in turn\nbased on earlier sources, which are now lost. Some of these earlier\nsources were heavily contaminated by the Neopythagorean view of\nPythagoras as the source of all true philosophy, whose ideas Plato,\nAristotle and all later Greek philosophers plagiarized.  Iamblichus\ncites biographies of Pythagoras by Nicomachus of Gerasa and a certain\nApollonius (VP 251 and 254) and appears to have used them\nextensively even where they are not cited (Burkert 1972a, 98\nff.). Nicomachus (ca. 50\u2013ca.150 CE) assigns Pythagoras a\nmetaphysics that is patently Platonic and Aristotelian and that\nemploys distinctive Platonic and Aristotelian terminology\n(Introduction to Arithmetic I.1). If the Apollonius cited by\nIamblichus is Apollonius of Tyana (1st CE), his account will be\ninfluenced by his veneration of Pythagoras as the model for his\nascetic life, but some scholars argue that Iamblichus is using an\notherwise unknown Apollonius (Flinterman 2014, 357). Porphyry\n(VP 48\u201353) explicitly cites Moderatus of Gades as one\nof his sources. Moderatus was an \u201caggressive\u201d\nNeopythagorean of the first century CE, who reports that Plato,\nAristotle, and their pupils Speusippus, Aristoxenus and Xenocrates\ntook for their own everything that was fruitful in Pythagoreanism,\nleaving only what was superficial and trivial to be ascribed to the\nschool (Dillon 1977, 346). Diogenes Laertius, who appears to have less\npersonal allegiance to the Pythagorean legend, bases his primary\naccount of Pythagoras\u2019 philosophy (VIII. 24\u201333) on\nthe Pythagorean Memoirs excerpted by Alexander Polyhistor,\nwhich are a forgery dating sometime around 200 BCE and which assign\nnot just Platonic but also Stoic ideas to Pythagoras (Burkert 1972a,\n53; Kahn 2001, 79\u201383).\n\n\nIn the Pythagorean Memoirs, Pythagoras is said to have\nadopted the Monad and the Indefinite Dyad as incorporeal principles,\nfrom which arise first the numbers, then plane and solid figures and\nfinally the bodies of the sensible world (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 25).\nThis is the philosophical system that is most commonly ascribed to\nPythagoras in the post-Aristotelian tradition, and it is found in\nSextus Empiricus\u2019 (2nd century CE) detailed accounts of Pythagoreanism\n(e.g., M. X. 261) and most significantly in the influential\nhandbook of the differing opinions of the Greek philosophers, which\nwas compiled by Aetius in the first century CE and is based on\nthe Tenets of the Natural Philosophers of Aristotle\u2019s pupil\nTheophrastus (e.g., H. Diels, Doxographi Graeci I. 3.8). The\ntestimony of Aristotle makes completely clear, however, that this was\nthe philosophical system of Plato in his later years and not that of\nPythagoras or even the later Pythagoreans. Aristotle is explicit that,\nalthough Plato\u2019s system has similarities to the earlier Pythagorean\nphilosophy of limiters and unlimiteds, the indefinite dyad is unique\nto Plato (Metaphysics 987b26 ff.) and the Pythagoreans\nrecognized only the sensible world and hence did not derive it from\nimmaterial principles. In the Philebus, Plato himself tells a\nstory that is very much in agreement with Aristotle\u2019s report. While\nacknowledging a debt to the philosophy of limiters and unlimiteds,\nwhich is found in Aristotle\u2019s accounts of Pythagoreanism and in the\nfragments of the fifth-century Pythagorean Philolaus, Plato makes\nclear that this is a considerably earlier philosophy, which he is\ncompletely reworking for his own purposes (16c ff.; see Huffman 1999a\nand 2001). How are we to explain the later tradition\u2019s divergence from\nthis testimony of Aristotle and Plato? The most convincing suggestion\npoints to evidence that, for reasons which are not entirely clear,\nPlato\u2019s successors in the Academy, Speusippus, Xenocrates and\nHeraclides, chose to present Pythagoreanism not just as a precursor of\nlate Platonic metaphysics but as having anticipated its central\ntheses.  Thus the tradition which falsely ascribes Plato\u2019s late\nmetaphysics to Pythagoras begins not with the Neopythagoreans in the\nfirst centuries BCE and CE but already in the fourth century BCE among\nPlato\u2019s own pupils (Burkert 1972a, 53\u201383; Dillon 2003,\n61\u201362 and 153\u2013154). This view of Pythagoreanism finds its\nway into the doxography of Aetius either because Theophrastus followed\nthe early Academy rather than his teacher Aristotle (Burkert 1972a,\n66) or because the Theophrastan doxography on Pythagoras was rewritten\nin the first century BCE under the influence of Neopythagoreanism\n(Diels 1958, 181; Zhmud 2012a, 455). Aristotle\u2019s careful distinctions\nbetween Plato and fifth-century Pythagoreanism, which make excellent\nsense in terms of the general development of Greek philosophy, are\nlargely ignored in the later tradition in favor of the more\nsensational ascription of mature Platonism to Pythagoras. The evidence\nfor the early Academy is, however, very limited and some reject the\nthesis that its members assigned late Platonic metaphysics to\nPythagoras (Zhmud 2012, 415\u2013432). The key text is found in\nProclus\u2019 Commentary on the Parmenides (pp. 38.32\u201340.7\nKlibansky). Proclus quotes a passage in which Speusippus assigns to\nthe ancients, who in this context are the Pythagoreans, the One and\nthe Indefinite Dyad. Some scholars argue that this is not a genuine\nfragment of Speusippus but rather a later fabrication (see Zhmud\n2012a, 424\u2013425 and for a response Dillon 2014, 251). If the Academy\ndid not assign the One and the Dyad to Pythagoras, however, it becomes\nless clear how these principles came to be assigned to\nhim. Theophrastus assigns them to the Pythagoreans\n(Metaphysics 11a27), but since Aristotle distinguishes the\nPythagoreans from Plato on this point, Zhmud\u2019s suggestion (2012a, 455)\nthat he is following his teacher and just taking \u201cthe next step\u201d does\nnot work. Theophrastus\u2019 evidence makes best sense if we accept the\ntraditional view and suppose that it is on the authority of Plato\u2019s\nsuccessors in the Academy that he bases his departure from his\nteacher\u2019s, Aristotle\u2019s, view.\n\n\nIf we step back for a minute and compare the sources for Pythagoras\nwith those available for other early Greek philosophers, the extent of\nthe difficulties inherent in the Pythagorean Question becomes clear.\nWhen trying to reconstruct the philosophy of Heraclitus, for example,\nmodern scholars rely above all on the actual quotations from\nHeraclitus\u2019 book preserved in later authors. Since Pythagoras wrote no\nbooks, this most fundamental of all sources is denied us. In dealing\nwith Heraclitus, the modern scholar turns with reluctance next to the\ndoxographical tradition, the tradition represented by Aetius in the\nfirst century CE, which preserves in handbook form a systematic\naccount of the beliefs of the Greek philosophers on a series of topics\nhaving to do with the physical world and its first principles. Aetius\u2019\nwork has been reconstructed by Hermann Diels on the basis of two later\nworks, which were derived from it, the\nSelections of Stobaeus (5th century CE) and the Opinions\nof Philosophers by pseudo-Plutarch (2nd century CE). Scholars\u2019\nfaith in this evidence is largely based on the assumption that most of\nit goes back to Aristotle\u2019s school and in particular to\nTheophrastus\u2019 Tenets of the Natural Philosophers. Here again\nthe case of Pythagoras is exceptional.  Pythagoras is represented in\nthis tradition but, as we have seen, Theophrastus in this case either\nadopted the view that, against all historical plausibility, assigns\nPlato\u2019s later metaphysics to Pythagoras or Theophrastus\u2019 doxography on\nthe Pythagoreans was rewritten in the first century BCE. Thus, the\nsecond standard source for evidence for early Greek philosophy is, in\nthe case of Pythagoras, corrupted. Whatever views Pythagoras might\nhave had are replaced by late Platonic metaphysics in the\ndoxographical tradition.\n\n\nA third source of evidence for early Greek philosophy is regarded with\ngreat skepticism by most scholars and, in the case of most early Greek\nphilosophers, used only with great caution. This is the biographical\ntradition represented by the Lives of the Philosophers\nwritten by Diogenes Laertius. In this case we at first sight appear to\nbe in luck, at least with regard to the amount of evidence for\nPythagoras, since, as we have seen, two major accounts of the life of\nPythagoras and the Pythagorean way of life survive in addition to\nDiogenes\u2019 life. Unfortunately, these two additional lives are written\nby authors (Iamblichus and Porphyry) whose goal is explicitly\nnon-historical, and all three of the lives rely heavily on authors in\nthe Neopythagorean tradition, whose goal was to show that all later\nGreek philosophy, insofar as it was true, had been stolen from\nPythagoras. There are, however, some sections in these three lives\nthat derive from sources that go back beyond the distorting influence\nof Neopythagoreanism, to sources in the fourth-century BCE, sources\nwhich are also independent of the early Academy\u2019s attempt to assign\nPlatonic metaphysics to the Pythagoreans. The most important of these\nsources are the fragments of Aristotle\u2019s lost treatises on the\nPythagoreans and the fragments of works on Pythagoreanism or of works\nwhich dealt in passing with Pythagoreanism written by Aristotle\u2019s\npupils Dicaearchus and Aristoxenus, in the second half of the fourth\ncentury BCE. The historian Timaeus of Tauromenium (ca. 350\u2013260\nBCE), who wrote a history of Sicily, which included material on\nsouthern Italy where Pythagoras was active, is also important. In some\ncases, the fragments of these early works are clearly identified in\nthe later lives, but in other cases we may suspect that they are the\nsource of a given passage without being able to be certain. Large\nproblems remain even in the case of these sources. They were all\nwritten 150\u2013250 years after the death of Pythagoras; given the\nlack of written evidence for Pythagoras, they are based largely on\noral traditions. Aristoxenus, who grew up in the southern Italian town\nof Tarentum, where the Pythagorean Archytas was the dominant political\nfigure, and who was himself a Pythagorean before joining Aristotle\u2019s\nschool, undoubtedly had a rich set of oral traditions upon which to\ndraw. It is clear, nonetheless, that 150 years after his death\nconflicting traditions regarding Pythagoras\u2019 beliefs had arisen on\neven the most central issues. Thus, Aristoxenus is emphatic that\nPythagoras was not a strict vegetarian and ate a number of types of\nmeat (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 20), whereas Aristoxenus\u2019 contemporary,\nthe mathematician Eudoxus, portrays him not only as avoiding all meat\nbut as even refusing to associate with butchers (Porphyry, VP\n7). Even among fourth-century authors that had at least some\npretensions to historical accuracy and who had access to the best\ninformation available, there are widely divergent presentations,\nsimply because such contradictions were endemic to the evidence\navailable in the fourth century. What we can hope to obtain from the\nevidence presented by Aristotle, Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, and Timaeus\nis thus not a picture of Pythagoras that is consistent in all respects\nbut rather a picture that at least defines the main areas of his\nachievement. This picture can then be tested by the most fundamental\nevidence of all, the testimony of authors that precede even Aristotle,\ntestimony in some cases that derives from Pythagoras\u2019 own\ncontemporaries. This testimony is extremely limited, about twenty\nbrief references, but this dearth of evidence is not unique to\nPythagoras.  The pre-Aristotelian testimony for Pythagoras is more\nextensive than for most other early Greek philosophers and is thus\ntestimony to his fame.\n",
