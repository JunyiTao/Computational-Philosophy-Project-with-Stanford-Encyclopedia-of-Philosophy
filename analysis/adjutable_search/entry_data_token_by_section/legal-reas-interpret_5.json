    "main_text": "The Role of Interpretation in Legal Reasoning: || Interpretation: Desirable or Necessary? or Why Is Legal Reasoning Interpretive?\n2.5 Interpretation: Desirable or Necessary? or Why Is Legal Reasoning Interpretive?\n\n\nThe points of disagreement surveyed above speak to differing views\nregarding how judges should go about interpreting the law, and how we\nshould understand their activities. Such concerns, however, do not\ndirectly address the important question of whether there is something\nabout the nature of law which makes it either desirable or necessary\nthat interpretation should play a role in legal reasoning in the first\nplace. In other words: why is legal reasoning interpretive at all? \n\n\nRaz 1996c contends that while some conventions of legal\ninterpretation vary according to time and place, there are other\nfeatures which legal interpretation necessarily exhibits, owing to the\nnature of law itself. While we can debate about the desirability of\nconventions of interpretation falling into the former category (e.g. we\ncan consider the value of allowing the work of legal academics, or\nrecords of Parliamentary debates to serve as aids to interpretation in\na particular jurisdiction), the latter category of features leave us no\nroom for manoeuvre: courts cannot help but have recourse to them in\ninterpreting the law. According to Raz, assigning a limited role to the\nintentions of legislators in the interpretation of legislation is one\nsuch necessary feature of legal interpretation. It is, he claims,\nsimply part of our way of thinking about legislative institutions that\ntheir procedures and modes of operation are designed so as to allow\nlegislators to make the law which they intend to make. To assume\notherwise, Raz contends, is to render unintelligible any possible\njustification for entrusting law-making powers to those institutions.\nThis being so, when judges come to interpret the decisions of\nlegislative institutions, they must do so such that the law thus\ninterpreted reflects the intentions of those who made it.\n\n\nThese considerations may also seem to speak mainly to the issue of\nhow we are to go about interpreting aspects of the law. However, the\nreasons why it is important to pay attention to the intentions of\nlaw-making institutions when we interpret the law also furnish us with\nRaz's answer to the question of why legal reasoning is interpretive at\nall. We pay attention to the intentions of law-making institutions\nbecause it is important to establish which legal rules those\ninstitutions have laid down, and what they mean. In turn, it is\nimportant to establish the existence and meaning of legal rules laid\ndown by law-making institutions because of law's purportedly\nauthoritative nature. For Raz, legal institutions claim to express\nbinding and authoritative judgements regarding what ought to be done\nwhich are designed to allow people to better conform to reason if they\nfollow the decisions of the authority than if they try to follow those\nother reasons which apply to them directly (see Raz 1994, ch.10). In\ndeciding cases according to law, then, we have a responsibility to try\nto establish the existence and meaning of any purportedly\nauthoritatively binding legal rules which have a bearing on the\nsituation under consideration, and we do so by interpreting the\ndecisions of law-making institutions in a way which accords with the\nintentions of those institutions in making the decisions in question.\nFor Raz, then, it is the authoritative nature of law which explains why\nlegal reasoning is interpretive, whereas, for example, moral reasoning\nis not. Law, unlike morality, stems from social sources (on the role of\nsocial sources in understanding law, see Raz 1979 and the entry on\n legal positivism),\n from institutions\nissuing purportedly authoritative directives which claim to express a\nbinding judgement about what ought to be done. Part of our task in\nreasoning about the law is thus to establish the existence and meaning\nof those directives, and, in order to do so, we must interpret the\ndecisions of law-making institutions in accordance with the intentions\nof the law-makers in order to try to establish the content and meaning\nof the law which they intended to make (see also Raz 1996a and\n1996b).\n\n\nIt is interesting to compare Raz's stance on the reasons why legal\nreasoning is necessarily interpretive with Ronald Dworkin's views on\nthis topic. Rather than being based on the view that in ascertaining\nthe content and meaning of the law, we should look to authoritative\nsocial sources, Dworkin's contention that legal reasoning is\nnecessarily interpretive rests on an account of law which expressly\nrepudiates the Razian understanding of law as source-based. According\nto Dworkin, the view that law is to be identified by reference to\nauthoritative social sources yields a grossly inadequate account of the\nargumentative nature of legal practice, and of the nature and depth of\ndisagreement within it (see Dworkin 1986 ch.1). He contends that an\nadequate account of these features of legal practice can only be gained\nwhen we understand that law is an interpretive concept, i.e. that it is\na social practice wherein a certain interpretive attitude has taken\nhold. The attitude in question comprises two components: the assumption\nthat the practice does not merely exist, but has a purpose or point,\nand the further assumption that the rules of the practice are not\nnecessarily what they have always been taken to be, but rather are\nsensitive to, and can be revised in light of, its point (Dworkin 1986\nch.2; also, the entry on\n interpretivist theories of law).\n For Dworkin, then, it is these features of the social practice\nof law: that members of that practice dispute and disagree about what\nthe best interpretation of the rules of the practice are, in light of\nits point, which dictate that legal reasoning is necessarily\ninterpretive. Once the interpretive attitude has taken hold amongst the\nparticipants in a social practice, the only way to understand it\nadequately is to do as the participants in that practice do: i.e. join\nthe practice and make the same kind of interpretive claims concerning\nthe point of the practice, and what the rules of it are in light of\nthat point, as they do. For Dworkin, this point holds good for the\nactivities of judges and legal theorists alike: anyone reasoning about\nthe law is required to treat it as an interpretive social practice and\noffer interpretations of what it requires in light of the purpose or\npoint which they assign to it.\n",
