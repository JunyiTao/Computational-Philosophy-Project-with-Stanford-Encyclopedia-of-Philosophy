    "main_text": "Prison Writings || The Modern Prince\n3.6 The Modern Prince\n\nGramsci still considered the agent of a revolution to be, by\nnecessity, a centralized and ideologically disciplined party. But now\nhe presented the party as the vehicle of a \u201ctotal and integral\nconception of the world\u201d that, in advance of the revolution\nitself, would organize across civil society.\n\nThe character of the revolutionary party, for Gramsci, could be\ngrasped by reference to Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\u2019s treatise on\npolitical leadership, The Prince. The figure of the prince\ncombined in one person both tactical calculation and an ambition to\nlead the people in building a state (see SPN: 125). That image of\nleadership, Gramsci continued, was later exemplified in Georges\nSorel\u2019s notion of \u201cmyth\u201d, that is, a motivating\nideal or \u201cconcrete phantasy which acts on a dispersed and\nshattered people to arouse and organise its collective will\u201d\n(SPN: 126). Elaborating and diffusing \u201cconceptions of the\nworld\u201d was what modern political parties were designed to do\n(SPN: 335). Gramsci\u2019s reflections on communist party strategy\nwere therefore formulated as a treatise on what he conceived as\n\u201cThe Modern Prince\u201d (il moderno Principe).\n\nDrawing from the experience of the French Revolution, a modern Prince\n(or revolutionary party) must present itself as the type of\n\u201cJacobin force\u201d which then had \u201cawakened and\norganised the national-popular collective will, and founded the modern\nStates\u201d (SPN: 131). Its strategy could not be oriented\nexclusively to the moment of revolutionary rupture but, moreover,\n\u201cto the question of intellectual and moral reform, that is to\nthe question of religion or world-view\u201d (SPN: 132). The\nparty\u2019s aim was to realize \u201ca superior, total form of\nmodern civilisation\u201d rooted in economic relations (SPN: 133).\nYet the \u201cnational-popular\u201d dimension required it to do\nthis by transcending the corporate interests of one class alone,\npresenting its goals on a \u201cuniversal plane\u201d: \u201cthus\ncreating the hegemony of a fundamental group over a series of\nsubordinate groups\u201d (SPN: 182). The party would lead by making\nitself the repository of popular common sense, gathering the support\nof allied intellectuals, and developing its own distinct worldview\nbuilt on the philosophy of praxis. Gramsci\u2019s conception of the\nparty\u2019s role, therefore, went beyond a temporary or mechanical\nalliance of separate classes; it meant mobilizing a wholly new and\ninclusive vision of modern society.\n\nThe modern Prince was to be organized in such a way as to maintain\ncontact with workers, but also to ensure disciplined leadership. It\nwould be a party of \u201cordinary, average men\u201d, with a\nleadership \u201cendowed with great cohesive, centralising and\ndisciplinary powers\u201d, and an \u201cintermediate element\u201d\nto keep the two in mutual contact (SPN: 152\u201353). The party would\nthus be a mass-based organization under firm direction. To ensure\n\u201corganic\u201d discipline, Gramsci endorsed the principle of\n\u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d whereby decisions would be open to\ndiscussion by rank-and-file members. But, once taken, those decisions\nwould be unquestioningly obeyed. That way \u201cbureaucratic\u201d\nrigidity would be avoided and\n\n\nthere would be a continual adaptation of the organisation to the real\nmovement; a matching of thrusts from below with orders from above.\n(SPN: 188)\n\n\nThis hybrid of classically \u201cLeninist\u201d and mass-based\nmodels of the party reflected Gramsci\u2019s concern to steer a\ncourse between sectarian closure and reformist, representational\npolitics. Gramsci was not optimistic that ordinary members could\nparticipate effectively without strong direction from a disciplined\ncadre, however much he thought revolution would eventually overcome\nthe separation of leaders and led (SPN: 144). Hegemonic strategy\ninevitably meant creating a new leading elite (SPN: 340) whose\nsuperior philosophy would \u201cin the masses as such, [\u2026]\nonly be experienced as a faith\u201d (SPN: 339). Although some see in\nGramsci\u2019s politics the basis of a radically democratic politics\n(Sassoon 1987), his was not a particularly liberal conception (see\nFemia 1981: 172\u201385).\n",
