    "preamble": "\n\nLogicism is a philosophical, foundational, and\nfoundationalist doctrine that can be advanced with respect to\nany branch of mathematics. Traditionally, logicism has concerned\nitself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in a\nstronger and a weaker version.\n\nThe strong version of logicism maintains that all\nmathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a species\nof logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintains\nonly that all the theorems do. (By \u2018theorems\u2019 we\nmean results that are provable within the branch of\nmathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to those\nparts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in this\nregard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,\ncoherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be so\nreconstructed.\n\nBoth versions of logicism\u2014strong and weak\u2014maintain\nthat\n\nAll the objects forming the subject matter of those\nbranches of mathematics are logical objects; and\nLogic\u2014in some suitably general and powerful sense that the\nlogicist will have to define\u2014is capable of furnishing\ndefinitions of the primitive concepts of these branches of\nmathematics, allowing one to derive the mathematician\u2019s\n\u2018first principles\u2019 therein as results within Logic itself.\n(The branch of mathematics in question is thereby said to have been\nreduced to Logic.)\n\n\nFor the foundationalist who accepts Kant\u2019s distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm cases\nof analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meanings\nof the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, as\nKant might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations among\nthe concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branch\nof mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) or\nits theorems (weak version) are analytic.\n\nAnother consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branch\nof mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) is\nof a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds for\nnecessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledge\nconcerned.\n\nLogicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms\u2014Fregean and\nRussellian\u2014until around 1930, at which point logicism went into\ndecline, largely because of the discovery of G\u00f6delian\nincompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,\nwhich displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promising\nfoundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine of\nneo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas of\nlogicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and its\nmore substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s.\n\nThe main technical and philosophical innovation of the\nneo-logicists is their use of abstraction principles\nin order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,\nunderstood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kind\nof abstraction principle typically effects the reification of\nequivalence classes of an equivalence\n relation.[1]\n One of Frege\u2019s favorite examples involved the equivalence\nrelation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would be\nthat of the direction of a line. Thus, two lines \\(l_1\\) and\n\\(l_2\\) have the same direction just in case they are\nparallel: \n\\[d(l_1) = d(l_2) \\Leftrightarrow l_1 || l_2.\\]\n\n\nThe function denoted by the abstraction operator \\(d(\\,)\\) is here\napplied to lines, and produces directions (new abstract\nobjects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can take\nvariables as arguments.\n\nThe neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that produce\nnumbers as their values. Details of notation and method will\nbe provided in due course.\n\nThere has not been any historical trend discernible as an\nevolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incremental\nadjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, while\nmaintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an ideal\nformulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abrupt\nshifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goal\nhas remained relatively constant through such\n changes.[2]\n We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as the\ndifferent phases of logicism are recounted below.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical background\n\nKant had held that both arithmetic and (Euclidean) geometry were\nsynthetic a priori, just as\u2014for him\u2014metaphysics\nwas. Indeed, this was to explain the special status of both\nmathematics and metaphysics, so that the latter could enjoy the\nexalted status of the former. For Kant, both mathematics and\nmetaphysics afforded informative insights into the nature of reality\n(they were synthetic); yet, for all that, the rational intellect\nneeded no sensory experience in order to attain such insights (they\nwere a priori). On Kant\u2019s account, even a simple\ncomputational statement of arithmetic\u2014let alone a statement\ninvolving quantification over the natural numbers\u2014is synthetic.\nHere is how he put the matter in his Critique of Pure Reason,\nat B16:\n\n\nWe might, indeed, at first suppose that the proposition \\(7 + 5 = 12\\)\nis a merely analytical proposition, and follows by the principle of\ncontradiction from the concept of a sum of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\). But if we\nlook more closely we find that the concept of the sum of \\(7\\) and\n\\(5\\) contains nothing save the union of the two numbers into one, and\nin this no thought is being taken as to what that single number may be\nwhich combines both. The concept of \\(12\\) is by no means already\nthought in merely thinking this union of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\); and I may\nanalyze my concept of such a possible sum as long as I please, still I\nshall never find the \\(12\\) in it. (Translation by Norman Kemp\nSmith)\n\n\nKant\u2019s search for conceptual containments is confined to those\nthat he might be able to find among just the explicit constituents of\nthe proposition concerned, unmediated by any connections with related\nconcepts that do not themselves occur within the proposition. (We note\nthis in anticipation of a contrast to be made in due course with\nFrege\u2019s modification of Kant\u2019s conception of analytic\n truth.)[3]\n For Kant, the a priori character of arithmetical truth\nderives not from conceptual containments (within the proposition in\nquestion), but from the pure form of our intuition of time,\nas affording an unbounded series of successive moments. According to\nMichael Friedman, Kant held that\n\n\nonly the general features of succession and iteration in time can\nguarantee the existence and uniqueness of the sum of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\)\n\u2026; only the unboundedness of temporal succession can guarantee\nthe infinity of the number series, and so on\n \u2026.[4]\n\n\nLikewise, on Kant\u2019s account, the a priori character of\nEuclidean geometry derives from the pure form of our intuition of\nspace, which enables the thinker, correctly one may presume, to\nintuit straight lines in space as continuous.\n\nThese two pure forms of intuition\u2014time and\nspace\u2014delivered, for Kant, the theories of arithmetic and\nEuclidean geometry respectively, and endowed them both with their\na priori character. And they made possible the\nspatio-temporal manifold of intuitions (Anschauungen) which\nwould then in turn, upon structuring by the exercise of concepts of\nthe understanding (especially the concepts of substance and\ncause) make possible objective knowledge of things and events\nin the external world.\n\nThe logicists, then, could be seen as adopting Kant\u2019s\ndistinction, but applying it to radically different effect. Their\nfirst move was to argue that arithmetic, at least, is\nanalytic, not synthetic.\n\nThe doctrine of logicism had its first glimmerings in the writings of\nDedekind, but it really only came to full flowering in the work of\nFrege. In Dedekind\u2019s work, the ideas were presented in a form\naccessible to his contemporaries in the mathematical community.\nPrecise and rigorous though those ideas were, they nevertheless\nenjoyed a relatively informal presentation. No one had yet come up\nwith the idea of formal deductive systems of logic adequate for\nformalizing the mathematical reasoning of their day; so no logicist\nthesis in Dedekind\u2019s day could be formulated in the way that is\nnow familiar to us. Matters were different, of course, with Frege, for\nhis crowning achievement was a formal deductive system of logic by\nreference to which a logicist thesis could at last be expressed.\n\nNow, when crediting Frege also with the pioneering of a detailed\nexecution of a logicist program, one cannot ignore his continuing\ninsistence that the truths of Euclidean geometry were synthetic a\npriori, and founded in a completely different way from the truths\nof\n arithmetic.[5]\n Hence they were not subject to his doctrine of logicism. This is why\nwe have exercised care in our introductory characterization of the\ndoctrine of logicism, as concerned first and foremost with the truths\nof arithmetic and of real analysis.\n\nThe combined contributions of Dedekind and Frege represented a\nculmination of the trend, by their time well under way among leading\nmathematicians, towards the arithmetization of real (and\ncomplex) analysis. This trend had its beginnings in the even earlier\nworks of Gauss and Bolzano. It came to maturity in the works of Cauchy\nand Weierstra\u00df, and became the dominant paradigm in Western\nthought about the nature of mathematics. The leading idea of the\narithmetizers was that the concepts and first principles of arithmetic\nand analysis are to be found in the concepts of the understanding (as\na Kantian might put it), independently of one\u2019s geometric\nintuitions concerning any spatial or temporal continua. Arithmetic and\nanalysis are completely conceptual and logical in\ntheir axiomatic sources and in their deductive development.\n\nWe proceed now to consider Dedekind and Frege in turn.\n1.1 Dedekind\n\nIt is fair to say that Dedekind enabled the trend of arithmetization\nto culminate in the doctrine of logicism. The recommendation (or\nstatement of the methodological maxim) that one ought to\navoid all matters geometric when providing a foundation for real\nanalysis goes back at least to Dedekind, Stetigkeit und\nIrrationale Zahlen (1872). This work was published late. Its\nbreakthrough idea had come fourteen years earlier, in\n 1858.[6]\n At pages 3\u20134 Dedekind writes in an engaging and revelatory way\nof his earlier struggle in the autumn of 1858 to furnish\n\u201ceine wirklich wissenschaftliche Begr\u00fcndung der\nArithmetik\u201d (a really scientific foundation for Arithmetic\n[i.e., real\n analysis]).[7]\n\nIt is clear that Dedekind is writing on the\npresumption\u2014assumed to be so widespread as not to call\nfor any justificatory argument\u2014that one should have no\nrecourse at all to geometric intuitions or first principles when\nfounding the theory of the real numbers. This presumption, said\nDedekind, \u2018no one will deny\u2019. Dedekind wanted \u201ca\npurely arithmetical and perfectly rigorous foundation for the\nprinciples of infinitesimal analysis\u201d [Emphases\n added].[8]\n\nThe presumption receives further emphatic statement in\nDedekind\u2019s later work (1888) Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen?, which, like the earlier work, was published much later\nthan it could (or should) have been. In the preface to the first\nedition (Dedekind 1996b: 790\u20131) Dedekind writes\n\n\nIn speaking of arithmetic (algebra, analysis) as merely part of logic\nI mean to imply that I consider the number-concept entirely\nindependent of the notions or intuitions of space and\ntime\u2014that I rather consider it an immediate product of the\npure laws of thought.\u2026 It is only through the purely logical\nprocess of building up the science of numbers and by thus acquiring\nthe continuous number-domain that we are enabled accurately to\ninvestigate our notions of space and time by bringing them into\nrelation with this number-domain created in our mind.[fn] [Emphasis\nadded]\n\n\nOnce again we see the presumption at work: in laying a foundation for\nthe theory of real numbers, one must avoid any recourse to\ngeometrical intuition. To inquire how such a presumption become so\nwidespread, and in whose works it originated, is a topic outside the\nscope of the present study.\n1.2 Frege\n\nIt is clear from Frege\u2019s Preface to his Begriffsschrift\n(at pp. IX\u2013X) that he shared Dedekind\u2019s methodological\nconcerns, and that he had an eventual logicist treatment of arithmetic\nin his sights when devising his concept script. Frege distinguished\ntwo kinds of truths that require a Begr\u00fcndung\n(justification): those whose proofs could proceed purely logically;\nand those which had to be supported by experiential facts\n(Erfahrungsthatsachen). And he sought to inquire how far one\ncould succeed in capturing arithmetic by means only of inferences\nbased on the laws of thought that transcend all particularities\n(\u201cdurch Schl\u00fcsse allein \u2026, nur gest\u00fctzt auf\ndie Gesetze des Denkens, die \u00fcber allen Besonderheiten erhaben\nsind\u201d). He made it clear that he wished to get at the root\nconcept of ordering in a series, and to advance from there to\nthe concept of number. Then comes this unmistakeable echo of\nDedekind:\n\n\nIn order that, in doing this, nothing intuitive could intrude\nunnoticed, everything would turn on there being no gaps in the chain\nof inferences.\n\nDamit sich hierbei nicht unbemerkt etwas Anschauliches\neindr\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnte, musste Alles auf die L\u00fcckenlosigkeit\nder Schlusskette ankommen.\n\n\nFrege stressed that he was concerned to reveal how the analyticity of\narithmetical truths derived from their justifications. In \u00a73 of\nFrege 1884 (Grundlagen der Arithmetik) he wrote\n\n\n\u2026 these distinctions between a priori and a posteriori,\nsynthetic and analytic, concern \u2026 the justification for making\nthe judgement. \u2026 When a proposition is called \u2026 analytic\nin my sense, \u2026 it is a judgement about the ultimate ground upon\nwhich rests the justification for holding it to be true.\n\n\u2026 The problem becomes \u2026 that of finding the proof of the\nproposition, and of following it up right back to the primitive\ntruths. If, in carrying out this process, we come only on general\nlogical laws and on definitions, then the truth is an analytic\none, bearing in mind that we must take account also of all\npropositions upon which the admissibility of any of the definitions\ndepends. [Emphasis added]\n\n\nWe see, then, that Frege\u2019s conception of the analytic was\nsuitably broader than Kant\u2019s. Kant required that conceptual\ncontainments be evident within the sentence, rather than that the\nsentence be displayed as a conclusion following logically from axioms\nwhose own logical or conceptual truth was self-evident, and which\nmight contain expressions not occurring in the sentence in question.\nAs we saw from the quote from B16, Kant did not regard \u2018\\(7 + 5\n= 12\\)\u2019 as an analytic truth. The Fregean, by contrast, is able\nto exploit the internal structure of the numerals, and to invoke the\nrecursion axioms for addition (which themselves would have to have\nbeen derived in logicist\n fashion).[9]\n So, for the Fregean, even if not for Kant, \u2018\\(7 + 5 =\n12\\)\u2019 is an analytic truth. Where \\(s\\) is the successor\nfunction, Kant\u2019s example takes the more detailed form\n\n\\[sssssss0 + sssss0 = ssssssssssss0,\\]\n which is provable using the recursion axioms\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\forall x(x + 0 = x); \\\\\n&\\forall x\\forall y(x + sy = s(x + y)).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe latter axiom justifies each of the transitions below:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nsssssss0 + sssss0 &=  s(sssssss0 + ssss0) \\\\\n &= s(s(sssssss0 + sss0)) \\\\\n &= s(s(s(sssssss0 + ss0))) \\\\\n &= s(s(s(s(sssssss0 + s0)))) \\\\\n &= s(s(s(s(s(sssssss0 + 0))))\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAt this point the former axiom secures \n\\[\ns(s(s(s(s(sssssss0 + 0))))) = s(s(s(s(s(sssssss0)))))\n\\]\n\n\nHence (suppressing parentheses) we have \n\\[\nsssssss0 + sssss0 = ssssssssssss0,\n\\]\n\n\nas\n foreshadowed.[10]\n\nFrege went on in this work to give his famous elucidation of\n\u2018number of\u2019 as a concept of concepts, along with\ndevastating critiques of rival accounts of number by contemporaries in\nthe grip of psychologism, empiricism, or formalism. He kept\ntechnicalities to a minimum, in a tour de force of\nphilosophical elucidation.\n1.2.1 Numbers as higher-level concepts\n\nFrege\u2019s key insight, which he never abandoned, was first\nexpressed in \u00a746: \u201c\u2026 the content of a statement\nabout number is an assertion about a concept\u201d. By way of\nillustration: Suppose one states that\n\n\\((\\nu)\\)\nThe number of apples in the basket is (i.e., is identical\nto) the number 2.\n\n\n\\((\\nu)\\) is definitely a statement \u2018about number\u2019. Yet\nall one is saying, when asserting \\((\\nu)\\), is that\n\n\\((\\gamma)\\)\nThere are exactly two apples in the basket.\n\n\nFor Frege, \\((\\gamma)\\) is an assertion about the concept\n\u201c___is an apple in the basket\u201d. It is not an assertion\nabout the number 2, since the adjectival occurrence of\n\u2018two\u2019 in \\((\\gamma)\\) can be avoided. One could re-phrase\n\\((\\gamma)\\) as\n\n\\((\\gamma')\\)\nThere is an apple in the basket, and another apple in the basket,\nand they are the only apples in the basket.\n\n\nWe shall show how Frege\u2019s point here can be made watertight, and\ngeneral, after providing a few words of explanation about notation for\nnumber-abstraction.\n\nIn the simple example above about line-directions, the abstraction\noperator \\(d(\\,)\\) is a function sign, and does not bind any\nvariables. But with numerical abstractions, matters are\nsubtly different. Here, the abstraction operator \\(\\#\\), meaning\n\u201cthe number of \u2026\u201d, can be deployed in two different\nways. On the one hand, it can be a function symbol: if \\(F\\) is a\npredicate (resp., a second-level variable), then \\(\\#F\\) is a singular\nterm denoting the number of things falling under \\(F\\) (resp., in the\nextension assigned to the second-level\n variable).[11]\n On the other hand, the operator \\(\\#x\\) can be applied to the open\nsentence \\(\\Phi(x)\\) with \\(x\\) free, thereby binding the variable\n\\(x\\). The complex term thus formed is read as \u201cthe number of\n \\(\\Phi\\)s\u201d.[12]\n\nWith that explanation of notation in place, suppose one makes a\nstatement about number of the following form, where \\(\\#xFx\\) is the\nformal rendering of \u201cthe number of \\(F\\)s\u201d:\n\n\\[\\# xFx = 2.\\]\n\n\nThen one is thereby (says Frege) making the assertion that\n\n\\[\\exists x\\exists y(x\\ne y \\wedge Fx \\wedge Fy \\wedge \\forall z(Fz \\rightarrow(z = x \\vee z = y))).\\]\n\n\nThe concept \\(F\\) is the only one finding expression in this last\nassertion, apart from standard logical operators. Therefore the\nassertion is about the concept \\(F\\). It is in the general form of a\nnumerosity assertion, which does not necessarily refer to, or\ngeneralize about, numbers. For arbitrary \\(n\\), the logical form in\nquestion will be \n\\[\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n (\\wedge_{1\\le i\\lt j\\le n} x_i \\ne x_j \\wedge_{1\\le i\\le n} Fx_i \\wedge \\forall z(Fz \\rightarrow \\vee_{1\\le i\\le n} z = x_{i})).\\]\n\n\nOf course (returning to our example where \\(n = 2\\)), one can consider\nmatters in the converse logical direction. If one makes the numerosity\nassertion first, then one can regard that as a justifying ground for\nthe subsequent statement that the number of \\(F\\)s is identical to\n2.\n\nIf, with Frege, we countenance these two different ways of\n\u2018carving\u2019 one and the same propositional content, then we\nshall require, in whatever language is rich enough to provide the two\nforms of expression in question, the following logical equivalence,\nindicated by the two-way deducibility sign \\(\\dashv \\vdash\\):\n\n\\[\n\\#xFx = 2 \\dashv \\vdash \\exists x\\exists y(x \\ne y \\wedge Fx \\wedge Fy \\wedge \\forall z(Fz \\rightarrow(z = x \\vee z = y))).\n\\]\n\n\nAs Frege put it, the propositional content on the right-hand side has\nbeen \u2018re-carved\u2019 as the identity statement on the\nleft-hand side. One and the same thought has been presented in two\nvery different ways. They have the same truth conditions, but\ndifferent logico-grammatical forms.\n\nThe form on the right, within a language devoid of the operator\n\\(\\#\\), is completely innocent of any commitment to numbers as\nobjects. If such a language is extended, however, by adding \\(\\#\\) to\nits stock of logical expressions, then one is thereby able to express\nthe form on the left, which is number-committal.\n\nBy being aware that the concept-numerosity thought on the right can be\nrendered equivalently (in the extended language) as the\nnumber-committal thought on the left, one comes to recognize numbers\nas abstract, logical objects. In the extended language, their\nexistence can be established on purely logical grounds.\n1.2.2 Hume\u2019s Principle and the Caesar Problem\n\nIn the Grundlagen, Frege considered the following\nequivalence, known as Hume\u2019s Principle:\n\n\\[\\tag{HP} \\# xFx = \\# xGx \\leftrightarrow \\exists R(R \\text{ maps the \\(F\\)s 1-1\nonto the \\(G\\)s}).\\]\n\n\nThere are two important features to note.\n\nFirst, HP is explicitly second order on the right-hand side,\ninvolving, as it does, a second-order quantification over relations\n\\(R\\); and HP is purely logical on the right-hand side. Here,\nthe notion to be defined (the definiendum) is that of a\nrelation \\(R\\) mapping the \\(F\\)s 1-1 onto the \\(G\\)s. This can be\nspelled out in purely logical terms: every \\(F\\) bears \\(R\\) to\nexactly one \\(G\\), and every \\(G\\) is borne \\(R\\) by exactly one\n\\(F\\). In symbols, this definiens reads as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\forall x(Fx &\\rightarrow \\exists y\\forall z(z = y \\leftrightarrow \n(Gz \\wedge Rxz))) \\\\\n&\\wedge \n\\forall x(Gx \\rightarrow \\exists y\\forall z(z = y \\leftrightarrow \n(Fz \\wedge Rzx))),\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhich we shall abbreviate\n as[13]\n \n\\[\nRxy[Fx \\underset{\\text{onto}}{\\overset{1\\text{-}1}{\\mapsto}}\n Gy]. \\]\n\n\nSecondly, HP involves two predicates, \\(F\\) and \\(G\\). It does so in\norder to state an important criterion of identity for numbers\ndenoted, respectively, as \\(\\# xFx\\) and as \\(\\# xGx\\). Note that both\nterms in the identity-statement on the left-hand side are abstractive\nterms.\n\nLet us call (neo-)Fregean abstraction principles (like HP) that seek\nto specify the truth conditions of identities involving two\ndistinct abstractive terms (involving the same abstraction operator @)\ndouble-barreled abstraction principles. (Contrasting\nsingle-barreled abstraction principles for identities will be\ndiscussed\n shortly.)[14]\n Double-barreled abstraction principles have the general form\n\n\\[\n@xFx = @xGx \\leftrightarrow \\Psi(F,G),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the right-hand side expresses a second-order equivalence\nrelation \\(\\Psi\\) between \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), and is stated without use\nof \\( @\\). But that does not preclude instances of such a principle\nwhere either \\(F\\) or \\(G\\), or both, contain occurrences of\n\\(@\\).\n\nTypically these double-barreled abstraction principles are laid down\nas postulates, or axioms (or axiom schemes). But that is not\nabsolutely necessary. All that is important is whether the theory in\nquestion contains such a principle as a theorem (or theorem-scheme).\nLike the earlier abstraction principle for directions, HP is a\ndouble-barreled abstraction principle. So too is Frege\u2019s\nill-fated Basic Law V, which we shall discuss in due course.\n\nHP tells us that the numbers \\(\\#xFx\\) and \\(\\# xGx\\) will be\nidentical if and only if the predicate-extensions that they\nrespectively number are in one-one correspondence (under some\ntwo-place relation \\(R)\\). Another way of expressing this latter\ncondition is to say that \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\nequinumerous.\n\nThe basic idea of this equivalence is owed to Hume (whence the current\nname of the principle); and it had of course been exploited to great\neffect by Cantor, well before Frege wrote the\n Grundlagen.[15]\n Without the use of one-one correspondences in this way, Cantor would\nnot have been able to motivate his later groundbreaking idea that\nthere are distinct infinite numbers (see Cantor 1891).\n\nFrege considered whether HP might be laid down as a constitutive\ndefinition of numbers\u2014a definition that would give a full and\nexact characterization of their nature. But he concluded that HP could\nnot meet this more exigent, yet reasonable, demand. The reason is what\nhas now become known as the Julius Caesar Problem. Frege\ninsisted (Grundlagen, \u00a756), that our definition of\nnumber should enable us to decide that Julius Caesar is not a\nnumber. His conclusion was that HP could not enable us to do this.\n\nFor, suppose we say that if there are exactly two apples in the\nbasket, then the number of apples in the basket is Julius Caesar. For\nthe sake of consistency, it would be enough (in conformity with HP)\nsimply to make sure that one assigns the same number (i.e., Julius\nCaesar) to any other concept that is in one-one correspondence with\nthe concept \u201c\u2026is an apple in the basket\u201d. Thus, for\nexample, the number of prime numbers strictly between 4 and 8 is\nJulius Caesar. Indeed, the number of prime numbers strictly between 1\nand 4 is Julius Caesar, one of those prime numbers being Julius Caesar\nhimself!\n\nOn the one hand, HP is, to be sure, a necessary condition on number.\nIt must be satisfied by any licit interpretation of the abstraction\noperator \\(\\#\\). HP is not, however, sufficient to ensure\nthat the things denoted by terms of the form \\(\\# xFx\\) really are\nnumbers!\n\nOn the other hand\u2014as revealed in Frege\u2019s painstaking\ndeductive work\u2014HP suffices for a logicist derivation of the\nDedekind-Peano postulates for the arithmetic of natural numbers. This\nis what accounts for the vaunted status of HP in certain subsequent\nneo-logicist accounts (see\n \u00a72).\n\nBut Frege wanted more than just a logically powerful enough source for\narithmetic; he wanted, in addition, a principle that would account for\nthe metaphysical nature of numbers. They must, surely, at\nleast be abstract? Numbers are also eternal and necessary.\nThey are not located in space, and they do not enter into any causal\ninteractions. Frege therefore sought a deeper logical theory that\nmight be able to vouchsafe for numbers these latter characteristics,\nand thereby solve the Caesar Problem.\n\nUnfortunately, in this regard he arguably failed (and did so quite\nindependently of Russell\u2019s Paradox, of which more in due\ncourse). Frege thought (mistakenly, according to Dummett (1998)) that\nhe could avoid the Julius Caesar problem by identifying numbers as\nspecial kinds of classes, or extensions (of\nconcepts). In the Grundlagen, at \u00a768, he wrote\n\n\nMy definition [of Number] is \u2026 as follows:\n\n\nthe Number which belongs to the concept \\(F\\) is the extension\n[Umfang][fn.] of the concept \u201cequal\n[gleichzahlig] to the concept \\(F\\)\u201d.\n\n\n\nAnd the footnote to \u201cUmfang\u201d ends with the\nsentence \u201cI assume that it is known what the extension of a\nconcept is.\u201d For those who nevertheless needed some instruction\nin this regard, the Grundgesetze were intended to supply\nit.\n\nThe Julius Caesar problem would, in principle, bedevil any\ndouble-barreled abstraction principle. (It is not a problem\nspecifically for logicism; it is a problem for abstraction\nprinciples of a specific\n form.)[16]\n The problem can be avoided by using single-barreled abstraction\nprinciples.\n\nThe general form of a single-barreled abstraction principle, when\nexpressed by a sentence rather than by rules of inference, is\n\n\\[\nt = @xFx \\leftrightarrow \\ldots t \\ldots F\\ldots,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(t\\) is a placeholder for singular terms in general\n(including parameters), and not just for \\(@\\)-terms. The right-hand\nside may contain occurrences of \\(@\\); moreover, when taking\ninstances, expressions substituted for either \\(F\\) or \\(t\\) may\ncontain occurrences of \\(@\\). And all that is important with a\nsingle-barreled abstraction principle is whether the theory in\nquestion contains it as a theorem (or theorem-scheme).\n\nSome examples of single-barreled abstraction principles are the\nfollowing. Here, \\(\\exists !t\\) is short for \\(\\exists x x = t\\). It\nmay be read as \u201c\\(t\\) exists\u201d.\n\nFor definite descriptions (on Smiley\u2019s treatment, Smiley\n1970): \n\\[\nt = \\iota xFx \\leftrightarrow(\\exists !t \\wedge \\forall x(x = t \\leftrightarrow Fx)).\n\\]\n\n\nFor set\n abstracts:[17]\n \n\\[\nt = \\{x\\mid Fx\\} \\leftrightarrow(\\exists !t \\wedge \\forall x(x \\in t \\leftrightarrow Fx).\\]\n\n\nFor number-abstracts (on Tennant\u2019s treatment\u2014see\n \u00a74):\n \n\\[\nt = \\# xFx \\leftrightarrow \\exists R\\exists G(Rxy[Fx 1\\text{\u2013}1\nGy] \\wedge t = \\# xGx).\\]\n\n\nFor number-abstracts (on Zalta\u2019s treatment\u2014see\n \u00a75):[18]\n \n\\[\nt = \\#G \\leftrightarrow t = \\iota x(Ax \\wedge \\forall F(xF \\leftrightarrow F \\text{ is equinumerous with } G)).\\]\n\n\nThe important feature of single-barreled abstraction principles of the\nkind on which we are focusing is that they are free of ontological\ncommitment. Theories that postulate or prove them need to be\nsupplemented with specific further ontologically committal postulates\nbefore incurring commitment to the sort of entities whose broad\nlogical behavior is captured by a single-barreled abstraction\nprinciple. For example, the set-abstraction principle above merely\nplaces constraints on how sets, membership (\u2018\\(\\in\\)\u2019) and\nset-defining conditions \\(F\\) interrelate. It logically implies both\nextensionality and the conversion schemata (\u201cIf \\(u\\) is a\nmember of the set of all and only \\(F\\)s, then \\(u\\) is an\n\\(F\\)\u201d, and \u201cIf \\(u\\) is an \\(F\\), and the set of all and\nonly \\(F\\)s exists, then \\(u\\) is a member of it\u201d), but does not\nguarantee the existence of any sets\u2014not even that of\nthe empty set.\n1.2.3 The Grundgesetze\n\nThe heart of Frege\u2019s logicist achievement was deferred to the\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, the first volume of which\nappeared in 1893. This almost decade-long delay after the\nGrundlagen he explained in his foreword as being occasioned\nby some re-thinking of his Begriffsschrift (Frege\n1879)\u2014the most important innovation being the introduction of\nthe notion of, and notation for, the Werthverlauf\n(value-range, or extension) of a concept. Frege had also, by the time\nof publication of the Grundgesetze, formulated his\ndistinction between sense and reference, and decided to treat\ntruth-values as objects, and indeed as referents of sentences.\n\nHe confessed that he expected his symbolism to be a grosses\nHemmniss (great obstacle) standing in the way of the spread and\nimpact of his ideas (Frege 1893: x). On the one hand, the exacting\nnotation and absolutely rigorous and logically watertight proofs were\nessential to his logicist project. On the other hand, he feared,\nmathematicians would think metaphysica sunt, non leguntur!\n(it\u2019s metaphysics, and is not [to be] read!), and philosophers\nwould think mathematica sunt, non leguntur! (it\u2019s\nmathematics, and is not [to be] read!); (Frege 1893: xii). Poor Frege\nmight have been right. But the reason why the beef of his\nGrundgesetze was never properly digested can be read off the\nsandwiching. His foreword to Volume I ends with the confident\nwords\n\n\nThe only refutation I would acknowledge would be if someone actually\nshowed that a better and more sustainable edifice could be erected on\nother foundational convictions, or if someone were to show that my\naxioms led to obviously false consequences. But no one will succeed in\ndoing that. (Frege 1893: xxvi; author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nThis confident statement belies somewhat his own prescient misgiving\nexpressed a few pages earlier, over his Basic Law V:\n\n\nAs far as I can see, controversy could arise only over my Basic Law of\nValue-ranges (V), which perhaps has not been given special expression\nby logicians, even though one thinks of it, for example, when one\ntalks of extensions of concepts. I hold it to be purely logical.\nAnyway, this marks the place where the decision must fall. (Frege\n1893: vii; author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nAnd fall it did. Frege, it turned out, had gone in for overkill with\nthe formal system that was to vindicate his logicism. He sought to\nunify all of arithmetic and analysis within a general theory of\nclasses, or extensions (of concepts). Classes were supposed\nto be logical objects par excellence. The strategy was to\ndefine the natural numbers, say, as particular classes within a much\nmore capacious universe of abstract, logical objects. Using the\ndefinitions, one would then derive the first principles of arithmetic\n(the Dedekind-Peano axioms, say) as theorems within the theory of\nclasses. To that end one would exploit, ultimately, only the deeper\nunderlying axioms (or basic laws) governing classes themselves. For\nmore details on this strategy, see\n \u00a71.2.4.\n\nAmong these deeper axioms was Frege\u2019s ill-fated Basic Law V.\nThis, like HP, is a double-barreled abstraction principle. Basic Law\nV, however, allows for the abstraction of classes, and the\nequivalence relation by which this is effected is the relation of\ncoextensiveness among defining predicates. Frege never raised the\nJulius Caesar objection against his Basic Law V. Using modern\nnotation, Basic Law V can be stated as the following axiom schema, in\nwhich \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Psi\\) are placeholders for formulas:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{Basic Law V}\n\\{x\\mid \\Phi x\\} = \\{x \\mid \\Psi x\\} \\leftrightarrow \\forall x(\\Phi x \\leftrightarrow \\Psi x).\n\\]\n\n\nFrege was assuming a \u2018logically perfect\u2019 language, in\nwhich every well-formed term\u2014including any class-abstractive\nterm of the form \\(\\{x\\mid \\Phi x\\}\\)\u2014denotes. If, by contrast,\none countenances the possibility that certain well-formed singular\nterms in one\u2019s language might not denote objects, then\none has to employ a different kind of logic\u2014a so-called\nfree logic. (It is \u2018free\u2019 of the background\nassumption that all singular terms denote.) Such a logic qualifies the\nquantifier rules with \u2018existential presuppositions\u2019\nconcerning the terms involved. For example, instead of being able to\ninfer directly from \u201cfor all \\(x, F(x)\\)\u201d to\n\u201c\\(F(t)\\)\u201d, as one may, when using the unfree\nlogic of a logically perfect language: \n\\[\\frac{\\forall xF(x)}{F(t)}\\]\n\n\none needs, in the case of a free logic dealing with possibly\nnon-denoting terms, to ensure that the singular term \\(t\\)\ndenotes: \n\\[\n\\frac{\\forall xF(x) \\qquad \\exists !t}{ F(t)}\n\\]\n\n\nThe reader is reminded that \\(\\exists !t\\), to be read \u201c\\(t\\)\nexists\u201d, is short for \\(\\exists x\\, x = t\\). Similar\nmodifications are required for the other quantifier rules.\n\nEven if Frege had not been assuming a logically perfect\nlanguage, and had instead been using a free logic, Basic Law V would\nstill have committed him to the existence of the class of all\n\\(\\Phi\\)s, whatever the defining formula \\(\\Phi\\) might be. The proof\nproceeds as follows.\n\n\nProof. Note, first, that it is a logical truth\nthat \n\\[\n\\forall x(\\Phi x \\leftrightarrow \\Phi x).\n\\]\n\n\nBy Basic Law V in the right-to-left direction, taking \\(\\Phi\\) for\n\\(\\Psi\\), it follows that \n\\[\n\\{x \\mid \\Phi x\\} = \\{x \\mid \\Phi x\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nBut in free logic, an identity holds only if its terms denote.\nHence \n\\[\n\\exists y(y = \\{x \\mid \\Phi x\\}). \n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nThis schema is known nowadays as \u2018Na\u00efve\nComprehension\u2019. (Comprehension is the abstraction of sets or\nclasses.) Basic Law V committed Frege to claiming that, corresponding\nto any defining predicate \\(\\Phi\\), there exists the class of\nall and only those things that satisfy \\(\\Phi\\).\n\nNote that any double-barreled abstraction principle for an\nabstraction operator \\(@\\), whose right-hand side\n\nadverts to concepts or predicates \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Psi\\) and\nis logically true upon taking \\(\\Phi\\) for \\(\\Psi\\),\n\n\nwill generate existential commitment to a denotation for any\nwell-formed abstract term \\(@x\\Phi x\\). This is because, in light of\n(ii), the self-identity \\(@x\\Phi x = @x\\Phi x\\) will also be logically\ntrue. And \\(@x\\Phi x = @x\\Phi x\\) is true only if \\(\\exists!@x\\Phi\nx\\). This consideration holds for any defining predicate\n\\(\\Phi\\). This invites the objection, raised both by Tennant (1987:\n236) and by Boolos (1987: 184) that in certain conspicuous cases there\nis no a priori justification for commitment to the existence\nof denotations for these terms, in the case of particularly\nproblematic concepts \\(\\Phi\\) (such as self-identity). This was the\nearliest form of the \u2018Bad Company\n objection\u2019.[19]\n1.2.4 Frege\u2019s treatment of the natural numbers\n\nWe shall not dwell on the peculiarities of Frege\u2019s class theory,\nbut shall try instead to set out the overall shape of the leading\nideas in Frege\u2019s account, as they were set forth informally in\nthe Grundlagen and executed formally in the\nGrundgesetze.\n\nFirst Frege had to identify \\(0\\), which he defined as the number of\nany empty concept. A necessarily empty concept is that of\nnon-self-identity: \n\\[\n0 =_{df} \\#x(x \\ne x).\n\\]\n\n\nNext Frege had to specify what it was for one natural number to be the\nsuccessor of another, or the next largest natural\nnumber. How might one define what it is for \\(m\\) to immediately\nsucceed \\(n\\)? The answer is found by appeal to concepts \\(F\\)\nand \\(G\\), say, that respectively enjoy \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) as their\n(finite) cardinals. There must be exactly one more object falling\nunder the concept \\(F\\) than there are objects falling under the\nconcept \\(G\\). And this will consist in there being a one-one\ncorrespondence \\((R\\), say) between all the \\(G\\)s and all but one of\nthe \\(F\\)s.\n Formally:[20]\n \n\\[ \\begin{align}\nm &\\text{ immediately succeeds }  n \\leftrightarrow \\\\\n&\\ \\exists G(n = \\# xGx \\wedge \\exists F(m = \\# xFx \\\\\n&\\ \\wedge\\ \\exists R \\exists y (Fy \\wedge Rzw[Gz \\underset{\\text{onto}}{\\overset{1\\text{-}1}{\\mapsto}} (Fw \\wedge w \\ne y)]))).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIt is easy to show that \\(n\\) has exactly one immediate successor.\nThat is, if \\(m\\) immediately succeeds \\(n\\), and \\(m'\\) immediately\nsucceeds \\(n\\), then \\(m = m'\\).\n\nWhat, now, can we say about the extension of the concept\n\u2018natural number\u2019? It must consist of 0 along with any\nnumber than can be reached from 0 by finitely many steps of\nimmediate succession. This characterization, however, threatens to be\ncircular: for, how is one to understand the adverb\n\u2018finitely\u2019 here, if not by appeal to the notion of natural\nnumber itself?\n\nFrege\u2019s genius revealed itself in the solution he devised to\nthis circularity problem. He had already covered the necessary logical\nand conceptual ground in his Begriffsschrift of 1879. For any\ntwo-place relation \\(R\\), Frege had defined what it was for \\(x\\) to\nbe an \\(R\\)-ancestor of \\(y\\) (abbreviated here as \\(R^*\nxy)\\). For this definition, he had employed two ancillary notions. The\nfirst was that of a concept \\(F\\) being \\(R\\)-hereditary:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x\\forall y(Fx \\rightarrow\n(Rxy \\rightarrow Fy)).\n\\]\n\n\nLet us abbreviate this as \n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}xy(Fx, Rxy).\n\\]\n\n\nThe second ancillary notion we shall express here as \u201c\\(x\\) is\n\\(R\\)-barred by \\(F\\)\u201d, or \u201c\\(F\\)\n\\(R\\)-bars \\(x\\)\u201d, and it is defined thus: \n\\[ \\forall z(Rxz \\rightarrow Fz).  \n\\]\n\n\nLet us abbreviate this as \n\\[\n\\mathcal{B}z(Rxz,Fz).\n\\]\n\n\nNow we are in a position to give Frege\u2019s definition of the\nancestral relation \\(R^* xy\\) as follows: \n\\[\n\\forall G(\\mathcal{H}vw(Gv, Rvw)\\rightarrow (\\mathcal{B}z(Rxz,Gz) \\rightarrow Gy)).\n\\]\n\n\nThis tells us that \\(y\\) falls under any concept \\(G\\) that is\n\\(R\\)-hereditary and \\(R\\)-bars \\(x\\).\n\nStill following Frege, one can then define \\(Nx\\) (\u201c\\(x\\) is a\nnatural number\u201d) as short for \n\\[\n0 = x \\vee \\text{successor}^* 0x.\n\\]\n\n\nThe relation \\(Rxy\\) on which Frege focuses is that of \\(y\\)\n(immediately) succeeding \\(x\\). This has the further advantage of\nbeing a function, i.e., a many-one relation. This enabled\nFrege to prove that the ancestral of successor is linear:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z((\\text{successor}^* xy &\\wedge \\text{successor}^* xz)\\\\\n&\\rightarrow\\ (y = z \\vee \\text{successor}^* yz \\vee \\text{successor}^* zy)).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis definition of \\(Nx\\) secures the desired result: every natural\nnumber is but finitely many steps of immediate succession away from 0.\nAncestralization captures the notion \u2018finitely many\u2019\nwithout invoking the notion of natural number, and indeed serves as an\nindependent logico-conceptual basis for the definition of the notion\nof natural number itself. Note also that it is an essentially\nsecond-order notion.\n\nGiven the functional character of the relation of immediate\nsuccession, one can write \\(m = sn\\) when \\(m\\) immediately succeeds\n\\(n\\). One especially important consequence of Frege\u2019s\ndefinition of \\(Nx\\) is that it enables one to prove, as a purely\nlogical result, the Principle of Mathematical Induction:\n\n\\[\n\\forall F(F0 \\rightarrow(\\forall x((Nx \\wedge Fx) \\rightarrow Fsx) \\rightarrow \\forall z(Nz \\rightarrow Fz))).\n\\]\n\n\nSo too could Frege derive, logically, all the other Dedekind-Peano\npostulates (involving the name 0 and the successor function-sign\n\\(s\\)) for the natural numbers.\n\nThe most important of these remaining postulates is the one saying\nthat every natural number has a unique (immediate) successor. In order\nto prove this in full generality, Frege had of course to take into\naccount the possibility that an arbitrarily given natural number might\nfar exceed the size of any collection of physical objects in the\nuniverse. To what concept, then, could he turn (for a given natural\nnumber \\(n)\\), whose cardinality would be the successor of \\(n\\)?\n\nHis answer has earned the label \u2018Frege\u2019s trick\u2019. The\nsought concept would be none other than \u2018successor\\(^*\nxn\\)\u2019, i.e., \u201c\\(x\\) is a natural number preceding or\nidentical to \\(n\\)\u201d. The natural numbers relentlessly generate\never more of their kind, as soon as we try to count them.\nThis is why there are infinitely many of them. The idea that\neach natural number tallies its predecessors in the series of natural\nnumbers was fully formed in the Grundlagen, at \u00a782, and\nrigorously executed in Volume I of the Grundgesetze, at\n\u00a7\u00a7114\u2013119.\n\nBy the time of the Grundgesetze, Frege had settled on an\nexplication of cardinal numbers in class-theoretic terms, which would\npreserve the structure of the foregoing considerations. The number of\n\\(F\\)s (i.e., the cardinal number of the class of all \\(F\\)s) was\nidentified as the class of all classes that are equinumerous with\n(i.e., in 1\u20131 correspondence with) the class of all\n \\(F\\)s.[21]\n Thus the class of all \\(F\\)s is a member of its own cardinal number.\nSo too is any class that is equinumerous with the class of all \\(F\\)s.\nThus the cardinal number of any one-membered class is the class of all\none-membered classes; the cardinal number of any two-membered class is\nthe class of all two-membered classes; \u2026 and so on. It is easy\nto see that, on Frege\u2019s class-theoretic definition of cardinal\nnumber, any two equinumerous classes have the same cardinal number.\nAnd numbers are not sui generis, but are rather classes of a\nvery special kind. See also the Encyclopedia article on\n Frege\u2019s Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic.\n1.2.5 Russell\u2019s Paradox\n\nIn the language of modern logic, supplied with the binary predicate\n\\(\\in\\) of membership, Frege\u2019s principle of na\u00efve\ncomprehension, to which he was committed by Basic Law V in the\nGrundgesetze, can also be rendered as the following\nschema: \n\\[\\exists x\\forall y(y \\in x \\leftrightarrow \\Phi y).\\]\n\n\nRussell\u2019s famous paradox ensues.\n\n\nProof. For \\(\\Phi\\)y in the foregoing expression of\nna\u00efve comprehension, take \\(y \\not\\in y\\)\n(non-self-membership). One thereby obtains \n\\[\\exists x\\forall y(y \\in x \\leftrightarrow y \\not\\in y).\\]\n\n\nLet \\(r\\) be such an \\(x\\). So \n\\[\\forall y(y \\in r \\leftrightarrow y \\not\\in y).\\]\n\n\nBut \\(r\\) is an object within the scope of this generalization.\nInstantiating with respect to \\(r\\), one obtains \n\\[r \\in r \\leftrightarrow r \\not\\in r.\\]\n\n\nBut one can show in short order, within a very weak propositional\nlogic, that any statement of the form \n\\[A \\leftrightarrow \\neg A\\]\n\n\nis\n inconsistent.[22]\n So Frege\u2019s Basic Law V is inconsistent. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nThis simple formal discovery occasioned the \u2018crisis in\nfoundations\u2019 early in the 20th century.\n\nFrege\u2019s Afterword to Volume II of his Grundgesetze,\nwritten in October 1902, begins with the heart-breaking words\n\n\nHardly anything more undesirable can befall a scientific writer than\nto have, at the completion of his work, one of the foundation-stones\nof his edifice shattered. (Frege [1903], p. 253; author\u2019s\ntranslation)\n\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox consigned the details of the\nGrundgesetze to relative obscurity. The scholarly community\nhad to wait a long time for a complete English translation of the\nwork. And this was unfortunate, given its importance for the\nneo-Fregean revival that began in the\n 1960s.[23]\n1.3 Logicism after Frege and up to Zermelo\n1.3.1 Russell\u2019s type theory\n\nRussell offered his own solution to the problem of his paradox, in the\nform of his theory of types (both simple and\n ramified).[24]\n By stratifying the universe of objects into types, Russell sought to\navoid the vicious circularity that he had diagnosed as the underlying\nproblem with Fregean class abstraction.\n\nIndividuals would form the lowest type. Attributes or properties of\nindividuals (or what Russell called propositional functions\nthat could be true or false of individuals) would form the next higher\ntype \u2026 and so on. In Russell\u2019s type theory, the relation\nof membership can hold only between objects of different types: if\n\\(\\alpha\\) is a member of \\(\\beta\\), then \\(\\alpha\\) is of lower type\nthan \\(\\beta\\). In type theory, the variables are typed. That is, a\ngiven variable is to be construed as ranging only over objects of a\ncertain type. Thus there will be \u2018individual\u2019 variables\n(of type 0, say) ranging over just the individuals. At the next type\nup\u2014type 1\u2014there will be \u2018property\u2019 and\n\u2018relation\u2019 variables ranging over such properties and\nrelations as hold of, or among, individuals. (0 and 1 here are serving\nas indices of types.) The idea iterates to cover all types of\nfinite index. Moreover, in Russell\u2019s theory, only the\nfinitely indexed types could be formed. These are the types that can\nbe indexed, from \u2018outside\u2019, so to speak, by natural\nnumbers \\(n\\). There are no transfinite types, i.e., no types that\nwould be indexed by transfinite ordinals such as\n \\(\\omega\\).[25]\n\nA predicative propositional function is one that involves no\nquantifications over types higher than those of its arguments. Russell\nstratifies not only the universe of discourse (the various types, and\nobjects of those types); he also stratifies the language.\nSuppose that a Russellian class (or predicative propositional\nfunction) \\(\\beta\\) is first formed at a higher rank than is\n\\(\\alpha\\). Then it is supposed to be meaningless (in the\nlanguage of type theory) to say that \\(\\beta\\) is a member of\n\\(\\alpha\\), where this is construed in the official sense of\nsupposedly attributing the attribute corresponding to \\(\\alpha\\) to\nthe object \\(\\beta\\). (By contrast, in the language of set\ntheory, it is meaningful\u2014even if false\u2014to\nsay that \\(\\beta \\in \\alpha\\).) Thus it is\nimpossible, within Russell\u2019s type theory, to deal with the\nwould-be predicate or property of non-self-membership. For that\nrequires that the predicate \\(x \\in x\\) of\nself-membership be meaningful (and well-formed); which it is not. So,\nin his type theory, Russell blocked the kind of derivation of his own\nparadox to which Frege\u2019s class theory fell victim.\n\nRussell, however, sought to preserve Frege\u2019s approach\nto defining cardinal numbers as classes of similar-sized classes:\n\n\nThe cardinal number of a class \\(\\alpha\\) is defined as the class of\nall classes similar to \\(\\alpha\\), two classes being similar when\nthere is a one-one relation between them. (Russell 1908: 256)\n\n\nThis definition, and the problems it engenders, survived into\nPrincipia Mathematica.\n\nBecause of Russell\u2019s partitioning of the logical universe into\ntypes, his \u2018cardinal numbers\u2019 became typically\nambiguous. (In the following quotation, the symbol \\(\\Lambda\\)\nstands for the null, or empty, class.) As Russell conceded (1908:\n257),\n\n\n\u2026 0 and 1 and all the other cardinals, according to [our]\ndefinitions, are ambiguous symbols, like cls, and have as many\nmeanings as there are types. To begin with 0: the meaning of 0 depends\nupon that of \\(\\Lambda\\), and the meaning of \\(\\Lambda\\) is different\naccording to the type of which it is the null-class. Thus there are as\nmany 0\u2019s as there are types; and the same applies to all the\nother cardinals.\n\n\nRussell does not, however, fully accept the strictures thus imposed.\nIn more expansive mood he immediately adds\n\n\nNevertheless, if two classes \\(\\alpha , \\beta\\) are of different\ntypes, we can speak of them as having the same cardinal \u2026\nbecause a one-one relation may hold between the members of \\(\\alpha\\)\nand the members of \\(\\beta,\\) even when \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\nare of different types. [Emphasis added]\n\n\nBy giving in to this structuralist impulse, Russell in effect puts a\nsecond construal of cardinal numbers into contention with his official\ntype-theoretic one. The new construal is of a cardinal number as\nsomething that results from abstracting from classes on the\nbasis of their similarity, rather than from forming classes of similar\nclasses. Such abstraction takes the Humean form (famously exploited by\nCantor) \n\\[\\text{Card}(\\alpha) = \\text{Card}(\\beta) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists R(R :\n\\alpha \\underset{\\text{onto}}{\\overset{1\\text{-}1}{\\mapsto}} \\beta).\\]\n\n\nFor the reasons internal to type theory explained above, a Card cannot\nbe an object within any type within the official ontology of type\ntheory. For its would-be domain of definition would not only have to\nstraddle distinct types, but also include classes of all types. But\nthat is not possible for any type-theoretically admissible function or\noperation. This fact also precludes Russell from using Frege\u2019s\ntrick to ensure an infinity of\n numbers.[26]\n For Frege had each natural number \\(n\\) be the number of preceding\nnatural numbers. For the latter to be thus numbered, they have to be\nobjects in the official ontology\u2014which, however, as just\nobserved, Russell\u2019s Card(inal)s are not.\n\nPartitioning the universe into types accordingly exacted a high price\nfor the \u2018logicism\u2019 that might result. It is not reassuring\nto learn that the logicist reconstruction on offer for one\u2019s\nfavorite mathematical structures is so generous as to be uniquely\nre-presented within each type. One would wish to capture their\ncommonalities within some one structure. And that,\nas we have just seen, is what Russell was trying to do, even though it\nwas doomed to failure from the start, on account of its being\ncommitted to the existence of a different series of the\n\u2018same\u2019 numbers within each type.\n\nThe motivation for the typing that led to this embarras de\nrichesses was understandable at the time. Russell wished to avoid\nany potentially vicious circularity that might result from\nimpredicative definitions. According to Russell, it should be illicit\nto define a class \\(C\\) in a way that involves generalizing about any\nrange of individuals to which \\(C\\) itself would have to belong. Thus,\nwith partitioning into types, the notion of self-membership, along\nwith non-self-membership, could not even be deployed.\n\nThis Russellian constraint on class abstraction, however, had the\nconsequence that with impredicative \u2018class abstracts\u2019 of\nthe form \u201cthe class of all \\(x\\) such that \\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d,\nthe existence of such a class could not be guaranteed as\na matter of logic. So Russell had to postulate that such\nclasses existed. This came to be regarded as detracting from their\nstatus as would-be logical objects, and revealing them instead as no\nmore than mathematical posits. Their existence was once again (at\nbest) a synthetic a priori matter, rather than one of\nanalytic necessity and certainty.\n\nOne might wonder why such classes would qualify as logical objects\ncourtesy of a single immensely powerful postulate (had it been\nconsistent), but would not so qualify if their existence has to be\nsecured in a more piecemeal postulational fashion. But that was the\nAchilles heel of Russellian logicism. The existential postulation\npresent in Russell\u2019s Multiplicative Axiom (nowadays known as the\nAxiom of Choice) and in his Axiom of Infinity were seen as marks of\nthe merely mathematical, albeit against the background of a much more\ncapacious universe of abstract objects than just the natural numbers\nor the real numbers themselves.\n\nRussellian types are ramified: that is, propositional\nfunctions of one and the same type belong to different\norders, depending on their internal logical structures. The\ntype of a propositional function, as we have seen, is\ndetermined by the types of its free variables. But two propositional\nfunctions \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\phi '\\) of the same type can involve\ndifferent kinds of quantifications. If \\(\\phi\\) involves\nquantifications whose (bound) variables range over higher types than\ndo the bound variables within \\(\\phi '\\), then \\(\\phi\\) is of\ncorrespondingly higher order than \\(\\phi '\\), even though \\(\\phi\\) and\n\\(\\phi '\\) are of the same type. Recall that an impredicative\npropositional function \\(\\phi\\) is one that contains bound variables\nranging over types as high as or higher than the type of \\(\\phi\\)\nitself. Assigning an impredicative propositional function to a higher\norder is the ramifier\u2019s way of marking it as not kosher.\n\nRussell ramified his theory of types in order to avoid explicitly\nimpredicative definitions (against which definitions Poincar\u00e9\ninfluentially inveighed). Russell then found himself hamstrung, unable\nto derive certain desired mathematical results. Among these results\nwere Cantor\u2019s Theorem, and the theorem of real analysis which\nstates that every set \\(X\\) of real numbers that is bounded above has\na least upper bound of the same order as the real numbers in\n\\(X\\). Ramified type theory appeared powerless to prove these\nresults. So Russell, in pragmatist spirit, introduced the Axiom of\nReducibility simply in order to get things done.\n\nRussell\u2019s Axiom of Reducibility in type theory states that every\npropositional function is coextensive with a predicative\none\u2014that is, one whose quantifiers range only over types lower\nthan that of the propositional function itself. The non-trivial\ncontent of this axiom is that every impredicative\npropositional function is coextensive with a predicative one. A well\nknown example to illustrate this is the impredicative propositional\nfunction \\(\\forall F(Fx \\leftrightarrow Fy)\\). The Axiom of\nReducibility could be vindicated on this example by adducing the\npredicative propositional function \\(x = y\\)\u2014provided that one\naccepts Leibniz\u2019s controversial principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. If, contra Leibniz, one believes it is\npossible for indiscernibles to be distinct, then, in order to\nvindicate the Axiom of Reducibility, it would be necessary to adduce\nsome other predicative propositional function, \\(x \\sim y\\) say, for\nwhich it is true that \n\\[\\forall F(Fx \\leftrightarrow Fy) \\leftrightarrow x \\sim y.\\]\n\n\nThe Axiom of Reducibility, however, is tantamount to conceding the\nadmissibility of impredicative definitions after all. For it collapses\nthe orders for propositional functions of type 1. Critics pointed out\nthat it would be better to eschew ramification and embrace the\nprocedure of impredicative definition as licit after all.\n\nOne was then left with simple type theory (and no need for the Axiom\nof Reducibility). But even the simple theory of types eventually fell\nout of favor as a foundational theory for mathematics\u2014possibly\nbecause in the wake of the Byzantine ramified theory, no version of\ntype theory could find favor among mathematicians themselves. Type\ntheory was displaced by the newly emerging set theory due to\nZermelo and Fraenkel, which mathematicians could recognize more easily\nas a formal codification of Cantorian mathematical practice. A\ndefinitive and richly detailed history of the reception and eventual\ndemise of Russellian logicism can be found in Grattan-Guinness (2000).\n(The terminology of \u2018sets\u2019 was adopted in order to\ncontrast these \u2018safer\u2019, paradox-free objects with the\nproblematic classes of Frege\u2019s inconsistent\ntheory.)\n1.3.2 Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\n\nWith some justice ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of\nChoice) can be construed as an intellectual descendant of Russellian\ntype theory, even though both theories date from the same year,\n1908.\n\nThe displacement of type theory by set theory took place during the\n1920s. The aim was still to unify all of mathematics, and to provide a\ncapacious universe of abstract objects in order to do so. All the\ndifferent mathematical theories would be interpretable within set\ntheory, upon suitable identification of \u2018set-theoretic\nsurrogates\u2019 for the objects studied by those theories. So, for\nexample, the finite von Neumann ordinals can serve as set-theoretic\nsurrogates for the natural\n numbers.[27]\n And \\(\\wp(\\omega)\\), the power set of the set of natural numbers, is\nthe set-theoretic surrogate for the real\n continuum.[28]\n\nZFC set theory is an account of a cumulative hierarchy \\(V\\) of pure\nsets, built up, ultimately, from the empty set \\(\\varnothing\\). Each\nset within \\(V\\) is \u2018formed\u2019 by some ordinally indexed\nrank. The ranks are cumulative, and are generated, at successor\nordinals, by application of the power-set operation. The erstwhile\ntypes are born again as ranks, except that ranks are\ncumulative\u2014every rank contains all members of lower\nranks. Their members are put on all fours, so to speak, for they are\ntaken to occupy one single extensionalized, untyped universe \\(V\\) of\nsets.\n\nQuine (1969), chapters XI and XII, is a masterly tracing of a route\nconsisting of incremental theoretical adjustments that one could in\nprinciple make, beginning with the type theory of Principia\nMathematica (PM), and ending with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\nThe purpose behind postulating the Axiom of Reducibility in type\ntheory, as already observed, was to ensure that every propositional\nfunction is coextensive with a predicative one. As Quine points out,\nhowever (and as Ramsey had pointed out before him), the Axiom of\nReducibility really defeats the purpose behind its own postulation,\nthereby motivating the adoption of a simple type theory in place of\nPM\u2019s ramified one. If one then reformulates simple type theory\nwith \u2018general\u2019, or untyped, variables, and lets the types\nbe cumulative (rather than remain stratified one from another without\noverlap), one effects the segue to Zermelo set theory.\nFraenkel\u2019s Axiom Scheme of Replacement finally allows one to\n\u201c[pierce] all type ceilings\u201d (Quine 1969: 282), and reach\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Replacement says that any function that\nis defined on a set as its domain has a set as its range. This allows\none to form, for example, for any transfinite ordinal number\n\\(\\kappa\\), the set \n\\[\\{\\aleph_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha \\lt \\kappa \\}\\]\n\n\nof all infinite cardinals numbers \\(\\aleph_{\\alpha}\\), where \\(\\alpha\n= 0,1,2,\\ldots \\lt \\kappa\\). The ordinals \\(\\alpha\\) less than\n\\(\\kappa\\) form a set (indeed: \\(\\kappa\\) itself).\n\\(\\aleph_{\\alpha}\\), better thought of as \\(\\aleph(\\alpha)\\), is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-th infinite cardinal number. So \\(\\aleph\\) is a function\nwith domain \\(\\kappa\\), whose value on \\(\\alpha\\) is the \\(\\alpha\\)-th\ninfinite cardinal number. By Replacement, the set \\(\\{\\aleph_{\\alpha}\n\\mid \\alpha \\lt \\kappa \\}\\) exists. Such a set resides at a rank way\nabove \\(\\kappa\\).\n\nQuine\u2019s account amplifies the slightly less detailed one that is\nto be found in G\u00f6del\n (1993/1995).[29]\n As G\u00f6del observed (pp. 45\u20136), the \u2018theory of\naggregates\u2019, or set theory,\n\n\n\u2026 as presented by Zermelo, Fraenkel and von Neumann \u2026 is\nnothing else but a natural generalization of the theory of types, or\nrather, it is what becomes of the theory of types if certain\nsuperfluous restrictions are removed.\n\n\nThese removals are threefold: make the types cumulative; untype the\nvariables; and allow type formation to extend into the\ntransfinite.\n\nZFC avoids Russell\u2019s Paradox, even though all its member-sets\nare on all fours, within an untyped universe. This is because its\nuniverse \\(V\\) itself is not a set. By not espousing any\npowerful enough set-abstraction principle, the set theorist avoids\nRussell\u2019s paradox. Partitioning the universe of discourse into\ntypes appears to have been a methodologically costly over-reaction to\nthe problem of Russell\u2019s Paradox. The latter would of course be\nre-instated if one were ever to treat the universe \\(V\\) as a set.\nSimply apply the Axiom Scheme of Separation \n\\[\\forall y\\exists z(z = \\{x\\mid x \\in y \\wedge \\Phi(x)\\}),\\]\n\n\nusing for \\(\\Phi(x)\\) the Russellian formula-instance \\(x \\not\\in x\\),\nand instantiating \\(\\forall y\\) with respect to \\(V\\).\n\nMathematicians have a well-established practice of treating\nset-abstracts as well-formed terms. They are of the logico-grammatical\nform \\(\\{x \\mid\n \\Phi(x)\\}\\).[30]\n If one\u2019s formalizing logic is to respect this practice, then it\nmust provide the variable-binding term-forming operator\n(v.b.t.o.) of set-abstraction: \n\\[\\{x \\mid \\ldots x \\ldots \\}.\\]\n\n\nSuch an operator may be applied to any formula \\(\\Phi\\) to produce a\nterm. Among such formulae are the hazardous ones \\(x = x\\) and \\(x\n\\not\\in x\\). The formalizing foundationalist will therefore be careful\nto adopt a free logic in which it is not assumed, of\nevery well-formed term, that it enjoys a denotation. The proof of\nRussell\u2019s Paradox can then be deprived of its sting: it simply\nbecomes a proof of the negative existential \\(\\neg \\exists x\\, x = \\{y\n\\mid y \\not\\in y\\}\\).\n\nAdopting a free logic, however, brings with it the following\nobligation: if one wishes to recognize that certain sorts of objects\nexist, or that a particular object exists, then one will have to\npostulate their existence explicitly. No longer does such existence\nderive from a kind of built-in, or tacit, default assumption of the\nunderlying logic. Rather, it demands explicit expression as a\ntheoretical commitment.\n\nYou want an empty set? the ZFC-theorist asks. By all\nmeans! Here it is: \n\\[\\exists x(x = \\{y \\mid y \\ne y\\}).\\]\n\n\nYou want singletons? Sure thing!: \n\\[\\forall x\\exists y(y = \\{w \\mid w = x\\}).\\]\n\n\n\u2026 Or, if you prefer, get them from the axiom of unordered\npairs, by taking the same instance twice over: \n\\[\\forall x_1\\forall x_2\\exists y(y = \\{z \\mid z = x_1 \\vee z = x_2\\}).\\]\n\n\nYou want an infinite set? By all means! Here is a very useful\none: \n\\[\\exists x(x = \\{y \\mid  Ny\\}),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(Ny\\) means that \\(y\\) is a finite von Neumann ordinal (and\nthis concept can be explicitly defined in set-theoretic\nterms).\n\nZFC theorists wear their ontological commitments, either outright or\nconditional, very much on their postulational sleeve. They are out to\ncharacterize a very rich mathematical universe, to be sure\u2014one\nin which there are so many things, and of such great variety of\nstructure(s), that one should be able to find, therein, a\nset-theoretic \u2018surrogate\u2019 for virtually any kind of\nmathematical object or structure about which one may wish to make\nconjectures and prove theorems. With only this over-riding concern to\nunify all of mathematics within one overarching\n domain,[31]\n the ZFC theorist is not particularly committed to a logicist\nview of the objects and structures involved. If anything, logicism has\nacquired a new challenge: show how set theory\nitself\u2014like arithmetic and analysis, say\u2014is simply a\nbody of logical truths in definitional disguise; and show how sets\nthemselves can be (re-)construed as some kind of definitional\nconcoction from purely logical\n objects![32]\n2. Neo-Fregeanism\n\nThe neo-Fregean revival had its origin in an insight of Charles\nParsons (see Parsons 1965: 183 and 194). He pointed out that what he\ncalled principle (A) below suffices, given the structure of\nFrege\u2019s argumentation in the Grundlagen, for the\nderivation of the axioms of Peano arithmetic. Parsons uses the binary\nquantifier \u2018Glz\u2019 to abbreviate\n\u201cgleichzahlig\u201d (equinumerous), and uses \\(N_x\\)\nto abbreviate \u201cthe number of\u201d:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{A}\nN_{x}Fx = N_{x}Gx \\equiv Glz_x (Fx,Gx).\n\\]\n\n\n\u2026 we can put [Frege\u2019s procedure] in the form of defining\nPeano\u2019s three primitives \u20180\u2019, \u2018natural\nnumber\u2019 and \u2018successor\u2019, and proving Peano\u2019s\naxioms. \u2026 it is not necessary to use any axioms of set\nexistence except in introducing terms of the form \u2018\\(N_x\nFx\\)\u2019 and in proving (A), so that the argument could be carried\nout by taking (A) as an axiom.\n\n\nThis is nowadays called \u2018Frege\u2019s\n Theorem\u2019.[33]\n Frege\u2019s Theorem has Principle (A) as its hypothesis. Curiously,\nthe stress Frege places, in the Grundlagen, on the importance\nof this principles (that two concepts have the same number just in\ncase they are gleichzahlig) is dissipated in the\nGrundgesetze, where the two halves of the biconditional\nappear widely separated: in \u00a753 Frege proves that if two concepts\ncorrespond 1\u20131, then their numbers are identical, and in\n\u00a769 he proves the converse. But nowhere in the\nGrundgesetze does he re-assemble the biconditional and accord\nit prime philosophical importance. Had he done so, he might\nwell have become the first neo-Fregean in response to Russell\u2019s\nParadox. In order to do so, however, he would have had to overcome his\nreluctance to view (A) as a logical\n axiom.[34]\n\nThe neo-Fregean movement seeks to reveal that a significant amount of\nmathematics is analytic. This is a stronger claim than that it is\na priori and derives no part of its justification from\nempirical science, or even from successful applications within the\nempirical sciences. For that would hold of mathematics (or indeed any\nother branch of knowledge) conceived of as synthetic a\npriori. The neo-Fregean maintains in addition that significant\nparts of mathematics flow logically from principles that are analytic\nof (or definitional of) their central concepts or predicates, such as\n\u2018natural number\u2019 or \u2018real number\u2019. That is,\nthey flow from the very meanings of those central predicates. (We opt\nhere for the linguistic version of the analyticity claim). Note the\nstress here on \u2018significant\n parts\u2019.[35]\n We know from G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem that\nany consistent and sufficiently strong theory of arithmetic is unable\nto prove or refute (the formalized statement of) its own consistency.\nThe latter statement is true, but unprovable. In light of the\nincompleteness phenomena, one would be hard pressed to make good on\nthe claim that all mathematical truths are true by virtue\nonly of such logical considerations as can be captured in\nsystems of formal\n proof.[36]\n When the first principles of a mathematical theory, such as\narithmetic, form an essentially incomplete axiomatization, the\nlogicist will have to maintain that the justification of any\nnew first principle can be furnished in some strictly logical\nsense.\n\nNote that the foregoing remarks describe the general context for a\nneo-Fregean revival of logicism of any kind. They do not dictate the\nexact form of any such revival. In\n \u00a73\n we discuss the particular form of the revival that involves extending\nsecond-order logic with Hume\u2019s Principle; and in\n \u00a74,\n we discuss constructive logicism.\n\nThese two forms of neo-Fregean revival of logicism share the following\nthree important features with Frege\u2019s own treatment.\n\nFirst, the number 0 (zero) is still defined as the number of any empty\nconcept: in particular, as the number of non-self-identical\nthings (formally: \\(\\# x \\neg x = x\\)).\n\nSecondly, once the existence of any natural number \\(n\\) is secured,\nthat of its successor, \\(s(n)\\), is secured by taking \\(s(n)\\) to be\nthe number of all natural numbers from 0 to \\(n\\),\ninclusive (Frege\u2019s trick).\n\nThirdly, the definition of the concept of natural number exploits the\nnotion of the ancestral of the relation of succession: \\(x\\)\nbears the succession-ancestral relation to \\(y\\) just in case \\(y\\) is\nat most finitely many steps of succession away from \\(x\\). (As already\nmade clear, any apparent circularity in this definition, deriving from\nthe adverbial gloss \u2018finitely\u2019, turns out, upon closer\ninspection of the definitions used, to be just that: merely apparent.)\nThe concept \u201c\\(z\\) is a natural number\u201d is then defined as\n\u201ceither 0 is \\(z\\), or 0 bears the succession-ancestral relation\nto \\(z\\)\u201d. And this is what allows the neo-Fregean logicist to\nderive the principle of mathematical induction for the natural\nnumbers. The reader of this survey article will be spared the formal\ndetails. They can be found in Tennant (2022).\n3. Second-order logic with Hume\u2019s Principle\n\nThe neo-Fregean revival began in earnest with\n Wright.[37]\n Wright (1983) sought to derive the Dedekind-Peano axioms for\nsuccessor arithmetic from what was called N\\(^=\\) and has since come\nto be known as Hume\u2019s Principle (that is, Parsons\u2019s\nprinciple (A) above): \n\\[\\# xFx = \\# xGx \\leftrightarrow \\exists R (R\n\\text{ maps the \\(F\\)s \\(1\\text{-}1\\) onto the \\(G\\)s}).\\]\n\n\nWright sketched a derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from\nHume\u2019s Principle. The deductions sketched would be carried out\nin standard second-order logic\u2014\u2018standard\u2019 in the\nsense that, in the presence of HP, all number-abstractive terms of the\nform \\(\\# x\\Phi(x)\\) can be proved to denote. Such a system is\nunfree with respect to its number-abstractive terms. This\npoint holds even if the second-order logic in question is a\nfree logic in the official sense of not being committed to the\ntheorem-scheme \\(\\exists !t\\) (i.e., \\(\\exists x\\, x = t\\)) for any\nwell-formed singular term \\(t\\). The proof of this point is short and\neasy, and is like the one given in\n \u00a71.2.3.\n We shall given an informal version as follows.\n\n\nClearly, the identity relation is a one-one correspondence of the\n\\(\\Phi\\)s onto the \\(\\Phi\\)s. Therefore it is a theorem of\nsecond-order logic that \n\\[\\exists R(R \\text{ maps the \\(\\Phi\\)s \\(1\\text{-}1\\) onto the\n\\(\\Phi\\)s}).\\]\n\n\nThis is the right-hand side of that instance of HP whose left-hand\nside is \n\\[\\# x\\Phi(x) = \\# x\\Phi(x).\\]\n\n\nThe latter has now been established as a theorem-scheme of\nsecond-order logic with HP. Hence in this system we have the\ntheorem-scheme \n\\[\\exists !\\# x\\Phi(x).\\]\n\n\n\nThe overarching theme is that we can redeem Frege\u2019s key\nphilosophical insights concerning (natural and real) numbers and our\nknowledge of them, despite Russell\u2019s discovery of paradox in\nFrege\u2019s own theory of classes. That paradox notwithstanding,\nnumbers are still logical objects, characterized by methods or\nprinciples of abstraction\u2014which of course cannot be as ambitious\nas Frege\u2019s Basic Law V. These principles afford a distinctive\nform of epistemic access to numbers. The usual mathematical axioms\ngoverning the two kinds of numbers are to be derived as results in\n(higher-order) logic\u2014essentially following Frege\u2019s\ndeductive plan. These derivations will exploit appropriate definitions\nof the primitive constants, functions, and predicates of the brand of\nnumber theory concerned. (For example: 0, 1; \\(s, +, \\times\\);\n\\(\\lt\\); \\(N(x)\\);  \\(\\mathbb{R}(x)\\).)  \n\nThe main difference is this: the neo-Fregean no longer accepts\nFrege\u2019s definition of numbers as classes of equinumerous\nclasses. Instead, the numbers are vouchsafed as sui generis,\ncourtesy of newly chosen abstraction principles. The Wrightian\nneo-logicist (henceforth: the HP-er) opts for HP; the constructive\nlogicist opts, much more modestly, for rules permitting the\nintroduction of zero and of successors. Apart from this key\ndifference, however, the neo-Fregeans hew in other places quite\nclosely to Frege\u2019s overall deductive strategy when deriving the\nDedekind-Peano postulates.\n\nNo supplementation by intuition or sensory experience will be needed\nin the derivations of these postulates. The trains of reasoning\ninvolved will depend only on our grasp of logical validities,\nsupplemented by appropriate definitions. Purported result (for the\nHP-er): because HP is analytic, logicism is vindicated; and\nthe mathematical knowledge derived in this way is revealed to be\nanalytic, not synthetic.\n\nFor reservations about this claimed result, however, see Boolos\n(1997). The main objection with which the HP-er needs to contend is\nthat Hume\u2019s Principle is neither a logical nor an analytic\ntruth. It cannot be logical, so the objection would go, because it has\nsuch a huge ledger of ontological commitments: for every\nconcept, its alleged number. And it cannot be analytic, because the\ntwo sides of the biconditional have different ontological\ncommitments: the right-hand side has no commitments to numbers,\nwhile the left-hand side is brimming with such commitments. In order\nto defend against these objections, the HP-er needs to do two things.\nFirst\u2014as any logicist needs to do\u2014he needs to challenge\nthe dogma that no logical principle can carry any ontological\ncommitments. Secondly, he needs to provide an account of analyticity\naccording to which a biconditional can be analytic even when the\nexplicit ontological commitments of each side of the biconditional\ndiffer. (These commitments are to be judged by considering each side\nas a sentence in the restricted language whose vocabulary is just\nsufficient to allow the sentence in question to be formed.)\n\nThe HP-er advocates Hume\u2019s Principle in its unrestricted form,\nand is thereby committed, as we have seen, to the existence of a\ndenotation for every term of the form \\(\\{x \\mid \\Phi(x)\\}\\). The\nHP-er is committed, not only to the number of all natural numbers, but\nalso to the number of all self-identical things\u2014or, at least, so\nWright was in Wright (1983). This \u2018universal number\u2019 \\(\\#\nx(x = x\\)) is sometimes called \u2018anti-zero\u2019. In n. 5 on p.\n187 one reads\n\n\nIt is worth stressing that it is, of course, absolutely essential that\nthere be such a number as \\(Nx : x = x\\); for it is impossible to\nimagine what sort of ground there could be for admitting \\(Nx : x \\ne\nx\\) if that were in doubt.\n\n\nBoolos (1987), after raising qualms about the universal number,\nprovided an ingenious model (which had been anticipated informally by\nGeach (1975: 446\u20137)) to allay the misgiving about the\nconsistency of full second-order logic with HP (the system now known\nas FA, for \u2018Frege Arithmetic\u2019). Simply take the natural\nnumbers along with the distinct object \\(\\omega\\) as the elements of\nthe domain. The element \\(\\omega\\) serves as the denotation of any\nterm of the form \\(\\# x\\Phi(x)\\) where \\(\\Phi\\) is satisfied by\ninfinitely many elements. Note, however, that this consistency proof\nworks only when FA is taken on its\n own.[38]\n The Geach\u2013Boolos model cannot be relied upon to secure the\nconsistency of FA in conjunction with other theories, such as\nset theory, that one might wish to extend with FA. Since, however,\ncounting finite extensions ought to be a universally applicable\nintellectual operation, regardless of subject matter, it will be the\nexception rather than the rule that FA is to be applied only to\nthe natural numbers (plus, perhaps, the unnatural factotum\n\\(\\omega)\\). Rather, FA should be applicable not only to concrete\nobjects, but also to abstract mathematical entities such as real\nnumbers and sets. Provided only that one has a criterion of identity\nfor the objects in question, one should be in a position to count any\nfinite collection of them.\n\nSubsequently, in Hale and Wright 2001 (p. 315), Wright expressed\nreservations over whether \u201c\\(x = x\\)\u201d counts as a sortal\npredicate eligible to be prefixed by \u201cthe number of \\(x\\) such\nthat\u201d. Now Wright was inquiring after what \u201cis wanted for\nthe exorcism of anti-zero\u201d (p. 314, emphasis added).\nHis considered answer is that a term of the form \\(\\# xFx\\) will\ndenote a number only if the concept \\(F\\) is both sortal and not\nindefinitely\n extensible.[39]\n So Wright subsequently hoped to make actual what he had previously\nalleged to be impossible to imagine. The technical proposal must\ntherefore be that Hume\u2019s Principle is to be restricted to\npredicates that (express concepts that) are both sortal and not\nindefinitely extensible. But this, of course, raises the question\nwhether there is an effective method for determining, of any given\npredicate \\(F\\), whether \\(F\\) (expresses a concept that) is both\nsortal and not indefinitely extensible. In the absence of any such\neffective method, the theory will not have been axiomatized.\n\nThis survey perforce confines itself, in the main, to (neo-)logicist\naccounts of the natural numbers. But it is worth raising one\nmore question about the extension of a neo-Fregean account in an\nattempt to cope with the real numbers. We shall call it the\ninclusion question. How is one to appreciate that the natural\nnumbers qua reals are (in the non-punning sense of\nnumerical identity) the natural numbers vouchsafed by logicism about\nthe\n naturals?[40]\n This question is not answered by the neo-Fregean abstractionist\naccount of the reals in Shapiro (2000). In that account, the various\nnew abstracta are abstracted from quite varying equivalence relations,\nand no attempt is made to leave it open as a possibility that the\nnatural number \\(n\\) is the integer \\(n\\), is the\nrational number \\(n\\), and is the real number \\(n\\).\n(Although on p. 339 Shapiro writes that he proposes \u201cto avoid\nthe issue [of identity under inclusion] here\u201d, his\nproposed treatment nevertheless answers the inclusion question\nnegatively.)\n\nOne issue that is not satisfactorily disposed of, is this: in what\nsense can Wright\u2019s neo-Fregean logicist claim to be furnishing\nan epistemic foundation for, let us say, first-order Peano\narithmetic, if their axiomatic principle HP, along with the\nsecond-order logic employed (\\(=\\text{FA}\\)), puts the supposed\n\u2018foundation\u2019 much higher in the hierarchy of\nconsistency-strengths than the weaker theory being\n\u2018founded\u2019? (This is to raise once again the worry\nexpressed by Boolos (1997:\n 248\u20139).)[41]\n\nIt is an age-old tradition in foundational investigations to provide a\nfoundation that is not only obviously consistent, but obviously true,\nand from which all the results in the branch(es) of mathematics being\nfounded will follow logically. Moreover, this following logically is\nitself something that must be epistemically accessible\u2014hence the\nimportance of checkable proof. A foundational effort can be directed\nat many different branches of mathematics simultaneously, or just at\nsome particular branch, such as arithmetic. In the former case, it is\nunderstandable if the foundational theory chosen (such as ZFC) has a\nhigher consistency strength in relation to any one branch of\nmathematics being founded. But if the effort is directed at just that\none branch (say, arithmetic), then the foundation provided should be\nof a consistency-strength that is as low as possible, in relation to\nthat branch.\n\nThe consistency-strength of FA is that of second-order arithmetic\n\\(Z_2\\) (i.e., real analysis), which is equal to that of\nZermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Power Sets. The\nconsistency-strength of first-order Peano arithmetic is much weaker,\nnamely that of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of\nPower Sets and without the Axiom of Infinity.\n\nBy adopting second-order logic along with Hume\u2019s Principle in an\nunrestricted form, Wright incurred commitment (as a matter of\nanalyticity) not only to each natural number, seriatim, but\nalso to the cardinal number of any concept whatsoever. We\nknow now, however, that G\u00f6del\u2019s prescient\n\u2018completionary\u2019 insight has long since been fully borne\nout. The insight in question was that the set-theorist\u2019s key to\nproving stronger and stronger results in mathematics\u2014and in\nparticular the consistency of each newly attained system\u2014is to\npostulate the existence of ever-larger cardinal numbers. If all these\ncardinals were available across the board courtesy of Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple applied to appropriately expressed concepts, then Wright\nwould be proposing a foundational theory of enormous strength. The\nonly reason why FA is not even more powerful than \\(Z_2\\) is that the\nformer system\u2019s ontology is being generated solely by the\nabstractions. There is no other source of existential postulation, as\nthere would be if one were to add, say, set theory to the theoretical\nmix.\n\nUpon such addition further care would be needed when considering the\nnature of Wright\u2019s transfinite cardinals begotten by\nHume\u2019s Principle. As the investigations of Kit Fine (1998: 515;\n2002) have revealed, any attempt to combine such an abstractive\naccount of transfinite cardinals with set theory must resort to\ntreating the abstracted cardinals as Urelemente rather than\nas sets. Set theory cannot, by itself, provide a set-surrogate for\nevery transfinite cardinal that would be generated by Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple.\n\nAnother and rather different line of criticism of the claim that HP is\nanalytic can be found in Mancosu (2016: Chapter 4). Ironically,\nMancosu advances what he calls a Good Company objection to\nHP. HP jostles for primacy with at least infinitely many \u2018Good\nCompanion\u2019 abstraction principles. They are good because, like\nHP, they permit the logical derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms.\nThey do so via their respective \u2018number\u2019-abstraction\noperators with predicates whose extensions are\n(Dedekind-)finite. They assign such extensions the right\nnatural numbers as their cardinal numbers. When that operator is\napplied to a predicate whose extension is\n(Dedekind-)infinite, however, these other principles give\nresults arbitrarily different from what one would expect from the more\nCantorian principle HP. HP and these Good Companions get matters right\non all finite extensions. But the Good Companions give rise to a\nconfusing variety of \u2018number\u2019-assignments to infinite\nextensions. The problem for the HP-er, as Mancosu sees it, is how to\nmaintain the case for the analyticity of HP in light of all this good\ncompany. We see here another manifestation of the epistemological\nworry that HP is of excessive consistency strength when the logicist\nproject is simply to furnish a deeper but analytic foundation for\nDedekind-Peano arithmetic. All that such a foundation requires is what\nHP and these competing Good Companion principles agree\nupon\u2014namely, that predicates with\n(Dedekind-)finite extensions should get the right numbers\nassigned to them (i.e., the natural numbers). There is no need for the\nlogicist about Dedekind-Peano arithmetic to make pronouncements about\nany infinite numbers.\n\nMancosu\u2019s Good Companions to HP arise only because he shares\nwith the HP-er a fundamental logical commitment: every\nsingular term of the language must denote. This means that the logic\nfurnishing the supposed logicist foundation for arithmetic is not a\nfree logic. Every singular term formed by applying the\nnumber-abstraction operator to a predicate is taken to stand for some\nobject. This refusal to adopt a free logic complicates matters unduly\nif ones sees as part of the logicist project the task of generating\nonly epistemically justifiable commitment to numbers as\nabstract existents. We want, as it were, to be able to recognize only\nthose numbers whose existential credentials are absolutely compelling.\nIn particular, the logicist should be able to deliver only\nthe natural numbers, when furnishing deeper logical derivations of the\nDedekind-Peano postulates.\n4. Constructive Logicism\n4.1 Motivation for a different kind of neo-logicism\n\nWe begin this section with some remarks about Gentzenian proof theory.\nThis is not because it played any direct role in the development of\nlogicism\u2014far from it\u2014but because we seek in this section\nto describe in broad terms a different kind of neo-logicism that draws\nmore heavily on proof-theoretic resources.\n\nIt was only with the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the early 1930s (see\nGentzen 1934, 1935) that researchers in foundations were equipped with\nformal calculi of deduction that could do real justice to the actual\nstructure of inferential dependencies within mathematical proofs. What\nwe have in mind here are the dependencies of conclusions upon both\npremises and assumptions that may have been made only \u201cfor the\nsake of argument\u201d. A good example of assumptions of the latter\nkind are reductio assumptions (assume \\(\\phi\\); derive\nabsurdity; conclude \\(\\neg \\phi\\), now independently of \\(\\phi)\\).\n\nIt is extraordinary that the community of mathematical logicians took\nso long to discover the calculi of natural deduction (and the\nsequent calculi), once Frege, in 1879, had cracked the\npreviously hidden grammatical code of multiply quantified sentences.\nIt is remarkable that G\u00f6del, in 1929, could have demonstrated the\ncompleteness of first-order logic before Gentzen\u2019s\nnatural formulation of it, when that logic was available only in the\nforms of the highly unnatural deductive calculi devised by Frege, by\nHilbert, and by Russell and Whitehead.\n\nThe essential breakthrough of Gentzen\u2019s treatment was to\ncharacterize each logical operator in isolation, with rules of its\nown, rules in which only that operator would explicitly\nfeature. Moreover, the rules in question would deal only with a\nsingle occurrence (in dominant position) of the operator in\nquestion. The rule for reasoning to a conclusion with the operator\ndominant was called the operator\u2019s introduction rule;\nwhile the rule for reasoning from a premise with the operator\ndominant was called its elimination rule.\n\nThe introduction and elimination rules for any logical operator have\nto be in a certain kind of equilibrium, an equilibrium that\nlends itself to an interpretation of the rules as matching the\ninferential obligations of any responsible, rational and sincere\nspeaker to the inferential entitlements of any responsible, rational\nand trusting\n listener.[42]\n\nThe equilibrium in question is explicated by the so-called\nreduction procedures for the logical operators. These\nprocedures enable one to remove from a proof any sentence occurrence\nthat stands both as the conclusion of an application of an\nintroduction rule and as the major premise of an application of the\ncorresponding elimination rule. Repeated application of the procedures\nwill eventually turn the proof into one that is in normal\nform\u2014essentially, one that is not eligible for any further\napplication of the\n procedures.[43]\n The significance of proofs in normal form is that they represent\ndirect deductive routes from their premises to their\nconclusions.\n\nPowerful, incisive and revolutionary though Gentzen\u2019s approach\nhas since proved to be, it was, in its turn, curiously limited. It was\nrestricted to just the universally acknowledged logical\noperators of first-order logic: \\(\\neg , \\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow ,\n\\exists\\) and \\(\\forall\\).\n\nAt exactly the same time there appeared Carnap (1934), Logische\nSyntax der Sprache, which offered an account of analyticity for\nlanguages in which all logico-mathematical operators could\nmake similar contributions to the status of a sentence as analytically\ntrue (or analytically false). Carnap, however, did this by employing\naxiomatizations involving all the various logico-mathematical\noperators, co-functioning in grammatically complex axioms. His\napproach was therefore quite unlike the more \u2018natural\u2019 one\nof Gentzen, which was single-operator focused. Moreover, the\nunnatural approach was still Carnap\u2019s preferred choice in work\nas late as his Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (Carnap\n 1939).[44]\n We mention Carnap in contrast with Gentzen here because of\nGentzen\u2019s tragic early death at the end of the Second World War.\nWho knows how Gentzen might have extended his exquisitely conceived\ninferentialist techniques to items on the broad logicist agenda? His\nwritings appeared in English translation only in 1969 (see Gentzen\n1934/1935 [1969]). Carnap, however, did survive to exert considerable\ninfluence on the thinking of a new generation of philosophers of\nmathematics on the problems and prospects for logicism; and he was\nable to do so from the mid-1930s, in the USA, writing in English.\n\nAfter the early 1940s, proof theory did not broaden and diversify so\nas to address a potentially fertile agenda: an investigation of the\nvarious forms that introduction and elimination rules might take, as\nit examines rule-governed expressions whose rules are not quite so\nneatly classifiable as introduction and elimination rules. This is the\ncase, for example, with families of \u2018coeval\u2019 and\ninterdependent concepts of a nevertheless logico-mathematical kind. An\nexample of such a family is that of the ordered pair of any\ntwo things; the first member of any ordered pair; and the\nsecond member of the same. An important feature of this\nexample, and of other examples that could be given, is that the\noperators in question are term-forming operators. Gentzen had\nconfined his study to sentence-forming operators. Perhaps it was\nTarski\u2019s theory of truth for formalized languages (see Tarski\n1956 [1933]) that deflected interest away from further development of\nthis essentially inferentialist approach to the meanings of\nlogical and mathematical operators.\n4.2 Anti-realism and an inferentialist approach to logicism\n\nAn inferentialist approach holds special appeal for the semantic\nanti-realist. According to Michael Dummett\u2019s influential\ncharacterization of semantic realism, the realist is one who believes\nthat every declarative sentence of one\u2019s language is\ndeterminately true or false, independently of our means of coming to\nknow which. This is what is supposed to justify the realist\u2019s\nuse of strictly classical logical principles such as the Law of\nExcluded Middle. The anti-realist, by contrast, insists that all\ntruths are knowable; and is quick to point out that we do not\nhave any effective method for deciding the truth or falsity of\nstatements in mathematics. Anti-realists, accordingly, reject the Law\nof Excluded Middle (and all other strictly classical rules that are\nintuitionistically equivalent to it), and advocate the use of\nintuitionistic or constructive logic, rather than classical logic.\n\nAn anti-realist concerned to demonstrate the analyticity of the basic\nlaws of arithmetic would inquire whether one can eschew strictly\nclassical passages of inference when deriving the Peano postulates.\nFor, if those postulates are analytically true, then the anti-realist\nwould expect to attain them by means of rules justifiable by appeal\nonly to the constructive contents involved (see Rumfitt 1999). And\nindeed the anti-realist can. She can avoid recourse to the full power\nof Hume\u2019s Principle. The innocuous ingredients of the conceptual\ncontent of Hume\u2019s Principle, insofar as finite numbers are\nconcerned, will find expression in the inferential rules that the\nanti-realist lays down for zero, #, and successor. Heyting arithmetic,\nafter all, has exactly the same axioms as Peano arithmetic, and is the\nlogical closure of those axioms under intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. The two systems PA and HA differ only in respect of\nthe logic used for closure. It would be rather odd if the intuitionist\nwere debarred from being a logicist in the sense at issue here.\n\nThe pursuit of analyticity in the foundations of arithmetic is one\nthat could be very well served by the proof-theoretic methods favored\nby the Dummettian anti-realist\u2019s theory of meaning. Central to\nsuch a proof-theoretic approach is the formulation of inferential\nrules governing all the expression-forming operators in\nquestion\u2014rules that come, preferably, in\nintroduction-elimination pairs. The rules are constitutive of the\nrespective operators\u2019 meanings; whence results proved solely by\nmeans of those rules qualify as analytic. A question that will be\nraised by any alert meaning-theorist, therefore, is the following:\nMight there not be some anti-realist (constructive, or intuitionistic)\nderivation, in Fregean spirit, of the basic laws of arithmetic by\nappeal to suitable meaning-constituting rules of inference that\nconform to the general requirements of an anti-realist theory of\nmeaning? Anti-realist doctrine invites such extension to the\nmathematical expressions in fundamental theories such as arithmetic.\nIt could give Fregean logicists what they are seeking: fundamental\nderivations of the Dedekind-Peano postulates from more basic logical\nprinciples, logical principles that are at least as secure,\nepistemically, as the mathematical postulates they are seeking to\nderive.\n4.3 Execution\n\nA theory of this kind, called constructive logicism, was\npresented in Tennant (1987). Its distinguishing features may be\nsummarized as follows.\n\nFinitude: It proves the existence of numbers of\nconcepts with at most finite extensions;\nLogical weakness: it uses only free\nintuitionistic relevant logic;\nConceptual Adequacy: It proves all instances of\nSchema N (for which, see below);\nRigor: It provides a \u2018fully rigorous\ndeduction of the Peano postulates\u2019 (Burgess 2005:\n 147).[45]\nSingle-barreled abstraction: Its basic principles\nare rules of inference effecting \u2018single-barreled\u2019\nabstraction.\n\n\nConstructive logicism departs altogether from both the formal method\nof the Grundgesetze, with its double-barreled abstraction\nprinciple Basic Law V, and from the use of use Hume\u2019s Principle,\nwhich is many neo-logicists\u2019 choice of starting point\u2014but\ndouble-barreled once again. It is essential (and prophylactically\nsufficient) to make this departure in a free logic, that is,\na logic free of the dogmatic (and straitjacketing) Fregean assumption\nthat every well-formed singular term of one\u2019s language must\ndenote some object. Single-barreled abstraction principles can be\nformulated in free logic as introduction and elimination rules for any\nvariable-binding abstraction operator \\(\\alpha\\), governing its\noccurrences in canonical identity statements of the form \\(t\n= @ xA(x)\\). The constructive logicist, of course, seeks to take\n\\(\\#\\) for \\(@\\).\n\nDetails of this alternative approach, in pursuit of neologicist\nderivation of the theories not only of natural numbers, but also of\nrational and real numbers, are to be found in Tennant 2022. The\napproach can also be applied to set theory itself; see Tennant\nforthcoming. There, the revealed \u2018logic of sets\u2019 is what\nQuine called virtual set theory: the body of doctrine that we\nwould call analytic, concerning the interconnections among\nset-abstraction, predication, and membership, without making any\nontological commitments. Zermelo\u2019s Axiom of Extensionality is\nderivable as a logical theorem on this approach.\n\nConstructive logicism is based on rules of natural deduction that are\narguably analytic of the central notions zero (0), successor \\((s)\\),\nand \u2018number of\u2019 (\\(\\#\\)). The rules pin down the meaning\nof the number-term-forming operator \\(\\# x\\Phi(x)\\) (the number of\n\\(\\Phi\\)s). In the terminology introduced above, the rules for \\(\\#\nx\\) amount to a single-barreled abstraction principle. The\nremaining rules are allowed to carry only very local and modest\nontological commitment, on the grounds that it is part of the very\nmeaning of a term such as \u20180\u2019 that its use in the language\ncommits one to the existence of the number 0. Here, for example, are\nthe natural-deduction rules governing zero. \u2018\\(\\bot\\)\u2019 is\nthe symbol for absurdity.\n\n\n \n\\[\\text{0-Introduction }\\frac{\n\\begin{array}{c} \n\\underbrace{{\\scriptsize (i)}\\dfrac{\\ }{F(a)}\\ \\ \\dfrac{\\ }{\\exists!a}{\\scriptsize (i)}}  \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \\bot \\end{array} }\n{ 0 = \\# xF(x) }{\\scriptsize{(i)}}\\]\n \n \n\\[\\text{0-Elimination }\\frac{0= \\# xF(x) \\quad \\exists !t F(t)}{\\bot }\n\\]\n  \n\n(where the parameter \\(a\\) may occur only in the\nassumptions)\n \n\n\nIn order to temper the modest commitment just mentioned, all\nderivations are constructed within a free logic, so that all\nexistential commitments other than those incurred by the rules\nthemselves would have to be made\n explicit.[46]\n All of the existential commitments that the constructive logicist\nincurs in this way will be incurred, anyway, by the HP-er who\nadvocates Hume\u2019s Principle in its unrestricted form. Recall that\nthe HP-er is committed, not only to the number of all natural numbers,\nbut also to the number of all self-identical things.\n\nThe ontological bill for the constructive logicist is much more\nmodest, compared to that of the HP-er. The constructive logicist is\nnot even committed (by the rules he lays down) to the existence of the\nnumber of all natural numbers. Commitment is incurred (by employing\nFrege\u2019s trick) to the natural numbers seriatim, as\nnecessary existents. No commitment is incurred, however, to any other\ncardinal numbers.\n\nChapter 25 of Tennant (1987), titled \u201cOn deriving the basic laws\nof arithmetic: Or, how to Frege\u2013Wright a Dedekind-Peano\u201d,\nprovides detailed formal derivations of the Dedekind-Peano axioms,\nwithin a free, intuitionistic relevant logic. All the derivations\ngiven are intuitionistic, in conformity with the anti-realist\naspirations explained above, and in order to warrant the adjective\n\u2018constructive\u2019 in the phrase \u2018constructive\nlogicism\u2019.\n\nHeck (1997b) dealt with so-called \u2018finite Frege\narithmetic\u2019. His treatment was classical. But Heck was\nconcerned, as constructive logicism had been, to derive the basic laws\nof arithmetic while incurring ontological commitment only to the\nnatural numbers. To this end Heck restricted Hume\u2019s Principle to\npredicates with finite extensions. It is therefore natural to\nconjecture that constructive logicism is the intuitionistic\n(relevant) fragment of Heck\u2019s finite Frege arithmetic.\n\nTennant (1987) argues that a condition of adequacy for any logicist\ntheory is to explain the applicability of the finite cardinals (see p.\n234). Let \\(\\exists_n xFx\\) be the formula of first-order logic with\nidentity, defined inductively in the usual way, that says that there\nare exactly \\(n F\\)s. Let \\(\\underline{n}\\) be the numeral denoting\nthe natural number \\(n\\), that is, \u201c\\(s\\ldots s0\\)\u201d, with\n\\(n\\) occurrences of the successor symbol \\(s\\). Schema N is the\nfollowing biconditional, an instance of which is obtained by fixing on\na particular natural number \\(n\\) and open formula \\(\\Phi\\).\n\n\\[\n\\tag{Schema N} \\# x\\Phi x = \\underline{n} \\leftrightarrow \\exists_n x\\Phi x.\n\\]\n\n\nAn adequate theory of number would allow one to derive every instance\nof Schema\n N;[47]\n and the theory of constructive logicism does that. Tennant suggests\nthat this constitutes a solution to the problem of the applicability\nof natural numbers in counting finite collections.\n\nAll the logicist accounts discussed so far dealt only with zero,\nsuccessor, and \u201c\u2026is a natural number\u201d. But there\nare important differences among them. It is not at all clear that\nconstructive logicism has the same high consistency-strength of Frege\nArithmetic. There appears to be no way to derive, within the\nconstructive logicist system, an existence claim of the form\n\n\\[\n\\exists y(y = \\# xF(x)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the extension of \\(F\\) is an infinite set (such as the set of\nall natural numbers). Contrast this with the fact that FA proves\n\n\\[\\exists y(y = \\# x(x \\text{ is a natural\nnumber})).\\]\n\n\nThe present author therefore conjectures that the consistency-strength\nof this system is lower than that of FA.\n\nIn Tennant (2009), the constructive logicist treatment is extended to\ndeal with both addition and multiplication. The key innovation is a\n\u2018logic of orderly pairing\u2019: a system of natural-deduction\nrules of inference governing the formation of the ordered pair\n\\(\\pi(t,u)\\) from existing objects \\(t\\) and \\(u\\), and the\nprojections \\(\\lambda(u)\\) of the left, and \\(\\varrho(u)\\) of the\nright, member of any ordered pair \\(u\\).\n5. Modal Neo-Logicism\n\nZalta (1999) proposes an interestingly different, because\nmodal-logical, route to the natural numbers. Although Zalta\ndoes not himself classify it as such, his approach would appear to\nwarrant the adjective \u2018neo-logicist\u2019. (We prescind from\nquestions about the logical status of modal logic.)\n\nZalta employs a classical second-order modal logic (S5) with identity,\nand with both the first-order Barcan \u2018formula\u2019, or\naxiom-scheme \n\\[\\Diamond \\exists x\\psi(x) \\rightarrow \\exists x\\Diamond \\psi(x).\\]\n\n\nand its second-order correlate \n\\[\\Diamond \\exists F\\psi(F)\n\\rightarrow \\exists F\\Diamond \\psi(F).\\]\n\n\nThe first-order Barcan formula forces one to interpret quantifiers as\nranging over all possible individuals, whatever world one is\n\u2018in\u2019\u2014no \u2018expansion\u2019 or\n\u2018contraction\u2019 of the domain can be involved as one\ntraverses the accessibility relation from possible world to possible\nworld.\n\nThe logic is free, and descriptive terms (the description operator\n\\(\\iota\\) is primitive) are interpreted rigidly\u2014that is, the\ndenotation of a descriptive term in the actual world, if it has one\nthere, is its denotation in any other possible world.\n\nThere are the usual alethic modalities \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\) of\nnecessity and possibility (as interpreted by S5, of course), and the\nactuality operator \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). The relation \\(xF\\) of\nencoding can hold between an abstract object \\(x\\)\nand a property \\(F\\).\n\n\n\\(Ax\\) will mean that \\(x\\) is an abstract object. The properties that\nan abstract object encodes are constitutive of its nature, and as\nsuch, are essential to its identity as an object. (Zalta 1993:\n396)\n\n\nFor example, Plato\u2019s Form of a Triangle encodes the property of\nbeing a triangle, but does not exemplify it.\n\nAmong Zalta\u2019s fundamental principles are the following.\n\nOrdinary objects cannot encode any properties.\nGiven any condition on properties, some abstract object encodes\njust those properties meeting that condition.\nIdentical individuals are intersubstitutable salva\nveritate.\nIdentical properties are intersubstitutable salva\nveritate.\nParticular encodings are necessary if possible.\n\n\nZalta defines an equinumerosity relation \\(\\approx\\) among properties\nwith respect to ordinary objects\u2014that is, the\npossibly concrete ones. With \\(\\approx\\) in hand, Zalta\noffers the notion of a (cardinal) number (Zalta 1993: 630):\n\n\\[\\textit{Numbers}(x,G) \\equiv_{df} Ax \\wedge \\forall F(xF \\leftrightarrow F \\approx G).\\]\n\n\nIt follows that \\(x\\) numbers \\(G\\) just in case \\(x\\) is an abstract\nobject that encodes exactly the properties equinumerous to \\(G\\)\n(where, nota bene, equinumerosity is judged only with respect\nto the ordinary objects). And it follows easily from\nZalta\u2019s first principles that \u201cfor every property \\(G\\),\nthere is a unique object which numbers \\(G\\)\u201d.\n\nZalta\u2019s system delivers Hume\u2019s Principle: \n\\[\\# F = \\# G \\leftrightarrow F \\approx G,\\]\n\n\nand the following obvious corollary: \n\\[\\forall G\\exists y(y = \\# G).\\]\n\n\nIn this regard Zalta\u2019s system is as powerful as Wright\u2019s:\nthey both guarantee for every property its number. Wright, however,\nbegins with Hume\u2019s Principle as a first principle, whereas Zalta\nderives Hume\u2019s Principle (as Frege originally did) from his own\n\u2018more basic\u2019 (and possibly more powerful) principles.\n\nWe note the following three points, in concluding our exposition of\nZalta\u2019s system. In his sense of \u2018concrete\u2019 and\n\u2018abstract\u2019,\n\nProperties holding of ordinary objects can be assigned\nnumbers.\nProperties holding of abstract objects (including numbers\nthemselves), cannot be assigned numbers.\nThe existence of all infinitely many natural numbers depends on\nthe possible existence of unboundedly (but finitely) many concrete\nobjects.\n\n\nIn points (2) and (3), Zalta departs explicitly from Frege and all\nother (neo-)logicists discussed above.\n6. Recent Work Inspired by the Grundgesetze, or Departing From It\n\nWe have seen that there has been a revival of interest in neologicism\nsince the early 1980s. One of the ways in which work in this period\nhas sought to rescue logicism from Fregean disaster (without\nsacrificing Basic Law V altogether, and without invoking HP as a\nstarting point) has been the study of various \u2018fragments of\nGrundgesetze\u2019. The collectively shared idea of this\ncompany of scholars, deriving from Parsons 1987, is as follows:\nFrege\u2019s Grundgesetze succumbed to Russell\u2019s Paradox.\nBut Frege\u2019s system is a big one. Let us see if we can extract a\nfragment of it that is (a) consistent, and (b) strong enough to afford\na decent amount of\n Arithmetik.[48]\n This is typical of standard consistency-restoring revisions of\ntheories troubled by inconsistency, but whose main goal(s) one is\ntrying to salvage from the wreckage. The progress that has been made\nin this direction thus far is worth reporting. We shall call these\ntheoretical efforts \u2018fragmenting\u2019.\n\nThe fragmenting scholars just mentioned all take as primitive a\nterm-forming variable-binding abstraction operator that applies to\npredicates to form singular terms. Their notational choices for this\noperator vary. Here we shall speak generically of terms of the form\n\\(@xA(x)\\). For \\(@\\), Parsons follows Frege in using a breath mark\n(like a comma) placed above the variable \\(x\\). Heck uses a\ncaret (circumflex) placed immediately before \\(x\\), and\nplaces a period immediately after \\(x\\) in the variable-binding\nprefix. Wehmeier uses the caret placed immediately above\n\\(x\\). Boccuni (not exactly a fragmenter\u2014see below) uses the\nformulation \\(\\{x:A(x)\\}\\) with a colon where contemporary set\ntheorists would have a solidus: \\(\\{x \\mid A(x)\\}\\). Each of these\nauthors is therefore using some form of set- or class-abstraction\nterms, formed by means of a variable-binding abstraction operator.\n\nReturning to our use of \\(@\\) as a generic symbol covering each of\nthese idiosyncratic variants, we remind the reader that Basic Law V,\nin schematic form (where \\(A(x)\\) and \\(B(x)\\) are\nplaceholders for formulae), would be expressed as \n\\[@xA(x)=@xB(x)\\leftrightarrow\\forall x(A(x)\\leftrightarrow B(x)).\\]\n\n\nBasic Law V in axiomatic form would be second-order:\n\n\\[ \\forall F \\forall G [@xF(x) = @xG(x) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x(F(x)\n\\leftrightarrow G(x))].  \\]\n\n\nParsons 1987 gives a model-theoretic proof that schema V is\nconsistent with first-order logic. (This had been conjectured by\nSchroeder-Heister 1987.) J. Burgess 1998 gives a proof-theoretic and\nconstructive proof of the same result. Heck 1996 extends\nParsons\u2019 argument to prove that both the simple and the ramified\npredicative fragments of Frege\u2019s system are consistent.\nWehmeier 1999 provides a consistency proof for a theory in monadic\nsecond-order logic, consisting of axiom V and a higher-order\ncomprehension principle. Ferreira and Wehmeier 2002 proves the\nconsistency of schema V and the same comprehension\nprinciple. The higher-order principle in question is known as\n \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\)-comprehension.[49]\n\nAnother recent innovation akin to the study of proper fragments of\nGrundgesetze involves use of the resources of the logic of\n plural quantification.\n This of course takes us out of the realm of genuine\nfragments of Grundgesetze. But the ideas are closely\nrelated to those of the foregoing fragmenters.\n\nBoccuni 2011 provides an interpretation for a language admitting\nplural quantification, an interpretation that Boccuni argues makes\ntrue every instance of the principles constituting the system she\ncalls PG (short for \u2018Plural Grundgesetze\u2019). These\nare a Plural Comprehension Principle, a Predicative Comprehension\nPrinciple, and Schema V. Boccuni 2013 presents PG as \u2018a\nconsistent second-order system which is aimed [at deriving]\nsecond-order Peano\n arithmetic\u2019.[50]\n\nAnother recent innovation in the quest for a workable neologicist\nunderstanding of Fregean (double-barreled) abstraction that is worthy\nof mention was by Studd 2016. As he points out,\n\n\nThe key drawback with existing responses in this style [i.e., avoiding\n\u2018full second-order logic with an impredicative comprehension\nprinciple for Concepts\u2019] is that they undermine the neologicist\nrecovery of mathematics. Frege\u2019s theorem relies on full\nsecond-order logic. The predicative theory, and its ramified variants,\nare too weak to interpret second-order arithmetic, PA\\(_2\\) (see John\nP. Burgess 2005, ch. 2).\n\n\nIn his exposition Studd eschews the use of plural logic, but makes\nremarks along the way to the effect that one could use plural-logical\nlanguage to express his claims, if one so wished. He reverts to\nconsideration of abstractive terms. He diagnoses the problem of\nfinding an \u201cadequacy criterion \u2026 to sift the\n\u2018good\u2019 [double-barreled\u2014NT] abstraction principles\nlike Hume\u2019s principle from the \u2018bad\u2019 ones like Basic\nLaw V.\u201d He concludes that this approach to the bad company\nproblem\n\n\nis on the wrong track \u2026 if neologicists are to retain the\nambition of extending their success with arithmetic to other branches\nof mathematics, including standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set\ntheory.\n\n\nStudd diagnoses the problem with double-barreled abstraction\nprinciples as arising from the fact that they are static.\nThey are taken to govern an all-inclusive domain that cannot itself be\nextended with denotations for the abstractive terms featuring on the\nleft-hand side. Studd proposes that we should instead conceive of\nabstraction as dynamic, in allowing for extension of the\ndomain by the newly abstracted abstracta. And he formulates a theory\nof double-barreled abstraction that would permit this.\n7. Summary of Problems for Logicism\n\nWe see from the foregoing discussion that there are various problems\nto be faced by extant versions of logicism or neo-logicism in the\nliterature. The reader who remains mindful of them will be in a\nposition to examine the details of any proposed new neo-logicist\naccount with a more critically focused eye.\n\nSome of these problems confront any version of logicism, and their\nsolutions might be required as \u2018conditions of adequacy\u2019 on\nthe latter. Others among these problems arise only in response to the\nparticular methods or posits employed by the version of logicism under\nconsideration. The following problems appear to have loomed large in\nthe foregoing discussion.\n\nFrege\u2019s \u2018conceptualization\nproblem\u2019\n\nHow do we apprehend numbers, if we are persuaded that arithmetic is\nnot grounded in Kant\u2019s \u201cpure form of intuition of\ntime\u201d? As Frege put it in Grundlagen \u00a762:\n\u201cHow \u2026 are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have\nany ideas or intuitions of them?\u201d\nFrege\u2019s \u2018Julius Caesar problem\u2019\n\nHow can one show that, given a would-be logicist account of the nature\nof numbers, Julius Caesar is not a number? More generally:\nhow can one show, on such an account, that no number is a concrete\nindividual?\nThe \u2018applicability problem\u2019\n\nCan the logicist account for (i) how natural numbers may be\napplied in counting finite collections, and (ii) how real\nnumbers may be applied in measuring continuously varying magnitudes\nsuch as lengths, periods of time, etc.?\nThe \u2018inclusion problem\u2019\n\nHow does one show that the natural number \\(n\\) is the very\nsame abstract object as the integer \\(n\\), the\nrational number \\(n\\), and the real number \\(n\\)?\n(See footnote 40.)\nThe \u2018abstraction problem\u2019\n\nWhat is the correct form for number-abstraction principles (to be\nespoused by those who hold that numbers are logical\nabstracta)?\nThe \u2018analyticity problem\u2019\n\nCan one demonstrate that one\u2019s chosen number-abstraction\nprinciples are analytic?\nThe \u2018existence problem\u2019\n\nCan Logic commit one to the existence of any thing, or kind of\n thing?[51]\nThe \u2018infinity problem\u2019\n\nIs the logicist permitted to simply postulate an Axiom of\nInfinity, to the effect that there are infinitely many things (perhaps\nof a certain kind)?\nThe \u2018demarcation problem\u2019\n\nWhat makes something a logical constant? Which notions commonly held\nto be mathematical can actually be defined, implicitly or otherwise,\nin a properly formulated Logic for logicism?[52]\n\u2018Bad\n Company\u2019,[53]\n or \u2018Embarrassment of Riches\u2019\n\nSome abstraction principles are inconsistent. Yet others, though\nindividually consistent, are mutually inconsistent. How then can we\nknow, of any proposed abstraction principle, whether we should accept\nit?\n\u2018Theoretical Invariance\u2019\n\nNatural numbers are universally applicable; they enjoy their\narithmetical properties and enter into their arithmetical relations\nnecessarily, independently of what other kinds of things there might\nbe, and of how these things might be. So abstraction principles for\nnatural numbers should be consistent with any consistent theory about\nany domain of discourse. Are they?\n\n",
