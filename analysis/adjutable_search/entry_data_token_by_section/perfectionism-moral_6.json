    "main_text": "Perfectionist Ethics || Self-Regarding Duties\n2.3 Self-Regarding Duties\n\n\nHuman beings should care about their own perfection as well as the\nperfection of others. As we have seen, the standard of perfection\nis objective in the sense that it guides, or should guide, human\naction, even if it what it recommends is not desired. These\nclaims explain why perfectionism assigns an important place to\nself-regarding duties. A self-regarding duty to develop\none\u2019s talents, if there is such a duty, is categorical. One\nhas the duty whether or not one has a desire to fulfill it.\n\n\nThe possibility of self-regarding duties of this kind are sometimes\nrejected on conceptual grounds. Moral duties concern one\u2019s\ntreatment of others, and so a moral duty to oneself is a confused\nnotion. But this worry should not detain us for long. The\nkey point is that we can have categorical reasons to develop our nature\nor to engage in valuable, as opposed to worthless, activities. It\nis a secondary issue whether we should classify a self-regarding duty\nas a moral duty or as (merely) a categorical non-moral duty (Raz\n1994, 40). But while the worry should not detain us, it does point\nto an attractive feature of perfectionist ethics. Much\ncontemporary moral theory ignores duties to oneself, whether understood\nas moral duties or not, and focuses exclusively on our duties toward\nothers. Perfectionist ethics is an important corrective to this\ntendency. By expanding the domain of ethical concern, it has the\npotential to enrich contemporary moral philosophy (Hurka 1993, 5).\n\n\nDifferent perfectionist theories offer different accounts of the\ncontent of self-regarding duties. Generally speaking, it is\nuseful to distinguish negative from positive duties to oneself.\nNegative duties are duties to refrain from damaging or destroying\none\u2019s capacity to lead a good life. For example, barring\nexceptional circumstances, one has duties to refrain from suicide and\nself-mutilation. Positive duties, by contrast, are duties to\nexercise one\u2019s capacity to develop one\u2019s nature and/or to\nrealize perfectionist goods. For example, one has a duty to\ndevelop one\u2019s talents and not to devote one\u2019s life entirely\nto idleness and pleasure (Kant 1797).\n\n\nSpecific negative and positive self-regarding duties are derived\nfrom the more comprehensive duty to oneself to do what one can to lead\na good or excellent life. It is probably true, as Aristotle\npointed out, that the success of one\u2019s life depends on factors\noutside of one\u2019s control. If so, then no one can have a\nduty to lead a good life. Still, excluding the effects of luck,\nwe can say that each human being will have a more or less successful\nlife depending on the decisions they make and the options they\npursue. And we can add that each human being has a comprehensive\nduty to lead a successful life, to the extent that it is within his or\nher power to do so.\n\n\nStated at this level of abstraction, the perfectionist case for\naffirming self-regarding duties does not look particularly\ncontroversial. Resistance to it will likely derive from one\nof two quarters. Some will reject the very possibility of\ncategorical duties, whether to oneself or to others. Others will\naccept the possibility of categorical duties, but insist that they are\nlimited to the treatment of others. This latter view, on its\nface, looks unstable. It is likely motivated by the worry that if\nself-regarding duties are acknowledged, then the door is open for\npaternalistic interference. To address this concern, we must turn\nnow from perfectionist ethics to perfectionist politics.\n",
