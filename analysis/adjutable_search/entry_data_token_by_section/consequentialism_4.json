Rights, Relativity, and Rules\n\nAnother problem for utilitarianism is that it seems to overlook\njustice and rights. One common illustration is called Transplant.\nImagine that each of five patients in a hospital will die without an\norgan transplant. The patient in Room 1 needs a heart, the patient in\nRoom 2 needs a liver, the patient in Room 3 needs a kidney, and so on.\nThe person in Room 6 is in the hospital for routine tests. Luckily\n(for them, not for him!), his tissue is compatible with the other five\npatients, and a specialist is available to transplant his organs into\nthe other five. This operation would save all five of their lives,\nwhile killing the \u201cdonor\u201d. There is no other way to save\nany of the other five patients (Foot 1966, Thomson 1976; compare\nrelated cases in Carritt 1947 and McCloskey 1965).\n\nWe need to add that the organ recipients will emerge healthy, the\nsource of the organs will remain secret, the doctor won\u2019t be\ncaught or punished for cutting up the \u201cdonor\u201d, and the\ndoctor knows all of this to a high degree of probability (despite the\nfact that many others will help in the operation). Still, with the\nright details filled in (no matter how unrealistic), it looks as if\ncutting up the \u201cdonor\u201d will maximize utility, since five\nlives have more utility than one life (assuming that the five lives do\nnot contribute too much to overpopulation). If so, then classical\nutilitarianism implies that it would not be morally wrong for the\ndoctor to perform the transplant and even that it would be morally\nwrong for the doctor not to perform the transplant. Most people find\nthis result abominable. They take this example to show how bad it can\nbe when utilitarians overlook individual rights, such as the unwilling\ndonor\u2019s right to life.\n\nUtilitarians can bite the bullet, again. They can deny that it is\nmorally wrong to cut up the \u201cdonor\u201d in these\ncircumstances. Of course, doctors still should not cut up their\npatients in anything close to normal circumstances, but this example\nis so abnormal and unrealistic that we should not expect our normal\nmoral rules to apply, and we should not trust our moral intuitions,\nwhich evolved to fit normal situations (Sprigge 1965). Many\nutilitarians are happy to reject common moral intuitions in this case,\nlike many others (cf. Singer 1974, Unger 1996, Norcross 1997).\n\nMost utilitarians lack such strong stomachs (or teeth), so they modify\nutilitarianism to bring it in line with common moral intuitions,\nincluding the intuition that doctors should not cut up innocent\npatients. One attempt claims that a killing is worse than a death. The\ndoctor would have to kill the \u201cdonor\u201d in order to prevent\nthe deaths of the five patients, but nobody is killed if the five\npatients die. If one killing is worse than five deaths that do not\ninvolve killing, then the world that results from the doctor\nperforming the transplant is worse than the world that results from\nthe doctor not performing the transplant. With this new theory of\nvalue, consequentialists can agree with others that it is morally\nwrong for the doctor to cut up the \u201cdonor\u201d in this\nexample.\n\nA modified example still seems problematic. Just suppose that the five\npatients need a kidney, a lung, a heart, and so forth because they\nwere all victims of murder attempts. Then the world will contain the\nfive killings of them if they die, but not if they do not die. Thus,\neven if killings are worse than deaths that are not killings, the\nworld will still be better overall (because it will contain fewer\nkillings as well as fewer deaths) if the doctor cuts up the\n\u201cdonor\u201d to save the five other patients. But most people\nstill think it would be morally wrong for the doctor to kill the one\nto prevent the five killings. The reason is that it is not the doctor\nwho kills the five, and the doctor\u2019s duty seems to be to reduce\nthe amount of killing that she herself does. In this view, the doctor\nis not required to promote life or decrease death or even\ndecrease killing by other people. The doctor is, instead, required to\nhonor the value of life by not causing loss of life (cf.\nPettit 1997).\n\nThis kind of case leads some consequentialists to introduce\nagent-relativity into their theory of value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,\nPortmore 2001, 2003, 2011). To apply a consequentialist moral theory,\nwe need to compare the world with the transplant to the world without\nthe transplant. If this comparative evaluation must be agent-neutral,\nthen, if an observer judges that the world with the transplant is\nbetter, the agent must make the same judgment, or else one of them is\nmistaken. However, if such evaluations can be agent-relative, then it\ncould be legitimate for an observer to judge that the world with the\ntransplant is better (since it contains fewer killings by anyone),\nwhile it is also legitimate for the doctor as agent to judge that the\nworld with the transplant is worse (because it includes a killing\nby him). In other cases, such as competitions, it might\nmaximize the good from an agent\u2019s perspective to do an act,\nwhile maximizing the good from an observer\u2019s perspective to stop\nthe agent from doing that very act. If such agent-relative value makes\nsense, then it can be built into consequentialism to produce the claim\nthat an act is morally wrong if and only if the act\u2019s\nconsequences include less overall value from the perspective of the\nagent. This agent-relative consequentialism, plus the claim\nthat the world with the transplant is worse from the perspective of\nthe doctor, could justify the doctor\u2019s judgment that it would be\nmorally wrong for him to perform the transplant. A key move here is to\nadopt the agent\u2019s perspective in judging the agent\u2019s act.\nAgent-neutral consequentialists judge all acts from the\nobserver\u2019s perspective, so they would judge the doctor\u2019s\nact to be wrong, since the world with the transplant is better from an\nobserver\u2019s perspective. In contrast, an agent-relative approach\nrequires observers to adopt the doctor\u2019s perspective in judging\nwhether it would be morally wrong for the doctor to perform the\ntransplant. This kind of agent-relative consequentialism is then\nsupposed to capture commonsense moral intuitions in such cases\n(Portmore 2011).\n\nAgent-relativity is also supposed to solve other problems. W. D. Ross\n(1930, 34\u201335) argued that, if breaking a promise created only\nslightly more happiness overall than keeping the promise, then the\nagent morally ought to break the promise according to classic\nutilitarianism. This supposed counterexample cannot be avoided simply\nby claiming that keeping promises has agent-neutral value, since\nkeeping one promise might prevent someone else from keeping another\npromise. Still, agent-relative consequentialists can respond that\nkeeping a promise has great value from the perspective of the agent\nwho made the promise and chooses whether or not to keep it, so the\nworld where a promise is kept is better from the agent\u2019s\nperspective than another world where the promise is not kept, unless\nenough other values override the value of keeping the promise. In this\nway, agent-relative consequentialists can explain why agents morally\nought not to break their promises in just the kind of case that Ross\nraised.\n\nSimilarly, critics of utilitarianism often argue that utilitarians\ncannot be good friends, because a good friend places more weight on\nthe welfare of his or her friends than on the welfare of strangers,\nbut utilitarianism requires impartiality among all people. However,\nagent-relative consequentialists can assign more weight to the welfare\nof a friend of an agent when assessing the value of the consequences\nof that agent\u2019s acts. In this way, consequentialists try to\ncapture common moral intuitions about the duties of friendship (see\nalso Jackson 1991).\n\nOne final variation still causes trouble. Imagine that the doctor\nherself wounded the five people who need organs. If the doctor does\nnot save their lives, then she will have killed them herself. In this\ncase, even if the doctor can disvalue killings by herself more than\nkillings by other people, the world still seems better from her own\nperspective if she performs the transplant. Critics will object that\nit is, nonetheless, morally wrong for the doctor to perform the\ntransplant. Many people will not find this intuition as clear as in\nthe other cases, but consequentialists who do find it immoral for the\ndoctor to perform the transplant even in this case will need to modify\nconsequentialism in some other way in order to yield the desired\njudgment.\n\nThis problem cannot be solved by building rights or fairness or desert\ninto the theory of value. The five do not deserve to die, and they do\ndeserve their lives, just as much as the one does. Each option\nviolates someone\u2019s right not to be killed and is unfair to\nsomeone. So consequentialists need more than just new values if they\nwant to avoid endorsing this transplant.\n\nOne option is to go indirect. A direct consequentialist holds\nthat the moral qualities of something depend only on the consequences\nof that very thing. Thus, a direct consequentialist about motives\nholds that the moral qualities of a motive depend on the consequences\nof that motive. A direct consequentialist about virtues holds that the\nmoral qualities of a character trait (such as whether or not it is a\nmoral virtue) depend on the consequences of that trait (Driver 2001a,\nHurka 2001, Jamieson 2005, Bradley 2005). A direct consequentialist\nabout acts holds that the moral qualities of an act depend on the\nconsequences of that act. Someone who adopts direct consequentialism\nabout everything is a global direct consequentialist (Pettit\nand Smith 2000, Driver 2012).\n\nIn contrast, an indirect consequentialist holds that the\nmoral qualities of something depend on the consequences of something\nelse. One indirect version of consequentialism is motive\nconsequentialism, which claims that the moral qualities of an act\ndepend on the consequences of the motive of that act (compare Adams\n1976 and Sverdlik 2011). Another indirect version is virtue\nconsequentialism, which holds that whether an act is morally\nright depends on whether it stems from or expresses a state of\ncharacter that maximizes good consequences and, hence, is a\nvirtue.\n\nThe most common indirect consequentialism is rule\nconsequentialism, which makes the moral rightness of an act\ndepend on the consequences of a rule (Singer 1961). Since a rule is an\nabstract entity, a rule by itself strictly has no consequences. Still,\nobedience rule consequentialists can ask what would happen if\neverybody obeyed a rule or what would happen if everybody violated a\nrule. They might argue, for example, that theft is morally wrong\nbecause it would be disastrous if everybody broke a rule against\ntheft. Often, however, it does not seem morally wrong to break a rule\neven though it would cause disaster if everybody broke it. For\nexample, if everybody broke the rule \u201cHave some children\u201d,\nthen our species would die out, but that hardly shows it is morally\nwrong not to have any children. Luckily, our species will not die out\nif everyone is permitted not to have children, since enough people\nwant to have children. Thus, instead of asking, \u201cWhat would\nhappen if everybody did that?\u201d, rule consequentialists should\nask, \u201cWhat would happen if everybody were permitted to do\nthat?\u201d People are permitted to do what violates no accepted\nrule, so asking what would happen if everybody were permitted to do an\nact is just the flip side of asking what would happen if people\naccepted a rule that forbids that act. Such acceptance rule\nconsequentialists then claim that an act is morally wrong if and\nonly if it violates a rule whose acceptance has better consequences\nthan the acceptance of any incompatible rule. In some accounts, a rule\nis accepted when it is built into individual consciences (Brandt\n1992). Other rule utilitarians, however, require that moral rules be\npublicly known (Gert 2005; cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2003b) or built into\npublic institutions (Rawls 1955). Then they hold what can be called\npublic acceptance rule consequentialism: an act is morally\nwrong if and only if it violates a rule whose public acceptance\nmaximizes the good.\n\nThe indirectness of such rule utilitarianism provides a way to remain\nconsequentialist and yet capture the common moral intuition that it is\nimmoral to perform the transplant in the above situation. Suppose\npeople generally accepted a rule that allows a doctor to transplant\norgans from a healthy person without consent when the doctor believes\nthat this transplant will maximize utility. Widely accepting this rule\nwould lead to many transplants that do not maximize utility, since\ndoctors (like most people) are prone to errors in predicting\nconsequences and weighing utilities. Moreover, if the rule is publicly\nknown, then patients will fear that they might be used as organ\nsources, so they would be less likely to go to a doctor when they need\none. The medical profession depends on trust that this public rule\nwould undermine. For such reasons, some rule utilitarians conclude\nthat it would not maximize utility for people generally to accept a\nrule that allows doctors to transplant organs from unwilling donors.\nIf this claim is correct, then rule utilitarianism implies that it is\nmorally wrong for a particular doctor to use an unwilling donor, even\nfor a particular transplant that would have better consequences than\nany alternative even from the doctor\u2019s own perspective. Common\nmoral intuition is thereby preserved.\n\nRule utilitarianism faces several potential counterexamples (such as\nwhether public rules allowing slavery could sometimes maximize\nutility) and needs to be formulated more precisely (particularly in\norder to avoid collapsing into act-utilitarianism; cf. Lyons 1965).\nSuch details are discussed in another entry in this encyclopedia (see\nHooker on rule-consequentialism). Here I will just point out that\ndirect consequentialists find it convoluted and implausible to judge a\nparticular act by the consequences of something else (Smart 1956). Why\nshould mistakes by other doctors in other cases make this\ndoctor\u2019s act morally wrong, when this doctor knows for sure that\nhe is not mistaken in this case? Rule consequentialists can respond\nthat we should not claim special rights or permissions that we are not\nwilling to grant to every other person, and that it is arrogant to\nthink we are less prone to mistakes than other people are. However,\nthis doctor can reply that he is willing to give everyone the right to\nviolate the usual rules in the rare cases when they do know for sure\nthat violating those rules really maximizes utility. Anyway, even if\nrule utilitarianism accords with some common substantive moral\nintuitions, it still seems counterintuitive in other ways. This makes\nit worthwhile to consider how direct consequentialists can bring their\nviews in line with common moral intuitions, and whether they need to\ndo so.\n",
