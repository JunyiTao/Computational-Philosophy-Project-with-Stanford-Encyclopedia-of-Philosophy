    "main_text": "Case-Based Logical Pluralism || The Argument from Appearances\n1.1 The Argument from Appearances\n\nOne argument for Case-Based Logical Pluralism is the argument from\nappearances (Beall & Restall 2006: 30\u201331). According to the\nargument, pluralism is just straightforwardly plausible\u2014it\nappears to be true\u2014and hence ought to be accepted in the absence\nof reasons not to believe it.\n\nThis might seem like a surprising approach, given the presumption of\nlogical monism in the writings of most logicians of the\npast\u2014presumably pluralism did not appear correct to them. But\nperhaps once one considers the GTT explicitly, accepts the\nunderdetermination of \u201ccase\u201d, and considers a few of the\nways it can be made more precise to get different logics, it just\nseems clear that there will be several alternative ways to make it\nmore specific, with none singled out as more correct than the others\nby current usage. The hardest thing about logical pluralism, one might\nthink, was answering a kind of \u201chow possibly?\u201d-question:\nseeing how it could be a coherent view at all. But once the work of\ndeveloping and laying out the case-based view has been done, the new\nposition can strike one as quite reasonable.\n\nOne problem with this argument is that the plausibility of a view\ntends to vary with the onlooker\u2019s ability to think up reasonable\nalternatives; if a particular view seems like the only reasonable way\na certain thing can have happened, then we might shrug and accept it\nas our best working hypothesis. But if we can conceive of several\ndifferent ways things could plausibly be, we might rationally\nwithhold judgement pending more evidence.\n\nMore specifically, while Case-Based Logical Pluralism is not patently\nimplausible, it does rest on a linguistic picture with two distinctive\nfeatures: first, that the meaning of \u201ccase\u201d is unsettled,\nand second, that given that it is unsettled, the discovery of more\nthan one reasonable precisification should make us pluralists. But\nneither of these features is inevitable. Contemporary philosophy of\nlanguage describes models in which the correctness of the application\nof some ordinary language expressions\u2014such as\n\u201cwater\u201d, \u201celm\u201d or \u201cstar\u201d\u2014can\nturn on the presence or absence of a feature that ordinary speakers\nneed not be able to distinguish, such as having a certain constitution\nor make-up. Why should \u201cvalid\u201d not be similar? That is,\nthough no a priori analysis of \u201cvalid\u201d\nuncovers the single correct precisification of the GTT, there might\nnevertheless exist an account\u2014perhaps making use of\nsophisticated mathematical techniques\u2014that exactly captures the\nextension of \u201cvalid\u201d. Rival accounts would then have the\nsame status as rival accounts of stars or water. Though analysis of\nthe word \u201cstar\u201d will not tell us that stars are\nnot holes in the fabric of the night, or the gods riding their\nchariots across the heavens, those accounts are still wrong.\nSimilarly, though analysis of the expression\n\u201cvalid\u201d might not tell us that intuitionist accounts are\nwrong, they might be wrong nonetheless. In such circumstances we might\nhold that the meaning of \u201cvalid\u201d is not really\nunderspecified.\n\nSecondly, even if the meaning of the expression is underspecified, it\nneedn\u2019t be the case that any precisifications are\ncorrect, and hence pluralism is not an inevitable consequence of the\nunderspecificity. Consider a paradigm underspecified word like\n\u201cheap\u201d and a thinker who presents themselves as a\npluralist about the heap property. They hold that one may specify the\nmeaning of \u201cheap\u201d different ways within certain\nparameters, and arrive at conflicting but equally correct definitions\nof \u201cheap\u201d. For example, the classical heapists might claim\nthat a heap is any pile of items with more than 10 members, deviant\nheapists protest that a heap is any pile of items with more than 13\nmembers and the heap pluralist holds that both are correct. But there\nare lots of alternatives to pluralism here. For example, one might\nthink that anyone who interprets the English word \u201cheap\u201d\nas requiring a pile of n items for any specific n is\nwrong, since they are trying to import more specificity into the\nmeaning of the word than can really be found there. Or one might be a\nskeptic about heaps, on the grounds that the word is too\nvague\u2014it fails to specify a genuine meaning\u2014or one might\nhold that the expression is context-sensitive: in some contexts it\npicks out the classical property, in some the deviant, but argue that\nthat doesn\u2019t make one a pluralist about heaps, anymore than\nacknowledging that \u201cI\u201d picks out different people in\ndifferent contexts makes one a pluralist about oneself.\n\nThe mere possibility of these alternatives does not, by itself, argue\nagainst the pluralist view, but it does undermine the argument from\nappearances. The availability of alternatives makes it clear that the\nintriguing reasonableness of pluralism is not unique.\n",
