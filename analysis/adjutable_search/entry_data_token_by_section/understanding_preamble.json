    "main_text": "\n\nUnderstanding is a protean concept in philosophy, and the desire for\nunderstanding is pervasive in everyday life. Scientists take it as\ntheir goal to understand the world and how it works, teachers and\nparents hope to transmit understanding to their students and children,\nand from a political and social point of view we often strive for\nmutual understanding.\n\nThis entry will look at some ways in which understanding has been\nconceptualized by philosophers\u2014especially epistemologists,\nphilosophers of science, and philosophers of social science. The focus\nwill be on accounts of understanding the natural world and other\npeople, and it will only touch occasionally on accounts of what it\ntakes to understand other items, such as concepts, languages, or\ntexts.\n",
