    "main_text": "\n\nCritical disability theory refers to a diverse, interdisciplinary set\nof theoretical approaches. The task of critical disability theory is\nto analyze disability as a cultural, historical, relative, social, and\npolitical phenomenon. Some call this work \u201ccritical disability\nstudies\u201d or CDS (e.g., Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009; Vehmas\n& Watson 2014). The use of \u201ccritical disability\ntheory\u201d here intends to capture a broader swath of approaches,\nincluding those originating in the field of philosophy. Critical\ndisability theory is a methodology, not a \u201csubject-oriented area\nof study\u201d (Schalk 2017). As a methodology, the theory \n\n\ninvolves scrutinizing not bodily or mental impairments but the social\nnorms that define particular attributes as impairments, as well as the\nsocial conditions that concentrate stigmatized attributes in\nparticular populations. (2017) \n\n\nCritical disability theorists direct their work toward activism,\nhowever, and do not intend insights to remain within academic\nconfines. For example, Julie Avril Minich argues that critical\ndisability theory involves the \n\n\nscrutiny of normative ideologies [that] should occur not for its own\nsake but with the goal of producing knowledge in support of justice\nfor people with stigmatized bodies and minds. (2017) \n\n\nFor this reason, thinkers should \u201crecommit\u201d to\n\u201csocial justice work\u201d, including working in solidarity for\nthe purposes of liberation with people \u201cdevalued\u201d or\n\u201cpathologized\u201d but perhaps not labeled or self-identified\nas disabled (2017). Others have argued that activism such as material\npractices related to access are a central part of critical disability\nscholarship, \u201cwhether in the classroom, at conferences, in web\nspace, or in our writing\u201d (Hamraie 2016).\n\nIn this way, critical disability theory is an emancipatory and\ndeveloping discourse (Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018:\n206; Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 48). Thinkers use the method to\nboth describe the socio-political constructions of disability and\ntrack the impacts of these constructions on oppressed persons,\nincluding but not limited to those to whom the concept\n\u201cdisability\u201d attaches. Critical disability theory, then,\nnecessarily refers to lived experiences and attempts to transform the\ncircumstances under which oppressed subjects live through critical,\nintersectional analysis. Complicating this expansive approach,\naccountability to disabled persons is paramount to this work (Minich\n2016). But, some call for accountability and simultaneously argue that\ncritical disability theory should resist distinctions between disabled\nand non-disabled subjects. Nirmala Erevelles, for example, does not\nseek to claim \u201ceveryone is disabled\u201d but prefers\nhistorically-embedded materialist accounts of disability at\nintersections among multiple categories of analysis, including\n\u201crace, class, gender, nation, and sexual identity\u201d (2014,\ncf. Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 219). Similarly, Alison Kafer refuses\na \u201cfixed definition\u201d of disability. She favors leaving\nopen the boundaries of the concept of disability and, therefore, does\nnot settle who counts as disabled. She uses Joan W. Scott\u2019s\nnotion of \u201ccollective affinity\u201d to describe disability as\na wide net, inhering in no particular persons, but rather describing\ndisability as a complex set of features, attributed to individuals,\nthat pathologize and oppress (2013: 11). At root, as Dianne Pothier\nand Richard Devlin argue, critical disability theory will claim that\n\n\n\ndisability is not fundamentally a question of medicine or health, nor\nis it just an issue of sensitivity and compassion; rather, it is a\nquestion of politics and power(lessness), power over, and power to.\n(2006: 2, as quoted in Gillies 2014 and Sleeter 2010)\n\n\nWhile it is clear, then, that critical disability theory attends to\ndevalued persons, controversy over who the subject of critical\ndisability theory is lies at the heart of the approach. This\ncontroversy strongly signals the import of critical disability\nmethodology for theoretical work more generally. Critical disability\ntheory deals seriously with the heritage and construction of\ndisability identity, but that identity is in flux and related to the\nvery nature of human embodiment. Disability is unique as an\n\u201cidentity category\u201d because \u201canyone can enter [it]\nat any time, and we will all join it if we live long enough\u201d\n(Garland-Thomson 2002: 20). Indeed, the concern for vulnerability in\nthe approach extends to non-human animals, as some critical disability\ntheorists engage critical animal studies (Taylor 2017). This makes\ncritical disability theory, insofar as it reveals crucial aspects of\nembodiment, an essential ingredient of any political and social\nanalysis.\n\nYet some theorists prefer to engage questions of power directly,\nrather than vulnerable embodiment. Some theorists argue that\ndisability, and its\n\u201cprecursors\u201d\u2014impairments\u2014are precisely the\nproducts of power relations (Tremain 2017: 86). For others, disability\nrefers to a body\u2019s incongruence within \u201cspace and in the\nmilieu of expectations\u201d (Garland-Thomson 2002: 20). While power\nand incongruence have material effects, including disabling effects on\nembodiment, these critical disability theorists will describe\ndisability in immediate reference to power, including its exclusions\nand hierarchies in discourses and institutions. This, however, again\npoints to the importance of critical disability theory. Attention\nto\u2014for example\u2014abnormality, hierarchies of capability, and\nother exclusionary constructions related to disability simultaneously\ndeepen and are deepened by analysis of racism and sexism. If\ndisability is a direct expression of power, as these theorists argue,\nthen power and its effect on human life cannot be understood without\ntreating disability politically and socially.\n\nAlliances among critical discourses, including queer theory and\nfeminist theory, are essential to the task of critical disability\ntheory, as no one theory or discipline alone can nor should attempt to\nhandle the complexity and scope of the phenomena of disability\n(Sleeter 2010). Broad coalitional possibilities are available to\ndisability theorists, although these possibilities traditionally go\nunrealized or remain nascent. These include \u201cacademic and\npolitical connections\u201d with other identity-based areas of study,\nincluding \u201crace/ethnic\u201d and \u201csexuality/queer\u201d\nstudies (Schalk 2013; cf. Goodley, Liddiard, & Cole 2018: 206).\nFor Sami Schalk, critical disability theory must take up these\npotential coalitions wherever possible to further its goals. These\ngoals, as already implied, are both political and conceptual. In an\nexample of coalitional analysis, Erevelles describes her work this\nway: \n\n\nI have argued that the ideology of disability has been used to justify\nthe racial and gendered division of labor based on heteronormative\nnotions of the family and, in doing so, organizes class relations in a\ncapitalist society. (Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 206) \n\n\nCritical analysis of the phenomena of heterosexism, sexism, and\nracism, therefore, must make reference to the insights of disability\ntheory in order to achieve their goals. As this entry will\ndemonstrate, critical disability theory and its nuanced approach to\nvulnerability and power is a key ingredient of critical theory more\ngenerally.\n\nThis entry intends to describe the contours of critical disability\ntheory, including historical antecedents and key debates. It examines\nkey approaches in critical disability theory and what these approaches\noffer for the study of disability. It also considers what critical\ndisability theory offers to the analysis of other socio-political\nphenomena and philosophical problems. Further, this entry describes\nhow critical disability theorists leverage normativity and politics.\nThis entry takes into account the considerable overlap between\ncritical disability theory and feminist theory, both within and\noutside the traditional confines of the field of philosophy. It does\nnot, however, explicitly explore feminist approaches to disability\n(e.g., K. Hall 2011; Kittay & Feder 2002; Mackenzie, Rogers, &\nDodds 2014; and Wendell 1996; see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability).\n Additionally, although critical disability theory engages legal\nissues, work using this approach done in the field of law is not\nexplored here (e.g., Basas 2008, 2013a, 2013b; Belt 2015, 2017; Brown\n2014; and Nelson 2016; see the entry\n disability and justice).\n This entry, however, does cover Continental philosophical approaches\nto questions of disability, as these intimately intertwine with and\nprovide examples of critical disability theory. One final note:\nterminology varies significantly in literature on disability, and so\nthis entry uses the language of the thinkers whose work it\ndescribes. This method generates inconsistencies within the entry\nitself, but any resulting tensions are more fruitful than imposing an\narbitrary set of terms that thinkers themselves would not\nrecognize.\n\nThis entry has five primary sections. First, by way of background, the\nentry articulates and explores critical disability theory\u2019s\norigin in and continued resonance with critical theory. Then, it\nintroduces tensions within disability studies, including the use of\nthe new language of \u201ccritical disability theory\u201d to mark\noff critical approaches against traditional \u201cdisability\nstudies\u201d. Second, the entry considers key interdisciplinary\napproaches in critical disability theory, including crip theory, work\nat the intersections of disability and race, including dis/ability\ncritical race theory, indigenous approaches, and postcolonial\napproaches. Third, the entry covers philosophical approaches employing\nContinental philosophy, with special attention paid to the influence\nof Foucault. In the fourth section, the entry discusses political\nengagement, including challenges posed to psychology in the critical\ndisability theory milieu and activism around critical disability\ntheory. Finally, the entry offers concluding thoughts regarding the\nfuture of critical disability theory.\n",
