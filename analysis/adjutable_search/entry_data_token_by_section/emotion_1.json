Three Traditions in the Study of Emotions: Emotions as Feelings, Evaluations, and Motivations\n\n\u201cEmotion\u201d is a term that came into use in the English\nlanguage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a translation\nof the French term \u201c\u00e9motion\u201d but did not\ndesignate \u201ca category of mental states that might be\nsystematically studied\u201d until the mid-nineteenth century (Dixon\n2012: 338; see also Dixon 2003; Solomon 2008). At the same time, many\nof the things we call emotions today have been the object of\ntheoretical analysis since Ancient Greece, under a variety of\nlanguage-specific labels such as passion, sentiment,\naffection, affect, disturbance, movement, perturbation, upheaval,\nor appetite. This makes for a long and complicated history,\nwhich has progressively led to the development of a variety of shared\ninsights about the nature and function of emotions, but no consensual\ndefinition of what emotions are, either in philosophy or in affective\nscience. \n\nA widely shared insight is that emotions have components, and that\nsuch components are jointly instantiated in prototypical episodes of\nemotions. Consider an episode of intense fear due to the sudden\nappearance of a grizzly bear on your path while hiking. At first\nblush, we can distinguish in the complex event that is fear an\nevaluative component (e.g., appraising the bear as\ndangerous), a physiological component (e.g., increased heart\nrate and blood pressure), a phenomenological component (e.g.,\nan unpleasant feeling), an expressive component (e.g., upper\neyelids raised, jaw dropped open, lips stretched horizontally), a\nbehavioral component (e.g., a tendency to flee), and a\nmental component (e.g., focusing attention).\n\nOne question that has divided emotion theorists is: Which subset of\nthe evaluative, physiological, phenomenological, expressive,\nbehavioral, and mental components is essential to emotion?\nThe answer to this \u201cproblem of parts\u201d (Prinz 2004) has\nchanged at various times in the history of the subject, leading to a\nvast collection of theories of emotions both in philosophy and in\naffective science. Although such theories differ on multiple\ndimensions, they can be usefully sorted into three broad traditions,\nwhich we call the Feeling Tradition, the Evaluative\nTradition and the Motivational Tradition (Scarantino\n2016).\n\nThe Feeling Tradition takes the way emotions feel to be their most\nessential characteristic, and defines emotions as distinctive\nconscious experiences. The Evaluative Tradition regards the way\nemotions construe the world as primary, and defines emotions as being\n(or involving) distinctive evaluations of the eliciting circumstances.\nThe Motivational Tradition defines emotions as distinctive\nmotivational states.\n\nEach tradition faces the task of articulating a prescriptive\ndefinition of emotions that is theoretically fruitful and compatible\nat least to some degree with ordinary linguistic usage. And although\nthere are discipline-specific theoretical objectives, there also is a\ncore set of explanatory challenges that tends to be shared across\ndisciplines:\n\n Differentiation: How are emotions different from one\nanother, and from things that are not emotions?\n Motivation: Do emotions motivate behavior, and if so\nhow?\n Intentionality: Do emotions have object-directedness, and\nif so can they be appropriate or inappropriate to their objects?\n Phenomenology: Do emotions always involve subjective\nexperiences, and if so of what kind?\n\n\nFor example, a viable account of anger should tell us how anger\ndiffers from fear and from non-emotional states (differentiation),\nwhether and how anger motivates aggressive behaviors (motivation),\nwhether and how anger can be about a given state of affairs and be\nconsidered appropriate with respect to such state of affairs\n(intentionality), and whether and how anger involves a distinctive\nsubjective experience (phenomenology).\n\nWe now consider some of the most prominent theories within each\ntradition, and assess how they fare with respect to these four theoretical challenges and\nothers. As we shall see, each tradition seems to capture something\nimportant about what the emotions are, but none is immune from\ncounterexamples and problem cases. As a result, the most recent trend\nin emotion theory is represented by theories that straddle traditions,\nin an attempt to combine their distinctive insights. Although we begin\nour investigation with William James and will occasionally mention\nearlier accounts, our primary focus will be on theories developed in\nthe last 50 years.\n",
