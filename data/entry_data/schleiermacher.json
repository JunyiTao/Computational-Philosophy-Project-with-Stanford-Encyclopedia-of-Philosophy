    "preamble": "\n\nFriedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834) perhaps cannot\nbe counted as one of the very greatest German philosophers of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries (like Kant, Herder, Hegel, Marx,\nor Nietzsche). But he is certainly one of the best second-tier\nphilosophers of the period (a period in which even the second-tier was\nstill extremely good). He was not only a philosopher, but also an\neminent classical scholar and theologian. Much of his philosophical\nwork was in the philosophy of religion, but from a modern\nphilosophical point of view it is his hermeneutics (i.e., theory of\ninterpretation) and his theory of translation that deserve the most\nattention. This article will attempt to provide a fairly broad\noverview of his philosophical thought. One thing that will emerge from\nthis is that while he has important philosophical debts to many\npredecessors and contemporaries (including Spinoza, Kant, and\nFriedrich Schlegel), he was above all following in the philosophical\nfootsteps of one predecessor in particular: Herder.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nFriedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834) was born in\nBreslau as the son of a clergyman of the reformed church. His earlier\neducation took place in institutions of the Moravian Brethren\n(Herrnhuter), a strict pietist sect. However, while there he also\npursued broader humanistic interests. Largely as a result of\nskepticism about certain Christian doctrines taught there, he moved to\nthe more liberal University of Halle in 1787. However, he continued in\ntheology (with philosophy and classical philology as minor fields). He\npassed his theological examinations in Berlin in 1790. This was\nfollowed by a period as a private tutor, which ended in 1793, partly,\nit seems, due to friction caused by his sympathy with the French\nRevolution, to which his employer was opposed.\n\nDuring the periods just mentioned he was heavily occupied with the\nstudy and criticism of Kant\u2019s philosophy. This work culminated\nin several unpublished essays\u2014On the Highest Good\n(1789), On What Gives Value to Life (1792\u20133), and\nOn Freedom (1790\u20133)\u2014which rejected Kant\u2019s\nconception that the \u201chighest good [summum bonum]\u201d\nrequires an apportioning of happiness to moral desert, and\nKant\u2019s connected doctrine of the \u201cpostulates\u201d of an\nafterlife of the soul and God, while also developing an anti-Kantian\ntheory of the thoroughgoing causal determination of human action and\nof the compatibility of this with moral responsibility. In\n1793\u20134 he wrote two essays about Spinoza: Spinozism and\nBrief Presentation of the Spinozistic System. A major\ncatalyst for these essays was Jacobi\u2019s work On the Doctrine\nof Spinoza, in Letters to Mr. Moses Mendelssohn (1785), which had\nbeen highly critical of Spinozism. But they also show the influence of\nHerder\u2019s work God: Some Conversations (1787), which\nchampioned a modified form of Spinozism. In his two essays\nSchleiermacher himself embraces a modified form of Spinoza\u2019s\nmonism similar in character to Herder\u2019s (in particular, like\nHerder, he is inclined to substitute for Spinoza\u2019s single\nsubstance the more active principle of a single fundamental\nforce). He also attempts to defend this position by showing\nit to be reconcilable with central features of Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy (notably, Kant\u2019s doctrine of things in\nthemselves). This neo-Spinozistic position (developed before\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s in Judgment and Being or\nNovalis\u2019 in Fichte-Studies, it should be noted) would\nsubsequently be fundamental to Schleiermacher\u2019s most important\nwork in the philosophy of religion, On Religion: Speeches to Its\nCultured Despisers (1799). However, in thus rejecting\nJacobi\u2019s anti-Spinozism, Schleiermacher seems also to have\nabsorbed something from Jacobi that would be equally important for his\nfuture philosophy of religion: the idea (for which his pietist\nbackground no doubt made him receptive) that we enjoy a sort of\nimmediate intuition or feeling of God.\n\nDuring the period 1794\u20136 Schleiermacher served as a pastor in\nLandsberg. In 1796 he moved to Berlin, where he became chaplain to a\nhospital. In Berlin he met Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel, as\nwell as other romantics, became deeply engaged in the formation of the\nromantic movement, and collaborated with the Schlegel brothers on the\nshort-lived but important literary journal Athenaeum\n(1798\u20131800). Among Schleiermacher\u2019s contributions to this\njournal was the short feminist piece Idea for a Catechism of\nReason for Noble Ladies (1798). During the period 1797\u20139,\nhe shared a house with Friedrich Schlegel. Encouraged by the romantic\ncircle to write a statement of his religious views, in 1799 he\npublished his most important and radical work in the philosophy of\nreligion, On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers\n(revised editions followed in 1806, 1821, the latter including\nsignificant \u201cexplanations\u201d, and 1831). This work sought to\nsave religion in the eyes of its cultured despisers (prominent among\nthem some of the romantics, including Friedrich Schlegel) by,\ninter alia, arguing that human immortality and even God are\ninessential to religion; diagnosing and excusing current\nreligion\u2019s more off-putting features in terms of its corruption\nby worldly bourgeois culture and state-interference; and arguing that\nthere are an endless multiplicity of valid forms of religion. The book\nwon Schleiermacher a national reputation. In the same year (1799) he\nalso published an essay on the situation of the Jews in Prussia,\nLetters on the Occasion of the Political-Theological Task and the\nOpen Letter of Jewish Householders. In this work he rejected an\nexpedient that had been proposed for ameliorating the condition of the\nJews in Prussia of effecting their civil assimilation through baptism\n(which would, he argues, harm both Judaism and Christianity) and\ninstead advocated full civil rights for Jews (on certain reasonable\nconditions). The same year also saw Schleiermacher\u2019s composition\nof the interesting short essay Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct, which is important as his first significant discussion\nof the art of conversation (an art that would later be central to his\ndiscipline of dialectics). Finally, 1799 also saw his publication of a\nvery critical review of Kant\u2019s Anthropology. The review\nin particular implies criticism of Kant for his dualistic philosophy\nof mind and his superficial, disparaging attitude toward women and\nother peoples.\n\nDuring the following several years Schleiermacher complemented On\nReligion with two substantial publications that were more ethical\nin orientation: the especially important Soliloquies (1800;\nsecond edition 1810) and the Outlines of a Critique of Previous\nEthical Theory (1803). In 1800 he also defended his friend\nFriedrich Schlegel\u2019s controversial and arguably pornographic\nnovel Lucinde from the same year in his Confidential\nLetters Concerning Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s Lucinde\u2014a\nshared feminism constituting a large part of his reason for\nsympathizing with Schlegel\u2019s book. During the period\n1799\u20131804 Schleiermacher developed with Schlegel the project of\ntranslating Plato\u2019s dialogues. As time went on, however,\nSchlegel left this work to Schleiermacher, which contributed to\nincreasingly difficult relations between the two men after 1800.\nSchleiermacher\u2019s translations appeared during the period\n1804\u201328 (though not quite all of the dialogues were translated\nin the end), and are still widely used and admired today.\n\nWhile in Berlin Schleiermacher developed romantic attachments to two\nmarried women, Henriette Herz and Eleonore Grunow\u2014the latter of\nwhich attachments led to scandal and unhappiness, eventually causing\nSchleiermacher to leave the city. He spent the years 1802\u20134 in\nStolpe. By 1804 he was teaching at Halle University. During the period\n1804\u20135 he began lecturing on ethics (as he would do again\nrepeatedly until 1832). In 1805 he also began delivering his famous\nand important lectures on hermeneutics (which he repeated regularly\nuntil 1833). In 1806 he began lecturing on the history of philosophy,\nin particular, ancient philosophy (adding lectures on modern\nphilosophy in 1810, and then continuing to lecture on the history of\nphilosophy repeatedly in subsequent years). In 1806 he also published\nthe short book Christmas Eve, a literary work that explores\nthe meaning of Christian love by depicting a German family\u2019s\ncelebration of Christmas Eve. This is in keeping with On\nReligion\u2019s ideal that (Christian) religion should be\nfamily- rather than state-centered. In 1806\u20137 he left Halle as a\nresult of the French occupation, and moved back to Berlin. From this\ntime on he began actively promoting German resistance to the French\noccupation and the cause of German unity. In 1808 he published\nOccasional Thoughts on Universities in a German Spirit, together\nwith an Appendix on One about to be Founded, a work written in\nconnection with plans for founding a new university in Berlin (now\nknown as the Humboldt University), a project to which Wilhelm von\nHumboldt likewise contributed theoretically soon afterwards as well as\nplaying the leading role in its practical implementation. In 1808\nSchleiermacher married a young widow, Henriette von Willich, with whom\nhe had several children. In 1808\u20139 he became preacher at the\nDreifaltigkeitskirche, in 1810 professor of theology at the University\nof Berlin, and by 1811 also a member of the Berlin Academy of\nSciences.\n\nAfter becoming a member of the Academy he often delivered addresses\nbefore it. Among these several on ethics, one on translation from\n1813, one on the philosophy of Socrates from 1815, and one on\nLeibniz\u2019s idea of a universal language from 1831 are especially\nsignificant.\n\nIn 1811 he lectured on dialectics for the first time (as he would do\nagain regularly until his death, at which time he was in the early\nstages of preparing a version for publication). In 1813 he delivered\nas an address, and then published as an essay, On the Different\nMethods of Translation\u2014an extremely important work in\ntranslation theory deeply informed by his own experience as a\ntranslator. In 1813\u201314 he lectured on pedagogy, or the\nphilosophy of education, for the first time (as he would do on two\nsubsequent occasions: 1820\u20131 and 1826). In 1818 he lectured on\npsychology for the first time (as he would again repeatedly until\n1833\u20134). In 1819 he lectured on aesthetics for the first time\n(as he subsequently did on two further occasions, the last of them in\n1832\u20133). In the same year he also began lecturing on the life of\nJesus (as he did again on four further occasions over the following\ntwelve years)\u2014thereby inaugurating an important genre of\nliterature on this subject in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1821\u20132 he published his major work of systematic theology,\nThe Christian Faith (revised edition 1830\u20131). In 1829\nhe published two open letters on this work (nominally addressed to his\nfriend L\u00fccke), in which he discusses it and central issues in the\nphilosophy of religion and theology relating to it in a concise and\nlucid way.\n\nSchleiermacher died in 1834. As can be seen even from this brief\nsketch of his life and works, a large proportion of his career was\ntaken up with the philosophy of religion and theology. However, from\nthe secular standpoint of modern philosophy it is probably his work in\nsuch areas as hermeneutics (i.e., the theory of interpretation) and\nthe theory of translation that is most important. Accordingly, this\narticle will begin with these more interesting areas of his thought,\nonly turning to his philosophy of religion briefly at the end.\n2. Philosophy of Language\n\nSince the topics of language and human psychology are central to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics and theory of translation, it is\nappropriate to begin with some discussion of his philosophies of\nlanguage and mind. Schleiermacher nowhere presents his philosophy of\nlanguage separately; instead, it is found scattered through such works\nas his lectures on psychology, dialectics, and hermeneutics. The\nfollowing eight positions\u2014all but the last of which are heavily\nindebted to Herder\u2014are especially worth noting:\n\nIn his lectures on psychology, Schleiermacher takes the\nfollowing position on the question of the origin of language\n(virtually identical to Herder\u2019s position in the Treatise on\nthe Origin of Language [1772]): The origin of language is not to\nbe explained in terms of a divine source. Nor is it to be explained in\nterms of the primitive expression of feelings. Rather, the use of\ninner language is simply fundamental to human nature. It is the\nfoundation of, and indeed identical with, thought. It is also the\nfoundation of other distinctively human mental characteristics, in\nparticular self-consciousness and a clear distinguishing of perception\nfrom feeling and desire.\nLanguage (and hence thought) is fundamentally social in\nnature. More precisely, while inner language is not dependent on a\nsocial stimulus (so that even in the absence of this children would\ndevelop their own languages), it does already involve a tendency or an\nimplicit directedness toward social communication.\nLanguage and thought are not merely additions over and\nabove other mental processes that human beings share with the animals.\nRather, they are infused throughout, and lend a distinctive character\nto, all human mental processes. In particular, they structure human\nbeings\u2019 sensory images in distinctive ways.\n\n\nThe next five of the eight positions are especially important for\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics and theory of translation (to be\ndiscussed below):\n\nSchleiermacher already in early work postulated an\nidentity of thought with linguistic expression. He often equates\nthought more specifically with inner language (e.g., he\nalready does so in his 1812\u201313 lectures on ethics). His main\nmotive behind this refinement can be seen from the lectures on\npsychology, where he discusses cases in which thought occurs without\narriving at any outward linguistic expression. It has been claimed by\nsome of the secondary literature that he eventually gave up this whole\nposition (e.g., by Heinz Kimmerle). He does seem to retreat from it\nsomewhat, but in his psychology lectures of 1830 we still find him\nwriting of \u201cthe activity of thought in its identity with\nlanguage\u201d (SW 3/6: 263).\nSchleiermacher adopts a view of meaning that equates\nit\u2014not with such items, in principle independent of language, as\nthe referents involved (Augustine), Platonic forms, or the subjective\nmental \u201cideas\u201d favored by the British Empiricists and\nothers, but instead\u2014with word-usage, or rules for the use of\nwords. For example, in the hermeneutics lectures he says that\n\u201cthe \u2026 meaning of a term is to be derived from the unity\nof the word-sphere and from the rules governing the presupposition of\nthis unity\u201d (HHM 50).\nIn his psychology lectures, Schleiermacher argues that\nalthough thought and conceptualization are not reducible to\nsensuous images (since that would conflict with the position that the\nformer require, or are indeed identical with, language), the latter\nare an essential foundation for the former. This position is\nalso reflected in his strong attraction, in some of his later\nhermeneutics and dialectics lectures, to Kant\u2019s theory of\nempirical schemata\u2014according to which empirical concepts are\ngrounded, or consist, in unconscious rules for the generation of\nsensuous images\u2014and to turning this into an account of the\nnature of all concepts. (This prompts the question whether there do\nnot also exist strictly a priori concepts, as Kant had held. In his\npsychology lectures Schleiermacher vacillates in his answer to this\nquestion: sometimes implying yes, but at other points instead\nimplying\u2014more consistently with the position just\ndescribed\u2014that it is merely the case that some concepts are\nmore distantly abstracted from sensory images than others.\nThe latter is his normal answer in the dialectics lectures as\nwell.)\nHuman beings exhibit, not only significant linguistic\nand conceptual-intellectual similarities, but also striking linguistic\nand conceptual-intellectual differences, especially between different\nhistorical periods and cultures, but even to some extent between\nindividuals within a single period and culture. (In this connection,\nSchleiermacher argues, plausibly, that the phenomenon of the\nlinguistic and conceptual-intellectual development of cultures over\ntime can only be explained in terms of linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual innovations performed by individuals, which\nthen get taken over by the broader culture, becoming part of its\ncommon stock.)\nImportantly, Schleiermacher develops a much more\nholistic conception of meaning than his predecessors had held\n(this is the one major respect in which his philosophy of language\ngoes beyond Herder\u2019s). At least three aspects of his semantic\nholism can be distinguished: (a) As can already be seen from a passage\nquoted earlier, he espouses a doctrine of \u201cthe unity of the\nword-sphere\u201d. This doctrine in effect says that the various\nspecific senses that a single word typically bears, and which will\nnormally be distinguished by any good dictionary entry (e.g., the\ndifferent senses of \u201cimpression\u201d in \u201cHe made an\nimpression in the clay\u201d, \u201cMy impression is that he is\nreluctant\u201d, and \u201cHe made a big impression at the\nparty\u201d), always in fact form a larger semantic unity to which\nthey each essentially belong (so that any loss, addition, or\nalteration among them entails an alteration in each of them, albeit\nperhaps a subtle one). (b) He holds that the nature of any particular\nconcept is partly defined by its relations to a \u201csystem of\nconcepts\u201d. In this connection, the dialectics lectures emphasize\na concept\u2019s relations as a species-concept to superordinate\ngenus-concepts, relations as a genus-concept to subordinate\nspecies-concepts, and relations of contrast to coordinate concepts\nfalling under the same genus-concepts. However, other types of\nconceptual relationships would no doubt be included here as well\n(e.g., those between \u201cto work\u201d, \u201cworker\u201d, and\n\u201ca work\u201d or those between physis and\nnomos). (c) He holds that the distinctive nature of a\nlanguage\u2019s grammatical system (e.g., its system of\ndeclensions) is also partly constitutive of the character of the\nconcepts expressed within it. (This last position was also developed\nat around the same period by Friedrich Schlegel, for whom it\nconstituted one of the main rationales for a new discipline of\n\u201ccomparative grammar\u201d that he introduced in his On the\nLanguage and Wisdom of the Indians [1808]. Shortly afterwards, it\nwas taken over and used to similar effect by another of the founders\nof modern linguistics, Wilhelm von Humboldt.) Among these aspects, (b)\nis especially noteworthy as a distinctive contribution of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s; it had been overlooked not only by Herder but\nalso by Friedrich Schlegel, and it constitutes the origin of the\ntwentieth-century theory of the \u201csemantic field\u201d.\n\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, with the sole exception of this final\nfeature (semantic holism), Schleiermacher\u2019s entire philosophy of\nlanguage is heavily indebted to Herder. However, while it refines\nHerder\u2019s philosophy of language with this final feature, it also\nweakens it in other respects. For example, whereas Herder\u2019s\nversion of doctrine\n (4)\n normally restricted itself to a claim that thought is essentially\ndependent on and bounded by language, Schleiermacher\u2019s version\nasserts the outright identity of thought with language, or\nwith inner language. But even in the latter, more cautious version,\nsuch a strong form of the doctrine is philosophically\nproblematic\u2014vulnerable to counterexamples in which thought\noccurs without any corresponding (inner) language use, and vice versa.\nAgain, as we noted, in later works Schleiermacher tends to add to the\nHerderian doctrine\n (5)\n a thesis that concepts are empirical schemata \u00e0 la Kant (see\n (6)).\n This is likely to seem problematic to modern readers because of its\ninclusion of sensory images in meaning. But that is arguably not so:\nHerder had already included them in a way as well; contrary to first\nappearances, doing so need not conflict with a suitably interpreted\ndoctrine that meanings are word-usages; and the currently popular\nrejection of such \u201cpsychologism\u201d in modern philosophy of\nlanguage influenced by Frege and Wittgenstein, which is likely to make\nsuch a position seem suspect, may well itself be misguided. What\nis problematic about Schleiermacher\u2019s thesis is rather\nthat Kant\u2019s theory of empirical schemata had implied that there\nis a sharp distinction between meanings, which he conceived as\nsomething purely psychological, and word-usages, so that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s unmodified reintroduction of the theory implies\nthe same, and hence conflicts with doctrine\n (5),\n the doctrine that meaning is word-usage. Finally, whereas for Herder\ndoctrine\n (7)\n was merely an empirically established rule of thumb and admitted of\nexceptions, Schleiermacher in his lectures on ethics and dialectics\nattempts to give a sort of a priori proof of linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual diversity even at the level of individuals as\na universal fact\u2014a proof that is dubious in its very a\npriori status, in its specific details, and in its extremely\ncounterintuitive implication (often explicitly asserted by\nSchleiermacher) that, strictly speaking, no one can ever understand\nanother person.\n3. Philosophy of Mind\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of mind is found mainly in his\nlectures on psychology. It is too extensive to present in detail here.\nBut the following four central principles\u2014all of which have\ntheir roots in Herder, and especially in Herder\u2019s main work on\nthe philosophy of mind, On the Cognition and Sensation of the\nHuman Soul (1778)\u2014are especially striking and\nimportant:\n\nSchleiermacher argues for a strong dependence of the soul (or\nmind) on the body, and indeed for their identity. However, he resists\nreductionism in either direction, arguing that both what he calls\n\u201cspiritualism\u201d (i.e., the reduction of the body to the\nmind) and \u201cmaterialism\u201d (i.e., the reduction of the mind\nto the body) are errors. He refers to the sort of non-reductive unity\nof mind and body that he instead champions as \u201clife\u201d.\nSchleiermacher also identifies the soul (or mind) with\n\u201cforce\u201d. Thus already in On Freedom\n(1790\u20133) he writes that the soul is \u201ca force or a\ncomposite of forces\u201d.\nSchleiermacher also argues strongly for the unity of the soul (or\nmind) within itself: the soul is not composed of separate faculties\n(e.g., sensation, understanding, imagination, reason, desire). He\nhimself often works with a twofold distinction between what he calls\nthe mind\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d (i.e., sensory) and\n\u201cintellectual\u201d functions, but he holds these too to be at\nbottom identical.\nSchleiermacher argues that human minds, while they certainly share\nsimilarities, are also deeply different from each other\u2014not only\nacross social groups such as peoples and genders, but also at the\nlevel of individuals who belong to the same groups. He holds that the\ndeep distinctiveness of individual minds sometimes exercises an\nimportant influence on the development of society at large\u2014both\nin the political-ethical sphere (where he calls the individuals who\nplay such a role \u201cheroes\u201d) and in the sphere of thought\nand art (where he calls them \u201cgeniuses\u201d). He argues that\nthe distinctiveness of individual minds cannot be explained by any\nprocess of calculation (in particular, that it is a mistake to suppose\nthat all human minds begin the same and only come to differ due to the\nimpact of different causal influences on their development, which\nmight in principle be calculated). It can, however, be understood by\nmeans of \u201cdivination\u201d (concerning which more anon).\n\n\nFinally, one feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of mind that\ndistinguishes it from Herder\u2019s, and from other German\npredecessors\u2019, is also worth noting: Schleiermacher says\nrelatively little about unconscious mental processes, and\nwhen he does mention them often seems skeptical about them. For\nexample, he argues that thought cannot be unconscious, and that\nso-called \u201cobscure representations\u201d are in fact merely\nsensuous images that do not involve thoughts.\n4. Hermeneutics (i.e., Theory of Interpretation)\n\nSome of Schleiermacher\u2019s most important philosophical work\nconcerns the theories of interpretation (\u201chermeneutics\u201d)\nand translation. Friedrich Schlegel was an immediate influence on his\nthought here. Their ideas on these subjects began to take shape in the\nlate 1790s, when they lived together in the same house in Berlin for a\ntime. Many of their ideas are shared, and it is often unclear which of\nthe two men was the (more) original source of a given idea. But since\nSchlegel\u2019s surviving treatments of these subjects are much less\ndetailed and systematic than Schleiermacher\u2019s, the latter\ninevitably take on prime importance.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theories of interpretation and translation rest\nsquarely on three of the Herder-inspired doctrines in the philosophy\nof language that were described above:\n (4)\n thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by, or even identical\nwith, language;\n (5)\n meaning is word-usage; and\n (7)\n there are deep linguistic and conceptual-intellectual differences\nbetween people. Doctrine\n (7)\n poses a severe challenge to both interpretation and translation, and\nit is the main task of Schleiermacher\u2019s theories to cope with\njust this challenge. Schleiermacher\u2019s most original doctrine in\nthe philosophy of language, doctrine\n (8)\n (semantic holism), is also highly relevant in this connection, for,\nas Schleiermacher recognizes, semantic holism greatly exacerbates the\nchallenge to interpretation and translation that is posed by\n (7).\n\nSchleiermacher lectured on hermeneutics frequently between 1805 and\n1833. The following are his main principles:\n\n(a) Hermeneutics is strictly the theory of understanding\nlinguistic communication\u2014as contrasted, not equated, with\nexplicating, applying, or translating it.\n\n(b) Hermeneutics should be a universal discipline\u2014i.e.,\none that applies equally to all subjects areas (such as the Bible,\nlaw, and literature), to oral as well as to written language, to\nmodern texts as well as to ancient ones, to works in one\u2019s own\nlanguage as well as to works in foreign languages, and so forth.\n\n(c) In particular, the interpretation of sacred texts such as the\nBible is included within it. This may not rely on special\nprinciples, such as divine inspiration (either of the author or of the\ninterpreter).\n\n(d) Interpretation is a much more difficult task than is generally\nrealized: contrary to a common misconception that \u201cunderstanding\noccurs as a matter of course\u201d, in fact \u201cmisunderstanding\noccurs as a matter of course, and so understanding must be willed and\nsought at every point\u201d (HHM 109\u2013110;\nHC 21\u201322). (This position derives from\nSchleiermacher\u2019s version of principle\n (7):\n deep linguistic and conceptual-intellectual diversity.)\n\nHow, then, is interpretation to be accomplished?\n\n(e) It is essential to distinguish clearly between the question of the\nmeaning of a text or discourse and the question of its\ntruth. If an interpreter assumes that a text or discourse\nmust be true, this will often lead to serious misinterpretation.\n\n(f) Before the interpretation proper of a text or discourse can even\nbegin, the interpreter must acquire a good knowledge of its historical\ncontext. (The suggestion found in some of the secondary literature\nthat Schleiermacher thinks that historical context is\nirrelevant to interpretation is absurd.)\n\n(g) Interpretation proper always has two sides: one linguistic, the\nother psychological. Linguistic interpretation\u2019s task (which\nrests on principle\n (5))\n lies in inferring from evidence that consists in particular actual\nuses of words to the rules that are governing them, i.e., to their\nusages, and thus to their meanings; psychological interpretation\ninstead focuses on an author\u2019s psychology. Linguistic\ninterpretation is mainly concerned with what is common or shared in a\nlanguage; psychological interpretation mainly with what is distinctive\nto a particular author.\n\n(h) Schleiermacher implies several reasons why an interpreter needs to\ncomplement linguistic interpretation with psychological in this way.\nFirst, he sees such a need as arising from the deep linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual distinctiveness of individuals. This\ndistinctiveness at the level of individuals leads to the problem for\nlinguistic interpretation that the actual uses of words that are\navailable to serve as evidence from which to infer an author\u2019s\nexact usage or meaning will usually be relatively few in number and\npoor in contextual variety\u2014a problem which an appeal to\nauthorial psychology can help solve by providing additional clues.\nSecond, an appeal to the author\u2019s psychology is also required in\norder to resolve ambiguities at the level of linguistic meaning that\narise in particular contexts (i.e., even after the range of meanings\navailable to the author for the word(s) in question is known). Third,\nin order fully to understand a linguistic act one needs to know not\nonly its linguistic meaning but also what more recent philosophers\nhave called its \u201cillocutionary force\u201d or intention. For\nexample, if I encounter a stranger by a frozen lake who says to me,\n\u201cThe ice is thin over there\u201d, in order fully to understand\nhis utterance I need to know not only its linguistic meaning (which in\nthis case is clear) but also whether the utterance is being made as a\nfactual observation, a threat, a joke, or whatnot. (Schleiermacher\nhimself places most emphasis on the first of these three\nconsiderations. However, if, as he does, one wants to argue that\ninterpretation needs to invoke psychology generally, and if,\nas I hinted earlier, linguistic and conceptual-intellectual\ndistinctiveness is not in fact the pervasive phenomenon that\nSchleiermacher usually takes it to be, then it is arguably the latter\ntwo considerations that should be considered the more fundamental\nones.)\n\n(i) Interpretation also requires two different methods: a\n\u201ccomparative\u201d method (i.e., a method of plain induction),\nwhich Schleiermacher sees as predominating on the linguistic side of\ninterpretation, where it takes the interpreter from the particular\nuses of a word to the rule for use that governs them all; and a\n\u201cdivinatory\u201d method (i.e., a method of tentative, fallible\nhypothesis based on but also going well beyond the empirical evidence\navailable; the etymology to keep in mind here is not so much Latin\ndivinus, which would point toward prophecy, but rather French\ndeviner, to guess or conjecture), which he sees as\npredominating on the psychological side of interpretation. (The\nwidespread conception in the secondary literature that\n\u201cdivination\u201d is for Schleiermacher a process of\npsychological self-projection into texts contains a grain of truth, in\nthat he does think that interpretation requires some measure\nof psychological common ground between interpreter and interpretee,\nbut is nonetheless basically mistaken.)\n\n(j) Ideal interpretation is of its nature a holistic activity (this\nprinciple in part rests on, but also goes well beyond,\nSchleiermacher\u2019s semantic holism). In particular, any\ngiven piece of text needs to be interpreted in light of the whole text\nto which it belongs, and both need to be interpreted in light of the\nbroader language in which they are written, their larger historical\ncontext, a broader pre-existing genre, the author\u2019s whole\ncorpus, and the author\u2019s overall psychology. Such holism\nintroduces a pervasive circularity into interpretation, for,\nultimately, interpreting these broader items in its turn depends on\ninterpreting such pieces of text. Schleiermacher does not see this\ncircle as vicious, however. Why not? His solution is not that all of\nthese tasks should be accomplished simultaneously\u2014for that would\nfar exceed human capacities. Rather, it essentially lies in the (very\nplausible) thought that understanding is not an all-or-nothing matter\nbut instead something that comes in degrees, so that it is\npossible to make progress toward full understanding in a piecemeal\nway. For example, concerning the relation between a piece of text and\nthe whole text to which it belongs, Schleiermacher recommends that we\nfirst read through and interpret as best we can each of the parts of\nthe text in turn in order thereby to arrive at an approximate overall\ninterpretation of the text, and that we then apply this approximate\noverall interpretation in order to refine our initial interpretations\nof each of the particular parts, which in turn gives us an improved\noverall interpretation, which can then be re-applied toward still\nfurther refinement of the interpretations of the parts, and so on\nindefinitely.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s debts to Herder in this theory of\ninterpretation extend well beyond the framework-principles\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7)\n mentioned earlier. Indeed, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory as it has\njust been described is almost identical to Herder\u2019s. Some of the\ncommon ground here is admittedly due to the fact that they were both\ninfluenced by the same predecessors, especially J.A. Ernesti. But\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory owes the two central moves (often\nwrongly thought to have been original with Schleiermacher) of\nsupplementing \u201clinguistic\u201d with\n\u201cpsychological\u201d interpretation and of identifying\n\u201cdivination\u201d as the predominant method of the latter\nexclusively to Herder. (Herder had already made these two moves,\nespecially in On Thomas Abbt\u2019s Writings [1768] and\nOn the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul [1778].)\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory as it has just been described in essence\nmerely draws together and systematizes ideas that already lay\nscattered through a number of Herder\u2019s works.\n\nThere are some significant exceptions to this rule of continuity,\nhowever\u2014respects in which Schleiermacher\u2019s theory deviates\nfrom Herder\u2019s. But it is precisely here that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory tends to become philosophically\nproblematic. To begin with two deviations that are not\nproblematic, but instead advantageous: First, as was previously\nmentioned, Schleiermacher exacerbates the challenge to interpretation\nthat principle\n (7)\n already poses by introducing principle\n (8),\n semantic holism. Second, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory explicitly\nintroduces principle (b), the ideal of the universality of\nhermeneutics. This principle is very much in the spirit of\nHerder\u2019s theory, but does go beyond its letter. (There were,\nhowever, some clearer precedents for it\u2014for example, in van der\nHardt, Chladenius, Pfeiffer, Grosch, and Meier.) Turning now to\ndeviations that are problematic, we have already noted\nseveral examples of such problematic deviations concerning the exact\nforce of the three principles in the philosophy of language that\nunderpin Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of interpretation, principles\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7).\n But the following are some further examples. Whereas Herder rightly\nemphasizes the vital importance in interpretation of correctly\nidentifying a work\u2019s genre, and also the great difficulty of\ndoing so in many cases, especially due to the constant changes in\ngenres that take place and the consequent pervasive temptation falsely\nto assimilate unfamiliar genres to more familiar ones, Schleiermacher\npays relatively little attention to this subject. Again, unlike\nHerder, Schleiermacher, especially in his later work, more closely\nspecifies psychological interpretation as a process of identifying,\nand tracing the necessary development of, a single authorial\n\u201cseminal decision [Keimentschlu\u00df]\u201d that\nlies behind a work and unfolds itself as the work in a necessary\nfashion. However, this seems an unhelpful move, for how many works are\nactually composed, and hence properly interpretable, in such a way?\nAgain, whereas Herder includes not only an author\u2019s linguistic\nbehavior but also his non-linguistic behavior among the evidence that\nis relevant to psychological interpretation, Schleiermacher normally\ninsists on a restriction to the former. But this too seems misguided;\nfor example, the Marquis de Sade\u2019s recorded acts of\ncruelty seem no less potentially relevant to establishing the (as we\nnow put it) sadistic side of his psychological make-up, and hence to\ninterpreting his texts accurately, than his cruel statements. Again,\nunlike Herder, Schleiermacher regards the central role of\n\u201cdivination\u201d, or hypothesis, in interpretation as a ground\nfor sharply distinguishing interpretation from natural science, and\nhence for classifying it as an art rather than a science. However, he\nshould arguably instead have seen it as a ground for considering\ninterpretation and natural science similar. (His mistake here\nwas caused by a false assumption that natural science works by a\nmethod of plain induction\u2014i.e., roughly: this first a\nis F, this second a is F, this third\na is F, \u2026 therefore all as are\nF\u2014rather than by hypothesis.)\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory also tends to downplay, obscure, or miss\ncertain important points concerning interpretation that Friedrich\nSchlegel had already made. Schlegel\u2019s treatment of hermeneutic\nmatters\u2014in texts such as his Philosophy of Philology\n(1797) and the Athenaeum Fragments\n(1798\u20131800)\u2014largely resembles Schleiermacher\u2019s. But\nit also includes the following four points which are either less\nemphatic, obscured, or altogether missing in Schleiermacher: (i)\nSchlegel notes that texts (at least superior ones) often express\nunconscious meanings in addition to their conscious ones:\n\u201cEvery excellent work \u2026 aims at more than it knows\u201d\n(On Goethe\u2019s Meister [1798] [PJ\n2:177]). Schleiermacher sometimes seems to imply a similar view, most\nfamously in his doctrine that the interpreter should aim to understand\nan author better than he understood himself. However, given\nSchleiermacher\u2019s general skepticism about the unconscious, he\nprobably means little more by this than that the interpreter should\nachieve an explicit knowledge of linguistic rules that the author\nhimself only grasped implicitly. By contrast, Schlegel\u2019s version\nof such a position is more radical, envisaging indeed an\n\u201cinfinite depth\u201d of meaning that is largely unknown to the\nauthor himself. (ii) Schlegel emphasizes that a work sometimes\nexpresses important meanings, not explicitly in any of its parts, but\nrather through the way in which these are put together to form a\nwhole. This is a very important point. Schleiermacher perhaps in a\nway makes it as well, but if so, then only as incorporated into\nand obscured by his more dubious doctrine of the \u201cseminal\ndecision\u201d. (iii) Unlike Schleiermacher, Schlegel emphasizes that\nworks typically contain confusions that the interpreter needs not only\nto identify but also to explain:\n\n\nIt is not enough that one understand the actual sense of a confused\nwork better than the author understood it. One must also oneself be\nable to know, characterize, and even construe the\nconfusion even down to its very principles. (KFSA\n18:63)\n\n\nThis is another very important point. (iv) Schlegel recognizes that\nnot only linguistic texts and discourse have meanings that require\ninterpretation, but also non-linguistic art (instrumental music,\nsculpture, painting, architecture, and so on), and he therefore covers\nthis in his theory of interpretation as well. Schleiermacher fails to\ndo so, instead confining himself to linguistic texts and discourse.\nThis is a serious omission.\n\nDespite these significant shortcomings in the details of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics, it at least had the advantages\nover Herder\u2019s and Schlegel\u2019s versions of the discipline of\nbeing consolidated, systematic, and somewhat comprehensive.\nSchleiermacher\u2019s pupil August Boeckh, an eminent classical\nphilologist, subsequently developed a largely faithful and even more\nsystematic re-articulation of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics in\nlectures that he delivered during the period 1809\u20131866 and which\nwere eventually published posthumously as his Encyclopedia and\nMethodology of the Philological Sciences (1877). (Boeckh\u2019s\nonly major departure from Schleiermacher was his devotion of a new\npart of the discipline to genre, very much in the spirit of Herder and\nSchlegel.) Through the combined influence of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nand Boeckh\u2019s presentations of it, Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics achieved something very much like the status of the\nofficial hermeneutical methodology of nineteenth-century classical and\nbiblical scholarship.\n5. Historiography of Philosophy\n\nSchleiermacher applied his scrupulous hermeneutic method fruitfully to\nseveral areas of scholarship that centrally require interpretation.\nOne example of this is the series of lectures on the life of Jesus\nthat he delivered between 1819 and 1833. Another\u2014for\nphilosophers probably more significant\u2014example is his work as a\nhistoriographer of philosophy. For further discussion, see the\nsupplementary document\n Schleiermacher and the Historiography of Philosophy.\n6. Theory of Translation\n\nAs was already mentioned, Schleiermacher also develops his theory of\ntranslation on the foundation of the Herder-influenced principles in\nthe philosophy of language\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7),\n together with\n (8),\n his own semantic holism, which exacerbates the challenge to\ntranslation already posed by (7).\n\nSchleiermacher was himself a masterful translator, whose German\ntranslations of Plato are still widely used and admired today, about\ntwo hundred years after they were done. So his views on translation\ncarry a certain prima facie authority. He explains his theory\nof translation mainly in the brilliant essay On the Different\nMethods of Translation (1813). The following are some of his main\npoints:\n\n(a) Translation usually faces the problem of a conceptual gulf between\nthe source language and the target language (as the latter currently\nexists). (This is an application of principle\n (7).)\n\n(b) This situation makes translation an extremely difficult task,\nposing a major obstacle to the attainment of translation\u2019s\ntraditional primary goal, that of faithfully reproducing the original\nmeaning in the target language. In this connection, Schleiermacher in\nparticular notes the following problem (which might be dubbed the\nparadox of paraphrase): If, faced with the task of translating an\nalien concept, a translator attempts to reproduce its intension by\nreproducing its extension with the aid of an elaborate paraphrase in\nhis own language, he will generally find that as he gets closer to the\noriginal extension he undermines the original intension in other ways.\nFor instance, faced with Homer\u2019s color word\nchl\u00f4ros, a word that Homer sometimes applies to things\nthat we would classify as green (e.g., healthy foliage) but at other\ntimes to things that we would classify as yellow (e.g., honey), a\ntranslator might attempt to reproduce the extension correctly by\ntranslating the word as \u201cgreen or yellow\u201d. But in doing so\nhe would be sacrificing the original intension in other ways\u2014for\nHomer did not have either the concept green or the concept\nyellow (only the concept chl\u00f4ros), and in addition for\nHomer chl\u00f4ros was not a disjunctive\nconcept.\n\n(c) Schleiermacher also identifies a number of further challenges that\ncommonly exacerbate the difficulty of translation. For example, he\nnotes that in the case of poetry it is necessary to reproduce not only\nthe semantic but also the musical aspects of the original, such as\nmeter and rhyme\u2014and this not merely as a desideratum over and\nabove the main task of reproducing meaning, but also as an essential\npart of that task, because in poetry such musical features\nserve as essential vehicles for the precise expression of meaning. And\nhe argues that in addition to reproducing meaning a translation should\nattempt to convey to its readership where an author was being\nconceptually conventional and where conceptually original\u2014for\nexample, by using older vocabulary from the target language in the\nformer cases and relative neologisms from it in the latter. But he\nalso notes that in both of these connections the added requirement or\ndesideratum involved will frequently stand in tension with that of\nfinding the closest semantic fit\u2014since, for example, it will\nturn out that the word that would best reproduce a rhyme or best\nreflect a concept\u2019s vintage is not the one that is closest in\nmeaning to the word in the original.\n\n(d) Because of this great difficulty, the translator needs to possess\nreal interpretive expertise, and to be an \u201cartist\u201d, if he\nis to cope with the task of translation at all adequately.\n\n(e) The conceptual gulf that poses the central challenge here might in\nprinciple be tackled in one of two broad ways: either by bringing the\nauthor\u2019s linguistic-conceptual world closer to that of the\nreader of the translation or vice versa. The former approach had been\nchampioned, among others, by Luther in his classic Letter on\nTranslation (1530) and had been practiced by him in his\ntranslation of the Bible (he called it Verdeutschung,\n\u201cGermanizing\u201d, in a strong sense of the term). However,\nSchleiermacher finds it unacceptable, mainly because it inevitably\ndistorts the author\u2019s concepts and thoughts. Schleiermacher\ntherefore champions the alternative approach of bringing the reader\ntoward the linguistic-conceptual world of the author as the only\nacceptable one.\n\nBut how can this possibly be accomplished?\n\n(f) According to Schleiermacher, the key to a solution lies in the\nplasticity of language. Because of this plasticity, even if the usages\nof words, and hence the concepts, expressed by the target language\nas it currently exists are incommensurable with the\nauthor\u2019s, it is still possible for a translator to\n\n\nbend the language of the translation as far possible toward that of\nthe original in order to communicate as far as possible an impression\nof the system of concepts developed in it. (DM\n25)\n\n\n(This solution presupposes principle\n (5)\n in the philosophy of language.) For instance, the translator faced\nwith the task of translating Homer\u2019s word chl\u00f4ros\nwould select the closest counterpart in the target language, say\n\u201cgreen\u201d, but then modify its usage over the course of the\ntranslation so that it is applied not only to things that are green\n(e.g., healthy foliage) but also to things that are yellow (e.g.,\nhoney).\n\n(g) This approach entails a strong preference for translating any\ngiven word in the original in a uniform way throughout the translation\nrather than switching between two or more different ways of\ntranslating it in different contexts.\n\n(h) This approach also makes for translations that are considerably\nless easy to read than those that can be achieved by the alternative\napproach (Verdeutschung). However, this is an acceptable\nprice to pay given that the only alternative is a failure to convey\nthe author\u2019s meaning at all accurately. Moreover, the offending\npeculiarities have a positive value in that they constantly remind the\nreader of the conceptual unfamiliarity of the material that is being\ntranslated and of the \u201cbending\u201d approach that is being\nemployed.\n\n(i) In order to work at all effectively, though, this approach\nrequires that large amounts of relevant material be translated, so\nthat the reader of the translation becomes habituated to it and\nacquires enough examples of a particular word\u2019s unfamiliar use\nin enough different contexts to enable him to infer the unfamiliar\nrule for use that is involved.\n\n(j) Even this optimal approach to translation has severe limitations,\nhowever. In particular, it will often be impossible to reproduce the\nholistic aspects of meaning\u2014the several related usages of a\ngiven word, the systems of related words/concepts, and the distinctive\ngrammar of the language. And since these holistic features are\ninternal to a word\u2019s meaning, this will entail a shortfall in\nthe communication of its meaning by the translation. Reading a\ntranslation therefore inevitably remains only a poor second best to\nreading the original, and the translator should think of his task as\none of striving to approximate an infinite, never fully realizable,\nideal.\n\n(k) Translation is still amply justified, though\u2014not only for\nthe obvious reason that it is necessary in order to make works\navailable to people who want to read them but are not in the fortunate\nposition of knowing the original languages, but also for the less\nobvious reason that through its \u201cbending\u201d approach it\neffects a conceptual enrichment of their language (and through its\nreproduction of musical features a musical enrichment).\n\n(l) Nor (Schleiermacher adds in answer to a worry that Herder had\nexpressed) need we fear that this enrichment will deprive our language\nof its authentic character. For in cases where a real conflict with\nthat character arises, the enrichments in question will soon wither\nfrom the language.\n\n(m) Schleiermacher also argues that the sort of approach to\ntranslation that he advocates can only be successful under certain\nvery specific historical circumstances (which he takes to be present\nin the Germany of his own day), including a widespread interest in\nforeign cultures and a high degree of flexibility in the language.\n\nHere again (as in the case of interpretation), not only the framework\nprinciples\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7),\n but most of these ideas about translation come from Herder.\nIn particular, Schleiermacher\u2019s central strategy of\n\u201cbending\u201d the target language in order to cope with\nconceptual incommensurability, and his point that it is also important\nto convey the musical aspects of an original (poetic) text in order to\nconvey its meaning accurately, both do so. (Relevant Herderian sources\nhere are the Fragments on Recent German Literature\n[1767\u20138] and the Popular Songs [Volkslieder]\n[1774 and 1778/9].)\n\nHowever, unlike Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of interpretation,\nwhich, as was mentioned earlier, often worsens Herder\u2019s, this\ntheory of translation tends to refine Herder\u2019s in some modest\nbut significant ways. Among the ideas just adumbrated, examples of\nthis occur in (b), where Schleiermacher\u2019s paradox of paraphrase\nis largely novel; (c), where his ideal of making clear in a\ntranslation at which points the author was being conceptually\nconventional and at which points conceptually original is novel; (h),\nwhere his idea that the oddities that result from the\n\u201cbending\u201d approach are not only an acceptable price to pay\nbut can actually serve a positive function is novel; (i), which is a\nnovel point; (j), where the point that semantic holism imposes\nprincipled limitations on the successfulness of translations is novel;\n(l), which plausibly contradicts Herder; and (m), which is a novel\npoint.\n\nIndeed, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of translation constitutes a\ngreat landmark in the subject, and his 1813 essay is arguably the\nsingle most important work on it ever written. Not only are the\ntheory\u2019s central claims important and defensible, but it has\nalso exercised an enormous influence on subsequent translation\ntheories, such as those of Walter Benjamin or, more recently, Antoine\nBerman and Lawrence Venuti with their \u201cforeignizing\u201d\napproach. Moreover, it is often superior to these descendant theories\n(e.g., avoiding the religious mysticism that Benjamin adds and\npreserving the traditional concern with meaning that Berman and Venuti\nexclude).\n7. Aesthetics\n\nSchleiermacher tended to be quite self-deprecating about his\nsensitivity to and knowledge of art, and hence about his aptitude for\naesthetics (e.g., in On Religion and the\nSoliloquies, where he is clearly rather in awe of the greater\ntalent and expertise in this area that such romantic friends as the\nSchlegel brothers enjoyed), and accordingly tended to shy away from\ndiscussing the subject in detail in his earlier work. However, he did\neventually bring himself to confront the subject systematically,\nnamely, in his lectures on aesthetics (first delivered in 1819, and\nthen again in 1825 and 1832\u20133).\n\nPart of his motivation behind this eventual confrontation with the\nsubject\u2014and part of the reason why it remains interesting\ntoday\u2014derives from the fact that the phenomenon of art, and in\nparticular the phenomenon of non-linguistic art (e.g., painting,\nsculpture, and music), prompts a certain theoretical question that is\nof fundamental importance, not only for the philosophy of art itself,\nbut also for hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation, and for\nthe philosophy of language that underlies it: Do non-linguistic arts\nsuch as painting, sculpture, and music express meanings and thoughts,\nand if so how? This question is obviously important for the philosophy\nof art. But it is also important for hermeneutics, or the theory of\ninterpretation, because it carries in its train such further questions\nas whether the theory of interpretation ought not to treat additional\nforms of expression besides the linguistic ones that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s own hermeneutics treats, what the appropriate\nmethods of interpretation might be in such additional cases, and how\nsuch additional cases and their interpretive methods might relate to\nlinguistic ones. Moreover, the question mentioned is also important\nfor the philosophy of language that underpins Schleiermacher\u2019s\ntheory of interpretation, as embodied in principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n For a positive answer to this question might threaten those two\nprinciples, or at least show that they need significant revision.\n\nIn his last cycle of aesthetics lectures (1832\u20133) Schleiermacher\ninitially pursued a very simple strategy for dealing with these issues\nconcerning non-linguistic art. However, he soon realized that the\nstrategy in question was untenable, and abandoned it for a more\npromising but also more ambiguous position.\n\nHis whole train of thought there closely followed one that Herder had\nalready pursued in the Critical Forests (1769), so it may be\nuseful to begin with a brief sketch of the latter. By the time of\nwriting the Critical Forests Herder was already committed to\nhis own versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n Accordingly, in reaction to the phenomenon of the non-linguistic arts\nthe book initially set out to argue for a theory of their nature that\nwould preserve consistency with those principles, and it did so in a\nvery straightforward way, denying the non-linguistic arts any the\nability to express thoughts or meanings autonomously of\nlanguage by denying them any ability to express thoughts or meanings\nat all: whereas poetry has a sense, a soul, a force, music is\na mere succession of objects in time, and sculpture and painting are\nmerely spatial; whereas poetry not only depends on the senses but also\nrelates to the imagination, music, sculpture, and painting belong\nsolely to the senses (to hearing, feeling, and vision, respectively);\nwhereas poetry uses voluntary and conventional signs, music,\nsculpture, and painting employ only natural ones. However, as\nHerder proceeded with his book he came to realize that this simplistic\nsolution was untenable: in the third part of the book he stumbled upon\nthe awkward case of ancient coins, which, though normally\nnon-linguistic, clearly do nonetheless often express meanings and\nthoughts in pictorial ways. This realization did not lead him to\nabandon his versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n however. Instead, it brought him to a more refined account of the\nnon-linguistic arts which was still consistent with those principles:\nthe non-linguistic arts do sometimes express meanings and thoughts,\nbut the meanings and thoughts in question are ones that are\nparasitic on a prior linguistic expression or expressibility of\nthem by the artist. In the fourth part of the book (which was not\npublished until the middle of the nineteenth century, and was hence\nunknown to Schleiermacher) Herder already extended this solution from\ncoins to painting; and in subsequent works he extended it to sculpture\nand music as well.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s aesthetics lectures follow a strikingly similar\ncourse. He at first sets out to develop a version of the theory that\nHerder had initially developed in the Critical Forests,\ncorrelating the several non-linguistic arts with the different senses\nas Herder\u2019s theory had done (his only significant revision here\nconsists in modifying Herder\u2019s correlation of sculpture with the\nsense of touch to include vision as well as touch). Like\nHerder\u2019s initial theory, Schleiermacher\u2019s is largely\nmotivated by his prior commitment to principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n which, again like Herder\u2019s initial theory, it seeks to\nvindicate in a naive way: non-linguistic arts, such as music and\nsculpture, do not express meanings or thoughts autonomously\nof language because they do not express them at all. For\nexample, Schleiermacher argues that music merely expresses\nphysiologically based \u201clife-conditions\n[Lebenszust\u00e4nde]\u201d, not representations or\nthoughts. However, rather like Herder with his ancient coins, in the\ncourse of developing this naive solution Schleiermacher stumbles upon\na case that forces him to the realization that it is untenable: He\ndevelops his naive solution smoothly enough for the cases of music and\npainting, but then in the middle of his discussion of sculpture he\nsuddenly recalls Pausanias\u2019s account that the very earliest\nGreek sculptures were merely rough blocks whose function was to serve,\nprecisely, as symbols of religious ideas (oops!). He\nsubsequently goes on to note that an analogous point holds for other\nnon-linguistic arts, such as painting, as well. Accordingly, at this\nstage in his lectures he changes tack. He now acknowledges that\nnon-linguistic arts do (at least sometimes) express meanings\nand thoughts after all, and he goes on to vacillate between two new,\nand mutually conflicting, accounts of that fact: (a) The arts in\nquestion do so in such a way that the meanings and thoughts involved\nare at least sometimes not (yet) linguistically articulable. (In\nparticular, he suggests that the early Greek sculpture just mentioned\nexpressed religious ideas that only later got expressed\nlinguistically.) This account would entail abandoning or at least\nseverely revising principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n (b) The arts in question do so in virtue of a pre-existing linguistic\narticulation or articulability of the same meanings and thoughts in\nthe artist. (Schleiermacher actually only says in virtue of\n\u201csomething universal\u201d, \u201ca representation\u201d, but\na dependence on language seems clearly implied.) This account is\nsimilar to Herder\u2019s final account, and, like it, would preserve\nprinciples\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n In the end, then, having renounced his initial\u2014clearly\nuntenable\u2014position, Schleiermacher is left torn between these\ntwo more plausible-looking positions, which, however, contradict each\nother.\n\nThe eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German hermeneutic tradition as\na whole was similarly torn between these two positions. As has already\nbeen mentioned, (b) was the considered position at which Herder\neventually arrived. But (a) had strong champions as well\u2014in\nparticular, Hamann, Wackenroder and Tieck, Hegel (concerning\narchitecture and sculpture), and the later Dilthey. The choice between\nthese two positions is a genuinely difficult one, philosophically\nspeaking.\n\nWhere does this leave Schleiermacher in relation to the several issues\nbearing on his hermeneutics and his philosophy of language that, I\nsuggested, encouraged him to undertake this investigation of\nnon-linguistic art in the first place? Concerning the primary\nquestion, whether the non-linguistic arts express meanings and\nthoughts and if so how, he has now realized that they do indeed (at\nleast sometimes) express meanings and thoughts, but he remains torn on\nexactly how they do so. Concerning his theory of interpretation, that\nrealization is already important, because it shows that interpretation\ntheory does indeed need to extend its coverage beyond linguistic cases\nto include at least some cases of non-linguistic art. But he remains\ntorn on the further issues in this area\u2014in particular, on\nwhether, as (a) implies, there will be cases in which the\ninterpretation of non-linguistic art will transcend the interpretation\nof any associated language or, as (b) implies, it will always be\ndependent on and restricted by the interpretation of associated\nlanguage. Finally, concerning the philosophy of language that\nunderpins his theory of interpretation, he remains torn about whether\nthe meanings and thoughts that are expressed by non-linguistic art are\nalways parasitic on language (position (b)), so that principles\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n can be retained without any qualification or modification, or they\nare instead sometimes independent of language (position (a)), so that\nprinciples\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n will either have to be abandoned or (with Hamann in his\nMetacritique [1784]) (re)construed in a way that stretches\ntheir reference to \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201cwords\u201d to\ninclude not-strictly-linguistic-or-verbal symbol use in the\nnon-linguistic arts.\n\nAnother motive behind Schleiermacher\u2019s treatment of art in his\nlate aesthetics lectures concerns its cultural status, especially\nrelative to religion. It was an abiding concern of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s from early in his career until the very end of\nit\u2014one that set him at odds with the predominant tendency of\nearly German romanticism\u2014to subordinate art to religion. The\nfinal cycle of the aesthetics lectures from 1832\u20133 is just the\nlast in a long line of attempts to achieve this goal. It seems to me,\nhowever, that, partly for reasons already touched on, this last\nattempt turns out to be oddly and interestingly self-subverting.\n\nLet us first briefly survey Schleiermacher\u2019s broader series of\nattempts to subordinate art, and then consider how this last one\nproves self-subverting. It was already one of the early\nSchleiermacher\u2019s main goals to turn contemporary culture, and\nespecially the romantic movement, away from the then fashionable idea\nthat art was the highest possible type of insight toward the idea that\nreligion was. This is an important part of the project of On\nReligion (1799), where he criticizes the sort of elevation of art\nabove religion that Goethe and Schiller had begun and the romantics\nhad then accentuated, complains of the trivial nature of modern art,\nand argues that art ought to subserve religion, as Plato had thought.\n(The early Schleiermacher was in a way strikingly successful in\nachieving his goal: after 1799, largely under his influence, the\nleading romantics did increasingly turn away from art toward religion,\nand to some extent the same was also true of German culture more\ngenerally.) The ethics lectures of 1812\u201313 continue the same\nproject in a certain way. There Schleiermacher represents art as of\nits very nature a collective expression of religious feeling (one that\ndiffers in accordance with the differences between religions). In\nother words, he represents art as only true to its own nature when it\nsubserves religion. The 1830 psychology lectures develop an\ninteresting variation on the same theme. There Schleiermacher argues\nthat the perception of beauty is a feeling but one that has a certain\nsort of deep cognitive content in that it expresses the relation of\nintelligence to Being. This makes it sound very much like religious\nfeeling, and indeed in these lectures it is treated as a sort of close\nsecond-in-command to religious feeling. It might seem as though, from\nSchleiermacher\u2019s standpoint, there was a danger here of art\nacquiring too independent and exalted a status. However, that danger\nis in part averted by the fact that he is here talking primarily about\nnatural beauty, and only secondarily about artistic\nbeauty.\n\nThe 1832\u20133 aesthetics lectures continue this sort of\nart-demoting project, but in a different way. Schleiermacher\u2019s\ninitial intention there, it seems, was to demote art (in comparison\nwith religion) in two respects: First, as we saw, the lectures\ninitially set out to give an account of non-linguistic arts (music,\npainting, and sculpture) that represents them as merely expressive of\nsensuous feelings and non-cognitive in character. Second, the lectures\ngive an account of poetry that represents it as merely national and\nindeed individual in nature, not universal like science and (at least\nin a way) religion. Thus the lectures argue that art generally, and\ntherefore poetry in particular, is national in nature, not universal,\nand more radically that it indeed has the function of expressing\nindividuality, of resisting even the commonality of a national\nlanguage (thereby making explicit a potential that is also present,\nthough less fully realized, in normal language use).\n\nHowever, as I suggested, this twofold strategy for demoting art turns\nout to be curiously self-subverting. For one thing, as we saw, the\nmodel of non-linguistic art as merely sensuous and non-cognitive in\nthe end proves to be unsustainable. Moreover, not only does\nnon-linguistic art turn out to have a cognitive content after all, but\nin addition that fact becomes clear from a case (the earliest Greek\nsculpture) in which the content in question is not trivial but deeply\nreligious in character. Furthermore, this self-subversion would be\neven more extreme if position (a) won out over position (b) in the\nend. For another thing, poetry\u2019s function of expressing\nindividuality implies that for Schleiermacher it represents the\nhighest ethical value (for more on individuality\u2019s high\nstatus in Schleiermacher\u2019s ethics, see below). In short, what\nwas intended as a demotion of art turns willy-nilly into a sort of\ncognitive-religious and ethical exaltation of it.\n8. Dialectics\n\nMost of Schleiermacher\u2019s earliest philosophical work as part of\nthe romantic movement was in areas of the subject that might\nreasonably be described as peripheral in comparison with such central\nareas as metaphysics and epistemology (in particular, philosophy of\nreligion, ethics, and hermeneutics). This fact, together no doubt with\nthe imposing presence of several intellectual competitors who had\nrecently made or were making contributions in those central areas\n(including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel), seems to have spurred\nhim to develop his own treatment of them. The result was his\n\u201cdialectics\u201d, which he began presenting in lecture-form in\n1811. (This subject-title calls to mind relevant approaches not only\nin Plato and Aristotle, but also in Kant and Hegel.)\n\nAccordingly, Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics in some ways carries\nthe marks of a discipline that he felt forced to develop, rather than\none for which he had a clear, compelling vision (as he had for his\nphilosophy of religion and his hermeneutics, for example). For one\nthing, the nature of the discipline undergoes a striking shift between\nits two earliest versions (the lectures of 1811 and\n1814\u201315)\u2014which have the character of fairly conventional\ntreatments of metaphysical and epistemological issues, already\nconcerned to some extent with resolving disagreements indeed, but in a\npurely theoretical way\u2014and its two main later versions (the\nlectures of 1822 and the book-fragment from 1833), which make the art\nof resolving disagreements through conversation the core of the\ndiscipline (albeit that \u201cconversation\u201d here includes not\nonly the paradigm case of oral communication but also written\ncommunication and even dialogue internal to a single person\u2019s\nmind). This shift might be roughly described as one from a more\nAristotelian to a more Socratic-Platonic conception of\n\u201cdialectics\u201d.\n\nFor another thing, in all of its versions Schleiermacher\u2019s\ndialectics has an oddly rag-bag appearance, including as it does not\nonly material that would naturally be classified as metaphysics and\nepistemology, but also large helpings of philosophy of mind, logic\n(especially the logic of concepts and judgments; Schleiermacher treats\nthe logic of syllogism in a reductive and rather deprecatory way),\nphilosophy of science, and philosophy of religion.\n\nIn its final versions (on which I shall focus here), the discipline\nhas the following character: Its concern is with what Schleiermacher\ncalls \u201cpure thought\u201d, as distinguished from the thought of\neveryday affairs or of art\u2014that is, with thought that aims at\ntruth, rather than merely at achieving practical ends or inventing\nfictions. (Schleiermacher denies, though, that the former is sharply\nseparated from the latter two; rather, it is to some degree implicit\nin them as well as vice versa.)\n\nAccording to Schleiermacher, genuine knowledge of its very nature\nrequires, not only (1) correspondence to reality, but also (2)\nsystematic coherence with all knowledge, and (3) universal\nagreement among people. The main motive behind this elaborate position\nseems to be the thought that there is in principle no way to determine\nthe fulfillment of condition (1) directly, so that believers\nneed to rely on guidance by the fulfillment of conditions (2) and (3).\n(The German scholar Manfred Frank, in a well known early\ninterpretation of Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics that he gave in\nhis book Das individuelle Allgemeine (1985), accentuated\ncondition (3), attributing to Schleiermacher on the strength of it a\nconsensus theory of truth. However, in his subsequent edition of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics lectures Frank rightly admitted that\nthis interpretation had overlooked the realism implied by condition\n(1). Incidentally, Frank\u2019s self-correction of the reading of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics that he had given in Das\nindividuelle Allgemeine also undercuts his equally well known\nearly reading of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics there, which\nbuilt upon this ascription to Schleiermacher of a consensus theory of\ntruth an ascription to him of a\u2014roughly\nGadamerian\u2014conception of interpretation as an ongoing\nconstruction of facts about meaning through the development of\ninterpretations.)\n\nNot surprisingly given how strong the three conditions just mentioned\nare, Schleiermacher considers genuine knowledge to be only an\n\u201cidea\u201d toward which we can make progress, not something\nthat we can ever actually achieve. (Not coincidentally, this position\nresembles his official positions in hermeneutics and translation\ntheory that the correct understanding of another person and the\ncorrect translation of a text are only goals to which we can\napproximate, not ones that we can ever actually achieve. This is a\ncharacteristically romantic pattern.)\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics is largely conceived as a\nmethodology for making such progress. This project proceeds relatively\nsmoothly in connection with conditions (1) and (2). For example, in\nconnection with (1), Schleiermacher develops certain principles\nconcerning how to form concepts correctly rather than incorrectly\n(i.e., in such a way that\u2014as a more recent idiom would put\nit\u2014they, their superordinate genus-concepts, their subordinate\nspecies-concepts, and their contrasting coordinate concepts\n\u201ccarve nature at the joints\u201d). And in connection with (2),\nwhile he acknowledges that the task of forming a totality of knowledge\nis of its nature incompletable, he nonetheless prescribes what he\ncalls \u201cheuristic\u201d and \u201carchitectonic\u201d\nprocedures for, respectively, amassing pieces of knowledge and forming\nthem together into a coherent whole.\n\nHowever, the project runs into deeper difficulties in relation to\ncondition (3). There are two main problems here. First, besides the\nobvious and avowed impossibility of actually accessing all people in\norder to come to agreement with them, Schleiermacher also identifies a\nfurther obstacle in the way of reaching, or even making significant\nprogress toward, agreement with them: the deep differences that exist\nbetween different languages and modes of thought. The dialectics\nlectures fail to find any promising way of coping with this problem.\nThe 1822 version attempts to do so in two ways, but neither of them\nlooks hopeful. Its first approach consists in hypothesizing a domain\nof \u201cinnate concepts\u201d that are common to everyone (with\ncertain qualifications, for example, that these concepts require\nsensations in order to be actualized). This would certainly solve the\nproblem, but only by contradicting Schleiermacher\u2019s normal, and\nmore plausible, position, from which the problem arose in the first\nplace, that there is no such conceptual common ground between\nall languages (or even, Schleiermacher normally adds, between all\nindividuals who in some sense share a given language). The second\napproach that the 1822 version tries is an argument that we need to\ndevelop a complete history of the differences in question and of how\nthey arose. However, this proposal seems beside the point\u2014a\ndistraction from the problem rather than a solution to it.\n\nIn his 1833 book-fragment Schleiermacher at some points seems close to\ngiving up on this problem, saying in one place that because of it\ndialectics must restrict itself to a specific \u201clinguistic\nsphere\u201d. But at other points he evidently still clings to the\nhope of finding common ground that unites different \u201clinguistic\nspheres\u201d. What sort of solution does he have in mind? The answer\ncan perhaps be seen from an 1831 address that he delivered on\nLeibniz\u2019s idea of a universal language. In this address he in\neffect argues that it was a mistake on Leibniz\u2019s part to suppose\nthat there was already conceptual common ground shared by\neveryone, which could be captured in a universal language (this also\namounts to a rejection of his own dubious idea in the 1822 lectures of\ncommon \u201cinnate concepts\u201d), but that the sort of conceptual\ncommon ground that Leibniz had thus wrongly envisaged as\nalready existing can nonetheless be achieved (or at\nleast approached) for the sciences in the future, namely, by\ncultivating an attitude of openness to the borrowing of conceptual\nresources from other languages when such resources prove themselves\nuseful for the sciences (a process that, according to Schleiermacher,\nis in fact already strongly underway, and which is realizable either\nthrough borrowing the foreign words in question outright or by\ntranslating them into one\u2019s own language in the sort of\nscrupulous way that his theory of translation advocates).\nSchleiermacher notes that this solution requires an (in any case\nhealthy) shedding of prejudices about the superiority of one\u2019s\nown language, mode of thought, and people over others. This looks like\nSchleiermacher\u2019s most promising solution to the problem in\nquestion. He did not, however, live long enough to develop it in\ndetail or to build on it toward a more complete method for resolving\ninterlinguistic disagreements.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more surprising, problem is that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics lectures do not even develop a\nsubstantive account of how to resolve disagreements through\nconversation within a \u201clinguistic sphere\u201d.\nHowever, here again it is fortunately possible to supplement the\ndialectics lectures with additional material that goes further in such\na direction. One important text in this connection is\nSchleiermacher\u2019s early essay Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct (1799), which is precisely concerned with the art of\nconversation within a linguistic sphere. This early essay emphasizes\nthe importance of finding (conceptual) \u201ccontent\u201d that one\nshares with one\u2019s interlocutor(s), and restricting one\u2019s\nconversation to this. Schleiermacher accordingly recommends that one\nbegin a conversation guided by a sort of minimal estimate of such\ncontent arrived at from one\u2019s knowledge of such things as the\nprofession, the educational background, and the class of one\u2019s\ninterlocutor(s), and that one then tentatively and experimentally work\noutwards toward identifying and exploiting further shared\ncontent\u2014a process that he recommends one should undertake, not\nby the heavy-handed method of introducing doubtfully shared content\ndirectly, but rather by the subtler method of introducing it\nindirectly in the form of a dimension of allusion and satire that one\nadds to one\u2019s treatment of already established shared content\n(after which, if the response from the interlocutor(s) is positive, it\ncan join the previously established shared content as a proper\nsubject-matter for direct treatment).\n\nAnother helpful text in this connection is Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics lectures, which implicitly revise the earlier account\njust described in two respects: (a) In that account conversation was\nto be restricted to conceptual content that was already shared between\ninterlocutors. But as we saw previously, by the time Schleiermacher\ndelivers the hermeneutics lectures he is skeptical that people\never really share conceptual content. Consequently, he would\npresumably now set the bar for fruitful conversation somewhat lower\nthan strict sharing. (b) Also, it seems reasonable to infer from his\nconception of hermeneutics that he would now place less emphasis on\ndiscovering pre-existing commonalities, or even near-commonalities,\nand more on refining those found and establishing further\nones\u2014in both cases, with the help of an adept use of the art of\nhermeneutics.\n\nFinally, Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics lectures also supply an\nadditional part of his seemingly missing solution to the problem of\nreaching agreement through conversation, both in inter- and in\nintra-linguistic contexts. Clearly, any art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation is going to depend on an art of interpreting\ninterlocutors. Accordingly, the dialectics lectures explicitly assert\nthat dialectics is dependent on hermeneutics (as well as vice versa),\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception of hermeneutics as a universal\ndiscipline ensures its applicability to conversations, and\nSchleiermacher indeed mentions in the hermeneutics lectures that he\nsometimes applies his own hermeneutical principles in conversational\ncontexts. In short, Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics itself\nconstitutes an important component of his art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation.\n\nIn sum, whereas Schleiermacher\u2019s final conception of dialectics\nas a discipline leads one to expect it to provide a fairly detailed\nset of procedures for resolving both inter- and intra-linguistic\ndisagreements in conversation (analogous to the detailed set of\nprocedures for interpretation that one finds in his hermeneutics),\nthis expectation is largely disappointed by the dialectics lectures\nthemselves. However, one can supplement them from other texts in order\nto see how Schleiermacher might have envisaged a fuller solution to\nthis task.\n\nOne last point that should be mentioned in this connection is the\nfollowing. Schleiermacher\u2019s most prominent motive for developing\nsuch an art of conversation is the epistemological one described\nabove. That may or may not be a good motive in the end. However,\nSchleiermacher also has further, independent motives behind this art\nthat are more obviously attractive. Thus, his 1831 address on Leibniz\nimplies two additional motives behind the intercultural side of the\nart: first, Schleiermacher\u2019s cosmopolitan concern for humanity\nas a whole in all of its diversity constitutes a moral reason for\npromoting fruitful intercultural dialogue; and second, his sense that\ninsight, far from being a monopoly of ours, is dispersed among many\ncultures constitutes another reason for us to engage in such dialogue.\nSchleiermacher would presumably say that analogous considerations help\nto justify the intracultural side of the art as well. In addition, the\nessay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct emphasizes yet\nanother motive behind the intracultural side of the art. In this essay\nSchleiermacher does not yet mention his later epistemological motive\nat all, but instead focuses on more direct benefits that he expects to\naccrue from fruitful conversation between members of society, in\nparticular the individual\u2019s enrichment of his own limited\nperspective through an incorporation of the different perspectives of\nother people. Schleiermacher would presumably say that an analogous\nconsideration helps to justify the intercultural side of the art as\nwell. In short, even if it were to turn out that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s predominant epistemological motive for\ndeveloping an art of inter- and intra-cultural conversation were\nunpersuasive, such an art might still be valuable for other reasons\nthat he also has in mind such as these ones.\n\nFinally, a few further positions that Schleiermacher develops in his\ndialectics should also be mentioned, albeit more briefly. One rather\nstriking position is a denial that any concepts, thoughts, or\ncognitions are either purely a priori in character or purely\nempirical\u2014either the product of the \u201cintellectual\u201d\nfunction alone or of the \u201corganic\u201d function alone. Rather,\nall are the product of both functions\u2014though the\nproportions in which they are involved vary from case to\ncase.\n\nMore specifically, as Schleiermacher conceives the situation, all are\nlocated on a continuum that stretches between the maximally\n\u201cintellectual\u201d ideas of Being or God and the maximally\n\u201corganic\u201d chaos of sensations. These two extremes do not\nthemselves involve mixture: Being or God is purely intellectual, while\nthe chaos of sensations is purely organic. However, they do not for\nthat reason constitute counterexamples to the position just mentioned,\nbecause they are not themselves strictly speaking concepts, thoughts,\nor cognitions.\n\nAs was mentioned previously, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of concepts\nalso says that these are in each case defined by relations of\nsubsumption under higher concepts, contrast with correlative concepts\nsimilarly subsumed, and subsumption of further concepts under them.\nSubsumption under the non-concept Being and the subsumption of a class\nof primitive judgments concerning sensations constitute special cases\nat the two extremes of this conceptual hierarchy.\n\nAnother position that Schleiermacher holds is that the (Kantian)\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is a merely\n\u201crelative\u201d one. Part of his reason for this position seems\nto lie in his view that all judgments are partly empirical in nature\n(a consideration that anticipates Quine). But what he mainly seems to\nhave in mind here is that it is always in some sense up to us to\ndecide how many and which characteristic marks to build into any given\nsubject concept, and therefore how many and which judgments in which\nthat subject concept features will count as analytic or as\nsynthetic.\n\nA last feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics is more puzzling.\nSchleiermacher notes at one point that he wants to chart a sort of\nmiddle course between ancient dialectics, which had the virtue of\nopenness but the vice of courting skepticism, and the dogmatism of the\nscholastics, for whom everything of importance was pre-decided in a\nreligious principle that they presupposed. His concession to the\nformer position has in effect already been described above. But what\nabout his concession to the latter? This takes the form of positing a\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d or God which is (1) beyond all\noppositions, including those of thought/reality, thought/volition, and\nconcept/judgment, (2) beyond Being (even though Being is itself beyond\nsuch oppositions), (3) an essential impulse behind, and accompaniment\nof, all attempts to know, and (4) not thinkable or linguistically\nexpressible but instead felt. This is all rather mysterious. For\nexample, the philosophical rationale for positing such a\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d or God as beyond rather than\nidentical with Being is obscure, and so too is the exact way in which\nit is supposed to be the impulse behind, and accompaniment of, all\nattempts to know.\n9. Ethics\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s ethical thought divides into two overlapping\nchronological phases. The first phase\u2014which stretched from the\nlate 1780s until about 1803\u2014was mainly critical in character.\nEarly in this phase, the three unpublished essays On the Highest\nGood (1789), On What Gives Value to Life (1792\u20133),\nand On Freedom (1790\u20133) mounted a sustained attack on\nKant\u2019s ethical theory, and at the end of this phase the longer\npublished work Outlines of a Critique of Previous Ethical\nTheory (1803) developed that attack into a more comprehensive and\nsystematic critique of previous ethical theories. The second\nphase\u2014which began around 1800\u2014was by contrast mainly\nconstructive in character. To this phase belong the\nSoliloquies (1800), the Draft of an Ethics\n(1805\u20136), and Schleiermacher\u2019s mature ethics lectures\n(including the complete draft from 1812\u201313, as well as a number\nof later partial drafts).\n\nThe three early essays On the Highest Good, On What Gives\nValue to Life, and On Freedom criticize and reject\ncentral tenets of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy: in particular,\nKant\u2019s inclusion of an apportioning of happiness to moral desert\nin the \u201chighest good [summum bonum]\u201d;\nKant\u2019s position that this must be believed in as a\npresupposition of morality, so that its own implicit presuppositions,\nan afterlife of the soul and a God, must be so as well (the doctrine\nof the \u201cpostulates\u201d); and Kant\u2019s incompatibilism\nconcerning causal determinism and the freedom that is required for\nmoral responsibility, and consequent recourse to the causally\nindeterministic noumenal realm as the locus for freedom (On\nFreedom argues to the contrary that all human actions are\ncausally determined, but that this is compatible with the freedom that\nis required for moral responsibility).\n\nA further area of disagreement with Kant forms the hinge on which\nSchleiermacher\u2019s development of his own constructive ethical\ntheory turns. Kant\u2019s fundamental moral principle, the\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d, consisted, according to its\ncentral formulation, in a requirement that an agent\u2019s moral\nmaxim (or intention) be consistent when universalized, and was\nconceived by Kant to be shared by all human beings.\nSchleiermacher rejects this position in two ways. First, already in\nOn What Gives Value to Life, and then especially in the\nSoliloquies, he argues against the latter idea of uniformity\nin ethics\u2014instead asserting, in the spirit of Herder (and others\ninfluenced by Herder, such as Goethe, Schiller, and fellow romantics),\nthe fact and value of diversity or individuality\neven in the moral sphere. In this connection, Schleiermacher champions\nnot only a (moral) distinctiveness of different human societies\nvis-\u00e0-vis the human species as a whole (this had been\nHerder\u2019s main cause), but also a (moral) distinctiveness of the\nindividual vis-\u00e0-vis his society (this had also been a cause of\nHerder\u2019s). (In On Religion Schleiermacher makes an\nanalogous case for both societal and individual diversity in religion.\nHis positive evaluation of societal and individual diversity naturally\nalso extends beyond morals and religion to other domains.)\n\nSecond, Schleiermacher also rejects the content of Kant\u2019s\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d as specified by its central\nformulation: the requirement of consistency of a maxim under\nuniversalization. In On Religion and the Soliloquies\nSchleiermacher is rather inclined to champion Kant\u2019s subordinate\nformula of a commitment to the welfare of humanity, though\nnot in Kant\u2019s sense of a common rational nature, but instead in\nHerder\u2019s sense of all human beings in their diversities as well\nas their commonalities. (In On Religion he also discusses the\nhistorical dimension of this principle of humanity in a Herderian\nspirit, like Herder in Ideas for the Philosophy of History of\nHumanity [1784\u201391] emphasizing the important role that has\nbeen played by (Christian) religion in advancing it, and interpreting\nhistory as its progressive realization.)\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s commitment to humanity implies a commitment to\nmoral cosmopolitanism, or moral respect for all human beings. But, as\nwe have just seen, he espouses this commitment despite, or even in\npart because of, a recognition of their moral diversity. This\nconstitutes a novel form of moral cosmopolitanism: a\npluralist cosmopolitanism that sharply contrasts with the\nhomogenizing cosmopolitanism of the philosophical tradition\n(e.g., the Stoics and Kant), which had instead been predicated on an\nassumption of moral uniformity. This innovation had already been\nanticipated by Herder, but Schleiermacher embraces it even more\nclearly. It is arguably the single most important contribution to\nphilosophical reflection on cosmopolitanism of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries. \n\nThis position of Schleiermacher\u2019s might seem to court the\nfollowing sort of problem, though: What if the moral values of a\nsociety or an individual conflict with the ideal of humanity? What if,\nfor example, the society is Nazi Germany or the individual Hitler? In\nthe Soliloquies Schleiermacher tries to forestall this sort\nof problem by limiting the forms of moral distinctiveness and\nindividuality that he supports to those that are compatible with, or\neven conducive to, the ideal of humanity. Thus he expresses his\ncommitment to moral distinctiveness or individuality in such formulas\nas that a person should be an individual \u201cwithout violating the\nlaws of humanity\u201d, that \u201ceach human being should represent\nhumanity in his own way\u201d, and that what is valuable is a\nperson\u2019s \u201cdistinctive being and its relation to\nhumanity\u201d. Similarly, his championing of (moral) diversity or\nindividuality is always combined with requirements of a measure of\nconformity with a broader species-wide or societal whole.\n\nThis constructive tension between \u201cdistinctive\n[eigent\u00fcmlich]\u201d and \u201cuniversal\u201d sides\nof morality survives to constitute the central principle of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s mature ethics lectures. There he begins by\narguing that very general versions or analogues of such a constructive\ntension exist as universal facts of nature\u2014that all finite\nbeings exhibit such a tension; more specifically, that all life does\nso in the form of a tension between autonomy and social commonality;\nand more specifically still, that all human mental life does so in\nthat same form. He then goes on to derive from this a moral duty to\nrealize such a tension in one\u2019s own person.\n\nThis position prompts further questions, to which the answers are not\nentirely clear. First, is Schleiermacher not here guilty of the\nso-called \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d, i.e., the fallacy of\nundertaking to deduce an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d?\nThe answer would depend on the exact nature of his derivation of the\nmoral duty involved from the universal facts of nature, which is\nobscure. Second, how can a synthesis of commonality with individuality\nbe both an unavoidable fact about human nature (e.g., since we can\nnever quite share any concepts, we also can never quite share\nany moral concepts in particular) and a moral duty? There are two\npossible answers to this puzzle. One would appeal to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s determinism and compatibilism: that a mode of\nexistence or behavior is inevitable does not for him preclude its\nmoral obligatoriness. The other would instead appeal to the fact that\nthe sort of synthesis in question can come in varying degrees: it\nmight be that some degree of moral individuality is indeed\ninevitable for the reason mentioned but that the degree that is\nmorally required is greater.\n\nIn addition to the central principle just discussed, three further\naspects of the mature ethics lectures are worth mentioning briefly:\n(a) As was reflected in the argument just sketched,\nSchleiermacher\u2019s mature conception of ethics is that it is\nfundamentally ontological rather than merely prescriptive in\ncharacter: it is based on the immanence of \u201creason\u201d in\n\u201cnature\u201d, and is hence more fundamentally a matter of an\n\u201cis\u201d than of an \u201cought\u201d. (b) Accordingly (with\nan eye to the role of \u201creason\u201d just mentioned), for\nSchleiermacher ethics is not fundamentally a matter of\nsentiments\u2014which, he says, simply vary\u2014but instead of\ncognitions, or more exactly, of something that grounds both ethical\nsentiments and ethical cognitions. (Here Schleiermacher is close to\nagreement with Kant.) (c) Accordingly again (but this time with an eye\nto the predominance of ontology over prescription just mentioned),\nSchleiermacher divides his ethics into a Doctrine of Goods, a Doctrine\nof Virtue, and a Doctrine of Duties, treating them in this sequence in\norder to reflect what he takes to be the priority, or greater\nfundamentalness, of goods over virtues and of virtues over duties.\n\nDespite all of these intriguing lines of thought,\nSchleiermacher\u2019s mature ethics lectures are not one of his\ngreatest successes. They contain a rather unholy mixture of, not only\nethics in the usual sense, but also political philosophy, metaphysics,\nepistemology, and philosophy of mind; lurch back and forth between\nclaims of startling dubiousness and claims of startling banality (with\ntoo little in between); and hold all of this together with a thick\nstain of obscurantism and a thin varnish of systematicity. One is\noften left with the impression that, having put the more critical\nphase of his work in ethics behind him, Schleiermacher found that he\ndid not really have enough constructive to say about the subject to\nfill up the hours in the lecture hall.\n10. Political and Social Philosophy\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s political and social philosophy is found\nscattered through a considerable number of works from different\nperiods. Its most systematic, though not necessarily most interesting,\nstatement occurs in his lectures on the theory of the state, which\nwere delivered between 1808\u20139 and 1833.\n\nConcerning international politics, Schleiermacher\u2019s fundamental\nposition is thoroughly Herderian: a cosmopolitan commitment to equal\nmoral respect for all peoples in all their diversity. This position is\nalready articulated in On What Gives Value to Life\n(1792\u20133); it is central to On Religion (1799) and the\nSoliloquies (1800), in the form of a commitment to the\nHerderian ideal of \u201chumanity\u201d; and it survives in later\nworks as well (for example, in the 1831 address on Leibniz\u2019s\nidea of a universal language).\n\nConcerning domestic politics: Schleiermacher was always somewhat\nreticent about fundamental constitutional questions (no doubt due to a\ncertain aversion to the state as such, a greater concern to protect\nagainst it than to develop it). To judge from his early enthusiasm for\nthe French Revolution, his republican-democratic model of an ideal\nchurch in On Religion, and his advocacy of the democratic\nnature of the university in Occasional Thoughts on Universities in\na German Spirit, together with an Appendix on One about to be\nFounded (1808), the early Schleiermacher was strongly attracted\nto republicanism and democracy (like Herder and the young Friedrich\nSchlegel). However, his later position\u2014while it still makes\nconsent a conditio sine qua non of any genuine state\u2014is\nmore sympathetic to aristocratic and monarchical forms of government.\nThus in his lectures on the theory of the state from 1829\u201333 he\nargues that whereas smaller and \u201clower\u201d states are\nnaturally democratic, larger and \u201chigher\u201d ones are\nnaturally aristocratic or monarchical.\n\nHowever, Schleiermacher\u2019s domestic politics is more consistently\nradical in another respect: liberalism. (Here again he is probably\nindebted to Herder.) This ideal is already prominent in two works from\n1799: the essay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct argues\nthat there should be a sphere of free (by which Schleiermacher means\nespecially: state-free) social interaction, in order to make possible\nthe development and communication of individuality; and On\nReligion argues strongly against state-interference in religion,\nmaking the liberation of religion from such interference a fundamental\npart of its program for developing individualism in religion, and\ndiagnosing some of the worst vices of current religion and churches in\nterms of such interference. This liberalism remains prominent in the\nethics lectures of 1812\u201313, which add to the positions just\nmentioned a proscription of state interference in the universities.\nAnd it is still central to Schleiermacher\u2019s political thought in\nhis (otherwise much more conservative) late lectures on the theory of\nthe state from 1829\u201333, where he argues that the three spheres\nof sociality, religion, and science (e.g., the universities) lie\nbeyond the legitimate power of the state, and notes critically that\nthe current (Prussian) state falls short of this ideal. His Augsburg\nConfession sermons from 1830 are likewise still liberal.\nSchleiermacher has several reasons for this broad liberalism, but one\nof his most fundamental ones lies in the need to free up a domain in\nwhich the basic good of individuality can develop.\n\nSchleiermacher devotes especially close attention to the question of\nreligion\u2019s proper relation to the state (and to other\nsocio-political institutions). As was mentioned, in On\nReligion he indicates two main reasons why religion should be\nliberated from state interference: first, because individualism in\nreligion, the autonomous development of a multiplicity of forms of\nreligion, is valuable; and second, because state-interference corrupts\nthe nature of religion, in particular by attracting the wrong sorts of\npeople into leadership positions within the church (men with worldly\nskills and motives rather than religious ones) and foisting alien\npolitical functions onto religious mysteries such as baptism and\nmarriage. He argues that the true socio-political center of religion\nshould instead be the family\u2014a position that he subsequently\ngoes on to illustrate in Christmas Eve (1806), a work that\ndepicts in a literary way a sort of ideal interweaving of (Christian)\nreligion with family life.\n\nOne especially important and interesting case to which he applied his\ngeneral insistence on the freedom of religion from state-interference\nwas that of Prussia\u2019s Jews. (Once again, Herder had already set\nan example here\u2014by not only developing a very sympathetic\ninterpretation of ancient Judaism but also forcefully criticizing\nmodern anti-semitism.) In an early work on the subject of Jewish\nemancipation in Prussia, Letters on the Occasion of the\nPolitical-Theological Task and the Open Letter of Jewish\nHouseholders (1799), Schleiermacher argues that Jews should\nreceive full citizenship and civil rights, provided only that they\ncompromise in their religious observances to a point that allows them\nto meet their duties to the state and that they give up such\npolitically threatening commitments as those to a coming messiah and\nto their status as a separate nation. He in particular argues that\nJews should not have to resort to the expedient of baptism as a means\nof achieving citizenship and civil rights (as some (Jewish)\ncontemporaries had proposed), on the grounds that this expedient would\nbe detrimental both to the Jews and their religion themselves and to\nChristianity. In the latter connection his main concern is that it\nwould further water down an already rather watery church. But another\nof his concerns is that it would in effect amount to yet more\ninterference by the state in a religious mystery (baptism). It is\nsignificant to note that Schleiermacher adopts this strikingly liberal\nposition concerning the Jews despite himself being rather critical of\nJudaism as religion: in On Religion he argues that\nReimarus\u2019s conception that there are deep continuities between\nJudaism and Christianity is mistaken, and that although Judaism was a\nbeautiful religion in its day it has long since become corrupted and\nis now effectively moribund (unlike vibrant Christianity).\n\nA further important aspect of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially in its earlier phases, is his feminism (in\nwhich he is again influenced by Herder, who was a pioneer in this\narea, but even more so by Friedrich Schlegel). His feminism has\nseveral sides. First, he encourages women to strive for goods that\nhave traditionally been the monopoly of men. For example, in his short\nIdea for a Catechism of Reason for Noble Ladies, he enjoins\nwomen, \u201cLet yourself covet men\u2019s culture, art, wisdom, and\nhonor\u201d. Second, as a special case of this, he encourages women\nto seek sexual fulfillment, and to free themselves from inhibitions\nabout discussing sex. This is one of the central themes of his\nConfidential Letters Concerning Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s\nLucinde (1800). Third, he identifies women as valuable moral and\nintellectual resources for the benefit and improvement of society as a\nwhole. One example of this lies in their natural aversion to the sorts\nof insensitivity and violence to which men are commonly prone, and\ntheir potential for restraining instead of encouraging or permitting\nthese. In this vein the Idea for a Catechism enjoins women,\n\u201cYou should not bear false witness for men. You should not\nbeautify their barbarism with words and works\u201d. Another (less\nmorally urgent and more localized) example, discussed in Toward a\nTheory of Sociable Conduct, concerns the ability of women, due to\ntheir broad education but their freedom from the narrow confines of\nthe professions, to direct social conversation away from limited\nprofessional concerns toward deeper, and more widely shared ones\n(Schleiermacher is thinking here especially of the hostesses of salons\nof the period that he himself attended). Yet another example can be\nfound in an argument that Schleiermacher develops in his ethics\nlectures to the effect that women are by nature more attuned to\nrecognizing and respecting individuality, whereas men are more attuned\nto recognizing and respecting abstract generalizations, and that\naccordingly one of the key functions of marriage is to bring about a\nvaluable blending of these (equally important) intellectual-moral\nqualities in each partner. (It should be noted, however, that\nSchleiermacher in his later years tended to become more conservative\nin his views about women.)\n\nAt the risk of repetition, it is worth underscoring that in its broad\ncosmopolitan concern for other peoples, Jews, and women\nSchleiermacher\u2019s socio-political philosophy was continuing a\nparadigm that was above all the achievement of a single predecessor:\nHerder.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy, especially prominent in the works from 1799\u20131800, is\na broad critique of some central modern socio-economic institutions\nand a set of proposals for remedying their harmful effects. (The\nSoliloquies casts this critique in the form of an attack on\nthe self-satisfaction of the Enlightenment very reminiscent of\nHerder\u2019s attack on the same in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory (1774).) Three parts of Schleiermacher\u2019s case are\nespecially interesting: First, in Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct he implicitly criticizes modern division of labor on the\ngrounds that it blinkers people, inhibiting their development of their\nown individuality and their sense for the individuality of others. His\nproposed solution here is the development of a sphere of\n\u201csociability\u201d\u2014that is, a sphere of free conversation\nand social intercourse, in which such one-sidedness can be overcome.\nSecond, in On Religion he criticizes the deadeningly\nrepetitive labor that is typical of modern economies as an obstacle to\nspiritual, and in particular religious, self-development. His proposed\nsolution in this case is mainly an expectation that advances in\ntechnology will free people from the sort of labor in question. Third,\nin On Religion and the Soliloquies he criticizes the\nhedonism, utilitarianism, and materialism of the modern age for\npreventing people\u2019s spiritual and religious self-development.\nHis proposed solution here is primarily the sort of revival of a\nvibrant religious and moral life for which On Religion and\nthe Soliloquies plead.\n\nA final noteworthy aspect of Schleiermacher\u2019s socio-political\nphilosophy is his philosophy of education, a subject with which he\nengaged throughout his career. Especially interesting in this regard\nis a work that he published in 1808 in connection with the plans for\nfounding a new university in Berlin (now known as the Humboldt\nUniversity): Occasional Thoughts on Universities in a German\nSpirit, together with an Appendix on One about to be Founded.\nThis work preceded Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s better known pieces on\nthe same topic, which date from 1809\u201310, and evidently had a\nstrong influence on them. Schleiermacher and Humboldt both write in a\nvery liberal and progressive spirit with only modest differences\nbetween their positions. They thereby not only collectively generated\nthe model of the university that Humboldt actually implemented in\nBerlin and which thereby became the main inspiration of the modern\nuniversity tout court, but also developed many principles on the\nsubject that would still repay serious consideration today (for\nexample, Britain could still learn a lot from them). Among the\nprinciples that Schleiermacher developed and which Humboldt took over\nare: a conception that the university should promote not only\nknowledge but also individuality; a principle that this requires the\ngreatest possible independence of the university from the state\n(something that will ultimately also serve the state\u2019s own\ninterests better); a principle that it also requires that there should\nbe as much freedom as possible within the university for both\nfaculty and students; a principle that students should be admitted to\nuniversity regardless of their class background provided only that\nthey are academically qualified; a principle that philosophy should\nreplace theology as the top faculty; a principle of combining research\nwith teaching; and a principle (based on a philosophy of language that\nSchleiermacher shares with Humboldt according to which language is\nfundamental to thought and moreover oral language is more fundamental\nthan written) that the teaching in question should be primarily oral\nin character (for Schleiermacher the lecture, for Humboldt the\nseminar). Indeed, Schleiermacher is in certain ways even more radical\nand progressive than Humboldt in that he, for example, explicitly\ncalls for the university to be run on a democratic model and\ndemands that students from the lower classes not only be admitted to\nuniversity but also receive financial support from the state in order\nto enable them to attend.\n\nSchleiermacher also gave more general lectures on pedagogy, or the\nphilosophy of education, namely, in 1813\u201314, 1820\u20131, and\n1826\u2014among which those from 1826 are most fully developed.\nHowever, by the time he delivered this last cycle of lectures his\nviews had become much more politically conservative and orthodoxly\nChristian, so that the radical edge of his earlier work on the subject\nwas blunted, the interests of the state and the church were now\nassigned greater weight as goals of education, and such principles as\nfreedom in education accordingly underwent heavy qualification.\n11. Philosophy of Religion\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s most radical and important work in the\nphilosophy of religion is On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured\nDespisers from 1799. (Later editions of this work, and his later\ntheological treatise The Christian Faith, strive for greater\nChristian orthodoxy, and are consequently as a rule less interesting\nfrom a philosophical point of view.)\n\nAs its title implies, the project of On Religion is to save\nreligion from the contempt of enlightenment and especially romantic\nskeptics about religion, \u201cits cultured despisers\u201d. At\nleast where the romantics were concerned, the work was strikingly\nsuccessful in this regard, in that several of them, especially\nFriedrich Schlegel, did turn to religion following the book\u2019s\npublication (though admittedly not to quite the sort of religion that\nSchleiermacher had envisaged). Schleiermacher\u2019s later philosophy\nof religion has a similar motivation. In his 1829 open letters to\nL\u00fccke he especially emphasizes the pressing need to defend\nreligion against the twin threats posed to it by modern natural\nscience and modern historical-philological scholarship.\n\nThis project of defending religion against educated skeptics is\nreminiscent of Kant\u2019s similarly motivated critical philosophy.\nSchleiermacher is also sympathetic to Kant\u2019s general strategy in\nconnection with religious matters of \u201cdeny[ing] knowledge in\norder to make room for faith\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason,\nBxxx), and in particular to Kant\u2019s attack on the traditional\nproofs of the existence of God; Schleiermacher himself denies that\nreligion is a form of knowledge or can be based on metaphysics or\nscience. However, as can already be seen from his early unpublished\nessays On the Highest Good (1789) and On What Gives Value\nto Life (1792\u20133), Schleiermacher\u2019s approach is in\nother respects defined more by opposition to than by agreement with\nKant\u2019s. In particular, Schleiermacher sharply rejects\nKant\u2019s alternative moral proof of an otherworldly God\nand human immortality (i.e., Kant\u2019s proof of these by showing\nthem to be necessary presuppositions of morality); for Schleiermacher\nreligion can no more be based on morality than on metaphysics or\nscience.\n\nAs this stance already suggests, Schleiermacher has considerable\nsympathy with the skeptics about religion whom he means to answer.\nBut, at least in his early period, his sympathy with them also goes\nmuch deeper than that. In On Religion he is skeptical about\nthe ideas of God and human immortality altogether, arguing that the\nformer is merely optional (to be included in one\u2019s religion or\nnot depending on the nature of one\u2019s imagination), and that the\nlatter is downright unacceptable. Moreover, he diagnoses the modern\nprevalence of such religious ideas in terms of the deadening influence\nthat is exerted by modern bourgeois society and state-interference on\nreligion. He reconciles this rather startling concession to the\nskeptics with his ultimate goal of defending religion by claiming that\nsuch ideas are inessential to religion. This position strikingly\nanticipates such later radical religious positions as Fritz\nMauthner\u2019s \u201cgodless mysticism\u201d.\n(Schleiermacher\u2019s own later religious thought tended to\nbacktrack on this radicalism, however, restoring God and even human\nimmortality to a central place in religion.)\n\nThis naturally leaves one wondering what the content and the\nepistemological basis of religion are for the early\nSchleiermacher. As can already be seen from the 1793\u20134 essays\nSpinozism and Brief Presentation of the Spinozistic\nSystem, and then again from On Religion, he follows\nSpinoza in believing in a monistic principle that encompasses\neverything, a \u201cone and all\u201d. However, he also modifies\nSpinoza\u2019s conception in certain ways\u2014partly under the\ninfluence of Herder (whom he mentions by name in the essays on\nSpinoza). In particular, whereas Spinoza had conceived his monistic\nprinciple as a substance, Schleiermacher follows Herder in thinking of\nit rather as an original force and as the unifying source of a\nmultiplicity of more mundane forces. (Later on Schleiermacher\ndistanced himself from this neo-Spinozistic position. Indeed, he\nexplicitly denied that he was a follower of Spinoza. Accordingly, in\nthe dialectics lectures he argued that there was an even higher\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d beyond the Spinozist\nnatura naturans or the Herderian highest force. His main\nmotive behind this change of position seems to have been a desire to\navoid the heavily charged accusations of Spinozism and\npantheism\u2014which is not an impressive motive philosophically\nspeaking.)\n\nSo much for the early Schleiermacher\u2019s conception of the content\nof religion. What about its epistemological basis? As was mentioned,\nfor Schleiermacher religion is founded neither on theoretical\nknowledge nor on morality. According to On Religion, it is\ninstead based on an intuition or feeling of the universe:\n\u201cReligion\u2019s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but\nintuition and feeling. It wishes to intuit the universe\u201d\n(OR Second Speech: 22).\n\nThe term \u201cintuition\u201d here is both revealing and\nproblematic. As Kant had defined it, \u201cintuition is that\nthrough which [a mode of knowledge] is in immediate relation to\n[objects]\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason, A19). So part of\nwhat Schleiermacher means to convey here is evidently some sort of\nimmediate cognitive relation to some sort of object, namely, the\nuniverse as a single whole. On the other hand, the term\n\u201cintuition\u201d also imported certain implications that\nSchleiermacher in fact wanted to avoid. In particular, Kantian\nintuition, whether pure or empirical, required the addition of\nconcepts in order to constitute any sort of real insight\n(\u201cintuitions without concepts are\nblind\u201d\u2014Critique of Pure Reason, A51), whereas\nSchleiermacher had in mind a sort of insight that is unmediated by\nconcepts. In the later editions of On Religion he therefore\nretreated from speaking of \u201cintuition\u201d in connection with\nreligion (instead reserving this term for science), and instead spoke\nsimply of \u201cfeeling\u201d. In accordance with this change,\nThe Christian Faith went on to define religion more\nspecifically as a feeling of absolute dependence, or what\nSchleiermacher also described in his open letters to L\u00fccke as the\nimmediate consciousness of \u201can immediate\nexistence-relationship\u201d.\n\nA further aspect of the \u201cfeeling\u201d on which Schleiermacher\nbases religion should also be mentioned: its inclusion of\nmotivating force, its self-manifestation in actions.\nThe wish to include this aspect was one of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nreasons for supplementing religious \u201cintuition\u201d with\n\u201cfeeling\u201d even in the first edition of On\nReligion. And his later work emphasizes this dimension of\nreligious \u201cfeeling\u201d as well.\n\nThis whole epistemological position looks suspiciously like\nphilosophical sleight-of-hand, however. \u201cFeelings\u201d can be\nof at least two very different sorts: on the one hand, non-cognitive\n\u201cfeelings\u201d, such as physical pains and pleasures; on the\nother hand, \u201cfeelings\u201d that incorporate beliefs, for\nexample, a feeling that such and such is the case. Whereas the\npossession and awareness of non-cognitive feelings such as pains and\npleasures may indeed be conceptually unmediated, beyond the reach of\nreasons for or against, and hence in a sense infallible, the\npossession and awareness of feelings that incorporate beliefs, for\ninstance, the feeling that such and such is the case, does require\nconceptual mediation, is subject to reasoning for or against, and is\nfallible. As can be seen from the neo-Spinozistic content that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s religious intuition or feeling was originally\nsupposed to have, his original characterization of it as an intuition\nin the Kantian sense of an immediate cognitive relation to an object,\nhis later characterization of it as representing \u201can immediate\nexistence-relationship\u201d, and so on, he does not mean religious\nfeeling to be merely non-cognitive, but rather to incorporate some\nsort of belief. However, he also helps himself to the apparent\nepistemological advantages that belong only to non-cognitive feelings:\nnon-mediation by concepts, transcendence of reasons for or against,\nand infallibility. In short, it looks as though his epistemological\ngrounding of religion in \u201cfeeling\u201d depends on a systematic\nconfusion of these two crucially different sorts of cases.\n\nTurning more briefly to some additional features of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of religion in On Religion:\nHe recognizes the validity of a potentially endless multiplicity of\nforms of religion there, and strongly advocates religious toleration.\nHowever, he also arranges the various types of religion in a\nhierarchy, with animism at the bottom, polytheism in the middle, and\nmonotheism or otherwise monistic religions at the top. This hierarchy\nis understandable given his fundamental neo-Spinozism.\n\nMore internally problematic, though, is a further elaboration of this\nhierarchy that he introduces: he identifies Christianity as the\nhighest among the monotheistic or monistic religions, and in\nparticular as higher than Judaism. His rationale for this is that\nChristianity introduces \u201cthe idea that everything finite\nrequires higher mediation in order to be connected with the\ndivine\u201d (i.e., the higher mediation of Christ)\n(OR Fifth Speech: 120). However, this looks\ncontrived. For one thing, it is left unclear why \u201chigher\nmediation\u201d is supposed to be a good thing. Moreover, even if one\nwere to grant that it is, why do other monotheistic religions such as\nJudaism not share in this putative advantage as well, namely, in the\nform of their prophets? And if the answer is that this is because\nprophets are not themselves divine, then why is the mediator\u2019s\ndivinity supposed to be such a great advantage?\n\nIn addition, Schleiermacher remarks insightfully on the distinctively\npolemical nature of Christianity, the striking extent to\nwhich Christianity\u2019s religious and moral standpoint is defined\nby a hostile opposition to other standpoints, and even to dissenting\npositions within Christianity itself. This observation recalls that of\nanother well-informed and honest Christian, Montaigne, who had noted\nin his Apology for Raymond Sebond (1580) that \u201cthere is\nno hostility quite as perfect as Christian hostility\u201d. And it is\namply borne out by the historical evidence\u2014for example, the\nbloody early history of Christianity, the Crusades, the\nInquisition\u2019s treatment of Jews and witches, the Wars of\nReligion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many\nother, similar horrors (all of which only stopped, or at least\ndiminished, when Christianity was rendered politically impotent by the\nEnlightenment and the American and French Revolutions in the\neighteenth century). Moreover, this striking feature of Christianity\nhas since received deeper explanations\u2014including Jan\nAssman\u2019s observation that unlike most other religions\nJudeo-Christian-Muslim religion was from the start a sort of\n\u201canti-religion [Gegenreligion]\u201d, defined by its\nopposition to other religions and cultures, and Nietzsche\u2019s\nobservation that Christianity and its morality in particular were from\nthe beginning a reaction against Greek and Roman culture motivated by\nresentment against Greek and Roman imperial oppression in Palestine\nand elsewhere, so that, for example, the Greeks\u2019 most general\nword for a god, daim\u00f4n, became the Christian concept of\na demon, and Christian moral values performed a systematic\ninversion of traditional Greek and Roman values. So\nSchleiermacher\u2019s observation is an insightful one. But then how\ncan a proponent of religious pluralism and toleration like\nSchleiermacher consistently see this striking trait of Christianity as\nanything but a serious vice?\n\nOn the (flimsy) basis of his perception of Christianity\u2019s\nsuperiority as a religion, Schleiermacher also tries to reconcile his\nneo-Spinozism with traditional Christian doctrines as far as possible.\nThis project already begins in a modest way in On Religion,\nwhere, for example, he tries to salvage the Christian doctrine of\nmiracles in the modified form of a doctrine that classifies\nall events as miracles (insofar as viewed from a religious\nperspective). A similar project is pursued more elaborately (and\ntediously) in The Christian Faith.\n\nFinally, a more fruitful contribution of Schleiermacher\u2019s to the\nstudy of Christianity was the series of lectures on the life of Jesus\nthat\u2014under the influence of two late works of Herder\u2019s:\nOn the Savior of Mankind according to our First Three Gospels\n(1796) and On God\u2019s Son, the World\u2019s Savior, according\nto John\u2019s Gospel (1797)\u2014he began to deliver in 1819\nand which were published posthumously as The Life of Jesus.\nSchleiermacher tried in these lectures to combine an interpretation of\nJesus as a mere human being with a claim that his extraordinary level\nof awareness of God nonetheless amounted to a sort of presence of God\nin him. This compromise was strained and implausible. But\nSchleiermacher\u2019s project nonetheless constituted an important\nfirst step toward much more consistently naturalistic and plausible\ntreatments of the life of Jesus by subsequent scholars, especially\nDavid Friedrich Strauss\u2019s The Life of Jesus, Critically\nExamined (1835\u20136).\nGuide to the Literature\nLife and Works\n\nArndt 2013; Berner 1995; Dilthey [1870] 1966\u20131970; Haym [1870]\n1920 (ch. 3); Mari\u00f1a 2005; Redeker 1973; Scholtz 1984.\nPhilosophy of Language\n\nCoseriu 2015 (vol. 2, ch. 8) (a detailed, helpful treatment); Forster\n2011b, 2014; Gipper and Schmitter 1985 (92\u201398) (an excellent\nbook on this as well as other subjects).\nPhilosophy of Mind\n\nCoseriu 2015 (vol. 2, ch. 8) (Coseriu pays close attention to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s lectures on psychology); Sigwart 1857.\nHermeneutics (i.e., Theory of Interpretation)\n\nArndt 2013; Berner 1995; Boeckh 1877; Bowie 1997; Dilthey 1860, 1900;\nForster 2010b, 2011c; Frank 1985, 1990 (these two books, especially\nthe former of them, are arguably the most important secondary\nliterature on Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics available); Gadamer\n[1960] 2002 (part 2) (a decidedly hostile but nonetheless important\ntreatment of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics); Hirsch 1967 (a\nsignificant Anglophone appropriation of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics); Kimmerle 1957 (an important and influential\ncontribution that counteracts Dilthey\u2019s overemphasis of the\npsychological, as opposed to linguistic, side of interpretation in\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics); Palmer 1969 (ch. 7) (helpful on\nSchleiermacher as well as on other figures); Patsch 1966 (a learned\nand important article that discusses Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics in relation to Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s); Ricoeur 1973,\n1977 (helpful though dull); Szondi [1970] 1986 (like most of\nSzondi\u2019s writings, thoughtful and helpful); Wach 1926\u20131933\n(learned and informative, though not exciting).
