    "main_text": "Group Testimony\n6. Group Testimony\n\nWhile much attention has been paid to issues surrounding\nindividual testimony, i.e., cases in which one speaker tells\nsomeone that p is true, recently epistemologists have started\nexploring a number of related questions regarding group\ntestimony, i.e., cases in which a group testifies to someone that\np is true. Here is one case that motivates this line of\nresearch.\n\n\nPopulation Commission: Consider the UN Population\nCommission that was established by the Economic and Social Council of\nthe United Nations in 1946. The Commission was designed to assist the\ncouncil by arranging studies and advising the council on population\nissues, trends, developments, policies, and so on. It is also charged\nwith monitoring the implementation of policies designed by the United\nNations to regulate population and to provide recommendations to the\ncouncil and United Nations as a whole. The commission is composed of\n47 members with a representative from almost every country in the\nUnited Nations. In 2002, the Commission released a report entitled\nCharting the Progress of Populations that provides information on 12\nsocio-economic indicators, including total population, maternal\nmortality, infant mortality, and so on. (Tollefsen 2007:\n300\u2013301)\n\n\nThere are three things to notice here. First, consider a particular\nclaim in the Charting the Progress of Populations report. For\ninstance, let p be the claim that\n\n\nWhile the population in North America has risen, the population in\nCentral America has stayed the same, and the population in South\nAmerica has declined.\n\n\nAt the time the report was released, no single member of the UN\nPopulation committee believed p. That is, none of the committee\nmembers were aware that p was true until the report was\nreleased and they read it for themselves.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, before the report was released, none of the\ncommittee members had any evidence, or justification, for believing\np. That is, while some members might have justifiably believed\nthat the population in North America was on the rise, and while others\nmight have justifiably believed that the population in South America\nwas on the decline, and while others still might have justifiably\nbelieved that the population in Central America had stayed the same,\ngiven the way in which the labor was divided amongst the researchers,\ni.e., given that none of them had communicated their findings with one\nanother, nobody had justification for thinking that p itself\nwas true until after the report came out.\n\nThird, and finally, the UN Commission did seem to testify that\np, i.e., their report did contain the group\u2019s testimony\nabout the population changes in the Americas.\n\n(Of course, this is not the only case that motivates the need for an\nepistemology of group testimony. Wikipedia, for instance,\npresents a number of interesting questions about what it would take\nfor a group to testify, and when and why we should accept what a group\nsays. See, e.g., Tollefsen 2009; Wray 2009; and Fallis 2008. Cases\ninvolving testimony from scientific groups also raise similar issues.\nSee, e.g., Hardwig 1985 and Faulkner 2018).\n\nCases like this give rise to at least five important questions. First,\nconsider\n\n\nHow should we understand the relationship between a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p and the testimony of the group\u2019s\nindividual members?\n\n\nOn the one hand, Summativists maintain that a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p should be understood in terms of the testimony\nof some (or most, or all) of its members. On the other hand,\nNon-Summativists maintain that it is possible for a group to\ntestify that p even if none of its members do. (See Tollefsen\n(2007) and Lackey (2014) for a defense of different Non-Summative\npositions).\n\nRelatedly, Deflationists maintain to a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p can be reduced to some individual\u2019s\ntestimony that p (regardless of whether those individuals are\nmembers of the group, or just mere spokesmen), whereas\nInflationists maintain that a group itself can be a\ntestifier. (See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of the latter, and see\nLackey\u2019s (2014) for a deflationary account of the epistemology\nof group testimony and her (2018a) for an inflationary account of the\nnature of group assertion).\n\nSecond, consider\n\n\nUnder what conditions is a hearer justified in believing a\ngroup\u2019s testimony that p?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the\nReductionist/Anti-reductionist debate about individual testimony in\n Section 1.\n See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of a reductionist view.\n\nThird, consider\n\n\nIf you are justified in believing that p on the basis of a\ngroup\u2019s testimony, is your belief justified by\nevidence?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony discussed in\n Section 3.\n For instance, suppose that you are justified in believing that\np on the basis of a group\u2019s testimony that p.\nMiranda Fricker (2012) defends an Assurance View according to which\nyour belief is justified by the group\u2019s assurance that p\n(but see Faulkner (2018) for a criticism of this view). Lackey (2014)\ndefends a reliabilist account according to which your belief is\njustified by the reliability (or truth conduciveness) of the\ngroup\u2019s statement that p (but see Faulkner (2018) for a\ncriticism of this view too). Finally, Faulkner (2018) defends a\nqualified Inheritance View according to which your belief that\np can be justified by the justification that the group has (or\nat least has access to).\n\nFourth, consider,\n\n\nCan group testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit\nit?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony in\n Section 2.\n On the one hand, Faulkner (2018) defends a qualified Transmission\nView according to which you can only acquire testimonial knowledge and\njustification from a group\u2019s testimony that p if that\ngroup has, or at least has access to, a body of justification\nthat supports p. On the other hand, Lackey (2014) defends a\nview that is compatible with a group\u2019s testimony generating\nknowledge and justification.\n\nFifth, and finally, consider,\n\n\nWhat, if anything, does a group\u2019s testimony that p\nentail about that group\u2019s knowledge (and thus belief) that\np?\n\n\nMore specifically, suppose that a group testifies that p and\nthat you come to know that p on this basis. Does the fact that\nyou acquired testimonial knowledge in this case entail that groups\nthemselves can be knowers (and thus believers)?\n\nOn the one hand, John Hardwig (1985) argues for a positive answer\nhere. That is, Hardwig argues that if we acknowledge that groups can\ntestify, we should also acknowledge that groups themselves can be\nknowers, and thus believers too (see also Lackey (2016) for an\nargument to the effect that groups can possess justified beliefs). On\nthe other hand, Faulkner (2018) argues against this line of thought\nand suggests that even if groups can testify, this does not entail\nthat they possess any mental states.\n\nOf course, there is much more work that can, and should, be done about\nthe epistemological significance of receiving testimony from\ngroups.\n",
