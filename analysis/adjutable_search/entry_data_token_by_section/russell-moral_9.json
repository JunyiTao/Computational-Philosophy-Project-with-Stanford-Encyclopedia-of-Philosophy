    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || The Problem of the Disappearing Dispute\n8.2 The Problem of the Disappearing Dispute\n\nIf judgments about what is good or bad in itself merely express\napproval and disapproval, then \u201cX is good\u201d said by\nme and \u201cX is bad\u201d said by you do not contradict\none another. After all, I am merely expressing my feelings whilst you\nare expressing yours, and there is nothing remotely inconsistent about\nthe supposition that X arouses approval in me and disapproval\nin you. But plainly when I call X good and you call it bad we\nare contradicting one other. Hence emotivism, which seems to\nimply otherwise, is false.\n\nAgain, Russell\u2019s brand of emotivism is immune to this objection.\nAccording to Russell, \u201cX is good\u201d and\n\u201cX is bad\u201d are really in the optative mood despite\ntheir indicative appearances. As such, they express desires or wishes,\nand desires and wishes can, in a sense, be inconsistent with one\nother, namely when they are not (in Russell\u2019s phrase)\n\u201ccompossible\u201d, that is, when they cannot both be realized.\n\u201cWould that I had all the ice-cream!\u201d said by me and\n\u201cWould that I had all the ice-cream!\u201d said by you\nexpress contradictory desires since we cannot both have all the\nice-cream. As such, the two optatives contradict each other, not\nbecause they describe incompatible facts but because\nthey prescribe incompatible states of affairs.\nSimilarly \u201cX is good\u201d said by me and\n\u201cX is bad\u201d said by you express contradictory\ndesires and hence contradict each other. For \u201cX is\ngood\u201d means \u201cWould that everybody desired X!\u201d\nand \u201cX is bad\u201d means \u201cWould that everybody\ndesired that not-X!\u201d, and the desires expressed by these\ntwo optatives are not compossible, or at least, are only compossible\non the condition that we all have inconsistent desires (both for\nX and for not-X).\n\nBut the situation is a little different when we come to judgments\nabout what is right or what ought to be done. As we\nhave seen, Russell is inclined to give such judgments a\nconsequentialist reading and then to index them to some presumed set\nof projects. It is therefore true with respect to, say,\nRussell and myself that we ought to abolish the Death Penalty, since\nabolishing the Death Penalty is conducive to the ends that we happen\nto favor. But it is equally true with respect to some hardcore\nretributivist that we ought not to abolish the Death penalty,\nsince it is not conducive to the eye-for-an-eye ends that\nshe considers good. And this seems to be a problem. For when\nRussell and I say we ought to abolish the Death Penalty and\nthe retributivist says we that we ought not, it seems that we\nare contradicting each other. Yet if the two \u201coughts\u201d are\nindexed to different visions of the good, it seems they are quite\ncompatible. What Russell and I are saying is that abolishing the Death\nPenalty can be rationally expected to maximize the things we\nconsider good and to minimize the things that we consider\nevil. What the retributivist is saying (if she is a consequentialist)\nis that not abolishing the Death Penalty can be rationally\nexpected to maximize the things she considers good (which\ninclude retributive punishment) and to minimize the things\nshe considers evil (such as murderers not getting their just\ndeserts). And these claims can both be true. Hence Russell\u2019s theory\nbrings about a spurious appearance of semantic harmony where in fact\nthere is conflict and contradiction. His theory suggests that the\nfriends and foes of the Death Penalty are not contradicting\neach other, when in fact it is evident that they are. Genuine\ndisagreement would only be possible between those who agreed about the\nends but disagreed about the means. Thus if (in 1940) Hitler claimed\nthat the Luftwaffe ought to bomb London rather than the RAF airfields\nwhilst Goering claimed that the Luftwaffe ought to bomb the RAF\nairfields rather than bombing London, the two would be in\ncontradiction since their ends were presumably the same. But their\nviews would be quite compatible with those of a pacifist who claimed\nthat nobody ought ever to bomb anything!\n\nRussell himself had raised much the same objection against relativist\ndefinitions of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d in 1912:\n\n\nIf in asserting that A is good, X meant merely to assert\nthat A had a certain relation to himself such as pleasing his\ntaste in some way [or being conducive his ends] and Y, in\nsaying that A is not good, meant merely to deny that A\nhad a like relation to himself; then there would be no subject of\ndebate between them. (Philosophical Essays:\n20\u201321/Papers 6: 222)\n\n\nBut, as Russell plainly believes, there is a subject of\ndebate between them, which means that relativistic readings of\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d must (at least sometimes) be\nwrong. A similar problem afflicts his own subsequent analyses of\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cright\u201d. Since their\n\u201coughts\u201d are indexed to different ends, it seems that when\nthe Nazi says \u201cWe ought to bomb London\u201d and the pacifist\nsays \u201cNobody ever ought to bomb anything\u201d they are not\ncontradicting one another, though it is as clear as daylight that they\nare.\n\nRussell might reply that his suggestion is not intended as an\naccount of what \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d actually mean, but as proposal\nabout what they ought to mean. His theory is not intended as\na description of our current semantic slum, but as a scheme\nfor linguistic reform. It may be that at present we\ntake those whose \u201coughts\u201d are indexed to different ends to\nbe contradicting one other but Russell is hoping to change all that.\nGiven current usage, when Hitler says \u201cWe ought to bomb\nLondon\u201d and the pacifist says \u201cNobody ever ought to bomb\nanything\u201d, the two claims contradict each other, but once\nRussell\u2019s reform is has been implemented this disagreeable dispute\nwill be smoothed into non-existence.\n\nThe problem with this is that Russell\u2019s \u201cproposal\u201d is not\na very attractive one. One of the things we want to do with\nmoral language is express our disagreements. Russell\u2019s new-fangled\n\u201cought\u201d would be unable fulfill one of the most important\nlinguistic functions of the old-fashioned \u201cought\u201d, namely\nto express that fact that people with different ends disagree (as we\nwould now put it) on what ought to be done. In depriving\npeople with different ends of the means to contradict each other\nRussell would be doing them a disservice. Moreover, Russell would be\nleft with a peculiarly ramshackle meta-ethic. He would have a\ndescriptive account of what \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d\ndo mean and a prescriptive suggestion about the\nabout what \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d ought to mean. There is no actual\ninconsistency in this but it does seem to be a bit anomalous. If the\nname of the game is to analyze the moral concepts, then it\nseems Russell\u2019s analysis of \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d is wrong. But if the name of the game is to\nreform the moral concepts, then why not subject\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d to the same treatment, giving\nthem the kind objectivity that Russell would evidently have preferred\nthem to have?\n",
