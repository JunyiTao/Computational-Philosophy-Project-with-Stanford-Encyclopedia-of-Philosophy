    "main_text": "Gods and Rituals || Daoist Heavens\n5.1 Daoist Heavens\n\nDaoism represents the celestial realm as different systems of\n\u201cheavens\u201d, usually arranged hierarchically. In several\ncases, these domains are not only the residences of deities, but also\ncorrespond to degrees of priestly ordination and to inner spiritual\nstates, and are associated with revelations of teachings and textual\ncorpora. The existence of multiple systems reflects the development of\nthe religion. Different traditions created their own systems in order\nto demonstrate that the respective methods derive from a superior\ncelestial domain compared to those of other traditions, and therefore\nare more effective or grant access to a higher spiritual state.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens of Lingbao are arranged horizontally, with each\nheaven occupying one sector of an imaginary circle. At their center is\nthe Grand Veil (Daluo), the highest celestial domain. The\nlanguage spoken in these heavens is based on sounds represented in a\nform of pseudo-Sanskrit called Secret Language of the Great\nBrahm\u0101 (Bokenkamp 1997: 385\u201389). The thirty-six heavens of\nShangqing, instead, are arranged vertically. This system was created\nafter the Lingbao model and draws in part from it. In one of several\nlists, the highest heaven is again the Grand Veil. Below it are the\nheavens of the Three Clarities, followed by the four heavens of the\n\u201cSeed People\u201d (zhongmin, who survive beyond the end\nof the present cosmic cycle) and further below by the four heavens of\nFormlessness, the eighteen of Form, and the six of Desire.\n\nAs mentioned above\n (\u00a73.4),\n the Three Clarities (Sanqing) reflect the systematization of\nDaoist traditions after the Shangqing and Lingbao revelations. The\nterm itself defines both the three highest deities and the heavens in\nwhich they reside. While this became the classic Daoist model of the\ncelestial realms, it could be modified in several ways. Different\nsystems were devised in later times; these include the Shenxiao\ncosmography, which places the eponymous Divine Empyrean\n(shenxiao) at the center of nine celestial realms (Boltz\n1987: 26\u201333; Despeux 2000: 513).\n",
