    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || The Paradox of Constitution\n2.4 The Paradox of Constitution\n\nSuppose that on day 1 Jones purchases a piece of clay \\(c\\) and\nfashions it into a statue \\(s_1.\\) On day 2, Jones destroys \\(s_1\\),\nbut not \\(c\\), by squeezing \\(s_1\\) into a ball and fashions a new\nstatue \\(s_2\\) out of \\(c\\). On day 3, Jones removes a part of\n\\(s_2\\), discards it, and replaces it using a new piece of clay,\nthereby destroying \\(c\\) and replacing it by a new piece of clay,\n\\(c'\\). Presumably, \\(s_2\\) survives this change. Now what is the\nrelationship between the pieces of clay and the statues they\n\u201cconstitute\u201d? A natural answer is: identity. On day \\(1,\nc\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\) and on day \\(2, c\\) is identical to\n\\(s_2\\). On day \\(3, s_2\\) is identical to \\(c'\\). But this conclusion\ndirectly contradicts NI. If, on day \\(1, c\\) is (identical to)\n\\(s_1\\), then it follows, given NI, that on day \\(2, s_1\\) is \\(s_2\\)\n(since \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_2\\) on day 2) and hence that \\(s_1\\)\nexists on day 2, which it does not. By a similar argument, on day \\(3,\nc\\) is \\(c'\\) (since \\(s_2\\) is identical to both) and so \\(c\\) exists\non day 3, which it does not. We might conclude, then, that either\nconstitution is not identity or that NI is false. Neither conclusion\nis wholly welcome. Once we adopt the standard account less NI, the\nlatter principle follows directly from the assumption that individual\nvariables and constants in quantified modal logic are to be handled\nexactly as they are in first-order logic. And if constitution is not\nidentity, and yet statues, as well as pieces of clay, are physical\nobjects (and what else would they be?), then we are again forced to\naffirm that distinct physical objects may occupy (exactly) the same\nspace at the same time. The statue \\(s_1\\) and the piece of clay \\(c\\)\noccupy the same space on day 1. Even if this is deemed possible\n(Wiggins 1980), it is unparsimonious. The standard account is thus\nprima facie incompatible with the natural idea that\nconstitution is identity.\n\nPhilosophers have not argued by direct appeal to NI or ND. Typically\n(e.g., Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1993, Johnston 1992), arguments that \\(c\\)\nand \\(s_1\\) are not identical run as follows: \\(c\\) exists prior to\nthe existence of \\(s_1\\) and hence the two are not identical. Again,\n\\(s_1\\) possesses the property of being such that it will be destroyed\nby being squeezed into a ball, but \\(c\\) does not possess this\nproperty \\((c\\) will be squeezed into a ball but it will not thereby\nbe destroyed). So again the two are not identical. Further, whatever\nthe future in fact brings, c might have been squeezed into a\nball and not destroyed. Since that is not true of \\(s_1\\), the two are\nnot identical. On a careful analysis, however, each of these arguments\ncan be seen to rely on NI or ND, provided one adopts the standard\naccount of modal/temporal predicates. This last proviso suggests\nan interesting way out for one who adheres to the standard account of\nidentity but who also holds that constitution is identity (see\nbelow).\n\nSome philosophers find it important or at least expedient to frame the\nissue in terms of the case of a statue \\(s\\) and piece of clay \\(c\\)\nthat coincide throughout their entire existence. We bring both \\(c\\)\nand \\(s\\) into existence by joining two other pieces of clay together,\nor we do something else that guarantees total coincidence. It seems\nthat total coincidence is supposed to lend plausibility to the claim\nthat, in such a case at least, constitution is identity (and hence NI\nis false\u2014Gibbard 1975). It may do so, psychologically, but not\nlogically. The same sorts of arguments as against the thesis that\nconstitution is identity apply in such a case. For example, \\(s\\) may\nbe admired for its aesthetic traits, even long after it ceases to\nexist, but this need not be true of \\(c\\). And \\(s\\) has the property,\nwhich \\(c\\) lacks, of being destroyed if squeezed into a ball. Those\nwho defend the thesis that constitution is identity need to defend it\nin the general case of partial coincidence; and those who attack the\nthesis do so with arguments that work equal well against both total\nand partial coincidence. The assumption that \\(s\\) and \\(c\\) are\ntotally coincident is therefore inessential.\n\nThe doctrine of temporal parts offers only limited help. The statement\nthat \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\) on day 1 but identical to \\(s_2\\)\non day 2 can be construed to mean that \\(c\\) is a temporally extended\nobject whose day 1 stage is identical to \\(s_1\\) and whose day 2 stage\nis identical to \\(s_2\\). Since the two stages are not identical, NI\ndoes not apply. Similarly, we can regard \\(s_2\\) as a temporally\nextended object that overlaps \\(c\\) on day 2 and \\(c'\\) on day 3. But\nunless temporal parts theorists are prepared to defend a doctrine of\nmodally extended objects\u2014objects extended through possible\nworlds analogous to objects extended in time\u2014there remains a\nproblem. \\(s_2\\) might have been made of a different piece of\nclay, as is in fact the case on day 3. That is, it is logically\npossible for \\(s_2\\) to fail to coincide with the day 2 stage of\n\\(c\\). But it is not logically possible for the day 2 stage of \\(c\\)\nto fail to coincide with itself.\n\nLewis recognizes this difficulty and proposes to deal with it by\nappealing to his counterpart theory (Lewis 1971, 1986, and 1993).\nDifferent concepts, e.g., statue and piece of clay,\nare associated with different counterpart relations and hence with\ndifferent criteria of trans-world identity. This has the effect of\nrendering modal predicates \u201cAbelardian\u201d (Noonan 1991,\n1993). The property determined by a modal predicate may be affected by\nthe subject term of a sentence containing the predicate. The subject\nterm denotes an object belonging to this or that kind or sort. But\ndifferent kinds or sorts may determine different properties (or\ndifferent counterpart relations). In particular, the properties\ndetermined by the predicate \u201cmight not have coincided with\n\\(c_2\\)\u201d (where \\(c_2\\) names the day 2 stage of \\(c)\\) in the\nfollowing sentences,\n\n\\(s_2\\) might not have coincided with \\(c_2\\),\n\\(c_2\\) might not have coincided with \\(c_2\\),\n\n\nare different, and hence (a) and (b) are compatible, even\nassuming that \\(s_2\\) and \\(c_2\\) are identical. (It should be\nemphasized that counterpart theory is not the only means of obtaining\nAbelardian predicates. See Noonan 1991.)\n\nThe upshot seems to be that the advocate of the standard account of\nidentity must maintain either that constitution is not identity or\nthat modal predicates are Abelardian. The latter option may be the\nfruitful one, since for one thing it seems to have applications that\ngo beyond the issue of constitution.\n",
