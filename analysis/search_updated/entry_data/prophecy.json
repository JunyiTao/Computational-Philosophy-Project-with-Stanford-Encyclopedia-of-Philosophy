    "preamble": "\n\nA prophet is a person who plays a special role mediating the\nrelationship between other people and the divine. Typically, a prophet\nis envisioned as a channel through which God communicates to others\nsome important information that could not have been known to the\nprophet in any ordinary way. Prophecy is interesting from a\nphilosophical point of view for many reasons, including the fact that\nit raises compelling questions about divine knowledge/ communication,\nhuman language, the nature of time, and human freedom. Unlike\ntheologians or apologists, philosophers rarely argue about who has\nactually prophesied what, or whether or not a given prophecy came\ntrue. Instead, they prefer to argue about ideal cases, where the\ntheoretical issues can be more carefully isolated, and historical\nknowledge is not needed. In this article, we will follow their lead by\nsidestepping the question of whether or not any apparent prophecies\nhave actually been fulfilled. We will also avoid the question of the\nexistence of God, which is addressed by a number of other entries in\nthis encyclopedia (see the entries listed in the \n Related Entries section below). \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Philosophical Issues Raised by Prophecy\n\nIt is often assumed that the primary purpose of prophecy is to\nforetell the future, but this is not always the case. In the great\nmonotheistic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam),\nfor instance, a prophet is taken to be a person who makes God\u2019s\nwill particularly clear, whether or not this involves making\npredictions about the future. As William Hasker says, in these\ntraditions, prophets are usually involved in \u201cwitnessing to the\npeople concerning God\u2019s purposes and requirements and seeking to\nrecall them to obedience\u201d (Hasker 1989, 194). There are\nfascinating debates in these religious traditions, especially in the\nmedieval period, debates that we will not discuss here (see Kreisel\n2001, Shatz 1998, Rahman 2011, Lorch 2016, L\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2014,\nand the entries in this encyclopedia concerning the key figures\ndiscussed in those sources). Related questions about how a human\nperson might come to know God\u2019s will through some kind of\nrevelation are also discussed elsewhere in this encyclopedia, for\nexample in the entries on\n the epistemology of religion\n and\n philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nWhen philosophers discuss prophecy, they are typically interested in\nprophecies concerning the contingent future, so that will be the focus\nin the remainder of this article. What special philosophical issues\nare raised by this kind of prophecy?\n\nLet\u2019s say that a future event is contingent if and only if it is\nnot determined that it will happen and also not determined that it\nwill not happen. (For more on the notion of determinism, see the entry\non\n causal determinism.)\n Now suppose that based upon the revelation of an infallible God, a\nperson prophecies that some future contingent event will occur. Since\nGod cannot be wrong, does it follow that the future contingent event\nmust occur? And if it must occur, how can it be a contingent\nevent?\n\nAn especially vivid example of this kind of situation comes from the\nChristian tradition. Jesus reportedly prophesied that his disciple\nPeter would deny him three times before the cock crowed (see Matthew\n26:34). Typically, we would think of Peter\u2019s denial as a free\nact, and hence it is a future contingent event at the time of\nJesus\u2019s prophecy. (For more on this connection, see the entries\non\n compatibilism,\n free will, and\n causal determinism.)\n But since Jesus cannot be mistaken (according to Christian theology),\nhow are Peter\u2019s later denials free? Once Jesus\u2019 words\nbecome part of the unalterable past, don\u2019t they guarantee a\nparticular future, whether or not Peter is willing to cooperate?\n\nThis problem is an especially interesting instance of the more general\nproblem of the compatibility of God\u2019s complete foreknowledge\nwith the existence of future contingent events (for more on this\ngeneral problem, see the entry on\n divine foreknowledge and human freedom).\n Whereas the more general question about God\u2019s foreknowledge\ntypically involves just God\u2019s knowledge and the future\ncontingent event, the problem of prophecy involves a third element,\nnamely, the prophecy itself, which becomes a part of the past history\nof the world as soon as it is made. This additional element adds an\ninteresting twist to the general problem, making it more difficult to\nsolve.\n2. Denying Contingency\n\nPhilosophers have responded to this problem in several different ways.\nOne obvious way to respond is simply to claim that there are no future\ncontingent events, despite appearances to the contrary. Different\npeople have taken this approach for different reasons. Some are\nattracted to the idea that every event has a prior sufficient cause\n(see the entry on\n causal determinism).\n Others believe that the idea of free choice does not require anything\nlike real contingency or the possibility of doing or intending\notherwise (see the entries on\n compatibilism\n and\n free will).\n Still others believe that God\u2019s providential control over the\nworld is so thorough and detailed that nothing is left to chance, not\neven the apparently free choices of human beings (see Calvin 1536,\nCarson 1981, Feinberg 1986, Furlong 2019, and White 2019, along with\nthe entry on\n divine providence).\n So one possible response to the difficulty here is to give up one\nhalf of the problem by denying that there are any future contingent\nevents in the first place. To return to our example from the Christian\ntradition, when Jesus truly prophecies that Peter will deny him three\ntimes before the cock crows, there is no philosophical puzzle as long\nas we do not claim that Peter\u2019s denials are contingent\nevents.\n\nMany philosophers and theologians do not find this approach very\npromising, though, because they believe strongly in future contingent\nevents, especially human free choices. How else might one respond to\nthe problem posed by prophecies concerning future contingent\nevents?\n3. Denying God\u2019s Foreknowledge\n\nAnother way of trying to solve the puzzle is to deny that God has\nknowledge of the contingent future. According to this approach, often\ncalled \u201copen theism\u201d, there may be future contingent\nevents, but God does not know about them. God does not know about them\neither because (1) there are no true propositions now that report what\nfuture contingent events will occur, or because (2) it is impossible\nfor anyone, including God, to know such true propositions, or because\n(3) God chooses not to know them in order to preserve our freedom\n(see, e.g., Swinburne 1986, chapter 10). Open theists also typically\nargue that foreknowledge alone would be providentially useless to God\n(see Hasker 1989, for instance; for more on open theism, see Hasker\n1989 and 2004, Basinger and Basinger 1986, Basinger 1994, Pinnock\n1986, Pinnock et al 1994, Rice 1985, and Davison 1991 and 2003). How\ncan open theism explain prophecies that appear to make reference to\nfuture contingent events?\n\nWilliam Hasker, perhaps the most prominent advocate of open theism,\naddresses this problem explicitly, and suggests a three-fold response.\nFirst, he points out that the main function of prophecy is not to\nforetell the future, but to reveal God\u2019s will (Hasker 1989,\n194). Many prophecies, in fact, have a conditional character, such as\n\u201cIf a nation does not do such and such, then it will be\ndestroyed\u201d (see Jeremiah 18:7\u201310, for example). Second,\nmany prophetic predictions are based upon existing trends and\ntendencies, which provide God with enough evidence to foresee the\nfuture (Hasker 1989, 195). (Hasker places Jesus\u2019 prediction\nabout Peter in this category, by the way.) Finally, some prophecies\nsimply reveal what God has already decided to bring about in the\nfuture (Hasker 1989, 195). Since God\u2019s own actions in the future\nare up to God, it is possible for God to know about them even though\nthey are contingent, so it is possible for prophecies to reveal\nthem.\n\nThomas P. Flint argues that Hasker\u2019s attempt to solve the\nproblem of prophecy from within the constraints imposed by open theism\nis inadequate. Flint argues that if people are truly free in a sense\nthat implies future contingency, then not even God could know very\nmuch about the future based upon present trends and tendencies alone.\nThis is because the probability of a particular future contingent\nevent is very low (when it is identified in some detail), so low that\nGod would not have much justification for believing that it would\noccur specifically (see Flint 1998, 102\u20135). As an example, Flint\npoints to John 6:64, which seems to imply that Jesus knew that Judas\nwould betray him. How could this be, Flint wonders, when the\nprobability that Judas would betray Jesus was so low? He also points\nout that Hasker faces a dilemma here that other open theists share,\nnamely, that if they insist that the probabilities of future\ncontingent events are high enough to justify God in making predictions\nabout the future, then God actually doesn\u2019t take much of a risk\nin creating the world. This is problematic for some open theists, who\nclaim that their view has the virtue that God takes certain risks in\ncreating the world; see Flint 1998, 104\u20136.)\n\nWe will not try to adjudicate the dispute between Flint and Hasker\nhere, since that would take us beyond the scope of this article.\nInstead, let\u2019s consider other possible solutions to the problem\nof prophecy. In order to classify them, it will be helpful to describe\nbriefly the different ways that philosophers and theologians have\ntried to explain God\u2019s knowledge of the contingent future.\n4. Ockhamism and the Past\n\nWilliam Ockham\n (c.1285\u20131347), a highly influential Christian philosopher and\ntheologian from the medieval period, suggested an interesting way of\naccounting for God\u2019s knowledge of the contingent future and\nresolving the problem of prophecy. (For more detailed presentations of\nOckham\u2019s views, see the introduction to Ockham 1983 by Adams and\nthe introduction to Molina 1988 by Freddoso.) Ockham claims that what\na prophet has truly revealed about the contingent future \u201ccould\nhave been and can be false\u201d (Ockham Predestination,\n44), even though the existence of the prophecy in the past is\n\u201cever afterwards necessary\u201d (Ockham\nPredestination, 44). As Calvin Normore puts it, \u201cAfter\nGod has revealed a future contingency it is necessary that the\nphysical or mental things he used to reveal it have existed, but what\nis revealed is not necessary\u201d (Normore 1982, 373). In terms of\nour example involving Jesus\u2019 prophecy concerning Peter\u2019s\ndenial, Ockham\u2019s idea is that were Peter to choose freely not to\ndeny Jesus instead, then Jesus would never have prophesied that Peter\nwould deny him. (Some philosophers like to call this kind of\nproposition a \u201cback-tracking counterfactual\u201d, because it\nis a subjunctive conditional statement whose consequent refers to an\nearlier time than its antecedent.) In other words, if a person were\nabout to choose freely to do something, then God would have known\nabout it from eternity, and hence would have acted accordingly. \n\nIf this is right, then Ockham\u2019s idea seems to imply that we have\nthe ability to do something now such that if we were to do it, then\nthe past would have been different (because God would known what we\nwould do differently and hence would have acted differently in the\npast). Some philosophers refer to this kind of ability as\n\u201ccounterfactual power over the past.\u201d Alvin Plantinga has\nthis idea in mind in his defense of Ockham\u2019s account of\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the contingent future when he says that\n\u201cit is possible that there is an action such that it is within\nyour power to perform it and such that if you were to perform it, then\nGod would not have created Abraham\u201d (Plantinga 1986, 257). Along\nthe same lines, Edward Wierenga suggests that according to Ockham,\nPeter has the power to do something such that if he were to do it,\nthen Jesus would not have intended what he said about Peter\u2019s\nfuture denials as a prophecy (Wierenga 1991, 440). In other words,\nJesus uttered words that actually did constitute a prophecy, but those\nsame words would not have been a prophecy had Peter chosen otherwise\n(Wierenga 1991, 440). \n\nMore recently, Trenton Merricks (2009) has defended the idea that\nGod\u2019s past beliefs depend upon our future free choices (although\nhe distinguishes his proposal from Ockham\u2019s: see Fischer and\nTodd 2011 and the reply in Merricks 2011a).\n\nBut doesn\u2019t this attribute to Peter a rather odd power over the\npast? Once Jesus says certain words with a certain intention, is it\ncoherent to say that Peter still has a choice about whether or not to\nbetray Jesus? Some philosophers have expressed doubts along these\nlines about whether or not Ockham\u2019s approach is ultimately\nsuccessful. Alfred J. Freddoso, for instance, claims that\n\u201cOckhamism commits one to having to choose between the Scylla of\nclaiming that God can undo the causal history of the world and the\nCharybdis of claiming that divine prophecies might be deceptive or\nmistaken\u201d (Freddoso 1988, 61; see also Warfield 2009). Finch and\nRea (2008) have also argued that a commitment to Ockham\u2019s\nsolution is incompatible with a belief in presentism, the view that\nonly the present moment is real. Whether or not these things are so,\none might wonder about the prospects for another solution. \n5. Atemporal Eternity\n\nA very different approach to explaining God\u2019s knowledge of the\ncontingent future involves suggesting that God exists outside of time\naltogether. This would mean that God does not foreknow the future,\nstrictly speaking, since foreknowledge is knowledge of an event that\nis possessed at a moment in time that occurs earlier than the moment\nin time at which the foreknown event occurs. Instead, the idea is that\nGod knows all events from the perspective of timeless eternity. (For\nfurther elaboration and defense of this view, see Stump and Kretzmann\n1987, Helm 1988, and Leftow 1991.) Many theists have adopted this view\nthroughout the centuries, including the highly influential medieval\ntheologian\n St. Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u20131274). One of the earliest Christian theologians to\ndefend this approach was Boethius (480\u2013524 C.E.), who wrote in\nThe Consolation of Philosophy that \u201c[Since] God has a\ncondition of ever-present eternity, His knowledge, which passes over\nevery change of time, embracing infinite lengths of past and future,\nviews in its own direct comprehension everything as though it were\ntaking place in the present\u201d (Boethius Consolation,\n117).\n\nSome philosophers have objected to this way of explaining God\u2019s\nknowledge because they think that it represents non-biblical picture\nof God derived largely from Greek philosophical influences (see\nWolterstorff 1982, for example). But it does suggest an interesting\napproach to the problem of prophecy. In terms of our example, the\ndefender of God\u2019s atemporal eternity would say that God knows\nfrom the perspective of eternity that Peter will deny Jesus at a\ncertain time, and on this basis, Jesus prophecies in time that the\nevent in question will occur. \n\nOne worry about this approach is that once Jesus prophecies at a\nparticular time that Peter will deny him, God\u2019s atemporally\neternal knowledge seems to be \u201cintroduced\u201d into the past\n(as David Widerker says in Widerker 1991), and the advantages of the\natemporal eternity view seem to disappear. For we are still left with\ntrying to explain how Peter\u2019s denial could be contingent, given\nthat the prophecy has already occurred. It seems that either\nPeter\u2019s denial is not free or the past can be changed somehow.\n\n\nEleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann, probably the most prominent\nadvocates of the atemporal eternity view, have defended the atemporal\neternity approach to prophecy against Widerker\u2019s objection (see\nStump and Kretzmann 1991). They point out that most prophecies are\nconditional or vague, so that they leave \u201croom\u201d for\ndifferent ways in which they might be fulfilled (400\u2013401). If a\nprophecy were to be very specific, then it might actually render the\naction in question inevitable, they admit, but they also insist that\nrendering an action inevitable is not the same as making it unfree.\nThis is because they distinguish freedom of action from freedom of\nwill, and argue that \u201cit is possible for an action to be\ninevitable and yet a free action\u201d (403), as (for instance) when\n\u201cthe agent himself has a powerful desire to do the action, his\nwill is not causally determined by anything external to him or by\npathological factors within him, and the inaccessible alternatives to\nhis inevitable action are alternatives the agent has no desire to do\nor even some desire not to do\u201d (403). Trying to resolve the\ndispute between Widerker and Stump and Kretzmann would go beyond the\nscope of this article, though, so instead we will turn to the final\nremaining solution that has been proposed for the problem of prophecy.\n\n6. Middle Knowledge\n\nThis last approach to explaining how God knows the contingent future\nstarts with an observation concerning foreknowledge and providence\nthat advocates of open theism have made very clearly and forcefully.\nWhy would knowledge of the future be useful to God? Well, presumably\nknowledge of the future enables God to make decisions about how to\nexercise divine power in order to accomplish the purposes behind\ncreation. But there is a problem here: knowledge of the future is just\nknowledge of what will happen (since the future is by definition\nwhatever will happen), and once God knows that something definitely\nwill happen, then it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. (This\nmay sound like a limit on God\u2019s power, but probably it is not:\nnot even God can make something false while that same thing is known\nto be true.) As William Hasker says, \u201cIn the logical order of\ndependence of events, one might say, by the \u2018time\u2019 God\nknows something will happen, it is \u2018too late\u2019 either to\nbring about its happening or to prevent it from happening\u201d\n(Hasker 1989, 58). So what God needs, for the purposes of providence,\nis not just knowledge about what will happen, but also knowledge about\nwhat could happen and what would happen in certain circumstances. \n\nLuis de Molina, an influential Spanish Jesuit theologian\n(1535\u20131600 C.E.), thought that this was a serious problem. In\norder to develop a view that would explain the relationships between\nall of these things, he drew a distinction between three kinds of\nknowledge in God, a distinction that suggests another response to the\nproblem of prophecy. (For more complete and detailed presentations of\nthis view, see Freddoso\u2019s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig\n1987, Flint 1988 and Flint 1998.)\n\nAccording to Molina, the first kind of knowledge that God possesses is\ncalled natural knowledge. A true proposition is part of God\u2019s\nnatural knowledge if and only if it is a necessary truth (a truth\nwhich could not be false under any circumstances whatever) which is\nbeyond God\u2019s control (nobody, including God, could make them\nfalse). Examples of such true propositions would include \u201c2 + 2\n= 4\u201d, \u201cNothing is both red all over and green all over at\nonce\u201d, and \u201cEvery triangle has three sides.\u201d\n\nThe second kind of knowledge that God possesses is called free\nknowledge because it is subject to God\u2019s free decision.\nAccording to Molina, a true proposition is part of God\u2019s free\nknowledge if and only if it is a contingent truth (an actual truth\nwhich could have been false under different circumstances) that is\nwithin God\u2019s control. Examples of such true propositions would\ninclude \u201cThe same side of the moon always faces the\nEarth\u201d, \u201cHuman beings exist\u201d and \u201cThere are\niguanas in South America\u201d, since God could have brought it about\nthat these true propositions were false instead.\n\nThe third kind of knowledge that God possesses, according to Molina,\nis called middle knowledge (because it is \u201cin between\u201d\nGod\u2019s natural knowledge and free knowledge). A true proposition\nis part of God\u2019s middle knowledge if and only if it is a\ncontingent truth (like items of God\u2019s free knowledge) but beyond\nGod\u2019s control (like items of God\u2019s natural knowledge). The\nmost frequently discussed items of middle knowledge are often called\n\u201csubjunctive conditionals of freedom\u201d by philosophers,\nsince they describe what people would freely do if placed in various\npossible situations.\n\nMolina claims that God\u2019s providential control over the world\ninvolves middle knowledge in a crucial way. Very briefly, here is how\nit is supposed to work: through natural knowledge, God knows what is\nnecessary and what is possible. Through middle knowledge, God knows\nwhat every possible person would do freely in every possible\nsituation, among other things. So God decides which kind of world to\ncreate, including those situations in which free human persons should\nbe placed, knowing how they would respond, and this results in\nGod\u2019s free knowledge (contingent truths which are up to God),\nincluding foreknowledge of the actual future.\n\nIn the case of Jesus\u2019 prophecy that Peter would deny him,\nMolinists would say that God knew (through middle knowledge) that if\nPeter were placed in certain circumstances, then he would deny Jesus.\nAnd for reasons not known to us, God decided to create those\ncircumstances, place Peter in them, and prophecy through Jesus what\nPeter was going to do. (For a much more detailed explanation, see\nFlint 1998, chapter 9.) Molina\u2019s theory of middle knowledge\ngenerates a theory of providence designed to combine a strong notion\nof God\u2019s control with a robust account of the contingency\ninvolved in human freedom. (It also appears to have some biblical\nsupport, because there are verses which seem to attribute middle\nknowledge to God, although this is disputed: see I Samuel\n23:6\u201313 and Matthew 11:20\u201324, for example.) \n\nHowever, philosophers have expressed several doubts about whether or\nnot it is possible for God to possess middle knowledge, doubts that\nparallel those expressed above in connection with the possibility of\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the contingent future. For one thing,\nthey wonder about subjunctive conditionals of freedom: can we really\nassume that these are either true or false? How can they be true if\n(for example) the person in question is never in the situation and\nnever actually makes a choice? What \u201cgrounds\u201d them or\nmakes them true? A second worry about Molina\u2019s picture has to do\nwith the nature of knowledge. Even if a given counterfactual of\nfreedom is true, knowing a proposition requires that a person be able\nto distinguish what is true from what is false. The worry here is that\nperhaps not even God could distinguish true counterfactuals of freedom\nfrom false ones. (For more detailed discussions of these objections,\nsee Adams 1977, Freddoso\u2019s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig\n1987, Flint 1988, Flint 1998, Hasker 1989, Davison 1991, and Perszyk\n2011, and Oppy and Saward 2014; for a clever attempt to explain\nprophecy without middle knowledge, see Pruss 2007 and the response\nfrom Corabi and Germino 2013.) \n7. Conclusion\n\nThere are several ways to try to resolve the problem of prophecy that\nis the focus of most philosophical debate, which arises in cases where\na future contingent event is predicted. The approaches discussed here\npossess various strengths and weaknesses. The question of prophecy has\nbeen receiving increased attention as the debate over the extent of\nGod\u2019s knowledge has become more widely discussed in recent work\nin the philosophy of religion. As a result, one could reasonably\npredict (prophesy?) that philosophical arguments concerning these\nmatters will continue indefinitely into the future. \n",
