    "main_text": "Arguments for Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Relativity Theory\n7. Other Debates about Eternity \n\nBoth timelessness or atemporality, and permanence or everlastingness,\nare widely applicable concepts. This section outlines a few non-religious\nphilosophical debates in which the concept of eternity, in the sense\nof atemporality, can play a role (McDaniel 2016).\n\nConsider questions about the nature of propositions, mathematical\nobjects, or other abstracta. Perhaps these are atemporal entities,\nexisting outside of time/spacetime, and not standing in any\nspatiotemporal relations to other entities. What sorts of\nconsiderations might bear on whether they are or not? Take\npropositions, the true or false things sentences express. Take a\nsentence that changes its truth-value over time (e.g.,\n\u201cIt\u2019s sunny\u201d). Does such a sentence express\ndifferent propositions at different times (that it\u2019s sunny at\n\\(t_1\\), that it\u2019s sunny at \\(t_2\\), etc.)? Or does it express\nthe same proposition over time (that it\u2019s sunny)? If it\u2019s\nthe former, then the propositions expressed don\u2019t themselves\nchange truth-value. If it\u2019s the latter, the proposition (that\nit\u2019s sunny) itself changes truth-value. In this latter case,\nthat might give one reason think that the proposition is located\nwithin time rather than outside of it. On the other hand, it might\nnot. After all, the truth-value also seems to vary with spatial\nlocation; yet we may be reluctant to infer from this that the\nproposition has spatial locations.\n\nAs another example, consider the view that time does not exist, for\nexample as argued for by speculative metaphysicians such as McTaggart\nor F. H. Bradley. On such views, everything is eternal (in the\nsense of atemporal).\n\nThe view that time is unreal was also argued for by Kurt G\u00f6del on\nthe basis of general relativistic considerations (G\u00f6del\n1949). G\u00f6del\u2019s starting point is his discovery of solutions\nto Einstein\u2019s Field Equations that permit the existence of\nclosed timelike curves. Such spacetimes, he argues, do not contain a\ntemporal dimension, since time only exists if there is genuine passage\nof time, and there cannot be genuine passage of time in such\nworlds. This in turn suggests that time does not pass, and thus does\nnot exist, in the actual world either (for more on the argument see\nSavitt 1994; Dorato 2002; Yourgrau 2005).\n\nMore recently, some physicists and philosophers of physics working on\napproaches to quantum gravity have entertained the view that spacetime\nmay not be fundamental (see the SEP entry on\n quantum gravity).\n Of course, whether the concept of atemporality applies in this\ncontext depends on how the claim that spacetime is not fundamental is\nbest understood.\n",
