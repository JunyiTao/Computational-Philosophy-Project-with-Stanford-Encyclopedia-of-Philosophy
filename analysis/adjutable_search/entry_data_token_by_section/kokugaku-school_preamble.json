    "main_text": "\n\nIn its broadest sense, kokugaku has been used to refer to\nscholarship that takes Japan as its focus instead of China. In the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, it came to refer more\nnarrowly to the effort to discern a native Way distinct from Buddhism\nand Confucianism within Japan\u2019s most ancient writings, and to\nthe attendant effort to resurrect that Way in the present. Most\nscholars agree on the major leaders of these studies during the\nTokugawa period, with Motoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801) thought to be\nits greatest intellectual and Hirata Atsutane (1776\u20131843) its\nmost effective popularizer.\n\nMotoori Norinaga saw the roots of the discipline in\nKeich\u016b\u2019s (1640\u20131701) use of historical linguistics to\nanalyze the eighth-century collection of poems called\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b, whereas Atsutane found it in the\nJapanese-studies academic efforts of Kada no Azumamaro\n(1669\u20131736). Both included Kamo no Mabuchi (1697\u20131769) in\ntheir list of founders. In any case, after Hirata Atsutane, the\nlineage of Kokugaku\u2019s leaders became more complex as the new\nMeiji state used Kokugaku notions of racial identity and cultural\nsuperiority to mobilize support for Japan\u2019s nationalist ideology\nand purported international destiny. After 1945 such notions of racial\nidentity and cultural superiority were briefly considered taboo and\nreplaced by less toxic arguments regarding Japanese uniqueness, though\nthese too have morphed yet again into the broad category of\nNihonjinron, \u201ctheories of Japaneseness\u201d which is\na major strain within contemporary Japanese popular culture.\n",
