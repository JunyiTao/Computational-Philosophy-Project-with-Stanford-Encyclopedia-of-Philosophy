    "main_text": "No False Lemmas\n4. No False Lemmas\n\nAccording to one suggestion, the following fourth condition would do\nthe trick:\n\nS\u2019s belief that p is not inferred from any\n falsehood.[12]\n\n\nIn Gettier\u2019s cases, the justified true belief is inferred from a\njustified false belief. So condition (iv) explains why it isn\u2019t\nknowledge. However, this \u201cno false lemmas\u201d proposal is not\nsuccessful in general. There are examples of Gettier cases that need\ninvolve no inference; therefore, there are possible cases of justified\ntrue belief without knowledge, even though condition (iv) is met.\nSuppose, for example, that James, who is relaxing on a bench in a\npark, observes an apparent dog in a nearby field. So he believes\n\nThere is a dog in the field.\n\n\nSuppose further that the putative dog is actually a robot dog so\nperfect that it could not be distinguished from an actual dog by\nvision alone. James does not know that such robot dogs exist; a\nJapanese toy manufacturer has only recently developed them, and what\nJames sees is a prototype that is used for testing the public\u2019s\nresponse. Given these assumptions, (d) is of course false. But suppose\nfurther that just a few feet away from the robot dog, there is a real\ndog, concealed from James\u2019s view. Given this further assumption,\nJames\u2019s belief in (d) is true. And since this belief is based on\nordinary perceptual processes, most epistemologists will agree that it\nis justified. But as in Gettier\u2019s cases, James\u2019s\nbelief appears to be true only as a matter of luck, in a way\ninconsistent with knowledge. So once again, what we have before us is\na justified true belief that isn\u2019t\n knowledge.[13]\n Arguably, this belief is directly justified by a visual experience;\nit is not inferred from any falsehood. If so, then the JTB account,\neven if supplemented with (iv), gives us the wrong result that James\nknows (d).\n\nAnother case illustrating that clause (iv) won\u2019t do the job is\nthe well-known Barn County case (Goldman 1976). Suppose there is a\ncounty in the Midwest with the following peculiar feature. The\nlandscape next to the road leading through that county is peppered\nwith barn-facades: structures that from the road look exactly like\nbarns. Observation from any other viewpoint would immediately reveal\nthese structures to be fakes: devices erected for the purpose of\nfooling unsuspecting motorists into believing in the presence of\nbarns. Suppose Henry is driving along the road that leads through Barn\nCounty. Naturally, he will on numerous occasions form false beliefs in\nthe presence of barns. Since Henry has no reason to suspect that he is\nthe victim of organized deception, these beliefs are justified. Now\nsuppose further that, on one of those occasions when he believes there\nis a barn over there, he happens to be looking at the one and only\nreal barn in the county. This time, his belief is justified and true.\nBut since its truth is the result of luck, it is exceedingly plausible\nto judge that Henry\u2019s belief is not an instance of knowledge.\nYet condition (iv) is met in this case. His belief is not the result\nof any inference from a falsehood. Once again, we see that (iv) does\nnot succeed as a general solution to the Gettier problem.\n",
