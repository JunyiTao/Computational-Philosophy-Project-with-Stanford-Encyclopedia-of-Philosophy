The\ncounterpart condition for the so-called relevance notion of\nprobabilistic confirmation is the following:\n\n(P3) Tautological evidence\n\nFor any \\(h_{1},h_{2},k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP\\),\n\\(C_{P}(h_{1},\\top \\mid k) = C_{P}(h_{2},\\top \\mid k).\\) \n\n(P3) implies that any hypothesis is equally \u201cconfirmed\u201d by\nempty evidence. We will say that \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) represents the\nprobabilistic relevance notion of confirmation, or\nrelevance-confirmation, if and only if it satisfies (P0), (P1) and\n(P3). These conditions are sufficient to derive the following, purely\nqualitative principle, according to the definitional method in (QC)\nabove (see Crupi and Tentori 2014, 82, and Crupi 2015).\n\nProbabilistic relevance confirmation (qualitative)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP:\\)\n\n\n\\(e\\) relevance-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nif and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\gt P(h\\mid k);\\)\n\\(e\\) relevance-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\lt P(h\\mid k);\\)\n\\(e\\) is relevance-neutral for \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) = P(h\\mid k).\\)\n\n\n\nThe point of relevance confirmation is that the credibility of a\nhypothesis can be changed in either a positive (confirmation\nin a strict sense) or negative way (disconfirmation) by the evidence\nconcerned (given \\(k\\)). Confirmation (in the strict sense) thus\nreflects an increase from initial to final probability, whereas\ndisconfirmation reflects a decrease (see Achinstein 2005 for some\ndiverging views on this very idea).\n\nThe qualitative notions of confirmation as firmness and as relevance\nare demonstrably distinct. Unlike firmness, relevance confirmation can\nnot be formalized by the final probability alone, or any increasing\nfunction thereof. To illustrate, the probability of an otherwise very\nrare disease \\((h)\\) can be quite low even after a relevant positive\ntest result \\((e)\\); yet \\(h\\) is relevance-confirmed by \\(e\\) to the\nextent that its probability rises thereby. By the same token, the\nprobability of the absence of the disease \\((\\neg h)\\) can be quite\nhigh despite the positive test result \\((e)\\), yet \\(\\neg h\\) is\nrelevance-disconfirmed by \\(e\\) to the extent that its probability\ndecreases thereby. Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between\nfirmness and relevance confirmation\u2014\u201cextremely\nfundamental\u201d and yet \u201csometimes unnoticed\u201d, as\nSalmon (1969, 48\u201349) put it\u2014had to be stressed time and\nagain to achieve theoretical clarity in philosophy (e.g., Popper 1954;\nPeijnenburg 2012) as well as in other domains concerned, such as\nartificial intelligence and the psychology of reasoning (see Horvitz\nand Heckerman 1986; Crupi, Fitelson, and Tentori 2008; Shogenji\n2012).\n\nThe qualitative notion of relevance confirmation already has some\ninteresting consequences. It implies, for instance, the following\nremarkable fact:\n\nComplementary Evidence (CompE)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) if and only if \\(\\neg e\\) disconfirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k.\\) \n\nThe importance of (CompE) can be illustrated as follows. Consider the\ncase of a father suspected of abusing his son. Suppose that the child\ndoes claim that s/he has been abused (label this evidence \\(e\\)). A\nforensic psychiatrist, when consulted, declares that this confirms\nguilt \\((h)\\). Alternatively, suppose that the child is asked and does\nnot report having been abused \\((\\neg e).\\) As pointed out by\nDawes (2001), it may well happen that a forensic psychiatrist will\nnonetheless interpret this as evidence confirming guilt\n(suggesting that violence has prompted the child\u2019s denial). One\nmight want to argue that, other things being equal, this kind of\n\u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d judgment would be\ninconsistent, and thus in principle untenable. Whoever concurs with\nthis line of argument (as Dawes 2001 himself did) is likely to be\nrelying on the relevance notion of confirmation. In fact, no other\nnotion of confirmation considered so far provides a general foundation\nfor this judgment. \\(F\\)-confirmation, in particular, would not do,\nfor it does allow that both \\(e\\) and \\(\\neg e\\) confirm \\(h\\)\n(relative to \\(k\\)). This is because, mathematically, it is perfectly\npossible for both \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\) and \\(P(h\\mid \\neg e \\wedge\nk)\\) to be arbitrarily high above \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}.\\) Condition (CompE),\non the contrary, ensures that only one between the\ncomplementary statements \\(e\\) and \\(\\neg e\\) can confirm hypothesis\n\\(h\\) (relative to \\(k\\)). (To be precise, HD-confirmation also\nsatisfies condition CompE, yet it would fail the above example all the\nsame, although for a different reason, that is, because the connection\nbetween \\(h\\) and \\(e\\) is plausibly one of probabilistic dependence\nbut not of logical entailment.)\n\nRemarks such as the foregoing have induced some contemporary Bayesian\ntheorists to dismiss the notion of confirmation as firmness\naltogether, concluding with I.J. Good (1968, 134) that \u201cif you\nhad \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\) close to unity, but less than \\(P(h\\mid\nk)\\), you ought not to say that \\(h\\) was confirmed by\n\\(e\\)\u201d (also see Salmon 1975, 13). Let us follow this suggestion\nand proceed to consider the ordinal (and quantitative) notions of\nrelevance confirmation.\n",
