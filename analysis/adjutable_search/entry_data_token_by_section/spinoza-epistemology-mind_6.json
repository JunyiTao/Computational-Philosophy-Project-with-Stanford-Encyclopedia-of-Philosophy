    "main_text": "Philosophy of mind || Consciousness and ideas of ideas\n2.3 Consciousness and ideas of ideas\n\nGiven the importance of the concept of consciousness to contemporary\nphilosophy of mind, it is perhaps unsurprising that Spinoza\u2019s\nreaders have tried to extract a full-blown theory of consciousness\nalso from the rare appearances of terms such as conscius and\nconscientia in his writings. Such efforts are also\nunsurprising given Spinoza\u2019s historical placement between\nDescartes (often taken to define thought in terms of consciousness)\nand Leibniz (who distinguishes thinking as a perfectly general\nproperty from consciousness as a property of higher minds alone) (cf.\nLeBuffe 2010). Interpreters return again and again to certain\nquestions: did Spinoza even have a theory of consciousness in\na recognizable sense? If he did, was it an internally consistent and\nadequately defended theory? Was it meant to distinguish conscious and\nunconscious ideas (and so also conscious and unconscious minds [see\n2.1.1])? Did Spinoza posit universal (but perhaps scalar or graded)\nconsciousness, just as he posited universal (but scalar or graded)\nmindedness (see 2.1.3)?\n\nThe existing array of interpretations ranges widely, from\nCurley\u2019s 1969 conclusion that for Spinoza\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d picks out higher order ideas\n(that is, ideas of ideas); through proposals that the term is intended\nto track the complexity (Nadler 2008) or the power\n(D. Garrett 2018: ch.14, E. Marshall 2013) of ideas; to the claim that\nSpinoza uses conscius and conscientia in several\ndifferent senses (LeBuffe 2010b).\n\nThe ideas-of-ideas reading of consciousness gets going because of\npassages like E4p8d, where Spinoza characterizes\n\u201ccognition\u201d of good and evil as\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d of certain emotions (given that\nSpinozistic emotions or \u201caffects\u201d are already themselves\nconstituted in part by \u201cideas\u201d [E3def3]) and E3p9s, where\nSpinoza characterizes \u201cdesire\u201d as \u201cappetite together\nwith consciousness of appetite\u201d (given that\n\u201cappetite\u201d is already \u201crelated to the mind\u201d\n[E3p9s]). In both cases the implication seems to be that consciousness\nis or involves higher order ideas.\n\nOf course, this interpretation of consciousness is of no use to\nsomeone looking to Spinoza for a theory of selective\nconsciousness, on which consciousness distinguishes some mental states\nfrom others. This is because in Spinoza\u2019s framework there is no\nidea of which there is no higher order idea. This follows, first, from\ndivine omniscience (an all-knowing God has ideas of all things,\nincluding all ideas) and, second, from Spinoza\u2019s understanding\nof ideas of ideas as ways of regarding the\nfirst-order ideas, not numerically distinct from them. More precisely,\nfor Spinoza, an idea of idea A is just A considered only as an\nact of thinking (leaving aside its representational content)\n\u2013 or, to use his Scholastic terminology, it is the original idea\nconsidered in its \u201cformal reality\u201d alone: it is \u201cthe\nform of the idea\u2026considered as a mode of thinking without\nrelation to the object\u201d (E2p21s).\n\nInterpretations on which consciousness is a scalar property tracking\ncomplexity or power fare much better in accounting for texts in which\nSpinoza depicts consciousness as a matter of selective causal and\ncognitive achievement, as in the following:\n\nHe who, like an infant or child, has a body capable of very few things\nand very heavily dependent on external causes, has a mind which\nconsidered solely in itself is conscious of almost nothing of itself,\nor of God, or of things. On the other hand, he who has a body capable\nof a great many things, has a mind which considered only in itself is\nvery much conscious of itself, and of God, and of things (E5p39s)\n\n\n(On consciousness see also Miller 2007.)\n",
