    "main_text": "Some versions of proof-theoretic semantics || Sentence-based semantics\n2.7 Sentence-based semantics\n\nInstead of defining the validity of proofs of sentences, one can\ndefine the proof-theoretic validity of sentences directly. In the\ndefinition of validity of logically complex sentences one would then\ndiscard the reference to proofs of these sentences. This does not mean\nthat one is giving up the proof-theoretic approach, as one would still\nrefer to proofs in the atomic base. Proofs come in at the atomic\nlevel, but not at the logical level. This approach is technically much\nsimpler to elaborate than the one based on the validity of proofs (see\nsection\n 2.2.2),\n but still sufficient to discuss basic topics such as semantical\ncompleteness (see section\n 2.8).\n In fact, from a proof of a sentence \\(A\\) which is valid in the sense\nof section\n 2.2.2,\n the validity of \\(A\\) in the sense of sentence-based semantics can be\ninferred; and conversely, from the validity of \\(A\\) in sentence-based\nsemantics a (though degenerate) valid proof of \\(A\\) can be\nconstructed. In a sense, sentence-based semantics is related to the\nproof-theoretic semantics inherent in Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s system\n(see section\n 2.2.3),\n where in the case of elementary logic (where dependent types do not\nplay any role), the proof information \\(t\\) of a judgement \\(t{:}A\\)\ncan be discarded in favour of the simplified judgement \\(A\\\n\\textit{true}\\).\n\nOne possible definition of the validity of sentences in minimal\npropositional logic with respect to an atomic system \\(S\\) as its\natomic base in propositional logic would be the following:\n\nAn atomic formula \\(A\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if it is derivable in\n\\(S\\).\nA conjunction \\(A\\land B\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare \\(S\\)-valid.\nA disjunction \\(A\\lor B\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nis \\(S\\)-valid.\nAn implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is \\(S\\) valid, if for every\nextension \\(S'\\) of \\(S\\), if \\(A\\) if \\(S'\\)-valid then \\(B\\) is\n\\(S'\\)-valid.\n\n\nNote that in the statement of hypothetical validity reference is made\nto arbitrary extensions of the atomic base considered. As in the\nformal definition of the validity of proofs, considering\nbase-extensions is used to ensure monotonicity and to avoid vacuous\nvalidity. In the literature, following Sandqvist (2015a), the term\n\u201cbase-extension semantics\u201d is often used in a more\nspecific sense: namely for a special form of sentence-based semantics,\nin which disjunction receives a deviant interpretation.\n\nValidity in sentence-based semantics depends on the choice of atomic\nsystems. This choice is what makes sentence-based semantics\nproof-theoretic. As indicated in section\n 2.6,\n the type of atomic system counts, as does the extension relation\nconsidered for implications and consequence statements.\n",
