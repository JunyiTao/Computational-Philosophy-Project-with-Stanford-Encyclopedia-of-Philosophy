    "main_text": "Theology\n14. Theology\n\nThe science of being qua being is a science of form. But it is also\ntheology, the science of god. The question now is, how can it be both?\nAnd to it Aristotle gives a succinct answer:\n\nIf there is some immovable substance, this [that is, theological\nphilosophy] will be prior and will be primary philosophy, and it will\nbe universal in this way, namely, because it is primary. And it will\nbelong to it to get a theoretical grasp on being qua being, both what\nit is and the things that belong to it insofar as it is being. (E.1,\n1026a29\u201332)\n\n\nSo the primacy of theology, which is based on the fact that it deals\nwith substance that is eternal, immovable, and separable, is\nsupposedly what justifies us in treating it as the universal science\nof being qua being.\n\nA reminder, first, of what this primacy is. As we saw in Sections 2\u20133\nabove, only beings in the category of substance are separable, so that\nthey alone enjoy a sort of ontological priority that is both\nexistential and explanatory. Thus walking and being healthy are\ncharacterized as \u201cincapable of being separated,\u201d on the\ngrounds that there is some particular substantial underlying subject\nof which they are predicated (Z.1, 1028a20\u201331).\nOften, indeed, separability is associated with being such a subject:\n\u201cThe underlying subject is prior, which is why the substance is\nprior\u201d (\u0394.11, 1019a5\u20136); \u201cIf we do\nnot posit substances to be separated, and in the way in which\nparticular things are said to be separated, we will do away with the\nsort of substance we wish to maintain\u201d (M.10,\n1086b16\u201319). Similarly, not being separable is\nassociated with being predicated of such a subject: \u201cAll other\nthings are either said of primary substances as subjects or in them as\nsubjects. Therefore, if there were no primary substances, there could\nnot be anything else\u201d (Cat. 2b3\u20136).\nThe starting-points and causes of all beings, then, must be\nsubstances. But for all that has been shown so far, the universe could\nstill be made up of lots of separate substances having little\nontologically to do with each other.\n\nHere it may serve to return to Z.3, which opens by calling attention\nto something said (legomenon) about substance, namely\nthat:\n\nSomething is said to be (legetai) substance, if not in more\nways, at any rate most of all in four. For the essence, the universal,\nand the genus seem to be the substance of each thing, and fourth of\nthese, the underlying subject. (1028b33\u201336)\n\n\nSince \u201cthe primary underlying subject seems most of all to be\nsubstance\u201d (1029a1\u20132), because what is said or\npredicated of it depends on it, the investigation begins with this\nsubject, quickly isolating three candidates: the matter, the compound\nof matter and form, and the form itself (1029a2\u20133),\nwhich is identical to essence (1032b1\u20132). Almost as\nquickly (1029a7\u201332), the first two candidates are at\nleast provisionally excluded. A\u2014perhaps the\u2014major\nground for their exclusion is the primacy dilemma, which we\nshall now briefly investigate.\n\nThe philosophical background to the dilemma is this. If you are a\nrealist about scientific knowledge and truth, as Aristotle is, the\nstructure of your scientific theories must mirror the structure of\nreality, so that scientific starting-points or first principles, must\nalso be the basic building blocks of reality. Suppose that this is not\nso. Suppose that your physics tells you that atoms are the basic\nbuilding blocks of reality and that your psychology tells you that\nsense-perceptions are the starting-points of scientific knowledge.\nThen you will face a very severe problem, that of skepticism. For a\nwedge can be driven between the starting-points of scientific\nknowledge and reality\u2019s basic building blocks. Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 famous dreaming argument is one familiar form such a\nwedge might take. Your sense-perceptions are consistent with your\nbeing always asleep and having a very detailed dream.\n\nIn B.6, Aristotle introduces a similar problem about the relation\nbetween our scientific representation of the world and how the world\nin itself is structured:\n\nWe must \u2026 ask whether [the starting-points] are universal or\nexist in the way we say particulars do. For if they are universal,\nthey will not be substances. For no common thing signifies a this\nsomething but a such-and-such sort of thing, whereas substance is a\nthis something.\u2026 If then the starting-points are universals,\nthese things follow. But if they are not universals, but [exist] as\nparticulars, they will not be scientifically knowable. For scientific\nknowledge of all things is universal. Thus there will be other\nstarting-points prior to the starting-points, namely, those that are\npredicated universally, if indeed there is going to be scientific\nknowledge of these. (1003a7\u201317)\n\n\nThe basic building blocks of reality, (Aristotelian) science tells us,\nare particular matter-form compounds. Yet science\u2019s own\nstarting-points are the forms\u2014the universal essences\u2014of\nsuch things. There is no science of you, or of me, though there is one\nof human beings. How, then, can science possibly be reflecting\naccurately the structure of reality, when its starting-points and\nthose of reality fail so radically to map onto each other? For there\nis no greater difference, it seems, than that between particulars and\nuniversals. The thing to do, then, given that science provides our\nbest access to the nature of reality, is to investigate the universal\nforms or essences that are basic to it.\n\nAristotle begins the investigation with the most familiar and widely\nrecognized case, which is the form or essence present in sublunary\nmatter-form compounds. It is announced in Z.3\n(1029b3\u201312), but not begun until some chapters later\nand not really completed until the end of \u0398.5. And by then it is\nwith actuality (entelecheia) or activity (energeia)\nthat form is identified, and matter with potentiality. The science of\nbeing qua being can legitimately focus on form, or actuality, then, as\nthe factor common to all substances, and so to all the beings. But\nunless it can be shown that there is some explanatory connection\nbetween the forms of all these substances, the non-fragmentary nature\nof being itself will still not have been established, and the pictures\ngiven to us by the various sciences will, so to speak, be separate\npictures, and the being they collectively portray, divided.\n\nThe next stage in the unification of being, and the legitimation of\nthe science dealing with it qua being, is effected by an argument in\n\u039b.6 that trades on the identification of form with actuality\nand matter with potentiality:\n\nIf there is something that is capable of moving things or acting on\nthem, but that is not actively doing so, there will not [necessarily]\nbe movement, since it is possible for what has a capacity not to\nactivate it. There is no benefit, therefore, in positing eternal\nsubstances, as those who accept the Forms do, unless there is to be\npresent in them some starting-point that is capable of causing change.\nMoreover, even this is not enough, and neither is another substance\nbeyond the Forms. For if it will not be active, there will not be\nmovement. Further, even if it will be active, it is not enough, if the\nsubstance of it is a capacity. For then there will not be\neternal movement, since what is potentially may possibly not\nbe. There must, therefore, be such a starting-point, the very\nsubstance of which is activity. Further, accordingly, these substances\nmust be without matter. For they must be eternal, if indeed\nanything else is eternal. Therefore they must be activity.\n(1071b12\u201322)\n\n\nMatter-form compounds are, as such, capable of movement and change.\nThe canonical examples of them\u2014perhaps the only genuine or fully\nfledged ones\u2014are living metabolizing beings (Z.17,\n1041b29\u201330). But if these beings are to be actual,\nthere must be substances whose very essence is\nactivity\u2014substances that do not need to be activated by\nsomething else.\n\nWith matter-form compounds shown to be dependent on substantial\nactivities for their actual being, a further element of vertical\nunification is introduced into beings, since layer-wise the two sorts\nof substances belong together. Laterally, though, disunity continues\nto threaten. For as yet nothing has been done to exclude the\npossibility of each compound substance having a distinct substantial\nactivity as its own unique activator. Being, in that case, would be a\nset of ordered pairs, the first member of which would be a substantial\nactivity, the second a matter-form compound, with all its dependent\nattributes.\n\nIn Metaphysics \u039b.8 Aristotle initially takes a step in\nthe direction of such a bipartite picture. He asks how many\nsubstantial activities are required to explain astronomical phenomena,\nsuch as the movements of the stars and planets, and answers that there\nmust be forty-nine of them (1074a16). But these forty-nine\nare coordinated with each other so as to form a system. And what\nenables them to do so, and to constitute a single heaven, is that\nthere is a single prime mover of all of them:\n\nIt is evident that there is but one heaven. For if there are many, as\nthere are many human beings, the starting-point for each will be one\nin form but in number many. But all things that are many in number\nhave matter, for one and the same account applies to many, for\nexample, human beings, whereas Socrates is one. But the primary\nessence does not have matter, since it is an actuality. The primary\nimmovable mover, therefore, is one both in account and in number. And\nso, therefore, is what is moved always and continuously. Therefore,\nthere is only one heaven. (1074a31\u201338)\n\n\nWhat accounts for the unity of the heaven, then, is that the movements\nin it are traceable back to a single cause: the prime or primary\nmover.\n\nLeaving aside the question of just how this primary mover moves what\nit moves directly, the next phase in the unification of beings is the\none in which the sublunary world is integrated with the already\nunified superlunary one studied by astronomy. This takes place in\n\u039b.10. One obvious indication of this unification is the\ndependence of the reproductive cycles of plants and animals on the\nseasons, and their dependence, in turn, on the movements of the sun\nand moon (\u039b.5, 1071a13\u201316). And beyond even\nthis there is the unity of the natural world itself, which is\nmanifested in the ways in which its inhabitants are adapted to each\nother:\n\nAll things are jointly organized in a way, although not in the same\nway\u2014even swimming creatures, flying creatures, and plants. And\nthe organization is not such that one thing has no relation to another\nbut rather there is a relation. For all things are jointly organized\nin relation to one thing\u2014but it is as in a household, where the\nfree men least of all do things at random, but all or most of the\nthings they do are organized, while the slaves and beasts can do a\nlittle for the common thing, but mostly do things at random. For this\nis the sort of starting-point that the nature is of each of them. I\nmean, for example, that all must at least come to be disaggregated\n[into their elements]; and similarly there are other things which they\nall share for the whole. (1075a16\u201325)\n\n\nThus the sublunary realm is sufficiently integrated with the\nsuperlunary one that we can speak of them as jointly having a nature\nand a ruler, and as being analogous to an army (1075a13)\nand a household (1075a22).\n\nWe may agree, then, that the divine substances in the superlunary\nrealm and the compound substances in the sublunary one have prima\nfacie been vertically integrated into a single explanatory system. As\na result, when we look at the form of a sublunary matter-form\ncompound, we will find in it the mark of a superlunary activator, just\nas we do in the case of the various heavenly bodies, and, as in the\nline of its efficient causes, we find \u201cthe sun and its movement\nin an inclined circle\u201d (1071a15\u201316). Still\nawaiting integration, though, are mathematical objects, such as\nnumbers. But in Books M and N these are shown to be not substantial\nstarting-points and causes but abstractions from perceptible sublunary\nbeings\u2014they are dependent entities, in other words, rather than\nself-subsistent ones. Similarly, in Physics II.2 we read:\n\nThe mathematician too busies himself about these things [planes,\nsolids, lines, and points], although not insofar as each of them is\nthe limit of a natural body, nor does he get a theoretical grasp on\nthe coincidents of natural bodies insofar as they are such. That is\nwhy he separates them. For they are separable in the understanding\nfrom movement, and so their being separated makes no difference, nor\ndoes any falsehood result from it. (193b31\u201335)\n\n\nThis completes the vertical and horizontal unification of being:\nattributes depend on substances, substantial matter-form compounds\ndepend on substantial forms, or activities, numbers depend on\nmatter-form compounds.\n\nBeings are not said to be \u201cin accord with one thing,\u201d\ntherefore, as they would be if they formed a single first-order genus,\nbut \u201cwith reference to one thing,\u201d namely, a divine\nsubstance that is in essence an activity. And it is this more complex\nunity, compatible with generic diversity, and a genuine multiplicity\nof distinct first-order sciences, but just as robust and well\ngrounded, that grounds and legitimates the science of being qua being\nas a single science dealing with a genuine object of study (\u0393.2,\n1003b11\u201316). The long argument that leads to this\nconclusion is thus a sort of proof of the existence, and so of the\npossibility, of the science on which the Metaphysics focuses.\nIt is also the justification for the claim, which we looked at before,\nthat the science of being qua being is in fact theology\n(1026a27\u201332).\n\nThere, then, in the starry heavens above us, are the forty-nine\ncelestial spheres, all moving eternally in fixed circular orbits. The\noutermost one, which contains all the others, is the primary heaven.\nQuestions immediately arise: (i) how is the primary heaven moved by\nthe primary mover, the primary god? Aristotle gives his response in\n\u039b.7:\n\nThere is something [namely, the primary heaven,] that is always moved\nwith an unceasing movement, which is in a circle (and this is clear\nnot from argument alone but also from the facts). So the primary\nheaven would be eternal. There is, therefore, also something that\nmoves it [namely, the primary god]. But since what is moved and moves\nsomething is something medial, there is something that moves without\nbeing moved, being eternal, substance, and activity. This, though, is\nthe way the object of desire and the intelligible object move things:\nthey move them without being moved. Of these objects, the primary ones\nare the same. (1072a21\u201327)\n\n\nThus the primary heaven is moved by the primary god, in the way that\nwe are moved by a good that we desire. (That this heaven, as well as\nthe other heavenly bodies, are therefore alive is argued for in De\nCaelo II.12.) But (ii) how can the primary god be such a good?\nMoreover, (iii) why is he not moved by something else again?\n\nThe answer to question (ii) is also found in \u039b.7:\n\nActive understanding, though, is intrinsically of what is\nintrinsically best, and the sort that is to the highest degree best is\nof what is to the highest degree best. The understanding actively\nunderstands itself by partaking of the intelligible object. (For it\nbecomes an intelligible object by touching and understanding one, so\nthat understanding and intelligible object are the same.) For what is\nreceptive of the intelligible object and of the substance is the\nunderstanding, and it is active when it possesses it, so that this\nrather than that seems to be the divine thing that understanding\npossesses, and contemplation seems to be most pleasant and best. If,\nthen, that good state [of activity], which we are sometimes in, the\n[primary] god is always in, that is a wonderful thing, and if to a\nhigher degree, that is yet more wonderful. But that is his state. And\nlife, too, certainly belongs to him. For the activity of understanding\nis life, and he is that activity; and his intrinsic activity is life\nthat is best and eternal. (1072b18\u201328)\n\n\nWhat the primary heaven is moved by, then, is the wish to be in the\ngood state of active contemplation that we, when we are happiest, are\nin, and that the primary god is always in because he just is\nthat activity. Just as we seek the good that the primary god is, so\ntoo does the primary heaven and its forty-eight celestial\ncompanions.\n\nThis brings us to question (iii). When the understanding is actively\ncontemplating something, that something\u2014that intelligible\nobject\u2014is what activates it. So why isn\u2019t that object yet\nmore primary than the primary god? Aristotle gives his answer in\n\u039b.9; the reasoning, though compressed, should now be fairly\nreadily intelligible:\n\nWhat does it [the primary god] understand? For it is either itself or\nsomething else. And if something else, then either always the same\nthing or sometimes this and sometimes that. Does it, then, make a\ndifference or none at all whether it actively understands the good or\nsome random object? Or are there not certain things that it would be\nabsurd for it to think of? It is clear, therefore, that it actively\nunderstands what is most divine and most estimable and does not change\n[its object], since change would be for the worse, and would already\nbe a sort of movement. First, then, if its substance is not active\nunderstanding but rather a capacity [to understand], \u2026 it is\nclear that something else would be more estimable than the\nunderstanding, namely, what is understood. And indeed [the capacity]\nto understand and active understanding will belong even to someone who\nactively understands the worst thing, so that if this is to be avoided\n(for there are in fact some things that it is better not to see than\nto see), the active understanding would not be the best thing. It is\nitself, therefore, that it understands, if indeed it is the most\nexcellent thing, and the active understanding is active understanding\nof active understanding (h\u00ea no\u00easis\nno\u00ease\u00f4s no\u00easis). (1074b22\u201335)\n\n\nGod is the understanding that understands himself, because his\nunderstanding is like ours would be if we imagine it as being the\nintelligible equivalent of seeing light without seeing any other\nvisible object. From the inside, then, from the point of view of the\nsubject experiencing it, it is a state of consciousness of a sort\nfamiliar from the writings of the great religious mystics, in which\nboth subject and object disappear from an awareness that yet remains\nfully and truly attentive, fully alive and joyous. Insofar as we have\nany experience-based evidence of what a beatific state is like, this\none surely approximates to it. Were we to experience it or something\nlike it, then, there is some reason to think that we would agree that\nit is bliss indeed, blessed happiness unalloyed. This is the\nconclusion Aristotle himself comes to and defends in Nicomachean\nEthics X.6\u20138. Practical wisdom and theoretical wisdom, it\nfollows, have the same ultimate starting-point, the same first\nprinciple, so that wisdom, too, is something unified.\n\nGo back now to the primacy dilemma and notice that its resolution is\nwithin our grasp, though one might be forgiven for not readily\nunderstanding Aristotle\u2019s statement of it in M.10:\n\nThe fact that all scientific knowledge is universal, so that the\nstarting-points of beings must also be universal and not separate\nsubstances, involves the greatest puzzle of those mentioned. But\nthough there is surely a way in which what is said is true, there is\nanother way in which it is not true. For scientific knowledge, like\nknowing scientifically, is twofold, one potential, the other active:\nthe capacity [or potential], being as matter, universal and\nindefinite, is of what is universal and indefinite, whereas the\nactivity, being definite, is of what is definite\u2014being a this\nsomething of a this something. But it is only coincidentally that\nsight sees universal color, because this [particular instance of]\ncolor that it sees is a color, and so what the grammarian\ntheoretically grasps, namely, this [particular instance of] A, is an\nA. For if the starting-points must be universal, what comes from them\nmust also be universal, as in the case of demonstrations. And if this\nis so, there will be nothing separable and no substance either.\nHowever, in one way scientific knowledge is universal, but in another\nit is not. (1087a10\u201325)\n\n\nThe idea is this. Since forms or essences are universals, you and I\nmay both know the same form, as we may both know the letter A. But\nwhen I actively know or contemplate that universal form, what is now\nbefore my mind is a particular: this actualization of that universal.\nNow consider the primary god. He is eternally and essentially the\nobject of the active understanding that he is. So he is a substantial\nparticular. But since he is essentially an activity, he is also a\nuniversal essence of a special sort\u2014one that can only be actual,\nnever merely potential. In a way, then, the primary god overcomes the\ndifference between particulars and universals that seemed\nunbridgeable. For he is at once a concrete particular and the\nstarting-point of all scientific knowledge. He thereby unifies not\njust being, but the scientific knowledge of it as well, insuring that\nthe latter fits the former in the way that realism requires.\n",
