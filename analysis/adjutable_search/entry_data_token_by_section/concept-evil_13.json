    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Affect\n3.4 Evil and Affect\n\nSome theorists believe that a perpetrator\u2019s feelings or emotions at\nthe time of acting are relevant to whether an action is evil. For\nexample, Laurence Thomas believes that evildoers take delight in\ncausing harm or feel hatred toward their victims (Thomas 1993,\n76\u201377. See also Formosa 2019, 264). Hillel Steiner goes even\nfurther by contending that there are just two components of evil:\npleasure and wrongdoing. According to Steiner \u201c[e]vil acts are\nwrong acts that are pleasurable for their doer\u201d (Steiner 2002,\n189).\n\nCritics of Steiner\u2019s view argue that it is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for evil to take pleasure in performing wrongful actions.\nCritics argue that it is not necessary to take pleasure in doing wrong\nto perform an evil action since it is sufficient to intentionally\ncause significant harm for an unworthy goal such as self-interest\n(Calder 2013). Imagine that a serial killer tortures and kills his\nvictims but that he does not take pleasure in torturing and killing.\nIt seems that this serial killer is an evildoer even though he does\nnot take pleasure in doing wrong.\n\nCritics of Steiner\u2019s view argue that it is not sufficient for\nperforming an evil action to take pleasure in performing a wrongful\naction since we would not think that it was evil to take pleasure in\nperforming a wrongful action if the victim did not suffer significant\nharm. For instance, it wouldn\u2019t be evil to take pleasure in\ntelling a white lie (Russell 2007).\n",
