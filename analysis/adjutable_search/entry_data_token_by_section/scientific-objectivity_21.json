    "main_text": "The Unity and Disunity of Scientific Objectivity\n8. Conclusions\n\nSo is scientific objectivity desirable? Is it attainable? That, as we\nhave seen, depends crucially on how the term is understood. We have\nlooked in detail at four different conceptions of scientific\nobjectivity: faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, freedom from\npersonal biases, and features of community practices. In each case,\nthere are at least some reasons to believe that either science cannot\ndeliver full objectivity in this sense, or that it would not be a good\nthing to try to do so, or both. Does this mean we should give up the\nidea of objectivity in science?\n\nWe have shown that it is hard to define scientific objectivity in\nterms of a view from nowhere, value freedom, or freedom from personal\nbias. It is a lot harder to say anything positive about the matter.\nPerhaps it is related to a thorough critical attitude concerning\nclaims and findings, as Popper thought. Perhaps it is the fact that\nmany voices are heard, equally respected and subjected to accepted\nstandards, as Longino defends. Perhaps it is something else\naltogether, or a combination of several factors discussed in this\narticle.\n\nHowever, one should not (as yet) throw out the baby with the\nbathwater. Like those who defend a particular explication of\nscientific objectivity, the critics struggle to explain what makes\nscience objective, trustworthy and special. For instance, our\ndiscussion of the value-free ideal (VFI) revealed that alternatives to\nthe VFI are as least as problematic as the VFI itself, and that the\nVFI may, with all its inadequacies, still be a useful heuristic for\nfostering scientific integrity and objectivity. Similarly, although\nentirely \u201cunbiased\u201d scientific procedures may be\nimpossible, there are many mechanisms scientists can adopt for\nprotecting their reasoning against undesirable forms of bias, e.g.,\nchoosing an appropriate method of statistical inference, being\ntransparent about different stages of the research process and\navoiding certain questionable research practices.\n\nWhatever it is, it should come as no surprise that finding a positive\ncharacterization of what makes science objective is hard. If we knew\nan answer, we would have done no less than solve the problem of\ninduction (because we would know what procedures or forms of\norganization are responsible for the success of science). Work on this\nproblem is an ongoing project, and so is the quest for understanding\nscientific objectivity.\n",
