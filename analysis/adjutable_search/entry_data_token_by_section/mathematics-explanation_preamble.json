    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophical analysis of mathematical explanation concerns itself\nwith two different, although connected, areas of investigation. The\nfirst area addresses the problem of whether mathematics can play an\nexplanatory role in the natural and social sciences. The second deals\nwith the problem of whether mathematical explanation occurs within\nmathematics itself. Accordingly, this entry surveys the contributions\nto both areas, it shows their relevance to the history of philosophy,\nmathematics, and science, it articulates their connection, and points\nto the philosophical pay-offs to be expected by deepening our\nunderstanding of the topic.\n",
