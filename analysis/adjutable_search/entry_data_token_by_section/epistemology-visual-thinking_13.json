    "main_text": "A priori and a posteriori roles of visual experience || A non-evidential use of visual experience\n6.3 A non-evidential use of visual experience\nMust a use of visual experience in knowledge acquisition be\nevidential, if the visual experience is not merely enabling?\nHere is an example which supports a negative answer. Imagine a square\nor look at a drawing of one. Each of its four sides has a\nmidpoint. Now visualize the \u201cinner\u201d square whose sides run\nbetween the midpoints of adjacent sides of the original square (Figure\n17, left).  By visualizing this figure, it should be clear that the\noriginal square is composed precisely of the inner square plus four\ncorner triangles, each side of the inner square being the base of a\ncorner triangle. One can now visualize the corner triangles folding\nover, with creases along the sides of the inner square. The starting\nand end states of the imagery transformation can be represented by the\nleft and right diagrams of Figure 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\nVisualizing the folding-over within the remembered frame of the\noriginal square results in an image of the original square divided\ninto square quarters, its quadrants, and the sides of the inner square\nseem to be diagonals of the quadrants. Many people conclude that the\ncorner triangles can be arranged to cover the inner square exactly,\nwithout any gap or overlap. Thence they infer that the area of the\noriginal square is twice the size of the inner square. Let us assume\nthat the propositions concerned are about Euclidean figures. Our\nconcern is with the visual route to the following:\nThe parts of a square beyond its inner square (formed by\njoining midpoints of adjacent sides of the original square) can be\narranged to fit the inner square exactly, without overlap or gap,\nwithout change of size or shape.\nThe experience of visualizing the corner triangles folding over can\nlead one to this belief. But it cannot provide good evidence for it.\nThis is because visual experience (of sight or imagination) has\nlimited acuity and so does not enable us to discriminate between a\nsituation in which the outer triangles fit the inner square\nexactly and a situation in which they fit inexactly but well\nenough for the mismatch to escape visual detection. (This contrasts\nwith the case of discovering the number of vertices of a cube by\nseeing or visualizing one.) Even though visualizing the square, the\ninner square and then visualizing the corner triangles folding over is\nconstrained by the results of earlier perceptual experience of scenes\nwith relevant similarities, we cannot draw from it reliable\ninformation about exact equality of areas, because perception itself\nis not reliable about exact equalities (or exact proportions) of\ncontinuous magnitudes.\nThough the visual experience could not provide good evidence for\nthe belief, it is possible that we erroneously use the\nexperience evidentially in reaching the belief. But it is also\npossible, when reaching the belief in the way described, that we do\nnot take the experience to provide evidence. A non-evidential\nuse is more likely, if when one arrives at the belief in this way one\nfeels fairly certain of it, while aware that visual perception and\nimagination have limited acuity and so cannot provide evidence for a\nclaim of exact fit.\nBut what could the role of the visualizing experience possibly be,\nif it were neither merely enabling nor evidential? One suggestion is\nthat we already have relevant beliefs and belief-forming dispositions,\nand the visualizing experience could serve to bring to mind the\nbeliefs and to activate the belief-forming dispositions (Giaquinto\n2007). These beliefs and dispositions will have resulted from prior\npossession of cognitive resources, some subject-specific such as\nconcepts of geometrical figures, some subject-general such as symmetry\nperception about perceptually salient vertical and horizontal axes. A\nrelevant prior belief in this case might be that a square is symmetric\nabout a diagonal. A relevant disposition might be the disposition to\nbelieve that the quadrants of a square are congruent squares upon\nseeing or visualizing a square with a horizontal base plus the\nvertical and horizontal line segments joining midpoints of its\nopposite sides.  (These dispositions differ from ordinary perceptual\ndispositions to believe what we see in that they are not cancelled\nwhen we mistrust the accuracy of the visual experience.) \nThe question whether the resulting belief would be knowledge\ndepends on whether the belief-forming dispositions are reliable\n(truth-conducive) and the pre-existing belief states are states of\nknowledge. As these conditions can be met without any violation of\nepistemic rationality, the visualizing route described incompletely\nhere can be a route to knowledge. In that case we would have an\nexample of a use of visual experience which is integral to a way of\nknowing a truth, which is not merely enabling and yet not\nevidential. A fuller account and discussion is given in chapters 3 and\n4 of Giaquinto (2007).\n",
