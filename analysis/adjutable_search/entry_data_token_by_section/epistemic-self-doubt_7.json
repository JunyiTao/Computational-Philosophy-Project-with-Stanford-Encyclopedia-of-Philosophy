    "main_text": "Calibration and Higher-Order Objective Probability || Evidential Calibration\n4.3 Calibration in Higher-Order Probability\n\nAnother approach that sees rationality constraints between the two\norders as based on taking evidence of one\u2019s expected reliability\ninto account derives the constraints top-down from general, widely\nheld, subjective Bayesian assumptions about evidential support, and\nexplicit representation of second-order reliability claims in\nhigher-order objective probability (Roush 2009). Like approach 2 above\nit uses subjective conditional probability to express the match that\nis required between the two orders, but it avoids the consequence we\nsaw in most of those approaches\u2014and in the categorical approach\nand the other calibration approaches just discussed\u2014that a state\nof self-doubt combined with knowledge of one\u2019s beliefs is\nincoherent. Unlike the first two calibration approaches it gives an\nexplanation why calibration is part of rationality; it does this by\nderiving the constraint from another widely accepted assumption, the\nPrincipal Principle.\n\nWe can write a description of the relation of the subject\u2019s\nbelief in q to the way the world is\u2014her\nreliability\u2014as an objective conditional probability:\n\n\nCalibration Curve\n\n\\(\\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x) = y \\) \n\n\nThe objective probability of q given that the subject believes\nq to degree x is y. This is a curve, a function\nthat allows reliability y to vary with the independent variable\nof confidence, x, with different variables used in order to\nallow for the possibility that the subject\u2019s degree of belief\ntends not to match the objective probability, and that the level and\ndirection of mismatch can vary with the level of confidence. The curve\nis specific to proposition q and to the subject whose\nprobability function is P. A subject is calibrated on q,\non this definition, if his calibration curve is the line \\(x =\n y\\).[4]\n\nCalibration curves are widely studied by empirical psychologists who\nfind that human beings\u2019 reliability tends on average to vary\nsystematically and uniformly with confidence, with for example high\nconfidence tending to overconfidence, as in eyewitness testimony.\nDespite the averages found when subjects take tests in controlled\nsettings, the curves also vary with sub-group, individual traits,\nprofessional skills, and particular circumstances. All manner of\nhigher-order evidence about a subject\u2019s belief-forming\nprocesses, methods, circumstances, track-record, and competences are\nrelevant to estimating this function. In real life no one could get\nenough evidence in one lifetime to warrant certainty about an\nindividual\u2019s calibration curve for q in a set of\ncircumstances, but if one is a Bayesian one can form a confidence\nabout what a person\u2019s calibration curve is, or what value it has\nfor some argument x, that is proportional to the strength of\none\u2019s evidence about this, and one can have such a confidence\nabout one\u2019s own calibration curve.\n\nOn this approach epistemic self-doubt is a state where one is\nconfident and more or less correct that one believes q to\ndegree x, that is, \\(P(q) = x\\), but also has an uncomfortably\nhigh level of confidence, say \\(\u2265 .5\\), that one is unreliable\nabout q at that confidence. That is, one has confidence \\(\u2265\n.5\\) that the objective probability of q when one has\nx-level of confidence in q is different from x,\nwhich we would write \\(P(\\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x) \\ne x) \u2265 .5\\). Let us\nsay that the different value is y, so \\(P(\\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x) =\ny) \u2265 .5\\), \\(y \\ne x\\). Whether or not the reason for this\nunreliability is that one tends to mistake evidential support\nrelations and whether one does or does not think a given evidential\nsupport relation obtains, make no general difference to this\nevaluation which is simply about whether one tends to get things right\nwhen doing the sort of thing one did in coming to be confident in\nq to level\n x;[5]\n it is about the relation between one\u2019s confidence and the way\nthings are.\n\nOn this view, a state of self-doubt involves a combination of states\nof the following sort: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(q) & = x\\\\\nP(P(q) = x) & = .99 \\qquad\\textrm{(high)}\\\\\nP(\\PR(q\\mid P(q) = x) = y) & \u2265 .5, \\qquad y \\ne x\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nYou actually believe q to degree x, you are confident\n(say at .99) that you so believe, and you have an uncomfortably high\nlevel of confidence that you are not calibrated for q at\nx, that the objective probability of q when you are\nx confident of q is y. This state escapes\nincoherence for two reasons. One is that one\u2019s confidence either\nabout one\u2019s degree of belief or one\u2019s reliability is not\n1, and unlike some conditional probability formulations of self-doubt\nabove, the slightest uncertainty is enough to make it coherent to\nattribute a large discrepancy between your believed confidence and\nyour believed reliability.\n\nThis is made possible by the second factor, that (un)reliability is\nexpressed here as an objective conditional probability, and coherence\nalone does not dictate how subjective and objective probabilities must\nrelate. This is analogous to the reason that the approach via the\nmaximally rational subject above was able to represent a state of\nself-doubt as coherent, namely, that in evaluating my own P I\ncompare it to a different probability function. However, in this case\nthe second function is not an expert function that declares\nunconditionally what value the maximally rational subject\u2019s\nvalue for q would be, but a calibration function, a conditional\nprobability that tells one what objective probability is indicated by\none\u2019s subjective probability. One difference between the two\napproaches is that there are obvious ways to investigate calibration\ncurves empirically, whereas it would be hard to recruit enough\nmaximally rational subjects for a statistically significant study so\nwe tend to be left appealing to intuitions about what seems\nrational.\n\nOnce the defeating information about the relation of a subject\u2019s\ncredences to the world is expressed in objective probability it can be\nrepresented explicitly as a consideration the subject takes on board\nin assessing the quality of the degree of belief she takes herself to\nhave in q and resolving the question what her degree of belief\nshould be, thus: \n\n\\[\nP(q\\mid P(q)=x \\amp  \\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x)=y) = ? \n\\]\n\n\nThis asks for the degree of belief the subject should have in q\non condition that she actually has degree of belief x in\nq and the objective probability of q given that she has\ndegree of belief x in q is y. This expression is\nthe left-hand side of Self-Respect/Synchronic Reflection with a\nfurther conjunct added to its condition. SR doesn\u2019t specify what\nto do when there is another conjunct and so is not suited to\nexplicitly represent the question of self-doubt, which means that the\nself-doubting examples above are not counterexamples to it (Roush\n2009). However, some in the past have endorsed variants on an\nunrestricted version of SR (Koons 1992; Gaifman 1988) where the value\nof this expression is x regardless of what other conjunct might\nbe present:\n\n\nUnrestricted Self-Respect\n (USR)[6]\n\n\\(P(q\\mid P(q)=x \\amp r) = x\\), for r any proposition \n\n\nDutch book arguments that might give support to SR do not do the same\nfor USR, leaving us with a need to find other ways of evaluating it\nwhen r is the statement of a calibration curve.\n\nIt is not incoherent but it is baldly counterintuitive to suppose that\nthe subject should have degree of belief x when she believes\nthat her so believing is an indicator that the objective probability\nof q is not x, and a principled argument can also be\nmade to this effect (Roush 2009). Unpacking the condition \\(P(q)=x\n\\amp \\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x) = y\\), it seems to say that my credence is\nx and when my credence is x the objective probability is\ny, inviting us to discharge and infer that the objective\nprobability is y. If\n so,[7]\n then the expression would reduce to: \n\n\\[\nP(q\\mid \\PR(q)=y) = ?\n\\]\n\n\nwhich is the left-hand side of a generalization of the Principal\nPrinciple (see entry on\n David Lewis)\n\n\nPrincipal Principle\n (PP)[8]\n\n\\(P(q\\mid Ch(q)=y) = y\\) \n\n\nfrom chance to any type of objective probability. PP says that your\ncredences in propositions should conform to what you take to be their\nchances of being true, and, admissibility issues notwithstanding, it\nis hard to deny that there exists a domain in which the Principal\nPrinciple is compelling, and surely one where the generalization to\nany type of objective probability is too. If so then the answer to the\nquestion what the subject\u2019s credence in q ought to be in\nlight of her consideration of information about her reliability\nis:\n\n\nCal\n\n\\(P(q\\mid (P(q)=x \\amp \\PR(q\\mid P(q)=x)=y)) = y \\) \n\n\nCal says that your credence in q given that your credence in\nq is x and the objective probability of q given\nthat your credence in q is x is y, should be\ny.\n\nCal is a synchronic constraint, but if we revise our credences by\nconditionalization then it implies a diachronic constraint:\n\n\nRe-Cal\n\n\\(P_{n+1}(q) = P_{n}(q\\mid (P_{n}(q)=x \\amp \\PR(q\\mid P_{n}(q)=x)=y))\n= y \\) \n\n\nThis calibration approach tells the subject how to respond to\ninformation about her cognitive impairment in every case. It uses the\ninformation about herself to correct her belief about the world.\nIntuitively it is a graded generalization of the thought that if you\nknew of someone (or yourself) that he invariably had false beliefs,\nthen you could gain a true belief by negating everything he said.\n\nCal and Re-Cal give an explicit characterization of self-doubt and\njustification of a unique and determinate response to it on the basis\nof deeper principles that are compelling independently of the current\ncontext. Cal follows from only two assumptions, first that\nprobabilistic coherence is a requirement of rationality, and second\nthat rationality requires one\u2019s credences to align with what\naccording to one\u2019s evidence are the objective probabilities.\nRe-Cal comes from further assuming that updating our beliefs should\noccur by conditionalization.\n\nAlthough self-doubt under the current definition of it is not an\nincoherent state, Cal implies that rationality always requires a\nresolution of the doubt that brings matching between the two levels,\nand tells us that the matching consists in the alignment of subjective\nand perceived objective probabilities. High confidences in\n\u201cq\u201d, \u201cI have confidence x in\nq\u201d, and \u201cthe objective probability of q when\nI have confidence x in q is low\u201d are not\nincoherent, but they do violate the Principal Principle. Re-Cal tells\nus how to get back in line with PP.\n\nThough Re-Cal has us conditioning on second-order evidence, the\nadjustment it recommends depends on both first- and second-order\nevidence and does not always favor one level or the other. How much\nauthority the second-order claim about the reliability/calibration\ncurve has depends very much on the quality of one\u2019s evidence\nabout it. This can be seen by imagining being uncertain about, e.g.,\none\u2019s calibration curve, i.e., \\(P(\\PR(q\\mid P(q) = x) = y) <\n1\\), and doing a Jeffrey conditionalization version of Re-Cal (Roush\n2017, Other Internet Resources). But even in case one has perfect\nknowledge of one\u2019s calibration curve, the role of the\nfirst-order evidence in determining one\u2019s first-order belief is\nineliminable. The verdict, the level of confidence, that the first\norder gave you for q is the index for determining which point\non the calibration curve is relevant to potentially correcting your\ndegree of belief. To understand why this is far from trivial, recall\nthat the curve can in principle and does often in fact have different\nmagnitudes and directions of distortion at different confidences. The\nverdict\u2019s dependence on the first-order evidential support\nrelation is different from that of EC in another way, since it uses\nnot the objective support relation at the first order but the\nconsequences of the subject\u2019s take on it. Thus, Ana above would\nnot be left not knowing how to make herself rational.\n\nThe fact that the update proceeds by conditionalization means that all\nof the kinds of evaluation of evidence that conditionalization imposes\ncome along with that. Misleading self-doubting defeaters troubled some\nauthors above and led them to level-splitting views, but they are\nhandled by Re-Cal as conditionalization always handles them.\nSelf-doubting defeaters are processed at face value as relevant to the\ncalibration curve in proportion to their quality as evidence.\nConvergence theorems tell us that if the world isn\u2019t\nsystematically deceptive then the misleading defeaters will be washed\nout, that is, defeated by some other evidence, in the long run. In\nsome cases that will happen only long after we\u2019re all dead, but\nif one views that as inadequate then that is a dissatisfaction with\nsubjective Bayesianism, and is not specific to its usage here.\n\nThe approach to epistemic self-doubt in terms of higher-order\nprobability allows the state of self-doubt to be rational (coherent),\nand to be rationally resolved. Cal expresses a requirement of matching\nbetween the two orders in all cases, though it does not imply that\nattributing a mismatch to oneself is incoherent. Neither\norder is always dominant; both orders always make a contribution to\ndetermining the resolution at the first order of conflicts between\norders, and their relative contribution depends on the quality of the\nevidence at each order. Cal and Re-Cal explain why one should revise\nin light of higher-order evidence, when one should, by reference only\nto probabilistic coherence, the Principal Principle, and\nconditionalization. Cal and Re-Cal are general and make available all\nof the resources of the Bayesian framework for analysis of\nhigher-order evidence. A further notable fact about the framework is\nthat Re-Cal allows for cases where news about one\u2019s reliability\nshould increase one\u2019s confidence, which would be appropriate for\nexample in cases, easy to imagine, where one acquired evidence that\none was systematically underconfident. Thus, it is possible\nfor second-order evidence to make it rational to be not only steadfast\nor conciliatory, but even emboldened.\n",
