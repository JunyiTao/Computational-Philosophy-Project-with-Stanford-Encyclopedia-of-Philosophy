    "main_text": "Varieties of Empiricism || Genetic Empiricism\n2.2 Genetic Empiricism\n\nA second form of empiricism is summed up by the Latin slogan nihil\nest in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu (nothing is in\nthe intellect which has not first been in the senses). We can think of\nthis as a genetic empiricism (Lowe 1995: 189), which makes\nclaims about the origins of our ideas. These claims take two forms.\nThe first of these is what we may call tabula rasa (blank\nslate) empiricism, which denies the existence of innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning, holding that both our factual knowledge and\nthe concepts we employ in describing the world are drawn from\nexperience. The modern locus classicus for an empiricism of\nthis kind is the work of John Locke, who famously suggested that the\nmind is originally \u201cwhite paper, void of all characters, without\nany ideas\u201d (Locke Essay 2.1.2). (For the history of\nthis idea, see\n sect. 3.3.3\n and\n sect. 4.1.)\n But it also takes the form of what we may describe as a cognitive\nempiricism. This denies that we have intellectual powers or\ncapacities that can give access to factual knowledge independently of\nexperience.\n\nCognitive empiricism may seem implicit in the tabula rasa\nprinciple that \u201cnothing is in the intellect which has not first\nbeen in the senses.\u201d But the two positions are not identical,\nfor one can deny that we have innate ideas or principles while also\nholding that the mind shapes what the senses provide. As G. W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) would later remark, \u201cnothing is in the\nintellect which was not first in the senses, except for: the intellect\nitself (nisi intellectus ipse)\u201d (Leibniz NE\n1.2). There are two contributions the intellect could make. It could\npredispose us to understand what we perceive in certain ways. Or it\nmay have the capacity to receive a belief-forming influence from an\nexternal source, one not mediated by the senses. (For a medieval\nversion of the latter idea, see\n sect. 4.2.)\n A thorough-going cognitive empiricism would deny the existence of\neither innate dispositions or non-sensory influences in the formation\nof beliefs. It would hold that the mind forms its beliefs by\n\u201cselecting, combining, or otherwise manipulating simple ideas of\nsensation\u201d (Kahn 1981: 407).\n",
