    "main_text": "Religious Diversity in Public Education\n9. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, discussions of religious diversity lend themselves to\nno easy answers. The issues are many, the arguments complex, and the\nresponses varied. It would be hard, though, to overstate the practical\nsignificance of this topic. While some (many) issues that philosophers\ndiscuss have practical implications for how we view ourselves and\ntreat others, none is more relevant today than the question of\nreligious diversity. Religious convictions have not only motivated\nimpassioned behavior in the past\u2014behavior that has affected\nsignificantly the lives of many\u2014such convictions clearly\ncontinue to do so today. So continuing philosophical discussions of\nreligious diversity that clarify issues and assess arguments have the\npotential to be of great practical value.\n",
