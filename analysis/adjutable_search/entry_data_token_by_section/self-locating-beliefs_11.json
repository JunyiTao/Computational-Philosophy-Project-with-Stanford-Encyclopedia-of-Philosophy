    "main_text": "Self-Location in Language\n5. Self-Location in Language\n\nSo far we\u2019ve discussed issues almost entirely within the\nphilosophy of mind. This is no accident\u2014the central motivating\nphenomena for an account of self-locating belief are phenomena in the\nphilosophy of mind, and the theoretical proposals for accommodating\nthose phenomena are proposals in the philosophy of mind (or at least,\nare most centrally proposals in the philosophy of mind). Debates about\nwhether to postulate a distinctive category of self-locating belief,\nand about the best theory of that distinctive category, are debates\nabout the theoretical resources needed to properly characterize\nsubjects\u2019 doxastic states. The arguments we\u2019ve considered\nall maintain that there are mental phenomena\u2014ignorance,\ncognitive similarity or difference, immunity to error\u2014that\nrequire special theoretical treatment featuring a particular category\nof mental states, the distinctively self-locating beliefs.\n\nThough its first home is in the philosophy of mind, self-locating\nbelief has also received much attention in linguistics and the\nphilosophy of language. This is unsurprising, because interesting\nphenomena in the philosophy of mind about belief are likely\nto cast shadows into linguistics and the philosophy of language about\nbelief reports, and the semantics thereof. (Similarly for our\naccounts of other sorts of attitudes, and our accounts of the\nlinguistic devices we use to report them.) There is an extensive\nliterature here, too large and much of it too technical for us to\nsummarize. For some points of entry, see Anand and Nevins (2004),\nAnand (2007), Casta\u00f1eda (1966, 1967), Chierchia (1989), Maier\n(2009), and Feit (2008).\n\nMore specifically, the parts of philosophy of language concerned with\ncommunication\u2014in particular, with the individual or collective\nmental states and attitudes that give rise to, and are produced by or\nupdated in response to, various speech acts\u2014must be sensitive to\nwhat we say about the objects and the structure of those attitudes\nwhen we\u2019re doing philosophy of mind. If our philosophy of mind\nincludes a distinctive category of self-locating belief, that\u2019s\nliable to raise downstream questions in the philosophy of language,\nabout (for example) how self-locating beliefs are (or are not)\nimplicated in the production of various speech acts, how interlocutors\nupdate their self-locating beliefs (or don\u2019t) in response to\nvarious speech acts, and about the place of self-locating beliefs in\nspeakers\u2019 communicative intentions or in the conversational\ncommon ground.\n\nThe first thing to note here is that there pretty clearly are\nsome self-locating communicative phenomena. (Or at least, it\u2019s\npretty clear that if there are self-locating beliefs, then there are\nsome self-locating communicative phenomena.)\n\nIf you grant the existence of self-locating beliefs, then it\u2019s\nclear that people can systematically and predictably give voice to\ntheir self-locating beliefs by using the right sentences of natural\nlanguage. For example, when Muhammad Ali says \u201cI am the\ngreatest\u201d, he\u2019s giving voice to a particular self-locating\nbelief\u2014what Lewis will characterize as a self-attribution of\nbeing the greatest, and what Perry will characterize as being\nin the \u201cI am the greatest\u201d belief-state. Similarly when I\ncall the friend I\u2019m supposed to be meeting at the bar and say,\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty clear that people can systematically and\npredictably produce self-locating beliefs in their interlocutors by\nusing the right sentences of natural language. For example, consider\nstandard uses of \u201cit\u2019s your turn\u201d. This utterance\nproduces in one\u2019s interlocutor the state Lewis would\ncharacterize as self-attributing having the next turn, and\nwhich Perry would characterize as being in the \u201cit\u2019s my\nturn\u201d belief-state. Similarly for \u201cyou are Rudolph\nLingens\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d, or\n\u201cyou\u2019re muted\u201d.\n\nThe central philosophical issue about self-locating communication is\nthat, while there pretty clearly is some self-locating\ncommunication, a model of communication that seems obvious and natural\nwhen we\u2019re dealing with non-self-locating belief doesn\u2019t\nstraightforwardly generalize to the self-locating case. We\u2019ll\nstart by looking at some examples of self-locating communication, then\npresent the model of communication that\u2019s so appealing when\nwe\u2019re not working with self-locating belief. Then we\u2019ll\ndiscuss why that model doesn\u2019t generalize, and finally lay out a\nselection of responses presently on offer in the literature.\n",
