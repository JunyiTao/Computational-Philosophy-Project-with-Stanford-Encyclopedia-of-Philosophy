    "main_text": "The Modern St. Petersburg Paradox\n2. The Modern St. Petersburg Paradox\n\nCram\u00e9r\u2019s remark about the agent\u2019s decreasing\nmarginal utility of money solves the original version of the St.\nPetersburg paradox. However, modern decision theorists agree that this\nsolution is too narrow. The paradox can be restored by increasing the\nvalues of the outcomes up to the point at which the agent is fully\ncompensated for her decreasing marginal utility of money (see Menger\n1934 [1979]). The version of the St. Petersburg paradox discussed in\nthe modern literature can thus be formulated as follows:\n\n\nA fair coin is flipped until it comes up heads. At that point the\nplayer wins a prize worth \\(2^n\\) units of utility on the\nplayer\u2019s personal utility scale, where n is the number of\ntimes the coin was flipped.\n\n\nNote that the expected utility of this gamble is infinite even if the\nagent\u2019s marginal utility of money is decreasing. We can leave it\nopen exactly what the prizes consists of. It need not be money.\n\nIt is worth stressing that none of the prizes in the St. Petersburg\ngame have infinite value. No matter how many times the coin is\nflipped, the player will always win some finite amount of\nutility. The expected utility of the St. Petersburg game\nis not finite, but the actual outcome will always be finite.\nIt would thus be a mistake to dismiss the paradox by arguing that no\nactual prizes can have infinite utility. No actual infinities are\nrequired for constructing the paradox, only potential ones. (For a\ndiscussion of the distinction between actual and potential infinities,\nsee Linnebo and Shapiro 2019.) In discussions of the St. Petersburg\nparadox it is often helpful to interpret the term \u201cinfinite\nutility\u201d as \u201cnot finite\u201d but leave it to\nphilosophers of mathematics to determine whether it is or\nmerely approaches infinity.\n\nSome authors have discussed exactly what is problematic with the claim\nthat the expected utility of the modified St. Petersburg game is\ninfinite (read: not finite). Is it merely the fact that the fair price\nof the wager is \u201ctoo high\u201d, or is there something else\nthat prompts the worry? James M. Joyce notes that \n\n\na wager of infinite utility will be strictly preferred to any\nof its payoffs since the latter are all finite. This is absurd given\nthat we are confining our attention to bettors who value wagers only\nas means to the end of increasing their fortune. (Joyce 1999: 37)\n\n\nJoyce\u2019s point seems to be that an agent who pays the fair price\nof the wager will know for sure that she will actually be\nworse off after she has paid the fee. However, this seems to\npresuppose that actual infinities do exist. If only potential\ninfinities exist, then the player cannot \u201cpay\u201d an infinite\nfee for playing the game. If so, we could perhaps interpret Joyce as\nreminding us that no matter what finite amount the player actually\nwins, the expected utility will always be higher, meaning that it\nwould have been rational to pay even more. Russell and Isaacs\n(2021:179) offer a slightly different analysis. Their point is that\n\u201chowever much the St. Petersburg gamble is worth, no particular\noutcome could be worth exactly that much\u201d. This is\nbecause the St. Petersburg gamble is worth more than any finite\noutcome, but less than something worth infinitely much.\n\n\nIs the St. Petersburg gamble perhaps worth something like an infinite\namount of money? No. The St. Petersburg gamble is sure to pay only a\nfinite amount of money. Suppose there is something which is worth\nmore than each finite amount of money\u2013such as an\ninfinite amount of money (whatever that might come to), or a priceless\nartwork, or true love. If [the agent] has something like that, then\nthe prospect of keeping it (with certainty) will dominate\ngiving it up in exchange for the St. Petersburg gamble; thus the St.\nPetersburg gamble is not worth so much. Of course, nothing is worth\nmore than each finite amount of money, yet not worth more\nthan every finite amount of money. So the conclusion of [the\nagent\u2019s] reasoning is that nothing she could bid\u2013monetary\nor otherwise\u2013would be the right price. (Russell and Isaacs\n2021:179)\n\n\nDecisions theorists wish to clarify a means-ends notion of\nrationality, according to which it is rational to do whatever is the\nbest means to one\u2019s end. The player thus knows that paying more\nthan what one actually wins cannot be the best means to the\nend of maximizing utility. But always being forced to pay too little\nis also problematic, because then the seller would \u201cpay\u201d\ntoo much (that is, receive too little). So at least one agent will be\nirrational and pay too much unless we can establish a fair price of\nthe gamble. This observation enables us to strengthen the original\n\u201cparadox\u201d (in which no formal contradiction is derived)\ninto a stronger version consisting of three incompatible claims:\n\n The amount of utility it is rational to pay for\nplaying (or selling the right to play) the St. Petersburg game is\nhigher than every finite amount of utility.\n The buyer knows that the actual amount of utility he\nor she will actually receive is finite.\n It is not rational to knowingly pay more for\nsomething than one will receive.\n\n\nMany discussions of the St. Petersburg paradox have focused on\n (1).\n As we will see in the next couple of sections, many scholars argue\nthat the value of the St. Petersburg game is, for one reason or\nanother, finite. A rare exception is H\u00e1jek and Nover. They\noffer the following argument for accepting\n (1):\n\n\nThe St Petersburg game can be regarded as the limit of a sequence of\ntruncated St Petersburg games, with successively higher finite\ntruncation points\u2014for example, the game is called off if heads\nis not reached by the tenth toss; by the eleventh toss; by the\ntwelveth toss;\u2026. If we accept dominance reasoning, these\nsuccessive truncations can guide our assessment of the St Petersburg\ngame\u2019s value: it is bounded below by each of their values, these\nbounds monotonically increasing. Thus we have a principled reason for\naccepting that it is worth paying any finite amount to play the St\nPetersburg game. (H\u00e1jek and Nover 2006: 706)\n\n\nAlthough they do not explicitly say so, H\u00e1jek and Nover would\nprobably reject\n (3).\n The least controversial claim is perhaps (2). It is, of course,\nlogically possible that the coin keeps landing tails\nevery time it is flipped, even though an infinite sequence of\ntails has probability 0. (For a discussion of this possibility, see\nWilliamson 2007.) Some events that have probability 0 do actually\noccur, and in uncountable probability spaces it is impossible that all\noutcomes have a probability greater than 0. Even so, if the coin keeps\nlanding tails every time it is flipped, the agent wins 0\nunits of utility. So\n (2)\n would still hold true.\n",
