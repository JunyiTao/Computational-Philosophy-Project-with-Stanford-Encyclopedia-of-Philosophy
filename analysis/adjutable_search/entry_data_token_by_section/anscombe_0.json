    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nShe was born in Limerick, Ireland 18 March 1919 to Allen Wells\nAnscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Anscombe (n\u00e9e Thomas). At the\ntime of her birth her father was serving in the British Army. The\nfamily later returned to England where her father resumed his career\nas a schoolmaster, while her mother, a classical scholar, worked as a\nheadmistress.\n\nAn inquisitive child, Anscombe decided to convert to Roman Catholicism\nin her early teens. She attended the Sydenham School, graduating in\n1937, and went on to St. Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford. During her\nearly years at Oxford she met three young women who also had\nremarkable careers in philosophy: Iris Murdoch, Mary Midgley, and,\nabove all, Philippa Foot, with whom she developed a deep friendship\nher entire life (Mac Cumhaill & Wiseman 2022). Anscombe received a\nFirst in Literae Humaniores (Classics and Philosophy) in 1941. After\nher graduation she remained at St. Hugh\u2019s as a research student,\nand in 1942 moved to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she met Ludwig\nWittgenstein. She believed that attending Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlectures freed her from the trap of phenomenalism that had so plagued\nher (MPM, ix). In 1946 she was offered a Research Fellowship at\nSomerville College, Oxford, and was appointed to a teaching Fellowship\nthere in 1964. She moved from Oxford to Cambridge in 1970 when she was\nawarded a Chair of Philosophy at Cambridge \u2013 the Chair formerly\noccupied by Wittgenstein. She remained at Cambridge until her\nretirement in 1986.\n\nIn 1938, at Oxford, she met the philosopher Peter Geach, who then was\nstudying at Balliol. They were both receiving instruction from the\nsame Dominican priest. They were married in 1941, and had three sons\nand four daughters.\n\nIn 1948, the young Anscombe read a paper [CSL] to the Socratic Club\nattacking an argument offered by C. S. Lewis in his book\nMiracles. In Chapter 3 of that book Lewis argued that\nnaturalism is self-refuting. Lewis attended her talk, and, although\naccounts vary, some acquaintances report that he was crushed by her\nwithering criticism. In any case, Lewis significantly rewrote the\nrelevant chapter in the subsequent edition of his book.\n\nAnscombe also became one of Wittgenstein\u2019s good friends and\nthen, after his death in 1951, the chief translator of his work into\nEnglish. Ray Monk wrote that Anscombe was \u201c\u2026one of\nWittgenstein\u2019s closest friends and one of his most trusted\nstudents, an exception to his general dislike of academic women and\nespecially of female philosophers.\u201d (Monk 1991, 498).\n\nAnscombe did not avoid controversy. In 1956 she publicly opposed\nOxford University\u2019s decision to award an honorary degree to\nHarry Truman, whom she considered a murderer for intentionally killing\nthe civilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. She also courted\ncontroversy by coming out in print against contraception (see below),\nand engaging in civil disobedience at abortion clinics.\n\nAnscombe famously flouted gender conventions: she did not take her\nhusband\u2019s name, she frequently wore men\u2019s clothes, she\nsmoked cigars, and she was prone to cursing and vulgar speech.\nAlthough influenced by several men \u2013 Frege, Wittgenstein, Geach,\nvarious Catholic thinkers historical and contemporaneous \u2013\nAnscombe was a fiercely independent and original philosopher. Those\nwho suspect she merely echoed or applied the views of another person\nare sorely mistaken.\n\nAnscombe continued to produce original work beyond her retirement.\nPeter Geach, for example, reported in Analysis that she had\nconstructed a novel paradox late in life (Geach 2006,\n266\u20137).\n\nAnscombe died in Cambridge on 5 January 2001.\n",
