    "main_text": "Applications || Mathematics and Computer Science\n5.3 Computational Metaphysics and Artificial Intelligence\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory is a Classical logic, but topical\napplications in philosophy and artificial intelligence often require\nexpressive non-classical logics. In order to support such applications\nwith reasoning tools for Church\u2019s type theory, the shallow\nsemantical embedding technique (see also\n Section 1.2.2)\n has been developed that generalizes and extends the ideas underlying\nthe well known standard translation of modal logics to first-order\nlogic. The technique was applied for the assessment of modern variants\nof the ontological argument with a range of higher-order theorem\nprovers, including LEO-II, Satallax, Nitpick and Isabelle/HOL. In the\ncourse of experiments, LEO-II detected an inconsistency in the\npremises of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument, while the provers succeeded\nin automatically proving Scott\u2019s emendation of it and to confirm\nthe consistency of the emended premises. More details on this work are\npresented in a related SEP entry on\n automated reasoning\n (see Section 4.6 on Logic and Philosophy). The semantical embedding\napproach has been adapted and further extended for a range of other\nnon-classical logics and related applications. In philosophy this\nincludes the encoding and formal assessment of ambitious ethical and\nmetaphysical theories, and in artificial intelligence this includes\nthe mechanization of deontic logics and normative reasoning as well as\nan automatic proof of the\n muddy children puzzle (see Appendix B of dynamic epistemic logic),\n which is a famous puzzle in epistemic reasoning, respectively dynamic\nepistemic reasoning.\n",
