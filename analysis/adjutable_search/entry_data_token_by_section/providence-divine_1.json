    "main_text": "The Free Will Defense\n2. The Free Will Defense\n\nIt may be possible to minimize God\u2019s involvement in the evil of\nthe universe. That is the aim of what is perhaps the most prominent\nstrategy employed in recent theodicy, which is based on the concept of\nfree will, and its importance in the plan of creation. The free will\ndefense begins by distinguishing two kinds of evil. Moral\nevil is evil that occurs through rational action \u2014 that is,\nthrough wrongful exercises of will on the part of rational beings.\nNatural evil, by contrast, is owing entirely to the operation\nof natural causes. To see how this distinction works, we need to\nrealize that moral evil can itself be divided into several categories.\nFirst come exercises of will that are sinful in themselves, and these\nare of two kinds. They include wrongful acts of intention formation,\nas when one maliciously decides to kill another, and the volitional\nactivity through which we execute wrong intentions \u2014 e.g., the\neffort of will aimed at carrying out the intention to murder. The\nmoral wrong of these exercises of will is intrinsic to them.\nThey are sinful in themselves, and would be so even if, through some\nfortuitous circumstance, the attempt to kill went awry, and the\nintended victim was not harmed at all. Suppose, however, that the\naction succeeds, as it does in most instances of wrongful willing. If\nso, further evil will occur \u2014 in the present case, the death of\nthe victim. Now if the victim had died entirely as a result of natural\ncauses, his death would have counted as a natural evil. In this case,\nhowever, it counts as a kind of moral evil, for while its occurrence\nrequires the cooperation of natural causes, those causes are set in\nmotion by the killer\u2019s volitional activity. Harm and suffering\nthat are caused by wrongful willing count as extrinsic moral\nevil, in that they are caused by acts of will that are morally evil in\nthemselves, or intrinsically.\n\nThe significance and pervasiveness of extrinsic moral evil is easy to\nunderestimate, because a lot of the suffering and hardship that\nbelongs in this category tends to masquerade as merely part of the\nhuman condition, and hence as natural evil. But it is not so. Many of\nthe hardships that befall humankind \u2014 disease, ignorance,\npoverty and the like \u2014 owe their existence at least in part to\nwrongful willing. The poverty of some is owing to the greed of others;\nsuffering and deprivation may occur because of institutionalized\nracial and ethnic hatred, or because leaders use their positions to\nadvance their own power and prosperity at the expense of their\ncitizenry, or simply because the cost of defense against foreign\nenemies brings economic hardship to a nation or some of its members.\nIn other cases the cause is sheer laziness, or the fact that time and\ntalent that might have been devoted to good are instead consumed by\nselfish ends. Who can estimate how much of suffering and disease, of\npoverty and ignorance, or of the threat posed by natural disasters\nwould by now have been conquered were not so much of our energy and\nresources diverted either to the pursuit of wrongful goals, or to\nguarding ourselves against those who do pursue them, and mending as\nwell as we can the harm they cause? If human wills were not so often\nmisdirected, human life would be transformed, and the struggles\nagainst those evils that seem to us no one\u2019s fault much further\nadvanced. A great deal, then, of what we are likely to view as natural\nevil actually falls under the heading of extrinsic moral evil.\n\nThat all of sin and so much of suffering counts as moral evil is\nadvantageous to free will theodicy, for according to the free will\ndefense moral evil is not to be blamed upon God. It is entirely our\nfault \u2014 that is, entirely the fault of rational beings who\nemploy their wills to pursue evil. This is because we have free\nwill, which is to be understood here in what is known as the\nlibertarian sense. We exercise libertarian freedom in forming\nor executing an intention only if our deciding or willing is not the\nproduct of deterministic causation \u2014 that is, provided there is\nno set of conditions independent of our exercise of will which,\ntogether with scientific law, make it certain that we shall decide or\nwill as we do. Independent conditions \u2014 our motives and beliefs,\nfor example \u2014 may incline us toward one or another intention or\naction. But they cannot guarantee it, because what we decide and what\nwe strive to achieve is finally up to us. Were it not so, we could not\nbe held accountable for our actions. We would be no more responsible\nthan someone who acted out of a psychological compulsion such as\nkleptomania, or who was a victim of addiction, hypnosis or the\nlike.\n\nGiven the nature of libertarian freedom, then, our actions are up to\nus, in that they are not brought about by independent events. And\nbecause this is so, according to free will theodicy, moral evil is\nentirely our fault. God is not to be blamed for it, because it owes\nits existence to our wills, not to his (Plantinga 1974, 30). God is,\nof course, responsible for the risk he takes in creating a world that\ncontains beings with free will. But proponents of the free will\ndefense can point to two reasons that could justify God in populating\nthe universe with such creatures. First, they are an enhancement to\ncreation. Creatures with free will are sources of spontaneity in the\nworld, able to choose for themselves the principles by which their\nconduct will be guided. As such, they display the kind of liberty we\ntake God himself to have, and so are made in the image of their\ncreator (Swinburne 1998, 106). Second, God endows us with this power\nbecause he desires creatures who will accept him freely, who will love\nand obey him not because they are programmed to do so, but as a matter\nof spontaneous choice. That we should come to love God in this way is\nfar more satisfactory than that we should be driven to accept him. As\nin strictly human affairs, forced affection is a pale substitute for\nlove voluntarily bestowed. But, the argument goes, God cannot endow us\nwith free will without running the risk that some of us, at least,\nwill turn against him, and use our freedom to seek evil ends. True,\nsuch ends are usually not achieved unless nature, which is God\u2019s\ncreation, cooperates. The bullet could not find its mark or the poison\nbe effective unless the relevant natural laws stayed in place. In\nprinciple, then, God could allow us free choice and yet prevent any\nchoice that is evil from having its intended outcome. But freedom\nwould be a sham if an evil will could never have its way, and the\nlocus of sin lies not in the consequences of evil willing but in the\nwilling itself. Moreover, even though the harm we cause through our\nactions requires God\u2019s cooperation, it too would not occur but\nfor our choosing and willing as we do. The price of freedom, then, is\nmoral evil. But moral evil is to be laid at our doorstep, not\nGod\u2019s, for it is we who choose it. God merely permits our\nchoices and makes them efficacious. In this he is justified, first\nbecause of the good of there being free creatures in the universe, and\nsecond because some, and perhaps many or even all, of these creatures\nwill come to enjoy God\u2019s eternal friendship, by choosing freely\nto love and serve him.\n\nThe free will defense does not, in most formulations, attempt a\ncomplete solution to the problem of evil. It deals only with moral\nevil, and although we have seen that this category covers more than\nmight at first be supposed, it certainly does not appear that all of\nthe sorrows and failures of the world can be gathered under it. Even\nif the free will defense succeeds then, there will remain a residuum\nof natural evil to be addressed. It may, however, be questioned\nwhether the defense succeeds even in the limited project it\nundertakes. One criticism of it raises a question about the relation\nbetween creaturely freedom and God\u2019s activity as creator. J. L.\nMackie has argued that if God is truly all-powerful, he ought to have\nbeen able to create creatures who possessed free will, but who never\ndid wrong (1955, 209). If that were possible, then we would have had a\nuniverse free of moral evil, even though it contained creatures with\nfree will. Perhaps the sinful populace that presently inhabits the\nworld would have lost out on such a scenario: maybe God would have had\nto create an entirely different crowd. Still, moral evil would have\nbeen banished, and the condition of the world doubtless vastly\nimproved. But could God have exerted such control over creation?\nProponents of the free will defense have tended to think not. In order\nfor God to provide creatures with meaningful freedom, they argue, God\nmust relinquish control over how that freedom is exercised. Were it\nnot so, libertarian freedom would be destroyed: our decisions and\nactions would not finally be up to us, but would instead be\nmanipulated by God (Plantinga 1974, 41\u201342; Flint 1998,\n84\u201390). Even if they were exempt from natural causation, they\nwould still be determined by God\u2019s will, and so would be unfree.\nIndeed, the argument runs, it would be logically impossible for God to\ncreate creatures possessed of libertarian freedom, and at the same\ntime have the operations of their will fall under his creative\nfiat. Now it is not usually considered a failure of\nomnipotence for God to be unable to do what is logically impossible.\nWe need not, therefore, relinquish the claim that God is all-powerful.\nRather, the theist concludes, Mackie is simply mistaken in thinking\nsuch a God could create free creatures with a guarantee that they\nwould never sin.\n\nIt should be pointed out that in giving this response, proponents of\nthe free will defense are making an important assumption about the\nrelationship between God\u2019s will as creator and ours as creatures\n\u2014 namely, that God\u2019s will operates in the same way natural\ncauses do. That is, his fiat as creator counts as an\nindependent condition or event, which causes the occurrence of what he\nwills in just the way natural causes produce their effects. So if, as\ncreator, God wills that I decide to attend a concert this evening,\nthen my decision to do so is causally determined, just as it would be\nhad I been driven to it by an insatiable desire for Beethoven.\nOtherwise, we would not have a violation of the criterion for\nlibertarian free will given earlier. Now we shall eventually see that\nthis model of the relation between God\u2019s will and the world is\nat best unlikely, but let us suppose for now that the theist\u2019s\nanswer to Mackie\u2019s complaint stands. Is the free will defense\nthen successful? Again, it seems not, for the antitheist can still\nraise two complaints, and these amount to two challenges that any\ntheory of providence which desires to avail itself of the free will\ndefense must overcome.\n\nFirst, he may argue, even if the free will defense does not violate\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, it still violates his sovereignty. If God\nwere fully sovereign over the universe his rule would be complete. All\nthat occurs would be under his direct control, down to the smallest\ndetail. According to the free will defense, however, this is not so.\nRather, as we have just seen, proponents of this kind of theodicy\ninsist that some of what goes on in the world is not under God\u2019s\ncontrol, but under that of his creatures. To be sure, God need not\nhave created free beings, and when they engage in sinful willing he\ncan always thwart their ends by manipulating natural causes. But he\ncannot stop them from sinning (or, for that matter, from willing\nwell), for both of these lie with the will itself. So in creating free\ncreatures God relinquishes part of his sovereignty over the universe\n(Mackie 1955, 209\u201310; Flint 1998, 84\u201385). Furthermore,\nunless God regularly interferes with his creatures achieving their own\nobjectives\u2014that is, unless he deprives them of a meaningful and\nefficacious freedom\u2014his own objectives in creating the universe\nare likely to be thwarted. However great a good it may be to have in\nthe universe creatures who exercise libertatian freedom, this would\nseem a high and unseemly price for an otherwise sovereign God to pay\nfor their existence.\n\nSecond, the antitheist may argue, the free will defense violates\ndivine omniscience. For if I possess libertarian freedom, then whether\nI decide to go to the concert tonight is neither under God\u2019s\ndirect control nor controlled by natural causes. And if that is the\ncase then God has no way of knowing what I will decide. Like anyone,\nhe can make a lucky guess: he may believe devoutly that I will decide\nto attend the concert, and that may turn out to be correct. But lucky\nguesses do not count as knowledge. Knowledge requires reasons, and God\ncan have no satisfactory reason for his belief, if by\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d we understand what the infallible\nomniscience usually attributed to him would require \u2014 namely, a\nreason that guarantees correctness. Rather, like any observer, God\nmust wait to learn what my decision will be in order to be sure of it.\nBut then throughout the time prior to my act, God is not omniscient.\nThere is a truth about the future that he does not know. Thus, the\nantitheist may conclude, the free will defense is in fact a failure.\nIt exonerates God from direct responsibility for sin, but it does so\nonly by surrendering part of God\u2019s sovereignty, and by making\nhim fail, as creator, to be omniscient.\n",
