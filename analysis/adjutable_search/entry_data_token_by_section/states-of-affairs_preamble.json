    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophers connect sentences with various different items, such as\nthoughts, facts and states of affairs. Thoughts are either\ntrue or false in an absolute sense, never both or neither. A sentence\nsuch as \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d is true (false) in virtue of\nexpressing the true (false) thought that Socrates is wise. Thoughts\nare also the contents of propositional attitudes like belief and\ndesire. For example, John\u2019s belief that Vulcan is a planet is a\nrelation between him and the thought that Vulcan is a planet. Since\nthere is no such planet, the thought that Vulcan is a planet cannot be\ncomposed of Vulcan and the property of being a planet. It is\ncomposed, among other things, of a way of thinking that purports to\nlatch on to a planet. This so-called mode of presentation may be\nexpressed by a definite description like \u201cthe planet between the\nSun and Mercury\u201d.\n\nSome philosophers take it to be obvious that if something is true,\nthere must be something that makes it true, a truth-maker.\nFacts are truth-makers. Like sentences and thoughts, facts\nare taken to be complex objects. The constituents of (atomic) facts\nare not words or modes of presentation, but particulars and properties\n(see, for instance, Armstrong 1986: 85). The fact that Socrates is\nwise exists if, and only if Socrates is wise.\n\nFacts may be required in the theory of truth-making. States of\naffairs, by contrast, are supposed to pull their weight in the\nmetaphysics of modality. According to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus, the totality of states of\naffairs exhausts the space of possibilities; the totality of states of\naffairs that obtain are the (actual) world. More recently, Alvin\nPlantinga (1974, 44) and Pollock (1984, 52) have posited in their\nmetaphysics of possible worlds states of affairs that exists whether\nthey obtain or not.\n\nBefore pressing on, a note about terminology: many philosophers follow\nArmstrong\u2019s (1993: 429) terminology who uses \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d to refer to facts. (Armstrong\u2019s book A World\nof States of Affairs is solely concerned with facts.) This\narticle is not devoted to \u201cArmstrongian\u201d states\nof affairs, but to states of affairs in the sense that is prominent in\nthe work of such philosophers as Husserl, Reinach, Russell (at one\ntime), the early Wittgenstein and\n Plantinga.[1]\n Hereafter, \u201cstates of affairs\u201d is used only for states of\naffairs that exist whether they obtain or not.\n\nStates of affairs are similar to thoughts. Thoughts are true or false;\nstates of affairs obtain or not. There are also similarities between\nfacts and states of affairs. Both facts and states of affairs are\nsupposed to be complexes that contain (in a sense to be explained\nfurther) objects and properties.\n\nDoes one need states of affairs in addition to facts and thoughts? In\norder to answer this question we need to know what states of affairs\nare and how they contrast and compare with thoughts and facts. We\ntherefore begin by outlining the theoretical role states of affairs\nare supposed to play.\n",
