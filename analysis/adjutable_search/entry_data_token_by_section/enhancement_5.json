    "main_text": "What are the Proper Limits of Health Care? || Disease-Based Accounts\n2.3 Disease-Based Accounts\nProbably the most common rejoinder to the problem of prevention is\nto distinguish the problems to which they respond. Treatments are\ninterventions that address the health problems created by diagnosable\ndiseases and disabilities\u2014\u201cmaladies\u201d in the helpful\nlanguage of Gert, Culver and Clouser (2006). Enhancements, on the\nother hand, are interventions aimed at healthy systems and\ntraits. Thus, prescribing biosynthetic growth hormone to rectify a\ndiagnosable growth hormone deficiency is legitimate treatment, while\nprescribing it for patients with normal growth hormone levels would be\nan attempt at \u201cpositive genetic engineering\u201d or\nenhancement (Berger and Gert 1991). On this account, to justify an\nintervention as appropriate medicine means to be able to identify a\nmalady in the patient. If no medically recognizable malady can be\ndiagnosed, the intervention cannot be \u201cmedically\nnecessary\u201d and is thus suspect as an enhancement. This would\nclear the way for safe and effective genetic \u201cvaccines\u201d\nagainst predictable muscle damage (even if they provided better than\nnormal damage resistance) but would screen out as\n\u201cenhancements\u201d efforts to improve traits that were at no\ndiagnosable risk of deterioration (Juengst 1997).\nThese accounts have the advantage of being simple, intuitively\nappealing, and consistent with a lot of biomedical behavior. Maladies\nare objectively observable phenomena and the traditional target of\nmedical intervention. We can know maladies through diagnosis, and we\ncan tell that we have gone beyond medicine when no pathology can be\nidentified. Thus, pediatric endocrinologists discourage enhancement\nuses of biosynthetic growth hormone by citing the old adage \u201cIf\nit ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d. This interpretation is\nalso at work in the efforts of professionals working at the boundary,\nlike cosmetic surgeons, to justify their services. They claim to be\nrelieving \u201cdiagnosable\u201d psychological suffering\n(\u201cmental maladies\u201d) rather than satisfying the aesthetic\ntastes of their clients, and insurance companies insist on being\nprovided with that diagnosis before providing coverage for such\nsurgeries.\nOn the other hand, disease-based accounts also face at least two\nmajor difficulties. The first is one they share with the Professional\nDomain account: the problem of biomedicine\u2019s infamous nosological\nelasticity. It is not hard to coin new maladies for the purposes of\njustifying the use of enhancement interventions (Carey, Melvin and\nRanney 2008). Unless some specific (and usually contentious) theory\nof disease is employed to give this approach its teeth, it puts the\npower for drawing the boundary back into the profession\u2019s hands,\nand raises the same worries about the social consequences of\nmedicalization (Parens 2013).\nThe more important practical problem is that no matter how the line\nis drawn, most biotechnological interventions that could be seen as\nproblematic if used as enhancements will not need to be justified as\nenhancements in order to be developed and approved for clinical use.\nThis is because most such interventions will also have legitimate\ntherapeutic applications. Indeed, most biomedical tools with potential\nfor enhancement uses will first emerge as therapeutic agents. For\nexample, general cognitive enhancement interventions are likely to be\napproved for use only in patients with neurological diseases. However,\nto the extent that they are in high demand by individuals suffering the\neffects of normal aging, the risk of unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses\nwill be high (Whitehouse, et. al, 1997).\nThis last point is critical for policy purposes, because it suggests\nthat, in countries like the USA, the real challenge may not be\nregulation of the development of enhancement interventions, but rather\nthe regulation of downstream \u201coff-label\u201d uses of\ntherapeutic interventions for non-medical, enhancement purposes. The\npolicy problems then become problems about controlling access and use\nof certain interventions, rather than their development. Of course, the\nfact that a certain type of intervention is declared illegal for\nphysicians to dispense, does not immediately imply that it should be\nimmoral for everyone to pursue or other competent professionals to\nprovide. These realities have pressed those who would use the\ntreatment/enhancement distinction for policy purposes to articulate the\nmoral dangers of biomedical enhancement more clearly. Even if doctors\neschew such use on professional ethical grounds, are there independent\nmoral reasons why individual athletes, parents, students or other\n\u201cconsumers\u201d of enhancement interventions, should turn away\nfrom their availability?\n",
