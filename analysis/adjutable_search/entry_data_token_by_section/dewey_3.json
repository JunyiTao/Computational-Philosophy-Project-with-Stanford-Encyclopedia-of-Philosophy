William James\u2019s tour de force, The Principles of\nPsychology (1890), modeled how he might explain the conscious and\nintelligent self without appeals to a transcendental Absolute. As\nDewey recalled, Principles\u2019 emphatically biological\nconception of mind gave his thinking \u201ca new direction and\nquality\u201d and \u201cworked its way more and more into all my\nideas and acted as a ferment to transform old beliefs\u201d\n(FAE, LW5: 157). Rather than measuring psychic phenomena\nagainst preexisting abstractions, James showed how one might employ a\n\u201cradical empiricism\u201d that starts from the phases and\nelements of actual, lived experience. The goal would be to understand\nexperience\u2019s functional origins from a perspective that was,\ntypically, coherent and whole.\n\nOne expression of Dewey\u2019s early psychology (and Jamesean turn)\nwas his seminal critique of the reflex arc concept (1896), written at\nChicago. The \u201creflex arc\u201d model of behavior was an\nincreasingly influential way to explain human behavior empirically and\nexperimentally using stimulus-response (cause-effect) pairings; it\nsought to displace other, less observable and testable approaches that\nrelied upon \u201cpsychic entities\u201d or \u201cmental\nsubstance\u201d. In the reflex arc model, a passive organism\nencounters an external stimulus causing a sensory and motor response;\nfor example, a child sees a candle (stimulus), grasps it (response),\nburns her hand (stimulus), and pulls her hand back (response). This,\nit argued, makes explicit the event\u2019s basic stimuli and\nresponses, replete with connections satisfactorily describable in\nmechanistic and physiological terms\u2014and all without recourse to\nmysterious and unobservable entities.\n\nDewey criticized the reflex arc framework on several grounds. First,\nevents (sensory stimulus, central response, and act) are artificially\nseparated for the purpose of analysis. \u201cThe reflex arc\u201d,\nDewey wrote, \u201cis not a comprehensive, or organic unity, but a\npatchwork of disjointed parts, a mechanical conjunction of unallied\nprocesses\u201d (RAC, EW5: 97). Second, the model falsifies\nthe nature of genuine interaction; organisms do not passively\nreceive stimuli and then actively respond; rather, organisms\ncontinuously interact with environments in cumulative and\nmodifying ways. The child who encounters a candle is already\nactively exploring, anticipating a room, for example; noticing the\nflame modifies already ongoing actions. \u201cThe real\nbeginning is with the act of seeing; it is looking, and not a\nsensation of light\u201d (RAC, EW5: 97). Third, and\nrelatedly, the model is too rigid in designating certain events as\nthe stimulus or the response\u2014in a word, it\n\u201creifies\u201d them. Because events studied are enmeshed in a\nwider, ongoing activity matrix, other designations (of\n\u201ccause\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d) could be plausible,\ncontingent on the aims of some other experimental inquiry.\nEffectively, Dewey pointed out how the reflex arc model, intending to\nshed metaphysical assumptions, had inadvertently imported new and\ndifferent ones. We are seeking to discover, Dewey wrote, \u201cwhat\nstimulus or sensation, what movement and response mean\u201d\nand we are finding that \u201cthey mean distinctions of flexible\nfunction only, not of fixed existence\u201d\n(RAC, EW5: 102; emphasis mine). This suggestion is pragmatic;\nit says, rather than seeking an underlying reality\n(pure stimulus, pure response), look to meanings. In\ndoing so, it is evident that terms such as stimulus, response,\nsensation, and movement \u201cmean distinctions of flexible function\nonly, not of fixed existence\u201d (RAC, EW5: 102). The\nmeaning of terms is grasped by recognizing their functions as acts in\na wider, dynamic context which includes aims and\n interests.[4]\n\n\nDewey\u2019s critique and reconstruction of the reflex arc presaged\nother important developments in his pragmatism. His argument that\npsychology needed to pay greater attention to context and function was\napplied, in time, to all the sciences, as well as to logic and\nmathematics. The methodological lesson was, in effect, a warning not\nto mistake eventual outcomes of analysis for existents already\n there.[5]\n Theoretical distinctions which are meaningful in specific situations\ndepend upon a wider context that is both retrospective and\nprospective.\n\nWhile there is not space to present Dewey\u2019s extensive\nreconstruction of the phenomena psychology considered permanent parts\nof human beings, a cursory review can show his philosophical method at\nwork. Let us consider instincts/impulses, perceptions, sensations,\nhabits, emotions, sentiency, consciousness, and mind.\n",
