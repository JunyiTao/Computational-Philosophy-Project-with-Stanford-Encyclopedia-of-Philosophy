    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || Liberation Pedagogy\n4.5 Liberation Pedagogy\n\nIn his critique of traditional pedagogy, Paulo Freire refers to\nteacher-centered education as the \u201cbanking concept of\neducation\u201d (1970, 72). This for Freire is unacceptable as civic\neducation. Too often, observes Freire, students are asked to memorize\nand repeat ideas, stanzas, phrases, and formulas without understanding\nthe meaning of or meaning behind them. This process \u201cturns\n[students] into \u2018containers,\u2019 into\n\u2018receptacles\u2019 to be \u2018filled\u2019 by the\nteacher\u201d (Idem). As a result, students are nothing but objects,\nnothing but receptacles to receive, file, and store\ndeposits\u2014that is, containers for what the teacher has deposited\nin their \u201cbanks.\u201d\n\nLike Dewey, Freire thinks that knowledge comes only from invention and\nreinvention and the perpetual inquiry in the world that is a mark of\nall free human beings. Students thereby educate the teachers as well.\nIn sharp contrast, then, to the banking concept is\n\u201c\u2018problem-posing\u2019 education\u201d (Ibid, 79), which\nis an experiential education that empowers students by educing the\npower that they already possess.\n\nThat power is to be used to liberate themselves from oppression. This\npedagogy to end oppression, as Freire writes, \u201cmust be forged\nwith, not for, the oppressed\u201d (1970, 48;\nemphases in original), irrespective of whether they are children or\nadults. Freire worked primarily with illiterate adult peasants in\nSouth America, but his work has applications as well to schools and\nschool-aged children. It is to be a pedagogy for all, and Freire\nincludes oppressors and the oppressed.\n\nTo overcome oppression people must first critically recognize its\ncauses. One cause is people\u2019s own internalization of the\noppressor consciousness [or \u201cimage,\u201d as Freire says at one\npoint (Ibid, 61)]. Until the oppressed seek to remove this\ninternalized oppressor, they cannot be free. They will continue to\nlive in the duality of both oppressed and oppressor. It is no wonder,\nthen, as Freire tells us, that peasants once promoted to overseers\nbecome more tyrannical toward their former workmates than the owners\nthemselves (Ibid, 46). The banking concept of education precludes the\nperspective that students need to recognize their oppression:\n\u201cThe more students [or adults] work at storing the deposits\nentrusted to them, the less they develop the critical consciousness\nwhich would result from their intervention in the world as\ntransformers of that world\u201d (Ibid, 73).\n\nHaving confronted the reality of the dual nature of her consciousness,\nhaving discovered her own internal oppressor and realized her actual\nsituation, the person now must act on her realization. She must act,\nin other words, in and on the world so as to lessen oppression. Freire\nwanted his students, whether adult peasants or a country\u2019s\nyouth, to value their cultures as they simultaneously questioned some\nof those cultures\u2019 practices and ethos. This Freire referred to\nas \u201creading the word\u201d\u2014as in ending\nilliteracy\u2014and \u201creading the world\u201d\u2014the ability\nto analyze social and political situations that influenced and\nespecially limited people\u2019s life chances. For Freire, to\nquestion was not enough; people must act as well.\n\nLiberation, therefore, is a \u201cpraxis,\u201d but it cannot\nconsist of action alone, which Freire calls \u201cactivism.\u201d It\nmust be, instead, action combined with \u201cserious\nreflection\u201d (Ibid, 79, 65). This reflection or \u201creflective\nparticipation\u201d takes place in dialogue with others who are in\nthe same position of realization and action.\n\nThis \u201ccritical and liberating dialogue,\u201d also known as\n\u201cculture circles,\u201d is the heart of Freire\u2019s\npedagogy. The circles consist of somewhere between 12 and 25 students\nand some teachers, all involved in dialogic exchange. The role of the\n\u201cteachers\u201d in this civic education is to participate with\nthe people/students in these dialogues. \u201cThe correct method for\na revolutionary leadership\u2026is, therefore, not\n\u2018libertarian propaganda.\u2019 Nor can the leadership merely\n\u2018implant\u2019 in the oppressed a belief in freedom\u2026The\ncorrect method lies in dialogue\u201d (Ibid, 67).\n\nThe oppressed thereby use their own experiences and language to\nexplain and surmount their oppression. They do not rely upon others,\neven teachers, to explain their oppressed circumstances.\n\u201cThrough dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the\nstudents-of the-teacher cease to exist and a new term emerges:\nteacher-student with students-teachers\u201d (Ibid, 80). The\nreciprocity of roles means that students teach teachers as teachers\nteach students. Dialogue encourages everyone to teach and everyone to\ncreate together.\n\nBecause Freire worked with illiterate adult peasants, he insisted that\nthe circles use the ways of speaking and the shared understandings of\nthe peasants themselves. In the circles the learners identify their\nown problems and concerns and seek answers to them in the group\ndialogue. Dialogue focuses on what Freire called\n\u201ccodifications,\u201d which are representations of the\nlearner\u2019s day-to-day circumstances (Ibid, 114 and passim).\nCodifications may be photographs, drawings, poems, even a single word.\nAs representations, codifications abstract the daily circumstances.\nFor example, a photograph of workers in a sugar cane field permits\nworkers to talk about the realities of their work and working\nconditions without identifying them as the actual workers in the\nphotograph. This permits the dialogue to steer toward understanding\nthe nature of the participants\u2019 specific circumstances but from\na more abstract position. Teachers and learners worked together to\nunderstand the problems identified by the peasants, a process that\nFreire calls \u201cdecoding,\u201d and to propose actions to be\ntaken to rectify or overturn those problems.\n\nThe circles therefore have four basic elements: 1) problem posing, 2)\ncritical dialogue, 3) solution posing, and 4) plan of action. The\ngoal, of course, is to overcome the problems, but it is also to raise\nthe awareness, the critical consciousness (conscientization), of the\nlearners so as to end oppression in their individual and collective\nlives. The increased critical awareness enables learners to\nappropriate language without being colonized by\n it.[15]\n Decoding allows participants \u201cto perceive reality\ndifferently\u2026by broadening the horizon of perception\u2026[It]\nstimulates the appearance of a new perception\u201d that allows for\nthe transformation of the participants\u2019 concrete reality (Ibid\n115).\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d comments Freire, \u201ctrue dialogue cannot\nexist unless the dialoguers engage in critical\nthinking\u2026thinking which perceives reality as process, as\ntransformation, rather than as a static activity\u201d (Ibid,\n92).\n\nTrue dialogue is for Freire what civic education must be about. If\ncivic education does not include it, then there is little hope that\nthe future will be anything for the oppressed but a continuation of\nthe present. \u201cAuthentic education is not carried on by\n\u2018A\u2019 for \u2018B\u2019 or by \u2018A\u2019\nabout \u2018B,\u2019 but by \u2018A\u2019 with\n\u2018B\u2019\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 93; emphases in original).\nEssential to such education are the experiences of the students,\nwhatever their ages or situations. Naively conceived humanism, part\nand parcel of so much traditional education, tries \u201cto create an\nideal model of the \u2018good man,\u2019\u201d but does so by\nleaving out \u201cthe concrete, existential, present situation of\nreal people\u201d (Idem). Therefore, traditional civic education,\nnon-experiential civic education that overlooks the importance of\nFreire\u2019s praxis, fails for Freire to raise either good persons\nor good citizens.\n\nThe Brazilian government has recognized Freire\u2019s culture circles\nas a form of civic education and has underwritten their use for\ncombating illiteracy among youth and adults (Souto-Manning, 2007).\n",
