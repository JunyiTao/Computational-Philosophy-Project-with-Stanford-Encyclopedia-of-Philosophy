    "main_text": "Epistemic Injustice\n3. Epistemic Injustice\n\nFeminism has an obvious relation to epistemology insofar as it must\njustify the legitimacy of its claims and the credibility of those\nmaking them. Miranda Fricker\u2019s book, Epistemic Injustice:\nPower and Ethics of Knowing (2007) has grounded much of the\ncurrent discussion in the analytic tradition, which has largely\nfocused on cataloging and categorizing instances of epistemic\ninjustice. The Continental tradition traces this issue back to\nconcerns with ideology and power/knowledge regimes that have long been\na part of emancipatory discussions.\n",
