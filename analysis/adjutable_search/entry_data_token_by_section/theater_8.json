    "main_text": "Evaluating a Theatrical Performance || Theoretical or Practical Criticism\n4.1 Theoretical or Practical Criticism\n\nThe first major question concerning artistic evaluations is whether\nthey are to be understood as a process of theoretical or of practical\nreasoning. The majority view among analytic philosophers of art now\nfavors the former, and their view is that the conclusion of any act of\nreason-giving is, perhaps must be, a proposition, something to which\none might give some degree of credence (or assent to believing) if the\nreasoning is good. But recent work has revived an earlier view, due to\nArnold Isenberg (1949), that descriptions plus interpretations\n(\u201ccharacterizations\u201d) guide us to evaluations understood\nas \u201cperceptions\u201d. The objection to this view is that \n\n\nif critics simply guide us in perception, then what they do\nnot do is give us a reason which supports an ascription of\noverall value to an artwork. Instead, they simply tell us something\nabout how they see the work, and try\u2014by whatever means\nnecessary\u2014to get us to see it in the same way. This, many have\nargued, fails to qualify as reasoning. (Cross 2017: 302)\n\n\nRobert Hopkins has responded to this objection by recognizing that\nperception is a more complex affair in the case of\n\u201cperceiving works of art\u201d than are those perceptions we\nordinarily have occasion to experience. The important thing is that\nperceptions of works of art have a kind of conceptual content that\nrequires justification\u2014of the sort that critics can supply by\nappeal to premises about the work (Hopkins 2007). Another attempt to\nrespond to the objection is to argue that criticism provides us with\nreasons\u2014premises\u2014aimed at getting us to act\ntoward works of art in ways that might best be construed\n\u201cparticular acts of looking, contemplating, listening,\nreflecting, or otherwise engaging with the artwork\u201d (Cross 2017:\n304, emphasis added).\n\nBut suppose there is a difference between assessments of the value of\nworks of art and assessments of whatever it is we might do\nwith respect to works of art. Could it not be that either of those, as\naims of reasoning, might be legitimate? Those who reject the\n\u201cpractical vs. theoretical reasoning\u201d distinction on the\ngrounds that all reasoning is means/ends, and who thus hold that\nwhether a bit of reasoning is good or bad cannot be determined without\nfirst determining what the reasoner\u2019s end is, will find\nboth Isenberg\u2019s (or the \u201cIsenbergean\u201d) view\nand the objection to it considerably less interesting. Applied to\nevaluations of theatrical performances, qua performances, we\nalso have no reason to choose between these various forms of\nreasoning.\n",
