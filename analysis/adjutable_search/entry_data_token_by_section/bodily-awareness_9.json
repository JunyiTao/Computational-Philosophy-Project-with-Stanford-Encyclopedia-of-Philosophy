Mental representations and the body\n\nWhen one discusses the relationship between bodily awareness and\naction, one frequently appeals to the notion of body schema.\nIt is used, however, in many different ways. One of the main\ncontroversies is whether it should be conceived as a specific type of\nmental representation of the body. For Merleau-Ponty (1945), and more\nrecently for Gallagher (2008), the body schema should be conceived as\na sensorimotor function, devoid of intentional content. Their\ndefinition is in line with a general trend in the last thirty years\nthat rejects the necessity to posit representations in the\nmind (Gallagher 2008; Thelen & Smith 1994; Turvey & Carello\n1995; van Gelder 1995; Thompson 2005; Zahavi & Parnas 1998). On\nthis view, representations are inadequate because they are too costly\nand they are unnecessary because they can be easily replaced by\nsensorimotor loops. The body ca be conceived as \u201cits own best\nmodel\u201d, to use Brooks\u2019s (1991) expression. If biological\nsystems only know what they need to in order to get their job done\n(Clark 1997), is the body really something that the brain needs to\nrepresent in this sense? All that may be needed is to pay attention to\nit (Kinsbourne 1995; Hochstetter 2016).\n",
