    "main_text": "\n\n\nAntonio Rosmini (1797\u20131855), Italian priest, philosopher, \ntheologian\nand patriot, and founder of a religious congregation, aimed principally\nin his philosophical work at re-addressing the balance between reason\nand religion which had largely been lost as a result of the\nEnlightenment. To this purpose, he absorbed the tradition of\nphilosophia perennis, read extensively the works of\npost-Renaissance philosophers, and developed his own views on\nphilosophical fundamentals and many of their applications. Best known\nin Italy, but a controversial figure there during his life and for a\ncentury or more after his death, his philosophical work, centred upon\nthe notion of being and the dignity of the human person, can be\nsummarised under the headings: aims and method, the objectivity of\nthought and the concept of certainty; the dignity of the human person;\nmorality; human rights; the nature of human society; natural theology;\nand being. The following article will examine Rosmini\u2019s work under\nthese titles, which are of perennial relevance and broad enough to\nembrace more particular themes, such as art, politics, education and\nmarriage, which form a constant preoccupation of many of his lesser\nworks, but can only be mentioned in passing here. His theological\nprinciples, other than those pertaining to natural theology, are\nconsidered only in so far as they throw light on the origin and\ndevelopment of his philosophical tenets.\n",
