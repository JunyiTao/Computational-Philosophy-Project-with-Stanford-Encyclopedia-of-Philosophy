    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018homosexuality\u2019 was coined in the late\n19th century by an Austrian-born Hungarian psychologist,\nKaroly Maria Benkert. Although the term is new, discussions about\nsexuality in general, and same-sex attraction in particular, have\noccasioned philosophical discussion ranging from Plato\u2019s\nSymposium to contemporary queer theory. Since the history of\ncultural understandings of same-sex attraction is relevant to the\nphilosophical issues raised by those understandings, it is necessary\nto review briefly some of the social history of homosexuality. Arising\nout of this history, at least in the West, is the idea of natural law\nand some interpretations of that law as forbidding homosexual sex.\nReferences to natural law still play an important role in contemporary\ndebates about homosexuality in religion, politics, and even\ncourtrooms. Finally, perhaps the most significant recent social change\ninvolving homosexuality is the emergence of the gay liberation\nmovement in the West. In philosophical circles this movement is, in\npart, represented through a rather diverse group of thinkers who are\ngrouped under the label of queer theory. A central issue raised by\nqueer theory, which will be discussed below, is whether homosexuality,\nand hence also heterosexuality and bisexuality, is socially\nconstructed or purely driven by biological forces.\n",
