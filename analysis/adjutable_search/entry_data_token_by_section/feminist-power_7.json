    "main_text": "Power as Domination || Poststructuralist Feminist Approaches\n3.5 Poststructuralist Feminist Approaches\n\nMost of the work on power done by post-structuralist feminists has\nbeen inspired by Foucault. In his middle period works (Foucault 1977,\n1978, and 1980), Foucault analyzes modern power as a mobile and\nconstantly shifting set of force relations that emerge from every\nsocial interaction and thus pervade the social body. As he puts it,\n\u201cpower is everywhere, not because it embraces everything, but\nbecause it comes from everywhere\u201d (1978, 93). Foucault endeavors\nto offer a \u201cmicro-physics\u201d of modern power (1977, 26), an\nanalysis that focuses not on the concentration of power in the hands\nof the sovereign or the state, but instead on how power flows through\nthe capillaries of the social body. Foucault criticizes previous\nanalyses of power (primarily Marxist and Freudian) for assuming that\npower is fundamentally repressive, a belief that he terms the\n\u201crepressive hypothesis\u201d (1978, 17\u201349). Although\nFoucault does not deny that power sometimes functions repressively\n(see 1978, 12), he maintains that it is primarily productive; as he\nputs it, \u201cpower produces; it produces reality; it produces\ndomains of objects and rituals of truth\u201d (1977, 194). It also,\naccording to Foucault, produces subjects. As he puts it, \u201cthe\nindividual is not the vis-\u00e0-vis of power; it is, I believe, one\nof its prime effects\u201d (1980, 98). According to Foucault, modern\npower subjects individuals, in both senses of the term; it\nsimultaneously creates them as subjects by subjecting them to power.\nAs we will see in a moment, Foucault\u2019s account of subjection and\nhis account of power more generally have been extremely fruitful, but\nalso quite controversial, for feminists interested in analyzing\ndomination.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that so many feminists have drawn on\nFoucault\u2019s analysis of power. Foucault\u2019s analysis of power\nhas arguably been the most influential discussion of the topic over\nthe last forty years; even those theorists of power who are highly\ncritical of Foucault\u2019s work acknowledge this influence (Lukes\n2005 and, in a somewhat backhanded way, Morriss 2002). Moreover,\nFoucault\u2019s focus on the local and capillary nature of modern\npower clearly resonates with feminist efforts to redefine the scope\nand bounds of the political, efforts that are summed up by the slogan\n\u201cthe personal is political.\u201d At this point, the feminist\nwork that has been inspired by Foucault\u2019s analysis of power is\nso extensive and varied that it defies summarization (see, for\nexample, Allen 1999 and 2008a, Bartky 1990, Bordo 2003, Butler 1990,\n1993, 1997, Diamond and Quinby (eds) 1988, Fraser 1989, Hekman (ed)\n1996, Heyes 2007, McLaren 2002, McNay 1992, McWhorter 1999, Sawicki\n1990, and Young 1990). I will concentrate on highlighting a few\ncentral issues from this rich and diverse body of scholarship.\n\nSeveral of the most prominent Foucaultian-feminist analyses of power\ndraw on his account of disciplinary power in order to critically\nanalyze normative femininity. In Discipline and Punish,\nFoucault analyzes the disciplinary practices that were developed in\nprisons, schools, and factories in the 18th century \u2013 including\nminute regulations of bodily movements, obsessively detailed time\nschedules, and surveillance techniques \u2013 and how these practices\nshape the bodies of prisoners, students and workers into docile bodies\n(1977, 135\u2013169). In a highly influential essay, Sandra Bartky\ncriticizes Foucault for failing to notice that disciplinary practices\nare gendered and that, through such gendered discipline, women\u2019s\nbodies are rendered more docile than the bodies of men (1990, 65).\nDrawing on and extending Foucault\u2019s account of disciplinary\npower, Bartky analyzes the disciplinary practices that engender\nspecifically feminine docile bodies \u2013 including dieting\npractices, limitations on gestures and mobility, and bodily\nornamentation. She also expands Foucault\u2019s analysis of the\nPanopticon, Jeremy Bentham\u2019s design for the ideal prison, a\nbuilding whose spatial arrangement was designed to compel the inmate\nto surveil himself, thus becoming, as Foucault famously put it,\n\u201cthe principle of his own subjection\u201d (1977, 203). With\nrespect to gendered disciplinary practices such as dieting,\nrestricting one\u2019s movement so as to avoid taking up too much\nspace, and keeping one\u2019s body properly hairless, attired,\nornamented and made up, Bartky observes \u201cit is women themselves\nwho practice this discipline on and against their own\nbodies\u2026.The woman who checks her make-up half a dozen times a\nday to see if her foundation has caked or her mascara run, who worries\nthat the wind or rain may spoil her hairdo, who looks frequently to\nsee if her stocking have bagged at the ankle, or who, feeling fat,\nmonitors everything she eats, has become, just as surely as the inmate\nin the Panopticon, a self-policing subject, a self committed to\nrelentless self-surveillance. This self-surveillance is a form of\nobedience to patriarchy\u201d (1990, 80).\n\nAs Susan Bordo points out, this model of self-surveillance does not\nadequately illuminate all forms of female subordination \u2013 all\ntoo often women are actually compelled into submission by means of\nphysical force, economic coercion, or emotional manipulation.\nNevertheless, Bordo agrees with Bartky that \u201cwhen it comes to\nthe politics of appearance, such ideas are apt and illuminating\u201d\n(1993, 27). Bordo explains that, in her own work, Foucault\u2019s\nanalysis of disciplinary power has been \u201cextremely helpful both\nto my analysis of the contemporary disciplines of diet and exercise\nand to my understanding of eating disorders as arising out of and\nreproducing normative feminine practices of our culture, practices\nwhich train the female body in docility and obedience to cultural\ndemands while at the same time being experienced in terms of power and\ncontrol\u201d (ibid). Bordo also highlights and makes use of\nFoucault\u2019s understanding of power relations as inherently\nunstable, as always accompanied by, even generating, resistance (see\nFoucault 1983). \u201cSo, for example, the woman who goes into a\nrigorous weight-training program in order to achieve the currently\nstylish look may discover that her new muscles give her the\nself-confidence that enables her to assert herself more forcefully at\nwork\u201d (1993, 28).\n\nWhereas Bartky and Bordo focus on Foucault\u2019s account of\ndisciplinary power, Judith Butler draws primarily on his analysis of\nsubjection. For example, in her early and massively influential book,\nGender Trouble (1990), Butler notes that \u201cFoucault\npoints out that juridical systems of power produce the subjects they\nsubsequently come to represent. Juridical notions of power appear to\nregulate political life in purely negative terms\u2026..But the\nsubjects regulated by such structures are, by virtue of being\nsubjected to them, formed, defined, and reproduced in accordance with\nthe requirements of those structures\u201d (1990, 2). The implication\nof this for feminists is, according to Butler, that \u201cfeminist\ncritique ought also to understand how the category of\n\u2018women\u2019, the subject of feminism, is produced and\nrestrained by the very structures of power through which emancipation\nis sought\u201d (1990, 2). This Foucaultian insight into the nature\nof subjection \u2013 into the ways in which becoming a subject means\nat the same time being subjected to power relations \u2013 thus forms\nthe basis for Butler\u2019s trenchant critique of the category of\nwomen, and for her call for a subversive performance of the gender\nnorms that govern the production of gender identity. In Bodies\nthat Matter (1993), Butler extends this analysis to consider the\nimpact of subjection on the bodily materiality of the subject. As she\nputs is, \u201cpower operates for Foucault in the constitution of the\nvery materiality of the subject, in the principle which simultaneously\nforms and regulates the \u2018subject\u2019 of subjectivation\u201d\n(1993, 34). Thus, for Butler, power understood as subjection is\nimplicated in the process of determining which bodies come to matter,\nwhose lives are livable and whose deaths grievable. In The Psychic\nLife of Power (1997b), Butler expands further on the Foucaultian\nnotion of subjection, bringing it into dialogue with a Freudian\naccount of the psyche. In the introduction to that text, Butler notes\nthat subjection is a paradoxical form of power. It has an element of\ndomination and subordination, to be sure, but, she writes, \u201cif,\nfollowing Foucault, we understand power as forming the subject as\nwell, as providing the very condition of its existence and the\ntrajectory of its desire, then power is not simply what we oppose but\nalso, in a strong sense, what we depend on for our existence and what\nwe harbor and preserve in the beings that we are\u201d (1997b, 2).\nAlthough Butler credits Foucault with recognizing the fundamentally\nambivalent character of subjection, she also argues that he does not\noffer an account of the specific mechanisms by which the subjected\nsubject is formed. For this, Butler maintains, we need an analysis of\nthe psychic form that power takes, for only such an analysis can\nilluminate the passionate attachment to power that is characteristic\nof subjection.\n\nAlthough many feminists have found Foucault\u2019s analysis of power\nextremely fruitful and productive, Foucault has also had his share of\nfeminist critics. In a very influential early assessment, Nancy Fraser\nargues that, although Foucault\u2019s work offers some interesting\nempirical insights into the functioning of modern power, it is\n\u201cnormatively confused\u201d (Fraser 1989, 31). In his writings\non power, Foucault seems to eschew normative categories, preferring\ninstead to describe the way that power functions in local practices\nand to argue for the appropriate methodology for studying power. He\neven seems to suggest that such normative notions as autonomy,\nlegitimacy, sovereignty, and so forth, are themselves effects of\nmodern power (this point has been contested recently in the literature\non Foucault; see Allen 2008a and Oksala 2005). Fraser claims that this\nattempt to remain normatively neutral or even critical of normativity\nis incompatible with the politically engaged character of\nFoucault\u2019s writings. Thus, for example, although Foucault claims\nthat power is always accompanied by resistance, Fraser argues that he\ncannot explain why domination ought to be resisted. As she puts it,\n\u201conly with the introduction of normative notions of some kind\ncould Foucault begin to answer such questions. Only with the\nintroduction of normative notions could he begin to tell us what is\nwrong with the modern power/knowledge regime and why we ought to\noppose it\u201d (1989, 29). Other feminists have criticized the\nFoucaultian claim that the subject is an effect of power. According to\nfeminists such as Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff and Seyla Benhabib, such\na claim implies a denial of agency that is incompatible with the\ndemands of feminism as an emancipatory social movement (Alcoff 1990,\nBenhabib 1992, and Benhabib et al. 1995; for a reply to this line of\ncriticism, see Allen 2008a chs. 2 and 3). Finally, Nancy Hartsock\n(1990 and 1996) calls into question the usefulness of Foucault\u2019s\nwork as an analytical tool. Hartsock makes two related arguments\nagainst Foucault. First, she argues that his analysis of power is not\na theory for women because it does not examine power from the\nepistemological point of view of the subordinated; in her view,\nFoucault analyzes power from the perspective of the colonizer, rather\nthan the colonized (1990). Second, Foucault\u2019s analysis of power\nfails to adequately theorize structural relations of inequality and\ndomination that undergird women\u2019s subordination; this is related\nto the first argument because \u201cdomination, viewed from above, is\nmore likely to look like equality\u201d(1996, 39; for a response to\nthis critique, see Allen 1996 and 1999).\n\nDespite these and other trenchant feminist critiques of Foucault (see,\nfor example, Hekman, ed. 1996 and Ramazanoglu, ed. 1993), his analysis\nof power continues to be an extremely useful resource for feminist\nconceptions of domination. For recent important feminist work that\ndraws on Foucault\u2019s genealogical method to offer an\nintersectional analysis of racism and gender or sexual oppression see\nFeder (2007) and McWhorter (2009).\n",
