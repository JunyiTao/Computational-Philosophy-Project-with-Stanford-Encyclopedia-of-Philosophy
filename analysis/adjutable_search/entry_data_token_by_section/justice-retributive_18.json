Its negative desert element is\ndeontological. It is a conceptual, not a deontological, point that one\ncannot punish another whom one believes to be innocent\n (section 2.1).\n But it is a deontological point that an avenue of justification for\nhard treatment is opened up, making permissible what might otherwise\nhave been impermissible, if that person is guilty and therefore\nforfeits her right not to be so treated.\n\nInsofar as retributivism holds that it is intrinsically good if a\nlegitimate punisher punishes the guilty, it seems to have a\nconsequentialist element as well. This good has to be weighed against\nother possible goods to decide what it would be best to do (Cahill\n2011). Thus, most retributivists would accept that it is justifiable\nto forego punishing one deserving person if doing so would make it\npossible to punish two equally deserving people, or one more deserving\nperson\u2014as happens on a regular basis in plea-bargaining (Moore\n1997: 157\u2013158; Berman 2011: 451\u2013452; see also\n section 4.4).\n\nBerman (2011) has argued that retributivism can appropriately be\nunderstood not just as having a consequentialist element, but as\nhaving an instrumentalist element, namely that punishment is a\nvaluable tool in achieving the suffering that a wrongdoer deserves.\nBut he argues that retributivism can also be understood as\nnon-instrumentalist if the desert object is punishment, not suffering.\nIt would be non-instrumentalist because punishment would not be a\nmeans to achieving the good of suffering; it would be good in itself.\nAs argued in\n section 4.3,\n punishment, not suffering, should be thought of as the proper\nretributive desert object, and thus the instrumentalist conception\nshould be rejected.\n",
