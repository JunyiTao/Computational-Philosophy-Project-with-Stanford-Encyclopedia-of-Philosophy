    "main_text": "Forms of Virtue Ethics || Eudaimonist Virtue Ethics\n2.1 Eudaimonist Virtue Ethics\n\nThe distinctive feature of eudaimonist versions of virtue ethics is\nthat they define virtues in terms of their relationship to\neudaimonia. A virtue is a trait that contributes to or is a\nconstituent of eudaimonia and we ought to develop virtues,\nthe eudaimonist claims, precisely because they contribute to\neudaimonia.\n\nThe concept of eudaimonia, a key term in ancient Greek moral\nphilosophy, is standardly translated as \u201chappiness\u201d or\n\u201cflourishing\u201d and occasionally as\n\u201cwell-being.\u201d Each translation has its disadvantages. The\ntrouble with \u201cflourishing\u201d is that animals and even plants\ncan flourish but eudaimonia is possible only for rational\nbeings. The trouble with \u201chappiness\u201d is that in ordinary\nconversation it connotes something subjectively determined. It is for\nme, not for you, to pronounce on whether I am happy. If I think I am\nhappy then I am\u2014it is not something I can be wrong about\n(barring advanced cases of self-deception). Contrast my being healthy\nor flourishing. Here we have no difficulty in recognizing that I might\nthink I was healthy, either physically or psychologically, or think\nthat I was flourishing but be wrong. In this respect,\n\u201cflourishing\u201d is a better translation than\n\u201chappiness\u201d. It is all too easy to be mistaken about\nwhether one\u2019s life is eudaimon (the adjective from\neudaimonia) not simply because it is easy to deceive oneself,\nbut because it is easy to have a mistaken conception of\neudaimonia, or of what it is to live well as a human being,\nbelieving it to consist largely in physical pleasure or luxury for\nexample.\n\nEudaimonia is, avowedly, a moralized or value-laden concept\nof happiness, something like \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201creal\u201d\nhappiness or \u201cthe sort of happiness worth seeking or\nhaving.\u201d It is thereby the sort of concept about which there can\nbe substantial disagreement between people with different views about\nhuman life that cannot be resolved by appeal to some external standard\non which, despite their different views, the parties to the\ndisagreement concur (Hursthouse 1999: 188\u2013189).\n\nMost versions of virtue ethics agree that living a life in accordance\nwith virtue is necessary for eudaimonia. This supreme good is\nnot conceived of as an independently defined state (made up of, say, a\nlist of non-moral goods that does not include virtuous activity) which\nexercise of the virtues might be thought to promote. It is, within\nvirtue ethics, already conceived of as something of which virtuous\nactivity is at least partially constitutive (Kraut 1989). Thereby\nvirtue ethicists claim that a human life devoted to physical pleasure\nor the acquisition of wealth is not eudaimon, but a wasted\nlife.\n\nBut although all standard versions of virtue ethics insist on that\nconceptual link between virtue and eudaimonia,\nfurther links are matters of dispute and generate different versions.\nFor Aristotle, virtue is necessary but not sufficient\u2014what is\nalso needed are external goods which are a matter of luck. For Plato\nand the Stoics, virtue is both necessary and sufficient for\neudaimonia (Annas 1993).\n\nAccording to eudaimonist virtue ethics, the good life is the\neudaimon life, and the virtues are what enable a human being\nto be eudaimon because the virtues just are those character\ntraits that benefit their possessor in that way, barring bad luck. So\nthere is a link between eudaimonia and what confers virtue\nstatus on a character trait. (For a discussion of the differences\nbetween eudaimonists see Baril 2014. For recent defenses of\neudaimonism see Annas 2011; LeBar 2013b; Badhwar 2014; and Bloomfield\n2014.)\n",
