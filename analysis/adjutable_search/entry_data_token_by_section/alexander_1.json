    "main_text": "Early Writings || History of Philosophy: Hegel and Locke\n2.1 History of Philosophy: Hegel and Locke\n\nAlexander\u2019s first publication, \u201cHegel\u2019s Conception\nof Nature\u201d (1886), reveals Alexander\u2019s philosophic\nupbringing in Oxford\u2019s British Hegelian enclave. Alexander aims to set\nout Hegel\u2019s conception of nature, \u201cso fantastic and\nso poetical that it may often be thought not to be\nserious\u201d, as clearly as possible. He also aims to show\nwhere it agrees with, and diverges from, contemporary science. The\narticle explains that science leads to a philosophy of nature\nthrough observation\u2014for example, transforming seemingly isolated\nindividuals into universals by discovering their general\ncharacter\u2014and the discovery of laws. Alexander also compares\nHegel\u2019s account to contemporary theories of evolution, and\nargues there is a \u201cgreat likeness\u201d (Alexander 1886: 518).\nArguably, some of the positions that Alexander attributes to Hegel are\nsimilar to his own mature views; for example, Alexander reads Hegel as\nholding that space and time are \u201cin the world\u201d as much as\nmatter (Alexander 1886: 506).\n\nAlexander\u2019s early monograph Locke (1908) discusses\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay on ethics, politics, and\nreligion. This short book reveals Alexander\u2019s admiration\nfor Locke, and Lockean empiricism. Whilst this work is mainly of\nscholarly interest, Alexander spends one chapter \u201cObservations\non the Essay\u201d critiquing Locke, and here Alexander\nreveals the bent of his own early views. For example, Alexander\ncomplains that Locke might have gone further had he applied his\nobservations regarding the continuity of mental experience to\nsubstance (Alexander 1908: 52). This is suggestive, given that one of\nAlexander\u2019s later key claims concerning spacetime\u2014the\nstuff of substances\u2014is that it is continuous.\n",
