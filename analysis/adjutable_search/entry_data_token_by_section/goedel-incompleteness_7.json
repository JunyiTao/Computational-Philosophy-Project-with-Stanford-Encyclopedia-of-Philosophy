Then a sentence \\(D\\) can be\nmechanically constructed such that\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash D \\leftrightarrow A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner).\n\\]\n\n(For a sketch of the proof; see Supplement: The\nDiagonalization Lemma)\n\n\nIn the literature, this lemma is sometimes also called \u201cthe\nself-referential lemma\u201d or \u201cthe fixed point lemma\u201d.\nIt has many important applications beyond the incompleteness\ntheorems.\n\nIt is often said that given a property denoted by \\(A(x)\\),\nthe sentence \\(D\\) is a self-referential sentence which \u201csays\nof itself\u201d that it has the property \\(A\\). Such figures of\nspeech may be heuristically useful, but they are also easily\nmisleading and suggest too much. For example, note that the lemma only\nprovides a (provable) material equivalence between \\(D\\) and\n\\(A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\) (which states\nthat both sides must have the same truth-value) and does not claim any\nsort of sameness of meaning. In particular, \\(D\\) and\n\\(A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\) are by no means\nidentical\u2014and neither are\n\\(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner\\) and\n\\(\\ulcorner A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\urcorner\\).\n\n",
