    "main_text": "\n\nConcepts are the building blocks of thoughts. Consequently, they are\ncrucial to such psychological processes as categorization, inference,\nmemory, learning, and decision-making. This much is relatively\nuncontroversial. But the nature of concepts\u2014the kind of things\nconcepts are\u2014and the constraints that govern a theory of\nconcepts have been the subject of much debate (Margolis & Laurence\n1999, Margolis & Laurence 2015). This is due, at least in part, to\nthe fact that disputes about concepts often reflect deeply opposing\napproaches to the study of the mind, to language, and even to\nphilosophy itself. In this entry, we provide an overview of theories\nof concepts, and outline some of the disputes that have shaped debates\nsurrounding the nature of concepts. The entry is organized around five\nsignificant issues that are focal points for many theories of\nconcepts. Not every theory of concepts takes a stand on each of the\nfive, but viewed collectively these issues show why the theory of\nconcepts has been such a rich and lively topic in recent years. The\nfive issues are: (1) the ontology of concepts, (2) the structure of\nconcepts, (3) empiricism and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and\nnatural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.\n",
