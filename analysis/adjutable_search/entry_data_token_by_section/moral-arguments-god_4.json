Practical Moral Arguments for Belief in God\n\nAs already noted, the most famous and perhaps most influential version\nof a moral argument for belief in God is found in Immanuel Kant\n(1788). Kant himself insisted that his argument was not a theoretical\nargument, but an argument grounded in practical reason. The conclusion\nof the argument is not \u201cGod exists\u201d or \u201cGod probably\nexists\u201d but \u201cI (as a rational, moral agent) ought to\nbelieve that God exists.\u201d We shall, however, see that there are\nsome reasons to doubt that practical arguments can be neatly separated\nfrom theoretical arguments.\n\nKant\u2019s version of the argument can be stated in different ways,\nbut perhaps the following captures one plausible interpretation of the\nargument. Morality is grounded in pure practical reason, and the moral\nagent must act on the basis of maxims that can be rationally endorsed\nas universal principles. Moral actions are thus not determined by\nresults or consequences but by the maxims on which they are based.\nHowever, all actions, including moral actions, necessarily aim at\nends. Kant argues that the end that moral actions aim at is the\n\u201chighest good,\u201d which is a world in which both moral\nvirtue and happiness are maximized, with happiness contingent on\nvirtue. For Kant \u201cought implies can,\u201d and so if I have an\nobligation to seek the highest good, then I must believe that it is\npossible to achieve such an end. However, I must seek the highest good\nonly by acting in accordance with morality; no shortcuts to happiness\nare permissible. This seems to require that I believe that acting in\naccordance with morality will be causally efficacious in achieving the\nhighest good. However, it is reasonable to believe that moral actions\nwill be causally efficacious in this way only if the laws of causality\nare set up in such a way that these laws are conducive to the efficacy\nof moral action. Certainly both parts of the highest good seem\ndifficult to achieve. We humans have weaknesses in our character that\nappear difficult if not impossible to overcome by our own efforts.\nFurthermore, as creatures we have subjective needs that must be\nsatisfied if we are happy, but we have little empirical reason to\nthink that these needs will be satisfied by moral actions even if we\nsucceeded in becoming virtuous. If a person believes that the natural\nworld is simply a non-moral machine with no moral purposiveness then\nthat person would have no reason to believe that moral action could\nsucceed because there is no a priori reason to\nthink moral action will achieve the highest good and little empirical\nreason to believe this either. Kant thus concludes that a moral agent\nmust \u201cpostulate\u201d the existence of God as a rational\npresupposition of the moral life.\n\nOne problem with this argument is that many will deny that morality\nrequires us to seek the highest good in Kant\u2019s sense. Even if\nthe Kantian highest good seems reasonable as an ideal, some will\nobject that we have no obligation to achieve such a state, but merely\nto work towards realizing the closest approximation to such a state\nthat is possible (See Adams 1987, 152). Without divine assistance,\nperhaps perfect virtue is unachievable, but in that case we cannot be\nobliged to realize such a state if there is no God. Perhaps we cannot\nhope that happiness will be properly proportioned to virtue in the\nactual world if God does not exist, but then our obligation can only\nbe to realize as much happiness as can be attained through moral\nmeans. Kant would doubtless reject this criticism, since on his view\nthe ends of morality are given directly to pure practical\nreason a priori, and we are not at liberty to\nadjust those ends on the basis of empirical beliefs. However, few\ncontemporary philosophers would share Kant\u2019s confident view of\nreason here, and thus to many the criticism has force. Even Kant\nadmits at one point that full-fledged belief in God is not rationally\nnecessary, since one could conceivably seek the highest good if one\nmerely believes that God\u2019s existence is possible (Kant,\n1781\u20131787, 651).\n\nAnother way of interpreting Kant\u2019s argument puts more stress on\nthe connection between an individual\u2019s desire for happiness and\nthe obligation to do what is morally right. Morality requires me to\nsacrifice my personal happiness if that is necessary to do what is\nright. Yet it is a psychological fact that humans necessarily desire\ntheir own happiness. In such a state it looks as if human moral agents\nwill be torn by what Henry Sidgwick called the \u201cdualism of the\npractical reason\u201d (1884, 401). Reason both requires humans to\nseek their own happiness and to sacrifice it. Sidgwick himself noted\nthat only if there is a God can we hope that this dualism will be\nresolved, so that those who seek to act morally will in the long run\nalso be acting so as to advance their own happiness and well-being.\n(Interestingly, Sidgwick himself does not endorse this argument, but\nhe clearly sees this problem as part of the appeal of theism.) A\ncontemporary argument similar to this one has been developed by C.\nStephen Layman (2002).\n\nThe critic of this form of the Kantian argument may reply that Kantian\nmorality sees duty as something that must be done regardless of the\nconsequences, and thus a truly moral person cannot make his or her\ncommitment to morality contingent on the achievement of happiness.\nFrom a Kantian point of view, this reply seems right; Kant\nunequivocally affirms that moral actions must be done for the sake of\nduty and not from any desire for personal reward. Nevertheless,\nespecially for any philosopher willing to endorse any form of\neudaimonism, seeing myself as inevitably sacrificing what I cannot\nhelp but desire for the sake of duty does seem problematic. As John\nHare affirms, \u201cIf we are to endorse wholeheartedly the long-term\nshape of our lives, we have to see this shape as consistent with our\nhappiness\u201d (1996, 88).\n\nThe critic may reply to this by simply accepting the lamentable fact\nthat there is something tragic or even absurd about the human\ncondition. The world may not be the world we wish it was, but that\ndoes not give us any reason to believe it is different from what it\nis. If there is a tension between the demands of morality and\nself-interest, then this may simply be a brute fact that must be\nfaced.\n\nThis reply raises an issue for all forms of practical or pragmatic\narguments for belief. Many philosophers insist that rational belief\nmust be grounded solely in theoretical evidence. The fact that it\nwould be better for me to believe p does not in itself give me any\nreason to believe p. This criticism is aimed not merely at Kant, but\nat other practical moral arguments. For example, Robert Adams argues\nthat if humans believe there is no moral order to the universe, then\nthey will become demoralized in their pursuit of morality, which is\nmorally undesirable (1987, 151). The atheist might concede that\natheism is (somewhat) demoralizing, but deny that this provides any\nreason to believe there is a moral order to the universe. Similarly,\nLinda Zagzebski (1987) argues that morality will not be a rational\nenterprise unless good actions increase the amount of good in the\nworld. However, given that moral actions often involve the sacrifice\nof happiness, there is no reason to believe moral action will increase\nthe good unless there is a power transcendent of human activity\nworking on the side of the good. Here the atheist may claim that moral\naction does increase the good because such actions always increase\ngood character. However, even if that reply fails the atheist may\nagain simply admit that there may be something tragic or absurd about\nthe human condition, and the fact that we may wish things were\ndifferent is not a reason to believe that they are. So the problem\nmust be faced: Are practical arguments merely rationalized\nwish-fulfillment?\n\nThe theist might respond to this kind of worry in several ways. The\nfirst thing to be said is that the fact that a naturalistic view of\nthe universe implies that the universe must be tragic or absurd, if\ncorrect, would itself be an important and interesting conclusion.\nHowever, apart from this, it makes a great deal of difference how one\nconstrues what we might call the background epistemic situation. If\none believes that our theoretical evidence favors atheism, then it\nseems plausible to hold that one ought to maintain a naturalistic\nview, even if it is practically undesirable that the world have such a\ncharacter. In that case a practical argument for religious belief\ncould be judged a form of wish-fulfillment. However, this does not\nseem to be the way those who support such a practical argument see the\nsituation. Kant affirms that the limits of reason established\nin The Critique of Pure Reason would silence all\nobjections to morality and religion \u201cin Socratic fashion,\nnamely, by the clearest proof of the ignorance of the\nobjectors.\u201d (1781, 1787, 30. See also 530\u2013531) In fact,\nthe situation actually favors theism, since Kant holds that\ntheoretical reason sees value in the concept of God as a regulative\nideal, even though God\u2019s existence cannot be theoretically\naffirmed as knowledge. If we appeal to God\u2019s will to explain\nwhat happens in the natural order, we undermine both science and\nreligion, since in that case we would no longer seek empirical\nevidence for causality and we would make God into a finite object in\nthe natural world (1781, 1787, 562\u2013563). However, as a\nregulative ideal, the concept of God is one that theoretical reason\nfinds useful: \u201cThe assumption of a supreme intelligence, as the\none and only cause of the universe, though in the idea alone, can\ntherefore always benefit reason and can never injure it\u201d (1781,\n1787, 560). There is a sense in which theoretical reason itself\ninclines towards affirmation of God, because it must assume that\nreality is rationally knowable: \u201cIf one wishes to achieve\nsystematic knowledge of the world, he ought to regard it as if it were\ncreated by a supreme reason.\u201d (Kant 1786, 298) Although\ntheoretical reason cannot affirm the existence of God, it finds it\nuseful to think of the natural world as having the kinds of\ncharacteristics it would have if God did exist. Thus, if rational\ngrounds for belief in God come from practical reason, theoretical\nreason will raise no objections.\n\nFor Kant the argument from practical reason for belief in God is not a\nform of wish-fulfillment because its ground is not an arbitrary desire\nor wish but \u201ca real need associated with reason\u201d (Kant,\n1786, 296). Human beings are not purely theoretical spectators of the\nuniverse, but agents. It is not always rational or even possible to\nrefrain from action, and yet action presupposes beliefs about the way\nthings are (For a good interpretation and defense of this view of Kant\non the relation between action and belief, see Wood 1970,\n17\u201325). Thus, in some cases suspension of judgment is not\npossible. The critic may object that a person may act as if p were\ntrue without believing p. However, it is not clear that this advice to\ndistinguish action on the basis of p and belief that p can always be\nfollowed. For one thing, it seems empirically the case that one way of\nacquiring belief that p is simply to begin to act as if p were true.\nHence, to begin to act as if p were true is at least to embark upon a\ncourse of action that makes belief in p more likely. Second, there may\nwell be a sense of \u201cbelief\u201d in which \u201cacting as if p\nwere true\u201d is sufficient to constitute belief. This is obviously\nthe case on pragmatist accounts of belief. But even those who reject a\ngeneral pragmatic account of belief may well find something like this\nappealing with respect to religious belief. Many religious believers\nhold that the best way to measure a person\u2019s religious faith is\nin terms of the person\u2019s actions. Thus, a person who is willing\nto act on the basis of a religious conception, especially if those\nactions are risky or costly, is truly a religious believer, even if\nthat person is filled with doubt and anxiety. Such a person might well\nbe construed as more truly a believer than a person who smugly\n\u201cassents\u201d to religious doctrines but is unwilling to act\non them.\n\nPerhaps the right way to think of practical moral arguments is not to\nsee them as justifying belief without evidence, but as shifting the\namount of evidence seen as necessary. This is the lesson some would\ndraw from the phenomenon of \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d that\nhas been much discussed in recent epistemology. Here is an example of\npragmatic encroachment:\n\nYou: I am about to replace the ceiling fan in the kitchen.\n\nSpouse: Did you turn off the main electrical power to the house?\n\nYou: Yes.\n\nSpouse: If you forgot you could electrocute yourself.\n\nYou: I better go back and check.\n\n(See McBrayer 2014, Rizzieri 2013).\n\n\nA plausible interpretation of this scenario is that ordinarily claims\nsuch as the one I made, based on memory, are justified, and count as\nknowledge. However, in this situation, the stakes are raised because\nmy life is at risk, and my knowledge is lost because the pragmatic\nsituation has \u201cencroached\u201d on the normal truth-oriented\nconditions for knowledge. Pragmatic encroachment is controversial and\nthe idea of such encroachment is rejected by some epistemologists.\nHowever, defenders hold that it is reasonable to consider the\npragmatic stakes in considering evidence for a belief that underlies\nsignificant action (see Fantl and McGrath 2007). If this is correct,\nthen it seems reasonable to consider the pragmatic situation in\ndetermining how much evidence is sufficient to justify religious\nbeliefs. In theory the adjustment could go in either direction,\ndepending on what costs are associated with a mistake and on which\nside those costs lie.\n\nIn any case it is not clear that practical moral arguments can always\nbe clearly distinguished from theoretical moral arguments. The reason\nthis is so is that in many cases the practical situation described\nseems itself to be or involve a kind of evidence for the truth of the\nbelief being justified. Take, for example, Kant\u2019s classic\nargument. One thing Kant\u2019s argument does is call to our\nattention that it would be enormously odd to believe that human beings\nare moral creatures subject to an objective moral law, but also to\nbelieve that the universe that humans inhabit is indifferent to\nmorality. In other words, the existence of human persons understood as\nmoral beings can itself be understood as a piece of evidence about the\ncharacter of the universe humans find themselves in. Peter Byrne\n(2013, 1998) has criticized practical arguments on the grounds that\nthey presuppose something like the following proposition: \u201cThe\nworld is likely to be organized so as to meet our deepest human\nneeds.\u201d Byrne objects that this premise is likely to be false if\nthere is no God and thus arguments that assume it appear circular.\nHowever, it is not clear that only those who already believe in God\nwill find this premise attractive. The reason for this is that humans\nare themselves part of the natural universe, and it seems a desirable\nfeature of a metaphysical view that it explain (rather than explain\naway) features of human existence that seem real and important.\n\nIt seems likely therefore that any appeal to a practical argument will\ninclude some theoretical component as well, even if that component is\nnot always made explicit. Nevertheless, this does not mean that\npractical arguments do not have some important and distinctive\nfeatures. For Kant it was important that religious beliefs stem from\npractical reason. For if religious belief were grounded solely in\ntheoretical reason, then such belief would have to conform to\n\u201cextrinsic and arbitrary legislation.\u201d (Kant 1790, 131)\nKant thinks such a religion would be one grounded in \u201cfear and\nsubmission,\u201d and thus it is good that religious belief is\nmotivated mainly by a free moral act by which the \u201cfinal end of\nour being\u201d is presented to us. (1790, 159) For any practical\nargument makes religious belief existential; the issue is not merely\nwhat I believe to be true about the universe but how I shall live my\nlife in that universe.\n",
