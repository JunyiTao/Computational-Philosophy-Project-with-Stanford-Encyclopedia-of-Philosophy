    "main_text": "The Epistemological Status of Computer Science || Computer Science as a Mathematical Discipline\n8.1 Computer Science as a Mathematical Discipline\n\nAny epistemological characterization of computer science is based on\nontological, methodological, and epistemological commitments, namely\non assumptions about the nature of computational systems, the methods\nguiding the software development process, and the kind of reasoning\nthereby involved, whether deductive, inductive, or a combination of\nboth (Eden 2007).\n\nThe origin of the analysis of computation as a mathematical notion\ncame notoriously from logic, with Hilbert's question concerning\nthe decidability of predicate calculus, known as the\nEntschiedungsproblem (Hilbert and Ackermann 1950): could\nthere be a mechanical procedure for deciding of an arbitrary sentence\nof logic whether it is provable? To address this question, a rigorous\nmodel of the informal concept of an effective or mechanical method in\nlogic and mathematics was required. This is first and foremost a\nmathematical endeavor: one has to develop a mathematical analogue of\nthe informal notion. Supporters of the view that computer science is\nmathematical in nature assume that a computer program can be seen as a\nphysical realization of such a mathematical entity and that one can\nreason about programs deductively through the formal methods of\ntheoretical computer science.\u00a0Dijkstra (1974) and Hoare (1986)\nwere very explicit in considering programs\u2019 instructions as\nmathematical sentences, and considering a formal semantics for\nprogramming languages in terms of an axiomatic system (Hoare 1969).\nProvided that program specifications and instructions are advanced in\nthe same formal language, formal semantics provide the means to prove\ncorrectness. Accordingly, knowledge about the behaviors of\ncomputational systems is acquired by the deductive reasoning involved\nin mathematical proofs of correctness. The reason at the basis of such\na rationalist optimism (Eden 2007) about what can be known about\ncomputational systems is that they are artifacts, that is,\nhuman-made systems and, as such, one can predict their\nbehaviors with certainty (Knuth 1974).\n\nAlthough a central concern of theoretical computer science, the topics\nof computability and complexity are covered in existing entries on the\n Church-Turing thesis,\n computational complexity theory, and\n recursive functions.\n",
