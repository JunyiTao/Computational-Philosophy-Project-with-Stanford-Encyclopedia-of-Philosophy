    "main_text": "Some general considerations || Computer scientists\n1.3 Computer scientists\n\nIn the computer sciences the theories and proposals that have been put\nforward are of a quite different nature than the logical and\nmathematical ones, although they do inspire one another. The problem\none faces here is precisely to set up a translation from a classical\ngeometrical, analogous model to a model whereof the domain (usually)\nconsists of the finite set of pixels or cells that make up the\n(computer) screen. The obvious drawback (from the perspective of this\nentry) is that nearly all these models assume the classical (infinite)\nmodel in the background and, hence, do not have a proper foundation of\ntheir own\u2014a situation quite analogous to numerical analysis that\nrelies on classical analysis for proving the correctness of the\nprocedures. Most attention is paid to the problem of proving\ncorrespondences between the original and the discrete model to make\nsure that the image obtained is, in certain respects, faithful to the\noriginal. A simple mathematical example concerns the number of holes\nin a 3-dimensional Euclidean surface. One wants to be sure that every\nhole that shows up in the digital picture does indeed correspond to a\nhole in the original mathematical object. See Borwein & Devlin\n(2009) for more examples. However, that being said, there is some work\nbeing done that does not want to rely on the classical continuous\nbackground but instead looks for \u201cproper\u201d axiomatisations\nand/or formalisations of a pixel geometry. See Kulpa (1979) and, more\nrecently, Danielsson (2002) for some nice examples.\n\nA different line of investigation concerns the use of mereology (see\nthe entry\n mereology\n in this encyclopedia for an overview) as an alternative approach to\nclassical geometry, often referred to as mereogeometry or\nmereotopology. The main feature is not to take a point as a primitive\nnotion but a region, usually with a finite extension (or unspecified).\nThe main motivation is to be found in the interaction between\ncognitive psychology and the computer sciences. The modelling of\nvisual perception and cognition is a prime example. Although there is\nan obvious connection with finite geometry, it is not really\ninvestigated at present. Rare examples are Galton (1999) and Schmidtke\n(2016). There are also parallels and connections to be found and to be\nexplored between mereogeometry and topology and \u2018natural\ngeometry\u2019, mentioned in\n section 2.2.\n\nNote also that these theories should not be confused with computer\nprograms that have the ability to reason about geometrical\nobjects. This is part of the research area of automated\nreasoning\u2014see Chou et al. (1994) for a nice introduction, and\nthe entry\n automated reasoning\n in this encyclopedia\u2014 and its basic objects are proofs, not\nnecessarily the mathematical objects the proofs are about.\n",
