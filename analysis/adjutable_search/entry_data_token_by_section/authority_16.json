For if consent is a\ngenuinely necessary condition of political authority, then it appears\nthat individuals may have the option of not obeying a perfectly just\nstate that has jurisdiction over the area in which they live. And they\nmay do this on perverse grounds or they may simply wish to free ride on\nthe benefits that the state confers without having to undertake any of\nthe burdens. How can this be legitimate and how can it undermine the\nauthority of a just state? It seems that in the effort to express\nrespect for the reasonable opinions of people, consent theory seems to\nhave gone too far in giving respect to immoral, irrational and\nunprincipled failures of consent (Raz 1986).\n\n\nThe consent theorist could respond to this difficulty with the claim\nthat it is only the state's claim to authority that is being held\nhostage, not the state's just activities. For if it is the case that\nthe person is merely free riding on desirable activities and that this\nis unjust then the person is acting wrongly. Hence, the justice of the\nactions of the state may be sufficient to condemn the actions of the\nfree rider and this can be done without attributing the right to rule\nto the state.\n\n\nBut now the instrumentalist could argue that obedience to the\nauthoritative commands of the state may be necessary to acting justly\nin many instances. The thought is that only if people treat the\ncommands of the state as providing content independent reasons for\nobedience can a reasonably just state actually perform the tasks that\nmake it just. If people are constantly second guessing the state's\ndecisions, the central roles of coordination, collective action and\nassurance in the establishment of justice by the state will be\nundermined. These are collective effects of second guessing. But the\ninstrumentalist will also argue that individuals will often act less in\naccordance with the reasons that apply to them if they fail to take the\ncommands of a reasonably just state as offering content independent\nreasons because only the state's commands can clue them in to what the\nrules that establish justice are in their particular community. The\ninstrumentalist may then argue that it is therefore wrong for the\nperson not to take the commands of the state as authoritative, at least\nin many circumstances.\n",
