    "main_text": "Jevons: An Algebra of Logic Based on Total Operations\n4. Jevons: An Algebra of Logic Based on Total Operations\n\nJevons, who had studied with De Morgan, was the first to offer an\nalternative to Boole\u2019s system. In 1863 he wrote to Boole that surely\nBoole\u2019s operation of addition should be replaced by the more natural\n\u2018inclusive or\u2019 (or \u2018union\u2019), leading to the\nlaw \\(X + X = X\\). Boole completely rejected this suggestion (it would\nhave destroyed his system based on ordinary algebra) and broke off the\ncorrespondence. Jevons published his system in his 1864 book, Pure\nLogic (reprinted in Jevons 1890). By \u2018pure\u2019 he meant\nthat he was casting off any dependence on the algebra of\nnumbers\u2014instead of classes, which are associated with quantity,\nhe would use predicates, which are associated with quality, and his\nlaws would be derived directly from the (total) fundamental operations\nof inclusive disjunction and conjunction. But he kept Boole\u2019s use of\nequations as the fundamental form of statements in his algebra of\nlogic.\n\nBy adopting De Morgan\u2019s convention of using upper-case/lower-case\nletters for complements, Jevons\u2019 system was not suited to provide\nequational axioms for modern Boolean algebra. However, he refined his\nsystem of axioms and rules of inference until the result was\nessentially the modern system of Boolean algebra for ground\nterms, that is, terms where the class symbols are to be thought\nof as constants, not as variables.\n\nIt must be noticed that modern equational logic deals with\nuniversally quantified equations (which would have been\ncalled laws in the 1800s). In the 19th century\nalgebra of logic one could translate \u201cAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\u201d\nas the equation \\(X = XY\\). This is not to be viewed as the\nuniversally quantified expression \\((\\forall X)(\\forall Y)(X = XY)\\).\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are to be treated as constants (or schematic letters).\nTerms that only have constants (no variables) are called\nground terms.\n\nBy carrying out this analysis in the special setting of an algebra of\npredicates (or equivalently, in an algebra of classes) Jevons played\nan important role in the development of modern equational logic. As\nmentioned earlier, Boole gave inadequate sets of equational axioms for\nhis system, originally starting with the two laws due to Gregory plus\nhis idempotent law; these were accompanied by De Morgan\u2019s inference\nrule that one could carry out the same operation (Boole\u2019s fundamental\noperations in his algebra of logic were addition, subtraction and\nmultiplication) on equals and obtain equals. Boole then switched to\nthe simple and powerful (but unexplained) Rule of 0 and 1.\n\nHaving replaced Boole\u2019s fundamental operations with total operations,\nJevons proceeded, over a period of many years, to work on the axioms\nand rules for his system. Some elements of equational logic that we\nnow take for granted required a considerable number of years for\nJevons to resolve:\n\nThe Reflexive Law (\\(A=A\\)). In 1864 Jevons listed this as a\npostulate (1890, p. 11) and then in \u00a724 he referred to \\(A = A\\)\nas a \u201cuseless Identical proposition\u201d. In his 1869 paper on\nsubstitution it became the \u201cLaw of Identity\u201d. In the\nPrinciples of Science (1874) it was one of the three\n\u201cFundamental Laws of Thought\u201d.\n\nThe Symmetric Law (\\(B = A\\) follows from \\(A = B\\)). In 1864\nJevons wrote \u201c\\(A = B\\) and \\(B = A\\) are the same\nstatement\u201d. This is a position he would maintain. In 1874 he\nwrote\n\n\nI shall consider the two forms \\(A = B\\) and \\(B = A\\) to express\nexactly the same identity written differently.\n\n\nFor a final form of his algebra of logic we turn to the laws which he\nhad scattered over 40 pages in Principles of Science (1874),\nhaving replaced his earlier use of + by \\(\\ORjev\\), evidently to move\nfurther away from any appearance of a connection with the algebra of\nnumbers:\n\nLaws of Combination \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} A &= AA = AAA = \\& c & \\mbox{Law of\nSimplicity (p. 33)}\\\\ AB &= BA & \\mbox{A Law of\nCommutativeness (p. 35)}\\\\ A \\ORjev A & = A &\\mbox{Law of\nUnity (p. 72)}\\\\ A \\ORjev B &= B \\ORjev A &\\mbox{A Law of\nCommutativeness (p. 72)}\\\\ A(B \\ORjev C) &= AB \\ORjev AC &\n\\mbox{(no name given) (p. 76)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nLaws of Thought \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} A &= A & \\mbox{Law of Identity (p. 74)}\\\\ Aa\n&= o & \\mbox{Law of Contradiction (p. 74)}\\\\ A &= AB\n\\ORjev Ab & \\mbox{Law of Duality (p. 74)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nFor his single rule of inference Jevons chose his principle of\nsubstitution\u2014in modern terms this was essentially a combination\nof ground replacement and transitivity. He showed how to derive\ntransitivity of equality from this; he could have derived symmetry as\nwell but did not. The associative law was missing\u2014it was\nimplicit in the lack of parentheses in his expressions.\n\nIt was only in his Studies in Deductive Logic (1880) that\nJevons mentioned McColl\u2019s use of an accent to indicate negation. After\nnoting that McColl\u2019s accent allowed one to take the negation of\ncomplex bracketed terms he went on to say that, for the most part, he\nfound the notation of De Morgan, the notation that he had always used,\nto be the more elegant.\n",
