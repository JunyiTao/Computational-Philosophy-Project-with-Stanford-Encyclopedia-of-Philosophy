    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes || Epistemology\n3.2 Epistemology\n\nFeminists and pragmatists share an interest in the situatedness of the\nknower within their social environment. They are both committed to an\nepistemology that is based in experience and relationality.\nFeminist-pragmatists point out that the search for universalized\nideals bankrupts ordinary experience and robs from philosophic thought\nthe creativity of thinking with and through complex networks of\nexperience and interaction. In Pragmatism and Feminism,\nSeigfried highlights aspects of pragmatism that make it useful to\nfeminist epistemology, noting both fields share a critique of dualism.\nSeigfried reminds her reader of four dualistic aspects of\nrationalistic philosophy critiqued by Dewey and some feminists for its\noppressive support of invidious social/economic hierarchies. The four\ndimensions of this rationalist approach include:\n\nThe depreciation of doing and making and the over-evaluation of\npure thinking and reflection;\n the contempt for bodies and matter and simultaneous praise of\nspirit and immateriality,\n the sharp division of practice and theory, and\n the inferiority of change and superiority of a fixed reality.\n(Seigfried 1996: 113)\n\n\nJane Duran, in \u201cThe Intersection of Pragmatism and\nFeminism\u201d (1993), points out that feminist theorists critique\nthis preoccupation with universals, writing that it seems \u201cto\npervade much of analytic philosophy (indeed philosophy as a\nwhole)\u201d. This desire for universals, she says, leads all the way\nback to Plato. Plato\u2019s idealism carries with it a devaluation of\nthe changing realm of the physical world. Duran points out that\nfeminists, as well as pragmatists, are often less interested in\nuniversal generalities and notes that an emphasis on particulars as\nwell as \u201crelations and connections become almost more important\nthan particulars themselves\u201d (1993: 166). This pluralistic sense\nof refusing to constrict reality to that which is defined by logic or\nlanguage helps feminists as philosophers propose an alternative vision\nof philosophy.\n\nSusan Dielman points to the importance of discourse and\nlanguage analysis in addressing hegemonic epistemic exclusions; she\nbrings neopragmatist theory, specifically that of Richard Rorty, into\nthe feminist pragmatist dialogue in order to understand \u201cthe\ninterconnectedness of power and discourse\u201d (2012: 99).\n\nFeminist pragmatists have also built on John Dewey\u2019s concept of\nexperience as philosophical support for a position that holds together\nthe subject and object in a nondualistic epistemology. Yet, as\npostcolonial feminists have pointed out, experience in itself is\nconditioned by one\u2019s cultural background. Ofelia Schutte (2000)\nnotes that \u201cthe nature of knowledge is not culture-free but is\ndetermined by the methodologies and data legitimated by dominant\ncultures\u201d (2000: 40). Feminist-pragmatist Celia T.\nBardwell-Jones (2008) draws on Josiah Royce\u2019s theory of\ninterpretation to address the problem of translation \u201cat the\nborders of conflicting experience\u2026where differences are\ntranslated instead of assimilated\u201d (2008: 22). Such\nepistemological translation work is essential for feminists and\npragmatists, given that in both fields theory is inherently about\nchanging the world. Jane Addams embodied this intersection of\npragmatism and feminism in her efforts to interpret across class and\ncultural boundaries; through this interpretative and activist work she\nsought to reconstruct the social order and increase justice for women\nand the underprivileged. Addams\u2019 understanding of the\nrelationship between action and truth contributed to her choice of a\ncareer in the public world. For her, a motivation to understand truth\nwould compel her to seek it out in the world of action. As a public\nphilosopher, reformer, and activist embedded in her community, Addams\nwas called to act under inherently messy, dynamic, and ambiguous\nsituations (see Fischer 2005, 2011, 2013 and Lake 2014, 2015). This\ninterpretive activism opened opportunities for reconstruction,\nredefining relations between the public and the expert, students and\nthe instructor, the governed and the governors.\n\nSimilarly contemporary feminist thinkers have changed the academy and\nthe larger culture by re-analyzing and reconstructing the ways that we\nthink, the hierarchies of knowing, as well as the social conventions\nthat have defined gender. Erin McKenna in The Task of Utopia:\nPragmatist and Feminist Perspective (2001) uses this\nprocess-orientation to create a social/political philosophy that is\nalways open to change, rather than one with finished\n\u201cends\u201d in view. With both feminism and pragmatism we can\nconsider philosophizing contextually as a creative force, reacting to\nas well as reconstructing our multiple environments.\n\nFeminist social analysis often produces the conditions for philosophic\nreflection, creating what Addams called \u201cperplexities\u201d\nthat are the starting-points for philosophical and political change\n(1902 [2002]: 77). In \u201cFeminist-Pragmatist Revisioning of Reason,\nKnowledge, and Philosophy\u201d (1993), Phyllis Rooney notes that the\nclassical pragmatists would have welcomed the challenges that\ncontemporary feminisms have brought to philosophy. She compares these\nrifts to what Peirce called the \u201cirritations of doubt\u201d (Peirce\n1877, quoted in Rooney 1993: 21) which open the door to inquiry and\nsignal possibilities for recreation and rediscovery. Dewey called this\nirritation \u201can unsettlement\u201d which \u201caims at\novercoming a disturbance\u201d or the \u201cuncertainties of\nlife\u201d (1916 [1985]: 336\u2013337), which he says, are the\nmotivations for beginning to do philosophy. In Democracy and\nSocial Ethics, Addams references moments of\n\u201cperplexities\u201d as openings to begin rethinking social\nvalues and epistemological claims. Pragmatism and feminism then share\na movement toward active philosophizing about those\n\u201cirritations\u201d, \u201cuncertainties\u201d, and\n\u201cperplexities\u201d.\n\nFeminist epistemologists such as Susan Bordo and Alison Jaggar point\nout how traditional philosophy\u2019s emphasis on rational, logical\nabsolutes has devalued the ambiguities of changing embodied\nexperience. Feminist and pragmatists have both rejected body/mind\ndualisms. Shannon Sullivan in Living Across and Through Skins\n(2001) brings the pragmatist tradition of transactional knowing\nthrough embodied and relational lived experience to the feminist\nepistemology of standpoint theory, describing what she calls a\n\u201cpragmatist-feminist standpoint theory\u201d. This\npragmatist-feminist perspective suggests knowing unfolds in\nrelationships enacted through our physical embodiment and the social\nenvironment; knowing should thus incorporate \u201cmultiple\nmarginalized perspectives\u201d. Using Dewey\u2019s standard of\ntruth as that which results in \u201ctransactional flourishing\u201d\nSullivan considers \u201cquestions about which standpoints can help\npromote flourishing transactions\u201d (2001: 146\u201347). In doing\nso, she corrects the privileging of women\u2019s experiences that is\nfound in Sandra Harding\u2019s feminist standpoint theory, and\nlocates knowing as transactions among diverse others, possibly even\nnon-humans. Sullivan\u2019s work is particularly significant in the\nways she investigates feminist issues of embodiment drawing on both\nContinental and American Pragmatist perspectives.\n\nWicked problem scholars and community change-agents Valerie Brown and\nJudith Lambert also employ a feminist pragmatist epistemology in their\n2013 Collective Learning for Transformational Change: A Guide to\nCollaborative Action. Brown and Lambert, for instance, argue that\nsustainable and just transformational change on our collective social\nproblems requires we begin by first sharing our values. Since our core\nvalues tend to shape our perspective and our actions, recognizing the\nrange of values involved explicates the complexities. Their model also\nemphasizes individual narratives and legitimizes a range of knowledge,\nincluding individual, community, specialized, organizational,\nholistic, and collective knowledge cultures (2013: \n 22).[2]\nThis shared epistemological framework has had\u2014and continues to\nhave\u2014a significant influence on educational practices.\n",
