    "main_text": "Metatheory || Cut-Elimination and Cut-Simulation\n3.4 Cut-Elimination and Cut-Simulation\n\nCut-elimination proofs (see also the SEP entry on\n proof theory)\n for Church\u2019s type theory, which are often closely related to\nsuch proofs (Takahashi 1967, 1970; Prawitz 1968; Mints 1999) for other\nformulations of type theory, may be found in Andrews 1971, Dowek &\nWerner 2003, and Brown 2004. In Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2009 it is\nshown how certain wffs\\(_{{o}}\\), such as axioms of extensionality,\ndescriptions, choice (see\n Sections 1.3.3\n to\n 1.3.5),\n and induction, can be used to justify cuts in cut-free sequent\ncalculi for elementary type theory. Moreover, the notions of\ncut-simulation and cut-strong axioms are introduced\nin this work, and the need for omitting defined equality and for\neliminating cut-strong axioms such as extensionality,\ndescription, choice and induction in machine-oriented calculi (e.g.,\nby replacing them with more constrained, goal-directed rules) in order\nto reduce cut-simulation effects are discussed as a major\nchallenge for higher-order automated theorem proving. In other words,\nincluding cut-strong axioms in a machine-oriented proof calculus for\nChurch\u2019s type theory is essentially as bad as including a cut\nrule, since the cut rule can be mimicked by them.\n",
