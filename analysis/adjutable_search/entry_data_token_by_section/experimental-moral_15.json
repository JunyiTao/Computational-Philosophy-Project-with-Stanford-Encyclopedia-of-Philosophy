    "main_text": "Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy || Folk Metaethics and Moral Realism\n4.1 Folk Metaethics and Moral Realism\n\nMuch contemporary metaethics relies on assumptions about the nature of\nordinary moral thought, discourse, and practice; metaethicists tend to\nsee their project as essentially conservative. For example, Michael\nSmith writes that the first step in metaethical theorizing is to\n\u201cidentify features that are manifest in ordinary moral\npractice\u201d and the second step is to \u201cmake sense of a\npractice having these features.\u201d (1994) This assumption has had\na major impact on the debate between realists and anti-realists, with\nrealists claiming to best capture the nature of ordinary moral\ndiscourse: \u201cWe begin as (tacit) cognitivists and realists about\nethics,\u201d says Brink (1989), and then \u201cwe are led to some\nform of antirealism (if we are) only because we come to regard the\nmoral realist\u2019s commitments as untenable\u2026 Moral realism\nshould be our metaethical starting point, and we should give it up\nonly if it does involve unacceptable metaphysical and epistemological\ncommitments.\u201d\n\nBut experimental work has cast doubt on this claim, beginning with\nDarley and Goodwin (2008), and continued by James Beebe (2014) and\nothers (Wright et al. 2013; Campbell & Kumar 2012; Goodwin &\nDarley 2010; Sarkissian et al. 2011; but see Sousa et al.\n2021; for review, see P\u00f6lzler & Wright 2019). Goodwin\nand Darley asked subjects to rate their agreement with statements\ndrawn from the moral, ethical, and aesthetic domain, and asked\nsubjects whether they agreed with the statement (for example,\n\u201cbefore the 3rd month of pregnancy, abortion for any reason (of\nthe mother\u2019s) is morally permissible,\u201d), whether they\nthought it represented a fact or an opinion or\nattitude, and whether, if someone were to disagree with them\nabout the statement, at least one of the disputants would have to be\nmistaken. (We will say more about the authors\u2019 use of\ndisagreement as a proxy for realism in the following section.) In\ngeneral, subjects rated moral statements as less factual than\nobviously factual statements (e.g. \u201cthe earth is at the center\nof the universe,\u201d) but more factual than statements about\nmatters of taste or etiquette. What is striking about these findings\nis not just that people are not straightforwardly realist, but that\nthey seem to treat moral questions variably (Wright, Grandjean\n& McWhite 2013): some are treated as matters of fact, others\nas matters of opinion. This pattern has been replicated in several\nstudies, and persists even when subjects are allowed to determine for\nthemselves which issues to assign to the moral domain, suggesting that\nsubjects do not think moral claims are uniformly objective\n\nA question that remains is how to explain this variation: are people\nbeing inconsistent? Are they tracking something besides the moral\nquestion\u2014perhaps the degree of consensus that exists about a\nquestion? Further research may help shed some light on these issues,\nbut even if the questions are answered in the affirmative, the\nrealist\u2019s claim to capture folk morality is called into\nquestion, since these experiments suggest that folk intuitions are\neither not uniformly realist, or they are confused (and hence poorly\nsuited for a role in metaethical theorizing). Another response to\nthese findings is that they reveal a kind of folk metaethical\npluralism. For example, Michael Gill (2008, 2009) and Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong (2009) have suggested a noncognitivist treatment of\nsome areas of morality and cognitivism about others. This response is\nunder-motivated by empirical data, however, since such data shows at\nmost that our judgments about the extent to which moral claims\ndescribe mind-independent facts is variable, and not that their\nsemantics itself varies. Nor does such data settle the question\nwhether our moral judgments are beliefs or another conative state:\nwhile experimental data can reveal a role for emotion in moral\njudgment, as discussed above, it does not show that in such cases\nbelief is absent. We will discuss limitations on experimental moral\nphilosophy in more detail in Section 5 below. For now, it seems that\ndata about folk realism are best viewed as undermining one of the most\ncommonly-cited sources of evidence for moral realism, namely, that it\ncaptures our ordinary moral discourse and practice better than its\ncompetitors. A further question, open to exploration, is whether an\nanti-realist view might do better at capturing and explaining our folk\nintuitions than realist competitors.\n",
