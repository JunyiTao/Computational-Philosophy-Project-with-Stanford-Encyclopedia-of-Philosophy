    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || Supervenience and Explanation\n3.7 Supervenience and Explanation\n\nSupervenience claims, by themselves, do nothing more than state that\ncertain patterns of property (or fact) variation hold. They are silent\nabout why those patterns hold, and about the precise nature of the\ndependency involved (see Kim 1993, 167; 1998, 9\u201315; Blackburn\n1984, 186; Schiffer 1987, 153\u2013154; and McGinn 1993, 57). But few\nsupervenience theses are plausibly brute, that is, unexplainable. It\nis natural to look further, and to try to explain why\nA-properties supervene on B-properties. When such\nsupervenience is explainable, there is\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019 (a term coined by William Lycan; see\nalso Schiffer 1987; Horgan 1993; and Wilson 1999).\n\nSometimes it is easy to see what explains a supervenience thesis.\nConsider the examples of trivial supervenience relations from\n Section 3.5.\n It is obvious why there cannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference if A is a set of necessary or\nimpossible properties\u2014namely, because there cannot be an\nA-difference at all. The supervenience relation is explained\nby the necessity or impossibility of the supervening properties. It is\nalso obvious why A-properties supervene on\nA-properties. Of course, property identity claims are\nsometimes not a priori knowable; consider, for example, the\nfact that the property being water is identical with the\nproperty being H20. Still the fact\nthat being water is identical with being\nH20 explains why there cannot be a\ndifference with respect to being water without a difference with\nrespect to being H20. And supervenience with\nonly nomological necessity can be explained by appeal to laws of\nnature. It is in virtue of the Wiedemann-Franz Law that electrical\nconductivity supervenes with nomological necessity on thermal\nconductivity.\n\nBecause we expect supervenience theses to be explainable, it is hard\nfor us to rest content with a supervenience thesis if we do not see\nwhat would explain why it is true. If it is claimed, for instance,\nthat moral properties supervene on non-moral properties, we expect\nthere to be an explanation of why this is so. Appeals to unexplainable\nsupervenience theses can thus seem to be mystery mongering.\n",
