    "main_text": "History, Problems, and Issues\n1. History, Problems, and Issues\n\nTraditional epistemology has its roots in Plato and the ancient\nskeptics. One strand emerges from Plato\u2019s interest in the\nproblem of distinguishing between knowledge and true belief. His\nsolution was to suggest that knowledge differs from true belief in\nbeing justified. Ancient skeptics complained that all attempts to\nprovide any such justification were hopelessly flawed. Another strand\nemerges from the attempt to provide a reconstruction of human\nknowledge showing how the pieces of human knowledge fit together in a\nstructure of mutual support. This project got its modern stamp from\nDescartes and comes in empiricist as well as rationalist versions\nwhich in turn can be given either a foundational or coherentist twist.\nThe two strands are woven together by a common theme. The bonds that\nhold the reconstruction of human knowledge together are the\njustificational and evidential relations which enable us to\ndistinguish knowledge from true belief. \n\nThe traditional approach is predicated on the assumption that\nepistemological questions have to be answered in ways which do not\npresuppose any particular knowledge. The argument is that any such\nappeal would obviously be question begging. Such approaches may be\nappropriately labeled \u201ctranscendental.\u201d\n\nThe Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century suggested an\nalternative approach first explored by Dewey and the pragmatists.\nHuman beings, as the products of evolutionary development, are natural\nbeings. Their capacities for knowledge and belief are also the\nproducts of a natural evolutionary development. As such, there is some\nreason to suspect that knowing, as a natural activity, could and\nshould be treated and analyzed along lines compatible with its status,\ni.e., by the methods of natural science. On this view, there is no\nsharp division of labor between science and epistemology. In\nparticular, the results of particular sciences such as evolutionary\nbiology and psychology are not ruled a priori irrelevant to\nthe solution of epistemological problems. Such approaches, in general,\nare called naturalistic epistemologies, whether they are directly\nmotivated by evolutionary considerations or not. Those which are\ndirectly motivated by evolutionary considerations and which argue that\nthe growth of knowledge follows the pattern of evolution in biology\nare called \u201cevolutionary epistemologies.\u201d\n\nEvolutionary epistemology is the attempt to address questions in the\ntheory of knowledge from an evolutionary point of view. Evolutionary\nepistemology involves, in part, deploying models and metaphors drawn\nfrom evolutionary biology in the attempt to characterize and resolve\nissues arising in epistemology and conceptual change. As disciplines\nco-evolve, models are traded back and forth. Thus, evolutionary\nepistemology also involves attempts to understand how biological\nevolution proceeds by interpreting it through models drawn from our\nunderstanding of conceptual change and the development of theories.\nThe term \u201cevolutionary epistemology\u201d was coined by Donald\nCampbell (1974a).\n",
