    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems\n2. Three Jury Theorems\n\nThis section states and discusses three jury theorems about majority\ndecisions between two alternatives. They assume a population of\nindividuals, labelled \\(1, 2, \\ldots,\\) representing the possible\nmembers of the decision-making group. The population might contain,\nfor example, all citizens of a state (for a political decision) or all\nscientists (for a scientific decision). It is infinite\u2014an\nidealisation needed for considering arbitrarily large decision bodies.\nThe group has any finite size \\(n\\geq1\\) and consists of the first\n\\(n\\) individuals \\(1, 2, \\ldots, n.\\) Each member votes for one\nalternative. The alternative receiving a majority wins (if \\(n\\) is\neven, there can be a tie without collective decision). Following the\nepistemic approach, one alternative is correct (right,\nbetter, etc.) and the other is incorrect (wrong, worse,\netc.), independently of the decision process. This makes any\nindividual judgment and any group decision correct or incorrect.\n\nJury theorems operate in a probabilistic framework: anything unknown\nis modelled as a random event or variable (defined relative to some\nbackground probability\n space[1]).\n\nNotation: For any jury theorem of the entry, the probability\nfunction (of the underlying probability space) is denoted \\(P\\). Where\nneeded by a jury theorem, the event that individual \\(i (=1, 2,\n\\ldots)\\) is correct is denoted \\(R_{i}\\), and for each possible group\nsize \\(n\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) the event that a majority is correct\n(i.e., that more than half of \\(R_{1},\\ldots,R_{n}\\) hold) is denoted\n \\(\\Maj_{n}\\).[2]\n",
