    "main_text": "Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism || Some Other Early Neutral Monists\n2.4 Some Other Early Neutral Monists\n\nThere are, of course, many other philosophers whom one might want to\ninclude in the list of neutral monists. In the German-speaking world,\nwe find Richard Avenarius (1843\u201396), who was in contact with\nMach, and Joseph Petzoldt (1862\u20131929), who built on the work of\nAvenarius. Avenarius\u2019s main reflections on neutral monism are\ncontained in his 1888/90, 1891, and 1894/95. Petzoldt\u2019s relevant\nworks are his 1900, 1904 and 1906. In the English-speaking world,\nneutral monism thrived within the movement of American new realism.\nArguably, John Dewey (1859\u20131952) was the most eminent figure in\nthis group of neutral monists, but Ralph Barton Perry\n(1876\u20131957)\u2014a student and friend of James\u2014is the one\nmost closely associated with the\n view.[13]\n Perry\u2019s 1912 is the main source for his views about neutral\nmonism. Edwin B. Holt (1873\u20131946) developed an ambitious neutral\nmonist program in his 1912 and 1914. Other notable early neutral\nmonists include Alois Riehl (1844\u20131924), Alexander Bogdanov\n(1873\u20131928), Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936), and (for a time)\nRudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970) and Alfred Ayer (1910\u201389), among\nothers.\n",
