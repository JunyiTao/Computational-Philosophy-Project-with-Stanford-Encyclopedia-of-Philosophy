    "main_text": "Introduction: Goals and methods of computational linguistics || Methods of computational linguistics\n1.2 Methods of computational linguistics\n\nThe methods employed in theoretical and practical research in\ncomputational linguistics have often drawn upon theories and findings\nin theoretical linguistics, philosophical logic, cognitive science\n(especially psycholinguistics), and of course computer science.\nHowever, early work from the mid-1950s to around 1970 tended to be\nrather theory-neutral, the primary concern being the development of\npractical techniques for such applications as MT and simple QA. In MT,\ncentral issues were lexical structure and content, the characterization\nof \u201csublanguages\u201d for particular domains (for example, weather\nreports), and the transduction from one language to another (for\nexample, using rather ad hoc graph transformation grammars or transfer\ngrammars). In QA, the concern was with characterizing the question\npatterns encountered in a specific domain, and the relationship of\nthese question patterns to the forms in which answers might stored, for\ninstance in a relational database.\nBy the mid-1960s a number of researchers emboldened by the increasing\npower and availability of general-purpose computers, and inspired by\nthe dream of human-level artificial intelligence, were designing\nsystems aimed at genuine language understanding and dialogue. The\ntechniques and theoretical underpinnings employed varied greatly. An\nexample of a program minimally dependent on linguistic or cognitive\ntheory was Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA program, intended to emulate (or\nperhaps caricature) a Rogerian psychiatrist. ELIZA relied on matching\nuser inputs to stored patterns (brief word sequences interspersed with\nnumbered slots, to be filled from the input), and returned one of a set\nof output templates associated with the matched input pattern,\ninstantiated with material from the input. While ELIZA and its modern\nchatbot descendants are often said to rely on mere trickery, it can be\nargued that human verbal behavior is to some degree reflexive in the\nmanner of ELIZA, i.e., we\nfunction in \u201cpreprogrammed\u201d or formulaic\nmanner in certain situations, for example, in exchanging greetings, or\nin responding at a noisy party to comments whose contents, apart from\nan occasional word, eluded us.\nA very different perspective on linguistic processing was proffered in\nthe early years by researchers who took their cue from ideas about\nassociative processes in the brain. For example, M. Ross Quillian (1968)\nproposed a model of word sense disambiguation based on \u201cspreading\nactivation\u201d in a network of concepts (typically corresponding to senses\nof nouns) interconnected through relational links (typically\ncorresponding to senses of verbs or prepositions). Variants of this\n\u201csemantic memory\u201d model were pursued by researchers such as Rumelhart,\nLindsay and Norman (1972), and remain as an active research paradigm in\ncomputational models of language and cognition. Another psychologically\ninspired line of work was initiated in the 1960s and pursued for over\ntwo decades by Roger Schank and his associates, but in his case the\ngoal was full story understanding and inferential question answering. A\ncentral tenet of the work was that the representation of sentential\nmeaning as well as world knowledge centered around a few (e.g., 11)\naction primitives, and inference was driven by rules associated\nprimarily with these primitives; (a prominent exponent of a similar\nview was Yorick Wilks). Perhaps the most important aspect of Schank's\nwork was the recognition that language understanding and inference were\nheavily dependent on a large store of background knowledge, including\nknowledge of numerous \u201cscripts\u201d (prototypical ways in which familiar\nkinds of complex events, such as dining at a restaurant, unfold) and\nplans (prototypical ways in which people attempt to accomplish their\ngoals) (Schank & Abelson 1977).\nMore purely AI-inspired approaches that also emerged in the 1960s\nwere exemplified in systems such as Sad Sam\n(Lindsay 1963), Sir (Raphael 1968)\nand Student (Bobrow 1968). These featured\ndevices such as pattern matching/transduction for analyzing and\ninterpreting restricted subsets of English, knowledge in the form of\nrelational hierarchies and attribute-value lists, and QA methods based\non graph search, formal deduction protocols and numerical algebra. An\ninfluential idea that emerged slightly later was that knowledge in AI\nsystems should be framed procedurally rather than\ndeclaratively\u2014to know something is to be able to perform certain\nfunctions (Hewitt 1969). Two quite impressive systems that exemplified\nsuch a methodology were shrdlu (Winograd 1972)\nand\nLunar (Woods et al. 1972), which contained\nsophisticated proceduralized grammars  and syntax-to-semantics\nmapping rules, and were able to function fairly robustly in their\n\u201cmicro-domains\u201d (simulated blocks on a table, and a lunar rock\ndatabase, respectively). In addition, shrdlu featured\nsignificant planning abilities, enabled by the\nmicroplanner goal-chaining language (a precursor of\nProlog). Difficulties that remained for all of these approaches were\nextending linguistic coverage and the reliability of parsing and\ninterpretation, and most of all, moving from microdomains, or coverage\nof a few paragraphs of text, to more varied, broader domains. Much of\nthe difficulty of scaling up was attributed to the \u201cknowledge\nacquisition bottleneck\u201d\u2014the difficulty of coding or acquiring the\nmyriad facts and rules evidently required for more general\nunderstanding. Classic collections containing several articles on the\nearly work mentioned in the last two paragraphs are Marvin\nMinsky's Semantic Information Processing (1968) and Schank\nand Colby's Computer Models of Thought and Language (1973).\n\n\nSince the 1970s, there has been a gradual trend away from purely\nprocedural approaches to ones aimed at encoding the bulk of linguistic\nand world knowledge in more understandable, modular, re-usable forms,\nwith firmer theoretical foundations. This trend was enabled by the\nemergence of comprehensive syntactico-semantic frameworks such as\nGeneralized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG), Head-driven Phrase\nStructure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG),\nTree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG), and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG),\nwhere in each case close theoretical attention was paid both to the\ncomputational tractability of parsing, and the mapping from syntax to\nsemantics. Among the most important developments in the latter area\nwere Richard Montague's profound insights into the logical (especially\nintensional) semantics of language, and Hans Kamp's and Irene Heim's\ndevelopment of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), offering a\nsystematic, semantically formal account of anaphora in language.\n\n\nA major shift in nearly all aspects of natural language processing\nbegan in the late 1980s and was virtually complete by the end of 1995:\nthis was the shift to corpus-based, statistical approaches (signalled\nfor instance by the appearance of two special issues on the subject by\nthe quarterly Computational Linguistics in 1993). The new\nparadigm was enabled by the increasing availability and burgeoning\nvolume of machine-readable text and speech data, and was driven\nforward by the growing awareness of the importance of the\ndistributional properties of language, the development of powerful new\nstatistically based learning techniques, and the hope that these\ntechniques would overcome the scalability problems that had beset\ncomputational linguistics (and more broadly AI) since its\nbeginnings.\nThe corpus-based approach has indeed been quite successful in producing\ncomprehensive, moderately accurate speech recognizers, part-of-speech\n(POS) taggers, parsers for learned probabilistic phrase-structure\ngrammars, and even MT and text-based QA systems and summarization\nsystems. However, semantic processing has been restricted to rather\nshallow aspects, such as extraction of specific data concerning\nspecific kinds of events from text (e.g.,\nlocation, date, perpetrators,\nvictims, etc., of terrorist bombings) or extraction of clusters of\nargument types, relational tuples, or paraphrase sets from text\ncorpora. Currently, the corpus-based, statistical approaches are still\ndominant, but there appears to be a growing movement towards\nintegration of formal logical approaches to language with corpus-based\nstatistical approaches in order to achieve deeper understanding and\nmore intelligent behavior in language comprehension and dialogue\nsystems. There are also efforts to combine connectionist and neural-net\napproaches with symbolic and logical ones. The following sections will\nelaborate on many of the topics touched on above.
