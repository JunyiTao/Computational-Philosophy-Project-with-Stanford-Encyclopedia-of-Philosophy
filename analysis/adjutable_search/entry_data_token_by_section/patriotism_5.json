    "main_text": "Normative issues || The moral standing of patriotism\n3. The political import of patriotism\n\nWhile moral philosophers debate the standing of patriotism as an\ninstance of the problem of reconciling universal moral considerations\nwith particular attachments and loyalties, political theorists are\nprimarily interested in patriotism as an ethos of the well-ordered\npolity and an antidote to nationalism. Since the rise of the\nnation-state, it has been widely held that some form of nationalism is\nindispensable as a pre-political basis of the unity of the state that\nmakes for solidarity among citizens and provides them with motivation\nto participate in public life and make sacrifices for the common good.\nAs Roger Scruton put it, \u201cfor a liberal state to be secure, the\ncitizens must understand the national interest as something\nother than the interest of the state. Only the first can\nevoke in them the sacrificial spirit upon which the second\ndepends\u201d (Scruton 1990, 319). But in the course of the\n20th century nationalism was deeply compromised. That has\nled political theorists to look for alternatives. Some have argued\nthat an emphatically political patriotism could perform the unifying\nfunction of nationalism while avoiding its perils. This \u201cnew\npatriotism\u201d puts aside, or at least de-emphasizes, pre-political\nties such as common ancestry, language, or culture, and enjoins love\nof, and loyalty to, one\u2019s political community, its laws and\ninstitutions, and the rights and liberties they make possible.\n\nIn view of the disastrous record of national socialism, it is not\nsurprising that German thinkers in particular should be suspicious of\npatriotism as long as it has not been dissociated from nationalism. As\nearly as 1959, political theorist Dolf Sternberger called for a new\nunderstanding of the concept of fatherland. \u201cThe fatherland is\nthe \u2018republic,\u2019 which we create for ourselves. The\nfatherland is the constitution, to which we give life. The fatherland\nis the freedom which we truly enjoy only when we ourselves promote it,\nmake use of it, and stand guard over it\u201d (Sternberger 1990, 12).\nIn 1979, on the 30th anniversary of the Federal Republic,\nhe coined the term \u201cconstitutional patriotism\u201d\n(Verfassungspatriotismus) to describe the loyalty to the\npatria understood in these terms (13\u201316). The term was\nlater adopted by J\u00fcrgen Habermas in the context of a case for\novercoming pre-political, i.e. national and cultural, loyalties in\npublic life, and supplanting them with a new, postnational, purely\npolitical identity embodied in the laws and institutions of a free and\ndemocratic state. Habermas argues that this identity, expressed in and\nreinforced by constitutional patriotism, can provide a solid\nfoundation for such a state, given the ethnic and cultural\nheterogeneity characteristic of most countries in western Europe. It\ncan also facilitate further European integration, and provide an\nantidote to the \u201cchauvinism of affluence\u201d tempting these\ncountries (Habermas 1990).\n\nConstitutional patriotism is the most widely discussed, but not the\nsole variety of \u201cnew patriotism.\u201d Another is\n\u201ccovenanted patriotism\u201d advocated by John H. Schaar as\nappropriate for countries whose population is much too ethnically and\nculturally heterogeneous to allow for \u201cnatural\npatriotism.\u201d Schaar\u2019s paradigmatic example is the United\nStates, whose citizens \u201cwere bonded together not by blood or\nreligion, not by tradition or territory, not by the walls and\ntraditions of a city, but by a political idea \u2026 by a covenant,\nby dedication to a set of principles and by an exchange of promises to\nuphold and advance certain commitments\u201d (Schaar 1981, 291).\nStill another variety is the \u201cpatriotism of liberty\u201d\npropounded by Maurizio Viroli, who calls for a return to what\npatriotism used to be before it was harnessed in the service of the\nnation-state and submerged in nationalism: love of the laws and\ninstitutions of one\u2019s polity and the common liberty they make\npossible (Viroli 1995).\n\nThis new, emphatically political version of patriotism has been met\nwith both sympathy and skepticism. Those sympathetic to it have been\ndiscussing the prospects of a European constitutional patriotism (see\nM\u00fcller 2007, 93\u2013139). Skeptics have argued that patriotism\ndisconnected from all pre-political attachments and identities can\ngenerate only much too thin a sense of identity and much too weak a\nmotivation for political participation \u2013 that, thus understood,\n\u201cpatriotism is not enough\u201d (Canovan 2000).\n",
