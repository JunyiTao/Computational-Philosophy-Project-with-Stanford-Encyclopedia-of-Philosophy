    "main_text": "Ethics\n9. Ethics\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that Plato, as in other works,\naccepts rational eudaimonism in the Laws: that is, that he\nbelieves that each individual\u2019s goal, insofar as he is rational,\nis his own happiness or well-being (eudaimonia). Some of the\nmost explicit evidence for this can be found at Laws\n662C\u2013E, in which the Athenian presents as appropriate the demand\nthat the life that is recommended by an ancestor or a god be the\nhappiest and most pleasant\n life[64];\n but the emphasis the Laws places on the happiness of the\ncitizens as the aim of the laws and the importance it gives to showing\nthat virtue conduces to a happy and a pleasant life also suggest that\nPlato remains within a eudaimonist framework. The Laws also\noffers some discussion of what it is that is good for a human being\n(as we would expect if Plato remains a rational eudaimonist). Plato\ndistinguishes between human goods such as health, beauty, and wealth,\nand divine goods, namely the virtues, and claims that human goods are\nnot good independently of virtue. Instead, they are good for the good\nman, but bad for the bad man (661B\u2013C; cf. 631D). There are\nimportant questions here about the precise nature of human\neudaimonia and the precise way in which the human goods\nbenefit the good man and fail to benefit or even harm the bad man. Is\nvirtue sufficient or only necessary for\n eudaimonia?[65]\n Do the human goods benefit the good man only insofar as they increase\nhis capacity to act virtuously, and harm the bad man only insofar as\nthey increase his capacity to act viciously, or is there additional\nvalue and disvalue in the possession of human goods, e.g. are they\ngenuinely good in a way that can only be appreciated by those who are\n virtuous?[66]\n What is clear from this discussion, however, is that virtue is an\nessential component of human happiness and a precondition for all\nother benefit.\n\nSeveral passages in the Laws suggest that the sort of virtue\nthat Plato thinks the citizens of Magnesia ought to exhibit involves\nan impartialist sort of regard for the good of the cosmos as a whole\nrather than a special regard for one\u2019s own good. Perhaps the\nmost striking of these passages occur in the midst of the theological\ndiscussions in Book 10. Immediately after the Athenian\u2019s\narguments that god does not neglect men, he goes on to give a short\nspeech in which he declares that the cosmos has been put together by\ngod with a view to the safety and virtue of the whole, and that the\nparts of the cosmos \u2013 including human beings \u2013 have come\nto be for the sake of the eudaimonia (happiness or\nwell-being) of the whole\n cosmos[67]\n (Laws 903B\u2013D). This passage suggests that what it is\nproper for human beings to do, insofar as they are parts of the cosmos\nand generated for the sake of its eudaimonia, is to aim at\nits eudaimonia; and this suggestion is confirmed by a passage\nwhich follows closely upon this one, in which the Athenian portrays\nhuman beings as the allies and the possessions of the gods in a cosmic\nbattle of good against evil (Laws 905E8\u2013906B3).\nFinally, towards the beginning of the Great Prelude to the laws in\ngeneral, Plato warns about the evil of self-love and suggests that\nwhat each man must do instead is to love \u201cneither himself nor\nhis own belongings, but things just, whether they happen to be actions\nof his own or rather those of another man\u201d (Laws\n731D\u2013732A). This looks like a rejection of partiality to oneself\nas such, and a requirement to instead love what is of value. The\nargument turns on the thought that a lover is a bad judge of value, as\nhe is necessarily partial to what he loves. If this is right, the\nconclusion is very radical indeed: any sort of love that is directed\nat anything other than the just and good and fine will be problematic,\nand this will include love of family, friends, and fellow-citizens,\nexcept insofar as they are just, good and fine. While these three\npassages are different in detail, the picture that emerges from them\nis one on which what we are meant to do is to orient ourselves towards\nwhat is of genuine value and, perhaps as a consequence, to aim at the\nwell-being of the cosmos as a whole, rather than to be oriented\ntowards our own narrowly-construed good or the good of particular\nindividuals as such.\n\nThe discussion of these passages is still at a very early stage and no\nconsensus about how to understand them has yet emerged. However, if we\ndo think that they show that Plato held impartialist ethical views in\nthe Laws, we will be left with important questions about how\nto reconcile those views with his eudaimonism. What conception of an\nindividual\u2019s own happiness or well-being could yield as a\nconclusion that one ought to aim at the happiness or well-being of the\ncosmos as a whole rather than one\u2019s own (narrowly construed)\nhappiness? And what assumptions would make it plausible to think that\nmy aiming at the well-being of the whole would necessarily correspond\nto something that was worth calling my own\n good?[68]\n (Why, for example, couldn\u2019t my aiming at the well-being of the\nwhole call on me to sacrifice myself to the good of others to the\nextent that I was no longer able to cultivate my own virtue and thus\ncould not, according to the Dependency Thesis, be benefited by\nanything at\n all?[69])\n\nWe might also profitably compare Plato\u2019s ethical views in the\nLaws to those which he expresses in the Republic.\nPlato in the Republic famously claims that the\nphilosopher-kings will return to rule as a matter of necessity, and\nthere is a large literature exploring just how this fits into a\neudaimonist framework, given that it looks like the narrowly-construed\ngood of the philosopher-kings would be best served by contemplation of\nthe Forms. It would be worth exploring the relationship between the\ntwo dialogues on this point, especially given that the Laws\nseems to endorse a conception of an individual\u2019s well-being\nwhich could lead them to set aside their own, narrowly-construed\nwell-being in just as, if not more, radical a way than the\nRepublic.\n",
