    "main_text": "Preferences and choice\n5. Preferences and choice\n\nThere is a strong tradition, particularly in economics, to relate\npreference to choice. Preference is linked to hypothetical choice, and\nchoice to revealed preference. We begin this section by presenting\nchoice functions and some of their main properties. We then proceed to\ndiscuss how choice functions and their properties can be derived from\npreferences. Finally, we view the relationship from the other end, and\nintroduce some approaches to inferring preferences from observed\nchoices.\n",
