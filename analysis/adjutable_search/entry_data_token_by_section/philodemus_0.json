    "main_text": "Life || Early life\n1.1 Early life\n\n\nPhilodemus was born in the Greek city of Gadara, now Umm Qais in Jordan, a fortified\ncity on a ridge overlooking the southern tip of the Sea of Tiberias, whose main claim to fame in antiquity were its intellectual sons:\nbesides Philodemus, the Cynic philosophers and poets Menippus, Meleager\nand Oenomaus and the rhetors Theodorus and Apsines all hailed from\nGadara. Of Philodemus\u2019 life before he came to Italy, we know\nlittle. Scholars generally infer from Cicero\u2019s evidence that he\nwas born around 110 BCE, and a rough indication of his birthdate is the\nfact that his epigrams (see Section 2.1) were not included in\nthe \u2018Garland\u2019 edited, probably in the 90s BCE, by\nhis countryman Meleager, in which the latest poet to have his work\nincluded was born around 120 BCE.\n1.2 Alexandria, Athens, Sicily\n\n\nPhilodemus spent time in Alexandria, perhaps around 90\u201386 BCE, before\nhe went to Athens (Index Academicorum, PHerc. 1021\ncol. 34.3\u20135). His stay in the Egyptian capital, which had become\na center of intellectual production, is perhaps when Philodemus met\nand became friendly with Antiochus of Ascalon as well as various other\nphilosophers, perhaps including Epicureans, who may have urged him to\nmove on to Athens to study with Zeno (on Philodemus\u2019 time in\nAlexandria, see Fleischer 2016: 89\u2013104, also Fleischer 2017b on\nAcademics working in Alexandria at this time; on Philodemus\u2019 account\nof the history of the Academy, see Section 2.2.5.5).\n\nDuring his sojourn in Athens, Philodemus became attached to Zeno of\nSidon, the head of the Athenian Garden. He became a lifelong devotee\nof Zeno, an admirer of his work collecting and studying texts of the\nfirst generation of Epicureans, as well as his mode of teaching, which\nis reflected in Philodmus\u2019 treatise On Frank Criticism. He\npublished some books on the basis of Zeno\u2019s\nlectures\u2014e.g., On Frank Criticism\nand On Signs\u2014 and defended Zeno\u2019s views on, e.g., the\nrecognition of the technical character of panegyric or\n\u2018sophistic\u2019 rhetoric, which he insisted was the view of\nthe school\u2019s founders, as well.\n\n\nThe date of Philodemus\u2019 departure from Athens is unknown: he\nmay have been part of the mass exodus of intellectuals and others in\nthe wake of the Mithridatic Wars of 88\u201386 or of Rome\u2019s campaigns\nin Asia of 74\u201365; perhaps he left Athens on the death of Zeno, to whom\nhe proclaims his devotion. One source has a certain Philodemus driven\nfrom the Sicilian town of Himera when his teachings were thought to\nhave incurred divine wrath in the form of an epidemic (Aelian, in\nSuda, s.vv. Himeraiai, sukophantein, and\ntim\u00f4ntai; cf. Sider 1997, 9\u201310). The reconstruction of the testimonium is somewhat difficult, and nothing says that it must have to do with our Philodemus. Still, it would not be unusual for an Epicurean to be accused of atheism, and new readings in Philodemus\u2019 Index Academicorum (cf. Fleischer 2017b) show that he did indeed spend time in Sicily.\n1.3 Italy\n\n\nIn any event, Philodemus\u2019 arrival in Italy may not be placed\nlong after 70. For in the historical record, Philodemus is known to us\nprimarily as the Greek philosopher and poet associated with the Roman\nsenator L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (ca. 101\u2013post 43, cos. 58) by\nCicero (In Pisonem 68\u201372, 74; the name is supplied by the commentator Asconius ad 68: \u2018He means Philodemus, who was at that time a most excellent Epicurean and whose poems are lubricious\u2019; cf.\nSider 1997: T2, 228\u201330). Here, Cicero speaks of Philodemus, without\nnaming him, as Piso\u2019s constant companion since the Roman, as a\nyoung man, sought his company, having heard this Epicurean advocate\npleasure as the goal of life. Cicero notes that Philodemus was a\ngentleman when not in Piso\u2019s company and that he cultivated arts\nfor which Epicureans were not generally known, writing extremely\nelegant and witty poetry, and indicates (In Pis. 70) that\nPhilodemus, eager to please, could not turn a deaf ear to Piso, a Roman\nsenator, despite the latter\u2019s tendency to ignore the fine\ndistinctions with which the doctrine of pleasure was hedged about. If\nthe accuracy of this polemical account may be relied upon, this would\nmean that Piso, who was born around 101 BCE, would have been at least\n30\u2014the minimum age for entry into the Senate\u2014at the time of\ntheir meeting, though Cicero terms him \u2018young man\u2019\n(adulescens).\n\n\nBy 55 BCE, when Cicero attacked Piso, Philodemus could be firmly\nassociated with him. Philodemus addressed his book On the Good King\naccording to Homer, to a young relation of Piso\u2019s. He also\naddressed the fourth book of his Rhetoric to C. Vibius Pansa\nCaetronianus, who died fighting Antony at Forum Gallorum in April of\n43. One reference to a Roman event, Antony\u2019s supplying of dwarfs\nfrom Syria for gladiatorial games (De Signis col. ii.18),\nperhaps implies a terminus post quem of 40 (Last 1922, 177\u201380;\ncontra, Sider 1997, 11). If he was born around 110, Philodemus\ncould have lived into the later 30s.\n1.4 Naples, Herculaneum, and the Villa of the Papyri\n\n\nPhilodemus and Piso may have begun their association in Rome, where\nthe rising young politician will certainly have spent much time, or\nelse in Campania, well-known as a haunt of Epicureans, especially of\nSiro, teacher of Vergil and Horace, and where Philodemus too seems to\nhave taught. Siro and Philodemus, whom Cicero calls \u2018excellent\nmen and very learned\u2019, are associated as living in Naples and\nengaging in philosophical discussions (Cicero, On Moral Ends\n2.119 [T1 Sider]). Several books of Philodemus\u2019 On Vices\naddress a coterie of poetically minded Romans, Vergil along with three\nother associates of Maecenas and friends of Horace: L. Varius Rufus,\nPlotius Tucca, P. Quintilius Varus (PHerc. 1082 col. xi, and a treatise on calumny in \nPHerc. Paris, 2; cf. Horace, Satires 1.5,\n1.10 and Sider 1997: 19\u201323).\n\n\nIt is often assumed that Philodemus lived and worked, and perhaps\neven gathered an Epicurean circle of friends, in the luxurious villa on\nthe edge of the Campanian seaside town of Herculaneum in the ruins of\nwhich the papyri of his works were found, dubbed \u2018Villa of the\nPapyri\u2019 (see Section 2.2.1). A nest of conjectures has\nbeen woven on the basis of the presence of the papyri in the Villa,\nespecially of multiple copies of some of Philodemus\u2019 and\nEpicurus\u2019 works, as well as of an apparent draft copy of one work (the Index Academicorum, a manuscript that may be in the format of the \u2018model book\u2019 made to determine the length of further copies (On the Gods III), a few manuscripts that appear to bear stylistic corrections by Philodemus himself, if not in his own hand (see Essler 2017), and copies of the works of other Epicureans (Demetrius of Laconia,\nColotes, Polystratus, Carne\u00efscus, Metrodorus and Zeno of Sidon),\nalong with (at least) two books by the Stoic Chrysippus. There is also\na group of Latin papyri, apparently of non-philosophical character (a Latin poem on the battle of Actium in PHerc. 817 has long been known, and the historical work From the beginning of the Civil Wars by Seneca the Elder has recently been identified in PHerc. 1067),\nexcept perhaps for a manuscript of Lucretius. (On the contents of the\nlibrary at Herculaneum, see Sider 2005 and Delattre 2006; on the\nidentification by K. Kleve of a possible manuscript of Lucretius, see\nDelattre 2003.)\n\nThe conjecture that the Villa\nbelonged to the family of Piso is supported by the presence in the tablinum of a bust, popularly known as the \u2019Pseudo-Seneca\u2019 (MAAN 5616), which some scholars have identified as being of Philodemus\u2019 patron Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul in 58, d. ca. 42 BCE), and by the statue of Panathenaic Athena (MAAN 6007, from the square courtyard), a figure with whom Piso is associated by a statue base in Athens (on these statues see Mattusch 2005: 249\u2013253, 147\u2013151; on the Villa\u2019s owner 20\u201323, 357\u2013358); a bronze bust found in Herculaneum (MAAN 5601) of a young man identified as that of Piso\u2019s son Lucius, consul in 15 BCE and also pontifex and prefect of the city of Rome until his death in 32 CE, is not clearly from the Villa; it is in any case clear that the family of the Pisones had a villa in the resort of Baiai on the other side of the Bay of Naples. (For discussion of theories of the Villa\u2019s ownership, see Capasso 2010b.)\n\nIt is often thought that, if the Villa belonged to Piso, it may also have been where Philodemus himself lived\nand wrote, and that the book-rolls belonged to Philodemus\u2019 own\nlibrary, partly assembled in Athens before his arrival in Italy, and\nthen increased by his own writings, which were, perhaps, copied in a\nscriptorium on the premises, as they were composed and, in some cases,\nrecopied later (cf. Cavallo 1983). That at least the philosophical papyri belonged to\nPhilodemus is plausible: but there are some reasons to doubt the\nrest of this pleasing speculation.\n\n\nFirst, it is possible that more of the papyri were copied in the\nfirst century CE than has usually been thought, which would put them\noutside the lifetime of Philodemus. Rather a large number of scribes\nworked on the papyri, and there are indications that the copies we have\nwere only some among many copies of the same works. There is little\nindication, too, that the papyri were actually copied in Herculaneum;\nand we have little understanding of whatever book trade existed in\nCampania in the first century BCE. While Naples was a prominent Greek\ncity and may well have supported a trade in Greek books, as it\ncertainly supported an Epicurean school led by Siro, Rome was now the\ncenter of the world (cf. Sedley 2003) and a place where Philodemus\ncould have found many of the books he cited in his work.\n\n\nAnother set of difficulties concern Philodemus\u2019 connections\nwith Herculaneum. There is good cause to link Philodemus with Naples,\nand the \u2018humble shack\u2019 to which he invites Piso for the\ncommemoration of Epicurus\u2019 birthday (see Section 2.1)\nmay have been there or somewhere in the vicinity, perhaps including\nHerculaneum. Yet there is little or no ancient testimony associating\nhim with Herculaneum: what has been thought to be the single mention of the town in the papyri\nthemselves (PHerc. 312 col. 4 Gigante [T15 Sider]) is clear in associating Philodemus with Naples and with friendly philosophical discussion, but the toponym \u2018Herculaneum\u2019 is probably not to be read there, and in any event the text does not say that Philodemus lived there. Moreover, if Philodemus was likely dead by 30 BCE, about a\ncentury would pass between that event and the eruption that buried the\nvilla and its library: why would the books have remained there during\nthat period?\n\n\nBy far the largest number of the books\u2014probably all or nearly\nall the philosophical texts\u2014were stored on shelves in a small\nroom with no furniture for reading; some others were in one or two\nsmall cabinets in the tablinum, off the square peristyle,\nwhere books might be read; still others were in traveling boxes\n(capsae) in several areas of the villa, e.g., at the near end\nof the long peristyle. The philosophical library was perhaps one\nisolated, specialized collection, acquired by a collector who also\nacquired Philodemus\u2019 own library. It was perhaps left behind\nbecause unused and unwanted, while other books were removed from the\nvilla before the final catastrophe. The presence of copies of Philodemus\u2019 works made after his death indicates a continuing interest in his philosophy, however. Recent excavation and investigation\nare thought to show that the villa was built in one major construction effort,\nand decorative elements there date it to around 40 BCE (see Guidobaldi\nand Esposito 2010), in which case it could hardly have served as\nPhilodemus\u2019 home and workplace, and certainly not in 55 BCE, when\nCicero puts him in close association with Piso.\n2. Writings\n2.1 Poetry\n\n\nCicero says that Philodemus wrote very pleasant, elegant, clever\nverse to Piso and, at Piso\u2019s urging, about him, mirroring the man\nhimself in perfect verse descriptions of his lusts, immoral acts,\nbanquets and adulteries. We do not have poetry of Philodemus\u2019\nwhich would confirm the latter description, but Philodemus is the\nauthor of 30 or more elegant epigrams anthologized in the\n\u2018Garland\u2019 of Philip of Thessalonica in the first century\nCE, which was in turn included in the \u2018Palatine Anthology\u2019\n(AP) of the tenth century, ensuring the poems\u2019\nsurvival.\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 epigrams are a varied lot. Most are mostly erotic\npoems, some addressed to a certain \u2018Xanthippe\u2019, whose name\nappears in various forms, and who he says marks the end, as does the\ncoronis in a book, of the crazed or manic phase of his life\n(AP 11.41.7 = 4 Sider). The poems mention both Athens and\nNaples. A couple of them speak of banqueting or eating in moderation,\none of which invites Piso to the feast in honor of Epicurus\u2019\nbirthday, held on the twentieth of each month (AP 11.44 = 27\nSider):\n\n\nTomorrow, dearest Piso, your cultured companion drags you\nTo his humble shack at three o\u2019clock\nTo feed you your annual dinner on the Twentieth. If you\u2019ll miss\nSow\u2019s udders and Bromius\u2019 Chian wine,\nStill you\u2019ll see your faithful companions and hear\nThings far more sweet than the Phaeacians\u2019 land.\nAnd if you ever turn your gaze on us too, Piso,\nWe\u2019ll have a richer Twentieth, instead of a humble one.\n\n\n\nThis invitation to an Epicurean dinner raises the possibility that\nother epigrams of Philodemus might be viewed with an Epicurean eye, for\nexample, when they portray conversations in which friends point out to\nthe poet the need to avoid excessive grief at his own eventual death\n(AP 9.570 = 3 Sider) or the recent death of his friends\n(AP 9.412 = 29 Sider), though it is hard to think that all of\nthem could or should be so interpreted (cf. Sider 1997: 32\u201339).\n2.2 Philosophical Works\n2.2.1 Discovery of the papyri: an exceptional legacy\n\n\nGreek philosophical texts are usually known to us through the\nmedieval manuscript tradition, transmitted, in the best cases, by\nmanuscripts of the ninth or tenth centuries CE that were already, by\nthat date, the products of many generations of copies, and perhaps too\nof a couple of scholarly editions. Fragments of ancient papyrus\nmanuscripts give punctual insights into the state of some of these\ntexts in earlier periods, from the late third century BCE to the sixth\ncentury CE, and can thus be used to help gauge the accuracy of the\nlater manuscript tradition.\n\n\nBefore the mid-18th century, that Philodemus wrote\nproperly philosophical works could, beyond a reference to his\nCollection of the Philosophers (D[iogenes] L[aertius] 10.3,\ncf. 10.24, and see Section 2.2.5.5), only\nbe inferred from Cicero\u2019s reference to him as a \u2018very\nlearned\u2019 Epicurean, along with Siro (On Moral Ends\n2.119). But in 1752 and 1754 a large trove of perhaps about 800 papyrus\nbookrolls was excavated from an opulent villa in the town of\nHerculaneum on the Bay of Naples. The eruption of Vesuvius that buried\nthe town and the villa in October of 79 CE was also responsible for the\npreservation of these carbonized bookrolls, the first papyrus books to\nbecome known in Europe. The discovery sent a thrill through learned\nEurope, although the bookrolls\u2019 extreme fragility, which made\nthem practically impossible to unroll or separate into distinct layers\nwithout inflicting grave damage\u2014various early attempts resulted\nonly in the destruction of an unknown number of rolls\u2014was deeply\nfrustrating.\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 philosophical works are exceptional in being known\nto us entirely from papyri copied during his lifetime or, at the\nlatest, in the century after his death, which are, accordingly,\nexcellent qua records of what Philodemus actually wrote. Most\nscribal errors in them were corrected at an early stage, and despite\nthe usual obstacles to be encountered in texts on papyrus, (such as the\nabsence of word-breaks and of a standard, comprehensive system of\npunctuation, and the arrangement of text continuously, in columns,\nrather than by chapters or sections), the result is a clean and\nintelligible text\u2014where it can be read. Sadly, there is much that\ncannot be read (see Section 2.2.4).\n2.2.2 Unrolling the papyri\n\n\nThe 18th c. learned community was perhaps even more\ndismayed when, in 1754\u20135, the last part of one of these books was\nfinally unrolled, by Padre Antonio Piaggio, and proved to be a work of\nPhilodemus\u2019 attacking the art of music. Instead of the lost books\nof Livy or the plays of Aeschylus eagerly anticipated by scholars, the\nlibrary turned out to consist mostly of Epicurean treatises, Philodemus\nbeing the author best represented amongst them, followed by Epicurus\nhimself.\n\n\nThe first curator of all the objects excavated in Herculaneum, the\nRoman painter Camillo Paderni, had used the method of cutting\nlengthwise through the rolls of papyrus and peeling off their exterior\nportions (referred to as the \u2018bark\u2019 or scorza),\nsometimes pulverizing the rolls\u2019 central, interior portions (now referred to as \u2019scorzatura totale\u2019),\nsometimes leaving these untouched (\u2019scorzatura parziale\u2019). The exterior and interior portions\nof a bookroll were handled differently. The exterior portions took the\nform of a concave shell, representing all or part of the roll\u2019s\noriginal height, comprising numerous papyrus layers with writing\nvisible on the topmost of these (that nearest the middle of the roll\nand thus the end of the text). When this stretch of text had been\ncopied, the layer of papyrus on which it was written could be scraped\noff\u2014and thereby destroyed\u2014to reveal the next layer\nunderneath (which would thus be nearer to the beginning, not the end,\nof the text).\n\n\nThese surfaces or \u2018fragments\u2019 were necessarily\ndiscontinuous, each covering no more than half the circumference of a\nbookroll. Unmindful of how the fragments had come into being, the\nNeapolitan editors presented them in reverse order, with the later ones\nfirst. Moreover, since each piece of a roll had been assigned its own\n\u2018papyrus\u2019 number, the fact that a set of exterior\n\u2018fragments\u2019 and another set of interior columns had\noriginally formed one bookroll was often forgotten. The papyrus\nnumbered PHerc. 1427, for example, which ends with the title\nOn Rhetoric I, contains four partial columns and the final\nseven columns, out of an original 237; but other parts of the same\nbookroll were removed from its exterior, opened, catalogued, and\npublished, with little or no cognizance of their origin, as nine\nseparate \u201cpapyri\u201d (PHerc. 232, 234, 250, 398,\n426, 453, 1601, 1612, 1619), all of which when reassembled in\nNicolardi 2018 yield perhaps 30% of the original text.\n\n\nIt was the cores (midolli) of the bookrolls, containing the\nfinal parts of texts, that were opened using the ingenious mechanism\ninvented by Piaggio yielding long portions of mostly continuous text,\nalbeit interrupted by gaps of varying size. Such textual continuity is\nfound usually only in the final portions of Philodemus\u2019 books,\nsome of which contain something like a peroration, others attacks on\nrival positions, especially those of other Epicureans, or a kind of\nmopping-up and delimitation of the book\u2019s subject-matter. In a\nfew, fortunate, cases, such as PHerc. 1004 from On\nRhetoric, this final portion may cover a large percentage of the\noriginal roll\u2019s length; usually, however, they represent (much)\nless than a third. The unrolling process was so painfully slow that in\nthe first phase of the history of the \u2018Workshop\n(Officina) of the Papyri\u2019 (1754\u201398), only 18 papyri were\nsuccessfully unrolled. Political unrest closed the workshop between\n1798 and 1801, and in 1802 a new phase of unrolling began under the\ndirection of an English cleric, John Hayter, whose work was financed by\nthe Prince of Wales, the later George IV. During the next five years,\nover 200 rolls were unrolled, but little was published, due in part to\nthe slowness of the Neapolitan academics entrusted with the task.\n2.2.3 Early Publications and Modern Reading of the Papyri\n\n\nThese delays conspired with what many observers at the time\nconsidered the uninspiring nature of the works preserved in the papyri\nto dampen wider interest in and notice of them, despite their unique\nstatus. This state-of-affairs persisted until the unification of Italy\n(1861), when a new series of publications of facsimiles of the papyrus\ntexts, engravings of drawings (Italian: disegni) made soon\nafter the rolls were opened, appeared in quick succession (see the\nBibliographical Note, infra). Now the texts of Philodemus\nfinally became objects of sustained study by scholars interested in\nEpicureanism.\n\n\nNonetheless, numerous editions of Philodemus\u2019 works,\nespecially early ones, are unreliable. Many were not based on a reading\nof the papyri themselves, but rather on the disegni, which are\nfrequently wrong, and this led editors to be bolder about changing the\ntexts presented in these copies, filling in gaps, and interpreting the\nresults than they might have been had they read the papyri instead. In\nmany such cases, better reading of the papyrus has shown that the text\nran very differently indeed from the conjectures that have commonly\nserved as the basis of reconstructions of the views of Philodemus and\nothers. One common problem has been the mistaking of what turns out to\nbe a citation of an opponent for something Philodemus himself maintains\n(and vice versa).\n\n\nThere are other serious obstacles to understanding, especially the\ncondition of the papyri themselves. The books were written on sheets of\npapyrus pasted together into lengths of, say, 8\u201316 meters, which were\nrolled up from right to left and therefore read from left to right,\nbeginning to end. The texts are arranged in parallel columns, at times\nwell over 200 of them, of 20\u201345 lines, each consisting of 16\u201340\nletters; the numbers of lines and letters are fairly uniform in each\nroll.\n\n\nThere are holes (\u2018lacunae\u2019) of varying size; surfaces may\nhave been badly abraded in the process of unrolling; ink may have\nfaded, or even vanished altogether; glues used to hold the papyri\ntogether and mount them have in some cases penetrated and darkened\nthem. Significant advances in reading the papyri have been made,\nhowever, especially by the use of microscopes (first in 1970, then,\nfrom 1995, with built-in illumination) and, from 2000, of digital\nphotographs taken mostly in the near-infrared region\n(\u2018multi-spectral images\u2019). The problems of continuity\nposed by the way in which the papyri were opened and read have also\nrecently been addressed in a systematic way. Guglielmo Cavallo\u2019s study\n(1983) of the scribal hands used in the papyri allowed the texts to be\ngrouped and dated, and it allowed the recognition that numerous pieces\nhad once belonged to the same roll. These technical and philological\nadvances, which have dramatically improved and extended our access to\nPhilodemus\u2019 thought, now require the re-edition of all texts of\nHerculaneum papyri. There are also newer technical methods which may\nsoon change the situation again by providing three-dimensional images\nof opened papyri or even reading still rolled-up pieces without\nopening them.\n2.2.4 Reconstructing Philodemus\u2019 philosophical oeuvre\n2.2.4.1 Titles\n\n\nIn many texts we have lost the pages placed at the end of a roll, on\nwhich a scribe would write the work\u2019s author and title (and\nsometimes more information too, such as the number of columns or\nstandard lines the bookroll contained); nearly all the title-pages from\nthe beginnings of the rolls have been lost, as well. Many such orphaned\nrolls have been assigned to Philodemus indirectly, on the basis of the\nnature of the bookroll and of the hand in which it was copied, and of\nthe work\u2019s style and content. Scholars have also given titles to\nsome works based on their content and, in some cases, relying on\nreferences to such titles in other works of Philodemus\u2019. A\nrelated difficulty is posed by the possibility that titles may have\ntaken various forms, as in the papyri of On Vices, where the\ntitle-pages at the beginning of the rolls seem to have had a somewhat\nfuller title, those at the ends of the rolls a shorter version. The\npoint is relevant because Philodemus\u2019 philosophical production\ncan of course be rightly described and evaluated only on the basis of\nan accurate list of his writings. Most attributions of works to\nPhilodemus are generally accepted by scholars; conjectured titles,\nhowever, should often be understood as exempli gratia.\n2.2.4.2 Individual books\n\n\nDaniel Delattre\u2019s work (2007) on the pieces of papyrus now\nsecurely attributed to On Music IV, Dirk Obbink\u2019s on the\nfirst half of On Piety (1996), and Richard Janko\u2019s on\nOn Poems [I] showed how to \u2018reconstruct\u2019\nbookrolls, by identifying which items in the catalogue of papyri belong\nto a given roll, working out their original locations within it, and\nre-ordering the copies of their fragments.\n\n\nThe best reconstructions to date are thus able to give a clear\nimpression of the structure of a whole book, as with On Music\nIV, On Poems I, Rhetoric II, and VIII. In these books\nPhilodemus summarises the work\u2014often in the form of a number of\nrelatively short quotations\u2014of one or more opponents: in On\nMusic IV, the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon; in On Poems I,\nthe literary theorist Crates of Mallos, along with others referred to\nas \u2018critics\u2019 (kritikoi). Philodemus then goes back\nover the quotations in order, refuting each of their positions, often\nseveral times over.\n\n\nAn extreme example of this procedure occurs at the end of\nRhetoric VIII (cf. Blank 2007a). There the statement\nattributed to Aristotle as a reason for his decision to teach rhetoric,\n\u2018It is shameful to be silent while allowing Isocrates to\nspeak\u2019, is dissected and rejected over the course of ten columns\nwith arguments such as a reductio (why not say that it is\nshameful to sit idly while allowing Farmer Brown to till the soil?) or\nan ad hominem (the practice of political rhetoric is itself\nshameful, but then Aristotle and his pupil Theophrastus not only\ncollected the laws of various places, but also wrote about such low\nsubjects as perfumery and metallurgy).\n2.2.4.3 Multivolume works and projects\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 philosophical projects, and the sweep of his\nargumentation, are not, however, confined to the level of individual\nbooks. Besides self-contained, single-volume\n(\u2018monobibloi\u2019) works\u2014e.g. On\nthe Stoics, On the Good King according to Homer\u2014a\nlarge number of books belong to multi-volume projects. Thus we have\nonly the fourth\u2014probably final\u2014books of On Death\nand On Music; On Signs III; On the Gods I\nand III; Books I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, and perhaps also VII\nof On Rhetoric. In no case can we be sure that we have the\nentirety of any such project, though there are perhaps signs in some\nbookrolls that they were meant to be the last in a series, as at the\nend of On Music IV, while in other cases, the nature of the\ntreatment seems to bring the subject to a conclusion, as in On\nDeath IV.\n\n\nFor the most part it is unclear how all these works were organized.\nIn some cases (e.g., On Poems I-II and On Rhetoric\nI-III), Philodemus has plotted the course of more than one book at\nonce, but we do not know if an overall plan was present from the\nbeginning, or if books at first composed separately were later added to\nthe set. The most complex problems arise with regard to the\nmulti-volume work On Vices, which is discussed below.\nUnderstanding the organization of such works would give us a clearer\npicture of Philodemus\u2019 methods and philosophical aims.\n2.2.4.4 Ethical works\n\n\nA large percentage of Philodemus\u2019 known works deal with what\nmay be classed as ethical matters (see further, Section 2.2.5.3\nbelow). Most of the ethical works of Philodemus are practical\nin outlook, assuming rather than arguing for the tenets of Epicurean\nethical theory, on which they are always founded\n(Section 2.2.5.1).\n2.2.4.4.1 On ethics as a whole\n\n\nThere are two Herculaneum treatises which treat the systematic basis\nof ethics. One is a kind of introductory treatment of Epicurean ethics,\nfor which On Choices and Avoidances would be an appropriate\ntitle and which was probably written by Philodemus, who mentions such a\nwork of his own (at PHerc. 1424.28.5; formerly called\nEthica Comparetti after its first editor). The other is On\nEpicurus, a biographical, or rather hagiographical, work based\nlargely on citations of the founder\u2019s works (see further,\nSection 2.2.5.5).\n2.2.4.4.2 On individual ethical topics\n\n\nPhilodemus composed at least two multi-volume works on explicitly\nmoral subjects. One was On Vices, or, as the titles of some of\nits books indicate, On Vices and their Opposing Virtues and Those\nin whom and Concerning what things they occur. Individual books of\nthis set seem to have borne individual titles, two of which are known:\nOn Flattery (On Vices Book 1: PHerc.\n222+223+1082+1675 and perhaps a couple of other fragmentary pieces;\nPHerc. 1457, dealing with vices similar to flattery, may have\nbeen either a second book or the conclusion of the same book, carried\nover onto a second roll, giving the treatise a structure like that of\nBook 10) and On Arrogance (On Vices Book 10:\nPHerc. 1008); two other books whose title indicated that they\nbelonged to the set, but whose individual titles are lost, dealt with\nhousehold management (On Vices Book 9: PHerc. 1424)\nand greed (PHerc. 253). These four books are all written in\nthe same hand, and another by the same scribe, dealing with slander\n(PHerc. Paris. 2), is also likely to have been part of the\noverall work On Vices. Besides having been written by the same\nscribe, evidently as part of a fairly uniform edition, at least three\nof these books were addressed to the circle of Roman poets Plotius\nTucca, Varius, Virgil and Quintilius Varus (PHerc. 253 fr.\n12.4; On Flattery, PHerc. 1082.11.3; On\nSlander, PHerc. Paris. 2 fr. 279.10\u201311).\n\n\nThat Philodemus composed these books as part of a coherent series is\nclear not only from the presence of both individual descriptive titles\nand generic titles in the rolls of this edition, but also from the end\nof On Arrogance: \u2018We shall end this treatise here, but\nwe shall add to it the treatment of the other vices which we think we\nshould discuss\u2019. Still, in the course of these books, Philodemus\nalso refers to others, which may or may not have been part of the\nseries: On Beauty and On Eros, which contained\nremarks intended to prevent people from falling prey to flattery (cited\nat PHerc. 1457 fr. 23.8\u201310); On Wealth (mentioned at\nPHerc. 1424.12.17\u201325; we have the first book in\nPHerc. 163 and perhaps another book in PHerc. 209);\nOn Wealth and Poverty (perhaps contained in PHerc.\n1570; or perhaps this is another name for On Wealth), On\nthe Extravagant and Simple Lifestyles, and On Choices and\nAvoidances (cited in PHerc. 1424.28.5).\n\n\nIt is unclear exactly how this series as a whole justified the\ndescriptive title On Vices and their Opposing Virtues and Those in whom and Concerning what\nthings they occur. Not all its books are clearly centered on or\ntitled after \u2018vices\u2019. Nor does the work appear to have\ncontained any books which were clearly written about\n\u2018virtues\u2019 opposite to the \u2018vices\u2019, such as a\nbook on friendship as an opposite to flattery; it has been speculated\nthat such might have been the relationship between the book about\nhousehold management and one which is perhaps about greed\n(philarguria) and which survives in a number of fragmentary\npieces written in the hand of On Vices (PHerc. 253,\n465, 896, 1090, 1613 and frs. 8\u201310 and 12 of 1077). Individual books,\nhowever, may correspond in some way to the overall title. Thus, On\nFlattery and On Arrogance analyze the vices of their\nsubtitles, contrast them with the attitude and practice of the\nEpicurean philosopher (i.e., the virtues) and describe the\n\u2018character\u2019 type afflicted with the vice in question, as\nwell as those characters which are of the same genus or in some way\nbound up with the main vice, with due attention to the particular\nnature and danger of each character and the situations in which it is\nfound.\n\n\nKey to understanding the ethics of managing an Epicurean community\nis Philodemus\u2019 treatise (PHerc. 1471) dedicated to the\nschool\u2019s practice of frank criticism (parrh\u00easia).\nIts full title runs Of the books On Characters and Modes of Life\nwritten as epitomes from the lectures of Zeno, Book [ ?], which is On\nFrank Criticism, and testifies to the existence of a second series\nof Philodemus\u2019 ethical works.\n\n\nAnother book with clear relevance to the conduct of the school and\nthe understanding of the sage\u2019s role in it is On Anger\n(PHerc. 182). As reconstructed, the remains of this\nbook\u2019s final title page allow the possibility that it was part of\na larger work, and its subject, along with those of books On\nMadness and others which could be called [On Malicious\nJoy (or On Jealousy)], or [On Dismeasure], has\nled some to propose that Philodemus wrote a series of books on the\npassions. Certainly, the passions (path\u00ea) are close to\nthe heart of Hellenistic ethical discussion and play an important role\nin one\u2019s ability both to lead a good, happy life and one\u2019s\nability to profit from being in a community of philosophers.\n2.2.5 Philodemus\u2019 philosophy\n2.2.5.1 Philodemus\u2019 conception of philosophical discourse\n2.2.5.1.1 The \u2018great men\u2019\n\n\nPhilodemus does not claim to be an original philosopher. He insists\nthat his views are based on the doctrines of Epicurus and of his first\ngeneration of pupils\u2014Metrodorus, Colotes, Polyaenus, Hermarchus\n(cf. PHerc. 1005 III 8\u201317 and fr. 107.9 ff.), whose\nworks he cites constantly as proof of the correctness of his claims\nabout Epicurean doctrine and its proper interpretation, often in\nopposition to the interpretations of other Epicureans contemporary\nwith or somewhat older than himself. The death of Hermarchus marks,\nfor Philodemus, the end of the authoritative generation of\nEpicureans. To Hermarchus were bequeathed the books of\nEpicurus\u2014perhaps some of the very copies eventually owned by\nPhilodemus and found in the Villa\u2014and he was the last of the\ndisciples to have participated in philosophical discussion with and,\nthus, in the formation of the philosophy of the founder.\n2.2.5.1.2 Zeno of Sidon\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 authority for many of his claims about the content and\ninterpretation of Epicurean teaching is his own teacher, Zeno of\nSidon. In Rhetoric II, for example, Philodemus defends Zeno\u2019s\nview that the first Epicureans denied forensic and political rhetoric\nthe status of \u2018arts\u2019 or \u2018expertises\u2019\n(technai), while conceding it to \u2018sophistic\u2019 or\npanegyric rhetoric (cf. Blank 2001).  Elsewhere, Philodemus gives an\nextended defence of Zeno\u2019s running of the school, his conception of\nthe Epicurean wise man, his attitude toward and use of the founders\u2019\ntexts, and his balanced understanding of Epicurus\u2019 hostility toward\nthe liberal arts, in opposition to some recent Epicureans, who are\ncriticized for their \u2018laziness regarding books\u2019 and who,\nZeno said, had only a superficial knowledge of the principal texts,\nbased on epitomes. The title of the book (PHerc. 1005/862 and\n1485) in which this argument is conducted, and which was apparently\nthe first of a set, is only partially preserved, as Pros tous\n[\u2026], which, to compound the difficulty, could mean either\nthat it is addressed \u2018to\u2019 certain persons whose identity\nis now lost, or that it is written \u2018against\u2019 them. It has\nbeen published under the titles Against the [sophists]\nand To the [companions in the school\n(hetairous)] (thus, ad contubernales in\nLatin, and is now read as, for instance, Against those [no good at\nknowing the books] (Puglia 2015) or Against those [who claim\nto know the books] (Del Mastro 2014).\n\n\nSome of Philodemus\u2019 books are described as based in whole or\npart on the lectures of Zeno (e.g. On Signs III, On Frank\nCriticism); the term hupomn\u00eamatikon, which appears\nin some end-titles, may indicate that, being similarly dependent on\nlectures or seminars, they are in the style of a \u2018notebook\u2019\nor \u2018commentary\u2019 (hypomn\u00eamatikon, cf. Blank\n1997). Zeno\u2019s collection and interpretation of the\nfounders\u2019 texts is praised and defended by Philodemus in a number\nof places, and he was clearly devoted to him, describing himself as\n\u2018Zeno\u2019s faithful suitor while he lived, and tireless singer\nof his praises after his death, especially for all his virtues, in\naddition to his possession (ka[to]chais) and inspiration\n(theophoriais) by Epicurus\u2019 (Pros tous\n[\u2026] XIV 6\u201313). Zeno seems, in fact, to have been for\nPhilodemus a model second only to Epicurus himself of the wise man and\nleader of an Epicurean community. It is to the running of an Epicurean\ncommunity, the role of the sage in it and the relations between its\nmembers that much of Philodemus\u2019 work is devoted.\n\n\nWe do not know any of the other books from the same series of\nsummaries based on the lectures of Zeno, who was evidently the source\nand model of Philodemus\u2019s ideas about how to run an Epicurean\nschool. They are often thought to have included On\nConversation (PHerc. 873, apparently Book 2, according to\nthe final title), and On Gratitude (PHerc. 1414)\nbecause those topics also relate to conduct and relations among school\nmembers; the titles of these two bookrolls, however, evidently lacked\nany indication that they belonged to a larger work; the final title of\nPHerc. 873 is in the same hand as the front and back titles\nadded to the uniform edition of the books of On Vices which\nmay indicate that the book belonged rather to that series.\n2.2.5.2 Canonics\n\n\nEpicurus was perhaps the originator of the Hellenistic debates over\nthe nature and existence of a \u2018criterion of truth\u2019, which\nallows us to separate true from doubtful or false beliefs. This debate,\nconducted by both philosophers and medical writers, also concerned\nmethods of proof and sign-inference to extend knowledge beyond our\nimmediate perceptions (overview in Allen 2001).\n\n\nThe final portion of On Signs III is all we have of the\nwork, the full title of which was apparently On Phenomena and\nSign-inferences (s\u00eamei\u00f4se\u00f4n). It\ncomprises four sections (labeled here \u00a7\u00a71\u20134, followed by\ncolumn and line numbers from DeLacy and DeLacy 1978) and reports the\nways in which three Epicureans responded to criticisms of their theory\nof sign-inference. First is Philodemus\u2019 teacher, Zeno (\u00a71,\n\u00a72); then Demetrius Laco (\u00a73, xxviii 13\u2013xxix 19), whose\ninterest in proof is known from Sextus (M 8.348); and finally\nanother, unnamed, colleague (\u00a74, xxix 20\u2013xxxviii 22). The authors\nof the initial criticisms are unknown, but probably include the\nDionysius who is named as author of replies to the Epicurean rebuttals\nof the first round of criticisms (\u00a71, vii 5\u2013viii 21; Zeno\u2019s\nreplies occupy viii 21\u2013ix 26), and he may be a Stoic or Peripatetic. On the other\nhand, the method favored by the opponents, EM or the elimination mode\n(anaskeu\u00ea, which is not the same as contraposition, as\nscholars used to think), is not positively attested as Stoic.\n\n\nBoth the EM and the Epicurean similarity mode (SM) of sign-inference\nmove to the non-evident from the evident. We do not know how the\nopponents defined what is evident, but the SM starts from empirical\ngeneralisations that have been, in their turn, built up from individual\nobservations, and, ultimately, from perceptions and feelings, these\nbeing two of the standard Epicurean criteria. The experiences of others\n(if reliable), accessed through research (historia), as well\nas things proved earlier, may also furnish suitable starting-points for\nthe construction (sunthesis) of inferential transitions\n(metabaseis) to the non-evident. All this empirical input is\nmost often referred to as \u2018things hereabouts\u2019 (ta\npar\u2019 h\u00eamin), and it stands in opposition both to\nperceptible things outside our experience, e.g., from living things\nhere to those in chilly \u2018Britain, if any\u2019 (\u00a71, v\n35\u20136), and also to those that are in principle imperceptible, as from\nmoving things hereabouts to atoms moving in the void.\n\n\nEpicurus himself had appealed to what is evident to provide positive\n\u2018attestation\u2019 (epimartur\u00easis) of true\nbeliefs about perceptibles \u2018hereabouts\u2019, and\n\u2018contestation\u2019 (antimartur\u00easis) of false\nbeliefs about theoretical items such as atoms, and about extremely\ndistant perceptible objects; always provided it is explanatorily\nadequate, lack of evidence of any kind against a theoretical belief is\nsufficient grounds for taking it to be true, (Ep. Herodot. 80,\nEp. Pythocles 86\u201388; each such belief will constitute a true\nexplanation of this type of phenomenon in one or other of the infinite\nnumber of world-systems in the universe). In On Signs, in\ncontrast, what phenomena \u2018conflict\u2019 (antipiptein,\nmakhesthai) with, if they do, are empirical generalizations,\nwhich are thereby falsified (e.g., \u00a71, xvii 28\u2013xviii 16). Thus\nwhile Epicurus argues that the non-existence of void is contested by\nthe phenomenon of movement, these Epicureans argue that nothing evident\ncontests the local generalization that moving things hereabouts all\nmove through empty spaces.\n\n\nSuch localized empirical generalizations are produced by the\nEpicureans\u2019 method of \u2018applied reasoning\u2019\n(epilogismos), i.e., reasoning applied to experience:\nsimilarities (homoiot\u00eates) and differences among things\nin our experience are collected and scrutinized so as to identify\nproperties belonging to all, or all observed, local members of some\nkind or group without exception. These properties can then safely be\nprojected, by sign-inference, to all or any other members of the kind,\nas, for example, it is inferred that mortality belongs to all human\nbeings everywhere (e.g., \u00a74, xxxiii 24\u201332)\u2014a type of\nsign-inference that the Epicureans claim is simply not captured by the\nEM (e.g., \u00a71, xvii 8\u201311). While local generalizations are all\nconstructed by the detection of similarities, in the case of\nimperceptibles property-projection will rather be by analogy (\u00a74,\nxxxvii 24\u2013xxxviii 8, the DeLacys\u2019 unfortunate translation of\nhomoiot\u00eas as \u2018analogy\u2019 notwithstanding):\natoms, e.g., are analogous, but not identical, to macroscopic bodies in\ntheir property of solidity.\n\nEpilogismos must be conducted with due diligence and\ncaution (e.g., \u00a73, xxix 1\u20134), but this seems an inadequate defense\nagainst the possibility raised by their opponents that counter-examples\nto generalizations\u2014unique individuals or rare species\u2014may\nalways exist undiscovered. More convincing is the response that, since\nfreaks and rarities were discovered empirically, to project the\nexistence of such things into unknown realms is simply to apply the SM\n(e.g., \u00a73, xxviii 29\u201337). While this does not prove that the EM is\nsuperfluous, it does raise another unsettled question, whether all\nthese Epicureans believe that there is only one mode of sign-inference,\nthe SM, or two (as suggested by Zeno in \u00a71, e.g., xii 2\u201331). It is\nprobably helpful to see this problem in light of a basic disagreement\nthat emerges in On Signs between the Epicureans and their\nopponents: that the Epicureans are mainly concerned, not with arriving,\nsomehow or other, at true beliefs, but with how we can be certain that\nour beliefs are true, experience being the only secure foundation for\nany property-projection. Sign-inferences here and in other sources\noften take the form of a conditional (sun\u00eammenon), such\nas: \u2018If there is smoke, there is fire\u2019, or a\npara-conditional (parasun\u00eammenon), such as \u2018Since\nthere is smoke, there is fire\u2019 (equivalent to a conditional plus\nits antecedent), and the EM is built around a criterion of truth for\nconditionals: the antecedent must be \u2018eliminated\u2019, or\nnegated, simply by the \u2018elimination\u2019 of the consequent\n(\u00a71, xii 1\u201314). In the void/movement case, then, if movement is a\nsign of void, elimination of void thereby eliminates movement, and the\ninference seems to be valid by the EM.\n\n\nBut the author of \u00a74, at any rate, insists that it is only\nbecause we have observed that moving things hereabouts, despite other\ndifferences, all share the property of moving through empty spaces,\nthat we affirm that the same thing holds without exception in\nnon-evident places too (xxxv 36\u2013xxxvi 7). The full form of this\nsign-inference would therefore run: \u201cSince moving things\nhereabouts all move through empty space, all moving things move through\nempty spaces; and since all moving things move through empty space, and\nthere are moving things, there is such a thing as empty space\u201d.\nBut if assurance (diabebai\u00f4sis) that the conclusion is\ntrue is produced in all cases by experience of similar cases\n(xxxvii 31\u201335), whether a sign is similar to what it signifies\u2014as\nwith the revelation that all human beings are mortal by their being so\nhereabouts\u2014or it is not, as with movement\u2019s being a sign of\nvoid (xxxi 1\u20137), then there will indeed be only one mode of\nsign-inference, and the EM, which does not proceed in this way, will be\nexcluded.\n\n\nA second major disagreement is that the Epicureans apparently\nclaimed that SM sign-inferences had a \u2018necessitating\u2019\n(anankastikos) character, which their opponents denied (e.g.,\n\u00a71, iv 5\u201337; \u00a72, xxvi 25\u20136). There has been modern debate\nover whether the Epicureans meant that the premisses of SM\nsign-inferences necessitate their conclusions, as in deductive\narguments (Barnes 1988: 107\u2013111), or that SM sign-inferences are\n\u2018cogent\u2019 and \u2018demand assent\u2019 and may be thought\nof as inductive arguments, which antiquity called\nepag\u00f4g\u00ea and in which the premisses do not\nnecessitate the conclusions (Long 1988: 136\u201340).\n\n\nPerhaps, however, the important point is rather that SM\nsign-inference is concerned with the relation between an individual\nobject and its properties, a relation of metaphysical\nnecessity (e.g., \u00a71, viii 32\u20136; \u00a74, xxxiii 35, xxxv 22\u20139). It\nis these necessary properties that epilogismos seeks to\nidentify (e.g., \u00a71, xvii 3\u201311; \u00a74, xxxv 4\u201331) and that\nsign-inference should project: they help constitute the nature of a\nthing (cf. \u00a71, xv 11\u201312; \u00a73, xxiv 6\u20138). When he rebuts the\nopponents\u2019 objection that SM sign-inferences are not\nnecessitating, therefore, Zeno adduces the kind of property from which\na sign-inference should proceed. Thus whatever necessity an SM\nsign-inference has comes from the metaphysical necessity of a\nproperty-property pairing, which is expressed in a qua truth:\n\u201cFor when we say that, since those hereabouts are such, those in\nthe unknown realm are also such, insofar as those hereabouts are such,\nin this way we believe that something unknown is conjoined with them.\nFor example: since humans hereabouts, qua humans, are mortal,\nthen if there are humans anywhere, they too are mortal\u201d (\u00a74,\nxxxiii 24\u201332). Each of the four senses of \u2018qua\u2019\ndiscussed in the next lines joins properties with the force of\nnecessity and is used in sign-inferences (xxxiii 24\u201329).\n\n\nThe Epicureans are epistemological realists who postulate that we\nnaturally form conceptions corresponding to types of object and\nproperty in our experience. The metaphysical necessity of\nproperty-property pairing explains why the best test of a conditional\nor of a particular sign is that it is inconceivable that the antecedent\nexists and the consequent does not (\u00a74, xxxiii 1\u20137), why someone\nmaking a sign-inference on the basis of the evident \u201clocks away\nin inconceivability\u201d the proposition that things hereabouts are\nsuch, but things elsewhere are not such (\u00a71, xv 37\u201339).\n\n\nAs with On Signs, what remains of a badly damaged treatise\non the senses attributed to Philodemus (PHerc. 19/698, ed.\nMonet 1996) takes the Epicurean theory of perception, with its\ndescription of the atomic basis of the senses and their irrationality,\nas a background against which to discuss developments of the theory due\nto the confrontation with opponents, in this instance Stoics and\nAristotelians. Of special concern are: the unity of sensation (I-VIII)\nand the \u2018common sense\u2019 (XX-XXVII) as opposed to the\nparticular objects of each sense (XXVIII-XXIX); and the rejection of\nStoic \u2018grasping\u2019 (katal\u00eapsis) once one\nadmits the Epicurean theory of \u2018affection\u2019\n(pathos), which includes both perceiving and perceiving that\none is perceiving (IX-XVII).\n2.2.5.3 Ethics\n2.2.5.3.1 The principles\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 ethical theory is very much that of Epicurus, with\nits focus on the attainment of \u2018the congenital goal\u2019 of\npleasure and concomitant rejection of what does not lead to that goal\nor even distracts from it. Probably, the systematic treatment of\nEpicurean ethics put in the mouth of \u2018Torquatus\u2019 by Cicero\nin On Moral Ends 1.29\u201372 reflects a position with which\nPhilodemus would have agreed and its source was perhaps Philodemus\nhimself or, more likely, Zeno (Tsouna 2001). It is the rational\ncalculation of pleasure which guides our correct moral choices, and the\ncalculus is stressed in both Torquatus\u2019 account (1.32\u201333) and\n[On Choices and Avoidances] (IV 10\u2013VI 21, etc., Indelli-Tsouna\n1995; see Tsouna 2007: 13\u201331 for a fine overview of Philodemus\u2019\nethical position).\n\n\nWe make moral errors, therefore, by failing to calculate pleasures\nand pains correctly in making moral choices, which happens when we do\nnot keep in mind \u2018the most important things\u2019 (ta\nkuri\u00f4tata) or rules of Epicureanism. Philodemus thinks it\nimportant not only to understand, but also to memorize the cardinal\ntenets, which help us to measure our choices and avoidances by the\nnaturally given ends, not merely\u2014as some Epicureans\nheld\u2014because knowing the cardinal tenets lends tranquillity of\nmind ([On Choices and Avoidances] XI 7\u201320). He also argues, in\nPros tous [\u2026], that easily memorized, abbreviated\nformulations of the cardinal maxims are useful, and he gives us (IV\n9\u201314) the pithiest formulation of Epicurean tenets, the \u2018Fourfold\nDrug\u2019 (tetrapharmakos logos): \u2018god is not\nfearsome, death not frightening, the good easily got, the bad easily\nendured\u2019. The reader is advised constantly to bear in mind these\nfour tenets, which are grounded by Philodemus in various places,\nincluding in [On Choices and Avoidances], where they are\ncalled simply \u2018The Four\u2019.\n\n\nUnderstanding the cardinal tenets of Epicureanism and keeping them\nin memory will help us deliberate, but deliberation may still be\ninhibited by our desires, which must therefore be well understood by\nus, together with their causes. Desires may arise in us and may affect\nus in different ways, depending on our physical and mental constitution\nand on our situation in life. In many cases, we fail to take into\naccount the sources of our desires when we make moral choices, not\nrecognizing, for example, that the desire for great wealth or\nreputation is \u2018empty\u2019 or vain ([On Choices and\nAvoidances] V-VI). We may also fail to perform the hedonic\ncalculus correctly due to a false assignment of value to goods,\nconsidering reputation or wealth, for example, great goods which cause\nus pain when we are denied them. Such failures will occur especially\nwhen we suffer from vices of character and when we are in the grip of\nthe passions, and Philodemus gives profound treatments of both these\nsubjects.\n2.2.5.3.2 Types of character\n\n\nThe treatment of character-types (as in some of the books of On\nVices) is in part a continuation of Peripatetic treatises (such\ndescriptions are included, for example, in Aristotle\u2019s\nEthics and Rhetoric, the Aristotelian books on\nVirtues and Vices and Physiognomics), and\nTheophrastus\u2019 chapter on the obsequious man (Characters\n5) is quoted in extenso in On Flattery, while a\nletter On the Relief of Arrogance by Aristo (very probably the\nthird century Peripatetic scholarch from Ceos, despite renewed\narguments that he was rather Aristo of Chius, the Stoic) is summarized\nin the final fourteen columns of On Arrogance. It appears that\nPhilodemus may have been preceded in his use of character sketches by\nanother Epicurean, perhaps a contemporary of Philodemus, Nicasicrates\nof Rhodes, with whom he takes issue in various places.\n\n\nThere is little doubt that the vices treated by Philodemus were very\nwidespread in the late Roman Republic, and it is likely that his work\nwas in part meant to instruct those who had to live in that society\nabout the alternative provided by Epicureanism. Perhaps Philodemus also\nintended to provide the poetically minded friends to whom the work was\naddressed with instruction on how to manage their own relations with\nothers, including their patrons and members of their philosophically\noriented discussion groups, and with raw material, in the form of\ncharacter descriptions and analyses, for their poetry. Sider 1997: 21\nnotes that Horace, who was an associate of the four addressees of\nOn Vices, says (Ars Poetica 438\u2013452) that, if one\nread him one\u2019s verses, Quintilius (one of the four) would not\nflatter, but offer honest criticism as a true friend would do, acting\nlike Aristarchus and not saying: \u2018Why should I offend my friend\nover trifles?\u2019. Such a connection between criticism and\nfriendship is not a standard topic of Hellenistic literary criticism,\nbut it is central to Philodemus\u2019 ethical works, where it appears\nas the art of frank criticism.\n\n\nMost of all, the subjects treated in these books serve the needs of\na philosophical community and its leader, who must deal with characters\nsuch as the various kinds of flatterers or lovers of flattery or the\nmanifold arrogant types among its members, hangers-on and their\nfamilies, preventing them from harming the cohesion and mission of the\ncommunity, while warding off misunderstandings of the sage as arrogant\nor sycophantic himself. Philosophy provides the cure for the vices, but\nthis cure is effected in the context of the Epicurean community, with\nits physician/sage leader and the practice of frank criticism among all\nits members.\n2.2.5.3.3 Discourse within the school\n\nOn Frank Criticism is a kind of manual of frankness, which\nit treats as a technical expertise of how to criticize other members of\nthe Epicurean community. The expert practitioner of this art is the\nEpicurean sage, the community\u2019s leader, who must look at the\nerrors in the behavior of his companions, including other sages and\neven himself, diagnose the moral errors and circumstances which led to\nthat behavior, and know what therapy to apply. The poor, the rich, the\nold, and women, among others, are all prone to particular\nmisconceptions and behaviors which hinder their progress in philosophy\nand toward the happy life; they are also liable to react in particular\nways to therapy. Therefore the sage must know when to criticize mildly\nor harshly or even give the impression of being angry. In addition, the\nother members of the community must learn to criticize themselves and\none another, bringing complaints to one another and to the sage.\n\nOn Conversation deals with technical precepts about silence\nand speaking, recognizing the power of silence, the importance of\ncontemplation, and the art of knowing when and to whom one should speak\nor keep silent. What little we have of On Gratitude deals with\nthe gratitude which is properly given to one\u2019s teacher and the\nrelation between gratitude and friendship. This theme ties in with the\nshare of money one receives in gratitude from one\u2019s philosophical\ncompanions in exchange for philosophical discourses, which Philodemus\nin the treatise on household management from On Vices says is\nthe best source of income for a philosopher (PHerc.\n1424.23.23; for the treatise on household management, see now Tsouna 2012).\n2.2.5.3.4 On Anger and On Death IV\n\n\nEpicurus stresses that anger is not compatible with the blessed life\nof the gods (Ep. Herodot. 77), who are neither won over by our\ndeserving deeds nor infected by anger (Lucretius 2.646\u201351); the latter\nis one of the false opinions which harm our happiness by corrupting our\nrelation to the gods (Lucretius 6.68\u201379). Seneca cites Epicurus as\nsaying that \u201cimmoderate anger gives rise to madness\u201d\n(Ep. Mor. 18.12=fr. 484 Usener), and he explains, from his own\nStoic point of view, that it is not the gravity of the cause, but\nrather the kind of soul it affects, that determines whether sparks grow\ninto the flame of anger; Philodemus would agree, at least as regards\nuncontrollable rage.\n\n\nPhilodemus conceives of the passions as both affective, involving\nthe condition of both body and soul, and cognitive, requiring judgments\nsuch as, in the case of anger, that someone has harmed one\nintentionally and severely and that one is justified in one\u2019s\ndesire for revenge at that harm. Epicurus qualified the anger that\nbrings on madness as \u2018immoderate\u2019, leaving open the\npossibility that there might be a \u2018moderate\u2019 anger which is\nless harmful. Though he agrees with Epicurus that the gods, who should\nbe our ethical role models, are untouched by anger (Piet. 1147\nff. Obbink), it is, according to Philodemus, natural for us human\nbeings to feel anger and desire revenge at certain harms or slights.\nHowever, it is harmful to us to feel an unnatural anger, one which is\nincommensurate with the harm we actually suffered at someone\u2019s\nhands.\n\n\nThis distinction between the natural \u2018bite\u2019 or pang of\nanger and the destructive fury of unnatural anger is central to\nPhilodemus\u2019 understanding of anger. Some of us have a disposition\n(diathesis) that is \u2018irascible\u2019 and are prone to\nfeel anger where others might not be so roused. Such a disposition is\nthe result of false opinions regarding the importance of being injured\nor slighted, the effect these should have on our well-being, and the\ndesirability or even pleasurability of taking revenge.\n\u2018Empty\u2019 (ken\u00ea) anger, Philodemus says, is an\nevil: it arises from a wholly bad disposition and it has bad\nconsequences; on the other hand, \u2018natural\u2019 anger is not an\nevil: it may indeed \u2018bite\u2019, but its bite is very brief\n(37.46\u201338.11, ed. Indelli 1988). Whether or not it was original with\nhim, Philodemus\u2019 distinction between \u2018natural\u2019 and\n\u2018empty\u2019 anger is evidently based on Epicurus\u2019 basic\ndistinction of \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019 desires,\nthe latter depending on empty beliefs (KD 29, 30). Natural\nanger affects one who reasons correctly, based on correct beliefs about\ngoods, evils, and the natural goal; empty anger affects those who, due\nto their false opinions on these matters, have an irascible disposition\nand feel slights against them more vehemently and lastingly, desiring\nwhat they believe will be a sweet revenge.\n\n\nThe philosopher is a physician of the soul, and Philodemus insists\nthat it is not impossible to escape the diseases of the soul, if we can\navoid \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018empty\u2019 belief about the type\nand magnitude of evils (6.8 ff.). Where the preserved portion of the\ntreatise picks up (1.6 ff.), Philodemus is arguing against Timasagoras,\napparently an Epicurean who disagreed with Philodemus and Zeno on\nvarious ethical questions. Timasagoras apparently argued that anger was\nalways and entirely bad, and that it forced itself on its victims as a\nkind of necessity which one was powerless to fight or to treat in\nothers. He seems to have insisted that only rational argument could be\nused, in an effort to alter false opinions before anger strikes,\ndiscounting the usefulness of speeches harshly denouncing anger: the\nevils of anger are so evident to all that it is\n\u2018nonsensical\u2019 to think that criticizing it does any good\n(1.9\u201327). Further, Timasagoras thought that those in the throes of\nanger are incapable of reasoning on the basis of observed facts about\ntheir passions (anepilogistous 7.8\u20139).\n\n\nPhilodemus, for his part, agrees with Bion the Cynic and Chrysippus,\nwho relied on denunciations of anger, while criticizing them as\nneglecting to do much more than this to treat it. Although physicians\ntell their patients the truth about the gravity of their illness and\nits consequences, the patients often do not fully grasp these\nstrictures and their danger\u2014sometimes entirely, sometimes by\nfaulty reasoning\u2014and thus neglect to avoid them, thinking them\nnot very serious. But when these evils are \u2018placed before their\neyes\u2019, patients are rendered ready to seek treatment (4.4 ff.; on\nPhilodemus\u2019 methods of treatment, see Tsouna 2009). Indeed, this\nsection of the text is followed by a lengthy catalogue (8.20\u201331.24),\nperhaps borrowing from Bion\u2019s On Anger and\nChrysippus\u2019 Therapeutic On Passions, of the evils caused\nby anger for those who experience it, those on whom the lash of\nanger\u2019s revenge falls, and others, family, friends, and\nsociety.\n\n\nOne place where anger has negative consequences is in Epicurean\ncommunities, where it can obstruct students\u2019 progress in\nphilosophy and interfere with the practice of frank criticism which is\ncentral to the interactions between members. If students are irascible,\nthey will not tolerate the kind of frank criticism meted out to them by\ntheir companions and teachers (cf. 36.24\u20135): they will take it as a\nslight and go into a rage. In fact, the teacher\u2019s use of harsh\nreproof when he judges that the student\u2019s resistance requires\nsuch an approach, may even give the mistaken impression that the\nteacher himself is irascible and that the anger he expresses is\nimmoderate and harmful. The last part of Philodemus\u2019 treatise\n(34.16 ff.) deals precisely with the question of whether the sage,\nwhose life is meant to emulate that of the blessed gods, is subject to\nanger. While his critique of anger and its consequences has generally\nassumed that these are bad, Philodemus here concentrates on the\ndistinction between natural and empty anger. Natural anger is\nunavoidable and not harmful; it may even be helpful in certain\nsituations (37.20 ff.). Philodemus argues against Nicasicrates (37.5)\nand other Epicureans that the sage is subject only to natural, and\nnever to empty anger. This is a consequence of the sage\u2019s correct\nunderstanding of what is to be chosen or avoided and his ability to\nreason correctly about the passions and their consequences.\n\n\nPhilodemus here distinguishes the two kinds of anger by different\nterms, \u2018anger\u2019 (org\u00ea) for the mild and\nnatural kind, \u2018rage\u2019 (thumos) for the unnatural\nand destructive kind. While it appears that his opponents pointed to\npassages where the first generation of Epicureans spoke of the sage as\nsubject to thumos, Philodemus says that there are two\ndifferent naturally-acquired, and therefore criterial, preconceptions\n(or \u2018anticipations\u2019, prol\u00eapseis), one more\ngeneral and one more precise (45.2). Thus, when Epicurus or Metrodorus\nspoke of the thumos of the sage, they used the term according\nto the broader conception and should be interpreted as saying that the\nsage was subject to natural anger or org\u00ea. Very\ndifficult and controversial is the interpretation of the reasonings\napplied to experience (epilogismoi, see Section 2.2.5.2) used\nby his Epicurean opponents to show that the sage will\nfeel thumos and their rebuttal by Philodemus (cf. Delattre\n2009).\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 approach to anger is especially close to his\ntreatment of the fear of death in On Death IV (PHerc.\n1050, ed. Henry 2009). As the text becomes legible for us, Philodemus\nis apparently arguing traditional Epicurean points to show why death is\nnot to be feared, including: we do not have reason to fear being dead\nnor will we lack good things while we are dead, as we lack all\nsensation, and all good and bad is found in sensation (1\u20132); we ought\nnot to worry, as does the Stoic Apollophanes, that the sundering of the\nunion of body and soul will necessarily be excruciating for us, since\nthe myriad pores in our skins provide an easy exit for the fine atoms\nof the soul (7); and an early death is not bad, even if one has\nachieved perfect happiness in life, as did Epicurus\u2019 student\nPythocles, since such a life is perfect at every point and would not be\nimproved by its extension (12\u201317).\n\n\nFrom this point on, however, Philodemus\u2019 treatise takes a more\ndistinctive tack. As in On Anger, here too he is at pains to\nrecognize that we feel a \u2018natural bite\u2019 or pang in certain\ncircumstances. In this section of the book, Philodemus goes through a\nnumber of things often alleged as causes of the reluctance or fear to\ndie. He begins with the idea that it is natural for one who was making\nprogress in philosophy to feel a stab of pain that he should die\nbefore he could reach perfect happiness (17.32 ff.). Yet such a person\nalso enjoys certain consolations, such as the knowledge that his\nexample may convince others to make progress in philosophy; surely, he\nwill also feel joy in the goods philosophy has given him already. A\nsage who has achieved perfect happiness will lose nothing by having it\ncut short, while a fool would not gain anything from a longer life. In\nthe following paragraphs Philodemus continues this contrast between\nthose fears which cause a \u2018natural pang\u2019 and are viewed\nwith \u2018sympathy\u2019 (20.2\u20133) and those which are\nrejected as \u2018irrational\u2019, looking at their justification\nin the context of a good or a bad life. Thus, the fear that one\u2019s\nenemies will gloat over one\u2019s death is vain (mataion, often\nsynonymous with \u2018empty\u2019) and inexcusable (20.4\u20135),\nsince neither the good man nor the bad will have any inkling of such\nrejoicing once dead, as they will have no sensation, and the good\nman\u2019s demise will hardly be the object of gloating from people of\nsense, whose opinion he should alone respect. Similarly (21), it is\n\u2018insane\u2019 to gloat over and ridicule the dead, because if\nthey were bad, they are now free of their evil, and if good, they are\nno worse off now. It is also vain to be pained at the thought of dying\nleaving no children behind (22\u20134): one will be remembered by\nfriends, especially philosophical ones, one\u2019s name will be worn by\nothers in the course of future time, and one\u2019s children may not be as\nworthwhile custodians of one\u2019s legacy as one\u2019s friends.\n\n\nBy contrast, leaving behind dependents who would now have no support\nin the midst of life\u2019s catastrophes and would be in want of the\nnecessities of life does cause a \u2018very natural bite\u2019 and\nstirs tears in the sensible man (25.1 ff.). But this pain will not be\n\u2018great\u2019, since such a man\u2019s dependents will feel good\nabout his life and accomplishments, as will he himself; he will plan\nfor the care of his dependents and appoint guardians for them. If one\nis so foolish as not to do this, it is still foolish to worry about\nothers\u2019 misfortunes which would occur after one has left\none\u2019s own behind. The thought of dying in a foreign country,\nespecially if one leaves behind close relatives at home, causes a\n\u2018natural bite\u2019 even to thinking men. But this should be\nonly a \u2018prick\u2019, not a great pain (25.37 ff.). On the other\nhand, Philodemus shows no sympathy with various other fears, such as\ndying in one\u2019s bed rather than in battle, dying while in poor\nphysical condition, or having only a modest funeral. To this list is\nadded the fear of dying at sea: this is not worse than any other death,\nand what happens to one\u2019s body is not worse at sea than\nelsewhere. It is how one lives one\u2019s life that matters, not the\nmanner of one\u2019s death: if one dies at sea in a battle worthy of\nmemory by future generations, or in search of learning, or for\none\u2019s friends\u2019 sake, these are all worthwhile; but if one\nhas spent one\u2019s life at sea in search of mercantile profit, that\nis pitiable (32.31 ff.). The same considerations apply to those\nsentenced to death, whether deservedly or undeservedly (33.37 ff.), and\nto those pained at the prospect of not being remembered after their\ndeath (35.34 ff.).\n\n\nIt is this thought that the important thing is how one lives, rather\nthan that or how one dies, that dominates Philodemus\u2019 concluding\nparagraphs (37.18 ff.). In contrast to Lucretius\u2019 brilliant\nconclusion (3.894\u20131094), where an emotional funeral speaker\u2019s\npoints are dismissed by Epicurean argument, Philodemus has expressed\nsympathy for those who have lived according to rational principles and\nyet, being human, are affected by certain thoughts about death. His own\nbrilliant peroration concludes with praise of such a life. To be\nsnatched away by death as by something unexpected and strange is\nstupid: \u201cwe all live in a city with no fortification against\ndeath\u201d, which has many approaches to us. The sensible person,\nhaving received what suffices for a happy life, will live \u201claid\nout in a burial shroud\u201d and ready to face death; the dronelike\nperson gives no thought to the mortality and evanescence of his\nconstitution. Even if a sensible person forgets his mortality for a\ntime, he can, when death approaches, quickly remember the condition of\nhis life and face death unperturbedly.\n2.2.5.3.5 The Epicurean evaluation of the liberal arts\n\n\nIn his treatment of the life of Epicureans and their communities,\nPhilodemus also addresses claims by disciplines in competition with\nphilosophy for the attention of students and the conduct of adult life.\nEpicurus and his followers were well known in antiquity for their\nrejection of the Greek cultural or musical education\n(paideia)\u2014generally thought to consist in the\n\u2018liberal arts\u2019, especially grammar (the study of language,\npoetry, and prose), rhetoric, music\u2014as an institution which at\nbest distracted one from philosophy, the only route to happiness, and\nat worst instilled in the young false notions, such as those of the\ngods of poetry, and bad patterns of thought or dispositions. Epicurus\naddressed a young man who had just come to study philosophy with him\naccordingly: \u201cI call you blessed, Apelles, because you have set\nout for philosophy undefiled by any paideia\u201d (Athenaeus,\nDeipnosophistae 13.588A = fr. 117 Usener 1887).\n\nPaideia involved the learning of arts or technical\ndisciplines, technai, considered indispensable to leading a\nlife worthy of a free man. For Epicurus, philosophy was the only\ndiscipline considered indispensable to a worthwhile life and only\ninsofar as the study of nature enabled philosophers to care for their\nsoul by casting out suffering on account of false assumptions about the\nworld and enabling them to enjoy undefiled pleasures (Ep. Men.\n122, KD 12; Porphyry, Ad Marcellam 31 = fr. 221\nUsener). Accordingly, we hear mostly about the hostility of Epicurus\nand his direct pupils to other disciplines, for instance, that\nMetrodorus said that one should freely admit not knowing \u201con\nwhose side Hector was\u201d or any of Homer\u2019s verses (Plutarch,\nThat it is Impossible to Live a Pleasant Life following\nEpicurus 1094D = Metrodorus, On Poems I, fr. 24\nK\u00f6rte), or that Epicurus is said to have prescribed that the sage\nwill not orate before festival gatherings (D.L. 10.120a = fr. 572\nUsener). Yet in the same passage we hear that the sage will leave\nwritings behind (fr. 566 Usener) and will be the only one who can\nconverse correctly about music and poetry, though he will not devote\nhimself to composing poetry (fr. 568 Usener, where what is said about\nwriting poetry is, however, obscure and disputed: see, e.g., Asmis\n1995: 22, 32 f. and Sider 1995: 35 f.).\n\n\nIt is possible that Epicurus explained his position on the\nsage\u2019s relation to the \u2018liberal arts\u2019 and their\npractice in a work such as On Modes of Life, but no such\nexplanations explicitly quoted from him have come down to us. Of\nPhilodemus, on the other hand, we have a large number of books in which\nthe philosopher\u2019s use or avoidance of certain aspects of\ntechnical disciplines are made a central feature of the conduct of an\nEpicurean life. These works include the fourth and apparently last book\nOn Music (PHerc. 1497), a number of books On\nRhetoric (the main pieces are: Book 1, PHerc. 1427; Book\n2, PHerc. 1674 and 1672, two copies of the text, the former\nbeginning earlier and the latter continuing after the former ends; Book\n3, PHerc. 1506 and 1426, two copies of the same text; Book 4,\nPHerc. 1007/1673 and 1423, two copies of the same text,\npartially overlapping); Book 6 (see Dorandi 2018), PHerc.\n1669; PHerc. 1004, a lengthy book whose number is not clear,\nbut may be Book 7; Book 8, PHerc. 1015+832, one roll split\ninto top and bottom parts); and five books On Poems (Book 1,\ncf. Janko 2000; Book 2, PHerc. 994+1676; Book\n3, PHerc. 1087 and 1403; Book 4, PHerc. 207; Book\n5, PHerc. 1425 and 1538, two copies of the same text).\n2.2.5.3.6 The uses and the dangers of expertises\n\n\nSextus Empiricus says that the Epicureans attacked the liberal arts\nbecause they \u201ccontributed nothing to the perfection of\nwisdom\u201d (M 1.1). He incorporates Epicurean\ncritiques\u2014for which he appears to have used Epicurean sources\nincluding, perhaps, Zeno of Sidon and even Philodemus\nhimself\u2014into his own attacks on the liberal arts. Sextus\u2019\nattacks routinely distinguish between highly technical, theoretically\noriented versions of the arts and lower, more practical versions:\n\u2018higher grammar\u2019 treats the nature of linguistic elements\nand studies the interpretation and judgment of poetry and prose, while\n\u2018lower grammar\u2019 or \u2018grammatistic\u2019 deals with\nthe simple art of reading and writing (1.44\u20135); a technical art of\nmusic is the science of melodies, tones, rhythms, etc., not the simple\nexperience of music (6.1\u20134). It is only the higher versions of the arts\nthat Sextus attacks, while the lower versions he considers\n\u2018useful for life\u2019.\n\n\nIn his On Household Management, Philodemus says that many\narts have both non-technical and more technical forms. Thus, of baking\nand cooking there is a non-technical skill, which anyone can learn as\nuseful for providing sustenance, and something like that is true also\nof money-making; but there is also an empirical expertise (empeiria\nentechnos) of each of these, practiced by those who bend all their\nefforts to succeeding in them and, e.g., amassing and keeping as much\nmoney as possible. The Epicurean should acquire only the former of\nthese, not the latter: he should, for example, be able to provide a\nliving for himself, his family, and his friends, but he should not\nbecome expert at getting and keeping money and concentrate on that,\nwhich would take him away from the pursuit of philosophy and require\nhim to place an unreasonable importance on wealth (xvi.25\u201339,\nxvii.2\u201340). If one takes the point of view of the Epicurean sage,\nfocused on philosophy, one will keep money-making and all other arts in\ntheir proper place, learning as much of them as is necessary to secure\nthe philosophical life and even adding incremental enjoyments to it,\nwhile avoiding complex bodies of technical rules and the driven,\nprofessional pursuit of any art.\n\n\nPhilodemus defines the common Greek conception of\ntechn\u00ea as \u201ca state or disposition arising from\nobservation of certain common and elementary things extending through\nmany particular cases, which grasps something and which accomplishes\nsomething of such a sort that none of those who have not learnt it can\ndo in a similar way, whether fixedly and firmly or conjecturally\u201d\n(Rhet. 2a, PHerc. 1674.xxxviii.2\u201318 Longo). An\nartisan or expert, therefore, must have general rules which he can\napply to particular cases in order to produce results with a better\nrate of success than could otherwise be achieved. Yet any\ntechn\u00ea worth an Epicurean\u2019s attention could have\nonly a small body of rules, even if another techn\u00ea\ndealing with similar subject matter had many rules.\n\n\nThe same distinction underpins Lucretius\u2019 account of the\nhistory of culture. Early conceptions of value were reversed as humans\nbecame more sophisticated; so, bronze was originally valued higher than\ngold, as it was more useful, but gold came to be prized more highly\n(5.1241 ff.). Men learned from the birds how to sing and please the\near; they enjoyed themselves after their rustic picnics, pleasing their\nbodies without much effort when they began to dance without a regulated\nrhythm (numerus), which made them smile and laugh and helped\nkeep them awake. Now too, guards keep awake in this way, and they have\nlearned to respect regular rhythms, but they do not enjoy themselves\nany more than did their primitive ancestors (5.1379 ff.). In general,\nLucretius says, human labor is vain and the development of the arts led\nto misery and war (5.1430 ff.).\n\n\nThese Epicurean principles also determine Philodemus\u2019 attitude\nto the arts. He thinks that a certain harmless enjoyment can be got\nfrom arts such as music and poetry, so long as one acquires only a\nsimple knowledge of them, avoiding the complex technologies developed\nby the professional practitioners of those arts. The complex rules, he\nthinks, are useless and even counterproductive, being based on\narbitrary decrees (themata) laid down by the\nprofessionals.\n\n\nIn the case of music, Philodemus argues that one ought not to\npractice assiduously to become a proficient performer, distracting\noneself from the needful pursuit of philosophy, when the innocent\nenjoyment which is all the benefit that can be got from music is\navailable to anyone who just listens to the performances available to\nthe public (Mus. 4, col. 151.8\u2013239 Delattre = PHerc.\n1497.37). The claims of music theorists such as Damon of Oia and\nDiogenes of Babylon that music has a crucial role in soothing the\npassions of adults and in forming the character of the young, he\ndismisses: music as tone, melody, rhythm, affects only the irrational\near, while any effect on character or behavior must come from the words\nor poetry in songs, which is alone capable of affecting our reason\n(e.g., 146.30\u2013147.11 = PHerc. 1497.32\u20133; cf. Sextus,\nM 6.19 ff.).\n\n\nAs for poetry, Philodemus thinks that, while there is no natural\ncriterion of good verse, there are \u2018conceptions\u2019\n(ennoiai, here, apparently the same as\nprol\u00eapseis) of good and bad verse, which allow a\nuniversal judgment (koin\u00ea krisis) of poetry based on\ncriteria which exist, whether or not one recognizes them. Such poetry\ndoes not require detailed analyses or rules, attention to which spoils\none\u2019s ability to judge according to the common conceptions, so\ntreatises on poetry should concentrate on giving general principles\nwhich allow the expression of the preconceptions of the good poem\n(Poem. 5, xxx.25\u201333 Mangoni). For poetry the aims should be to\nimitate the diction which also teaches useful things and to have a\ncontent which is between what wise and vulgar people would say\n(Poem. 5, xxv.30\u2013xxvi.20, cf. Janko 2000: 131 and n. 1). After\nall, the sage will rather express what is crucially useful for life in\nphilosophical prose, while poetry will be a pleasant adjunct or\npastime. This will apply to both writing and reading, neither of which\nshould require much study or effort, if it is not to be destructive of\nthe philosophical life.\n\n\nThe best way for the Epicurean to earn a living is to share his\nphilosophical discourses with those who are able to understand them,\nand from them to receive gifts of thanks and veneration, as Epicurus\ndid. These discourses should be \u201ctruthful, free of competition,\nand, in brief, serene, since earning one\u2019s living by sophistic or\ncompetitive speeches is no better than doing so by demagogic or\nsycophantic ones\u201d (On Household Management xxiii.22\u201336).\nIn his books on Rhetoric, Philodemus consistently attacks both\nthe art and the practice of political and forensic oratory: these do\nnot qualify as arts and their practice is destructive of happiness. He\ninsists that there can be no expert method or science of consistently\npersuading crowds. There is, instead, the Epicurean\ntechn\u00ea of \u2018frank criticism\u2019, which is\npracticed between individuals in an Epicurean community.\n\n\nNow, Philodemus thinks that, unlike political and forensic oratory,\n\u2018sophistic\u2019 is a true techn\u00ea, recognized as\nsuch by the early Epicureans (e.g., Rhet. 2a, PHerc.\n1674 xxxvii.10\u201316 Longo [cf. Blank 2003: 73]), \u201can expertise of\ncomposing discourses and making displays\u201d, but he does not think\nthat the Epicurean should give speeches at public assemblies or waste\nhis time in the schools of the sophists learning tricks that could only\nengender distrust in juries or assemblies. The \u2018sophistic\u2019\nrhetoric he grants technical status has method enough to qualify it as\nsuch, \u201cbut not much of it, just as poetics does not either\u201d\n(Rhet. 2b, PHerc. 1672 xxii.29\u201339 Longo): since there\nis one naturally beautiful kind of discourse, one should ignore the\nkind of discourse composed according to arbitrary themata\n(Rhet. 4, PHerc. 1007/1673 vii.6\u201314, p. I 151\nSudhaus). Further, a good speech of praise, the goal of the sophistic\ndisplay speaker, must praise qualities that are truly praiseworthy and\nactually possessed by the subject of praise, but knowledge of such\nthings is common property, not something learnt in the rhetorical\nschools (xla.1\u201324, p. I 220\u20131 Sudhaus). Sophistic rhetoric, the only\nkind worth considering a techn\u00ea, should thus be added to\nthe arts that rely on the kind of understanding available to rational\npersons in common, rather than on rules invented by its practitioners\n(cf. Blank 1995 and 2009a).\n2.2.5.4 Theology\n\n\nWe have two books of Philodemus\u2019 work On the Gods. In\nBook I Philodemus inveighs against the popular conception of divinity,\nwith its jealous, lascivious, capricious, punishing gods. In agreement\nwith Epicurus and Lucretius he argues that such false assumptions about\nthe gods, like the fear of death, make us miserable. Book III deals\nwith various questions about the gods, including their location,\naspects of their lives such as their mode of nourishment, respiration,\nsleep, and the fact that they speak Greek. He argues against the Stoics\nthat, while the gods have foreknowledge of the future, omniscience, and\nomnipotence, they remain absolutely aloof from human affairs, as any\ninterference in our world would spoil their perfectly carefree,\ntoil-free, happy lives.\n\n\nIn his book On Piety, Philodemus defends the Epicureans\nagainst accusations of atheism, giving examples from the writings of\nEpicurus and Metrodorus to prove their belief in the gods\u2019\nimmortality and their encouragement of Epicureans to participate in the\nordinary cult observance of the gods. Epicureans have good reasons to\nuphold belief in divinity, not only on civic grounds, but also because\na proper understanding of the gods gives us models of perfect happiness\nthat we can emulate. In promotion of the proper understanding of the\ndivine, Philodemus gives an extended critique of the distortions\npromulgated in poetry and in other philosophers\u2019 works (on Philodemus\u2019 theology, see now Essler 2011).\n2.2.5.5 Biographical and other Historical Works\n\n\nThe only book of Philodemus cited in extant ancient literature is\nhis Collection of the Philosophers, the tenth book of which is\nDiogenes Laertius\u2019 source (10.3) for the statement that\nEpicurus\u2019 three brothers, Neocles, Chairedemos, and Aristoboulos,\ndid philosophy together with him (sunephilosophoun). The\nHerculaneum library has given us fragmentary remains of a number of\nworks on the history of various schools, particularly one (called by\nearlier editors the Index Academicorum) on the Platonic\nAcademy, from Plato to Aristos of Ascalon, and another on the Stoa,\nfrom Zeno to Panaetius (the Index Stoicorum), and it is\npossible that they, along with other, more fragmentary books, belonged\nto the Collection. These books contain numerous historical and\nbiographical anecdotes along with chronological indications, many from\nApollodorus\u2019 Chronicle, and fit well alongside the genre\nof philosophical histories sometimes referred to as\n\u2018Successions\u2019 (diadochai) of philosophers (see Arrighetti 2003).\nPhilodemus even refers to his own relations with some of the later\nAcademics, especially Antiochus of Ascalon (see Dorandi 1990b).\n\n\nAs we have seen (Section 2.2.5.3.3), the day-to-day conduct of an\nEpicurean community was a central topic of his works.  Accordingly,\nspecial place in Philodemus\u2019 oeuvre is reserved for\nworks about the Epicurean school itself, dealing with the example set\nby its founder and by certain of his students. The tenth book of\nthe Collection, which like Diogenes Laertius\u2019 own tenth\nbook apparently dealt with Epicurus, may well have been the\nculmination of Philodemus\u2019 historical work and was only one of a\nhost of books about their own school written by Epicureans. Philodemus\ntoo wrote other books on the school. In his two books On\nEpicurus (PHerc. 1232 and 1289; see Section 2.2.4.4.1),\nhe outlined Epicurus\u2019 life and cited letters of Epicurus and his\nfriends to show the school\u2019s founder as a model of the\nphilosophical life. In another book, perhaps titled something\nlike Courses (pragmateiai) of Epicurean Memoirs\n(PHerc. 1418, also 310 and perhaps others), Philodemus\nportrays a number of early Epicureans by means of extracts of letters\nof the school\u2019s founders (see Arrighetti 2003).\n3. Influence\n\n\nEpicureans were largely excluded from the philosophical project of\nsynthesizing Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic doctrines which came to\nprominence beginning in Philodemus\u2019 own day. The Epicureans\nthemselves had a reputation for doctrinal orthodoxy and for attributing\nany or all of their true statements to one or more of the\nschool\u2019s founders (cf. Numenius, On the Academics\u2019\nbetrayal of Plato, fr. 24.22\u201336 = Eusebius, Praeparatio\nEvangelica 14.5.3 and Seneca, Letters to Lucilius\n33.2\u20134). A number of later Epicureans relied almost exclusively on the\nearliest Epicurean texts, never mentioning those of later generations.\nThis is most famously the case for Philodemus\u2019 contemporary,\nLucretius, but also for the second century CE Epicurean Diogenes of\nOenoanda. The same tendency can be seen in other philosophers, as well:\nSeneca cites sayings of Epicurus, on the grounds that the truth is\ncommon property, while the Academic Plutarch attacks texts of the\nfirst-generation Epicurean Colotes. Philodemus\u2019 own texts,\nhowever, along with those of Demetrius of Laconia and Polystratus, show\nthat there was indeed a good deal of infighting among members of the\nschool, at least after its first generation, much of it centered on\ndiffering interpretations of the founders\u2019 doctrines.\n\n\nDiogenes Laertius 10.3\u2019s citation of Book 10 of the\nCollection of the Philosophers is the only explicit mention\nof a philosophical work of Philodemus among ancient authors. Close\ncorrespondence between some of the last part of On Piety and\nCicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods 1.25\u201341 may indicate\nthat Cicero used Philodemus\u2019 book as a source, or that the two had a\ncommon source, perhaps Zeno of Sidon. Cicero may also have used\ncontemporary Epicurean sources for the views put by Epicurean\nsurrogates in some of his other works: his character\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 mentions his (or Torquatus\u2019) friends Siro and\nPhilodemus as authorities to whom Torquatus could appeal for help\nagainst the attack made on Epicurean ethics by \u2018Cicero\u2019\n(On Moral Ends 2.119). The approach to the liberal arts\nsignaled by Sextus Empiricus in M 1\u20136 as characteristic\nof \u2018the Epicureans\u2019 is very similar to what we see in\nPhilodemus\u2019 works, as explained above (Section 2.2.5.3.5); Philodemus\nand/or Zeno probably served as Sextus\u2019 sources for this material.\nOnce the philosophical works of Philodemus began to be edited and\nto come to the attention of scholars in the later 19th century, his\ninfluence begins to be seen, albeit sporadically. C. S. Peirce, who\nwas impressed by Epicurean philosophy, especially\nthe clinamen or \u2018swerve\u2019, studied\nPhilodemus\u2019 On Methods of Inference together with his\nstudent Allan Marquand, whose Ph.D. thesis included the first English\ntranslation of the book. It was apparently from Philodemus that Peirce\ntook the term \u2018semiosis\u2019 in his characerization of\nsemiotics as \u2018the doctrine of the essential nature and\nfundamental varieties of semiosis\u2019 (cf. Fisch\n[1971] 1986 and Deledalle 2001).\nRecently, scholars of early Christianity have become interested in\nthe ways Epicureans held their school together, especially\nEpicurus\u2019 use of letters, many of which explained points of\ndoctrine and served as epitomes of his major works. These scholars\nhave related Philodemus\u2019 remarks on the conduct of an Epicurean\nschool and the relations between more advanced and less experienced\nmembers, especially in his book On Frank Criticism, to the\nwork of the Apostle Paul and his pastoral Epistles (cf. Glad\n2004).",
