He drew on his dual\ntraining in philosophy and psychology for his famous book The\nVarieties of Religious Experience: a unique compendium of\ntestimonies concerning matters such as prayer, worship and mystical\nexperience. These rich personal observations present an extended\nexample of the \u2018radical empiricism\u2019 introduced in 4.3.\nJames thereby sought to trenchantly critique the intellectual methods\nof contemporary theology (\u2018the metaphysical monster which they\noffer to our worship is an absolutely worthless invention of the\nscholarly mind\u2019 (James 1902: 447)). James also advanced a\ncelebrated argument for religious faith in his paper \u201cThe Will\nto Believe\u201d: that for questions that are living, forced and\nmomentous (though only for those), \u2018faith based on desire is\ncertainly a lawful, and possibly an indispensable thing\u2019. He\nthereby confronted his contemporary William Clifford\u2019s\nevidentialist claim that, \u2018It is wrong always, everywhere, and\nfor anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u2019\n(1877), generating a lively discussion which continues today (e.g.\nBishop 2007; Aikin 2014). \n\nDespite James\u2019 efforts to tightly circumscribe his\nargument\u2019s application, Peirce objected to such concessions in\nepistemology, calling the paper in a letter to James, \u2018a very\nexaggerated utterance, such as injures a serious man very much\u2019\n(Misak 2013: 64). Peirce himself evolved from an early positivistic\ndisdain for religious questions to producing his own theistic\narguments in later life. In 1893, he published an essay entitled\n\u201cEvolutionary Love\u201d, which passionately contested the\nsocial Darwinism promulgated by many prominent thinkers in his era,\nmost notably Herbert Spencer (Pearce 2020), which he called \u2018The\nGospel of Greed\u2019. Here Peirce urges that amongst the three ways\nthe Universe may unfold: (i) by chance, (ii) deterministically, (iii)\nthrough creative love, the third path is the highest and most likely\nto endure since \u2018\u2026growth comes only from love, from I\nwill not say self-sacrifice, but from the ardent impulse to fulfill\nanother\u2019s highest impulse\u2019 (CP 6.289). In his final years\nPeirce produced the remarkable essay \u201cA Neglected Argument for\nthe Reality of God\u201d. Here he argued for God\u2019s\nreality, not existence, to signal an ontological\npriority of intelligible principles over efficient causes. The piece\nis structured into three argumentative layers: (i) The Humble Argument\n(an invitation to a phenomenological experiment) which is enfolded by,\n(ii) The Neglected Argument (an original version of the Ontological\nArgument) which is enfolded by, (iii) The Scientific Argument (a\nprophecy of the fullness of future scientific inquiry). Work is\nongoing to draw out this unique piece\u2019s full meaning. \n\nDewey turned his hand to religious questions in his 1934 book A\nCommon Faith. Here he argued that\u2014contrary to what many\nbelieve\u2014removing faith in supernatural entities will not destroy\nreligion, but rather set it free from the many \u2018creeds and\ncults\u2019 reflecting outdated social structures that currently\nsurvive fossilised inside religious institutions. Rather than being\nembodied by any kind of entity, he argued, the sacred is a\nphase or quality of experience, namely, \u2018some complex of\nconditions that have operated to affect an orientation in\nlife\u2026that brings with it a sense of security and peace\u2019\n(LW9:13). Such conditions might equally be found in a forest or art\ngallery as a church or temple. Despite its sophisticated argumentation\nand originality, as an explication of religious life Dewey\u2019s\napproach has been considered abstract and somewhat anodyne. \n",
