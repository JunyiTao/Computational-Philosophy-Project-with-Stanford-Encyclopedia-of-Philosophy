    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Memory\n9. The Epistemology of Memory\n\nIn addition to their implications for the metaphysics of memory,\nexternal and collective memory may have novel implications for\nepistemology (Carter & Kallestrup 2016; Clark 2015;\nMichaelian & Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\nforthcoming). Most research on the epistemology of memory, however,\nreflects the traditional concerns of individual epistemology, including\nthe viability with respect to memory knowledge of broad families of\nepistemological theories, such as internalism and externalism (Madison 2017),\nand of particular theories within those families, such as foundationalism\n(Senor 1993), coherentism (Olsson & Shogenji 2004),\nand reliabilism and virtue epistemology (Shanton 2011), as well as the\nrelevance to memory of issues such as scepticism (Baldwin 2001; Moon 2017)\nand epistemic circularity (Alston 1986). Other research on the epistemology of\nmemory tackles concerns specific to memory. As Frise (2015, Other\nInternet Resources) points out, there are unresolved debates over the\nproblem of forgotten evidence (Harman 1986), the problem of forgotten\ndefeat (A.I. Goldman 1999), and the problem of stored beliefs (Moon\n2012). There are also ongoing debates over the alleged analogy between\ntestimony and memory (Barnett 2015; Dummett 1994)\nand the question whether memory is a generative or a merely\npreservative source of knowledge (Frise forthcoming; Lackey 2005;\nMatthen 2010; Salvaggio forthcoming). Issues in the\nepistemology of memory, of course, interact with issues in the\nmetaphysics of memory, but, as there is\na separate entry on the epistemology\nof memory, these interactions will not be explored here in any detail.\n",
