    "main_text": "Art and Language\n9. Art and Language\n\nThe strategic centrality of language in Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is\nbeyond doubt. The ability of artworks to bring things to mind and to\nhint at unseen meanings is reason to claim that in its speculative\ncapacities, art functions essentially like a language. Yet he\nacknowledges that linguistic means of expression are inadequate to the\ntask of conveying what occurs within an experience of art.\n\nLanguage often seems ill-suited to express what we feel. In the face\nof the overwhelming presence of works of art, the task of expressing\nin words what they say to us seems like an infinite and hopeless\nundertaking \u2026 One says this, and then one hesitates (TM 401).\n\n\nTwo claims underwrite this skepticism: words do not readily capture\nthe sheer complexity of aesthetic experience, and the finitude of\nlanguage itself prevents it from capturing the totality of such\nexperience. In other words, the experience of art always just eludes\ntheoretical containment. These are not difficulties with language\nper se, but rather reflect the limited capacity of the human\nmind to grasp the totality of its involvements. Yet in Gadamer\u2019s\nthought these negative aspects incentivize further hermeneutic\ninvolvement in aesthetic experience. The incompleteness of any\ninterpretation of an artwork opens us to the possibility that there is\nalways something more or something else that can be said. The temporal\nnature of experience and its interpretation prevent closure or, in\nother words, both are by nature always open to further ways of\nthinking and speaking about art. The argument reinforces the claim\nthat art and its interpretation extend the being of the\nsubject-matters addressed and, furthermore, that aesthetic experience\nitself has a temporal continuity which is linked to its cumulative\ncharacter as a mode of Bildung.\n\nThe issue about the relationship between art and language is not one\nof linguistic capture but of finding the appropriate words to open the\ncontent of aesthetic experience. What is meant by the notion that an\nartwork addresses us with a meaning? Although an agent of the\nlinguistic turn of the twentieth century, Gadamer\u2019s reflections\non language run counter to many semiotic theories. According to\nWeinsheimer, \u201cthe dualism of signifier and signified has no\nphenomenological basis\u201d for Gadamer \u201csince in speaking we\nhave no awareness of the world as being distinct from the word\u201d\n(Weinsheimer 1993, 162). Gadamer speaks of the perfection of the word\nas being the disappearance of any gap between sense and utterance.\nPoetry would be the \u201cparadigm case\u201d of an artwork with a\nclear and immediate presentation of meaning. Yet this is seemingly\ninconsistent with the notion of a work that\n\u201cstands-in-itself.\u201d If aspects of its meaning are\nwithheld, sense and utterance are once again separated. The word, it\nwould appear, signifies something beyond itself after all. There is,\nin other words, a tension between Gadamer wanting to hold that the\nwork of art and the world that comes forth within it are indivisible\nand saying that the world which a work invokes is larger than the work\nitself. The poetic word, insofar as it is poetic, stands-in-itself;\nand yet as word it invokes something beyond itself. Gadamer\u2019s\nspeculative account of meaning collapses, it would seem, into a\nreferential account of signs. Speculatively charged words refer to\nother signs or patterns of meaning beyond themselves. This suggests\nthat words are self-negating signs: when they function as they should,\nthey disappear into what it is referred to. To conclude that words\noperate as representational signs seems quite contrary to the account\nof art functioning in the manner of a symbol. Closer inspection\nsuggests that Gadamer\u2019s account of the speculative account of\nmeaning is presentational after all. Let us restate the question.\n\nIf the artwork is an autonomous entity that stands-in-itself and does\nnot refer to anything outside itself, what of art\u2019s speculative\ncapacity to refer to other complexes beyond its immediate horizon? The\ntheological notion of a host can dissolve the inconsistency. On the\none hand, for an artwork to have a speculative capacity, it must\ninvoke perimeters of meaning which transcend its own immediate\ncircumstance. Without this, an artwork cannot connect us with\nframeworks of otherness. Yet this argument threatens to turn\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics into an idealism referring specifically to\nthe idea which the artwork was invoking. Art would once again\nbe subordinated to a vehicle of philosophy. On the other hand, there\nis something within the constitution of an artwork that makes it\nresist theoretical reduction. Its invocation of an excess of meaning\nresists conceptual capture. This brings us to the crux of the matter.\nDoes the excess of meaning which a work can speculatively invoke exist\napart from the work that summons them? The speculative dimensions of\nart suggest that an artwork is indeed a host for that which lies\nbeyond it and yet, at the same time, the transcendent dimensions of\nmeaning (its excess of meaning), remain immanent within the work that\ninvokes them. The presence of that which transcends the work only\nmanifests itself through the work that hosts it. To\nput it another way, it is in the work that the transcendent\u00a0set\nof meanings achieves its presence. The full resonance of a\nsubject-matter, which of course extends well beyond any one work, is\nnevertheless only discernible in the works that host them. Indeed,\nsubject-matters do not exist apart from the works that manifest their\npresence. Ontologically speaking they inhere within the work. The work\nis the occasion in which these dimensions of meaning appear, and they\ncommand the attention of the viewer so long as the work holds them in\nplay. In other words, with regard to the tension between\nrepresentation and presentation in Gadamer\u2019s position, the\nspeculative charge of artworks does indeed suggest that they function\nas representational signs always referring beyond the given meaning.\nYet this is another way of saying that, ontologically speaking,\nartworks function as symbols. Considered as a referential sign, what\nthe artwork refers to is not a world independent of the sign but\nanother set of signs. However, such other configurations of meaning\nmay mean more than the signs that invoke them, but they are inherent\nwithin those very signs. In other words, the very signs which refer\nspeculatively to other dimensions of meaning also function\nsymbolically in that the other horizons of meaning invoked are\nimmanent within the work\u2019s autonomy. As a symbolic host, the\nartwork holds that which refers beyond itself within itself.\n",
