    "main_text": "Escaping the KS Argument || Denial of Value Realism\n5.2 Denial of Value Realism\n\n\nThe derivation of FUNC essentially consists in the construction of an\nobservable (i.e. f(Q)) via an operator (i.e.,\nf(Q)) from the probability distribution of a\nvariable (i.e. f(v(Q)) which number in turn\nis constructed from another variable,\n(i.e. v(Q)). Now, instead of denying that\nv(Q) exists in all cases (as the first option (5.1)\nwould have it), we can reject that the existence of a number \u03b1\nand the construction of f(Q) automatically\nlead to an observable, i.e. we reject VR. This amounts to rejecting\nthat for every self-adjoint operator, there is a well-defined\nobservable.\n\n\nNow, in order to formulate VR we had to give a reduced reading\nto the statistical algorithm, i.e. that it is a mere mathematical\ndevice for calculating numbers from vectors, operators and numbers.\nThis reading is very artificial and presupposes that a minimal interpretive\napparatus required to make physical sense of some operators (like\nQ) can be withheld for others (like\nf(Q)).\n\n\nMoreover, it seems entirely implausible to assume that some operators\n\u2014 sums and products of operators that are associated with\nwell-defined observables \u2014 are themselves not associated with\nwell-defined observables, even if they mathematically inherit exact\nvalues from their summands or factors. Put in a crude example, this\nwould amount to saying that to ask for a system\u2019s energy is a\nwell-defined question, while to ask for the square of the system\u2019s\nenergy is not, even if, from our answer to the first question and\ntrivial mathematics, we have a well-defined answer at hand. There\nseems no good a priori reason to justify this restriction. So, to make\nrejecting VR plausible at all, an additional proposal is made: It is\ncrucial to the KS argument that one and the same operator is\nconstructed from different maximal ones which are incompatible:\nf(Q) is identical to\ng(P), where PQ \u2212\nQP \u2260 0. We now assume that only the\nconstruction of f(Q) via Q, but not\nthe one via P, leads to a well-defined observable in a\ncertain\n context.[14]\n\n\nThis move however, automatically makes some observables\ncontext-sensitive. So, this way of motivating the denial of VR\namounts to a kind of contextualism, which we might come by cheaper,\nby directly rejecting NC, and without any tampering with the\nstatistical algorithm.  (This fact explains why we did not mention\ndenial of VR as a separate option in the introduction.).\n",
