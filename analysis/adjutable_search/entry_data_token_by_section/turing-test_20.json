    "main_text": "Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test || Probabilistic Support\n4.4 Probabilistic Support\n\nWhen we look at the initial formulation that Turing provides of his\ntest, it is clear that he thought that the passing of the test would\nprovide probabilistic support for the hypothesis of intelligence.\nThere are at least two different points to make here. First, the\nprediction that Turing makes is itself probabilistic: Turing\npredicts that, in about fifty years from the time of his writing, it\nwill be possible to programme digital computers to make them play the\nimitation game so well that an average interrogator will have no more\nthan a seventy per cent chance of making the right identification\nafter five minutes of questioning. Second, the probabilistic nature of\nTuring\u2019s prediction provides good reason to think that the\ntest that Turing proposes is itself of a probabilistic\nnature: a given level of success in the imitation game\nproduces\u2014or, at any rate, should produce\u2014a specifiable\nlevel of increase in confidence that the participant in question is\nintelligent (has thoughts, is possessed of a mind). Since Turing\ndoesn\u2019t tell us how he supposes that levels of success in the\nimitation game correlate with increases in confidence that the\nparticipant in question is intelligent, there is a sense in which The\nTuring Test is greatly underspecified. Relevant variables clearly\ninclude: the length of the period of time over which the questioning\nin the game takes place (or, at any rate, the \u201camount\u201d of\nquestioning that takes place); the skills and expertise of the\ninterrogator (this bears, for example, on the \u201cdepth\u201d and\n\u201cdifficulty\u201d of the questioning that takes place); the\nskills and expertise of the third player in the game; and the number\nof independent sessions of the game that are run (particularly when\nthe other participants in the game differ from one run to the next).\nClearly, a machine that is very successful in many different runs of\nthe game that last for quite extended periods of time and that involve\nhighly skilled participants in the other roles has a much stronger\nclaim to intelligence than a machine that has been successful in a\nsingle, short run of the game with highly inexpert participants. That\na machine has succeeded in one short run of the game against inexpert\nopponents might provide some reason for increase in confidence that\nthe machine in question is intelligent: but it is clear that results\non subsequent runs of the game could quickly overturn this initial\nincrease in confidence. That a machine has done much better than\nchance over many long runs of the imitation game against a variety of\nskilled participants surely provides much stronger evidence that the\nmachine is intelligent. (Given enough evidence of this kind, it seems\nthat one could be quite confident indeed that the machine is\nintelligent, while still\u2014of course\u2014recognizing that\none\u2019s judgment could be overturned by further evidence, such as\na series of short runs in which it does much worse than chance against\nparticipants who use the same strategy over and over to expose the\nmachine as a machine.)\n\nThe probabilistic nature of The Turing Test is often overlooked. True\nenough, Moor (1976, 2001)\u2014along with various other\ncommentators\u2014has noted that The Turing Test is\n\u201cinductive,\u201d i.e. that \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d\nprovides no more than defeasible evidence of intelligence. However, it\nis one thing to say that success in \u201ca rigorous Turing\ntest\u201d provides no more than defeasible evidence of intelligence;\nit is quite another to note the probabilistic features to which we\nhave drawn attention in the preceding paragraph. Consider, for\nexample, Moor\u2019s observation (Moor 2001:83) that \u201c\u2026\ninductive evidence gathered in a Turing test can be outweighed by new\nevidence. \u2026 If new evidence shows that a machine passed the\nTuring Test by remote control run by a human behind the scenes, then\nreassessment is called for.\u201d This\u2014and other similar\npassages\u2014seems to us to suggest that Moor supposes that a\n\u201crigorous Turing test\u201d is a one-off event in which the\nmachine either succeeds or fails. But this interpretation of The\nTuring Test is vulnerable to the kind of objection lodged by\nBringsjord (1994): even on a moderately long single run with\nrelatively expert participants, it may not be all that unlikely that\nan unintelligent machine serendipitously succeeds in the imitation\ngame. In our view, given enough sufficiently long runs with different\nsufficiently expert participants, the likelihood of serendipitous\nsuccess can be made as small as one wishes. Thus, while\nBringsjord\u2019s \u201cargument from serendipity\u201d has force\nagainst some versions of The Turing Test, it has no force against the\nmost plausible interpretation of the test that Turing actually\nproposed.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is quite easy to construct more\nsophisticated versions of \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d that yield\nmore fine-grained statistical data. For example, rather than getting\nthe judges to issue Yes/No verdicts about both of the participants in\nthe game, one could get the judges to provide probabilistic answers.\n(\u201cI give a 75% probability to the claim that A is the machine,\nand only 25% probability to the claim that B is the machine.\u201d)\nThis point is important when one comes to consider criticisms of the\n\u201cmethodology\u201d implicit in \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d.\n(For further discussion of the probabilistic nature of \u201cThe\nTuring Test\u201d, see Shieber (2007).)\n",
