The Macro and the Micro Perspectives\n\n\nScientists grow more concerned about philosophical questions when\nscientific limitations or conceptual choices are made apparent to them.\nThose scientists who study deep time, deep space, abstract issues, or\nquestions of ethics are often keenly aware of the philosophical choices\nthat influence their research from identification of research question\nto interpretation of the data. This section briefly goes through\nother scientific contexts in which how life is defined is relevant,\nwhich address scales well below and well above the organism level.\nThere are several biological entities for which it is an open\nquestion as to whether they are alive. Viruses, for example, are units\nof genetic material encased in a protein coat. It is unknown whether all\nviruses share common ancestor (Koonin et al. 2006, Moreira and\nL\u00f3pez Garcia 2009) nor how they originated, be it escaped\ntransposable elements, reduced cells, or some ancestral third option\n(Forterre 2006b). The status of viruses as living is mired with controversy, with some people holding virons to be alive, others\nbelieving them not to be, and a third camp has them as living only in\nthe context of an infected cell, but a mere \u2018seed\u2019\notherwise (Forterre 2010).\nThere are other entities in the \u201ctwilight zone of\nmicrobiology,\u201d including transposable elements, viroids,\nunculturable (but putatively existing) microbes, organisms in\nvegetative states, and prions (Postgate 1999). The problems facing each\nof these are similar: several of them can evolve by natural selection,\nare biochemically complex, but lack other properties associated with\nlife. For example, prions are protein products of life that can fold\nother prions in a way that allows for cumulative evolution (Li et al.\n2010). They are rarely included in the category \u2018life\u2019 due\nto their inactivity in most settings and rather simple origin as a\nmisfold of a functional protein.\nIf there is a twilight zone of microbiology, there is also a\ntwilight zone of ecology. Organisms form populations, species,\nlineages, clades, and ecosystems. The status of each of these is an\nopen question, but they have many of the same features associated with\nlife as described above. Perhaps the strongest case can be made for\neusocial insects, such as some ants, bees, wasps, and termites. In\nseveral species, there are rigid distinctions between the castes that\nreproduce and those that do not, with many of the latter serving the\nrole of caring for the young (H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson 2009). One\nmight note that entities above the organism level are as a rule less\nintegrated and connected than the organisms that comprise them. This is\nperhaps a general feature of life: from the perspective of every item\nin the biological hierarchy, its parts are much more homogenous than it\nis. Our cells seem much more integrated and self-contained than our\nbodies, so, too, are individual insects more self-contained than the\ncolonies to which they belong.\nMost controversial has been the case of Gaia. Gaia is a term from\nGreek mythology; she is a personification of the planet Earth. In 1979,\nJames Lovelock, revived the concept in his book, Gaia: A New Look\nat Life on Earth. In his view, the Earth-wide set of interlocking\necosystems could be viewed as a single entity. One insight of\nLovelock\u2019s was already mentioned in the previous section:\nplanet-wide interactions are the scale that matters in detecting life\nelsewhere. Lovelock\u2019s book sparked controversy centered around\nthe plausibility of his model of the Earth as a self-regulating\nhomeostatic system. In the view of many at the time, it was an\ninaccurate description: Earth could not evolve in principle,  and\nthe subsequent ontological move of granting Earth the status of life\nwas unmotivated (Doolittle 1981). Recent attempts to revitalize the\nnotion of Gaia on a more theoretic footing involve both abiotic and\nbiotic regulatory mechanisms and natural selection acting at the level\nof clades (Lenton et al. 2018, Doolittle 2019). Regardless of current\nattempts at a theoretical justification, the thought of Earth as a\nliving entity motivated many in the environmental movement and the idea\nremains a common reference.\n",
