    "main_text": "\n\nThe world we inhabit isn\u2019t an undifferentiated bog. Everywhere\nthere\u2019s repetition and, importantly, we can even distinguish\ndifferent types of repetition. We see one cat and then\nanother cat. But we can also see that our cat is on top\nof the mat and subsequently notice that the cat from next door is\non top of the fence. Repetition in the first sense requires\nonly one thing and then another. By contrast, repetition in the second\nsense requires two (or more) things and then two (or more) other\nthings. Properties are typically introduced to account for repetition\nin the first sense, whereas relations are typically introduced to\naccount for repetition in the second sense. There\u2019s cat\nrepetition because there is more than one thing that has a certain\nproperty, the property of being a cat. There\u2019s above-and-below\nrepetition because there is more than one thing that bears a certain\nrelation to something else, the relation that holds between two things\nwhen one is on top of the other.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful whether the distinction between properties and\nrelations can be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose\nit\u2014the distinction is so basic. Nevertheless, there are\nelucidations on offer that may help us better appreciate the\ndistinction. Properties merely hold of the things that have\nthem, whereas relations aren\u2019t relations of anything,\nbut hold between things, or, alternatively, relations are\nborne by one thing to other things, or, another\nalternative paraphrase, relations have a subject of inherence\nwhose relations they are and termini to which they\nrelate the subject. More examples may help too. When we say that a\nthing \\(A\\) is black, or \\(A\\) is long, then we are asserting that\nthere is some property \\(A\\) has. But when we say that \\(A\\) is\n(wholly) inside \\(B\\) then we are asserting that there is a relation\nin which \\(A\\) stands to \\(B\\).\n\nBe careful though not to be misled by these examples. \\(A\\) can only\nbe (wholly) inside \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is distinct from \\(B\\). So the\nrelation in which \\(A\\) stands to \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is (wholly) inside\n\\(B\\) requires a distinct subject from terminus. By contrast, \\(A\\)\ncan be black without prejudice to anything else. But we cannot infer\nstraightaway that every relation holds between more than one thing\nbecause there may be some relations that a thing bears to itself, if,\nfor example, identity is a relation. So we cannot distinguish\nproperties from relations by appealing to the number of distinct\nthings required for their exhibition, since these may be the same,\nviz. one. Hence the plausibility of thinking that a relation differs\nfrom a property because a relation, unlike a property, proceeds\nfrom a subject to a terminus, even if the subject\nand terminus are identical.\n\nTheories of relations add to, subtract from or qualify this basic\npackage of ideas in various ways. But with the distinction between\nproperties and relations in hand we can already do some worthwhile\nconceptual geography, distinguishing four regions of logical space.\n(1) Rejection of both properties and relations. (2) Acceptance of\nproperties but rejection of relations. (3) Acceptance of relations but\nrejection of properties. (4) Acceptance of both properties and\nrelations. (1) amounts to a form of thoroughgoing nominalism and is\ntypically motivated by a blanket aversion to the doctrine that general\nwords like \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cbefore\u201d refer to\nworldly items, whether properties or relations. By contrast, (2), (3)\nand (4) amount to different forms of realism, whether about properties\nand/or relations. Typically they are motivated either by an especial\nantipathy toward relations (2) or, alternatively, an appreciation of\ntheir distinctive utility ((3) and (4)). Here we will focus upon what\nit is about relations in particular that makes philosophers either\nlove them or hate them.\n",
