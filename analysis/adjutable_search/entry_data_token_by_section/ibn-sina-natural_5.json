    "main_text": "Bodies and Magnitudes || Continuity\n2.3 Continuity\n\nHaving rejected atomism, with its central claim that sensible bodies\nmust be aggregates of a finite number of conceptually indivisible\nparts, Avicenna must explain and defend his preferred account of\nbodies. Avicenna adopts a modified form of Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nthe continuity of bodies. Aristotle himself had provided no fewer than\nthree different accounts of continuity (Gk. sunecheia, Ar.\nitti\u1e63\u0101l):\n\nAB is continuous iff AB can be divided into things always capable\nof further division (Physics, 3.7 & De Caelo,\n1.1)\nA is continuous with B iff the extremities of A and B are one and\nthe same (Physics, 6.1)\nA is continuous with B iff there is a common boundary at which\nthey join together (Categories, 6)\n\n\nPrecisely because these three accounts are different, Avicenna starts\nhis own discussion of continuity, claiming that \u201cbeing\ncontinuous is an equivocal expression that is said in three\nways\u201d (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.2 [8]). Two of these senses, he\ncontinues, are relative notions, while only one, i.e., (3) above,\nidentifies the true essence of what it is to be continuous. In fact,\nhe even goes as far as to say that account (1) is not truly a\ndefinition of being continuous at all; rather, it is a necessary\naccident of the continuous that must be demonstrated, a point to which\nI return when I look at what Avicenna considers to be the proper\naccount of continuity.\n\nAs for the relative notions of continuity, the explanations can be\nquick. First, discrete objects might be said to constitute a\ncontinuous whole relative to a motion. For example, all the connected\ncars on a moving locomotive are clearly distinct and separate things,\nand yet they move together as a continuous whole. Second, discrete\nobjects might be said to be continuous according to Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition (2) relative to some shared extremity. For example, for any\nangle \u2220ABC greater than or less than 180\u00b0, the lines AB and BC\nshare one and the same extremity, B, and yet are distinct and jointed.\nNeither of these senses is strictly speaking the target of the\natomist\u2019s critique nor the thesis concerning the continuity of\nbodies and magnitudes that Avicenna (or other Aristotelians) is keen\nto defend. Thus for Avicenna only (3), that two things are continuous\nif and only if there is a common boundary at which they join together,\ncaptures the proper definition of continuity.\n\nA continuous sensible body (or any magnitude), Avicenna insists, must\nultimately lack any parts and instead must be considered entirely as a\nunified whole. Admittedly, one can posit parts in this unified whole,\nlike the left-part and the right-part, but such accidental parts are\nwholly the result of one\u2019s positing and they vanish, claims\nAvicenna, with the cessation of the positing.\n\n[Such parts are] like what happens when our estimative faculty\nimagines or we posit two parts for a line that is actually one, where\nwe distinguish one [part] from the other by positing. In that way, a\nlimit is distinguished for [the line] that is the same as the limit of\nthe other division. In that case, both are said to be continuous with\neach other. Each one, however, exists individually only as long as\nthere is the positing, and so, when the positing ceases, there is no\nlonger this and that [part]; rather, there is the\nunified whole that actually has no division within it. Now, if what\noccurs through positing were to be something existing in the thing\nitself and not [merely] by positing, then it would be possible for an\nactually infinite number of parts to exist within the body (as we\nshall explain), but this is absurd (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.2 [8]).\n\n\nTo press Avicenna\u2019s point a bit further, a continuous body has\nno parts in it, not even potential parts, if by \u201cpotential\nparts\u201d one means points or the like latent within the body\nwaiting for some power to actualize them or divide the body at them.\nTo appreciate Avicenna\u2019s point here fully, a few words must be\nsaid about his conception of the form-matter constitution of bodies\nand the relation of his view of continuity to psychological\nprocesses.\n\nLike Aristotle and other Aristotelians both before and after him,\nAvicenna is convinced that bodies are constituted of matter and form.\nIf one considers just body as such, that is, disregarding any specific\nkind of body it might be, then this absolute body, Avicenna tells us,\nis a composite of matter (hay\u016bl\u0101) and the form of\ncorporeality (\u1e63\u016bra jismiyya). Avicenna conceives\nmatter as wholly passive, having no active qualities or features. (For\ndiscussion\u2019s of Avicenna theory of matter see Hyman 1965;\nBuschmann 1979; Stone 2001; McGinnis 2012; but also see Lammer 2018,\n\u00a73.2 for corrections of some of these earlier views.) In fact,\nAvicennan matter has no positive characterizations of its own at all\nby which it can be defined; rather, for Avicenna, matter is best\nunderstood solely in relation to the forms by which it is actualized\nand informed. Avicenna\u2019s matter, then, is intimately linked with\nrelative privation (\u02bfadam), that is, some lack, which\nunder the right conditions can be realized. Given matter\u2019s\nessentially privative character, it, then, cannot be the explanation\nfor a sensible body\u2019s having the positive characteristics of\nbeing unified and one, nor the cause of that body\u2019s being\nextended so as to be subject to division. Instead, according to\nAvicenna, what makes a body a unified whole and subject to division is\nits form of corporeality.\n\nFor a determinate body to exist at all, Avicenna believes, it must\nhave a determinate shape, and so be three dimensional, and so be\nlocalized in space. Both of these features are the result of its\ncorporeal form (For a fuller discussion see Hyman 1965; Shihadeh 2014;\nLammer 2018, \u00a73.1). When the form of corporeality comes to inform\nmatter, there comes to be a single unified body, existing on account\nof its particular and individual form of corporeality. Should the body\nbe physically divided, the particular and individual form of\ncorporeality is not so much divided as destroyed and replaced with two\nnew particular and individual forms of corporeality corresponding with\ntwo new bodies. It is essentially the form of corporeality that\nunifies and makes a body numerically and actually one. Additionally,\nwhile the form of corporeality makes the body actually one,\nit also makes the body potentially many. That is to say, the\nform of corporeality is the cause of a body\u2019s being\nthree-dimensional such that one can posit such divisions as right-side\nand left-side in it.\n\nWe are now led to the role of psychological processes in\nAvicenna\u2019s account of a continuous body\u2019s infinite\ndivisibility. While it is true for Avicenna that continuous bodies can\nconceptually be divided without end, such a feature is not the result\nof any positive attribute within the body. This potentiality for\ndivision does not correspond with any positive features latent within\nthe body. Instead the potentiality for infinite division refers to a\nprivation in the matter of the body. The matter, extended and\npossessing quantity as a result of the form of corporeality, does not\npreclude or prevent one from positing imagined divisions within the\nbody as small as one wants. Indeed, this psychological process of\nimaging or positing divisions in principle has no end. Thus, looking\nat, for example, a meter stick, one can posit a halfway point, then\nthe halfway point of one side and then a further halfway point and so\non as long as one likes; however, as soon as one stops the process of\nimagining halfway points, the imagined points (regardless of how many\none has imagined) do not magically remain but altogether cease with\nthe cessation of their being posited. The body remains as it always\nwas, a unified whole, whose unity is only ever lost by actual physical\ndivision, not conceptual division.\n\nWith this conception of continuity in place, the Kal\u0101m argument\nagainst potential divisibility ad infinitum dissolves. Again that\nargument assumed two principles: (1) the impossibility of an\nactual infinity; and (2) an analysis of potentiality in terms\nof an agent\u2019s power, namely, the view that some action \u03c6 is\npotential if and only if there is an agent who has the power actually\nto do \u03c6. In point of fact, Avicenna rejects both principles (his\nconception of infinity is discussed at\n 2.4);\n for now he simply questions the theologians\u2019 inference from\nsomething\u2019s being potential to the possibility of its being\nrealized all at once at some moment or other. The original Kal\u0101m\nargument assumed that a potential infinity of divisions existed in a\ncontinuous body. In that case, the argument continued, let God\nactualize that potential, and one is confronted with an actual\ninfinity. Avicenna in contrast understands the potential infinite\ndivisibility of bodies in terms of an ongoing process of positing\nsuccessive divisions within the magnitude, a process that by\ndefinition has no end. Of course, there is a contradiction here in\nassuming that some agent, even God, can get to the end of some process\nthat has no end, but such a contradiction does not tell against\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of continuous bodies. In fact,\nAvicenna\u2019s conception of potential infinite divisibility is\ncompatible with (2), since there is no immediate contradiction in\nsaying that God eternally and without ceasing posits ever-decreasing\nhalfway points in some magnitude. Still even in this case, there never\nis an actual infinity of such halfway points, as the proponents of\nKal\u0101m atomism maintain.\n",
