    "main_text": "Two Conceptions of Natural Selection\n1. Two Conceptions of Natural Selection\n\nNatural selection is chiefly discussed in two different ways among\ncontemporary philosophers and biologists. One usage, the\n\u201cfocused\u201d one, aims to capture only a single element of\none iteration of Darwin\u2019s process under the rubric\n\u201cnatural selection\u201d, while the other, the\n\u201ccapacious\u201d usage, aims to capture a full cycle under the\nsame rubric. These are clearly alternative, non-competing uses of the\nterm, and distinct philosophical controversies surround each one. This\nsection distinguishes these two uses and the following two sections\nare dedicated to the debates that surround each one. Sections 4 and 5\nconsider how natural selection connects to explanation and causation.\n\n\nIn Darwin\u2019s wake, theorists have developed formal, quantitative\napproaches to modeling Darwin\u2019s process. The\n\u201cfocused\u201d usage of natural selection finds its home as an\ninterpretation of a single term in some of these formalisms (and only\nsome of them). Below, we will consider two formal approaches, type\nrecursions and the Price Equation, elements of which have been\ninterpreted as quantifying selection. In the Price Equation, the\ncovariance of offspring number and phenotype is interpreted as\nquantifying selection; in type recursions, fitness variables (or,\nequivalently, selection coefficients) are interpreted as quantifying\nselection. What makes these interpretations focused is that they\nquantify only a single element of Darwin\u2019s process using the\nnotion natural selection; other facets of Darwin\u2019s process are\nhandled in other ways. So, in type recursions for instance, type\nfrequency variables quantify how the population varies, and\n\u201cspontaneous\u201d variations are quantified by mutation\nparameters. Similarly, in the Price Equation, inheritance is captured\nby a different term than the term that is interpreted as quantifying\nnatural selection. The point is that each formal apparatus as a whole\nis understood to capture Darwin\u2019s process, while only a single\nelement of that apparatus is said to refer to natural selection.\n\nSome philosophers\u2019 definitions of natural selection are clearly\nintended to capture this focused usage of the term. Millstein, for\ninstance, characterizes selection as a discriminate sampling process\n(Millstein 2002: 35). Otsuka identifies natural selection with the\ncausal influence of traits on offspring number in causal-graphical\nmodels (Otsuka 2016: 265). Okasha interprets the covariance of\noffspring number and offspring phenotype as quantifying the causal\ninfluence of selection (Okasha 2006: 28) Clearly, these uses of\n\u201cnatural selection\u201d are meant to capture only an element\nof Darwin\u2019s process; they make no mention of inheritance or\nreplication. As discussed further below, controversies over the\nfocused notion of selection have to do with whether the focused notion\nof selection can be distinguished from that of drift\n (section 3),\n and whether selection, in the focused sense, should be counted as a\ncause\n (section 5).\n\nThe alternative, \u201ccapacious\u201d, usage of the notion of\nnatural selection is to capture Darwin\u2019s process in its\nentirety, rather than a single contributor to it. Because\nDarwin\u2019s process is cyclical, specifying what is sufficient for\na single cycle of it, a single instance of, say, replication of genes\nfor long legs caused by long-legged wolves making narrow captures, is\nsufficient to specify a process that may explain adaptation and\nspeciation. This is true, anyway, when it is added that the process\ngets repeated. The capacious notion, capturing a cycle of\nDarwin\u2019s process, is used by Lewontin and later authors working\nin the same vein, who put forward conditions for evolution by natural\nselection: these include variation, inheritance, and reproduction.\nWhile falling within the scope of \u201cnatural selection\u201d in\nthe capacious sense used by Lewontin, these elements of Darwin\u2019s\nprocess are treated as distinct from natural selection when that\nnotion is used in its focused sense.\n",
