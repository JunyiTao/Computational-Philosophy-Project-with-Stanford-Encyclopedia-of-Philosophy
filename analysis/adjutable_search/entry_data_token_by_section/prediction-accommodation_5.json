    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || Reliable Discovery Methods\n6.1 Reliable Discovery Methods\n\nPatrick Maher (1988, 1990, 1993) presented a seminal thought\nexperiment and a Bayesian analysis of its predictivist implications.\n\n\nThe thought experiment contained two scenarios: in the first scenario,\na subject (the accommodator) is presented with E, a sequence of\n99 coin flips. E forms an apparently random sequence of heads\nand tails. The accommodator is then instructed to tell us the outcome\nof the first 100 flips\u2014he responds by reciting E and then\nadding the prediction that the 100th toss will be\nheads\u2014the conjunction of E and this last toss is\nT. In the other scenario, another subject (the predictor) is\nasked to predict the first 100 flip outcomes without witnessing any\noutcomes\u2014the predictor endorses theory T. Thereafter the\ncoin is flipped 99 times, E is established, and the\npredictor\u2019s first 99 predictions are confirmed. The question is\nin which of these two scenarios is T better confirmed. It is\nstrongly intuitive that T is better confirmed in the\npredictor\u2019s scenario than in the accommodator\u2019s scenario,\nsuggesting that predictivism holds true in this case. If we allow\n\u2018O\u2019 to assert that evidence E was input into\nthe construction of T, predictivism asserts: \n\\[\\tag{1}\n P(T \\mid E \\amp \\neg O) \\gt P(T \\mid E \\amp O)\n\\]\n\n\nMaher argues that the successful prediction of the initial 99 flips\nconstitutes persuasive evidence that the predictor \u2018has a\nreliable method\u2019 for making predictions of coin flip outcomes.\nT\u2019s consistency with E in the case of the\naccommodator provides no particular evidence that the\naccommodator\u2019s method of prediction is reliable\u2014thus we\nhave no particular reason to endorse his prediction about the\n100th flip. Allowing R to assert that the method in\nquestion is reliable, and \\(M_T\\) that method M generated\nhypothesis T, this amounts to: \n\\[\\tag{2}\nP(R \\mid M_T \\amp E \\amp \\neg O) \\gt P(R\\mid M_T \\amp E \\amp O)\n\\]\n\n\nMaher\u2019s (1988) provides a rigorous proof of (2), which is shown\nto entail (1) on various assumptions. \n\nMaher\u2019s (1988) makes the simplifying assumption that any method\nof prediction used by a predictor is either completely reliable (this\nis the claim abbreviated by \u2018R\u2019) or is no better\nthan a random method (\\(\\neg R\\)). (Maher [1990] shows that this\nassumption can be surrendered and a continuum of degrees of\nreliability of scientific methods assumed; the predictivist result is\nstill generated.) In qualitative terms, where M generates\nT (and thus predicts E) without input of evidence\nE, we should infer that it is much more likely that the method\nthat generated E is reliable than that E just happened\nto turn out true though R was no better than a random method.\nIn other words, we judge that we are much more likely to stumble on a\nsubject using a reliable method M of coin flip prediction than\nwe are to stumble on a sequence of 99 true flip predictions that were\nmerely lucky guesses\u2014because \n\\[\nP(R) \\gg \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{99}(1-P(R)).\n\\]\n\n\nMaher has articulated a weak heuristic predictivism because he claims\nthat predictive success is symptomatic of the use of a reliable\ndiscovery\n method.[7]\n\n\nFor critical discussion of Maher\u2019s theory of predictivism see\nHowson and Franklin 1991 (and Maher\u2019s 1993 reply); Barnes\n1996a,b; Lange 2001; Harker 2006; and Worrall\n 2014.[8]\n\n",
