    "main_text": "Moral Particularism and Justification || Rule of Thumb Particularism\n6. A Priori Justification and Early 21st Century Intuitionism\n\nEthical intuitionism fell on hard times in the second half of the\n20th century. But as the century closed and moving into the\n21st century, a number of able defenders of the view came\nforward, e.g., Robert Audi (2004), Michael Huemer (2005), Russ\nShafer-Landau (2005), Ralph Wedgwood (2007) and John Bengstrom,\nTerence Cuneo, and Russ Shafer-Landau (2019). (For good introductions\nto the recent discussion of intuitionism see Stratton-Lake 2002 and\nthe entry on\n intuitionism in ethics.)\n Perhaps the resurgence of ethical intuitionism is in part a result of\nthe increased attention philosophers have been paying to the role of\nintuition in philosophical inquiry more broadly. (A good starting\npoint for this topic is provided by the essays in DePaul and Ramsey\n1998, and see the entry on\n intuition.)\n We will close with an examination of the version of this \u201cnew\nintuitionism\u201d presented by Audi\u2014which he calls\n\u201cmoderate rationalist intuitionism\u201d (Audi\n2020)\u2014focusing on the epistemological side of his position.\n\nAudi\u2019s version of intuitionism is very much in the spirit of the\nearlier intuitionism espoused by Moore and especially Ross. He\nmoderates a number of elements of their intuitionism, highlights\nothers, and arguably breaks with at least Ross on one significant\npoint. We will begin with two ways in which his intuitionism softens\nelements of theirs.\n\nFirst, earlier intuitionists did not consistently distinguish between\ntwo roles for necessity or self-evidence. Moral intuition might\nconsist in apprehending that some moral proposition is necessary, or\nthat it is self-evident. Or moral intuition might consist in just\napprehending some moral proposition\u2019s truth, while the\nproposition is in fact necessary or it is in fact self-evident. As a\nresult, the earlier intuitionists often suggest our knowledge of\nfundamental moral principles is grounded in recognition of either the\nnecessity or self-evidence of these principles. This imposes too\nstrong a requirement on the a priori justification of moral\nprinciples. We cannot expect ordinary people to possess technical,\nphilosophical concepts such as necessity and self-evidence. But there\nis no need to exclude ordinary people who lack these concepts from\nhaving a priori knowledge of ordinary moral propositions,\ne.g., that pain is bad or that promising to do something provides a\nmoral reason for doing it. And even if an ordinary person does have\nthe concepts of necessity and self-evidence, there is no reason to\ndeny that the person knows ordinary moral propositions a\npriori when she or he believes them on the basis of understanding\nthem, without noting their modal status (as necessary) or epistemic\nstatus (as self-evident). Doing so is not required by the standard\naccount of self-evidence. Audi is very clear about the distinction\nbetween apprehending the necessity or self-evidence of a proposition,\nand apprehending the truth of a proposition that is necessary or\nself-evident. He does not require the former in order to have a\npriori knowledge of fundamental moral principles (2004:\n41\u201345).\n\nAudi stresses a second point, one we mentioned when discussing Ross.\nThe earlier intuitionists held that there was no reason or evidence\nfor self-evident moral principles and that they could not be\nproven. Examining why they might have made such strong claims would\ntake us too far afield. It is sufficient to note that there is no need\nfor intuitionists to make them. What\u2019s important for their\noverall position is the possibility of being non-inferentially\njustified in believing fundamental moral principles. This does not\nrequire that it is impossible to provide reasons or evidence or even a\nproof for any moral principle. Audi\u2019s intuitionism takes the\nmore moderate position that self-evident moral principles can\nbe justified without reasons, evidence or proof (2004:\n51\u201354).\n\nThere is an important element of Ross\u2019s intuitionism that Audi\ndoes not moderate, but instead makes more of than Ross. We previously\nnoted that Ross\u2019s conception of self-evidence is more restricted\nthan the standard conception in that self-evident propositions are\nevident to those who have reached sufficient mental maturity and given\nthem sufficient attention, rather than to anyone who understands them.\nThe more restricted understanding allows an explanation of why people\nwho understand a self-evident proposition might nevertheless not have\na justification for believing it. On the plausible assumption that\nthere is a close connection between what is evident for a person and\nwhat a person believes, Ross\u2019s weaker conception also suggests\nan explanation of why some people who understand a self-evident\nproposition might believe it while others do not. Audi uses different\nterminology from Ross, formulating the relevant condition on\nself-evidence in terms of \u201cadequate understanding\u201d. But\nfor Audi adequate understanding requires rather more than mere\nsemantic comprehension, and, in the end, his view is probably quite\nclose to Ross\u2019s. Audi\u2019s view of adequate understanding\nemerges when he explains how reasonable people could disagree about\nself-evident moral propositions as well as how one might continue to\nbe justified in spite of disagreement (see 2015: 67\u201372). So Audi\ndevelops and does important work with the possibilities Ross\u2019s\nmore restricted conception of self-evidence opened up, but Ross did\nnot much explore.\n\nWe now come to the point where Audi arguably breaks with much earlier\nthought regarding intuitionism. A second element of the earlier\nintuitionism that Audi emphasizes concerns the connection between\nintuition and belief. Neither Moore nor Ross made much use of\n\u201cbelief\u201d and cognate terms. One can nevertheless make a\nfairly strong case that Moore probably would not have agreed that\nintuitions are beliefs. Ross is more difficult, but there is a strong\ntemptation to interpret him as holding that intuitions are beliefs\nwhen he writes, e.g., that \u201cthe moral convictions of thoughtful\nand well-educated people are the data of ethics\u201d (1930: 41).\nMany who have written about intuitions or intuitionism follow Ross so\ninterpreted, assuming that intuitions are beliefs. Audi follows the\nlead of a number of contemporary writers on intuition (beginning with\nBealer 1998) in recognizing the significance of what Audi calls\n\u201cepisodic intuitions\u201d. Episodic intuitions are\n\u201cintellectual seemings\u2014a phenomenal, attentional sense of\nthe truth of the proposition in question\u201d (Audi 2015: 61). When\nwe have an episodic intuition, we tend to believe the proposition\nintuited. But it is significant that one can have an episodic\nintuition without believing. Bealer illustrated the point with the\nna\u00efve comprehension axiom of set theory. He reports that when he\nconsiders this axiom on its own, it seems true to him. But he does not\nbelieve the axiom, because he knows that it leads to\n paradox.[8]\n Interestingly, the intuition persists in spite of the recognition\nthat the axiom is false. Many people share Bealer\u2019s experience.\nBealer notes that his example is a purely intellectual analog of the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion: In spite of knowing that the lines in the\nillusion are equally long, they continue to\nseem\u2014visually\u2014to have different lengths.\n\nIt follows that episodic intuitions are not beliefs. Some writers hold\nthat episodic intuitions are dispositions or felt dispositions to\nbelieve (see, e.g., Sosa 1998 and Williamson 2007). Others hold that\nepisodic intuitions are sui generis propositional attitudes\n(see, e.g., Bealer 1998 and Huemer 2005). Audi seems to side with\nthose who hold episodic intuitions to be sui generis\npropositional attitudes.\n\nBealer\u2019s example shows that we can have episodic intuitions of\nfalse propositions and propositions that are not self-evident. Audi\nargues that one might adequately understand a self-evident proposition\nand fail to have an episodic intuition of it using as an example the\nproposition that \u201ca child can be borne by its grandmother\u201d\n(2015: 65). He claims that this proposition is self-evident\u2014to\nfigure out why it is true, think of Oedipus Rex\u2014but denies that\nit is intuitive, noting that some people even have an episodic\nintuition of its falsehood.\n\nAudi claims that Ross and other earlier intuitionists realized that\nnot all intuitions had self-evident propositions as their objects. It\nis not obvious that they did, but we cannot pursue the issue. They\ncertainly did not make a sufficient fuss about episodic intuitions to\navoid being widely interpreted as holding that the intuitions\nresponsible for our knowledge of morality are all beliefs in\nself-evident propositions. So Audi at the very least breaks with one\ncommon understanding of the earlier intuitionist position.\n\nEpisodic intuitions are epistemically and methodologically important\nfor Audi. Here is a representative passage: \n\n\nAn episodic intuition, as an experience, does not stand in need of\njustification and may confer it. Like sense experience, it is only a\nfallible indicator of truth; but much as we cannot navigate the\nphysical world without sense experience, we cannot adequately pursue\ntruth in ethics or elsewhere without intuition. (2015: 65) \n\n\nIt is very clear that on the earlier intuitionist view, the\njustification for fundamental moral principles was a priori.\nWhat about Audi\u2019s intuitionism? Since he does allow that some\nmoral principles are self-evident, and that when a person believes\nsuch a self-evident proposition on the basis of adequate\nunderstanding, the person knows, he recognizes a place for a\npriori moral knowledge. But what about beliefs in moral\npropositions that are not self-evident, but are formed on the basis of\nepisodic intuitions? Audi holds such beliefs can be justified, but is\nthe justification a priori? As is indicated by the analogy\nwith sense experience that Audi stresses, episodic intuitions are\ndecidedly experiences. When a belief formed on the basis of an\nepisodic intuition is justified, its justification depends upon the\nexperience and hence is not independent of experience except for the\nexperience necessary to acquire the relevant concepts. One can regard\nsuch beliefs as justified a priori only if one adopts the\nmodified standard view of the a priori, which holds a\npriori knowledge and justification to be independent of\nperceptual, introspective, memorial and all other\nexperiences\u2014except for the experience of rational\nintuition. (For a more recent treatment of these issues, see Audi\n2020.)\n\nIn closing, it is interesting to note that the version of contemporary\nintuitionism defended by Huemer (2005) also pushes one towards the\nmodified standard view. The epistemological side of Huemer\u2019s\nethical intuitionism is a natural outgrowth of his general\nepistemological position, which he calls phenomenological\nconservativism. According to phenomenal conservativism, if it seems to\none that a proposition is true, then one is prima facie\njustified in believing that proposition. Significantly, the specific\nkind of seeming\u2014perceptual, from memory, by reasoning, or\notherwise\u2014is irrelevant to the seeming\u2019s capacity to\njustify. Huemer\u2019s phenomenological conservativism holds that all\nour beliefs are based on how things seem, and hence that unless\nseeming true justifies us in believing, we could not be justified in\nbelieving anything. Phenomenal conservativism drives one to the\nmodified standard view of the a priori because the\nintellectual seeming is what justifies. One might be concerned that\nthe modified standard view understands the distinction between\nrational intuition and all other kinds of seemings to be very\nsignificant epistemically\u2014it is what marks the crucial\ndistinction between the a priori and the empirical\u2014but\nfor phenomenological conservativism it is all just seemings, with no\nkind of seeming playing any different epistemological role from any\nother kind of seeming. One might allay the concern by noting that the\nmodified standard view already admitted a role for experience in a\npriori justification, but distinguished the experience of\nrational intuition or intellectual seeming from all other kinds of\nexperience. Nevertheless, when considering contemporary versions of\nmoral intuitionism, especially when combined with phenomenological\nconservativism, it is hard not to notice that, if intuitive moral\nknowledge as these views conceive it is a priori, then the\noperative conception of the a priori has strayed a\nconsiderable distance from the old root idea of independence from\nexperience.\n",
