First, life satisfaction is holistic, ranging over\nthe whole of one\u2019s life, or the totality of one\u2019s life\nover a certain period of time. It reflects not just the aggregate of\nmoments in one\u2019s life, but also the global quality of\none\u2019s life taken as a whole (but see Raibley 2010). And we seem\nto care not just about the total quantity of good in our lives, but\nabout its distribution\u2014a happy ending, say, counts for more than\na happy middle (Slote 1982, Velleman 1991). Second, life satisfaction\nseems more closely linked to our priorities than affect is,\nas the suffering artist case illustrates. While a focus on affect\nmakes sense insofar as we care about such matters, most people care\nabout other things as well, and how their lives are going relative to\ntheir priorities may not be fully mirrored in their affective states.\nLife satisfaction theories thus seem to fit more closely with liberal\nideals of individual sovereignty, on which how well my life is going\nfor me is for me to decide. My satisfaction with my life seems to\nembody that judgment. Of course a theory of happiness need not capture\neverything that matters for well-being; the point is that a life\nsatisfaction view might explain why we should care so much about\nhappiness, and so enjoy substantive as well as intuitive\n support.[9]\n\nBut several objections have been raised against life satisfaction\nviews. The most common complaint has already been noted, namely that a\nperson could apparently be satisfied with her life even while leading\na highly unpleasant or emotionally distressed existence, and it can\nseem counterintuitive to regard such a person as happy (see section\n2.2). Some life satisfaction theorists deny that such cases are\npossible (Benditt 1978), but it could also be argued that such\npossibilities are part and parcel of life satisfaction\u2019s appeal:\nsome people may not get much pleasure out of life because they\ndon\u2019t care particularly about affective matters, and a life\nsatisfaction theory allows that they can, in their own fashion, be\nhappy.\n\nTwo other objections are more substantive, raising questions about\nwhether life satisfaction has the right sort of importance. One\nconcern is whether people often enough have well-grounded\nattitudes of life satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Evaluating\none\u2019s life as a whole can be a complicated business, and there\nis some question whether people typically have well-defined attitudes\ntoward their lives that accurately reflect how well their lives\nmeasure up relative to their priorities. Some research, for instance,\nsuggests that life satisfaction reports tend to reflect judgments made\non the spot, drawing on whatever information comes readily to mind,\nwith substantial influences by transient contextual factors like the\nweather, finding a dime, etc. (Schwarz and Strack 1999). Debate\npersists over whether this work undermines the significance of life\nsatisfaction judgments, but it does raise a question whether life\nsatisfaction attitudes tend to be well-enough grounded to have the\nkind of importance that people normally ascribe to happiness.\n\nThe third objection is somewhat intricate, so it will require some\nexplaining. The claim is that a wide range of life satisfaction\nattitudes might be consistent with individuals\u2019 perceptions of\nhow well their lives are going relative to what they care about,\nraising doubts about the importance of life satisfaction (Haybron\n2016). You might reasonably be satisfied when\ngetting very little of what you want, or dissatisfied when getting\nmost of what you want. One reason for this is that people tend to have\nmany incommensurable values, leaving it open how to add them up.\nLooking at the various ups and downs of your life, it may be arbitrary\nwhether to rate your life a four out of ten, or a seven. A second\nreason is that life satisfaction attitudes are not merely assessments\nof subjective success or personal welfare: they involve assessments of\nwhether one\u2019s life is good enough\u2014satisfactory.\nYet people\u2019s values may radically underdetermine where they\nshould set the bar for a \u201cgood enough\u201d life, again\nrendering the judgment somewhat arbitrary. Given your values, you\nmight reasonably be satisfied with a two, or require a nine to be\nsatisfied. While it may seem important how well people see their lives\ngoing relative to what they care about, it is not obviously so\nimportant whether people see their lives going well enough that they\nare willing to judge them satisfactory.\n\nIf life satisfaction attitudes are substantially arbitrary relative to\nsubjective success, then people might reasonably base those attitudes\non other factors, such as ethical ideals (e.g., valuing gratitude or\nnoncomplacency) or pragmatic concerns (e.g., comforting oneself).\nShifts in perspective might also reasonably alter life satisfaction\nattitudes. After the funeral, you might be highly satisfied with your\nlife, whereas the high school reunion leaves you dissatisfied; yet\nneither judgment need be mistaken, or less authoritative.\n\nAs a result, life satisfaction attitudes may be poor indicators of\nwell-being, even from the individual\u2019s own point of view. That\npeople in a given country register high levels of life satisfaction\nmay reflect nothing more than that they set the bar extremely low;\nthey might be satisfied with anything short of pure agony. Another\ncountry\u2019s citizens might be dissatisfied with their lives, but\nonly because they set the bar much higher. Relative to what they care\nabout, people in the dissatisfied nation could be better off than\nthose in the satisfied nation. To take another example, a cancer\npatient might be more satisfied with his life than he was before the\ndiagnosis, for he now looks at his life from a different perspective\nand emphasizes different virtues like fortitude and gratitude as\nopposed to (say) humility and non-complacency. Yet he need not think\nhimself better off at all: he might believe himself worse off than he\nwas when he was less satisfied. Neither judgment need seem to him or\nus to be mistaken: it\u2019s just that he now looks at his life\ndifferently. Indeed, he might think he\u2019s doing badly, even as he\nis satisfied with his life: he endorses it, warts and all, and is\ngrateful just have his not-so-good life rather than some of the much\nworse alternatives.\n\nFor present purposes, the worry is that life satisfaction may not have\nthe kind of significance happiness is normally thought to have. This\nmay pose a difficulty for the identification of life satisfaction with\nhappiness: for people frequently seem to use happiness as a proxy for\nwell-being, a reasonably concrete and value-free stand-in that\nfacilitates quick-and-dirty assessments of welfare. Given the\ndiscovery that someone is happy, we might infer that he is doing well;\nif we learn that someone is unhappy, we may conclude that she is doing\npoorly. Such inferences are defeasible: if we later find that the\nhappy Ned\u2019s wife and friends secretly hate him, we need not\ndecide that he isn\u2019t happy after all; we simply withdraw the\nconclusion that he is doing well. So long as happiness tracks\nwell-being well enough in most cases, this sort of practice is\nperfectly respectable. But if we identify happiness with life\nsatisfaction, then we may have a problem: maybe Sally is satisfied\nonly because she values being grateful for the good things in life.\nThis sort of case may not be merely a theoretical possibility: perhaps\nthe very high rates of self-reported life satisfaction in the United\nStates and many other places substantially reflects a broad acceptance\nof norms of gratitude and a general tendency to emphasize the\npositives, or perhaps a sense that not to endorse your life\namounts to a lack of self-regard. It is not implausible that most\npeople, even those enduring great hardship, can readily find grounds\nfor satisfaction with their lives. Life may have to be pretty hard for\na person to be incapable of affirming it.\n\nDespite these concerns there is significant intuitive appeal in the\nidea that to be happy is to be satisfied with one\u2019s life. Perhaps a\ndifferent way of conceiving life satisfaction, for instance dispensing\nwith the global judgment and aggregating particular satisfactions and\ndissatisfactions, would lessen the force of these objections.\nAlternatively, it is possible that idealized or qualified forms of\nlife satisfaction would mitigate these concerns for some purposes,\nsuch as a theory of\n well-being.[10]\n",
