    "main_text": "The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms || The Co-Originality Thesis\n4.2 The Co-Originality Thesis\n\nHabermas\u2019s theory asserts what he calls a co-originality thesis,\nbetween various pairs of political ideas: between the system of rights\nand the principle of democracy; between private/individual and\npublic/political/civic autonomy; between individual rights that secure\nthe former, and popular sovereignty that is the expression of the\nlatter. Co-originality means that both enjoy equal priority, and that\nneither is reducible to each other: they reciprocally call one another\ninto being. The co-originality relations are revealed when the idea of\nself-legislation, namely \u201cthat the addressees of law are\nsimultaneously authors of their rights\u201d is decoded in\ndiscourse-theoretical terms (1992b [1996b: 104, 314, 409]).\n\nThe co-originality thesis has both architectonic significance for\nHabermas\u2019s theory and substantive implications. The\narchitectonic implication is that both the principle of democracy, and\nthe system of rights are derived independently of principle (U). One\nsubstantive implication is, as Ingeborg Maus argues (Maus 1996 [2002:\n90\u201398]), that\n\n\nthe circular process in which the \u2026 legal form, and \u2026\nthe democratic principle\u2014are co-originally constituted\n(1992b [1996b: 122])\n\n\nindicates that basic rights are called into being by the democratic\nprocess and vice versa, in such a way that neither depends on, or is\nexternally constrained by, an antecedently existing order of moral\nrights (pace Larmore 1995) or an ethical form of life\n(pace Bernstein 1996 [1998] & Michelman 1998). The\nco-originality thesis thus expresses Habermas\u2019s view of the\nautonomy of the political (and legal) domain from the moral, and the\nsui generis nature of political legitimacy.\n",
