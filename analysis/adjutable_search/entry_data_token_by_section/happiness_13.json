    "main_text": "The pursuit and promotion of happiness || Normative issues\n5.1 Normative issues\n\nThe last set of questions we will examine centers on the pursuit of\nhappiness, both individual and collective. Most of the popular\nliterature on happiness discusses how to make oneself happier, with\nlittle attention given to whether this is an appropriate goal, or how\nvarious means of pursuing happiness measure up from an ethical\nstandpoint. More broadly, how if at all should one pursue happiness as\npart of a good life?\n\nWe saw earlier that most philosophers regard happiness as secondary to\nmorality in a good life. The individual pursuit of happiness may be\nsubject to nonmoral norms as well, prudence being the most obvious\namong them. Prudential norms need not be as plain as\n\u201cdon\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot.\u201d On\nSumner\u2019s authentic happiness view of well-being, for instance,\nwe stand to gain little by pursuing happiness in inauthentic ways, for\ninstance through self-deception or powerful drugs like Huxley\u2019s\nsoma, which guarantees happiness come what may (Huxley 1932\n[2005]). The view raises interesting questions about the benefits of\nless extreme pharmaceuticals, such as the therapeutic use of\nantidepressants; such medications can make life more pleasant, but\nmany people worry whether they pose a threat to authenticity, perhaps\nundercutting their benefits. It is possible that such drugs involve\nprudential tradeoffs, promoting well-being in some ways while\nundermining it in others; whether the tradeoffs are worth it will\ndepend on how, in a given case, the balance is struck. Another\npossibility is that such drugs sometimes promote\nauthenticity, if for instance a depressive disorder prevents a person\nfrom being \u201chimself.\u201d\n\nLooking to more broadly ethical, but not yet moral, norms, it may be\npossible to act badly without acting either immorally or imprudently.\nWhile Aristotle himself regarded acting badly as inherently imprudent,\nhis catalogue of virtues is instructive, as many of them (wit,\nfriendliness, etc.) are not what we normally regard as moral virtues.\nSome morally permissible methods of pursuing happiness may nonetheless\nbe inappropriate because they conflict with such \u201cethical\u201d\nvirtues. They might, for instance, be undignified or imbecilic.\n\nOutwardly virtuous conduct undertaken in the name of personal\nhappiness might, if wrongly motivated, be incompatible with genuine\nvirtue. One might, for instance, engage in philanthropy solely to make\noneself happier, and indeed work hard at fine-tuning one\u2019s\nassistance to maximize the hedonic payoff. This sort of conduct would\nnot obviously instantiate the virtue of compassion or kindness, and\nindeed might be reasonably deemed contemptible. Similarly, it might be\nadmirable, morally or otherwise, to be grateful for the good things in\none\u2019s life. Yet the virtue of gratitude might be undermined by\ncertain kinds of gratitude intervention, whereby one tries to become\nhappier by focusing on the things one is grateful for. If expressions\nof gratitude become phony or purely instrumental, the sole reason for\ngiving thanks being to become happy\u2014and not that one actually\nhas something to be thankful for\u2014then the\n\u201cgratitude\u201d might cease to be admirable, and may indeed be\nunvirtuous.[30]\n",
