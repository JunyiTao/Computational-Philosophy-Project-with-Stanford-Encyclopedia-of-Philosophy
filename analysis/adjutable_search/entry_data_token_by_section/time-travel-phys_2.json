    "main_text": "The General Possibility of Time Travel in General Relativity\n3. The General Possibility of Time Travel in General Relativity\n\nTime travel has recently been discussed quite extensively in the\ncontext of general relativity. General relativity places few\nconstraints on the global structure of space and time. This\nflexibility leads to a possibility first described in print by Hermann\nWeyl:\n\n\nEvery world-point is the origin of the double-cone of the active\nfuture and the passive past [i.e., the two lobes of the light cone].\nWhereas in the special theory of relativity these two portions are\nseparated by an intervening region, it is certainly possible in the\npresent case [i.e., general relativity] for the cone of the active\nfuture to overlap with that of the passive past; so that, in\nprinciple, it is possible to experience events now that will in part\nbe an effect of my future resolves and actions. Moreover, it is not\nimpossible for a world-line (in particular, that of my body), although\nit has a timelike direction at every point, to return to the\nneighborhood of a point which it has already once passed through.\n(Weyl 1918/1920 [1952: 274])\n\n\nA time-like curve is simply a space-time trajectory such that the\nspeed of light is never equaled or exceeded along this trajectory.\nTime-like curves represent possible trajectories of ordinary objects.\nIn general relativity a curve that is everywhere timelike locally can\nnonetheless loop back on itself, forming a CTC. Weyl makes the point\nvividly in terms of the light cones: along such a curve, the future\nlobe of the light cone (the \u201cactive future\u201d) intersects\nthe past lobe of the light cone (the \u201cpassive past\u201d).\nTraveling along such a curve one would never exceed the speed of\nlight, and yet after a certain amount of (proper) time one would\nreturn to a point in space-time that one previously visited. Or, by\nstaying close to such a CTC, one could come arbitrarily close to a\npoint in space-time that one previously visited. General relativity,\nin a straightforward sense, allows time travel: there appear to be\nmany space-times compatible with the fundamental equations of general\nrelativity in which there are CTC\u2019s. Space-time, for instance,\ncould have a Minkowski metric everywhere, and yet have CTC\u2019s\neverywhere by having the temporal dimension (topologically) rolled up\nas a circle. Or, one can have wormhole connections between different\nparts of space-time which allow one to enter \u201cmouth \\(A\\)\u201d\nof such a wormhole connection, travel through the wormhole, exit the\nwormhole at \u201cmouth \\(B\\)\u201d and re-enter \u201cmouth\n\\(A\\)\u201d again. CTCs can even arise when the spacetime is\ntopologically \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\), due to the \u201ctilting\u201d of\nlight cones produced by rotating matter (as in G\u00f6del 1949\u2019s\nspacetime).\n\nGeneral relativity thus appears to provide ample opportunity for time\ntravel. Note that just because there are CTC\u2019s in a space-time,\nthis does not mean that one can get from any point in the space-time\nto any other point by following some future directed timelike\ncurve\u2014there may be insurmountable practical obstacles. In\nG\u00f6del\u2019s spacetime, it is the case that there are CTCs\npassing through every point in the spacetime. Yet these CTCs are not\ngeodesics, so traversing them requires acceleration. Calculations of\nthe minimal fuel required to travel along the appropriate curve should\ndiscourage any would-be time travelers (Malament 1984, 1985; Manchak\n2011). But more generally CTCs may be confined to smaller regions;\nsome parts of space-time can have CTC\u2019s while other parts do\nnot. Let us call the part of a space-time that has CTC\u2019s the\n\u201ctime travel region\u201d of that space-time, while calling the\nrest of that space-time the \u201cnormal region\u201d. More\nprecisely, the \u201ctime travel region\u201d consists of all the\nspace-time points \\(p\\) such that there exists a (non-zero length)\ntimelike curve that starts at \\(p\\) and returns to \\(p\\). Now let us\nturn to examining space-times with CTC\u2019s a bit more closely for\npotential problems.\n",
