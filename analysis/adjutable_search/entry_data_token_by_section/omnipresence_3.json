    "main_text": "The World as God\u2019s Body\n4. The World as God\u2019s Body\n\nAs we have seen, Hartshorne explicitly endorses as a consequence of\nthe doctrine of divine omnipresence that the world is God\u2019s\nbody, and Swinburne is initially willing to accept a \u201climited\nembodiment.\u201d But some philosophers have been loath to accept\ndivine embodiment as a consequence of omnipresence. Charles\nTaliaferro, for example, while endorsing this overall account of\nomnipresence, notes that the basic actions human beings perform\n\u201ccan involve highly complex physical factors\u2026[including]\nmany neural events and muscle movements, whereas with God there is no\nsuch physical complexity\u201d (Taliaferro, 1994). Taliaferro then\nadds that this immediacy in the case of God\u2019s action is\nprecisely a reason to say that \u201cthe world does not function as\nGod\u2019s body the way material bodies function as our own.\u201d\nEdward Wierenga adds a second objection. He holds that as Hartshorne\nand Swinburne develop accounts of God\u2019s power and knowledge, God\nwould have the same knowledge of and control over what happens in\nempty regions of space as he does with respect to those regions\noccupied by material objects (Wierenga, 2010). In other words,\nHartshorne\u2019s and Swinburne\u2019s accounts of omnipresence,\nunlike that of Aquinas, do not interpret God\u2019s presence as\npresence in things. But it would be implausible to count a\nthing as part of God\u2019s body on the basis of his knowledge of and\npower over the region of space that thing occupies, when God\u2019s\nknowledge and power would extend in the same way to that region if it\nwere unoccupied. So it seems as though one could accept a version of\nthe traditional account of divine omnipresence without having to\nconclude that the world is God\u2019s body.\n",
