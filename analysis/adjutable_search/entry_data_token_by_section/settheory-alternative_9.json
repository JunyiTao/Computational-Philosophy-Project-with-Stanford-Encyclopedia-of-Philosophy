    "main_text": "Zermelo Set Theory and Its Refinements || Critique of Zermelo set theory\n4.3 Critique of Zermelo set theory\n\nA common criticism of Zermelo set theory is that it is an ad\nhoc selection of axioms chosen to avoid paradox, and we have no\nreason to believe that it actually achieves this end. We believe such\nobjections to be unfounded, for two reasons. The first is that the\ntheory of types (which is the result of a principled single\nmodification of naive set theory) is easily shown to be precisely\nequivalent in consistency strength and expressive power to Z\nwith the restriction that all quantifiers in the formulas \\(\\phi\\) in\ninstances of separation must be bounded in a set; this casts doubt on\nthe idea that the choice of axioms in Z is particularly\narbitrary. The fact that the von Neumann-G\u00f6del-Bernays class\ntheory (discussed below) turns out to be a conservative extension of\nZFC suggests that full ZFC is a precise formulation\nof Cantor\u2019s ideas about the Absolute Infinite (and so not\narbitrary). Further, the introduction of the Foundation Axiom\nidentifies the set theories of this class as the theories of a\nparticular class of structures (the well-founded sets) of which the\nZermelo axioms certainly seem to hold (whether Replacement holds so\nevidently is another matter).\n\nThese theories are frequently extended with large cardinal axioms (the\nexistence of inaccessible cardinals, Mahlo cardinals, weakly compact\ncardinals, measurable cardinals and so forth). These do not to us\nsignal a new kind of set theory, but represent answers to the question\nas to how large the universe of Zermelo-style set theory is.\n\nThe choice of Zermelo set theory (leaving aside whether one goes on to\nZFC) rules out the use of equivalence classes of equinumerous\nsets as cardinals (and so the use of the Frege natural numbers) or the\nuse of equivalence classes of well-orderings as ordinals. There is no\ndifficulty with the use of the Dedekind cut formulation of the reals\n(once the rationals have been introduced). Instead of the equivalence\nclass formulations of cardinal and ordinal numbers, the von\nNeumann ordinals are used: a von Neumann ordinal is a transitive\nset (all of its elements are among its subsets) which is well-ordered\nby membership. The order type of a well-ordering is the von Neumann\nordinal of the same length (the axiom of Replacement is needed to\nprove that every set well-ordering has an order type; this can fail to\nbe true in Zermelo set theory, where the von Neumann ordinal \\(\\omega\n+ \\omega\\) cannot be proven to exist but there are certainly\nwell-orderings of this and longer types). The cardinal number \\(|A|\\)\nis defined as the smallest order type of a well-ordering of \\(A\\)\n(this requires Choice to work; without choice, we can use Foundation\nto define the cardinal of a set \\(A\\) as the set of all sets\nequinumerous with \\(A\\) and belonging to the first \\(V_{\\alpha}\\)\ncontaining sets equinumerous with \\(A)\\). This is one respect in which\nCantor\u2019s ideas do not agree with the modern conception; he\nappears to have thought that he could define at least cardinal numbers\nas equivalence classes (or at least that is one way to interpret what\nhe says), although such equivalence classes would of course be\nAbsolutely Infinite.\n",
