It begins with the evolution of an early but\nfragile form of psychological altruism among hominins in the context\nof \u201ccoalition games\u201d in mixed adult groups. The social\nstructure would have been similar to that of contemporary chimpanzees\nand bonobos, where cooperation among the relatively weak (or those in\nweak stages of life) is beneficial to them, but strategic calculation\nis infeasible. These conditions may have led from simpler forms of\nbiological altruism developed through kin selection to the evolution\nof a psychological altruistic disposition involving \u201ca blind\ntendency to respond to the preferences of another animal with whom you\nmight engage in cooperative activity,\u201d as a simple but effective\nmechanism for promoting advantageous participation in coalitions and\nsubcoalitions (Kitcher 2006b). (This is the\n\u2018indiscriminate\u2019 altruism discussed in the previous\nsub-section.)\n\nBecause this disposition was both limited and unstable, however, and\ncompeted with powerful selfish drives, there was a continual threat of\nsocial rupture and loss of cooperative advantage. This in turn would\nhave made ongoing peacemaking a necessity, thus limiting the size of\nviable cooperative units and the scope of cooperative projects, as\nwell as imposing significant costs through the devotion of time and\nenergy to peacemaking activities. An example would be extensive mutual\ngrooming going well beyond what is necessary for hygiene, of the sort\nfound in chimpanzee societies.\n\nThe next phase, according to this hypothesis, was a transition to much\nlarger groups with more extensive cooperative activities, through the\nevolution of a capacity for emotionally laden normative\nguidance, without which such arrangements would not have been\npossible. (See also Gibbard 1990, ch. 4.) With the emergence of a\ncapacity to make and follow normative judgments, reinforced by\ncoevolved reactive emotions such as guilt and resentment, and the\ndevelopment of rules and social practices promoting and enforcing\ngroup loyalty and cooperation, a new psychological mechanism came into\nbeing for reinforcing the previously unstable altruistic tendencies\nand promoting large-scale social cohesion and stability. The\nadvantages of membership in coalitions and subcoalitions would be\nconferred on hominins who had facility with such normative\nguidance\u2014including a strong sense of obligation and tendency\ntoward social compliance\u2014and who thus acted consistently on\nthese altruistic tendencies, acquiring the reputation for being good\ncoalition partners and participating in a broader array of cooperative\nprojects.\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, it might explain not only the origins\nof our general capacity for normative judgment and motivation, but\nalso the widespread tendency for social rules or norms historically to\nemphasize such things as group identity, loyalty and\ncohesion, and to focus largely on the regulation of\nviolence and sex; and it might help to explain\nwidespread dispositions toward social conformity, concern with\nreputation and social standing, tendencies for group-wise scorning or\npunishment of the disloyal, and the power of emotions such as\nresentment, guilt and shame.\n\nIn the final phase, this sort of \u201cproto-morality\u201d of norms\nand reactive emotions would then be supplemented over thousands of\nyears with various paths of\n cultural evolution,\n leading to the development and fleshing out of the much more\nsophisticated systems of moral beliefs, practices and institutions\nwith which we are familiar, from the earliest historical examples\nright up to our present moral cultures (Kitcher 2006a, 2011). There\nis, of course, a great deal of leeway in the last part, concerning the\ndetails of the transition through cultural evolution from hominin\nproto-moralities to contemporary moral systems, which allows for some\nvery different possible stories. Some accounts will attribute great\ninfluence to evolved, \u201cdomain-specific psychological\nmodules\u201d (such as a dedicated mechanism that automatically\ngenerates a feeling of concern when confronted with suffering) in\nshaping the content of our moral feeling, judgment and behavior, both\nthrough shaping our cultures and more directly; other accounts, while\nnot denying some such influence, will emphasize very different factors\nas influencing the content of at least some of our moral beliefs (such\nas the \u201ccapacity for open-ended normativity\u201d cited by\nBuchanan and Powell 2015, 2018, 2019). This brings us to the next\nmajor topic.\n",
