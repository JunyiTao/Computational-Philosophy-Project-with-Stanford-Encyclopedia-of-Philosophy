    "main_text": "Psychology\n8. Other Sciences: History, Physical Geography, and Anthropology\n\nThough Kant is sometimes quite strict about what qualifies as science\n\u201cproper,\u201d we have seen that he clearly accepts that other\ndisciplines, such as chemistry and psychology, can be scientific in\nsome other sense. (Kant is also extremely interested in providing an\nexplanation of the nature and origin of organisms, which is central to\nan account of biology. For a more detailed description of Kant\u2019s\nstance on biology, see the entry on his views on aesthetics and\nteleology.) However, his explicit reflections about science (taken\nbroadly so as to encompass not only\n\u201cWissenschaft\u201d but any kind of\n\u201cLehre\u201d or \u201cKunde\u201d) extend\neven further so as to include bodies of cognition such as history,\nphysical geography, and anthropology. (Even in the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant leaves room for such \u201cscientific\ncognition\u201d by dividing the doctrine of nature into natural\nscience \u2014 e.g., physics \u2014 and the historical doctrine of\nnature, which is separated further into natural description and\nnatural history, 4:468). In the case of historical sciences, Kant\nviews its cognitions as related not by subordination (as is the case\nin physics), but rather by coordination, since historical facts cannot\nbe derived from each other, but rather merely related to each other in\nspace (geographically) and time (chronologically). Kant views\nanthropology as overlapping to some extent in subject matter with\nempirical psychology. What enables the coordination of facts in each\nof these domains is not a theoretical, but rather a practical idea. In\nthe case of history, it is the idea of reason (or freedom) that\nprovides a guiding principle of coordination (cf. Kant\u2019s\n\u201cIdea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of\nView\u201d), while anthropology is framed by the cosmopolitan moral\nideal of the world-best. Thus, it is clear that Kant\u2019s emphasis\non physics throughout his career did not blind him to the value of\nother sciences, nor did it keep him from reflecting creatively on how\nbest to account for them from the perspective of his Critical\nphilosophy.\n\nKant\u2019s views on history are discussed by Yovel (1980) and, more\nrecently, Kleingeld (1995 and 1999). Kant\u2019s Physical\nGeography has been discussed by Adickes (1911). Brandt (1999),\nWood (1999), and Makkreel (2001) have recently published important\ndiscussions of Kant\u2019s anthropology. Sturm (2009) is a\ncomprehensive monograph on Kant\u2019s philosophy of psychology and\nanthropology.\n",
