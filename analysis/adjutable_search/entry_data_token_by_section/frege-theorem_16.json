    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Analysis of Cardinal Numbers || Derivation of Hume\u2019s Principle\n3.4 Derivation of Hume\u2019s Principle\n\nFrege\u2019s derivations of Hume\u2019s Principle were invalidated\nby the fact that it appeals to the inconsistent Basic Law V.\nNeverthelss, we briefly describe in this subsection, for interested\nreaders, Frege\u2019s derivations. In Gl, \u00a773,\nFrege sketches an informal proof of the right-to-left direction of\nHume\u2019s Principle using the above informal definition of the\nnumber of \\(F\\)s. The derivation appeals to the fact that a concept\n\\(G\\) is a member of the extension of the second-level concept\nconcept equinumerous to F if and only if \\(G\\) is\nequinumerous to \\(F\\). In other words, the proof relies on a kind of\nhigher-order version of the Law of Extensions (described above), the\nordinary version of which we know to be a consequence of Basic Law\n V.[9]\n Here is a reconstruction of Frege\u2019s proof in\nGl, \u00a773, extended so as to cover both directions\nof Hume\u2019s Principle.\n\nReconstruction of the Grundlagen Derivation of Hume\u2019s Principle\n\n\nHowever, in the development of Gg, Frege didn\u2019t\nformulate the extensions of second-level concepts. In Gg,\nextensions do not contain concepts as members but rather\nobjects. So Frege had to find another way to express the explicit\ndefinition described in the previous subsection. His technique was to\nlet extensions go proxy for their corresponding concepts. Since a full\nreconstruction of this technique and the proof of Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple in Gg would constitute a digression for the\npresent exposition, we shall describe the details for interested\nreaders in a separate document: \n\nReconstruction of the Grundgesetze \u2018Derivation\u2019 of Hume\u2019s Principle\n\n\nInterestingly, Tennant (2004) and May & Wehmeier (2019)\npoint out that in Gg, Frege does not, in actual fact, derive\nHume\u2019s Principle as a biconditional. Instead, he derives both\ndirections separately without combining them or indicating that the\ntwo directions should be conceived as a biconditional. Finally, as\nnoted on several occasions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V\ninvalidated Frege\u2019s derivation of Hume\u2019s Principle. But\nHume\u2019s Principle, in and of itself, is a powerful and consistent\nprinciple.\n",
