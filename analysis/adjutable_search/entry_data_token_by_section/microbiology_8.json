The Long Reach of Microbiome Research\n\nA recent microbiology topic of growing interest for philosophers is\nmicrobiome research, which examines all the microbial communities\nliving in host organisms. In humans, the gut microbiome in particular\nis associated with many health and disease states experienced by the\nhost, including mental health. There are two foci of philosophical\nattention given to these heterogeneous microbial consortia in host\nsystems, namely individuality (e.g., Skillings 2016) and causality,\nspecifically the causal role large mixed communities of microbes might\nplay in host health (Lynch et al. 2019). \n",
