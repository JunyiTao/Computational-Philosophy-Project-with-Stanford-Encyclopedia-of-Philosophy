    "main_text": "Natural Law\n3. Natural Law\n\nToday natural law theory offers the most common intellectual defense\nfor differential treatment of gays and lesbians, and as such it merits\nattention. The development of natural law is a long and very\ncomplicated story. A reasonable place to begin is with the dialogues\nof Plato, for this is where some of the central ideas are first\narticulated, and, significantly enough, are immediately applied to the\nsexual domain. For the Sophists, the human world is a realm of\nconvention and change, rather than of unchanging moral truth. Plato,\nin contrast, argued that unchanging truths underpin the flux of the\nmaterial world. Reality, including eternal moral truths, is a matter\nof phusis. Even though there is clearly a great degree of\nvariety in conventions from one city to another (something ancient\nGreeks became increasingly aware of), there is still an unwritten\nstandard, or law, that humans should live under.\n\nIn the Laws, Plato applies the idea of a fixed, natural law\nto sex, and takes a much harsher line than he does in the\nSymposium or the Phraedrus. In Book One he writes\nabout how opposite-sex sex acts cause pleasure by nature, while\nsame-sex sexuality is \u201cunnatural\u201d (636c). In Book Eight,\nthe Athenian speaker considers how to have legislation banning\nhomosexual acts, masturbation, and illegitimate procreative sex widely\naccepted. He then states that this law is according to nature\n(838\u2013839d). Probably the best way of understanding Plato\u2019s\ndiscussion here is in the context of his overall concerns with the\nappetitive part of the soul and how best to control it. Plato clearly\nsees same-sex passions as especially strong, and hence particularly\nproblematic, although in the Symposium that erotic attraction\nis presented as potentially being a catalyst for a life of philosophy,\nrather than base sensuality (Cf. Dover, 1989, 153\u2013170; Nussbaum,\n1999, esp. chapter 12).\n\nOther figures played important roles in the development of natural law\ntheory. Aristotle, with his emphasis upon reason as the distinctive\nhuman function, and the Stoics, with their emphasis upon human beings\nas a part of the natural order of the cosmos, both helped to shape the\nnatural law perspective which says that \u201cTrue law is right\nreason in agreement with nature,\u201d as Cicero put it. Aristotle,\nin his approach, did allow for change to occur according to nature,\nand therefore the way that natural law is embodied could itself change\nwith time, which was an idea Aquinas later incorporated into his own\nnatural law theory. Aristotle did not write extensively about sexual\nissues, since he was less concerned with the appetites than Plato.\nProbably the best reconstruction of his views places him in mainstream\nGreek society as outlined above; his main concern is with an active\nversus a passive role, with only the latter problematic for those who\neither are or will become citizens. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism,\nwas, according to his contemporaries, only attracted to men, and his\nthought did not have prohibitions against same-sex sexuality. In\ncontrast, Cicero, a later Stoic, was dismissive about sexuality in\ngeneral, with some harsher remarks towards same-sex pursuits (Cicero,\n1966, 407-415).\n\nThe most influential formulation of natural law theory was made by\nThomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. Integrating an Aristotelian\napproach with Christian theology, Aquinas emphasized the centrality of\ncertain human goods, including marriage and procreation. While Aquinas\ndid not write much about same-sex sexual relations, he did write at\nlength about various sex acts as sins. For Aquinas, sexuality that was\nwithin the bounds of marriage and which helped to further\nwhat he saw as the distinctive goods of marriage, mainly love,\ncompanionship, and legitimate offspring, was permissible, and even\ngood. Aquinas did not argue that procreation was a necessary part of\nmoral or just sex; married couples could enjoy sex without the motive\nof having children, and sex in marriages where one or both partners is\nsterile (perhaps because the woman is postmenopausal) is also\npotentially just (given a motive of expressing love). So far\nAquinas\u2019 view actually need not rule out homosexual sex. For\nexample, a Thomist could embrace same-sex marriage, and then apply the\nsame reasoning, simply seeing the couple as a reproductively sterile,\nyet still fully loving and companionate union.\n\nAquinas, in a significant move, adds a requirement that for any given\nsex act to be moral it must be of a generative kind. The only way that\nthis can be achieved is via vaginal intercourse. That is, since only\nthe emission of semen in a vagina can result in natural reproduction,\nonly sex acts of that type are generative, even if a given sex act\ndoes not lead to reproduction, and even if it is impossible due to\ninfertility. The consequence of this addition is to rule out the\npossibility, of course, that homosexual sex could ever be moral (even\nif done within a loving marriage), in addition to forbidding any\nnon-vaginal sex for opposite-sex married couples. What is the\njustification for this important addition? This question is made all\nthe more pressing in that Aquinas does allow that how broad moral\nrules apply to individuals may vary considerably, since the nature of\npersons also varies to some extent. That is, since Aquinas allows that\nindividual natures vary, one could simply argue that one is, by\nnature, emotionally and physically attracted to persons of one\u2019s\nown gender, and hence to pursue same-sex relationships is\n\u2018natural\u2019 (Sullivan, 1995). Unfortunately, Aquinas does\nnot spell out a justification for this generative requirement.\n\nMore recent natural law theorists, however, have presented a couple of\ndifferent lines of defense for Aquinas\u2019 \u2018generative\ntype\u2019 requirement. The first is that sex acts that involve\neither homosexuality, heterosexual sodomy, or which use contraception,\nfrustrate the purpose of the sex organs, which is reproductive. This\nargument, often called the \u2018perverted faculty argument\u2019,\nis perhaps implicit in Aquinas. It has, however, come in for sharp\nattack (see Weitham, 1997), and the best recent defenders of a\nThomistic natural law approach are attempting to move beyond it (e.g.,\nGeorge, 1999a, dismisses the argument). If their arguments fail, of\ncourse, they must allow that some homosexual sex acts are morally\npermissible (even positively good), although they would still have\nresources with which to argue against casual gay (and straight)\nsex.\n\nAlthough the specifics of the second sort of argument offered by\nvarious contemporary natural law theorists vary, they possess common\nelements(Finnis, 1994; George, 1999a). As Thomists, their argument\nrests largely upon an account of human goods. The two most important\nfor the argument against homosexual sex (though not against\nhomosexuality as an orientation which is not acted upon, and hence in\nthis they follow official Catholic doctrine; see George, 1999a, ch.15)\nare personal integration and marriage. Personal integration, in this\nview, is the idea that humans, as agents, need to have integration\nbetween their intentions as agents and their embodied selves. Thus, to\nuse one\u2019s or another\u2019s body as a mere means to one\u2019s\nown pleasure, as they argue happens with masturbation, causes\n\u2018dis-integration\u2019 of the self. That is, one\u2019s\nintention then is just to use a body (one\u2019s own or\nanother\u2019s) as a mere means to the end of pleasure, and this\ndetracts from personal integration. Yet one could easily reply that\ntwo persons of the same sex engaging in sexual union does not\nnecessarily imply any sort of \u2018use\u2019 of the other as a mere\nmeans to one\u2019s own pleasure. Hence, natural law theorists\nrespond that sexual union in the context of the realization of\nmarriage as an important human good is the only permissible expression\nof sexuality. Yet this argument requires drawing how marriage is an\nimportant good in a very particular way, since it puts procreation at\nthe center of marriage as its \u201cnatural fulfillment\u201d\n(George, 1999a, 168). Natural law theorists, if they want to support\ntheir objection to homosexual sex, have to emphasize procreation. If,\nfor example, they were to place love and mutual support for human\nflourishing at the center, it is clear that many same-sex couples\nwould meet this standard. Hence their sexual acts would be morally\njust.\n\nThere are, however, several objections that are made against this\naccount of marriage as a central human good. One is that by placing\nprocreation as the \u2018natural fulfillment\u2019 of marriage,\nsterile marriages are thereby denigrated. Sex in an opposite-sex\nmarriage where the partners know that one or both of them are sterile\nis not done for procreation. Yet surely it is not wrong. Why, then, is\nhomosexual sex in the same context (a long-term companionate union)\nwrong (Macedo, 1995)? The natural law rejoinder is that while vaginal\nintercourse is a potentially procreative sex act, considered in itself\n(though admitting the possibility that it may be impossible for a\nparticular couple), oral and anal sex acts are never potentially\nprocreative, whether heterosexual or homosexual (George, 1999a). But\nis this biological distinction also morally relevant, and in the\nmanner that natural law theorists assume? Natural law theorists, in\ntheir discussions of these issues, seem to waver. On the one hand,\nthey want to defend an ideal of marriage as a loving union wherein two\npersons are committed to their mutual flourishing, and where sex is a\ncomplement to that ideal. Yet that opens the possibility of\npermissible gay sex, or heterosexual sodomy, both of which they want\nto oppose. So they then defend an account of sexuality which seems\ncrudely reductive, emphasizing procreation to the point where\nliterally a male orgasm anywhere except in the vagina of one\u2019s\nloving spouse is impermissible. Then, when accused of being reductive,\nthey move back to the broader ideal of marriage.\n\nNatural law theory, at present, has made significant concessions to\nmainstream liberal thought. In contrast certainly to its medieval\nformulation, most contemporary natural law theorists argue for limited\ngovernmental power, and do not believe that the state has an interest\nin attempting to prevent all moral wrongdoing. Still, most proponents\nof the \u201cNew Natural Law Theory\u201d do argue against\nhomosexuality, and against legal protections for gays and lesbians in\nterms of employment and housing, even to the point of serving as\nexpert witnesses in court cases or helping in the writing of\namicus curae briefs. They also argue against same sex\nmarriage (Bradley, 2001; George, 1999b). There have been some\nattempts, however, to reconcile natural law theory and homosexuality\n(see, for example, Lago, 2018; Goldstein, 2011). While maintaining the\ncentral aspects of natural law theory and its account of basic human\ngoods, they typically either argue that marriage itself is not a basic\ngood (Lago), or that the sort of good it is, when understood in a less\nnarrow, dogmatic fashion, is such that same-sex couples can enjoy it.\nPart of the theoretical interest in these arguments is that they allow\nfor a moral evaluation of sexuality, still requiring it to realize the\nbasic good of friendship if it is to be permissible, while avoiding\nwhat seem to be the various problematic aspects of contemporary\nnatural law theorists\u2019 denigration of same-sex sexuality in any\nform.\n",
