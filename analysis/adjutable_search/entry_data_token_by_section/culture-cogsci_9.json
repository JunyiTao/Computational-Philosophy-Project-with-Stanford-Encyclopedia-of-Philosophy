    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Cultural Capacities || Culture and Social Transmission\n3.3 Culture and Social Transmission\n\nSome researchers have expressed surprise that social learning is\nthought to be so crucial for understanding what is distinctive about\nhumans, especially in light of its apparent ubiquity in the animal\n(and even botanical) world (Hill 2010). Similar concerns have led some\ntheorists to distinguish what they call \u2018cultural\nlearning\u2019, holding it to be a form of social learning that\nessentially involves fairly sophisticated forms of cognition like\nperspective-taking or intersubjectivity (Tomasello, Kruger, &\nRatner 1993, also see Hoppit & Laland 2013; Legare & Nielsen\n2015; J. Henrich 2016). The term \u201csocial transmission\u201d\nremains useful, however, as it is neutral on this score. It is also\nintuitively inclusive of psychological capacities for learning but\nalso for teaching, both of which support the flow of cultural\ninformation between individuals and generations (also see Heyes &\nMoore forthcoming).\n\nSome of the most fruitful research into the psychology of social\ntransmission has been comparative, investigating the similarities in\nand differences between the cultural capacities of humans and those\nfound a wide range of other animals (Andrews 2020b: chapter 8). Much\nof this research is structured by efforts to isolate and understand\n\u201cdifference makers\u201d (Buskell forthcoming; Charbonneau\n2020), those ecological, social, and especially psychological factors\nthat are distinctive of humans and responsible for our unique cultural\nsophistication. Here too a central debate involves the issue of\ncumulative culture and the kind of psychological machinery\nrequired not just to socially acquire and transmit information, but\nfor it to accumulate over time, enabling each generation to innovate\nand build on the advances inherited from previous generations (Dean et\nal. 2014; Mesoudi & Thorton 2018; cf. Querbes, Vaesen, &\nHoukes 2014; Haidle & Schlaudt 2020; Vale et al. 2021). It has\nbeen known for some time that other animals have the wherewithal to\nsustain group-specific behavioral traditions (Buxton 1948; Imanishi\n1957; Whiten, Goodall, et al. 1999; Laland & Galef 2009; for\noverviews of more recent work see Whitehead & Rendell 2015; Aplin\n2019; Whiten 2019). However, it remains unclear whether any of those\ntraditions accrue complexity and adaptive functionality in the same\nway their human counterparts do, or what additional cultural\ncapacities would be necessary or sufficient to enable groups of\nnon-human animals to collectively achieve this \u201crachet\neffect\u201d of accumulation (Tomasello 2009, 2014; Tennie , Call,\n& Tomasello 2009).\n\nMuch of this comparative work is also guided by hypotheses about the\nkinds of evolutionary pressures that selected for uniquely human\ncultural capacities and drove the dramatic expansion of relative brain\nsize in the human lineage. For instance, one framing (Baimel et al.\n2021; also see Muthukrishna, Doebeli, et al. 2018) pits this family of\n\u201ccultural brain\u201d hypotheses that focus on the adaptive\nchallenges associated with social learning and handling cultural\ninformation against \u201cMachiavellian intelligence\u201d\nhypotheses (Byrne & Whiten 1988 and Whiten & Byrne 1997).\nThese latter hypotheses see key selective pressures as stemming not\nfrom culture but from more competitive social dynamics that arise from\nantagonistic scheming among conspecifics (cf. Downes 2008 [2021];\nLewens 2008 [2020]). Another view holds that many of our particular\ncultural capacities are the product of cultural rather than biological\nevolution, cognitive gadgets that are assembled and passed along as\npart of a cultural inheritance rather than a genetic one (Heyes\n2018a). On this account, what is unique about human brains is that\nthey are innately equipped with a set of cognitive mechanisms for\nassociative learning that are hypertrophied compared to other species,\nbut are not genetically specialized for any particular domain or\ncontent. These general learning mechanisms, together with some number\nof attentional biases, are often used to acquire all manner of\nculturally inherited, domain-specific packages of skills, e.g., to\nplay chess, to drive a car, to read and write, etc. These may also\ninclude skills that allow individuals to imitate others more adeptly,\nthus allowing them to learn to become better and more selective social\nlearners (also see Dennett 2017).\n\nAs this and above discussions suggest, much effort has been directed\nat distinguishing different grades of social learning and the kinds of\ncognitive sophistication required to engage in each. The disagreements\nbetween the participants seem to be mainly about the number and nature\nof genetically transmitted learning mechanisms, and how canalized the\ndevelopment of different types of social learning is. Of the different\nmechanisms, imitation, understood as the ability of an individual to\nobserve and then copy another\u2019s body movements, has attracted\nthe most attention (Zentall 2006; Whiten et al. 2009). A key debate\nconcerns whether imitation in particular is underpinned by genetically\ninherited, domain specific psychological mechanisms, or whether it is\nsubserved by domain general associative learning mechanisms that are\nthemselves further sculpted by cultural influences (Heyes 2016a, 2021;\ncf. Fessler & Machery 2012). A related debate concerns the\nsignificance of over-imitation, the tendency of humans to\ncopy all of the steps in the arc of a model\u2019s behavior,\neven those that are superfluous to the perceived goal (Lyons et al.\n2011; Keupp, Behne, & Rakoczy 2013; Clay & Tennie 2018; Hoehl\net al. 2019). Researchers disagree about whether over-imitation is a\nmistake, produced by a generally adaptive capacity for social learning\nmerely overreaching and exhibiting predictable false positives in\ncertain circumstances, or whether it is a key to the human capacity to\nsupport not just culture but cumulative culture. An influential\nhypothesis about how it might do this is by driving the reproduction\nand spread of cultural traditions that are so complex that the\nadaptive benefits they provide are causally opaque to and\nunappreciated by their users (J. Henrich 2016).\n\nAnother debate is over the importance of imitation relative to other\nforms of social learning, both to the transmission and accumulation of\nculture (Caldwell & Millen 2009; Singh et al. 2021) and to the\nmore creative forms of acquisition of interest to cultural\nepidemiologists (Sperber 1996; Boyer 2001; Nichols 2004; Morin 2011\n[2016]). This issue has attracted the attention of philosophers in\npart because it intersects with those conceptual issues about fidelity\nand replication mentioned in\n Section 3.1.\n Thus, empirical findings in the cognitive science of imitation stand\nto shed light on conceptual questions about if and when the cultural\nvariants that spread via social transmission can serve as units of\nselection in cultural evolution, in something analogous to the\nway that genes serve as units of selection in genetic evolution, in\nvirtue of the fact that they can be replicated with high levels of\nfidelity (R. Boyd & Richerson 2000; J. Henrich & Boyd 2002;\nClaidi\u00e8re, Scott-Phillips, & Sperber 2014; Acerbi &\nMesoudi 2015; Boudry 2018; Charbonneau 2020; Charbonneau & Bourrat\n2021; also see Lloyd 2005 [2020]; Wilkins & Bourrat 2018\n[2020]).\n\nA related line of research explores the ways in which imitation and\nsocial learning are selective, guided by strategies and heuristics\nthat dispose individuals to acquire some the behaviors, skills, and\nideas they are exposed to rather than others (Laland 2004; Chudek,\nBrosseau-Liard, et al. 2013; Koenig & Sabbagh 2013; Heyes 2016b;\nKendal, Boogert, et al. 2018). Many different strategies have been\nexplored, and those have been taxonomized in a variety of ways (see J.\nHenrich & McElreath 2007). Some of the most discussed types of\nstrategies include a conformity heuristic that induces\nindividuals to copy behaviors and ideas that are already common in\ntheir community (Muthukrishna, Morgan, & Henrich 2016);\nsensitivities to status and success that make one\nmore likely to copy prestigious, dominant, successful, or otherwise\nhigh-ranking individuals (J. Henrich & Gil-White 2001; Cheng,\nTracy, et al. 2013; Cheng & Tracy 2014; Maner 2017, Jim\u00e9nez\n& Mesoudi 2019, 2021), and sensitivities to the similarities or\ndifferences between oneself and those one might learn from, sometimes\ndiscussed in terms of my-side bias (Mercier & Sperber\n2017) or tribal social instincts (Richerson & Boyd 2001;\nRicherson & Henrich 2012). Though they are often called\n\u201cbiases\u201d and lead to what can appear to be reasoning\nerrors when evaluated in isolated episodes of learning, modeling work\nsuggests that when such heuristics are prevalent in a population they\ncan collectively produce results that are beneficial, both for the\nindividuals whose social learning they are guiding and for the\ncultural repertoire of the group those individuals belong to\n(Richerson & Boyd 2005; see also Skyrms 2014). Recent\nphilosophical work has taken up the question of whether or not these\nkinds of selective social learning heuristics can be assimilated to\ntraditional perspectives on rationality and epistemic virtue (N. Levy\n& Alfano 2020; Fadda 2021). Other philosophical research has\ncritically examined the explanatory work done by appeal to such\nheuristics, and looked at how these biases relate to different forms\nof social influence (Padalia 2014; Chellappoo 2021).\n\nWhen social learning is important for the members of a species, it is\nnot unreasonable to expect there to be complementary psychological\nmechanisms that guide and facilitate teaching. In humans,\nresearchers have investigated the propensity to engage in what has\nbeen called \u2018natural pedagogy\u2019 (Csibra & Gergely 2006;\nGergely, Egyed, & Kir\u00e1ly 2007, but see Little, Carver,\n& Legare 2016). For example, some of this work looks at\ncomplementary patterns of attention and eye contact that emerge in\npedagogical settings, and the psychological mechanisms that support a\ncomplex interaction between the ostensive signals that teachers\nprovide for their students and the referential expectations that\nlearners have of their teachers (Csibra & Gergely 2009; cf. Heyes\n2018b). Other researchers who focus on human mentalizing capacities\napproach their subject matter from a broadly pedagogy-centered\nperspective, developing a general reinterpretation of those\ncapacities\u2019 basic functions. On this mindshaping view, the\nmechanisms that underpin human folk psychological practices are not\ndesigned to merely passively interpret others\u2019 behavior; rather,\nthey primarily evolved to help (co)construct and regulate the minds of\nothers. They thus guide many pedagogical tasks involved in actively\nhelping to structure and influence the minds of learners (Mameli 2001;\nMcGeer 2007, 2015; Zawidzki 2013). Others have argued that human\npedagogy is both active and deeply facilitated not just by internal\npsychological mechanisms, but by meticulously structured learning\nenvironments\u2014the cumulative epistemic niches\u2014that are a\ncrucial part of the non-biological inheritance that one generation\nuses to educate the next. These include engineered physical\nenvironments (Clark 1997a), but also norms that govern relationships\nbetween apprentices and their mentors (Sterelny 2012) which can scale\nup into larger informal and formal institutions of education (Gillett\n2018). Others have explored ways in which the psychological machinery\nof learning and teaching contributes to the generation, intentional or\notherwise, of innovations in cultural variants, and thus to\nthe production of variation on which cultural evolution operates\n(Claidi\u00e8re, Scott-Phillips, & Sperber 2014; Legare &\nNielsen 2015; Mesoudi 2016; Laland 2017; Leibo et al. 2019; Gopnik\n2020; Miu et al. 2020; Rule, Tenenbaum, & Piantadosi 2020).\n\nWhile the psychological mechanisms underlying social transmission are\nwidely thought to play a foundational role, other cognitive abilities\nhave been put forward as additional candidates for being key\ndifference makers that allow human minds to produce and sustain unique\nforms of complex cumulative culture. Though the exact character of\ntheir respective contributions remains unclear, some prominent\ncandidates include: novel and more powerful forms of memory (Donald\n1991, 2007; Carruthers 2015), especially for particular sequences of\nactions (Ghirlanda, Lind, & Enquist 2017; Milne, Wilson, &\nChristiansen 2018; Petkov & Cate 2020); imagination and mental\ntime travel (Suddendorf & Corballis 2007; Dor 2015, 2017; Fuentes\n2017); analogical thinking (Brand, Mesoudi, & Hewlett 2021);\nmetacognition (Heyes 2016b; Dunstone & Caldwell 2018; also see\nHeyes, Bang, et al. 2020); mindreading (Carruthers 2013; Heyes &\nFrith 2014; Moore 2021; cf. McGeer 2007; Zawidzki 2013); social\ntolerance brought about by self-domestication (J. Henrich 2016; Hare\n2017; Wrangham 2019); shared intentionality (Tomasello, Carpenter, et\nal. 2005; Tomasello & Moll 2010); norm psychology (Chudek &\nHenrich 2011; R. Boyd 2017; Davis & Kelly 2018; cf. Andrews 2020a;\nFitzpatrick 2020; also see Kelly & Setman 2020); resolve (Ainslie\n2021; Setman & Kelly 2021); natural language (Ross 2007; Tamariz\n& Kirby 2016; Dennett 2017: chapter 9; Sterelny 2020); narrative\n(Scalise Sugiyama 2001, 2017; B. Boyd 2009; Sterelny 2012); reasoning\n(Pinker 2010; Mercier & Sperber 2011, 2017); and various tool and\ntechnological proficiencies (Vaesen 2012; A. Schulz forthcoming; Birch\n2021; cf. Osiurak & Reynaud 2020).\n\nFaced with this proliferation of options, several theorists have\nespoused \u201cno magic bullet\u201d positions, holding that there\nis unlikely to be any single, crucial psychological advance that will\nturn out to be the pivotal cognitive ingredient needed for\ncumulative culture. Rather, they argue, the gap between human and\nnon-human capacities for culture will likely flow from small changes\nand minor increases in the functionality of several psychological\nmechanisms that are shared between species, along with new\ninteractions that emerge between those and with other ecological and\nsocial factors (Sterelny 2012; J. Henrich 2016; Laland & Seed\n2021; also see Ross 2019).\n",
