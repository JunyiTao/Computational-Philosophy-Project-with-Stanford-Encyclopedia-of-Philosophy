    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || Utility\n2.1 Utility\n\nAn economic agent is, by definition, an entity with\npreferences. Game theorists, like economists and philosophers\nwho study practical choice, describe these by means of an abstract\nconcept called utility. This refers to some ranking, on some\nspecified scale, of the subjective welfare or change in subjective\nwelfare that an agent derives from an event. By \u2018welfare\u2019\nwe refer to some normative index of relative alignment between states\nof the world and agents\u2019 valuations of the states in question,\njustified by reference to some background framework. For example, we\nmight evaluate the relative welfare of countries (which we might model\nas agents for some purposes) by reference to their per capita incomes,\nand we might evaluate the relative welfare of an animal, in the\ncontext of predicting and explaining its behavioral dispositions, by\nreference to its expected evolutionary fitness. In the case of people,\nit is most typical in economics and applications of game theory to\nevaluate their relative welfare by reference to their own implicit or\nexplicit judgments of it. This is why we referred above to\nsubjective welfare. Consider a person who adores the taste of\npickles but dislikes onions. She might be said to associate higher\nutility with states of the world in which, all else being equal, she\nconsumes more pickles and fewer onions than with states in which she\nconsumes more onions and fewer pickles. Examples of this kind suggest\nthat \u2018utility\u2019 denotes a measure of subjective\npsychological fulfillment, and this is indeed how the concept\nwas originally interpreted by economists and philosophers influenced\nby the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. However, economists in the\nearly 20th century recognized increasingly clearly that their main\ninterest was in the market property of decreasing marginal demand,\nregardless of whether that was produced by satiated individual\nconsumers or by some other factors. In the 1930s this motivation of\neconomists fit comfortably with the dominance of behaviourism and\nradical empiricism in psychology and in the philosophy of science\nrespectively. Behaviourists and radical empiricists objected to the\ntheoretical use of such unobservable entities as \u2018psychological\nfulfillment quotients.\u2019 The intellectual climate was thus\nreceptive to the efforts of the economist Paul Samuelson\n (1938)\n to redefine utility in such a way that it becomes a purely technical\nconcept rather than one rooted in speculative psychology. Since\nSamuelson\u2019s redefinition became standard in the 1950s, when we\nsay that an agent acts so as to maximize her utility, we mean by\n\u2018utility\u2019 simply whatever it is that the agent\u2019s\nbehavior suggests her to consistently act so as to make more probable.\nIf this looks circular to you, it should: theorists who follow\nSamuelson intend the statement \u2018agents act so as to\nmaximize their utility\u2019 as a tautology, where an\n\u2018(economic) agent\u2019 is any entity that can be accurately\ndescribed as acting to maximize a utility function, an\n\u2018action\u2019 is any utility-maximizing selection from a set of\npossible alternatives, and a\u2018utility function\u2019 is what an\neconomic agent maximizes. Like other tautologies occurring in the\nfoundations of scientific theories, this interlocking (recursive)\nsystem of definitions is useful not in itself, but because it helps to\nfix our contexts of inquiry.\n\nThough the behaviourism of the 1930s has since been displaced by\nwidespread interest in cognitive processes, many theorists continue to\nfollow Samuelson\u2019s way of understanding utility because they\nthink it important that game theory apply to any kind of\nagent\u2014a person, a bear, a bee, a firm or a country\u2014and not\njust to agents with human minds. When such theorists say that agents\nact so as to maximize their utility, they want this to be part of the\ndefinition of what it is to be an agent, not an empirical\nclaim about possible inner states and motivations. Samuelson\u2019s\nconception of utility, defined by way of Revealed Preference\nTheory (RPT) introduced in his classic paper\n (Samuelson (1938))\n satisfies this demand.\n\nEconomists and others who interpret game theory in terms of RPT should\nnot think of game theory as an empirical account of the motivations of\nsome flesh-and-blood actors (such as actual people). Rather, they\nshould regard game theory as part of the body of mathematics that is\nused to model those entities who consistently select elements from\nmutually exclusive action sets, resulting in patterns of choices,\nwhich, allowing for some stochasticity and noise, can be statistically\nmodeled as maximization of utility functions. On this interpretation,\ngame theory could not be refuted by any empirical observations, since\nit is not an empirical theory in the first place. Of course,\nobservation and experience could lead someone favoring this\ninterpretation to conclude that game theory is of little help\nin describing actual human behavior.\n\nSome other theorists understand the point of game theory differently.\nThey view game theory as providing an explanatory account of actual\nhuman strategic reasoning processes. For this idea to be applicable,\nwe must suppose that agents at least sometimes do what they do in\nnon-parametric settings because game-theoretic logic\nrecommends certain actions as the \u2018rational\u2019 ones. Such an\nunderstanding of game theory incorporates a normative aspect,\nsince \u2018rationality\u2019 is taken to denote a property that an\nagent should at least generally want to have. These two very general\nways of thinking about the possible uses of game theory are compatible\nwith the tautological interpretation of utility maximization. The\nphilosophical difference is not idle from the perspective of the\nworking game theorist, however. As we will see in a later section,\nthose who hope to use game theory to explain strategic\nreasoning, as opposed to merely strategic behavior,\nface some special philosophical and practical problems.\n\nSince game theory is a technology for formal modeling, we must have a\ndevice for thinking of utility maximization in mathematical terms.\nSuch a device is called a utility function. We will introduce\nthe general idea of a utility function through the special case of an\nordinal utility function. (Later, we will encounter utility\nfunctions that incorporate more information.) The utility-map for an\nagent is called a \u2018function\u2019 because it maps ordered\npreferences onto the real numbers. Suppose that agent \\(x\\)\nprefers bundle \\(a\\) to bundle \\(b\\) and bundle \\(b\\) to bundle \\(c\\).\nWe then map these onto a list of numbers, where the function maps the\nhighest-ranked bundle onto the largest number in the list, the\nsecond-highest-ranked bundle onto the next-largest number in the list,\nand so on, thus: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{bundle } a &\\gg 3 \\\\\n\\text{bundle } b &\\gg 2 \\\\\n\\text{bundle } c &\\gg 1\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe only property mapped by this function is order. The\nmagnitudes of the numbers are irrelevant; that is, it must not be\ninferred that \\(x\\) gets 3 times as much utility from bundle \\(a\\) as\nshe gets from bundle \\(c\\). Thus we could represent exactly the\nsame utility function as that above by  \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{bundle } a &\\gg 7,326 \\\\\n\\text{bundle } b &\\gg 12.6 \\\\\n\\text{bundle } c &\\gg -1,000,000\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe numbers featuring in an ordinal utility function are thus not\nmeasuring any quantity of anything. A utility-function in\nwhich magnitudes do matter is called \u2018cardinal\u2019.\nWhenever someone refers to a utility function without specifying which\nkind is meant, you should assume that it\u2019s ordinal. These are\nthe sorts we\u2019ll need for the first set of games we\u2019ll\nexamine. Later, when we come to seeing how to solve games that involve\n(ex ante) uncertainty\u2014our river-crossing game from Part\n1 above, for example\u2014we\u2019ll need to build cardinal utility\nfunctions. The technique for doing this was given by\n von Neumann & Morgenstern (1944),\n and was an essential aspect of their invention of game theory. For\nthe moment, however, we will need only ordinal functions.\n",
