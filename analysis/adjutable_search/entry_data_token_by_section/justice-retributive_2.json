    "main_text": "Background Concepts || Punishment\n2.1 Punishment\n\nThe entry  on legal punishment \ndiscusses this concept in depth. The following discussion surveys five\nelements of punishment that are central for the purpose of\nunderstanding retributivism.\n\nFirst, punishment must impose some sort of cost or hardship on, or at\nthe very least withdraw a benefit that would otherwise be enjoyed by,\nthe person being punished. This is often denoted \u201chard\ntreatment\u201d.\n\nSecond, the punisher must inflict hard treatment intentionally, not as\nan accident, and not as a side-effect of pursuing some other end. For\nexample, while sending a criminal to prison often has foreseeable\nharmful effects on the criminal's family, retributivists would say\nthat those harms do not constitute punishment, not unless they are\npurposely inflicted as part of the punishment for the crime.\n\nSome critics of retributivism reject this limitation as an appeal to a\n\u201cdefinitional stop\u201d, which they say is illicitly used to\navoid having to justify the costs of the practice (Hart 1968:\n5\u20136; Christopher 2002: 879\u2013880). The worry is that\nretributivists will seek to justify only the purposeful infliction of\nhardship on wrongdoers, and will ignore the overall costs of the\npractice. But there is no reason to think that retributivists\ngenerally ignore the need to justify the negative effects of\npunishment on the innocent (see\n section 4.5).\n The retributivist's point is only that the intentional infliction of\nhard treatment has to be justified in a different way than the\ncollateral damage that may befall either the criminal or the innocent\nas a result of punishing the former.\n\nThird, the hardship or loss must be imposed in response to an act or\nomission. It is a confusion to take oneself to be\n\u201cpunishing\u201d others for some facts over which they had no\ncontrol (Mabbott 1939). One need not be conceptually confused to take\noneself to have reason to intentionally inflict hard treatment on\nothers because of some trait that they cannot help having. One might\nwant to oppress others on the basis of some trait they cannot help\nhaving, such as their ethnicity or physical appearance. Doing so would\npresumably be immoral, but it need not be conceptually confused. What\nwould be confused is thinking that one is inflicting\n\u201cpunishment\u201d. (It is, however, not a confusion to punish\none person more harshly than another on the basis of traits over which\nthey have no control.)\n\nFourth, the act or omission ought to be wrongful. One can make sense\nof punishing another for an act that is not wrong (see Tadros 2016:\nch. 17; Cornford 2017). But as a normative matter, if not a conceptual\nmatter, such punishment is to be avoided if possible. (For arguments\nthat it is possible for a well-developed legal system to generally or\nalways avoid knowingly punishing acts that are not wrongful, see Duff\n2018: chs. 2 and 7; Walen forthcoming).\n\nFifth, it is best to think of the hard treatment as imposed, at least\nin part, as a way of sending a message of condemnation or censure for\nwhat is believed to be a wrongful act or omission (Feinberg 1970; for\na retributive theorist who rejects this element, see Berman 2012:\n143). This element too is a normative matter, not a conceptual one.\nOne can certainly make sense of punishment that is simply a response\nto wrongful or unwanted behavior\u2014a response aimed at deterring\nsuch behavior or simply imposing suffering for a wrong done. But\ninsofar as one thinks of punishment as aimed at moral agents, there is\nreason to use it to communicate to wrongdoers (and to victims of their\nwrongdoing as well as potential future wrongdoers) that their wrongful\nacts or omissions are indeed wrongful and that the hard treatment that\nthey receive is a morally justified response to their wrongdoing (Duff\n2018: 295).\n",
