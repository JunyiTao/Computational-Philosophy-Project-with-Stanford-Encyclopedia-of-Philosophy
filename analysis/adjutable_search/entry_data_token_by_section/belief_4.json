    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Eliminativism, Instrumentalism, and Fictionalism\n1.5 Eliminativism, Instrumentalism, and Fictionalism\n\nSome philosophers have denied the existence of beliefs altogether.\nAdvocates of this view, generally known as eliminativism,\ninclude Churchland (1981), Stich (in his 1983 book; he subsequently\nmoderated his opinion), and Jenson (2016). On this view,\npeople\u2019s everyday conception of the mind, their \u201cfolk\npsychology\u201d, is a theory on par with folk theories about the\norigin of the universe or the nature of physical bodies. And just as\nour pre-scientific theories on the latter topics were shown to be\nradically wrong by scientific cosmology and physics, so also will folk\npsychology, which is essentially still pre-scientific, be overthrown\nby scientific psychology and neuroscience once they have advanced far\nenough. According to eliminativism, once folk psychology is\noverthrown, strict scientific usage will have no place for reference\nto most of the entities postulated by folk psychology, such as belief.\nBeliefs, then, like \u201ccelestial spheres\u201d or\n\u201cphlogiston\u201d, will be judged not actually to exist, but\nrather to be the mistaken posits of a radically false theory. We may\nstill find it convenient to speak of \u201cbelief\u201d in informal\ncontexts, if scientific usage is cumbersome, much as we still speak of\n\u201cthe sun going down\u201d, but if the concept of belief does\nnot map onto the categories described by a mature scientific\nunderstanding of the mind, then, literally speaking, no one believes\nanything. For further discussion of eliminativism and the\nconsiderations for and against it, see the entry on\n eliminative materialism.\n\nInstrumentalists about belief regard belief attributions as\nuseful for certain purposes, but hold that there are no definite\nunderlying facts about what people really believe, or that beliefs are\nnot robustly real, or that belief attributions are never in the\nstrictest sense true. One sort of instrumentalism\u2014what we might\ncall hard instrumentalism\u2014denies that beliefs exist in\nany sense. Hard instrumentalism is thus a form of eliminativism,\nconjoined with the thesis that belief-talk is nonetheless\ninstrumentally useful (e.g., Quine 1960, p. 221 [but for a caveat see\np. 262\u2013266]). Another type of instrumentalism, which we might\ncall soft instrumentalism, grants that beliefs are real, but\nonly in a less robust sense than is ordinarily thought. Dennett (1991)\narticulates a view of this sort. Consider as an analogy: Is the\nequator real? Well, not in the sense that there\u2019s a red stripe\nrunning through the Congo; but saying that a country is on the equator\nsays something true about its position relative to other countries and\nhow it travels on the spinning Earth. Are beliefs real? Well, not\nperhaps in the sense of being representations stored somewhere in the\nmind; but attributing a belief to someone says something true about\nthat person\u2019s patterns of behavior and response. Beliefs are as\nreal as equators, or centers of gravity, or the average Canadian. The\nsoft instrumentalist holds that such things are not robustly\nreal\u2014not as real as mountains or masses or individual, actual\nCanadians. They are in some sense inventions that capture something\nuseful in the structure of more robustly real phenomena. Soft\ninstrumentalism in this sense comports naturally with approaches to\nbelief such as dispositionalism and interpretationism, to the extent\nthose positions treat belief attribution simply as a convenient means\nof pointing toward certain patterns in a subject\u2019s real and\nhypothetical behavior (see also Poslajko 2022).\n\nSimilarly to instrumentalism, fictionalism treats belief\nattribution practices as potentially useful while downplaying or\ndenying the real existence of the attributed beliefs (Demeter, Parent,\nand Toon, eds., 2022). Instrumentalism and fictionalism are not\nincompatible. However, fictionalism emphasizes the resemblance between\nbelief attribution and fictional storytelling, while instrumentalism\nemphasizes the resemblance to devising a predictively successful\nscientific instrument or model.\n",
