    "preamble": "\n\nWell-being is most commonly used in philosophy to describe what is\nnon-instrumentally or ultimately good for a person. The\nquestion of what well-being consists in is of independent interest,\nbut it is of great importance in moral philosophy, especially in the\ncase of utilitarianism, according to which the only moral requirement\nis that well-being be maximized. Significant challenges to the very\nnotion have been mounted, in particular by G.E. Moore and T.M.\nScanlon. It has become standard to distinguish theories of well-being\nas either hedonist theories, desire theories, or objective list\ntheories. According to the view known as welfarism, well-being is the\nonly value. Also important in ethics is the question of how a\nperson\u2019s moral character and actions relate to their\nwell-being.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Concept\n\nPopular use of the term \u2018well-being\u2019 usually relates to\nhealth. A doctor\u2019s surgery may run a \u2018Women\u2019s\nWell-being Clinic\u2019, for example. Philosophical use is broader,\nbut related, and amounts to the notion of how well a person\u2019s\nlife is going for that person. A person\u2019s well-being is what is\n\u2018good for\u2019 them. Health, then, might be said to be a\nconstituent of my well-being, but it is not plausibly taken to be all\nthat matters for my well-being. One correlate term worth noting here\nis \u2018self-interest\u2019: my self-interest is what is in the\ninterest of myself, and not others.\n\nThe philosophical use of the term also tends to encompass the\n\u2018negative\u2019 aspects of how a person\u2019s life goes for\nthem. So we may speak of the well-being of someone who is, and will\nremain in, the most terrible agony: their well-being is negative, and\nsuch that their life is worse for them than no life at all. The same\nis true of closely allied terms, such as \u2018welfare\u2019, which\ncovers how a person is faring as a whole, whether well or badly, or\n\u2018happiness\u2019, which can be understood\u2014as it sometimes\nwas by the classical utilitarians from Jeremy Bentham onwards, for\nexample\u2014to be the balance between good and bad things in a\nperson\u2019s life. But note that philosophers also use such terms in\nthe more standard \u2018positive\u2019 way, speaking of\n\u2018ill-being\u2019, \u2018ill-faring\u2019, or, of course,\n\u2018unhappiness\u2019 to capture the negative aspects of\nindividuals\u2019 lives. Most philosophical discussion has been of\n\u2018goods\u2019 rather than \u2018bads\u2019, but recently more\ninterest has been shown in the latter (e.g. Kagan 2015; Bradford\n2021).\n\n\u2018Happiness\u2019 is often used, in ordinary life, to refer to a\nshort-lived state of a person, frequently a feeling of contentment:\n\u2018You look happy today\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m very happy for\nyou\u2019. Philosophically, its scope is more often wider,\nencompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak\nof the happiness of a person\u2019s life, or of their happy life,\neven if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is\nthat some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though\nthey lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause\nconfusion.\n\nOver the last few decades, so-called \u2018positive psychology\u2019\nhas hugely increased the attention paid by psychologists and other\nscientists to the notion of \u2018happiness\u2019. Such happiness is\nusually understood in terms of contentment or\n\u2018life-satisfaction\u2019, and is measured by means such as\nself-reports or daily questionnaires. Is positive psychology about\nwell-being? As yet, conceptual distinctions are not sufficiently clear\nwithin the discipline. But it is probably fair to say that many of\nthose involved, as researchers or as subjects, are assuming that\none\u2019s life goes well to the extent that one is contented with\nit\u2014that is, that some kind of hedonistic account of well-being\nis correct. Some positive psychologists, however, explicitly reject\nhedonistic theories in preference to Aristotelian or\n\u2018eudaimonist\u2019 accounts of well-being, which are a version\nof the \u2018objective list\u2019 theory of well-being discussed\nbelow. A leader in the field, Martin Seligman, for example, has\nsuggested that, rather than happiness, positive psychology should\nconcern itself with positive emotion, engagement, relationships,\nmeaning and accomplishment (\u2018Perma\u2019) (Seligman 2011).\n\nWhen discussing the notion of what makes life good for the individual\nliving that life, it is preferable to use the term\n\u2018well-being\u2019 instead of \u2018happiness\u2019. For we\nwant at least to allow conceptual space for the possibility that, for\nexample, the life of a plant may be \u2018good for\u2019 that plant.\nAnd speaking of the happiness of a plant would be stretching language\ntoo far. (An alternative here might be \u2018flourishing\u2019,\nthough this might be taken to bias the analysis of human well-being in\nthe direction of some kind of natural teleology.) In that respect, the\nGreek word commonly translated \u2018happiness\u2019\n(eudaimonia) might be thought to be superior. But, in fact,\neudaimonia seems to have been restricted not only to\nconscious beings, but to human beings: non-human animals cannot be\neudaimon. This is because eudaimonia suggests that\nthe gods, or fortune, have favoured one, and the idea that the gods\ncould care about non-humans would not have occurred to most\nGreeks.\n\nIt is occasionally claimed that certain ancient ethical theories, such\nas Aristotle\u2019s, result in the collapse of the very notion of\nwell-being. On Aristotle\u2019s view, if you are my friend, then my\nwell-being is closely bound up with yours. It might be tempting, then,\nto say that \u2018your\u2019 well-being is \u2018part\u2019 of\nmine, in which case the distinction between what is good for me and\nwhat is good for others has broken down. But this temptation should be\nresisted. Your well-being concerns how well your life goes for you,\nand we can allow that my well-being depends on yours without\nintroducing the confusing notion that my well-being is constituted by\nyours. There are signs in Aristotelian thought of an expansion of the\nsubject or owner of well-being. A friend is \u2018another\nself\u2019, so that what benefits my friend benefits me. But this\nshould be taken either as a metaphorical expression of the dependence\nclaim, or as an identity claim which does not threaten the notion of\nwell-being: if you really are the same person as I am, then of course\nwhat is good for you will be what is good for me, since there is no\nlonger any metaphysically significant distinction between you and\nme.\n\nWell-being is a kind of value, sometimes called \u2018prudential\nvalue\u2019, to be distinguished from, for example, aesthetic value\nor moral value. What marks it out is the notion of \u2018good\nfor\u2019. The serenity of a Vermeer painting, for instance, is a\nkind of goodness, but it is not \u2018good for\u2019 the painting.\nIt may be good for us to contemplate such serenity, but contemplating\nserenity is not the same as the serenity itself. Likewise, my giving\nmoney to a development charity may have moral value, that is, be\nmorally good. And the effects of my donation may be good for others.\nBut it remains an open question whether my being morally good is good\nfor me; and, if it is, its being good for me is still conceptually\ndistinct from its being morally good. A great deal of attention\nhas been paid in philosophy to the issue of moral\n\u2018normativity\u2019, less so to that of prudential normativity\n(recent exceptions are Dorsey 2021; Fletcher 2021).\n\nThe most common view of well-being is \u2018invariabilism\u2019,\naccording to which there is a single account of well-being for all\nindividuals for whom life can go well or badly (Lin 2018). Some have\nargued, however, that we should develop a variabilist view, according\nto which, for example, there might be one theory of well-being for\nadults and another for children (see Skelton 2015). According to\nBenatar (2006), existence for any individual with well-being is always\nof overall negative value. On well-being and death, see Bradley\n(2006).\n2. Moore\u2019s Challenge\n\nThere is something mysterious about the notion of \u2018good\nfor\u2019. Consider a possible world that contains only a single\nitem: a stunning Vermeer painting. Leave aside any doubts you might\nhave about whether paintings can be good in a world without viewers,\nand accept for the sake of argument that this painting has aesthetic\nvalue in that world. It seems intuitively plausible to claim that the\nvalue of this world is constituted solely by the aesthetic value of\nthe painting. But now consider a world which contains one individual\nliving a life that is good for them. How are we to describe the\nrelationship between the value of this world, and the value of the\nlife lived in it for the individual? Are we to say that the world has\na value at all? How can it, if the only value it contains is\n\u2018good for\u2019 as opposed to just \u2018good\u2019? And yet\nwe surely do want to say that this world is better (\u2018more\ngood\u2019) than some other empty world. Well, should we say that the\nworld is good, and is so because of the good it contains\n\u2018for\u2019 the individual? This fails to capture the idea that\nthere is in fact nothing of value in this world except what is good\nfor the individual.\n\nThoughts such as these led G.E. Moore to object to the very idea of\n\u2018good for\u2019 (Moore 1903, pp. 98\u20139). Moore argued that\nthe idea of \u2018my own good\u2019, which he saw as equivalent to\nwhat is \u2018good for me\u2019, makes no sense. When I speak of,\nsay, pleasure as what is good for me, he claimed, I can mean only\neither that the pleasure I get is good, or that my getting it is good.\nNothing is added by saying that the pleasure constitutes my good, or\nis good for me.\n\nBut the distinctions I drew between different categories of value\nabove show that Moore\u2019s analysis of the claim that my own good\nconsists in pleasure is too narrow. Indeed Moore\u2019s argument\nrests on the very assumption that it seeks to prove: that only the\nnotion of \u2018good\u2019 is necessary to make all the evaluative\njudgements we might wish to make. The claim that it is good that I get\npleasure is, logically speaking, equivalent to the claim that the\nworld containing the single Vermeer is good. It is, so to speak,\n\u2018impersonal\u2019, and leaves out of account the special\nfeature of the value of well-being: that it is good for\nindividuals.\n\nOne way to respond both to Moore\u2019s challenge, and to the puzzles\nabove, is to try, when appropriate, to do without the notion of\n\u2018good\u2019 (see Kraut 2011) and make do with \u2018good\nfor\u2019, alongside the separate and non-evaluative notion of\nreasons for action. Thus, the world containing the single individual\nwith a life worth living, might be said to contain nothing good\nper se, but a life that is good for that individual. And this\nfact may give us a reason to bring about such a world, given the\nopportunity.\n3. Scanlon\u2019s Challenge\n\nMoore\u2019s book was published in Cambridge, England, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the same century, a\nbook was published in Cambridge, Mass., which also posed some serious\nchallenges to the notion of well-being: What Do We Owe to Each\nOther?, by T.M. Scanlon.\n\nMoore\u2019s ultimate aim in criticizing the idea of \u2018goodness\nfor\u2019 was to attack egoism. Likewise, Scanlon has an ulterior\nmotive in objecting to the notion of well-being\u2014to attack\nso-called \u2018teleological\u2019 or end-based theories of ethics,\nin particular, utilitarianism, which in its standard form requires us\nto maximize well-being. But in both cases the critiques stand\nindependently.\n\nOne immediately odd aspect of Scanlon\u2019s position that\n\u2018well-being\u2019 is an otiose notion in ethics is that he\nhimself seems to have a view on what well-being is. It involves, he\nbelieves, among other things, success in one\u2019s rational aims,\nand personal relations. But Scanlon claims that his view is not a\n\u2018theory of well-being\u2019, since a theory must explain what\nunifies these different elements, and how they are to be compared.\nAnd, he adds, no such theory is ever likely to be available, since\nsuch matters depend so much on context.\n\nScanlon does, however, implicitly make a claim about what unites these\nvalues: they are all constituents of well-being, as opposed to other\nkinds of value, such as aesthetic or moral. Nor is it clear why\nScanlon\u2019s view of well-being could not be developed so as to\nassist in making real-life choices between different values in\none\u2019s own life.\n\nScanlon suggests that we often make claims about what is good in our\nlives without referring to the notion of well-being, and indeed that\nit would often be odd to do so. For example, I might say, \u2018I\nlisten to Alison Krauss\u2019s music because I enjoy it\u2019, and\nthat will be sufficient. I do not need to go on to say, \u2018And\nenjoyment adds to my well-being\u2019.\n\nBut this latter claim sounds peculiar only because we already\nknow that enjoyment makes a person\u2019s life better for\nthem. And in some circumstances such a claim would anyway not be odd:\nconsider an argument with someone who claims that aesthetic experience\nis worthless, or with an ascetic. Further, people do use the notion of\nwell-being in practical thinking. For example, if I am given the\nopportunity to achieve something significant, which will involve\nconsiderable discomfort over several years, I may consider whether,\nfrom the point of view of my own well-being, the project is worth\npursuing.\n\nScanlon argues also that the notion of well-being, if it is to be\nphilosophically acceptable, ought to provide a \u2018sphere of\ncompensation\u2019\u2014a context in which it makes sense to say,\nfor example, that I am losing one good in my life for the sake of gain\nover my life as a whole. And, he claims, there is no such sphere. For\nScanlon, giving up present comfort for the sake of future health\n\u2018feels like a sacrifice\u2019.\n\nBut this does not chime with my own experience. When I donate blood,\nthis feels to me like a sacrifice, albeit a minor one. But when I\nvisit the dentist, it feels to me just as if I am weighing present\npains against potential future pains. And we can weigh different\ncomponents of well-being against one another. Consider a case in which\nyou are offered a job which is highly paid but many miles away from\nyour friends and family.\n\nScanlon denies that we need an account of well-being to understand\nbenevolence, since we do not have a general duty of benevolence, but\nmerely duties to benefit others in specific ways, such as to relieve\ntheir pain. But, from the philosophical perspective, it may be quite\nuseful to use the heading of \u2018benevolence\u2019 in order to\ngroup such duties. And, again, comparisons may be important: if I have\nseveral pro tanto duties of benevolence, not all of which can\nbe fulfilled, I shall have to weigh the various benefits I can provide\nagainst one another. And here the notion of well-being will again come\ninto play.\n\nFurther, if morality includes so-called \u2018imperfect\u2019 duties\nto benefit others, that is, duties that allow the agent some\ndiscretion as to when and how to assist, the lack of any overarching\nconception of well-being is likely to make the fulfillment of such\nduties problematic.\n4. Theories of Well-being\n4.1 Hedonism\n\nOn one view, human beings always act in pursuit of what they think\nwill give them the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. This is\n\u2018psychological hedonism\u2019, and will not be my concern here.\nRather, I intend to discuss \u2018evaluative hedonism\u2019 or\n\u2018prudential hedonism\u2019, according to which well-being\nconsists in the greatest balance of pleasure over pain.\n\nThis view was first, and perhaps most famously, expressed by Socrates\nand Protagoras in the Platonic dialogue, Protagoras (Plato\n1976 [C4 BCE], 351b\u2013c). Jeremy Bentham, one of the most\nwell-known of the more recent hedonists, begins his Introduction\nto the Principles of Morals and Legislation thus: \u2018Nature\nhas placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters,\npain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out\nwhat we ought to do\u2019.\n\nIn answer to the question, \u2018What does well-being consist\nin?\u2019, then, the hedonist will answer, \u2018The greatest\nbalance of pleasure over pain\u2019. We might call this\nsubstantive hedonism. A complete hedonist position will\ninvolve also explanatory hedonism, which consists in an\nanswer to the following question: \u2018What makes pleasure\ngood, and pain bad?\u2019, that answer being, \u2018The pleasantness\nof pleasure, and the painfulness of pain\u2019. Consider a\nsubstantive hedonist who believed that what makes pleasure good for us\nis that it fulfills our nature. This theorist is not an explanatory\nhedonist.\n\nHedonism\u2014as is demonstrated by its ancient roots\u2014has long\nseemed an obviously plausible view. Well-being, what is good\nfor me, might be thought to be naturally linked to what seems\ngood to me, and pleasure does, to most people, seem good. And\nhow could anything else benefit me except in so far as I enjoy\nit? \n\nThe simplest form of hedonism is Bentham\u2019s, according to which\nthe more pleasantness one can pack into one\u2019s life, the better\nit will be, and the more painfulness one encounters, the worse it will\nbe. How do we measure the value of the two experiences? The two\ncentral aspects of the respective experiences, according to Bentham,\nare their duration, and their intensity.\n\nBentham tended to think of pleasure and pain as a kind of sensation,\nas the notion of intensity might suggest. One problem with this kind\nof hedonism, it has often been claimed, is that there does not appear\nto be a single common strand of pleasantness running through all the\ndifferent experiences people enjoy, such as eating hamburgers, reading\nShakespeare, or playing water polo. Rather, it seems, there are\ncertain experiences we want to continue, and we might be prepared to\ncall these\u2014for philosophical purposes\u2014pleasures (even\nthough some of them, such as diving in a very deep and narrow cave,\nfor example, would not normally be described as pleasurable).\n\nHedonism could survive this objection merely by incorporating whatever\nview of pleasure was thought to be plausible. A more serious objection\nis to the evaluative stance of hedonism itself. Thomas Carlyle, for\nexample, described the hedonistic component of utilitarianism as the\n\u2018philosophy of swine\u2019, the point being that simple\nhedonism places all pleasures on a par, whether they be the lowest\nanimal pleasures of sex or the highest of aesthetic appreciation. One\nmight make this point with a thought experiment. Imagine that you are\ngiven the choice of living a very fulfilling human life, or that of a\nbarely sentient oyster, which experiences some very low-level\npleasure. Imagine also that the life of the oyster can be as long as\nyou like, whereas the human life will be of eighty years only. If\nBentham were right, there would have to be a length of oyster life\nsuch that you would choose it in preference to the human. And yet many\nsay that they would choose the human life in preference to an oyster\nlife of any length.\n\nNow this is not a knockdown argument against simple hedonism. Indeed\nsome people are ready to accept that at some length or other the\noyster life becomes preferable. But there is an alternative to simple\nhedonism, outlined famously by J.S. Mill, using his distinction\n(itself influenced by Plato\u2019s discussion of pleasure at the end\nof his Republic (Plato 1992 [C4 BCE], 582d-583a)) between\n\u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 pleasures (1863 [1998],\nch. 2). Mill added a third property to the two determinants of value\nidentified by Bentham, duration and intensity. To distinguish it from\nthese two \u2018quantitative\u2019 properties, Mill called his third\nproperty \u2018quality\u2019. The claim is that some pleasures, by\ntheir very nature, are more valuable than others. For example, the\npleasure of reading Shakespeare, by its very nature, is more valuable\nthan any amount of basic animal pleasure. And we can see this, Mill\nsuggests, if we note that those who have experienced both types, and\nare \u2018competent judges\u2019, will make their choices on this\nbasis.\n\nA long-standing objection to Mill\u2019s move here has been to claim\nthat his position can no longer be described as hedonism proper (or\nwhat I have called \u2018explanatory hedonism\u2019). If higher\npleasures are higher because of their nature, that aspect of their\nnature cannot be pleasantness, since that could be determined by\nduration and intensity alone. And Mill anyway speaks of properties\nsuch as \u2018nobility\u2019 as adding to the value of a pleasure.\nNow it has to be admitted that Mill is sailing close to the wind here.\nBut there is logical space for a hedonist position which allows\nproperties such as nobility to determine pleasantness, and insists\nthat only pleasantness determines value. But one might well wonder how\nnobility could affect pleasantness, and why Mill did not just come out\nwith the idea that nobility is itself a good-making property.\n\nAbove I noted the plausibility of the claim that nothing can benefit\nme if I don\u2019t enjoy it. Some non-hedonists have denied this,\nwhile accepting the so-called \u2018experience requirement\u2019 on\nwell-being. They suggest that what matters is valuable\nconsciousness, and consciousness can be valuable for non-hedonic\nreasons (see Kraut 2018; Kriegel 2019). But there is a yet more weighty\nobjection both to hedonism and to the view that well-being\nconsists only in conscious states: the so-called \u2018experience\nmachine\u2019. Imagine that I have a machine that I could plug you\ninto for the rest of your life. This machine would give you\nexperiences of whatever kind you thought most valuable or\nenjoyable\u2014writing a great novel, bringing about world peace,\nattending an early Rolling Stones\u2019 gig. You would not know you\nwere on the machine, and there is no worry about its breaking down or\nwhatever. Would you plug in? Would it be wise, from the point of your\nown well-being, to do so? Robert Nozick thinks it would be a big\nmistake to plug in: \u2018We want to do certain things \u2026 we\nwant to be a certain way \u2026 plugging into an experience machine\nlimits us to a man-made reality\u2019 (Nozick 1974, p. 43).\n\nOne can make the machine sound more palatable, by allowing that\ngenuine choices can be made on it, that those plugged in have access\nto a common \u2018virtual world\u2019 shared by other machine-users,\na world in which \u2018ordinary\u2019 communication is possible, and\nso on. But this will not be enough for many anti-hedonists. A further\nline of response begins from so-called \u2018externalism\u2019 in\nthe philosophy of mind, according to which the content of mental\nstates is determined by facts external to the experiencer of those\nstates. Thus, the experience of really writing a great novel\nis quite different from that of apparently writing a great\nnovel, even though \u2018from the inside\u2019 they may be\nindistinguishable. But this is once again sailing close to the wind.\nIf the world can affect the very content of my experience without my\nbeing in a position to be aware of it, why should it not directly\naffect the value of my experience?\n\nThe strongest tack for hedonists to take is to accept the apparent\nforce of the experience machine objection, but to insist that it rests\non \u2018common sense\u2019 intuitions, the place in our lives of\nwhich may itself be justified by hedonism. This is to adopt a strategy\nsimilar to that developed by \u2018two-level utilitarians\u2019 in\nresponse to alleged counter-examples based on common-sense morality.\nThe hedonist will point out the so-called \u2018paradox of\nhedonism\u2019, that pleasure is most effectively pursued indirectly.\nIf I consciously try to maximize my own pleasure, I will be unable to\nimmerse myself in those activities, such as reading or playing games,\nwhich do give pleasure. And if we believe that those activities are\nvaluable independently of the pleasure we gain from engaging in them,\nthen we shall probably gain more pleasure overall.\n\nThese kinds of stand-off in moral philosophy are unfortunate, but\nshould not be brushed aside (for a balanced discussion of the\nexperience machine, see Lin 2016). They raise questions concerning the\nepistemology of ethics, and the source and epistemic status of our\ndeepest ethical beliefs, which we are further from answering than many\nwould like to think. Certainly the current trend of quickly dismissing\nhedonism on the basis of a quick run-through of the experience machine\nobjection is not methodologically sound.\n4.2 Desire Theories\n\nThe experience machine is one motivation for the adoption of a desire\ntheory (for a good introduction to the view, see Heathwood 2016;\n2019). When you are on the machine, many of your central desires are\nlikely to remain unfilled. Take your desire to write a great novel.\nYou may believe that this is what you are doing, but in fact it is\njust a hallucination. And what you want, the argument goes, is to\nwrite a great novel, not the experience of writing a great novel.\n\nHistorically, however, the reason for the current dominance of desire\ntheories lies in the emergence of welfare economics. Pleasure and pain\nare inside people\u2019s heads, and also hard to\nmeasure\u2014especially when we have to start weighing different\npeople\u2019s experiences against one another. So economists began to\nsee people\u2019s well-being as consisting in the satisfaction of\npreferences or desires, the content of which could be revealed by the\nchoices of their possessors. This made possible the ranking of\npreferences, the development of \u2018utility functions\u2019 for\nindividuals, and methods for assessing the value of\npreference-satisfaction (using, for example, money as a standard).\n\nThe simplest version of a desire theory one might call the present\ndesire theory, according to which someone is made better off to\nthe extent that their current desires are fulfilled. This theory does\nsucceed in avoiding the experience machine objection. But it has\nserious problems of its own. Consider the case of the angry\nadolescent. This boy\u2019s mother tells him he cannot attend a\ncertain nightclub, so the boy holds a gun to his own head, wanting to\npull the trigger and retaliate against his mother. Recall that the\nscope of theories of well-being should be the whole of a life. It is\nimplausible that the boy will make his life go as well as possible by\npulling the trigger. We might perhaps interpret the simple desire\ntheory as a theory of well-being-at-at-a-particular-time. But even\nthen it seems unsatisfactory. From whatever perspective, the boy would\nbe better off if he put the gun down.\n\nWe should move, then, to a comprehensive desire theory,\naccording to which what matters to a person\u2019s well-being is the\noverall level of desire-satisfaction in their life as a whole. A\nsummative version of this theory suggests, straightforwardly\nenough, that the more desire-fulfilment in a life the better. But it\nruns into Derek Parfit\u2019s case of addiction (1984, p.\n497). Imagine that you can start taking a highly addictive drug, which\nwill cause a very strong desire in you for the drug every morning.\nTaking the drug will give you no pleasure; but not taking it will\ncause you quite severe suffering. There will be no problem with the\navailability of the drug, and it will cost you nothing. But what\nreason do you have to take it?\n\nA global version of the comprehensive theory ranks desires,\nso that desires about the shape and content of one\u2019s life as a\nwhole are given some priority. So, if I prefer not to become a drug\naddict, that will explain why it is better for me not to take\nParfit\u2019s drug. But now consider the case of the orphan\nmonk. This young man began training to be a monk at the earliest\nage, and has lived a very sheltered life. He is now offered three\nchoices: he can remain as a monk, or become either a cook or a\ngardener outside the monastery, at a grange. He has no conception of\nthe latter alternatives, so chooses to remain a monk. But surely it\nmight be possible that his life would be better for him were he to\nlive outside?\n\nSo we now have to move to an informed desire version of the\ncomprehensive theory (Sobel 1994). According to the informed desire\naccount, the best life is the one I would desire if I were fully\ninformed about all the (non-evaluative) facts. But now consider a case\nmade famous by John Rawls (1971: 432; see Stace 1944: 238):\nthe grass-counter. Imagine a brilliant Harvard mathematician,\nfully informed about the options available to her, who develops an\noverriding desire to count the blades of grass on the lawns of\nHarvard. Like the experience machine, this case is another example of\nphilosophical \u2018bedrock\u2019.  Some will believe that, if she\nreally is informed, and not suffering from some neurosis, then the\nlife of grass-counting will be the best for her.\n\nNote that on the informed desire view the subject must actually have\nthe desires in question for well-being to accrue to her. If it were\ntrue of me that, were I fully informed I would desire some object\nwhich at present I have no desire for, giving me that object now would\nnot benefit me. Any theory which claimed that it would amounts to an\nobjective list theory with a desire-based epistemology.\n\nAll these problem cases for desire theories appear to be symptoms of a\nmore general difficulty. Recall again the distinction between\nsubstantive and formal theories of well-being. The former state the\nconstituents of well-being (such as pleasure), while the latter state\nwhat makes these things good for people (pleasantness, for example).\nSubstantively, a desire theorist and a hedonist may agree on what\nmakes life good for people: pleasurable experiences. But formally they\nwill differ: the hedonist will refer to pleasantness as the\ngood-maker, while the desire theorist must refer to\ndesire-satisfaction. (It is worth pointing out here that if one\ncharacterizes pleasure as an experience the subject wants to continue,\nthe distinction between hedonism and desire theories becomes quite\nhard to pin down.)\n\nThe idea that desire-satisfaction is a \u2018good-making\nproperty\u2019 is somewhat odd. As Aristotle says\n(Metaphysics, 1072a, tr. Ross): \u2018desire is consequent\non opinion rather than opinion on desire\u2019. In other words, we\ndesire things, such as writing a great novel, because we think those\nthings are independently good; we do not think they are good because\nthey will satisfy our desire for them.\n4.3 Objective List Theories\n\nThe threefold distinction I am using between different theories of\nwell-being has become standard in contemporary ethics (Parfit 1984:\napp. I). There are problems with it, however, as with many\nclassifications, since it can blind one to other ways of\ncharacterizing views (see Kagan 1992; Hurka 2019). Objective list\ntheories are usually understood as theories which list items\nconstituting well-being that consist neither merely in pleasurable\nexperience nor in desire-satisfaction. Such items might include, for\nexample, knowledge or friendship. But it is worth remembering, for\nexample, that hedonism might be seen as one kind of \u2018list\u2019\ntheory, and all list theories might then be opposed to desire theories\nas a whole.\n\nWhat should go on the list (Moore 2000)? It is important that every\ngood should be included. As Aristotle put it: \u2018We take what is\nself-sufficient to be that which on its own makes life worthy of\nchoice and lacking in nothing. We think happiness to be such, and\nindeed the thing most of all worth choosing, not counted as just one\nthing among others\u2019 (Nicomachean Ethics, 1097b, tr.\nCrisp). In other words, if you claim that well-being consists only in\nfriendship and pleasure, I can show your list to be unsatisfactory if\nI can demonstrate that knowledge is also something that makes people\nbetter off.\n\nWhat is the \u2018good-maker\u2019, according to objective list\ntheorists? This depends on the theory. One, influenced by Aristotle\nand recently developed by Thomas Hurka (1993; see Bradford 2017), is\nperfectionism, according to which what makes things\nconstituents of well-being is their perfecting human nature. (On the\nhistory of modern perfectionism, see Brink 2019.) If it is part\nof human nature to acquire knowledge, for example, then a\nperfectionist should claim that knowledge is a constituent of\nwell-being. But there is nothing to prevent an objective list\ntheorist\u2019s claiming that all that the items on her list have in\ncommon is that each, in its own way, advances well-being.\n\nHow do we decide what goes on the list? All we can work on is the\ndeliverance of reflective judgement\u2014intuition, if you like. But\none should not conclude from this that objective list theorists are,\nbecause they are intuitionist, less satisfactory than the other two\ntheories. For those theories too can be based only on reflective\njudgement. Nor should one think that intuitionism rules out argument.\nArgument is one way to bring people to see the truth. Further, we\nshould remember that intuitions can be mistaken. Indeed, as suggested\nabove, this is the strongest line of defence available to hedonists:\nto attempt to undermine the evidential weight of many of our natural\nbeliefs about what is good for people.\n\nOne common objection to objective list theories is that they are\n\u00e9litist, since they appear to be claiming that certain things\nare good for people, even if those people will not enjoy them, and do\nnot even want them. One strategy here might be to adopt a\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 account, according to which certain goods do\nbenefit people independently of pleasure and desire-satisfaction, but\nonly when they do in fact bring pleasure and/or satisfy desires.\nAnother would be to bite the bullet, and point out that a theory could\nbe both \u00e9litist and true.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that objective list theories need not\ninvolve any kind of objectionable authoritarianism or perfectionism.\nFirst, one might wish to include autonomy on one\u2019s list,\nclaiming that the informed and reflective living of one\u2019s own\nlife for oneself itself constitutes a good. Second, and perhaps more\nsignificantly, one might note that any theory of well-being in itself\nhas no direct moral implications. There is nothing logically to\nprevent one\u2019s holding a highly \u00e9litist conception of\nwell-being alongside a strict liberal view that forbade paternalistic\ninterference of any kind with a person\u2019s own life (indeed, on\nsome interpretations, J.S. Mill\u2019s position is close to\nthis).\n\nOne not implausible view, if desire theories are indeed mistaken in\ntheir reversal of the relation between desire and what is good, is\nthat the debate is really between hedonism and objective list\ntheories. And, as suggested above, what is most at stake here is the\nissue of the epistemic adequacy of our beliefs about well-being. The\nbest way to resolve this matter would consist, in large part at least,\nin returning once again to the experience machine objection, and\nseeking to discover whether that objection really stands.\n5. Well-being and Morality\n5.1 Welfarism\n\nWell-being obviously plays a central role in any moral theory. A\ntheory which said that it just does not matter would be given no\ncredence at all. Indeed, it is very tempting to think that well-being,\nin some ultimate sense, is all that can matter morally. Consider, for\nexample, Joseph Raz\u2019s \u2018humanistic principle\u2019:\n\u2018the explanation and justification of the goodness or badness of\nanything derives ultimately from its contribution, actual or possible,\nto human life and its quality\u2019 (Raz 1986, p. 194). If we expand\nthis principle to cover non-human well-being, it might be read as\nclaiming that, ultimately speaking, the justificatory force of any\nmoral reason rests on well-being. This view is welfarism.\n\nAct-utilitarians, who believe that the right action is that which\nmaximizes well-being overall, may attempt to use the intuitive\nplausibility of welfarism to support their position, arguing that any\ndeviation from the maximization of well-being must be grounded on\nsomething distinct from well-being, such as equality or rights. But\nthose defending equality may argue that egalitarians are concerned to\ngive priority to those who are worse off, and that we do see here a\nlink with concern for well-being. Likewise, those concerned with\nrights may note that we have rights to certain goods, such as freedom,\nor to the absence of \u2018bads\u2019, such as suffering (in the\ncase of the right not to be tortured, for example). In other words,\nthe interpretation of welfarism is itself a matter of dispute. But,\nhowever it is understood, it does seem that welfarism poses a problem\nfor those who believe that morality can require actions which benefit\nno one, and harm some, such as, for example, punishments intended to\ngive individuals what they deserve.\n5.2 Well-being and Virtue\n\nAncient ethics was, in a sense, more concerned with well-being than a\ngood deal of modern ethics, the central question for many ancient\nmoral philosophers being, \u2018Which life is best for one?\u2019.\nThe rationality of egoism\u2014the view that my strongest reason is\nalways to advance my own well-being\u2014was largely assumed. This\nposed a problem. Morality is naturally thought to concern the\ninterests of others. So if egoism is correct, what reason do I have to\nbe moral?\n\nOne obvious strategy to adopt in defence of morality is to claim that\na person\u2019s well-being is in some sense constituted by their\nvirtue, or the exercise of virtue, and this strategy was adopted in\nsubtly different ways by the three greatest ancient philosophers,\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle (for a modern defence of the view, see\nBloomfield (2014)). At one point in his writings, Plato appears to\nallow for the rationality of moral self-sacrifice: the philosophers in\nhis famous \u2018cave\u2019 analogy in the Republic\n(519\u201320) are required by morality to desist from contemplation\nof the sun outside the cave, and to descend once again into the cave\nto govern their fellow citizens. In the voluminous works of Aristotle,\nhowever, there is no recommendation of sacrifice. Aristotle believed\nthat he could defend the virtuous choice as always being in the\ninterest of the individual. Note, however, that he need not be\ndescribed as an egoist in a strong sense\u2014as someone who believes\nthat our only reasons for action are grounded in our own well-being.\nFor him, virtue both tends to advance the good of others, and (at\nleast when acted on) advances our own good. So Aristotle might well\nhave allowed that the well-being of others grounds reasons for me to\nact. But these reasons will never come into conflict with reasons\ngrounded in my own individual well-being.\n\nHis primary argument is the notorious and perfectionist\n\u2018function argument\u2019, according to which the good for some\nbeing is to be identified through attention to its\n\u2018function\u2019 or characteristic activity. The characteristic\nactivity of human beings is to exercise reason, and the good will lie\nin exercising reason well\u2014that is, in accordance with the\nvirtues. This argument, which is stated by Aristotle very briefly and\nrelies on assumptions from elsewhere in his philosophy and indeed that\nof Plato, appears to conflate the two ideas of what is good for a\nperson, and what is morally good. I may agree that a\n\u2018good\u2019 example of humanity will be virtuous, but deny that\nthis person is doing what is best for them. Rather, I may insist,\nreason requires one to advance one\u2019s own good, and this good\nconsists in, for example, pleasure, power, or honour. But much of\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics is taken up with\nportraits of the life of the virtuous and the vicious, which supply\nindependent support for the claim that well-being is constituted by\nvirtue. In particular, it is worth noting the emphasis placed by\nAristotle on the value to a person of \u2018nobility\u2019 (to\nkalon), a quasi-aesthetic value which those sensitive to such\nqualities might not implausibly see as a constituent of well-being of\nmore worth than any other. In this respect, the good of virtue is, in\nthe Kantian sense, \u2018unconditional\u2019. Yet, for Aristotle,\nvirtue or the \u2018good will\u2019 is not only morally good, but\ngood for the individual.\n",

Some\nsignificant recent works are Griffin (1986) and Finnis (2011), which\npresent different objective lists; Goldman (2018), which develops\na view of well-being as consisting in the fulfillment of rational\ndesire, Sobel 2016, which defends a broadly subjective view of\nwell-being; Feldman (2004) and Crisp (2006), which defend\nhedonism; Sumner (1996), which rejects many current options and\nadvocates a theory of well-being based on the idea of\n\u2018life-satisfaction\u2019; Kraut (2007), which develops a\nbroadly Aristotelian account; and Haybron (2008), Tiberius\n(2008), and Alexandrova (2017) which address issues that arise in\ncontemporary psychological research on happiness. A collection of\nextremely useful essays is Fletcher (2016b). See also Nussbaum and Sen\n(1993).</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Adler, M. and M.
