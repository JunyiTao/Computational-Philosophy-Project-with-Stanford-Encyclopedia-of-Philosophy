    "main_text": "The Ego and Its Own || Form and Structure\n2.1 Form and Structure\n\nModern readers hoping to understand The Ego and Its Own are\nconfronted by several obstacles, not least the form, structure, and\ncentral arguments, of Stirner\u2019s book.\n\nMuch of Stirner\u2019s prose \u2014 crowded with aphorisms,\nemphases, and hyperbole \u2014 appears calculated to disconcert. Most\nstriking, perhaps, is his use of word play. Rather than reach a\nconclusion through the conventional use of argument, Stirner often\napproaches a claim that he wishes to endorse by exploiting words with\nrelated etymologies or formal similarities. For example, he associates\nwords for property (such as \u201cEigentum\u201d) with\nwords connoting distinctive individual characteristics (such as\n\u201cEigenheit\u201d) in order to promote the claim that\nproperty is expressive of selfhood. (Stirner\u2019s account of\negoistic property \u2014 see 2.4 below \u2014 gives this otherwise\northodox-looking Hegelian claim a distinctive twist.)\n\nThis rejection of conventional forms of intellectual discussion is\nlinked to Stirner\u2019s substantive views about language and\nrationality. His distinctive style reflects a conviction that both\nlanguage and rationality are human products which have come to\nconstrain and oppress their creators. Stirner maintains that accepted\nmeanings and traditional standards of argumentation are underpinned by\na conception of truth as a privileged realm beyond individual control.\nAs a result, individuals who accept this conception are abandoning a\npotential area of creative self-expression in favour of embracing a\nsubordinate role as servants of truth. In stark contrast, Stirner\ninsists that the only legitimate restriction on the form of our\nlanguage, or on the structure of our arguments, is that they should\nserve our individual ends. It is the frequent failure of conventional\nmeanings and received forms of argument to satisfy his interpretation\nof this criterion which underpins the remorselessly idiosyncratic form\nof Stirner\u2019s prose.\n\nThe Ego and Its Own has an intelligible, but scarcely\ntransparent, structure. It is organised around a tripartite account of\nhuman experience, which is first introduced in a description of the\nstages of an individual life. The first stage in this developmental\nnarrative is the realistic one of childhood, in which\nchildren are constrained by material and natural forces such as their\nparents. Liberation from these constraints is achieved with what\nStirner calls the self-discovery of mind, as children find the means\nto outwit those extrenal forces in their own determination and\ncunning. The resulting idealistic stage of youth, however,\ncontains new internal sources of constraint, as individuals once more\nbecome enslaved, this time to the spiritual forces of conscience and\nreason. Only with the adulthood of egoism do individuals\nescape both material (external) and spiritual (internal) constraints,\nlearning to value their personal satisfaction above all other\nconsiderations.\n\nStirner portrays this dialectic of individual growth as an analogue of\nhistorical development, and it is a tripartite account of the latter\nwhich structures the remainder of the book. Human history is reduced\nto three successive epochs of: realism (the ancient, or pre-Christian,\nworld); idealism (the modern, or Christian, world); and egoism (the\nfuture world). Part One of The Ego and Its Own is devoted to\nthe first two of those historical epochs, providing a negative\ncritique of the past. And Part Two is concerned with the third of\nthese epochs, providing a positive account of the future.\n\nIn both individual and historical forms, the second stage of this\ntripartite developmental narrative is presented as a negation of the\nfirst, and the third stage, in turn, as the negation of that negation.\nThe triadic structure of this narrative has been read as confirming\nStirner\u2019s Hegelian formation and commitments (Stepelevich:\n1985), but can also be seen as embodying a self-conscious parody of\nHegelianism. In this context, Stirner has plausibly been understood as\noffering both a provocation and a knowing attempt at humour, utilising\na dialectical structure in order to advance his own anti-Hegelian\nposition (De Ridder: 2008). There is little doubt about the\nprovocation, but assessing Stirner\u2019s seriousness is a harder\ntask.\n",
