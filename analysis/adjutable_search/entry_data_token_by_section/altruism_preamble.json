    "main_text": "\n\nBehavior is normally described as altruistic when it is motivated by a\ndesire to benefit someone other than oneself for that person\u2019s\nsake. The term is used as the contrary of\n\u201cself-interested\u201d or \u201cselfish\u201d or\n\u201cegoistic\u201d\u2014words applied to behavior that is\nmotivated solely by the desire to benefit oneself.\n\u201cMalicious\u201d designates an even greater contrast: it\napplies to behavior that expresses a desire to harm others simply for\nthe sake of harming them.\n\nSometimes, however, the word is used more broadly to refer to behavior\nthat benefits others, regardless of its motive. Altruism in this broad\nsense might be attributed to certain kinds of non-human\nanimals\u2014mother bears, for example, who protect their cubs from\nattack, and in doing so put their own lives in danger. So used, there\nis no implication that such adult bears act \u201cfor the sake\u201d\nof their young (Sober and Wilson 1998: 6). \n\nThis essay will discuss altruism in the former sense, as behavior\nundertaken deliberately to help someone other than the agent for that\nother individual\u2019s sake. There is a large and growing empirical\nliterature on altruism, which asks whether there is an evolutionary or\nbiological basis for human altruism, and whether\nnon-human species exhibit it or something similar to it.\nThese issues are addressed by the entries on\n empirical approaches to altruism and\n biological altruism.\n\n\nIt is commonly assumed that we ought to be altruistic at least to some\nextent. But to what extent? And is altruism necessarily admirable? Why\nshould one act for the sake of others and not only for\none\u2019s own sake? For that matter, do people in fact act out\nof altruism, or is all behavior ultimately self-interested?\n",
