The moniker derives from Aristotle, who in various\nplaces (e.g., Metaphysics 990b17 = 1079a13, 1039a2;\nSophistical Refutations 178b36 ff.) discusses (something akin\nto) the argument at Parmenides 132a\u2013b in these terms.\n\n\nParmenides sets up the argument by pointing out that, according to the\ntheory of forms, Oneness is supposed to follow from\nOne-over-Many. (Some, e.g., Fine (1993, 204), claim that Plato\nmeans the sentence \u201ceach form is one\u201d to express\nUniqueness, not Oneness. But this is certainly not what a\nrelevantly similar sentence expresses at Republic 476a2\u20136 and\n524b7\u201311\u2014see above.) From the existence of a plurality of F\nthings and the fact that, for any such plurality P, there is a form of\nF-ness by virtue of partaking of which each member\nof P is F, it follows that there is one form\n\u201cover\u201d the many members of P (in the sense of\nbeing that by virtue of partaking of which each member of P\nis F). And given that anything that is one \u201cover\u201d\nmany is (in some sense) one, it follows that any form that has\nparticipants is one.\n\n\nThere is a vast literature on the Third Man argument, initiated by the\ngroundbreaking analysis of the reasoning in Vlastos (1954). (See,\namong others, Sellars (1955), Vlastos (1955), Geach (1956), Vlastos\n(1956), Cherniss (1957), Peck (1962), Moravcsik (1963), Strang (1963),\nVlastos (1969), Cohen (1971), Teloh and Louzecky (1972), Peterson\n(1973), Goldstein and Mannick (1978), Mann (1979), Mates (1979),\nPickering (1981), Teloh (1981, 158\u2013167), Waterlow (1982), Prior\n(1985, 64\u201375), Curd (1986), Sharvy (1986), Penner (1987,\n251\u2013299), Scaltsas (1989), Malcolm (1991, 47\u201353), Meinwald\n(1992), Scaltsas (1992), Fine (1993, 203\u2013241), McCabe (1994,\n84\u201387), Schweizer (1994), Frances (1996), Allen (1997,\n152\u2013167), Hunt (1997), Rickless (1998), Pelletier and Zalta\n(2000), and Rickless (2007, 64\u201375).) Most commentators agree\nthat the reasoning relies on at least three principles: One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity (about which more anon). (Allen\n(1997, 163) accepts that the reasoning relies on the claim that the\nlarge is large\u2014an instance of Self-Predication, but denies that\nthe argument, when generalized to forms other than the large, relies\non Self-Predication.) They also agree that the reasoning generates an\ninfinite regress of forms of largeness, and that the argument could be\ngeneralized to generate an infinite regress of forms corresponding to\nany predicate. But commentators differ over why Plato takes the\nregress to be vicious or problematic, and what Plato would have\nrecommended as a way of avoiding the absurdity generated by the\nreasoning.\n\n\nParmenides generates the infinite regress as follows. Consider a\nplurality of large things, A, B, and C. By\nOne-over-Many, there is a form of largeness (call it\n\u201cL1\u201d) by virtue of partaking of\nwhich A, B, and C are large. By\nSelf-Predication, L1 is large. So there is now a new\nplurality of large things, A, B,\nC, and L1. Thus, by One-over-Many, there is a form\nof largeness (call it \u201cL2\u201d) by virtue of\npartaking of which A, B, C, and\nL1 are large. Hence L1 partakes of L2. At this point,\nParmenides assumes something like the following Non-Identity\nassumption:\n\n\n(Non-Identity)\nNo form is identical to anything that partakes of it.\n\n\n(Notice that Non-Identity follows directly from Separation.)  From the\nfact that L1 partakes of L2, Non-Identity entails\nthat L2 is numerically distinct from L1. Thus, there\nmust be at least two forms of largeness, L1\nand L2. But this is not all. By Self-Predication, L2\nis large. So there is now a new plurality of large\nthings, A, B, C, L1,\nand L2. Thus, by One-over-Many, there is a form of largeness\n(call it \u201cL3\u201d) by virtue of partaking of\nwhich A, B, C, L1, and L2\nare large. Hence L1 and L2 both partake\nof L3. But then, by Non-Identity, L3 is numerically\ndistinct from both L1 and L2. Thus, there must be at\nleast three forms of largeness, L1, L2,\nand L3. Repetition of this reasoning, based on One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity, then generates an infinite\nhierarchy of forms of largeness, with each form partaking of every\nform that lies above it in the hierarchy.  (That is, for every m and n\nsuch that m<n, Lm partakes of Ln.)\n\n\nIn what way does the existence of an infinite regress of forms\nrepresent a problem for the theory of forms? One answer to this\nquestion (see Vlastos (1954, 328, fn. 12; 1955), Goldstein and Mannick\n(1978), Penner (1987, 279\u2013282), and Fine (1993, 204)) is that\nthe nature of the problem is fundamentally epistemic. On this view,\nthe theory of forms includes the thesis that, for any\nproperty F, the primary function of the F is to\nexplain the F-ness of F things, and hence to make it\npossible for humans to apprehend and know things as\nF. But, so the story goes, Plato assumes that an infinite\nregress of forms of F-ness, each of which explains\nthe F-ness of the forms of\nF-ness below it in the hierarchy, cannot explain the F-ness of the\noriginal plurality of F things: explanation must come to an end\nsomewhere. Although this interpretation makes sense of the\nepistemic language that Plato sprinkles throughout the Third Man\npassage, it does not make sense of the fact that Parmenides sets up the\nargument by pointing out that the oneness of the large follows from its\nbeing one \u201cover\u201d many large things (see above). So it\nis unlikely that the epistemic reading of the Third Man is what Plato\nhad in mind.\n\n\nOther scholars claim, quite correctly, that the existence of infinitely\nmany forms (indeed, the existence of so much as two forms)\ncorresponding to any predicate is inconsistent with Uniqueness.\nAnd, indeed, this result appears to be at least part of what the Third\nMan argument is designed to uncover. But Plato seems to be\nlooking to establish more than this. For in the last sentence of\nthe relevant passage, Parmenides announces that the argument shows that\neach form is no longer one, but infinitely many. Although most\ncommentators gloss this comment as the claim that there is no longer\none form per predicate, but rather infinitely many, this is not what\nthe sentence actually says. What the sentence suggests is that\nthe existence of infinitely many forms of largeness conflicts with\nOneness.\n\n\nOne way to make sense of this claim is by way of the following chain of\nreasoning. As we\u2019ve seen, One-over-Many, Self-Predication,\nand Non-Identity together generate an infinite hierarchy of forms of\nlargeness, each of which partakes of the forms above it in the\nhierarchy. Thus, L1 partakes of infinitely many forms, L2\npartakes of infinitely many forms, L3 partakes of infinitely many\nforms, and so on. Now there are passages in which Plato appears\nto assume that forms are as many as the predicates that can be truly\napplied to them (see Philebus 14c8\u2013d3, and Rickless (2007,\n71)). And if we assume that Parmenides is still working with the\nPiece-of-Pie model of partaking, then the fact that a form partakes of\ninfinitely many forms entails that it has infinitely many parts, and\nhence is itself infinitely many. So from the existence of an\ninfinite regress of forms and from what appear to be dialectically\nappropriate assumptions, it is possible to argue that each form in the\nhierarchy is infinitely many. Given that the property of being\none and the property of being many are contraries, it then follows\ndirectly from Purity-F that each form in the hierarchy is not\none. This interpretation explains why Parmenides announces at the\nend of the argument that each form is no longer one, but infinitely\nmany (see Rickless (2007, 64\u201375)).\n\n\nMany commentators think that the fundamental inconsistency revealed by\nthe Third Man argument rests with the combination of One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity. For them, the Third Man\nrequires that Plato give up at least one of these principles. But\non the interpretation that best explains the set-up and final sentence\nof the passage, Plato need not give up any of these principles in order\nto avoid inconsistency: he can simply abandon Purity-F (and perhaps\nalso Uniqueness).\n",
