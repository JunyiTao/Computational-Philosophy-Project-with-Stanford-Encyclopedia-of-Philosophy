    "main_text": "The Concept of the Aesthetic || Aesthetic Experience\n2.4 Aesthetic Experience\n\nTheories of aesthetic experience may be divided into two kinds\naccording to the kind of feature appealed to in explanation of what\nmakes experience aesthetic: internalist theories appeal to\nfeatures internal to experience, typically to phenomenological\nfeatures, whereas externalist theories appeal to features\nexternal to the experience, typically to features of the object\nexperienced. (The distinction between internalist and externalist\ntheories of aesthetic experience is similar, though not identical, to\nthe distinction between phenomenal and epistemic conceptions of\naesthetic experience drawn by Gary Iseminger (Iseminger 2003, 100, and\nIseminger 2004, 27, 36)). Though internalist\ntheories\u2014particularly John Dewey\u2019s (1934) and Monroe\nBeardsley\u2019s (1958)\u2014predominated during the early and\nmiddle parts of the 20th century, externalist theories\u2014including\nBeardsley\u2019s (1982) and George Dickie\u2019s (1988)\u2014have\nbeen in the ascendance since. Beardsley\u2019s views on aesthetic\nexperience make a strong claim on our attention, given that Beardsley\nmight be said to have authored the culminating internalist theory as\nwell as the founding externalist one. Dickie\u2019s criticisms of\nBeardsley\u2019s internalism make an equally strong claim, since they\nmoved Beardsley\u2014and with him most everyone else\u2014from\ninternalism toward externalism.\n\nAccording to the version of internalism Beardsley advances in\nhis\u202fAesthetics\u202f(1958), all aesthetic experiences\nhave in common three or four (depending on how you count) features,\nwhich \u201csome writers have [discovered] through acute\nintrospection, and which each of us can test in his own\nexperience\u201d (Beardsley 1958, 527). These are focus (\u201can\naesthetic experience is one in which attention is firmly fixed upon\n[its object]\u201d), intensity, and unity, where unity is a matter of\ncoherence and of completeness (Beardsley 1958, 527). Coherence, in\nturn, is a matter of having elements that are properly connected one\nto another such that\n\n[o]ne thing leads to another; continuity of development, without gaps\nor dead spaces, a sense of overall providential pattern of guidance,\nan orderly cumulation of energy toward a climax, are present to an\nunusual degree. (Beardsley 1958, 528)\n\n\nCompleteness, by contrast, is a matter having elements that\n\u201ccounterbalance\u201d or \u201cresolve\u201d one another such\nthat the whole stands apart from elements without it:\n\nThe impulses and expectations aroused by elements within the\nexperience are felt to be counterbalanced or resolved by other\nelements within the experience, so that some degree of equilibrium or\nfinality is achieved and enjoyed. The experience detaches itself, and\neven insulates itself, from the intrusion of alien elements.\n(Beardsley 1958, 528)\n\n\nDickie\u2019s most consequential criticism of Beardsley\u2019s\ntheory is that Beardsley, in describing the phenomenology of aesthetic\nexperience, has failed to distinguish between the features we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having and the features aesthetic\nexperiences themselves have. So while every feature mentioned in\nBeardsley\u2019s description of the coherence of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014continuity of development, the absence of gaps, the\nmounting of energy toward a climax\u2014surely is a feature we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having, there is no reason to think of\naesthetic experience itself as having any such features:\n\nNote that everything referred to [in Beardsley\u2019s description of\ncoherence] is a perceptual characteristic \u2026 and not an effect\nof perceptual characteristics. Thus, no ground is furnished for\nconcluding that experience can be unified in the sense of being\ncoherent. What is actually argued for is that aesthetic objects are\ncoherent, a conclusion which must be granted, but not the one which is\nrelevant. (Dickie 1965, 131)\n\n\nDickie raises a similar worry about Beardsley\u2019s description of\nthe completeness of aesthetic experience:\n\nOne can speak of elements being counterbalanced\u202fin the\npainting\u202fand say that the painting is stable, balanced and\nso on, but what does it mean to say\nthe\u202fexperience\u202fof the spectator of the painting\nis stable or balanced? \u2026 Looking at a painting in some cases\nmight aid some persons in coming to feel stable because it might\ndistract them from whatever is unsettling them, but such cases are\natypical of aesthetic appreciation and not relevant to aesthetic\ntheory. Aren\u2019t characteristics attributable to the painting\nsimply being mistakenly shifted to the spectator? (Dickie 1965, 132)\n\n\nThough these objections turned out to be only the beginning of the\ndebate between Dickie and Beardsley on the nature of aesthetic\nexperience (See Beardsley 1969, Dickie 1974, Beardsley 1970, and\nDickie 1987; see also Iseminger 2003 for a helpful overview of the\nBeardsley-Dickie debate), they nevertheless went a long way toward\nshaping that debate, which taken as whole might be seen as the working\nout of an answer to the question \u201cWhat can a theory of aesthetic\nexperience be that takes seriously the distinction between the\nexperience of features and the features of experience?\u201d The\nanswer turned out to be an externalist theory of the sort that\nBeardsley advances in the 1970 essay \u201cThe Aesthetic Point of\nView\u201d and that many others have advanced since: a theory\naccording to which an aesthetic experience just is an experience\nhaving aesthetic content, i.e., an experience of an object as having\nthe aesthetic features that it has.\n\nThe shift from internalism to externalism has meant that one central\nambition of internalism\u2014that of tying the meaning of\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 to features internal to aesthetic\nexperience\u2014has had to be given up. But a second, equally\ncentral, ambition\u2014that of accounting for aesthetic value by\ngrounding it in the value of aesthetic experience\u2014has been\nretained. The following section takes up the development and prospects\nof such accounts.\n ",
