    "main_text": "Subversive Contractarianism\n6. Disability, Animals, Reciprocity, and Trust\n\nDisability rights activists, however, would still seem to have a\nserious complaint to lodge against normative contractarianism, since\nit is surely the case that there are persons who cannot reciprocate\nbenefits to others. Such persons would be, on the normative\ncontractarian view, beyond the scope of the rules of justice. Recent\nliterature on disability argues that, to the contrary,\ncontractarianism can be inclusive of the disabled. For example, it may\nbe argued that in fact most disabled persons and all caregivers would\nbe included in the bargaining group for clear strategic reasons\n(Becker 2005). The basic contractarian insight that cooperation is\nmutually advantageous implies that whenever someone can be included as\na contributing cooperator there are gains to be realized for all. Many\ndisabled people are either already capable of contributing or could be\nso with accommodation or rehabilitation, and thus it is to the\nadvantage of society to provide accommodations or rehabilitation at\nsome level, requiring reciprocal contributions from those thus\nbenefited. For those disabled persons who cannot be rehabilitated,\ncontractarianism provides a different solution, namely a\n\u201cmutually advantageous\u201d social insurance scheme that\noffers a dignified standard of care for anyone who needs it (Becker\n2005). One might object that the currently healthy contractors would\nnot see the need to pay premiums as high as the already disabled,\nsince they have a lower probability of needing the care. For this\ninsurance scheme to work (and to avoid adverse selection problems),\neveryone would need to agree to equal premiums without prior knowledge\nof their condition. But it is hard to see how a contractarian can\njustify this agreement. A contractualist, on the other hand, could\nargue that such an agreement could not be reasonably rejected. This\nline of argument would have to show that a similar argument could not\nbe made for any form of bad luck, on pain of this view devolving into\negalitarianism.\n\nSuch a view thus raises the objection that there is a level of need\nfor rehabilitation or accommodation that goes beyond any possible\nfuture expected contribution for a given disabled person. And disabled\npersons are not well placed to hold out a threat to destabilize\nsociety, so the motivation to contract with them must be the expected\nbenefit. Relying on only ideas of mutual advantage and reciprocity\nwould continue to leave these people\u2014the\n\u201coutliers\u201d\u2014outside the contract, languishing below\nan acceptable level of functioning which they could, given another\nmoral theory, rightfully claim. According to some, contracting need\nnot be essentially adversarial (Francis & Silvers 2005). Since the\nbenefits of mutual agreement are best achieved by \u201cpromoting\nstable compliance with mutual expectations\u201d (Francis &\nSilvers 2005, 60), the essential element of contract is the\ndevelopment of trust, and the deeper and more widespread the trust,\nthe lower the enforcement costs to contracting.  Granting the\nimportance of trust development, then, the disabled are as capable of\ncontributing to this climate, perhaps more so because of their greater\nvulnerability, as the able-bodied. By this they mean that disabled\npersons who rely on others for care can decide to put aside fears of\nbetrayal or neglect and remain positive and forward looking, and\nthereby bring about a positive affective climate in themselves and\ntheir caregivers. This affective work toward trust building becomes\ntheir contribution to the social good. Thus by focusing on the\nmotivation of cooperation for mutual advantage rather than fear of the\ndepredations of others, a more inclusive and positive contractarian\npolitical theory comes into view. This view depends on the assumption\n(similar to one made by Gauthier) that our moral psychology is such\nthat, once we develop our disposition to cooperate, we lose the\ndisposition to cheat on agreements we have made or harm others to\nsatisfy our immediate self interest. As mentioned earlier, this\nassumption has often been questioned by critics of\ncontractarianism.\n\nThe case for including animals within the scope of the rules of\njustice produced by the contract is more difficult to make because,\nunlike the disabled who may only require and depend on appropriate\naccommodations in order to reciprocate, animals may be considered\nincapable of reciprocating benefits to others and are also incapable\nof rational interaction. If contractarianism is at all able to account\nfor the moral standing of animals, then it has to do so in a more\nindirect way than in the case of the disabled. It may be possible to\nground the moral standing of animals as part of a contract agreed to\nby other contractors who are capable of rational interaction (Cohen\n2007, 2009). Suppose that Bob agrees to form a contract with Jane only\non the condition that Jane also attributes direct moral standing to\nBob\u2019s pet dog, Rosko. As a result of the contract between Bob and\nJane, Rosko gains intrinsic moral standing that imposes correlative\nmoral duties on Jane. If Jane were to harm Rosko in some way, she\nwould not only violate a duty to Rosko\u2019s owner, Bob, but she would\nalso violate a duty that she has to Rosko who possesses\nintrinsic moral standing of his own. In this way bilateral agreements\nbetween contractors could potentially extend the scope of the rules of\njustice to apply to beings both incapable of rational interaction and\narguably incapable of reciprocating benefits to others.\n\nDeriving the moral standing of beings from agreements reached by other\ncontractors not only assumes that contractors have tuistic\npreferences, an assumption rejected by many contractarians, but it\nalso potentially makes the moral standing of those beings contingent\non the nature of the tuistic preferences and interests held by others\n(Tanner 2013). Contractors may agree to protect only certain kinds of\nanimals, and they may make agreements to protect animals only when\ndoing so does not conflict with their own, more narrowly construed\ninterests. As a result, the status of those who cannot participate in\nthe initial situation for various reasons, such as the disabled and\nanimals, remains a contentious issue in contractarian thought.\n",
