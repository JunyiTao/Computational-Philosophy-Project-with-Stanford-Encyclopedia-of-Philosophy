    "main_text": "What is Globalization? || Political Globalization\n1.2 Political Globalization\n\nAlthough political and economic globalization are interconnected and\nmutually reinforcing, they differ in significant ways. Political\nglobalization refers to changes in the exercise of political power\nthat have resulted from increased transnational engagement. Prior to\nWorld War II, the international political system was understood in\nterms of the so-called Westphalian model. According to this model,\npolitical power is exercised primarily through governance at the level\nof the territorial state. The international political system is\ncomprised of sovereign states, which enjoy a monopoly on political\npower within their own territories. International treaties govern\nrelations among states; however, states generally cannot legitimately\nintervene in the domestic affairs of other nations. Thus, when\nproblems, such as famines, genocides, and civil wars arise, they are\nseen primarily as security issues for individual states, not matters\nof justice affecting the global community (Fraser 2013).\n\nIn contrast to this state-centric model, political globalization must\nbe understood as polycentric, that is, as involving non-state\ninstitutions that exercise political power from both\n\u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d the state (So 2010). The\ndevelopment of supra-national institutions, such as the United\nNations, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization,\nthe European Union, NATO, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,\nand others, can be understood as political \u201cglobalization from\nabove.\u201d These institutions create international rules that\nconstrain the sovereignty of states, in some cases, through\nenforcement mechanisms that penalize for noncompliance. In addition to\nholding states accountable for adhering to mutually agreed upon norms\nand standards, global institutions often set the agendas that\ndetermine which issues receive international attention. Institutions\nsuch as the UN and EU have sought to draw attention to some of the\ninjustices experienced by women around the world, such as sexual\nviolence, lack of educational access, and other women\u2019s human\nrights violations, and to develop global frameworks for addressing\nthem. However, many feminist philosophers argue that supra-national\ninstitutions have had limited success in protecting the world\u2019s\nmost vulnerable people. Most global institutions privilege Western and\ncorporate interests over those of vulnerable and marginalized people,\nand few have been successful in challenging the structural\ninequalities that give rise to gendered harms, such as deprivation,\ndiscrimination, and violence. \n\nFor many feminists, the transnational political movements that have\nemerged \u201cfrom below\u201d the state offer a more promising\ndimension of political globalization. The expansion of global\ncommunications has led to the development of new transnational\npolitical networks, comprised of individuals, non-governmental\norganizations, and social movements. These transnational networks,\nsometimes referred to as \u201cglobal civil society,\u201d connect\nmillions of people around the world based on shared political\ncommitments. Consequently, some feminist philosophers believe that\npolitical \u201cglobalization from below\u201d provides women and\nother vulnerable people with an effective means for resisting the\ninequalities created by economic globalization. For instance, some\nfeminists argue that globalization has created new transnational\npublic spheres in which political opinion can be marshaled to hold\nleaders democratically accountable (Fraser 2009, Gould 2009). This\ntransnational public sphere must be understood both in terms of\nphysical locations, such as home, factory, and village, as well as\ntechnologically mediated spaces made possible by the internet; such\nmodes of communication form a new layer of transnational space that\nallows people to build horizontal networks and communities (Youngs\n2005). Others see the promise of political globalization in\ntransnational feminist solidarity networks, such as the women\u2019s\nrights are human rights campaign and groups combating sex trafficking,\nglobal care chains, and labor exploitation that enable feminist\nresistance to dominant political and economic forces (Copelon 2003,\nGallegos 2017, Hochschild 2000, 2002, Kittay, 2008, 2009, Parekh 2009,\nRobinson 2003, Stamatopoulou 1995, Walby 2002, Weir 2005). \n\nGiven the complexity of globalization, how have feminist political\nphilosophers addressed the social, political, and economic challenges\nposed by it? Below, we provide an overview of several feminist\ntheoretical approaches to this task.\n",
