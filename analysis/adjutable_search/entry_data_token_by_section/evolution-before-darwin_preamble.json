    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cEvolution\u201d in contemporary discussions denotes the theory\nof the change of organic species over time. Prior to the second half\nof the nineteenth century, the term was used primarily, if not\nexclusively, in an embryological sense to designate the development of\nthe individual embryo. These same ambiguities of usage also surround\nthe German term Entwicklungsgeschichte, which originally was\nused in an embryological context. In 1852 the English philosopher\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) used the term to denote both cosmic\nand biological changes from \u201chomogeneity\u201d to\n\u201cheterogeneity\u201d, and spoke there of a \u201ctheory of\nevolution\u201d. In the 1860s the term was used in some contexts to\ndesignate species change (Bowler 1975). Darwin himself did not use\nthis specific term for his theory until the Descent of Man\n(1871). Since this article will survey the broad history of these\ntheories prior to the Origin of Species, the term\n\u201ctransformism\u201d, a term that came into common use in French\nbiological sources around 1835, will generally be used in this article\nto designate the theory of species change prior to the shift in\nmeaning in the 1860s. Since Darwin\u2019s work, the designator\n\u201cevolution\u201d has been typically, if not exclusively, linked\nwith the theory of natural selection as the primary cause by which\nsuch species change has occurred over historical time.\n\nThis entry gives a broad historical review of the topic up to the\n\u201cDarwinian Revolution\u201d. The Darwinian period will be\ntreated in the separate entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man.\n The issues will be examined under the following headings:\n",
