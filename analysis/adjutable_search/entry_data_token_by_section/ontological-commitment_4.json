    "main_text": "Quantifier Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Modal Quantifier Criteria\n1.5 Modal Quantifier Criteria\nIt is high time to take the \u2018must\u2019 seriously when\nconsidering what entities must be taken to be values of the bound\nvariables in order for the theory to be true. The resulting criteria\nwould not be endorsed by Quine. But, as long as they tie ontological\ncommitment to the values of the bound variables of theories couched\nwithin first-order logic, they are still Quinean in spirit; they are\nstill versions of the quantifier account of ontological\ncommitment.\nWe begin by interpreting the \u2018must\u2019 as metaphysical\nnecessity, and interpreting metaphysical necessity as quantification\nover all metaphysically possible worlds. According to the simplest\nmodal account, a theory is (perhaps implicitly) committed\nto Ks whenever the existence of Ks is necessarily\nimplied by the theory. This account isn't even Quinean in\nspirit\u2014it makes no mention of the values of the\nvariables\u2014but it serves as a useful foil to Quinean accounts,\nand will come in for later discussion\n(\u00a72.2). It is assumed that each possible\nworld has an associated domain of entities: roughly, all the entities\nthat exist in the world. (These entities, however, need not all be in\nthe range of the first-order quantifiers.) Moreover, it is assumed\nthat when sentences of first-order predicate logic are evaluated\nrelative to a possible world, the sentences' quantifiers range only\nover entities in the domain of the world in question. This leads to\nwhat will be called a modal entailment criterion (other\nentailment criteria make use of entailment relations other than\nmetaphysical necessitation): \n\nModal Entailment Criterion.  A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, for every\nworld w, T is true at w only if the domain\nof w contains at least one K.\n\nIn other words, a theory is ontologically committed to Ks\njust when it necessarily implies that Ks\nexist.[11]\nUnlike extensional criteria, the modal entailment criterion has no\nproblem with (contingently) false existentials. The sentence\n\u2018\u2203x Unicorn(x)\u2019 is ontologically\ncommitted to unicorns because, at every world at which it is true,\nthe domain of that world contains at least one unicorn. In saying\nthis, the meta-ontologist may or may not herself be ontologically\ncommitted to unicorns depending on how the meta-ontologist construes\ntalk of possible worlds and possible individuals. A modal\nrealist\u2014someone who takes possibilia to be\nconcrete\u2014will be so committed. But an ersatz modal\nrealist\u2014someone who takes possibilia to be in\nsome sense abstract\u2014will interpret \u201cthe domain of that\nworld contains at least one unicorn\u201d in a way that does not\ncommit the meta-ontologist to unicorns; abstract worlds\ncan represent unicorns as existing whether or not unicorns\nexist.[12]\nThe modal entailment criterion, however, appears to be inadequate\nwith respect to the vast majority of philosophical applications, at\nleast as metaphysical necessity is standardly interpreted\n(but see \u00a72.2 for possible lines of\ndefense). This is because many philosophically controversial kinds of\nentity are taken to exist necessarily if they exist at all, for\nexample, numbers, or universals. But necessarily existing kinds of\nentity make trouble for the criterion: for any theory T, any\nworld at which T is true is a world whose domain contains\nnumbers. So any theory T is ontologically committed to\nnumbers, whether or not the content of T, intuitively, has\nanything to do with numbers. This suggests that we return to a Quinean\ncriterion that ties ontological commitment directly to the values of\nthe variables; numbers need not be values of the variables for a\ntheory T that has nothing to do with numbers. To make the\nvariable assignments relevant, we can quantify doubly over worlds and\nsub-domains of worlds. This leads to the modal quantifier\ncriterion:\n\nModal Quantifier Criterion.  A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, for every\nworld w and every sub-domain of the domain\nat w, T is true at w with its variables\nranging over that sub-domain only if that sub-domain contains at least\none K.\n\n(This criterion requires, in effect, that whenever a theory is true\nof some part of a world, considered in isolation, the theory\nis ontologically committed to Ks only if that part contains\nat least one K.)  The modal quantifier criterion takes care\nof the problem of irrelevant necessary existents. In effect, it\nintroduces a narrower modal entailment relation that is more\nsensitive to the content of T.  Only if T entails\nthe existence of Ks according to this narrower entailment\nrelation is T ontologically committed\nto Ks.[13]\nBut some less pressing objections remain that suggest that\nmetaphysical necessity is too blunt an instrument to capture the\nnotion of ontological commitment. Three will be mentioned here.\nFirst, just as extensional criteria could not distinguish between\nontological commitments to co-extensional kinds, the modal criteria\ncannot distinguish between ontological commitments to co-intensional\nkinds. A theory that is committed to triangular polygons will also be\ncommitted to trilateral polygons, and vice versa, because,\nnecessarily, a polygon is triangular if and only if it is\ntrilateral. A theory that is committed to round squares will also be\ncommitted to even prime numbers greater than two, and vice\nversa, because, necessarily, (it is vacuously true that)\nsomething is a round square if and only if it is an even prime number\ngreater than two. Second, metaphysically impossible theories, theories\nthat are true at no world, will be (vacuously) committed to every kind\nof entity. But that seems wrong: na\u00efve set theory is committed to\nsets, but not to angels that dance on the head of a pin. Third, the\nmodal criteria may introduce spurious commitment if there are\nmetaphysically necessary connections between distinct kinds of\nentity. For example, if whales are necessarily mammals, then a theory\ncommitted to whales would automatically be committed to mammals, even\nif the theory explicitly claims that there are no mammals and that\nwhales are fish. A theory committed to Hesperus would automatically be\ncommitted to Phosphorus, assuming the necessity of identity, even if\nthe theory explicitly claims that Hesperus exists and that Phosphorus\ndoesn't.\nAll of these objections to modal criteria for ontological\ncommitment have a common source: ontological commitment appears to be\nsensitive to distinctions that metaphysical necessity cannot\naccommodate. One solution, then, would be to seek a more\ndiscriminating entailment relation. Thus, the third objection\nsuggests that a priori entailment should replace\nmetaphysically modal entailment. In the modal quantifier criterion,\none could quantify over domains and sub-domains of worlds that\nare conceptually, rather than metaphysically,\npossible.[14]\nThat won't help with the first two objections, however, since the\nexistence of triangular polygons is a priori entailed by the\nexistence of trilateral polygons, and, assuming classical logic\nis a priori, the existence of angels (and everything else)\nis a priori entailed by na\u00efve set theory (or any\ninconsistent theory). For these, we can retreat further to some sort\nof relevant entailment relation within a paraconsistent logic. The\nquantifier criterion could be expressed by quantifying over domains\nand sub-domains of worlds that are both conceptually and\nmetaphysically\n impossible.[15]\n Alternatively, one could revert to an\nentailment account, since relevant entailment by itself can handle\nthe problem of irrelevant necessary existents. It is not the case\nthat any theory relevantly entails that numbers exist. \nPerhaps the retreat to a sufficiently weak entailment relation will\nresult in a workable criterion. Another response, however, holds the\nline at modal\n entailment.[16] \nIt claims that all the above objections\nare based on a confusion between the ontological commitments of a\ntheory and the ontological beliefs of someone who holds the theory.\nAlthough there needs to be some hyper-intensional notion of belief\naccording to which someone could believe that trilateral polygons\nexist without believing that triangular polygons exist, or believe\nthat na\u00efve set theory is true without believing that angels exist, or\nbelieve that whales are fish, we should not identify the ontological\ncommitments of a theory with the ontological beliefs of those that\naccept the theory. On this account, even an ideally rational person\nmight accept a theory without being able to determine its ontological\ncommitments. More worrisome, if the ontological commitments of\ntheories do not parallel the ontological beliefs of a person who\naccepts the theory, then the foundational role of ontological\ncommitment in theory choice will be diminished.
