    "main_text": "Can Collective Responsibility be Distributed?\n4. Can Collective Responsibility be Distributed?\n\nCollective responsibility refers to the responsibility of a\ncollective entity, e.g., a corporation, a nation state, or a club, for\nharm in the world. Shared responsibility refers to the\nresponsibility of group members for such harm in cases where they\nacted together to bring the harm about. Collective responsibility is\nassociated with a single, unified, moral agent. Shared responsibility\nis associated with individual moral agents who contribute to harm as\nmembers of a group either directly through their own actions or\nindirectly through their membership in the group.\n\nContemporary moral and political philosophers are generally careful to\ndistinguish between collective responsibility, on the one hand, and\nshared and individual responsibility, on the other. But they do not\nleave individual moral agents behind altogether. Indeed, after\nanalyzing collective responsibility as part of group morality, they\nfrequently place individual moral agents back at the center of their\nattention in an effort to discern what collective responsibility means\non the level of individual moral actors. Is it possible, they ask, for\nindividual members of a group to be collectively responsible for\ngroup-based harms in cases where they did not directly cause it? In\ncases where they did not do anything to stop it? If so, under what\nconditions?\n\nWhile those who answer these questions tend to focus on the\ntransferability of collective responsibility and its relationship to\nindividual moral agency in general, they do not ignore concrete\nhistorical examples in which the moral responsibility of particular\ngroups of individuals for harm is in question. Indeed, almost all of\nthose who write about collective responsibility and the question of\ndistribution place such concrete historical examples of harm at the\ncenter of their analyses of collective responsibility in an effort,\nnot just to understand collective responsibility as an abstract\nconstruct, but to discern whether or not particular groups of\nindividuals in history can be held morally responsible for harms that\ntheir groups caused, whether those groups are ethnic groups\n(\u201cGermans\u201d), nations (\u201cAmerica\u201d) or racial\ngroups (\u201cWhites\u201d).\n\nBoth Karl Jaspers (1961) and Hannah Arendt (1987), as well H. D. Lewis\n(1948), were clearly concerned in their writings on collective\nresponsibility about whether or not the German people can legitimately\nbe held collectively responsible for World War II Nazi crimes. So,\ntoo, were Sanford Levinson (1974), Richard Wasserstrom (1971) and\nothers who produced their own arguments about collective\nresponsibility in light of the Nuremberg trials. The My Lai killings\nof the Viet Nam War, along with the Kitty Genovese murder and\ncorporate scandals of all kinds, influenced much of the philosophical\nwork done on collective responsibility during the 1970s and 80s,\nincluding that of Peter French, Larry May, and Virginia Held, and\nwhile it is only recently that group-based oppression such as racism\nand sexism have come to be of interest to those writing on collective\nresponsibility, they now figure importantly in the writings of Larry\nMay (1987 and 1992), Howard McGary (1986), Marilyn Friedman (Friedman\nand May 1980), Anthony Appiah (1987), Derrick Darby and Nyla\nBranscombe (2012 and 2014), and Eva Boodman (2022).\n\nIn all of these discussions, the question is whether the whole\ncommunity\u2014or large parts of it\u2014can be held responsible for\nthe harms produced by particular group members in cases where not all\ngroup members caused the harm directly. Is it appropriate to hold all\nGermans responsible for the deaths of extermination camp victims\nduring WWII? all Americans for the atrocities of the Viet Nam War? Can\nwe legitimately blame all men for the gender-based oppression and\nsexual violence that women experience in all societies? Can we blame\nall whites for the racist treatment of blacks in the U.S.? What about\nmembers of these groups who go out of their way to stop the harm? Are\nthey excused from blame because they tried to reform their communities\nor are they, too, responsible for the harm in question by virtue of\ntheir group membership?\n\nWhile the arguments made in this context tend to be tied to particular\ncases of group-based harm, they are for the most part designed either\nto establish general criteria for distributing collective\nresponsibility among group members or to demonstrate that collective\nresponsibility cannot in the end be distributed at all. The latter\narguments frequently proceed as follows: While collective entities\ngenerally act through their individual members, their actions do not\ncoincide with their members\u2019 actions. Nor is their\nmoral agency merely the moral agency of their members or the moral\nagency of group representatives. Instead, such agency is\u2014if it\nis to be genuinely collective moral agency\u2014an agency\nthat is attached to the collective itself and hence not the kind of\nthing that can be distributed across group members or, for that\nmatter, attached to anything other than a collective itself. In other\nwords, such agency is the kind of thing that necessarily has\ncollectives, and not individuals, as its subject matter.\n\nPeter French makes such an argument himself in Individual and\nCollective Responsibility (1998). But he cautions that the\nnon-distributional character of collective responsibility does not\nmean that individual members of the group that is collectively\nresponsible for harm are themselves blameless. Indeed, he claims, many\nof these group members will be morally responsible for all sorts of\nharms that their group causes.\n\n[I]t should be noted that from \u2018Collectivity A is\nblameworthy for event n, and A is composed of\nx, y, and z,\u2019 it would be\npresumptuous to conclude that x, y, and z\ndo not warrant any blame for n, or that x,\ny, r z is not himself blameworthy in the\ncase of n. My point is that such judgments assessed on\nmembers of the collectivity do not follow necessarily from judgments\nof collective blame (French 1998, p. 25).\n\n\nThe above claim clearly makes sense if we are talking about keeping\ncollective responsibility in tact qua collective\nresponsibility in our efforts to ascribe it in practice. But we might\nwant to loosen things up here a bit and suggest that collective\nresponsibility is the basis upon which we ascribe\nresponsibility to individual group members for harm that the group\nitself caused. In other words, we might want to suggest that\nindividual group members can take collective responsibility into\nthemselves as persons, in which case collective responsibility changes\nform and becomes something closer to personal responsibility, albeit\npersonal responsibility that exists only because one\u2019s\ncollective is responsible for harm. In many cases, this is what those\nin philosophical circles who are concerned with the question of how to\ndistribute collective responsibility seem to have in mind. How do they\nattempt to distribute collective responsibility?\n\nIn The Question of German Guilt, Karl Jaspers (1961)\ndistinguishes between moral guilt that is based on what one does and\nmoral guilt that is based on who one is. He argues that the latter,\nwhich he calls \u201cmetaphysical guilt\u201d, can be distributed to\nall members of a community who stand by while their fellows produce\nharm, e.g., murder Jews. In this context, to be morally blameworthy\nfor harm is largely a matter of belonging to an \u201cevil\u201d\ncommunity without asserting one\u2019s own moral powers over the\ncommunity to cleanse it of such evil. According to Jaspers,\n\u201c[t]here exists a solidarity among men as human beings that\nmakes each as responsible for every wrong and every injustice in the\nworld, especially for crimes committed in his presence or with his\nknowledge. If I fail to do whatever I can do to prevent them, I too am\nguilty\u201d (Jaspers 1961, p. 36).\n\nJaspers has several contemporary followers, including Larry May and\nJuha Raikka (Raikka 1997), who choose to express Jaspers\u2019 notion\nof metaphysical guilt as \u201cmoral taint\u201d, a notion that\nemphasizes, among other things, the extent to which, in Anthony\nAppiah\u2019s terms, we are \u201cdirtied\u201d by association with\nour community\u2019s harmful actions. Appiah himself is very\nreluctant to apply the language of moral taint in general and does so\nonly in particular cases where there are strong causal connections\nbetween individuals and harm. May, on the other hand, finds moral\ntaint in many places and goes as far as to tout the utilitarian\nvirtues of distributing collective responsibility widely. According to\nMay, \u201cseeing one\u2019s own moral status as interrelated to\nthat of one\u2019s fellow group members will negate the tendency to\nignore the most serious moral evils: those which can only be thwarted\nby the collective efforts of the community\u201d (May 1987, p.\n253).\n\nMethodological and normative individualists tend to reject the notion\nof metaphysical guilt on two related grounds. The first is that it\nsevers the link between responsibility and control, especially in\ncases where the group membership being invoked is one that individuals\ncannot possibly choose, e.g., membership in racial, ethnic or national\ncommunities (For a very interesting assessment of this claim, see:\nRadzik 2001). The second is that the metaphysical notion of guilt\nviolates the liberal ethic of what Rawls calls the \u201cseparateness\nof persons\u201d. According to Rawls, in ascribing responsibility we\nhave to consider persons separately and focus on their own actions so\nas not to violate principles of justice, principles of justice that\nfor Rawls themselves begin with the value of discrete individuals\n(Rawls 1971).\n\nWhile not all liberal individualists agree with Rawls\u2019\nparticular claims here, they do agree with Rawls that, at the very\nleast, individual group members have to be faulty in some way in order\nto be held collectively responsible for harm. Joel Feinberg\u2019s\ntheory of group liability is often taken as a starting point of\ndiscussion in this context. According to Feinberg, in distributing\ncollective responsibility, we need to focus on two kinds of cases:\ncases in which all members of a collective share the same fault or\ncases in which all members of a collective contribute to harm but at\ndifferent levels. In both kinds of cases, Feinberg stresses, there\ndoes not need be a direct link between the individual being held\nresponsible and the harm, but there does need to be the sharing of\nfaultiness.\n\nVarious faults can exist in the absence of any causal linkage to harm,\nwhere that absence is only a lucky accident reflecting no credit on\nthe person who is at fault. Where every member of a group shares the\nsame fault, but only one member\u2019s fault leads to any harm, and\nthat not because it was more of a fault than that of others, but only\nbecause of independent fortuities, many will be inclined to ascribe\ncollective liability to the whole group (Feinberg 1968, p. 687).\n\n\nFeinberg himself is willing to ascribe collective responsibility to\ngroup members for such harm in some cases, although, he makes clear,\nin doing so we need to shift our attention away from strict liability\nto a softer kind of social blame on grounds of fairness. He concerns\nhimself with three kinds of cases in particular, namely, those in\nwhich large numbers of individuals are independently at fault; those\nin which the harm is caused by a joint undertaking of numerous persons\nacting cooperatively, and those in which the harm is ascribed to a\nparticular feature of the common culture which is self-consciously\naccepted by or participated in by members of the group. Feinberg is\nwilling to accept the possibility of ascribing collective\nresponsibility in all three kinds of cases. But he cautions that we\nneed to proceed on a situation-by-situation basis, since to ascribe\ncollective responsibility in cases such as these requires not only\nthat we locate genuinely shared faults but assess various\nincommensurable dimensions of individual contributions, including\ndegrees of initiative, importance of assigned task, levels of\nauthority, etc.\n\nGregory Mellema (2006) provides a very useful way of assessing\ndifferent levels of individual contribution by distinguishing between\nsix different ways in which individuals can be complicit in\nwrong-doing. According to Mellema, individuals can induce or command\nothers to produce harm. They can counsel others to produce harm. They\ncan give consent to the production of harm by others. They can praise\nthese others when they produce the harm. They can fail to stop them\nfrom producing it.\n\nA second way of tackling the distribution question in this context\nthat does not seem to violate the principle of individual freedom is\nto look, not just at the particular role that individuals played in\ntheir community\u2019s production of harm, but at how much freedom\nthe individuals had to distance themselves from the community that has\ndone wrong. Here we might want to use voluntariness of membership as a\ncriterion of responsibility. Jan Narveson (2002) does so himself in\nhis generally skeptical work on collective responsibility. Narveson\nargues that in thinking about the responsibility of individuals for\ngroup harms we need to be careful to distinguish between four\ndifferent kinds of groups, namely: those that are fully voluntary;\nthose that are involuntary in entrance but voluntary in exit; those\nthat are voluntary in entrance but involuntary in exit; and those that\nare voluntary in neither respect. As Narveson makes clear,\nresponsibility is diminished, if not eradicated, as we go down this\nlist.\n\nNarveson clearly takes an individualistic perspective here. Hence, he\nis able to address the questions of individual freedom and personal\nresponsibility with relative ease. Not surprisingly, things get\nsomewhat more complicated when we start to think about individuals,\nnot only as participating in groups, but as taking their identity from\ngroups. Karen Kovach (2006) contends that in some cases, individuals\nalign themselves with their groups\u2014Kovach is concerned with\nethnic groups in particular\u2014to the extent that they see the\ngroup\u2019s agency as an extension of their own. In these cases,\nKovach contends, we can distribute collective moral responsibility to\nall members of the group because of what she calls \u201cmoral\nalignment\u201d.\n\n\u201cMoral alignment\u201d cannot of course be a simple matter of\nidentification if it is to sustain collective moral responsibility.\nFor, identification does not implicate an individual in either the\nintentions or the actions of the group with which she identifies.\nHence, Kovach finds it necessary to insist that if individuals are to\nbe held collectively responsible for group harms that they be\nunderstood as having \u201cacted out the view of themselves as group\nmembers\u201d or as having \u201cperformed\u201d the group\nidentity.\n\nWhile such an insistence goes far in showing how collective\nresponsibility might be distributed to all members of a group for harm\nthat the group produced in particular cases, e.g., in cases such as\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing where ethnic identity is everything, it\nis not clear that the responsibility in question is the kind that we\nnormally associate with moral responsibility. For, while \u201cacting\nout\u201d or \u201cperforming\u201d a group identity may contribute\nto harm in cases such as these, it is not the same thing as\ndoing something that contributes to that harm. In other\nwords, it does not signal moral agency\u2014unless one asserts\none\u2019s identity knowing that it will lead to harming others, in\nwhich case it is the act of assertion, not identification, that is\ndoing the work here.\n\nInterestingly enough, one of the major points of agreement among those\nnow writing about collective responsibility is that responsibility\ncannot be distributed to those group members who openly resist or\nfight against their communities\u2019 bad actions or policies. See\nhere, for example, the arguments of Joel Feinberg (1968), Peter French\n(1998), Howard McGary (1986), J. R. Lucas (1993), and Michele\nMoody-Adams (1994). While the above writers, who find collective\nresponsibility to be a compelling moral construct in general, differ\nin particular respects, they all agree that it would be wrong to\nascribe responsibility to dissenters or, in other words, that if one\ntries to fight harm one should not be held responsible for it. McGary\nmakes his own claim here in terms of what he calls the\n\u201cdissociation condition\u201d, according to which a person is\nexempt from collective responsibility in cases where one\u2019s\ncommunity caused harm if he or she dissociates him or herself from the\naction of the community by opposing its bad actions or policies\n(McGary 1986).\n\nBut there are some who do call for the distribution of collective\nresponsibility to individuals even in cases where these individuals\nactively opposed their community\u2019s wrong doings. Juha Raikka,\nfor example, claims that the only way that opposition can exonerate\nthose who, say, live in a society that systematically pollutes the\nenvironment or depletes resources, is if they are able, by dissenting,\nto avoid supporting the system that does these things (a condition\nthat, Raikka acknowledges, is very hard to meet). According to\nRaikka,\n\n[o]pposing an evil practice cleans one\u2019s hands only on the\ncondition that it does not require supporting another evil practice.\n\u2026 In the end, even those who oppose evil practices may be\nblameworthy for those practices. A single member of a group may have\nacted as he or she, all things considered, ought to have acted, but\nstill share responsibility for the group\u2019s evil practices.\n(Raikka 1997, p.104.)\n\n\nRaikka claims in this context that dissenters can be morally\nblameworthy even if they cannot control the system that implicates\nthem in evil. Hence, he finds it necessary to do two things that not\nonly place him squarely in the camp of Karl Jaspers and other\nadvocates of metaphysical guilt but that are very telling with respect\nto contemporary philosophical debates about collective responsibility\nin general. The first is to subtract from the set of conventionally\ninvoked criteria of collective responsibility a criterion that the\nmajority of those now writing about collective responsibility take\nvery seriously, namely, the ability of individuals to control those\nthings (whether actions or harms) for which they are being blamed. The\nsecond is to detach moral blameworthiness from the will of discrete\nindividuals (where traditional, Kantian notions of agency place it)\nand to locate its source in the greater community of which the\nindividuals deemed guilty are ostensibly a part.\n\nBoth of these moves force us to acknowledge that, in the end, the\nvarious differences that exist among contemporary philosophers with\nrespect to the coherence and applicability of collective\nresponsibility as a construct have their source, not just in competing\ntheories of intentions and actions, but also in competing notions of\nmoral blameworthiness. While neither defenders nor critics of\ncollective responsibility generally take on the nature of the moral\nblameworthiness that they put at the center of our attention, they do\nmake clear that for some of them the traditional, Kantian standards of\nmoral blameworthiness still prevail and that for others the\nappropriate standards of moral blameworthiness take us beyond the\nwills of discrete individuals to the structure of guilty\ncommunities.\n",
