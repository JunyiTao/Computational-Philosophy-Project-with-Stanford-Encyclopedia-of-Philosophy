    "main_text": "Haecceity in Duns Scotus\n3. Haecceity in Duns Scotus\n\nCommon natures have non-numerical unity, and are thus in the relevant\nsense divisible. As Scotus sees it, the fundamental issue to be\nexplained by haecceity is that of indivisibility: what is it about\nindividuals that makes them indivisible into subjective parts, in\ncontrast to the divisibility of the common nature:\n\nI explain what I understand by individuation or numerical unity or\nsingularity: Certainly not the indeterminate unity by which anything\nin a species is said to be one in number. Rather, I mean designated\nunity as a this, so that just as it was said above that an\nindividual is incompossible with being divided into subjective parts\nand the reason for that incompossibility is asked there, so too I say\nhere that an individual is incompossible with not being a designated\nthis by this singularity and the cause is asked not of\nsingularity in general but of this designated singularity in\nparticular \u2013 that is, as it is determinately this.\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 76 (Scotus [OO],\n7:426\u2013427; Spade (1994), 76); see too q. 2, n. 48 [Scotus\n(1950\u2013), 7:412\u2013413]; qq. 5\u20136, n. 165 (Scotus [OO],\n7:473))\n\n\nThe point is not just that an account of numerical singularity in\ngeneral is required (the \u201cindeterminate unity by which anything\nin a species is said to be one in number\u201d). What is required,\nrather, is an account of the individuality of any given particular,\nand this account will explain its being indivisible into subjective\nparts. (Scotus does not use the term \u2018haecceity\u2019\n[haecceitas] in the work that I am using here \u2013 the\nOrdinatio. He talks rather about the individual difference,\nor individual entity. But he does elsewhere talk about this entity as\na haecceitas [a term of Scotus\u2019s own invention]: for the\nchange in terminology, see Dumont [1995]).\n\nDivisibility into subjective parts, of course, is on the face of it\nvery different from the question of division from all other things, so\nnicely exemplified in Black\u2019s example of the qualitatively identical\nspheres. Scotus\u2019s assumption, however, is that both questions can be\nanswered in the same way. Thus Scotus supposes that the explanation\nfor distinction is the explanation for indivisibility, and the rough\noutline of what he is thinking looks as follows. The explanation for\ndistinction is primary, in the sense that what distinction needs is\nexplanation by items (haecceities) that are irreducibly numerically\ndistinct from each other \u2013 as Scotus puts it, \u201cprimarily\ndiverse\u201d (primo diversa) \u2013 and have nothing real\nwhatever in common: \u201cthey agree in nothing the same\u201d\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 186\n(Scotus [OO], 7:483; Spade (1994), 106)). (This does not entail that\nthe things thus distinguished, as opposed to the haecceities that\ndistinguish these things, have nothing whatever in common.\nScotus\u2019s point is that the haecceity is needed as a constituent\nof a being that shares its nature with something else in the manner\ndescribed in the previous section.) According to Scotus, merely\nnumerical distinction \u2013 as opposed to (say) specific distinction\n\u2013 entails that each of the things distinguished has numerical\nsingularity. And numerical singularity entails indivisibility (into\nsubjective parts), for what allows a common nature to be divided (into\nsubjective parts) is its possession of less-than-numerical unity.\n\nThe claim that the explanations for indivisibility and distinction are\nthe same gains some plausibility from an analogy with the distinction\nbetween different specific differences in relation to a genus \u2013\nan analogue that Scotus evidently regards as less controversial, and\nmore familiar to his readers. A specific difference distinguishes two\ndifferent species of a genus from each other. A specific difference is\nsomething indivisible in such a way that is explanatory of a species\u2019s\nindivisibility into further species (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d.\n3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 177 (Scotus [OO], 7:478; Spade (1994),\n103\u2013104)). Equally, an ultimate specific difference is\n\u201cprimarily diverse\u201d from any other, in the sense that such\na specific difference \u201chas a concept that is absolutely\nsimple\u201d (and thus cannot even overlap with the concept of any\nother such difference) (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq.\n5\u20136, n. 183 (Scotus [OO], 7:481; Spade (1994), 105)). It does\nnot seem overly puzzling that a specific difference could perform\nthese two functions: the absolute conceptual simplicity of any\nultimate specific difference seems to entail both distinction from\nevery other specific difference, and its possessing the relevant sort\nof indivisibility. And Scotus believes that these sorts of\nconsideration can help explicate the function of a haecceity relative\nto individuation too. That is to say, he believes that something\nwholly devoid of common (shared) content \u2013 a haecceity \u2013\ncan explain not only indivisibility into further particulars, but also\ndistinction from all other particulars (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 177 (Scotus [OO], 7:478; Spade (1994),\n103\u2013104); n. 183 (Scotus [OO], 7:481; Spade (1994), 105)).\n\nSo Scotus holds that the explanations for indivisibility and\ndistinction are the same. To understand why he supposes that this\nexplanation needs to be something real, we need to keep in mind his\naccount of the reality of common natures, outlined in the previous\nsection, for the reality of common natures is a premise in\nScotus\u2019s defense of the existence of haecceities. Since such\nnatures are real, Scotus reasons, the haecceities that tie such\nnatures to individuals must be equally real too:\n\nJust as unity in common follows per se on some entity in\ncommon, so too does any unity follow per se on some entity or\nother. Therefore, absolute unity (like the unity of an individual\n\u2026 that is, a unity with which division into several subjective\nparts is incompatible and with which not being a designated\nthis is incompatible), if it is found in beings (as every\ntheory assumes), follows per se on some per se\nentity. But it does not follow per se on the entity of the\nnature, because that has a certain per se real unity of its\nown, as was proved\u2026. Therefore, it follows on some other entity\nthat determines this one. And that other entity makes up something\nper se one with the entity of the nature, because the whole\nto which this unity belongs is perfect of itself. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 169 (Scotus [OO],\n7:474\u2013475; Spade (1994), 101))\n\n\nAnd later Scotus notes that it \u201cdoes not seem probable\u201d\nthat the common nature has some kind of entity and yet that the\nindividuating feature does not. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 178 (Scotus [OO], 7:478\u2013479; Spade\n(1994), 104))\n\nScotus elsewhere considers the view of Henry of Ghent that the\nexplanation for individuation could be merely a negation. The point\nabout a negation is that it is not in any way real: it is not\na thing, or a real form or property of a thing. As Scotus sees it,\nclaiming that individuation could be by a negation is just a way of\nrestating the problem, not of proposing an explanatory solution to it\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 2, n. 49 (Scotus [OO],\n7:413; Spade (1994), 69)). In fact, Scotus takes himself to have not\nmerely an explanation for individuation, but also an explanation for\nidentity. The contrast with modern accounts of haecceities is thus\nquite sharp. In much modern literature, an item\u2019s haecceity is simply\nthe primitive property of being that item, or being identical with\nthat item. For Scotus, the haecceity is supposed to explain\nthat property. (See further discussion of this in section 6\nbelow.)\n\nSupposing that a haecceity is something real, where does it fit into\nthe range of things that there are? Is it, for example, a form, or\nsomething else? According to Scotus, it is something like a form, and\nsometimes, indeed, he calls it such (while elsewhere denying the same\nclaim: on these insignificant terminological shifts, see Dumont\n[1995]). The reason is that a haecceity is clearly something like a\nproperty of a thing \u2013 hence like a form \u2013 but is at the\nsame time wholly devoid of any correspondence to any conceptual\ncontents. It is not at all a qualitative feature of a thing \u2013\nnot at all a \u201cquidditative\u201d feature, in the technical\nvocabulary. As irreducibly particular, it shares no real feature in\ncommon with any other thing. This does not mean that haecceities\ncannot fall under the extension of a concept. Being an\nindividuating feature is not a real property of a haecceity (it\ncannot be, since any haecceity is wholly simple, and shares no real\nfeatures with any other thing); but any concept of what a haecceity is\ncertainly includes among its components being an individuating\nfeature. A concept of a haecceity includes representations merely\nof logical, not real, features of any haecceity.\n\nScotus\u2019s position on the reality of both the nature and the haecceity\nseems to raise a number of problems. Perhaps the most acute \u2013 a\nproblem which Scotus himself raises \u2013 is this:\n\nIf there is some real unity less than numerical unity, it belongs to\nsomething that is either in what is numerically the same or in\nsomething else. Not in what is numerically the same, because whatever\nis numerically the same is numerically one. Neither is it in two,\nbecause there is nothing really one in those two. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 171 (Scotus [OO],\n7:476; Spade (1994), 102))\n\n\nThis is what has come to be known as Ockham\u2019s problem (see King\n[1992], 51): how can the nature as instantiated retain its\nnon-numerical unity? Scotus\u2019s apparent solution is that the nature in\nitself has non-numerical unity, but that as existent in particulars it\nhas, in each particular, numerical unity. Scotus thus \u2013\nconsistent with his basic insight \u2013 believes that the nature has\ntwo different sorts of extramental entity:\n\nIn the same item that is one in number there is some kind of entity\nfrom which there follows a unity less than numerical unity is. Such\nunity [viz. less-than-numerical] is real, and what such unity belongs\nto is of itself formally one by numerical unity. I grant therefore\nthat this real unity [viz. less-than-numerical] does not belong to\nanything existing in two individuals, but in one. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 172 (Scotus [OO],\n7:476; Spade (1994), 102))\n\n\nScotus explains his position by exploiting the analogy between a\nhaecceity or individual difference, and a specific difference:\n\nColor in whiteness is specifically one, but it is not so of itself or\nper se or primarily but only denominatively. But a specific\ndifference is primarily one, because it is primarily incompatible with\nit to be divided into what are several in species. Whiteness is\nspecifically one per se but not primarily, because it is\nspecifically one through something intrinsic to it (for example,\nthrough the difference). So I grant that whatever is in this stone is\nnumerically one, either primarily or per se or\ndenominatively. Primarily, say, as that through which such a unity\nbelongs to this composite. Per se, the stone itself, of which\nwhat is primarily one with this unity is a per se part. Only\ndenominatively, what is potential and is perfected by the actual and\nis so to speak denominatively related to its actuality. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, nn. 174\u2013175\n(Scotus [OO], 7:477\u2013478; Spade (1994), 103))\n\n\nThere are three things here: the nature in the particular, the\nhaecceity, and the particular itself. Each of these is numerically one\n(and thus numerically distinct from the corrrelative items in any\nother particular). The haecceity is \u2018primarily\u2019 numerically one,\nbecause its numerical unity is a basic feature of its. The particular\nis per se numerically one because it includes the component\nin virtue of which it is numerically one. The nature in the particular\nis denominatively numerically one. Denominative predication obtains in\nthe case that the predicate is true of the subject as the result of\nthe subject\u2019s possession of some further, accidental, feature. Thus,\nqualifying the predication as \u201cdenominative\u201d in this way\ndoes not make the predication any less real. Being accidentally\nnumerically one is a case of being numerically one, not of being\nnon-numerically one, and what Scotus is really trying to say is that\nthe nature in this particular is indeed really (though\naccidentally) numerically one. Note that the denominative numerical\nsingularity of the nature in the particular is still compatible with\nthe common nature\u2019s being numerically one in some other particular,\nand this is because the nature in itself (not as in this or that\nparticular) is less-than-numerically one (Scotus, Ordinatio\nII, d. 3, p. 1, q. 1, n. 34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404\u2013405; Spade (1994),\n64)).\n\nBeing non-numerically one, then, is compatible with being accidentally\nnumerically one in any one instantiation. But a problem immediately\narises: is being non-numerically one compatible with being\naccidentally numerically many in many instantiations? On the one hand,\nthinking this seems a natural way of understanding the theory, given\nits realist character; on the other, we have just seen Scotus deny\nthat this kind of unity belongs \u201cto anything existing in two\nindividuals.\u201d Perhaps we should say that the nature is really in\nmany individuals, but does not \u201cexist\u201d in many individuals,\nsince existence is precisely a property of concrete particulars.\nElsewhere, indeed, Scotus draws an analogy with the Christian doctrine\nof the Trinity, according to which there is numerically one nature\nshared by three distinct persons (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 1, n. 39 (Scotus [OO], 7:408; Spade (1994), 44)). And this\nsuggests, contrariwise, that just as something numerically one is in\nthree persons, so something with less-than-numerical unity is in many\nindividuals. Perhaps there are just no principled rules for counting\nitems with less-than-numerical unity. (For an excellent discussion of\nsome of these problems, see Paasch (2014).)\n\nWe run into an analogous problem with the question of the common\nnature\u2019s entity. Scotus persistently refuses to reduce it to the\nentity of the particulars to which it belongs: as we saw in the\nprevious section, this entity \u201chas true real being outside the\nsoul.\u201d But it nevertheless somehow belongs to the entity of the\nparticulars: as we have just seen, \u201cSuch unity [viz.\nless-than-numerical] is real, and what such unity belongs to is of\nitself formally one by numerical unity.\u201d Setting aside the\nparticular and the haecceity, we might wonder how many entities there\nare. Perhaps the entity of the common nature is nothing over and above\nthe entity of the nature in the particular. But perhaps not. So it\nseems to me that it is hard to come to an assessment of the strength\nof Scotus\u2019s realism, since it is hard to come to an appraisal of his\nview on the reality of the common nature.\n\nI have spoken about consituents in this context: the nature in the\nparticular and the haecceity are in effect constituents of the\nparticular. So there must be some kind of distinction between them.\nThis distinction cannot be real, since according to Scotus real\ndistinction requires separability, and the features are not separable\nfrom each other any more than they are separable from themselves.\nNeither are they anything like discrete parts of some whole. They are,\nas Scotus puts it, \u201cformally distinct\u201d:\n\nThis individual entity is not matter or form of the composite,\ninasmuch as each of these is a nature. Rather, it is the ultimate\nreality of the being that is matter or that is form or that is the\ncomposite. Thus whatever is common and yet determinable can still be\ndistinguished (no matter how much it is one thing) into several\nformally distinct realities of which this one is not formally that\none. This one is formally the entity of singularity and that one is\nformally the entity of the nature. These two realities cannot be\ndistinguished as thing and thing. \u2026 Rather\nwhen in the same thing, whether in a part or in the whole, they are\nalways formally distinct realities of the same thing. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 188 (Scotus [OO],\n7:483\u2013484; Spade (1994), 107))\n\n\nThe formal distinction in this context is fundamentally a way of\ndistinguishing the necessary properties of a particular substance, in\ncases where the natures of which the substances are instantiations are\nnot coextensive. Given this, what sort of relation \u201cties\u201d\nthese two formally distinct components together? Scotus suggests that\nthis relation is real (i.e. numerical) sameness, a kind of unity\nfalling short of absolute identity (Scotus, Ordinatio I, d.\n2, p. 2, qq. 1\u20134, n. 403 (Scotus [OO], 2:356)). This sameness is\npresumably something rather like the relation of compresence found in\nRussell and others, though unlike compresence, real sameness is not\nonly symmetrical but also transitive (see Tweedale [1999],\n2:463\u2013464). Scotus is able to claim transitivity for the\nrelation of real sameness since, as we have seen, he believes that the\ncommon nature instantiated in two distinct particulars does not itself\nhave real (i.e. numerical) identity (see Tweedale [1999], 488). The\nhaeeceity and the nature in the particular can thus be really the same\nwithout different concrete particulars of the same kind being really\nthe same as each other.\n\nWhat should we say about the indiscernibility of identicals in these\nkinds of case (real identity, formal distinction)? Haecceities explain\nthe identity of the complete concrete objects that they compose. So\ncomplete concrete objects have self-identity. So too does each of the\nformalities that compose such a concrete object. But these formalities\nare discernible from each other. Real sameness falls short of absolute\nidentity. (I discuss some of these issues, and others related to the\nvarieties of distinction in Scotus, in Cross [2019].)\n\nGiven the huge problems that an account of haecceities seems to raise,\nit is worth seeing just why Scotus believes he needs to accept this\nview of individuation as opposed to a rival one. Scotus defends\nhaecceities by rejecting all alternative theories of individuation\nknown to him. Rejecting qualitative theories is easy for the\nscholastics. Suppose that all things of a given kind in some sense\nshare the same nature. The nature as such cannot explain\nindividuation. So the explanation must be somehow non-essential. But\nnon-essential qualitative or accidental features of a thing are\nposterior to the thing itself, since although the substance must have\nsome accidental features, precisely which ones it has is a matter of\nhistorical chance (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n.\n87 (Scotus [OO], 7:432\u2013433; Spade (1994), 79)). Things are not\nidentical with their life-stories (on this, see Cross [1999b]).\nIndeed, Scotus goes so far as to suggest that the accidents of a\nsubstance \u2013 at least, its quantities, qualities, and relations\n\u2013 are individuated by their own haecceities, something that is\nnot often spotted in the commentaries (on this, see Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 89 (Scotus [OO], 7:434;\nSpade (1994), 79\u201380)). The great 17th century Scotist, John\nPoncius, extends this claim to cover even so-called propria,\nnecessary but non-defining properties: paradigmatically, a capacity to\nsmile in human beings (see Poncius, Disputatio Metaphysica\nVI, q. 9 [Poncius (1659), 138b]).\n\nBut this far from exhausts the options, and Scotus considers a number\nof non-qualitative theories too. In addition to the two theories\ndiscussed above, to the effect that things just are individuals\n(either through the nature itself, or through the negation of\ndivision), he considers a view according to which existence\nindividuates, and two views according to which the explanation for\nindividuation is matter, respectively matter as such, and matter +\nextension. Actual existence, perhaps a prima facie plausible\nnon-qualitative or non-essential feature of a thing, is rejected by\nScotus as an individuator on the grounds that existence as such\n\u2013 as opposed to the things that exist \u2013 does not seem to\nbe different from case to case: in itself, it seems wholly\nundifferentiated (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 3, n.\n61 (Scotus [OO], 7:418\u2013419; Spade (1994), 72\u201373)). Nothing\nabout existence seems irreducibly particular in the way required.\nIndeed, Scotus supposes that there is a sense in which existence is\nposterior to the haecceity: the whole hierarchy of division into\nindividuals is antecedent to questions of those individuals\u2019 existence\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q, 3, n. 65 (Scotus [OO],\n7:420; Spade (1994), 73\u201374). But that is another story.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting non-qualitative approach is the theory,\noften associated with Aquinas (but attacked by Scotus in the forms\npresented by Godfrey of Fontaines and Giles of Rome), that\nindividuation is by extended matter: by, as we might say,\nchunks of matter. Scotus\u2019s way of understanding the problem\nof individuation becomes important in his rejection of this theory.\nFor his fundamental strategy against this sort of material\nindividuation is that such a theory, while it may be able to explain\nnumerical distinction, certainly cannot explain indivisibility:\n\nQuantity is not the reason for divisibility into individuals\u2026.\nFor a universal whole, which is divided into individuals and into\nsubjective parts, is predicated of each of those subjective parts in\nsuch a way that each subjective part is it. But the quantitative parts\ninto which a continuous whole is divided never admit of the\npredication of the whole that is divided into them. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 106 (Scotus [OO], 7:443;\nSpade (1994), 85))\n\n\n(The \u2018whole\u2019 here is not water as such, taking \u2018water\u2019 as a mass term;\nit is the individual body of water, with which no proper part of the\nbody is identical.) Scotus has other arguments too, most notably\nvariants of the theme that the same chunk of matter (matter +\nextension) seems to persist through substantial change, and thus not\nto be sufficient as an account of individuation (see Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, nn. 77\u201381 (Scotus [OO],\n7:427\u2013429; Spade (1994), 77)). Individuation on Scotus\u2019s\nview is not, fundamentally, a case of instantiating forms in\n matter\n\n",
