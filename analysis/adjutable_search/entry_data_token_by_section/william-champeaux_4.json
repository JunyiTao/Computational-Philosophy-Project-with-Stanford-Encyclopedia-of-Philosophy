    "main_text": "Logic and the Philosophy of Language || Modality\n3.4 Modality\n\n\nAbelard reports that William thought that all modality was de\ndicto (or, in Abelard's terminology, de sensu)\n\n\nOur teacher taught that modal sentences descend from simple sentences\nbecause modal sentences are about the sense of simple sentences. So\nthat when we say \u2018It is possible (or necessary) that Socrates\nruns\u2019, we are saying that what the sentence \u2018Socrates\nruns\u2019 says is possible or necessary. (Abelard D 195.21; see also\nMews 2005: 49; Knuuttila 1993: 87; Kneale and Kneale 1962:\n212).\n\n The extent to which this attribution is accurate is unclear. The view\nis at least superficially inconsistent with William's realism and\nanti-vocalism in all other areas. Additionally, Abelard was among the\nfirst to recognize the importance of the de dicto / de\nre distinction; the issue may be fairly confused in William's\nwork, as it was in many others. On the other hand, several anonymous\ntexts attribute to William the claim that \u2018possibly\u2019 and\nother modal terms modify the signification of other words in a\nsentence. Thus, \u2018bishop\u2019 signifies actual and existing\nbishops, but \u2018possible bishop\u2019 has a figurative sense\nsignifying all those things whose nature is not repugnant with being a\nbishop (Iwakuma 1999: 112). This is not necessarily a rejection of\nde re modality, but again, more of William's work needs to be\nstudied.\n",
