    "main_text": "Xunzi\u2019s Confucian Appropriation of Mohist Logic\n5. Xunzi\u2019s Confucian Appropriation of Mohist Logic\n\nSignificantly more so than other major philosophers of the Warring\nStates Period, the Mohists believed that proper ethical conduct, and\nthe uses of language essential to its realization, could be determined\nby the ability of the common citizen to distinguish, independently of\ngovernment authority and by rational means, real similarities and\ndifferences in the nuances of ethical action. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nskeptical arguments called much of this belief into question, but left\nlittle in its place to placate the demands of effective governance and\norderly rule. The Confucian philosopher Xunzi of the late Warring\nStates Period sought to reestablish ethics on positive, constructive\nfoundations, but without succumbing to the frustrating Daoist\nrejoinders that put so much of Mohism in doubt.\n\nOn the surface, Xunzi\u2019s theories of logic and language resemble\nthose of the Mohists, and he makes great use of the doctrines of the\nMohist Canons to develop his own arguments. But underneath we\nfind Confucian presuppositions that diverge radically from the Mohist\nparadigm. Zhuangzi seized on indexicality to make the case that names\ncannot be used invariably across linguistic contexts. Reacting to the\nproblematic task of identifying impeccable salience conditions in\nperception or thought to determine how a name is to be used, Xunzi put\nZhuangzi\u2019s arguments to use to make the case that the\ncorrectness conditions of language, if there are to be any at all,\nmust be determined by convention. Since these conventions are\nultimately arbitrary, they cannot be established by the Mohists\u2019\nmethods of discourse or argumentation. They have to be determined by\nauthority, the rule of sage-kings who institute the conventions of\nlanguage as they deem fit through the promotion of proper social\nconduct and the suppression of deviant behavior.\n\nXunzi thus reasserted the Confucian tradition of imposing order onto\nsociety through uncompromising but benevolent rule to ensure that the\nanarchy of moral discourse that abounds in its absence does not\nculminate in the deterioration of civil society. He held these views\nnot merely because they offered a pragmatic solution to\nZhuangzi\u2019s radical skepticism, but also because they were\nconsistent with his cynical view of human nature. Our nature is\ninherently corruptible and bad, incapable of sustaining civil order if\nleft to itself, and therefore demands correction by the institutions\nof society. More generally, and quite against the convictions of his\nDaoist counterparts, Xunzi held that morality is an invention to\ncontrol man\u2019s nature, because nature itself, in its endless\ntransformations and unpredictable spontaneity, cannot be relied on to\nconstrain human passion sufficiently to maintain the requisites of\nsocial harmony.\n\nIn practice, Xunzi\u2019s philosophical method follows much the same\ncourse as the Mohists\u2019. He takes it upon himself to analyze the\n\u201cpurpose of having names\u201d, the \u201cevidence for\nassimilating and differentiating\u201d, and the \u201cbasic\nrequirements for instituting names\u201d (Xunzi, Book 22).\nHowever, for Xunzi, reason must stop short of justifying what actions\nmay serve as models for ethical conduct. The Mohists held that an\naction is admissible if it accords with general considerations of\nutility. This makes the justification of the action contingent on the\ncircumstances surrounding the action\u2019s consequences, whether\nthey lead to the enrichment of society, and whether they contribute to\nthe realization of the principle of universal love. Determining\nwhether the action is justified thus prescribes the use of reason\nindependently of judgments of authority. In Xunzi\u2019s view, this\nappeal to utility implies a use of reason that his own ethics would\nforbid, because the actions of a sage are not to be justified by\nanything independently of their intrinsic moral authority. Since the\ncustoms instituted by the sage are essentially stipulated as models of\nappropriate conduct, reason plays no role in their identification as\nsuch to the common individual.\n\nNotably, the hypostasization of the notion of a model of ethical\nconduct (fa) in early Chinese thought is largely a\ncontribution of the Mohists, who used it liberally in place of the\nConfucian appeal to the authority of tradition. But Xunzi found little\nuse for it except in reference to the very Confucian customs the\nMohists attempted to supplant. Indeed, the reason of the common\nindividual is out of place here because the ability to correctly\nidentify these models is a talent requiring years of cultivation and\nmastery, which only the intellectual elites of society would be\nexpected to attain. Proper conduct must be transmitted through\neducation from these elites, ultimately from those in high office who\nhave the benefit of a life of education in proper governance.\n\nSuch presuppositions have important ramifications in Xunzi\u2019s\ntheories of naming and reference. Acts of naming are decided not by\nreason, but by convention, and Xunzi attributes the authority to\nestablish these conventions to the sage-kings of later antiquity:\n\n\nAs for the names established by the later kings, for names of\npunishments follow the Shang dynasty, for names of titles the Chou,\nfor cultural names the ceremonies\u2026 (Xunzi, Book\n22)\n\n\nCommon people are prohibited from questioning the mandates of\nlinguistic conventions:\n\n\nHence hair-splitting wordings and invention of names on your own\nauthority, to disorder correct names and put people in doubt and\nconfusion, multiplying argument and litigation between persons, are to\nbe pronounced the worst of subversions, to be condemned like the crime\nof falsifying tallies and measures. (Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nXunzi avoids one of his own subversions by restricting his task to\nfiguring out how the conventions established by authority can serve as\nexamples for the common citizen, and this requires (much as the\nMohists thought) identifying the conditions by which one extends the\nnames so designated to other objects or actions that are appropriately\nsimilar to them.\n\nIt is in this matter that our common reason plays its critical role,\nwhich Xunzi understands in terms of our capacity to use the evidence\nof perception to make appropriate discriminations. For example, one\nsees two shapes, one triangular, the other square. Nothing in this\ndifferentiation of patterns forces one to attribute the name\n\u201ctriangular\u201d to the first and \u201csquare\u201d to the\nsecond. A single name could just as well be used for all three and\nfour sided polygons. However, the senses have the effect of\nencouraging a distinct name for each; they are \u201cevidence\u201d\n(yuan, causes, means) for assimilating and differentiating\nobjects in language. For instance, one may regard the assertion\n\u201cMountains and abysses are level\u201d as inadmissible (or\nfalse), because it is contradicted by our perception of the non-level\nrelation of the two geographical objects. This is the case, for Xunzi,\neven though it is convention, in the final analysis, that determines\nhow the terms \u201cmountain\u201d and \u201cabyss\u201d are to be\nused. Xunzi\u2019s point is not that the analysis of meanings somehow\nfixes how the terms of language are to be used, but that when\nconvention does \u201cfix ahead\u201d (qi) the meanings of\nthese terms, one is to use the senses to determine whether the objects\nto which they refer are to be treated as the same or different.\n\nXunzi\u2019s insistence that convention is at the bottom of all acts\nof naming gave him the liberty to favor simple, commonsense solutions\nto semantic puzzles that aroused such contention among the disputants\nof other schools. Recall that the Mohists argued that while robbers\nare people, it does not follow that \u201ckilling robbers is killing\npeople\u201d. Their aim, apparently, was to reconcile their\nutilitarian ethics with their doctrine of universal love. They\nregarded \u201cloving all people\u201d as compatible with the\njustified execution of criminals on the supposition that the phrase\n\u201ckilling robbers\u201d (justified execution) was not\n\u201ckilling people\u201d (murder), and hence not inconsistent with\ntheir ethics of \u201cloving (all) people\u201d. Xunzi, whose\nConfucian ethics were not challenged by this apparent inconsistency,\nremained unpersuaded by the Mohists\u2019 odd appeal to the idiom. In\nhis view, the assertion \u201cKilling robbers is killing\npeople\u201d is analyzed compositionally in the same way as\n\u201cRiding white horses is riding horses\u201d, making it likewise\nadmissible.\n\nIn rejecting the Mohists\u2019 judgment on this point, Xunzi is not\ncontesting the Mohists\u2019 general theory of inference. He is only\ndisputing its application in this case. While there is no evidence\nthat Xunzi held that all complex meaning is strictly compositional, he\nwas disinclined to take seriously the kinds of exceptions that the\nMohists garnered for their ethical views. His preference seems to have\nbeen for a simpler theory that accommodates terms of whatever levels\nof generality are necessary for purposes of communicative clarity. The\ncomplex \u201ckilling people\u201d is better analyzed\ncompositionally if another simple term of appropriate generality\n(e.g., \u201cmurder\u201d) is at hand to avoid the confusion:\n\n\nIf a single name is enough to communicate, make it single; if not,\ncombine. (Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, single terms are more general than the complexes\nin which they occur:\n\n\nIf the single is nowhere in conflict with the combined, it is the more\ngeneral; but general though it is, there is no harm in it.\n(Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nNo harm, that is, in terms of whatever levels of generality are\nnecessary for communicative clarity (e.g., \u201cbird\u201d,\n\u201canimal\u201d), up to the broadest level of generality\n(\u201cthing\u201d). Like the Mohists, Xunzi\u2019s theory of\ninference is based on the notion that a model must serve as a standard\nof resemblance: naming an object is like \u201cmeasuring an unknown\nlength by a footrule\u201d. He was therefore inclined to draw\ninferences in much the same way. The assertion \u201cx is an\nanimal\u201d is a valid inference from the claim \u201cx\nresembles the model m for animal\u201d on the assumption\nthat anything resembling m is an animal.\n\nSimilarly, \u201cA white horse is a horse\u201d is a valid\ninference, in Xunzi\u2019s view, from the claim:\n\nThe model \\(m_1\\) for \u201cwhite horse\u201d resembles the model\n\\(m_2\\) for \u201chorse\u201d.\n\nXunzi\u2019s reference to this example in particular in Book 22 of\nthe Xunzi is likely his response to the paradoxical statement\n\u201cWhite horses are not horses\u201d, famously asserted by the\nsophist Gongsun Long probably as a foil to the Mohists\u2019 theories\nof naming and reference (Gongsun Long may himself have once been a\nMohist; see the entry\n School of Names\n for further discussion). The inference works, presumably, because\n\\(m_2\\) serves as a model for \u201chorse\u201d irrespective of its\ncolor. Since color is not a relevant criterion of resemblance,\n\u201chorse\u201d functions as a term of greater generality.\n\nIn all of this, there is no disagreement with Mohist views. The\ndisagreement arises in the analysis of particulars, which the Mohists\nfelt could substantively determine the outcomes of ethical disputes.\nGiven that convention lies at the bottom of all acts of naming, Xunzi\nabandons any supposition that semantics (or even reason, narrowly\nconstrued in the Mohists\u2019 sense of disputation) can be the\nground of ethics. On the other hand, Xunzi\u2019s deference to\nauthority leaves one to wonder what principles of reason an educated\nelite would use in determining why a given set of conventions in\nlanguage are more appropriate than others. It can be assumed that\ntheir choices would not be completely arbitrary, but that they would\nbe guided by the very faculties of discrimination in perception that\nthe Mohists argued were at the foundations of our common reason.\nIndeed, much in spite of the admirable clarity with which he\narticulated his views on the role of language in ethical conduct,\nXunzi leaves the reader with an unresolved tension between what he had\nhoped to accomplish in his own philosophical analyses and the mandates\nof those higher officials to whose authority he admonishes us to yield\n(see the entry\n Xunzi\n for further details).\n",
