    "main_text": "Nonlinear Models, Faithfulness and Confirmation\n3. Nonlinear Models, Faithfulness and Confirmation\n\nGiven a target system to be modeled, and invoking the faithful model\nassumption, there are two basic approaches to model confirmation\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature on modeling following a\nstrategy known as piecemeal improvement (I will ignore bootstrapping\napproaches as they suffer similar problems, but only complicate the\ndiscussion). These piecemeal strategies are also found in the work of\nscientists modeling actual-world systems and represent competing\napproaches vying for government funding (for an early discussion, see\nThompson 1957).\n\n\nThe first basic approach is to focus on successive refinements to\nthe accuracy of the initial data used by the model while keeping the\nmodel itself fixed (e.g., Laymon 1989, p.\u00a0359). The idea here is that\nif a model is faithful in reproducing the behavior of the target system\nto some degree, refining the precision of the initial data fed to the\nmodel will lead to its behavior monotonically converging to the target\nsystem\u2019s behavior. This is to say that as the uncertainty in the\ninitial data is reduced, a faithful model\u2019s behavior is expected\nto converge to the target system\u2019s behavior. The import of the\nfaithful model assumption is that if one were to plot the trajectory of\nthe target system in an appropriate state space, the model trajectory\nin the same state space would monotonically become more like the system\ntrajectory on some measure as the data is refined (I will ignore\ndifficulties regarding appropriate measures for discerning similarity\nin trajectories; see Smith 2000).\n\n\nThe second basic approach is to focus on successive refinements of\nthe model while keeping the initial data fixed (e.g., Wimsatt 1987).\nThe idea here is that if a model is faithful in reproducing the\nbehavior of the target system, refining the model will produce an even\nbetter fit with the target system\u2019s behavior. This is to say that\nif a model is faithful, successive improvements will lead to its\nbehavior monotonically converging to the target system\u2019s\nbehavior. Again, the import of the faithful model assumption is that if\none were to plot the trajectory of the target system in an appropriate\nstate space, the model trajectory in the same state space would\nmonotonically become more like the system trajectory as the model is\nmade more realistic.\n\n\nWhat both of these basic approaches have in common is that piecemeal\nmonotonic convergence of model behavior to target system behavior is a\nmark for confirmation of the model (Koperski 1998). By either improving\nthe quality of the initial data or improving the quality of the model,\nthe model in question reproduces the target system\u2019s behavior\nmonotonically better and yields predictions of the future states of the\ntarget system that show monotonically less deviation with respect to\nthe behavior of the target system. In this sense, monotonic convergence\nto the behavior of the target system is a key criterion for whether the\nmodel is confirmed. If monotonic convergence to the target system\nbehavior is not found by pursuing either of these basic approaches,\nthen the model is considered to be disconfirmed.\n\n\nFor linear models it is easy to see the intuitive appeal of such\npiecemeal strategies. After all, for linear systems of equations a\nsmall change in the magnitude of a variable is guaranteed to yield a\nproportional change in the output of the model. So by making piecemeal\nrefinements to the initial data or to the linear model only\nproportional changes in model output are expected. If the linear model\nis faithful, then making small improvements \u201cin the right\ndirection\u201d in either the initial data or the model itself can be\ntracked by improved model performance. The qualifier \u201cin the\nright direction,\u201d drawing upon the faithful model assumption,\nmeans that the data quality really is increased or that the model\nreally is more realistic (captures more features of the target system\nin an increasingly accurate way), and is signified by the model\u2019s\nmonotonically improved performance with respect to the target\nsystem.\n\n\nHowever, both of these basic approaches to confirming models\nencounter serious difficulties when applied to nonlinear models, where\nthe principle of linear superposition no longer holds. In the first\napproach, successive small refinements in the initial data used by\nnonlinear models is not guaranteed to lead to any convergence between\nmodel behavior and target system behavior. Any small refinements in\ninitial data can lead to non-proportional changes in model behavior\nrendering this piecemeal convergence strategy ineffective as a means\nfor confirming the model. A refinement of the quality of the data\n\u201cin the right direction\u201d is not guaranteed to lead to a\nnonlinear model monotonically improving in capturing the target\nsystem\u2019s behavior. The small refinement in data quality may very\nwell lead to the model behavior diverging away from the\nsystem\u2019s\n behavior.[6]\n\n\nIn the second approach, keeping the data fixed but making successive\nrefinements in nonlinear models is also not guaranteed to lead to any\nconvergence between model behavior and target system behavior. With the\nloss of linear superposition, any small changes in the model can lead\nto non-proportional changes in model behavior again rendering the\nconvergence strategy ineffective as a means for confirming the model.\nEven if a small refinement to the model is made \u201cin the right\ndirection,\u201d there is no guarantee that the nonlinear model will\nmonotonically improve in capturing the target system\u2019s behavior.\nThe small refinement in the model may very well lead to the model\nbehavior diverging away from the system\u2019s behavior.\n\n\nSo whereas for linear models piecemeal strategies might be expected\nto lead to better confirmed models (presuming the target system\nexhibits only stable linear behavior), no such expectation is justified\nfor nonlinear models deployed in the characterization of nonlinear\ntarget systems. Even for a faithful nonlinear model, the smallest\nchanges in either the initial data or the model itself may result in\nnon-proportional changes in model output, an output that is not\nguaranteed to \u201cmove in the right direction\u201d even if the\nsmall changes are made \u201cin the right direction\u201d (of course,\nthis lack of guarantee of monotonic improvement also raises questions\nabout what \u201cin the right direction\u201d means, but I will\nignore these difficulties here).\n\n\n Intuitively, piecemeal convergence strategies look to be dependent\non the perfect model scenario. Given a perfect model, refining the\nquality of the data should lead to monotonic convergence of the model\nbehavior to the target system\u2019s behavior, but even this expectation is\nnot always justifiable for perfect models (cf. Judd and Smith 2001;\nSmith 2003). On the other hand, given good data, perfecting a model\nintuitively should also lead to monotonic convergence of the model\nbehavior to the target system\u2019s behavior. By making small changes to a\nnonlinear model, hopefully based on improved understanding of relevant\nfeatures of the target system (e.g., the physics of weather systems or\nthe structures of economies), there is no guarantee that such changes\nwill produce monotonic improvement in the model\u2019s performance with\nrespect to the target system\u2019s behavior. The loss of linear\nsuperposition, then, leads to a similar lack of guarantee of a\ncontinuous path of improvement as the lack of guarantee of piecemeal\nconfirmation. And without such a guaranteed path of improvement, there\nis no guarantee that a faithful nonlinear model can be perfected by piecemeal means.\n\n\nOf course, we do not have perfect models. But even if we did, they are\nunlikely to live up to our intuitions about them (Judd and Smith 2001;\nJudd and Smith 2004). For example, no matter how many observations of\na system are made, there still will be a set of trajectories in the\nmodel state space that are indistinguishable from the actual\ntrajectory of the target system. Indeed, even for infinite past\nobservations, we cannot eliminate the uncertainty in the epistemic\nstates given some unknown ontological state of the target system. One\nimportant reason for this difficulty follows from the faithful model\nassumption. Suppose the nonlinear model state space is a faithful\nrepresentation of the possibilities lying in the physical space of the\ntarget system. No matter how fine-grained we make our model state\nspace, it will still be the case that there are many different states\nof the actual target system (ontological states) that are mappable\ninto the same state of the model state space (epistemic states). This\nmeans that there will always be many more target system states than\nthere are model states for any computational models since the\nequations have to be discretized. In principle, in those cases where\nwe can develop a fully analytical model, we could get an exact match\nbetween the number of possible model states and the number of target\nsystem states. However, such analytical models are rare in complexity\nstudies (many of the analytical models are toy models, like the\nbaker\u2019s map, which, while illustrative of techniques, are\nmisleading when it comes to metaphysical and ontological conclusions\ndue to their simplicity).\n\n\nTherefore, whether there is a perfect model or not for a target\nsystem, there is no guarantee of monotonic improvement with respect to\nthe target system\u2019s behavior. Traditional piecemeal confirmation\nstrategies fail. This is the upshot of the failure of the principle of\nlinear superposition. No matter how faithful the model, no guarantee\nof piecemeal monotonic improvement of a nonlinear model\u2019s behavior\nwith respect to the target system can be made (of course, if one waits\nfor long enough times piecemeal confirmation strategies will also fail\nfor linear systems). Furthermore, problems with these confirmation\nstrategies will arise whether one is seeking to model point-valued\ntrajectories in state space or one is using probability densities\ndefined on state space.\n\n\nOne possible response to the piecemeal confirmation problems\ndiscussed here is to turn to a Bayesian framework for confirmation, but\nsimilar problems arise here for nonlinear models. Given that there are\nno perfect models in the model class to which we would apply a Bayesian\nscheme and given the fact that imperfect models will fail to reproduce\nor predict target system behavior over time scales that may be short\ncompared to our interests, there again is no guarantee that monotonic\nimprovement can be achieved for our nonlinear models (I leave aside the\nproblem that having no perfect model in our model class renders many\nBayesian confirmation schemes ill-defined).\n\n\nFor nonlinear models, faithfulness can fail and piecemeal\nperfectibility cannot be guaranteed, raising questions about\nscientific modeling practices and our understanding of them. However,\nthe implications of the loss of linear superposition reach father than\nthis. Policy assessment often utilizes model forecasts and if the\nmodels and systems lying at the core of policy deliberations are\nnonlinear, then policy assessment will be affected by the same lack of\nguarantee as model confirmation. Suppose administrators are using a\nnonlinear model in the formulation of economic policies designed to\nkeep GDP ever increasing while minimizing unemployment (among\nachieving other socio-economic goals). While it is true that there\nwill be some uncertainty generated by running the model several times\nover slightly different data sets, assume that policies taking these\nuncertainties into account to some degree can be fashioned. Once in\nplace, the policies need assessment regarding their effectiveness and\npotential adverse effects, but such assessment will not involve merely\nlooking at monthly or quarterly reports on GDP and employment data to\nsee if targets are being met. The nonlinear economic model driving the\npolicy decisions will need to be rerun to check if trends are indeed\nmoving \u201cin the right direction\u201d with respect to the\nearlier forecasts. But, of course, data for the model now has changed\nand there is no guarantee that the model will produce a forecast with\nthis new data that fits well with the old forecasts used to craft the\noriginal policies. Nor is there a guarantee of any fit between the new\nruns of the nonlinear model and the economic data being gathered as\npart of ongoing monitoring of the economic policies. How, then, are\npolicy makers to make reliable assessments of policies? The same\nproblem\u2014that small changes in data or model in nonlinear\ncontexts are not guaranteed to yield proportionate model outputs or\nmonotonically improved model performance\u2014also plagues policy\nassessment using nonlinear models. Such problems remain largely\nunexplored.\n\n",
