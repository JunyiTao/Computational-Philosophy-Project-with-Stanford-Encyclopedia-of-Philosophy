    "main_text": "Collective Self-Deception || Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception Across a Collective\n7.1 Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception Across a Collective\n\nUnderstood summatively, we might define collective self-deception as\nthe holding of a false belief in the face of evidence to the contrary\nby a group of people as a result of shared desires, emotions, or\nintentions (depending upon the account of self-deception) favoring\nthat belief. Collective self-deception is distinct from other forms of\ncollective false belief\u2014such as might result from deception or\nlack of evidence\u2014insofar as the false belief issues from the\nagents\u2019 own self-deceptive mechanisms (however these are\nconstrued), not the absence of evidence to the contrary or presence of\nmisinformation. Accordingly, the individuals constituting the group\nwould not hold the false belief if their vision weren\u2019t\ndistorted by their attitudes (desire, anxiety, fear, or the like)\ntoward the belief. What distinguishes collective self-deception from\nsolitary self-deception is just its social context; namely, that it\noccurs within a group that shares both the attitudes bringing about\nthe false belief and the false belief itself.\n\nMerely sharing desires, emotions, or intentions favoring a belief with\na group does not entail that the self-deception is properly social\nsince these individuals may well self-deceive regardless of the fact\nthat their motivations are shared with others (Dings 2017; Funkhouser\n2019); they are just individually self-deceiving in parallel. What\nmakes collective self-deception social, according to\nDings (2017), is that others are a means used in each\nindividual\u2019s self-deception. So, when a person situates herself\nin a group of like-minded people in response to an encounter with new\nand threatening evidence, her self-deception becomes social.\nSelf-deception also becomes social in Dings\u2019 (2017) view when a\nperson influences others to make them like-minded with regard to her\npreferred belief, using their behavior to reinforce her\nself-deception. Within highly homogeneous social groups,\nhowever, it may be difficult to tell who is using the group\ninstrumentally in these ways, especially when that use is unwitting.\nMoreover, one may not need to seek out such a group of like-minded\npeople if they already comprise one\u2019s community. In this case,\nthose people may become instrumental to one\u2019s self-deception\nsimply by dint of being there to provide insulation from threatening\nevidence and support for one\u2019s preferred belief. In any case,\nthis sort of self-deception is both easier to foster and more\ndifficult to escape, being abetted by the self-deceptive efforts of\nothers within the group.\n\nVirtually all self-deception has a social component, being wittingly\nor unwittingly supported by one\u2019s associates (see Ruddick 1988).\nIn the case of collective self-deception, however, the social\ndimension comes to the fore since each member of the collective\nunwittingly helps to sustain the self-deceptive belief of the others\nin the group. For example, my cancer-stricken friend might\nself-deceptively believe her prognosis to be quite good. Faced with\nthe fearful prospect of death, she does not form accurate beliefs\nregarding the probability of her full recovery, attending only to\nevidence supporting full recovery and discounting or ignoring\naltogether the ample evidence to the contrary. Caring for her as I do,\nI share many of the anxieties, fears, and desires that sustain my\nfriend\u2019s self-deceptive belief, and as a consequence, I form the\nsame self-deceptive belief via the same mechanisms. In such a case, I\nunwittingly support my friend\u2019s self-deceptive belief, and she\nmine\u2014our self-deceptions are mutually reinforcing. We are\ncollectively or mutually self-deceived, albeit on a very small scale.\nRuddick (1988) calls this \u2018joint self-deception,\u2019 and it\nis properly social just in case each person is instrumental in the\nformation of the self-deceptive belief in the other (Dings 2017).\n\nOn a larger scale, sharing common attitudes, large segments of a\nsociety might deceive themselves together. For example, we share a\nnumber of self-deceptive beliefs regarding our consumption patterns.\nMany of the goods we consume are produced by people enduring labor\nconditions we do not find acceptable and in ways that we recognize are\nenvironmentally destructive and likely unsustainable. Despite our\nbeing at least generally aware of these social and environmental\nramifications of our consumptive practices, we hold the overly\noptimistic beliefs that the world will be fine, that its peril is\noverstated, that the suffering caused by the exploitive and\necologically degrading practices are overblown, that our own\nconsumption habits are unconnected to these sufferings, and even that\nour minimal efforts at conscientious consumption are an adequate\nremedy (see Goleman 1989). When self-deceptive beliefs such as these\nare held collectively, they become entrenched, and their consequences,\ngood or bad, are magnified (Surbey 2004).\n\nThe collective entrenches self-deceptive beliefs by providing positive\nreinforcement through others sharing the same false belief as well as\nby protecting its members from evidence that would destabilize the\ntarget belief. There are, however, limits to how entrenched such\nbeliefs can become and remain. Social support cannot be the sole or\nprimary cause of the self-deceptive belief, for then the belief would\nsimply be the result of unwitting interpersonal deception and not the\ndeviant belief formation process that characterizes self-deception. If\nthe environment becomes so epistemically contaminated as to make\ncounter-evidence inaccessible to the agent, then we have a case of\nsimple false belief, not self-deception. Thus, even within a\ncollective, a person is self-deceived just in case her own motivations\nskew the belief formation process that results in her holding the\nfalse belief. But, to bar this from being a simple case of solitary\nself-deception, others must be instrumental to her belief formation\nprocess such that if they were not part of that process, she would not\nbe self-deceived (Dings 2017). For instance, I might be motivated to\nbelieve that climate change is not a serious problem and form that\nfalse belief as a consequence. In such a case, I\u2019m not socially\nself-deceived, even if virtually everyone I know shares a similar\nmotivation and belief. But, say I encounter distressing evidence in my\nenvironmental science class that I can\u2019t shake on my own. I may\nseek to surround myself with like-minded people, thereby protecting\nmyself from further distressing evidence and providing myself with\nreassuring evidence. Now, my self-deception is social, and this social\ncomponent drives and reinforces my own motivations to\nself-deceive.\n\nRelative to solitary self-deception, the collective variety presents\ngreater external obstacles to avoiding or escaping self-deception and\nis, for this reason, more entrenched. If the various proposed\npsychological mechanisms of self-deception pose an internal challenge\nto the self-deceiver\u2019s power to control her belief formation,\nthen these social factors pose an external challenge to the\nself-deceiver\u2019s control. Determining how superable this\nchallenge is will affect our assessment of individual responsibility\nfor self-deception as well as the prospects of unassisted escape from\nit.\n",
