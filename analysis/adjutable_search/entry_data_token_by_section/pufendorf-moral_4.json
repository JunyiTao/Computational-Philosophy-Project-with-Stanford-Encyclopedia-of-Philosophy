    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Necessity\n3.2 Moral Necessity\n\nObligation refers to the \u201cmoral necessity\u201d at work in such\nrelationships, by which one is \u201cbound\u201d to do, admit, or\nsuffer something (DJN I.1.21), and thus it applies to all spheres\nwhere authority, right, or other forms of moral normativity operate.\nPufendorf clarifies obligation at DJN I.6, in his discussion of law,\nsanction, and the claims of lawgivers. Law differs, he says there\n(referring to Hobbes, On the Citizen [De cive\n{1642}] 14.1), from counsel, agreement, and right alike, because by it\nan obligation is \u201cintroduced into a man\u2019s mind by a\nsuperior, that is by someone who not only has the strength to threaten\nsome evil against those who resist him, but also legitimate reasons\nallowing him to demand that our freedom be restricted at his\ndiscretion.\u201d (DJN I.6.9; Pufendorf 1994a, p.123) That is,\nobligation has a dual aspect involving both reason and strength,\nneither of which can separately give rise to it: the former generates\nreverence or respect in those who are (or take themselves to be)\nobligated, and the latter fear. Both are needed, since reverence\nwithout fear does not explain the compellingness of obligation, while\nfear without reverence does not explain its legitimacy (DJN III.4.6).\nThis analysis applies to obligation under both divine and human law,\nand in the former case, especially, it raises the question of whether\nvoluntarism or intellectualism, or an amalgam, offers a more adequate\naccount of moral duty. The matter has been much debated, starting with\nLeibniz\u2019s critique (1706; in Leibniz 1972) and Barbeyrac\u2019s\ndefense (1718; in Pufendorf 2003) of Pufendorf (see Schneewind 1996a;\nHunter 2004; Lipscomb 2005; Haakonssen 1998; Grunert 2000), and still\nin recent discussions (see section 5.3 below) of normativity referring\nback to those earlier treatments (Darwall 2012, Irwin 2011a\u2013b,\nPink 2009).\n\nMore so than Grotius, Pufendorf clearly distinguished natural and\nmoral goods (DJN I.2.6), maintaining that the former are morally\nindifferent even if generally agreed upon by humans (DJN I.4.4,\nII.3.4). Thus, since moral norms are not directly linked to the\nintrinsic natures or purposes of things, or to the outcomes of\nactions, he was neither a teleologist nor a consequentialist in ethics\n(in the sense of maintaining an obligation to achieve or realize\nnatural \u2018goods\u2019 or \u2018the good\u2019, which are\nassumed already to be morally compelling). However, the so-called\nnatural goodness or evil of things, their ability to benefit or harm\nus, provide the rationale for the imposition of moral entities by\nintelligent beings from which obligation springs. That is, they have\n(especially in the case of natural goods) a sort of evidentiary\nfunction, explaining why the obliger wills such-and-such, and why the\nobligee wills (or might be motivated to) its acceptance. Thus, when\ndiscussing moral persons Pufendorf says that the impositions which\nproduce that rank or status should have a positive effect (solidus\neffectus) on humankind and not be made frivolously, as when\nCaligula declared his horse a senator, when the ancient Romans deified\ntheir emperors, and when papists, still, declare saints by a similar\nsort of post-mortem canonization \u2013 all with normative impact\n(DJN I.1.15). Similarly, when explaining the legitimating aspect of\ncommands or obligations (human or divine), or that in them which\nevokes our reverence or respect, Pufendorf stresses the commanding\nparty\u2019s ability and willingness to benefit (or his having done\nso) those on whom the obligation lies (DJN I.6.12, DO I.5). In sum,\nwhile natural good and evil are not the source of obligation per se,\nand moral necessity is not hypothetical in that sense, they do explain\nwhy there is such a thing as obligation at all, or what the point of\nit is. Moreover, since what benefits or harms humans is known through\nexperience, empirical investigation, and knowledge of the past\n(history), these operate as heuristics for determining our obligations\nand explain why, in some cases, there may be disagreement about them.\nOf course, such differences do not concern whether moral commands as\nsuch formally obligate or not, but whether specific actions are in\nfact morally commanded. That at least some of them are (Pufendorf also\nallowed for indifferent actions), and that in particular moral spaces\nor contexts we can usually determine which ones, is a basic assumption\nof Pufendorf\u2019s theory.\n",
