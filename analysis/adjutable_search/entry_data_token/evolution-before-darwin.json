Prior to the second half\nof the nineteenth century, the term was used primarily, if not\nexclusively, in an embryological sense to designate the development of\nthe individual embryo. These same ambiguities of usage also surround\nthe German term Entwicklungsgeschichte, which originally was\nused in an embryological context. In 1852 the English philosopher\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) used the term to denote both cosmic\nand biological changes from \u201chomogeneity\u201d to\n\u201cheterogeneity\u201d, and spoke there of a \u201ctheory of\nevolution\u201d. In the 1860s the term was used in some contexts to\ndesignate species change (Bowler 1975). Darwin himself did not use\nthis specific term for his theory until the Descent of Man\n(1871). Since this article will survey the broad history of these\ntheories prior to the Origin of Species, the term\n\u201ctransformism\u201d, a term that came into common use in French\nbiological sources around 1835, will generally be used in this article\nto designate the theory of species change prior to the shift in\nmeaning in the 1860s.

Species Permanence and Change in Antiquity\n1.1 Classical Discussions\n\nIn many respects, the general idea of species change in Western\nthought is an ancient concept. The reflections of Empedocles (ca.\n495\u201335 BCE) and the views of the Greek Atomists among the\nPresocratic nature philosophers formed a Classical heritage on which\nlater speculations could be developed (Kirby 2013). These Presocratic\nspeculations combined naturalistic accounts of origins with\nreflections on the workings of chance-like processes to create\nexisting forms of life (see the entry ancient atomism). Particularly\nas the Presocratic Atomist speculations were restated by the Roman\npoet Titus Lucretius (ca. 99\u201350 BCE) in book five of his On\nthe Nature of Things (Lucretius [RN]), a source was available in\nAntiquity and recovered in the Latin West in 1417. This set out a\nspeculative account of the gradual origin of living beings from an\ninitial atomic chaos. Through an undirected process, the best adapted\nforms are sorted out and those not suited to their conditions are\neliminated\n\nThe speculative accounts of the early atomists were, however, opposed\non several levels by the subsequent mainstream Platonic, Neo-Platonic,\nAristotelian, and Stoic philosophical traditions. The writings of\nPlato (427\u2013327 BCE), particularly his long creation myth,\nTimaeus\u2014 the only Platonic dialogue available\ncontinuously in the Latin Western tradition\u2014 provided an\ninfluential non-Biblical source for arguments against the Atomist\ntradition. This dialogue serves as the locus classicus for\nthe notion of an externally-imposed origin of living beings through\nthe action of an intelligent Craftsman (demiurgos) who orders\nmathematically- conceived matter into a rational cosmos that includes\nliving beings fashioned in accord with eternal archetypes or forms.\nPlato\u2019s account initiated the long tradition of reflection that\nwas continued in Neo-Platonism and in Greek and Roman Stoicism to form\nthe foundation of the argument that organic beings could not be\nexplained by chance-like processes either in their origins or in their\ncomplex design. Particularly as developed in the influential writings\nof the Greek physician Claudius Galenus (129\u2013200 CE), a long\nheritage in the life sciences relied upon anatomy as evidence of\nrational design. These interpretations of \u201cteleological\ndesign\u201d interacted in complex ways with Jewish, Christian, and\nIslamic Biblical concepts of creation (Sedley 2007). One common\nmeaning of \u201cteleology\u201d frequently encountered in\ndiscussions of evolution since Darwin\u2014that of externally imposed\ndesign by an intelligent agency (demiurge, nature, God) on\npre-existing matter\u2014originates in these ancient discussions and\nis not accurately identified with the Biblical concept of creatio\nex nihilo (Carroll 2015).\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s (384\u2013322 BCE) seminal biological writings,\nthe external teleology of a designer-creator was replaced by an\ninternal teleological purposiveness associated with the immanent\naction of an internal cause\u2014 in living beings their informing\nsoul (psuche)\u2014 which functioned as the formal, final\nand efficient cause of life (Aristotle, De Anima II: 415b,\n10\u2013 30 [1984]). Aristotle also did not endorse the concept of an\nhistorical origin of the world, affirming instead the eternity of the\nworld order (Physics, I: 192a, 25\u201334), which became the\nmain interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s views by a later tradition\n(Dales and Argerami 1991).\n\nAnother issue that Aristotle treated extensively with relevance to the\nconception of species\u2014embryogenesis\u2014also had important\nimplications for later discussions. In the traditions indebted in some\nway to Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy, sexual generation and the\nsubsequent embryological development of the individual from primordial\nmatter, is a sequential process that occurs in time under the\nteleological action of the soul (psuche). In\nAristotle\u2019s own account, this soul-as-form is typically derived\nfrom the male parent, but it could also be derived even from the sun,\nas employed in his explanation of the origin of\nspontaneously-generated forms (Aristotle, De generatione\nanimalium, III: 762a, 20\u201335).\n\nThis theory of the passing on of soul-as-substantial form in\ngeneration also formed the basis of one meaning of\n\u201cspecies\u201d (eidos) in Aristotle\u2019s biological\nworks. \u201cSpecies\u201d\nin this sense denotes the individualized en-mattered form-as-soul that\nis perpetuated in generation eternally. Although connected by a\ncomplex theory of mental abstraction to the universal in thought and\nlanguage, a biological species is not a universal, but an eternal\nserial sequence of one individual generating another individual\n(De Anima, II: 415b, 1\u201310). The importance of this\nmeaning of eidos as distinct from the concept of a universal\nin thought and language bears on several issues explored in Sections\n3.3 and 3.4 below. \n1.2 Medieval Revisions\n\nThe implications of Aristotle\u2019s complex thought for subsequent\ndiscussions of species, generated by the recovery of his writings in\nthe Latin West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were varied.\nOn one hand, Aristotle\u2019s apparent metaphysical requirement that\nthe soul-as-form (eidos) be permanent and enduring through\nthe process of the generation of \u201clike by like\u201d seemed for\nmuch of the tradition to amount to a denial of the possibility that\nnatural species could change over time in their essential properties,\neven though local adaptation in \u201caccidental\u201d properties\nwas fully possible. Since individual beings were considered to be\ndynamic composites of a material substrate and an immaterial and\neternal form, the accidental differentiation of the substantial form\nin individuals did not affect the metaphysical endurance of the\nspecies. It also made species extinction metaphysically impossible. In\nliving beings, the soul-as-form is serially passed on through time in\nthe act of generation to create an eternal continuity of the form.\nThis supplied a metaphysical foundation for the notion of species\npermanence without reliance on an external creative agency.\n\nIn the background of the discussion of the high middle ages was also\nthe theory of divine creation endorsed in inherited Jewish, Christian\nand Islamic thought. This required a distinction between the first\norigin of species in historical time, and the normal generation of the\nindividual. If the origin of species was attributed to divine action,\nthe temporal emergence of these species was not necessarily\ninstantaneous. Such a doctrine was the basis of Augustine of\nHippo\u2019s (354\u2013430) theory of the original creation of\nprimordial seeds (rationes seminales) of each species at an\noriginal moment in time, but with the emergence of species in\nhistorical time a possibility (Augustine, VI.13.23\u201325, [GL,\n175\u201376]). This theory of a temporalized creation, put forth\nexplicitly in detail in his treatise The Literal Interpretation of\nGenesis, allowed Augustine to argue that species emerged\nsequentially in historical time rather than all at once.\n\nThe great textual recoveries in the Latin West of Greek science,\nmedicine and philosophy of the twelfth through the fifteenth\ncenturies, generally accompanied by Islamic commentaries, introduced\nthese texts into a theological context that had been strongly defined\nby Augustinianism and neo-Platonism. The interplay between this\npre-existent tradition with new philosophical views defined a complex\nperiod of intellectual ferment that defined much of the subsequent\nintellectual and scientific history of the West (Gaukroger 2006: chp.\n2). The sustained efforts of major synthesizers, such as Thomas\nAquinas (1225\u20131274), to bring the massive body of\nnewly-recovered Aristotelian works into dialogue with Christian\nNeo-Platonism and Augustinianism, demanded new insights into the\nconception of the soul-body relation, the autonomy of the natural\norder and the role of secondary causes in the creation of the\nworld.\n\nConcerning the issue of species-permanence and origin, Aquinas treated\nthis in dialogue with Augustine\u2019s theory of serial creation. As\nhe comments in his major synthesis, the Summa Theologiae:\n\u201cNew species, if they appear, pre-exist in certain active\npowers\u201d (Pars I, Qu. 73, Rep Obj. 3). This claim suggests a\nreading of Aristotle that assumed the essential fixity of each\ndefinable substantial form, and the eternity of each species since\ncreation. But this conclusion must be read in the context of\nAquinas\u2019s complex theory of creation and the discussions of the\nproblem of universals in late Scholastic philosophy (see the entry\nmedieval problem of universals, and Wilkins 2009: Ch. 3). This context\nprevents any simple picture of Scholastic thought concerning the issue\nof species permanence, and it cannot be claimed that either Aristotle\nor later Scholastics such as Aquinas are responsible for the strong\n\u201cessentialist\u201d position often attributed to them in the\nliterature (R. A. Richards 2010: chp. 2). As developed below (2.2), it\ncan be argued that the species concept was \u201chardened\u201d only\nin the early modern period with the rise of the mechanical philosophy\nand its attendant preformationist embryology. The \u201cstrong\nessentialist\u201d position often attributed to Aristotle and\nScholasticism (Hull, 1965), is demonstrably a product of later\nhistorical developments (R.A. Richards 2010; Wilkins 2009; Oderberg\n2007: chp. 9; Winsor 2006; Lennox 1985, 1987, 2001).\n2. Early Modern Foundations\n2.1 Cartesian History of Nature\n\nThe re-introduction of Greek and Roman atomism in the Renaissance,\nwith the recovery (1417) and printing (1473) of Lucretius\u2019s\nphilosophical poem On the Nature of Things (Lucretius,\n[1968]), introduced to a literate European audience a series of\ninfluential cosmological speculations that included a naturalistic\naccount of the origin of species integrated into a non-teleological\nmaterialist cosmology that contrasted markedly with the received\nScholastic, Aristotelian, and Augustinian-Platonic traditions. Into\nthe eighteenth century, these speculations, and those drawn from other\natomist sources (see the entry on natural philosophy in the\nRenaissance), were often in the background of novel early modern\nreflections on species origins and their possible transformation in\ntime (Bowler 2003: chp. 2; Oldroyd 1996; Greene 1959).\n\nA new starting point in systematic reflections on the origin of the\nearth and living beings, showing both some similarity and also major\ndifferences from atomist speculations, dates specifically from the\nsynthesis of natural philosophy and metaphysics put forth by\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) in his Principia\nphilosophiae (1st ed. 1644; 2nd ed. 1647). This treatise expanded\nand summarized issues he had developed earlier in Le Monde\n(The World, or Treatise on Light), a work published only\nposthumously in 1664, with an improved edition appearing in 1677. \n\nIt is important for understanding the subsequent reflections on the\n\u201chistory\u201d of nature to recognize that these Cartesian\nspeculations on the history of the earth and solar system were\nintroduced in the form of a counter-factual hypothesis that explicitly\nsought to avoid conflict with accepted theological interpretations of\norigins (Descartes 1647 [1983: 181]). In the hypothetical account\noffered in the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes derived\nthe earth from a cooled star \u201cformerly\u2026like the\nSun\u201d (ibid.). By its gradual solidification in a great celestial\nvortex, the Earth took form. Subsequent drying and cracking formed the\nocean basins, the continents and the mountain ranges.\n\nAn outstanding lacuna in Descartes\u2019s account, however, was his\nfailure to incorporate the origins of living beings into his\nnaturalistic story of creation by natural law. Although manuscripts\ndisplay the degree to which Descartes attempted on several occasions\nto work out some linkage between his general natural philosophy and\nthe embryological formation of living beings, these reflections did\nnot appear in print during his lifetime (Aucante 2006). The\nPrinciples simply skips over the issue of a naturalistic\naccount of the origins of life and the origin of individual species.\nInstead in Part IV, devoted generally to the origin and physical\nproperties of the Earth, he jumps (Proposition 188) from a discussion\nof magnetism to a brief allusion to projected Parts V and VI of his\nPrinciples that would deal with animals and humans (Descartes\n1647 [1983: 275\u2013276]). But the Principles only offers a\nbrief discussion of the various senses and body-soul interaction\nsimilar to that put forth in his early unpublished Treatise on\nMan (1st Latin ed. 1662, 2nd French ed. 1664). These speculations\nwere grounded on the concept of a hypothetical statue- machine created\ndirectly by divine action, and possessed immediately of all human\nfunctions and structures (Descartes 1664 [1972: 1\u20135]).\n\nDescartes\u2019s speculations conveyed to his successors at least two\nissues relevant to the origin and history of living species. First, by\npresenting the historical account of the origin of the solar system\nand the world as a counterfactual hypothesis, a means of understanding\nthe history of nature adapted to the limitations of the human mind,\nrather than as a literally true account, Descartes developed the\ngrounds for a purely fictionalist reading of historical science that\npersisted into the nineteenth century (Sloan 2006a). Second, the\nintegration of living beings into the new natural philosophy of\nmechanistic naturalism was left unresolved. If anything,\nDescartes\u2019s reflections accentuated the problem of providing a\nnaturalistic explanation of the origins of living beings.\n\nTwo traditions can be traced in the wake of Descartes\u2019s\nreflections. Beginning with the De solido intra solidum\nnaturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus of 1669 [1916] by\nthe Danish Cartesian Nicholas Steno (1638\u201386), efforts commenced\nto draw the historical origins of living beings into the Cartesian\ncosmology, in this case primarily by granting that fossils were the\nremains of once existing organisms on an earth that had formed\nhistorically. There was, however, no effort made to account for the\norigins of these beings on Cartesian principles (Steno 1669 [1916],\nRudwick 1972, 2005).\n\nA second tradition sought to give a \u201crealist\u201d\ninterpretation of the history of the earth by reconciling this with\nthe account of Genesis. Such a synthesis was the specific\neffort of the English clergyman, Thomas Burnet (1635\u20131715).\nBurnet sought to reconcile a Cartesian-derived historical account of\nthe origins of the Earth with the creation account of the Mosaic\ntradition. In Burnet\u2019s account, the Earth began from an original\nchaos fashioned by divine action into the existing Earth through a\nseries of changes that involved the gradual separation of the\ncontinents, the reversal of the poles, and the Mosaic flood. To\nexplain the origin of living beings, Burnet relied on the\n\u201cspontaneous fruitfulness of the ground\u201d in the primeval\nEdenic world, similar to the Augustine theory of the created\nrationales seminales, rather than on the direct creation of\ncomplete forms through divine action (Burnet 1684: bk 2, chp. 2, para.\n4, p. 187 [1965: 141]). By connecting this account to the Biblical\nstory of the first chapter of Genesis, Burnet broke with\nCartesian counterfactualism, offering for the first time a presumably\nliteral interpretation of a Cartesian-style developmental history of\nnature that also included the origins of living forms.\n2.2 Mechanism, Pre-existence Theory and Species Fixity\n\nThe various accounts offered in the subsequent \u201ctheory of the\nearth\u201d tradition, as they were amplified by such natural\nphilosophers as John Ray (1627\u20131705), John Woodward\n(1665\u20131728), and William Whiston (1667\u2013 1752), failed to\nachieve a consensus position on the question of a naturalistic\nexplanation of the origins of organisms (Rudwick 1972, 2005). New\nreflections on the embryological origin of the individual organism in\nthe seventeenth-century provided a particular point of focus, and the\nreflections on this issue were closely tied to speculations about\nspecies origins.\n\nIn its seventeenth-century context, the issue of species origins also\ninvolved debates over the possibility of the spontaneous generation of\nforms (Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 2]). The apparent experimental\nrefutations by Francesco Redi (1626\u20131667) of spontaneous\ngeneration theory weakened, but did not destroy the foundations of\nBurnet\u2019s theory. Evidence for spontaneous generation could\nalways be explained by appeal to Augustine\u2019s theory of the pre-\nexistent \u201cseeds\u201d or \u201cgerms\u201d.\n\nThe extensive empirical researches on the generation and embryological\nformation of birds and mammals carried out by William Harvey\n(1578\u20131657), and published late in his life in his\nExercitationes de generatione animalium (Observations on\nthe Generation of Animals) in 1651 (Harvey 1651 [1847]), proved\nto be a bombshell in this discussion. Harvey\u2019s careful studies\nclaimed to refute on empirical grounds both the Aristotelian\nform-matter theory of sexual generation as well as the rival\n\u201ctwo-seeds\u201d theory based on the assumption of equivalent\nmale and female semen. This latter theory had been embraced by ancient\natomists, by Galenic and Hippocratic medical theorists, and by the\nmajority of Renaissance physicians. The two-seeds theory had also been\naccepted by early-modern atomists such as Pierre Gassendi\n(1592\u20131655) and Nathaniel Highmore (1613\u201385) (Fisher\n2006). As a consequence, when Descartes\u2019s own speculations on\nembryonic formation were finally published posthumously in 1677, in\nwhich he had also relied on the combination of male and female\nsemina organized by laws of nature and the vortex theory,\nthey commonly met with derision (see quote from Garden below).\nHarvey\u2019s detailed embryological enquiries of 1651 had already\nseriously undermined the empirical bases of these claims. It is\ndifficult to find any author who endorsed the solution as offered by\nDescartes.\n\nThese empirical difficulties with both the main inherited theories of\ngeneration as well as with the new \u201cmechanistic\u201d\nalternative accounts of embryogenesis of Gassendi, Highmore, and\nDescartes produced a conceptual crisis within the program of universal\nmechanism that suggested that universal mechanism could not deal\ncausally with one of the most important issues in the philosophy of\nnature. Another solution needed to be found.\n\nAs a consequence of the failure of \u201cmechanistic\u201d\nepigenesis, post- Cartesian mechanists resolved this issue with the\ntheory of \u201cpreexistence\u201d. Scientific foundations of this\ncan be traced to the work of the microscopist Jan Swammerdam\n(1637\u201380) in the late 1660s on the basis of his microscopic\nobservations on developing insects. The philosophical development of\nthis theory was made by the French Oratorian priest Nicholas\nMalebranche (1638\u20131715), whose influential Recherche de la\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9 of 1674 recast many Cartesian principles\ninto a framework of \u201ctheistic\u201d universal mechanism\n(Malebranche 1674; Gaukroger 2010: chp.2). In this work Malebranche\noffered a novel theory of generation which is most accurately termed a\n\u201cpreexistence\u201d theory. On this view, the new organism is\nnot generated in secular time, but has pre-existed since the original\ncreation of the world. This theory, often supported by appeals to\nAugustine\u2019s theory of the creation of original seeds (see above\nSection 1.2), was to become the paradigmatic theory for nearly a\ncentury, and was closely associated with some version of the\nmechanical philosophy. Various expressions of the preexistence theory\ncan be traced into the public teaching and published works of such\ninfluential expositors of academic medicine as Hermann Boerhaave\n(1668\u20131738) of the University of Leyden. The theory is also\nendorsed in numerous scientific treatises of the early eighteenth\ncentury. The question of both individual and species origin was by\nthis theory removed to divine action at the first creation of the\nworld (Pyle 2006; Roger 1963 [1997: chp. 6]).\n\nAt least three variants of the theory of pre-existence can be\ndistinguished. Two of these assumed the pre-existence of forms in\nminiature. The original version assumed the encasement of the\nminiature form in the ovaries of the female (Ovism). Following the\ndiscovery in 1677 of spermatozoa by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\n(1632\u20131723), the theory of the preformation of the embryo in the\nmale spermatazoa (Vermism) was introduced. These two versions of\n\u201cpreformationism\u201d generally became the main options one\nfinds expressed in the professional medical and gynecological\nliterature of the 1670\u20131740 period (Pinto-Correia, 1997,\nStephanson and Wagner, 2015). A third alternative, but one which had\nfew followers in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century until\nthe 1770s, was the theory of pre-formed \u201cgerms\u201d, given its\nfirst clear statement by Claude Perrault (1608\u201380). This\nPerrault theory, which closely resembled the Augustinian theory of the\nrationes seminales (1.2 above), held that the first primordia\nof organisms were formed at the original creation as seeds dispersed\nin the soil, from which they were taken in with food. Under the proper\nconditions and within the correct organisms, these \u201cgerms\u201d\nbecame implanted in the ovaries from which they then developed in\nresponse to fertilization. In all three accounts, the act of\nfertilization provided the occasion, and not the cause, of the\ndevelopment of organisms in time.\n\nThe theory of pre-existence was seen to solve many problems. First, it\nexplained the intimate interrelation of structure and function that\nseemed to require the existence of parts of the organism in an\nintegrated system. The heart presumably could not beat without\nennervation, and the nerves could not exist without the heart.\nConsequently, as the argument went, the entire organism must\npre-exist. The existence of such integrated systems seemed otherwise\ndifficult to explain by the sequential development of parts, as\nimplied in Aristotelian and other \u201cepigenetic\u201d theories of\ndevelopment. Second, this account was easily harmonized with\ntheological developments in the seventeenth century, particularly on\nthe Continent, where the strong influence of Augustinian theology on\nCalvinism (Protestant) and Jansenism (Catholic) was most in evidence.\nAs an example, it provided for the transmission of Original Sin. The\nsolution that emerged was a \u201ctheistic\u201d mechanism that\nemphasized God\u2019s omnipotence and the corresponding passivity of\nnature (Gaukroger 2010; Roger 1993, 1997a, chp. 6]). A third advantage\nof the theory of preexistence, at least in the versions that embraced\nthe \u201cpreformed germs\u201d interpretation, was that it allowed\nfor the appearance of life in secular time, which seemed to be\nsuggested by the existence of fossil forms. At the same time no\nversions of preexistence theory implied any change of species or\ndevelopment of one species from another in time. Finally, some version\nof a theory of the preformation of the embryo could be reconciled with\nthe best microscopic observations of the late seventeenth and early\neighteenth centuries, as these were reported by such experts on this\ninstrument as van Leeuwenhoek, Jan Swammerdam, Marcello Malpighi\n(1628\u20131694), and Henry Baker (1690\u20131774).\n\nThese preexistence theories of embryological origin directly affected\nthe question of species transformism. First, they effectively removed\nthe organism from the effects of local circumstance and environmental\nconditions. Second, they all placed the origin of species, as well as\nthat of at least the primordia of the individual organism, at a moment\nin the original divine creation. A quotation from a contemporary\nreview article illustrates several aspects of the thesis of\npreexistence:\n\n\nAnd indeed all the Laws of Motion which are as yet discovered, can\ngive but a very lame account of the forming of a Plant or Animal. We\nsee how wretchedly Des Cartes came off when he began to apply\nthem to this subject; they are form\u2019d by Laws yet unknown to\nMankind, and it seems most probable that the Stamina of all\nthe Plants and Animals that have ever been, or ever shall be in the\nWorld, have been formed ab Origine Mundi [from the foundation\nof the world] by the Almighty Creator within the first of each\nrespective kind. (Garden 1691: 476\u2013477)\n\n\nThe immediate consequence of this theory was a new rigidity given to\nthe concept of species that it had not possessed in the Aristotelian\nand Scholastic traditions. Preexistence theory reinforced a sharp\ndistinction between \u201cessential\u201d and\n\u201caccidental\u201d properties to a degree not implied by the\nprior tradition. At the same time, preexistence theory made it\ndifficult to explain obvious empirical phenomena, such as monstrosity,\nthe regeneration of lost parts, the resemblances of offspring to both\nparents, evidence for geographical variation, racial differences, and\nthe existence of hybrid forms such as the mule. It seemed necessary to\nattribute these anomalies to divine action at an original creation.\nThese difficulties in the theory resulted in a variety of criticisms\nthat were eventually to lead to the downfall of preexistence theory in\nits original form, although the theory was to have a long subsequent\nhistory through a modification of the \u201cgerm\u201d theory\n(Detlefsen 2006; Roger 1997a, chp. 7; Roe 1981).\n\nThe dominance of some form of pre-existence theory of generation\nbetween roughly 1670 and the 1740s provides some explanation for the\nlack of efforts among natural philosophers to develop transformist\ntheories of species origins in the same period. A notable exception to\nthis claim was the Epicurean cosmology resembling some aspects of\nLucretius\u2019s poem, developed by the French philosophe\nBen\u00f4it de Maillet (1656\u20131738) in his privately circulated\nmanuscript Telliamed that was known in French circles for ten\nyears before its publication in 1748 (Maillet, 1748). In this work de\nMaillet offered bold speculations on how sea creatures developed into\nland forms over time. Nonetheless, the period before the middle of the\neighteenth century was dominated by a theory of organic generation\nthat effectively precluded the naturalistic development of species.\nThe development of scientific transformism can be seen to be\nintimately tied to new theories of generation, and also to the\ndevelopment of \u201cactive\u201d rather than \u201cpassive\u201d\nconceptions of matter.\n2.3 Newtonian Revisions\n\nThe introduction of Newtonian natural philosophy into this discussion\nhad ambiguous consequences depending on the interpretations given to\nNewton\u2019s natural philosophy. Newton\u2019s\nPhilosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica\n(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) of 1687, with\nsubsequent revised editions in 1713 and 1729 (Newton 1729 [1999]),\ndeveloped a fundamental critique of Cartesianism, and also introduced\nthe concept of attractive forces, able to act over a distance, into\nphysical explanations. Extending the concept of \u201cactive\npowers\u201d to the micro-level in his Opticks of 1704\n(English), with important revisions in editions of 1706 (Latin), 1717,\n1721, and 1730 (Newton 1730 [1952]), Newton introduced into biological\ndiscussions new issues that played out in complex ways in the\nsubsequent decades.\n\nOn one reading of Newton, his conception of active forces introduced\nback into life science a concept of \u201cdynamic\u201d matter that\ncould be used as a warrant for a new vitalistic embryology and even a\nnon-mechanistic conception of nature possessed of intrinsic powers\n(Schofield 1970: chp. 9). This option was followed out by many French\nmedical writers who used Newtonian arguments to ground a\n\u201cvitalistic\u201d medical theory, an interpretation\nparticularly developed at the University of Montpellier in the early\ndecades of the eighteenth century (Wolfe 2014; Gaukroger 2010: chps.\n10\u201311).\n\nBut in the more \u201cmechanistic\u201d interpretation of\nNewtonianism, this retained the inert character of matter and endorsed\nmany of the main features of Cartesian biomechanism, but with the\naddition of mathematical quantification and some use of attractive and\nrepulsive microforces (Schofield 1970: chp. 1). In this tradition of\ninterpretation, one finds a commitment to mechanistic preformationism\nand even strong \u201cpreexistence\u201d theory. This can be\nfollowed in the medical theories of Hermann Boerhaave, Archibald\nPitcairne (1652\u20131713), Richard Mead (1673\u20131754), and other\nNewtonian iatromechanists who typically had contact with the great\nDutch medical schools (Guerrini 1987).\n\nNewton had also argued in the long thirty-first Query to the\nOpticks against \u201cWorld-Building\u201d of the Cartesian\nform, as discussed above. Newton saw this as claiming that the world\n\u201cmight arise out of a Chaos by the mere Laws of Nature\u201d\n(Newton 1730 [1952], 378), and condemned this as\n\u201cunphilosophical\u201d (ibid., 401). Revival of\nrealistically interpreted historical cosmology in the eighteenth\ncentury involved a clear break with these Newtonian strictures. This\nshift will be developed in the following section.\n2.4 Revitalizing Nature\n\nThe development of new conceptualizations of the relation of organic\nbeings to the history of the world, and the relation of species\npermanence to this history, was achieved in the eighteenth century.\nThis included the breakdown of universal mechanism, the introduction\nof dynamic theories of matter, new theories of embryological\nformation, and a reconceptualization of the relation of time to the\nmaterial world. It also involved the formulation of progressive and\ndevelopmental, rather than \u201cdegenerating\u201d, conceptions of\nthe history of life. The following discussion will selectively examine\naspects of these developments. The reader is referred to major recent\nhistorical syntheses for further development of the more general\nintellectual and scientific context (Zammito 2018; Gaukroger 2010;\nReill 2005; Rudwick 2005).\n\nIn several respects these developments are connected in some way to\nthe introduction of dynamic conceptions of matter that emerged in the\ninterplay between Newtonianism and Leibnizianism in the early decades\nof the eighteenth century, particularly in French discussions (Shank\n2008). As described in the previous section, Newton\u2019s\nintroduction in the Queries to the Opticks of the concept of\nactive microforces that could explain microchemical and electrical\nphenomena opened up this discussion. The other great natural\nphilosophy developed on the Continent by Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) and systematized and expanded into an influential\nsystematic philosophical program by Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754),\nelaborated a more complex theory of matter that distinguished between\nthe properties of phenomenal \u201cmatter\u201d as conceived by\nNewton, and those of a more fundamental active and\nteleologically-directed \u201csubstance\u201d, grounded in force\n(vis). In physics this development played out on the\nContinent in the vis viva controversy, which was concerned\ninitially with the conservation of force in collisions. It was then\nextended to more fundamental metaphysical issues that had a complex\neffect on the life sciences.\n\nIn the life sciences, these issues were manifest in debates over the\nrole of vital powers in the explanation of living properties, as these\nwere developed particularly in French discussions in the complex\ninteractions of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian natural\nphilosophies. An influential example of this synthesis is\n\u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s (1706\u20131749)\nInstitutions de Physique (first ed. 1740, second ed. 1742).\nThese hybrid Leibnizian- Newtonian syntheses, bringing together\naspects of Newton\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d forces with the monad\nand substance theory of Leibnizianism, were subsequently extended into\ndiscussions of embryology by Pierre de Maupertuis (1698\u20131759),\nand as will be developed in the next section, by Georges-Louis\nLeClerc, Comte de Buffon (1707\u201388) in the 1740s. \n\nIt is in the context of these discussions that we encounter the first\nearly modern systematic speculations connecting naturalistic theories\nof earth history, embryological development, and changes of organic\nspecies in response to external changes of conditions of life. These\nconnections develop directly out of critiques of the preexistence\ntheory of generation by Maupertuis and Buffon, who in different but\nrelated ways reformulated the \u201cmechanistic\u201d epigenetic\nembryology previously advocated by Descartes and Atomist theorists.\nSimilar to these discarded theories (see above, Section 2.2), the\nexistence of equivalent male and female \u201cseeds\u201d was\npostulated, which were then assumed to combine in sexual generation to\nform the embryo. The new eighteenth-century versions supplemented\nthese seventeenth- century accounts with a novel role for dynamic\nconceptions of matter and inherent organizing forces. In the case of\nBuffon, these claims were supported by controversial microscopic\nobservations that presumably refuted the opposing claims made by\nWilliam Harvey a century earlier (Sloan, 1992a). We can conveniently\ndate these developments from the speculations of Pierre de Maupertuis,\nput forth in two treatises, the better known the Physical\nVenus (V\u00e9nus physique) published in 1745\n(Maupertuis 1745 [1966]). To deal with the difficulty of explaining\nhow atomistic seeds derived from the male and female could be formed\ninto the complexity of the embryo, Maupertuis drew upon a version of\nNewtonian attraction inherent in these seeds which also included\nelements of Leibnizian monad theory. In his last formulation of 1751\nhe expanded on this with the claim that the particles themselves were\nendowed with an internal principle that led them to arrange themselves\nto form specific parts of the fetus. Maupertuis\u2019 dynamic\n\u201cepigenesis\u201d incorporated both mechanism and dynamic\nmaterialism (Terrall 2002: chp. 7; Hoffheimer 1982).\n\nThere are at least three ways in which the change in embryological\ntheory instituted by Maupertuis, and subsequently elaborated by\nBuffon, proved to be relevant to the broader question of the\nhistorical transformation of species. First, this new account of the\nembryological origin of the individual organism meant that it actually\nis organized in historical time rather than pre-existing and simply\nunfolding at an opportune moment. Second, it involved a theory of\nmaterial inheritance that explained the passing on of physical traits\nfrom one generation to the next through the transmission of particles\nof matter. Third, the conservation of the identity of the species is\nguaranteed only by the accurate transmission of this material\ninheritance. If this transmission is affected by external\ncircumstances in any way, significant historical change in the lineage\nof ancestor and descendant is possible. These options, opened up by\nMaupertuis\u2019s speculations, were subsequently developed within an\ninstitutional setting by Buffon.\n3. Buffon\u2019s Transformation of Enlightenment Natural History\n\nThe complex set of issues described in the preceding discussion were\nall brought together in the work of Buffon. In a remarkable career\ntransition in 1739 in which he moved from his position as a pensioned\nmathematician in the Paris Royal Academy of Sciences, to the\nDirectorship of the King\u2019s Garden and Natural History Cabinet\n(Jardin du Roi) in Paris, Buffon brought with him to the\ndomain of natural history and to his reflection on issues in biology\nhis deep familiarity with the major theoretical debates dividing\nNewtonians, Cartesians, and Leibnizians in his era. He was also\nintimately acquainted, through his friend Maupertuis. with the debates\nover generation theory and theories of the earth. He fashioned these\ningredients into a set of new perspectives that were to define his\nnovel approach to the life sciences over the last half-century of the\nBourbon monarchy. In the interpretation of this article, Buffon is the\nmajor figure to put together a set of issues that formed the\npre-conditions for transformism in biology, although he would never\nhimself move into this theoretical region. Through his immensely\npopular writings, translated into all major European languages, he\nexerted an influence on discussions that ranged from St. Petersburg in\nRussia to Virginia in the American colonies.\n\nBuffon was able to exert such influence through the concrete\ninstitutional basis provided by the Jardin du Roi, with its\nattendant large Cabinet of specimens collected from all over\nthe world. Under his leadership was created the pre-eminent\neighteenth-century center of research into comparative anatomy,\nchemistry, mineralogy, botany, and biogeographical study (Spary 2000).\nBy providing an institutional setting for these inquiries, the\nspeculations and theoretical reflections of eighteenth-century natural\nhistorians could be subjected to organized critique and specialized\nexamination in a context not found elsewhere in the natural-historical\nsciences of the period. Buffon\u2019s theoretical vision provided a\nconcrete framework against which those immediately associated with the\nJardin were able to develop further reflections on such\nissues as the nature and duration of species, the significance of\ncomparative anatomical studies, the historical relationships of forms,\nthe meaning of fossils, and the systematic relations of living beings\nto one another. Only Buffon\u2019s contemporary, Carolus Linnaeus\n(1707\u20131778), Professor of Medicine and Botany at the University\nof Uppsala in Sweden after 1741, had similar authority in the domain\nof natural history, and Linnaeus did not have the resources and the\ninstitutional authority that characterized the Jardin in the\nlast days of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\nThis simultaneous emergence of Linnaeus and Buffon in the natural\nhistorical sciences of the middle Enlightenment created a major\nrivalry of traditions of inquiry that would play out on several\nfronts. In Buffon, one had the model of the grand and eloquent\ntheoretician of nature who developed major themes in Enlightenment\nnatural philosophy and applied these to biological topics. In\nLinnaeus, one had a pious systematizer of the natural world of his\nera, whose monumental System of Nature (first edition 1735),\nalong with numerous other works, formed the basis for modern\nbiological classification. Their different approaches set the stage\nfor a major theoretical conflict of traditions in natural historical\nscience that would eventually be synthesized in the nineteenth century\n(Hoquet 2007).\n3.1 Buffon and the Methodology of Natural History\n\nBuffon\u2019s development of a broad theoretical inquiry into natural\nhistory within the framework of a state-sponsored institutional\nstructure warrants the special attention given here to his\ncontribution in the history of evolutionary theory. These included:\n(1) his methodological revolution in the epistemology of the\nnatural-historical sciences; (2) his analysis and proposed solution to\nthe problem of animal and plant generation; (3) his\nreconceptualization of the concept of biological species; (4) his bio-\ngeographical approach to the issues of animal distribution and\nvariation; (5) his renewed theoretical attention to issues of\ncosmology and the \u201ctheory of the earth;\u201d and finally (6),\nhis concluding synthesis of earth and life history in the grand\nnaturalistic account published as his monumental Les\n(originally Des) \u00c9poques de la Nature\n(Epochs of Nature) of 1778\u20139, which provided a model\nfor similar syntheses of the nineteenth century. Through this\ncombination of several lines of earlier inquiry, Buffon posed a series\nof theoretical questions that were further explored by important\nsuccessors associated with the Paris Museum in the nineteenth century\nand by natural historians of the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncentury more generally.\n\nIn his position as a natural philosopher, in dialogue with the works\nof Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, Clairaut, Du Ch\u00e2telet, the French\nEncyclopedists, and major English philosophers of his period,\nBuffon explored foundational methodological and philosophical\nquestions of the Enlightenment in combination with his analysis of\nempirical questions. One expression of this wider vision was the\nunusual way in which he sought to validate the inquiry into natural\nhistory in relation to a naturalized epistemology that scholars have\nseen as novel for its time (Hoquet 2005; Sloan 2006b; Roger 1997a,\nchp. 9, 1997b, chp. 6). In developing a new methodological approach to\nnatural history, Buffon claimed to ground his arguments on a form of\nempirical certitude\u2014\u201cphysical truth\u201d\n[verit\u00e9 physique]\u2014attained through inquiries\ninto the concrete relations of beings in their material relations.\nThis he opposed to the \u201cabstractions\u201d of mathematical\nphysics, extending the Leibnizian-inspired critique of Newtonian\nmethodology as developed in \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\n(1706\u20131749) Institutions de Physique, a work Buffon is\nknown to have read and admired as he made his transition into his\ncareer in natural history (Ch\u00e2telet, 1740). Developing this\nargument in a long \u201cDiscourse on Method\u201d that opened the\nfirst volume of his Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et\nparticuli\u00e8re, avec la description du cabinet du roi\n(Buffon [HN]) (1749), Buffon argued that a science based on repeated\nobservation of concrete material relations of bodies can achieve a\ndegree of epistemic certitude which surpasses that available from the\nmathematical analysis of nature (Hoquet 2005; Grene & Depew 2004;\nRoger 1997a, chp. 6; Sloan 2006b). On the basis of this novel\nepistemological framework, oriented to the search for\n\u201cphysical\u201d truth, Buffon thus directed natural history\naway from a primarily classificatory project. The latter project,\nexemplified by the work of his contemporary Linnaeus, Buffon\ncriticized for imposing \u201cabstract\u201d categories on nature.\nIn its place, Buffon sought to analyze living beings in relation to\ntheir material conditions of existence. This was to be focused on\ntheir reproductive relationships, biogeographical distribution, and in\nhis later work, on their connections to cosmology and historical\ngeology.\n\nThese insights formed an epistemological framework for the subsequent\ndevelopment of the Histoire naturelle. In these discussions\nBuffon dealt both with issues in the foundational epistemology and\nmethodology of the natural-historical sciences as well as with the\ngeneralities and specifics of organic beings. Although the work was\noriginally intended as a survey of the entire range of animals,\nplants, and minerals, in its actual realization, it was more limited.\nThe first series of fourteen volumes (Buffon HN) appeared between 1749\nand 1767 and dealt with the genesis of the solar system and the earth,\nthe generation of animals, the varieties of the human species, and the\nnatural history of the primary quadrupeds and apes. The main quadruped\nvolumes of the first series, beginning in 1753, were written in\ncollaboration with the comparative anatomist Marie-Louis Daubenton\n(1716\u20131800). A series of seven volumes of Supplements\n(1774\u201389) offered additional reflections and additions to these\narticles and expanded on his views on the history of the earth, the\nquadrupeds, and anthropology. These also reported on experiments on\nthe strength of wood and the cooling of metals that he applied to\ndating the age of the earth. In the fifth supplementary volume (1778),\nBuffon presented his grand synthesis of cosmology, earth history, and\nthe history of life, the \u00c9poques de la nature (English\ntrans., Zalasiewicz et. al, 2018) (see below, 3.3). An additional five\nvolumes (1783\u201388) dealt with issues of mineralogy, chemistry,\nfire, and the main forces of nature, especially electricity and\nmagnetism.\n3.2 Buffon on the Generation of Organisms\n\nThe concrete manifestation of Buffon\u2019s combination of novel\nmethodology and empirical inquiry is first displayed by his treatment\nof embryological generation in the second volume of his Natural\nHistory (1749). These principles also underlie his unusual\nanalysis of the meaning of \u201cspecies\u201d in natural history.\nIn both instances, the notion of epistemic certitude gained from a\n\u201cconstant recurrence\u201d of events plays a fundamental role\nin his reflections. Following the lead of his friend Maupertuis,\nBuffon also endorsed the theory of the male and female seeds to\nexplain sexual generation, deriving the origin of the embryo from the\nmechanical mixture of these ingredients. Amplifying upon\nMaupertuis\u2019s prior speculations (see above Section 2.4), he\nexplained the organization of the particles of these two seeds into a\nstructured whole through microforces closely identified with Newtonian\nattractive forces that formed an organizing force-field, an\n\u201cinternal mould\u201d, that assimilated matter in the proper\norder for embryological development. Viewed in longer historical\nperspective, Buffon\u2019s theory of the internal mould functioned in\na way similar to Aristotle\u2019s notion of an immanent substantial\nform, and was likely influenced by Aristotle\u2019s discussions in\nDe generatione animalium (see above Section 1.1). This\n\u201cmould\u201d serves as an immanent principle of organization\nthat acts in company with matter to structure the unified organism by\ngradual development. The internal mould also guaranteed the\nperpetuation of like by like over time. Unlike Aristotle\u2019s\nsubstantial form, however, Buffon\u2019s internal mould is without an\ninternal finality in its action. It is also not a principle of\nvitalization.\n\nTo explain the formation of the fetus, Buffon was conceptually\nrequired to attribute some new powers to matter to account for\norganization. In pursuing this option, he broke with universal\nmechanism and the assumption of the passivity of matter that was an\nintrinsic component of the mechanical philosophy and some\ninterpretations of Newtonianism (see above Section 2.3). There are\nalso important similarities of his new \u201cvitalism\u201d to that\nfound in Leibnizian discussions such as was expounded in the\nInstitutions de Physique of \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\nin 1740 (Sloan 2019). To give a plausible account of embryological\nformation, vital properties therefore had to be attributed to a\nspecific kind of matter confined to living beings, the organic\nmolecules, which had their own inherent dynamic and specifying\nproperties.\n\nThe introduction of the concept of \u201cvital\u201d matter by\nBuffon, even with restrictions on its actions, represents an important\ndevelopment in the history of the life sciences of this period. It\nbroke with the uniformity of matter assumed by the Newtonian,\nGassendist, and Cartesian traditions, and in a limited way it\npositioned Buffon at the opening of the \u201cvitalist\u201d\nrevolution which initiated the first reflections on genuine species\ntransformism, even though Buffon himself never moved into this new\nconceptual domain (Reill 2005: chp. 1).\n\nIn his original presentations, Buffon posited that these internal\nmoulds and specifying organic molecules originated by divine creation.\nAs the Natural History progressed, however, Buffon\nincreasingly viewed the organic molecules to be formed from an\noriginal undifferentiated \u201cbrute\u201d matter, and the internal\nmoulds themselves were seen to arise spontaneously, obtaining their\nspecificity of action purely from the differential forces of\nattraction between different shapes of organic particles (Buffon\n\u201cDe la Nature. Seconde vue\u201d, 1765, [OP, 38\u201341]).\n3.3 Buffon and the Degeneration of Species\n\nIt is in the context of his proposed solution to the issue of organic\ngeneration that Buffon then addressed the issue of organic species and\ntheir permanence. In the fourth volume of the Natural History\n(1753), devoted to the large domestic quadrupeds, Buffon first raised\nthe option of species transformism, only to reject it. In the article\n\u201cThe Ass\u201d, devoted to the domestic donkey, Buffon drew\nattention to the close anatomical similarity between the horse and the\nass, as revealed by his collaborator Daubenton\u2019s anatomical\ndescriptions. This similarity strongly suggested an underlying unity\nof plan of all the quadrupeds, a similarity raising the possibility\nthat all quadrupeds might have been derived in historical time from a\nsingle stem (souche) which \u201cin the succession of time,\nhas produced, by perfection and degeneration, all the other\nanimals\u201d (Buffon 1753, [OP, 355]). In a move that has confused\ncommentators every since, Buffon then rejected this possibility and\ninstead argued that because of the infertility of hybrids, species\nmust have been distinct from the beginning.\n\nThe explanation of Buffon\u2019s initial 1753 rejection of\ntransformism, and his subsequent development of proto-evolutionary\nviews as the Natural History progressed, has taken many forms\n(Bowler 2003: chp. 3; Lovejoy 1911 [1959]). The argument of this\narticle is that both Buffon\u2019s initial rejection of transformism,\nand his subsequent development toward the acceptance of historical\nspecies change reflect a coherent and consistent development of his\nconcept of \u201cphysical truth\u201d (see above Section 3.1).\nDrawing on his emphasis on serial recurrence and material connection\nas the foundation of physical truth, the species is maintained in time\nand given its ontological reality by the recurring passing on of the\ninternal mould which shapes the organic molecules into a new organism\nin time. \n\nThis analysis implied for Buffon a significant redefinition of the\nconcept of an organic species, a redefinition that has affected the\ntradition of natural history and biology since the 1750s. Buffon\nexplicitly rejected the long-accepted meaning of \u2018species\u2019\nas a universal\u2014 or, in modern parlance, a \u201cclass\u201d\nconcept, constituted by a set of individuals on the basis of\npossession of explicit defining properties. This was the meaning\nimplicit in the Linnaean classification of his time. This concept\nBuffon criticized as an \u201cabstract\u201d meaning of species. By\ncontrast, Buffon defined a species in natural history exclusively as\nthe historical succession of ancestor and descendant linked by\nmaterial connection through generation. Such a species\nis,\u201c\u2026 neither the number nor the collection of similar\nindividuals which forms the species; it is the constant succession and\nuninterrupted renewal of these individuals which constitutes it\u201d\n(Buffon 1753, [OP, 355]).\n\nThe empirical sign of this essential unity of the species over time is\nthe ability of its members to interbreed and produce fertile\noffspring, a criterion that takes precedence over similarities of\nanatomy or habits of life. The horse and ass must be two different\nspecies because they cannot interbreed and produce fertile offspring,\nwhatever may be their anatomical resemblances. The dogs, on the other\nhand, must, in spite of great morphological differences between\nbreeds, constitute one species because of their interfertility. \n\nIn setting forth this new meaning of \u2018species\u2019 in natural\nhistory, and distinguishing it from the alternative meaning of species\nas a logical universal, Buffon was doing more than distinguishing the\n\u201ccategory\u201d from the \u201ctaxon\u201d as these terms\nhave come to be understood in contemporary philosophy of biology. In\nan important sense, Buffon introduced an opposition between\nthese two meanings of \u201cspecies\u201d found in the tradition\nreaching back to Aristotle (see Section 1.1 above), granting\n\u201creality\u201d in biology only to species conceived as material\nsuccessions of individuals sharing in the same internal mould spread\nout in time. By contrast, Buffon considered the understanding of\nspecies in the sense of a universal class concept to be\n\u201cabstract\u201d and \u201cartificial\u201d.\n\nThis explicit opposition of two meanings of \u201cspecies\u201d\nintroduced by Buffon, divorcing concepts previously linked together by\na complex relation of thought and world within the Aristotelian and\nScholastic discussions, has been seen by some commentators as marking\nthe introduction of a fundamental confusion over the conception of\nspecies in subsequent discussions in the biological literature. This\nis at least one of the underlying causes of the so-called\n\u201cspecies problem\u201d. In their historical extension, these\nissues continue to generate contemporary disputes that oppose\nconceptions of \u201cspecies as sets\u201d to those of\n\u201cspecies as spatio-temporal individuals\u201d (Dupr\u00e9\n1993; Ereshefsky (ed.) 1992; Ghiselin 1997; Hull 1999; R.A. Richards\n2010; Sloan 1987, 2013; Stamos 2003; Wheeler & Meier (eds) 2000;\nWilkins 2009; R.A. Wilson (ed.) 1999; and the entry on species in this\nencyclopedia).\n\nThe subsequent developments in Buffon\u2019s thought toward what an\nolder tradition of scholarship mistakenly interpreted to be\n\u201cevolutionism\u201d, involved the gradual broadening of his\nnatural-historical or \u201cphysical\u201d species to include wider\nand wider degrees of material relationship. This expansion of his\noriginal species concept Buffon expressed in the language of a\n\u201cdegeneration\u201d of forms in time in response to\nenvironmental conditions.\n\nThe encounter with a wide body of new data from the colonies and\nexploratory voyages returned to Paris during the course of the writing\nof the Natural History impressed Buffon with the degree to\nwhich species seemed to be affected by external circumstances such\nthat from a single source numerous \u201cdegenerations\u201d could\narise in some groups. This formed the conceptual basis for his concept\nof a race as distinguished from a Linnaean Variety.\nA \u201crace\u201d in the Buffonian sense was a historical\ndegeneration from a common ancestor that maintained material and\nhistorical connection to this common source form. But this lineage\ncould undergo substantial and quasi-permanent hereditary\ndifferentiation into different lineages, with the cause of these\ndegenerations explained by slight changes in the organic molecules\nproduced by varying environmental circumstances as a given physical\nspecies migrates to new environments. These slight changes in turn\naffected the internal mould. Developed in greatest detail in his long\narticle, \u201cOn the Degeneration of Animals\u201d in volume XIV\n(1766) of the Natural History, Buffon\u2019s theory of the\ndegeneration of species extended so far as to allow the lumping of the\nquadrupeds of both the Old and New worlds into a limited number of\nprimary \u201cfamilies\u201d (familles) and\n\u201cgenera\u201d (genres) that from points of origin in\nthe Northern European hemisphere, have degenerated in time in response\nto migration to new locales. By including human beings in this\nnaturalistic scenario in his later writings, and assuming that human\nlineages underwent similar degenerative changes as they migrated from\ntheir postulated point of origin of human beings in the Caucasus,\nBuffon\u2019s theory played a major role in the development of\nEnlightenment racial theory (Sloan 1973, 2014).\n\nBuffon subsequently made some steps toward combining the thesis of the\nhistorical degeneration of species with his theory of historical\ncosmology in his late Des (subsequently Les)\n\u00c9poques de la Nature first published in\nSuppl\u00e9ments volume 5 (1788), and subsequently issued\nseparately in 1789. In this treatise he reworked his earlier\nspeculations on the \u201ctheory of the earth\u201d, first set out\nin 1749, adding to this a historical chronology of the age of the\nearth determined experimentally in the 1770s by quantitative studies\non cooling spheres of metal. In this imaginative synthesis, and\ndrawing on an allegorical reading of Genesis 1, Buffon\ncombined a history of the Earth with a historical sequence of the\nemergence of living forms (Buffon 1779 [1988]; Zalasiewicz et al.,\n2018). In doing so he expanded the time scale of earth history\nconsiderably beyond the accepted \u201cMosaic\u201d chronology of\nless than 10,000 years from the beginning of the world to the present,\nto an estimate of approximately 75,000 years in the published version,\nand over two million years in his draft manuscript. In this treatise\nBuffon offered a naturalistic solution to the two inherited Cartesian\ndilemmas. First, his schema was offered as a realistic account. The\nCartesian language of counter-factualism has disappeared. Second, he\nintegrated the history of living forms into this comprehensive history\nof the world. Further naturalizing his theory of the internal moulds\nand organic molecules, both were now seen to arise by natural laws\nfrom the natural attraction of different shapes of matter and from the\nchanges in matter as the earth cooled from its origin in matter cast\noff by the sun. Animals first originated by the spontaneous clumping\ntogether of these organic molecules on the cooling earth (Buffon 1779\n[1988]: Fifth Epoch).\n\nThe Epochs also offered a schema for a historical sequence of\nforms that appear sequentially in a series of six major\n\u201cepochs\u201d to which Buffon gives precise dates of duration.\nThis begins with the origin of the earth from a cooled star, and then\ndescribes the beginning of living nature with marine life and plants\nin the early stages of the earth\u2019s history, terminating with\npresent forms His account even suggested a naturalistic origin of\nhuman beings, although this issue is left vague. Humankind appears,\nwithout explanation in the text, in a non-paradisal state in the\nnorthern latitudes of Eurasia, surrounded by ferocious animals,\nearthquakes and floods, and in a primitive social condition that\nrequired collaboration for survival. Buffon\u2019s liberal use of a\nform of spontaneous generation that allowed for the origin of even\nmajor animal groups from the clumping together of organic molecules as\nthe earth cooled, rendered the actual derivation of forms from\nprevious forms unnecessary. In several respects, the development of\ngenuine transformist theories by Buffon\u2019s successors required a\nmuch more restricted use of the possibility of spontaneous generation.\n\n3.4 The Reception of Buffon\u2019s Natural History \n\nBeyond the confines of the Paris Jardin, the reflections\ninspired by Buffon for wider discussions of the late Enlightenment\nnatural history were complex. The reception of his Les\n\u00c9poques de la Nature, for example, was uneven (Roger\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d in Buffon 1779, [1988, cxxiv]). Although\nthe main body of the Natural History was translated three\nseparate times into English (William Kenrick and J. Murdoch\n[1775\u201376]; William Smellie [1785], James S. Barr [1792], the\nEpochs was never translated into English until recently\n(Zalasiewicz et al., 2018), and it seems to have played an\ninsignificant role in anglophone discussions, in contrast, for\nexample, to the major impact of the works of Linnaeus, which received\na wide British exposition and translation. The boldly speculative\ncharacter of the Epochs was also at odds with the new\nprofessionalized inquiries into geology and natural history undertaken\nby a younger generation of naturalists who may have adopted\nBuffon\u2019s naturalism and extension of geochronology, but not his\ngrand rhetorical style (Rudwick 2005: chp. 3).\n\nHistorical research has shown, however, that the Epochs had\nan influential history in the Germanies (Schmitt, 2019). The treatise\nwas quickly (1781) translated into German at St. Petersburg and it\nseems to have played an important role in the development of German\nhistoricism (Reill 1992). Although linkages are in need of further\nscholarly research, the impact of Buffon\u2019s Epochs on\nthe historical transformism sketched out a few years later by Johann\nGottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) in the first volume of his\nmagisterial Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der\nMenschheit (1784\u2013 91) is suggested by several lines of\nevidence (Zammito 2018: 180\u2013185, 2018b).\n\nHerder departed markedly from Buffon, however, in developing his own\nhistorical theory of the cosmos and the development of life, and\neventually of human culture, on a framework of teleological progress\nbased on a \u201cvital\u201d theory of matter. For Herder, not only\nthe individual organism, but nature as a whole develops under the\ncausation of an internal organic force that leads it to develop higher\nand higher stages of life, eventually resulting in the ultimate\ndevelopment of humankind in history.\n4. Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, one can follow several lines of\nreflection admitting some form of species transformism and a\nhistorical development of life. In the Germanies, Herder\u2019s\nreflections formed a major ingredient in the development of German\nNaturphilosophie and \u201cRomantic\u201d science that was\nexpanded in the writings of Johann Goethe (1749\u20131832),\nFriederich Schelling (1775\u20131854), Gottfried Treviranus\n(1776\u20131837) and several others who advocated some version of a\nhistorically progressive philosophy of nature with at least the\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d if not actual transformism of species in\ntime (Zammito 2018: chps. 8,9,11; R. J. Richards 2002: chps. 2, 3, 8).\nIn the British Isles in the same period, the reflections in the second\nvolume of his Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life\n(1794\u20131796) of Erasmus Darwin (1731\u20131802), grandfather of\nCharles Darwin, offered a theory of species development based on a\nconcept of dynamic living matter. These multiple lines of late\neighteenth-century reflection advocating some form of a general\ntransformism of species and a history of living nature, each of which\ncan be followed out in detail, can be differentiated from the\ninstitutional framework of discussion established in France after\nBuffon at the Mus\u00e9um nationale d\u2019histoire\nnaturelle in Paris, the post-Revolutionary successor to the\nJardin du roi. These institutional developments supplied a\nnew precision and a concrete material context for the professional\ndiscussion of transformist question as it emerged in the nineteenth\ncentury. This institutional framework of French discussion will be\nemphasized in the following while acknowledging the broader context of\ndiscussion outside of France. \n\nBuffon\u2019s leadership of the Jardin ended with his death\nin April of 1788 on the edge of the massive social, political and\nscientific changes that were to overtake France a year later. As the\nonly major French scientific organization to survive the dismantling\nof all other institutions of privilege by the National Convention in\nthe summer of 1793, the reconstituted and reorganized\nMus\u00e9um nationale d\u2019histoire naturelle provided\nan unusual context for the further development of transformist\ntheories (Blanckaert et al. [eds] 1997). In its new form, the\nMus\u00e9um created an institutional context in which\nseveral aspects of Buffon\u2019s grand undertaking in natural history\ncould be refined and deepened in the decades following his death\n(Corsi 1983 [1988: chp. 1]). In the Revolutionary context of the new\nRepublic, the work of Linnaeus and his classificatory approach to\nnatural history, admired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but overshadowed\nbefore 1789 by the authority of Buffon, was elevated at the\nMus\u00e9um to a new level of authority. The two rival\nleaders of natural history in effect became for the French naturalists\nwhat George Cuvier (1769\u20131832) later described as \u201ctwo\nfounts\u201d from which they jointly drew their inspiration.\n\nThe Revolutionary reorganization of the Jardin also created a\nnew kind of specialization of research and disciplinary division\nwithin what had previously been conceived of as \u201cnatural\nhistory\u201d. The reorganization of 1793 established within the\nMus\u00e9um twelve separate Chairs of equal status that\ngave specific individuals control over portions of the collections and\nthe research work done within these divisions that instituted new\ndisciplinary specializations within natural history. \u201cMammals\nand Birds\u201d were placed under Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\n(1772\u20131844). \u201cReptiles and Fishes\u201d were assigned to\nBuffon\u2019s understudy Bernard de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de\n(1756\u20131825). \u201cHuman Anatomy\u201d was given to Antoine\nPortal (1742\u20131832). The creation of a new Chair of Comparative\nAnatomy, with an attendant separate museum established in 1802,\nprovided the position for the young Alsatian zoologist Georges Cuvier\n(1769\u20131832). The large conglomerate of forms, known previously\nonly as \u201cWorms\u201d (Vers), was placed under the\ncontrol of Buffon\u2019s one-time understudy Jean Baptiste Pierre\nAntoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744\u20131829). Other chairs\nin botany, paleontology, comparative physiology, and anthropology were\nestablished, or would be developed in the nineteenth century. All\nthese new institutional structures subdivided traditional\n\u201cnatural history\u201d, and facilitated professionalized\ninquiries into specific areas of life science that related to the\nnature of species, the interpretations of the classificatory systems,\nand to the history and biogeography of the earth (Corsi 1983 [1988:\nchp. 1]; Appel 1987).\n4.1 Lamarckian Transformism\n\nIt is in this context, and through his position as the first holder of\nthe Chair of \u201cWorms\u201d that Jean Baptiste de Lamarck\ndeveloped during his tenure the first coherent theory of species\nchange over historical time, eventually known by the new\nterm\u2014transformisme. Lamarck in many respects warrants\nthe claim to be the first genuine evolutionary thinker situated within\na professional scientific institution.\n\nLamarck\u2019s theory of species transformism emerged gradually in\nhis annual Mus\u00e9um lectures on the \u201canimals\nwithout vertebrae\u201d that commenced in 1794. As the new occupant\nof the Chair dedicated to this vast array of forms, Lamarck undertook\nin 1794 a massive reorganization of the Mus\u00e9um\ncollections of these animals. To accomplish this, he adapted for their\ntaxonomic organization the method of arrangement of the plant groups\nhe had developed in his earlier work on French botany (Lamarck, 1778),\ncreated during his formative years when he worked in the\nJardin as a botanist. In this early botanical work he had\nordered groups serially from most complex flowering plants to most\nsimple fungi. Lamarck then adopted a similar method for his initial\narrangement of the invertebrate groups of animals.\n\nBut the complexity of the invertebrate groups prevented any simple\nlinear arrangement, and the complex classification of the\ninvertebrates Lamarck worked out provided him with an empirical base\nfrom which his transformist theory was subsequently developed\n(Burkhardt 1977). Expounded though his annual Mus\u00e9um\nlectures, Lamarck was able to develop these arguments in interaction\nwith the wide array of collections of invertebrate animals at the\nMus\u00e9um.\n\nIn view of the many interpretations of Lamarck\u2019s views that have\nemerged since the public presentations of his theory in his 1802\nR\u00e9cherches sur l\u2019organisation des corps vivants,\nand in developed form in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique\n(Zoological Philosophy, [Eng. 1914, 1963]), and in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to his Histoire naturelle des animaux\nsans vert\u00e8bres (HASV, 1815\u20131822), the\nprimary features of Lamarck\u2019s reflections need to be carefully\ndetailed. In most fundamental terms, his theory of species change was\ntied to his reversal of the taxonomic ordering of forms\noriginally presented in his early systematic arrangements. In his\noriginal classifications, these groups were ordered in a series of\n\u201cprincipal masses\u201d (masses principales) that\nbegan with the most complex invertebrates forms (cephalopods) and\nterminated in the least organized (polyps\u2014hydra, sponges,\nanemones). By 1800, Lamarck decided that this ordering was artificial,\nand that the \u201cnatural\u201d arrangement was a complex series\nrunning from simpler forms to those more complex. The evolutionary\ntheory he subsequently developed involved the claim that this new\norder of arrangement was also representative of the historical\nsequence by which forms had been generated one from another over\ntime.\n\nThese novel conclusions were first presented in the\nMus\u00e9um lectures of 1800, and then were developed in\nmore detail in print in his Recherches (1802), with the full\nexposition in his Philosophie zoologique and the\nHASV. Some further significant elaborations of his ideas were\nthen expressed in his many articles for the second edition of Joseph\nVirey\u2019s Nouveau dictionnaire d\u2019histoire naturelle\n(1817\u201319) (Lamarck 1817\u201319 [1991]). His theoretical\nconclusions were also concretely displayed in the arrangement of\nspecimens in the main zoology gallery of the Mus\u00e9um\nover which he had primary control. The following claims formed the\ncore of his mature theory:\n\n The origin of living beings is initially through spontaneous\ngeneration. This action is confined, however, to the origins of the\nmost structurally-simple forms of life\u2014infusoria and polyps. All\nsubsequent forms necessarily havae developed in some way in time from\nthe elementary beginning in these simplest forms.\n The causal agency behind this \u201cascending\u201d, rathr than\n\u201cdegenerating\u201d, history of life over time is supplied by\nthe activity of dynamic material agencies\u2014caloric and electrical\nfluids. The entry of these active material agencies into inorganic\nmatter produces the spontaneous generation of the elementary plants,\nthe microscopic infusoria, and the simplest polyps. This also provides\nthe causal impetus by which these simple forms can give rise to forms\nof higher complexity, moving to the radiarians, and so on up the\nseries. Moving beyond the distinction of \u201cinert\u201d and\n\u201cliving\u201d matter of his mentor Buffon, Lamarck\u2019s\ntheories generally can be considered \u201cvitalist\u201d in\ninspiration, in that they attribute a genuine dynamism to living\nmatter and grant it the ability to create new forms and structures\nthrough its inherent powers. Lamarck denied, however, any appeal to\nspecial supperadded vital forces, and his reliance on the causal role\nof dyanmic Newtonian aetherial fluids grounded his theory on a concept\nof active matter that can be termed a theory of \u201cvital\nmaterialism\u201d.\n The Lamarckian \u201cseries\u201d that underlies Lamarckian\ntransformism is not a linear series of species and genera, but a\nhierarchy of primary organizational plans that emerge from\nlesser-organized plans. This moves generally from simpler forms to the\nmore complex and results withint the animal kingdom in an axis of\nfourteen primary groups, terminating in the higher vertebrates, the\nmammals. This parallels the \u201cnatural\u201d order of\nclassification of groups he had developed in his taxonomic system.\nPosition in the series is defined primarily in terms of the structural\nand functional elaboration of the nervous system. Also involved in\nthis dynamic ordering of groups, but only at the highest levels, are\nthe internal functions of \u201cwill\u201d and \u201ceffort\u201d\nin the development of life.\n The best-known feature of Lamarkism in the subsequent\ntradition\u2014the theory of transformism via the inheritance of\nacquire characters\u2014functions as a subordinate, diversifying\nprocess through which major animal groups are adapted to local\ncircumstances through the elaboration of different species. Such\nadaptation is not, however, the primary cuase of transformation from\ngroup to group up the series. Consequently, in contrast to\nDarwin\u2019s later theory, the primary evolution of life is not\nthrough local adaptation.\n Major transformation between lesser groups may, however, occur\nthrough the action of the use and disuse of structures. For example,\nthe transformation of primates into humans presumably has occurred by\nmeans of this adaptive process accompanied by an internal power of the\nwill.\n\n\nThe complex arrangement and ordering of groups envisioned by Lamarck\nwas a branching image of group development illustrated by the\nfollowing diagram added to his Zoological Philosophy.\nPossibly responding to the analyses by his younger colleague Georges\nCuvier directed at the concept of linear relationships of groups (see\nbelow), Lamarck admitted a more complex branching pattern of group\nrelations, with some showing independent lineages and even different\npoints of origin:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lamarck Diagram from\n\u201cAdditions\u201d to the Philosophie zoologique, first\nedition (1809), (page 463). [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nThis issue was not, however, developed in any theoretical elaboration\nby Lamarck himself. The complexity of these issues in the subsequent\ninterpretations of Lamarck by his successors is an area of active\nresearch (Corsi, 2021, 2012; Jenkins 2019).\n4.2 Paris Museum Debates: Cuvier vs. the Transformists\n\nWithin the confines of the Paris Mus\u00e9um national\nd\u2019histoire naturelle, parallel, if not immediately\ncontinuous, developments of related issues bearing on species\ntransformism were made by Lamarck\u2019s younger colleague and holder\nof the chair of Mammals and Birds, the comparative anatomist Etienne\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire (1772\u20131844). Less concerned with the issue\nof species transformism than with the implications of comparative\nanatomy and comparative embryology for the relations of forms,\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire explored the anatomical \u201cunity of\ntype\u201d\u2014the remarkable resemblance of anatomical structure\nbetween organisms revealed by comparative anatomy. Pursuing this issue\nin his own Mus\u00e9um lectures and in several papers,\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire proceeded to work out the implications of the\ninner anatomical similarities of vertebrates. Based upon two main\nprinciples, the \u201cprinciple of connection\u201d and the\n\u201claw of balance\u201d, Geoffroy St. Hilaire drew attention to\nthe implications of comparative anatomy for the unity of the animal\nkingdom.\n\nBy 1823, Geoffroy St. Hilaire had extended his theory of the\n\u201cunity of type\u201d to the claim that even the invertebrates\nshared a common plan with the vertebrates, and by 1825 he had embraced\na limited version of transformism with assertions that the unity of\ntype also revealed the relationships between ancient and contemporary\nforms (Corsi 2011; Le Guyader 1998 [2004]: chp. 4]). This led him into\ndirect opposition to the claims of his one- time friend and colleague,\nGeorges Cuvier, holder of the Mus\u00e9um Chair of\nComparative Anatomy. who had argued in his Lectures on Comparative\nAnatomy (1800\u20131805) that animal form involved a law-like\ncoordination between form and function for teleological purposes,\nknown as the \u201claw of the correlation of parts.\u201d In his\nR\u00e8gne animale of 1817, this principle was extended to\nthe claim that comparative anatomy revealed a formal distinction of\nfour distinct and autonomous body plans\n(embranchments)\u2014Radiarians, Mollusca, Articulata, and\nVertebrata\u2014that may display some unity of type within these\nembranchments, but which precluded any theory of continuity\nbetween these major plans. \n\nThis anatomical argument was to constitute the mainstay of\nCuvier\u2019s opposition to transformism, and it served as a powerful\nsource of opposition to transformism into the Darwinian era and even\nbeyond. On the basis of these arguments, Cuvier also concluded that\ncomparative anatomy revealed genuine extinctions of species\nin the past. First proposed in his paper on the species of elephants\nin 1795, and then extended more broadly to vertebrate paleontology\ngenerally in such works as his Investigations on the Fossil Bones\nof Quadrupeds (1812), Investigations on Fossil Bones\n(1821\u20131823), and in his Discourse on the Revolutions of the\nSurface of the Earth (1822), Cuvier claimed that constraints of\norganization and the systemic relations of anatomical structures meant\nthat species could not simply transform into others as claimed by\nLamarck and Geoffroy. As he developed its implications, it was\nexpanded into a theory of specific faunal and floral ages separated by\ndramatic events\u2014R\u00e9volutions, later termed by\nothers \u201ccatastrophes\u201d\u2014that led to massive\nextinctions that required replacements of species by some cause that\nwas not specified. The issue of the \u201corigin\u201d of species in\nthe early nineteenth century was a direct consequence of these\nCuvierian extinctions.\n\nThe opposition between Cuvierian organicism and the Lamarck-Geoffroy\nadvocacies of transformism, centered on the claimed implications of\nthe \u201cunity of type.\u201d This underlay the \u201cgreat\ndebate\u201d that broke out in French life science in the late 1820s\nbetween Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier and their respective disciples\n(Corsi 2012; Appel 1987). This debate also forms one of the historic\nencounters between differing conceptions of biology that affected many\naspects of nineteenth-century life science. It drew division lines\nwithin French, and even British, biology over the relation of\norganisms to history, and it directly engaged the possibility of\nspecies change. It also raised the issue of species origins. This\ndebate also served to focus issues within French life science in a way\nthat significantly affected the later negative French reception of\nDarwin\u2019s work. This debate eventually was to involve issues of\npaleontology, comparative anatomy, transformism of species, and the\nrelation of form to function. It also extended to issues of political\nalliance and ideological commitments of numerous individuals in\nRestoration France (Corsi 2011, 2012).\n\nCuvier\u2019s arguments, reinforced by the authority he carried in\nFrench comparative anatomy and science generally, coupled with his\npolitical influence during the Napoleonic and Restoraation periods,\nresulted in the dominance of his positions within the Paris\nAcad\u00e9mie des sciences. Nonetheless, the tradition of\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire remained a strong current within the\nMus\u00e9um. It was continued by such individuals as\nAntoine Etienne Serres (1786\u20131868), whose arguments for a\nhistorical sequence of forms, backed by embryological evidence, were\ncanonized in morphological circles as the Meckel-Serres law of\nrecapitulation (Corsi 2012; Gould 1977: chp. 3). Outside official\nAcademic French science, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire\u2019s theories had\nbroad appeal to those who saw the relevance of developmental\nembryology for issues of group relationship, an issue that Cuvier, as\na moderate preformationist, had ignored. Present interest in the\nrelationship between evolution and developmental\nbiology\u2014commonly termed \u201cevo- devo\u201d\u2014 has\nstimulated new attention to Geoffroy St. Hilaire\u2019s views (Le\nGuyader 1998 [2004]).\n4.3 Transformism in Britain 1830\u20131859\n\nDiscussions of transformism in the British Isles in the pre-Darwinian\nperiod were influenced particularly by the French reflections and the\nFrench debates taking place at the Mus\u00e9um. Following\nthe cessation of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814\u201315, extensive new\ncontacts developed between French and British scientists, particularly\nthrough Edinburgh (Corsi 2021, Jenkins 2011). In addition to French\nconnections, there were also important personal contacts between\nGerman and British scientists that also included the introduction of\nGerman progressive developmentalism and transcendental anatomy in the\nearly decades of the nineteenth century both through Edinburgh, and\nalso directly into London scientific circles. The recognition of these\nnew introductions of French and German science and intellectual\ntraditions into the British Isles, particularly moving through medical\ncontexts, has supplied a new framework for understanding the\nreflections on species change in Britain in the period before the\nadvent of Darwin\u2019s work (Rupke 2009; R. J. Richards 2002; Sloan,\n2003, 1992b; Desmond 1989).\n\nThe Edinburgh comparative anatomist, Robert Edmond Grant (1793\u2013\n1874), played an important role in introducing the French discussions\ninto the British Isles. He would also serve as Charles Darwin\u2019s\nfirst mentor in science when Darwin was a young medical student at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh (1825\u201327). Grant was directly engaged\nwith the issues being debated at the time between Geoffroy St.\nHilaire, Cuvier and Lamarck, and he advocated a variant of a\nLamarckian-Geoffroyean transformism in his writings, themes expounded\nin his lectures on comparative anatomy at the new University College,\nLondon where he became the first professor of comparative anatomy in\n1827 (Desmond 1989). In addition to Grant, several other naturalists\nin Edinburgh brought French discussions into the British context\n(Corsi 2021, Jenkins 2011).\n4.3.1 The Lyellian Critique of Lamarckism\n\nThese French-inspired discussions of transformism entering mainly\nthrough Edinburgh were subjected to a powerful critique by the Scots\nlawyer turned geologist, Charles Lyell (1797\u20131875). In a\ndiscussion that occupied seventeen of eighteen chapters (282 pages) of\nthe second volume (1832) of his landmark three-volume Principles\nof Geology (1830\u201333), Lyell subjected Lamarckian theory to\na multi-level critique that was to influence much of the subsequent\nopposition to transformism in British circles, and posed a wide range\nof issues that Charles Darwin had to overcome subsequently. \n\nOpening with five chapters that analyzed Lamarck\u2019s assumptions\nabout species instability and summarizing his causal explanations of\nboth the serial ascent of life and the plasticity of form and function\nunder the influence of internal causes, Lyell developed a withering\nattack on Lamarckism. In this discussion he questioned the empirical\nevidence for species transformism, both in terms of evidence from\nnatural species, and also the warrant that could be drawn from changes\nthat have been produced in domestic animals and plants by human\nactivity. Moving beyond this, he then questioned the evidence for\nconnections of living forms across biogeographical regions, and the\nevidence for substantial change in historical migrations between zones\nof habitation. \n\nA second level of critique concerned the evidence assumed by Lamarck\n(and Geoffroy) for historical progressionism in the forms of life,\nwith oldest rocks showing simplest forms, and subsequent geological\nformations (Secondary, Tertiary) showing the appearance of higher and\nmore complex forms eventually resulting in the mammals. This theme of\ngeological progress, embraced not only by transformists, but also by\nBritish disciples of Cuvier, was attacked by Lyell with an argument\nthat would later be used by Darwin to different ends\u2014the\nimperfection of the geological record. In Lyell\u2019s view, the\naccidents of fossilization undercut any inference from the fossil\nrecord concerning an assumption of the historical development of life.\nAgainst speculations of Lamarck and others concerning evidence for a\nprogression from simpler forms to those now existing, Lyell replies\nwith reference to plant evidence that,\n\n\nThose naturalists, therefore, who infer that the ancient flora of the\nglobe was, at certain periods, less varied than now, merely because\nthey have as yet discovered only a few hundred fossil species of a\nparticular epoch, while they can enumerate more than fifty thousand\nliving ones, are reasoning on a false basis\u2026: (Lyell 1832\n[1991], 245; see also p. 20).\n\n\nIn examining these issues, Lyell concludes that empirical evidence\nonly supports a claim of limited transformations of a varietal level\nthat remains within natural species boundaries. In Lyell\u2019s\nconclusion, there was no empirical support for the transfomism of\nspecies.\n4.3.2: German Philosophy of Nature and British Developmentalism\n\nIn addition to French-inspired developments of transformism that Lyell\nfocused on in his critique of Lamarck, a lesser-studied introduction\nof German philosophy of nature and German reflections on anatomical\nresemblance formed a different current of reflection with significant\nconsequences for the mid-nineteenth century discussions of the\ntransformist question in the British Isles. The cessation of the\nNapoleonic hostilities was accompanied by the introduction into\nBritish discussions of German scientific thought along with\nexpositions of the systematic philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Hegel and\nSchelling (Sloan 2003). With relevance to species transformism,\nSchelling-inspired themes in the philosophy of nature were expounded\nin the Hunterian Lectures in Comparative Anatomy at the Royal College\nof Surgeons in London, delivered by the British surgeon Joseph Henry\nGreen (1791\u20131863). Green utilized dimensions of\nSchelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie to develop in his lectures\nbetween 1820\u201327 a dynamic theory of group relations which\nsynthesized the work of Lamarck, Cuvier, and the University of\nG\u00f6ttingen medical theorist Johann Blumenbach (1752\u20131840\n(Sloan, 1992b, 2007), relations which he even depicted in tree-like\nbranchings of relationship that went beyond those of Lamarck.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Joseph Henry Green\u2019s\ndiagram of the relations of the invertebrate and vertebrate groups in\n1827 as represented in the notes of Richard Owen. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nThese themes would be continued in the major series of lectures\ndelivered by Green\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at the College of\nSurgeons, the comparative anatomist, Richard Owen (1804\u201392), who\nwas named to the prestigious Hunterian Chair in Comparative Anatomy\n1837 and remained in that position until 1856 (Rupke 1994, 1993; Sloan\n1992b) \n\nOwen\u2019s widely-attended London lectures delivered between 1837\nand 1856 brought many of the issues of comparative anatomy,\nclassication, fossil evidence, and embryology to bear on the questions\nof species relationship and change. In these lectures, presented\nagainst the backdrop of the massive anatomical collections of the\nHunterian Museum in London, Owen developed a reinterpretation of the\nsignificance of the Cuvier-Geoffroy dispute and developed its\nimplications for issues surrounding the historical development of the\nvertebrates as represented in this diagram he made in 1837. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Richard Owen\u2019s\nrepresentation of the relation of the main animal groups in February,\n1837. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nAs a solution to the Cuvier-Geoffroy issues, Owen subsequently\ndeveloped in his Hunterian lectures in 1845 the theory of the\narchetypal vertebrate that connected the anatomical relations of all\nthe vertebrates, a theme he then elaborated in an important set of\npublications in 1847 and 1849 (Owen, 1847, 1849 [2007]). Employing\naspects of William Whewell\u2019s philosophy of science to develop\nthese arguments, Owen expounded the theory of the unity of type in\nrelation to the Cuvierian analysis of the relation of form and\nfunction. In his argument, the archetype, functioning both as a\ntranscendental ideal form and also as an immanent law working in the\nmaterial history of life, explained the progression and\ndifferentiation of the vertebrates in historical time ((Sloan 2003; R.\nJ. Richards 2002: chp. 14; Rupke 1993). \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Richard Owen\u2019s depiction\nof the Archetypal Vertebrate, composed of a series of ideal vertebrae\nas in his On the Nature of the Limbs (1849),\n\u201cAppendix\u201d. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nBy means of this theory, Owen claimed he could coherently explain both\nthe deep resemblance of forms in their internal anatomy\u2014the\ntheme emphasized by Geoffroy St. Hilaire\u2014, and also the close\nfitting of structure and function to the organism\u2019s\n\u201cconditions of existence\u201d, the insight emphasized by\nCuvier.\n\nTo distinguish these two meanings of relationship, Owen introduced\ninto the literature in 1843 a crucial distinction between resemblances\nof \u201chomology\u201d, meaning the presence of the\n\u201csame\u201d parts in every variety of form and\nfunction\u2014Geoffroyean relationships\u2014and those of\n\u201canalogy\u201d, denoting solely the similarity of parts in\ntheir functional adaptations\u2014Cuvierian relationships. Developing\nthis concept of homology in relation to his theory of the archetype,\nOwen claimed he could at last give a coherent meaning to the concept\nof \u201csameness\u201d in anatomical relationships\u2014the\nwarrant for speaking, for example, of a \u201cfemur\u201d in a bird\nand a mammal as the \u201csame\u201d bone in different forms and\nfunctions. Furthermore, as Owen developed this theory in relation to\nhis work on the fossil record, the theory of the archetype, conceived\nalso as an immanent law working in history, led Owen to embrace a\nconcept of branching and diversifying relations of forms in history as\ndivergences from this ideal archetypal form over time\n (fig. 3\n above). Owen thus broke with the linear historical progressionism\nfrom simple to complex assumed in several transformist theories. \n\nOn the other hand, Owen\u2019s model cannot be considered to\nrepresent genuine species transformism\u2014species do not change\nhistorically one into another and the archetype exists as a\nquasi-Newtonian ideal \u201claw\u201d governing development in time\nrather than designating an actual historical form that materially has\ngiven rise to successive forms displaying homologous relationships.\nNonetheless, his integration of comparative anatomy, paleontology, and\neven embryology into this framework, set out a sophisticated model of\nrelationship that was later reinterpreted by Darwin from the viewpoint\nof his theory of material derivation from common historical\nancestors.\n4.3.3 Popular Transformism in Britain, 1844\u20131859\n\nOn a more popular level, species transformism was broadly popularized\nin pre-Darwinian Anglophone discussions by the appearance in 1844 of\nthe grand evolutionary cosmology put forth anonymously by the Scottish\npublisher Robert Chambers (1802\u201371) in his immensely popular\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation (Chambers\n1844[1994]), a work which in many respects prepared Victorian society\nin England, as well as pre-Civil War America, for Darwin\u2019s more\nrestricted theory of 1859 (Secord 2000; MacPherson, 2015). More\nsimilar to Buffon\u2019s Epochs of Nature than to the\nwritings of Lamarck, Chambers proposed an evolutionary schema that\nbegan with the nebular beginnings of the cosmos, the geological\nhistory of the earth interpreted as a progression of ages, accompanied\nby a historical progression of life from simple to complex, the cosmos\nmoved in a teleological direction up to humanity, with a broad\nevolution of species up the chain of being. In this grand schema he\nincorporated insights from French zoology and geological\nprogressionism, ignoring the refutations of this by Lyell, with all of\nthis working under the actions of one great unifying natural law that\ndemonstrated a great divine design of nature. This vision was further\npopularized by its incorporation into Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s\nepic poem In Memoriam (1850). In spite of the popularity of\nChamber\u2019s work, which went through eleven editions by the end of\nthe nineteenth century and sold more copies than Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin of Species, the British scientific community was\nessentially unanimous in its rejection of Chamber\u2019s\nspeculations, with Lyellian and Cuvierian critiques forming a solid\nscientific basis for these arguments. In many ways this opposition to\nthe Vestiges by leading members of the Victorian scientific\nestablishment formed one primary source of professional resistance to\nthe later Darwinian theory (see entry on Darwin: From the Origin\nof Species to the Descent of Man, Section 3).\n\nA more philosophically influential developmental evolutionism was also\nadvocated in pre-Darwinian England by the British railway engineer and\npublic intellectual, Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903)\n (Herbert Spencer).\n Inspired both by the expositions of Lamarckianism by Charles Lyell in\nthe second volume of his Principles of Geology\n(1830\u201333), by the writings of Karl Ernst von Baer on\nembryological development, and also by Richard Owen\u2019s Hunterian\nLectures on the osteology of the vertebrate skeleton, which Spencer\nattended in 1851 (Rupke 1994: 206), Spencer entered the British\ndiscussions of transformism in 1852 with his endorsement of the\n\u201cdevelopment hypothesis\u201d (Spencer 1852). This initiated\nhis broad reflections on the law-governed evolution of society and\nhumanity, developed in detail in such works as First\nPrinciples, published in 1862 (Haines 1988). Prior to the use of\nthe term by Darwin, Spencer spoke of the \u201cevolution\u201d of\nlife and the cosmos from material beginnings, with species changing as\na result of the operation of natural forces. It was also from Spencer\nthat Darwin borrowed the designator \u201csurvival of the\nfittest\u201d as a synonym for his own \u201cnatural\nselection\u201d in the fifth edition of the Origin of\nSpecies in 1869. Although Spencer\u2019s First\nPrinciples appeared after the publication of Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin, Spencer\u2019s transformism was developed generally\nindependently of Darwin\u2019s work and shows closest affinity with\nthe reflections of Lamarck, Chambers, and the historical\ndevelopmentalism of Owen.\n\nSpencer, rather than Darwin, has often been seen as the primary\ntheoretician of \u201csocial\u201d Darwinism in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries (Hofstadter 1944 [1955]; see also the\nentry on Herbert Spencer). Spencer\u2019s world-wide influence even\nmade his works a vehicle by which Darwinism was first introduced into\nnon-Western discussions (Jin 2019, 2020; Lightman (ed.) 2016; Elshakry\n2013; Pusey 1983). This unusual juxtapositioning of Spencer and Darwin\nis explored in the entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man\n (Section 3.1).\n5. Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe long historical scenario summarized in the present entry has\nsought to display the complexity of transformism in biology in the\nperiod as it developed independently of the advent of Darwinism. This\nhistory reveals several lines of non-Darwinian transformism that were\ncurrent and under discussion in the natural historical sciences which\nwere converging on larger explanatory theories of the history of life.\nIt also lends plausibility to the claim of historian Peter Bowler that\nwithout Darwin, life and earth science would still likely have come to\na \u201cscience that we could still recognize, although its\ncomponents would seem to have different implications, thanks to having\nbeen assembled in a more natural sequence of discovery\u201d (Bowler,\n2013, p. 279). It was against this complex background that Darwin\nwould develop his own theory on the origin and diversification of\nforms with emphasis on the principle of natural selection. He would,\nhowever, draw in many ways on these pre-existing discussions in\nFrench, British and even German sources, and reinterpret these issues\nagainst the framework of criticisms that had emerged against\ntransformism. Further exploration of this will be made in the entry\nDarwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of\nMan.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Appel, Toby A., 1987, <em>The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French\nBiology in the Decades Before Darwin</em>, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress.", "Aquinas, Thomas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, in S.
