Conserved Quantity Accounts of Causation\n\nConserved quantity accounts of causation are reductive accounts of\ncausation that are explicitly designed to locate causation within the\nrealm of physics avoiding the vagueness challenge. Most\nprominent here is the causal process account first proposed by Wesley\nSalmon (1984) and developed further in Phil Dowe\u2019s conserved\nquantity account (Dowe 2000; see also Kistler 1999 [2006]). Proponents\nof conserved quantity accounts take their accounts to contribute to\nthe metaphysical project of determining objective causal structures\nthat serve as truth-makers of causal claims.\n\nDowe distinguishes causal processes and causal interactions, which he\ndefines as follows:\n\nCQ1.\n A causal process is a world line of an object that possesses a\nconserved quantity.\nCQ2.\n A causal interaction is an intersection of world lines that\ninvolves exchange of a conserved quantity. (Dowe 2000: 90)\n\n\nConserved quantities are those quantities, such as energy, momentum,\nmass, or charge, that are conserved according to our physical\ntheories. By deriving its inspiration from physics, where conservation\nlaws play a central role, conserved quantity accounts promise to be\nable to meet the neo-Machian and neo-Russellian challenges. In fact,\nsince, according to Noether\u2019s First Theorem, there is a\nconservation law associated with each continuous symmetry property of\na system, there seems to be a clear formal route for locating causal\nclaims within physics.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how broadly applicable Dowe\u2019s account\nis. Classical electrodynamics satisfies energy-momentum conservation.\nYet while charged particles are associated with world lines, the\nelectromagnetic field, with which charged particles interacts, cannot\nbe associated with a world line along which energy is conserved. As\nMarc Lange (2002) has argued, it is problematic to think of the\nelectromagnetic field energy as a kind of \u201cstuff\u201d that\nflows in a uniquely identifiable manner among different field-regions.\nThus, Dowe\u2019s conserved quantity account appears to be designed\nfor an ontology of discrete objects and it is unclear how the account\nmight be extended to cover field theories as well.\n\nWhile conserved quantity accounts offer an analysis of the notion of\nbeing causally related, they do not, on their own, provide a\ndistinction between cause and effect. To introduce the direction of\nthe causal relation, Dowe supplements his conserved quantity account\nby appealing to Reichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry (1956).\nReichenbach distinguishes forks that are temporally open from forks\nthat are closed. If there is an event C occurring in past that\nscreens off A from B, but there is no screening-off\nevent in the future of A and B, then this constitutes an\nopen fork. If there is an event C in the past and in addition\nan event \\(C'\\) in the future of A and B that screen off\nA from B, we have a closed fork. Now,\nReichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry thesis consists in the claim that\nall open forks are open toward the future. Dowe (2000: 204) defines\nthe direction of causal processes by the direction of the majority of\nopen forks (thereby, in principle, allowing for the possibility of\nbackward causation). \n\nThus, in order to define the direction of causation, the conserved\nquantity accounts need to be supplemented by probabilistic\ninformation. It has also been argued that conserved quantity accounts\ncannot adequately distinguish those features of a process that are\nexplanatorily relevant from those that are not without relying on\ncounterfactuals (Woodward 2003b [2019]). Earman (2014) argues that the\nmost appropriate way to characterize causal processes is in terms of\nsystems governed by equations that allow for a well-posed initial\nvalue formulation, which are systems governed by hyperbolic equations\n(see also Woodward 2016).\n",
