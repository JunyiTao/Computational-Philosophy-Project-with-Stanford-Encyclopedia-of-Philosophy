    "main_text": "Problems for Meaning Holism || Instability\n3.2 Instability\n\nWorries about compositionality aside, most of the problems associated\nwith meaning holism are tied to the way in which it seems to make\nmeaning idiosyncratic and\n unstable.[15]\n If what one meant by a term were individuated in terms of, say,\nall of the beliefs or inferences that one was disposed to\nmake with it, then two people (or one person at two times) would only\nmean the same thing by any of their terms if all of\ntheir beliefs or inferential dispositions were identical. In\neffect, meaning holism threatens to erase the distinction between\nchange/differences of meaning and change/differences of belief, so\nthat every time I change any one my beliefs, I change the meanings of\nall of my terms, and any time two people fail to share a single\nbelief, the meaning of all their terms and the content of all of their\nbeliefs must\n differ.[16]\n3.2.1 Problems from Instability\n\nInstability presents problems for the meaning holist in the following\nareas:\n\nChange of Mind. I can\u2019t, strictly speaking,\nchange my mind about any particular proposition, since if I went from\nbelieving, say, \u201cDogs are good pets\u201d to believing\n\u201cDogs are not good pets\u201d, what I mean by\n\u201cDog\u201d and \u201cPet\u201d would have changed. As a\nresult, there is no proposition that I previously thought to be true\nthat I now treat as false. However, since the most natural way to make\nsense of changing one\u2019s mind about something is in terms of\nchanging the truth-value one assigns to a single proposition, the\nintuitive notion of change of mind seems lost. (Fodor and Lepore\n2002)\n\nDisagreement. In much the same way, it\u2019s\nnatural to think of disagreement in terms of two people assigning\ndifferent truth values to the same proposition, but if meaning holism\nis true, no two people could disagree over a single proposition, since\nif they didn\u2019t both accept a particular sentence, then they must\ndiffer in what they mean by it, in which case their differing\nattitudes don\u2019t constitute a disagreement. (Fodor and Lepore\n 2002)[17]\n\n\nCreative Inference. Creative inference also seems\nproblematic for the meaning holist. One could rehearse the inferential\nrelations between things one already believed, but one couldn\u2019t\nvalidly draw new conclusions, since if the conclusion of the inference\nis something that one didn\u2019t believe already, then the terms in\nthat conclusion will mean something different than what the seemingly\nidentical terms meant in the premises, making the inference\n invalid.[18]\n (The inference could, of course, later be recapitulated as a valid\none, since at that point the meaning of the terms in the premises\nwould have changed as well, but this is just to say that the\nrecapitulation doesn\u2019t capture the transitions that were\nactually going on when the inference was first taking place.)\n\nLanguage Learning. Learning a language would be\nproblematic, since it seems as if one couldn\u2019t learn any\npart of a given language until one had mastered all of\nit. (Dummett 1973: 597\u2013600, 1976: 44, 1991: 221, see also Bilgrami\n1986, Dresner 2002, J\u00f6nsson 2014) Of course, one could argue that on\nthis holistic view, there are no \u201clanguages\u201d to learn,\njust a series of changing idiolects, and at any point in one\u2019s\nacquisition period, one would have mastered some idiolect.\nHowever, this in turn leads to the following problem.\n\nCommunication. Strictly speaking, informative\ncommunication would be impossible. No one would mean the same thing by\nany of their terms unless they shared all the same beliefs, in which\ncase, communication would be possible, but uninformative, and truly\nunderstanding the utterances of others would be impossible unless you\nalready knew everything that they believed. (Fodor 1987; Fodor and\nLepore 1992).\n\nPsychological Explanation. No intentional laws or\npsychological generalizations would be possible, since no two subjects\nwould, as a matter of fact, have beliefs with the same content. We\nassume that generalizations like \u201cIf someone is thirsty, and\nthey believe that there is a glass of water in front of them, then\n(all else being equal), they will try to drink from it\u201d are well\nsupported, but this would require \u201cbelieving that there is a\nglass of water in front of them\u201d is an attitude that lots of\npeople have, and for the meaning holist, there are, strictly speaking,\nno such shared attitudes. (Fodor, 1987; Fodor and Lepore\n 1992)[19]\n\nThe Incredulous Stare. Finally, there is the plain\nfact that most people take it to be \u201cobvious\u201d that there\ncan be changes of belief without changes of meaning, and that when I\ncome to believe that there are four elephants in the Seattle Zoo, I\nhaven\u2019t changed what I mean by \u201cElephant\u201d. The\nincredulous stare is hardly a knockdown argument (especially in\nphilosophy), but it suggests that meaning holism comes with a\nsubstantial conceptual cost, and so requires equally substantial\nbenefits to compensate for it.\n3.2.2 Coping with Instability\n\nThere are a number of ways that the meaning holist can attempt to\nanswer the objection that the view erases the distinction between\ndifferences/change of meaning and differences/changes of belief. These\ninclude:\n\nBiting the bullet. One could simply say that, in\nfact, there isn\u2019t any real difference between\nchange of meaning and change of belief and that we never\nreally communicate, disagree, or change our mind, but\nit\u2019s hard to imagine someone simply biting that bullet and\nleaving it at that. Nevertheless, some have endorsed a modified\nversion of the above, arguing that, at least strictly\nspeaking, we never communicate, disagree or change our mind, and\nthen providing an explanation of why things might appear otherwise,\nand how loosely speaking we do manage to communicate,\ndisagree, change our minds, etc. Which leads us to\u2026\n\nSimilarity. Many holists have argued that while none\nof us ever mean precisely what our compatriots and former\nselves do by our terms, we can still explain communication, change of\nmind etc. in terms of the fact that the different things that we mean\nare still extremely similar, so while I don\u2019t mean\nprecisely what my wife means by \u201ccat\u201d, I still\nmean something extremely similar to what she does because we share\nmost of our beliefs and inferences where that term is\nconcerned. (For versions of something like this approach, see Harman\n1973; Block 1986; Churchland 1998; Fultner 1998; Brandom 2007;\nSchroeder 2007; Jorgensen 2009; Rovane 2013, Dresner 2019; Pollock\n2020). \n\nHowever, even if such an appeal to similarity worked for the case\nabove, there is the problem that for many terms, our total belief sets\nsimply aren\u2019t all that similar. After all, the similarity\nresponse presupposes that most of the beliefs and inferences\nassociated with a particular word are shared, but even in a generous\nsense of sharing, one might think that the total belief set that I\nassociate with my name for Omaha, a city which I\u2019ve never\nvisited, will not be even remotely similar to the belief set of\nsomeone who grew up there.\n\nFurthermore, while the appeal to similarity is very natural, it can be\nhard to spell out in detail since the intuitive sense in which, say,\nmy wife and I \u201cshare most of our beliefs and inferences\u201d\nseems to presuppose just the sort of content identity that meaning\nholism makes problematic. One would like to say that I mean something\nsimilar to my wife by \u201ccat\u201d because, in spite of our\ndifferences, we both believe things like \u201ccats make good\npets\u201d, \u201ccats are mammals\u201d, \u201ccats are typically\nsmaller than dogs\u201d, etc. However, to say that we\n\u201cshare\u201d these beliefs would be to assume that we mean the\nsame thing by \u201cpet\u201d, \u201cmammal\u201d and\n\u201cdog\u201d, which is something that the meaning holist is\ncommitted to denying. Strictly speaking, for the meaning holist, I\ndon\u2019t share any beliefs and inferences with my\ncompatriots and past selves, and so similarity can\u2019t be\nexplained in terms of shared beliefs and inferences (Fodor\n1998; Fodor and Lepore 1992, 1999). \n\nOf course there may be other ways to pin down similarity, and one of\nthese can be seen to flow out from the approach found immediately\nbelow.\n\nNarrow Content and Wide Content. Another way of\nmaking biting the bullet more palatable is by arguing that what we\nmean by any word involves two parts, a \u201cwide\u201d meaning that\nis understood in terms of something atomistic like reference, and a\n\u201cnarrow\u201d meaning that is closer to something holistic like\ninferential role (Block 1986, 1993, 1995; Field 1977).\n\nIf meaning holism is true only of the \u201cnarrow\u201d meaning\nused for psychological explanation (Block 1993), then communication,\ndisagreement, change of mind etc. can be explained in terms of the\n\u201cwide\u201d truth-conditional meaning. In spite of our\ndifferent narrow meanings, I can communicate with a compatriot because\nour sentences like, say, \u201cPork chops are generally better in\nMemphis than in Portland\u201d will have the same wide truth\nconditions in spite of their having different narrow meanings. In much\nthe same way, disagreement could be explained by the fact that a\nsingle sentence will have the same truth conditions for both me and my\ninterlocutor (even though we each tie it to different narrow\nmeanings), and so if I affirm it, and they deny it, then only one of\nus can be correct.\n\nThe \u201ctwo factor\u201d theory would also help support something\nlike the similarity response mentioned above in that narrow meanings\ncould be treated as similar if they embodied most of the\n\u201csame\u201d inferences where those inferences were themselves\ntyped in terms of having the same wide content. This would allow one\nto say that the narrow meanings of \u201ccat\u201d between my wife\nand I are very similar, since most of our \u201ccat\u201d-beliefs\nhave the same\n truth-conditions.[20]\n\nOf course, appeals to narrow content are not uncontroversial. The\nnotion seems more natural with belief content than linguistic meaning,\nand even for the former, there have been doubts raised about whether\nit really is a coherent notion of content at all (Bilgrami 1992;\nMcDowell 1986). Further, even if one accepts that there are these two\nsorts of content, we are left with the question of what holds the two\ntypes of meaning together. As Fodor and Lepore put it, why\ncouldn\u2019t something have the same \u201cnarrow\u201d meaning as\n\u201cwater\u201d and at the same time refer to the number four?\n(Fodor and Lepore 1992: 170). This worry is most pronounced for\ntheories that, unlike the more traditional Fregean account where the\nmode of presentation is expected to determine reference,\nfollow those who \u201ctend to suppose that a concept\u2019s\nidentification procedure has nothing to do with its reference\u201d\n(Margolis & Laurence 1999: 72). Such psychological factors making\nup the narrow content would thus be \u201cmerely associated\u201d\nwith a wide content rather than helping determine\n it.[21]\n\n\nContextualism. Yet another way of dealing with the\nsort of instability associated with meaning holism is to appeal to\ncontext, rather than similarity, to ensure that\ncommunication, change of mind and the rest are possible. For instance,\nBilgrami (1992) argues that critics of meaning holism fail to\ndistinguish aggregate contents (which are tied to all of the\nagent\u2019s beliefs) and local contents (which are only\ntied to those belief relevant in a particular communicative context).\nWhile meaning holism would have all the instability-related problems\nmentioned above at an aggregate level, at a local\nlevel (which is where communication and psychological explanation\nactually takes place), content identity can be\n preserved.[22]\n On such an account, only some of the beliefs/inferences\nassociated with a particular word will be active in any particular\ncontext, and so two people who might (indeed, will inevitably) mean\nsomething different at an aggregate level (at which we\nconsider all their beliefs) may still mean the same thing in\nany particular context, since the beliefs that they take to be\nrelevant in that context could be identical. In effect, one has\nsomething that looks like a type of molecularist view in each context,\nbut unlike the standard molecularist, who treats the\nmeaning-constitutive beliefs/inference as invariant across contexts,\nthe contextualist allows the relevant subset to change from situation\nto situation.\n\nFor instance, while the total set of beliefs associated with\n\u201csugar\u201d varies greatly from person to person, if someone\nasks me whether I would like some sugar with my coffee, most of our\nidiosyncratic sugar-beliefs would be irrelevant, and in that context,\nonly the beliefs that sugar is sweet, has a certain color, texture and\ntaste will be active. Since those beliefs are probably shared, I am\nable to communicate with that person about sugar in that context even\nif we mean something different by the term at the\n\u201caggregate\u201d level.\n\nHowever, this presupposes a lot about the contexts involved, and the\nassumption that even within a particular context, two people would\ntake the same beliefs/inferences to be relevant is not\nuncontroversial. Indeed, if I\u2019m communicating novel information\nthat my interlocutor doesn\u2019t know, this might always entail that\nI start off meaning something different than they do (though they may\ncome to share a meaning by accepting the claim). This worry would be\neven more pronounced when we try to move from communication to\ndisagreement, where, by hypothesis, there is a contextually relevant\nsentence involving the words in question that my interlocutor and I\ndon\u2019t both accept. This problem could be avoided by insisting\nthat the focus of a conversation not be included in the context, and\nthat the local content simply be stipulated to only include what the\ntwo parties agree on (Bilgrami 1992: 146). However, such a restriction\nwould seem to make the resulting contents less suitable for\npsychological explanation, since the behavior of the speakers involved\nin a disagreement would likely be sensitive to their opinions on the\nissue about which they\n disagree.[23]\n\n\nStill, the appeal to context might be viewed as a supplement to,\nrather than alternative to, the similarity response. If the beliefs\nwere restricted to those relevant in a particular context, then even\nif they aren\u2019t identical, it\u2019s quite likely that the\nbelief sets will be similar even when, as in the case of\n\u201cOmaha\u201d above, the two speakers have very different total\nbeliefs sets associated with the word. Context would thus make appeals\nto ubiquitous similarity more plausible, and similarity could be used\nas a back up for those contexts which fail to produce context-relative\nidentity.\n\nAnti-Individualism. As stated above, instability\narises not from meaning holism per se, but from versions of\nmeaning holism motivated by an identification of meaning with some\naspect of use, and some of the problems relating to instability can be\nmitigated if the meaning holist loosens the connection between meaning\nand individual use. One natural way to do this is to take it\nto be the beliefs and inferences endorsed by a group rather\nthan an individual that determine a word\u2019s meaning\n(Brandom 1994, 2000). On such an account, two different individuals\n(or one individual at two times) could mean the same thing by a word\neven if they endorse different inferences provided that both were\nmembers of a single social group that collectively endorses a single\nset of inferences or beliefs. Disagreement, communication, inference,\nand change of mind would all thus seem initially less puzzling for the\nmeaning holist if they happens to be an anti-individualist as\nwell.\n\nThis sort of anti-individualism might seem independently motivated by\nthe considerations raised in Tyler Burge\u2019s \u201cIndividualism\nand the\n Mental\u201d,[24]\n and it shares with Burge\u2019s account the challenges of (1)\ndetermining just what beliefs or inferences are endorsed by a group or\nsociety (those of the majority, the experts, etc.) and (2)\nindividuating the relevant groups themselves.\n\nFurthermore, given that what is believed about anything even at a\nsocial level undoubtedly changes over time, and given the spreading\neffect endemic to meaning holism that leads a change in one element to\nultimately produce changes in the rest, one might expect that most of\nour terms will end up changing their meaning each day even for the\nanti-individualist meaning holist. For instance, if we allow that,\nsay, the experts determine what inferences or beliefs are tied to the\nmeaning of any particular term, then any changes to their\nterm-specific belief set will not only change the meaning of that\nterm, but also cascade down through the language to ultimately affect\nevery word just as it did in the individual case. Since some change in\nexpert belief about something happens every day, one might\nthink that we are still left in a state of comparative flux.\nConsequently, while the appeal to the social-determination of meaning\nallows for synchronic communication, disagreement, etc., the\ndiachronic sense of all of these are still undermined\n(unless, of course, this appeal to anti-individualism is combined with\nsome of the appeals to similarity, wide contents, or context discussed\n above).[25]\n\nFinally, this sort of answer to instability worries would not be\navailable to many meaning holists, who, like Block (1986, 1995), seem\ndriven to meaning holism by an interest in supplying a semantics for\nan explicitly individualistic psychology. \n\nNormativity. The anti-individualistic response\npresented above, like most holistic accounts of meaning, focuses on\nthe inferences that speakers (or social groups) do make,\nrather than the ones that they should make. However, just as\nextensional accounts of meaning tie the meaning of a term to what we\nshould apply it to, not what we simply do apply it\nto, one might think that the holist could take a similar normative\napproach from the inferential side. If one takes this more normative\napproach to the inferences involved, many of the instability-based\nworries disappear. The inferences I do make with the term,\nsay, \u201cgold\u201d change over time and differ from those that my\ncompatriots make, but the inferences I should make with the\nterm are considerably more stable and shared. I may change what\ninferences I do make about gold\u2019s atomic number, but the ones\nthat I should make with respect to it are stable (Brandom 1994, 2000:\n29).\n\nThere will, nevertheless, still be some instability even with this\nnormative account if we merely identify the inferences we should make\nwith all of the ones that are truth\n preserving.[26]\n For instance on such an account, while I should infer\n\u201cis worth less per ounce than platinum\u201d from \u201cis\ngold\u201d, if the price of gold were to go up enough, the validity\nof that inference would change. However, intuitively the meaning of\n\u201cgold\u201d should not be changing in a case like this. A\nsignificant change in gold\u2019s price shouldn\u2019t cause me to\nbe unable to understand gold-utterances of people before the price\nwent up, or view the meaning of \u201cSusan loves gold\u201d as\nopaque if I don\u2019t know whether it was uttered before or after\nthe price\n spike.[27]\n That said, if the holist is making an appeal to similarity and\nwide-contents as well, then an isolated sentence like that would not\nbe much of a problem, since the vast majority of the inferences we\nshould make with the term would still be both constant and shared.\n\nOf course, like the anti-individualist response discussed above, the\nnormative response won\u2019t be available to those meaning holists\nwho, like Block, motivate their holism in terms of a type of\nindividualistic functionalist psychology.\n3.3 \u201cAnalyticity\u201d and Objectivity\n\nA final group of objections to meaning holism stem from the assumption\nthat theories that tie what we mean by a term to some of the beliefs\nor inferences associated with it can seem to make the all of the\nmeaning-constitutive beliefs or inferences \u201ctrue in virtue of\nmeaning\u201d, and thus in a sense \u201canalytically\n true\u201d.[28]\n The meaning molecularist\u2019s claim that their proposed\nmeaning-constitutive inferences need to be valid (say, if the meaning\nof \u201c&\u201d were identified with its elimination and\nintroduction rules, then one would need to treat \u201c\\((A \\ \\&\\\nB) \\rightarrow A\\)\u201d as true in virtue of meaning) isn\u2019t\nentirely uncontroversial, but the assumption that meaning-constitutive\ninferences will be valid isn\u2019t taken to be problematic even by\nthe critics of meaning molecularism (who argue instead that particular\ncandidates for meaning constitutive inferences can\u2019t be\naccepted, since we can coherently doubt their validity (Burge 1986;\nWilliamson 2003)). However, while the meaning molecularist can at\nleast allow that we can make many mistakes, since most of our beliefs\nare not meaning constitutive, the meaning holist may seem to be\ncommitted to all of our beliefs being true, since all of them\ndetermine what we\n mean.[29]\n The issue isn\u2019t so much that all such beliefs are true\n\u201cin virtue of meaning\u201d, but rather that they are all\ntreated by the meaning holist as simply true at all. Whether\nthe truth involved is analytic or not, it doesn\u2019t seem like we\nshould have to treat all of any speaker\u2019s beliefs as\ntrue. There are a number of responses to this worry, all of which\nappeal to strategies already canvassed in describing the meaning\nholist\u2019s response to worries about instability.\n\nFor instance, one way to cut worries about objectivity short is to\nappeal to the narrow/wide content distinction discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n and claim that the meanings for which meaning holism holds are not\nthe sort that relate to truth.  Block, in particular, has\ninsisted that, since the contents for which meaning holism holds\ninvolve narrow meanings, the question of their truth\ndoesn\u2019t come up. The \u201cnarrow analog\u201d of analyticity\ndoesn\u2019t produce analyticity in the traditional sense, and thus\nBlock can reject what he calls \u201cThe Plausible Sounding\nPrinciple\u201d, namely:\n\n\nInferences that are part of inferential roles must be regarded by the\ninferential role theorist as analytic. For these inferences are what\nare taken to constitute meaning, and inferences that constitute\nmeaning are analytic. (Block 1993: 51)\n\n\nSince \u201cdeterminate meaning facts about narrow meaning\ndo not engender analyticities\u201d (Block 1993: 54), the analyticity\nworry won\u2019t plague this sort of holist. Since narrow contents\nhave no truth values, \u201cand hence have no truth\nconditions\u201d, they simply aren\u2019t the type of thing that\ncould be true in virtue of meaning, and thus \u201caren\u2019t even\nthe sort of things that can be analytic\u201d (Block 1993:\n61).\n\nAnother way for the meaning holist to mitigate worries about\nobjectivity is to adopt a version of the \u201ccontextualist\u201d\napproach also mentioned in\n 3.2.2.\n On that view, since only some of one\u2019s beliefs are relevant to\na term\u2019s meaning in any context, one\u2019s other beliefs can\nturn out to be false when evaluated from that context. However, while\nthis would allow for some false beliefs, one might worry whether it\ngoes far enough. Beliefs that speakers in a context didn\u2019t agree\non could turn out to be false, but other inferences, inferences that\nintuitively seem fallible, turn out to be effectively analytic within\nthe relevant contexts. For instance if both my interlocutor and I\nbelieve \u201cAll sugar comes from sugarcane\u201d in a context\nwhere that belief is relevant (we are, for instance, asked \u201cName\na product that comes exclusively from a single type of plant\u201d)\nit would seem as if my answer \u201csugar\u201d would have to be\ncorrect on the contextualist version of meaning holism, which it\ndoesn\u2019t seem to\n be.[30]\n\n\nThe \u201canti-individualistic\u201d and \u201cnormative\u201d\nresponses to instability discussed in\n 3.2.2\n can also both do service in defending the meaning holist from worries\nabout objectivity. The anti-individualist strategy would do a good job\naccounting for individual error, since individual inferences\ncan be understood as mistaken in virtue of being out of line with the\npreferred social usage. Nevertheless, understanding how the preferred\nsocial usage (be it expert usage, majority usage, or something else)\ncould be mistaken would still be a problem on such an account. The\nnormative strategy, on the other hand, build\u2019s a notion of\nobjectivity directly into the use appealed to, and so seems best\nplaced to respect the purported objectivity of our claims (the fact\nthat the inferences that we should make couldn\u2019t turn\nout to be mistaken on such an account doesn\u2019t seem particularly\ntroubling). However, as discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n both of the anti-individualistic and normative responses detach\nmeaning from individual use in a way that many meaning holists would\nfind unacceptable.\n4. Conclusion\n\nMeaning holism thus comes with a number of costs (particularly\nrelating to instability and objectivity), and while there are a\nvariety of strategies available to make these costs more bearable, no\nsingle approach to doing so seems problem-free. That said, these\nstrategies can be complementary, and it may be the case that a\ncombination of them can do the work in a way that no single one of\nthem would be able to. In any case, being completely problem free is a\nvery high bar to set for a philosophical theory, and meaning holists\nare free to argue not only that the benefits that come with their view\noutweigh the costs, but also that the atomistic and molecularist\ntheories face equally severe problems of their own.",
