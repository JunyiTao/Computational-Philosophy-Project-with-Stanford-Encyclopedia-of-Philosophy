    "main_text": "Analytic Philosophy of Technology || The Relationship Between Technology and Science\n2.2 The Relationship Between Technology and Science\n\nThe close relationship between the practices of engineering and\nscience may easily keep the important differences between the\ntechnology and science from view. The predominant position of science\nin the philosophical field of vision made it difficult for\nphilosophers to recognize that technology merits special attention for\ninvolving issues that do not emerge in science. This view resulting\nfrom this lack of recognition is often presented, perhaps somewhat\ndramatically, as coming down to a claim that technology is\n\u2018merely\u2019 applied science.\n\nA questioning of the relation between science and technology was the\ncentral issue in one of the earliest discussions among analytic\nphilosophers of technology. In 1966, in a special issue of the journal\nTechnology and Culture, Henryk Skolimowski argued that\ntechnology is something quite different from science (Skolimowski\n1966). As he phrased it, science concerns itself with what is, whereas\ntechnology concerns itself with what is to be. A few years later, in\nhis well-known book The Sciences of the Artificial (1969),\nHerbert Simon emphasized this important distinction in almost the same\nwords, stating that the scientist is concerned with how things are but\nthe engineer with how things ought to be. Although it is difficult to\nimagine that earlier philosophers were blind to this difference in\norientation, their inclination, in particular in the tradition of\nlogical empiricism, to view knowledge as a system of statements may\nhave led to a conviction that in technology no knowledge claims play a\nrole that cannot also be found in science. The study of technology,\ntherefore, was not expected to pose new challenges nor hold surprises\nregarding the interests of analytic philosophy.\n\nIn contrast, Mario Bunge (1966) defended the view that technology\nis applied science, but in a subtle way that does justice to\nthe differences between science and technology. Bunge acknowledges\nthat technology is about action, but an action heavily underpinned by\ntheory\u2014that is what distinguishes technology from the arts and\ncrafts and puts it on a par with science. According to Bunge, theories\nin technology come in two types: substantive theories, which provide\nknowledge about the object of action, and operative theories, which\nare concerned with action itself. The substantive theories of\ntechnology are indeed largely applications of scientific theories. The\noperative theories, in contrast, are not preceded by scientific\ntheories but are born in applied research itself. Still, as Bunge\nclaims, operative theories show a dependence on science in that in\nsuch theories the method of science is employed. This\nincludes such features as modeling and idealization, the use of\ntheoretical concepts and abstractions, and the modification of\ntheories by the absorption of empirical data through prediction and\nretrodiction.\n\nIn response to this discussion, Ian Jarvie (1966) proposed as\nimportant questions for a philosophy of technology what the\nepistemological status of technological statements is and how\ntechnological statements are to be demarcated from scientific\nstatements. This suggests a thorough investigation of the various\nforms of knowledge occurring in either practice, in particular, since\nscientific knowledge has already been so extensively studied, of the\nforms of knowledge that are characteristic of technology and are\nlacking, or of much less prominence, in science. A distinction between\n\u2018knowing that\u2019\u2014traditional propositional\nknowledge\u2014and \u2018knowing how\u2019\u2014non-articulated\nand even impossible-to-articulate knowledge\u2014had been introduced\nby Gilbert Ryle (1949) in a different context. The notion of\n\u2018knowing how\u2019 was taken up by Michael Polanyi under the\nname of tacit knowledge and made a central characteristic of\ntechnology (Polanyi 1958); the current state of the philosophical\ndiscussion is presented in this encyclopedia\u2019s entry on\n knowledge how.\n However, emphasizing too much the role of unarticulated knowledge, of\n\u2018rules of thumb\u2019 as they are often called, easily\nunderplays the importance of rational methods in technology. An\nemphasis on tacit knowledge may also be ill-fit for distinguishing the\npractices of science and engineering because the role of tacit\nknowledge in science may well be more important than current\nphilosophy of science acknowledges, for example in concluding causal\nrelationships on the basis of empirical evidence. This was also an\nimportant theme in the writings of Thomas Kuhn on theory change in\nscience (Kuhn 1962).\n",
