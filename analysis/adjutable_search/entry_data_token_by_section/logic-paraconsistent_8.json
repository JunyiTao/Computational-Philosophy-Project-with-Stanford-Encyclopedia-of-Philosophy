    "main_text": "Motivations || Arithmetic and G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem\n2.4 Arithmetic and G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem\n\nUnlike formal semantics and set theory, there may not be any obvious\narithmetical principles that give rise to contradiction. Nonetheless,\njust like the classical non-standard models of arithmetic, there is a\nclass of inconsistent models of arithmetic (or more\naccurately models of inconsistent arithmetic) which have an\ninteresting and important mathematical structure.\n\nOne interesting implication of the existence of inconsistent models of\narithmetic is that some of them are finite (unlike the classical\nnon-standard models). This means that there are some significant\napplications in the metamathematical theorems. For example, the\nclassical L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem states that \\(Q\\)\n(Robinson\u2019s arithmetic which is a fragment of Peano arithmetic)\nhas models of every infinite cardinality but has no finite models.\nBut, \\(Q\\) can be shown to have models of finite size too by referring\nto the inconsistent models of arithmetic.\n\nIt is not only the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem but also other\nmetamathematical theorems can be given a paraconsistent treatment. In\nthe case of other theorems, however, the negative results that are\noften shown by the limitative theorems of metamathematics may no\nlonger hold. One important such theorem is G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem.\n\nOne version of G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem states\nthat for any consistent axiomatic theory of arithmetic, which can be\nrecognised to be sound, there will be an arithmetic truth\u2014viz.,\nits G\u00f6del sentence\u2014not provable in it, but which can be\nestablished as true by intuitively correct reasoning. The heart of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is, in fact, a paradox that concerns the\nsentence, \\(G\\), \u2018This sentence is not provable\u2019. If \\(G\\)\nis provable, then it is true and so not provable. Thus \\(G\\) is\nproved. Hence \\(G\\) is true and so unprovable. If an underlying\nparaconsistent logic is used to formalise the arithmetic, and the\ntheory therefore allowed to be inconsistent, the G\u00f6del sentence\nmay well be provable in the theory (essentially by the above\nreasoning). So a paraconsistent approach to arithmetic overcomes the\nlimitations of arithmetic that are supposed (by many) to follow from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem. For other \u2018limitative\u2019\ntheorems of metamathematics, see Priest 2002. For some of the original work by Meyer applying paraconsistent logic to arithmetic, and new commentaries and developments, see the collection Ferguson and Priest 2021.\n",
