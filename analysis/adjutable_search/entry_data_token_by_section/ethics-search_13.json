    "main_text": "Moral Accountability and Social-Responsibility Issues for Search Engine Companies || Some Questions Affecting Trust\n4.3 Some Questions Affecting Trust\n\n\nIn the preceding section, we saw how the rapid spread of Fake News\nonline raises one kind of trust-related concern for SECs: the accuracy\nof the information on some sites to which search engine users are\ndirected. We next briefly examine the concept of trust in more general\nterms, before considering whether and how it might be possible for\nusers to enter into trust relationships with SECs. As in the case of\nother key ethical issues affecting SECs, it is not possible to discuss\nhere the many aspects of trust in the detail that they would otherwise\nwarrant. For an excellent overview of trust (in general), see McLeod\n(2015). We limit our analysis to some current trust-related issues\ninvolving SECs, and suggest that the way SECs respond to these issues\ncould affect the sense of trust that users will have in the future for\nmajor SECs such as Google and Bing.\n\n\nWhat is trust, and why is it so important in the context of SECs?\nFollowing Baier (1986), many philosophers view trust as an\n\u201cattitude,\u201d while others see trust either in\n\u201crelational terms\u201d (Robbins 2016) or as a kind of\n\u201cexpectation\u201d (Walker 2006). And as Govier (1997, 35)\nnotes, one reason why trust is important is because \u201cattitudes of\ntrust and distrust affect the nature and quality of our social\nreality.\u201d When discussing the topic of trust, it is important to\nmake some key distinctions at the outset. For example, we need to\ndifferentiate trust from trustworthiness, which is often viewed either\nas a property of the trustee (rather than as an attitude of\nthe trustor) or a relation between trustor and trustee.\nAdditionally, it is important to distinguish between ethical\ntrust and epistemic trust (both of which are described below),\nin the context of SECs.\n\n\nAre contemporary SECs trustworthy organizations? If so, why is it\nthat we claim to trust them? Is it because (a) we perceive them as a\nreliable resource for directing us to the most relevant and\naccurate online information, in response to our search queries (i.e.,\nepistemic trust)? Or is it because (b) SEC\u2019s policies regarding\nwhat they do with our personal information, once collected, are\nperceived as transparent and fair (ethical trust)? Or is it\nbecause of both (a) and (b)? We can also ask whether there might be\nsome alternative/additional reasons why one could claim to trust or\ndistrust an SEC.\n\n\nOf course, one could reasonably question whether it is possible for\nhumans to enter into a trust relationship with an SEC, as a corporate\nentity, or even with a non-human entity of any kind. For example, some might assume\nthat a genuine trust relationship can only exist between humans\n(or perhaps more specifically, between \u201chuman agents\u201d). Others,\nhowever, believe that trust relationships can be extended to include\nsome non-human, or \u201cartificial,\u201d agents\u2014i.e., not\nonly corporations, which are sometimes viewed as aggregates of human\nagents, but also artificial electronic agents such as\n\u201cbots.\u201d Because issues affecting trust and responsibility\nfor SECs are distributed over a vast and diffuse network, many diverse\nkinds of agents can be involved\u2014e.g., from corporate CEOs and\nexecutives/boards, to customer-service representatives, to engineers\nand software developers, to the many (non-human) artificial (AI) agents\nor bots that can also \u201cmake some limited decisions\u201d on\nbehalf of an SEC. So what, exactly, is it that we trust/distrust when\nwe say we trust/distrust an SEC? In claiming to trust Google, for\nexample, we may, in effect, be saying that we trust all of the\ncomponent elements comprising that SEC.\n\n\nOne model that can help us to think about trust in contexts as vast\nand complex as major SECs is Margaret Urban Walker\u2019s framework of\n\u201cdiffuse default trust\u201d (Walker 2006). In Walker\u2019s\nscheme, trust relationships occur in environments (i.e., \u201cspaces\nand circumstances\u201d) that she calls \u201czones of default\ntrust.\u201d Walker differentiates trust from mere reliance by noting\nthat in a trust relationship between A and B, A not only expects B to\ndo X, but A expects it of B (Walker, 79). And because trust\n\u201clinks reliance to responsibility,\u201d Walker (p. 80) believes\nthat A has a \u201cnormative expectation\u201d of B. But she also\nnotes that we are not always conscious of these normative expectations,\nbecause they are typically \u201cunreflective and often\nnonspecific\u201d expectations where \u201cstrangers or unknown\nothers may be relied upon to behave in acceptable ways.\u201d Our\nreliance on the \u201cgood and tolerable behavior of others\u201d is\nat the core of Walker\u2019s notion of \u201cdefault trust\u201d (p.\n85).\n\n\nAn important feature of Walker\u2019s framework is that it allows\nfor trust relations between individuals who have not met, and who will\npossibly never meet, in person. And in her scheme, trust relationships\ncan occur not only between humans who are unknown to one another, but\nalso between humans and non-human entities such as corporations. Walker\nillustrates the latter point in an example where someone encounters\nparticularly bad service on an airplane operated by a major commercial\nairline. She points out that when we have such an experience of bad\nservice, it is appropriate to feel resentment, not necessarily toward\nspecific individuals who work for the airline, but toward the airline\nitself. So the entities comprising a zone of trust need not be limited\nto known (human) individuals.\n\n\nWalker (p. 85) extends her notion of default trust to include zones\nof \u201cdiffuse default trust,\u201d as also illustrated in her\nexample involving the major airline corporation. Consider the many ways\nthat responsibility can become \u201cdiffuse\u201d when distributed\nover a vast zone of trust such as a commercial airline (Walker), or a\nmajor SEC like Google which also qualifies as a zone of diffuse-default\ntrust comprising a diverse range of agents (both human and non-human).\nAmong the non-human entities in that zone are artificial electronic\nagents (bots) who \u201coperate behind the scenes,\u201d both with\nhumans and other artificial agents. The latter kinds of entities also\ninclude multi-agent systems that can \u201cact\u201d in limited ways\non behalf of an SEC. For a detailed description of how Walker\u2019s\nmodel can be applied in digital contexts, including zones of diffuse\ndefault trust comprising both humans and multi-agent systems, see the\nanalysis in Buechner and Tavani (2011).\n\n\nAs noted above, it is important to distinguish between epistemic\ntrust and ethical trust, both of which are essential for trusting SECs.\nWhereas concerns regarding the former sense of trust overlap with\nissues affecting an SEC\u2019s reliability, as well as with the\naccuracy of information contained on the Web sites it indexes and links\nto, ethical trust in the case of SECs can overlap with\nquestions/concerns pertaining to a search organization\u2019s user\npolicies and whether those policies are open, fair, and trustworthy.\nRecognizing and complying with the requirements of both aspects of\ntrust is crucial for an SEC like Google to realize a key objective\nstated in its code of conduct\u2014viz., to \u201cincrease\u201d and\n\u201ccontinually earn\u2026trust\u201d with its users (The Google\nCode of Conduct, 2018).\n\n\nWe conclude this section by acknowledging that much more could be\nsaid about the important role that trust plays in the context of SECs.\nBut we have at least identified some of the reasons why trust is very\nimportant for SECs and also showed how those companies can qualify as\n\u201czones of diffuse default trust\u201d (Walker). Although we have\nexamined only one model of trust \u2013 Walker\u2019s framework\n\u2013 in analyzing some of the many dimensions of trust affecting\nSECs, we have not argued that Walker\u2019s is the only, or even the\nbest, theory for understanding trust issues affecting SECs. Nor have we\nargued that Walker\u2019s theory is without internal problems.\nInstead, we put aside those kinds of questions in favor of using a\nspecific model to analyze trust-related questions affecting SECs in a\nsystematic way.\n\n\nWe began Section 4 by asking whether SECs have any special moral\nobligations because of their \u201cprivileged place\u201d in society\n(i.e., in light of their role as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of knowledge\non the Web), and in Section 4.1 we examined Hinman\u2019s concern about \nthe kind of control of knowledge that SECs currently have. In Section 4.2, we\nidentified a relatively recent trust-related challenge that SECs now\nface because of the proliferation of Fake News on the Web. And based on\nour further analysis of trust in Section 4.3, it would seem that an\nSEC\u2019s ability to establish and maintain trust with its users\nwill be crucial for that organization to thrive in the future.\n",
