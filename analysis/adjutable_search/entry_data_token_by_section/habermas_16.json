    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || Discourse Ethics and Critical Social Theory\n3.7 Discourse Ethics and Critical Social Theory\n\nHabermas claimed in Theory of Communicative Action that\nAdorno and Horkheimer\u2019s critical theory failed to provide an\nadequate account \u201cof its own normative foundations\u201d (1981\n[1984a: 374]) and that his own project was, by contrast the\n\u201cbeginning of a social theory concerned to validate its own\ncritical standards\u201d (1981 [1984a: xxxix]).\n\nIn Legitimation Crisis Habermas had explored the idea that\ncritical social theory could find its point d\u2019appui in\n\u201csuppressed generalizable interests\u201d, namely the\nunrealized rational potentials of modern society (1973a [1975: 111]).\nAs we saw, and Habermas himself admits, he did not develop this\napproach in Theory of Communicative Action. He claimed that\ncritical theory must refrain from \u201ccritically evaluating\n\u2026 forms of life and cultures \u2026 as a whole\u201d and\nfocused instead on investigating the way in which communicative\npathologies arising from the colonization of the lifeworld hinder\n\u201clearning potentials\u201d (1981 [1984a: 383]). Critics such as\nSchn\u00e4delbach and Taylor countered that such an approach would\nonly explicate critical or rational potentials, but never\njustify normative criticisms of society (Schn\u00e4delbach\n1986 [1991]; Taylor 1986 [1991]). Recall that (U) is a moral principle\nthat is supposed to validate norms containing generalizable interests.\nSome of Habermas\u2019s supporters in the 1980s, for example, Honneth\nand Benhabib, argued that discourse ethics could serve as the account\nof the normative foundations that Habermas argued first generation\ncritical theory was missing (Honneth 1985 [1991: 286]; Benhabib 1986:\n279\u201381).\n\nThe trouble is that Habermas\u2019s social theory does not set out to\ncriticize society in virtue of its degree of conformity to principle\n(U) or to any substantive moral principle. Habermas continues to deny\nthat this is the proper approach of social theory. He explicitly\nrebukes Rawls for thinking that the theorist can criticize society by\nfirst designing \u201cthe basic norms of a well-ordered society on\nthe drafting table\u201d and then checking society against it (1990d\n[1994: 101]; 1996a essay 3: 122 [1998a: 97]). That approach arrogates\nthe task of criticism to the philosopher, instead of social agents and\ncitizens. Besides which, the problem, as Schn\u00e4delbach understands\nit, is that social criticism proper requires normative judgements,\nwhich must be supported by normative reasons, while discourse ethics\nlimits itself to the clarification of the moral point of view, and (U)\nis a procedural principle that leaves such judgements up to\nparticipants in discourse, and cannot furnish the requisite reasons\n(Finlayson 2013b).\n",
