    "main_text": "Causal Accounts of Perception\n3. Causal Accounts of Perception\n\nPerception was, throughout the Middle Ages, a contentious topic, and\nit was also a topic in which the answers to strictly causal\nquestions could influence philosophical positions in other areas (for\nexample, on whether certain knowledge of external entities was\nattainable). The \u201ctraditional\u201d view, dating back to Roger\nBacon in the mid-thirteenth century, was that physical objects were\nknown because they caused a succession of likenesses, or\nspecies, first in the medium between the object and the perceiver,\nthen in the senses, and finally in the intellect, of the perceiver (Tachau\n1988, pp. 3ff., Normore 2010, pp. 255f.).  This position was attacked by\nthinkers such as Henry of Ghent, Peter Olivi,  and Duns Scotus. Interestingly,\nmany of these criticisms tend towards a relational account of perception, in\nwhich \u2013 although species still play a role \u2013 the role that they play\nis to be a means by which we know things, and in which the species\nthemselves are not known directly but only by reflection. (Tachau 1988, p. 66}.\n(Panaccio 2010, pp. 242f., Normore 2010, pp. 255f.)\n\nOckham then radicalised these critiques by denying that there are any\nsuch species at all: perception and other phenomena which\nwere usually explained by species \u2013 the sun heating or\nilluminating physical objects, for example \u2013 were now explained by\naction at a distance (Tachau 1988, pp. 130ff., Stump 1999). There was\na similar debate about the causal mechanisms behind memory, where,\nagain, Ockham denied a species-based account; however, in the\ncase of memory, he replaced species not with action at a distance but\nwith habits (Wolter and Adams 1993).\n\nThere was a similar late medieval debate on intentionality,\nthat is, the relation\nbetween mental states and their objects. It is no surprise, given Ockham\u2019s\narguments about species, that he took an externalist line on these,\ntoo: he poses the question by asking whether, if an angel saw the contents of\nmy mind when I was thinking about some singular object, could the angel\n(supposing that it did not know about anything external to my mind) tell which\nobject I was thinking about? Ockham answered no: and this thought experiment\nseems to show that my mental state (i.e.\\ my thinking of this particular\nobject) is not determined by the contents of my mind alone (Panaccio 2010, pp.\n242f., William of Ockham 1981, pp. 378f.). This is clearly some sort\n\tof externalist position, but describing this position exactly has proved\nto be surprisingly difficult (Panaccio 2010, Normore 2010, Brower-Toland 2007).\nCorrespondingly although many medieval thinkers were sympathetic to arguments\nof this sort, the details of the positions they adopted were by no means\nuniform. For example, followers of Scotus, such as Francis of Meyronnes, held\npositions on intentionality which were intricate, were relational in some\nsense, but were not straightforwardly externalist (Cesalli 2010). Debate on \nthese issues continues into our era, and has invited comparison with, for\nexample, Sellars (1960): Sellars\u2019 position, although interesting, does\nnot seem (as he claims) to reproduce Aquinas\u2019 position on \nintentionality (King 2010). This only shows that there are a very large\nnumber of different accounts of intentionality, and that the\nmedievals, even though they were surprisingly inventive in discovering them,\ndid not manage to discover all of them. \n\n\nOckham denies species not on the basis of empirical evidence, or on\nthe basis of epistemological arguments, but purely and simply on the\nbasis of his razor: if we deny species, then we can give an\naccount of the phenomena which uses fewer entities, because\nspecies are entities. Although this position of Ockham\u2019s did\nnot have much influence on his contemporaries or followers \u2013 it is,\nafter all, extremely implausible \u2013 it is a good example of how causal\nreasoning is affected by tacit ontological assumptions: the fact that\nspecies were seen as entities and the fact that Ockham had a\nprogramme of reducing the number of entities, led to an account of\nperception which tried to do away with species. On the other\nhand, action at a distance was, despite its implausibility, entirely\nunaffected by Ockham\u2019s critique. And, similarly, Ockham\u2019s account was\nnot noticeably simpler than the accounts it criticised, which\nshows how far Ockham\u2019s own razor was from the principles of simplicity\nand the like, which are usually considered to be its modern\nequivalents.\n\nOne should note that, although Ockham was very innovative, and altered the\nlandscape of medieval thought quite decisively, there were very few, if any,\npeople who adopted his position without modification: he produced a large\nnumber of interesting arguments, but, on the basis of these arguments, he\nadopted positions which many of his contemporaries were not convinced by (Rode\n2016, Courtenay 2008). So, although his arguments forced a reexamination of\nmany philosophical and theological doctrines, the thinkers influenced by him\ntook up a broad spectrum of positions, depending on which of his doctrines they\nassented to and which of them they rejected. Walter Chatton, for example,\ndenied Ockham\u2019s position on intuitive cognition \u2013 namely, that when\nwe know singulars we do so by a separate intellectual faculty distinct from\nsense perception \u2013 in favour of a position that saw intuitive and sensory \ncognition as very much interrelated, and this, in turn, followed from a rejection\nof Ockham\u2019s position that the sensitive and intellectual souls were distinct \n(Schierbaum 2016).\n",
