    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical attention to animals can be found in a wide range of\ntexts throughout the history of philosophy, including discussions of\nanimal classification in Aristotle and Ibn B\u00e2jja, of animal\nrationality in Porphyry, Chrysippus, Aquinas and Kant, of mental\ncontinuity and the nature of the mental in Dharmak\u012brti, Telesio,\nConway, Descartes, Cavendish, and Voltaire, of animal\nself-consciousness in Ibn Sina, of understanding what others think and\nfeel in Zhuangzi, of animal emotion in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Bentham, and of human cultural uniqueness in Xunzi. In recent\nyears, there has been increased attention to animal minds in\nphilosophical discussions across many areas of metaphysics,\nepistemology, and value theory. Given that nonhuman animals share some\nbiological and psychological features with humans, and that we share\ncommunity, land, and other resources, consideration of nonhuman\nanimals has much to contribute to our philosophical activities.\n\nContemporary philosophy of animal minds often also engages with the\nsciences of animal cognition and behavior. The science of comparative\ncognition is a thriving area of research, complementing the\nphilosophical study in two ways. For one, philosophers of animal\ncognition can use claims resulting from animal cognition studies as\npremises in philosophical discussions. For example, Jacob Beck (2012)\nrelies on pigeons\u2019 abilities to compare quantities to argue for\nnonconceptual content; Sidney Carls-Diamante (forthcoming) appeals to\noctopus behavior and physiology to defend embodied cognition; Richard\nMoore (2016a) refers to ape gestural communication to rethink the\nrequirements for intentional communication; Andrew Barron and Colin\nKlein (2016) appeal to insect cognition research to defend new\ntheories of consciousness; Sarah Vincent, Rebecca Ring, and Kristin\nAndrews (2019) cite dolphins\u2019 social practices to argue for the\nexistence of norms that do not require metacognition.\n\nIn addition, philosophers of animal cognition can examine the\nepistemology and methods used to justify the claims that arise from\nthe science. Research into animal cognition has resulted in surprising\nclaims about animal capacities, such as sociality in garter snakes\n(Skinner & Miller 2020), tool-use in ants (Ma\u00e1k et al.\n2017), mirror self-recognition in fish (Kohda et al. 2019), empathy in\nrats (Bartal et al. 2011), social learning in fruit flies (Danchin et\nal. 2018), episodic memory in dogs (Fugazza et al. 2020), addition and\nsubtraction in bees (Howard et al. 2019). How should we evaluate such\nclaims?\n\nSome philosophers have argued that animal cognition research is held\nto a higher standard than human cognition research, and that\nscientists working with animals are sometimes asked to solve skeptical\nproblems (Halina 2015). Others have challenged scientific assumptions\nabout the relationship between brain size and intelligence, as well as\nbiases against invertebrates (Mikhalevich & Powell 2020).\n\nAnimal cognition research challenges philosophers to consider that\nmany capacities and behaviors often assumed to require language,\nsophisticated technological capacities, or legal systems may in fact\nbe had by other animals who lack these properties. In this way, animal\ncognition research often surprises us by showing that\nsophisticated-looking activity can be caused through rather simple\nmechanisms.\n",
