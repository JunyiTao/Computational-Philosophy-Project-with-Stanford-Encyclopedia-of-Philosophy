    "main_text": "Life and Writings || The Dialogue Periphyseon (On the Division of Nature)\u2014The Manuscripts\n1.4 The Dialogue Periphyseon (On the Division of Nature)\u2014The Manuscripts\n\nEriugena\u2019s major work, the Periphyseon, also titled in\nsome manuscripts, De divisione naturae (On the Division of\nNature), is a long dialogue between a \u201cteacher\u201d (Nutritor) and a \u201cstudent\u201d\n(Alumnus), was probably begun in the early 860s, just after he had\ncompleted the Pseudo-Dionysius translation, and finished around 867\n(the date Wulfad, to whom the work is dedicated, became bishop, making\nit unlikely that Eriugena would have referred to him as\nfrater, brother, after his consecration as bishop). The first\nprinted edition of this dialogue appeared in 1681 and subsequently an\nedition by Floss appeared in 1853 which is now contained in PL 122.\nInglis Patrick Sheldon-Williams (1908\u20131973) began a new edition\nof Periphyseon with the publication of his text and\ntranslation of Book One in 1968 in the Scriptores Latini\nHiberniae series of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies,\nfollowed soon after by his edition of Periphyseon Book Two in\n1970, and Book Three, published after Sheldon-Williams\u2019 death,\nin the same series in 1981, seen through the press by the late John J.\nO\u2019Meara. Sheldon-Williams had assembled materials for the\nedition of Books Four and Five and had completed a draft English\ntranslation of these books, which was published separately in one\nvolume edited by John J. O\u2019Meara. O\u2019Meara and\n\u00c9douard Jeauneau continued the edition of Sheldon-Williams,\nbringing out Book Four in the same series in 1995. However, due to some deficiencies in\nSheldon-Williams\u2019 manner of editing, and his mistaken conception\nof the manuscript tree, Jeauneau has undertaken an entirely new\ncritical edition of the Periphyseon for the Corpus\nChristianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis series. All five books of\nthe Periphyseon have appeared in this series.\nSheldon-Williams was of the opinion that Periphyseon Book One\nhad emerged from an earlier \u201cessay in dialectic\u201d, but\noffered no evidence for this interpretation, which takes an overly\nrestrictive view of the first book of the dialogue. The main weakness\nof Sheldon-Williams\u2019 editing strategy was that it had conflated\nvarious versions of the text drawn from several different manuscripts\ninto a single composite script, in a similar manner to the earlier\neditors, Thomas Gale in 1681 and H.-J. Floss in 1853. Gale and Floss\nhad published editions that combined into a single text both the text\nof the main body of the manuscript and the various marginal\nannotations in different hands. This composite version disguised the\ngradual evolution of the text and Jeauneau is of the opinion that this\nmixed type of edition is inadequate to the needs of scholarship. The\nnew Jeauneau edition is based on six manuscripts, including two\nmanuscripts, Paris Bibl. nat. lat. 12965 and Bamberg Phil. 2/2, not\nused by Sheldon-Williams since they contained only Books Four and\nFive. Jeauneau has suggested that the extant manuscripts of the\nPeriphyseon show four distinct levels of development, that\nis, four early \u201ceditions\u201d. One special difficulty in\nediting the Periphyseon is that the earliest manuscripts\npreserve only the first three books whereas the extant manuscripts for\nBooks Four and Five date from the twelfth century. Avranches and\nCambridge, both twelfth century manuscripts, are the sole witnesses\nfor the end of Book Four and the whole of Book Five in Stage Two\nversions, with Avranches noticeably less accurate than Cambridge in\nseveral places.\n",
