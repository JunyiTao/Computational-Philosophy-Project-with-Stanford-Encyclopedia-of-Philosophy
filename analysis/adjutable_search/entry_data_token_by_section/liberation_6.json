    "main_text": "Currents || The Problematicizing\n3.4 The Problematicizing\n\nThis current is associated with the work of Horacio Cerutti Guldberg,\nJos\u00e9 Severino Croatto, Manuel Ignacio Santos, and Gustavo\nOrtiz. Cerutti Guldberg has also argued that Salazar Body and Hugo\nAssmann ought to be considered as contributing to this current. For\nthis group of thinkers, the criteria of philosophy\u2019s efficacy or\nrelevance cannot be authenticity, or how it relates or departs from\nsome \u201cnull\u201d point of enunciation that either responds to\nor is an interpellation of some \u201cmacro\u201d subject. For this\ncurrent, the question is what could constitute a critical reflection,\nwithout fetishes or mystifications, on the demanding crises and\nchallenges of Latin American social reality. Unlike the ontologizing\nand the analectical currents, both the historicizing and the\nproblematicizing reject all ontological or metaphysical attempts to\nfix \u201cel pueblo\u201d or what is properly \u201cLo\nAmericano\u201d, (that is, what properly belong to the\n\u201cAmericas\u201d). Philosophy is caught in the river of history,\nit cannot jump out of, or pretend that a \u201crupture\u201d with\nthe past can be executed or proclaimed. For this group of thinkers,\nthe critical issues were twofold. First, how does philosophy respond\nto a specific set of historical challenges, without falling pray to\nthe ideological prejudices that condition that presentation of that\nvery historical? Second, what is the language that will allow that\nphilosophical reflection to remain ever vigilant?\n\nNotwithstanding these substantive and often time irreconcilable\ndifferences, the philosophy of liberation has been recognized as an\nextremely important and representative philosophical movement that\nsynthesized and responded to distinctly Latin American intellectual\ntraditions and historical challenges. In nearly half a century, other\nfigures have aligned themselves with the movement, even if they were\nnot part of the founding cohort.\n\nThis is the case with Franz Hinkelammert, who was born in Germany in\n1931, and was educated in the Free University in Berlin. In 1963, he\nemigrated to Latin America, first to Chile and then to Costa Rica,\nwhere along with Hugo Assmann, he funded the Departamento\nEcum\u00e9nico de Investigaciones (DEI). His original training was\nin economics, but over the last four decades he has produced a series\nof influential books dealing with the relationship between theology,\neconomics, and philosophy. His work takes up liberation theology, but\nfrom the perspective of political economy and aims to show that the\ntheology of liberation\u2019s critique of religious idolatry are\nmatched by Marxism\u2019s critique of the fetish of the commodity\nform and exploitation. Hinkelammert has also produced a series of\nmonographs aimed at the critique of neoliberalism. Still, what he has\ncontributed is what he calls the Cr\u00edtica de la raz\u00f3n\nut\u00f3pica (Critique of Utopian Reason) (1984), which is\noperative as much in Marxism as it is in liberalism. To counter\nunrealizable utopian projects, Hinkelammert introduced the principle\nof \u201cfactibilidad\u201d or feasibility, as criteria for\nthe evaluation of the ethicalness or morality of any transformative\nmoral-political project.\n\nAnother figure that has contributed to the further refinement of the\nphilosophy of philosophy, mostly through his students, is the Jesuit\ntheologian Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda, born in 1930 in Viscaya, Spain.\nHe was a student of Karl Rahner and Xavier Zubiri. He moved to El\nSalvador, to teach at the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), where he\nbecame rector in 1969, a position he led until 1989 when he was\nassassinated by paramilitary forces trained by the United States\nmilitary.\n\nEllacur\u00eda worked closely with the Spanish philosopher Zubiri,\nwhose work aimed to overcome the separation between epistemology and\nontology, knower and known, through the notion of what he called\n\u201csentient intelligence\u201d, or \u201cfeeling\nlogos\u201d. Ellacur\u00eda took up Zubiri\u2019s\nontological work and transformed it into a philosophy of history.\nReality is historical and thus it is dynamic. Dynamic historical\nreality is where subjects are formed, but they are also the ones that\nmake historical reality transformative because of their\npraxis, their practical engagement with the world. The\npraxis of human, however, is also always the expansion of the\nhorizon of action. Praxis gives rise to more possibilities\nfor engagement historical reality. The telos of\npraxis is thus greater liberty. His incomplete magnum\nopus Filosof\u00eda de la realidad hist\u00f3rica\n(1991) aimed to develop a philosophy of history that celebrated the\n\u201chistorical intelligence\u201d that is the sediment of praxical\nbeings taking charge of their historical reality that aims at greater\nliberty. It is to be noted that Ellacur\u00eda\u2019s philosophy of\nhistory and \u201cfeeling logos\u201d have been most\neffectively taken up in Dussel\u2019s most recent work on the ethics\nand politics of liberation, which is one reason that, as was noted\nabove, the \u201canalectical\u201d designator may no longer be a\nuseful denomination for a current that has been influenced so\nprofoundly by recent developments in Latin American philosophy (Dussel\n1998, 2007, 2009, 2017, 2018; Bautista 2014; Grant 2020; Mills\n2018).\n",
