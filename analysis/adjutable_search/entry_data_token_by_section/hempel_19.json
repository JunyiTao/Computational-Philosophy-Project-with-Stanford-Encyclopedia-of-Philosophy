    "main_text": "The Problem of Provisos\n7. The Problem of Provisos\n\nWhat may come as some surprise is that Hempel exposed yet another\nsignificant problem confronting the theory of scientific explanation.\nOne of the most remarkable features of his career is that he continued\nto publish original and innovative studies well into his eightieth\ndecade. Rather surprisingly, he authored a series of articles that\nmoved away from the influential conception of scientific theories as\nformal calculi combined with empirical\ninterpretations that had been characteristic of logical\nempiricism. In Hempel (1966a), at the time, the most widely adopted\nintroduction to the philosophy of science (which has been translated\ninto ten other languages), he advanced the novel explication of\nscientific theories as consisting of internal principles and\nbridge principles, where the lawlike hypotheses that\ndistinguish theories are linked to observation, measurement, and\nexperiment by principles expressed in various mixtures of ordinary and\nof technical language. Now antecedent understanding replaces explicit\ndefinability, which seems to have been, in part, a response to the\ndemise of the observational/theoretical distinction.\n\nEven more strikingly, Hempel (1988a,b) observed that the application\nof scientific theories presupposes the absence of factors that might\naffect the internal principles of the theory, which goes beyond the\ncontent of the theory itself. Deriving predictions and explanations\nfrom classical mechanics presupposes that bodies are being acted upon\nexclusively by gravitational forces, for example, where the presence\nof electromagnetic forces would invalidate those derivations. This is\nnot simply a matter of conducting tests \u201cunder suitable\nconditions\u201d, where the malleability of gold differs when struck\nby a hammer when at extremely cold temperatures (where the\ncombustibility of paper differs when the paper is wet, and so on),\nwhich are familiar examples of the various specific conditions that\nmust be identified in complete definitions of dispositional\npredicates. What Hempel noticed is that these properties may not only\nbe affected by conditions covered by the theory being applied but\ninvolve entirely different theories. He took this to mean that the\napplication of theories has to be accompanied by\n\u201cprovisos\u201d affirming that no properties beyond those\nspecified by the theory are present in a specific case.\n\nThe function of these provisos means that instrumentalist\nconstructions of scientific theories as mere calculating devices and\nprograms for the elimination of theoretical language by reduction to\nobservational language alone are misguided and cannot be sustained.\nAnd this is because, if other theoretical properties make a difference\nto the application of a particular theory, then the observational\nconsequences of that theory cannot be assumed to obtain in any\ninstance without provisos about other theoretical properties beyond\nthose specified by the theory, which requires separate investigation\non the basis of observation, measurement, and experiment. The\nconditions for testing, confirming or falsifying alternative\nhypotheses and theories is thereby rendered vastly more complex than\nhad previously been supposed. Strikingly, as an essential element of\nan adequate explanation, Coffa (1973) had advanced \u201cextremal\nclauses\u201d that assert that no factors other than those specified\nby the initial conditions of the explanans are relevant to the\noccurrence of the explanandum event. Indeed, Salmon points out that,\nsince the application of every law involves a tacit extremal (or\n\u201cceteris paribus\u201d) clause, any law can be protected from\nrefutation by discounting disconfirming evidence on the expedient of\nclaiming that, because the clause was not satisfied, the law is still\ncorrect, which is another way to accent the source of Hempel\u2019s\nconcern (Salmon 1989: 84\u201385).\n\nThese observations are related to the claim that \u201cthe laws of\nphysics lie\u201d, which has been suggested by Nancy Cartwright\n(1983). She has claimed that there are theoretical laws, which are\nsupposed to be \u201csimple\u201d but rarely if ever instantiated,\nand phenomenological laws, which are frequently instantiated but\ntypically if not always complex. Armstrong (1983: 137\u2013140) draws\na distinction between laws that are \u201ciron\u201d and have no\nexceptions and those that are \u201coaken\u201d and have no\nexceptions as long as no interfering conditions are present.\nIn his language, unless Cartwright has overlooked the possibility that\nsome laws might be both complex and true, she seems to be saying that\ntheoretical laws are \u201coaken\u201d laws for which there are no\n\u201ciron\u201d counterparts. If that is right, then she has failed\nto appreciate the distinction between counterfactual conditionals\n(which may be true in spite of having no instances) and mere\nindicative conditionals (which may be true because they have\nno instances). The \u201cprovisos\u201d problem implies that\nsatisfying the requirement of maximal specificity may be more\ndemanding than has been generally understood in the past. Either way,\nCartwright\u2019s theses appear to trade on an equivocation between\nthe non-existence of \u201ciron\u201d counterparts and their\nnon-availability: even if the \u201ciron\u201d laws within a domain\nare not yet known, it does not follow that those laws do not\nexist.\n",
