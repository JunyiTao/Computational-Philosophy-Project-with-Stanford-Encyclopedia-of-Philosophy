    "main_text": "Scientific Methodology\n6. Newtonian Attraction\n\n\nThe first ten chapters of the Foundations provide the\nepistemology, metaphysics and theorizing on scientific methodology\nthat is meant to provide the foundations for the remaining chapters on\nNewtonian physics. An evaluation of the success of that seemingly\nparadoxical project must await a much more sustained treatment than\ncan be given here.  Rather, in this final section of this survey of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's natural philosophy, we focus on one chapter of that\nlater material both to show ways in which the earlier chapters affect\nthose that follow, and to show the limits to the characterization of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet as a metaphysical\n systematizer.[27]\n This chapter is chapter 16: On Newtonian Attraction.\n\n\nIn this chapter, she argues against some of Newton's followers\nwho aimed to universalize Newton's attraction. While Du\nCh\u00e2telet argues that Newton's theory of attraction is\nbetter than Descartes' vortices at explaining the effects of\ngravity, and that Newton's theory of attraction can\nsatisfactorily explain a wide range of other phenomena such as tidal\nmovements, the rotation of the earth, and irregularities in the\nmovement of the moon, she criticizes Newton's disciplines for\nextending Newton's theory of attraction too far. In one\nespecially interesting section, she focuses on the Newtonian theories\n(IP \u00a7389\u201392) of John Freind (1675/76\u20131728) and John Keill\n(1671\u20131721).\n\n\nIn \u00a7391, titled \u201cThe usage that Mss. Freind and Keill have\nmade of the principle of attraction\u201d (notably, she discusses only\nKeill therein), she writes:\n\n\n\nAt the end of his Introductio ad veram Astronomiam\n(Introduction to the True Astronomy), Mr. Keill set several\npropositions, through which he maintains we can deduce geometrically\nthe majority of phenomena by means of this attraction, if it is\npowerful in contact.\n\n\nAccording to these propositions, not only are cohesion and chemical\neffects the result of attraction, but so too are the spring of bodies\nand the phenomena of electricity\u2026.\n\n\nWe find the source of all these applications of attraction in the\nquestions that Mr. Newton posed at the end of his\n Optics.[28]\nThe disciples of this great\nman believed that his doubts might serve even as a basis for their\nhypotheses: but it must be admitted that some of these hypotheses\nare a bit forced and that there is a great difference in accuracy\nbetween the applications of attraction to celestial phenomena and the\nuse one makes of it in the other effects just mentioned. Also this\nuse of attraction is not as universally received by the same\nNewtonians, as the use of it when one is in fact explaining\nastronomical phenomena. (IP \u00a7391; emphasis\n added)[29]\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, what Du Ch\u00e2telet disputes in Keill's\nuniversalization of Newton's theory of attraction is his use of\nit to explain, among other phenomena, the cohesion of bodies and their\nspring, or elasticity. To make these claims, which focus\nspecifically on features intrinsic to bodies rather than on relational\nfeatures that bodies bear, Du Ch\u00e2telet believes these thinkers\nmust claim that attraction is a property of matter itself\n(IP\n \u00a7389\u201392).[30]\nHer mention in this passage\nof his \u201cforced\u201d hypotheses alerts us to the fact that she\nbelieves Keill is using hypotheses in forwarding this claim about\nmatter. As the previous section showed, she can have no quibble\nwith the fact that he uses hypotheses, yet she clearly dissents from his\nhypotheses with respect to the nature of matter and the phenomena he\nwishes to explain through this matter theory.\n\n\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the PSR positively rules out extending\nattraction to account for the nature of matter. How so? The argument\nseems to be that if attraction (as some sort of active\nprinciple or force) were to be inherent in bodies, then bodies would\nalways move, and yet bodies always moving is contrary to our\nexperience of the physical world. There is no sufficient\nreason\u2014an inherent passive principle within bodies, for\nexample, to counteract the active force\u2014to account for the brute\nfact that bodies are also sometimes at rest. So attraction cannot be\nan inherent property of matter (c.f.  IP Avant-propos\nVII). Yet for attraction to explain the cohesion of bodies, it would\nneed to be an inherent property. So attraction cannot be employed as\nthe cause of the cohesion of bodies.\n\n\nThree crucial points for a consideration of Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nscientific method and her position between pre-modern and modern\nconceptions of natural philosophy and then science emerge from this\ndiscussion of Newtonian attraction. First, the role played by\nexperience of the world is crucial for her. If our experience (in this\ncase, the brute fact that bodies are sometimes at rest) falsifies an\nhypothesis (namely, that attraction belongs to matter), then the\nhypothesis must be rejected.  Second, while Du Ch\u00e2telet accepts\nthe systematic interconnection of the created world as a feature of\nit, and as a sort of heuristic in our scientific practice, she puts\nstrict limits on the scientist's appeal to a systematic account of\nphenomena, especially in light of falsifying experience. So, while the\nuniversalizing of Newton's theory of attraction to account for a\nplethora of phenomena would represent a more interconnected physical\nsystem, this systematicity must be rejected in light of our\nexperiences of nature. Finally, while it is true that Du\nCh\u00e2telet thinks a full scientific account must try to give the\ncauses of phenomena we experience\u2014whether those be causes in the\nbasic metaphysical tier or causes in the derivative, subvisible\nphysical tier\u2014when scientists are unable to give a causal\naccount without violating the empirical facts of nature, then they\nought not to give such an account. So while it is true that\nDu Ch\u00e2telet invokes hypotheses in her approach to natural\nphilosophy, and while it is true that in doing so, she departs\nradically from those who believe that the aim of science is to merely\ndescribe (ideally in mathematical terms) the phenomena without appeal\nto metaphysical systems underlying those phenomena, the\nparticular\u2014indeed, very modern\u2014flavor of her theory of\nhypotheses puts strict limits on that metaphysics. This underscores\nthe point made at the close of \u00a74 above: there is a connection\nbetween metaphysics and physics in Du Ch\u00e2telet's view, but we\nare not always able to ascertain that connection, and so, the\nscientist cannot claim systematic unity in physics when doing so runs\nroughshod over empirical data or either of her two foundational\nprinciples. While still a natural philosopher, she has taken a\ndecisive step toward modern science in her masterwork, Foundations\nof Physics.\n",
