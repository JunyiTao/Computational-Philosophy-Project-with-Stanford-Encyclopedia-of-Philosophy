Quantum Motion on Shape Space \n\nA natural thought that one sometimes hears expressed is that Bohmian\nmechanics, for which particles with well-defined positions in space\nplay a central role, cannot easily accommodate a relational framework,\nas most prominently advocated by Julian Barbour (1999). With such a\nframework, location in space is not a fundamental physical\nnotion. Rather it is shapes formed by arrangements of particles,\nshapes determined by relative positions, that are physical.\n\nBohmian mechanics can naturally be extended to a relational framework,\nwhich also leads to a relational notion of time as well. Within this\nframework, the more familiar descriptions in terms of absolute space\nand time emerge merely as corresponding to a choice of gauge\n(D\u00fcrr et al. 2020a). Thus, rather than being a regression to\noutdated modes of physics, a Bohmian perspective suggests the\npossibility that much of what we regard as fundamental in physics\nmight in fact be imposed by us, through our choice of gauge.\n",
