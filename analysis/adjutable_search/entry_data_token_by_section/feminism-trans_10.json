    "main_text": "(Trans) Gender Trouble || Trans Critiques of Butler\n5.3 Trans Critiques of Butler\n\n\nButler's theory has the advantage of answering Raymond's\nassumption that all gendered behavior is inherently replicative of\nsexist norms, by providing a theoretical basis for the subversive\npotential of some queer gender performance and by jettisoning a view\nwhich sees biological male/female sex as independent of culture. In\nthis way, her work is highly congenial to transgender theory and\npolitics. Yet Butler's theory also has some significant\ndifficulties which have led some trans scholars to voice strong\nobjections to her work.\n\n\nNotably, Butler's theory leaves the charges of gender\nreplication entirely applicable to those trans people who see\nthemselves and who behave as \u201creal\u201d men and women, as her\naccount of Xtravaganza indicates. The tension involves her account of\ngender identity as socially constructed as well as her account of\nsubversion (on the one hand), and the importance of gender identity and\ngender realness to some trans people (on the other). To be sure, there\nis no obvious theoretical tension here, since Butler can explain the\nimportance of gender identity and gender realness. The problem, rather,\nis that this vision may not be politically useful for trans folk who\nseek to emphasize the importance of gender identity and realness for\nsome trans people.\n\n\nThe tension seems to derive, in part, from the fact that\nButler's aims to defend some forms of queer gender behavior in\nopposition to heterosexual gender behavior. In this model,\ntransgressive gender performance is closely wedded to non-heterosexual\nsexuality (Prosser 1998, 31\u201332). In arguing that Xtravaganza is killed\nbecause of her gender subversion, Butler must understand this as\nbreaking from demands of heterosexuality (Prosser 1998, 46). What is\nmissing from such an account is recognition of trans oppression as a\nmodality in some ways distinct from the heterosexism.\n\n\nPerhaps more problematically, Butler's suggestion that\nXtravanganza is killed as a woman of color elides the specifics of\nviolence against trans women: Xtravangaza was not killed as a Latina\nwoman, but as a Latina transsexual, working as prostitute (Prosser\n1998, 47, Namaste 2000, 13). Moreover, Butler's suggestion that\nsex-change, for Xtravaganza, is an imagined vehicle to transcend her\neconomic and racial conditions fails to take sufficiently serious her\ntranssexual identity (Namaste 2000, 13\u20134). Indeed, both Jay\nProsser (1998, 50\u201355) and Viviane Namaste (2000, 14) argue that\nButler's treatment of Xtravaganza involves allegorizing\nher life and death as a way to generate theoretical mileage for her own\nviews while failing to make room for her as a person who lived and died\nas a transsexual. In addition to such concerns, deeper theoretical\nworries about Butler's position are raised by both Prosser (1998)\nand Namaste (2000).\n\n\nProsser (1998) takes issue with Butler's view at the\ntheoretical level of identity and body. For Butler, the acquisition of\na gender identity (along with the corresponding heterosexual desire)\ninvolves the selection of certain bodily pleasures as acceptable and\nthe rejection of others as unacceptable (1990, 89\u201390). This selection\nof appropriate pleasure is determined in such a way that pleasures do\nnot literally derive from a particular body part \u201cwhere\u201d\nthey are located (90\u20131). Rather the sexual pleasure derives from the\neroticization of that body part (i.e., by its role as an\nobject in erotic fantasy). In heterosexual\n\u201cincorporation\u201d the eroticization of body parts is falsely\nliteralized where the body part is then construed as the\n\u201ccontainer\u201d and \u201csource\u201d of sexual bodily\npleasure (87\u201390). In this way, the subjective experience of one's\nsexed body is nothing but a literalized fantasy.\n\n\nIn response to this account, Prosser claims that Butler misreads\nFreud according to whom, he argues, the body ego really does arise\nfrom the body (1998, 40\u20132). Prosser appeals to Didier Anzieu's\nnotion of the \u201cskin ego\u201d\u2014the \u201cinner\nexperience\u201d of the body arising from bodily sensations\u2014which\nserves as a significant interface between psyche and body (65\u201367). This\nallows Prosser to argue that transsexuals appeal to the notion of the\n\u2018wrong body\u2019 because it simply feels that way\n(68\u20139). His account of body ego departs from Butler in emphasizing\nbodily sensation and proprioceptive awareness, rather than the\nvisualization of bodily surface (78\u20139). Prosser deploys notions of\nbodily agnosia (the neurological inability to track parts of\none's body) (78) and phantom limb experiences (84\u20135) to\nhelp explain the way in which a transsexual's body image may not\naccord with their actual body.\n\n\nProsser's view has the advantage of offering a more plausible\naccount of the body ego. Yet it is also worth remarking that little\nattention is paid to the way in which social conceptions of the body\nmight impact the ego. By grounding transsexuality so thoroughly in the\nbody, Prosser's view does not appear well-equipped to accommodate\ntranssexual self-identifications as woman or man\nwhere such identifications involve more than the body, but also social\nrole. In this way, Prosser seems to offer a conception of self (or at\nleast bodily self) which is implausibly independent of cultural\ndemands.\n\n\nWhile Prosser's work primarily focuses on Butler's\npsychoanalytic account of ego formation, Viviane Namaste's (2000)\nfocuses on Butler's account of queer drag as subversive. In\nNamaste's view, Butler fails to heed to the larger social context\nin which gay male drag is situated and through which gender is\nregulated. Namaste points to the social facts that gay male drag\nperformance is often restricted to entertainment on the stage where it\nis viewed as \u201cmere performance.\u201d By contrast, gay male\nsexual identity is not restricted to the stage and is not viewed as\n\u201cmere performance\u201d (10\u201313). Given that Butler allows for an\nambivalence in subversion, however, it isn't clear that her view\ncannot accommodate these social facts in the way that she theorizes\ndrag performance in Paris is Burning. Yet Namaste aims for a\ndeeper theoretical critique, charging Butler with departing from a\npost-structuralist framework which situates such phenomena precisely\nwithin a broader social analysis she sees lacking in Butler's\naccount (16\u201323).\n\n\nBy using drag as a way to represent and theorize all gender\nrelations, argues Namaste, Butler fails to examine the multiple concrete\nways in which gender is regulated in everyday life (20\u20131). It\nisn't clear that this by itself undermines Butler's claim\nthat some gender behavior can be genuinely subversive (and indeed,\nButler does not point only to drag, but also butch/femme presentations\nof gender). However, it may nonetheless raise worries about\nButler's attempt to offer a uniform theory of gender as\nimitation. Given that degree of abstraction from concrete social\ncircumstance, it may be that Butler omits crucial elements of gender\nthat are specific to various concrete social practices.\n",
