    "main_text": "The Content of Russellian Monism || Three Core Russellian Monist Theses\n1.1 Three Core Russellian Monist Theses\n\nRussellian monism can be seen as combining three core theses:\nstructuralism about physics, which states roughly that\nphysics, at least current physics (see section 4.1), describes the\nworld only in terms of its spatiotemporal structure and dynamics;\nrealism about quiddities, which states that there are\nquiddities, that is, properties that underlie the structure\nand dynamics physics describes; and quidditism about\nconsciousness, which states that quiddities are relevant to\nconsciousness. We will discuss these theses in turn.\n\nTo understand the first core thesis, structuralism about physics,\nconsider David J. Chalmers\u2019s description of how physical theory\ncharacterizes its basic entities:\n\n\n\u2026physical theory only characterizes its basic entities\nrelationally, in terms of their causal and other relations to\nother entities. Basic particles, for instance, are largely\ncharacterized in terms of their propensity to interact with other\nparticles. Their mass and charge is specified, to be sure, but all\nthat a specification of mass ultimately comes to is a propensity to be\naccelerated by certain forces, and so on. Each entity is characterized\nby its relation to other entities, and so on forever. \u2026The\npicture of the physical world that this yields is that of a giant\ncausal flux, but the picture tells us nothing about what all this\ncausation relates. Reference to the proton is fixed as the\nthing that causes interactions of a certain kind, that combines in\ncertain ways with other entities, and so on; but what is the thing\nthat is doing the causing and combining? As Russell (1927a) notes,\nthis is a matter about which physical theory is silent. (Chalmers\n1996: 153)\n\n\nChalmers\u2019s description expresses structuralism about physics\nvividly. But his claim that physical theory characterizes its basic\nentities only relationally could be challenged. Shape is usually\ncounted among an object\u2019s non-relational properties (Stoljar\n2015). For example, contrast a ball\u2019s sphericality, a\nnon-relational property, with its tendency to roll when pushed, a\nrelational property. So, if physical theory characterizes its basic\nentities partly in terms of their shapes, then Chalmers\u2019s claim\nmight seem doubtful.\n\nSuch considerations need not be taken to indicate that structuralism\nabout physics is false. But they do seem to indicate that the relevant\ndistinction between structural and non-structural properties\u2014the\none relevant to structuralism about physics\u2014does not align with,\nand thus should not be explicated in terms of, the\nrelational/non-relational distinction. (Henceforth we omit mention of\ndynamics because the relevant issues concern structure.)\n\nStructuralism about physics is sometimes formulated in terms of the\ndistinction between extrinsic and intrinsic properties (Chalmers 1996:\n153\u2013155; see the entry\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties).\n But those formulations have been challenged on similar grounds: a\nball\u2019s sphericality is usually counted among its intrinsic\nproperties, as are other properties in terms of which physical theory\ncharacterizes its basic entities (Ney 2015; Stoljar 2015). (We will\nhenceforth use \u2018extrinsic\u2019 and \u2018relational\u2019\ninterchangeably, and likewise for \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and\n\u2018non-relational\u2019.) It might therefore be preferable to\nexplicate the structural/non-structural distinction in a different\nway.\n\nOne approach is to do so by distinguishing between relatively\nand absolutely intrinsic properties (Pereboom 2011:\n92\u201397, 2014, 2015, 2016; for an alternative explication, see\nChalmers 2010: 20, fn. 17; 2013: 256; cf. Alter 2016: 804\u201309).\nRoughly, relatively intrinsic properties are intrinsic properties that\nare nothing over and above extrinsic properties, whereas absolutely\nintrinsic properties are intrinsic properties that are not relatively\nintrinsic. (The relative/absolute intrinsicness distinction derives\nfrom Leibniz and Kant; see Leibniz to De Volder April 1702 [Leibniz G\nII, 240; 1969: 526\u2013527]; Kant 1781/1787: A277/B333; Pereboom\n1985: 413\u201323; 1991b; Van Cleve 1988; Langton 1998.)\n\nWe can articulate that distinction more precisely in terms of\nmetaphysical grounding (or, on some conceptions, constitution; see the\nentries\n metaphysical grounding\n and\n material constitution)\n where A grounds (or constitutes)\nB just in case A metaphysically necessitates\nB and B exists in virtue of A, as follows\n(Pereboom 2016):\n\n\nP is a relatively intrinsic property of X\njust in case P is an intrinsic property of X and\nP is grounded in extrinsic properties of either X or\nparts of X.\n\n\nBy contrast,\n\n\nP is an absolutely intrinsic property of X\njust in case P is an intrinsic property of X and\nP is not grounded in extrinsic properties of either\nX or parts of X.\n\n\nThus, for example, it seems plausible that a ball\u2019s sphericality\nis grounded in spatiotemporal relations among its parts (as Leibniz\nargued; Leibniz to De Volder April 1702 [G II, 240; 1969:\n526\u2013527]; see\n section 2.1\n below) and is therefore merely relatively intrinsic. A similar point\napplies to other intrinsic properties described in physics. For\nexample, although mass would seem to be an intrinsic property of\nmaterial entities, in the passage quoted above Chalmers remarks that\nin physical theory, \u201call that a specification of mass ultimately\ncomes to is a propensity to be accelerated by certain forces, and so\non\u201d (Chalmers 1996: 153). Accordingly, the only aspects of mass\nthat physical theory describes are relatively, not absolutely,\nintrinsic.\n\nSuppose structuralism about physics is explicated such that structural\nproperties are construed as extrinsic properties or relatively\nintrinsic properties. In that case, the thesis is consistent with the\nclaim that physical theory characterizes its basic entities partly in\nterms of its intrinsic properties, as long as those intrinsic\nproperties are relatively and not absolutely intrinsic. (For further\ndiscussion of structuralism about physics, see\n section 4.1\n below; and the entries\n structuralism in physics\n and\n structural realism.)\n\nThe second core Russellian monist thesis, realism about quiddities,\nstates that there are (instantiated) properties of precisely the sort\nabout which, according to structuralism about physics, physical theory\nis silent: properties that underlie the spatiotemporal structure\nphysical theory describes. Those properties categorically ground the\nmost basic physical dispositions that physics describes, in the way a\nball\u2019s spherical shape categorically grounds its disposition to\nroll when pushed. These underlying properties are often called\nquiddities (Lewis 2009; Chalmers 2012). They are also called\ninscrutables (Montero 2010). The latter designation is meant\nto indicate something on which many proponents of realism about\nquiddities agree: we know little about quiddities beyond the\ntheoretical roles they are supposed to play.\n\nOne might reject realism about quiddities even if one accepts\nstructuralism about physics. As Chalmers (2013: 254) writes,\n\u201cThere are respectable structuralist or dispostionalist views of\nphysics on which physics involves just structure or dispositions all\nthe way down\u201d (e.g., Ladyman and Ross, with Spurrett and Collier\n2007; Ney 2015; cf. Shoemaker 1980; Hawthorne 2001; McKitrick 2003).\nBut Russellian monists and others (e.g., Lewis 2009) regard such\nstructuralist or dispositionalist views as implausible. That is\nbecause such views \u201cseem to yield a world devoid of substance or\nqualities\u201d (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 254]). A world devoid of\nsubstance or qualities might or might not be possible. But according\nto realism about quiddities, the actual world is not like that.\n\nThe third core Russellian monist thesis, quidditism about\nconsciousness, states that quiddities are relevant to consciousness.\nMore specifically, it states that quiddities are relevant to\nphenomenal consciousness. For example, consider the feeling\none has when suffering from a painful migraine or when seeing a\nbrilliantly red sunset. As it is often put, there is something it\nis like to have a phenomenally conscious experience (Nagel 1974;\nsee the entry\n consciousness;\n throughout, all references to consciousness refer to phenomenal\nconsciousness). There is no consensus among Russellian monists on\nexactly how quiddities are relevant to consciousness\n (section 4).\n But many claim that phenomenal properties are constituted by\nquiddities, or by quiddities together with various structural\nproperties.\n\nOne might reject quidditism about consciousness even if one accepts\nstructuralism about physics and realism about quiddities. For example,\none might combine the latter two theses with a dualist theory on which\nquiddities categorically ground the most basic physical dispositions\nphysics describes but are not relevant to consciousness (perhaps on\nthis theory consciousness is fundamental and not constituted by\nanything). By contrast, according to quidditism about consciousness,\nquiddities play both of those roles.\n\nOne could identify Russellian monism with the conjunction of all three\ncore theses, where each thesis could be explicated in different ways,\nresulting in different varieties of the theory. For present purposes,\nthat characterization will suffice (see below, sections 1.2 and 4; for\nan alternative characterization, see Pereboom 2011: 89; cf. Alter and\nNagasawa 2012: 71\u201372.)\n",
