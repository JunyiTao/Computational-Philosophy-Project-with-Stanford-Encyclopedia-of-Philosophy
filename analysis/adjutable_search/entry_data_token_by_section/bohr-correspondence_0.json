    "main_text": "Background and Scientific Context\n1. Background and Scientific Context\n\nNiels Bohr was a Danish physicist who lived from 1885 until 1962; he\nwas born and died in Copenhagen. He is best known as one of the\nfounders of quantum theory and for his work on the structure of atoms,\nwhich earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. In addition to\nhis scientific work, he devoted much of his career to the\nphilosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics. He was involved in\na famous long-standing debate with Albert Einstein over whether\nquantum mechanics was a complete description of atomic phenomena (the\n\u201cEinstein-Bohr Debate\u201d), and his lasting contributions to\nthe philosophical interpretation of quantum theory include the\nCopenhagen interpretation, the thesis of complementarity, and the\ncorrespondence principle.\n\nThe correspondence principle was first introduced in the context of\nthe old quantum theory, which was developed in the period between 1900\nand 1925. The old quantum theory was an \u201cinterim\u201d theory\ndeveloped in response to the recognition that Newtonian mechanics and\nclassical electrodynamics are inadequate for the description of atomic\nsystems. Although the old quantum theory had remarkable empirical\nsuccesses, it was criticized for having what many thought were\ninconsistent foundations. The old quantum theory was ultimately\nreplaced by modern quantum mechanics with Werner Heisenberg\u2019s\ndevelopment of matrix mechanics in 1925 and Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s development of wave mechanics in 1926.\n\nIn order to understand the substance of the correspondence principle,\nit is necessary to first understand the basic framework of the old\nquantum theory. Niels Bohr first articulated the postulates of the old\nquantum theory in 1913, in a three-part paper titled \u201cOn the\nConstitution of Atoms and Molecules\u201d (Bohr 1913). Bohr had\nadopted Ernest Rutherford\u2019s model of the atom, according to\nwhich most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small central\nnucleus, while the electrons orbit the nucleus in planetary\ntrajectories. The key challenge facing Rutherford\u2019s model was\nthat it was unstable: according to classical electrodynamics, the\nelectron, which is an accelerated charged body, should radiate energy\nand so rapidly collapse into the nucleus. Bohr\u2019s solution was to\nincorporate Max Planck\u2019s theory of radiation, which postulates\nthat \u201cthe energy radiation from an atomic system does not take\nplace in the continuous way assumed in ordinary electrodynamics, but\nthat it, on the contrary, takes place in distinctly separated\nemissions\u201d (Bohr 1913, p. 4; BCW 2, p.\n 164).[1]\n\nBohr summarized his quantum theory by means of two assumptions or\npostulates. According to the first postulate, electrons cannot travel\nin any path around the nucleus; rather, atomic systems can only exist\nin one of a series of discrete \u201cstationary states,\u201d in\nwhich the electron is in a particular allowed stable periodic orbit\nand is not emitting radiation. Intuitively, these stationary states\ncan be thought of as a series of concentric circular orbits around the\nnucleus, along which the electron travels; these stationary states are\nlabeled by means of the principal quantum number \\(n\\), with the\nlowest allowed orbit (the \u201cnormal\u201d or ground state)\nlabeled \\(n = 1\\), the next stationary state of higher energy\n\\(n = 2\\), and so on. Bohr postulates that when the electron is\nin one of these stationary states, its motions can be adequately\ndescribed by means of classical mechanics; however, when the electron\nmakes a transition from one stationary state to another, the classical\ntheory no longer applies. The second postulate of Bohr\u2019s old\nquantum theory is that, when there is a transition between different\nstationary states, \\(n'\\) and \\(n''\\), the\nemitted radiation is of a single frequency, \\(\\nu\\), that is given by the\ndifference in the energy of the two states,\n\\((E_{n'} - E_{n''})\\), divided by Planck\u2019s\nconstant.\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\nu = \\frac{E_{n'} - E_{n''}}{h}\n\\]\n\n\nThis formula is typically referred to as the \u201cBohr-Einstein\nfrequency condition.\u201d The second postulate constituted a\nsignificant break from classical electrodynamics, according to which a\nvariety of radiation frequencies would be emitted and those\nfrequencies would be determined solely by the motion of the\nsource.\n\nIt is important to note that while it is now accepted that this\nemitted radiation is a photon, Bohr himself was surprisingly skeptical\nof the photon concept up until as late as the mid-1920s (Stachel\n2009). Bohr preferred to think of the emitted or absorbed radiation as\na wave, rather than as a particle. Bohr\u2019s hesitation in\naccepting the existence of photons during this period seems to arise\nfrom his concern that such a particle conception of light would be\nirreconcilable with familiar interference phenomena. For example, Bohr\nwrites in 1921,\n\nThus according to this theory of light quanta, electromagnetic\nradiation from an atom should not spread as a system of spherical\nwaves, but should be propagated in a definite direction as a\nconcentrated entity, containing within a very small volume the energy\n\\(h\\nu\\). On one hand such a conception seems to offer the only\nsimple possibility of accounting for the phenomena of photoelectric\naction, if we adhere to an unrestricted application of the notions of\nconservation of energy and momentum. On the other hand, it does not\nappear reconcilable with the phenomena of interference of light, which\nconstitute our only means of analysing radiation in its harmonic\nconstituents and determining the frequency and state of polarisation\nof each of these constituents. (Bohr 1921a unpublished; BCW 3, pp.\n412\u2013413)\n\n\nIt is interesting that Bohr\u2019s initial rejection of the photon\nconcept was also tied to the importance of being able to analyze\nradiation into its harmonic components, which was essential for the\napplication of his correspondence principle (discussed below). As John\nStachel notes, \u201cIt was indeed, his reliance on the\ncorrespondence principle that seems to have been a principal motive\nfor Bohr\u2019s distrust of the photon concept and his related\nwillingness to give up energy-momentum conservation to save the\nclassical electrodynamic picture of radiation\u201d (Stachel 2009,\np.72). Stachel argues that it was, in part, the results of the\nBothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon experiments that finally led Bohr to\nembrace the concept of the photon. For these historical reasons, care\nneeds to be exercised in invoking the photon concept when discussing\nBohr\u2019s early views; nonetheless the concept of photons can be\nvery helpful in understanding the physics behind the correspondence\nprinciple (as well as Bohr\u2019s views after the early-1920s), and\nhence, will be invoked in the following exposition.\n\nReturning to the outline of the old quantum theory, Bohr\u2019s two\npostulates were not yet enough to pick out, from all of the\nclassically allowed orbits, those orbits corresponding to stationary\nstates. In order to determine the stationary states, the following\n\u201cquantum condition\u201d also needs to be introduced:\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\oint p_{\\theta} d\\theta = nh \\,.\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the integral is taken over one period of the electron orbit, and\n\\(p_{\\theta}\\) is the angular momentum, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle in the plane of the electron orbit,\nand \\(n\\) is the quantum number.[2] As Max Jammer summarizes, applying the old\nquantum theory consists of essentially three steps: \u201cfirst, the\napplication of classical mechanics for the determination of the\npossible motions of the system; second, the imposition of certain\nquantum conditions for the selection of the actual or allowed motions;\nand third, the treatment of the radiative processes as transitions\nbetween allowed motions subject to the Bohr frequency formula\u201d\n(Jammer 1966, p. 90). The old quantum theory was a blending of\nclassical and quantum ideas: while it is assumed that the motion of an\nelectron within a particular stationary state can still be\ndescribed on the basis of the classical theory, the radiation given\noff in a transition between stationary states (the\n\u201cquantum jumps\u201d) cannot.\n\nIn order to understand the substance of the correspondence principle\nit is helpful to consider a simplified model of the atom as a\none-dimensional system, where the electron is undergoing simply\nperiodic motion. Classically the trajectory of the electron is given\nby \\(x(t)\\), which is the solution to Newton\u2019s\nequation of motion, and is periodic, which means it simply retraces\nits steps over and over again with a frequency, \\(\\omega\\), known as the\nfundamental frequency. Because the motion is periodic, the position of\nthe electron can be represented by a Fourier series as\n follows:[3]\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\nx(t) = C_1\\cos(\\omega t) + C_2\\cos(2\\omega t) + C_3\\cos(3\\omega t) + \\cdots\\,.\n\\] \n\n\nEach of these terms in the sum is known as a harmonic, and the\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic is given in terms of the time, \\(t\\),\nan amplitude, \\(C_{\\tau}\\), and a frequency,\n\\(\\omega_{\\tau}\\), which is an integer multiple of the\nfundamental frequency, \\(\\omega_{\\tau} = \\tau \\omega\\) (these\nmultiples of the fundamental frequency are referred to as the\n\u201covertones\u201d). According to classical\nelectrodynamics, the frequencies of the radiation emitted by this atom\nshould just be given by the frequencies in the harmonics of the\nmotion: \\(\\omega,\\) \\(2\\omega,\\) \\(3\\omega,\\) etc.; hence the spectrum of this\nclassical system should be a series of discrete evenly spaced\nlines.\n\nAccording to Bohr\u2019s old quantum theory, by contrast, the\nradiation is not a result of the accelerated motion of the electron in\nits orbit, but rather of the electron jumping from one stationary\nstate to another; and rather than giving off all of the harmonic\n\u201covertones\u201d together, only a single frequency, \\(\\nu\\), is\nemitted, and the value of that frequency is given by the Bohr-Einstein\nfrequency condition (Equation 1). The spectral lines are built up by a\nwhole ensemble of atoms undergoing transitions between different\nstationary states, and these spectral lines, though they exhibit a\npattern of regularity, are not evenly spaced\u2014except in the limit\nof large quantum numbers.\n\nFollowing Bohr, one can label the difference between the\n\\(n'\\) stationary state and the \\(n''\\)\nstationary state by \\(\\tau\\); that is, if the electron jumps to the\nnearest stationary state, \\(\\tau = 1\\); if it jumps two stationary states\naway, \\(\\tau = 2\\); and so on. Although according to the classical\ndefinition \\(\\tau\\) specifies a particular harmonic component of the\nclassical motion, according to the quantum mechanical definition \\(\\tau\\)\nspecifies the change in the quantum number in a particular jump.\n",
