    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe inherent problems with Plato\u2019s original theory were\nrecognized already by Plato himself. In his Parmenides Plato\nfamously raised several difficulties, for which he apparently did not\nprovide satisfactory answers. Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.), with all\ndue reverence to his teacher, consistently rejected Plato\u2019s\ntheory, and heavily criticized it throughout his own work. (Hence the\nfamous saying, amicus Plato sed magis amica\n veritas).[1]\n Nevertheless, despite this explicit doctrinal conflict, Neo-Platonic\nphilosophers, pagans (such as Plotinus ca. 204\u2013270, and\nPorphyry, ca. 234\u2013305) and Christians (such as Augustine,\n354\u2013430, and Boethius, ca. 480\u2013524) alike, observed a\nbasic concordance between Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\napproach, crediting Aristotle with an explanation of how the human\nmind acquires its universal concepts of particular things from\nexperience, and Plato with providing an explanation of how the\nuniversal features of particular things are established by being\nmodeled after their universal\n archetypes.[2]\n In any case, it was this general attitude toward the problem in late\nantiquity that set the stage for the ever more sophisticated medieval\n discussions.[3]\n In these discussions, the concepts of the human mind, therefore, were\nregarded as posterior to the particular things represented by these\nconcepts, and hence they were referred to as universalia post\nrem (\u2018universals after the thing\u2019). The universal\nfeatures of singular things, inherent in these things themselves, were\nreferred to as universalia in re (\u2018universals in the\nthing\u2019), answering the universal exemplars in the divine mind,\nthe universalia ante rem (\u2018universals before the\n thing\u2019).[4]\n All these, universal concepts, universal features of singular things,\nand their exemplars, are expressed and signified by means of some\nobviously universal signs, the universal (or common) terms of human\nlanguages. For example, the term \u2018man\u2019, in English is a\nuniversal term, because it is truly predicable of all men in one and\nthe same sense, as opposed to the singular term\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, which in the same sense, i.e., when not used\nequivocally, is only predicable of one man (hence the need to add an\nordinal number to the names of kings and popes of the same name).\n\nDepending on which of these items (universal features of singular\nthings, their universal concepts, or their universal names) they\nregarded as the primary, really existing universals, it is customary\nto classify medieval authors as being realists,\nconceptualists, or nominalists, respectively. The\nrealists are supposed to be those who assert the existence of\nreal universals in and/or before particular things,\nthe conceptualists those who allow universals only, or\nprimarily, as concepts of the mind, whereas nominalists would\nbe those who would acknowledge only, or primarily, universal words.\nBut this rather crude classification does not adequately reflect the\ngenuine, much more subtle differences of opinion between medieval\nthinkers. (No wonder one often finds in the secondary literature\ndistinctions between, \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d\nversions of these crudely defined positions.) In the first place,\nnearly all medieval thinkers agreed on the existence of\nuniversals before things in the form of divine ideas existing\nin the divine\n mind,[5]\n but all of them denied their existence in the form of\nmind-independent, real, eternal entities originally posited by Plato.\nFurthermore, medieval thinkers also agreed that particular things have\ncertain features which the human mind is able to comprehend in a\nuniversal fashion, and signify by means of universal terms. As we\nshall see, their disagreements rather concerned the types of the\nrelationships that hold between the particular things, their\nindividual, yet universally comprehensible features, the universal\nconcepts of the mind, and the universal terms of our languages, as\nwell as the ontological status of, and distinctions between, the\nindividualized features of the things and the universal concepts of\nthe mind. Nevertheless, the distinction between \u201crealism\u201d\nand \u201cnominalism\u201d, especially, when it is used to refer to\nthe distinction between the radically different ways of doing\nphilosophy and theology in late-medieval times, is quite justifiable,\nprovided we clarify what really separated these ways, as I\nhope to do in the later sections of this article.\n\nIn this brief summary account, I will survey the problem both from a\nsystematic and from a historical point of view. In the next section I\nwill first motivate the problem by showing how naturally the questions\nconcerning universals emerge if we consider how we come to know a\nuniversal claim, i.e., one that concerns a potentially infinite number\nof particulars of a given kind, in a simple geometrical demonstration.\nI will also briefly indicate why a na\u00efve Platonic answer to these\nquestions in terms of the theory of perfect Forms, however plausible\nit may seem at first, is inadequate. In the third section, I will\nbriefly discuss how the specific medieval questions concerning\nuniversals emerged, especially in the context of answering\nPorphyry\u2019s famous questions in his introduction to\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, which will naturally lead us to\na discussion of Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian answers to these\nquestions in his second commentary on Porphyry in the fourth section.\nHowever, Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian answers anticipated only one\nside of the medieval discussions: the mundane, philosophical theory of\nuniversals, in terms of Aristotelian abstractionism. But the other\nimportant, Neo-Platonic, theological side of the issue provided by\nBoethius, and, most importantly, by St. Augustine, was for medieval\nthinkers the theory of ontologically primary universals as the\ncreative archetypes of the divine mind, the Divine Ideas. Therefore,\nthe fifth section is going to deal with the main ontological and\nepistemological problems generated by this theory, namely, the\napparent conflict between divine simplicity and the multiplicity of\ndivine ideas, on the one hand, and the tension between the Augustinian\ntheory of divine illumination and Aristotelian abstractionism, on the\nother. Some details of the early medieval Boethian-Aristotelian\napproach to the problem and its combination with the Neo-Platonic\nAugustinian tradition before the influx of the newly\nrecovered logical, metaphysical, and physical writings of Aristotle\nand their Arabic commentaries in the second half of the\n12th century will be taken up in the sixth section, in\nconnection with Abelard\u2019s (1079\u20131142) discussion of\nPorphyry\u2019s questions. The seventh section will discuss some\ndetails of the characteristic metaphysical approach to the problem in\nthe 13th century, especially as it was shaped by the\ninfluence of Avicenna\u2019s (980\u20131037) doctrine of common\nnature. The eighth section outlines the most general features of the\nlogical conceptual framework that served as the common background for\nthe metaphysical disagreements among the authors of this period. I\nwill argue that it is precisely this common logical-semantical\nframework that allows the grouping together of authors who endorse\nsometimes radically different metaphysics and epistemologies (not only\nin this period, but also much later, well into the early modern\nperiod) as belonging to what in later medieval philosophy came to be\nknown as the \u201crealist\u201d via antiqua, the\n\u201cold way\u201d of doing philosophy and theology. By contrast,\nit was precisely the radically different logical-semantical approach\ninitiated by William Ockham (ca. 1280\u20131350), and articulated and\nsystematized most powerfully by Jean Buridan (ca. 1300\u20131358),\nthat distinguished the \u201cnominalist\u201d via moderna,\nthe \u201cmodern way\u201d of doing philosophy and theology from the\nsecond half of the 14th century. The general, distinctive\ncharacteristics of this \u201cmodern way\u201d will be the discussed\nin the ninth section. Finally, the concluding tenth section will\nbriefly indicate how the separation of the two viae, in\naddition to a number of extrinsic social factors, contributed to the\ndisintegration of scholastic discourse, and thereby to the\ndisappearance of the characteristically medieval problem of\nuniversals, as well as to the re-mergence of recognizably the same\nproblem in different guises in early modern philosophy.\n",
