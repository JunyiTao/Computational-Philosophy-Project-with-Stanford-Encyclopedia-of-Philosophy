    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry focuses on the historical sources and formative moments in\nthe development of Islamic theology and philosophy of religion. While\nmost of the thinkers and ideas are from the classical period of Islam\n(ca. 800\u20131300) in a few cases we have extended our survey to the\nseventeenth century to include influential post-classical thinkers,\nlike Mulla \u1e62adr\u0101. Despite this limitation, the period\ncovered was one of the most intellectually robust periods in the\ndevelopment of Islamic philosophy of religion. While most of the\ntopics covered in this entry are common to philosophy of\nreligion\u2014such as the existence of God, God\u2019s relation to\nthe cosmos, the issue of evil and the like\u2014Muslims and those\nunder the influence of Islam frequently imprinted these issues with\ntheir own unique stamp. Such unique moments include the thoroughly\ndeveloped occasionalism of Muslim theologians, the development by\nphilosophers and theologians of a Necessary Being theology and even\nframing the problem of evil differently from the one frequently seen\namong contemporary western philosophers of religion.\n",
