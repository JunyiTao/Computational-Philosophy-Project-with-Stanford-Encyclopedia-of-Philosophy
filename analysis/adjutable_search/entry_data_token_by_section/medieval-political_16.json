    "main_text": "Thomas Aquinas\n9. Thomas Aquinas\n\nThomas Aquinas wrote a work in the \u201cmirror of princes\u201d\ngenre, namely On Kingship, to the King of Cyprus, but\notherwise his political writing was incidental to his academic work,\nand not, as was the case with most medieval political writers, an\nattempt to influence contemporary events. The Summa\ntheologiae includes discussions of dominion in the state of\ninnocence, natural law and other kinds of law, property, the best form\nof government, the duty of obedience, war, coercion of heretics and\ninfidels, and other political matters. These discussions are not\norganised into a separate treatise on politics but distributed through\nthe work in accordance with its plan as a summary of\n theology.[49]\n\n\nWhereas Augustine had held that in the state of innocence there would\nhave been no lordship of man over man, Thomas says that there would\nhave been dominium [lordship] in the state of innocence\n (Summa, 1, q. 96, a. 4).\n This has sometimes been taken as a rejection of Augustine in favour\nof Aristotle\u2019s doctrine that politics is natural. However,\nThomas says that in the state of innocence there would have been no\ncoercion, but there would have been government in the sense of wise\nleadership voluntarily accepted by the less wise. This is a view found\nnot in Aristotle but in earlier Latin writers, for example Seneca (see\n \u00a73),\n and the contradiction with Augustine is merely verbal\u2014for\nAugustine dominium implies coercion, for Thomas its sense is\nbroader.\n\nOn natural law and other kinds of law Thomas again follows not\nAristotle but the tradition of civil and canon law going back to the\nRoman\n Stoics.[50]\n He distinguishes divine law (eternal and positive) from human law,\nand among human laws he distinguishes natural law from the law of\nnations and civil law (see\n Summa, 1\u20132, q. 95, a. 4).\n Law is concerned with direction to the common good, which belongs to\nthe whole people\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 90, a. 3).\n All positive human law must be in accordance with natural law, though\nits prescriptions will depend upon choice and circumstances (for\nexample, natural law prescribes that we must not kill, but human\npositive law makes additional rules to prevent killing, rules that may\ndepend on arbitrary choice\u2014e.g., there may be a rule requiring\nmotorists to drive on the left and not the right, or vice versa (see\n Summa, 1\u20132, q. 95, a. 2).\n Natural law is in effect morality, and according to Thomas the human\nmind, reflecting on and analysing human experience, can see the truth\nof various fundamental moral principles, which are thus\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, not in need of proof, and too fundamental\nto be capable of proof\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 91, a. 3,\n and\n q. 94, a. 2).[51]\n\n\nOn property, Thomas follows the view of the Stoics and the Fathers\nthat property exists by human positive law. Natural law permits us to\nuse things\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 1),\n but property goes beyond power to use: it includes a power to exclude\nothers from use, and this power is conferred by human positive law\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 2).\n Property rights give way to extreme need (see above), so in time of\nextreme need using another\u2019s property without permission is not\ntheft\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 7).\n\nThe best form of government, according to Thomas, is a mixed\ngovernment combining elements of democracy, aristocracy and kingship\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 105, a. 1).\n This is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s preference for mixed\ngovernment over either democracy or oligarchy, but in fact many\nancient writers, including Cicero, advocated mixed government, and on\nthis topic Thomas is closer to Polybius\u2014whom he did not\nknow\u2014than to Aristotle (Blythe 1992: 57\u20138).\n\nOn the duty to obey government, Thomas does not adopt the position\nthat many others found in the New Testament, that disobedience is\nnever justified. According to Thomas Aquinas, though there is a\ngeneral duty to obey the law and the government, an unjust law is not\na law\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 96, a. 4;\n see also\n 2\u20132, q. 104, a. 5).[52]\n\n\nOn war, Thomas is an exponent of a version of the \u201cjust\nwar\u201d theory Augustine took from the ancient Romans. For a war to\nbe just, it must be commanded by someone in authority, there must be a\njust cause, and it must be carried on without disproportionate\nviolence. It is not justifiable to lie to an enemy, since that would\ndestroy the trust that will be needed to restore peace\n (see Summa, 2\u20132, q. 40, a. 1, a. 3).\n\nOn questions relating to the coercion of heretics and unbelievers,\nThomas supports the practice of the medieval Church. A heretic (i.e.,\nsomeone who has been baptised as a Catholic but has since rejected\northodox Catholic doctrine) can rightly be compelled to return to the\nChurch, but a Jew or unbeliever who has never been a Catholic should\nnot be converted by force\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 8).\n Simple people should not be exposed to the opinions of unbelievers\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 7, 9).\n The children of Jews should not be taken from them and brought up as\nCatholics, since this would violate natural justice, which gives\nparents control over under-age children\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 12).\n The religious rites of Jews may be tolerated, but not those of other\nunbelievers, except to avoid strife or in hope of their gradual\nconversion\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 11).\n",
