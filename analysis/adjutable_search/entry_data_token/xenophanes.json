Many later writers, perhaps influenced by\ntwo brief characterizations of Xenophanes by Plato (Sophist\n242c\u2013d) and Aristotle (Metaphysics 986b18\u201327),\nidentified him as the founder of Eleatic philosophy (the view that,\ndespite appearances, what there is is a changeless, motionless, and\neternal \u2018One\u2019).

Life and Works\n\nIn his Lives of the Philosophers (Diels-Kranz, testimonium\nA1), Diogenes Laertius reports that Xenophanes was born in the small\nIonian town of Colophon and flourished during the sixtieth Olympiad\n(540\u2013537 BCE). Laertius adds that when Xenophanes was\n\u201cbanished from his native city\u201d he \u201cjoined the\ncolony planted at Elea\u201d (in Italy), and also lived at Zancle and\nCatana (two Greek communities in Sicily). He credits Xenophanes with\ncomposing verses \u201cin epic meter, as well as elegiacs and iambics\nattacking Hesiod and Homer and denouncing what they said about the\ngods\u201d, with reciting his own works, and with composing poems on\nthe founding of Colophon and Elea. Later writers add that \u201che\nburied his sons with his own hands\u201d, was sold into slavery, and\nlater released from it. By Xenophanes\u2019 own account (B8) he\n\u201ctossed about the Greek land\u201d for sixty-seven years,\nstarting at the age of twenty-five.\n\nDiels-Kranz (DK) provides 45 fragments of his poetry (although B4, 13,\n19, 20, 21 and 41 would be more accurately classified as\ntestimonia), ranging from the 24 lines of B1 to the\nsingle-word fragments of B21a, 39, and 40. A number of the\n\u2018sympotic poems\u2019 (poems for drinking parties) (B1\u20133,\n5, 6, 22, and the imitation in C2) were preserved by Athenaeus, while\nthe remarks on the nature of the divine were quoted by Clement\n(B14\u201316 and 23), Sextus Empiricus (B11, 12, and 24), and\nSimplicius (B25 and 26). Other snippets survive in the accounts by\nDiogenes Laertius and A\u00ebtius, or as marginal notes in our\nmanuscripts of various authors, or as entries in later rhetorical\nsummaries and dictionaries. Seventy-four selections, of which the most\nextensive is the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Melissus,\nXenophanes, Gorgias (MXG), make up the collection of\ntestimonia in DK. Laertius\u2019 statement (A1) that\nXenophanes \u201cwrote in epic meter, also elegiacs, and\niambics\u201d is confirmed by extant poems in hexameters and elegiac\nmeter, with one couplet (B14) a combination of hexameter and iambic\ntrimeter. Ancient writers referred to a number of his compositions as\nsilloi\u2014\u2018squints\u2019 or satires, and a critical\ntone pervades many of the surviving fragments. Three late sources\ncredit Xenophanes with a didactic poem under the title Peri\nPhuse\u00f4s (\u201cOn Nature\u201d) but not every allusion to\nan earlier author\u2019s views \u201con nature\u201d represented a\nreference to a single work on that subject.\n2. Criticisms of Greek Popular Religion\n\nFragments B11 and B12 describe, and implicitly criticize, the stories\nabout the gods told by Homer and Hesiod.\n\nHomer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods\n\nall sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among\nmen:\n\ntheft, adultery, and mutual deception. (B11)\n\n\n\u2026as they sang of numerous illicit divine deeds:\n\ntheft, adultery, and mutual deceit. (B12)\n\n\nThe basis for Xenophanes\u2019 unhappiness with the poets\u2019\naccounts is not explained, but we may infer from the concluding call\nto pay due honor to the gods in Xenophanes\u2019 B1 that an\nattribution of scandalous conduct would be incompatible with the\ngoodness or perfection any divine being must be assumed to possess\n(cf. Aristotle Meta. 1072b; Plato, Rep. 379b.)\n\nIn the well-known fragments B14\u201316, Xenophanes comments on the\ngeneral tendency of human beings to conceive of divine beings in human\nform:\n\nBut mortals suppose that gods are born,\n\nwear their own clothers and have a voice and body. (B14)\n\n\nEthiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and black;\n\nThracians that theirs are are blue-eyed and red-haired. (B16)\n\n\nB15 adds, probably in a satirical vein, that if horses and oxen had\nhands and could draw pictures, their gods would look remarkably like\nhorses and oxen. B17, \u201c\u2026and bacchants of pine stand round\nthe well-built house\u201d may represent a criticism of the common\nancient belief that a god could assume possession of a physical object\nso as to offer protection to its possessor. The ridiculing of\nPythagoras\u2019 claim to have recognized the soul of a departed\nfriend in the voice of a barking dog (B7), together with the attacks\non divination credited to Xenophanes in A52, reflect the broader\ndenial of knowledge of divine attributes and operations set out in\nB34. Xenophanes is prepared to offer a positive account of the nature\nof the deity (see the following section) but his position appears to\nbe that while no mortal being will ever know about the gods with any\ndegree of certainty, we can at least avoid adopting beliefs and\npractices clearly at odds with the special nature any divine being\nmust be assumed to possess.\n3. The Nature of the Divine\n\nSo far as is known, Xenophanes was the first Greek thinker to offer a\ncomplex and at least partially systematic account of the divine\nnature. We have already noted how an implicit assumption of divine\nperfection may underlie his criticisms of Homer, Hesiod, and the\ntendency to imagine the gods in human form. Of the positive\ncharacterizations of the divine made in B23\u201326, perhaps the most\nfundamental is B23:\n\nOne god greatest among gods and men,\n\nnot at all like mortals in body or in thought.\n\n\nAlthough the remark has often been read as a pioneering expression of\nmonotheism, this reading is made problematic by the nearby reference\nto \u2018gods\u2019 in the plural in the first line and the\npossibility that Xenophanes sought to highlight not the one\ngod but rather the one greatest god (cf. Homer,\nIliad 12, 243 for the use of \u2018one\u2019 (Greek\nheis) reinforcing a superlative). The relevant measures of\ndivine \u2018greatness\u2019 are not specified, but the two most\nobvious choices would be greatness in honor and power, with honor\nperhaps the more basic of the two (cf. Iliad 2, 350; 2, 412;\n4, 515; Od. 3, 378; 5,4; Hesiod, Theogony 49, 534,\n538, etc.). Greatness in power would in turn explain the\ncharacterizations of the divine as perceptive and conscious in all its\nparts (B24), able to shake all things by the exercise of his thought\n(B25), and able to accomplish everything while remaining forever in\nthe same place or condition (B26). It is unclear, however, how far\nXenophanes himself realized the interconnections among the different\ndivine attributes or sought to exploit those connections for didactic\npurposes. At least as they have come down to us, none of the remarks\non the divine nature (B23\u201326) contains any of the inferential\nparticles (gar, epei, oun, hoti, etc.) one would normally\nexpect to find in a piece of reasoned discourse.\n\nSome later writers (A28.6, 31.2, 34\u201336) report that Xenophanes\nidentified his \u2018one greatest god\u2019 with the entire physical\nuniverse\u2014often termed \u2018the whole\u2019 or \u2018all\nthings\u2019, and some modern accounts portray Xenophanes as a\npantheist. But this understanding of Xenophanes\u2019 doctrines seems\ninconsistent with his assertion that \u201cgod shakes all\nthings\u201d (B25) that \u201call things are from the earth and to\nthe earth all things come in the end\u201d (B27), and that \u201call\nthings which come into being and grow, are earth and water\u201d\n(B29). On the whole, Xenophanes\u2019 remarks on the divine nature\nare perhaps best read as an expression of a traditional Greek piety:\nthere exists a being of extraordinary power and excellence, and it is\nincumbent on each of us to hold it in high regard.\n4. Social Criticism\n\nFive fragments touch on traditional subjects of Greek sympotic\nverse\u2014on proper conduct at symposia (drinking parties), the\nmeasures of personal excellence, and the existence of various human\nfoibles or failures. Xenophanes appears to have been particularly\ninterested in identifying and discouraging conduct that failed to pay\ndue honor to the gods or posed a risk to the stability and well-being\nof the city (or perhaps both). Although these passages may be\ninsufficiently abstract and demonstrative in character to count as\n\u2018philosophical teachings\u2019, they do represent an important\nbridge between Greek poetry of the archaic period and the kind of\nmoral theorizing practiced by many 5th and 4th-century thinkers.\nXenophanes\u2019 disparagement of the honors accorded to athletes\n(B2), his call to censor the stories the poets tell about the gods\n(B1), and counsel to live a life of moderation (B3 and 5, and perhaps\nB21) all anticipate views expressed in Plato\u2019s Republic\n(cf. 607a, 378b, 372b.) His criticism of the pursuit of useless\nluxuries (B3) also anticipates Socrates\u2019 rebuke of his fellow\ncitizens for caring more about wealth and power than about virtue (cf.\nApology 30b.) His cautionary remarks about knowledge (B34)\nand reminder of the subjectivity of human taste (B38: \u201cIf god\nhad not made yellow honey, they would think that figs were far\nsweeter\u201d) also reflect a traditional view of human judgment as\nlimited and conditioned by personal experience. In each of these\nareas, Xenophanes\u2019 social commentary represents a continuation\nof the Greek poetic tradition as well as a step toward explicit\nphilosophical theorizing.\n5. Scientific Interests\n\nWe may reasonably conclude from several surviving fragments and a\nlarge number of testimonia that Xenophanes was well aware of\nthe teachings of the Milesian philosopher-scientists (Thales,\nAnaximander, and Anaximenes), and sought to improve on them. While\nmany of the details of his own \u2018scientific\u2019 views remain\nobscure, the range and interconnectedness of his interests make him an\nimportant figure in the development of Ionian scientific theory.\nTheodoretus, Stobaeus, and Olympiodorus (all in A 36) credit him with\na view of earth as the arch\u00ea or \u201cfirst\nprinciple\u201d of all things. Yet Galen (also in A36) rejects this\nattribution, and B29 equates \u201call things which come into being\nand grow\u201d with \u201cearth and water\u201d. A\ntwo-substance arch\u00ea would, moreover, be compatible with\nthe many references to physical mixtures. A33 credits Xenophanes with\na view of the sea as containing many mixtures, while B37 notes the\npresence of water in rocky caves, and A50 reports a view of the soul\nas earth and water. Insofar as some natural bodies are described as\nconsisting entirely of water (or of a part of water, as in A46 where\n\u201cthe sweet portion\u201d of the water is drawn up from the sea\nand separated off), it would be best to understand Xenophanes\u2019\n\u201ctwo-substance theory\u201d in a distributed sense: all things\nare either earth, or water, or earth combined with water.\n\nXenophanes appears to have explored many of the same phenomena studied\nat an earlier date by the Milesians. B28 presents a view of the nature\nand extent of the earth\u2019s depths; B30 identifies the sea as the\nsource of clouds, wind, and rain; B32 comments on the nature of Iris\n(rainbow); B37 notes the presence of water in caves; B39 and 40\nmention \u201ccherry trees\u201d and \u201cfrogs\u201d;\nA38\u201345 discuss various astronomical phenomena, and A48 indicates\nan interest in periodic volcanic eruptions in Sicily. Hippolytus (A33)\ncredits Xenophanes with a theory of alternating periods of world-wide\nflood and drought that was inspired, at least in part, by the\ndiscovery of fossilized remains of sea creatures at inland locations.\nWhether or not Xenophanes himself traveled to Syracuse, Paros, and\nMalta where these remains were found, his use of this information as\nthe basis for a broad explanation of phenomena is an implicit\ntestimonial to the heuristic value of information gained through\ntravel and observation.\n\nMany testimonia credit Xenophanes with an interest in\nmeteorological and astronomical phenomena. Not only are these comments\nof interest in their own right, they also present us what was arguably\nhis single most important scientific contribution--his contention that\nclouds or cloud-like substances play a basic role in a great many\nnatural phenomena. The term nephos (\u201ccloud\u201d)\nappears only twice in the fragments of his work (in B30 and 32) but\nmany testimonia either bear directly on the nature of clouds\nor make use of clouds in order to explain the nature of other\nphenomena. To cite an example of the first type, according to Diogenes\nLaertius \u201che says\u2026the clouds are formed by the\nsun\u2019s vapor [i.e. vapor caused by the heat from the sun\u2019s\nrays] raising and lifting them to the surrounding air\u201d\n(A1.24\u20135). A\u00ebtius (A46) provides a similar account:\n\nXenophanes (says that) things in the heavens occur through the heat of\nthe sun as the initial cause; for when the moisture is drawn up from\nthe sea, the sweet portion, separating because of its fineness and\nturning into mists, combines into clouds, trickled down in drops of\nrain due to compression, and vaporizes the winds.\n\n\nB30 gives us essentially the same view in Xenophanes\u2019 own\nwords:\n\nThe sea is the source of water and of wind,\n\nFor without the great sea, there would be no wind\n\nNor streams of rivers, nor rainwater from on high\n\nBut the great sea is the begetter of clouds, winds, and rivers.\n\n\nHaving accounted for the formation of clouds in mechanistic terms\nthrough processes of vaporization and compression Xenophanes proceeds\nto make use of clouds to explain a large number of meteorological and\nastronomical phenomena. The general claim appears in the\npseudo-Plutarch Miscellanies: \u201che says that the sun and\nthe stars come into being from the clouds\u201d (A32), and\nA\u00ebtius gives us many specific applications: \n\nThe stars come into being from burning clouds (A38).\n\n\nThe sort of fires that appear on ships--whom some call the Dioscuri\n[St. Elmo\u2019s fire]--are tiny clouds glimmering in virtue of the\nsort of motion they have (A39).\n\nThe sun consists of burning clouds\u2026a mass of little fires,\nthemselves constructed from the massing together of the moist\nexhalation (A40).\n\nThe moon is compressed cloud (A43).\n\nAll things of this sort [comets, shooting stars, meteors] are either\ngroups or movements of clouds (A44).\n\nFlashes of lightning come about through the shining of the clouds\nbecause of the movement (A45).\n\n\nAs it happens, clouds are natural candidates for the\nexplanans in a scientific account. Since they are midway in\nform between a solid and gaseous state they are easily linked with\nsolids, liquids, and gases of various kinds. And since they occupy a\nregion midway between the surface of the earth and the upper regions\nof the heavens, they are well positioned to link the two basic\nsubstances of earth and water with many astronomical phenomena.\n\nAnother important feature of Xenophanes\u2019 cloud-based approach to\nunderstanding natural phenomena is the application of this theory to a\nset of phenomena closely linked with traditional religious belief. We\nhave already seen this in the thoroughly naturalistic accounts given\nof the \u201cgreat sea\u201d, sun, moon, and stars, but nowhere is\nthe contrast of the old and new ways of thinking more evident than in\nhis comments on \u201cIris\u201d--rainbow:\n\nAnd she whom they call Iris, this too is by nature a cloud.\n\nPurple, red, and greenish-yellow to behold. (B32)\n\n\nFor the members of Xenophanes\u2019 audience \u201cIris\u201d\nreferred to the messenger goddess of Homer\u2019s Iliad (2,\n686) and Hesiod\u2019s Theogony (780) and a set of\natmospheric phenomena (halos, coronae, and cloud iridescence) commonly\nconsidered portents or signs of the intentions of divine beings. As\nthe daughter of Thaumas (\u201cmarvel\u201d) Iris was the natural\nmarvel par excellence. Yet for Xenophanes,\n\u2018she\u2019 is really an \u2018it\u2019 and a\n\u2018this\u2019 (the Greek neuter demonstrative touto), by\nnature a purple, red, and greenish-yellow cloud. It is, moreover,\nsomething that is there for us \u2018to behold\u2019 or \u2018to\nlook at\u2019 (idesthai). Perhaps nowhere in presocratic\nphilosophy can we find a clearer expression of the character of the\nIonian \u2018intellectual revolution\u2019\u2014a decision to put\naside an older way of thinking about events grounded in a belief in\ndivine beings in favor of an approach to understanding the world that\nemploys wide-ranging inquiry and direct observation and resorts to\nstrictly physical causes and forces. Having deprived the gods of human\nform and clothing and removed the divine to some permanent and distant\nlocation, Xenophanes proceeds to strip a wide range of natural\nphenomena of all vestiges of religious or spiritual significance. His\nde-mythologized account of natural phenomena is, in short, the logical\ncomplement to his thoroughly de-naturalized account of the divine\nnature.\n\nDespite its several virtues, Xenophanes\u2019 physical theory appears\nto have had little impact on later thinkers. Anaxagoras followed his\nlead on the nature of the rainbow (cf. DK 59 B19) and Empedocles knew\n(but repudiated) his claim of the earth\u2019s indefinitely extended\ndepths (DK 31 B39). But both Plato and Aristotle appear to have\nignored Xenophanes\u2019 scientific views or assigned them little\nimportance. One factor that may have contributed to this chilly\nreception was the absence of any expression by Xenophanes of the kind\nof commitment to teleology that both Plato and Aristotle regarded as\nessential to a proper understanding of the cosmos. Xenophanes\u2019\nuniverse is controlled by a set of forces, but it is never described\nas \u201cheading toward the best\u201d nor is it directed toward\nsome best result by a controlling intelligence. (Xenophanes\u2019\ndivine does \u201cshake all things\u201d by the thought of his mind\n(alone), but he is never described as in any way directing or\ncontrolling particular events.) It is also obvious that\nXenophanes\u2019 heavenly bodies would have fallen far short of the\nlevel of perfection that, with Aristotle, became a hallmark of\nclassical astronomical theory. Not only are Xenophanes\u2019 heavenly\nbodies not divine beings, they undergo creation and destruction at\nregular intervals. Only from the perspective of a much later period\ncan the merits of Xenophanes\u2019 scientific views be fairly\nappreciated. Many centuries would have to pass before an emphasis on\ndirect observation and the use of entirely natural causes and forces\nwould become the scientific orthodoxy.\n6. Reflections on Knowledge\n\nFive surviving fragments and roughly a dozen testimonia\naddress what might be termed \u2018epistemological\nquestions\u2019\u2014\u201cHow much can any mortal being hope to\nknow?\u201d, \u201cDoes truth come to us through our own efforts or\nby divine revelation?\u201d, and \u201cWhat role do our sense\nfaculties play in the acquisition of knowledge?\u201d Unfortunately,\nthe picture that emerges from many of the testimonia largely\ncontradicts what appear to be the views Xenophanes himself expressed.\nAccording to the summary in the pseudo-Plutarch Miscellanies,\nXenophanes \u201cdeclares that the senses are deceptive and generally\nrejects reason along with them\u201d (A32.) Similarly, in his\nConcerning Philosophy Aristocles reports that\n\u201c\u2026since they think that sense perceptions and appearances\nmust be rejected and trust only reason. For at one earlier time\nXenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus said something of this\nsort\u201d (A49). Similarly, A\u00ebtius declares that\n\u201cPythagoras, Empedocles, and Xenophanes (say that) sense\nperceptions are deceptive\u201d (A49). Yet, as we have noted, B28\nrefers without qualification to \u201cthe upper limit of the earth\nthat is seen (horatai) here at our feet\u201d and B32\nappears to encourage those in Xenophanes\u2019 audience to\n\u2018look at\u2019 or \u2018observe\u2019 (idesthai) the\nmulti-colored cloud that is the rainbow. The realistic description of\nthe sumptuous banquet in B1 and the wide range of Xenophanes\u2019\nreported geographical and geological interests all sit poorly with an\nEleatic \u201crationalism\u201d that would dismiss all information\ngained through our faculties of sense and construct on the basis of\nreason alone a view of \u201cwhat is\u201d as a motionless,\nchangeless and eternal unity.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 most extended comment on knowledge is B34:\n\n\u2026and of course the clear and certain truth no man has seen\n\nnor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about\nall things.\n\nFor even if, in the best case, one happened to speak just of what has\nbeen brought to pass,\n\nstill he himself would not know. But opinion is allotted to all.\n\n\nPortions of these remarks were quoted, and thereby preserved for\nposterity, by the ancient skeptics who hailed Xenophanes as the\nfounder of their particular variety of philosophical skepticism.\nRecent interpretations of B34 reject the skeptical interpretation in\nfavor of other less extreme readings. On some accounts, B34 is\nconcerned to deny only a direct perceptual awareness. Others find in\nhis comments a distinction between natural science, where only\nprobabilities can be achieved, and theology, where certainty is\npossible. Still others read Xenophanes\u2019 remarks as a blanket\nendorsement of \u201cfallibilism\u201d\u2014the view that while\neach individual is free to express his or her opinion, the possibility\nof error can never be completely excluded.\n\nSince B34 opens with the phrase \u201cand indeed\u2026\u201d it is\nlikely that we do not have the whole of the remark, or all the\npremises from which its main conclusion was intended to follow.\nHowever, the use of the term saphes (\u201cclear\u201d, in\nthe first line of the fragment) by Xenophanes\u2019 Ionian\ncontemporary, the historian Herodotus, provides a helpful clue to the\nlogic of the argument. At several points in his History\nHerodotus speaks of what is saphes, or what can be known in a\nsaphe\u00f4s manner, as what can be confirmed to be the case\non the basis of first-hand observation:\n\nAnd wishing to gain sure knowledge of these things (thel\u00f4n\nde tout\u00f4n peri saphes ti eidenai) from a point where this\nwas possible, I took ship to Tyre in Phoenicia, where I heard there\nwas a very holy temple of Heracles. There I saw it (eidon)\nrichly equipped\u2026 Then I went to Thasos where I also found a\ntemple of Heracles\u2026Therefore what I have discovered by inquiry\nclearly shows (ta men nun histor\u00eamena d\u00ealoi\nsaphe\u00f4s) that Heracles is an ancient god. (History\nII, 44)\n\n\nSince the gods were believed to inhabit a realm far removed from that\nof mortal beings, it would be natural for Xenophanes to hold that no\naccount of their nature and activities could possibly be confirmed on\nthe basis of first-hand observation, hence known for certain to be\ncorrect. And since the pioneering cosmological accounts put forward by\nhis Milesian predecessors held that a single material substance\nunderlay phenomena in all places and times it would be\nequally impossible for any individual to confirm such a universal\nclaim on the basis of first-hand observation, hence know for certain\nthat it was true\u2014even if in fact it was true. The sentiments\nexpressed in lines three and four can be read as reinforcing this\ncautionary sentiment. Their point would be that no one (moreover)\nshould be credited with knowledge (of the certain truth concerning the\ngods or the nature of all things) simply on the basis of having\ncorrectly described, perhaps even predicted, individual events as they\ntake place (perhaps a reference to self-styled paragons of wisdom and\npredictors of events such as Epimenides and Pythagoras). The overall\nmessage of B34, from its opening reference to \u201cno man\u201d to\nits concluding phrase \u201cfashioned for all\u201d would have been\nthat there never has been nor ever will be anyone who has the capacity\nto achieve certainty with respect to these important matters.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 reference to a second-best level of comprehension or\nawareness\u2014\u2018opinion\u2019 or \u2018conjecture\u2019\n(dokos) should not be read as inherently negative or\ndismissive. By Platonic standards, opinion\u2014even when\ncorrect\u2014would be an inferior possession, unstable and subject to\nremoval through persuasion. But we have no reason to assume that\nXenophanes shared Plato\u2019s view on this topic. And in fact B35,\nquoted by Plutarch in connection with encouraging a bashful speaker to\nexpress his views, appears to present what one \u2018opines\u2019 or\nbelieves in a fairly positive light:\n\n\u2026Let these things be believed (dedoxasth\u00f4) as\nlike the realities\u2026\n\n\nThe similarity between the verbal dedoxasth\u00f4 of B35 and\nthe nominative dokos of B34 permits us to combine the two\nfragmentary remarks into a single coherent view: of course there can\nbe no knowledge of the certain truth concerning the gods and the basic\nprinciples governing the cosmos, but dokos\u2014opinion or\nconjecture\u2014is available and should be accepted when it\ncorresponds with how things really are.\n\nThe full sense of B36, however, may never be determined. Neither its\ncontext (a grammatical treatise of Herodian) nor its wording\n(\u201c\u2026however many they have made evident for mortals to\nlook upon\u201d) provides definitive guidance. Perhaps Xenophanes was\nseeking to set an upper limit to the range of things that can be known\nby human beings (i.e. to caution others that they could know only as\nmany as things as the gods had made available to them to experience).\nBut it is equally possible that the remark was intended (as B32 above)\nto encourage the members of his audience to explore and inquire on\ntheir own (i.e. to encourage them to investigate \u201chowever many\nthings\u201d the gods have made available to them to experience).\n\nB18 has often been hailed as an expression of an optimistic outlook or\n\u201cfaith in human progress\u201d\u2014the conviction that\nhumankind has made and will continue to make improvements in the arts\nand conditions of life generally. Yet none of the other surviving\nfragments reflects such an optimism and several (e.g. B2 and 3)\nsuggest that Xenophanes was not at all optimistic about his\ncity\u2019s prospects for survival. In the light of his reported\nrepudiation of divination (A52), de-mythologizing of various natural\nphenomena (B30 and 32), and evident enthusiasm for inquiry into a wide\nrange of subjects, B18 is perhaps best read as an expression of faith\nin the value of \u2018inquiry\u2019 or \u2018seeking\u2019 as the\npreferred approach to gaining knowledge of \u2018all\nthings\u2019.\n\nTo sum up: Xenophanes\u2019 attitude toward knowledge appears to have\nbeen the product of two distinct impulses. While he believed that\ninquiry in the form of travel and direct observation was capable of\nyielding useful information about the nature of things, he remained\nsufficiently under the influence of an older piety to want to caution\nothers against seeking to understand matters that lay beyond the\nlimits of all human experience. Here, as in other aspects of his\nthought, Xenophanes stands with one foot in the world of the archaic\npoet and the other in the \u201cnew science\u201d of the late 6th\nand early 5th centuries BCE\n7. Xenophanes\u2019 Legacy\n\nMany later writers identified Xenophanes as the teacher of Parmenides\nand the founder of the Eleatic \u201cschool of\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014the view that, despite appearances, what there\nis is a motionless, changeless, and eternal \u2018One\u2019. This\nview of Xenophanes is based largely on Plato\u2019s reference to\n\u201cour Eleatic tribe, beginning from Xenophanes as well as even\nearlier\u201d (Sophist 242d) and Aristotle\u2019s remark\nthat \u201c...with regard to the whole universe, he says that the one\nis the god\u201d (Meta. A5, 986b18), along with some verbal\nsimilarities between Xenophanes\u2019 description of the \u201cone\ngreatest, unmoving god\u201d and Parmenides\u2019 account of a\n\u201cmotionless, eternal, and unitary being\u201d. But the\nXenophanes who speaks to us in the surviving fragments is a\ncombination of rhapsode, social critic, religious teacher, and keen\nstudent of nature. Euripides\u2019 Heracles 1341 ff. echoes\nhis attack on the stories told about the gods by Homer and Hesiod\n(B11\u201312) and a passage of Euripides\u2019 Autolycus\nquoted by Athenaeus (C2) repeats portions of the attack on the honors\naccorded to athletes delivered in B2. In the Republic, Plato\nshows himself the spiritual heir of Xenophanes when he states that the\nguardians of his ideal state are more deserving of honors and public\nsupport than the victors at Olympia, criticizes the stories told about\nthe gods by the poets, and calls for a life of moderate desire and\naction. A pronounced ethic of moderation, sometimes bordering on\nasceticism, runs through much of ancient Greek ethical thought,\nbeginning with Solon and Xenophanes and continuing through Socrates\nand Plato to the Epicureans and Cynics. Xenophanes\u2019 conception\nof a \u201cone greatest god\u201d who \u201cshakes all things by\nthe thought (or will) of his mind\u201d (noou phreni) may\nhave helped to encourage Heraclitus\u2019 belief in an\n\u2018intelligence\u2019 (gn\u00f4m\u00ea) that steers\nall things (B41), Anaxagoras\u2019 account of the nous that\norders and arranges all things (B12), and Aristotle\u2019s account of\na divine nous that inspires a movement toward perfection\nwithout actually doing anything toward bringing it about\n(Metaphysics Lambda.)\n\nIn his Dictionnaire historique et critique (1697) Pierre Bayle began\nthe modern philosophical discussion of the problem of evil by quoting\nXenophanes\u2019 remark (as reported in Diogenes Laertius 9.19) that\n\u201cmost things give way to mind\u201d (ta polla\nh\u00eass\u00f4 nou). Accepting the conjecture proposed by the\nclassical scholar M\u00e9ric Casaubon, Bayle took Xenophanes to be\nasserting that God was unable to make all things conform to his\nbenevolent will. Bayle then assembled a set of texts in support of the\nview that in fact the amount of evil in the universe far exceeds the\namount of good. Bayle\u2019s article sparked a reply from Leibniz (in\nhis Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e of 1710). In his Candide (1759), Voltaire\nsupported Bayle\u2019s view by ridiculing Leibniz\u2019s contention\nthat this is the best of all possible worlds. Although there may be no\ndirect line of influence, we may also consider Feuerbach\u2019s\ncritique of religious belief as a \u2018projection\u2019 of human\nattributes, and Freud\u2019s analysis of religious belief as an\ninstance of \u2018wish-fulfillment\u2019, as two modern successors\nto Xenophanes\u2019 observation of the general tendency of human\nbeings to conceive of divine beings in terms of their own attributes\nand capacities.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 most enduring philosophical contribution was\narguably his pioneering exploration of the conditions under which\nhuman beings can achieve knowledge of the certain truth. The\ndistinction between knowledge and true opinion set out in B34 quickly\nbecame an axiom of ancient Greek accounts of knowledge and survives in\nmodern garb as the \u2018belief\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019\nconditions of the \u2018standard\u2019 or \u2018tripartite\nanalysis\u2019 of knowledge. It can be plausibly argued that every\nlater Greek thinker, at least until the time of Aristotle, undertook\nto respond to the basic challenge posed in Xenophanes\u2019\nB34\u2014how, given the severely limited character of human\nexperience, anyone can plausibly claim to have discovered the truth\nabout matters lying beyond anyone\u2019s capacity to observe\nfirst-hand. Xenophanes may also be credited with expanding the range\nof topics considered appropriate for philosophical inquiry and\ndiscussion. His Ionian predecessors had initiated the study of\nphenomena \u201cabove the heavens and below the earth\u201d but, so\nfar as we know, they did not turn their critical fire against the\nleading poets of ancient Greece nor did they seek through their\nteachings to correct or improve the conduct of their fellow citizens.\nAlthough many aspects of his thought remain the subject of scholarly\ndebate, Xenophanes was clearly a multi-dimensional thinker who left\nhis mark on many aspects of later Greek thought.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Boo\">Books</a>", "<a name=\"ArtChaBoo\">Articles or Chapters in Books</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Boo\">Books</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Bryan, Jenny, 2012, <em>Likeness and Likelihood in the\nPresocratics and Plato</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress.", "Gemelli Marciano, M.
