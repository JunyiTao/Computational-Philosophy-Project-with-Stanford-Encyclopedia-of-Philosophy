    "main_text": "Early Phenomenology || Collective Intentionality and Social Ontology\n2.4 Collective Intentionality and Social Ontology\n\nStein\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of sociality goes far\nbeyond her investigation of interpersonal or empathic relations.\nThough empathy is a necessary basis for any form of sociality, it is\ncertainly not sufficient for all forms of being-together. Accordingly,\nin her two books, Beitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen\nBegr\u00fcndung der Psychologie and Geisteswissenschaft (1922)\nand Eine Untersuchung \u00fcber den Staat (1925), Stein\ndiscusses a complex range of social entities and facts and the\nmechanisms that constitute them. Initially, Stein follows her\nphenomenological contemporaries (Scheler 1916/1926), as well as\nearlier social psychologists (Le Bon 1895) and sociologists\n(T\u00f6nnies 1887/1935; Simmel 1908; Litt 1919) in distinguishing\nthree general \u201ctypes of socialization\u201d\n(Vergesellschaftung) (1922: 110[130]): the \u201cmass\u201d\nor \u201ccrowd\u201d (Masse), \u201csociety\u201d\n(Gesellschaft), and \u201ccommunity\u201d\n(Gemeinschaft) (1922: 230\u2013246[283\u2013295]; see\nSzanto forthcoming). But Stein not only adds to this her systematic\nanalysis of the state (1925) (see\n sect. 4.1),\n in her treatise on \u201cIndividual and Community\u201d (1922), she\noffers an unprecedentedly fine-grained phenomenological analysis of\nthe cognitive, experiential, intentional, volitional, affective and\nmoral life of communities in general. Before elaborating the nature of\ncommunities, let us briefly demarcate it from the crowd and societies\nor associations.\n\nRoughly, crowds are ad-hoc and temporary social formations, chiefly\ncharacterized by automatic mimicry of one another\u2019s emotional\nexpression and behavior. These eventually converge, not by being\ncentered on a common goal or by sharing collective intentions, but by\nso-called \u201cpsychic\u201d or emotional \u201ccontagion\u201d\n(1922: 148\u2013159[175\u2013191]). Typically, individuals will not\neven be aware of the psychodynamics at play. This makes them prone to\n\u201cmass contagion\u201d and \u201cmass suggestion\u201d(Stein\n1922: 201\u2013212[241\u2013261]).\n\nIn sharp contrast to crowds stand the two main \u201ctypes of\nliving-together\u201d (1925: 5[2]): society, with its various forms\nof institutional associations, and community. Both involve what today\nis usually called \u201ccollective intentionality\u201d (Jankovic\n& Ludwig 2017). Though they are not exclusive and typically come\nin \u201cmixed forms\u201d, there are crucial differences between\nthe two: Societal formations are essentially instrumental associations\nof individuals who treat each other \u201cas objects\u201d;\nwhereas, in communities, individuals encounter each other \u201cas\nsubjects\u201d and as \u201cliving with one another\u201d\n(1922: 111[131]; cf. 236\u2013243[283\u2013291]). In associations\nindividuals are bound together by common, but often purely\negoistic, interests and pursue their common goal by way of\n\u201crational\u201d and \u201cmechanistic\u201d planning. In\ncontrast, communities are bound by \u201cthe bond of\nsolidarity\u201d (ibid.). This entails that the members are\n\u201copen\u201d (ge\u00f6ffnet) towards each other and\n\u201clet each other\u2019s attitudes and evaluations penetrate one\nanother and deploy their mutual influence on each other\u201d. Thus,\nsolidarity is not some \u201cstatic\u201d bond but must be\ndynamically maintained (1922: 177\u2013178[194]).\n\nFor Stein, the solidarity required for communal life is\nexperientially grounded. Members of a community can only\nconstitute a true community of solidarity if they are bound together\nby so-called \u201ccommunal experiences\u201d\n(Gemeinschaftserlebnisse), and jointly constitute a so-called\na \u201csupra-individual\u201d (\u00fcberindividuell) or\n\u201ccommunal stream of experiences\u201d (Erlebnisstrom der\nGemeinschaft) (1922: 112\u2013122[133\u2013145]). This stream\nhas its own motivational and psychic-causational laws (1922:\n140\u2013148[167\u2013175]) and its own life-power (1922:\n167\u2013174[201\u2013210]).\n\nCommunities, according to Stein, can share intentions and\nvolitions and jointly perform actions (1922:\n159\u2013163[191\u2013196]). Moreover, communities can also\n\u201cfeel together\u201d, i.e., share emotions. Further,\ncommunities can share values (1922:\n189\u2013191[226\u2013228]) and are \u201cmoved by common\nmotives\u201d (1922: 178[215]). Their members can take\n\u201cevaluative and practical stances\u201d\n(Stellungnahmen) that pertain to the community (1922:\n176\u2013179[211\u2013214], 244[292]). They may even engage in\ncollective practices of imagination (1922:\n126\u2013127[147\u2013148]; cf. Szanto 2017). And they bear, though\nonly in a restricted sense (see below), \u201ccommon\nresponsibility\u201d (1922: 162\u2013163[195]; see Szanto\n2015b). Finally, communities even exhibit certain intellectual\ncapacities and virtues (e.g., having a distinctive esprit)\n(1922: 188\u2013189[225\u2013226]), and indeed, as Stein discusses\nin detail, bear a certain \u201cpersonality\u201d or personal\n\u201ccharacter traits\u201d (1922: 199[238];\n219\u2013221[262\u2013264]; 227\u2013236[272\u2013283]). \n\nFor Stein, then, communities can exhibit the same types of\nintentional experiences that individuals can, and be\nattributed all the same spiritual, axiological, psychic, and indeed\npersonal features. In order to see the full implication of this bold\nclaim, and in particular, the genuinely collective dimension\nof communal experiences, consider the following example:\n\n I empathize or sympathize with your grief for\nyour dead child.\n I (individually/personally) grieve for our child.\n I, as a parent, grieve for our child.\n We, parents, grieve for our child.\n\n\nIn (a), we have an interpersonal relation founded on empathy,\nwith no form of sharing whatsoever (see\n sect. 2.3).\n In (b), there is a shared intentional object, but no shared\nexperience of relating to it. With (c), we are getting closer\nto the phenomenon, but we still only have a shared object and what\nmight be called \u201csocial identification\u201d, whereby an\nindividual\u2019s experience is in some sense affected by the fact\nthat she conceives of herself as a member of a group. \n\nIn Stein\u2019s account, communal experiences are experiences in the\nsense of (d). Stein offers a multi-dimensional account of communal\nexperiences. Following three core aspects of intentional acts, it has\nbecome customary to distinguish content or object,\nsubject and mode accounts of collective\nintentionality (see Schweikard & Schmid 2013). A distinctive\nfeature of Stein\u2019s account is that she refuses to locate the\nseat of sharedness in any of these three dimensions in isolation.\nInstead, she investigates their interconnections. What\u2019s more,\nshe offers an elaboration of the mechanisms responsible for\nconjoining both individual experiences into a communal stream\nand their various interconnections within that stream.\nSpecifically, Stein discusses the distinctively collective nature of\n\n\n supra-individual objects; \n the collective intentional acts directed upon these\nobjects and their sharedness; \n the irreducibly communal content of collective\nexperiences; and \n the nature and mechanisms underlying their integration into a\ncommunal stream of experiences. \n\n\nLet us elaborate these in turn:\n\n(1) Supra-individual objects: The first requirement for\ncollective experiences is fairly straightforward; as Stein puts it,\n\n\n\nthe essence of communal life [lies] precisely in the fact that the\nsubjects are not directed at one another, but jointly turned toward an\nobjectivity (einem Gegenst\u00e4ndlichen zugewendet). (1922:\n225[270]) \n\n\nThis delimits the range of possibly shared experiential states: Only\nexperiences that have intentional objects can be shared.\nConcerning affective experiences, only those that appraise objects,\nevents, etc. with evaluative properties can be shared, viz.\nintentional feelings (e.g., grief, joy, fear, etc.), moods and\nsentiments (e.g., confidence, trust, admiration). Purely sensory\nfeelings (e.g., pain, sensory pleasure or bodily excitement), tied to\nindividuals\u2019 felt body location and lacking extra-bodily\nintentional objects, cannot be shared (1922:\n137\u2013139[163\u2013165]). However, as we will see, communities\ncan indeed be attributed life-feelings and psychic and spiritual\nlife-power of their own.\n\n(2) Collective intentional acts: The second distinctive\nfeature of communal experiences for Stein is what might be called\ndouble-direction of collective intentionality. First, there\nis the ordinary intentional focus upon the shared, supra-individual\nobject. Second, in every communal experience, individual members\ninstantiate an \u201cintention upon the communal experience\u201d\n(Intention auf das Gemeinschaftserlebnis) (1922: 116[137]).\nFor example, when grieving together, my experience is not only about\nor directed upon \u201cour loss\u201d but at the same time on the\nfact that we share the experience of the loss.\n\n(3) Communal content: That individual intentions are jointly\ndirected upon the same object means also that they have a\n\u201ccontent of communal experience\u201d (Gehalt des\nGemeinschaftserlebnisses) (1922: 116[137]): \u201ca unity of\nsense.\u201d (1922: 117[138]). The unitary sense does not\nexclude, however, fine-grained individual variations in the\nexperiential content. All that is required of the individuals is that\ntheir experiences have the same \u201ccore of sense\u201d\n(Sinnkern) (1922: 117[136\u2013137];\n138\u2013139[164\u2013165]). This allows for \u201cmanifold\u201d\nindividual \u201cexperiential coloring\u201d\n(Erlebnisf\u00e4rbung) (1922: 113[134f.], 115[136]). On the\nother hand, individuals\u2019 experiences are just as much colored by\nthe fact that they don\u2019t have the respective experience\nprivately, but precisely as members or \u201cin the name\nof\u201d (1922: 114[134]) the community. This \u201creciprocal\nfeedback\u201d (R\u00fcckwirkung; 1922: 132[157]) or\ncoloring of the personal by the communal can be best understood\ncounterfactually: Individuals would not have the (same) experiences\nthey have if they were not members of a given community, or were there\nno community (at some time or another). And there is a normative\ndimension to this unity: shared intentionality has conditions of\nfulfillment that are determined by what is an appropriate intentional\nresponse, given (a) the specific intentional object and (b) the\nspecific community at stake (see Szanto 2015a):\n\n\nThe intention to realize the communal experience can be fulfilled much\nmore extensively than the intention to do justice to what is demanded\nby the object \u2013for instances in cases where the content of the\ncommunal experience falls considerably short of what is required of\nit. On the other hand, the content of the individual experience can\nvery closely approximate what is required by the supra-individual\nobject, and yet by no means does it need to coincide with the content\nof the communal experience. This can be the case because (\u2026),\nfor example the event in question (\u2026) can be falsely evaluated\nby single members as to its significance for the community. (\u2026)\n[In that case there is] divergence of the individual contents from the\nintended collective content (\u2026). (1922:\n116\u2013117[137\u2013138])\n\n\n(4) Communal stream of experiences: What about the\nsubject of the communal experiences and the notorious\ncommunal stream of experiences into which individual\nmembers\u2019 experiences are embedded? To begin with, notice that\nthe communal stream is founded upon the \u201ccontribution\u201d\nwith which the individual experiences \u201cfurnish\u201d it (1922:\n138[164\u2013165]; see also 119[141], 121\u2013122[143\u2013145]); it\ndoes not exist above and beyond these contributions.\n\u201cContribution\u201d must not be understood as a sort of\nsummative piling-up or aggregation of individual experiences (see also\nKrebs 2020): \u201cthe relation between individual and\ncommunal experiences is constitution, not summation\u201d (1922:\n122[144]). Moreover, Stein warns us not to misunderstand her notion of\n\u201ccommunal subject\u201d (Gemeinschaftssubjekt) as if\nthere were some supra-individual \u201cowner\u201d, or some\n\u201csuper-ego\u201d: \u201ca community-subject, as analogue of\nthe pure ego, does not exist\u201d (ibid.). Similarly, there is\nalways also a plurality of supra-individual\nexperiential streams, which do not unite into one single communal\nstream constituted by some \u201csuper-community\u201d or the entire\ncommunity of all conscious beings. (1922:\n139\u2013140[165\u2013166]).\n\nNow, the supra-individual stream must not be confused with a\ncollective consciousness. For consciousness is a\nconstituting rather than a constituted phenomenon;\nfollowing Husserl, Stein holds that the constituting\nconsciousness\u2014the \u201cultimately constituting stream\u201d\nof experiences (letztkonstituierender Flu\u00df)\u2014is\nessentially egoic, and ipso facto individual in nature (1922:\n118\u2013119[140\u2013141]). Accordingly, the communal stream is as\na constituted stream, constituted by individual\u2019s\n\u201cpure egos\u201d. And yet, in communal experiences, the\nrespective subjects of experience and the \u201cindividual\npersonality\u201d of the members are modified in a certain way and\nimpacted by the very communal experience. In terms of the modified\nsubject of communal experiences, we must assume a certain\n\u201ccollective personality\u201d\n(Gesamtpers\u00f6nlichkeit; 1922: 114[135], see also 227[272]). A\ngood way to understand this claim is by considering the distinction\nbetween the \u201cphenomenal\u201d and the \u201contic\nsubject\u201d of shared experiences (Schmid 2009: 65ff.). While the\nphenomenal subject of the communal stream is a communal one, its ontic\nbearers are the individual members (1922: 114[134]). (This\ncertainly should not imply that Stein holds that all\nconstitution, and in particular the constitution of the shared values\nand objects, or the life-world, is reducible to individual processes.\nQuite the contrary: Like virtually all phenomenologists, Stein\nstresses the importance of intersubjective constitution, which is\naccomplished precisely by communities of individuals acting together; 1922: 139\u2013140[165\u2013166].)\n\nLarge parts of Stein\u2019s treatise are devoted to further\nspecifying the \u201cstructure\u201d of communal experiences (1922:\n112\u2013122[133\u2013145]), the \u201celements\u201d it contains\n(such as imaginations, categorical acts, intentional feelings, etc.)\n(1922: 122\u2013139[145\u2013165]), the mechanisms integrating the\nindividual experiences into the unified communal stream (1922:\n139\u2013147[165\u2013175]; 159\u2013163[191\u2013196]), and\nfinally its own personal, psychic and spiritual life (1922:\n163\u2013199[196\u2013238]) (see also Burns 2015; Caminada 2015).\nRoughly, the communal stream has a temporally structured internal\ncoherence, with its own \u201cassociative\u201d,\n\u201cmotivational\u201d, and \u201ccausal\u201d mechanisms\nconjoining the individual experiences into an experientially coherent\n\u201cintegrate\u201d (1922: 141\u2013147[167\u2013175]).\nExperiences also affect one another by \u201cpsychic\u201d and\n\u201cvolitional causation\u201d (1922:\n159\u2013163[191\u2013196]). Accordingly, the communal stream\nexhibits its own life-feelings as well as psychic and spiritual\nlife-power (1922: 145\u2013147[172\u2013175]; 167\u2013185[201\u2013203]). Communities can be more or less\nproductive, energized, etc., depending on the contribution of the\nlife-power of the participating individuals. In turn, the communal\nlife-power feeds back on the individuals\u2019 life-power (see\nM\u00fcller 2020).\n\nThough the individuals\u2019 mental and psychic life (incl. their\nattitudes, life-power) are variously influenced\u2014and indeed, in\ntheir social identity, or as members of a community\nco-determined\u2014by communal life, their autonomous\n(affective and moral) psychology is never \u201coutflanked\u201d or\n\u201coverridden\u201d (Pettit 1993) by the community (1922:\n234[280], 247[296], 224\u2013227[268\u2013271]). Just as they never\nlose their \u201cindividual distinctiveness\u201d (1922: 226[271]),\nindividuals are never \u201ccleared\u201d of their (moral)\nresponsibility for their individual or communal deeds by the\ncommunity. Communal responsibility for Stein doesn\u2019t simply\n\u201csuspend\u201d individual responsibility (1922:\n162\u2013163[194\u2013196]; 225[269]) Thus, despite occasional\nappearances to the contrary, which may result from misleading notions\nsuch as a \u201ccharacter\u201d, or \u201cpersonality of the\ncommunity\u201d (1922: 227[272]), Stein\u2019s account of community\nsteers clear of any problematic form of collectivism (see Szanto 2015b\nand forthcoming).\n\nIn conclusion, Stein\u2019s account of collective intentionality is\nof continued interest to the contemporary landscape. In particular,\nshe offers a middle-way between the Scylla of methodologically\nindividualist or reductionist accounts and the Charybdis of\ncollectivist or fusional accounts (e.g., Schmid 2014; Krueger 2016) of\nshared experience. At the same time, she specifies different types and\nlayers of experiential sharing, their normative dimension and the\nvarious (intentional, cognitive, affective, etc.) mechanisms\nresponsible for integrating them.\n",
