    "main_text": "Metaphysical theories of consciousness || Physicalist theories\n8.2 Physicalist theories\n\n\nMost other metaphysical theories of consciousness are versions of\nphysicalism of one familiar sort or another.\n\nEliminativist theories reductively deny the existence of\nconsciousness or at least the existence of some of its commonly\naccepted sorts or features. (See the entry on\n eliminative materialism.)\n The radical eliminativists reject the very notion of consciousness as\nmuddled or wrong headed and claim that the conscious/nonconscious\ndistinction fails to cut mental reality at its joints (Wilkes 1984,\n1988). They regard the idea of consciousness as sufficiently off\ntarget to merit elimination and replacement by other concepts and\ndistinctions more reflective of the true nature of mind\n(P. S. Churchland 1983).\n\n\nMost eliminativists are more qualified in their negative assessment.\nRather than rejecting the notion outright, they take issue only with\nsome of the prominent features that it is commonly thought to involve,\nsuch as qualia (Dennett 1990, Carruthers 2000), the conscious self\n(Dennett 1992), or the so called \u201cCartesian Theater\u201d where\nthe temporal sequence of conscious experience gets internally\nprojected (Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992). More modest eliminativists,\nlike Dennett, thus typically combine their qualified denials with a\npositive theory of those aspects of consciousness they take as real,\nsuch as the Multiple Drafts Model (section\n 9.3\n below).\n\nIdentity theory, at least strict psycho-physical type-type\nidentity theory, offers another strongly reductive option by\nidentifying conscious mental properties, states and processes with\nphysical ones, most typically of a neural or neurophysiological\nnature.  If having a qualitative conscious experience of phenomenal\nred just is being in a brain state with the relevant\nneurophysiological properties, then such experiential properties are\nreal but their reality is a straight forwardly physical reality.\n\nType-type identity theory is so called because it identifies\nmental and physical types or properties on a par with identifying the\nproperty of being water with the property of being composed of\nH2O molecules. After a brief period of popularity in the\nearly days of contemporary physicalism during the 1950s and 60s (Place\n1956, Smart 1959) it has been far less widely held because of problems\nsuch as the multiple realization objection according to which mental\nproperties are more abstract and thus capable of being realized by\nmany diverse underlying structural or chemical substrates (Fodor 1974,\nHellman and Thompson 1975). If one and the same conscious property\ncan be realized by different neurophysiological (or even\nnon-neurophysiological) properties in different organisms, then the\ntwo properties can not be strictly identical.\n\n\nNonetheless the type-type identity theory has enjoyed a recent if\nmodest resurgence at least with respect to qualia or qualitative\nconscious properties. This has been in part because treating the\nrelevant psycho-physical link as an identity is thought by some to\noffer a way of dissolving the explanatory gap problem (Hill and\nMcLaughlin 1998, Papineau 1995, 2003). They argue that if the\nconscious qualitative property and the neural property are identical,\nthen there is no need to explain how the latter causes or gives rise\nto the former. It does not cause it, it is it. And\nthus there is no gap to bridge, and no further explanation is needed.\nIdentities are not the sort of thing that can be explained, since\nnothing is identical with anything but itself, and it makes no sense\nto ask why something is identical with itself.\n\n\nHowever, others contend that the appeal to type-type identity does not\nso obviously void the need for explanation (Levine 2001). Even if two\ndescriptions or concepts in fact refer to one and the same property,\none may still reasonably expect some explanation of that convergence,\nsome account of how they pick out one and the same thing despite not\ninitially or intuitively seeming to do so. In other cases of\nempirically discovered property identities, such as that of heat and\nkinetic energy, there is a story to be told that explains the\nco-referential convergence, and it seems fair to expect the same in\nthe psycho-physical case. Thus appealing to type-type identities may\nnot in itself suffice to dissolve the explanatory gap problem.\n\n\nMost physicalist theories of consciousness are neither eliminativist\nnor based on strict type-type identities. They acknowledge the reality\nof consciousness but aim to locate it within the physical world on the\nbasis of some psycho-physical relation short of strict property\nidentity.\n\n\nAmong the common variants are those that take conscious reality to\nsupervene on the physical, be composed of the\nphysical, or be realized by the physical.\n\nFunctionalist theories in particular rely heavily on the\nnotion of realization to explicate the relation between\nconsciousness and the physical. According to functionalism, a state or\nprocess counts as being of a given mental or conscious type in virtue\nof the functional role it plays within a suitably organized system\n(Block 1980a). A given physical state realizes the relevant conscious\nmental type by playing the appropriate role within the larger physical\nsystem that contains it. (See the entry on \n functionalism.)\n The functionalist often appeals to analogies with other inter-level\nrelations, as between the biological and biochemical or the chemical\nand the atomic. In each case properties or facts at one level are\nrealized by complex interactions between items at an underlying\nlevel.\n\n\nCritics of functionalism often deny that consciousness can be\nadequately explicated in functional terms (Block 1980a, 1980b, Levine\n1983, Chalmers 1996). According to such critics, consciousness may have\ninteresting functional characteristics but its nature is not\nessentially functional. Such claims are sometimes supported by appeal\nto the supposed possibility of absent or inverted qualia, i.e., the\npossibility of beings who are functionally equivalent to normal humans\nbut who have reversed qualia or none at all. The status of such\npossibilities is controversial (Shoemaker 1981, Dennett 1990,\nCarruthers 2000), but if accepted they would seem to pose a problem for\nthe functionalist. (See the entry on\n qualia.)\n\n\nThose who ground ontological physicalism on the realization relation\noften combine it with a nonreductive view at the conceptual or\nrepresentational level that stresses the autonomy of the special\nsciences and the distinct modes of description and cognitive access\nthey provide.\n\nNon-reductive physicalism of this sort denies that the\ntheoretical and conceptual resources appropriate and adequate for\ndealing with facts at the level of the underlying substrate or\nrealization level must be adequate as well for dealing with those at\nthe realized level (Putnam 1975, Boyd 1980). As noted above in response\nto the How question, one can believe that all economic facts are\nphysically realized without thinking that the resources of the physical\nsciences provide all the cognitive and conceptual tools we need for\ndoing economics (Fodor 1974).\n\n\nNonreductive physicalism has been challenged for its alleged failure\nto \u201cpay its physicalist dues\u201d in reductive coin. It is\nfaulted for supposedly not giving an adequate account of how conscious\nproperties are or could be realized by underlying neural, physical or\nfunctional structures or processes (Kim 1987, 1998). Indeed it has\nbeen charged with incoherence because of its attempt to combine a\nclaim of physical realization with the denial of the ability to spell\nout that relation in a strict and a priori intelligible way\n(Jackson 2004).\n\n\nHowever, as noted above in discussion of the How question,\nnonreductive physicalists reply by agreeing that some account of\npsycho-physical realization is indeed needed, but adding that the\nrelevant account may fall far short of a priori deducibility,\nyet still suffice to satisfy our legitimate explanatory demands (McGinn\n1991, Van Gulick 1985). The issue remains under debate.\n",
