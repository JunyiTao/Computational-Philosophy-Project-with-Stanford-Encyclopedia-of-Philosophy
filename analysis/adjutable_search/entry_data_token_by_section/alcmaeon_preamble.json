    "main_text": "\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton was an early Greek medical writer and\nphilosopher-scientist. His exact date, his relationship to other early\nGreek philosopher-scientists, and whether he was primarily a medical\nwriter/physician or a typical Presocratic cosmologist, are all matters\nof controversy. He is likely to have written his book sometime between\n500 and 450 BCE. The surviving fragments and testimonia focus\nprimarily on issues of physiology, psychology, and epistemology and\nreveal Alcmaeon to be a thinker of considerable originality. He was\nthe first to identify the brain as the seat of understanding and to\ndistinguish understanding from perception. Alcmaeon thought that the\nsensory organs were connected to the brain by channels\n(poroi) and may have discovered the poroi connecting\nthe eyes to the brain (i.e. the optic nerve) by excising the eyeball\nof an animal, although it is doubtful that he used dissection as a\nstandard method. He was the first to develop an argument for the\nimmortality of the soul. He used a political metaphor to define health\nand disease: The equality (isonomia) of the opposing powers\nwhich make up the body (e.g., the wet, the dry, the hot, the cold, the\nsweet, the bitter etc.) preserves health, whereas the monarchy of any\none of them produces disease. Alcmaeon discussed a wide range of\ntopics in physiology including sleep, death, and the development of\nthe embryo. It is unclear whether he also presented a cosmology in\nterms of opposing powers, but we do have some testimonia concerning\nhis views on astronomy. Alcmaeon had considerable impact on his\nsuccessors in the Greek philosophical tradition. Aristotle wrote a\ntreatise responding to him, Plato may have been influenced by his\nargument for the immortality of the soul, and both Plato and Philolaus\naccepted his view that the brain is the seat of intelligence.\n",
