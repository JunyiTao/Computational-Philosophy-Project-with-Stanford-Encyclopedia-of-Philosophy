The Problem\n\nThree intuitions are at stake in the nonidentity problem. (1) The\nfirst is the person-affecting, or person-based,\nintuition itself. According to that intuition, an act can be\nwrong only if that act makes things worse for, or\n(we can say) harms, some existing or future person. Acts, in\nother words, that maximize wellbeing for each and every\nexisting or future person cannot be wrong. As Parfit put it: the\n\u201cbad\u201d act must be \u201cbad for\u201d someone (Parfit\n1987, 363).\n\n(2) The second intuition is that an act that confers on a person an\nexistence that is, though flawed, worth having in a case in which that\nsame person could never have existed at all in the absence of that\nact does not make things worse for, or harm, and is not\n\u201cbad for,\u201d that person. In other words, conferring the\nexistence that is unavoidably flawed and yet not so flawed\nthat it is less than worth having does not make things worse\nfor, or harm, and is not \u201cbad for,\u201d the person whose\nexistence it is. \n\n(3) The third intuition is what the nonidentity cases themselves seem\nclearly to show: that the existence-inducing acts under scrutiny in\nthe various nonidentity cases are in fact wrong.\n\nAnalogous intuitions similarly collide when our question is whether a\ngiven world is, all things considered, morally worse than another.\n\n\nSince the nonidentity problem became well-known through the work of\nDerek Parfit, James Woodward and Gregory Kavka in the early 1980s,\nmost philosophers have accepted it as showing that at least one of the\naforementioned intuitions must be false. Here, the most frequently\nidentified culprit is intuition (1), that is, the person-based\nintuition. But if that intuition is false, then the question is raised\nwhether morality should be understood to have a structure that is\nimpersonal at least in part. Does moral law, that is, provide\nthat agents on occasion do wrong even though they have at the same\ntime successfully maximized wellbeing for each person who\ndoes or ever will exist?\n\nIf we answer this question in the affirmative, we must of course then\ntake up the challenge of explaining just how acts that make things\nworse for no one can be wrong. Classical utilitarians think we can\nmeet this challenge with ease. They would quickly agree that the\nperson-based intuition is false and could indeed put that fact forward\nto bolster their position that moral law is impersonal in nature and\nthat aggregating wellbeing levels across particular populations at the\nrelevant worlds is exactly the right way to determine whether an act\nis permissible or one world is better than another. Some\nnon-consequentialists might also be happy to accept the result that\nthe person-based intuition is false. They might consider that result\nto support their position that wrongdoing must be grounded in facts\nabout the agent\u2019s character, motives or intentions and not in\nthe consequences the act under scrutiny generates for any particular\nperson. Still other impersonalists \u2013 philosophers, for example,\nwho reject classical utilitarianism (perhaps on the ground that it\nleads to the repugnant conclusion; see the entry on the\n repugnant conclusion)\n but remain compelled by the idea that acts, as opposed to agents, are\nto be evaluated in light of their consequences \u2013 face a more\nserious challenge. They must identify a \u201cTheory X\u201d (Parfit\n1987, 378) that accounts for the wrongdoing within a consequentialist\nframework but does not bring to bear either the principles of\nclassical utilitarianism or any pre-analytic sense we think we have\nthat the choice under scrutiny has made things worse for, or harmed,\nor failed to maximize wellbeing for, the people who have been made to\nsuffer by that wrong choice.\n\nIt is hard to appreciate the importance of the nonidentity problem\nuntil one understands its sweep. It isn\u2019t just close-to-home\nchoices relating to procreation \u2013 for example, the choice to\nconceive a child with one person rather than another \u2013 that seem\nsusceptible to the nonidentity analysis. For that narrow range of\ncases, the exculpatory implication from intuitions (1) and (2) might\nseem perfectly on target and the rejection of intuition (3) at least\nplausible. Thus: was it wrong for my parents to choose to have a child\nwith each other rather than each to have a child with some alternate\npartner who (let\u2019s suppose) would have brought to the table a\nsuperior genetic contribution? We might think that it wasn\u2019t.\nEven if I suffer from being less tall, strong, smart or healthy than\nalternate children my parents could have produced with alternate\npartners in my place, my existence remains worth having. Moreover,\nthere is nothing they or anyone else \u2013 consistent with existing\nmedical and genetic technologies \u2013 could have done to bring\nme into a better existence. If in that case an intuitive,\nperson-based moral theory instructs that no wrong has been done, that\nresult might well seem plausible to us. The case might not, that is,\nstrike us as a convincing counterexample against the person-based\nintuition itself. \n\nIt is when we realize that the exculpatory implication applies not\njust to close-to-home cases of procreative choice but also to a\ndisturbingly large segment of all our future-directed choices\n\u2013 including choices that don\u2019t seem on the face of things\nto have anything to do with whether one person is brought into\nexistence rather than another \u2013 that we begin to appreciate the\nsignificance of the nonidentity problem. In at least some of those\ncases, we are (likely) going to find intuition (3) itself compelling;\nwe are (likely) going to be convinced \u2013 as we shall see \u2013\nthat the choice under scrutiny is clearly wrong. We will then seem\nforced to abandon either intuition (1) or (2). If it\u2019s the\nformer we let go of rather than the latter, then our challenge is to\naccount for the fact that the choice is wrong despite the\nfact that same choice seems to be good for \u2013 indeed\nmaximizing for \u2013 each and every existing and future\nperson. If it\u2019s the latter, then our challenge is to explain how\na choice can make things worse for, or harm, or in some way be\nbad for, a given person despite the fact that\nit is maximizing for that person.\n2. Nonidentity Cases\n\nAs just noted, many nonidentity cases that have been most persuasive\non the point that some bad acts are bad\nfor no existing or future person involve acts that do not on\ntheir face seem to have anything to do with whether one person is\nbrought into existence rather than another. They involve acts, that\nis, to which no particular person seems to \u201cowe\u201d his or\nher \u201cvery existence.\u201d\n\nThat ordinary acts might have such an existence-inducing nature\n\u2013 that the people they bring into flawed existences would not,\nindeed, could not have ever existed at all in the absence of\nthose acts \u2013 is related to the phenomenon Gregory Kavka\ndescribed as the \u201cprecariousness\u201d of existence (Kavka\n1982, 93). We understand that the identity of each person who ever\ncomes into existence \u2013 the coming into existence, that is, of\nany one particular person in place of any nonidentical distinct person\n\u2013 depends, among other things, on just who the genetic parents\nof that person happen to be. As Parfit observes, the woman who wonders\nwho she would have been had her \u201cparents married other\npeople\u201d \u201cignores the answer,\u201d which is \u201cno\none\u201d (Parfit 1987, 351). But it is not just whom one procreates\nwith that determines the identity of one\u2019s offspring. It is also\nwhat Parfit described as the \u201ctiming and manner\u201d of\nconception. When the act of conceiving a child is moved forward or\nbackward in time by months or even moments, or when the manner of\nconception is itself altered (accomplished, e.g., via in vitro\nfertilization rather than coitus), the result, very probably, will be\nthe conception of a distinct child altogether. After all, any\ndifference in timing or manner of conception very probably will place\na distinct inseminating sperm cell (out of hundreds of millions!) in\nproximity to the ovum or even result in a distinct ovum being\ninseminated. And a distinction in sperm and egg cells would seem in\nmost cases sufficient to insure the conception of a distinct child\n(Parfit 1987, 351\u201355; 2011 vol. 2, 217\u2013231). Moreover, the\nexact timing and manner of conception is itself highly susceptible to\nvariations in whatever complex chain of acts and events it is that has\ncome before. Much of what has been done in human history, had it been\ndone differently, would surely have undone the conceptions of vast\nnumbers of people. \u201c[H]ow many of us could truly claim,\n\u2018Even if railways and motor cars had never been invented, I\nwould still have been born\u2019?\u201d (Parfit 1987, 361).\n\nConsider, then, an act A that is performed at a possible\nworld w and yields at w positive but low wellbeing\nlevels for one or more people who will but do not yet exist at\nw. Suppose that wellbeing levels are low in virtue of the\nfact that act A performed at w causes those people\nto endure pain, misery, disease, deprivation or limitation. And\nsuppose that those low wellbeing levels cannot be justified (on the\nground, for example, that they save many existing people from still\nlower wellbeing levels) and that we are accordingly convinced that act\nA is wrong. Kavka\u2019s precariousness-of-existence point\ntells us that in many such cases the very future people \u2013 call\nthem the \u201cA-people\u201d \u2013 who endure low wellbeing\nlevels also \u201cowe their very existence\u201d to that act\nA. Perhaps an act B existed as an alternative for\nthe agents at the time just prior to choice. And perhaps B\nstrikes us as more benign than A in the sense that B\nwould have yielded higher wellbeing levels for whatever future people\nmay happen to have existed had B been performed in place of\nA. The problem is that in many cases \u2013 and it takes\njust one to produce the relevant problem case, the counterexample\nagainst the person-based intuition \u2013 performing B in\nplace of A would also have changed (or very probably would\nhave changed) the timing and manner of the conceptions that take place\nat w. That means that act B would not have made\nthings better for the A-people but rather would have caused the\nA-people \u2013 each and every one of them \u2013 to have (very\nprobably) been left out of existence altogether. The pain, misery and\nso on that A imposes on the A-people is, in other words,\nunavoidable if those particular people are ever to exist at\nall. The same point holds for any other seemingly more benign act as\nwell. Assuming that the A-people are not so miserable that never\nexisting at all would have been better for them than their existence\nin w in fact is, we now find it very hard to see how\nA has harmed, or made things worse for, or been bad\nfor, the A-people in any \u201cmorally relevant way\u201d\n(Parfit 1987, 361\u201363, 374).\n2.1 Depletion\n\nThe phenomenon of the precariousness of existence is nicely\nillustrated in Parfit\u2019s depletion case. Suppose that agents as a\ncommunity have chosen to deplete rather than conserve certain\nresources. The consequences of that choice for the people who exist\nnow or will come into existence over the next two centuries will be\n\u201cslightly\u201d better than under a conservation alternative\n(Parfit 1987, 362; see also Parfit 2011 (vol. 2), 218). Thereafter,\nhowever, for many centuries the quality of life would be much lower.\n\u201cThe great lowering of the quality of life must provide some\nmoral reason not to choose Depletion\u201d (Parfit 1987, 363). Surely\nagents ought to have chosen conservation in some form or another\ninstead. But note that, at the same time, depletion seems to harm\nno one. While distant future people, by hypothesis, will\nsuffer as a result of depletion, it is also true that for each such\nperson a conservation choice (very probably) would have changed the\ntiming and manner of the relevant conception. That change, in turn,\nwould have changed the identities of the people conceived and the\nidentities of the people who eventually exist. Any suffering, then,\nthat people endure under the depletion choice would seem to be\nunavoidable if those people are ever to exist at all. Assuming (here\nand throughout) that existence is worth having, we seem forced to\nconclude that depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and\nis not otherwise \u201cbad for,\u201d anyone at all (Parfit 1987,\n363). At least: depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and\nis not \u201cbad for,\u201d anyone who does or will exist under\nthe depletion choice.\n\nThe risky policy example, also from Parfit, has a similar structure\n(Parfit 1987, 371\u201372). So does the example of climate change.\nParfit 2017, pp. 122\u2013123. See also Broome 1992.\n2.2 The slave child\n\nWe see the same kind of argument but at a less global and more local\nlevel in Kavka\u2019s slave child case. In exchange for $50,000, a\ncouple enters into a binding, enforceable contract with a wealthy man\naccording to which the couple will conceive and bear a child who will\nbe transferred at birth to the wealthy man as a slave (Kavka 1982,\n100). The child is conceived and born pursuant to the contract \u2013\nand, as a slave, suffers in various ways. We think what the couple has\ndone is \u201coutrageous\u201d (Kavka 1982, 101). And we think that\nis so because of what the couple\u2019s choice does to the slave\nchild. But can the latter view be correct? Does the couple\u2019s\nchoice truly make things worse for, or harm, the\nslave child? Is there anything else the couple could have done instead\nthat would have made things better for that particular child? The\ncouple certainly had alternatives. They could have not entered into\nthe contract and not taken steps to produce a child, and they\ncould have not entered into the contract and still taken steps to\nproduce a child. The former alternative, of course, would not have\nbeen better for the slave child. (We are still assuming that the\nexistence is itself worth having.) But nor is the latter. For, had the\ncouple produced a child but not under contract, the timing and\nconditions of conception would then (very probably) have changed and\nany better off child the couple might then have produced would (very\nprobably) have been a distinct child, nonidentical to the slave child\n(Kavka 1982, 100 n. 15). The slave child, in other words, has no\nbetter alternative than what he or she has in fact been given as a\nslave. Once we appreciate that fact, it becomes hard to see how what\nthe couple has done harms, or makes things worse for, or is otherwise\n\u201cbad for,\u201d the child. Kavka\u2019s \u201cpleasure\npill\u201d case parallels the slave child case (Kavka 1982, 98).\n2.3 The 14-year-old girl\n\nAnother classic case from Parfit focuses on the simple fact that the\negg cell a young girl will produce soon after she becomes capable of\nconceiving a child will not be the same egg cell as the one she will\nproduce a decade or more later. \u201cThis girl chooses to have a\nchild\u201d (Parfit 1987, 358). We think that it would have been\nbetter for the girl to wait \u201cfor several years\u201d to have a\nchild and that, barring exceptional circumstances, what the girl has\nin fact done is wrong (Parfit 1987, 358). We also think that the\nreason her choice is wrong is that it causes the child the girl bears\nto be given a \u201cbad start in life\u201d (Parfit 1987, 358). On\ncloser inspection, however, we see that that particular child\ncould not have existed at all had the girl waited until she was older\nto have a child. Given that the child\u2019s life is worth living\n\u2013 given, that is, that it would not have been better for the\nchild that he or she never have existed at all \u2013 it seems that\nthe child has not been harmed, or made worse off, by what the girl has\ndone, and that there exists no plausible basis for the position that\nher act is \u201cbad for\u201d the child.\n\nSince Parfit first described the 14-year-old girl case, reproductive\ntechnologies have advanced. The option of cryopreserving gametes or\nnewly formed human embryos now means that there is at least a\ntheoretical possibility that the 14-year-old girl really could have\nproduced the same child \u2013 or at least a child from the same\ngametes \u2013 many years later. Even so, the probabilities of the\nsituation would need to be taken into account. Changing the manner of\nconception \u2013 moving, that is, from coitus to in vitro\nfertilization \u2013 would have surely meant that very\nprobably it would have been a nonidentical (if better off) child\nwho would have been conceived in place of the one. \n2.4 Wrongful life\n\nIn any case, not all things are possible in the world of new\ntechnologies. Consider, e.g., the legal claim in negligence referred\nto as wrongful life. The claim there is that medical\npersonnel either (1) have failed properly to advise couples of their\nrisk of producing a child with a serious genetic or chromosomal\ndisorder or of the availability of technologies that would have\nenabled them to reduce that risk or (2) have failed to implement those\ntechnologies effectively. The disorders at issue include Down\nsyndrome, Huntington\u2019s disease and hereditary deafness, and the\nrelevant technologies include preconception genetic testing, in vitro\nfertilization followed by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and\namniocentesis, which can now be performed as early as the 14th week of\npregnancy. Technologies are not yet so advanced that their proper use\nwould have cured the underlying impairment. But their use would have\nenabled the couple to produce either no child at all or a\nnonidentical, if (arguably) better off, child instead. At the same\ntime, it seems clear that, in almost all such cases, the impaired\nchild\u2019s life will be (or, at least, can be made to be)\nunambiguously worth living. It is thus very hard to say in such cases\nhow the negligent act or omission, the act or omission to which the\nchild owes his or her very existence, has harmed, or made things worse\nfor, or otherwise been \u201cbad for,\u201d the child. \n\nThe question wrongful life raises in the law is whether a gynecologist\nor obstetrician who has failed to communicate the advisability of\ngenetic testing, or the lab that has negligently generated a falsely\nreassuring test result, can be held liable to the impaired child under\na claim of negligence. In the absence of the negligent act or\nomission, that particular child would never have existed at all. Yet\nin most cases the child\u2019s life is unambiguously worth living. We\nthus seem forced to say that the negligent act has not harmed\nthe child. Harm \u2013 in the intuitive, comparative, worse off sense\nof that term \u2013 being an essential element of any claim in\nnegligence, it also seems that the child\u2019s action against the\ndoctor or lab should be dismissed as legally invalid. Yet we may well\nthink that the tort law system should be construed as a way of\nincentivizing medical personnel to work to insure that the children\nwhom their efforts help to produce are born free of impairment. And we\nmay also think that the parents\u2019 claim \u2013 called\nwrongful birth \u2013 against those same medical personnel\nfor the additional expense of caring for an impaired child is not an\nadequate incentive \u2013 especially in light of statutes of\nlimitation that cut off the parents\u2019 claim (in contrast to the\nchild\u2019s) soon after the child is born. Legally, then, we face a\ndilemma \u2013 a case where the law of negligence should be\nunderstood as insisting that medical personnel be vigilant in advising\nand conducting genetic testing but where, thanks to the logic of the\nnonidentity problem, those same personnel are in a position to\nunderstand in advance that any negligence on their part cannot\nharm their most plausible victims. \n\nParfit\u2019s \u201ctwo medical programs\u201d case \u2013 more\nprecisely, the program that would encourage women who have a certain\ncondition that \u201ccannot be treated, but always disappears within\ntwo months,\u201d to delay pregnancy \u2013 is structurally similar\nto the wrongful life case (Parfit 1987, 367\u2013368; see also Parfit\n2011 vol. 2, 221\u2013222, and Parfit 2017, 121). In both cases, the\nexistence is worth having, and in both cases the impairment is not the\nkind of thing agents can, given existing technologies, either cure or\nameliorate.\n2.5 Historic injustices\n\nThe nonidentity problem raises the issue of whether historic\ninjustices can properly be said to harm, or make things worse for,\npeople who exist today (Sher 2005; Herstein 2008; Cohen 2009;\nSmilansky 2013). According to the nonidentity problem, historic\ninjustices \u2013 including, e.g., U.S. slavery and the Holocaust\n\u2013 lead to the very existence of many of the people whom\nthey have also caused to suffer in various ways. People conceived well\nafter the events themselves take place are thus not, according to the\nnonidentity problem, victims of those events at all, but rather, if\nanything, their beneficiaries. \u201c[H]ow can any person have a\nclaim to compensation for a wrong that was a condition of her\nexistence?\u201d (Cohen 2009, 81) If we think that the taking of\nfunds from presumptively innocent existing and future people so that\nthose funds can be paid in compensation for historic injustices to\nstill other existing or future people can be justified only to the\nextent that those other people really are victims \u2013\nreally have been harmed or damaged or made worse off \u2013 then we\nseem forced to conclude that such takings cannot themselves be\njustified. (See also the entry on \n  intergenerational justice.)\n3. Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem\n3.1 Seemingly wrong act is not wrong; \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d\n\nSome philosophers have understood the exculpatory implication of the\nnonidentity analysis \u2013 and specifically the application of\nintuitions (1) and (2) \u2013 to form the basis of a perfectly good\nargument in favor of an interesting conclusion we should just accept:\nthat intuition (3) is false and that the acts under scrutiny are not\nafter all morally wrong.\n\nAs before, an assumption of the argument is that the existences under\nconsideration are worth having. We should understand, however, that at\nleast in theory a particular existence can be less than worth\nhaving: a child will be brought into existence who is made so\nmiserable (as a result, e.g., of a genetic impairment) that we want to\nsay that it is wrong, and makes things worse, to bring that child into\nexistence to begin with. In such cases, some philosophers hold fast to\nintuition (3) and others don\u2019t. David Heyd thus maintains that\nthe acts under scrutiny are not wrong. According to Heyd, comparisons\nbetween the wellbeing level a given person has at a world at which\nthat person exists and the wellbeing level that same person has at a\nworld where that person never exists are not cogent and hence we are\nforced (given intuitions (1) and (2)) to conclude that no wrong has\nbeen done (Heyd, 2009; Heyd 1992, 30\u201333). Philosophers who\nthink, however, that such comparisons can cogently be made \u2013 who\naccept, we can say, Existence Comparability \u2013 remain\nfree to limit their \u201cbite the bullet\u201d conclusion to the\ncase where the existence is worth having. Thus, David Boonin is, for\nexample, at least neutral on Existence Comparability. That is, he\ndoesn\u2019t reject the view that we can isolate and set aside those\ncases in which \u201clife [is] worse than no life at all\u201d\n(Boonin 2008, 130 and 135; Boonin 2014; see also Bayne 2010).\nMoreover, Boonin implicitly limits his own \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d strategy to cases in which the life is worth\nliving. Only in those cases does he press the point that the acts\nunder scrutiny are not morally wrong. \n\nIn those cases, moreover, Boonin thinks we can reach a stronger\nconclusion than Heyd does. Thus Heyd is willing to say that the acts\nunder scrutiny are not morally wrong but not to say that\nthose same acts are morally permissible. Heyd\u2019s view is\nthat we aren\u2019t in a position to evaluate them at all \u2013\nthat they fall into the category of the genethical rather\nthan the straightforwardly ethical. Boonin, in contrast, thinks we can\nevaluate them. And, given, again, that we are in a case in which the\nexistence is worth having, he thinks we can evaluate them as morally\npermissible (Boonin 2008, 146\u2013149; Boonin 2014).\n\nOne other note on Heyd\u2019s approach is in order. At least some of\nHeyd\u2019s language suggests that he accepts a certain principle\nthat, to be sure, implies intuition (2) but also goes well beyond that\nintuition. According to that principle, the \u201cno harm done\u201d\nresult is in order, not just in the case where the flawed existence is\nunavoidable if the person is ever to exist at all and where,\nin that strong sense, the person\u2019s coming into existence\n\u201cdepends on\u201d the act under scrutiny being performed, but\nalso in the case where agents simply retain \u201ccontrol\u201d over\nwhether that person comes into existence or not (Heyd 1992, 105 and,\ngenerally, 99\u2013106; Heyd 2009, 15\u201317). According to that\nprinciple, even if the couple has the alternative of bringing the same\nchild into a better existence \u2013 even if the existence is not\nunavoidably flawed \u2013 if the couple also has the\nalternative of not bringing the child into existence at all,\nthe act under scrutiny cannot harm, or make things worse for, the\nchild. The idea here would be that, until we actually produce them,\n\u201cwe might decide not to make them the subject of any kind of\nmoral status whatsoever\u201d \u2013 a situation that leaves them,\neven if they are in fact on their way into existence, with\n\u201cno moral status of any kind, not even a weak one,\u201d\nrelative to the act under scrutiny (Heyd 1992, 99). \n\nNot surprisingly, and even in the case of Boonin\u2019s less extreme version, the \u201cbite the bullet\u201d strategy has\nencountered substantial resistance. See, e.g., Parfit 2017, pp.\n126\u2013129. If forced to choose between the person-based intuition\nand the concrete moral judgment that what the agents have done in the\ndepletion case or slave child case is wrong, we may well opt for the\nconcrete moral judgment. Among other things, it seems implausible that\nour future-directed conduct should get a free moral pass whenever it\naffects the timing and manner of conception. So much affects the\ntiming and manner of conception! Even given the assumption that the\nexistences we are dealing with are worth having, it seems implausible\nthat such acts are always morally permissible.\n\nOf course, as Heyd notes, in many cases an act that creates a low\nwellbeing level for a person whose existence depends on that\nact will also create low wellbeing levels for people whose existences\nare independent of that act. If an agent buries glass in the\nwood prior to conceiving a child, then even if that act affects the\ntiming and manner of conception and thus (according to the logic of\nthe nonidentity analysis) would not make things worse for the\nagent\u2019s own child, that act might still make things worse for a\nneighbor\u2019s child. On that ground, the act can be\ndeclared wrong (Heyd 1992, 193\u2013203). The choice of wrongful\nlife, as well, can have deleterious effects on people other than the\nimpaired child \u2013 burdens, in other words, that the impaired\nchild itself will then be required to share (Roberts 2009a).\n\nIn fact, Parfit himself points out that the 14-year-old girl\u2019s\nchoice to have a child has \u201ceffects on other people\u201d\nbesides the girl\u2019s child (Parfit, 1987, 361). However, as Parfit\nalso points out, the problem arises in a \u201cpurer form,\u201d\ne.g., the depletion example (Parfit, 1987, 361). As Heyd himself is\nfully aware, the \u201charm to others\u201d response isn\u2019t\navailable in all of the nonidentity cases.\n\nBoonin offers another suggestion for making the \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d strategy plausible. According to Boonin, our intuition\nthat the acts under scrutiny \u2013 in, e.g., the depletion case and\nthe slave child case \u2013 are wrong is itself rooted in the fact\nthat we have a hard time keeping \u201cpresent before our\nmind\u2019s eye\u201d what makes the nonidentity cases\n\u201catypical\u201d and \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d \u2013 namely,\nthat in the nonidentity cases low wellbeing levels do not correlate in\nthe usual way or the way we have come to expect to a person\u2019s\nhaving been made worse off (Boonin 2008, 146\u2013149; Boonin 2014).\nWe then confuse the atypical case with the ordinary case in which low\nwellbeing levels do signify a person\u2019s having been made\nworse off. We then, mistakenly, see wrongdoing not just in the\nordinary case but in the atypical case as well. Once we appreciate\nthat confusion, we should find ourselves more comfortable abandoning\nthe view that a wrong has been done in the atypical case.\n\nBoonin\u2019s theory is, however, hard to test, especially since we\n\u2013 post-Parfit \u2013 at least feel that we always have\nthe relevant distinction clearly in mind but continue to consider the\ndepletion choice wrong. \n3.2 Act is wrong without making things worse for any existing or future person; impersonal wrongdoing\n\nThis proposal accepts the standard nonidentity cases as\ncounterexamples to the person-based intuition. Thus, it rejects the\nperson-based intuition itself, that is, intuition (1); it has no need\nfor but doesn\u2019t necessarily reject the \u201cno harm\ndone\u201d test provided in intuition (2); and it accepts intuition\n(3), according to which the choices under scrutiny are indeed wrong.\nHaving rejected intuition (1), however, this proposal can then succeed\nonly if combined with a plausible account of just how an act\ncan be wrong even though it makes things worse for no existing or\nfuture person. Several such impersonal accounts have been\nproposed.\n3.2.1 Traditional utilitarianism\n\nTraditional forms of utilitarianism, including both the total form\n(\u201ctotalism\u201d) and the average form\n(\u201caveragism\u201d), have the resources to explain how an act\ncan be wrong while making things worse for no existing or future\nperson. If, by waiting a few years to have a child, the 14-year-girl\ncould have produced a child who is better off but nonidentical to the\nchild the girl in fact produced, both totalism and averagism will\nimply (other things being equal) that what the girl has done is wrong\n(Singer 2011, 107\u2013119). The key for both views is the position\nthat a world\u2019s value, and, indirectly, the permissibility of the\nchoice that brings about that world, is to be determined on an\naggregate basis: utilities correlating to the individual\nwellbeing levels for each person who does or will exist at a given\nworld are simply added up to determine the value of that world. On\nsuch an approach, it is immaterial whether we create additional\n(average or total) wellbeing (a) by creating additional wellbeing for\na particular existing or future person or (b) by bringing a\nnonidentical but better off person into existence. (See the entry on\n consequentialism.)\n\nThe nonidentity problem seems to show, as Parfit notes, that the moral\nprinciple we seek \u2013 the \u201cTheory X\u201d \u2013\n\u201cwill not take a person-affecting form\u201d (Parfit 1987,\n378). The obvious alternative is a theory that is impersonal at least\nin part. Both totalism and averagism fit that description. The\ndifficulty is that both views raise still other problems. Totalism can\neasily explain how an act that makes things worse for no existing or\nfuture person can be wrong. But it immediately generates\u2013 for\nexample \u2013 the repugnant conclusion (Parfit 1987,\n381\u201390; see also\n repugnant conclusion).\n Averagism does a good job with the nonidentity problem and the\nrepugnant conclusion but implausibly seems to prohibit bringing an\nadditional happier-than-average child into existence if it so happens\nthat prior generations have had especially wonderful lives (Parfit\n1987, 420; Feldman 1995, 192\u201393). It also generates problematic results when applied to the case Temkin calls \u201cHell Three\u201d (Temkin 2012, 319\u2013320). Surely, a situation that is hellish for everyone who exists is not improved by the addition of still more people whose lives aren\u2019t quite so hellish but still far less than worth living. Totalism and averagism, moreover, face objections based on\nconsiderations of justice, fairness and equality. Fashioning a cogent\nresponse to the nonidentity problem that does not create at least as\nmany problems as it solves has thus emerged as a critical challenge in\npopulation ethics.\n3.2.2 Impersonal pluralism; substitutional consequentialism; radical pluralism; critical level utilitarianism; sufficientarianism\n\nIn response to objections, some consequentialists have proposed that\nwhat makes a world better or an act permissible is determined by\nreference to the all things considered good, where the all\nthings considered good is a matter both of how much aggregate\nwellbeing a world contains and the extent to which that world realizes\nstill other ideals or values, including, for example, fairness,\ndesert, equality, human flourishing and the prioritization of the\nneeds of the least well-off (Temkin 1993, 221\u201327). An alternate\napproach retains additivity for the purpose of determining a world\u2019s\noverall value but also notes that we might understand what is to be\nadded up as indicated not by individual wellbeing levels but rather by\nthose levels adjusted in some way to reflect values beyond how well\noff a person is in a given world. See Broome 2015, Broome 1991 and\nFeldman 1997. Both sorts of approaches seem able to provide a\nplausible response to the nonidentity problem. But they also may have\nthe ability to avoid the repugnant conclusion \u2013 to explain, for\nexample, by reference to the ideal of human flourishing (Temkin) or\nthe concept of desert (Feldman) how it can be morally better to\nproduce a smaller number of extremely well off individuals rather than\na very large number of people whose lives are only barely worth\nliving.\n\nStill other philosophers have suggested principles that require agents\nto create additional wellbeing, including, when necessary, by bringing\na better off person into existence in place of a nonidentical less\nwell off person, but limit that obligation to the case where agents\ncan substitute in the better off person for the less well off\nperson on a one-to-one basis. Such principles aim to address the nonidentity\nproblem without giving rise to the repugnant conclusion. Holtug\n2009; Holtug 2010, 160\u2013162; see also Parfit 1987, 369\u201371\n(discussion of Principle Q); Peters 2004, 27\u201339 (concept of\ninjury by failure to substitute); and Savulescu 2001 (principle of\nprocreative beneficence).\n\nSome more radical forms of pluralism incorporate both person-based and\nimpersonal elements. The impersonal elements of such an approach may\nthemselves take either an aggregative or a substitutional form. Thus:\nconsider whether a couple ought to produce a third child, a child who\nwould be very happy if he or she were to exist but whose coming into\nexistence would create significant burdens for that child\u2019s two\nalready-existing siblings. Then, we might say that the goal of\nmaximizing wellbeing in the aggregate provides the couple\nwith a reason to have the third child while the person-based\ngoal of avoiding burdens on behalf of the two siblings provides the\ncouple with a reason not to have the third child. What the\ncouple ought to do is then determined by how these opposing reasons\nbalance against one another (McMahan 2006; 2009).\n\nIn contrast, Buchanan, et al., favor putting the person-based approach\ntogether with a substitutional form of pluralism. On their\nview, many of our obligations are person-based in nature, including\nthe obligation to avoid making a particular person worse off or\ncausing that person to suffer a \u201cserious loss of happiness or\ngood\u201d when the agent can do so without imposing\n\u201csubstantial burdens\u201d on others. This is their\n\u201cPrinciple M\u201d (Buchanan, et al. 2000, 226). In some cases,\nhowever, we have obligations that go beyond Principle M. It is here\nthat their impersonal \u201cPrinciple N\u201d is triggered,\nprohibiting agents from letting their dependents \u2013 including\ntheir children \u2013 \u201cexperience serious suffering or limited\nopportunity or serious loss of happiness or good\u201d if \u201cthey\ncan act \u2026 without affecting the number of persons who will\nexist and without imposing substantial burdens \u2026 on themselves\nor others \u2026\u201d (Buchanan, et al. 2000, 249).\n\nThe need to address not just the nonidentity problem but the full\nrange of population problems leads Temkin as well to recognize\nimpersonal as well as person-based values. Finding that terminology\nitself unenlightening, Temkin describes what he calls the internal\naspects view of when one world, or outcome, is morally better\nthan another as well as what he calls the essentially comparative\nview (Temkin 2012, 363\u2013456). We take for granted that our\nultimate goal is to evaluate a given world for its moral betterness\nagainst other worlds. But on the internal aspects view the good of\nthat one world as compared against a second world can be discerned\nwithout consideration of what is going on in still other\nworlds. Totalism is a paradigm instance of the internal aspects view\n(though not a view Temkin, given his emphasis on equality, human\nflourishing and other values, himself endorses). In contrast, on the\nessentially comparative view we cannot complete the evaluation of one\nworld against another in the absence of a potentially extensive\ninter-world comparison. Moreover, we find that when we engage in such\nan extensive comparison it is the person-based features of\nthose worlds that bear most clearly on our evaluation. Thus, suppose\nthat the only (potentially morally relevant) difference between two\nworlds is the addition to the second world of a single person whose\nexistence is worth having.  On the essentially comparative view, that\nsecond world may nonetheless turn out to be morally worse than the\nfirst, if that same person exists in a third world and there has a\nstill better existence (Temkin 2012, 364\u2013400).\n\nWith reference to Temkin, Parfit himself proposed a closer look at\nwhat he called the Wide Dual Person-Affecting Principle: \u201cOne of\ntwo outcomes would be in one way better if this outcome would together\nbenefit people more, and in another way better if this outcome would\nbenefit each person more.\u201d Parfit 2017, 154. According to\nParfit, \u201cthis Wide Principle would be only one of our\nbeliefs.\u201d Parfit 2017, 157. It is not, on its own, the\n\u201cTheory X\u201d Parfit urged us to seek decades ago. Parfit\n1987, 378. But it, like other forms of pluralism (radical or not),\nfaces an important challenge. Pluralistic theories have ample\nresources for generating what many philosophers will consider\nplausible accounts of (for example) both the nonidentity\nproblem and the repugnant conclusion. The problem is going to\nbe one of containment. The theories are too rich, and we don\u2019t\nyet know by what principle the particular view can be stopped from\ngenerating what we consider to be implausible accounts of the\nproblem cases as well. Indefinite and difficult to test, however, as\nsuch theories may be, they nonetheless offer an outline of an approach\nthat may have more promise than the alternatives for ultimately\nproviding a plausible analyses of the full range of population\nproblems.\n\nBoth a critical level form of utilitarianism (Broome 2014)\nand, alternatively, a sufficientarian approach (Huseby 2010)\nhave elements in common with pluralism yet may seem to balance values\nagainst one another in a more transparent way. Both views seem to\nprovide solutions to the nonidentity problem without generating the\nmost extreme forms of the repugnant conclusion. A difficulty for the\nformer view is that it generates the result that a world where many\npeople have lives below the critical level but still worth living is\nworse than a world where many people have lives far worse than a life\nworth living (Arrhenius calls this the \u201csadistic conclusion\u201d; see Arrhenius 2000). An obstacle for the latter position is\nthat it fails to explain why things are morally worse \u2013 and,\nindirectly why an act is wrong \u2013 in a case where the future\nperson who is the subject of our concern has a \u201cgood life\u201d\n(Huseby 2010, 205) but still seems clearly to be a victim of a prior\nact we consider clearly wrong. Consider, e.g., a child who has a good\nlife but who has been made to be blind as a result of an act\nperformed by the child\u2019s parents prior to conception. And\nsuppose that the parents themselves tethered their choice to produce a\nchild to their choice to produce a child they have blinded in that\nway; suppose that is, that the child would not have existed,\nor at least probably would not have existed, had the parents not\nperformed the act under scrutiny. We may well consider the act under\nscrutiny wrong. But a sufficientarian approach seems to block that\nresult.\n3.3 Act wrongs, or harms, or is bad for, person without making person worse off\n\nSome philosophers who accept that the acts under scrutiny in the\nstandard nonidentity cases are wrong still urge that our best account\nof just why those acts are wrong will take a person-based form. They,\nin other words, accept intuition (3). Moreover, they accept what they\nconsider to be the heart of the person-based intuition itself. They\naccept, in other words, a weakened form of intuition (1), one\nthat ties wrongdoing in a general way to what has been done to a\nparticular person without requiring that the act under scrutiny\nmake an existing or future person worse off or harm\nthat person (in an intuitive, comparative sense of that term).\nConforming changes are then made to intuition (2), which is rejected\nas false.\n\nThe positions noted in this part 3.3 are reminiscent of an idea that\nKavka explores. According to that idea, even if the acts under\nscrutiny do not make things worse for, or harm (in the intuitive,\ncomparative sense of that term), the child, they may nonetheless\nconstitute instances in which the agent acts (by creating a less\n\u201cintrinsically desirable,\u201d or \u201crestricted,\u201d\nlife) \u201cwrongly toward\u201d the child (Kavka, 1982, 97 and\n104\u2013105) and thus acts wrongly.\n3.3.1 Wronging without harming; rights-based account; exploitation account\n\nThus, one suggestion has been that what makes the act under scrutiny\nwrong is that it violates the apparent victim\u2019s right\nagainst being brought into a flawed existence (Woodward 1986;\nElliot 1989; Elliot 1997; Smolkin 1999; Velleman 2008; Cohen 2009).\nConsider, for example, the slave child case. The nonidentity analysis\nhas it that the couple\u2019s entering into the slave child contract\ndoes not make things worse for the child since (very probably) that\nparticular child would never have existed at all in the absence of\nthat act. Yet we may agree that everyone has a right not to be made,\nor born, a slave. The couple\u2019s entering into the slave child\ncontract and then proceeding to have a child under that contract thus\nviolates the child\u2019s right. On that basis, we can then say that\nthe couple\u2019s act is itself wrong.\n\nSimilarly, the ticket agent who refuses to sell an airline ticket to\nSmith on the basis of Smith\u2019s race violates Smith\u2019s right\nagainst racial discrimination even in the case where the plane\nsubsequently \u201ccrashes, killing all aboard\u201d (Woodward 1986,\n810\u201311, citing Adams). \u201cWhat makes racial discrimination\nwrong is that it is unfair and that it stigmatizes \u2026 and an\naction may have this character \u2013 and be wrong for this reason\n\u2013 regardless of how it affects [a person\u2019s] other\ninterests\u201d (Woodward 1986, 811). \n\nWe thus explain \u2013 and explain in person-based terms \u2013 how\nan act can be wrong even though it makes things worse for no\nexisting or future person.\n\nWoodward goes so far as to say that the act that brings a person into\na flawed existence and thereby violates that person\u2019s right\n\u201charms\u201d that person under what he calls a\n\u201cnonconsequentialist approach\u201d to harm (Woodward 1986,\n818). It might be objected, however, that that use of the term\nharm seems particularly artificial. Moreover, having\nestablished that the right has been violated, it is unclear why \u2013\nto establish wrongdoing \u2013 we would need to show harm as well.\n\n\nThe rights-based account does not require that we compile a defined\nlist of rights. We might take the more general view that each person\nhas a right to be created with \u201cdue consideration for his or her\nhumanity\u201d; we can understand that life itself is a\n\u201cpredicament\u201d for which one\u2019s children need to be\nwell-equipped (Velleman 2008, 266 and 276). A \u201cchild has a right\nto be born into good enough circumstances, and being born to [e.g.] a\nfourteen-year-old mother isn\u2019t good enough\u201d (Velleman\n2008, 275). That a child was \u201cglad to be born\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t mean that that child has waived \u201chis\nbirthright\u201d (Velleman 2008, 277). If we find this unclear, we\nmight alternatively take the position that it is wrong to bring a\nchild into existence when many of his or her rights as outlined in,\ne.g., the United Nations Convention, would be violated (Archard 2004,\n403\u201320). Still another approach argues that future people come\ninto existence with certain \u201cclaim rights,\u201d or simply\n\u201cclaims\u201d (Meyer 2016, 49) that can be defined in part in\neither sufficientarian (Meyer and Roser 2009) or egalitarian (Meyer\n2016, 52\u201358) terms. Agents who fail to respect those claims fail\nto discharge a \u201cduty\u201d they owe \u201cto the person who\nhas the claim\u201d (Meyer 2016, 49).\n\nRights-based and claim-based solutions to the nonidentity problem face\ncertain challenges. The first, from Parfit, is that it is questionable\nwhether an act an individual would not \u201cregret\u201d and would\neven applaud can violate a right or constitute a failure to discharge\na duty. If it can, surely it does so only in some formal way but not\nin a way that is sufficient to show that the act is morally wrong.\nWhen respect for the right or claim can be seen in advance not to\npromote the interests of the rights-holder in any way, the better view\nmight be that the right has been implicitly \u201cwaived\u201d or\nthe violation implicitly consented to (Parfit 1987, 364\u201365 and\n373\u201374). Similarly, the right or claim against bodily injury may\nbe considered waived, or the violation consented to, when one arrives\nat the hospital unconscious and in immediate need of open heart\nsurgery. We don\u2019t think that whatever formal rights violation\nthere may have been in such a case supports the inference that what\nthe surgeon has done is morally \u2013 or indeed legally \u2013\nwrong.\n\nThe second objection asks whether a rights-based or claims-based\napproach proves too much. Consider the case where a couple is enslaved\nand has no means of escaping that status. Any child that the couple\nwill produce is thus sure to be born a slave. If producing a child in\nthe original slave child case is wrong in virtue of the fact that it\nviolates the child\u2019s right or constitutes a failure to discharge\na duty owed to the child, it seems that producing a child in the\nrevised slave child case must be wrong as well. But the evaluation in\nthat latter case is surely implausible. While a right may have been\nviolated or a claim disregarded, it remains unclear that a wrong has\nbeen done. \n\nAn alternate account that has features in common with the rights-based\napproach but that, by focusing more closely on the question of whether\nfuture people have been \u2018unfair[ly]\u2019 treated as compared\nagainst existing people and thus \u201cwrongfully\nexploited\u201d (emphasis added), goes some distance in avoiding both\nobjections. Liberto 2014, 76\u201381. See also Kavka 1981, 106\u2013109. The\nidea is that, in cases where the exploitation is established as itself\nwrongful, the first objection, based on waiver, fails. The same idea\nprovides a defense against the second objection. When the enslaved\ncouple produce a child who is sure to be born a slave, there seems to\nbe no basis on which to claim that the couple has wrongfully\nexploited the child. (The broader community, of course, would\nremain liable.) A question for the view is whether it can be extended\nto address instances of the nonidentity problem in which it seems\nclear that a wrong has been done but future people aren\u2019t\ntreated unfairly as compared against existing people. Thus forms of\ndepletion, e.g, may still be considered wrong and to make things worse\neven if existing people gain nothing and even if \u2013 due to\ntechnological developments \u2013 future people are substantially\nbetter off than are existing people. \n\nA third objection focuses more narrowly on the rights-based approach.\nAccording to that objection, if the child has the right not\nto be brought into an existence of a certain sort, it is plausible\nthat the child\u2019s parents have various rights as well.\nThus, the couple who opts to produce a child with Huntington\u2019s\ndisease or hereditary deafness in place of a relatively unimpaired\nchild may be simply exercising their right of procreative liberty.\nThey may, that is, be using their gametes and their labor, as a matter\nof right, in a way that suits them. We quickly see that the\noffspring\u2019s rights and the couple\u2019s rights cannot both be\nrespected \u2013 a fact that raises the concern that the underlying\naccount of rights may be inconsistent (Persson 2009).\n3.3.2 Harming without making person worse off; non-comparative harm; list account of harm; threshold account of harm\n\nThe preceding discussion takes for granted that an intuitive account\nof harm will be comparative in nature. On such an account, an act\nharms a person only if that act makes that person worse\noff than he or she would have been under an alternative act; a\nperson p is not harmed at a given world w unless there\nexists some alternate world w\u2032 such that p has\nmore wellbeing at w\u2032 than p has at w; an\nact that maximizes wellbeing for a person at a world w\ncannot harm that person at w. At least: it cannot do so in any\n\u201cmorally relevant sense\u201d (Parfit 1987, 374). \n\nSome philosophers have suggested that we also have \u2013 or can\nconstruct \u2013 a second morally relevant concept of harm, one that\nis non-comparative in nature. Though narrower in some ways\nthan the comparative concept, in others the non-comparative concept is\nbroader. Specifically, it can count bringing a person into a flawed\nexistence, even in the case where there is no better existence to be\nhad for that person, as harming that person. Having\nestablished that the act under scrutiny harms the person it both\nbrings into existence and causes to suffer, we can then give an\naccount \u2013 a person-based account; an account that\nretains, not the original person-based intuition (1), but rather a\nweakened version of that intuition \u2013 of why that act is\nwrong.\n\nShiffrin uses examples to motivate the view that we have a\nconcept of non-comparative harm and, just as important, that\nnon-comparative harm has moral relevance. Thus she argues that, if you\nare hit on the head by a gold bar dropped from the sky, you have been\nharmed even if you have been more than compensated for that\nharm in virtue of the fact that you are now in possession of the gold\nbar (Shiffrin 1999, 120\u2013135).\n\nIn the wrongful life case, a child is born with a serious genetic or\nchromosomal impairment, an impairment that is unavoidable if the child\nis to exist at all. On a comparative account of harm, bringing that\nchild into existence does not harm that child \u2013 provided the\nexistence is not less than worth having. But, as Elizabeth Harman\nnotes, it\u2019s indisputable that bringing that child into existence\ndoes cause the child to experience \u201cpain, mental or\nphysical discomfort, disease, deformity, disability, or death\u201d;\nmore generally, it produces a state that is bad for the child to be in\n\u2013 a \u201cbad state.\u201d (Harman 2009, 139). On\nHarman\u2019s view, an act\u2019s imposing any of the listed effects\non the child is sufficient to establish that that act harms\nthe child, whether or not the child has been made worse off (Harman\n2004, 92\u201393 and 107; Harman 2009, 139). It would be hard to\nargue, moreover, that harm in that form has no moral relevance. Thus,\neven those who think that wrongful life doesn\u2019t involve harm\n\u2013 harm, that is, in the intuitive, comparative sense of that\nterm \u2013 agree that any pain and suffering experienced by the\nchild must be taken into account in order to determine that the\nchild\u2019s existence is not less than worth having. (In the rare\ncase in which the child\u2019s existence is less than worth\nhaving \u2013 in which, that is, the child would have been better off\nnever existing at all \u2013 we would say that the child sustains\nboth comparative and non-comparative harm.) \n\nA related proposal that avoids the difficulties of tethering\nnon-comparative harm to any particular list of adverse conditions\nmakes use of the concept of a threshold-dependent concept of\nharm (Rivera-Lopez 2009, 342; see also Meyer, 2004). On this view,\nbringing a child into existence whose wellbeing level falls below\n\u201csome normal threshold of quality of life\u201d counts as\nharming that child even if that existence is itself worth\nhaving (Rivera-Lopez 2009, 337). \n\nObjections to proposals that rely on a non-comparative concept of harm\nto solve the nonidentity problem focus on whether that concept itself\ncan be clearly worked out. Thus, it may be hard to see how one whose\nwellbeing has been maximized can at the same time have been\nharmed in any sense of that term that remains clearly within\nour grasp. Moreover, as Parfit suggests, even if we think it correct\non occasion to say that a person who has not been made worse off has\nbeen \u201charmed,\u201d we may still be unclear whether that person\nhas been harmed in a \u201cmorally relevant sense\u201d (Parfit\n1987, 374). Finally, there is the question of limits: what adverse\nconditions are to appear on the non-comparative harm list? What is the\nthreshold level below which existence counts as harm? What is\n\u201cnormal\u201d? And are we really willing to eliminate or at\nleast to mix up the distinction we think we now can so cleanly draw\nbetween, e.g., the case in which opening up one\u2019s chest to\nexpose the heart serves no purpose at all and the case in which\nopening up one\u2019s chest to expose the heart is an essential part\nof an open-heart procedure that is itself both necessary and\nsufficient to restore life and health? For critical discussion of the\nnon-comparative account of harm, see Gardner 2015.\n\nA strategy that avoids disputes surrounding the concept of harm would\nbe to argue that, even if the act does not harm the child,\nthe fact that it causes the child to suffer may mean that it\nnonetheless wrongs the child. Bonnie Steinbock thus\nrecognizes how hard it is to establish that the child brought into the\nunavoidably flawed existence has been genuinely harmed (Steinbock\n2009, 157\u2013158). But she argues that we still have room to insist\nthat such a child has been treated unfairly or has been wronged in\ncases in which the child\u2019s existence fails to meet or exceed a\ncertain \u201cdecent minimum,\u201d which is itself achieved\n\u201conly if life holds a reasonable promise of containing the\nthings that make human lives good,\u201d such as \u201can ability to\nexperience pleasure, to learn, to have relationships with\nothers\u201d (Steinbock 2009, 163\u2013165). Another approach would\nbe to draw the line at average wellbeing (for discussion, see Rachels\n1998; Tooley 1998). Still another approach would be to focus on\nwhether the child will face unusual or severe hardships (Benatar 2000;\nKamm 2002).\n\nMatthew Hanser underlines an issue raised by all of the proposals\nsketched in this part 3.3.2. Does an act that causes a person to\nendure even serious hardship necessarily harm that person\neven if we agree that person suffers harm (in a\nnon-comparative sense)? Hanser\u2019s own view is that an act harms a\nperson only if the agent stands in some \u201cappropriate\nrelation\u201d to the harm that is suffered, where that relation will\ninvolve a counterfactual element and accordingly may not obtain if the\nsuffering is due to a genetic disease or disorder (Hanser 2009). While\nHanser puts the point in terms of harm, it could be extended to the\nnotion of wronging without harming that Steinbock suggests. \n\nIn raising this issue, Hanser suggests that we can bifurcate the\nnonidentity cases, analyzing, for example, the wrongful life case in\none way and the depletion case in another. We can, that is, say that\nthe future people in both sorts of cases have suffered harm\nbut only the victims of depletion have been harmed by the\nchoice under scrutiny. Or in terms of wronging: the future people in\nboth sorts of cases are made to exist in a wronged state but only the\nvictims of depletion have been wronged.\n\nGardner\u2019s alternate account of harm, the \u201ceffect-relative\u201d account, avoids asking whether an act makes a\ngiven individual worse off and instead determines harm on the basis of a comparison between various states that may be said to be \u201cintrinsically better or worse off\u201d for a given individual. (Gardner 2015, 2017). To make use of such an approach in the nonidentity context, the proposed\nanalysis would seem to include, as a part of the test for harm, the assumption that\nthe individual exists (Gardner 2015). Thus we ask whether a state in which a person exists and suffers a limitation is worse for that person than a state in which the person exists but does not suffer the limitation (Gardner 2015, 2017). An obstacle\nfor such an account of harm is that it seems to generate too many instances of harm (in the case, e.g., where the state in which the person exists and does not suffer the limitation is, though possible, physically, or causally, unavailable to the relevant agents). Moreover, the question arises how the account can be generalized to produce acceptable results a broader range of cases. If the assumption of existence is part of the test for harm in the nonidentity context, it might seem that we should say as well that the assumption of existence, that is, survival, is part of the test for harm in the case of the open-heart procedure described earlier in this part\n3.3.2. \n3.4 Nonidentity problem rooted in confusions regarding when a person is made worse off\n3.4.1 Expanding the metaphysics of personal identity and harm\n\nSeveral proposals fall under this heading. Proposal (a) below accepts\nthat the future person p is nonidentical to the person\nq conceived from distinct gametes and then exploits the fact\nthat p and q may fall under the same description;\nproposal (b) argues p and q may be identical despite\na distinction in gametes (despite, that is, a distinction in the\ntiming and manner of conception); proposal (c) argues, on metaphysical\ngrounds, that the nonidentity problem rests on a certain equivocation\nin the use of the term \u201cperson\u201d; proposal (d) exploits\ncertain predictable mistakes many people will make in thinking about\nthe identity between p and q; and proposal (e)\nexplores an equivocation in what it is to make things worse off for a\nparticular person.\n\n(a) Though Parfit briefly discusses and sets aside the descriptive\nproposal (Parfit 1987, 359\u201360), interest in that proposal has\nbeen renewed in recent years (Hare 2007, 512\u201323, advocating a\nconcept of \u201cde dicto\u201d harm; Reiman 2007, 78\u201390,\ndescribing a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d with respect to the\nidentity of the person harmed; Wolf 2009). The proposal makes use of\nthe fact that the same definite description can pick out distinct\nchildren in distinct scenarios. Consider the slave child case. Let\np be the child who in fact exists and suffers as a result of\nthe couple\u2019s entering into the slave child contract. And let\nq be any one of the children who might have existed had the\ncouple not entered into the slave child contract yet still produced a\nchild. The nonidentity problem argues (among other things) that\np and q are, at least very probably, numerically\ndistinct, that is, nonidentical. At the same time, on one\nconstruction, p and q, even if nonidentical, fall\nunder a common description: they are equally, for example, \u201cthe\nchild produced by the couple.\u201d Moreover, since one choice makes\np worse off than the other choice makes q, the one\nchoice, on a certain construction, makes \u201cthe child produced by\nthe couple\u201d worse off than the other choice makes \u201cthe\nchild produced by the couple.\u201d And on that basis we can then say\nthat the one choice makes things (\u201cde dicto\u201d) worse for\n\u201cthe child produced by the couple\u201d than the other choice\ndoes.\n\nParfit\u2019s own concerns about proposal (a) are based on the\napparent explanatory gap between the claim that the couple\u2019s act\nmakes things worse for \u201cthe child produced by the couple\u201d\nand the result we seek to explain \u2013 that the act of entering\ninto the contract is wrong. The question is whether there is anything\nwe can grasp in what the couple has done to the child in fact\nproduced that explains why the couple\u2019s act is\nwrong. No \u201cfamiliar moral principle\u201d takes us from the\nshorthand claim to the assessment we are aiming to explain (Parfit\n1987, 359; Wasserman 2008, 529\u201335; for discussion, see Weinberg 2008.)\n\n(b) Proposal (b) challenges the metaphysical claims about cross-world\nidentity that are inherent in the nonidentity problem. On this\nproposal, the child p produced as a slave when the couple\nchooses to enter into the slave child contract and the child\nq produced as a non-slave when the couple refrains from\nentering into the contract but still produces a child should not\nnecessarily be considered distinct. p and q may, in\nother words, be the very same child despite the fact that\n(due to variations in the timing and manner of their conceptions) they\nhave ended up with distinct genomes. For alternative ways of\ndeveloping such a de dicto approach to personal identity, see\nHare 2007 and Wolf 2009.\n\n(c) Proposal (c), which rejects theories of personal identity that\nreflect a rigid form of essentialism, posits that there exist\n\u201cmany entities in the vicinity of\u201d the child who\neventually comes into existence in the various nonidentity cases and\nis the subject of our person-based concern. If we accept both the\nperson-based idea that an act is wrong only if it is bad for a\nparticular person \u2013 a person who does or will exist \u2013 and\nthe idea that an act is bad for a person only if that person\n\u201cwould have existed\u201d had an alternative act been chosen,\nwe are, without realizing it, focusing on distinct entities, with one\nclaiming holding of one entity and the other claim holding of another.\nDasgupta 2018, 541\u2013542; 550\u2013554. For a proposal that similarly rejects\na strict form of the origins (genetic) account of personal identity in\nfavor of a Lewisian \u201ccounterpart-theoretic\u201d approach for\nthe purpose of solving the nonidentity problem and specifically aims\nto retain the cogency of certain harm claims in that context, see\nWrigley 2012. An account that also appeals to counterpart theory with\nthe aim of resolving not just the nonidentity problem but the full\nrange of population problems can be found in Meacham 2012. For a more\ngeneral discussion, see Cooper 2015.\n\n(d) Proposal (d) involves a form of rule consequentialism that, rather\nthan struggling to avoid, simply exploits two na\u00efve mistakes that\nmany people may well make when they first begin to think about their\nobligations in respect of future people. The first is the mistake of\nthinking that the population produced when, for example, agents choose\nconservation will be identical, at least in part, to the population\nproduced when agents instead choose depletion. The second is the\nperson-based intuition itself \u2013 the idea that an act that makes\nthings worse for no existing or future person cannot be wrong. Tim\nMulgan suggests that the \u201cideal code\u201d \u2013 the code\nwhose internalization by most of a given society will maximize\nwellbeing on an aggregate basis \u2013 will incorporate both these\nmistakes. They are both, after all, easily and efficiently\n\u201ctaught\u201d since (Mulgan thinks) we are prone to make them\nin any case and they in effect cancel each other out. Because the\nideal code is violated by the depletion choice and the 14-year-old\ngirl\u2019s choice to have a child, both are declared wrong (Mulgan\n2006, 155\u201356 and 204; Mulgan 2009).\n\n(e) Cases involving causal preemption seem to show that the simple\ncounterfactual account of what it is to make things worse for a person\n\u2013 an act is worse for a person only if it makes that person\n\u201cworse off than [that person] would otherwise be\u201d \u2013\nfails (Bontly 2016, 1236). For the premises of the nonidentity problem\nitself, then, to remain plausible, we must understand what it is for\nan act to be \u201cworse for\u201d a person in another way. One\noption is to say that an act is worse for someone if and only if it\n\u201caffects that person for the worse,\u201d where it is\nunderstood that an act that has an \u201ceffect\u201d on a person\nthat is itself adverse in some way is sufficient to show that the act\n\u201caffects that person for the worse\u201d (Bontly 2016,\n1237\u201338). We then suspect an equivocation when we realize that\nwe can\u2019t both hold that understanding of what it is for an act\nto be \u201cworse for\u201d a person constant and at the same time\ninsure that still other premises of the nonidentity argument remain plausible.\nSpecifically: while the claim that an act is not worse for a person\nif (sufficient condition) that person has a life worth living\nand \u201cwould never exist had [that] act not been performed\u201d\nseems plausible, the claim that that act does not \u201caffect [that\nperson] for the worse\u201d given those same conditions \u201cseems\nrather more dubious\u201d (Bontly 2016, 1238\u20131241).\n3.4.2 Is there an explanatory gap?\n\nAn ongoing controversy raised by the proposals described in part 3.4.1\nis whether they successfully explain the wrongness of the wrong act in\nterms of the adverse consequences that act has for the person\nwhose plight has drawn our concern to begin with. Or do those\nproposals either (i) trace the wrongness of the wrong act to something\nother than what is bad for that particular person or (ii) ask us,\nwithout adequate justification, to abandon the handful of clear\nintuitions that we do seem to have regarding personal identity? (i) Do\nthey retain the person-based intuition in a sufficiently robust form?\nOr are they person-based in name only and in fact root their\nexplanation of wrongness not in what is bad for the person\nbut rather in what is bad for the world? (ii) Do they ask us\nto concede that p and q are one and the\nsame person in cases where we really can\u2019t bring ourselves to\nbelieve that p and q are one and the same\nperson? Could my father\u2019s first-born child have been me\nhad he never met my mother at all and instead produced a very\ndifferent child with a very different genome born at a very different\ntime? We should agree we can figure out a theory that implies such a\nclaim of identity. What is unclear is the justification that compels\nus to accept that theory.\n\nIf we both confine our scrutiny to what has been done to the\nparticular child and insist on retaining some of our clearest\nintuitions regarding personal identity, a second concern immediately\narises. As David Wasserman notes, if the child\u2019s life is itself,\nthough flawed, worth living and if that flaw is unavoidable if that\nparticular child is ever to exist at all, it may seem that any\ndifficulty the child then faces is a \u201cperfectly acceptable price\nto pay for a life he [or she] could not have without it\u201d\n(Wasserman 2006, 145). We again are left with the kind of explanatory\ngap that Parfit noted in connection with the descriptive view\ndiscussed in part (a) above. Confining our scrutiny just to what has\nbeen done to the child and properly taking into account the good that\nhas been done for the child as well as the bad, we cannot discern why\nwhat has been done is, by any stretch, bad for the child and hence\ncannot discern any person-based ground for the claim that what has\nbeen done is wrong.\n\nThe position that the nonidentity problem can be resolved as an\nequivocation on what is to make a person worse off raises another\nissue. As the nonidentity cases are typically understood and in\ncontrast to the preemption cases, it remains unclear that the act\nunder scrutiny \u2013 the very act that brings the apparent victim\ninto the worth-having existence to begin with \u2013 truly affects\nthe person for the worse. \n3.5 Nonidentity problem rooted in mistakes in calculating the relevant probabilities\n\nThis proposal claims we can retain the person-based intuition, thus\nrecognizing that bringing a person into an existence that is worth\nhaving but unavoidably flawed does not make things worse for,\nor harm (in a morally relevant sense), that person and yet insist that\nthe acts under scrutiny in the class of cases that most seriously\nchallenge the person-based intuition do, after all, make things worse\nfor the people they bring into the flawed existence (Roberts 1998;\n2003; 2006; 2009; Roberts and Wasserman 2017).\n\nThe proposal thus retains intuitions (1) and (2) but argues that the\ncondition set forth in intuition (2) \u2013 that the existence is\nunavoidably flawed \u2013 has not been satisfied for that\nclass of nonidentity cases. And it retains intuition (3) for that same\nclass of cases while rejecting (3) for those cases in which the\nexistence truly is unavoidably flawed (and arguing that, for that\nclass of cases, the claim that the act under scrutiny is permissible\nis perfectly plausible). \n\nThe strategy here is limited to the class of nonidentity cases that\nreason from (a) had the act under scrutiny not been performed, the\nperson who exists and suffers as an effect of that act very\nprobably would never have existed at all and (b) that existence\nis worth having to the conclusion (c) that act does not make things\nworse for, or harm, that person. That class of cases includes\nKavka\u2019s slave child and pleasure pill cases, Parfit\u2019s\ndepletion and risky policy cases, Broome\u2019s climate change case\nand cases involving historical injustice. The proposal does not,\nhowever, suggest that there is still a further class of nonidentity\ncases that does challenge the person-based intuition. Rather,\nit considers that further class of cases \u2013 which includes cases\nin which the existence is worth having but unavoidably flawed\ndue to a genetic or chromosomal disorder \u2013 as less worrisome in\nthe sense that it is surely less clear to us that the acts under\nscrutiny are themselves wrong.\n\nThe broader argument, then is that, in any case in which it is clear\nto us that what is done is wrong we can, on closer inspection,\nidentify just how the people caused to exist have been made worse off.\nAnd, in any case in which we are forced to concede that the\nperson caused to exist has not been made worse off \u2013\nany case in which the existence is unavoidably flawed but still worth\nhaving \u2013 we should acknowledge that it is not really clear to us\nat all that what has been done is wrong. \n\nWhat, then, is the argument for the claim that such a significant\nmistake in reasoning has been made? The first step in unwinding that\nmistake is to clarify that when we say an act makes a person worse\noff, we are not trying to press the claim that the act\nmakes the person worse off than that person would have been\nhad that act not been performed. The simple, counterfactual,\n\u201cbut for,\u201d account of harm that kind of effort involves\nwas \u2013 rightly \u2013 rejected decades ago. An alternative\nposition is that an act makes a person worse off at a given world if\nthere is some alternate act agents could have performed instead at an\nalternate world that would have made things better for that person at\nthat alternate world. If, in other words, it is (physically and\nmetaphysically) possible for agents to make things better for a given\nperson \u2013 if such an alternate world is accessible\nrelative to the one world \u2013 then what the agents have done makes\nthings worse for, and, we can say, harms, that person. For\ndefense of a maximizing account of harm, see Roberts 2011, Roberts\n2009, 209\u2013217, and Roberts 2007. For critical discussion of the\nsimple counterfactual account and the alternative maximizing account\nof harm, see Carlson forthcoming. For a reconstruction and defense of\nthe simple counterfactual account, see Klocksiem 2012. \n\nThe second step is to note that in the class of nonidentity cases that\nmost seriously challenge the person-based intuition agents\ndid have some way of making things better for the person who\nhas been brought into a flawed existence. Thus, nothing in the laws of\nphysics or metaphysics or in the acts of other agents bars the agents\nin the slave child case from not entering into the slave\nchild contract and still following the identical timetable\nfor conception they in fact followed and bringing into existence as a\nnon-slave the very same child they in fact brought into existence as a\nslave. \n\nIt might be objected that, while such a better-for-the-child outcome\nis physically and metaphysically possible \u2013 that is,\naccessible \u2013 it is surely highly improbable.\nThe third step of the proposed solution addresses that objection. It\nacknowledges Kavka\u2019s point about the precariousness of any given\nperson\u2019s coming into existence: the probability that that\nidentical child will come into existence, given that the\nagents do anything other than perform the clearly wrong act they in\nfact perform, is very low. We might say: the probability that agents\nwill follow the identical timetable for conception \u2013\nthat the timing and manner of conception will be at least close enough\nto the original to result in the conception of the identical\nchild \u2013 is very low. But it notes that the probability\ncalculation must itself be made as of that moment just prior to\nchoice. (It is, after all, that calculation that is relevant to a\ncalculation of the act\u2019s expected value. If it is\nactual value we are interested in instead, we\u2019ve\nalready shown that some alternate act exists that has more\nactual value to offer the child than the act in fact\nperformed.) It then notes further that \u2013 again calculating\nprobability just prior to choice \u2013 the probability of the\nparticular child\u2019s coming into existence is also very low, even\ngiven that the agents do enter into the slave child contract.\n\n\nSuppose, that is, that it is Harry who is in fact brought\ninto existence as a slave, the couple having entered the slave child\ncontract and conceived and produced a child. The proposal here simply\nnotes that the probability, calculated just prior to choice, that\nHarry will exist, given that the couple enters into the slave child\ncontract, is also very low. We might say: prior to choice, the\nprobability that the couple will follow exactly the timetable they in\nfact end up following (or anything sufficiently like it) is just as\nminuscule whether the couple enters into the contract and conceives a\nchild or the couple doesn\u2019t enter into the contract and still\nconceives a child. The probabilities, either way, are very\nlow and, indeed, a wash. For an objection that concedes such an\naccount supports a claim that choice under scrutiny makes things worse\nfor the child but argues that the adverse effect is so minuscule that\nthe account nonetheless fails to support to the claim that the choice\nunder scrutiny is wrong, see Greene 2016. \n\nOne might object that in fact there is no probability Harry\nwould exist in the absence of the couple\u2019s entering the\ncontract, for without the contract the probability that couple would\ntogether have produced any child at all is 0. That may be right, but\nit doesn\u2019t bear on whether Harry has been made worse off. As\nnoted above, the simple, counterfactual, \u201cbut for,\u201d\naccount of when a person has been made worse off (or harmed) must be\nrejected. It isn\u2019t what agents would have done, but\nwhat they accessibly could have done, that determines whether\nwhat they have done makes a person worse off or harms that person. If\nI shoot you in the arm and would have shot you in the heart had I not\nshot you in the arm, I have still made you worse off. I have made you\nworse off \u2013 not worse off than you would have been had I not\nshot you in the arm, but rather off worse off than you would have been\nhad I just stood there quietly instead. It\u2019s the best I \naccessibly could have done that should be our baseline\nin Feinberg\u2019s sense \u2013 not what I would have done\n\u2013 for purposes of determining when a person has been made worse\noff (or, in a morally relevant sense, harmed) (Feinberg 1988).\n\nNor is it appropriate to determine whether a person has been made\nworse off by a given act by comparing the actual value\nproduced for that person by that act against the expected\nvalue produced for that person by any alternate act. The proposal here\ntakes no position on whether the expected or actual value approach is\ncorrect. But it does take into account that the view that an act can\nbe considered at least as good for a person than an alternate act if\nthe actual value the one act generates for that person is at\nleast as great as the expected value the alternate act\ngenerates for that person is inconsistent (Roberts 2009). \n\nThat philosophers would mistakenly reason to the result that the\napparent victim has not been made worse off is understandable. We see\nhow things in fact are for the slave child under the act in fact\nperformed, we see how precarious the child\u2019s coming into\nexistence is under any alternate act and we fail to notice that\n\u2013 calculated as of that moment just prior to choice \u2013 the\nchild\u2019s coming into existence is just as precarious under the\nact in fact performed. \n\nProbabilities under the act under scrutiny may decline even further in\ncases that involve clearer risks to health and wellbeing. Consider a\nman whose great-grandparents suffered in the Holocaust and who now\nmust ask himself what his attitude should be toward those atrocities.\nSince he is grateful for life itself, should he feel bad that he must\nalso be grateful to the agents of those atrocities for the role they\nplayed in bringing him into existence? On this proposal, he need not\nbe torn; his gratitude is misplaced. The atrocities may indeed have\nbeen a part of the causal chain ending in his existence. But there\nwere alternate causal chains as well that equally would have ended in\nhis existence had the relevant agents gone down those paths instead.\nIf anything, by jeopardizing the lives of Harry\u2019s own forebears\non a daily basis, the atrocities only served to further reduce his own\nchances of ever coming into existence at all. For critical discussion,\nsee Smilansky 2017.\n3.6 Act is wrong in virtue of agent\u2019s reasons, attitudes and intentions\n3.6.1 Act violates principle of mutual respect\n\nA contractualist approach to the nonidentity problem will focus on the\nlegitimate expectations future people have in respect of the agents\nwhose acts cause those future people both to exist and suffer. Such\nexpectations can be violated \u2013 and future people wronged \u2013\neven in cases where those people have not been made worse off, or\nharmed, by what the agent has done. What is important is not the\noutcome for the person but rather the \u201cculpable failure\u201d\non the part of the agent, including the failure to respect a future\nperson\u2019s \u201cvalue as capable of rational\nself-governance\u201d by way of failing to take\n\u201crisk-managing\u201d measures (including, e.g, pre-conceptual\ngenetic testing) on behalf of that future person (Kumar 2003,\n104\u2013114; Kumar 2018). An issue that immediately arises is\nwhether a measure that makes it the case that the person who will suffer can never\nexist at all is genuinely risk-managing in respect of that\nperson. Drawing from Scanlon 1998, Kumar describes an alternative\nposition that focuses, not on how acts may affect particular people,\nbut rather on types of persons, or standpoints, and,\nspecifically, \u201cthe reasons that persons in certain circumstances\n\u2026 typically have for caring about or wanting certain\nthings.\u201d Principles reflected in such reasons \u2013 principles\n\u201cno one can reasonably reject\u201d \u2013 include preferences\nagainst the risk of living a life that is seriously compromised.\nFailing to take such reasons into account (depending on other facts)\nis counted as a wrong against (though not a harm to)\nany particular person who eventually exists and, as a result of the\nact under scrutiny, suffers. Kumar 2018. Left unclear is how to\nreconcile the standpoint against the personal risk.\nA future standpoint may include the \u201cgeneric\u201d preference\nnot to suffer the side effects of a particular infertility treatment.\nBut if that treatment is necessary for the person ever to exist at\nall, it is unclear that the treatment itself wrongs that person. \n\nFinneron-Burns offers an alternative account of how Scanlon\u2019s\ncontractualism can be applied to solve the nonidentity problem. That\naccount avoids phrasing the debate in terms of types or standpoints\nthat need not be tied to any particular individual and instead argues\nthat we can think about future people \u2013 people who will in fact\none day exist \u2013 in the same terms we think about existing people\n(Finneron-Burns 2016, 1151\u20131153; 1160\u20131162). At the same time, on this\nview \u201cpossible people are not included in the scope of those to\nwhom we owe justification\u201d (Finneron-Burns 2016, 1163). The\nview, accordingly, will face the same hurdles as will any other view\nthat claims that existing and future people have a special moral\nstatus that the merely possible lack. See part 4 below. \n3.6.2 Act\u2019s agent fails to have appropriate concern for future person\u2019s plight\n\nA second approach that shifts the analysis of wrongdoing away from\nwhat has been done to the future person and toward the situation of\nthe agent focuses on the agent\u2019s reasons for making one choice\nrather than another. On this approach, attitudes themselves can be\n\u201cmorally defective\u201d (Kahane 2008, p. 203). Whether the\nagent\u2019s act wrongs the future person will depend on whether the\nagent is motivated by an appropriate level of concern for the needs\nand interests of (among others) the future person. Is the agent\nappropriately sensitive both to the degree of suffering that person\ncan be expected to endure and to the various aspects of that\nperson\u2019s life that can be expected to render that life (on\nbalance) worth living (Wasserman 2006, 146)? The parent may have a\nprincipled objection against pre-implantation genetic diagnosis but\nalso have an appropriate level of concern for the child\u2019s\nplight. In that case, the parent\u2019s producing the impaired child\nin place of the better-off but nonidentical child does not wrong the\nimpaired child. On the other hand, if a parent fails to undergo\ngenetic testing out of laziness and never considers the challenges\nthat the child might face as a result of being born impaired, then\nwhat the parent has done is wrong. Thus, on this view, the act\u2019s\npermissibility is a function not of the expected good for the child in\nfact being counterbalanced by the expected bad but rather of the\nparent\u2019s careful determination of how the one balances against\nthe other (Wasserman 2006, 146\u2013151). An implication of this view\nis that there need be nothing wrong in choosing to have a less happy\nrather than a happier child.\n\nChoices by policymakers (in, e.g., the context of the depletion\nexample) can be similarly evaluated. The parent\u2019s and the\npolicymaker\u2019s roles may differ in respect of the future people\ntheir choices will cause to exist but agents in both roles can\nplausibly be held to a role-appropriate standard of concern (Wasserman\n2009).\n4. Further challenges to the person-based intuition \n\nPart of the reason the person-based intuition has been so attractive\nis its good fit with what Jeff McMahan calls the Asymmetry\n(McMahan 1981; 2009). According to the Asymmetry, it is wrong (and\nmakes an outcome morally worse) to bring a miserable child\n\u2013 a child whose life is less than worth living \u2013\ninto existence but it is perfectly permissible (and does not make an\noutcome worse) to leave the happy child out of existence.\nWhile (arguably) leaving the happy child out of existence makes things\nworse for that child, the person-based intuition requires for\nwrongdoing not that things be made worse for a person who\nnever exists but rather that things be made worse for a\nperson who does or will exist.\n\nJan Narveson was an early advocate of both the person-based intuition\nand the Asymmetry. His defense of the Asymmetry, however, has been\nsubject to criticism by McMahan, Persson, Singer and Parfit. At this\njuncture, conceptual concerns about the Asymmetry have been just as\nimportant in leading philosophers to question the person-based\nintuition as the nonidentity problem has been.\n\nThe conceptual concerns arise when attempts are made to explain the\nAsymmetry by reference to principles that assign a special moral\nstatus to actual people (or people who will exist if the act under\nscrutiny is performed; or people who will exist independently of\nwhether that act is performed) that they do not also assign to merely\npossible people (or to never existing people; or to people whose\nexistence depends on that act being performed) (McMahan 1981; 2009;\nPersson 2009; Singer 2011, 114; Parfit 2011 vol. 2, 224\u2013225).\nSimilar concerns arise in connection with cases involving cycling, e.g., Parfit\u2019s Tom, Dick and Harry case. See Parfit 2017, 140\u2013146. See also Hare 2007, 503\u2013507 (discussion of double wrongful life; discussion of the Asymmetry).\n\nAn alternate defense of the Asymmetry avoids the claim that there is a\ncritical moral distinction to be drawn between classes of people\n(between, e.g., actual and merely possible people, or between people\nwho do or will exist at the world at which the act under scrutiny is\nperformed and people who will never exist at that world). On that\ndefense, we should instead distinguish, for any given person p\nin any such class, between p\u2019s being made worse off at a\ngiven world (compared to how well p fares at any alternate\nworld) where p does or will exist and p\u2019s\nbeing made worse off at one world (compared, again, to how well\np fares at any alternate world) where p never\nexists. And we should say that p\u2019s being made worse\noff in the former scenario has full moral significance while\np\u2019s being worse off in the latter has no moral\nsignificance at all. Then, even conceding that leaving the happy child\nout of existence makes that child worse off than that child might have\nbeen \u2013 even conceding, that is, that the happy child sustains a\n\u201closs\u201d or \u201charm\u201d when left out of existence\n\u2013 we can say that that loss does not count against the\nchoice to leave the happy child out of existence or in favor\nof the choice to bring that child into existence. In contrast,\nbringing the miserable child into an existence that is less than worth\nhaving has full moral significance. It counts, that is, against the\nchoice to bring that child into existence and in favor of the choice\nto leave that child out of existence. Why? Because the miserable child\nexists at the world where he or she sustains that loss (Roberts 2010,\n2011a, 2011b).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, R.M., 1972. \u201cMust God Create the Best?\u201d <em>The\nPhilosophical Review</em>, 81(3): 317\u2013332.", "Archard, D., 2004. \u201cWrongful Life,\u201d\n<em>Philosophy</em>, 79(3): 403\u2013420.", "Archard, D. and D.
