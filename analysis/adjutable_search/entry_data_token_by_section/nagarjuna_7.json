    "main_text": "Arguments against svabh\u0101va || Language and truth\n3.5 Language and truth\n\nLanguage is not a topic that is given much explicit discussion in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. This does not mean that such\nmatters were not important to him, but merely that his extant writings\ndo not contain an extended connected discussion of the impact of his\ntheory of emptiness on his view of language.\n\nNevertheless it is possible to extract some of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s views on this philosophically highly\ninteresting issue from remarks found at different places in his\nworks.\n\nMost importantly it is apparent that the Madhyamaka theory of\nemptiness is not compatible with a the idea of a \u2018ready-made\nworld\u2019, that is of a world that exists independently of human\ninterests and concerns and already shows a particular kind of\nstructuring that our structured language could then set out to\nreflect. If nothing exists with svabh\u0101va nothing in the\nworld could exist from its own side and nothing could bear a structure\nthat is intrinsic to it, rather than something ascribed to it from the\noutside. Moreover, the M\u0101dhyamika will reject the classic\ncorrespondence theory of truth, according to which the truth of a\nstatement is grounded in the identity of structure between a statement\nand the bit of the world it refers to. This also entails a rejection\nof the associated view of how language works, namely that our\nsentences manage to connect up with the world via a set of objectively\nexistent structural similarities. The main reason for this rejection\nis that the M\u0101dhyamika cannot find any sufficiently substantial\nrelation that would allow us to bind together world and word at the\nmost fundamental level. The most plausible candidate for linking words\nand their referents is the causal relation, for example by using it to\nconstruct a causal chain from an \u2018initial baptism\u2019 to our\npresent use of the term. But as we have seen, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has\nargued that the causal relation itself is conceptually constructed. If\ncausation cannot be regarded as a relation that functions objectively,\nindependent of the concepts we employ then it can hardly be regarded\nas a mind-independent way of grounding the relationship between\nlanguage and the world.\n\nAn alternative account which the M\u0101dhyamika might want to adopt\nis one which does not conceive of truth in terms of correspondence\nwith an exterior reality but rather in terms of assertability\nconditions. In this case a statement is regarded as true if conditions\nobtain that warrant our asserting the statement. What makes the\nstatement that water is wet true is not a structural correspondence\nbetween it and a state of affairs involving water, but that we have\nsomething that justifies us in making this statement. What this\njustification consists in depends on the further details of our theory\nof truth; it might be based on facts about empirical observation,\nabout coherence with other beliefs, about pragmatic success and so\nforth. This view of course implies that there could not be any truths\nthat are in principle beyond our ability to know them. This is because\nwe could never have a warrant for asserting such statements, and the\nexistence of such a warrant is precisely what we consider the truth of\nthe statements to consist in. Such statements would have to be\nregarded as lacking a truth-value. This kind of denial of\nverification-transcendent truths in turn agrees very well with\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s contextualist epistemology. For if nothing\nis intrinsically an epistemic instrument nothing can be intrinsically\nbeyond the grasp of such instruments either. As what constitutes an\nepistemic instrument is context-dependent, that a certain truth cannot\nbe accessed by some instrument is context-dependent too. There is no\ncontext-independent concept of knowledge we could use to form the idea\nof a truth that lies beyond all epistemic contexts.\n\nAccording to the Madhyamaka view of truth there can be no such thing\nas ultimate truth, a theory describing how things really are,\nindependent of our interests and conceptual resources employed in\ndescribing it. All one is left with is conventional truth, truth which\nconsists in agreement with commonly accepted practices and\nconventions. These are the truths that are arrived at when viewing the\nworld through our linguistically formed conceptual framework. But we\nshould be wary of denigrating these conventions as a distorting device\nthat incorporates our specific interests and concerns. The very notion\nof \u2018distortion\u2019 presupposes that there is a world\nuntainted by conceptuality out there (even if our minds can never\nreach it) that is twisted and bent to fit our cognitive grasp. But the\nvery notion of such a \u2018way things really are\u2019 is argued by\nthe M\u0101dhyamika to be incoherent. There is no way of investigating\nthe world apart from our linguistic and conceptual practices, if only\nbecause these practices generate the notion of the \u2018world\u2019\nand of the \u2018objects\u2019 in it in the first place. To speak of\nconventional reality as distorted is therefore highly misleading,\nunless all we want to say is that our way of investigating the world\nis inextricably bound up with the linguistic and conceptual framework\nwe happen to employ.\n\nThere are two worries one might have about the rejection of the notion\nof an ultimate truth. First of all one might think that progress in\nhuman inquiry makes it necessary that we question what we now believe\nto be truths and perhaps replace them with other beliefs. Even a\ncursory acquaintance with the history of science will show that we are\nwhere we are now only through a persistent process of replacing\nbeliefs we once held to be true, but no longer hold to be true. But it\nseems hard to explain what our justification for this is if it is not\ntrying to bring our beliefs into greater accordance with the way\nthings are. All we ever seem to be dealing with according to the\nMadhyamaka view is a purely immanent notion of truth where the only\nkind of truth we have access to is a reflection of conventional human\npractices and agreements. In response to this the M\u0101dhyamika\nmight want to make the point that it is at least sometimes\nadvantageous to treat truths as if they had a more than\nconventional grounding, that is as if they were not just the\nproduct of agreement with commonly accepted practices and conventions.\nThis is precisely because such practices need improvement from time to\ntime, and since a spirit of inquiry is facilitated better by the idea\nthat there is a mind-independent truth waiting to be discovered. The\nM\u0101dhyamika could thus argue that for pragmatic reasons we should\nconceive of truths as reflections of an objective, external reality\neven though we do not think that there are any such truths in fact. We\nmight object at this point that if the notion of the existence of at\nleast some verification-transcendent truths is pragmatically useful,\nwhoever believes in truth as warranted assertability then has to\nbelieve that some truths are not conventional, since asserting this is\nnow supported by a warrant. But this will not just turn the\nanti-realist into a realist against his will, since his embracing of\nnon-conventional truths is dictated by purely practical concerns: we\nare considerably better off if we build our inquiries on the\nconvenient fiction of non-conventional truths. But they remain just\nthat, namely convenient fictions; the anti-realist does not think, as\nthe realist does, that the existence of such truths is in any way\ngrounded by the way the world is independent of our interests and\nconcerns.\n\nAnother worry with the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s rejection of an\nultimate truth is that emptiness cannot then be regarded as the\nultimate truth either. But surely, one will argue, for the\nM\u0101dhyamika emptiness is the end-product of the correct analysis\nof phenomena, and thereby indicative of the way things really are.\nHowever, emptiness is not to be understood as a description of reality\nas it is independent of human conceptual conventions, as its main\npurpose it to combat the wrong ascription of svabh\u0101va to\nthings. The absence of svabh\u0101va or emptiness is nothing\nphenomena have within themselves, but only something which is\nprojected onto them from the outside in an attempt to rectify a\nmistaken cognition. Therefore the theory of emptiness is not to be\nregarded as an ultimately true theory either. Such a theory would\ndescribe things as they are independent of human interests and\nconcerns. But the theory of emptiness is intricately bound up with\nsuch interests and concerns: if there were no human minds who\nmistakenly read the existence of svabh\u0101va into phenomena\nwhich lack it there would be no point in having a theory to correct\nthis. It is only due to our erroneous view of things that the theory\nof emptiness is required as a corrective.\n",
