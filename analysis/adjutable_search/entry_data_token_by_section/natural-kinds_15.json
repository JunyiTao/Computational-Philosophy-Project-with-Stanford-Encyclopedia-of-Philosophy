    "main_text": "The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms || Direct Reference and Externalism\n4.4 From Reference to Essence?\n\nAbove we saw that an identity statement conjoining two rigid\ndesignators expresses a necessary truth, one that may be knowable only\na posteriori. That follows simply from the definition of\n\u2018rigid designator\u2019. We have also seen that natural kind\nterms are rigid designators. That seems simply to be a fact about the\nsemantics of natural kind terms. Consequently it looks as if a\nnon-trivial metaphysical fact\u2014that there are necessary truths\nknowable only a posteriori\u2014is a consequence of\nKripke\u2019s semantics for natural kind terms. Furthermore, when we\nconsider theoretical identities, such as \u2018water is\nH2O\u2019 and \u2018gold is the element with atomic\nnumber 79\u2019 etc., it appears that we are being given a special\nkind of necessary truth, a truth that it necessary because it\nspecifies the essence of a kind.\n\nThe conclusion that we can derive metaphysical facts from semantic\nones has been regarded as highly questionable by many commentators.\nHow could facts about our use of terms lead to conclusions\nabout the essences of things and kinds? Furthermore, the\nanti-descriptivist semantics involved is closely related to semantic\nexternalism, but the latter need not imply essentialism, as Tyler\nBurge\u2019s social externalism shows (Burge 1979, 1986). Nathan\nSalmon (1982) argues that no non-trivial essentialist consequences can\nbe inferred from a theory of reference.\n\nOne might take the view that the apparent derivation of a metaphysical\nconclusion from semantic premises is a sleight of hand, with hidden\nessentialist premises being smuggled into the argument. If one were to\nassume that \u2018H2O\u2019 is a rigid designator, one\nmight be accused of tacitly assuming metaphysical essentialism.\nHowever, one might alternatively take the view that semantics and\nmetaphysics are more intimately related (Bird 2020). For example, one\nmight hold that the semantics itself makes certain metaphysical\nassumptions, in which case the metaphysics would follow from the\nsemantics, but innocently and for fairly trivial reasons. Note that a\nthoroughgoing Fregean descriptivism also has metaphysical\nconsequences, since it rules out essentialism. According to the view\nthat the correct semantics implies an essentialist metaphysics, the\nsemantic claim that \u2018water\u2019 is a rigid designator is\nitself metaphysically loaded. But this is not to say that Putnam,\nKripke, and other philosophers are smuggling in metaphysical\nassumptions. Rather, it is to say that competent users of the term\ntacitly make those assumptions. Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought\nexperiments make those assumptions explicit. Note that, as the above\ndiscussion has shown, while the thought experiments are normally\nexpressed in the formal mode\u2014we ask whether XYZ would fall\nwithin the extension of the term \u2018water\u2019 (Earth)\u2014the\nessentialist conclusion can be reached directly by phrasing the same\nquestion in the material mode: we ask whether XYZ would be\nwater.\n",
