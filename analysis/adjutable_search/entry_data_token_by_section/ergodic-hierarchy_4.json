    "main_text": "The Ergodic Hierarchy and Statistical Mechanics || Boltzmannian SM\n4.1 Boltzmannian SM\n\nWe first introduce the main elements of the Boltzmannian framework and\nthen turn to the use of ergodicity in it. Every system can posses\nvarious macrostates \\(M_1 ,\\ldots ,M_k\\). These macrostates are\ncharacterised by the values of macroscopic variables, in the case of a\ngas pressure, temperature, and\n volume.[14]\n In the introductory example one macro-state corresponds to the gas\nbeing confined to the left half, another one to it being spread out.\nIn fact, these two states have special status: the former is the\ngas\u2019 initial state (also referred to as the \u2018past\nstate\u2019); the latter is the gas\u2019 equilibrium state. We\nlabel the states \\(M_p\\) and \\(M_{eq}\\) respectively.\n\nIt is one of the fundamental posits of the Boltzmann approach that\nmacrostates supervene on microstates, meaning that a change in a\nsystem\u2019s macrostate must be accompanied by a change in its\nmicrostate (for a discussion of supervenience see McLaughlin and\nBennett 2005, and references therein). For instance, it is not\npossible to change the pressure of a system and at the same time keep\nits micro-state constant. Hence, to every given microstate \\(x\\) there\ncorresponds exactly one macrostate. Let us refer to this\nmacrostate as \\(M(x)\\). This determination relation is not one-to-one;\nin fact many different \\(x\\) can correspond to the same macrostate. We\nnow group together all microstates \\(x\\) that correspond to the same\nmacro-state, which yields a partitioning of the phase space in\nnon-overlapping regions, each corresponding to a macro-state. For this\nreason we also use the same letters, \\(M_1 ,\\ldots ,M_k\\), to refer to\nmacro-states and the corresponding regions in phase space. This is\nillustrated in Figure 6a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(6a)\n(6b) \n\n\nFigure 6: The macrostate structure of\n\\(X\\).\n\n\nWe are now in a position to introduce the Boltzmann entropy. To this\nend recall that we have a measure \\(\\mu \\) on the phase space that\nassigns to every set a particular volume, hence a fortiori\nalso to macrostates. With this in mind, the Boltzmann entropy of a\nmacro-state \\(M_j\\) can be defined as \\(S_B = k_B\\log [\\mu(M_j)]\\),\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant. The important feature of the\nlogarithm is that it is a monotonic function: the larger\n\\(M_j\\), the larger its logarithm. From this it follows that the\nlargest macro-state also has the highest entropy!\n\nOne can show that, at least in the case of dilute gases, the Boltzmann\nentropy coincides with the thermodynamic entropy (in the sense that\nboth have the same functional dependence on the basic state\nvariables), and so it is plausible to say that the equilibrium state\nis the macro-state for which the Boltzmann entropy is maximal (since\nthermodynamics posits that entropy be maximal for equilibrium states).\nBy assumption the system starts off in a low entropy state, the\ninitial state \\(M_p\\) (the gas being squeezed into the left half of\nthe box). The problem of explaining the approach to equilibrium then\namounts to answering the question: why does a system originally in\n\\(M_p\\) eventually move into \\(M_{eq}\\) and then stay there? (See\nFigure 6b.)\n\nIn the 1870s Boltzmann offered an important answer to this\n question.[15]\n At the heart of his answer lies the idea to assign probabilities to\nmacrostates according to their size. So Boltzmann adopted the\nfollowing postulate: \\(p(M_j) = c\\mu(M_j)\\) for all \\(j = 1,\\ldots\n,k\\), where \\(c\\) is a normalisation constant assuring that the\nprobabilities add up to one. Granted this postulate, it follows\nimmediately that the most likely state is the equilibrium state (since\nthe equilibrium state occupies the largest chunk of the phase space).\nFrom this point of view it seems natural to understand the approach to\nequilibrium as the evolution from an unlikely macrostate to a more\nlikely macrostate and finally to the most likely macro-state. This,\nBoltzmann argued, was a statistical justification of the Second Law of\nthermodynamics.\n\nBut Boltzmann knew that simply postulating \\(p(M_j) = c\\mu(M_j)\\)\nwould not solve the problem unless the postulate could be justified in\nterms of the dynamics of the system. This is where ergodicity enters\nthe scene. As we have seen above, ergodic systems have the property of\nspending a fraction of time in each part of the phase space that is\nproportional to its size (with respect to \\(\\mu)\\). As we have also\nseen, the equilibrium state is the largest macrostate. In fact, the\nequilibrium state is much larger than the other states. So if\nwe assume that the system is ergodic, then it is in equilibrium most\nof the time! It is then natural to interpret \\(p(M_j)\\) as a time\naverage: \\(p(M_j)\\) is the fraction of time that the system spends in\nstate \\(M_j\\) over the course of time. We now have the main elements\nof Boltzmann\u2019s framework in front of us: (a) partition the phase\nspace of the system in macrostates and show that the equilibrium state\nis by far the largest state; (b) adopt a time average interpretation\nof probability; and (c) assume that the system in question is\nergodic. It then follows that the system is most likely to be found in\nequilibrium, which justifies (a probabilistic version of) the Second\nlaw.\n\nThree objections have been levelled against this line of thought.\nFirst, it is pointed that assuming ergodicity is too strong in two\nways. The first is that it turns out to be extremely difficult to\nprove that the systems of interest really are ergodic. Contrary to\nwhat is sometimes asserted, not even a system of \\(n\\) elastic hard\nballs moving in a cubic box with hard reflecting walls has been proven\nto be ergodic for arbitrary \\(n\\); it has been proven to be ergodic\nonly for \\(n \\le 4\\). To this charge one could reply that what looks\nlike defeat to some, appears to be a challenge to others. Progress in\nmathematics may eventually resolve the issue, and there is at least\none recent result that justifies optimism: Simanyi (2004) shows that a\nsystem of \\(n\\) hard balls on a torus of dimension 3 or greater is\nergodic, for an arbitrary natural number \\(n\\).\n\nThe second way in which ergodicity seems to be too strong is that even\nif eventually we can come by proofs of ergodicity for the relevant\nsystems, the assumption is too strong because there are systems that\nare known not to be ergodic and yet they behave in accordance with the\nSecond Law. Bricmont (2001) investigates the Kac Ring Model and a\nsystem of \\(n\\) uncoupled anharmonic oscillators of identical mass,\nand points out that both systems exhibit thermodynamic behaviour and\nyet they fail to be ergodic. Hence, ergodicity is not necessary for\nthermodynamic behaviour. Earman and Redei (1996, p. 70) and van Lith\n(2001, p. 585) argue that if ergodicity is not necessary for\nthermodynamic behaviour, then ergodicity cannot provide a satisfactory\nexplanation for this behaviour. Either there must be properties other\nthan ergodicity that explain thermodynamic behaviour in cases in which\nthe system is not ergodic, or there must be an altogether different\nexplanation for the approach to equilibrium even for systems which are\nergodic.\n\nIn response to this objection, Vranas (1998) and Frigg and Werndl\n(2011) argue that most systems that fail to be ergodic are\n\u2018almost ergodic\u2019 in a specifiable way, and this is good\nenough. We discuss Vranas\u2019 approach below when discussing\nGibbsian SM since that is the context in which he has put forward his\nsuggestion. Werndl and Frigg (2015a, 2015b) offer an alternative\ndefinition of Boltzmannian equilibrium and exploit the ergodic\ndecomposition theorem to show that even if a system is not ergodic it\nwill spend most of the time in equilibrium, as envisaged by Boltzmann\n(roughly the ergodic decomposition theorem says that the phase space\nof every measure preserving system can be partitioned into parts so\nthat the dynamics is ergodic on each part; for details see Petersen\n1983). Frigg (2009) suggested exploiting the fact that almost all\nHamiltonian systems are non-integrable, and that these systems have\nso-called Arnold webs, i.e., large regions of phase space on which the\nmotion of the system is ergodic. Lavis (2005) re-examined the Kac ring\nmodel and pointed out that even though the system is not ergodic, it\nhas an ergodic decomposition, which is sufficient to guarantee the\napproach to equilibrium. He also challenged the assumption, implicit\nin the above criticism, that providing an explanation for the approach\nto equilibrium amounts to identifying one (and only one!) property\nthat all systems have in common. In fact, it may be the case that\ndifferent properties are responsible for the approach to equilibrium\nin different systems, and there is no reason to rule out such\nexplanations. In sum, the tenor of all these responses is that even though\nergodicity simpliciter may not have the resources to explain\nthe approach to equilibrium, somewhat qualified properties do.\n\nThe second objection is that even if ergodicity obtains, this is not\nsufficient to give us what we need. As we have seen above, ergodicity\ncomes with the qualification \u2018almost everywhere\u2019. This\nqualification is usually understood as suggesting that sets of measure\nzero can be ignored without detriment. The idea is that points falling\nin a set of measure zero are \u2018sparse\u2019 and can therefore be\nneglected. The question of whether or not this move is legitimate is\nknown as the \u2018measure zero problem\u2019.\n\nSimply neglecting sets of measure zero seems to be problematic for\nvarious reasons. First, sets of measure zero can be rather\n\u2018big\u2019; for instance, the rational numbers have measure\nzero within the real numbers. Moreover, a set of measure zero need not\nbe (or even appear) negligible if sets are compared with respect to\nproperties other than their measures. For instance, we can judge the\n\u2018size\u2019 of a set by its cardinality or Baire category\nrather than by its measure, which leads us to different conclusions\nabout the set\u2019s size (Sklar 1993, pp. 182\u201388). It is also\na mistake to assume that an event with measure zero cannot occur. In\nfact, having measure zero and being impossible are distinct notions.\nWhether or not the system at some point was in one of the special\ninitial conditions for which the space and time mean fail to be equal\nis a factual question that cannot be settled by appeal to measures;\npointing out that such points are scarce in the sense of measure\ntheory does resolve the problem because it does not imply that they\nare scarce in the world as well.\n\nIn response two things can said. First, discounting sets of measure\nzero is standard practice in physics and the problem is not specific\nto ergodic theory. So unless there is a good reason to suspect that\nspecific measure zero states are in fact important, one might argue\nthat the onus of proof is on those who think that discounting them in\nthis case is illegitimate. Second, the fact that SM works in so many\ncases suggests that they indeed are scarce.\n\nThe third criticism is rarely explicitly articulated, but it is\nclearly in the background of contemporary Boltzmannian approaches to\nSM such as Albert\u2019s (2000), which reject Boltzmann\u2019s\nstarting point, namely the postulate \\(p(M_j) = c\\mu(M_j)\\). Albert\nintroduces an alternative postulate, essentially providing transition\nprobabilities between two macrostates conditional on the so-called\nPast Hypothesis, the posit that the universe came into existence in a\nlow entropy state (the Big Bang). Albert then argues that in such an\naccount erogidicity becomes an idle wheel, and hence he rejects it as\ncompletely irrelevant to the foundations of SM. This, however, may\nwell be too hasty. Although it is true that ergodicity simpliciter\ncannot justify Albert\u2019s probability postulate, another dynamical\nassumption is needed in order for this postulate to be true (Frigg\n2010).\n",
