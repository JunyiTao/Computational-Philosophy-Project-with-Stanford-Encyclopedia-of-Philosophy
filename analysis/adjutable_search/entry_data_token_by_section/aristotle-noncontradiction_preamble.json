    "main_text": "\n\nAccording to Aristotle, first philosophy, or metaphysics, deals with\nontology and first principles, of which the principle (or law) of\nnon-contradiction is the firmest. Aristotle says that without the\nprinciple of non-contradiction we could not know anything that we do\nknow. Presumably, we could not demarcate the subject matter of any of\nthe special sciences, for example, biology or mathematics, and we\nwould not be able to distinguish between what something is, for\nexample a human being or a frog, and what it is like, for example pale\nor green. Aristotle\u2019s own distinction between essence and\naccident would be impossible to draw, and the inability to draw\ndistinctions in general would make rational discussion impossible.\nAccording to Aristotle, the principle of non-contradiction is a\nprinciple of scientific inquiry, reasoning and communication that we\ncannot do without.\n\nAristotle\u2019s main and most famous discussion of the principle of\nnon-contradiction occurs in Metaphysics IV (Gamma) 3\u20136,\nespecially 4. There are also snippets of discussion about the\nprinciple of non-contradiction early in the corpus, for example in\nDe Interpretatione, and there is the obscure chapter 11 of\nPosterior Analytics I, but none of these rival\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of the principle of non-contradiction in\nMetaphysics IV. The discussion below mostly concerns the main\ninterpretative and philosophical issues that arise from reading\nMetaphysics IV 3\u20136.\n\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the principle of non-contradiction\nalso raises thorny issues in many areas of modern philosophy, for\nexample, questions about what we are committed to by our beliefs, the\nrelationship between language, thought and the world, and the status\nof transcendental arguments. Arguments from conflicting appearances\nhave proved remarkably long-lived, and debates about skepticism,\nrealism and anti-realism continue to this day.\n",
