    "main_text": "Faith as doxastic venture\n7. Faith as doxastic venture\n\nThere are significant differences, however, between the trusting\ninvolved in theistic faith and that involved in interpersonal trust.\nFor one thing, trusting would seem not to risk any possibility of\ndisappointment if God really is the trustee. Given the existence of\nthe God of unchanging love, one trusts in ultimately perfect safety.\nBut the venture of actually entrusting oneself to God seems to begin\nwith the challenge of being able to believe or accept that, indeed,\nthere is such a God. While some affirm that this claim is a matter of\nbasic knowledge, and some that there is sufficient evidence to justify\nit, others, as already noted, hold that everyone has to confront the\nevidential ambiguity of foundational theistic claims. For those who\nreject the model of theist faith as basic knowledge and also think\nthat the question of God\u2019s existence cannot be settled\nintellectually on the basis of the available evidence, the venture\ninvolved in trusting in God (if such there be) may seem to include a\ndoxastic venture: those who trust already venture beyond the\navailable evidence, in their very believing or\naccepting that God exists and may be relied on for salvation.\nTrusting in God seems to presuppose, in other words, trusting\nthat God exists. But, if so, the question becomes pressing\nwhether, and under what conditions, one may be entitled to such an\nevidence-transcending venture in practical commitment to a particular\nview of ultimate reality and its implications for how we should\nlive.\n\nTheological non-realism\n\nOne way to relieve this pressure is to offer a non-realist\nanalysis of theological claims. Trusting God will then not entail any\ncommitment to reality\u2019s being a certain way. Rather, on\narguably the most sophisticated kind of non-realist view, theological\nbeliefs arise because living \u2018trustingly\u2019 comes to be\nexpressed and reinforced through a culturally constructed fiction\nabout God and his great saving acts. This existential confidence may\nthen be described, using the language of the fiction, as\n\u2018trusting God\u2019 (Cupitt 1980, Geering 1994). On such a\nnon-realist account, the model of faith as trust brackets the\ncognitive component of faith, and risks becoming, in effect, a model\nof faith as purely a certain kind of affective state. But, in any\ncase, non-realist models will be rejected by those who take faith to\nhave a cognitive component that functions as a grasping\u2014or\nwould-be grasping\u2014of how things really are.\n\nDefending doxastic venture by analogy with interpersonal\ntrust?\n\nAssuming, then, that theist faith does include (under realist\nassumptions) a venture in practical commitment to truth-claims about\nultimate reality, the justifiability of such a venture might yet be\nthought defensible by analogy with interpersonal situations where\npractical commitment seems justifiably to be made beyond one\u2019s\nevidence to the claim that a person will prove trustworthy in some\nrelevant respect. Reflecting on that proposal discloses further points\nof disanalogy, however. In cases of interpersonal trust, a venture is\noften needed in initially taking the trustee to be\ntrustworthy, but evidence will inevitably later emerge which will\neither confirm or disconfirm the truth of that claim, and trust may,\nand rationally should, be withdrawn if the news is bad. But\nif\u2014as we are here assuming\u2014one ventures beyond evidential\nsupport in taking it to be true in practical reasoning that God exists\nand may be trusted for salvation, this may be a venture that is not\nconfined to initial commitment but rather persists in needing to be\nmade. This will be the case on accounts of the evidential ambiguity of\ntheism that take the ambiguity to hold in principle, ruling out any\npossibility of evidential disambiguation. Those accounts may grant, of\ncourse, that continuing to journey in theistic faith may\npsychologically reinforce one\u2019s commitment, providing subjective\nconfirmation that the theist view of reality is correct. Yet these\nreinforcing experiences, which often involve faith renewed in the face\nof apparent failures of divine love, do not possess the\nuncontroversial status of evidence that independently and\ninter-subjectively confirms the initial venture.\n\nDoxastic venture without doxastic voluntarism\n\nMany dismiss the idea that one may venture in one\u2019s very\nbelieving that God exists as committing a category error: ventures are\nvoluntary, but propositional belief is not directly under voluntary\ncontrol. Trusting God, however, entails practical commitment to\nthe truth of theological faith-propositions, and commitment to\nthe truth of a proposition in one\u2019s practical reasoning\nmay be under direct voluntary control.\n\nIt is one thing to be in the mental state of holding that the\nproposition that p is true; it is another to take it to be\ntrue that p in one\u2019s practical reasoning (although\nthese typically go together, since to hold that p is true is\nto be disposed to take it to be true that p in\npractical reasoning whenever the question whether p becomes\nsalient). Practical commitment to a faith-proposition\u2019s truth\ntherefore could be a venture: there is no category error in\nallowing this possibility. Doxastic venturing\u2014venturing in\nbelieving\u2014is thus not a matter of willing oneself to believe\nwithout adequate evidential support; rather it is a matter of taking\nan already held belief to be true in one\u2019s practical\nreasoning even though (as one may oneself recognise) its truth lacks\nsuch support.\n\nThe psychological possibility of doxastic venture\n\nSome philosophers have argued, however, that one cannot (in full\nreflective awareness, anyway) believe that p while accepting\nthat one has insufficient evidence for p\u2019s truth (Adler\n2002). The counterclaim that this is possible is defended by William\nJames, in his controversial 1896 lecture, \u2018The Will to\nBelieve\u2019 (James 1896 [1956]). James agrees that belief cannot be\ndirectly willed and must be otherwise causally evoked (he later came\nto wish that he had used \u2018The Right to Believe\u2019 as his\nlecture\u2019s title). James observes, however, that many beliefs\nhave causes that do not constitute or imply an evidential grounding of\ntheir truth. James labels such causes\n\u2018passional\u2019\u2014again, a potentially misleading term,\nsince its intended referents include much more than emotional causes\nof belief. In particular, beliefs may be caused by \u2018the\ncircumpressure of one\u2019s caste or set,\u2019 of which\none\u2019s inherited religious tradition is a paradigm case (James\n1896 [1956, 9]). James is thus able to explain the psychological\npossibility of doxastic venture: one already has a\n\u2018passionally\u2019 caused belief, which one then takes to be\ntrue in practical reasoning despite its lack of adequate evidential\ngrounding (compare Creel 1994, who similarly describes\n\u2018faith\u2019 as a \u2018non-evidential doxastic\npassion\u2019).\n\nNote that a doxastic venture model of theistic faith reconciles faith\nas gift with faith\u2019s active components: taking a\nfaith-proposition to be true in practical reasoning is a basic\n(mental) action (which leads on to further actions involved in\ntrusting God and seeking to do God\u2019s will); the gift provides\nthe motivational resources for this basic action, namely a firm belief\nin the truth of the faith-proposition, despite its lack of adequate\nevidential support. (In the next section, the possibility is\nconsidered that the gift of these motivational resources might be\neffective yet not amount to actual belief.) It is also worth noting\nthat those who find the focus on the individual something of a\ndeficiency in analytical accounts of faith (Eklund 2015) may perceive\nin James\u2019 account some acknowledgment of the social aspect of\nfaith. Arguably, the standard \u2018passional\u2019 or\n\u2018non-evidential\u2019 cause of religious belief is cultural\nimmersion within an historical faith-tradition. The motivational\nresources for faith-commitment may thus be an essentially social\npossession.\n\nExamples of doxastic venture models\n\nOn the doxastic venture model, faith involves full practical\ncommitment to a faith-proposition\u2019s truth, despite the\nrecognition that this is not \u2018objectively\u2019 justified on\nthe evidence. Kierkegaard\u2019s definition of faith as \u2018an\nobjective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation process of the\nmost passionate inwardness\u2019 in Concluding Unscientific\nPostscript (Kierkegaard 1846 [1968, 180]) is an example of a\ndoxastic venture model. So too is Paul Tillich\u2019s account of\nfaith as \u2018the state of being ultimately concerned\u2019, since\nthe claim of the object of one\u2019s ultimate concern to\n\u2018promise total fulfilment even if all other claims have to be\nsubjected to it or rejected in its name\u2019 cannot in principle be\nestablished on the basis of the evidence (Tillich 1957 [2001, 1 and\n21]).\n\nAquinas\u2019s model of faith, though widely thought of as conforming\nto an evidential requirement on belief, may arguably be open to\ninterpretation as a doxastic venture model. As noted in Section 5,\nAquinas holds that the available evidence, though it supports the\ntruth of foundational faith-propositions, does not provide what\nAquinas counts as sufficient (i.e., demonstrative) support to justify\ninner assent (in addition to references to the Summa\nTheologiae given previously, see 2a2ae. 2, 1 (Aquinas [2006],\n63); and compare also Penelhum 1989, 120). Now, whether practical\ncommitment to the truth of a given faith-proposition does or does not\nventure beyond adequate evidential support will be relative to\nassumptions about (a) where the level of evidential support required\nfor \u2018adequacy\u2019 should be set, and (b) just how firm and\ndecisive propositional faith-commitment needs to be. On some such\nassumptions, for example those made by Bayesians, the support provided\nby the evidence Aquinas adduces\u2014or, by a suitable contemporary\nupgrading of that evidence such as that provided in the works of\nRichard Swinburne\u2014may be considered enough to make reasonable a\nsufficiently high degree of belief (or credence) in the truth of\ntheistic faith-propositions so that believers need not venture beyond\nthe support of their evidence. Interpreting Aquinas\u2019s model of\nfaith as conforming to evidentialism may thus be viable. Nevertheless,\nAquinas\u2019s own assumptions on these matters may leave him closer\nto Kierkegaard and Tillich than is commonly thought (consider\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae 4, 1 and, once again, 2a2ae 6, 1\n(Aquinas [2006], 117\u20139 & 167)).\n\nThe special role of faith-propositions\n\nBayesians might argue that there is no occasion for faith as doxastic\nventure since, once practical commitment to the truth of propositions\nis recognised as a matter of degree, whatever the state of the\navailable evidence relating to a given proposition, there will always\n(given initial credences) be a rational credence properly associated\nwith that evidence, and hence there are no possible circumstances\nwhere \u2018the evidence does not decide\u2019, so that an\nevidentialist requirement can indeed apply universally. Note, however,\nLara Buchak\u2019s (2012, 2018) discussion of ways in which Bayesians\nmight understand faith as going beyond the evidence, and her own\nproposal that faith-ventures essentially include an\nadditional practical commitment, which may be rational under\ncertain conditions, not to inquire further into evidence relevant to\nthe truth of the propositions concerned for the sole purpose of\ndeciding what to do. (For critical discussion of this kind of\nrestriction on inquiry in connection with faith commitments, see\nDormandy 2018 and Howard-Snyder and McKaughan 2022a. Katherine\nDormandy has recently proposed a positive defence of evidentialism in\nconsidering the question of what makes it good to form positive\nbeliefs about those you have faith in, including God (Dormandy\n2022).)\n\nIf the domain of faith is, as Stephen Evans puts it, \u2018the\nassumptions, convictions and attitudes which the believer brings\nto the evidence for and against religious truth\u2019 (Evans\n1985, 178), and faith\u2019s cognitive component offers a\n\u2018total interpretation\u2019 of the world of our experience\n(Hick 1966, 154), then (foundational) faith-propositions function as\n\u2018highest-order framing principles\u2019 which\nnecessarily cannot have their truth settled by appeal to the\nforce of a body of independent evidence (Bishop 2007a, 139\u201344).\nTaking such a faith-proposition to be true, then, is not something\nthat comes in degrees: either one \u2018buys into\u2019 the overall\nworldview (foundational) faith-propositions propose, or one does not.\nSuch a choice is existentially important, and settling it raises\nanxiety about exercising a responsibility that cannot\u2014without\n\u2018bad faith\u2019\u2014be transferred onto the relatively\nimpersonal function of one\u2019s reason, since a venture beyond any\ninter-subjectively rational evidential confirmation is required. The\ndoxastic venture model may thus be regarded as capturing the spiritual\nchallenge of faith more satisfactorily than do models that conform to\nevidentialism. This is because, on the doxastic venture model, faith\ninvolves a deeper surrender of self-reliant control, not only in\ntrusting God, but in accepting at the level of practical commitment\nthat there is a God\u2014indeed, this God\u2014who is to be\ntrusted.\n\n\nDoxastic venture models of faith and epistemic concern\n\nDoxastic venture in relation to faith-propositions can be justifiable,\nof course, only if there are legitimate exceptions to the\nevidentialist requirement to take a proposition to be true just to the\nextent of its evidential support\u2014and only if the legitimate\nexceptions include the kind of case involved in religious, theistic,\nfaith-commitment.\n\nA possible view of theistic faith-commitment is that it is wholly\nindependent of the epistemic concern that cares about evidential\nsupport. On this view, faith reveals its authenticity most clearly\nwhen it takes faith-propositions to be true contrary to the\nweight of the evidence. This view is widely described as\n\u2018fideist\u2019, but ought more fairly to be called\narational fideism, or, where commitment contrary to the\nevidence is positively favoured, irrational or\ncounter-rational fideism. Despite its popular attribution\nboth to the church father Tertullian and to \u2018the father of\nexistentialism\u2019, Kierkegaard, counter-rational fideism does not\nseem to have been espoused by any significant theist philosophers\n(passages in Tertullian and Kierkegaard that appear to endorse this\nposition may be interpreted as emphasizing that Christian faith\nrequires accepting, not logical contradiction, but\n\u2018contradiction\u2019 of our \u2018natural\u2019 expectations,\nwholly overturned in the revelation that the power of divine love is\ntriumphant in the Crucified One).\n\nSerious philosophical defence of a doxastic venture model of faith\nthus implies a moderate version of fideism, for which epistemic\nconcern is not overridden and for which, therefore, it is a constraint\non faith-commitment that it not accept what is known, or\njustifiably believed on the evidence, to be false. Rather, faith\ncommits itself only beyond, and not against, the\nevidence\u2014and it does so out of epistemic concern to\ngrasp truth on matters of vital existential importance. The thought\nthat one may be entitled to commit to an existentially momentous\ntruth-claim in principle undecidable on the evidence when forced to\ndecide either to do so or not is what motivates William James\u2019s\n\u2018justification of faith\u2019 in \u2018The Will to\nBelieve\u2019 (James 1896 [1956]). If such faith is to be justified,\nits cognitive content will (on realist assumptions) have to cohere\nwith our best evidence-based theories about the real world. Faith may\nextend our scientific grasp of the real, but may not counter it.\nWhether the desire to grasp more truth about the real than science can\nsupply is a noble aspiration or a dangerous delusion is at the heart\nof the debate about entitlement to faith on this moderate fideist\ndoxastic venture model.\n\nA discussion of the debate between the moderate, Jamesian, fideist and\nthe evidentialist is beyond this entry\u2019s scope. Still, it is\nworth remarking that those who think that faith understood as doxastic\nventure may be justified as reasonable face the challenge of providing\nthe tools for weeding out intuitively unreasonable forms of faith. On\nthe other side, those evidentialists who reject doxastic venture as\nalways impermissible have to consider whether taking a stance on the\nnature of reality beyond anything science can even in principle\nconfirm may not, in the end, be unavoidable, and potentially\nimplicated in the commitments required for science itself (see Bishop\n2007a, Chapters 8 and 9; Bishop 2023).
