    "main_text": "The Structure of Appearance || Goodman\u2019s Own Construction\n4.3 Goodman\u2019s Own Construction\nIn contrast to Carnap, Goodman begins from a realist basis,\nconsidering the example of a system built on phenomenal qualities,\nso-called qualia (phenomenal colors, phenomenal sounds, etc.) and thus\nfaced the problem of concretion: how can concrete experiences\nbe built up from abstract particulars?\nIn the visual realm, a concretum is a color-spot moment,\nwhich may be construed as the sum of a color, a visual-field place and\na time, all of which stand in a peculiar relation of togetherness.\nGoodman adopts this relation as a primitive and then shows how, by\nmeans of it, it is possible to define the concept of the concrete\nindividual as well as the various relations of qualification in which\nqualia and certain sums of qualia stand to the fully or partially\nconcrete individuals that exhibit them.\nAfter this is done, Goodman faces his second major constructional\nobjective. He has to order the qualia into different categories. The\nproblem is to construct for each of the categories (color, time,\nplace, and so forth) a map that assigns a unique position to each\nquale in the category, and that represents the relative likeness of\nqualia by nearness in position. The solution to the problem requires\nin each case the specification of a set of terms by means of which the\norder at hand can be described, and then the selection of primitives\nsuitable to define them. Goodman thereby shows how predicates\nreferring to size and shape of phenomenal concreta may be introduced,\nand he suggests briefly some approaches to the definition of the\ndifferent categories of qualia by reference to their structural\ncharacteristics.\nGoodman shows in SA how using a mereological system can help to\navoid the difficulty of imperfect community for a system built on a\nrealist base (such as SA), as well as for a system built on a\nparticularistic base (such as Der logische Aufbau der Welt).\nThe constant companionship difficulty, on the other hand, does not\narise in SA because no two concreta can have all their qualities in\ncommon.\n",
