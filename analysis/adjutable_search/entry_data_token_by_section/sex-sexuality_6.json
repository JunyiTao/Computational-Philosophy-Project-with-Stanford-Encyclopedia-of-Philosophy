    "main_text": "Normative Issues || Sex and Morality\n2.2 Sex and Morality\n\nSexual activity is either morally permissible or impermissible.\nNatural Law philosophers (whose stance can be aptly described as\nconservative) think that sexual acts are permissible only in\nparticular contexts, especially in marital or love relationships. Many\ntake their cue from Aristotle and Aquinas to argue that our bodily\norgans have a telos that dictates to what ends we should pursue sexual\nactivity. Edward Feser (2015), for example, defends \u201cthe\nperverted faculty argument,\u201d according to which to flourish we\nmust follow the procreative ends of our sexual organs, which include\nnot only begetting children but also raising them to adulthood. Human\nbeings who, for example, fornicate or have same-sex sex pervert this\nfaculty. More recently, Feser (2022) has argued that advocates of his\nposition of teleological essentialism approach sexual ethics from\nmetaphysical bases so different from those of liberal philosophers\nthat they are talking past one another.\n\nOther Natural Law philosophers argue that our sexual organs must form\na unity of the two partners in a way compatible with the end of\nprocreation (see Finnis 1993, 2011; George 2003; George & Bradley\n1995; Hsiao 2015; Lee & George 1997; Pruss 2000, 2012). The main\nreasons are the theory\u2019s view of marriage, which, following\nThomas Aquinas, is understood as a basic good, and its view of marital\nsexual acts as reproductive and unitive, as two-in-one flesh\ncommunions. Only marital sex\u2014i.e., sex acts between married\npartners who do it from the specific motive of the good of\nmarriage (what this means, though, is unclear)\u2014is considered\nmorally permissible, even good. Thus, although consent to the sexual\nact is necessary, it is not sufficient: the sex has to be done from\nthe motive of marital unity.\n\nThree prominent objections to the above Natural Law views are (1) that\nthe view of marriage is both undefended and implausible; (2) that the\nconnection between reproduction or biological two-in-one union and the\nmorality of sex is unclear, and (3) that it is unclear why other\ngoods, such as sexual pleasure, are ruled out as basic goods\n(Koppelman 2008; see also Biggar & Black 2000). Recently, Kurt\nBlankschaen (2020) has argued that Natural Law has the internal\nresources to not condemn same-sex sex because we can view the unitive\naspect of sex as a genus with various species, one of which is\nprocreation, much like the genus of tree bark is to protect trees, but\nsuch that some do so by photosynthesis while others do not.\n\nMarriage need not be the only context to which sex ought to be\nconfined. Non-Natural Law philosophers have considered love to be such\na context (most importantly Roger Scruton 1986). A view confining sex\nto love need not insist also on only two partners to the relationship,\nor on being of different sex/gender. It requires only the presence of\nlove. Other versions require only affection or a mutually respectful\nrelationship (Hampton 1999; Nussbaum 1995). On such views, consensual\ncasual sex between two strangers is impermissible.\n\nWhy must factors such as love and a mutually respectful relationship\nbe present for the permissibility of sex? One prominent reason is that\nsex is somehow morally dangerous. Sex might make us treat our sexual\npartners as objects, and the power of sex might make us engage in sex\nwith the wrong people, in the wrong circumstances, etc. So something\nis needed to minimize or erode this danger. Love or a respectful\nrelationship minimizes these risks (Nussbaum 1995, 227\u2013231).\n\nAlan Soble, addressing Martha Nussbaum\u2019s (1995) view that\nobjectification and respect are compatible with each other, argues\nthat love or a respectful relationship does not prevent lovers or\npartners from objectifying each other during the sex (Soble\n2017b, 304\u2013309; 2022c, 406\u2013411; see below for discussion\nof objectification). Moreover, views about the ability of respect or\nlove to curb sexual objectification might be too optimistic: if sex is\nso powerful or mind-numbing, being in a relationship might not\nattenuate its power or control it effectively (e.g., partners soon\nstart eyeing people outside the relationship).\n\nThere are other normative questions besides the question of when\nsexual activity is permissible:\n\n(1)\nCan sexual activity be assessed as good or bad, not merely\npermissible or impermissible?\n(2)\nAre there sexual obligations\u2014moral obligations to engage in\nsexual activity?\n(3)\nIs sex morally special or do the same general moral rules and\nnorms that apply to nonsexual domains equally apply to sex?\n\n\nThe answer to (1) is \u201cYes.\u201d To give three examples, sexual\nacts can be done generously (e.g., paying extra sexual attention to\none\u2019s partner), caringly (e.g., expressing tenderness), or\nfairly (e.g., performing oral sex on one\u2019s partner because the\npartner performed oral sex on one). Moreover, these generous, caring,\nand fair motives need not compete with the motive of sexual pleasure:\nknowing that one\u2019s partner enjoys the extra attention, one\nlavishes it on them during the sex. Thus, sexual activity can be\nmorally evaluated as good, not merely permissible (because\nconsensual).\n\nThe language of virtue is relevant here, since acting generously,\ncaringly, or fairly can express virtuous motives (see Halwani 2003,\nch. 3, 2018a, 2018b, ch. 7; Morgan 2003a). Sexual activity, including\nconsensual sexual activity, can also manifest various vices. Consider\nthe following examples.\n\nA student offers their teacher sex for a high grade (the teacher\nconsents).\nA guy has sex with another guy during a wake (neither is directly\nrelated to the dead person).\nLisa hates yet desires Nancy; she wants to sexually humiliate her;\nNancy knows this but desires Lisa, and she does not care. They have\nsex during which Lisa heaps verbal abuse on the trembling-with-desire\nNancy.\nOmar is a handsome gay man who loves having sex with many guys to\nfeed his ego. At the end of the day, all spent, he agrees to a seventh\nhookup because the guy is a catch. He tells the guy, \u201cYou are my\nseventh today, so I might not be very energetic\u201d. The guy says,\n\u201cThis is actually a turn-on\u201d.\nIsabel has undesired sex with her boyfriend so as not to deal with\nhis foul mood (he is not abusive, but accustomed to getting his way),\neven though she knows that she need not agree to sex every time he\nwants it.\n\n\nEach case has the participants\u2019 consent, yet each sexual act is\nbad in some aspect (though not all are seriously wrong) because it\nexhibits a vice: unprofessionalism, intemperance, maliciousness (and\npossibly cruelty and demeaningness; cf. Morgan 2003a), vanity, and\ncowardice, respectively. Thus, consent might not be sufficient for the\nact\u2019s goodness, though perhaps it is for its permissibility\n(depending on the seriousness of the harm or vice).\n\n(2) Sexual and romantic relationships provide the strongest cases for\nsexual obligations, because sexual activity is an expected and crucial\naspect of (especially monogamous) relationships. Note that ordinarily\nthreatening harm to someone unless they have sex is morally wrong, but\nthreats to end a relationship unless the other party has sex\n(\u201cHave sex with me or I will break up with you\u201d) are not\nobviously wrong, further indicating that sexual obligations exist\n(Anderson 2013; Soble 2017a, 2022b; Wertheimer 2003, ch. 12).\n\nThe difficult question is whether there are sexual obligations outside\nsuch relationships. If having sex is a basic need, perhaps plausible\ncases involve a health caretaker alleviating the sexual needs of a\npatient. One can argue that although under the usual conception of\n\u201chealth care professional\u201d (e.g., a nurse) there are no\nsuch duties, society should create a category of such professionals to\nmeet these needs\u2014if they are indeed basic.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that there are positive rights to sex,\nespecially for those who, due to disabilities, are unable to find\nwilling sexual partners without having to pay them. The idea is that\nbecause sexual activity and pleasure with another person are crucial\nto a minimally decent life and not adequately substituted for by\nmasturbation, those who are sexually deprived are entitled to some\nform of partnered sexual activity (Appel 2010; Firth 2019). Others\nhave argued that not all sexually excluded people are disabled and not\nall disabled people are sexually excluded, so the issue of sexual\nexclusion cuts across that of disability (Earp and Moen 2016; Liberman\n2018; Shakespeare 2022).\n\nThe argument for sexual positive rights has been met with resistance\non two fronts. Some have raised concerns about women supplying sex for\nmen given a history of sexism and misogyny, even if the men are\ndisabled (Jeffreys 2008; [see DeBoer 2015 for replies]; Liberman\n2022). Others have argued that such rights to partnered sex imply that\nsome people\u2019s rights to sexual autonomy will be violated, so\nthere are no rights to partnered sex (Danaher 2020; DiNucci 2011,\n2020; Liberman 2022; Srinivasan 2021, ch. 3). The most that is\nconceded is that if there are rights to sex, they are not to partnered\nsex, but to a bundle of services that can help people be more sexually\nincluded, such as validation of a group\u2019s sexuality, sex\neducation, sexual toys and instruments, including sex robots, and even\nprofessional assistance with masturbating or assistance with having\nsex with someone for those who cannot perform these acts on their own\n(the assistants themselves would not be part of the sexual act)\n(Danaher 2020, 2022; DiNucci 2017; Liberman 2022). It is unclear,\nhowever, once sexual partners are off the table, whether what remains\n(e.g., sex education) are proper objects of rights to\nsex.\n\nStill, sexual obligations might exist even without corresponding\nrights, based in general duties of benevolence\u2014attending to\nsomeone\u2019s sexual needs would be similar to attending to\nsomeone\u2019s hunger (Soble 2017a, 454\u201355; 2022b, 546). But it\nis unclear who would fulfill these obligations, what their fulfillment\nwould amount to (is masturbating the beneficiary of the duty enough?),\nand whether the gender and sexual orientation of the parties matters\nor should matter. These are difficult issues, especially since the\nextent to which someone\u2019s sexual needs are properly met does\ndepend on their sexual desires and preferences: a straight man\u2019s\nneeds might not be met by a gay man, and straight women meeting\nmen\u2019s sexual needs is troubling given sexism and sex-based\noppression. Moreover, if X\u2019s sexual need cannot be\nalleviated by X masturbating, how the needs are to be met is\na pressing question, and so is determining the depth of a sexual need\nto see whether it gives rise to an obligation. Ultimately, such sexual\nduties might face the same crucial objection that the right to\npartnered sex faces, namely, that people\u2019s right to sexual\nautonomy is so important that it is incompatible with the existence of\nsexual duties.\n\nEven if we have no obligations to satisfy others\u2019 sexual needs,\nwe might nevertheless have sexual obligations to ourselves to develop\nor dampen certain sexual preferences. Pedophiles, for example, might\nhave an obligation to change their preferences, not merely to refrain\nfrom acting on them. Other examples include obligations to change\none\u2019s preferences (or their lack) for, say, members of a\nparticular race, ethnic group, age group, body type, etc. These are\nmore controversial, however, because it is not clear that such\npreferences are bad to begin with (Barn 2022; Halwani 2017b [2022];\nKershnar 2019; Zheng 2016), and some might not be under our control at\nall (e.g., preference for certain age groups) or as easily changed as\nothers are (e.g., for skin color).\n\n(3) According to Alan Goldman, \u201c[N]o conduct otherwise immoral\nshould be excused because it is sexual conduct, and nothing in sex is\nimmoral unless condemned by rules which apply elsewhere as well\u201d\n(1977, 280). This is true at a general level because the same general\nmoral features (e.g., harm) affect sexual acts. But it might be false\nat more specific levels: sexual violation of the body by a\npenis or an object makes the violation distinct. This has to do with\nhow one experiences sexual bodily violations, thereby making sexual\nconsent a crucial moral aspect of sexual relations (Wertheimer 2003,\n107\u2013112). Moreover, if Kant is right, the objectifying nature of\nsexual desire makes it unique. If virtue ethicists are right, actions\ncan be right and wrong because they are sexually temperate and\nintemperate: seducing the ex-boss\u2019s husband is vengeful or\nintemperate, depending on the motive (Carr 2007; Halwani 2003, ch. 3,\n2018a, 2018b, ch. 7; Piers 1999; see also the essays in SE). The\nspecialness of sex might be explained by sexual desire\u2019s\nrootedness in biology and its being directed at the bodies of other\nhuman beings (Dent 1984: ch. 2 and passim).\n2.2.1 Consent\n\nWhether one is conservative, liberal, or progressive about the\npermissibility of sexual acts, consent looms large. Most philosophers\nbelieve that informed and voluntary consent is necessary and\nsufficient for the moral permissibility of sex (Archard 1998; Mappes\n1987; Miller & Wertheimer 2010; Primoratz 2001; Wertheimer 2003;\nbut see Pateman 1988), though there are dissenters who debate\nconsent\u2019s sufficiency (see below).\n\nConsent is crucial because (a) it transforms an otherwise wrong act\ninto a permissible one (though not necessarily into a good act); (b)\nin heterosexual sex, men and women might importantly differ when it\ncomes to sex; and (c) sexual violation is typically experienced as\nvery harmful (Wertheimer 2003, 119\u2013121).\n\n(a) has been especially important to philosophers. Consent\u2019s\nbeing morally transformative means that it changes an action\u2019s\nmoral status from impermissible to permissible. If John takes a book\nfrom Lisa\u2019s library, the act can be one of robbery or one of\nlending (or gifting) depending on whether Lisa has consented. One\nissue here is whether consent to sexual contact is morally special or\ndifferent from other types of transactions, including nonsexual bodily\ncontact (Chadha 2022, 218\u2013219). For example, is it especially\nimportant to consent to sexual penetration as opposed to, say, a\nshoulder massage or even a colonoscopy? Explanations of the importance\nof sexual consent that rely on our special relationship to our bodies,\nas opposed to our relationship to external objects like books (Gardner\nand Shute 2000), fail to distinguish between consent to sexual bodily\ncontact and consent to nonsexual bodily contact. Perhaps evolutionary\nexplanations are needed (Wertheimer 2003, ch. 2).\n\nThe claim that valid or genuine consent by all the parties to a sex\nact is necessary and sufficient for the moral permissibility of the\nsex act can put as follows:\n\n\nX\u2019s sexual activity with Y is morally\npermissible if, and only if, Y validly consents to the sexual\nactivity.\n\n\nOne crucial question is what it means for Y to validly\nconsent. It seems that Y has to do something, to perform some\naction, that amounts to consent. On the \u201cpurely mental\nview,\u201d the action can be purely mental, such as a thought to the\neffect that \u201cI consent to this act.\u201d But more than mere\nthoughts, decisions, or beliefs might be needed to explain what is\nwrong with cases in which X proceeds to have sex with\nY even though Y, who consents, does not clearly\ncommunicate their consent to X. Hence we get the\n\u201ccommunications view,\u201d according to which X\nwrongs Y if there is no clear communication to proceed with\nthe sexual activity (Chadha 2022; Dougherty 2015, 2018). An important\nissue here is what it would take for Y to clearly communicate\ntheir consent to X. Is enthusiasm, for example, necessary or\nsufficient to convey one\u2019s consent? (Pineau 1989; Dougherty\n2022)\n\nAnother crucial issue is what Y is consenting to exactly when\nY consents to sexual activity. For the consent to be valid,\nthe activity engaged in has to be the one consented to, not some other\nactivity. This seemingly obvious point raises the thorny question of\nwhat constitutes a sexual act and how many acts of consent are needed\nfor a compound or extended sexual act, one that is made up of parts\n(kissing, then oral sex, then penetrative sex, and so on).\n\nThere are additional elements of valid consent, the two most important\nones being lack of coercion and lack of deception. Coercion undermines\nthe voluntary aspect of consent, and deception undermines its informed\naspect (Dougherty 2013; Mappes 1987). Other elements are being of\nsound mind and having the cognitive and emotional maturity to consent\n(Chadha 2022, 223). After all, we can imagine cases in which neither\ncoercion nor deception is involved, yet one is too young or too\ninebriated to consent. If \u201cinformed consent\u201d means simply\nreceiving or having the requisite information, we might need\nadditional criteria like maturity and soundness of mind. If it means\nsomething stronger, such as \u201cproperly processing the\ninformation,\u201d perhaps maturity and soundness of mind are\nredundant. A final element of valid consent might be lack of\nexploitation, especially in unequal relationships, given that the\nstronger party might take advantage of the weaker one despite neither\ncoercing nor deceiving the weaker one (Archard 1994; Mappes 1987; for\ncriticism of Archard\u2019s views, see Boonin 2022).\n\nIs valid consent sufficient for a sexual act\u2019s moral\npermissibility? The views discussed in 2.2 that restrict permissible\nsex to an affectionate, mutually respectful, or marital context take\nconsent to be necessary but not sufficient. Moreover, if sexual desire\nby nature objectifies, as the Kantian view has it, then the consent of\nthe parties is insufficient because consent to sex is consent to a\nwrong action (see 2.2.2).\n\nA different reason for rejecting the sufficiency of consent is harm.\nSetting aside harm to third parties, if sexual activity leads to harm\nto one or more of its parties, then consent might not be sufficient.\nThis view is especially plausible when it comes to women, given that\nmany women engage in consensual sex that is motivated by\nnonsexual desires, such as not wanting to put their partner in a foul\nmood. According to one account, the harm is psychological, especially\nto their autonomy (West 1995). This implies that prostitutes are\nharmed because of their consent to undesired sex, an implausible\nimplication. However, even if specific formulations of the view are\nimplausible (such as West\u2019s; see Soble 1996, 37\u201339;\nWertheimer 2003, passim), this does not negate the plausible\nclaim that if sexual activity harms one or more of the\nconsenting parties, the activity is wrong. One might object that this\nargument is paternalistic, telling people not to engage in sex when\nthe sex is harmful (Soble 1996, 37\u201339). This objection is\ncorrect in that although harmful sex gives the participants a reason\nto not engage in it, it cannot be used to argue that social or legal\nforces should prevent this action (Wertheimer 2003,\n130\u2013131).\n\nDespite disagreement about the sufficiency of consent, the\nnecessity of consent is typically taken for granted by\nphilosophers. But its necessity can be questioned. For instance, if we\naccept a \u201ccasual view\u201d of sexual pleasure, \u201cthat\nsexual pleasure is morally like any other pleasure\u201d (Benatar\n2002, 192; see also Beckwith 2022), consent might not be necessary.\nFor if sexual pleasure is insignificant, a person\u2019s consent may\nbe bypassed if there are cases, bizarre as they might seem, in which\nforcing someone, or not requiring their consent, to have sex with\nanother person might be important or needed (to the former person,\nespecially). This might occur with people with impaired abilities (see\nbelow), or even with minors if an ambitious parent thinks that it is a\ngood idea for their child to experience some sexual activity (not\nnecessarily intercourse) with another person (Benatar 2002,\n194\u2013195).\n\nHowever, we need not accept a single view of sexual pleasure as casual\nor significant; we can instead argue that, depending on between whom\nthe pleasure occurs, it might or might not be casual (Halwani 2022a,\n48\u201351). Moreover, if, as seems to be the case, people\u2019s\nconsidered beliefs about sex are that sex is significant (imagine\nclaiming that incest or sex with animals is \u201ccool\u201d because\nsex is casual), the casual view of sex might very well be wrong, in\nwhich case the consensus surrounding the necessity of consent remains\nintact.\n\nWhy is sex significant? Sex is significant in that it involves\none\u2019s most important private space: one\u2019s body. Suppose\nthat X is a social person, always happy to have guests over\nat X\u2019s house. One day, X discovers that some\npeople have entered X\u2019s apartment and used it to\nentertain themselves. X feels justifiably violated,\nindicating that the violation of private spaces is a serious wrong. If\nthis is true of an apartment, it is true of one\u2019s body,\nespecially since sexual violation usually involves the insertion of\nsomething in the body. This explains why sexual violations are\nexperienced as deeply traumatic (Wertheimer 2003, ch.5). Sex is\nsignificant because it pertains to one\u2019s most important and\nprivate space (cf. Brogaard 2015, 188\u2013190). Note that even if\n(or when) sex is significant, it does not follow that it must be\nexperienced only in the context of love or mutually respectful\nrelationship; it can be experienced casually as long as consent is\nsecured.\n\nJohn Gardner (2018) argues that consent might not be necessary to sex\nbecause we usually require consent to things that are done to\nsomeone, whereas sex, at least ideally, involves a mutuality that\nrenders sexual activity a joint activity. Chadha (2020) replies that\njoint actions are made up of sub-actions, for each of which consent is\nnecessary. Gardner could reply that sexual sub-actions are also joint,\nso consent to them is unnecessary. Moreover, even if some are not\njoint, that some are is enough to show that consent is not always\nnecessary for sex. Still, it is unclear why joint activities render\nconsent unnecessary. My participation in synchronized swimming or a\nmusical duet still needs my consent.\n\nPeople with severely impaired cognitive abilities raise complicated\nissues for sexual consent. Assuming that they desire sex but are\nunable to consent, or are unable to communicate it clearly, we are\nfaced with the options of either denying them sex or re-thinking\nconsent in their case, such as relying on the idea of advance consent\n(Bianchi 2022a; 2022b; Director 2019). Andrea Bianchi argues that for\npeople with dementia we need to prioritize their well-being over\nconsent because the issue of their quality of life is of \u201cthe\nupmost importance\u201d (2022b, 365). She relies on the distinction\nbetween consenting to something and assenting with something, the\nlatter of which, used in medical practices, describes \u201ca\nperson\u2019s active willingness to engage in an act, specifically\nwhen they may lack the ability to fully comprehend it (e.g., the\nbenefits and risks)\u201d (2022b, 363\u2013364). If Bianchi is\nright, only valid consent, not consent as such, would not be necessary\nfor people with dementia to have sex, because assent is still a form\nof rudimentary consent. One difficulty with the argument is that valid\nconsent might be seen as important for someone\u2019s well-being as\nmuch as, if not more than, satisfying their desires is, so basing the\nargument on the priority of well-being might take us only so far.\n2.2.2 Objectification\n\nObjectification is a perennial issue in the philosophy of sex. It\noriginates in Kant\u2019s moral philosophy, and many feminists have\nadopted the language of objectification to criticize, for example,\npornography; though whereas Kant was concerned with the objectifying\nnature of sexual desire, feminists do not target sex as such, but only\nin the context of patriarchy, claiming that it involves the sexual\nobjectification of women by men in certain contexts (see below; some\nclaim that all heterosexual sex is poison under patriarchy, e.g.,\nDworkin 1987). Indeed, sexual desire might not be necessary for the\nclaim that a woman is sexually objectified under patriarchy: a man\nneed not sexually desire a woman to catcall her.\n\nSexual objectification is treating or considering a person\nonly as a sex object. Casual sex, watching pornography,\ncatcalling, ogling, and other examples all allegedly involve sexual\nobjectification. The \u201conly\u201d is important because otherwise\nthere is no basis for moral complaint given that we frequently treat\neach other as objects. It is unclear whether objectification can\nconsist of mere mental regard or whether it must have a treatment\ncomponent (ogling someone is interesting because it is unclear whether\nit is treatment or mere regard). Some philosophers (Langton 2009;\nNussbaum 1995; Papadaki 2017;) define \u201csexual\nobjectification\u201d broadly enough to include mere regard (others,\ne.g., LeMoncheck [1985, ch. 1] do not). The inclusion of regard is\nwise because objectification seems to involve mere attitudes and\nperceptions (e.g., ogling, the regard found in watching pornography).\nX then sexually objectifies Y if, and only if,\nX treats or regards Y only as a sexual object.\n\nThe importance of objectification stems from a view of human beings as\nmore than objects (LeMoncheck 1985, ch. 1; Papadaki 2017). If human\nbeings, regardless of individual merit, have elevated moral status in\nvirtue of having rationality, dignity, autonomy, or some such\nproperty, reducing someone to a lower level is wrong. But how\ncommon the actual occurrence of sexual objectification and\nhow serious it is, are additional questions. It seems rare to\ntreat our sexual partners as mere objects in any obvious and troubling\nways: not only are we aware of their humanity, we are also attentive\nto it. Indeed, among the various ways of\nobjectification\u2014instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness,\nfungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity (this\nis Nussbaum\u2019s list [1995, 257]; cf. Langton 2009,\n228\u2013229)\u2014only instrumentality is common. Others, such as\nownership and denial of subjectivity, seem rare (Halwani 2017a;\nHalwani 2022b). Clear cases of sexual objectification include\nsexually-motivated rape and catcalling.\n\nThe Kantian view is that sexual desire objectifies by its nature and\nmakes it impossible for the sexual partners to satisfy the Categorical\nImperative: \u201cAct in such a way that you treat humanity, whether\nin your own person or in the person of another, always at the same\ntime as an end and never simply as a means\u201d (Kant 1785 [1981],\n429). Equally problematic on this view is X objectifying\nX\u2019s self\u2014usually through masturbation or allowing\nX\u2019s self to be objectified by Y. Kant\nconsidered duties to the self to be important and his treatment of\nobjectification clearly includes duties to the self: when a human\nbeing has sex for the mere pleasure of it, he \u201csurrenders his\npersonality (throwing it away), since he uses himself merely as a\nmeans to satisfy an animal impulse\u201d (1797 [1996], 6: 425; see\nalso Kant 1930 [1963], 162\u2013168; Soble 2017b, 309\u2013313;\n2022c, 411\u2013415)]. The prohibition on allowing one\u2019s own\nself to be objectified, in addition to the focus on the nature of\nsexual desire, is what sets the Kantian view apart from other views of\nobjectification, especially feminist ones.\n\nSexual desire objectifies by its nature because when X\nsexually desires Y, X desires Y\u2019s\nbody and body parts, especially the sexual ones, making it hard, if\nnot impossible, to treat the humanity in Y as an end (Kant\n1930 [1963, 164]). Only sexual desire among our inclinations is\ndirected at human beings as \u201cflesh,\u201d not \u201ctheir work\nand services\u201d (Kant 1930 [1963, 163]). Although it is morally\npermissible to use each other for all sorts of purposes as long as\nthey involve our \u201cwork and services,\u201d sexual interactions\nare different. In almost every interaction with each other, we are\ninterested in some ability, talent, or service that another can\nperform, an aspect intimately connected to their rationality. In these\ncases, either X does not desire Y\u2019s body (but\nY\u2019s abilities, talents, or services) or X\ndesires it but as a vehicle of Y\u2019s abilities.\nOnly with sexual desire (and, Kant says, in the rare case of\ncannibalism; 1930 [1963, 162\u201363]) does X desire\nY as a body, as an object. X wants to enjoy\nY\u2019s body, not Y\u2019s beautiful voice,\nmassaging abilities, or computer skills (and if X does want\nthe latter aspects in the context of sexual desire and activity,\nX wants them insofar as they make Y more sexually\nappealing). Sexual desire renders people objects by reversing\nour normal relationship with their bodies. Their bodies become the\nobjects, not the instruments, of our attention. Kant thought that only\nmarriage can make objectification tolerable (Kant 1930 [1963, 163]),\nthough his argument is implausible (see Soble 2013b, 2017b; Denis\n2001; Wertheimer 2003, 130\u2013135).\n\nConsent is thus not sufficient for permissible sex because consenting\nto sex is consenting to objectification, to something wrong (Soble\n2017b, 303\u2013304). Kant\u2019s view indicates also why including\nregard in a definition of \u201csexual objectification\u201d is\nplausible: even though X and Y treat each other well\nduring sex, they still regard each other as mere sex objects.\n\nThe phenomenology of sexual desire seems to confirm Kant\u2019s\npoint: The \u201cother\u2019s body, their lips, thighs, buttocks,\nand toes, are desired as the arousing parts they are, distinct from\nthe person\u201d (Soble 2013b, 302). During a good sexual act, even\nwith one\u2019s lover, at some point they focus on ass, cock, pussy,\ntits, etc. (Vannoy 1980, 14). Kant\u2019s view that sexual desire and\nactivity are different\u2014perhaps even unique\u2014from other ways\nwe view and interact with other people seems correct, providing\nsupport for the conclusion that sexual desire objectifies.\n\nSexual desire seems also powerful: its pull is strong and its voice\nloud, insisting, and persistent, so much so that people do irrational\nand immoral things to satisfy it. This might be a gendered feature of\nsexual desire, more true of men than of women, though throughout\nhistory, and in today\u2019s popular culture especially, women have\noften been portrayed as sexually insatiable (see Anderson &\nStruckman-Johnson 1998; Soble 2008, ch. 10). Of course, sexual\npartners normally observe limits on how they treat each other: they do\nnot violate each other, treat each other literally as objects, and so\non, exactly because they understand that they may not treat people in\nsuch ways. Thus, sexual desire operates within moral red lines.\n\nThe Kantian problem of objectification cannot be easily solved.\nArguing that there is no objectification because human beings have no\nspecial moral status from which they can be lowered (Soble 2002,\n53\u201363) does not meet Kant on his own grounds (as Soble insists\nin 2013b; 2017b; 2022c). Claiming that parties to the sexual act\nnormally consent to it (Mappes 1987), that objectification is okay as\nlong as the relationship is respectful (Nussbaum 1995, esp.\n227\u2013231), or that sexual partners attend to each other\u2019s\nsexual needs (Goldman 1977, 282\u2013283; Singer 1984, 382) also do\nnot solve the problem because none addresses the nature of sexual\ndesire (Soble 2013b; 2017b; 2022c).\n\nTwo other options are to accept the problem as a problem (but perhaps\nminimize it; Halwani 2017a; 2022b) or to argue that sexual desire\namong human beings is not always objectifying. This is not merely the\nidea, insisted on by the intentionalist view, that sexual desire in\nhuman beings is complex, because a Kantian view of sex can accommodate\nthis point, but that\n\n\nthere is far more to sex than the desire to use another\u2019s body\nin a degrading manner for your selfish pleasure. Even the elements in\nsexual desire closest to this are combined, at least in healthy\npeople, with other elements of human emotion that radically transform\ntheir meaning. (Wood 2008, 227)\n\n\nKant\u2019s view, however, can also accommodate this insight. For\nexample, X might sexually desire Y because\nY is, among other things, a kind person, such that X\nwould not have desired Y otherwise. But once X\ndesires Y, X desires Y\u2019s body and\nbody parts. Sexual desire can be selfish while layered within other\nelements of human emotions, and the Kantian view need not be confined\nto a simplistic view of sexual desire such that it is crassly selfish\nor always acted on in a degrading \u201cmanner\u201d; Kantian sex\ncan be attentive to the other\u2019s needs.\n\nNonetheless, the above idea that sexual desire can be combined with\nhealthy emotions makes it possible that sexual desire is not always\ntoxic, though how remains unclear. To succeed, sexual desire needs to\nbe injected with healthy emotions, and not merely added to them, so\nthat its very nature changes on particular occasions.\n\nOn the Kantian view, not all sexual activity is objectifying:\nsexual activity not stemming from sexual desire might not be\nobjectifying. Even in those cases when sexual activity is\nobjectifying, its seriousness varies: in consensual encounters it\ncompetes with other moral factors, whereas in (sexually motivated)\nrape it is very serious as sexual desire is the primary motive. (The\nmotive is not to sexually objectify someone, as this is rare;\ninstead, X regards Y in a way that is sexually\nobjectifying.)\n\nMoreover, sexual objectification might differ between men and women,\nespecially if men and women experience sex differently. Men experience\nsexual desire more frequently and insistently than women, though both\nare similar in their enjoyment of sexual activity (Ogas and Gaddam\n2011, chs. 3 and 4; Symons 1979, 179; Wertheimer 2003, 38\u201346).\nThus, men might engage in more sexual objectification than do women\ngiven that men think about sex more, ogle others more, and are more\neasily turned on visually. Since during sexual activity both would\nsexually objectify each other roughly equally, men would sexually\nobjectify women overall more than women would men. Men also consume\npornography (straight and gay) far more than women do, so would engage\nin much more sexual objectification than do women (by viewing people\non-screen, by viewing people as mere sexual objects, etc.). It is\nperhaps in this sense that pornography allows women (and men, as\nobjects of other men\u2019s desire) to be objectified.\n\nSome feminists have argued that pornography objectifies women by\ndehumanizing them, and it dehumanizes them by depicting them as mere\nsexual instruments for men (Hill 1987), by depicting their pleasure as\nonly for the men\u2019s (Longino 1980), by endorsing this treatment\n(Longino 1980; Eaton 2007), or by sending the message that all women\nare like those depicted in pornography (Garry 1978). But these claims\nseem unconvincing. Pornography shows both men and women sexually\nenjoying each other, and it is difficult to prove that women\u2019s\npleasure is depicted as merely for the men\u2019s (one might as well\nargue for the reverse) because the scenes themselves do not tell us\nanything (Soble 2002, 19\u201320, 28, 98, 196; 1996, 225\u2013227).\nNor does pornography seem to send messages about the status of women,\nwhether about the depicted women or women in general. Doing so\ndisables the viewer\u2019s ability to imagine the scenes as he wants,\nthereby undermining its own purposes of titillating him (Soble 1996,\n231\u2013234). But pornography enables the sexual objectification of\nwomen by displaying them to the gaze of the male viewer (ditto for men\nin pornography, albeit the gay male gaze). This form of\nobjectification seems innocuous, as long as it is not implicated in\nharm towards women, either individually or as a class (Gruen 2006; see\nalso Eaton 2007).\n\nA deeper form of objectification is found in the view that pornography\nconstructs women\u2019s sexuality in a bad way (MacKinnon 1993;\nDworkin 1974, 1979). It eroticizes patriarchal ways of viewing women,\nso that sexual desire becomes infused with dominance (cf. Morgan\n2003a, 388\u2013390). The sexual desires of young men who routinely\nconsume pornography become desires for the sexual domination of women.\nWomen become socially constructed sexual beings for men, such that men\ndesire them as pornography depicts them\u2014as non-real beings:\n\u201cobjectification comes to define femininity, and one-sidedness\ncomes to define mutuality\u201d (MacKinnon 1993, 26; see Mason-Grant\n2004). This view, however, implausibly neglects sexual desire\u2019s\nbiology, assuming that sexual desire can be fully socially\nconstructed. Moreover, insofar as it is an empirical view, no proper\nevidence has been marshalled in its support (Diorio 2006; Tarrant\n2014).\n\nSexual desire, as we have seen, is sufficient for objectification.\nHowever, it is not necessary. The guy catcalling a woman to feel part\nof the group is an example, and so are pornography directors and\neditors, who, by choosing the angle of the camera and the footage\ncuts, help sexually objectify the performers by presenting them to the\nviewer in particular ways; similar reasoning applies to, say, brothel\nowners. Indeed, women themselves might have few options other than to\nsexually objectify themselves, in a society that values women mostly\nthrough their sexuality (J\u00fctten 2016; Marino 2022a, 2022b). This\nmight be the most pernicious form of sexual objectification in that\nsocial forces direct or pressure (not necessarily force) women to\nadopt such self-identifications or self-presentations to lead better\nlives, though whether they are actually flourishing is harder to\ngauge.\n\nRecently, the concept of \u201cderivatization\u201d has been used to\nexamine sex and sexual practices (Parker 2017; Wolf 2016).\n\n\nTo derivatize something is to portray, render, understand, or approach\na being solely or primarily as the reflection, projection, or\nexpression of another being\u2019s identity, desires, fears, etc. The\nderivatized subject becomes reducible in all relevant ways to the\nderivatizing subject\u2019s existence. (Cahill 2011, 32; see also\n2013)\n\n\nThis view might capture some central feminist problems with\npornography, namely, the depiction of women\u2019s sexuality as\nreflecting men\u2019s sexual desires of women. However,\n\u201cderivatization\u201d seems not to cover all cases (or all\ncases well). Consider a closeted gay man who catcalls a woman only to\nimpress his peers. He objectifies her but does not seem to derivatize\nher. If the reply is that he catcalls that particular woman because\nshe represents not his desires but, say, society\u2019s desires of\nwhat women should look like, then, given that for any sexual situation\none can attribute derivatization to some party or other,\n\u201cderivatization\u201d stands in danger of being empty or too\nbroad to be explanatory.\n2.3 Sexual Perversion\n\nThe most famous contemporary philosophical account is Thomas\nNagel\u2019s psychologically-based view of sexual perversion.\n\u201cNatural\u201d sexual desire involves a multi-leveled mutual\nawareness by two people of each other: X perceives sexual\nexcitement in Y, Y perceives excitement in\nX, X perceives that Y is excited by\nX, and so on (1969, 10\u201312). Sexual desire is complex in\nthat it includes X\u2019s sexual arousal by Y and\nX\u2019s feeling sexual because of Y\u2019s\narousal by X, and so on with higher levels. Sexual\nperversions are then standing preferences for sexual activity that\ndoes not involve such multi-levels of sexual arousal. Since this view\nlocates naturalness and perversion in the agent\u2019s preferences,\nthe sexual act itself need not mirror this structure; only the desires\nneed have this complexity. Thus, it is inaccurate to accuse it of\nbeing sexless (Solomon 1974, 336) or to evaluate it by giving examples\nof non-complex sexual acts (Kupfer 2016, 333).\n\nAlthough this view accommodates some perversions, such as zoophilia,\npedophilia, and \u201cintercourse with \u2026 inanimate\nobjects\u201d because they \u201cseem to be stuck at some primitive\nversion of the first stage of sexual feeling\u201d (Nagel 1969, 14),\nit yields counter-intuitive results: masturbation does not fare well\non this view, depending on whether it insists on the perception of the\nactual (not imaginative) embodiment of desire in another person (Soble\n2013a, 85\u201387). It also misunderstands how perversions usually\nwork: a coprophiliac does not normally desire sex with feces,\nbut to incorporate feces in his sexual act with another, which could\ninvolve multi-levels of perception. Moreover, the account does not\ncapture common intuitions about natural and perverted sex: it goes\nbeyond the plausible idea that the arousal of one partner increases\nthe other\u2019s, to that of multi-layered arousal\u2014an\nunintuitive idea. Similar views rely on the idea that natural sexual\ndesire is interpersonal, such as that it culminates in love (Scruton\n1986, ch. 10) and that it communicates attitudes and feelings (Solomon\n1974; see Halwani 2018b, ch. 9 for discussion).\n\nA non-psychological account of sexual perversion, one closer to folk\nbiology, claims that only reproduction allows us to distinguish\nperversions from non-perversions (Ruddick 1984, 287; cf. Gray 1978).\nThis does not mean that every act has to be reproductive, only that\nnatural sexual desires \u201ccould lead to reproduction in\nnormal physiological circumstances\u201d (Ruddick 1984, 288). Thus, a\nheterosexual couple having intercourse but not intending to procreate\nare not engaging in perverted sex: their desire is of the\nkind that, under \u201cnormal physiological\ncircumstances,\u201d could lead to reproduction (1984, 288).\n\nThe account might have implausible implications, however. Anyone who\nprefers (heterosexual) oral sex to intercourse would be perverted.\nMoreover, any heterosexual couple that incorporate fetish objects,\nurine, feces, and so on, in their sexual intercourse would be\nsexually natural (Gray 1978, 190\u2013192; Primoratz 1999,\n53\u201354). Indeed, coprophilia can sink all the above accounts: two\npeople who exhibit inter-personal attitudes in the form of multi-level\nperceptions, and who have sexual intercourse of the reproductive type,\ncommunicating healthy emotions sincerely, yet use feces in their\nactivity would counter-intuitively not be perverted on any of the\nabove accounts.\n\nEven though explaining perversion in terms of biology seems obvious,\n\u201cperversion\u201d is opposed not only to \u201cnatural,\u201d\nbut also to \u201cnormal,\u201d and the natural and the normal do\nnot fully overlap. Moreover, the concept of \u201cperversion\u201d\ncould refer to many things: the immoral, disgusting, bizarre, and\nbiologically abnormal, among others. Using only one of these to define\n\u201cperversion\u201d will probably fail. It might also be that the\nmethodology of discussing this concept is flawed, failing to account\nfor the concept\u2019s social function (Miller 2010). Thus, some\nphilosophers have proposed to get rid of the concept altogether\n(Priest 1997; Primoratz 1999, ch. 6; Ruse 1988, 197\u2013201).\nRecently, however, a new account of perversion in terms of its\ninhibiting \u201cshared joy, mutual exploration, self-affirmation,\nand union\u201d was offered (Kupfer 2016, 351). But this view seems\nto set the bar too high for what counts as non-perverted.\n\nA good account of perversion might have to be prescriptive, capturing\nthe core of perversion but not necessarily capturing all our beliefs\nabout it (it should explain why our beliefs are mistaken when they\nare). Furthermore, it will likely be a psychological account, a\npreference to have sex with or involving certain types of object that\nare anti-life, such as bodily waste and corpses, and that are\nbiologically odd, such as inter-species sexual intercourse.\nEvolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology would have to play\ncrucial roles.\n2.4 Sex and Technology\n\nThe discussion of sexual exclusion and inclusion has led some\nphilosophers to suggest that sexual needs can be met by sexual robots\nthat can replace the need for partnered sex, especially if the\ntechnology is advanced enough so that sex with the robots provides an\nalmost identical experience to sex with another human being (DiNucci\n2017; McArthur 2017). This raises a few philosophical questions of its\nown. First, if the robots are sophisticated enough, they might be\npersons, which means that they, too, might have rights to sexual\nautonomy, which takes us back to the same issues with rights to\npartnered sex. It also raises the general question of how to morally\ninteract with them (Nyholm 2022; Petersen 2017).\n\nSecond, there are feminist concerns as to what these robots would look\nlike: if they are meant to \u201cappeal to a stereotypical male\ngaze,\u201d then \u201ctheir use might encourage or exacerbate the\nobjectification and dehumanization of actual women\u201d (Liberman\n2022, 458). Another feminist concern, regardless of the robots\u2019\nlook, is that ease of sex with them, and their inability to genuinely\nrefuse sex, might also entrench sexist attitudes toward women,\nespecially that of male entitlement to sex (Danaher, Earp, and\nSandberg 2017; Richardson 2005).\n\nIssues with sex robots do not exhaust those of sex and technology.\nAnother has to do with the effects on our lives of the use of dating\nand hook up apps, weighing their benefits and their costs. While such\napps have allowed people to meet each other with more ease and to be\nselective in their choices, some worry that they allow them to be\ntoo selective, abetting lookism and racist desires (McArthur\n2022a and 2022b; see also Klincewicz, Frank, and Jane 2022). Neil\nMcArthur argues that the benefits are greater than the costs, many of\nwhich can, anyway, be fixed (2022a, 2022b).\n\nMcArthur also argues that technology has given rise to a new sexual\nidentity\u2014digisexuality. Digisexuals are \u201cpeople for whom\nadvanced technologies are an integral part of their preferred sexual\nexperience, and who might not see the need for human sexual partners\nin order to have fulfilling sex\u201d (2022a, 342). McArthur thinks\nthat new identities are a good thing, because they allow like-minded\npeople to find each other, and such identities can help usher in legal\nand social protections (if needed).\n\nIn addition to robots and apps, a third issue with sexual technology\nare \u201cInternet-mediated haptic sex toys capable of remote\ntransmission of tactile sensation\u201d (Arrell 2022, 586). Such\ntechnologies have a large array of benefits, but they raise their own\nproblems, such as third parties hacking the systems and thus having\nsex by deception or assaulting one or more of the parties to the\nsystems, and partners claiming to be something other than who they\nare, such that even if one is not deceived that one is having sex\nwith, say, John, who John says he is, is not who he actually is\n(Sparrow and Karas 2020).\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality technologies (or, more\ngenerally, extended reality technologies) are, according to Robbie\nArrell, more likely than androids to be the future because they are\ncheaper, multi-purposed, can be moved around and stored more easily,\nand they are but a short step from current pornography technology\n(2022, 595). Although these technologies have benefits, they raise the\nmoral worries of deepfakes and the possibility of people coming to\nprefer sex through them than with real-life sex partners (Arrell 2022,\n595\u2013596).\n3. The Value of Sex\n\nWhat is the value of sex? How important (or valuable!) is this value?\nProcreation, love, and pleasure are obvious answers to the first\nquestion. Sex is usually the way to procreate, so sex is valuable\ninsofar as procreation is valuable. But this value is instrumental,\nand it is contingent given technology\u2019s ability to separate\nprocreation from sex. There is also anti-natalism (Schopenhauer 1851,\n1859, ch. 46; Benatar 2006, 2015), which implies that sex has negative\nvalue in its procreative aspect. The value of sex in regard to\nprocreation is thus precarious.\n\nAnother instrumental value of sex is that X\u2019s sexual\ndesire for Y can (help) cause X to love Y\n(Bertocci 1949, ch. 2). Here, sex\u2019s value is contingent on\nlove\u2019s, and, despite sounding strange, the value of romantic\nlove, especially in its early, passionate stages, is not obvious given\nits negative effects on the lover and others. Still, if sex leads to\nthe settled stage of love (via the passionate one), it is valuable for\nthat. Sex can also express love and affection for one\u2019s partner\nand cement their relationship. Natasha McKeever argues that many goods\nof sex\u2014pleasure, union, intimacy, and care\u2014are shared with\nthose of love, so sexual interaction enhances and strengthens the love\n(McKeever 2016; see also McKeever 2017, but see Vannoy 1980: ch. 1).\nEven if true, all this still makes sex\u2019s value dependent on and\ninstrumental to love\u2019s, especially since the two are very\ndifferent (Goldman 1977, 272\u2013275; Soble 2008, ch. 9 [which adds\nmarriage to the mix]; Vannoy 1980, 7\u201312).\n\nDoes sex have intrinsic value? If it does, it is probably sexual\npleasure, as-sensation or as-enjoyment, a pleasure that provides\npeople with a crucial motive for having sex, often with drastic\nconsequences. So then how valuable is the pleasure of sex? Perhaps we\nshould regard our appetite for sex like we do that for food to avoid\nobsessing about it (Russell 1929 [1970, 289]). But can we go\nfurther?\n\nPeople spend much time pursuing projects and activities they enjoy or\nconsider worthwhile. Some do so only when time, work, or family time\npermit, and some do so much of the time (they are, say, independently\nwealthy). Writing, pursuing Hollywood or Bollywood stardom, playing\nchess, swimming, traveling, and, of course, building a family are\nexamples. Other than philosophical far-fetched examples of worthless\npursuits (counting blades of grass, collecting bottle caps), most\nprojects and activities have some worth, unless we are\nwilling to condemn most human beings of having worthless lives.\nPerhaps some projects are more worthwhile than others (though how to\nargue for this is difficult), but almost all have some worth, and an\nintellectual one at that, including what many might consider to be\nmentally passive, such as watching reality television or reading junk\nfiction (Carroll 1998, esp. ch. 1 and 2).\n\nNow consider X, whose life project is the pursuit of sexual\npleasures. X says,\n\n\nI am young, moderately good-looking, and, with current technology, I\ncan easily sexually hook up with others. I enjoy sex, and it makes me\nfeel good. In between bouts of sex, I can see friends, go to the gym,\nmovies, whatever. But my deepest enjoyment\u2014my life-plan, to use\nphilosophical jargon\u2014is to pursue the pleasures of sex.\n\n\nIs there something we can say to prove X wrong, especially if\nX has the talent for something considered more important?\nPerhaps we can claim that pursuing sex is not as worthy as reading\nRussian literature, but even here we are on insecure ground.\n\nOne can argue that X is not using X\u2019s\nintellectual powers. But this underestimates the reliance on intellect\nin sexual pursuits or presumes that such use is unimportant.\nAlternatively, one can argue that X is not using\nX\u2019s intellectual powers deeply or in a theoretical way.\nBut this would rule out many a life as good. One can argue that there\nare more important things in life than pursuing sexual pleasure. But\nX need not live without friends, family, and other important\nthings present in normal lives. One can argue that sex objectifies, so\nit is wrong to make it central to one\u2019s life. But unless one\nwere a die-hard Kantian, the objectification involved in sex can be\nredeemed by other factors.\n\nOne can argue that sexual sensory pleasure \u201cwill not be at the\ncenter of a rational life plan,\u201d and that these pleasures are\n\u201cintermittent and short-lived,\u201d their value ultimately\ndepending \u201centirely on the interpersonal relationships into\nwhich they fit and which constitute their context\u201d (Goldman\n2016: 98). But it is unclear why the pleasures\u2019 brevity and\nintermittency are problems. One can argue that someone who prefers\nmasturbation to sex with others \u201ccould reflect a failure to\nunderstand the importance and value of sex and sexual pleasure\u201d\n(Scanlon 1998, 175) because the importance of sex is its expression in\nrelations with other people (Scanlon seems not to have in mind casual\nor promiscuous sex). But X can have affectionate sexual\nrelationships with others, and friendships, etc., with different\nothers. Even casual hookups have their bonding aspects. Finally, one\ncan argue that sex \u201cachieves a level of passion\u201d with\n\u201cno equal in other forms of interaction,\u201d especially when\nit occurs between lovers\n\n\nit defines a most significant moment of goodness between two people,\nwhere each achieves a most profound moment of affirmation and\nsatisfaction that is inextricably tied to the endeavor to please the\nother (Thomas 1999, 59).\n\n\nBut note how the affirmation and satisfaction here can as easily apply\nto passionate yet love-less sex.\n\nThus, even if pursuing sexual pleasure is not as intellectually\nstimulating as reading classical Arabic poetry, it is not worthless,\nwhether intellectually or non-intellectually, and it is on a par with\nmany other pursuits that people undertake that are far from having\nintellectual depth. Moreover,\n\n\n[I]sn\u2019t being a provider of sexual pleasure an important and\nvaluable attribute, one to be cherished? Maybe we should construct a\ntheory of human dignity based on our sexual capacities \u2026\ninstead of looking for something \u201cfiner\u201d beyond or above\nthe sexual (Soble 2002, 58\u201359).\n\n\nIf X conducts X\u2019s life morally, and if\nX develops some talents or hobbies for those rainy\ndays (sure to come) when X is no longer sexually desirable\nand X\u2019s friends are busy with other things, then\nX\u2019s life is not less worthwhile than most human lives.\nClaiming otherwise is philosophically haughty and pretentious.",
