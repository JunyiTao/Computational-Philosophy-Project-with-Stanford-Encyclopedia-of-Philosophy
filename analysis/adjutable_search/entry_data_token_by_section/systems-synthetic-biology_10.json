Revisiting Classical Philosophical Questions\n\nWith the emphasis on systems and interacting networks, both systems\nand synthetic biology explicitly engage in one of the oldest\nphilosophical discussions on the relationship between the whole and\nits parts, or between holism and reductionism. This section examines\nhow classical questions are reframed in the new light of strategies\nfor large-scale data production and dynamic modeling.\n",
