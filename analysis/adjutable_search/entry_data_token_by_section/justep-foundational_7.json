    "main_text": "Objections to Classical Foundationalism || Doubts about Correspondence and Acquaintance\n3.3 Doubts about Correspondence and Acquaintance\n\nThe direct acquaintance theorist does presuppose the intelligibility\nof a world that has \u201cstructure\u201d independent of any\nstructure imposed by the mind. Without facts that are independent of\nthe thoughts and judgments that represent them, one could not make\nsense of a relation of acquaintance between a person and a fact, a\nrelation that grounds foundational justification. More radical\ncontemporary rejections of foundationalism may well involve\ndissatisfaction with the foundationalist\u2019s implicit commitment\nto a strong realistic correspondence conception of truth as involving\nsome relation to mind-independent facts. A discussion of problems with\nthe correspondence conception and alternatives would take us far\nafield, however. (For more, see the entry on the\n correspondence theory of truth.)\n\nJust as some reject the conception of truth underlying classical\nfoundationalist accounts of foundational justification, so others\nprofess to be bewildered by some of the fundamental concepts employed\nin defining foundational justification. The acquaintance theorist\ntends to have relatively little to say by way of analyzing what direct\nacquaintance is. To be sure, one can try to give someone a feel for\nwhat one is talking about by a method of contrast--e.g., by\ncontrasting one\u2019s awareness of pain with the temporary\ndistraction caused by an engrossing conversation. It is tempting to\nsuppose that for a short time the pain was still present but the\nperson with the pain was no longer aware of the fact that the pain\nexists. This awareness, the acquaintance theorist will argue, is\nobviously something over and above mere belief in the existence of the\npain, as one can believe that one is in a mental state (say a\nsubconscious mental state) without being aware of that state. (Some\nmay find it odd to speak of having a pain without being aware of it;\nin that case, it may help to consider similar cases involving desire,\nhope, fear, or belief.) Like most theories foundationalism will,\nhowever, ultimately rest its intelligibility on an appeal to a basic\nor primitive concept, one that defies further analysis. Just as one\nneeds to end epistemic regresses with foundational justification, the\nfoundationalist will argue, so one needs to end conceptual regresses\nwith concepts one grasps without further definition.\n",
