In the case of set theory, therefore, he wants to show that there's\nno single set-theoretic universe over which our quantifiers range and\nno single relation to which the word \u201cmembership\u201d refers.\nIn Putnam's own terms, there is no single \u201cintended model\u201d\nfor the language of set theory.\n\n\nIn the first few pages of his 1980 paper, \u201cModels and\nReality,\u201d Putnam argues that there is at least one intended model\nfor the language of set theory which satisfies the set-theoretic axiom\n V=L.[44]\n To show\nthis, Putnam begins by assuming that there are only two things which\ncould play a role in fixing the intended model for set-theoretic\nlanguage. First, there are what Putnam calls \u201ctheoretical\nconstraints.\u201d These include the standard axioms of set theory, as\nwell as principles and theories from other branches of science. Second,\nthere are \u201coperational constraints.\u201d These are just the\nvarious empirical observations and measurements that we make in the\ncourse of scientific investigation.\n\n\nGiven these assumptions, Putnam argues that finding an intended\nmodel which satisfies V=L simply requires finding a model of ZF+V=L\nwhich satisfies the relevant theoretical and operational constraints.\nHis strategy for finding this model rests on the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: ZF plus V=L has an\n\u03c9-model which contains any given countable set of real\nnumbers.\n\n\n\n\nHere, the fact that this model satisfies ZFC is supposed to ensure\nthat it satisfies all of the theoretical constraints which come from\nset theory itself, while the richness of ZFC ensures that the model\nalso has the resources to code up our best scientific theories (and\nthereby to satisfy all of the theoretical constraints which come from\nnatural science). Finally, the fact that this model contains an\narbitrary set of real numbers ensures that it can code up all of the\nvarious observations and measurements which constitute our\n\u201cobservational\n constraints.\u201d[45]\n So, as long as Putnam is right in thinking\nthat the intended models of set theory are fixed solely by the formal\nstructure of our scientific theories\u2014including our explicit\nset-theoretic axioms\u2014and by the physical measurements that we\nhappen to make, then this theorem will generate an intended model in\nwhich V=L comes out true.\n\n\nThis version of the model-theoretic argument has three connections\nto Skolem's Paradox. First, Putnam himself presents the argument as a\nnatural development of the paradox. At the beginning of his paper,\nPutnam provides a quick sketch of Skolem's Paradox, and he then\nsuggests that his analysis of V=L comes from taking Skolem's arguments\nand \u201cextending them in somewhat the direction he [Skolem] seemed\nto be indicating\u201d (p 1). Second, and as evidenced by the passages\nquoted in footnote\n 44,\n Putnam's overall\nconclusions fit well with more-recent Skolemite understandings of\nSkolem's Paradox\u2014see, e.g., his conclusion that V=L has no\n\u201cdeterminate truth value\u201d (p 5) or that Skolem's\n\u201c\u2009\u2018relativity of set-theoretic notions\u2019\nextends to a relativity of the truth value of\n\u2018V=L\u2019\u2009\u201d (p 8). Finally, and most importantly,\nthe proof of Putnam's theorem turns crucially on the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems. (Very roughly, Putnam starts by\napplying the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem to L, so\nas to prove that his theorem holds in L; he then employs\nShoenfield absoluteness to reflect the theorem back up to\n V.)[46]\n\n\nPutnam's argument has received a number of kinds of criticism in\nthe literature. On the technical front, Bays has argued that Putnam's\nuse of the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem is illegitimate,\nsince standard systems of set theory do not allow us to apply this\ntheorem to a proper class like L. Indeed, even if we leave the details\nof Putnam's proofs aside, G\u00f6delean considerations show\nthat Putnam's theorem cannot be proved in ZFC at all (since\nthe theorem entails ZFC's consistency). Of course, if Putnam is willing\nto use a stronger background theory to prove his theorem\u2014e.g.,\nZFC + \u201cthere exists an inaccessible cardinal\u201d\u2014then he\ncan evade these kinds of criticisms. But in this case, it's unclear why\nthe model which results from Putnam's theorem should still be thought\nto satisfy our theoretical constraints. After all, anyone who accepts\nthe new axioms used in Putnam's revised proof will have theoretical\nconstraints which go somewhat beyond ZFC + V=L\u2014e.g., their\ntheoretical constraints might well include the axiom \u201cthere\nexists an inaccessible cardinal.\u201d See Bays 2001 for Bays'\noriginal formulation of this objection; see Velleman 1998 and Gaifman\n2004 for some alternate formulations; see Bellotti 2005 and Bays 2007b\nfor critical discussion; and see chapter 3 (esp. \u00a7 3.3.3) of\nHafner 2005 for discussion of a similar point concerning Putnam's use\nof transitivity.\n\nButton (2011) has argued that, although this kind of technical\ncriticism has teeth against the version of Putnam's argument which\nexplicitly invokes the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, there\nare alternate formulations of Putnam's argument which can evade the\ncriticism. In particular, Button notes that even very weak theories\ncan prove theorems like: \u201cif ZFC is consistent, then ZFC has a\ncountable model.\u201d Since any proponent of ZFC must accept that\nZFC is consistent, these weak theories are enough to get several\nvariants of Putnam's argument off the ground.  See Button 2011 for\ndevelopment of this point.  See Bellotti 2005 and Bays 2007a for\ndiscussion of a somewhat similar point.\n\n\n\nStaying in the technical vein, several authors have noted a tension\nin the way Putnam's argument deals with the notion of finitude. On the\none hand, Putnam needs to use this notion in order to characterize his\nmodel as an \u03c9-model and (even) to make sense of the formal\ndefinitions of a first-order language and of the first-order\nsatisfaction\n relation.[47]\n On the other hand, Putnam can't allow opponents\nof his argument to use this notion to specify what they think\nmakes a model intended. If his opponents could use this notion, then\nthey could define the notion of a model's being\n\u201cwell-founded,\u201d and that would be enough to rule out the\nmodels generated by Putnam's theorem. In this sense, then, Putnam's\nargument seems to turn on an unmotivated asymmetry between the kinds of\ntechnical machinery that he himself uses and the kinds of machinery\nthat he makes available to his critics. See Bays 2001 and Bellotti 2005\nfor developments of this point; see \u00a7 3.4 of Hafner 2005 for some\ncritical reflections.\n\n\nOn the more-purely philosophical side, many authors have criticized\nPutnam's assumption that simply satisfying a first-order formalization\nof our theoretical constraints is enough to make a model\n\u201cintended.\u201d So, for instance, Hacking has argued that we\nshould really be committed to a second-order formulation of set theory\nand that Putnam's key theorem doesn't apply to such formulations\n(Hacking 1983). Others have argued that the intended model for set\ntheory needs to be transitive and that, once again, there's no reason\nto believe that the model produced by Putnam's theorem is\ntransitive (Bays 2001). Finally, and as mentioned in the last\nparagraph, several authors have suggested that an intended model for\nset theory should at least be well-founded, but there's no reason to\nthink that Putnam's own model is well-founded (Bellotti\n2005).\n\n\nPutnam's response to this kind of objection is interesting. Very\nroughly, Putnam suggests that any conditions on intended models which\nother philosophers might propose\u2014e.g., those mentioned in the\nlast paragraph\u2014should themselves be formalized in first-order\nterms and treated as new theoretical constraints. When these new\nconstraints are fed back through Putnam's argument, he will once again\nbe able to generate a model which \u201csatisfies\u201d these\nconstraints. So, by simply adopting a particularly flexible reading of\nthe phrase \u201ctheoretical constraints,\u201d Putnam ensures that\nalmost any conditions on intended models can simply be folded\nback into his original argument (Putnam 1980; Putnam 1983,\n vii\u2013xii).[48]\n\n\nThis argument\u2014which is usually called the \u201cjust more\ntheory\u201d argument\u2014has received a huge amount of attention in\nthe literature. The most common response to the argument involves\ndrawing a distinction between describing the features of a\nmodel which make that model intended and simply adding new\nsentences for that model to satisfy. Put otherwise, it involves\ndistinguishing between changing the semantics under which our\naxioms get interpreted\u2014e.g., by restricting the class of\nstructures which count as models for our language and/or strengthening\nthe notion of satisfaction which ties sentences to models\u2014and\nsimply adding new axioms to be interpreted using the same old\nsemantics. The response then goes on to argue that proposals like those\ndiscussed two paragraphs ago\u2014e.g., that intended models should be\ntransitive or well-founded or satisfy second-order ZFC\u2014should be\nunderstood as falling on the description side of this distinction\nrather than on the \u201cadding sentences\u201d side (although the\nlatter is where Putnam's just more theory argument resolutely insists\non putting them).\n\n\nIn turn, Putnam has argued that this kind of response begs the\nquestion against his overall argument. Putnam's argument, after all,\nconcerns the question of whether our mathematical language has any\ndeterminate significance, and the response we're considering seems to\nsimply assume that it has such significance when the response\nuses phrases like \u201ctransitive,\u201d \u201cwell-founded,\u201d\nor \u201ccomplete power set of M\u201d to describe\nits notion of \u201cintended model.\u201d In short: as long as the\ndeterminacy of mathematical language is still at issue, it would beg\nthe question to make free use of this language in describing the\nintended model of set theory. Or so, at any rate, Putnam tries to\nargue.\n\n\nAs indicated above, this aspect of Putnam's argument has generated a\nhuge literature. See Devitt 1984, chapter 11; Lewis 1984; Taylor 1991;\nVan Cleve 1992; Hale and Wright 1997; Chambers 2000; Bays 2001; and\nBays 2008 for some representative criticisms of Putnam's argument. See\nPutnam 1983, vii\u2013xii and Putnam 1989 for Putnam's response. See\nAnderson 1993; Douven 1999; Haukioja 2001; and Kroon 2001 for some\nrecent defenses of this aspect of Putnam's argument.\n",
