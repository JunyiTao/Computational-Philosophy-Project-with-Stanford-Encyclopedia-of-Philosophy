    "main_text": "Ethics, Part One: What Justice Is || Human Motivations\n2.1 Human Motivations\n\n\nSocrates seeks to define justice as one of the cardinal human \nvirtues, and he understands the virtues as states of the soul. So his\naccount of what justice is depends upon his account of the human \nsoul.\n\n\nAccording to the Republic, every human soul has three parts:\nreason, spirit, and appetite. (This is a claim about the embodied \nsoul. In Book Ten, Socrates argues that the soul is immortal \n(608c\u2013611a) and says that the disembodied soul might be simple \n(611a\u2013612a), though he declines to insist on this (612a) and the \nTimaeus and Phaedrus apparently disagree on the \nquestion.) At first blush, the tripartition can suggest a division \ninto beliefs, emotions, and desires. But Socrates explicitly ascribes\nbeliefs, emotions, and desires to each part of the soul (Moline 1978). In \nfact, it is not even clear that Plato would recognize psychological \nattitudes that are supposed to be representational without also being\naffective and conative, or conative and affective without also being \nrepresentational. Consequently, \u2018belief\u2019 and \n\u2018desire\u2019 in translations or discussions of Plato \n(including this one) must be handled with care; they should not be \nunderstood along Humean lines as motivationally inert \nrepresentations, on the one hand, and non-cognitive motivators, on \nthe other.\n\n\nThe Republic offers two general reasons for the \ntripartition. First, Socrates argues that we cannot coherently \nexplain certain cases of psychological conflict unless we suppose \nthat there are at least two parts to the soul. The core of this \nargument is what we might call the principle of non-opposition: \u201cthe \nsame thing will not be willing to do or undergo opposites in the same\nrespect, in relation to the same thing, at the same time\u201d (436b8\u20139). \nThis is a perfectly general metaphysical principle, comparable to \nAristotle\u2019s principle of non-contradiction (Metaphysics G3 \n1005b19\u201320). Because of this principle, Socrates insists that one \nsoul cannot be the subject of opposing attitudes unless one \nof three conditions is met. One soul can be the subject of \nopposing attitudes if the attitudes oppose each other at different times, \neven in rapidly alternating succession (as Hobbes explains mental \nconflict). One soul can also be the subject of opposing attitudes if \nthe attitudes relate to different things, as a desire to drink \nchampagne and a desire to drink a martini might conflict. Last, one \nsoul can be the subject of opposing attitudes if the attitudes oppose\nin different respects.\n\n\nInitially, this third condition is obscure. The way Socrates\nhandles putative counter-examples to the principle of non-opposition\n(at 436c\u2013e) might suggest that when one thing experiences one opposite\nin one of its parts and another in another, it is not\nexperiencing opposites in different respects (Stalley 1975; Bobonich 2002, 228\u201331; Lorenz 2006, 23\u201324). That would entail,\napparently, that it is not one thing experiencing opposites at all,\nbut merely a plurality. But Socrates later rewords the principle of\nnon-opposition\u2019s \u201csame respect\u201d condition as a \u201csame\npart\u201d condition (439b), which explicitly allows one thing to\nexperience one opposite in one of its parts and another in\nanother. The most natural way of relating these two articulations of\nthe principle is to suppose that experiencing one opposite in one part\nand another in another is just one way to experience opposites in\ndifferent respects. But however we relate the two articulations to\neach other, Socrates clearly concludes that one soul can\nexperience simultaneously opposing attitudes in relation to the same\nthing, but only if different parts of it are the direct subjects of\nthe opposing attitudes.\n\n\nSocrates employs this general strategy four times. In Book Four, he\ntwice considers conflicting attitudes about what to do. First, he\nimagines a desire to drink being opposed by a calculated consideration\nthat it would be good not to drink (439a\u2013d). (We might think,\nanachronistically, of someone about to undergo surgery.) This is\nsupposed to establish a distinction between appetite and reason.  Then\nhe considers cases like that of Leontius, who became angry with\nhimself for desiring to ogle corpses (439e\u2013440b). These cases are\nsupposed to establish a distinction between appetite and spirit. In\nBook Ten, Socrates appeals to the principle of non-opposition when\nconsidering the decent man who has recently lost a son and is\nconflicted about grieving (603e\u2013604b) (cf. Austin 2016) and when considering conflicting\nattitudes about how things appear to be (602c\u2013603b) (cf. Moss 2008 and Singpurwalla 2011). These show a\nbroad division between reason and an inferior part of the soul (Ganson 2009); it is\ncompatible with a further distinction between two inferior parts,\nspirit and appetite.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 arguments from psychological conflict are well-tailored to \nexplain akrasia (weakness of will) (Penner 1990, Bobonich 1994, Carone 2001). In the Protagoras, \nSocrates denies that anyone willingly does other than what she \nbelieves to be best, but in the Republic, the door is opened\nfor a person to act on an appetitive attitude that conflicts with a \nrational attitude for what is best. How far the door is open to \nakrasia awaits further discussion below. For now, there are other \nmore pressing questions about the Republic\u2019s explanation of \npsychological conflict.\n\n\nFirst, what kinds of parts are reason, spirit, and appetite? Some\nscholars believe that they are merely conceptual parts, akin to\nsubsets of a set (Shields 2001, Price 2009). They would object to characterizing the parts\nas subjects of psychological attitudes. But the arguments\nfrom conflict treat reason, spirit, and appetite as distinct subjects\nof psychological states and events, and it seems best to take\nSocrates\u2019 descriptions at face value unless there is compelling reason\nnot to (Kamtekar 2006). At face value, Socrates offers a more robust conception of\nparts, wherein each part is like an independent agent. \n\n\nIndeed, this notion of parts is robust enough to make one wonder why \nreason, spirit, and appetite are parts at all, as opposed to\nthree independent subjects. But the Republic proceeds as \nthough every embodied human being has just one soul that comprises \nthree parts. No embodied soul is perfectly unified: even the virtuous\nperson, who makes her soul into a unity as much as she can (443c\u2013e), \nhas three parts in her soul. (She must, as we shall see, in order to \nbe just.) But every embodied soul enjoys an unearned unity: every \nhuman\u2019s reason, spirit, and appetite constitute a single soul that is\nthe unified source of that human\u2019s life and is a unified locus of \nresponsibility for that human\u2019s thoughts and actions. (It is not as though a person is held responsible for \nwhat his reason does but not for what his appetite does.) There are \nquestions about what exactly explains this unearned unity of the \nsoul (see E. Brown 2012).\n\n\nThere are also questions about whether the arguments from conflict \nestablish exactly three parts of the soul (and see Whiting 2012). Some worry that the \ndiscussion of Leontius does not warrant the recognition of a third \npart of the soul (but see Brennan 2012), and some worry that the appetitive part contains \nsuch a multitude of attitudes that it must be subject to further \nconflicts and further partitioning (and see 443e with Kamtekar 2008). Answering these \nquestions requires us to characterize more precisely the kind of\nopposition that forces partitioning , in accordance with the principle\nof non-opposition (compare Reeve 1988, 124\u201331; Irwin 1995, 203\u201317; Price 1995, 46\u201348; and Lorenz 2006, 13\u201352), and to examine more carefully the broader features\nbeing attributed to the three parts of the soul (on appetite, e.g., compare Bobonich 2002, Lorenz 2006, and Moss 2008).\n\n\nFortunately, the arguments from conflict do not work alone. Indeed, \nthey cannot, as the principle of non-opposition merely establishes a \nconstraint on successful psychological explanations. Appeals to this \nprinciple can show where some division must exist, but they do not by\nthemselves characterize the parts so divided. So, already in Book \nFour\u2019s arguments from conflict, Socrates invokes broader patterns of \npsychology and appeals to the parts to explain these patterns (cf. \n435d\u2013436b).\n\n\nThis appeal to reason, spirit, and appetite to explain broader \npatterns of human thought and action constitutes the \nRepublic\u2019s second general strategy to support tripartition. \nIt receives its fullest development in Books Eight and Nine, where \nSocrates uses his theory of the tripartite soul to explain a variety \nof psychological constitutions. In the most basic implementation of \nthis strategy, Socrates distinguishes people ruled by reason, those \nruled by spirit, and those ruled by appetite (580d\u2013581e, esp. 581c): \nthe first love wisdom and truth, the second love victory and honor, \nand the third profit and money. This simplistic division, it might be\nnoted in passing, fixes the sides for an ongoing debate about \nwhether it is best to be a philosopher, a politician, or an epicure \n(see, e.g., Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics I 5 and X 6\u20138). \nBut more important for our purposes here, this basic classification \ngreatly illuminates the division of the soul.\n\n\nFirst, we learn about the organizing aims of each of the psychological\nparts (Cooper 1984, Kahn 1987, Reeve 1988, Moss 2005). In Book Four, reason is characterized by its ability to track\nwhat is good for each part and the soul as a whole (441e, 442c). In\nBook Nine, reason is characterized by its desire for wisdom. These are\nnot bifurcated aims. Socrates argues that people are not satisfied merely\nwith what they take to be good for themselves but want\nwhat is in fact good for them (505d). So reason naturally\npursues not just what it takes to be good for the whole soul but also\nthe wisdom that ensures that it would get this right. Nor is wisdom\u2019s\nvalue merely instrumental to discovering what is good for one. If\nwisdom is a fundamental constituent of virtue and virtue is a\nfundamental constituent of what is good for a human being, then wisdom\nturns out to be a fundamental constituent of what is good for a human\nbeing. So it should not be surprising that the part of the soul that\ntracks and pursues what is good for the whole soul also loves\nwisdom. Spirit, by contrast, tracks social preeminence and honor. If\n\u2018good\u2019 is the organizing predicate for rational attitudes,\n\u2018honorable\u2019 or \u2018fine\u2019 (Greek kalon)\nis the organizing predicate for spirited attitudes (Singpurwalla 2013). Finally, appetite\nseeks material satisfaction for bodily urges, and because money better\nthan anything else provides this, people ruled by appetite often come\nto love money above all.\n\n\nThe basic division of the world into philosophers, honor-lovers, and\nmoney-lovers also illuminates what Socrates means by talking of being\nruled by one part of the soul. If one part dominates in you, then aims\nof that part are your aims. If, for example, you are ruled by spirit,\nthen your reason conceives of your good in terms of what is\nhonorable. Reason has its own aim, to get what is in fact good for the\nwhole soul, but in a soul perfectly ruled by spirit, where there are\nno genuine psychological conflicts between different parts, reason\u2019s\nlove for truth and wisdom must be limited to that which is also held\nto be honorable.\n\n\nStill, Plato\u2019s full psychological theory is much more complicated than\nthe basic division of persons would suggest. First, there are\ndifferent kinds of appetitive attitudes (558d\u2013559c, 571a\u2013572b): some\nare necessary for human beings; some are unnecessary but regulable\n(\u201clawful\u201d), and some are unnecessary and entirely\nuncontrollable (\u201clawless\u201d). So there are in fact five\nkinds of pure psychological constitutions: aristocratically\nconstituted persons (those ruled by their rational attitudes),\ntimocratically constituted persons (those ruled by their spirited\nattitudes), oligarchically constituted persons (ruled by necessary\nappetitive attitudes), democratically constituted persons (ruled by\nunnecessary appetitive attitudes), and tyrannically constituted\npersons (ruled by lawless appetitive attitudes). The first three of these constitutions are characteristically ordered toward simple aims (wisdom, honor, and money, respectively), but the last two are not so ordered, because there is no simple aim of the unnecessary appetites, be they lawful or lawless. In effect, the democratic and tyrannical souls treat desire-satisfaction itself and the pleasure associated with it as their end. The democrat treats all desires and pleasures as equally valuable and restricts herself to lawful desires, but the tyrant embraces disordered, lawless desires and has a special passion for the apparently most intense, bodily pleasures (cf. Scott 2000, Johnstone 2013, and Johnstone 2015).\n\n\nThe second complication is that some people are not perfectly ruled by\none part of the soul, but are subject to continuing conflicts between,\nsay, attitudes in favor of doing what is honorable and appetitive\nattitudes in favor of pursuing a shameful tryst. Socrates does not\nconcentrate on these people, nor does he say how common they are. But\nhe does acknowledge their existence (544c\u2013d, cf. 445c).  Moreover, the\noccurrence of akrasia would seem to require their existence. For if I\nam perfectly ruled by my spirit, then I take my good to be what is\nhonorable, and how could I be akratic?  My spirit and my reason are in\nline, so there will be no overpowering of rational preferences about\nwhat is best by spirit. You might suppose that my appetite could\novercome my sense of what is honorable, but in that case, it would\nseem that I am not, after all, perfectly ruled by my spirit. Things\nmight seem different with people ruled by their appetite. Certainly,\nif I were perfectly ruled by appetite, then I would be susceptible to\nakrasia of the impetuous sort, acting on appetitive desires without\nreflectively endorsing them as good. But impetuous akrasia is quite\ndistinct from the standard akrasia in which I endorse \u03c6ing as best\nfor me and at just that moment intentionally \u03c8 instead, and\nstandard akrasia would seem to be impossible in any soul that is\nperfectly ruled by any one part of the soul. If you think that\ncompeting appetitive attitudes could give rise to a strict case of\nstandard akrasia, you should recall how Socrates would have to explain\nthese cases of psychological conflict in order to avoid multiplying\nhis divisions in the soul.\n\n\nThe general strategy of the Republic\u2019s psychology\u2014to\nexplain human thought and action by reference to subpersonal\nhomunculi\u2014remains both appealing and problematic (Burnyeat 2006). Moreover, the\ndialogue is filled with pointed observations and fascinating\nspeculations about human psychology. Some of them pull us up short,\nas, for example, the Freudian recognition of Oedipal desires that come\nout only in dreams (571c\u2013d). The full theory is complex, and there\nremain numerous questions about many of its details.\n \n\nFortunately, these questions do not have to be settled here for us to\nentertain Socrates\u2019 response to Glaucon and Adeimantus\u2019 challenge. \nIndeed, although his response builds closely on the psychological \ntheory, some broad features of the response could be accepted even by\nthose who reject the tripartite psychology.\n",
