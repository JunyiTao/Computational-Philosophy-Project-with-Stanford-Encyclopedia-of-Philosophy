Ethics III \u2014 The Ethics of Requirement\n\nAs we noted above in Section 10, Chisholm offered an account of the\nconcept of intrinsic goodness by appeal to the concept of requirement.\nIn some places, Chisholm defended the idea that a thing is\nintrinsically good (bad) when contemplation of just that thing\nrequires that the contemplator loves (hates) it. But Chisholm wanted\nto go much further. In his discussion of these matters in [B&IV]\nChisholm remarks:\n\nThis way of defining intrinsic value, then, makes use of the concept\nof requirement. And there is reason to think that the concept\nof requirement is the central concept of ethics. It yields adequate\ndefinitions of the basic intrinsic value concepts. And it has the\nfollowing advantage as well: It provides a way of reducing the\nconcepts of the theory of value (\u201caxiology\u201d) to those of\nethics (\u201cdeontology\u201d). ([B&IV], 53)\n\n\nIn a couple of papers, Chisholm tried to show how the central concepts\nof axiology and deontology can be defined by appeal to this one\nfundamental concept of requirement. These papers provide beautiful\nillustrations of one of Chisholm\u2019s most characteristic\nphilosophical procedures \u2014 the clear definition of a tangle of\nrelated concepts by appeal to a small set of undefined primitives. In\nthis instance, he tries to explain confusing and problematic concepts\nin the realm of ethics. He makes use of just a few undefined concepts.\nOne of them \u2014 requirement \u2014 seems to carry all of\nthe distinctively normative burden. (It would be interesting to\ncompare Chisholm\u2019s efforts on behalf of requirement in\nethics with his efforts on behalf of more reasonable than in\nepistemology. The projects seem to illustrate the same methodological\npropensity.)\n\nIn \u201cThe Ethics of Requirement\u201d, Chisholm uses\n\u2018pRq\u2019 to abbreviate \u2018p would\nrequire q\u2019. The relevant concept of requirement is\noperative in the statement \u2018If I were to promise to meet you for\nlunch that would require my meeting you for lunch.\u2019 An actual\nrequirement for q comes into being when q is\nrequired by something, p, and p actually occurs.\nThus, if I actually did promise to meet you for lunch, then there is a\nrequirement that I show up. But even if actual, the requirement is\ndefeasible. It may be overridden. When an action is actually required\nin this way, it counts at least as a prima facie obligation. If I meet\nan injured stranger on the way to lunch, and I alone am qualified to\ntend to his injuries, then this further state of affairs overrides my\nprima facie obligation to meet you for lunch. In light of this,\nChisholm defines all-in, or all things considered, obligation as\nnon-overridden requirement. In other words:\n\nq is all things considered obligatory =df \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2203p(pRq & p occurs &\n~\u2203s(s occurs &\n~((p&s)Rq)))\n\n\nThis concept of obligation is not restricted to actions. It is a\nconcept of the \u201cought to be\u201d. In order to explain the\n\u201cought to do\u201d, Chisholm introduces another operator,\n\u2018A\u2019. \u2018Ap\u2019 expresses the idea\nthat a person S succeeds in bringing about the state\nof affairs p. Making use this further expression, Chisholm\ndefines the ought to do by saying that the statement that S\nought to bring about some state of affairs p just means\nOAp.\n\nOnce we have a definition of all things considered obligation, it is\neasy enough to define permission, forbiddenness, and gratuitousness.\nChisholm does this in the expected ways.\n\nA person has a prima facie obligation to do something when his doing\nit is required by something that happens. An all-in obligation arises\nwhen there is a non-overridden requirement for him to do it. Chisholm\nclaims that this helps to solve the puzzle about conflicts of\nobligation. Obviously, there can be conflicts of prima facie\nobligation. But there cannot be conflicts of all-in obligation.\n\nIn addition, Chisholm attempts to apply his conceptual scheme to some\nother long-standing puzzles in ethics. Among these is a puzzle about\nsupererogatory action. A supererogatory action is supposedly one that\nis \u201cbeyond the call of duty\u201d \u2014 something that would\nbe outstandingly good to do, but permissible to fail to do.\nConsequentialists have a hard time explaining how there could be any\nsuch things, since they typically say that duty requires us to do the\nbest we can. How can there be anything \u201cbeyond\u201d that? And\nhow could it be permissible to fail to do such a thing, if it is\n\u201cextra good\u201d?\n\nChisholm proposes to explain this by saying that a certain action is\nsupererogatory when its \u201cobject\u201d absolutely ought to be,\nbut its agent is neither obligated to bring it about nor to refrain\nfrom bringing it about. He uses \u2018PAq\u2019 to\nabbreviate \u2018S is permitted to bring about\nq\u2019, where permission is understood to be the absence of\nobligation to refrain:\n\nS\u2019s doing q is supererogatory\n=df Oq & P~Aq &\nPAq\n\n\nIn subsequent papers, Chisholm made further claims about the\nusefulness of his concept of requirement.\n",
