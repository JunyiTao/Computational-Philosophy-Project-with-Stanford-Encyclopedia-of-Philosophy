Such an interpretation is supported by a view of the currency\nof well-being that helps explain why failure to meet the threshold\nsignificantly harms people. Basic needs are such a view. If people\ncannot satisfy their basic needs, they are necessarily and severely\ndamaged: necessarily as the damage does not occur because of special\nenvironmental conditions or as the person concerned has special\ncharacteristics. Rather, it is because of such conditions and\ncharacteristics that currently apply and will remain foreseeably and\nlargely unchanged (Wiggins 1998: 15). The damage is significant\nbecause it undermines the conditions for the possibility of a\nminimally good life (Wiggins 1998: 14). For example, if a person has\nno access to food, this leads to apathy, organ damage or even death of\nthe person. Such damage is physiologically necessary, regardless of,\nfor example, the nationality, social status or religion of the person\nconcerned. Being able to satisfy basic needs when understood in this\nway can be protected for reasons of justice by ascribing the\ncorresponding moral rights. The same list of such rights is attributed\nto all people (wherever and whenever they live), which does not\nexclude the possibility that changing social, economic and cultural\nconditions also change the means of satisfying basic needs (the\nso-called satisfiers of basic needs) (see, e.g., Braybrooke 1987; Sen\n1984; Nussbaum 2000: 132\u2013133; Page 2006: 71\u201375).\n\nThe currency of central capabilities (see Nussbaum 2006; Petz 2018) is\nhighly similar to basic needs. Other currencies differ in relevant\nways (Meyer & P\u00f6lzler forthcoming). For example, the currency\nof preference-satisfaction (whatever these preferences happen to be)\n(see, e.g., Arrow 1963; Goodin 1995; Singer 1979) measures well-being\nnot in objective, but in subjective terms: what a person prefers is\ncontingent on mental states, namely on the preferences of this person.\nAlso, the direction of future changes in preferences is difficult to\npredict; it is possible and plausible that future persons will have\n(fundamentally) different preferences than persons living today. The\ncurrency of impersonal resources (i.e., goods that can be used to\nproduce many kinds of benefits; for example, income and wealth) (see,\ne.g., Barry 1989a; Rawls 2001) faces a different problem:\npeople\u2019s levels of impersonal resources do not necessarily\ncorrelate with levels of well-being realized. Impersonal resources are\nunreliable indicators of well-being (see Page 2007b: 457\u2013458;\nSen 1982: 19\u201321, 26\u201330).\n",
