    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Equality of Opportunity for Welfare or Advantage\n3.7 Equality of Opportunity for Welfare or Advantage\n\nApproaches based on equality of opportunity can be read as revisions\nof both welfarism and resourcism. Ranged against welfarism and\ndesigned to avoid its pitfalls, they incorporate the powerful ideas of\nchoice and responsibility into various, improved forms of\negalitarianism. Such approaches are meant to equalize outcomes\nresulting from causes beyond a person\u2019s control (i.e., beyond\ncircumstances or endowment), but to allow differential outcomes that\nresult from autonomous choice or ambition. But the approaches are also\naimed at maintaining the insight that individual preferences have to\ncount, as the sole basis for a necessary linkage back to the\nindividual perspective: otherwise, there is an overlooking of the\nperson\u2019s value. In Arneson\u2019s (1989, 1990) concept of equal\nopportunity for welfare, the preferences determining the measure\nof individual well-being are meant to be conceived hypothetically\n\u2013 i.e., a person would decide on them after a process of ideal\nreflection. In order to correspond to the morally central vantage of\npersonal responsibility, what should be equalized are not enlightened\npreferences themselves, but rather real opportunities to achieve or\nreceive a good, to the extent that it is aspired to. G.A. Cohen\u2019s\n(1989, p. 916 f.) broader conception of equality of access to\nadvantage attempts to integrate the perspectives of welfare\nequality and resource equality through the overriding concept of\nadvantage. For Cohen, there are two grounds for egalitarian\ncompensation. Egalitarians will be moved to furnish a paralyzed person\nwith a compensatory wheelchair independently of the person\u2019s welfare\nlevel. This egalitarian response to disability overrides equality of\n(opportunity to) welfare. Egalitarians also favor compensation for\nphenomena such as pain, independent of any loss of capacity \u2013\nfor instance by paying for expensive medicine. But, Cohen claims, any\njustification for such compensation has to invoke the idea of equality\nof opportunity to welfare. He thus views both aspects, resources and\nwelfare, as necessary and irreducible. Much of Roemer\u2019s (1998) more\ntechnical argument is devoted to constructing the scale to calibrate\nthe extent to which something is the result of circumstances. An\nincurred adverse consequence is the result of circumstances, not\nchoice, precisely to the extent that it is a consequence that persons\nof one or another specific type can be expected to incur.\n",
