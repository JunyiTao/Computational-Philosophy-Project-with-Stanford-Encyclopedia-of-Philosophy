Models of metaphysical explanation\n\nA common strategy when trying to get to a grip of some phenomenon is\nto model our understanding of its nature on some pre-existing and\nwell-established understanding of the nature of a (supposedly\nrelevantly similar) phenomenon. In this section we survey some\ninstances of this strategy by investigating attempts to model\nmetaphysical explanation as a kind of causal\n (\u00a76.1),\n nomological\n (\u00a76.2),\n unificationist\n (\u00a76.3),\n or pragmatist explanation\n (\u00a76.4).\n",
