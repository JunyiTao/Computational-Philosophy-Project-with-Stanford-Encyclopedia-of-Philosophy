    "main_text": "The Moral Justification of Legal Rights || Legal Rights and the Common Good (or Public Interest)\n9.2 Legal Rights and the Common Good (or Public Interest) \n\nRights and the common good are often considered antagonistic (Lyons\n1982; 1994: 147\u2013176; Kamm 2002: 489\u2013497; for a discussion,\nsee Jones 1994: 50\u201361). For example, characterizing rights as\n\u201cdeontological side-constraints\u201d on the promotion of the\ncommon good (Nozick 1974: 28\u201335); or, the view that rights vest\nwhen collective goals are insufficient to justify depriving or harming\nan individual person (Dworkin 1977: xi, 91, 190\u2013192, 269; 1984:\n153). \n\nMore specifically to legal rights, something in the individualistic\nspirit of views such as those of Nozick and Dworkin rings true. Legal\nrights certainly can function as bastions of individual\nright-holders\u2019 interests, agency, dignity, autonomy, control,\nand liberty even in the face of utilitarian ideals or, more generally,\nthe common good (Lyons 1982; 1994: 147\u2013176). In contrast, at\ntimes the common good is found to override certain individuals\u2019\nlegal rights (Wellman 1995: 251\u2013255). Nowhere is this tension\nmore apparent than in the case of constitutional or\n\u201cfundamental\u201d rights, which are often couched in terms of\nlimitations on state power over individual citizens. Yet, this tension\nalso manifests in more mundane clashes, such as in the case of\nwasteful and inefficient use of personal property, which is often\nprotected by the legal right to property (Lyons 1982: 115\u2013118).\n\n\nIs this individualism, which is typical of legal rights, compatible\nwith the view that the moral grounds of legal rights can and arguably\noften do include reasons of the common good (see\n Section 9.1)?\n Arguably yes. \n\nFirstly, taken in aggregate, certain legal rights provide for the\nvarious aspects of individuals\u2019 well-being; and, if such rights\nare enjoyed by all\u2014securing people\u2019s dignity, liberty,\nwelfare etc., then rights thereby secure a significant measure of the\ncommon good (Finnis 2011: 2010\u2013218). \n\nSecondly, some legal rights are group rights, ideally furthering the\nindividual interests of the members of the group as members of the\ngroup (Raz 1986: 207\u2013209). Such rights can, therefore, align\nwith the common good (so long as all relevant parties are members of\nthe group). Examples include cultural and language rights and\npeoples\u2019 right to self-determination (e.g., Margalit & Raz\n1990). \n\nThirdly, even if a norm is justified by the common good, the practice\nand application of that norm arguably must be guided by the content of\nthe norm alone, not by its justification (see, e.g., Berkeley 1712:\nsec. 31; Rawls 1955). When someone \u201cstands on\u201d his or her\nlegal rights, it is invariably under conditions of conflict with the\nclaims or interests of others or with the common good. Accordingly, at\nleast at the level of legal practice and in particular cases, rights\nand the common good are indeed sometimes antagonistic (Lyons 1982).\nYet, from this it does not follow that at the level of their moral\njustification legal rights are necessarily or even typically\ninhospitable to or incompatible with the common good. Clearly if a\nlegal right is in conflict with the common good, and if that right\nprevails as a matter of law, the common good suffers. Nevertheless,\nsuch an outcome in a specific case is not necessarily averse to the\ncommon good when viewed from the broader perspective of the\nrule\u2019s justification (Sumner 2006: 192\u2013195). It is often\nin the common good for law to grant certain rights to individuals;\nrights that, on occasion and in specific cases, setback the common\ngood in favor of individual right-holders (e.g., Greenawalt 1982).\nMill, for instance, arguably advocated such a view of legal rights\n(Sumner 2006: 189\u2013192, 195\u2013197):\n\n\n[to] have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which\nsociety ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes\non to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general\nutility. (Mill 1863: Ch. 5. Par. 25) \n\n\nMany rights of criminal procedure, to give just one example, exhibit\nthis justificatory structure. Such as the rights to legal\nrepresentation and against unlawful search and seizure, which can\nshackle the criminal justice system, sometimes resulting in less\neffective law enforcement. And still, on balance, right-based\nlimitations on the coercive and punitive branches of government are\nwidely recognized as in the common good. \n",
