Psychologism and the Historiography of Philosophy\n\nThe discussion of Brentano\u2019s views on logic, ethics and\naesthetics shows that his philosophy has strong psychologistic\ntendencies. Whether or not one is to conclude that he does adopt a\nform of psychologism depends on the exact definition of the latter\nterm: Brentano vehemently rejects the charge of psychologism, which he\ntakes to stand for a subjectivist and anthropocentric position. At the\nsame time, however, he explicitly defends the claim that psychology is\nthe theoretical science on which practical disciplines of logic,\nethics, and aesthetics are based. In LW he explicitly notes\nthat, like all other philosophical disciplines, also aesthetics is\nrooted in psychology and continues: \u201cAnd similarly one could\nshow for aesthetics and any other philosophical discipline that\nseparated from psychology it would have to wither like a branch that\nis detached from the trunk.\u201d (LW, 39 [my translation])\n[\u201cUnd \u00e4hnlich lie\u00dfe sich f\u00fcr die Aesthetik\nund jede andere Disciplin der Philosophie aufs leichteste nachweisen,\nda\u00df sie, losgetrennt von der Psychologie, wie ein vom Stamm\nlosgetrennter Zweig verdorren m\u00fcsste.\u201d] Hence,\nBrentano does adopt the form of psychologism Husserl seems to have had\nin mind in the Prolegomena to his Logical\nInvestigations, where he defines logical psychologism as a\nposition according to which:\n\n\n\u2026 [T]he essential theoretical foundations of logic lie in\npsychology, in whose field those propositions belong \u2014 as far as\ntheir theoretical content is concerned \u2014 which give logic its\ncharacteristic pattern. \u2026 Often people talk as if psychology\nprovided the sole, sufficient, theoretical foundation for logical\npsychology (Husserl 2001, 40).\n\n[Die wesentlichen theoretischen Fundamente liegen in der\nPsychologie; in deren Gebiet geh\u00f6ren ihrem theoretischen Gehalt\nnach die S\u00e4tze, die der Logik ihr charakteristisches Gepr\u00e4ge\ngeben. \u2026 Ja nicht selten spricht man so, als g\u00e4be die\nPsychologie das alleinige und ausreichende theoretische Fundament\nf\u00fcr die logische Kunstlehre. (Husserl, 1900, 51)]\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s tendency to offer psychological explanations is shown\nalso in his approach to the history of philosophy, in particular in\nhis explanations of the mechanisms that explain the historical\ndevelopment in this discipline. In his text The Four Phases of\nPhilosophy and Its Current State (1998) he defended the\nmetaphilosophical thesis that progress in philosophy can be explained\naccording to principles of cultural psychology. According to Brentano,\nphilosophical progress takes place in circles. He divides the whole\nhistory of philosophy in three periods (ancient, medieval, and modern\nphilosophy), each of which can, according to him, be subdivided in\nfour phases. The first is a creative phase of renewal and ascending\ndevelopment; the other three are phases of decline, dominated by a\nturn towards practical interests, by scepticism, and finally by\nmysticism. After the fourth phase, a new period begins with a creative\nphase of renewal. \n\nBrentano has presented his model to a larger audience quite late in\nhis life, but he had come up with it very early in his career; Carl\nStumpf reports that Brentano first came up with this idea in 1860 and\nthat he used it in his lectures on the history of philosophy already\nin W\u00fcrzburg in the mid-sixties (cf. Stumpf 1919, 89f). While both\nthe historical accuracy of and the principles of cultural psychology\nthat gave rise to the model can be put in question (cf. Gilson 1976),\nit definitely tells the reader much about Brentano\u2019s conception\nof philosophy and his vivid interest in its history. Brentano\u2019s\nshort text can, thus, best be read as a simplifying narrative that\nallows the author to explain his conviction that philosophy ought to\npursue of pure, theoretical interests and to express his fascination\nfor philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas, or Descartes as well as his\ndislike of Plotinus, Nicolas of Cues, Kant, Hegel, and Schelling. \n",
