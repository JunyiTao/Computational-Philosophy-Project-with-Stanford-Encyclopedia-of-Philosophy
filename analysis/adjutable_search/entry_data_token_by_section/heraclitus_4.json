    "main_text": "Philosophical Principles || The Unity of Opposites\n3.2 The Unity of Opposites\n\nHeraclitus\u2019 flux doctrine is a special case of the unity of\nopposites, pointing to ways things are both the same and not the same\nover time. He depicts two key opposites that are interconnected, but\nnot identical. Heraclitus sometimes explains how things have opposite\nqualities:\n\nSea is the purest and most polluted water: for fish drinkable and\nhealthy, for men undrinkable and harmful. (B61)\n\n\nBarnes thinks Heraclitus gets his doctrine of the universal\ncoinstantiation of contraries through fallaciously dropping qualifiers\n(such as: \u2018for fish,\u2019 \u2018for men\u2019). But B61\nshows he is perfectly aware of them, and we might rather say that he\nunderstands them tacitly even when he does not utter them. When he\nsays,\n\nCollections: wholes and not wholes; brought together, pulled apart;\nsung in unison, sung in conflict; from all things one and from one all\nthings (B10)\n\n\nhe does not contradict himself. There are perfectly good contexts in\nwhich everything he says is true. One can divide a collection into its\nparts or join the parts into a unified whole. \n\nMost tellingly, Heraclitus explains just how contraries are\nconnected:\n\nAs the same thing in us are living and dead, waking and sleeping,\nyoung and old. For these things having changed around are those, and\nthose in turn having changed around are these.(B88)\n\n\nContrary qualities are found in us \u201cas the same thing.\u201d\nBut they are the same by virtue of one thing changing around to\nanother. We are asleep and we wake up; we are awake and we go to\nsleep. Thus sleep and waking are both found in us, but not at the same\ntime or in the same respect. Indeed, if sleeping and waking were\nidentical, there would be no change as required by the second\nsentence. Contraries are the same by virtue of constituting a system\nof connections: alive-dead, waking-sleeping, young-old. Subjects do\nnot possess incompatible properties at the same time, but at different\ntimes.\n\nIn general, what we see in Heraclitus is not a conflation of opposites\ninto an identity, but a series of subtle analyses revealing the\ninterconnectedness of contrary states in life and in the world. There\nis no need to impute to him a logical fallacy. Opposites are a\nreality, and their interconnections are real, but the correlative\nopposites are not identical to each other.\n",
