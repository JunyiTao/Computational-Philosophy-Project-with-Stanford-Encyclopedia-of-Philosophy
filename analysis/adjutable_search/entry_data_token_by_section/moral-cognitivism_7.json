    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Expressivism\n2.4 Expressivism\n\nExpressivists of all sorts think that moral sentences are conventional\ndevices for expressing pro and/or con attitudes towards their objects.\nIn this broad sense emotivists are expressivists; they agree that\nmoral language functions to express non-cognitive attitudes of various\nsorts. The claim that moral terms function much like \u2018boo\u2019\nand \u2018hurrah\u2019 qualifies as expressivist in a broad sense.\nIn recent years, however, the term \u2018expressivist\u2019 has come\nto be used in a narrower way, to refer to views which attempt to\nconstruct a systematic semantics for moral sentences by pairing them\nwith the states of mind that the sentences are said to express. Such\nexpressivists hold that the meanings of all sentences containing moral\nterms are determined by the mental states that they serve to\nexpress.\n\nFor this to work, the sense in which moral sentences express the\nattitudes which determine their semantic values must be fairly strict\nand particular. For in one sense perfectly ordinary indicative\nsentences can express non-cognitive attitudes as when, \u2018It is\nten o\u2019clock already,\u2019 can express impatience. And,\n\u2018Lying sucks!\u2019 and \u2018I disapprove of lying,\u2019\ncan each express disapproval of lying. Even so, we should not want to\nassimilate the semantics of these sentences to one another. Thus\nexpressivists of the narrower sort must identify a kind of expression\nwhich allows them to distinguish the way in which \u201cLying is\nwrong,\u201d expresses the attitude that generates its semantic\nvalue, from the way in which \u201cI disapprove of lying,\u201d or\neven \u201cI think that lying is wrong\u201d might express the very\nsame attitude (Schroeder 2008a, 2008c).\n\nThose who have taken up this expressivist program have provided a\nnumber of candidates for the attitudes expressed by sentences\ncontaining normative terminology. Simon Blackburn, whose quasi-realist\nproject was briefly described above, has contributed various ideas not\nonly for the states expressed by indicative sentences but also for\ncomplex embeddings of moral claims. Hybrid theories that put the\nexpressive function of normative language into the semantics\n(discussed below) also involve work of this sort. But the proponent\nwho has developed the program in the most systematic way is Allan\nGibbard. In two influential books Gibbard has proposed two\nstructurally similar accounts each of which employs a different base\nnoncognitive attitude. In Gibbard (1990) the attitude was\nnorm-acceptance, whereas in Gibbard (2003) it was a planning attitude\nakin to intending. In each case he develops a strategy for combining\nthe relevant noncognitive attitude with belief to generate complex\nattitudes that can serve as the semantic values of more complex\nsentences. For more recent developments see Mark Schroeder\u2019s\n(2008c) bifurcated attitude semantics and Silk (2015) developing\nDreier\u2019s (2006) use of preference to impose structure.\n",
