    "main_text": "\n1. Constraints on Definitions of Art\n Any definition of art has to square with the following\nuncontroversial facts: (i) entities (artifacts or performances)\nintentionally endowed by their makers with a significant degree of\naesthetic interest, often greatly surpassing that of most everyday\nobjects, first appeared hundreds of thousands of years ago and exist\nin virtually every known human culture (Davies 2012); (ii) such\nentities are partially comprehensible to cultural outsiders \u2013\nthey are neither opaque nor completely transparent; (iii) such\nentities sometimes have non-aesthetic \u2013 ceremonial or religious or\npropagandistic \u2013 functions, and sometimes do not; (iv) such\nentities might conceivably be produced by non-human species,\nterrestrial or otherwise; and it seems at least in principle possible\nthat they be extraspecifically recognizable as such; (v)\ntraditionally, artworks are intentionally endowed by their makers with\nproperties, often sensory, having a significant degree of aesthetic\ninterest, usually surpassing that of most everyday objects; (vi) art\u2019s\nnormative dimension \u2013 the high value placed on making and\nconsuming art \u2013 appears to be essential to it, and artworks can\nhave considerable moral and political as well as aesthetic power;\n(vii) the arts are always changing, just as the rest of culture is: as\nartists experiment creatively, new genres, art-forms, and styles\ndevelop; standards of taste and sensibilities evolve; understandings\nof aesthetic properties, aesthetic experience, and the nature of art\nevolve; (viii) there are institutions in some but not all cultures\nwhich involve a focus on artifacts and performances that have a high\ndegree of aesthetic interest but lack any practical, ceremonial, or\nreligious use; (ix) entities seemingly lacking aesthetic interest, and\nentities having a high degree of aesthetic interest, are not\ninfrequently grouped together as artworks by such institutions; (x)\nlots of things besides artworks \u2013 for example, natural entities\n(sunsets, landscapes, flowers, shadows), human beings, and abstract\nentities (theories, proofs, mathematical entities) \u2013 have\ninteresting aesthetic properties.  \n Of these facts, those having to do with art\u2019s contingent\ncultural and historical features are emphasized by some definitions of\nart. Other definitions of art give priority to explaining those facts\nthat reflect art\u2019s universality and continuity with other\naesthetic phenomena.  Still other definitions attempt to explain both\nart\u2019s contingent characteristics and its more abiding ones while\ngiving priority to neither. \n\n\nTwo general constraints on definitions are particularly relevant to\ndefinitions of art. First, given that accepting that something is\ninexplicable is generally a philosophical last resort, and granting\nthe importance of extensional adequacy, list-like or enumerative\ndefinitions are if possible to be avoided. Enumerative definitions,\nlacking principles that explain why what is on the list is on the\nlist, don\u2019t, notoriously, apply to definienda that\nevolve, and provide no clue to the next or general case\n(Tarski\u2019s definition of truth, for example, is standardly\ncriticized as unenlightening because it rests on a list-like\ndefinition of primitive denotation; see Field 1972; Devitt 2001;\nDavidson 2005).  Corollary: when everything else is equal (and it is\ncontroversial whether and when that condition is satisfied in the case\nof definitions of art), non-disjunctive definitions are preferable to\ndisjunctive ones. Second, given that most classes outside of\nmathematics are vague, and that the existence of borderline cases is\ncharacteristic of vague classes, definitions that take the class of\nartworks to have borderline cases are preferable to definitions that\ndon\u2019t (Davies 1991 and 2006; Stecker 2005).\n\n\nWhether any definition of art does account for these facts and satisfy\nthese constraints, or could account for these facts and\nsatisfy these constraints, are key questions for aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of art.\n2. Definitions From the History of Philosophy\n\n\nClassical definitions, at least as they are portrayed in\ncontemporary discussions of the definition of art,  take artworks to be\ncharacterized by a single type of property. The standard candidates are\nrepresentational properties, expressive properties, and formal\nproperties. So there are representational or mimetic definitions,\nexpressive definitions, and formalist definitions, which hold that\nartworks are characterized by their possession of, respectively,\nrepresentational, expressive, and formal properties. It is not\ndifficult to find fault with these simple definitions. For example,\npossessing representational, expressive, and formal properties cannot\nbe sufficient conditions, since, obviously, instructional manuals are\nrepresentations, but not typically artworks, human faces and gestures\nhave expressive properties without being works of art, and both natural\nobjects and artifacts produced solely for homely utilitarian purposes\nhave formal properties but are not artworks.\n The ease of these dismissals, though, serves as a reminder of the\nfact that classical definitions of art are significantly less\nphilosophically self-contained or freestanding than are most\ncontemporary definitions of art. Each classical definition stands in\nclose and complicated relationships to its system\u2019s other\ncomplexly interwoven parts \u2013 epistemology, ontology, value theory,\nphilosophy of mind, etc.  Relatedly, great philosophers\ncharacteristically analyze the key theoretical components of their\ndefinitions of art in distinctive and subtle ways. For these reasons,\nunderstanding such definitions in isolation from the systems or\ncorpuses of which they are parts is difficult, and brief summaries are\ninvariably somewhat misleading.  Nevertheless, some representative\nexamples of historically influential definitions of art offered by\nmajor figures in the history of philosophy should be mentioned.\n2.1 Some examples\n\n\nPlato holds in the Republic and elsewhere that the arts are\nrepresentational, or mimetic (sometimes translated\n\u201cimitative\u201d).  Artworks are ontologically dependent on,\nimitations of, and therefore inferior to, ordinary physical\nobjects. Physical objects in turn are ontologically dependent on, and\nimitations of, and hence inferior to, what is most real, the\nnon-physical unchanging Forms. Grasped perceptually, artworks present\nonly an appearance of an appearance of the Forms, which are grasped by\nreason alone. Consequently, artistic experience cannot yield\nknowledge. Nor do the makers of artworks work from knowledge. Because\nartworks engage an unstable, lower part of the soul, art should be\nsubservient to moral realities, which, along with truth, are more\nmetaphysically fundamental and, properly understood, more humanly\nimportant than, beauty. The arts are not, for Plato, the primary\nsphere in which beauty operates. The Platonic conception of beauty is\nextremely wide and metaphysical: there is a Form of Beauty, which can\nonly be known non-perceptually, but it is more closely related to the\nerotic than to the arts. (See Janaway 1998, the entry on\n Plato\u2019s aesthetics, and the entry on\n Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry.)\n Kant has a definition of art, and of fine art; the latter, which\nKant calls the art of genius, is \u201ca kind of representation that\nis purposive in itself and, though without an end, nevertheless\npromotes the cultivation of the mental powers for sociable\ncommunication\u201d (Kant, Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Guyer translation, section 44, 46).) When fully\nunpacked, the definition has representational, formalist and\nexpressivist elements, and focuses as much on the creative activity of\nthe artistic genius (who, according to Kant, possesses an \u201cinnate\nmental aptitude through which nature gives the rule to art\u201d) as on the\nartworks produced by that activity. Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory is, for\narchitectonic reasons, not focused on art. Art for Kant falls under\nthe broader topic of aesthetic judgment, which covers judgments of the\nbeautiful, judgments of the sublime, and teleological judgments of\nnatural organisms and of nature itself. So Kant\u2019s definition of art is\na relatively small part of his theory of aesthetic judgment. And\nKant\u2019s theory of aesthetic judgment is itself situated in a hugely\nambitious theoretical structure that, famously, aims, to account for,\nand work out the interconnections between, scientific knowledge,\nmorality, and religious faith. (See the entry on\n Kant\u2019s Aesthetics and Teleology \nand the general entry on \n  Immanuel Kant.)\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of art incorporates his view of beauty; he\ndefines beauty as the sensuous/perceptual appearance or expression of\nabsolute truth. The best artworks convey, by sensory/perceptual means,\nthe deepest metaphysical truth.  The deepest metaphysical truth,\naccording to Hegel, is that the universe is the concrete realization\nof what is conceptual or rational. That is, what is conceptual or\nrational is real, and is the imminent force that animates and propels\nthe self-consciously developing universe. The universe is the concrete\nrealization of what is conceptual or rational, and the rational or\nconceptual is superior to the sensory. So, as the mind and its\nproducts alone are capable of truth, artistic beauty is metaphysically\nsuperior to natural beauty (Hegel, Lectures, [1886, 4]). A\ncentral and defining feature of beautiful works of art is that,\nthrough the medium of sensation, each one presents the most\nfundamental values of its\ncivilization.[1]\nArt, therefore, as a cultural expression, operates in the same sphere\nas religion and philosophy, and expresses the same content as\nthey. But art \u201creveals to consciousness the deepest interests of\nhumanity\u201d in a different manner than do religion and philosophy,\nbecause art alone, of the three, works by sensuous means.  So, given\nthe superiority of the conceptual to the non-conceptual, and the fact\nthat art\u2019s medium for expressing/presenting culture\u2019s\ndeepest values is the sensual or perceptual, art\u2019s medium is\nlimited and inferior in comparison with the medium that religion uses\nto express the same content, viz., mental imagery. Art and religion in\nturn are, in this respect, inferior to philosophy, which employs a\nconceptual medium to present its content. Art initially predominates,\nin each civilization, as the supreme mode of cultural expression,\nfollowed, successively, by religion and philosophy. Similarly, because\nthe broadly \u201clogical\u201d relations between art, religion and\nphilosophy determine the actual structure of art, religion, and\nphilosophy, and because cultural ideas about what is intrinsically\nvaluable develop from sensuous to non-sensuous conceptions, history is\ndivided into periods that reflect the teleological development from\nthe sensuous to the conceptual. Art in general, too, develops in\naccord with the historical growth of non-sensuous or conceptual\nconceptions from sensuous conceptions, and each individual art-form\ndevelops historically in the same way (Hegel, Lectures; Wicks\n1993, see also the entries on\n  Hegel and on \n  Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics). \n\nFor treatments of other influential definitions\nof art, inseparable from the complex philosophical systems or corpuses in which\nthey occur, see, for example, the entries on\n 18th Century German Aesthetics,\n Arthur Schopenhauer,\n Friedrich Nietzsche,\n and Dewey\u2019s Aesthetics.\n3. Skepticism about Definitions of Art \n\n\nSkeptical doubts about the possibility and value of a definition of\nart have figured importantly in the discussion in aesthetics since the\n1950s, and though their influence has subsided somewhat, uneasiness\nabout the definitional project persists. (See section 4, below, and\nalso Kivy 1997, Brand 2000, and Walton 2007).\n3.1 Skepticisms inspired by views of concepts, history, Marxism, feminism\n\n\nA common family of arguments, inspired by Wittgenstein\u2019s\nfamous remarks about games (Wittgenstein 1953), has it that the\nphenomena of art are, by their nature, too diverse to admit of the\nunification that a satisfactory definition strives for, or that a\ndefinition of art, were there to be such a thing, would exert a\nstifling influence on artistic creativity. One expression of this\nimpulse is Weitz\u2019s Open Concept Argument: any concept is\nopen if a case can be imagined which would call for some sort of\ndecision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover it, or\nto close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case;\nall open concepts are indefinable; and there are cases calling for a\ndecision about whether to extend or close the concept of art. Hence art\nis indefinable (Weitz 1956). Against this it is claimed that\nchange does not, in general, rule out the preservation of identity over\ntime, that decisions about concept-expansion may be principled rather\nthan capricious, and that nothing bars a definition of art from\nincorporating a novelty requirement.\n\n\nA second sort of argument, less common today than in the\nheyday of a certain form of extreme Wittgensteinianism, urges that the\nconcepts that make up the stuff of most definitions of art\n(expressiveness, form) are embedded in general philosophical theories\nwhich incorporate traditional metaphysics and epistemology. But since\ntraditional metaphysics and epistemology are prime instances of\nlanguage gone on conceptually confused holiday, definitions of art\nshare in the conceptual confusions of traditional\nphilosophy (Tilghman 1984).\n\n\nA third sort of argument, more historically inflected than the first,\ntakes off from an influential study by the historian of philosophy\nPaul Kristeller, in which he argued that the modern system of the five\nmajor arts [painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry, and music]\nwhich underlies all modern aesthetics \u2026 is of comparatively\nrecent origin and did not assume definite shape before the eighteenth\ncentury, although it had many ingredients which go back to classical,\nmediaeval, and Renaissance thought. (Kristeller, 1951) Since that list of five arts is\nsomewhat arbitrary, and since even those five do not share a single\ncommon nature, but rather are united, at best, only by several\noverlapping features, and since the number of art forms has increased\nsince the eighteenth century, Kristeller\u2019s work may be taken to\nsuggest that our concept of art differs from that of the eighteenth\ncentury. As a matter of historical fact, there simply is no stable\ndefiniendum for a definition of art to capture.\n\n\nA fourth sort of argument suggests that a definition of art stating\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for a thing to\nbe an artwork, is likely to be discoverable only if cognitive science\nmakes it plausible to think that humans categorize things in terms of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. But, the argument continues,\ncognitive science actually supports the view that the structure of\nconcepts mirrors the way humans categorize things \u2013 which is with\nrespect to their similarity to prototypes (or exemplars), and not in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions. So the quest for a\ndefinition of art that states individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions is misguided and not likely to succeed (Dean\n2003). Against this it has been urged that psychological theories\nof concepts like the prototype theory and its relatives can provide at\nbest an account of how people in fact classify things, but not\nan account of correct classifications of extra-psychological\nphenomena, and that, even if relevant, prototype theory and other\npsychological theories of concepts are at present too controversial to\ndraw substantive philosophical morals from (Rey 1983; Adajian 2005).\n\n\nA fifth argument against defining art, with a normative tinge that is\npsychologistic rather than sociopolitical, takes the fact that there\nis no philosophical consensus about the definition of art as reason to\nhold that no unitary concept of art exists.  Concepts of art, like all\nconcepts, after all, should be used for the purpose(s) they best\nserve.  But not all concepts of art serve all purposes equally\nwell. So not all art concepts should be used for the same purposes.\nArt should be defined only if there is a unitary concept of art that\nserves all of art\u2019s various purposes \u2013 historical,\nconventional, aesthetic, appreciative, communicative, and so on.  So,\nsince there is no purpose-independent use of the concept of art, art\nshould not be defined (Mag Uidhir and Magnus 2011; cf. Meskin 2008).\nIn response, it is noted that some account of what makes various\nconcepts of art concepts of art is still required; this\nleaves open the possibility of some degree of unity beneath the\napparent multiplicity. The fact (if it is one) that different concepts\nof art are used for different purposes does not itself imply that they\nare not connected in ordered, to-some-degree systematic ways.  The\nrelation between (say) the historical concept of art and the\nappreciative concept of art is not an accidental, unsystematic\nrelation, like that between river banks and savings banks, but is\nsomething like the relation between Socrates\u2019 healthiness and\nthe healthiness of Socrates\u2019 diet.  That is, it is not evident\nthat there exist a mere arbitrary heap or disjunction of art concepts,\nconstituting an unsystematic patchwork. Perhaps there is a single\nconcept of art with different facets that interlock in an ordered way,\nor else a multiplicity of concepts that constitute a unity because one\nis at the core, and the others depend asymmetrically on it. (The last\nis an instance of core-dependent homonymy; see the entry on\n Aristotle, section on Essentialism and\nHomonymy.) Multiplicity alone doesn\u2019t entail pluralism.\n\nA sixth, broadly Marxian sort of objection rejects the project of\ndefining art as an unwitting (and confused) expression of a harmful\nideology. On this view, the search for a definition of art\npresupposes, wrongly, that the concept of the aesthetic is a\ncreditable one. But since the concept of the aesthetic necessarily\ninvolves the equally bankrupt concept of disinterestedness, its use\nadvances the illusion that what is most real about things can and\nshould be grasped or contemplated without attending to the social and\neconomic conditions of their production. Definitions of art,\nconsequently, spuriously confer ontological dignity and respectability\non social phenomena that probably in fact call more properly for\nrigorous social criticism and change. Their real function is\nideological, not philosophical (Eagleton 1990).\n\n\nSeventh, the members of a complex of skeptically-flavored arguments,\nfrom feminist philosophy of art, begin with premises to the effect\nthat art and art-related concepts and practices have been\nsystematically skewed by sex or gender.  Such premises are supported\nby a variety of considerations. (a) The artworks the Western artistic\ncanon recognizes as great are dominated by male-centered perspectives\nand stereotypes, and almost all the artists the canon recognizes as\ngreat are men \u2013 unsurprisingly, given economic, social, and\ninstitutional impediments that prevented women from making art at all.\nMoreover, the concept of genius developed historically in such a way\nas to exclude women artists (Battersby, 1989, Korsmeyer 2004). (b) The\nfine arts\u2019 focus on purely aesthetic, non-utilitarian value resulted\nin the marginalization as mere \u201ccrafts\u201d of items of considerable\naesthetic interest made and used by women for domestic practical\npurposes.  Moreover, because all aesthetic judgments are situated and\nparticular, there can be no such thing as disinterested taste.  If\nthere is no such thing as disinterested taste, then it is hard to see\nhow there could be universal standards of aesthetic excellence.  The\nnon-existence of universal standards of aesthetic excellence\nundermines the idea of an artistic canon (and with it the project of\ndefining art).  Art as historically constituted, and art-related\npractices and concepts, then, reflect views and practices that\npresuppose and perpetuate the subordination of women.  The data that\ndefinitions of art are supposed to explain are biased, corrupt and\nincomplete. As a consequence, present definitions of art,\nincorporating or presupposing as they do a framework that incorporates\na history of systematically biased, hierarchical, fragmentary, and\nmistaken understandings of art and art-related phenomena and concepts,\nmay be so androcentric as to be untenable. Some theorists have\nsuggested that different genders have systematically unique artistic\nstyles, methods, or modes of appreciating and valuing art.  If so,\nthen a separate canon and gynocentric definitions of art are indicated\n(Battersby 1989, Frueh 1991).  In any case, in the face of these\nfacts, the project of defining art in anything like the traditional\nway is to be regarded with suspicion (Brand, 2000).\n\n\nAn eighth argument sort of skeptical argument concludes that, insofar\nas almost all contemporary definitions foreground the nature of\nartworks, rather than the individual arts to which\n(most? all?) artworks belong, they are philosophically unproductive\n(Lopes, \n2014).[2]\n The grounds for this conclusion concern disagreements among standard\ndefinitions as to the artistic status of entities whose status is for\ntheoretical reasons unclear \u2013 e.g., things like ordinary bottleracks\n(Duchamp\u2019s Bottlerack) and silence (John Cage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033).\nIf these hard cases are artworks, what makes them so, given their\napparent lack of any of the traditional properties of artworks? Are,\nthey, at best, marginal cases?  On the other hand, if they are not\nartworks, then why have generations of experts \u2013 art historians,\ncritics, and collectors \u2013 classified them as such? And to whom else\nshould one look to determine the true nature of art? (There are, it is\nclaimed, few or no empirical studies of art full stop, though\nempirical studies of the individual arts abound.) Such disputes\ninevitably end in stalemate. Stalemate results because (a) standard\nartwork-focused definitions of art endorse different criteria of\ntheory choice, and (b) on the basis of their preferred criteria,\nappeal to incompatible intuitions about the status of such\ntheoretically-vexed cases.  In consequence, disagreements between\nstandard definitions of art that foreground artworks are\nunresolvable. To avoid this stalemate, an alternative definitional\nstrategy that foregrounds the arts rather than individual artworks, is\nindicated. (See section 4.5.)\n3.2 Some descendants of skepticism\n\n\nPhilosophers influenced by the moderate Wittgensteinian strictures\ndiscussed above have offered family resemblance accounts of art, which,\nas they purport to be non-definitions, may be usefully considered at\nthis point. Two species of family resemblance views will be considered:\nthe resemblance-to-a-paradigm version, and the cluster\nversion.\n\n\nOn the resemblance-to-a-paradigm version, something is, or is\nidentifiable as, an artwork if it resembles, in the right way, certain\nparadigm artworks, which possess most although not necessarily all of\nart\u2019s typical features. (The \u201cis identifiable\u201d\nqualification is intended to make the family resemblance view something\nmore epistemological than a definition, although it is unclear that\nthis really avoids a commitment to constitutive claims about\nart\u2019s nature.) Against this view: since things do not\nresemble each other simpliciter, but only in at least one\nrespect or other, the account is either far too inclusive, since\neverything resembles everything else in some respect or other, or, if\nthe variety of resemblance is specified, tantamount to a definition,\nsince resemblance in that respect will be either a necessary or\nsufficient condition for being an artwork. The family resemblance\nview raises questions, moreover, about the membership and unity of the\nclass of paradigm artworks. If the account lacks an explanation of why\nsome items and not others go on the list of paradigm works, it seems\nexplanatorily deficient. But if it includes a principle that governs\nmembership on the list, or if expertise is required to constitute the\nlist, then the principle, or whatever properties the experts\u2019\njudgments track, seem to be doing the philosophical work.\n\n\nThe cluster version of the family resemblance view has been defended\nby a number of philosophers (Bond 1975, Dissanayake 1990, Dutton\n2006, Gaut 2000). The view typically provides a list of properties, no one of\nwhich is a necessary condition for being a work of art, but which are\njointly sufficient for being a work of art, and which is such that at\nleast one proper subset thereof is sufficient for being a work of\nart. Lists offered vary, but overlap considerably. Here is one, due to Gaut: (1)\npossessing positive aesthetic properties; (2) being expressive of\nemotion; (3) being intellectually challenging; (4) being formally\ncomplex and coherent; (5) having the capacity to convey complex\nmeanings; (6) exhibiting an individual point of view; (7) being\noriginal; (8) being an artifact or performance which is the product of\na high degree of skill; (9) belonging to an established artistic form;\n(10) being the product of an intention to make a work of art (Gaut\n2000). The cluster account has been criticized on several grounds.\nFirst, given its logical structure, it is in fact equivalent to a\nlong, complicated, but finite, disjunction, which makes it difficult\nto see why it isn\u2019t a definition (Davies 2006). Second, if the list\nof properties is incomplete, as some cluster theorists hold, then some\njustification or principle would be needed for extending it.  Third,\nthe inclusion of the ninth property on the list, belonging to an\nestablished art form, seems to regenerate (or duck), rather than answer, the\ndefinitional question. Finally, it is worth noting that, although\ncluster theorists stress what they take to be the motley heterogeneity of the\nclass of artworks, they tend with surprising regularity to tacitly\ngive the aesthetic a special, perhaps unifying, status among the\nproperties they put forward as merely disjunctive.  One cluster\ntheorist, for example, gives a list very similar to the one discussed\nabove (it includes representational properties, expressiveness,\ncreativity, exhibiting a high degree of skill, belonging to an\nestablished artform), but omits aesthetic properties on the grounds\nthat it is the combination of the other items on the list which,\ncombined in the experience of the work of art, are precisely the\naesthetic qualities of the work (Dutton 2006). Gaut, whose list is\ncited above, includes aesthetic properties as a separate item on the\nlist, but construes them very narrowly; the difference between these\nways of formulating the cluster view appears to be mainly nominal. And\nan earlier cluster theorist defines artworks as all and only those\nthings that belong to any instantiation of an artform, offers a list\nof seven properties all of which together are intended to capture the\ncore of what it is to be an artform, though none is either necessary\nor sufficient, and then claims that having aesthetic value (of the\nsame sort as mountains, sunsets, mathematical theorems) is \u201cwhat\nart is for\u201d (Bond 1975). \n4. Contemporary Definitions\n Definitions of art attempt to make sense of two different sorts of\nfacts: art has important historically contingent cultural features, as\nwell as trans-historical, pan-cultural characteristics that point in\nthe direction of a relatively stable aesthetic core.  (Theorists who\nregard art as an invention of eighteenth-century Europe will, of\ncourse, regard this way of putting the matter as tendentious, on the\ngrounds that entities produced outside that culturally distinctive\ninstitution do not fall under the extension of \u201cart\u201d and\nhence are irrelevant to the art-defining project (Shiner\n2001). Whether the concept of art is precise enough to justify this\nmuch confidence about what falls under its extension claim is\nunclear.) Conventionalist definitions take art\u2019s contingent\ncultural features to be explanatorily fundamental, and aim to capture\nthe phenomena \u2013 revolutionary modern art, the traditional close\nconnection of art with the aesthetic, the possibility of autonomous\nart traditions, etc. \u2013 in social/historical\nterms. Classically-flavored or traditional definitions (also sometimes\ncalled \u201cfunctionalist\u201d) definitions reverse this\nexplanatory order.  Such classically-flavored definitions take\ntraditional concepts like the aesthetic (or allied concepts like the\nformal, or the expressive) as basic, and aim to account for the\nphenomena by making those concepts harder \u2013 for example, by\nendorsing a concept of the aesthetic rich enough to include\nnon-perceptual properties, or by attempting an integration of those\nconcepts (e.g., Eldridge, section 4.4 below) .\n4.1 Conventionalist Definitions: Institutional and Historical\n\n\nConventionalist definitions deny that art has essential connection to\naesthetic properties, or to formal properties, or to expressive\nproperties, or to any type of property taken by traditional\ndefinitions to be essential to art. Conventionalist definitions have\nbeen strongly influenced by the emergence, in the twentieth century,\nof artworks that seem to differ radically from all previous\nartworks. Avant-garde works like Marcel Duchamp\u2019s\n\u201cready-mades\u201d \u2013 ordinary unaltered objects like\nsnow-shovels (In Advance of the Broken Arm) and \nbottle-racks \u2013 conceptual works like Robert Barry\u2019s All the things I know\nbut of which I am not at the moment thinking \u2013 1:36 PM; June 15,\n1969, and John Cage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033, have seemed to\nmany philosophers to lack or even, somehow, repudiate, the traditional\nproperties of art: intended aesthetic interest, artifactuality, even\nperceivability. Conventionalist definitions have also been strongly\ninfluenced by the work of a number of historically-minded\nphilosophers, who have documented the rise and development of modern\nideas of the fine arts, the individual arts, the work of art, and the\naesthetic (Kristeller, Shiner, Carroll, Goehr, Kivy).\n\n\nConventionalist definitions come in two varieties, institutional and\nhistorical. Institutionalist conventionalism, or institutionalism, a\nsynchronic view, typically hold that to be a work of art is to be an\nartifact of a kind created, by an artist, to be presented to an\nartworld public (Dickie 1984). Historical conventionalism, a\ndiachronic view, holds that artworks necessarily stand in an\nart-historical relation to some set of earlier artworks.\n4.2 Institutional Definitions\n\n\nThe groundwork for institutional definitions was laid by Arthur Danto,\nbetter known to non-philosophers as the long-time influential art\ncritic for the Nation. Danto coined the term\n\u201cartworld\u201d, by which he meant \u201can atmosphere of art\ntheory.\u201d Danto\u2019s definition has been glossed as follows:\nsomething is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii)\nabout which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style)\n(iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which\nellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing,\nand (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof\nrequire an art historical context (Danto, Carroll).  Clause (iv) is\nwhat makes the definition institutionalist.  The view has been\ncriticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly\nrhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account\nof what makes a context art historical, and for not applying\nto music. \n\n\nThe most prominent and influential institutionalism is that of George\nDickie. Dickie\u2019s institutionalism has evolved over\ntime. According to an early version, a work of art is an artifact upon\nwhich some person(s) acting on behalf of the artworld has conferred\nthe status of candidate for appreciation (Dickie 1974).  Dickie\u2019s more\nrecent version consists of an interlocking set of five definitions:\n(1) An artist is a person who participates with understanding in the\nmaking of a work of art. (2) A work of art is an artifact of a kind\ncreated to be presented to an artworld public.  (3) A public is a set\nof persons the members of which are prepared in some degree to\nunderstand an object which is presented to them. (4) The artworld is\nthe totality of all artworld systems. (5) An artworld system is a\nframework for the presentation of a work of art by an artist to an\nartworld public (Dickie 1984). Both versions have been widely\ncriticized. Philosophers have objected that art created outside any\ninstitution seems possible, although the definition rules it out, and\nthat the artworld, like any institution, seems capable of error. It\nhas also been urged that the definition\u2019s obvious circularity is\nvicious, and that, given the inter-definition of the key concepts\n(artwork, artworld system, artist, artworld public) it lacks any\ninformative way of distinguishing art institutions systems\nfrom other, structurally similar, social institutions (D. Davies 2004,\npp. 248\u2013249, notes that both the artworld and the\n\u201ccommerceworld\u201d seem to fall under that definition). Early\non, Dickie claimed that anyone who sees herself as a member of the\nartworld is a member of the artworld: if this is true, then\nunless there are constraints on the kinds of things the artworld can\nput forward as artworks or candidate artworks, any entity can be an\nartwork (though not all are), which appears overly expansive. Finally,\nMatravers has helpfully distinguished strong and\nweak institutionalism. Strong institutionalism holds that\nthere is some reason that is always the reason the art institution has\nfor saying that something is a work of art. Weak institutionalism\nholds that, for every work of art, there is some reason or other that\nthe institution has for saying that it is a work of art (Matravers\n2000). Weak institutionalism, in particular, raises questions about\nart\u2019s unity: if absolutely nothing unifies the reasons that the\nartworld gives for conferring art-hood on things, then the unity of\nthe class of artworks is vanishingly small.  Conventionalist views,\nwith their emphasis on art\u2019s heterogeneity, swallow this\nimplication. From the perspective of traditional definitions, doings\nso underplays art\u2019s substantial if incomplete unity, while leaving it\na puzzle why art would be worth caring about.  \n Some recent versions of institutionalism depart from Dickie\u2019s by\naccepting the burden, which Dickie rejected, of providing a\nsubstantive, non-circular account of what it is to be an art\ninstitution or an artworld.  One, due to David Davies, does so by\nbuilding in Nelson Goodman\u2019s account of aesthetic symbolic\nfunctions. Another, due to Abell, combines Searle\u2019s account of social\ninstitutions with Gaut\u2019s characterization of art-making properties,\nand builds an account of artistic value on that coupling.\n\nDavies\u2019 neo-institutionalism holds that making an artwork\nrequires articulating an artistic statement, which requires specifying\nartistic properties, which in turn requires the manipulation of an\nartistic vehicle.  Goodman\u2019s \u201csymptoms of the\naesthetic\u201d are utilized to clarify the conditions under which a\npractice of making is a practice of artistic making: on\nGoodman\u2019s view, a symbol functions aesthetically when it is\nsyntactically dense, semantically dense, relatively replete, and\ncharacterized by multiple and complex reference (D. Davies 2004;\nGoodman 1968; see the entry on\n  Goodman\u2019s aesthetics).\nManipulating an artistic vehicle is in turn possible only if the\nartist consciously operates with reference to shared understandings\nembodied in the practices of a community of receivers. So art\u2019s\nnature is institutional in the broad sense (or, perhaps better,\nsocio-cultural).  By way of criticism, Davies\u2019\nneo-institutionalism may be questioned on the grounds that, since all\npictorial symbols are syntactically dense, semantically dense,\nrelatively replete, and often exemplify the properties they represent,\nit seems to entail that every colored picture, including those in any\ncatalog of industrial products, is an artwork (Abell 2012).\n\n\nAbell\u2019s institutional definition adapts Searle\u2019s view of social kinds:\nwhat it is for some social kind, F, to be F is for it to be\ncollectively believed to be F (Abell 2012; Searle 1995, 2010;\nand see the entry on\n  social institutions).\nOn Abell\u2019s view, more specifically, an institution\u2019s type is\ndetermined by the valued function(s) that it was collectively believed\nat its inception to promote. The valued functions collective belief in\nwhich make an institution an art institution are those spelled out by\nGaut in his cluster account (see section 3.1, above). That is,\nsomething is an art institution if and only if it is an institution\nwhose existence is due to its being perceived to perform certain\nfunctions, which functions form a significant subset of the following:\npromoting positive aesthetic qualities; promoting the expression of\nemotion; facilitating the posing of intellectual challenges, and the\nrest of Gaut\u2019s list. Plugging in Gaut\u2019s list yields the final\ndefinition: something is an artwork if and only if it is the product\nof an art institution (as just defined) and it directly effects the effectiveness with which that institution performs the perceived functions to which\nits existence is due. One worry is whether Searle\u2019s account of\ninstitutions is up to the task required of it. Some institutional\nsocial kinds have this trait: something can fail to be a token of that\nkind even if there is collective agreement that it counts as a token\nof that kind. Suppose someone gives a big cocktail party, to which\neveryone in Paris invited, and things get so out of hand that the\ncasualty rate is greater than the Battle of Austerlitz. Even if\neveryone thinks the event was a cocktail party, it is possible\n(contrary to Searle) that they are mistaken: it may have been a war or\nbattle. It\u2019s not clear that art isn\u2019t like this. If so, then the fact\nthat an institution is collectively believed to be an art institution\nneedn\u2019t suffice to make it so (Khalidi 2013; see also the entry on\n  social \ninstitutions).[3]\nA second worry: if its failure to specify which subsets of the ten\ncluster properties suffice to make something an artwork significantly\nflaws Gaut\u2019s cluster account, then failure to specify which subsets of\nGaut\u2019s ten properties suffice to make something an art institution\nsignificantly flaws Abellian institutionalism.\n4.3 Historical Definitions\n\n\nHistorical definitions hold that what characterizes artworks is\nstanding in some specified art-historical relation to some specified\nearlier artworks, and disavow any commitment to a trans-historical\nconcept of art, or the \u201cartish.\u201d Historical definitions\ncome in several varieties. All of them are, or resemble, inductive\ndefinitions: they claim that certain entities belong unconditionally\nto the class of artworks, while others do so because they stand in the\nappropriate relations thereto. According to the best known version,\nLevinson\u2019s intentional-historical definition, an artwork is a thing\nthat has been seriously intended for regard in any way preexisting or\nprior artworks are or were correctly regarded (Levinson 1990).  A\nsecond version, historical narrativism, comes in several varieties. On\none, a sufficient but not necessary condition for the identification\nof a candidate as a work of art is the construction of a true\nhistorical narrative according to which the candidate was created by\nan artist in an artistic context with a recognized and live artistic\nmotivation, and as a result of being so created, it resembles at least\none acknowledged artwork (Carroll 1993). On another, more ambitious\nand overtly nominalistic version of historical narrativism, something\nis an artwork if and only if (1) there are internal historical\nrelations between it and already established artworks; (2) these\nrelations are correctly identified in a narrative; and (3) that\nnarrative is accepted by the relevant experts. The experts do\nnot detect that certain entities are artworks; rather, the\nfact that the experts assert that certain properties are significant\nin particular cases is constitutive of art (Stock 2003).\n\n\nThe similarity of these views to institutionalism is obvious, and\nthe criticisms offered parallel those urged against institutionalism.\nFirst, historical definitions appear to require, but lack, any\ninformative characterization of art traditions (art functions, artistic\ncontexts, etc.) and hence any way of informatively distinguishing them\n(and likewise art functions, or artistic predecessors) from\nnon-art traditions (non-art functions, non-artistic\npredecessors). Correlatively, non-Western art, or alien, autonomous\nart of any kind appears to pose a problem for historical views: any\nautonomous art tradition or artworks \u2013 terrestrial,\nextra-terrestrial, or merely possible \u2013 causally isolated from\nour art tradition, is either ruled out by the definition, which seems\nto be a reductio, or included, which concedes the existence\nof a supra-historical concept of art. So, too, there could be entities\nthat for adventitious reasons are not correctly identified in\nhistorical narratives, although in actual fact they stand in relations\nto established artworks that make them correctly describable\nin narratives of the appropriate sort.  Historical definitions entail\nthat such entities aren\u2019t artworks, but it seems at least as \nplausible to say that they are artworks that are not identified as such.  Second,\nhistorical definitions also require, but do not provide a\nsatisfactory, informative account of the basis case \u2013 the first\nartworks, or ur-artworks, in the case of the intentional-historical\ndefinitions, or the first or central art-forms, in the case of\nhistorical functionalism.  Third, nominalistic historical definitions\nseem to face a version of the Euthyphro dilemma. For either\nsuch definitions include substantive characterizations of what it is\nto be an expert, or they don\u2019t. If, on one hand, they include no\ncharacterization of what it is to be an expert, and hence no\nexplanation as to why the list of experts contains the people it does,\nthen they imply that what makes things artworks is inexplicable.  On\nthe other hand, suppose such definitions provide a substantive account\nof what it is to be an expert, so that to be an expert is to possess\nsome ability lacked by non-experts (taste, say) in virtue of the\npossession of which they are able to discern historical connections\nbetween established artworks and candidate artworks.  Then the\ndefinition\u2019s claim to be interestingly historical is\nquestionable, because it makes art status a function of whatever\nability it is that permits experts to discern the art-making\nproperties. \n\n\nDefenders of historical definitions have replies. First, as regards\nautonomous art traditions, it can be held that anything we would\nrecognize as an art tradition or an artistic\npractice would display aesthetic concerns, because aesthetic concerns\nhave been central from the start, and persisted centrally for\nthousands of years, in the Western art tradition. Hence it is an\nhistorical, not a conceptual truth that anything we recognize as an\nart practice will centrally involve the aesthetic; it is just that\naesthetic concerns that have always dominated our art tradition\n(Levinson 2002). The idea here is that if the reason that anything\nwe\u2019d take to be a \u03a6-tradition would have \u03a8-concerns is\nthat our \u03a6-tradition has focused on \u03a8-concerns since its\ninception, then it is not essential to \u03a6-traditions that they have\n\u03a8-concerns, and \u03a6 is a purely historical concept. But\nthis principle entails, implausibly, that every concept is purely\nhistorical. Suppose that we discovered a new civilization whose\ninhabitants could predict how the physical world works with great\nprecision, on the basis of a substantial body of empirically acquired\nknowledge that they had accumulated over centuries. The reason we\nwould credit them with having a scientific tradition might\nwell be that our own scientific tradition has since its inception\nfocused on explaining things. It does not seem to follow that science\nis a purely historical concept with no essential connection to\nexplanatory aims. (Other theorists hold that it is historically\nnecessary that art begins with the aesthetic, but deny that\nart\u2019s nature is to be defined in terms of its historical\nunfolding (Davies 1997).) Second, as to the first artworks, or the\ncentral art-forms or functions, some theorists hold that an account of\nthem can only take the form of an enumeration. Stecker takes this\napproach: he says that the account of what makes something a central\nart form at a given time is, at its core, institutional, and that the\ncentral artforms can only be listed (Stecker 1997 and 2005). Whether\nrelocating the list at a different, albeit deeper, level in the\ndefinition renders the definition sufficiently informative is an open\nquestion. Third, as to the Euthyphro-style dilemma, it might\nbe held that the categorial distinction between artworks and\n\u201cmere real things\u201d (Danto 1981) explains the distinction\nbetween experts and non-experts. Experts are able, it is said, to\ncreate new categories of art. When created, new categories bring with\nthem new universes of discourse. New universes of discourse in turn\nmake reasons available that otherwise would not be available.  Hence,\non this view, it is both the case that the experts\u2019 say-so alone\nsuffices to make mere real things into artworks, and also true that\nexperts\u2019 conferrals of art-status have reasons (McFee\n2011). \n4.4 Traditional (mainly aesthetic) definitions\n\n\nTraditional definitions take some function(s) or intended function(s)\nto be definitive of artworks. Here only aesthetic definitions, which\nconnect art essentially with the aesthetic \u2013 aesthetic judgments,\nexperience, or properties \u2013 will be considered. Different\naesthetic definitions incorporate different views of aesthetic\nproperties and judgments. See the entry on \n aesthetic judgment.\n\n\nAs noted above, some philosophers lean heavily on a distinction\nbetween aesthetic properties and artistic properties, taking the\nformer to be perceptually striking qualities that can be directly\nperceived in works, without knowledge of their origin and purpose, and\nthe latter to be relational properties that works possess in virtue of\ntheir relations to art history, art genres, etc. It is also, of\ncourse, possible to hold a less restrictive view of aesthetic\nproperties, on which aesthetic properties need not be perceptual; on\nthis broader view, it is unnecessary to deny what it seems pointless\nto deny, that abstracta like mathematical entities and scientific laws\npossess aesthetic properties.)\n\n\nMonroe Beardsley\u2019s definition holds that an artwork:\n\u201ceither an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of\naffording an experience with marked aesthetic character or\n(incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of\narrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity\u201d\n(Beardsley 1982, 299).  (For more on Beardsley, see the entry on \n Beardsley\u2019s aesthetics.) \nBeardsley\u2019s conception of aesthetic experience is Deweyan:\naesthetic experiences are experiences that are complete, unified,\nintense experiences of the way things appear to us, and are, moreover,\nexperiences which are controlled by the things experienced (see the\nentry on\n Dewey\u2019s aesthetics).\nZangwill\u2019s aesthetic definition of art says that something is a\nwork of art if and only if someone had an insight that certain\naesthetic properties would be determined by certain nonaesthetic\nproperties, and for this reason the thing was intentionally endowed\nwith the aesthetic properties in virtue of the nonaesthetic properties\nas envisaged in the insight (Zangwill 1995a,b). Aesthetic properties\nfor Zangwill are those judgments that are the subject of\n\u201cverdictive aesthetic judgments\u201d (judgements of beauty and\nugliness) and \u201csubstantive aesthetic judgements\u201d (e.g., of\ndaintiness, elegance, delicacy, etc.). The latter are ways of being\nbeautiful or ugly; aesthetic in virtue of a special close relation to\nverdictive judgments, which are subjectively universal. Other\naesthetic definitions build in different accounts of the\naesthetic. Eldridge\u2019s aesthetic definition holds that the satisfying appropriateness to one another of a thing\u2019s form and content is the aesthetic quality possession of which is necessary and sufficient for\na thing\u2019s being art (Eldridge 1985). Or one might define aesthetic\nproperties as those having an evaluative component, whose perception\ninvolves the perception of certain formal base properties, such as\nshape and color (De Clercq 2002), and construct an aesthetic\ndefinition incorporating that view.\n\n\nViews which combine features of institutional and aesthetic\ndefinitions also exist. Iseminger, for example, builds a definition on\nan account of appreciation, on which to appreciate a thing\u2019s\nbeing F is to find experiencing its being F to be\nvaluable in itself, and an account of aesthetic communication (which it\nis the function of the artworld to promote) (Iseminger 2004).\n\n\nAesthetic definitions have been criticized for being both too narrow\nand too broad. They are held to be too narrow because they are unable\nto cover influential modern works like Duchamp\u2019s ready-mades and\nconceptual works like Robert Barry\u2019s All the things I know but of\nwhich I am not at the moment thinking \u2013 1:36 PM; June 15, 1969,\nwhich appear to lack aesthetic properties. (Duchamp famously asserted\nthat his urinal, Fountain, was selected for its lack of\naesthetic features.) Aesthetic definitions are held to be too broad\nbecause beautifully designed automobiles, neatly manicured lawns, and\nproducts of commercial design are often created with the intention of\nbeing objects of aesthetic appreciation, but are not artworks.\nMoreover, aesthetic views have been held to have trouble making sense\nof bad art (see Dickie 2001; Davies 2006, p. 37). Finally, more\nradical doubts about aesthetic definitions center on the\nintelligibility and usefulness of the aesthetic. Beardsley\u2019s view, for\nexample, has been criticized by Dickie, who has also offered\ninfluential criticisms of the idea of an aesthetic attitude (Dickie\n1965, Cohen 1973, Kivy 1975).\n\n\nTo these criticisms several responses have been offered. First, the\nless restrictive conception of aesthetic properties mentioned above,\non which they may be based on non-perceptual formal properties, can be\ndeployed. On this view, conceptual works would have aesthetic\nfeatures, much the same way that mathematical entities are often\nclaimed to (Shelley 2003, Carroll 2004). Second, a distinction may be\ndrawn between time-sensitive properties, whose standard observation\nconditions include an essential reference to the temporal location of\nthe observer, and non-time-sensitive properties, which do not.\nHigher-order aesthetic properties like drama, humor, and irony, which\naccount for a significant part of the appeal of Duchamp\u2019s and\nCage\u2019s works, on this view, would derive from time-sensitive\nproperties (Zemach 1997). Third, it might be held that it is the\ncreative act of presenting something that is in the\nrelevant sense unfamiliar, into a new context, the artworld, which has\naesthetic properties. Or, fourth, it might be held that\n(Zangwill\u2019s \u201csecond-order\u201d strategy) works like\nready-mades lack aesthetic functions, but are parasitic upon, because\nmeant to be considered in the context of, works that do have aesthetic\nfunctions, and therefore constitute marginal borderline cases of art\nthat do not merit the theoretical primacy they are often\ngiven. Finally, it can be flatly denied that the ready-mades were\nworks of art (Beardsley 1982).\n\n\nAs to the over-inclusiveness of aesthetic definitions, a distinction\nmight be drawn between primary and secondary functions. Or it may be\nmaintained that some cars, lawns, and products of industrial design are\non the art/non-art borderline, and so don\u2019t constitute clear\nand decisive counter-examples. Or, if the claim that aesthetic theories\nfail to account for bad art depends on holding that some works have\nabsolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever, as opposed to some\nnon-zero amount, however infinitesimal, it may be wondered what\njustifies that assumption. \n4.5 Hybrid (Disjunctive) Definitions\n\n\nHybrid definitions characteristically disjoin at least one\ninstitutional component with at least one aesthetic component, aiming\nthereby to accommodate both more traditional art and avant-garde art\nthat appears to lack any significant aesthetic dimension.  (Such\ndefinitions could also be classified as institutional, on the grounds\nthat they make provenance sufficient for being a work of art.) Hence\nthey inherit a feature of conventionalist definitions: in appealing to\nart institutions, artworlds, arts, art functions, and so on, they\neither include substantive accounts of what it is to be an\nartinstitution/world/genre/-form/function, or are\nuninformatively circular.\n\n\nOne such disjunctive definition, Longworth and Scarantino\u2019s, adapts\nGaut\u2019s list of ten clustering properties, where that list (see 3.5\nabove) includes institutional properties (e.g., belonging to an\nestablished art form) and traditional ones (e.g., possessing positive\naesthetic properties); see also Longworth and Scarantino 2010. The\ncore idea is that art is defined by a disjunction of minimally\nsufficient and disjunctively necessary conditions; to say that a\ndisjunct is a minimally sufficient constitutive condition for\nart-hood, is to say that every proper subset of it is insufficient for\nart-hood. An account of what it is for a concept to have disjunctive\ndefining conditions is also supplied.  The definition of art itself is\nas follows: \u2203Z\u2203Y (Art iff (Z \u2228\nY)), where (a) Z and Y, formed from properties on\nGaut\u2019s cluster list, are either non-empty conjunctions or non-empty\ndisjunctions of conjunctions or individual properties; (b) there is\nsome indeterminacy over exactly which disjuncts are sufficient; (c)\nZ does not entail Y and Y does not entail\nZ; (d) Z does not entail Art and Y does not\nentail Art. Instantiation of either Z or Y suffices for\nart-hood; something can be art only if at least one of Z,\nY is instantiated; and the third condition is included to\nprevent the definition from collapsing into a classical one. The\naccount of what it is for concept C to have disjunctive\ndefining conditions is as follows: C iff (Z \u2228\nY), where (i) Z and Y are non-empty conjunctions\nor non-empty disjunctions of conjunctions or individual properties;\n(ii) Z does not entail Y and Y does not entail\nZ; (iii) Z does not entail C and Y does not\nentail C. A worry concerns condition (iii): as written, it seems to\nrender the account of disjunctive defining conditions\nself-contradictory.  For if Z and Y are each minimally\nsufficient for C, it is impossible that Z does not\nentail C and that Y does not entail C. If so,\nthen nothing can satisfy the conditions said to be necessary and\nsufficient for a concept to have disjunctive defining conditions.\n\n\nA second disjunctive hybrid definition, with an historical cast,\nRobert Stecker\u2019s historical functionalism, holds that an item is an\nartwork at time t, where t is not earlier than the\ntime at which the item is made, if and only if it is in one of the\ncentral art forms at t and is made with the intention of\nfulfilling a function art has at t or it is an artifact that\nachieves excellence in achieving such a function (Stecker 2005).  A\nquestion for Stecker\u2019s view is whether or not it provides an adequate\naccount of what it is for a function to be an art function, and\nwhether, consequently, it can accommodate anti-aesthetic or\nnon-aesthetic art. The grounds given for thinking that it can are\nthat, while art\u2019s original functions were aesthetic, those functions,\nand the intentions with which art is made, can change in unforeseeable\nways. Moreover, aesthetic properties are not always preeminent in\nart\u2019s predecessor concepts (Stecker 2000). A worry is that if the\noperative assumption is that if x belongs to a predecessor\ntradition of T then x belongs to T, the\npossibility is not ruled out that if, for example, the tradition of\nmagic is a predecessor tradition of the scientific tradition, then\nentities that belong to the magic tradition but lacking any of the\nstandard hallmarks of science are scientific entities.\n\n\nA third hybrid definition, also disjunctive, is the cladistic\ndefinition defended by Stephen Davies.  who holds that something is\nart (a) if it shows excellence of skill and achievement in realizing\nsignificant aesthetic goals, and either doing so is its primary,\nidentifying function or doing so makes a vital contribution to the\nrealization of its primary, identifying function, or (b) if it falls\nunder an art genre or art form established and publicly recognized\nwithin an art tradition, or (c) if it is intended by its\nmaker/presenter to be art and its maker/presenter does what is\nnecessary and appropriate to realizing that intention (Davies, 2015).\n(In biology, a clade is a segment in the tree of life: a group\nof organisms and the common ancestor they share.) Artworlds are to be\ncharacterized in terms of their origins: they begin with prehistoric\nart ancestors, and grow into artworlds. Hence all artworks occupy a\nline of descent from their prehistoric art ancestors; that line of\ndescent comprises an art tradition that grows into an artworld.  So\nthe definition is bottom-up and resolutely anthropocentric. A worry:\nthe view seems to entail that art traditions can undergo any changes\nwhatsoever and remain art traditions, since, no matter how distant,\nevery occupant of the right line of descent is part of the art\ntradition. This seems to amount to saying that as long as they remain\ntraditions at all, art traditions cannot die. Whether art is immortal\nin this sense seems open to question.  A second worry is that the\nrequirement that every art tradition and artworld stand in some line\nof descent from prehistoric humanoids makes it in principle impossible\nfor any nonhuman species to make art, as long as that species fails to\noccupy the right location in the tree of life. While the\nepistemological challenges that identifying artworks made by nonhumans\nmight pose could be very considerable, this consequence of the\ncladistic definition\u2019s emphasis on lineage rather than traits raises a\nconcern about excessively insularity.\n\nA fourth hybrid definition is the \u201cbuck-passing\u201d view of Lopes, which\nattempts an escape from the stalemate between artwork-focused\ndefinitions over avant-garde anti-aesthetic cases by adopting a\nstrategy that shifts the focus of the definition of art away from\nartworks.  The strategy is to recenter philosophical efforts on\ndifferent problems, which require attention anyway: (a) the problem of\ngiving an account of each individual art, and (b) the problem of\ndefining what it is to be an art, the latter by giving an account of\nthe larger class of normative/appreciative kinds to which the arts\n(and some non-arts) belong. For, given definitions of the individual\narts, and a definition of what it is to be an art, if every artwork\nbelongs to at least one art (if it belongs to no existing art, then it\npioneers a new art), then a definition of artwork falls out: x\nis a work of art if and only if x is a work of K, where K is an\nart (Lopes 2014). When fully spelled out, the definition is\ndisjunctive: x is a work of art if and only if x is a\nwork belonging to art1 or x is a work belonging to\nart2 or x is a work belonging to art3\n\u2026. Most of the explanatory work is done by the theories of the\nindividual arts, since, given the assumption that every artwork\nbelongs to at least one art, possession of theories of the individual\narts would be necessary and sufficient for settling the artistic or\nnon-artistic status of any hard case, once it is determined what art a\ngiven work belongs to. As to what makes a practice an art, Lopes\u2019\npreferred answer seems to be institutionalism of a Dickiean variety:\nan art is an institution in which artists (persons who participate\nwith understanding in the making of artworks) make artworks to be\npresented to an artworld public. (Lopes 2014, Dickie 1984) Thus, on\nthis view, it is arbitrary which activities are artworld systems:\nthere is no deeper answer to the question of what makes music an art\nthan that it has the right institutional\n structure.[4] \nSo it is arbitrary which activities are arts. Two worries. First, the\nkey claim that every work of art belonging to no extant art pioneers a\nnew art may be defended on the grounds that any reason to say that a\nwork belonging to no extant artform is an artwork is a reason to say\nthat it pioneers a new artform.  In response, it is noted that the\nquestion of whether or not a thing belongs to an art arises only when,\nand because, there is a prior reason for thinking that the thing is an\nartwork.  So it seems that what it is to be an artwork is prior, in\nsome sense, to what it is to be an art.  Second, on the buck-passing\ntheory\u2019s institutional theory of the arts, which activities are arts\nis arbitrary.  This raises a version of the question that was raised\nabout the cladistic definition\u2019s ability to account for the existence\nof art outside our (Hominin) tradition.  Suppose the connection\nbetween a practice\u2019s traits and its status as an art are wholly\ncontingent. Then the fact that a practice in another culture that\nalthough not part of our tradition had most of the traits of one of\nour own arts would be no reason to think that practice was an art, and\nno reason to think that the objects belonging to it were artworks. It\nis not clear that we are really so in the dark when it comes to\ndetermining whether practices in alien cultures or traditions are\narts. \n5. Conclusion\n\n\nConventionalist definitions account well for modern art, but have\ndifficulty accounting for art\u2019s universality \u2013 especially\nthe fact that there can be art disconnected from \u201cour\u201d\n(Western) institutions and traditions, and our species.  They also\nstruggle to account for the fact that the same aesthetic terms are\nroutinely applied to artworks, natural objects, humans, and abstracta.\nAesthetic definitions do better accounting for art\u2019s\ntraditional, universal features, but less well, at least according to\ntheir critics, with revolutionary modern art; their further defense\nrequires an account of the aesthetic which can be extended in a\nprincipled way to conceptual and other radical art. (An aesthetic\ndefinition and a conventionalist one could simply be conjoined. But\nthat would merely raise, without answering, the fundamental question\nof the unity or disunity of the class of artworks.) Which defect is\nthe more serious one depends on which explananda are the more\nimportant. Arguments at this level are hard to come by, because\npositions are hard to motivate in ways that do not depend on prior\nconventionalist and functionalist sympathies. If list-like definitions\nare flawed because uninformative, then so are conventionalist\ndefinitions, whether institutional or historical. Of course, if the\nclass of artworks, or of the arts, is a mere chaotic heap, lacking any\ngenuine unity, then enumerative definitions cannot be faulted for\nbeing uninformative: they do all the explaining that it is possible to\ndo, because they capture all the unity that there is to capture. In\nthat case the worry articulated by one prominent aesthetician, who\nwrote earlier of the \u201cbloated, unwieldy\u201d concept of art\nwhich institutional definitions aim to capture, needs to be taken\nseriously, even if it turns out to be ungrounded: \u201cIt is not at\nall clear that these words \u2013 \u2018What is\nart?\u2019 \u2013 express anything like a single question, to which\ncompeting answers are given, or whether philosophers proposing answers\nare even engaged in the same debate\u2026.  The sheer variety of\nproposed definitions should give us pause. One cannot help wondering\nwhether there is any sense in which they are attempts to \u2026\nclarify the same cultural practices, or address the same issue\u201d\n(Walton 2007). \n",
