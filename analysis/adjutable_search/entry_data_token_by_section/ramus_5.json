    "main_text": "Ramist philosophy || Definition of Philosophy\n2.3 Definition of Philosophy\n\nIn 1569 there was a furious exchange of letters between Ramus and one\nof the most prominent and learned Aristotelians of his day, Jacob\nSchegk (1511\u20131587), a professor at the University of\nT\u00fcbingen. The conflict may not have been based solely on a\ndifference of philosophical opinions. Schegk had a grudge against\nRamus, who had pulled one of his books to pieces. The discussion\nnevertheless forced Ramus to reconsider some of his positions.\n\nRamus\u2019 final contribution to the debate was entitled,\ncharacteristically, Defensio pro Aristotele adversus Jacobus\nScheccium, that is, a defense of Aristotle against Schegk. In\nthis work he makes clear the difference between his position, which he\nmaintained had also been that of Aristotle, and the view of Schegk and\nother Aristotelians. The question at stake was what logic really was:\nits definition, its limitations, its goal and its nature. According to\nthe Aristotelians, the different parts of the\nOrganon\u2014the Categories, On\nInterpretation, the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics, the Topics and the Sophistical\nRefutations\u2014corresponded to the different parts of logic.\nThere was, for instance, an essential difference between probability\n(the subject of the Topics) and certainty (dealt with in the\ntwo Analytics).\n\nTo understand Ramus\u2019 line of reasoning we have to start with his\nfirm rejection of the basic Aristotelian conception of philosophy. The\nAristotelians defined philosophy as a habitus intellectualis,\na rational attitude toward being. In looking at being we can try to\nunderstand it; but we can also, as humans, use our knowledge to act\nrightly or wrongly toward other humans. For this reason, Aristotle\ndivided philosophy into a theoretical part and a practical part.\nLogic, however, does not fit into this division of philosophy because\nit does not give us any knowledge at all of being. It is instead a way\nof acquiring knowledge and of finding the truth. The Aristotelians\ntherefore called it a habitus instrumentalis, an instrumental\nattitude (the Greek term organon, traditionally used to\ndenote Aristotle\u2019s logical writings, means instrument or tool).\nAccording to the Aristotelians, philosophy always concerns the\nrational aspects of human beings; their productive aspects, by\ncontrast, belong to the practical disciplines or arts. For the\nAristotelian, it was essential to separate science and philosophy from\nthe arts. Yet while Aristotle had firmly rooted his philosophical\ntheories in an attitude toward being, educational practice in schools\nwas concerned solely with theorems and rules. Young pupils had to\nstudy not being in a theoretical and abstract way but rather the items\nthat the teacher demanded them to learn, often by heart.\n\nThe Stoic conception of philosophy, therefore, was often far more\nsuitable to a classroom situation. For the Stoics, the universe was\nrationally organized in a way that was directly equivalent to human\nreason. They believed that there was a correspondence in the universe,\nor in nature, between order and reason and that the reason which\norganized and governed the universe was essentially the same as human\nreason. The connection between nature and reason could be studied from\nthree different perspectives: physical, ethical and rational or\nlogical. One consequence of the Stoic theory was that there must be an\nabsolute analogy between the contents of an art and those of nature,\nthat is, all arts must also be about nature or being. There could not\nbe a difference of rank between the parts of nature, nor between the\nparts of philosophy, as the Aristotelians thought. Another consequence\nwas that logic became an integral part of philosophy rather than an\ninstrument to be used by the other branches of the discipline.\n\nRamus\u2019 way of looking at philosophy and logic was in many ways\nsimilar to that of the Stoics. His definition of philosophy as a\ncognitio artium liberalium, a knowledge of the liberal arts,\nreveals both the influence of Stoicism and of the medieval educational\ntradition. Ramus thus regarded logic as a part of philosophy and\ndefined it as an art that truly gives us knowledge of being.\nRamus\u2019 followers often substituted the word doctrina\nfor cognitio, which made it even clearer that the perspective\nwas more pedagogical than ontological (cf. Ramus, Dialectica,\np. 11, where he uses another variant, defining philosophy as a\ncomprehensio praeceptorum, a collection of precepts).\n\nIt may seem that Ramus\u2019 attitude toward Aristotle and the\nAristotelians was not very consistent. At times, he claimed to be the\nonly true Aristotelian and criticized the scholastic Aristotelians for\nmisinterpreting Aristotle. On other occasions, he maintained that the\nentire Aristotelian tradition, including Aristotle himself, was\ntotally wrong. This inconsistency is due to the fact that, true to his\nusual habit, he adopted different strategies in response to different\npolemical situations. Although Ramus was an offspring of the\nAristotelian tradition, he was also influenced by Ciceronian and Stoic\nideas. Only rarely did he directly attack Aristotle himself. So, for\nexample, whenever there was a clash between the Aristotelian and the\nStoic way of thinking, he tried to solve the problem by pointing out\ndifferences between Aristotle and his later commentators.\n",
