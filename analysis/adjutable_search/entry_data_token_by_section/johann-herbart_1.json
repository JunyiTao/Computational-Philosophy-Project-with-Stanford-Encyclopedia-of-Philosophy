    "main_text": "Logic and metaphysics\n2. Logic and metaphysics\nAside from Herbart\u2019s textbook presentation of traditional\nlogic (e.g., Section II of LEP), his main logical innovation is his\nso-called method of relations, devised as an organon for correct\nmetaphysical thinking (SW V: 201, f.). The metaphysical problems it\naims to address include: the thing as (one) substance with (many)\ncharacteristics; causality; matter; and the ego. He considers these\nproblematic because they give rise to an empirically given, yet\nself-contradictory concept (Weiss 1928: 37). Due to space constraints,\nwe will here only briefly touch on the problems of thing and ego, the\nformer for its role in the development of apperception, the latter\nbecause it is grounds his psychology. Both his idea of metaphysics and\nthe method of relations will become clearer as we see them used to\nexplain concrete psychological phenomena in Section\n3.\nThe problems of both thing and ego may be stated thus: there is a\nconflict between an alleged unity, on the one hand, with an\nempirically manifest plurality, on the other. We consider a thing to\nbe one substance, yet possessing a number of conflicting qualities;\nand we regard the self as a single entity conscious of many\nthoughts. But is the thing the one, or its many\nqualities? Is the self or psyche the one, or its thoughts? Herbart\nmaintains that this dilemma arises due to a missing link, one that can\nonly be supplied by \u201cspeculation\u201d. Speculative use of the\nmethod of relations would have us consider the conflicting elements not as\ndistinct entities in genuine opposition, but rather as members of a\nunifying relation. For example, the \u201cthing\u201d turns out to\nbe the nexus or system of (its) predicates, and nothing else\nbeyond them (cf. Beiser 2014: 118). Similarly, Herbart regards the\npsyche not as a substance, but simply as the condition of mental\nchange itself.\nHe follows Kant in distinguishing between conscious phenomena and\nunknowable noumena that must be conceived as underwriting the\ncoherence that experience finds in the fluctuating phenomenal\nmanifold.  The noumena are \u201cspeculative\u201d, by which Herbart\ndoes not mean objects of intellectual intuition, but rather the\ntranscendental conditions of the synthetic unity of objects of\nexperience. Yet where Kant held noumena to be unknowable, Herbart\ntakes the further step of ascribing to every existent \u201can act of\nself-preservation\u201d, a notion as opaque as it is important to his\npsychology (SW II: 195).  The idea seems to be that every being must\nhave an inherent force holding it together, or there would be no\nreason to suppose its continued existence: \u201cthe idea of a force\nto maintain one\u2019s identity\u201d just is\n\u201cself-preservation\u201d (Beiser 2014: 120).\nIn short, the method of relations is a way of doing metaphysics\nwith strong Platonic and Kantian overtones: the fluctuating and\nconflicting plurality of sensible experience is \u201crelated\u201d\nback to intelligible, \u201cspeculative\u201d unities that allow us\nto organize the plurality in experience. Thus, the method does more\nthan merely analyze contradiction; it also resolves them by\nsupplying the intelligible links. We will take these points up in more\ndetail as they arise in Herbart\u2019s psychology.\n",
