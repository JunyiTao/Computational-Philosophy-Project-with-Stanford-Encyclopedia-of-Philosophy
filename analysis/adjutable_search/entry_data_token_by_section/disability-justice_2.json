    "main_text": "Justice, Reconstruction, and Reasonable Accommodation\n3. Justice, Reconstruction, and Reasonable Accommodation\n\nAs suggested in\n \u00a71,\n the disabling impact of social arrangements may be relevant to the\ntype and scope of interventions that justice requires. In stressing\nthe impact and the malleability of the environment, social-model\ntheorists have shifted the focus from claims for correction and\ncompensation to claims for reconstruction.\n\nConsider a society with much greater height variation than our own.\nEven if very tall or short stature was neither stigmatized nor\nfunctionally limiting, that society would, on any plausible theory of\njustice, be obliged to construct its public spaces, buildings, and\nvehicles to accommodate them. They would be treated unjustly if the\nconstruction of the physical environment took no account of them,\nespecially if the failure to do so caused them significant\ndisadvantage. Of course, the extent to which their height differences\nneeded to be taken into account would depend on the distribution of\nheight in the society, as well as on its level of resources and\ncompeting needs. No plausible theory of justice would require that the\nbuilt environment be equally accommodating to all heights, if such a\nthing were possible, but all would condemn some environments as\nunjustly restrictive. What even this simple case suggests is that the\ndemand for a more inclusive environment need not be seen in terms of\ncompensating individuals, tall or impaired, for their internal\ndeficits, but of accommodating as wide as possible a range of human\nvariation.\n\nEven if environmental reconstruction should not be seen as\ncompensating for deficits, a question remains about the extent to\nwhich it should be seen as a matter of redistribution or recognition.\nThis question is raised by the legal requirement of \u201creasonable\naccommodation\u201d. Under the ADA and ADAAA,\n\u201caccommodations\u201d include ramps, elevators, texts in\nmultiple formats, sign-language interpreters, flexible work schedules,\nand job coaches or assistance. The failure to make reasonable\naccommodation for disabled employees or users of public facilities\nconstitutes, with some notable exceptions, discrimination (ADA 1990).\nThere is no reference to that concept in the laws banning\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or age; the term was\nintroduced in cases addressing claims of religious discrimination\n(see, e.g., Karlan and Rutherglen 1996). Like practitioners of\nminority religions, but unlike women, people of color, or older\npeople, people with disabilities must be \u201creasonably\naccommodated\u201d.\n\nFor the human variation model, reasonable accommodation requires\nchanges in the physical and social environment, from installing ramps\nto modifying work schedules and altering the location of meetings and\nclasses. Often, such changes require little more than flexibility and\nimagination. But some of these changes can be expensive; at some\npoint, the cost may make further change unreasonable. On this\napproach, the legislative understanding of such accommodation as a\nmatter of distributive justice is reflected in the qualifying use of\n\u201creasonable\u201d and the exemption of accommodations that\nwould impose an \u201cundue\u201d burden or hardship on the entity\nrequired to make accommodations (Wasserman 1998).\n But it is also possible to see reasonable accommodation as a\nrequirement of equality for people with disabilities without recourse\nto a theory of distributive justice (e.g., Crossley 2004; Karlan and\nRutherglen 1996). Accommodating religious practices may be expensive\nin various ways, but no one regards doing so either as compensating\nreligions for their deficits. Indeed, such a rationale would appear to\nviolate the state\u2019s constitutionally-mandated neutrality among\nreligions. Rather, because the state is required to treat religions\nand their adherents with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2003), it\ndisfavors rules and practices that interfere with religious\nobservance. Somewhat similarly, a state that regards people with\ndisabilities with equal respect and concern will disfavor arrangements\nthat interfere with their participation.  With respect to both groups,\nsubstantive equality may require unequal provisions. In the case of\ndisability as well as religion, how much additional provision is\nrequired is indeterminate, not for lack of a complete theory of\njustice to specify the amount or proportion, but because the demands\nof equal respect are indeterminate.\n\nConsider, for example, the question of how much it is reasonable for a\nsmall business to spend on an elevator or ground-floor space to be\nable to employ a talented IT technician with emphysema. To answer that\nquestion, we might do better to decide what respect for that person\ndemands, based in part on current social practice and convention,\nrather than to consult a comprehensive but abstract theory of\ndistributive justice. In any case, it may be unreasonable to expect a\ndeterminate answer; it may be appropriate to rely on a fair procedure\nto select among a range of plausible outcomes. But by the same token,\nthe utter lack of accommodation in many workplaces and public\nfacilities is clearly unjust on any plausible theory of justice.\n\nThe debate over the accommodations available for a minority group may\noften reflect a complex mix of claims concerning redistribution and\nrecognition. For example, people in wheelchairs are sometimes provided\nrestaurant access only through the service entrance. The restaurant\nowners often claim that such access is quite reasonable, since the\nservice entrances already have ramps\u2014a distributive\nconsideration. Disability advocates claim that however convenient it\nmay be for the owners, such access treats wheelchair users as\nsecond-class customers\u2014a claim of misrecognition. In this case,\nit may seem that the recognition claims clearly trump the conflicting\ndistributional claims. But this will not always be the case.\n\nAgain, resolving such conflicts may involve the same kind of judgment\nemployed in debates over accommodating minority religious practices.\nIt may be that some jobs cannot be made available to people whose\nSabbath falls on Friday or Saturday, because (in light of demographic\nconsiderations) the essential functions of those jobs require working\non those days. But although the \u201cessential function\u201d\nstandard appears objective and determinate, it is often subject to\ndistributive considerations, e.g., about staffing requirements and\nbusiness volume. A refusal to sustain the slightest loss of revenue to\naccommodate any minority religion might be a distributive injustice; a\nwillingness to sustain greater losses to accommodate Jewish and\nAdventist employees than Muslim ones might involve misrecognition as\nwell\u2014the failure to treat Islamic practice as having the same\nvalue as other religious practices. Similarly, the violation of the\nADA involved in refusing to display the same flexibility for disabled\nas for pregnant employees arguably constitutes both distributive\ninjustice and misrecognition.\n\nThe uncertainty about the distributive character of reasonable\naccommodation suggests that in the case of disability, it may often be\ndifficult to sharply distinguish claims for redistribution and\n recognition.[6]\n Recognition may require redistribution, and redistribution should aim\nat securing recognition. Asch (1989) has gone even further, arguing\nthat recognition must precede redistribution; that if people with\ndisabilities were recognized as equals, capable of significant\ncontributions to others, society would be more willing to adopt\nappropriate measures for redistribution and reconstruction.\n",
