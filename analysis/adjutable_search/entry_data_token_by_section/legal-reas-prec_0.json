    "main_text": "Precedent and analogy in legal reasoning\n1. Precedent and analogy in legal reasoning\n\n\nArguments from precedent and analogy are characteristic of legal\nreasoning. Legal reasoning differs in a number of ways from the sort\nof reasoning employed by individuals in their everyday lives. It\nfrequently uses arguments that individuals do not employ, or that individuals\nemploy in different ways. Precedent is a good example of this. In\nindividual reasoning we do not normally regard the fact that we\ndecided one way in the past as raising some presumption that we should\ndecide the same way in the future. Of course there can be special\ncircumstances that have this effect\u2014someone may have relied on\nwhat we did before, or may have had their expectations raised that we\nwould do so again\u2014but absent these special\nconsiderations we do not regard ourselves as being committed in the\nfuture to make the same decision. It is always open to us to\nreconsider a decision and change our minds if we no longer think our\noriginal judgement was correct.\n\n\nLaw of course is not alone in attributing a special significance to\nprecedent. Many institutional and quasi-institutional practices place\nweight on what they have done previously in determining what they\nshould do now. Individuals, by contrast, will often disregard what\nthey did on an earlier occasion. If they do make reference to the\npast, this will normally be due to their belief that what they did in\nthe past was the right thing to do, or at least is a good guide to\nwhat is the right thing to do now. Normally, then, individuals will\nmerely be using their past decisions in the belief that they are a\nreliable short-cut to working out what is the right thing to do.  If\nthey harbour doubts as to the correctness of the earlier decision then\nthey will reopen the matter and consider it afresh on the merits. In\ninstitutional settings, on the other hand, decision-makers will often\nrefer to what has been decided in the past as constraining what should\nbe done now, regardless of whether they think the original decision\nwas correct.\n\n\nEqually, institutional decision-makers often regard earlier decisions\nas being relevant even when the decision at hand is different from the\noriginal ones, by citing them as analogies. They will argue that since\nan earlier decision was made on some matter, it would be inconsistent\nnow to decide the present case differently.  Individuals, by contrast,\nwill often simply attend to the merits of the particular question\nbefore them and try to get the decision right. If it is pointed out\nthat their current decision seems to be inconsistent with how they\ntreated an earlier question, this may prompt them to reconsider, but\nis not in itself a reason to change their decision. At the end of the\nday they may conclude that their earlier decision was a mistake, or\nthey may even embrace the apparent inconsistency, believing that both\nthe earlier and the later decisions are correct even though they are\nnot sure how they can be reconciled.\n\n\nLegal reasoning, then, gives a weight to what has been decided in the\npast that is usually absent from personal decision-making. We care\nabout whether we made the right decisions in the past, but we seek to\nmake the right decisions now, unconstrained by our earlier views.\n",
