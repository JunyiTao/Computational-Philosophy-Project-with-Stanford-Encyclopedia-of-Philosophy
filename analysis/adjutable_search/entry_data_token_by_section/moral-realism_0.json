    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement\n1. Moral Disagreement\n\n\nPerhaps the longest standing argument is found in the extent and\ndepth of moral disagreement. The mere fact of disagreement does not\nraise a challenge for moral realism. Disagreement is to be found in\nvirtually any area, even where no one doubts that the claims at stake\npurport to report facts and everyone grants that some claims are\ntrue.\n\n\nBut disagreements differ and many believe that the sort of\ndisagreements one finds when it comes to morality are best explained by\nsupposing one of two things: (i) that moral claims are not actually in\nthe business of reporting facts, but are rather our way of expressing\nemotions, or of controlling others\u2019 behavior, or, at least, of\ntaking a stand for and against certain things or (ii) that moral claims\nare in the business of reporting facts, but the required facts just are\nnot to be found.\n\n\nTaking the first line, many note that people differ in their\nemotions, attitudes and interests and then argue that moral\ndisagreements simply reflect the fact that the moral claims people\nembrace are (despite appearances) really devices for expressing or\nserving their different emotions, attitudes, and interests.\n\n\nTaking the second line, others note that claims can genuinely\npurport to report facts and yet utterly fail (consider claims about\nphlogiston or astrological forces or some mythical figure that others\nbelieved existed) and then argue that moral disagreements take the form\nthey do because the facts that would be required to give them some\norder and direction are not to be found.\n\n\nOn either view, the distinctive nature of moral disagreement is seen\nas well explained by the supposition that moral realism is false,\neither because cognitivism is false or because an error theory is\ntrue.\n\n\nInterestingly, the two lines of argument are not really compatible.\nIf one thinks that moral claims do not even purport to report facts,\none cannot intelligibly hold that the facts such claims purport to\nreport do not exist. Nonetheless, in important ways, the considerations\neach mobilizes might be used to support the other. For instance,\nsomeone defending an error theory might point to the ways in which\nmoral claims are used to express or serve peoples\u2019 emotions,\nattitudes, and interests, to explain why people keep arguing as they do\ndespite there being no moral facts. And someone defending\nnoncognitivism might point to the practical utility of talking as if\nthere were moral facts to explain why moral claims seem to purport to\nreport facts even though they do not.\n\n\nMoreover, almost surely each of these views is getting at something\nthat is importantly right about some people and their use of what\nappear to be moral claims. No one doubts that often peoples\u2019\nmoral claims do express their emotions, attitudes, and do serve their\ninterests and it is reasonable to suspect that at least some people\nhave in mind as moral facts a kind of fact we have reason to think does\nnot exist.\n\n\nMoral realists are committed to holding, though, that to whatever\nextent moral claims might have other uses and might be made by people\nwith indefensible accounts of moral facts, some moral claims, properly\nunderstood, are actually true. To counter the arguments that appeal to\nthe nature of moral disagreement, moral realists need to show that the\ndisagreements are actually compatible with their commitments.\n\n\nAn attractive first step is to note, as was done above, that mere\ndisagreement is no indictment. Indeed, to see the differences among\npeople as disagreements\u2014rather than as mere differences\u2014it seems\nas if one needs to hold that they are making claims that contradict one\nanother and this seems to require that each side see the other as\nmaking a false claim. To the extent there is moral disagreement and not\nmerely difference, moral realists argue, we need at least to reject\nnoncognitivism (even as we acknowledge that the views people embrace\nmight be heavily influenced by their emotions, attitudes, and\ninterests). While this is plausible, noncognitivists can and have\nreplied by distinguishing cognitive disagreement from other sorts of\ndisagreement and arguing that moral disagreements are of a sort that does\nnot require cognitivism. Realists cannot simply dismiss this\npossibility, though they can legitimately challenge noncognitivists to\nmake good sense of how moral arguments and disagreements are carried on\nwithout surreptitiously appealing to the participants seeing their\nclaims as purporting to report facts.\n\n\nIn any case, even if the nature of disagreements lends some\nplausibility to cognitivism, moral realists need also to respond to the\nerror theorist's contention that the arguments and disagreements all\nrest on some false supposition to the effect that there are actually\nfacts of the sort there would have to be for some of the claims to be\ntrue. And, however moral realists respond, they need to avoid doing so\nin a way that then makes a mystery of the widespread moral disagreement\n(or at least difference) that all acknowledge.\n\n\nSome moral realists argue that the disagreements, widespread as they\nare, do not go very deep\u2014that to a significant degree moral\ndisagreements play out against the background of shared fundamental\nprinciples with the differences of opinion regularly being traceable to\ndisagreements about the nonmoral facts that matter in light of the\nmoral principles. On their view, the explanation of moral disagreements\nwill be of a piece with whatever turns out to be a good explanation of\nthe various nonmoral disagreements people find themselves in.\n\n\nOther moral realists, though, see the disagreements as sometimes\nfundamental. On their view, while moral disagreements might in some\ncases be traceable to disagreements about nonmoral matters of fact,\nthis will not always be true. Still, they deny the anti-realist's\ncontention that the disagreements that remain are well explained by\nnoncognitivism or by an error theory. Instead, they regularly offer\nsome other explanation of the disagreements. They point out, for\nexample, that many of the disagreements can be traced to the\ndistorting effects of the emotions, attitudes, and interests that are\ninevitably bound up with moral issues. Or they argue that what appear\nto be disagreements are really cases in which the people are talking\npast each other, each making claims that might well be true once the\nclaims are properly understood (Harman 1975, Wong 1984). And they\noften combine these explanatory strategies holding that the full range\nof moral disagreements are well explained by some balanced appeal to\nall of the considerations just mentioned, treating some disagreements\nas not fundamentally moral, others as a reflection of the distorting\neffects of emotion and interest, and still others as being due to\ninsufficiently subtle understandings of what people are actually\nclaiming. If some combination of these explanations works, then the\nmoral realist is on firm ground in holding that the existence of moral\ndisagreements, such as they are, is not an argument against moral\nrealism. Of course, if no such explanation works, then an appeal\neither to noncognitivism or an error theory (i.e. to some form of\nanti-realism) may be the best alternative.\n",
