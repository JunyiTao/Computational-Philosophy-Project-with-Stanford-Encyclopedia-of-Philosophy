    "main_text": "Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory\n3. Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory\n\nDirac\u2019s formal framework for quantum mechanics was very useful\nand influential despite its lack of mathematical rigor. It was used\nextensively by physicists and it inspired some powerful mathematical\ndevelopments in functional analysis. Eventually, mathematicians\ndeveloped a suitable framework for placing Dirac\u2019s formal\nframework on a firm mathematical foundation, which is known as a\nrigged Hilbert space (and is also referred to as a\nGelfand Triplet). This came about as follows. A rigorous\ndefinition of the \\(\\delta\\) function became possible in distribution\ntheory, which was developed by Schwartz from the mid-1940s to the\nearly 1950s. Distribution theory inspired Gelfand and collaborators\nduring the mid-to-late 1950s to formulate the notion of a rigged\nHilbert space, the firm foundation for Dirac\u2019s formal framework.\nThis development was facilitated by Grothendiek\u2019s notion of a\nnuclear space, which he introduced in the mid-1950s. The rigged\nHilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics was then developed\nindependently by B\u00f6hm and by Roberts in 1966. Since then, it has\nbeen extended to a variety of different contexts in the quantum domain\nincluding decay phenomena and the arrow of time. The mathematical\ndevelopments of Schwartz, Gelfand, and others had a substantial effect\non QFT as well. Distribution theory was taken forward by Wightman in\ndeveloping the axiomatic approach to QFT from the mid-1950s to the\nmid-1960s. In the late 1960s,\u00a0 the axiomatic approach was\nexplicitly put into the rigged Hilbert space framework by Bogoliubov\nand co-workers.\n\nAlthough these developments were only indirectly influenced by Dirac,\nby way of the mathematical developments that are associated with his\nformal approach to quantum mechanics, there are other elements of his\nwork that had a more direct and very substantial impact on the\ndevelopment of QFT. In the 1930s, Dirac (1933) developed a Lagrangian\nformulation of quantum mechanics and applied it to quantum fields ,\nand the latter inspired Feynman (1948) to develop the path-integral\napproach to QFT. The mathematical foundation for path-integral\nfunctionals is still lacking (Rivers 1987, pp, 109\u2013134), though\nsubstantial progress has been made (DeWitt-Morette et al.\n1979). Despite such shortcomings, it remains the most useful and\ninfluential approach to QFT to date. In the 1940s, Dirac (1943)\ndeveloped a form of quantum electrodynamics that involved an\nindefinite metric \u2013 see also Pauli (1943) in that connection.\nThis had a substantial influence on later developments, first in\nquantum electrodynamics in the early 1950s with the Gupta-Bluer\nformalism, and in a variety of QFT models such as vector meson fields\nand quantum gravity fields by the late 1950s \u2013 see Chapter 2 of\nNagy (1966) for examples and references.\n",
