    "main_text": "Structuralism and Nominalism || Ante Rem Structuralism\n4.2 Ante Rem Structuralism\n\nShapiro draws a useful distinction between algebraic and\nnon-algebraic mathematical theories (Shapiro 1997). Roughly,\nnon-algebraic theories are theories which appear at first sight to be\nabout a unique model: the intended model of the theory. We\nhave seen examples of such theories: arithmetic, mathematical\nanalysis\u2026 Algebraic theories, in contrast, do not carry a prima\nfacie claim to be about a unique model. Examples are group theory,\ntopology, graph theory\u2026\n\nBenacerraf\u2019s challenge can be mounted for the objects that\nnon-algebraic theories appear to describe. But his challenge does not\napply to algebraic theories. Algebraic theories are not interested in\nmathematical objects per se; they are interested in structural aspects\nof mathematical objects. This led Benacerraf to speculate whether the\nsame could not be true also of non-algebraic theories. Perhaps the\nlesson to be drawn from Benacerraf\u2019s identification problem is\nthat even arithmetic does not describe specific mathematical objects,\nbut instead only describes structural relations?\n\nShapiro and Resnik hold that all mathematical theories, even\nnon-algebraic ones, describe structures. This position is\nknown as structuralism (Shapiro 1997; Resnik 1997). Structures\nconsists of places that stand in structural relations to each other.\nThus, derivatively, mathematical theories describe places or positions\nin structures. But they do not describe objects. The number three, for\ninstance, will on this view not be an object but a place in the\nstructure of the natural numbers.\n\nSystems are instantiations of structures. The systems that\ninstantiate the structure that is described by a non-algebraic theory\nare isomorphic with each other, and thus, for the purposes of the\ntheory, equally good. The systems I and II that were described in\n section 4.1\n can be seen as instantiations of the natural number structure.\n\\(\\{\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\{\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\}\\) are equally suitable for\nplaying the role of the number three. But neither are the\nnumber three. For the number three is an open place in the natural\nnumber structure, and this open place does not have any internal\nstructure. Systems typically contain structural properties over and\nabove those that are relevant for the structures that they are taken\nto instantiate.\n\nSensible identity questions are those that can be asked from within a\nstructure. They are those questions that can be answered on the basis\nof structural aspects of the structure. Identity questions that go\nbeyond a structure do not make sense. One can pose the question\nwhether \\(3 \\in 4\\), but not cogently: this question involves a\ncategory mistake. The question mixes two different structures: \\(\\in\\)\nis a set-theoretical notion, whereas 3 and 4 are places in the\nstructure of the natural numbers. This seems to constitute a\nsatisfactory answer to Benacerraf\u2019s challenge.\n\nIn Shapiro\u2019s view, structures are not ontologically dependent on\nthe existence of systems that instantiate them. Even if there were no\ninfinite systems to be found in Nature, the structure of the natural\nnumbers would exist. Thus structures as Shapiro understands them are\nabstract, platonic entities. Shapiro\u2019s brand of structuralism is\noften labeled ante rem structuralism.\n\nIn textbooks on set theory we also find a notion of structure.\nRoughly, the set theoretic definition says that a structure is an\nordered \\(n+1\\)-tuple consisting of a set, a number of relations on\nthis set, and a number of distinguished elements of this set. But this\ncannot be the notion of structure that structuralism in the philosophy\nof mathematics has in mind. For the set theoretic notion of structure\npresupposes the concept of set, which, according to structuralism,\nshould itself be explained in structural terms. Or, to put the point\ndifferently, a set-theoretical structure is merely a system\nthat instantiates a structure that is ontologically prior to it.\n\nNonetheless, the motivation for extending ante rem structuralism even\nto the most encompassing mathematical discipline (set theory) is not\nentirely evident (Burgess 2015). Recall that the main motivation for\narriving at a structuralist understanding of a mathematical discipline\nlies in Benacerraf\u2019s identification problem. For set theory, it\nseems hard to mount an identification challenge: sets are not usually\ndefined in terms of more primitive concepts.\n\nIt appears that ante rem structuralism describes the notion\nof a structure in a somewhat circular manner. A structure is described\nas places that stand in relation to each other, but a place cannot be\ndescribed independently of the structure to which it belongs. Yet this\nis not necessarily a problem. For the ante rem structuralist,\nthe notion of structure is a primitive concept, which cannot be\ndefined in other more basic terms. At best, we can construct an\naxiomatic theory of mathematical structures.\n\nBut Benacerraf\u2019s epistemological problem still appears to be\nurgent. Structures and places in structures may not be objects, but\nthey are abstract. So it is natural to wonder how we succeed in\nobtaining knowledge of them. This problem has been taken by certain\nphilosophers as a reason for developing a nominalist theory of\nmathematics and then to reconcile this theory with basic tenets of\nstructuralism.\n",
