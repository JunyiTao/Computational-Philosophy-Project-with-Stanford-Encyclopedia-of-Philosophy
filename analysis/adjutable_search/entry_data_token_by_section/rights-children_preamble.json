    "main_text": "\n \u2018In present-day political and moral philosophy the idea that\nall persons are in some way moral equals has become dogma\u2019\n(Steinhoff ed. 2015, xi). Yet in the collection of essays from whose\nIntroduction this quotation comes and that seeks to explain and\njustify this foundational \u2018dogma\u2019, \u2018children\u2019\ndoes not figure in its index and are barely discussed if at\nall. Whilst children are thought of as human beings and thus having a\nmoral status such that it would be wrong to treat them in certain\nways, it is also thought reasonable that there are things children may\nnot do that adults may. In short, children are humans but not persons\nmorally equal to adults. This is nowhere clearer than when considering\nwhat in law children are permitted or entitled to do as well as\nprevented from doing. In most jurisdictions, for instance, children\nare not allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to\nengage in paid employment. Then there are things that should not be\ndone to children because they are children, such as conscription into\nmilitary service. Why should that be the case?\n\nOne very obvious way in which this issue of what distinguishes\nchildren from adults can be addressed is by asking the following\nquestions, Do children have rights? If so, do they have all the rights\nthat adults have and do they have rights that adults do not have? If\nthey do not have rights how do we ensure that they are treated in the\nmorally right way? Most jurisdictions accord children legal rights.\nMost countries\u2014though not the United States of\nAmerica\u2014have ratified the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child which was first adopted in 1989. The Convention\naccords to children a wide range of rights including, most centrally,\nthe \u2018inherent right to life\u2019 (Article 6), and the right of\na child \u201cwho is capable of forming his or her own views \u2026\nto express these views freely in all matters affecting the\nchild\u201d (Article 12) (United Nations 1989).\n\nHowever, it is normal to distinguish between \u2018positive\u2019\nrights, those that are recognised in law, and \u2018moral\u2019\nrights, those that are recognised by some moral theory. That children\nhave \u2018positive\u2019 rights does not then settle the question\nof whether they do or should have moral rights. Nevertheless, there\nare at least good political reasons why one might think that the UNCRC\nprovides an exemplary statement\u2014in the language of positive\nrights\u2014of how children should be treated and regarded. The idea\nof children as rights holders has been subject to different kinds of\nphilosophical criticism. There has also been philosophical\nconsideration of what kinds of rights children have if they do have\nany rights at all. The various debates shed invaluable light on both\nthe nature and value of rights, and on the moral status of\nchildren.\n\nThe question of how the putative rights of children stand in relation\nto the rights of those adults who, arguably, have rights over children\nbroaches the issues of parental rights and responsibilities which is\nnot discussed here.
