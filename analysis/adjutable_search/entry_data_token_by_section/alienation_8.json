    "main_text": "Subjective and Objective Alienation || Applications\n3.3 Applications\n\nThese various alternative combinations\u2014numbered (i) to (iv)\nabove\u2014correspond, very roughly, to the ways in which particular\nauthors have characterised particular kinds of social arrangement or\ntypes of society. Consider, for example, the different views of modern\nclass-divided society taken by Hegel and Marx.\n\nMarx can be characterised as diagnosing contemporary capitalist\nsociety as corresponding to situation (i); that is, as being a social\nworld which contains both objective and subjective alienation. On what\nwe might call his standard view, Marx allows that objective and\nsubjective alienation are conceptually distinct, but assumes that in\ncapitalist societies they are typically found together sociologically\n(perhaps with the subjective forms tending to track the objective\nones). However, there are passages where he deviates from that\nstandard view, and\u2014without abandoning the thought that objective\nalienation is, in some sense, more fundamental\u2014appears to allow\nthat, on occasion, subjective and objective alienation can also come\napart sociologically. At least, that is one way of reading a\nwell-known passage in The Holy Family which suggests that\ncapitalists might be objectively but not subjectively alienated. In\nthese remarks, Marx recognises that capitalists do not get to engage\nin self-realising activities of the right kind (hence their objective\nalienation), but observes that\u2014unlike the proletariat\u2014the\ncapitalists are content in their estrangement; not least,\nthey feel \u2018at ease\u2019 in it, and they feel\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 by it (Marx and Engels 1975: 36).\n\nIn contrast, Hegel maintains that the modern social world approximates\nto something more like situation (iii); that is, as being a social\nworld not containing objective alienation, but still containing\nsubjective alienation. That is, for Hegel, the social and political\nstructures of the modern social world do constitute a home, because\nthey enable individuals to realise themselves, variously as family\nmembers, economic agents, and citizens. However, those same\nindividuals fail to understand or appreciate that this is the case,\nand rather feel estranged from, and perhaps even consciously reject,\nthe institutions of the modern social world. The resulting situation\nhas been characterised as one of \u2018pure subjective\nalienation\u2019 (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThat Hegel and Marx diagnose modern society in these different ways\nhelps to explain their differing strategic political commitments. They\nboth aim to bring society closer to situation (iv)\u2014that is, a\nsocial world lacking systematic forms of both objective and subjective\nalienation\u2014but, since they disagree about where we are starting\nfrom, they propose different routes to that shared goal. For Marx,\nsince we start from situation (i), this requires that the existing\nworld be overturned; that is, that both institutions and attitudes\nneed to be revolutionised (overcoming objective and subjective\nalienation). For Hegel, since we start from situation (iii), this\nrequires only attitudinal change: we come to recognise that the\nexisting world is already objectively \u2018a home\u2019, and in\nthis way \u2018reconcile\u2019 ourselves to that world, overcoming\npure subjective alienation in the process.\n\nSituation (ii) consists of a social world containing objective, but\nnot subjective, alienation \u2013 a situation that can be characterised as\none of \u2018pure objective alienation\u2019 (Hardimon\n1994: 120). It is perhaps not too much of a stretch to think of\nthis situation as corresponding, very roughly, to one of the Frankfurt\nSchool\u2019s more nightmarish visions of contemporary capitalist\nsociety. (The Frankfurt School is the colloquial label given to\nseveral generations of philosophers and social theorists, in the\nWestern Marxist tradition, associated\u2014more or less\nclosely\u2014with the Institute for Social Research founded in\n1929\u20131930.) For example, in the pessimistic diagnosis of Herbert\nMarcuse (1898\u20131979), articulated in One-Dimensional Man\n(1964), individuals in advanced capitalist societies appear happy in\ntheir dysfunctional relationships\u2014they \u2018identify\nthemselves\u2019 with their estranged circumstances and gain\n\u2018satisfaction\u2019 from them (2002: 13). Objective alienation\nstill obtains, but no longer generates social conflict, since the\nlatter is assumed\u2014not implausibly\u2014to require agents who\nfeel, or experience, some form of hostility or rebelliousness towards\nexisting social arrangements.\n\nThat latter assumption raises the wider issue of the relation between\nalienation and, what might be called \u2018revolutionary\nmotivation\u2019. Let us assume that radical social change requires,\namongst other conditions, an agent\u2014typically a collective\nagent\u2014with both the strength and the desire to bring that change\nabout. The role of alienation in helping to form that latter\npsychological prerequisite\u2014the desire to bring about change on\nthe part of the putative revolutionary agent\u2014looks complicated.\nFirst, it would seem that the mere fact of objective alienation cannot play\nthe motivating role, since it does not involve or require any feeling,\nor thinking about, or otherwise experiencing, the problematic\nseparation here. It remains possible, of course, that a subject\u2019s knowledge of that alienation\nmight\u2014depending, not least, on one\u2019s views on the\nconnections between reasons and motivations\u2014provide an\nappropriately psychological incentive to revolt. Second, the relation\nbetween subjective alienation and motivation looks more complex than\nit might initially seem. Note, in particular, that some of the\nexperiential dimensions of subjective alienation look less likely than\nothers to generate the psychological prerequisites of action here.\nFeelings of powerlessness and isolation, for instance, might well\ngenerate social withdrawal and individual atomism, rather than radical\nsocial engagement and cooperative endeavour, on the part of the\nrelevant agents. In short, whether subjective alienation is a friend\nor an enemy of revolutionary motivation would seem to depend on the\nprecise form that it takes.\n\nInterestingly, situation (ii)\u2014that is, the case of \u2018pure\nobjective alienation\u2019\u2014might also be thought to approximate\nto the social goal of certain thinkers in the tradition of\nexistentialism (the tradition of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980),\nAlbert Camus (1913\u20131960), and others). Some interpretative\ngenerosity may be needed here, but existentialists appear to think of (something like) objective alienation as a permanent feature of all human societies. Rejecting both substantive accounts of essential human nature, and the ethical embrace of social relations\nthat facilitate the development and deployment of those human\ncharacteristics, they rather maintain that the social world will\nalways remain \u2018other\u2019, can never be a \u2018home\u2019.\nHowever, although this \u2018otherness\u2019 can never be overcome,\nthere do look to be better and worse ways of dealing with it. What is\nessential to each individual is what they make of themselves, the ways\nin which they choose to engage with that other. The preferred outcome\nhere seems to involve individuals embodying a norm of\n\u2018authenticity\u2019, which amongst other conditions\u2014such\nas choosing, or committing, to their own projects\u2014may require\nthat they have the \u2018courage\u2019 to \u2018grasp, accept, and,\nperhaps even affirm\u2019 the fact that the social world is not a\nhome for them (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThis also clarifies that situation (iv)\u2014which contains\nsystematic forms of neither objective or subjective\nalienation\u2014is the social goal of some but not all of these\nauthors (of Hegel and Marx, for instance, but not the\nexistentialists). Of course, (iv) might also be a characterisation of\nthe extant social world according to a hypothetical, and\nover-optimistic, apologist for the present.\n",
