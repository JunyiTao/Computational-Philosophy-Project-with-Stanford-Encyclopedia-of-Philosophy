    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria\n4. Alternative demarcation criteria\n\nPhilosophical discussions on the demarcation of pseudoscience have\nusually focused on the normative issue, i.e. the missing scientific\nquality of pseudoscience (rather than on its attempt to mimic\nscience. One option is to base the demarcation on the fundamental\nfunction that science shares with other fact-finding processes, namely\nto provide us with the most reliable information about its\nsubject-matter that is currently available. This could lead to the\nspecification of critierion (1) from Section 3.2 as follows: \n\n(1\u2032)\nit is at variance with the most reliable knowledge about its\nsubject matter that is currently available. \n\n\nThis definition has the advantages of (i) being applicable across\ndisciplines with highly different methodologies and (ii) allowing for\na statement to be pseudoscientific at present although it was not so\nin an earlier period (or, although less commonly, the other way\naround). (Hansson 2013) At the same time it removes the practical\ndetermination whether a statement or doctrine is pseudoscientific from\nthe purview of armchair philosophy to that of scientists specialized\nin the subject-matter that the statement or doctrine relates\nto. Philosophers have usually opted for demarcation criteria that appear not to require specialized knowledge in the pertinent\nsubject area.\n\n",
