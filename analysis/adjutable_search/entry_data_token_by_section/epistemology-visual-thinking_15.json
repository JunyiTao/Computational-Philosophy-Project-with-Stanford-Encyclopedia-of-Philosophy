    "main_text": "Further uses of visual representations\n8. Conclusion\nThinking which involves the use of seen or visualized images, which\nmay be static or moving, is widespread in mathematical practice. Such\nvisual thinking may constitute a non-superfluous and non-replaceable\npart of thinking through a specific proof. But there is a real danger\nof over-generalisation when using images, which we need to guard\nagainst, and in some contexts, such as real and complex analysis, the\napparent soundness of a diagrammatic inference is liable to be\nillusory.\nEven when visual thinking does not contribute to proving a\nmathematical truth, it may enable one to discover a truth,\nwhere to discover a truth is to come to believe it in an independent,\nreliable and rational way. Visual thinking can also play a large role\nin discovering a central idea for a proof or a proof-strategy; and in\ndiscovering a kind of mathematical entity or a mathematical\nproperty.\nThe (non-superfluous) use of visual thinking in coming to know a\nmathematical truth does in some cases introduce an a\nposteriori element into the way one comes to know it, resulting\nin a posteriori mathematical knowledge. This is not as\nrevolutionary as it may sound as a truth knowable a\nposteriori may also be knowable a priori. More\ninteresting is the possibility that one can acquire some mathematical\nknowledge in a way in which visual thinking is essential but does not\ncontribute evidence; in this case the role of the visual thinking may\nbe to activate one\u2019s prior cognitive resources. This opens the\npossibility that non-superfluous visual thinking may result in a\npriori knowledge of a mathematical truth.\nVisual thinking may contribute to understanding in more than one\nway. Visual illustrations may be extremely useful in providing\nexamples and non-examples of analytic concepts, thus helping to\nsharpen our grasp of those concepts. Also, visual thinking\naccompanying a proof may deepen our understanding of the proof, giving\nus an awareness of the direction of the proof so that, as Hermann Weyl\nput it, we are not forced to traverse the steps blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch.\n",
