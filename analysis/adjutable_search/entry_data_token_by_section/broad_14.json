Broad dealt with problems\nregarding induction\u2014\u201cthe glory of science and the scandal\nof\n philosophy\u201d[16]\n \u2014in a number of papers. A sample of his work on the subject is\nthe two early papers entitled \u201cThe Relation Induction and\nProbability\u201d (1918, 1920). Broad\u2019s focus is on the nature\nand justification of inductive inferences. He argues that unless the\nconclusions of such inferences are cast in terms of probability they\nall involve a formal fallacy. However in order to arrive at justified\ninductive conclusions we cannot simply place our confidence in any of\nthe known principles of probability theory (such as those we employ in\nreasoning with regard to artificial situations with bags containing\nred and white balls, and the like): we need some further premise.\nUnfortunately, this premise is \u201cextremely difficult to state\n[\u2026] so that it shall be at once plausible and\nnon-tautologous\u201d (1918, p. 389). Broad attempts to articulate\nthe supreme principle needed. He argues at length that the principle\nneeded says not simply (and crudely): \u201cthere is uniformity in\nnature.\u201d It also says that the particular things or substances\nin the world subject to uniformity belong to a variety of natural\nkinds. Indeed, on closer reflection it is clear that \u201c[t]he\nnotions of permanent substances, genuine natural kinds, and universal\ncausation are parts of a highly complex and closely interwoven whole\nand any of them breaks down hopelessly without the rest\u201d (1920,\np. 44). Notable also is the logic of conditions that Broad\u2019s\nformulates in \u201cThe Principles of Demonstrative Induction\u201d\n(1930b). He may quite well be the first who gave systematic attention\nto this\n topic.[17]\n\nCausation. Causation is dealt with in several of\nBroad\u2019s works (beginning as early as his first book,\nPerception, Physics and Reality, 1914). The logic of\nconditions formulated in (1930b) would square well with some version\nof the regularity theory of causation. However, in several works\nrather penetrating criticism of that theory is offered (e.g., in Ch.\n3, 1925). In (1933) he tries to formulate an alternative. Causality\ninvolves something between regularity and logical entailment; there is\nsome form of necessity, but not the kind involved in logical\nentailment. The latter is an absolute necessity. Consider the\nproposition \u2019Anything that has shape would have\nextension\u2019. This is not only true in the actual world: it is\ntrue in all logically possible worlds; there could not have been a\nworld in which there were things that had shape but lacked extension.\nNow compare the proposition \u2019Anything that had inertial mass\nwould have gravitational mass\u2019. There could not be things in the\nactual world which had inertial mass but lacked gravitational\nmass. But there could have been a world in which there were things\nthat had inertial mass but lacked gravitational mass. The kind of\nnecessity involved here is a contingent necessity. (Cf. 1933, pp.\n242\u20133.) Broad is, however, rather skeptical of the alternative\nhe has sought to formulate. He says with characteristic candor that\nthe notion of a necessity which is contingent might very well be\n\u201csheer nonsense\u201d.\n\nThe Unconscious. Broad examines issues surrounding \u201cthe\nunconscious\u201d at some length in The Mind and Its Place in\nNature. His objective is to capture a (literal) sense in which an\nexperiential mental state may be said to be unconscious. Although he\nrejects the view that the notion of unconscious experience is\nincoherent he argues that there is no compelling reason to assume that\nsuch actually exist. The assumption that there is a pure neural state\nwith causal properties that are similar to those of a certain mental\nstate is sufficient to explain the facts.\n\nTime Consciousness. Broad gave two different accounts of\ntemporal\n experience.[18]\n Consider an experience of a succession of notes:\nDo\u2013Re\u2013Mi. The earlier account\nclaims that what one is aware of is temporally extended; it\nincludes the present note as well as the immediate past ones:\n\u201cwhat is sensed at any moment stretches a little way back behind\nthat moment\u201d (1923, p. 348). What you are aware of when\nMi is present extends to, and so includes the past notes\nRe and Do. On the later account we are strictly\nspeaking aware only of the present note, Mi. But this\nawareness is coupled with a representation of the past notes under a\ndistinctive mode of temporal presentation. Broad introduces the notion\nof presentedness. When you are aware of the present note\nMi it is apprehended as possessing the maximum degree of\npresentedness, while the note Re is represented as possessing\na less degree of presentedness, and Do a still lesser\ndegree.\n\nThe Philosophy of Parapsychology. Parapsychology is the study\nof apparently paranormal events. Broad seeks to capture the nature and\nimportance of the subject. A paranormal event is an event that seems\nprima facie to conflict with what he terms a basic\nlimiting principle, i.e. a principle that \u201cwe\nunhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which all our\npractical activities and our scientific theories are confined\u201d\n(1953, p. 7). There are a number of such principles. One says that an\nevent cannot begin to have any effect before it has occurred; another\nthat knowledge of the future is impossible except in certain familiar\nmanners, such as by inference from present facts. The basic limiting\nprinciples seem to \u201ccover very satisfactorily an enormous range\nof well-established facts of the most varied kinds\u201d. We are\ntherefore \u201cnaturally inclined to think that they must be\nall-embracing\u201d (p. 8). And for that reason these principles are\nof immense importance to our overall view of the universe and our\nplace in it. But just in proportion to this importance is \u201cthe\nphilosophic importance of any well-established exception to\nthem\u201d (p. 9).\n\nThe Philosophy of Religion. Broad\u2019s writings on this\nsubject have the virtues characteristic of everything he\nwrote\u2014thoroughness, lucidity and fairness. Broad rejects the\ntraditional arguments for the existence of God. His essay\n\u201cArguments for The Existence of God\u201d (1939) features a\nsearching critique of the cosmological argument and the ontological\nargument (regarding the argument from design, Broad states that he has\nnothing to add to the critique of Hume and Kant). He argues inter\nalia that the conclusion of the cosmological argument has a\nconsequence that few would stomach, viz. that there are no really\ncontingent facts, although many facts \u201cseem contingent relative\nto our ignorance\u201d. As to the ontological argument Broad claims\nthat the notion of the greatest possible being is \u201cmeaningless\nverbiage\u201d unless the properties that are essential to the notion\nof God admit of an intrinsic maximum. He argues that that\ncondition is not satisfied. Therefore, the argument is \u201cwrecked\nbefore ever it leaves port.\u201d In the latter part of his essay\nBroad turns to the argument from religious experience (in what might\nquite well be the first systematic treatment of the argument). The\nposition he takes is, in a nutshell, this. If a person has an\nexperience that she takes to be an experience of an X, it is\nreasonable to conclude that she did experience an X unless\nthere is some positive reason to think otherwise. To refuse to apply\nthis principle to religious experiences is not reasonable. The\nquestion then is whether there is some positive reason to think that\nreligious experiences are delusive. But on reflection it turns out\nthere is no such reason. We may therefore conclude that religious\nexperiences are probably veridical.\n\nEthics. In writings up to, and including Five Types of\nEthical Theory Broad assumes that ethical sentences express\njudgements. He favours an intuitionist or non-naturalist analysis. In\nlater works, however, he is undecided: it could be that ethical\nsentences express judgements; but, alternatively, they may express\nemotions or commands. Notwithstanding this, Broad fruitfully (and\nindefatigably!) classifies alternative types of ethical theories,\nuncovers their underlying assumptions, and draws out their logical\nconsequences. As to normative ethics, Broad does not think the\nutilitarian view that there is one and only one criterion of right\naction can be sustained. Neither did he accept hedonism. There are, he\nargues, other bearers of intrinsic value and disvalue than pleasure\nand pain.\n\nBroad made many specific contributions to the subject of moral\nphilosophy that could be mentioned. Here are three of these. (i) There\nis a fine discussion of psychological egoism (a discussion where he,\nas he quite correctly says, gives the psychological egoist \u201cthe\nlongest possible run for his\n money\u201d).[19]\n After Butler there is hardly need of further nails in the coffin of\nthat theory. But because of its shrewd and perceptive treatment of\nhuman motivation Broad\u2019s essay is nonetheless of remaining\ninterest. (ii) In Five Types Broad tentatively suggests a\nversion of what is currently known as the The Fitting Attitude\nAnalysis of value. He writes with characteristic cautiousness:\n\u201cI am not sure that \u2018X is good\u2019 could not\nbe defined as meaning that X is such that it would be a\nfitting object of desire to any mind which had an adequate idea of its\nnon-ethical characteristics\u201d (p.\n 283).[20]\n (iii) In an early paper (1916), Broad seems to anticipate ideas\ngaining currency much later among moral and political philosophers. He\nsuggests that the goodness of a complex state of affairs is not merely\na function of the value of its parts. Its goodness is restrained by a\ncondition which says, roughly, that the best possible state of affairs\nis one where the producers of some good are as nearly as possible\nidentical with the enjoyers of that good. The principle says that the\ncontributors to a cooperative scheme is bound by a duty of\nfairness. The principle Broad alludes to could be seen as an\nearly version of the Principle of Fairness (later to be found in the\nwork of H. L. A. Hart and John\n Rawls).[21]\n\nThe History of Philosophy. Broad wrote on a variety of\nscattered figures in the history of philosophy, e.g. Bacon, Butler,\nBerkeley, Newton, Leibniz and Kant. A notable work is Five Types\nof Ethical Theory that (alongside careful discussions of such\nphilosophers as Spinoza and Hume) includes a pioneering study of Henry\nSidgwick\u2019s The Methods of Ethics (1874), written at a\ntime when Sidgwick\u2019s work had passed into nearly complete\noblivion. Noteworthy here also are the two posthumously published book\nlength studies on Leibniz and Kant, respectively. Both of these\ncontain shrewd philosophical comment that are of general philosophical\ninterest.\n",
