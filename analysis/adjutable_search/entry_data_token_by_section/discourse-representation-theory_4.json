    "main_text": "The DRS language: syntax, semantics, accessibility || Syntax\n4.1 Syntax\nDRSs are set-theoretic objects built from discourse\nreferents and DRS-conditions.  A\nDRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a\npredicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in\nwhich case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS\nlanguage is by simultaneous recursion:\n\nDRSs and DRS-conditions\n\n A DRS K is a pair\n<UK,\n ConK>,\n where\n UK\n is a set of discourse referents,\nand ConK is a\nset of DRS-conditions. \n If P is an n-place predicate, and\nx1, \u2026,\nxn\nare discourse referents, then\nP(x1, \u2026, xn)\n is a DRS-condition. \n If x and\ny\n are discourse referents, then\nx=y is a\nDRS-condition. \n If K and\nK\u2032 are DRSs, then\n\u00acK, \nK\u21d2K\u2032, and\nK\u2228K\u2032 are\nDRS-conditions. \n If K and\nK\u2032 are DRSs and\nx \n is a discourse referent, then\nK(\u2200x)K\u2032\nis a DRS-condition. \n\n\nNote that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined\nsentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs\nassociated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs\nK and\nK\u2032\nis defined as their pointwise union:\n\nDRS-merge\n\n K\u2295K\u2032 = \u00a0\n <UK \u222a\n UK\u2032,\n ConK \u222a\n  ConK\u2032>\n\n\nThe merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with\nthe DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that\nthere is no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and\nsentence concatenation (see Muskens 1996 for discussion).\nOfficially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article\nwe use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp\u2019s own work,\nemploy a graphical \u201cbox notation\u201d which is sometimes\nclearer, but less parsimonious and more difficult to type. To\nillustrate the various schemes, here are three ways of representing\nthe content of a conditional donkey sentence:\n\n\n\nOfficial DRS:\n\n<{}, <{x, y}, {farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)}> \u21d2 <{}, {beats(x,y)}>} >\n\n\nLinear notation:\n\n[: [x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y),  owns(x,y)] \u21d2 [: beats(x,y)]]\n\n\nBox notation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx y\n\n\nfarmer(x)\ndonkey(y)\nowns(x,y)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u21d2\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeats(x,y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice between these formats is one of convenience, and does\nnot have any theoretical significance.\n",
