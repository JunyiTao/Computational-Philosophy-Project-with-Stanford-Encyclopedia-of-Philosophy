    "main_text": "Responsibility || Responsibility of Oppressors for Oppression\n3.1 Responsibility of Oppressors for Oppression\n\nResponsibility for a group\u2019s oppression seems to be distinct\nfrom responsibility for other immoral acts that individuals perform.\nOne reason is that oppression is a difficult concept for many to\ngrasp, partly because it can take subtle forms, partly because it is\nin many ways \u201cnormalized\u201d such that participants and even\nvictims become oblivious to it, and partly because it is\ninstitutionalized and part of the very structure of society, which\nmeans that often it is carried out independently of anyone\u2019s\nharboring any bad attitudes toward persons in subordinate groups (see\nMaybee 2002, for a clear discussion of this phenomenon). Another\nreason responsibility for oppression is distinctive is that persons\nmay contribute to a group\u2019s oppression simply by participating\nin a system of oppression, but not directly harboring sexist (or\nracist, etc.) intentions or even acting in ways that directly harm\nothers, which are two factors that we ordinarily use to implicate\nindividuals for immoral actions. On the one hand, holding all men\nresponsible for women\u2019s oppression in virtue of men\u2019s\n(perhaps unwilling) participation in the system seems to be too strong\na view, but on the other hand, freeing from responsibility all men on\nthe grounds that they do not harbor ill intentions or cause direct\nharm to women seems to be too weak, since it seems that someone is\nresponsible for maintaining any system of oppression. Charles\nLawrence, a race theorist, notes that \u201cThe racist acts of\nmillions of individuals are mutually reinforcing and cumulative\nbecause the status quo of institutionalized white supremacy remains\nlong after deliberate racist actions subside\u201d (Lawrence 1993,\n61). But even though institutionalization of racism and sexism may\nseem to free from responsibility individuals who participate in these\nsystems because the systems continue without deliberate racist or\nsexist acts, it is arguably the case that certain individuals directly\nhelp to ensure that the system is maintained through their actions,\nand it is unclear that negligence, ignorance, or self-deception about\nthe existence of systematic injustice are innocent motives. A\ngroup\u2019s oppression is likely to be sustained if no one is held\nresponsible and no subsequent action taken to end it. Rather than\ninvoking either extreme position, most feminists argue that\nresponsibility for sustaining oppression should be determined by\nfactors such as whether ignorance of or failure to attend to\nsystematic oppression is excusable, the nature of the indirect harm\ncaused by mere participation in the system of oppression, and whether\na person\u2019s opting out of an oppressive system will have any\nimpact on that system. Another complication in assigning\nresponsibility is that it is often difficult to separate an\nindividual\u2019s own sexist behavior from systematic sexism.\n\nThe literature reveals a variety of feminist views on the\nresponsibility of members of the dominant group for the oppression of\nmembers of subordinate groups. Cheshire Calhoun defends one of the\nmore lenient positions (Calhoun 1989). Calhoun argues that in\n\u201cnormal moral contexts,\u201d where a person has generally good\nmoral reasoning skills and generally is able to figure out which\nactions are right, wrong, or controversial, a person\u2019s moral\nignorance is inexcusable. But in \u201cabnormal moral\ncontexts,\u201d those in which a subgroup of society \u201cmakes\nadvances in moral knowledge faster than they can be disseminated to\nand assimilated by the general public and subgroups at special moral\nrisk,\u201d a person\u2019s moral ignorance is excusable (396). Such\nis the case when feminists have moral knowledge that the general\npublic lacks because the public is not familiar with either\nsophisticated analyses of oppression, or the special new terminology\nand new categories that are not shared by nonfeminists (e.g.,\n\u201cmarginalize,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201cmarriage as\nprostitution\u201d). In abnormal moral contexts where ignorance is\nthe norm, persons lack a motive to be morally reflective, so it is not\nthe case that they ought to have known better. Calhoun concludes that\nmany men are not responsible for their participation in women\u2019s\noppression on the grounds that they are not culpably ignorant of the\nmoral knowledge that feminists have. Nevertheless, Calhoun argues that\nwe should reproach participants in oppressive systems, since excusing\nthem has the effect of sanctioning their wrongdoing or letting it\npass. Her hope is to motivate people to act otherwise and to treat\nthem as capable of self-legislation rather than mere products of\nsocial conditioning. Similarly, Samantha Brennan urges that in order\nto motivate change, the appropriate response to microinequities is to\nraise awareness about their occurrence, but not to trace back each one\nof them to a specific person upon whom sole responsibility falls\n(Brennan 2013, 193).\n\nMichele Moody-Adams defends a less lenient view about responsibility\nfor oppression than Calhoun\u2019s, dismissing in many cases the role\nof culture as a factor that justifies willful moral ignorance and that\non these grounds exempts from responsibility those who act wrongly\n(Moody-Adams 1994). Her target is the view that being from a certain\nculture and adopting its practices absolves a person from\nresponsibility for his actions. More specifically, she questions\nwhether being unable to know, due to one\u2019s upbringing in a\nculture, that certain actions are wrong, and being unable to question\nthe morality of the society\u2019s practices, absolves a person from\nresponsibility for his actions. She defines \u201caffected\nignorance\u201d as \u201cchoosing not to know what one can and\nshould know\u201d (296), as when we \u201cask no questions\u201d\nwhen we suspect wrongdoing, or when we fail to acknowledge our human\nfallibility by hiding behind and blaming our culture for our own\nwrongdoing. Moody-Adams believes that moral ignorance is more a matter\nof our failings as human beings, and less a matter of \u201ccultural\nlimitations,\u201d than some might believe. She argues against the\nmoral ignorance position by noting that cultures are both created and\ntransmitted by the people in them, that people modify or even\nradically revise them through their individual actions, and that\npeople often act against cultural norms and sometimes act on desires\nthat are in line with these norms but in ways not sanctioned by the\nculture (305). In short, cultures persist only because individuals\ncapable of responsible action persist (292\u2013293). Absolving from\nresponsibility members of a culture for the wrongdoings that take\nplace in the context of their culture misunderstands the tight\nconnection between culture and agency, and denies the humanity of\nthose who are rationally unimpaired and commit wrongdoing, even when\nthey are influenced by cultural norms (306).\n\nTracy Isaacs assumes that persons are all to some extent influenced by\nthe cultural context in which we live, and agrees with Moody-Adams\nthat there are times when we should not excuse persons, even when they\nare culturally influenced, for their part in wrongs that fit into a\nscheme of culturally accepted practices that is not recognized as\nwrong, including some sexist and racist practices (Isaacs 2011).\nHowever, contra Moody-Adams, Isaacs argues that not every case of\nwidespread moral ignorance is a case of affected ignorance, that is,\nof choosing not to know whether some practice in which one\nparticipates might be wrong, and in these cases, one\u2019s ignorance\nmay be truly nonculpable (161). According to Isaacs, persons may be\nexcused for wrongdoings associated with wrongful social practices when\nthey lack equal access to the full range of actual and possible moral\nknowledge, or when moral discoveries are not immediately known or\nknowable by everyone because they have not yet become commonplace\n(163\u2013164). Isaacs compares advances in moral knowledge to those\nabout knowledge of the natural world; in either case, there are some\nthings we can only know given a certain stage in the history of\nknowledge (163). Isaacs invokes Calhoun\u2019s distinction between\nmoral knowledge in normal moral contexts as opposed to moral knowledge\nin abnormal moral contexts, where only those moral\n\u201cexperts\u201d such as feminists, and members of disadvantaged\ngroups who may not be moral \u201cexperts\u201d but who have special\nmoral insights due to their experiences, acquire new moral knowledge\nabout which outsiders are unaware. Isaacs believes that the root of\nthe issue of responsibility lies with shifting a society from an\nabnormal moral context to a normal moral context, for it is in the\nlatter where appeals to ignorance are no longer excusable. While\nCalhoun argues that the best way for this shift to take place is\nthrough reproach, e.g., labeling as sexist people who use the term\n\u201cgirl\u201d instead of \u201cwoman\u201d to refer to adult\nfemales, Isaacs favors dialogue in which traditional views are\nchallenged by moral \u201cexperts,\u201d members of disadvantaged\ngroups, and the like. The shift in context is achieved, she notes,\nwhen individuals come to see themselves as responsible (174). For\nexample, our society has shifted sufficiently such that no one who\nwrites for a living can legitimately claim to be ignorant about gender\nneutral pronouns used in place of the male pronoun, and thus no one in\nthis group is excused for being ignorant about this matter.\n\nBut there are other, much less lenient views about responsibility for\nthe harms of oppression that some feminists and race theorists\nadvocate. These accounts arguably ground responsibility in features\nthat are independent of cultural influence, by employing the notion of\nhumanity, the view that all persons are equal in some fundamental\nsense that transcends gender and race. One way to flesh out this view\nis to invoke Immanuel Kant\u2019s notion of humanity, that all\npersons are rational, autonomous beings possessing dignity and\ndeserving of respect. In short, they have intrinsic value in virtue of\nbeing persons. According to the accounts of responsibility at issue,\nmembers of socially dominant groups, or, \u201cthe privileged,\u201d\nare responsible for knowing and acting on these basic facts about\nhumanity that they share with their subordinates (Zack, 1998,\n42\u201343; Superson, 2004). That is, in spite of the fact that\noppression is a difficult concept to grasp, and notwithstanding\nCalhoun\u2019s and Isaacs\u2019s points about feminists having\nspecial knowledge that is not shared by the general public, the\nprivileged ought to recognize, acknowledge, and respect their\nsubordinates in virtue of these features common to all persons, even\nif patriarchal and racist societies muddle these facts about humanity\nby, for example, stereotyping all members of the subordinate group.\nSince knowing that all persons are equal in certain basic respects is\na simple matter, defenders of this view do not want to absolve from\nresponsibility those who disrespect others\u2019 humanity. At best,\nresponsibility ascriptions might be made on the basis of the degree of\ndifficulty involved in sorting through patriarchal or racist norms and\nrecognizing that a particular behavior does, indeed, violate a\nperson\u2019s humanity.\n\nA further wrinkle in the debate about moral responsibility in the\ncontext of oppression is evidenced in subtle cases of sexism in which\nthe agent is unaware of their sexism. An issue that nicely illustrates\nthis phenomenon is that of implicit bias. This topic in moral\npsychology has recently gained a lot of attention and has showcased\none of the ways in which philosophy can be enriched by empirical\nstudies (see the entry on\n implicit bias;\n and Brownstein and Saul 2016a and 2016b). Jennifer Saul defines\n\u201cimplicit bias\u201d as unconscious biases that affect the way\nwe perceive, evaluate, or interact with people from the group that our\nbiases \u2018target\u2019 (Saul 2013, 40). Saul points to\npsychological research that shows that most people, including those\nwho profess to have egalitarian views and even those who are members\nof subordinate groups, harbor implicit biases against women and other\nminority groups. For example, Implicit Association tests, now taken by\nmillions of people, that ask subjects to pair positive and negative\nadjectives with pictures of black and white faces, reveal that we are\nmuch quicker to pair black faces with negative adjectives than with\npositive ones (Brownstein and Saul 2016b, 1). Implicit biases are\nlikely to cash out, without the agent\u2019s conscious awareness, in\nways that harm members of subordinate groups to which certain\nstereotypes are applied. Saul links the phenomenon of implicit bias to\nwomen\u2019s underrepresentation in philosophy: in a tradition that\nis steeped in associating reason, objectivity, and philosophical\nthought with maleness, and emotion, subjectivity, and the\nnon-philosophical with femaleness, it is likely that philosophers will\ndisplay implicit bias against women when it comes to nonanonymous\njournal submissions, cvs for hiring, service loads, and\nclassroom incivility (Saul 2013, 41, 43, 45).\n\nGiven that implicit biases are largely unconscious and resistant to\nthe agent\u2019s direct efforts to change or control them by force of\nwill or mere intention (Brownstein and Saul 2016b, 2), can the agent\nbe morally responsible for having them? Robin Zheng illustrates the\ntension between holding and not holding agents morally responsible for\ntheir own implicit biases (Zheng 2016). Zheng notes that, on the one\nhand, because we are often unaware of our implicit biases and so\ncannot control their influence, we do not seem to be responsible for\nthem. But on the other hand, because implicit biases are the products\nand the perpetrators of social inequality, it seems right to hold\nagents responsible for them (62). Zheng\u2019s proposal is to have\ntwo accounts of responsibility in cases of implicit bias. One is\nresponsibility as attributability, according to which we are morally\nresponsible when our actions reflect who we are as moral agents\nbecause they are manifestations of our ends, commitments, or values\n(62). Because we are often unaware of our implicit biases, on the\nattributability account of responsibility, we would be off the hook\nfor behaviors that stem from them. Zheng argues for absolving from\nattributable responsibility a person who would not upon reflection\nendorse the influence of implicit bias on their action and who has\ndone what they can reasonably be expected to do to avoid and respond\nto the implicit bias once they are made aware of it (72). A second\nkind of responsibility is what Zheng calls \u201caccountability\nresponsibility,\u201d according to which we are responsible for our\nactions when it is appropriate for others to enforce certain\nexpectations and demands on those actions (63). In the case of\nimplicit biases, Zheng believes that we can be attributively not\nresponsible for our biases while being accountable for them. Zheng is\nlenient in the ways that Isaacs and Brennan are in that she urges that\nwe not hold others attributively responsible for conditions like\nimplicit bias, at least for the reasons that it is nearly impossible\nto determine whether they harbor them in particular cases, and that\npeople are more likely to do better without accusations of sexism and\nthe like (78).\n",
