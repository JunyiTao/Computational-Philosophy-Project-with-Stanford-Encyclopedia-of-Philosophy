    "main_text": "Feminist Analyses of Particular Areas of Biological Research || Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology\n3.2 Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology\n\n\nBroadly speaking, sociobiology, which arises out of work in\npopulation genetics, population ecology and ethology, is the\nevolutionary study of human and non-human social behavior.\nSociobiologists postulate that some behaviors are traits, just like\nheight or hair color, that are subject to evolution by natural\nselection. Ideally, to show that a behavior is an evolutionary\nadaptation, researchers must demonstrate that (1) the behavior is\nheritable, (2) there is or was behavioral variability among individuals\nin a population, and (3) that differential reproduction, caused by the\npresence of the behavior in question, led to an increase in the\nfrequency of individuals tending to exhibit that behavior in a\npopulation. Since researchers cannot go back in time to directly\nobserve the evolution of current behaviors, they most often rely on\nindirect evidence. Sociobiology is most often associated with E.O.\nWilson, either his more general work exemplified in his book\nSociobiology a New Synthesis (1975) or On Human\nNature (1978), which focuses on human sociobiology. There is\nfeminist work in sociobiology such as Sarah Hrdy's work on\nmother-infant relations (1981/1999, 1986).\n\nEvolutionary psychology is sometimes described as\npsychology that is informed by evolutionary theory and sometimes\ndescribed as the latest version of sociobiology. Evolutionary\npsychology differs from sociobiology in several respects. Instead\nof looking for adaptive explanations for particular behaviors,\nevolutionary psychologists develop adaptive hypotheses for\npsychological mechanisms that generate behaviors and tend to assume a\nmodular theory of mind. Whereas there is incredible diversity of\nhuman behavior, many evolutionary psychologists postulate a smaller\nnumber of mechanisms or modules that are responsible for a range of\nbehaviors. Much work in evolutionary psychology relies on\nevolutionary theoretical foundations and psychological empirical\nmethods. Major themes in evolutionary psychological research\ninclude studies of social exchange (Cosmides 1989, Cosmides and Tooby\n1992, Tooby and Cosmides (1992), family dynamics and conflict\n(including violence against stepchildren (Daly and Wilson 2005) and\nwives (Wilson and Daly 1998)), and human mate choice and sexual\njealousy (Buss 2003, 2005).\n\n\nSociobiology and evolutionary psychology are prominent in popular\nbooks (ex. Wilson 1978, Buss 1994/2003, 2005) and can be found in\npopular media ranging from Business Week (Dotinga 2010) to\nWebMD (Denoon\u2014see the Other Internet Resources). There are two\nmajor feminist concerns with much sociobiological and evolutionary\npsychological research on sex and gender. First the research presents\na picture of human nature that exhibits androcentric, sexist, and\ncapitalist social values. Feminist philosophers of biology have been\nmotivated to carefully analyze this research and have found\nsignificant methodological problems. They have found several areas in\nwhich implicit and unacknowledged social values have influenced this\nresearch and have confounded our understanding of gender and\nbehavior. For example, Thornhill and Palmer in their book, A\nNatural History of Rape (2000), argue that rape is either a\nby-product of male adaptations to desire multiple sexual partners, or\nan evolutionary adaptation itself. In the adaptation view, rape is a\nfacultative reproductive strategy, meaning that rape is the result of\nnatural selection favoring men who commit rape when its evolutionary\nbenefits in terms of producing offspring outweigh its evolutionary\ncosts (such as decreases in the number of offspring produced because\nof injury or punishment).\n\n\nThere is a significant feminist response to this research (see\nespecially Travis 2003 edited volume). For example,\nElisabeth Lloyd (2003) reveals gaps and unjustified assumptions in\nThornhill and Palmer's evolutionary arguments. She points\nout that Thornhill and Palmer's view is problematically\nadaptationist, meaning that it exhibits an unjustified commitment to\nnatural selection over other kinds of explanation (see Gould and\nLewontin 1979 for the main explanation of, and argument against,\nadaptationism (see the entry on adaptationism), Further,\nLloyd shows that they fail to demonstrate that the behavior in question\nis heritable or that it is the product of natural selection.\nFinally, Lloyd points out that Thornhill and Palmer make the\nunjustified assumption that rape is a unitary phenomenon in the face of\nthe \u201cstriking disunity among the various acts that are classed as\nrape\u201d (240).\n\n\nEmily Martin (2003) also points out that Thornhill and Palmer make\nproblematic assumptions in their definition of \u2018rape\u2019. She\nargues that they falsely assume that rape is a static trait not only\nacross cultures, but across species, that they fail to see that\ncharacterizing a behavior as rape requires a culturally specific notion\nof consent and that cultural meanings of rape have changed over\ntime. (See the entry on \nfeminist perspectives on rape for\na more detailed discussion of issues of consent. There remains an\nopportunity for feminist philosophy of biology concerning rape to be\nfurther integrated with feminist literature concerning rape.) Martin\npoints out a second category of assumptions in Thornhill and\nPalmer's work regarding individualism, competition, and\naggression, arising out of evolutionary theory itself. She points\nout the influence of Malthus' work on overpopulation and scarcity\nof resources and of Adam Smith's economics on Darwin's\nformulation of natural selection. She argues that evolutionary\nexplanations tend to be based on notions of individual competition\nunder conditions of scarcity, which are historically and culturally\nspecific and need not hold. She writes, \u201cAs Thornhill and\nPalmer, as well as most who espouse the tenets of sociobiology, see the\nworld, it is make up of highly individualized agents bent on maximizing\ntheir own advantage, defined as increasing their genetic stake in the\nnext generation. Any means to that end, however ruthless, violent\nor aggressive, will be looked for and justified as necessary to\nincreasing fitness, so defined\u201d (375).\n\n\nA second category of feminist concern regarding much research in\nsociobiology and evolutionary psychology involves problematic\nassumptions of a coarse causal connection between genes and\nbehavior. These assumptions, coupled with the assertion that\nhuman behaviors are the result of natural selection, makes it seem as\nthough, as Ruth Bleier (1984, 15) puts it, \u201cwe had best resign\nourselves to the more unsavory aspects of human behavior.\u201d\nThe worry is that these studies of the evolution of human behavior\ncast behaviors such as violence against women, wives, and children,\nand the sexual division of labor as biologically determined, hence\nmaking attempts at social change seem futile.\n\n\nFor example, sociobiologist, David Barash writes, \u201cThere is\ngood reason to believe that we are (genetically) primed to be much less\nsexually egalitarian than we appear to be\u201d (1979, 47) and\n\u201cBecause men maximize their fitness differently from women, it is\nperfectly good biology that business and professions taste sweeter to\nthem, while home and child care taste sweeter to women\u201d (1979,\n114). When it comes to sex, sociobiologist E.O. Wilson writes,\n\u201cIt pays for males to be aggressive, hasty, fickle and\nundiscriminating. In theory it is more profitable for females to\nbe coy, to hold back until they can identify males with the best\ngenes\u2026 Human beings obey this biological principle\nfaithfully\u201d (1978, 125).\n\n\nEvolutionary psychologists tend to argue that the mechanisms that\nproduce behaviors (modules), rather than the behaviors themselves, are\nadaptations. This allows them to introduce flexibility in the\nexpression of behaviors, because some of these mechanisms may be\ntriggered by specific environmental conditions that might not be\npresent. In the example of the evolution of rape discussed above,\nthe argument is not that all men rape, but rather that rape is adaptive\nin environments where its evolutionary benefits outweigh the\ncosts. However, note that the claim is still that rape is a\nuniversal, cross-cultural adaptation, a mechanism ready and waiting to\nbe triggered by the right environmental conditions.\n\n\nFeminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology have identified a\nrange of problems common among much research in sociobiology and\nevolutionary psychology. (The list below is primarily drawn from\nBleier 1984; see also Anne Fausto-Sterling 1997a, b, 2000; Kitcher 1985\nand Sterelny and Griffiths 1999 offer a good overview and introduction\nto the non-feminist literature.) These problems include kinds of bias\nas well as methodological challenges.\n\nAndrocentrism. Historically female primates were\nstudied only in their interactions with males or with infants.\nWomen primatologists (see Haraway 1989) and sociobiologists (Hrdy 1986)\nwho carefully observed females, as well as other members of primate\ngroups, discovered new information that overthrew previously held\nbeliefs regarding dominance hierarchies, mate selection, and\nfemale-female competition by focusing on female-female\ninteractions.\n\nEthnocentrism. Much research on human behavior focuses on\nidentifying and explaining behavioral traits that are universal among\nhumans and have a cross-cultural meaning. For example, Buss\nargues that love is cross-cultural (1994/2003) and Wilson and Daly that\nmarriage is cross-cultural (1992). However, human beings live in a wide\nvariety of cultural and environmental contexts. John Dupr\u00e9\nwrites\n\n\nAnthropologists describe systems of marriage that are monogamous,\npolygamous, occasionally polyandrous, hypergamous or hypogamous (women\nmarrying up or down although equal status is said to be the commonest\ncase), between people of the same sex, and is some cases as not\ninvolving sexual relations at all (2001, 59).\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it difficult to imagine what the cross-cultural universal\ncould be. It also makes it very easy to make false assumptions\nabout the nature of such a phenomenon based on a particular cultural\nperspective.\n\nAnthropocentrism. There is room for unrecognized or\nimplicit social values to enter into research when researchers make\ncomparisons among species. It is easy to create circular\narguments when researchers use loaded terms, defined in the context of\nparticular human language and culture, to describe animal behavior and\nthen use those descriptions to argue that human behaviors are innate\nbecause they are found in animals. For example, it is common to\nrefer to \u2018harems\u2019 and \u2018prostitution\u2019 when\ndescribing the behavior of non-human primates. There is an\nextensive literature on the evolution of rape, with rape being\n\u2018observed\u2019 in flowers, scorpion flies, some species of fish\nand ducks, and then these observations are used to draw conclusions\nabout the biological nature of rape in humans. An obvious problem\nis that rape in humans is defined as sex in the absence of consent or\nthat is against the victim's will. The same notion of\nconsent or will in flowers, flies, fish, and ducks is absent.\n\nLack of attention to limitations inherent in studying\nhumans. Human behavior is a fraught area of study. On one\nhand it is seductive because there is a deep interest in trying to\nunderstand why we behave as we do. One the other hand, if\nresearchers are trying to understand social behavior in general, there\nis little to recommend human beings as experimental subjects.\nFirst, it is unethical to perform the necessary controlled experiments\non humans. Furthermore, such experiments are impractical because we\nlive too long for researchers to conveniently follow the development\nand evolutionary consequences of particular behavioral traits and\ntendencies. In addition, a common evolutionary investigative\ntechnique is to compare traits among closely related species. However\nas Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) point out, human beings are\nevolutionary orphans. Even though there are several species of\nnon-human primates that are extensively studied, they are simply not as\nnumerous, nor do they form as closely a related group of species with\nhumans, as can be found in, for example, groups of social ant or bee\nspecies. Finally, human behavior is complicated by intentionality,\nlanguage and culture, which make comparisons between human and\nnon-human animals challenging. For example, refer back\nMartin's (2003) critique of evolutionary explanations of\nrape. The notion of consent means something very different in a\nhuman as opposed to an animal context. As a result of limitations\ninherent to studying the evolution of human behavior, it is more\nchallenging to draw conclusions about human behavior than about the\nbehavior of many other groups of animals, and conclusions about human\nbeings might need to be more tentative than conclusions about other\norganisms.\n\nLack of attention to changing environments. There is a lack\nof good information about the environment, including the social\nenvironment, in which humans evolved. We know that there are\ndifferences among the environments in which people currently live and\nbetween current environments and early human environments. Postulating\nevolutionary adaptations only makes sense in reference to a particular\nenvironment because adaptations are responses to particular\nenvironmental challenges. A behavior may be an adaptation to a past\nenvironment and not benefit individuals in a current environment.\nAlternatively, a behavior may benefit an individual without being the\nresult of natural selection for that benefit. As a result, conclusions\ndrawn about the evolution of human behavior need to be\ntentative.\n\nAdaptationism (Failure to adequately consider causes of\nevolution other than natural selection). Causes of evolution other\nthan natural selection must be tested. For example, even if there\nare behaviors that are correlated with specific genes it does not\nfollow that the behavior is the result of natural selection and hence\nis an adaptation. Genes commonly have multiple effects and it is\npossible for natural selection to select for only one of those\neffects. In this case the other effect will increase in frequency\nin the population even though it is not selected for. A similar\ncase can occur when two genes are linked on the same chromosome.\nIn this way a behavior may be very common not because it confers an\nevolutionary advantage, but because it is associated with a different\nbeneficial trait. Other causes of evolution include random drift,\nmutation, and immigration of individuals between\npopulations. Recall that Elisabeth Lloyd (2003) identified\nadaptationism as a problem with Thornhill and Palmer's arguments\nabout the evolution of rape.\n\nLack of clear definitions of behavior. Behavioral traits\nneed to be clearly defined. For example, it is postulated that\nmales are naturally more aggressive than females. What counts as\naggression is unclear. Is it going to war, or punching another\nindividual, or having very active adrenal function? The\nappropriate grain of analysis is not clear. If one lives in a\nculture in which males are considered more aggressive than females,\nthen one may notice the higher proportion of men rather than women who\ncommit violent crimes and not notice cases of females fighting to\ndefend their offspring or competing with each other for\nresources. The issue of defining traits is not only a matter of\nclarity. Ontology is at stake because for evolutionary hypotheses\nto explain what exists in the world, our definitions must divide up the\nworld into traits that are passed from generation to generation and on\nwhich natural selection can act.\n\nProblematic choice of comparison species. The data\none can gather and the conclusions one can draw about human behavioral\nevolution from non-human primates are highly dependent on the primate\nspecies to which one attends. For example, in mid-20th century\nprimatology researchers chose species for study, such as savanna\nbaboons, which had social structures that seemed similar to\nhumans. In the 1970's feminist primatologists were\ninstrumental in convincing the scientific community that chimpanzees\nwere a more appropriate species for modeling key transitions in human\nevolution. This switch in model organism was supported by\nmolecular phylogenetic, comparative anatomical, and paleontological\ndata, but it was also a strategic feminist move, as chimpanzees are\nmatrifocal creatures with complex social lives. This facilitated\na research focus on mothering, which was consistent with the focus on\nmaternal thinking and social motherhood in that period of western\nfeminism (Haraway 1989). There are at least two kinds of\nrecommendations that arise here. First, if one is focusing on\nremoving bias, then one should take care not to falsely generalize\nacross the diversity that can be found among primate species (Hrdy\n1986). Second, one needs to take responsibility for one's\nchoice of model organism, because it will have an impact on the kinds\nof knowledge that one can produce (Haraway 1989).\n\n\nEvolutionary research regarding human behavior is especially\ndifficult to do well. It is very easy to take an aspect of human\nsocial behavior that seems universal to a particular group of\nresearchers, for example male aggression, and create a compelling but\nunsupported story about why that behavior enhances the survival and\nreproduction of individuals exhibiting it and hence\n\u2018explains\u2019 why it is currently\n\u2018universal.\u2019 In particular, there is little analysis\nof just what it is that makes these stories seem compelling or even\ncommonsensical. It is important to note that these just-so\nstories predominantly support the social status quo and traditional\nWestern, capitalist, patriarchal \u2018virtues\u2019 ranging from a\ntendency to be entrepreneurial and the inevitability of hierarchical\nsocial arrangements, to the naturalness of male promiscuity and\nviolence against women. Although some feminists are very pessimistic\nabout the possibility of conducting non-sexist research on the\nevolution of human behavior, there is not a general view within\nfeminist philosophy of biology that all sociobiological research is\nproblematic. In fact, some feminist critics and scientists use\nnon-sexist sociobiological research on non-human animals (for example\nthe work of Sarah Hrdy) to critique problematic evolutionary accounts of gendered\nbehavior.\n\n\nSexual selection and evolutionary accounts of behavior that relate\nto sex and gender are examples of two areas of science that have been\ntreated to extensive analysis by feminist philosophers of\nbiology. This entry now turns to common themes in feminist\nphilosophy of biology.\n",
