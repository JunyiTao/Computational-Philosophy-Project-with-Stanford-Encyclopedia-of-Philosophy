    "main_text": "The Problem of Race || Mestizo Genomics\n3.2 Mestizo Genomics\n\nDespite the majority consensus among scientists and philosophers on\nracial skepticism, certain theoretical, empirical, technical, and\ntechnological developments in genetics in recent decades may appear to\nthe layperson to reintroduce racial or race-like categories. Moreover,\nindependent of the position and personal intentions of scientists with\nregards to the subject of race, genetics has transformed common sense\nnotions of race, despite also partially reinforcing some of them.\n\nHere, we must consider developments that involve theoretical,\nempirical, and technical aspects of genomics and genetic ancestry\nstudies on the one hand, and two of their respective technological\napplications, namely genomic medicine and forensic genetics, on the\nother. Because of their presence in Latin America, all these areas\nhave been the subject of philosophical reflection.\n\nIn relation to genomics research, Wade, L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n,\nRestrepo and Ventura-Santos (2014b) have noted that, given the iconic\nstatus of the fact that all humans share 99.9% of their genomes, the\ndevelopment of new technologies has made it possible to explore the\nremaining 0.1% that, in principle, causes much of the obvious physical\ndiversity of humans. As in other regions of the world, some\nlaboratories in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and\nColombia, have been mapping the genomes of local populations with the\ngoal of tracing population histories and locating the genetic basis of\ndisease, in addition to establishing their genomes. This has given\nrise to the respective Mexican and Brazilian genome mapping projects\nand the Mexican mestizo and Homo brasilis genome\nprojects.\n\nAs has been pointed out by Kent, Garc\u00eda-Deister, L\u00f3pez\nBeltr\u00e1n, Ventura-Santos, Schwartz-Mar\u00edn and Wade (2015)\nin their comparison of both cases from the point of view of social\nstudies of science, these projects have been developed in different\nnational contexts with distinct scientific and social trajectories.\nWhile in Mexico, mapping the genomic mestizo is driven mainly\nin relation to health, in Brazil, the main issue is that of race, as\nwe saw in the previous section.\n\nThe very notion of mestizo, including Mexican\nmestizo in particular, was the subject of criticism in genomic\nstudies not only from philosophy but also from cultural anthropology,\nsociology, biological anthropology, history of science, and the social\nstudies of science (Wade et al. 2015). With regards to philosophy,\nseveral authors agree with this criticism connected to both the\nontological problem of race and the story of the birth of a nation and\nthe genetic reification of the Mexican national identity (L\u00f3pez\nBeltr\u00e1n, Garc\u00eda-Deister, & R\u00edos Sandoval\n2014; Wade 2014; Wade et al. 2014b, 2015). In this regard, some\nauthors point out that a variety of mestizaje (interbreeding)\nhas taken place, as opposed to a single process (Wade et al. 2014b),\nwhile others focus on methodological problems (Winther 2011; Pascacio\nMontijo 2011, Arroyo Santos 2011; Schwartz Mar\u00edn 2011;\nL\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n & Vergara Silva 2011; L\u00f3pez\nBeltr\u00e1n & Garc\u00eda Deister 2013).\n\nIn relation to these methodological issues, Danish philosopher of\nbiology Rasmus Gr\u00f8nfeldt Winther, who grew up in Venezuela and\ncompleted postdoctoral studies in Mexico, analyzes the two\nmathematical methods used in the genetic classifications of human\ngroups: diversity partitioning and clustering\nanalysis. He argues that although both are legitimate and\nconsistent methodologies, neither implies anything specific with\nregards to the reality of these groups. In fact, the results of these\ntwo methods point in opposite ontological directions. While models\npartitioning diversity indicate that the abstraction of race is not\ngrounded in genetic data, those that assign particular individuals to\nrobust clustering could be taken as evidence of a strong sense of the\nreality of these human groups. However, both the results and inputs of\nthese methodologies are subject to interpretation and bias, in\naddition to being theory-laden. Thus, both diversity partitioning and\ncluster analysis genetically reify the concept of race due to their\nsensitivity to highly questionable assumptions of various kinds\n(Winther 2011).\n\nGoing deeper into the criticism of the methodology of clustering\nanalysis, Mexican biologist and philosopher of biology Yuriditzi\nPascacio Montijo points out that the classification and population\npartitioning on which Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Genomic\nMedicine (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Gen\u00f3mica or\nINMEGEN in the original Spanish) bases its analysis and\ncharacterization of the genetic structure of a population corresponds\nto various pre-established categorizations. The problem lies in the\nfact that these classifying categories, e.g., Zapotec, are\nnot natural classes but rather are established based on interests and\nobjectives that could be relevant in a particular context, for example\nMexico\u2019s National Commission for the Development of Indigenous\nPeoples (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los\nPueblos Ind\u00edgenas or CDI in the original Spanish) or\nMexico\u2019s National Indigenous Languages Institute (Instituto\nNacional de Lenguas Ind\u00edgenas or INALI in the original\nSpanish) but not necessarily in others, like that of INMEGEN, whose\ngenotyping is neither useful nor representative of the complexity and\ndynamics of populations in Mexico (Pascacio-Montijo 2011).\n\nIn a similar vein, Mexican Alfonso Arroyo Santos, first trained as a\nbiomedical researcher and later as a philosopher, argues against\nINMEGEN\u2019s genomic diversity project. He maintains that it is\nimpossible to appeal to objective variables that allow for both the\ncreation of a particular class for Mexican mestizos and the\nidentification of genes that cause common multifactorial and polygenic\ndiseases in Mexico, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or certain types\nof cancer. For him, the central problem lies in the fact that\nmultivariate diseases can only be studied by means of surrogate\nvariables, and it is a mistake to reify a surrogate variable in\nthe context of causal claims that, at best, only have some probability\nof occurrence. In the case of the study of genetic diseases, the\nsurrogate variable is known as the risk gene or\nhaplotype. To discover genetic risk factors, a\ngenome-wide association study (GWAS) or whole genome\nassociation study (WGAS) is usually carried out. However, these\nstudies have known limitations. It is clear that correlating a\nchromosomal region with the occurrence of a disease is not the same as\nstating that a genetic element, or causal gene, has been identified.\nThus, INMEGEN\u2019s analyses only account for surrogate variables,\nand any historical attribution of racial origin and population\nmorbidity due to ethnicity is incorrect. In order to support their\ngenetic findings, then, researchers must appeal to history,\nanthropology, geography, and other disciplines in which the notion of\nmestizo has been constructed. According to Arroyo-Santos\n(2011), a tautological dialectic is thus created between the\nmolecularized humanities and genetics since one field becomes the\ntheoretical basis of the other or, in other words, one takes\nepistemic credit from the other, reifying theories that never\nreceived empirical support.\n",
