    "main_text": "Information Processing Using Statistical Mechanics || Gibbsian proofs\n4.2 Gibbsian proofs\n\n\nThe earliest attempts to construct general, rigorous proofs of\nLandauer's principle, from within statistical mechanics, were by\nShizume (1995) and Piechocinska (2000). (Although Penrose (1970,\nChapter VI) does, in effect, derive an entropic cost for the reset\noperation, it appears his work was motivated quite independently of\nLandauer's). Shizume's proof relies upon treating thermal contact as a\nGaussian white noise field in a Langevin equation, while Piechocinska\nassumes Hamiltonian dynamics and a heat bath that is initially\nuncorrelated with the system and represented by a Gibbs canonical\ndistribution.\n\n\nThese proofs, and those that follow on from them, are in the\ntradition of making standard assumptions that are generally accepted\nwithin the context of practical calculations in statistical mechanics.\nIt is taken for granted that a probability distribution over at least\nsome region of state space is a meaningful characterisation of the\nstate of a system, and further constraints are usually assumed about\nwhat kind of probability distribution this could be. From the point of\nview of investigating questions about the fundamental consistency of\nstatistical mechanics, this may appear unsatisfactory. If the aim is\nmore modest, of simply investigating the generality of the\ncircumstances under which Landauer's principle might hold, such proofs\nmay still be seen to be of value. It is important to distinguish\nbetween, for example, the rather hard problem of providing an\nexplanation of why thermalised systems should be represented\nby a canonical distribution over the accessible states space, from the\nsomewhat more easy task of deriving the consequences of the empirically\njustified observation that thermalised systems are well\nrepresented by a canonical distribution over the accessible state\nspace.\n\n\nPiechocinska provided proofs for both the classical and quantum\ncases. A brief sketch of Piechocinska's quantum proof is possible.\nFirst simply define a function\n\n\u0393(i, f, m, n)=\u2009ln\u2009pi\n\u2212 \u2009ln\u2009pf \u2212 \u03b2(En \u2212 Em),\n where\npi is\nthe occupation probability of an initial state\ni of the system,\npf the\noccupation probability of a final state f,\nbeta the dispersion parameter of the canonical distribution of the heat\nbath, and\nEm and\nEn the\nenergies of eigenstates of the heat bath. No particular physical\nsignificance is attached to this function. However, from the\nrequirement that the overall evolution be unitary, it can be shown\n\u27e8\u2009e\u2212\u0393\u2009\u27e9=1\n\nand so by  convexity\n\u27e8\u2009\u0393\u2009\u27e9 \u2265 0. The mean heat generated in the heat bath can\nthen easily be shown to\n satisfy\n\u27e8\u2009Q\u2009\u27e9 \u2265 \u2212\u0394H\u2009k\u2009T\u2009ln\u20092 \nwhere\n \u0394H =\n \u2211\u2009i pi\u2009log\u2009pi\n \u2212\n \u2211\u2009f pf\u2009log\u2009pf\n is the change in Shannon information over the states of the system\nduring the operation. If there are assumed to be two equiprobable\ninput states, the requirement that the operation be a resetting\noperation and leave the system determinately in a specific output\nstate leads to \u0394H = \u22121 and the usual expression\nof Landauer's principle is obtained.\n\n\nThis considers only pure quantum states to represent logical states,\nalthough in the classical case her proof allows logical states to be\nrepresented by macrostates. Maroney (2009) generalised the method\nfurther, to input and output states represented by macrostates with\nvariable mean internal energies, entropies and temperatures and\nconsidered the consequences for more general logical operations than\nthe reset operation. Turgut (2009), building on Penrose's work,\nderived similar\u2014though apparently more powerful\u2014results\nusing the Gibbs microcanonical distribution approach.\n",
