    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges || The Time Asymmetry Challenge\n2.5 The Time Asymmetry Challenge\n2.5.1 The general argument\n\nPerhaps the most influential argument for the claim that causal\nnotions cannot play a legitimate role in physics appeals to the fact\nthat the causal relation is generally understood to be asymmetric.\nThis asymmetry is often assumed to coincide with a temporal asymmetry\naccording to which effects do not precede their\n causes.[4]\n This gives rise to the time asymmetry challenge that contrasts the\ntime-asymmetry of causal relations with the purported fact that\nphysical laws make no distinction between the past and future\ndirection. This contrast is offered as a reason for why causal\nrelations cannot be a part of physical theorizing. The time-asymmetry\nchallenge can be represented in premise-conclusion form as\nfollows:\n\nCausal relations are temporally asymmetric.\nThe physical laws of our well-established theories have the same\ncharacter in both the future and the past direction.\nPhysical laws that have the same character in both temporal\ndirections cannot ground time-asymmetric properties or relations.\nTherefore, causal relations cannot be grounded in features of\nphysical laws.\nProperties or relations that cannot be grounded in features of\nphysical laws cannot play a legitimate role in physics.\nTherefore, causal relations cannot play a legitimate role in\nphysics.\n\n\nSome authors respond to this argument by rejecting premise 1, positing\na symmetric notion of causal dependence, which for non-simultaneous\ncause-effect pairs is also time-symmetric (Ney 2009). A potential\nproblem for this response is that it appears to collapse the\ndistinction between the notions of dependence and causation and may\nhave difficulties explaining how a symmetric notion of causal\ndependence (as opposed to an asymmetric notion of causation) can play\na role in elucidating the apparently asymmetric notions of\nintervention, responsibility, or explanation. These problems appear\nespecially pressing from the perspective of the functional project.\nThus, Ney\u2019s proposal is most promisingly considered as part of a\nmetaphysical project of uncovering the metaphysical grounds of causal\nclaims.\n\nWhat is it for laws to have the same character in the future and past\ndirections? Farr and Reutlinger (2013) point out that this can be made\nprecise in two logically independent ways and that we have to\ndistinguish the claim (i) that the laws are both future and past\ndeterministic from the claim (ii) that the laws are time-reversal\ninvariant. Russell is often interpreted as appealing to (ii), when he\nsays that\n\n\nin the motion of mutually gravitating bodies, there is nothing that\ncan be called a cause and nothing that can be called an effect; there\nis merely a formula. (Russell 1927 [2012: 141])\n\n\nMaudlin (2007) points out that on reading (ii) premise 2 is false,\nsince not all the fundamental laws of physics are in fact\ntime-reversal invariant. According to the CPT-Theorem, any plausible\nquantum theory will be invariant under the combination of parity\ntransformation plus charge conjugation plus time reversal. Since there\nis experimental evidence for CP-violations, we should conclude that\nquantum theories violate time-reversal invariance.\n\nIt has also been argued that even when considering time-reversal\ninvariance the argument applies only to deterministic theories, since\ntheories with non-trivial probabilistic state-transition laws are\ninherently time-asymmetric. As Satosi Watanabe (1965) shows, there can\nbe no genuinely probabilistic theory with both non-trivial forward and\nbackward transition probabilities (see also Healey 1983; Callender\n2000). Thus, if quantum mechanics is understood as a fundamentally\nprobabilistic theory, the argument\u2019s scope is limited to what by\nthe argument defenders\u2019 own lights are the less fundamental\ndeterministic theories of classical physics.\n2.5.2 Causal (and anti-causal) Green\u2019s functions\n\nThe time-asymmetry challenge is sometimes raised in the context of\ndiscussing the interpretation of a theory\u2019s so-called\n\u201cGreen\u2019s function\u201d, which specifies how a system\nresponds to a localized point-like disturbance. For example, the\nGreen\u2019s function associated with the wave equation describes the\ncircular ripples on a pond\u2019s surface after a small pebble was\ndropped in. When a theory\u2019s equations are linear, the overall\nresponse of a system to multiple point-like disturbances can be\ncalculated by summing or integrating over all disturbances. The\nimportant mathematical result is that any solution to the\ntheory\u2019s equations can be represented as a sum of two\ncomponents: a sum or integral over the Green\u2019s function for all\nthe point-like disturbances plus a solution to the source-free\nequations. That is, the most general solution to the wave equation\napplied to our pond will consist of sums of ripples associated with\nany pebbles being dropped into the pond plus source-free waves on the\npond not associated with any pebble as their \u201csource\u201d.\n\nPutting the same point somewhat more formally, any linear differential\noperator L associated with an inhomogeneous differential equation\n\\(\\mathrm{L}y=f(x)\\) and with constant coefficients possesses a\nfundamental solution or Green\u2019s function G, which is a solution\nto the inhomogeneous differential equation \\(\\mathrm{LG}=\\delta (x),\\)\nwhere \\(\\delta(x)\\) is the delta function, a generalized function that\nis zero everywhere except at \\(x=0.\\) The Green\u2019s function tells\nus what the contribution of introducing a point-disturbance or\nperturbation into a system at \\((x', t')\\) is to the state of the\nsystem at some other point \\((x, t).\\) The overall response of a\nsystem at \\((x, t)\\) to multiple perturbations is calculated by\nsumming or integrating over all point-like disturbances. The most\ngeneral solution to a theory is given by adding to this response to\ndisturbances a solution to the homogenous equation\n\\(\\mathrm{L}y=0.\\)\n\nGreen\u2019s functions, which are broadly applicable in physics, are\nquite naturally interpreted in causal terms, allowing us to represent\nthe state at \\((x, t)\\) as sum of different disturbances as its\ncauses. In fact, Green\u2019s functions provide \u201ca primary\nlocus for causal claims within physics texts\u201d (Smith 2013: 667).\nThe causal significance of the Green function formalism has been\nchallenged, however, by invoking a version of the time-asymmetry\nchallenge. In the case of systems governed by the time-reversal\ninvariant hyperbolic equations (such as the wave equation\nwhich can be derived from the Maxwell-Lorentz equations in classical\nelectrodynamics) any state of a system can be represented either as a\nsum of \u201ccausal\u201d or so-called retarded\nGreen\u2019s functions and a solution to an initial value problem of\nthe homogenous, source-free equation \\(\\mathrm{LG}=0;\\) or as a sum of\n\u201canti-causal\u201d or advanced Green\u2019s functions\nand a solution to a final value problem of the homogenous, source-free\nequation. Both representations are mathematically equivalent\nrepresentations of one and the same state of the system. From this observation the\ntime asymmetry challenge concludes that nothing in the mathematical\nformalism can legitimately distinguish between the different\nrepresentations to single out one representation as the correct causal\nrepresentation. Since interpreting both retarded and advanced\nrepresentations causally is incompatible with the causal asymmetry,\nneither representation ought to be interpreted causally.\n\nWhile the time asymmetry challenge can be raised for the Green\u2019s\nfunction associated with hyperbolic equations, it is worth pointing\nout that there are also theories or theoretical frameworks in physics\nwith time-asymmetric Green\u2019s functions, chiefly among them\nlinear response theory. There is no philosophical\nconsensus on the causal status of the Green\u2019s function\nformalism. Frisch (2009a; 2009b; 2014) argues for a causal\ninterpretation of the Green\u2019s function formalism, both in the\ncase of the time-reversal invariant wave equation and in the case of\nthe explicitly time-asymmetric linear response theory, while Norton\n(2009) and Smith (2013) are critical of causal interpretations of the\nformalism.\n2.5.3 Initial conditions and common cause reasoning\n\nSome authors have challenged premise 5 of the time-asymmetry\nchallenge, according to which only those features that can be grounded\nin physical laws can play a proper role in physics. In effect, this\npremise implies that the proper content of physics is restricted to\nphysical laws, thereby denying that initial, final, or boundary\nconditions are an integral part of the content of physics. One\nmotivation for this restriction might be the thought that initial or\nfinal conditions are contingent \u201cone-off\u201d states, and\nhence should not count as part of the content of physics, which\nconsists of general claims about the physical world: that a billiard\nball was at rest on a specific spot on a billiard table when it was\nstruck by a second ball is not part of physics but the laws of elastic\ncollision are. But this line of thought ignores that initial\nconditions can also have more general features that are shared across\na wide class of conditions. In fact, many physical situations are\ncharacterized by an asymmetry between prevailing initial and final\nconditions, according to which initial conditions are random while\nfinal conditions are not. And this asymmetry arguably is closely\nrelated to a causal asymmetry (Arntzenius 1992; Maudlin 2007).\n\nUnder certain plausible assumptions an initial independence or initial\nrandomness assumption allows us to derive a principle of the common\ncause (first proposed by Hans Reichenbach (1956)), according to which\nspatially distant correlated events A and B that are not\nrelated as cause and effect possess a common cause in their past that\nexplains the correlation and screens off the correlation between\nA and B (Arntzenius 1999 [2010]). That is, formally,\nif \n\n\\[\n\\tag{1}\nP(A \\amp B) > P(A)P(B), \n\\]\n\n\nThen there is some event C in the past of A and B\nthat explains the correlation between A and B and which\nsatisfies: \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\nP(A\\amp B |C) = P(A|C) P(B|C)\n\\]\n\n\nA central feature of common cause reasoning is that it allows\ninferences from local data without full knowledge of the state of the\nworld (or the state of a larger system) on a complete final value\nsurface\u2014states to which we very often do not have full access.\nCommon-cause reasoning not only is a core function of causal\nrepresentations in commonsense contexts but also is a central and\nineliminable inference pattern in physics.\n\nAs a particularly vivid example illustrating common-cause inferences\nfrom very limited knowledge of the state of the universe on a final\nvalue surface consider the detection of gravitational waves in 2016,\nwhich, physicists concluded, were emitted by two colliding black\nholes. If we wanted to derive the black hole event within General\nRelativity from knowledge of the data on a complete final value\nsurface, we would have to know the precise state of the universe in a\nsphere with a diameter of many, many light-years\u2014something that\nis obviously impossible for us to know. Instead researchers inferred\nthe black-hole event from the two signals detected locally in the LIGO\ndetectors in Washington and Louisiana, arguing that the extremely\nstrong correlations between the signals detected at both detectors\nsimultaneously are evidence for the colliding black holes as the\nsignals\u2019 common cause.\n\nImplicit in this causal inference is the assumption that there was no\n\u201ccarefully calibrated\u201d gravitational wave coming in from\npast infinity, converging on the location of the postulated black-hole\nevent, and then re-diverging\u2014thereby mimicking a wave produced\nby two colliding black holes. This alternative explanation of the\nsimultaneously detected signals is ruled out as utterly implausible,\nbecause a source free gravitational field coming in from past infinity\nthat mimicked the field associated with the black hole event would\nhave required absurdly strongly correlated initial conditions in\nremote parts of spacetime. By positing an initial randomness\nassumption such seemingly miraculous correlations are effectively\nexcluded.\n\nNotice, however, that, by contrast with correlations among initial\nconditions, we do not find \u201cabsurdly strongly correlated\u201d\nfinal conditions implausible: indeed, correlated final\nconditions are just what we expect as joint effects of a common cause\nsuch as the collapsing of the black holes.\n\nThe principle of the common cause can be derived within the context of\ndeterministic laws. Yet deterministic laws also appear to undercut the\ntime-asymmetry of common cause inferences. Under determinism, if there\nis an event C in the past of two events A and B\nthat screens A and B off from each other, then there\nwill also be an event C* taking place after A and\nB that occurs exactly if C occurs and that renders the\ntwo events conditionally independent (Arntzenius 1992). In reply to\nthis worry one can argue that future screening-off events, unlike\nthose in the past, will in general be highly non-natural and\nnon-localized (Woodward 2007). Demanding that appropriate physical\nvariables represent localized and not highly gerrymandered events\nallows us to preserve the asymmetry induced by the initial randomness\nassumption.\n\nThere is broad agreement in the literature that our universe is\ncharacterized by an asymmetry between prevailing initial and final\nconditions, yet there is an ongoing debate what precisely this\nasymmetry entails for the status of the causal asymmetry and for the\ntime-asymmetry challenge (see also\n section 5).\n\nWhile some authors suggest that time-asymmetric causal relations might\nbe strictly incompatible with time-reversal invariant dynamical laws,\nit is more promising to try and argue that adding time-asymmetric\ncausal relations to physics cannot be justified within physics. It is\nthis latter claim that an appeal to initial conditions and their role\nin underwriting common cause reasoning is meant to challenge. From the\nperspective of the functional project, the central role of\ncommon-cause reasoning both in commonsense and in physics contexts\nprovides perhaps the strongest argument for the claim that the very\nsame\u2014or at least very closely related\u2014causal concepts are\noperative in common sense causal judgements and in causal reasoning in\nphysics.\n\nWithin the metaphysical project, granting that an asymmetry in initial\nconditions can justify an appeal to causal judgments is compatible\nwith two distinct types of view on the metaphysics of causation. Some\nauthors take the asymmetry between prevailing initial and final\nconditions to be metaphysically primary and maintain that it is this\nasymmetry which grounds our ability to reason causally. Consequently,\non this view, causal relations are metaphysically not on a par with\nnomic relations: while physical laws are nomologically necessary,\ncausal relations are contingent, since the asymmetry between initial\nand final conditions, from which causal relations are derived, is\nmerely a de facto, nomologically contingent asymmetry. This\nview suggests a weaker version of the time-asymmetry argument, which\npoints to the time-reversal invariance of the laws to conclude that\ncausal relations cannot be grounded in the laws but only in a de\nfacto asymmetry between prevailing initial and final conditions.\nThe argument does not deny that causal judgments play a legitimate\nrole in physics but denies that causal relations are metaphysically\nfundamental and affords them a modally weaker status than that of\nphysical laws. That initial conditions are contingent is denied,\nhowever, by Barry Loewer (2007), who argues that the initial\nrandomness assumption comes out as a law according to Lewis\u2019s\nbest system account of laws.\n\nOther authors, by contrast, take the causal asymmetry (rather than the\ninitial randomness assumption) to be primary, and argue that the\ncausal asymmetry can then explain, account for, or ground the\nasymmetry between prevailing initial and final conditions. Thus,\nHausman and Woodward (1999) argue that the reason why the values of\ninitial variables characterizing initial states are uncorrelated is\nthat these variables do not have common causes in their past. The\ncausal asymmetry, on this view, is explanatorily prior to the\nasymmetry between initial and final states. Similarly, Pearl (2009)\nargues against the view that the initial randomness assumption allows\nus to derive the causal asymmetry from a non-causal premise that the\ninitial randomness assumption should itself be thought of as a causal\nassumption. Maudlin (2007: 133) argues that the asymmetry between\ninitial and final conditions is a manifestation of a more fundamental\nnomic asymmetry, which he however characterizes in strongly causal\nterms as an asymmetry of later states being nomically produced by or\ngenerated from earlier states.\n3. Interventionist accounts of causation\n\nThe approaches to causation most widely discussed in the philosophical\nliterature in recent decades have been the Bayes net or structural\nmodel accounts of causation developed by Peter Spirtes and his\nco-authors (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993 [2000]) and by Judea\nPearl (2000; 2009). The account\u2019s formal framework is also at\nthe heart of Woodward\u2019s highly influential interventionist\naccount of causation and explanation (Woodward 2003a).\n\nStructural model accounts propose mathematically rigorous and precise\nrepresentations of causal structures. On Pearl\u2019s account, a\nstructural causal model (SCM) consists of a directed acyclic graph\n(representable in terms of a \u201cblobs-and-arrows\u201d diagram)\nover a set of variables \\(V={X, Y, \\ldots}\\) consisting of\n\nendogenous variables \\(V_i\\) and exogenous variables \\(U_i\\);\nstructural equations \\(x_{i} = f_{i}(pa_{i}, u_{i}),\\) which\nspecify the value of each variable \\(x_{i}\\) in terms of the value of\nthe variable\u2019s causal parents \\(pa_{i}\\) and random exogenous\ndisturbances \\(u_{i}\\); and\na probability distribution \\(P(u_{i})\\) over the values \\(u_{i}\\)\nof the exogenous variables \\(U_{i}\\), which induces a probability\ndistribution over all variables.\n\n\nIt is part of the definition of a structural model that the exogenous\nvariables are probabilistically independent of one another (e.g.,\nPearl 2000: 44). From this together with the assumption that a causal\nmodel is complete one can derive the causal Markov condition,\nwhich is a generalized common cause condition and states that for\nevery variable X in V, X is probabilistically\nindependent of the variables in the set \\((V -\n\\textrm{Descendants}(X))\\) conditional on the parents of X.\n\nThere is a debate in the literature to what extent structural model\naccounts can be applied in physics and what implications these\naccounts have for the role of causation in physics. Frisch\n (2014) proposes that we can\nconstruct causal representations of physical systems by identifying\nthe variables characterizing a system\u2019s initial state with the\nexogenous variables in a causal model and the theory\u2019s\nGreen\u2019s functions with the model\u2019s structural equations\n(see also Lloyd 1996).\n\nOne can then use the machinery of structural models to derive a common\ncause principle from the initial randomness assumption. In particular,\nthe initial randomness assumption can be used to break the symmetry\nbetween the retarded and advanced Green\u2019s functions for\nhyperbolic equations: Causal model constructed with retarded\nGreen\u2019s functions as structural equations satisfy the\nprobabilistic independence assumption required in the structural model\nframework, while putatively causal models constructed with\n\u201canti-causal\u201d or advanced Green\u2019s functions violate\nthe probabilistic independence assumption, since in such models the\nhighly correlated variables characterizing a system\u2019s final\nstate functions as exogenous variables. Thus structural model\naccounts may provide an appropriate framework to support the claim that\ncausal inferences and judgments play an important role in physics.\n\nBy contrast, Pearl (2000) and Woodward (2007) point to an aspect of\nstructural causal models that may make the framework fit less well\nwith at least some aspects of theorizing in physics. Structural causal\nmodels make perspicuous the tight connections between the notions of\ncause and intervention or manipulation. A structural causal model\nprovides us with information on how the values of variables change\nunder external interventions into a system, while causal discovery\nalgorithms allow us to construct causal models from information about\nprobability distributions over the values of variables characterizing\nthe system and information about the effects of interventions. On\nWoodward\u2019s account the notion of causation is spelled out in\nterms of so-called \u201chard\u201d or \u201carrow-breaking\u201d\ninterventions. Arrow-breaking interventions allow us to investigate\nhow changes to a variable V percolate through a system, when we\nplace V under the full control of an intervention variable and\nbreak all other causal arrows into V. Yet arrow-breaking\ninterventions may not be possible within the context of certain\nphysical theories. Newtonian gravitational forces, for example, cannot\nbe turned off.\n In reply to this worry one can argue that interventions into\nphysical systems may be more adequately modeled in term of\n\u201csoft\u201d, non-arrow breaking interventions, as investigated\nin Eberhardt and Scheines (2007). What the comparative merits of\ncharacterizing causal structures in terms of \u201chard\u201d or\n\u201csoft\u201d interventions are, is the subject of an ongoing\ndebate.\n\nPearl (2000) also argues that any account of causation that closely\nlinks causal notions and the notion of interventions cannot be applied\nin the context of a truly fundamental physics that includes models of\nthe universe as a whole. The reason is that global models of the\nuniverse as a whole do not have an \u201coutside\u201d that could be\nrepresented by an intervention variable and from which an intervention\ninto the universe could take place. Yet Pearl\u2019s own do-calculus\nfirst introduces interventions formally in a way that does not posit\nintervention variables external to the causal model of interest.\nNonetheless, interventions into the universe as a whole are not\nphysically possible. Here the question concerning interventions in\nfundamental physics makes contact with another issue on which there is\nan active debate: the question on appropriate constraints on allowable\ninterventions and the question to what extent interventions need to be\nphysically or conceptually possible.\n\nTaking a somewhat broader view, the worry concerning global models\narises from a conception of physics that is widely held by\nphilosophers\u2014a conception according to which one of the\nfundamental aims of physics is to present us with global dynamical\nmodels of the dynamical laws that adequately represent the universe as\na whole. The worry then is that causal models, in particular on an\ninterventionist conception of cause, cannot get a foothold within such\na globalist conception of physics. This globalist conception can be\ncontrasted with one according to which the laws of physics are\nunderstood as rules governing localized subsystems of the universe\n(Ismael 2016; see also Cartwright 1999). Defenders of the latter\nconception would argue not only that it can more easily accommodate\ncausal reasoning than the globalist picture but also that it fits the\nday-to-day practice of most of physics considerably better than the\nglobalist conception.\n4. Conserved Quantity Accounts of Causation\n\nConserved quantity accounts of causation are reductive accounts of\ncausation that are explicitly designed to locate causation within the\nrealm of physics avoiding the vagueness challenge. Most\nprominent here is the causal process account first proposed by Wesley\nSalmon (1984) and developed further in Phil Dowe\u2019s conserved\nquantity account (Dowe 2000; see also Kistler 1999 [2006]). Proponents\nof conserved quantity accounts take their accounts to contribute to\nthe metaphysical project of determining objective causal structures\nthat serve as truth-makers of causal claims.\n\nDowe distinguishes causal processes and causal interactions, which he\ndefines as follows:\n\nCQ1.\n A causal process is a world line of an object that possesses a\nconserved quantity.\nCQ2.\n A causal interaction is an intersection of world lines that\ninvolves exchange of a conserved quantity. (Dowe 2000: 90)\n\n\nConserved quantities are those quantities, such as energy, momentum,\nmass, or charge, that are conserved according to our physical\ntheories. By deriving its inspiration from physics, where conservation\nlaws play a central role, conserved quantity accounts promise to be\nable to meet the neo-Machian and neo-Russellian challenges. In fact,\nsince, according to Noether\u2019s First Theorem, there is a\nconservation law associated with each continuous symmetry property of\na system, there seems to be a clear formal route for locating causal\nclaims within physics.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how broadly applicable Dowe\u2019s account\nis. Classical electrodynamics satisfies energy-momentum conservation.\nYet while charged particles are associated with world lines, the\nelectromagnetic field, with which charged particles interacts, cannot\nbe associated with a world line along which energy is conserved. As\nMarc Lange (2002) has argued, it is problematic to think of the\nelectromagnetic field energy as a kind of \u201cstuff\u201d that\nflows in a uniquely identifiable manner among different field-regions.\nThus, Dowe\u2019s conserved quantity account appears to be designed\nfor an ontology of discrete objects and it is unclear how the account\nmight be extended to cover field theories as well.\n\nWhile conserved quantity accounts offer an analysis of the notion of\nbeing causally related, they do not, on their own, provide a\ndistinction between cause and effect. To introduce the direction of\nthe causal relation, Dowe supplements his conserved quantity account\nby appealing to Reichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry (1956).\nReichenbach distinguishes forks that are temporally open from forks\nthat are closed. If there is an event C occurring in past that\nscreens off A from B, but there is no screening-off\nevent in the future of A and B, then this constitutes an\nopen fork. If there is an event C in the past and in addition\nan event \\(C'\\) in the future of A and B that screen off\nA from B, we have a closed fork. Now,\nReichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry thesis consists in the claim that\nall open forks are open toward the future. Dowe (2000: 204) defines\nthe direction of causal processes by the direction of the majority of\nopen forks (thereby, in principle, allowing for the possibility of\nbackward causation). \n\nThus, in order to define the direction of causation, the conserved\nquantity accounts need to be supplemented by probabilistic\ninformation. It has also been argued that conserved quantity accounts\ncannot adequately distinguish those features of a process that are\nexplanatorily relevant from those that are not without relying on\ncounterfactuals (Woodward 2003b [2019]). Earman (2014) argues that the\nmost appropriate way to characterize causal processes is in terms of\nsystems governed by equations that allow for a well-posed initial\nvalue formulation, which are systems governed by hyperbolic equations\n(see also Woodward 2016).\n5. Causation and Entropy\n\nSeveral authors have argued that the causal asymmetry and the\ndirection of causation are closely related to the thermodynamic\nasymmetry that the entropy of a closed system does not decrease. An\nearly discussion of possible connection between the two\n\u201ctemporal arrows\u201d occurs in Reichenbach (1956). More\nrecent discussions of connections between the two arrows argue more\nperspicuously that the thermodynamic and the time-asymmetry of\ncausation have as their common origin the initial randomness\nassumption or the assumption of initial microscopic chaos. The\nassumption of initial microscopic chaos is a central assumption in\nneo-Boltzmannian accounts of the thermodynamic asymmetry. These\naccounts posit a cosmological hypothesis, according to which the\nuniverse began its life in an extremely low entropy state \\(M(0),\\)\nwhich Richard Feynman has dubbed the Past Hypothesis (1965),\ntogether with an equiprobability distribution over all microstates\ncompatible with \\(M(0).\\) David Albert and Barry Loewer argue that the\npackage consisting of past hypothesis, probability postulate, and the\ndynamical laws on the microlevel\u2014a package they call the\nMentaculus after the Coen Brother\u2019s movie A Serious\nMan\u2014not only can account for the thermodynamic asymmetry\nbut also provides the probabilities for every macroscopic\ngeneralization as well as the machinery to ground the causal asymmetry\nand epistemic asymmetries concerning our access to past and future\nevents (Albert 2000, 2015; Loewer 2007, 2012).\n\nWhile on Albert and Loewer\u2019s account the causal asymmetry is\nultimately grounded in the probability postulate, they attempt to\nderive this asymmetry via a somewhat circuitous route. The first step\nis to argue that the Mentaculus implies a branching tree structure\ntoward the future on the macrolevel, according to which the\nuniverse\u2019s macrostate at a time is compatible with many more\ndifferent macro-evolutions toward the future than macro-evolutions\ntoward the past. In a second step they argue that this branching tree\nstructure underwrites an asymmetry of counterfactual dependence on the\nmacro-level and thereby supports a broadly Lewisian counterfactual\nanalysis of the temporal arrow of causation. The claim that the\nMentaculus implies a temporally asymmetric branching tree structure of\nthe kind postulated by Loewer is criticized in Frisch (2010): since\nfuture higher entropy macro states occupy vastly larger regions of\nphase space than lower entropy past states, thermodynamically normal\nevolutions, if anything, suggest an upside-down tree\n structure.\n\nOther authors have proposed more direct arguments for deriving the\ncausal asymmetry from assumptions made in the foundations of\nthermodynamics, than the one developed by Albert and Loewer, arguing\nthat we can derive the common cause principle and thereby the\ndirection of causation directly from the assumption of initial\nprobabilistic independence. For a large class of microscopic\nconditions the probabilistic independence assumption follows from the\nassumption of initial microscopic chaos (Horwich 1987; Papineau\n1985). In particular, as Arntzenius argues, the probabilistic\nindependence assumption will be satisfied for spatially separated\nmicrostates if we assume initial microscopic chaos (Arntzenius 1999\n[2010]). There is also an active debate in the literature on how the\ncausal and thermodynamic asymmetries relate to various epistemic\nasymmetries, such as an asymmetry of records or an asymmetry\nconcerning our epistemic access to the past and to the future. For\ndifferent accounts of the knowledge asymmetry and an asymmetry of\nrecords see Horwich 1987; Albert 2000, 2015; Loewer 2007; Frisch 2007,\n2014; and Ismael 2016.\n\nMost authors exploring the connection between the thermodynamic and\ncausal asymmetries argue that the causal asymmetry is ultimately\ngrounded in some facts about the initial state of the universe. Some\nauthors, however, have argued that the explanatory direction is\nreversed and that the causal asymmetry accounts for the asymmetry\nbetween prevailing initial and final conditions. Maudlin has argued\nthat the difference between initial and final conditions is a\nreflection of causal laws that, he maintains, underwrite the passage\nof time (Maudlin 2007: 131). \n6. Causation and Radiation\n\nElectromagnetic radiation phenomena exhibit a temporal asymmetry: we\nobserve radiation coherently diverging from a radiating source, such\nthe light emitted by a star, but we do not observe radiation\ncoherently converging into a source, unless we delicately set up such\na system. What can explain this asymmetry? And how is the asymmetry\nrelated to the causal asymmetry, on the one hand, and the\nthermodynamic asymmetry, on the other? Debates on these questions have\na long history. On one side we find both physicists and philosophers\nwho maintain\u2014in the case of physicists sometimes more, sometimes\nless explicitly\u2014that the \u201carrow of radiation\u201d is a\nmanifestation of a causal asymmetry (Ritz 1908; Einstein 1909a;\nJackson 1999; Griffiths 2017; Rohrlich 2006; Frisch 2005; 2006;\n2014). On the other side, there are physicists and philosophers who\nmaintain that the arrow of radiation has the same root as the\nthermodynamic arrow, an asymmetry between prevailing initial and final\nconditions (Einstein 1909b; Wheeler & Feynman 1945; Price 1997;\n2006; North 2003; Zeh 2007; Earman \n2011).[5]\n\nThis debate is far from settled. The laws of classical\nelectrodynamics, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations, imply a wave equation,\nwhich is a time-reversal invariant hyperbolic equation of motion and\nis standardly solved using the Green\u2019s functions formalism.\nThus, the disagreement is partly a disagreement over the question\nwhether the radiation field\u2019s causal or retarded Green\u2019s\nfunction captures important features of how charged particles and\nelectromagnetic fields interact that are not properly captured by the\n\u201canti-causal\u201d or advanced Green\u2019s functions.\n\nSome authors argue that the asymmetry of radiation is, like the\nthermodynamic asymmetry purely a macroscopic phenomenon (Price 1997;\nField 2003). But this claim is not borne out by how physicists treat\ninteractions between charges and fields. To the extent that\nmicroscopic charged particles can be (and in fact are) modeled\nclassically, their interactions with fields are modeled as exhibiting\ntemporal asymmetries just as macroscopic field sources do (Jackson\n1999). These asymmetries include the fact that accelerating\nmicroscopic charged particles are damped (since they radiate off part\nof the energy they receive), rather than being anti-damped (extracting\nadditional energy from the surrounding field) (Rohrlich 2007). Thus, whatever the correct account of the\nasymmetry of radiation is, it has to apply to microscopic charged\nparticles as well as to macroscopic collections of charges.\n\nAuthors who try to derive the radiation arrow from probabilistic\nconsiderations sometimes argue that coherently converging waves do not\noccur because such waves would require a radically improbable\ncoordinated behavior of incoming waves (Earman 2011; see also Atkinson\n2006). But this line of argument is in danger of committing what Price\nhas called \u201cthe temporal double-standard fallacy\u201d (Price\n1997). From an acausal perspective the coordinated behavior of\noutgoing waves in the future of a radiating source should appear to be\nno less improbable than coordinated behavior of incoming waves in the\npast of the source. Thus, probabilistic accounts that deny a\nfundamental causal asymmetry need to be careful to avoid probabilistic\narguments for the asymmetry ultimately driven by causal intuitions and\npresumably have to be content with positing the initial randomness\nassumption as a fundamental de facto asymmetry that cannot be\nfurther justified.\n\nIt is important here, too, to be clear on what is at stake in the\ndebate. Within the metaphysical project, the debate concerns the\nquestion what the fundamental grounds for the asymmetry of radiation\nphenomena are: is the asymmetry an expression of a fundamental causal\nasymmetry or is it due to an asymmetry between prevailing initial and\nfinal conditions?\n\nFrom the perspective of a purely functional project, by contrast,\nthere is less disagreement between these two views than it may\ninitially seem. From a functionalist perspective, defenders of a\ncausal picture and defenders of a probabilistic account can be\nunderstood as emphasizing two different aspects that both are integral\nfeatures of causal models: an initial independence assumption and\ndirected causal relationships among variables. Thus, certain\ncriticisms of causal accounts of the asymmetry of radiation, such as\nEarman (2011), are most charitably understood as attacking a\nmetaphysical account of the role of causation in accounting for\nradiation phenomena. Earman\u2019s criticism cannot undermine a\nfunctional account of causation in physics, since it invokes the very\nsame probabilistic considerations that, on a functional account,\nunderwrite representing radiation phenomena in terms of causal\nmodels.\n7. Causation and Quantum Mechanics\n\nIt is often argued that quantum mechanics is particularly inhospitable\nto causal notions. Early discussions of a putative tension between\ncausal notions and quantum mechanics focused mainly on the\nindeterminism of quantum mechanics. More recent discussions by\ncontrast, focus on the problem that nonlocal quantum correlations\nviolate Bell inequalities as presenting a challenge to causal\nanalyses. In a standard setup of a Bell-type experiment one considers\ntwo observers who perform experiments in two spatially separated\nlaboratories on two entangled subsystems. The two experiments are\nperformed independently but can have outcomes that can be correlated\nin ways that are not readily accounted for by classical causal models.\nThere are different strategies for deriving Bell inequalities.\nParticularly helpful analyses for the status of various causal\nassumptions are developed in Wiseman and Cavalcanti (2017) and Wood\nand Spekkens (2015), who examine how to apply Pearl\u2019s structural\ncausal models to Bell experiments (Myrvold, Genovese, & Shimony\n2019). Simplifying somewhat, Wiseman and Cavalcanti assume that Bell\nexperiments take place in Minkowski spacetime and have real outcomes\nthat are not relative to anything. They then show that the quantum\ncorrelations predicted for Bell experiments conflict with the\nconjunction of three postulates: relativistic causality,\naccording to which an event\u2019s causal past is its past lightcone;\nfree choice, which states that measurement settings can be\nfreely chosen and, hence, have no causes within the system under\nconsideration; and Reichenbach\u2019s principle of a common\ncause, according to which correlations among events that are not\nrelated as cause and effect are explained by a common cause in their\njoint past that screens off the correlation.\n\nIf we want to accept the quantum mechanical predictions, which appear\nto be empirically well-confirmed, we have to reject at least one of\nthe postulates. Rejecting free choice amounts to accepting\nsuperdeterminism, according to which measurement settings cannot be\nfreely chosen. Alternatively, we can give up relativistic\ncausality, either by allowing for superluminal influences from\nthe outcomes at one wing on that at the other wing, or by positing\nretro-causal relations, which allow measurement outcomes to influence\nthe earlier state of the source (see, e.g., Price 2012; and references\nin Friederich & Evans 2019).\n\nWhile these strategies allow us to retain Reichenbach\u2019s\nprinciple that correlations among non-causally related events are\nexplained by a common cause that screens off these correlations, they\ncome at a price and, as Wood and Spekkens (2015) show, violate a\ncondition that goes by the names of faithfulness (Spirtes,\nGlymour, & Scheines 1993 [2000: 35]), stability (Pearl\n2009: 49), or no-fine-tuning and which states that every\ncausal dependence implies a probabilistic dependence. Wood and\nSpekkens show that faithfulness, the causal Markov condition, and the\nassumptions that the quantum predictions are correct form an\ninconsistent set. Thus, at least one of the two\nconditions\u2014faithfulness or the Markov condition\u2014has to be\ngiven up.\n\nWhat speaks for retaining faithfulness is that it is a central\nassumption in many causal discovery algorithms. Yet there are also\narguments suggesting that faithfulness cannot be a necessary condition\non causal models (Cartwright 2001). Paradigmatic cases of violations\nof faithfulness involve cancelations among different causal paths, as\nthey occur in feedback-control structures. For example, ambient\ntemperature is causally relevant to human body temperature, even\nthough body temperature is probabilistically independent of ambient\ntemperature over a wide range of ambient temperatures, since the human\nbody responds to changes in ambient temperatures through various\nmechanisms along different causal routes, which are fine-tuned in a\nway that allow the body to maintain a constant core temperature. Thus,\nfaithfulness arguably is not a necessary condition for causal\nmodels.\n\nOne might reply, however, that canceling path violations of\nfaithfulness result from a system\u2019s specific causal structure:\nthe causal structures at issue appear to be designed precisely to\nallow for what amounts to violations of faithfulness. By contrast,\nWood and Spekkens show that if we hold on to the Markov condition,\nthen violations of faithfulness have to be a generic feature of\nquantum causal systems that violate the Bell inequalities. It is\nunclear, whether a plausible account of such generic violations of\nfaithfulness in quantum systems involving cancelling paths can be\ngiven. N\u00e4ger (2016) explores several alternative ways in which\nfaithfulness might be violated in quantum causal systems. By contrast,\nGlymour (2006) argues that instead of giving up faithfulness, we ought\nto reject the Markov condition in quantum contexts.\n\nAnother response to the problem of embedding correlations among\noutcomes in a causal structure has been to assume a type of holism\nwhich prohibits treating the spatially separated parts of the\nentangled system as distinct subsystems. The suggestion is instead to\nthink of the measurement results at the two wings of the experiment as\n\u201ca single indivisible non-local event\u201d (Skyrms 1984).\nHausman and Woodward (1999) argue that it also follows from an\ninterventionist analysis that the measurement outcomes at the two\nwings of the experiment ought to be treated as a single non-local\nevent. How to causally model entangled states remains a debated\nquestion.\n\nOne might want to conclude from the fact that quantum correlations are\nincompatible with the conjunction of faithfulness and the Markov\ncondition that causal notions are inapplicable in the quantum realm.\nYet we can experimentally interact with quantum systems and can\nintervene in and control such systems in ways that appear to be causal\nin similar ways to our interactions with classical physical systems.\nMoreover, as Sally Shrapnel (2014) has argued, there are macroscopic\nphenomena, such as the avian magneto-compass, that seem to require\nmulti-level explanations that include quantum causal effects, which\nplay an apparently causal, difference-making role. Efforts, such as\nWood and Spekkens (2015) to try to develop causal representations of\nour interactions with quantum systems have led to the emergence of a\nresearch field devoted to extending the framework of structural causal\nmodels to quantum mechanics and to develop quantum causal models\n(Costa & Shrapnel 2016; Allen et al. 2017; Shrapnel 2019). From\nthe perspective of the three philosophical projects we distinguished\nabove, these efforts are most naturally seen as engaging in the\nfunctional project of developing (and de novo engineering)\ncausal concepts appropriate for the quantum realm and showing how such\nconcepts can play a useful role in explanations and in capturing the\nways in which we can manipulate and control quantum systems.\n8. Causal Explanation\n\nThe philosophical literature on causal explanation in general and in\nphysics, more specifically, has developed largely independently of,\nand without engaging with, philosophical discussions in the\nneo-Russellian tradition questioning the legitimacy of causal concepts\nin physics (with Woodward\u2019s work being a notable exception). In\nfact, while neo-Russellian arguments have attracted renewed attention\nsince the turn of the twenty-first century and continue to be widely\nendorsed, causal or causal-mechanical theories of explanation, which\nwere developed in response to problems faced by the\ndeductive-nomological model of scientific explanation developed by\nCarl Hempel (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948), arguably have become the\ndefault view in the philosophical literature on scientific explanation\n(Woodward 2003b [2019]). In fact, one central recent debate within\nthis literature takes for granted that there are causal explanations\nand then discusses whether all scientific explanations are\ncausal (Lewis 1986; Skow 2014) or whether there is room for genuinely\nnon-causal scientific explanations as well (Lange 2016).\n\nEarlier defenders of causal accounts of explanation took one\ndistinguishing feature of causal accounts to be their metaphysical,\nor\u2014as Alberto Coffa called it\u2014ontic conception of\nexplanation. The goal of explanation, on this conception is to locate\na phenomenon within the objective \u201ccausal nexus\u201d (Salmon\n1984: 120). Yet as Woodward\u2019s (2003a) work shows, is that it\nalso possible to investigate the relation between explanation and\ncausation within the functional project of examining the cognitive\nrole of explanatory and causal judgments and their connection to\nprediction, manipulation, and control.\n\nCausal imperialists, as we might call them, argue that all\nscientific explanations are fundamentally causal. Neo-Russellians, by\ncontrast, deny that causal notions and causal explanation can play any\nrole in suitably fundamental theories of physics. Yet, despite their\nstark disagreement, neo-Russellians and causal imperialists share a\ncommitment to what Woodward has called \u201cthe hidden structure\nstrategy\u201d (Woodward 2003b [2019]). Both views are committed to\nthe existence of what Peter Railton has called an \u201cideal\nexplanatory text\u201d (Railton 1981) that contains all the\ninformation relevant to a complete explanation of some phenomenon.\nWhile actual explanations may fall short of providing us with the\ncomplete information contained in the ideal explanatory text, they are\nexplanatory, according to the hidden structure strategy, in virtue of\nproviding us with some information about the text.\n\nFor the neo-Russellian, the fundamental explanatory structures consist\nof microphysically complete dynamical models of the backward lightcone\nof a given explanandum. While the neo-Russellian view is\ncompatible with the claim that in some non-fundamental domains and for\npragmatic reasons information about the ideal explanatory text may\nfruitfully be presented in causal terms, the view holds that ideal\nphysical explanations are not causal. Causal imperialism turns this\npicture on its head: for Lewis and others the underlying ideal\nexplanatory structures are causal structures. Hence all explanations\nare causal in virtue of the fact that they provide information about\nthis structure, even though the information provided in an actual\nexplanation may not be presented in causal terms.\n\nAs Woodward (2003b [2019]) has argued, a problem for the hidden\nstructure strategy is to explain how hidden structures that are\nepistemically inaccessible to us can account for the explanatory\nimport of the explanatory accounts we give. For the neo-Russellian the\nproblem is that we seem to be able to provide successful causal\nexplanations of phenomena even when the complete initial data that are\npart of the ideal explanatory text are in principle inaccessible to\nus. The causal imperialist\u2019s version of the hidden structure\nstrategy faces an analogous problem. There are apparently successful\nexplanations of phenomena that do not identify causes of the\nphenomenon.\n\nConsider for example an explanation of the heat capacity of metals\nand, in particular, of the fact that the heat capacity is much lower\nthan predicted classically (Kittel 2005: 141ff). The explanation\nappeals to the Pauli exclusion principle and shows how the heat\ncapacity depends on particle statistics. In order to get the correct\nresult for the heat capacity, we need to model free electrons in the\nmetal as satisfying the quantum-mechanical Fermi-Dirac statistics and\nthe exclusion principle. The explanation appeals to the structure of\nthe phase-space available to the electrons.\n\nAccording to causal imperialists, such as Lewis, this explanation is\ncausal by virtue of the fact that it provides information about the\ncausal history of a sample of metal. Does this construal of the\nexplanation as pointing to a hidden causal structure allow us to make\nperspicuous its explanatory import? As we have seen, Pearl\u2019s and\nWoodward\u2019s accounts of causation emphasize two features as\ncharacteristic functions of causal notions. First, knowledge of causal\nstructures allows us to identify relationships amenable to\nmanipulation and control; and second, common cause reasoning enables\nus to draw inferences from one time to another even when we possess\nonly incomplete knowledge of the state of a system on an initial or\nfinal value surface.\n\nNow, the explanation of the heat capacity embeds its\nexplanandum into patterns of functional dependencies and\nallows us to answer how the heat capacity would change if the\navailable phase space were different. That is, the explanation does\nenable us to answer what Woodward calls\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions (Woodward 1979),\nwhich, according to Woodward\u2019s account of explanation is an\nimportant feature of causal explanations. Yet the counterfactuals at\nissue cannot be interpreted in terms of interventions or manipulations\non the electron states. Indeed, the fact that the value of the heat\ncapacity of metals follows from structural features of the\nelectrons\u2019 phase space and is not something that, even in\nprinciple, is open to manipulation or control arguably is itself\nexplanatorily relevant. Thus, one might worry that by classifying\nexplanations such as this as causal the causal imperialist obliterates\nwhat is an important distinction between different explanatory\nfunctions and epistemic goals.",
