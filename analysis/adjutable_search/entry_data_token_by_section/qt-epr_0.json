    "main_text": "Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? || Setting and prehistory\n1.1 Setting and prehistory\n\nBy 1935 conceptual understanding of the quantum theory was dominated\nby Niels Bohr\u2019s ideas concerning complementarity. Those ideas centered\non observation and measurement in the quantum domain. According to\nBohr\u2019s views at that time, observing a quantum object involves an\nuncontrollable physical interaction with a measuring device that\naffects both systems. The picture here is of a tiny object banging\ninto a big apparatus. The effect this produces on the measuring\ninstrument is what issues in the measurement \u201cresult\u201d\nwhich, because it is uncontrollable, can only be predicted\nstatistically. The effect experienced by the quantum object limits\nwhat other quantities can be co-measured with precision. According to\ncomplementarity when we observe the position of an object, we affect\nits momentum uncontrollably. Thus we cannot determine both position\nand momentum precisely. A similar situation arises for the\nsimultaneous determination of energy and time. Thus complementarity\ninvolves a doctrine of uncontrollable physical interaction that,\naccording to Bohr, underwrites the Heisenberg uncertainty relations\nand is also the source of the statistical character of the quantum\ntheory. (See the entries on the\n Copenhagen Interpretation\n and the\n Uncertainty Principle.)\n\nInitially Einstein was enthusiastic about the quantum theory. By 1935,\nhowever, while recognizing the theory\u2019s significant achievements, his\nenthusiasm had given way to disappointment. His reservations were\ntwofold. Firstly, he felt the theory had abdicated the historical task\nof natural science to provide knowledge of significant aspects of\nnature that are independent of observers or their observations.\nInstead the fundamental understanding of the quantum wave function\n(alternatively, the \u201cstate function\u201d, \u201cstate\nvector\u201d, or \u201cpsi-function\u201d) was that it only treated\nthe outcomes of measurements (via probabilities given by the Born\nRule). The theory was simply silent about what, if anything, was\nlikely to be true in the absence of observation. That there could be\nlaws, even probabilistic laws, for finding things if one looks, but no\nlaws of any sort for how things are independently of whether one\nlooks, marked quantum theory as irrealist. Secondly, the quantum\ntheory was essentially statistical. The probabilities built into the\nstate function were fundamental and, unlike the situation in classical\nstatistical mechanics, they were not understood as arising from\nignorance of fine details. In this sense the theory was\nindeterministic. Thus Einstein began to probe how strongly the quantum\ntheory was tied to irrealism and indeterminism.\n\nHe wondered whether it was possible, at least in principle, to ascribe\ncertain properties to a quantum system in the absence of measurement.\nCan we suppose, for instance, that the decay of an atom occurs at a\ndefinite moment in time even though such a definite decay time is not\nimplied by the quantum state function? That is, Einstein began to ask\nwhether the formalism provides a description of quantum systems that\nis complete. Can all physically relevant truths about systems be\nderived from quantum states? One can raise a similar question about a\nlogical formalism: are all logical truths (or semantically valid\nformulas) derivable from the axioms. Completeness, in this sense, was\na central focus for the G\u00f6ttingen school of mathematical logic\nassociated with David Hilbert. (See entry on\n  Hilbert\u2019s Program.)\n Werner Heisenberg, who had attended Hilbert\u2019s lectures, picked up\nthose concerns with questions about the completeness of his own,\nmatrix approach to quantum mechanics. In response, Bohr (and others\nsympathetic to complementarity) made bold claims not just for the\ndescriptive adequacy of the quantum theory but also for its\n\u201cfinality\u201d, claims that enshrined the features of\nirrealism and indeterminism that worried Einstein. (See Beller 1999,\nChapters 4 and 9, on the rhetoric of finality and Ryckman 2017,\nChapter 4, for the connection to Hilbert.) Thus complementarity became\nEinstein\u2019s target for investigation. In particular, Einstein had\nreservations about the uncontrollable physical effects invoked by Bohr\nin the context of measurement interactions, and about their role in\nfixing the interpretation of the wave function. EPR\u2019s focus on\ncompleteness was intended to support those reservations in a\nparticularly dramatic way. \n\nMax Jammer (1974, pp. 166\u2013181) locates the development of the\nEPR paper in Einstein\u2019s reflections on a thought experiment he\nproposed during discussions at the 1930 Solvay conference. (For more\non EPR and Solvay 1930 see Howard, 1990 and Ryckman, 2017, pp.\n118\u2013135.) The experiment imagines a box that contains a clock\nset to time precisely the release (in the box) of a photon with\ndeterminate energy. If this were feasible, it would appear to\nchallenge the unrestricted validity of the Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelation that sets a lower bound on the simultaneous uncertainty of\nenergy and time. (See the entry on the\n Uncertainty Principle\n and also Bohr 1949, who describes the discussions at the 1930\nconference.) The uncertainty relations, understood not just as a\nprohibition on what is co-measurable, but on what is simultaneously\nreal, were a central component in the irrealist interpretation of the\nwave function. Jammer (1974, p. 173) describes how Einstein\u2019s thinking\nabout this experiment, and Bohr\u2019s objections to it, evolved into a\ndifferent photon-in-a-box experiment, one that allows an observer to\ndetermine either the momentum or the position of the photon\nindirectly, while remaining outside, sitting on the box. Jammer\nassociates this with the distant determination of either momentum or\nposition that, we shall see, is at the heart of the EPR paper. Carsten\nHeld (1998) cites a related\n correspondence with Paul Ehrenfest\n from 1932 in which Einstein described an arrangement for the indirect\nmeasurement of a particle of mass m using correlations with a\nphoton established through Compton scattering. Einstein\u2019s reflections\nhere foreshadow the argument of EPR, along with noting some of its\ndifficulties.\n\nThus without an experiment on m it is possible to predict\nfreely, at will, either the momentum or the position\nof m with, in principle, arbitrary precision. This is the\nreason why I feel compelled to ascribe objective reality to\nboth. I grant, however, that it is not logically necessary.\n(Held 1998, p. 90)\n\n\nWhatever their precursors, the ideas that found their way into EPR\nwere discussed in a series of meetings between Einstein and his two\nassistants, Podolsky and Rosen. Podolsky was commissioned to compose\nthe paper and he submitted it to Physical Review in March of\n1935, where it was sent for publication the day after it arrived.\nApparently Einstein never checked Podolsky\u2019s draft before submission.\nHe was not pleased with the result. Upon seeing the published version,\nEinstein complained that it obscured his central concerns.\n\nFor reasons of language this [paper] was written by Podolsky after\nseveral discussions. Still, it did not come out as well as I had\noriginally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak,\nsmothered by formalism [Gelehrsamkeit]. (Letter from Einstein to Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger, June 19, 1935. In Fine 1996, p. 35.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, without attending to Einstein\u2019s reservations, EPR is\noften cited to evoke the authority of Einstein. Here we will\ndistinguish the argument Podolsky laid out in the text from lines of\nargument that Einstein himself published in articles from 1935 on. We\nwill also consider the argument presented in Bohr\u2019s reply to EPR,\nwhich is possibly the best known version, although it differs from the\nothers in important ways.\n",
