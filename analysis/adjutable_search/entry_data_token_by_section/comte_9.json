Positivism transformed science into\nphilosophy; complete positivism now transforms philosophy\ninto religion. The question whether such a move is consistent with\nComte\u2019s former ideas and more generally with positivism was\nasked very early. Mill and Littr\u00e9 answered negatively and\ncomplete positivism was never very popular.\n\nThe transformation of philosophy into religion does not yield a\nreligion of science because, having overcome modern prejudices, Comte\nnow unhesitatingly ranks art above science. Now that the break-up with\nthe academic world was complete, the positivists placed their hopes on\nan alliance with women and proletarians. Comte (who after\nClotilde\u2019s death obsessively, even cultishly, devoted himself to\nher) reserved a decisive role in the positive era for women (Labreure\n2020). However, this aspect of his work is difficult to accept for a\ncontemporary reader, in particular because it involves the utopian\nidea of the virgin mother, which means parthenogenesis for human\nbeings. As for the proletarians, he saw them as spontaneous\npositivists, just as the positivists were systematic proletarians!\n\nThe mind, then, is not destined to rule but to serve, not, however, as\nthe slave of the heart, but as its servant (Bourdeau 2000). Science\nthus retains an essential function. The dominance of the heart is\nfounded biologically in the \u2018positive classification of the\neighteen internal functions of the brain, or systematic view of the\nsoul\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1, 594\u201395). The cerebral\ntable distinguishes ten affective forces, five intellectual functions,\nand three practical qualities; these correspond to the heart, mind,\nand character, respectively. The functions being ordered according to\nincreasing energy and decreasing dignity, the dominance of the heart\ncan be considered a datum from positive biology. This classification\nis indispensable for an understanding of the System. It\nshould be mentioned in passing that it shows that the exclusion of\npsychology does not at all have the meaning usually given to it: Comte\nhad never refused to study man\u2019s higher functions, be they\nintellectual or moral, but for him this belongs to biology (the\nclassification is sometimes also referred to as the \u2018cerebral\ntable\u2019), and so does not require the creation of a new science\n(1830 (45)). Historically, the conception of the System began\nwith this table, of which different versions were elaborated in\nsuccession from 1846. Conceptually, it is the first application of the\nsubjective method, understood as feedback from sociology to the\nsciences that precede it, starting with the nearest. In this way, the\nsociologist helps the biologist define the cerebral functions, a task\nin which, most often, the biologist simply takes up again the\ndivisions of folk psychology. Later, in what has become known as the\n\u2018letters on illness\u2019, Comte likewise proposes a\nsociological definition of the brain, as the organ through which dead\npeople act on living ones.\n5.2 Positive Politics\n\nToday, we no longer associate positivism with politics. However, the\nconnection was present from the outset when Comte served as secretary\nof Saint-Simon, and positive politics was quite influential at the end\nof the nineteenth century. The two main tenets of positive politics\nare: there is no society without government; the proper functioning of\nsociety requires a spiritual power independent from the temporal\npower.\n\nThe first principle has two sides. The negative side expresses\nComte\u2019s lack of interest in the concept of State. The positive\nside argues we must consider how social life works in order to\nunderstand why there must be a government. Surprisingly, Comte\u2019s\nstarting point is the same as Hayek\u2019s, namely the existence of a\nspontaneous order. The title of the fiftieth lesson of the\nCourse reads: Social statics, or theory of spontaneous\norder of human society. But, for positivism, spontaneous order\ncovers all natural phenomena and is neither perfect nor immutable. In\ngeneral, human action aims to substitute natural order with an\nartificial one more in line with our desires. Government action is\nonly a special case, applied to the spontaneous order intrinsic to\nhuman society, which is determined by division of labor. Increasing\nspecialization, which accompanies division of labor, threatens the\ncohesion of society even if it is the sine qua non condition of\nprogress. That is why a government is needed: its function is\n\u2018to check the disorganizing and to foster the converging\ntendencies\u2019 of the agents (1852, 205; E. 277).\n\nRegarding the second principle: a spiritual power can only be\nunderstood in its relation to temporal power. A spiritual power, by\nnature, is a moderating power, and it presupposes the existence of a\ntemporal power, which in contrast does not presuppose the existence of\na spiritual power. Furthermore, Comte strongly disagrees with\nhistorical materialism: it is ideas that rule the world, in the sense\nthat there is no sustainable social order without a minimal consensus\non the principles that govern life in society. Initially, Comte\nplanned to entrust this new spiritual power to scientists, because he\nsaw science not only as the rational basis for our action upon nature,\nbut also as the spiritual basis of social order.\n\nFor at least the last 50 years, positive politics has been unfavorably\nviewed as reactionary and totalitarian. And it is true that, in many\nrespects, Comte was resolutely anti-modern but, especially in his\nlater writings, he also held ideas which are in keeping with\ncontemporary concerns. For instance, he had an acute feeling for the\nway humanity is dependent on astronomical conditions: assume small\nchanges in the elliptical orbit of Earth, in the inclination of\nEcliptic, and life, at least life as we know it, would have been\nimpossible. Humanity, the proper study of sociology, is closely\nconnected to the Earth, the human planet, \u2018with its gaseous and\nliquid envelopes\u2019 (Comte 1851 [1875], 429). In spite of the\nCopernican revolution, Earth remains for each of us the firm,\nunshakable ground upon which everything stands. See for instance what\nComte says about fatherland and the way \u2018the Tent, the Car or\nthe Ship are to the nomad family a sort of moveable Country,\nconnecting the Family or the Horde with its material basis, as with us\nthe [Roma] in his van\u2019 (1851, v. 2 285, E. 2 237). Politics is\ngrounded in geopolitics, where geo retains its etymological\nmeaning, Gaia, and where Earth is understood as a planet in\nthe solar system.\n\nThis cosmic character of positive politics helps to understand what\ncould appear as an inconsistency. After 1851, Comte proposed to divide\nFrance into nineteen \u2018intendances\u2019. Such a suggestion is\nquite puzzling since it is incompatible with the received view that he\nwas a supporter of centralisation. However, the inconsistency\ndisappears as soon as we take into account the distinction between\ntemporal power and spiritual power. Centralisation applies only to\nspiritual power (Comte had clearly in mind the Papacy) and temporal\npower is by nature local. There are many passages where the\ncorrelation is clearly stated. This follows from the fact that the\nmind is not limited by boundaries; a spiritual power has no choice but\nto be catholic, that is, universal. Its domain is the planet\nEarth.\n\nFrom this, we have at least two consequences. The first one is a\nstrong interest in European reconstruction, a political priority\nbetween 1815 and 1820, but not anymore in 1850, after the triumph of\nnationalism. The second one is the realization that State as a concept\nis a historical product which did not exist before 1500, and there is\nno reason to believe that States will exist for ever. Hence his\nproposal to divide France into nineteen \u2018intendances\u2019: the\nextension of temporal power is not allowed to go beyond territories\nlike Belgium or Corsica.\n\nComte was also one of the first anti-colonialists. As the place where\npositive thinking appeared and developed, Comte considered Europe a\nleader of humanity (1851 [1875], 313, Varouxakis 2017), but the way it\ntook possession of the planet in modern times contradicts the very\nidea positivism had of Europe\u2019s place in history. Much before\nsocialists, English positivists objected to Victorian imperialism (see\nClaeys 2008). In this context, Comte and his followers also discussed\nextensively the respective merits of Christianity and Islam. Turks\nwere greatly appreciative of Comte and his followers\u2019\nsecularism, which represented a solution to many of the problems of\nthe Ottoman Empire. Ahmed Reza, an influent politician, was overtly\npositivist. Atat\u00fcrk and the Young Turks were strongly influenced\nby them (Kaynar 2021).\n5.3 The religion of Humanity\n\nThe System\u2019s subtitle is Treatise on Sociology\nInstituting the Religion of Humanity. While the different forms\nof deism preserve the idea of God and dissolve religion into a vague\nreligiosity, Comte proposes exactly the contrary: a religion with\nneither God nor the supernatural. His project had little success; he\neven accomplished a tour de force by uniting both believers\nand non-believers against him. The many ridiculous details of\nComte\u2019s religion made the task of his opponents even easier. But\nthis aspect of Comte\u2019s thought deserves better than the\ndiscredit into which it has fallen (Wernick 2000; de Lubac 1945).\n\nComte defines religion as \u2018the state of complete harmony\npeculiar to human life [\u2026] when all the parts of Life are\nordered in their natural relations to each other\u2019 (1851, v. 2,\n8; E.,v. 2, 8). Comte also defines religion as a consensus, analogous\nto what health is for the body. Religion has two functions, according\nto the point of view from which one considers existence: in its moral\nfunction, religion should govern each individual; in its political\nfunction, it should unite all individuals. Religion also has three\ncomponents, corresponding to the threefold division of the cerebral\ntable: doctrine, worship, and moral rule (discipline).\nComte\u2019s discussion is mainly about the first two. If one\nconsiders the first to be related to faith and the second to love,\ntheir relation takes two forms: \u2018Love comes first and leads us\nto the faith, so long as the growth is spontaneous; but when it\nbecomes systematic, then the belief is constructed in order to\nregulate the action of love\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 152; E., v. 2, 83). At\nfirst, Comte had followed the traditional order and presented doctrine\nbefore worship, but he soon gave priority to worship, and saw this\nchange as a considerable step forward.\n\nIn the positivist religion, worship, doctrine and moral rule all have\nthe same object, namely Humanity, which must be loved, known, and\nserved. Already the General Conclusions of the\nCourse compared the concept of Humanity to that of God,\naffirming the moral superiority of the former. But only in 1847 does\nComte make the substitution explicitly; sociological synthesis comes\nto replace theological synthesis. Membership of Humanity is\nsociological, not biological. In order to belong to what is defined as\nthe continuous whole of convergent beings \u2014 Comte\u2019s term\nfor (mainly human) beings who tend to agree \u2014 one has to be\nworthy of it. All \u2018producers of dung\u2019 are excluded;\nconversely, animals that have rendered important services can be\nincluded. Strictly speaking, it is to sociology that one should turn\nfor knowledge of the laws of the human order but, as the final science\nrecapitulates all others, it is the whole encyclopedic scale\n(\u00e9chelle ; it is the result of the classification of\nsciences), that constitutes the doctrine of the new religion, which\nthereby becomes demonstrated and is no longer revealed or\ninspired.\n\nThe principal novelty of Comte\u2019s religion therefore resides in\nworship, which is both private (taking place within the family) and\npublic. The positivists set up a whole system of prayers, hymns, and\nsacraments (Wright 1986). As these were all largely inspired by\nCatholic worship, it was said that it was \u2018catholicism without\nChrist\u2019, to which the positivists replied that it was\n\u2018catholicism plus science\u2019. The best known and most\noriginal aspects of Comte\u2019s religion are found in its public\nworship, and in the positivist liturgical calendar. As Humanity\nconsists more of dead than living beings, positivism designed a whole\nsystem of commemorations, which were to develop the sense of\nHumanity\u2019s historical continuity. The most prominent form of the\nworship of Humanity is the worship of great men. Unlike the French\nrevolutionary calendar, which followed the rhythm of the seasons, the\npositivist calendar takes its inspiration from history and pays homage\nto great men and women from all nations and all times.\n\nUsually, when dealing with positivist religion, one focuses on the\nfeatures classically associated with religion, as we have just done.\nIt is then easy to miss one of its most original aspects, namely a\npurely sociological approach (Bourdeau 2020). From this point of view,\nthree types of societies must be distinguished: the family, the State\n(Greek polis, Latin Civitas), and the Church. The\nState is made up of families, the Church is made up of States. Each is\nbased on different ties: affective for the first, active for the\nsecond, and intellectual for the third. Each also has a different\nrelationship to space. Hence the necessity to separate the State and\nthe Church. The religious society is by its nature catholic, in the\nsense of universal, and therefore has no boundaries other than those\nof the planet; the surface of a State meets different demands, which\nimpose rather strict geographic limits. The contrast between French\npolitical history and English political history, which was a common\nplace in Comte\u2019s time (see for instance Tocqueville or Guizot;\nit is already present in Montesquieu and Voltaire) illustrates the\npoint: there is no separation of Church and State in Great Britain, in\nthat sense that the Queen is also the head of the Anglican Church.\nNevertheless, its main application is related to the issue:\ncentralization against local powers, which is another aspect of the\nspatial dimension of politics. Of the two political models constantly\nconfronted in the Course, Comte clearly prefers the French\none. Its characteristic alliance of the monarchy with the people\nagainst the aristocracy was accompanied by a centralization that the\nRevolution contented itself with consolidating. One might therefore be\nled to believe that Comte was a partisan of centralized political\n(that is: temporal) power, whereas the contrary was in fact the case,\nas he proposed to divide France into seventeen administrative regions,\nmore or less equivalent to the old provinces (1851, v. 4, 421; Vernon\n1984). Centralization applies only to the spiritual power.\n5.4 Ethics and sociology\n\nPositivism asserted very early its wish to construct a moral doctrine\nthat owes nothing to the supernatural. If we need a spiritual power,\nit is because social questions are quite often moral rather than\npolitical. The reforms of society must be made in a determined order:\none has to change ideas, then morals (les moeurs; the word is\ndifficult to translate: it is something like ways of acting, habits,\nles us et coutumes), and only then institutions. But with the\nSystem, the moral doctrine (ethics) changes status and\nbecomes a science, whose task is to extend sociology in order to take\nindividual phenomena into account, in particular affective ones.\n\nThe terms of the problem as well as its solution are given by a saying\nto be found in the margin of the cerebral table: \u201cAct from\naffection and think in order to act\u201d (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1,\n594). The first part of this \u201csystematic verse\u201d is\nguaranteed by the dominance of the heart; but, among the ten\n\u201caffective forces\u201d, the first seven correspond to egoism,\nthe final three to altruism. The whole question is knowing which ones\nwould prevail, those of \u201cpersonality\u201d or those of\n\u201csociability\u201d. While it is important to acknowledge the\ninnateness of the sympathetic instincts, one is forced to admit their\nnative weakness: the supremacy of the egoistic tendencies is so clear\nthat it is itself one of the most striking traits in our nature. The\ngreat human problem is to reverse the natural order and to teach\nourselves to live for others.\n\nThe solution consists in \u2018regulating the inside through the\noutside\u2019 and depends, as a consequence, on a good use of the\nmind. The only way in which altruism can win, is to ally itself with\nthe mind, to make it its servant and not its slave. The heart, without\nthe light of reason, is blind. Left to itself, affectivity is\ncharacterized by its inconsistency and instability. That is why the\ninside has to be regulated, that is, disciplined. And this task is\nassigned to the outside, because exterior reality is the best of\nregulators. Whatever its own defects may be, the order that science\ndiscloses in nature is, by its indifference to our desires, a source\nof discipline. The recognition of an unchanging external order thus\nbecomes \u2018the objective base of true human wisdom\u2019, and\n\u2018in the obligation to conform themselves to it\u2019 our\naffections find \u2018a source of fixedness appropriate for\ncontrolling their spontaneous capriciousness, and a direct stimulation\nto the dominance of the sympathetic instincts\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 322;\nE., v. 1, 257). Science now finds itself vested with a moral function;\nbut that also means that \u2018thoughts must be systematized before\nfeelings\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 21; E., v. 1, 17) and that, if moral\nascendancy is the primary attribute of the spiritual power, that power\nwould not be able to carry out its duties without the aid of a\nsuperior intellect.\n\nWhile developing a science of morals founded on moral doctrine,\nDurkheim and L\u00e9vy-Bruhl were heavily dependent upon this aspect\nof the System. Like the word \u2018sociology\u2019, the\nword \u2018altruism\u2019 was coined by Comte. Being deeply aware of\nwhat man and animals have in common, Comte was close to what is known\ntoday as \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019: he saw cooperation between\nmen as continuous with phenomena of which biology gives us further\nexamples. The same interest in biology led him to link medicine to\nmoral doctrine and even to religion. In our modern societies, the\nstudy of the human being \u2018is now irrationally parcelled out\namongst three classes of thinkers: the Physicians, who study only the\nbody; the Philosophers, who imagine to study the mind; and the\nPriests, who specially study the heart\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 437; E., v.\n2, 356). To remedy this and to respect the unity of our nature, he\nproposed giving the new clergy a role in medicine, considering for\nexample that there is no better endorsement of a rule of hygiene than\na religious decree. Before dying, he still had the time to outline, in\nhis letters to Audiffrent, the rudiments of a sociological theory of\ndiseases.\n6. Conclusion\n\nOn the whole, the System was not well received. Almost\nimmediately, Mill and Littr\u00e9 put forward the idea that there\nwere a good Comte, the author of the Course, and a bad Comte,\nthe author of the System. However, it is impossible to\nconfine oneself merely to the Course. The early works had\nmade a strong impression on some of the best minds of the time; they\nremain required reading for everyone wishing to understand positive\nphilosophy, as they are still among the best introductions to the\nsubject. The Course was not part of the initial project,\nwhich Comte never lost sight of; the work is best considered as a\nparenthesis, admittedly open for twenty years, but which Comte had\nmeant to close very quickly. The reason why Comte had always presented\nthe Plan of 1822 as fundamental is that, beginning with the\nvery title, one finds the two themes that he planned to think through\nin their relation to one another: science and society. The foremost\nquestion is a political one: how should society be reorganized?\nScience, although present from the beginning, plays a secondary role\nas the means to achieve the chosen goal. All of Comte\u2019s work\naims at the foundation of a discipline in which the study of society\nwill finally become positive, scientific. His idea of sociology is not\nquite the one we are used to today; but the current meaning of the\nterm \u2018positivism\u2019, according to which it is merely a\nphilosophy of science, is even more misleading as a clue to\nComte\u2019s thought. Even though the founder of positivism is\nrightly considered to be one of the great philosophers of science,\nalong with Poincar\u00e9 and Carnap, his natural place is elsewhere,\nalong with sociologists such as his contemporaries Marx and\nTocqueville. Only when the question arises of what distinguishes Comte\nfrom the latter does science enter into the picture.\n\nThe limits of Comte\u2019s philosophy of science are easily seen, but\nthis does not diminish its value, which remains considerable. Yet the\nsame cannot be said of the positive polity. Given that the separation\nof spiritual power and temporal power rests on the separation between\ntheory and practice, Comte abstained from any direct political action,\nand, for example, condemned Mill\u2019s decision to stand in\nparliament. But his own project for the reorganization of society\npresents a similar problem. In his writings, it is difficult to\ndistinguish that which concerns objective social science from a reform\nprogram that reflects only a personal stand.\n\nApart from that difficulty, the weaknesses of the positive polity are\nnumerous. Among them, those that are the most conspicuous (criticism\nof human rights, praise of dictatorship) are not necessarily the most\nserious, for objections to the former are easily answered. For\nexample, while Comte criticizes freedom of conscience, he is always\nhighly supportive of freedom of expression. We should also find his\ndeep respect for spontaneity reassuring, considering that it is an\nimportant part of our idea of freedom. More serious, perhaps, seem to\nbe the consequences of the rejection of psychology. The moral\nquestion, \u2018What should I do?\u2019, is no longer asked in the\nfirst person, and is transformed into an engineering problem:\n\u2018What should be done to make men more ethical?\u2019 Similarly,\nthe positivists were invited to live openly, whereby the distinction\nbetween private and public lives disappears.\n\nHowever, considering only the weaknesses of the positive polity would\nnot be fair. Even if Comte was often mistaken, his theory of\nconsensus, as well as the seriousness with which he considered the\nquestion \u2018What religion after the death of God?\u2019 (to give\nbut two examples) are likely to help us resolve certain problems\nconfronting our society. Comte\u2019s thought is resolutely oriented\ntoward the future. The order of time, he said, is not\npast-present-future, but rather past-future-present. The latter, being\nonly \u2018a vague and fleeting span which fills the interval between\ntwo immensities of duration, and binds them together [\u2026], can\nonly be properly conceived with the aid of the two extremes which it\nunites and separates\u2019 (1851, v. 2, 364; E., v. 2, 296).\n\nA sound assessment of Comte\u2019s philosophy must also take into\naccount the work of his followers, a topic that has recently received\nrenewed attention, especially for England (Wilson 2019, 2021).",
