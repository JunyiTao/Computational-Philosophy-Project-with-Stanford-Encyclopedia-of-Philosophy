    "main_text": "The Frege hierarchy\n15. Extending the setting\n\nThe research on logic systems described in the previous sections has\nbeen extended to encompass other consequence relations that go beyond\npropositional logics, like equational logics and the consequence\nrelations between sequents built from the formulas of a propositional\nlanguage definable using sequent calculi. The interested reader can\nconsult the excellent paper Raftery 2006a.\n\nThis research arose the need for an even more abstract way of\ndeveloping the theory of consequence relations. It has lead to a\nreformulation (in a category-theoretic setting) of the theory of logic\nsystems as explained in this entry. The work has been done mainly by\nG. Voutsadakis in a series of papers, e.g., Voutsadakis 2002.\nVoutsadakis\u2019s approach uses the notion of a pi-institution,\nintroduced by Fiadeiro and Sernadas, as the analog of the logic\nsystems in his category-theoretic setting. Some work in this direction\nis also found in Gil-F\u00e9rez 2006. A different approach to a\ngeneralization of the studies encompassing the work done for logic\nsystems and for sequent calculi is found in Galatos & Tsinakis\n2009; Gil-F\u00e9rez 2011 is also in this line. The work presented\nin these two papers originates in Blok & J\u00f3nsson 2006. The\nGalatos-Tsinakis approach has been recently extended in a way that\nalso encompasses the setting of Voutsadakis in Galatos &\nGil-F\u00e9rez 2017.\n\nAnother recent line of research that extends the framework described\nin this entry develops a theory of algebraization of many-sorted logic\nsystems using instead of the equational consequence relation of the\nnatural class of algebras a many-sorted behavioral equational\nconsequence (a notion coming from computer science) and a weaker\nconcept than algebraizable logic: behaviorally algebraizable logic.\nSee Caleiro, Gon\u00e7alves & Martins 2009.\n",
