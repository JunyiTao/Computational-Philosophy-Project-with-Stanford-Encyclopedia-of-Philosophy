    "main_text": "Democratic Ideals and Realities\n4. Legacies\n\nDewey\u2019s obituarists eulogized him as the authoritative American\nphilosopher of democracy. Both during his life and subsequently,\nhowever, he has been a more controversial figure than this reputation\nwould suggest. In part, this reflects his profile and fecundity.\nPrecisely because he ranged so prominently across such a wide\nintellectual terrain, Dewey has been a point of reference and target\nfor commentators in all the fields he explored: his educational\nwritings in particular became a default fons et origo of the\nalleged ills ascribed to schemes of progressive education by their\ncritics. Further, across a long and active career as a public\nintellectual, Dewey adopted bold and controversial political positions\non deeply divisive issues, including (for example) robustly supporting\nUS entry into the First World War and later opposing intervention in\nthe Second World War, which also attracted fierce opprobrium as well\nas support.\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatism was always highly contentious. A dominant\nview for much of the twentieth century, expounded by such diverse\nvoices as Lewis Mumford (1926), Louis Hartz (1955), Bernard Crick\n(1959), Max Horkheimer (1974), Herbert Marcuse (2011), John Diggins\n(1994), and Sheldon Wolin (2004), was that pragmatism is a philosophy\nfor liberal technocrats, an account of how to think flexibly about the\nachievement of socially endorsed parochial goals but with few\nresources to think critically about those goals. For others, including\nBertrand Russell and William Elliott, its apparent laxity about\nobjectivity made it susceptible to capture by darker forces, such as\nfascism (a point some fascists were happy to accept). To skeptics in\ndemocratic theory, following in the tracks of Lippmann and other of\nDewey\u2019s contemporaries such as Reinhold Niebuhr (1960),\nDewey\u2019s radical and unconventional idea of democracy is\nextravagantly optimistic about the epistemic capacities of the\nindividual citizen and of democratic institutions. By the\nmid-twentieth century his views had to some extent staled in the face\nof stimulating new research programmes, such as logical empiricism,\nthe Frankfurt School, existentialism, and other approaches. And the\nkey intellectual antagonist of much of Dewey\u2019s political\nwriting, laissez-faire liberalism, occupied a relatively\nmarginal space.\n\nThe philosopher who probably did the most singlehandedly to promote\nthe recrudescence of interest in Dewey\u2019s thinking after this\nperiod of relative marginality, Richard Rorty, found in his work an\nhistorically-minded questioning of epistemological foundations and\naspirations to a God\u2019s-eye point of view that of course provided\nfodder for Rorty\u2019s own project. Yet, in relation to political\nphilosophy, Rorty\u2019s skeptical postmodern liberal ironism glossed\nover the detailed architecture of Dewey\u2019s ethical and political\ntheory, and made very little either of Dewey\u2019s own naturalistic\nconfidence in the mutually supportive or his conception of the\nprogressive character of scientific method and democracy. Even among\nthose philosophers who have been keen to draw on the pragmatist\ntradition as a resource for more positively elaborating a political\ntheory than Rorty was inclined to there are important figures, such as\nCheryl Misak (2000, 2013), who seek foundations for their view\nelsewhere, notably in Peirce\u2019s view of the precondition of\nbelief, and express doubts about what they see as Dewey\u2019s less\nclearly grounded ethical commitments. However, others such as Hilary\nand Ruth Anna Putnam (2017) and Philip Kitcher (2020, 2021) more\nwholeheartedly identify with, and try to develop, the commitments of\nDewey\u2019s pragmatic naturalism, in thinking through the\nrelationship between scientific inquiry, ethics and democracy. In\npart, recent increased engagement with Dewey\u2019s political\nphilosophy from philosophers across a range of traditions, including\nepistemic democrats, such as Elizabeth Anderson (2006), and Frankfurt\nSchool critical theorists, such as Axel Honneth (1998, 2008, 2014) and\nRahel Jaeggi (2018), flows from an interest in developing a fuller\nunderstanding of democracy as a method of social learning. In the\nteeth of the neoliberal revival of laissez-faire\nliberalism, many of these authors, and others, have mined his work\nas a resource for contemporary thinking about liberal socialism\nand participatory democracy (Medearis 2015, Jackson 2018).\nDewey\u2019s political philosophy remains an important reference\npoint and source of inspiration for thinkers who seek to explore and\ndevelop radical forms of democratic liberalism.\n",
