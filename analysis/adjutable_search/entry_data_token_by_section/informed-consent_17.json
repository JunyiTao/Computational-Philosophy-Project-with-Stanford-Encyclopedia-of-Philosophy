    "main_text": "Voluntary consent || Undue inducement\n5.2 Undue inducement\n\nAnother category often said to undermine voluntariness is undue\ninducement, a term of art meaning that something is being offered that\nis alluring to the point that it clouds rational judgment, for\ninstance cash in hand or airline tickets in return for kidney donation\nor risky study participation. Attention is fixated on the benefit,\ndisallowing proper consideration of risks. The thought here is not\nthat the offer is too good to decline rationally, but that, as in\ndeceit and hypnosis, proper reasoning and decision-making about it\nbecomes impossible, at least for some patient populations (Wilkinson\n2003, 117\u2013118). A common worry among bioethics practitioners,\nundue inducement is less concerning to philosophers who have tried to\nmake sense of the notion (e.g. Wertheimer 2010).\n",
