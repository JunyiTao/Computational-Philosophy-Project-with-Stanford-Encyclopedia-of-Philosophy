    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || Supervenience, Realization, and Emergence\n3.6 Supervenience, Realization, and Emergence\n\nLike \u2018supervenience\u2019, both \u2018realization\u2019 and\n\u2018emergence\u2019 are philosophical terms of art. Their\ndefinitions are stipulative and thus can only be judged by their\ntheoretical usefulness, not by accord with common usage.\n\nRealization is primarily taken to be a relationship between\nproperties, though derivative notions of property instance realization\nand state of affairs realization have been defined. We will focus on\nproperty realization. There is more than one use of the term\n\u2018property realization\u2019 in literature. Perhaps the leading\nuse is the one found in the literature on the functionalist theory of\nmind. (See, e.g., Block 1980; Melnyk 2003, 2006). On the functional\nview of realization, one property G realizes another\nF just in case G occupies (or fills or plays) the\ncausal role associated with F, \u2018the\nF-role\u2019\u2014that is, just in case instances of\nG have the kinds of causes and kinds of effects that comprise\nthe F-role. Thus, for instance, a neural property will\nrealize pain just in case it has the kinds of causes and effects that\ncomprise the pain-role. (According to analytical functionalism, the\npain-role is the causal role that folk psychology associates with\npain; according to psychofunctionalism, it is the causal role that\nscientific psychology associates with pain.) If more than one property\nplays the F-role, then F is multiply realizable.\n(See the entry on\n  multiple realizability.)\n \n\nSydney Shoemaker (2007, chapter 2) defines a related notion of\nproperty realization, which he calls the \u2018subset view of\nrealization\u2019. He says that \u201cas a first approximation,\nproperty P has property Q as a realizer just in case\n(1) the forward-looking causal features of property P are a\nsubset of the forward-looking causal features of property Q,\nand (2) the backward-looking causal features of P have as a\nsubset the backward-looking features of Q\u201d (2007, 12).\nOnce again, if P has more than one realizer, then P\nis multiply realizable. (McLaughlin (2007) argues that this subset\nnotion of realization, will not serve Shoemaker\u2019s purposes.)\n\n\nThere are other, less well-entrenched notions of realization in the\nliterature (e.g., Gillett 2003; Shoemaker 2007, chapter 3), but it\nwould take us too far afield to spell these out in detail.\n\nWhat is the relation between supervenience and realization, in either\nof the above senses? It looks like realization is sufficient for\nsupervenience, at least for non-local versions of supervenience. But\nsupervenience is not sufficient for realization, for reasons that are\nfamiliar from section 3.5: necessary properties supervene on anything,\nand properties supervene on their own negations. Further, because\nrealization is a distinctively causal notion, there are additional\nconsiderations here. The interesting case has to do with epiphenomenal\nproperties\u2014those that have no causal powers and play no causal\nrole. Perhaps mathematical properties are epiphenomenal in this way.\nLet F be such a property, and let it supervene upon\nG. F is not functionally-realized by G,\nsince G does not play F\u2019s distinctive causal role\n(F does not have one). So this is another reason to deny that\nsupervenience is sufficient for functional realization. But F\nis Shoemaker-realized by G. That\u2019s because\nF\u2019s causal powers are the null set, and the null set is a\nsubset of every set. Epiphenomenal properties are thus\nShoemaker-realized by anything at all, including G.\n(Shoemaker\u2019s view of realization, like his view about the causal\nindividuation of properties (1980), is simply not well-suited to the\nepiphenomenal case.) \n\nWhat about emergence? The term is used in a variety of ways, in the\nsciences as well as philosophy. These uses are so wildly divergent\nthat it is not clear that there is a common core notion. (See the\nessays in Bedau and Humphreys 2008, in Gibbs, Hendry, and Lancaster\n2019, Wilson 2021, and the entry on\n emergent properties.)\n But one canonical source of emergence talk is the British Emergentist\ntradition, particularly the work of C.D. Broad. Broad thought of\nemergent properties as fundamental properties possessed by complex\nobjects (Broad 1925; McLaughlin 1992, 1997, 2019). A number of\nphilosophers have suggested that Broad\u2019s notion can be characterized\nby means of supervenience with mere nomological necessity (e.g. van\nCleve 1990, Chalmers 2006). One question that arises, then, is whether\nthe appeal to nomological as opposed to metaphysical necessity can\ndistinguish emergence from tighter relations like realization; Jessica\nWilson (2005; 2021, 143\u2013149) and others have argued that it\ncannot.\n",
