    "main_text": "Arguments against Ethical Supervenience, or its Significance || Arguments against the strong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical\n5.3 Arguments against the strong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical\n\nSection 1.3\n showed that one of the crucial choice-points in theorizing ethical\nsupervenience is the strength of the modality of the supervenience\nrelation (conceptual? metaphysical? etc.). And\n Section 3\n and\n Section 4\n showed that the claim that the ethical supervenes with conceptual or\nmetaphysical necessity is the starting point for several influential\narguments. Gideon Rosen\u2019s (2020) develops a view of the modal\nstrength of ethical supervenience that is intended to be strong enough\nto accommodate the intuitive appearances, while weak enough to be\ndialectically inert.\n\nThe heart of Rosen\u2019s challenge is an argument that we can\ncharacterize and clearly regiment a notion of normative\nnecessity, which falls short of metaphysical necessity (i.e. at least\nsome normative necessities are metaphysically contingent), while still\nbeing quite strong, in the sense that in any counterfactual where one\nconsiders how things would be if we altered some non-normative fact,\nwe hold fixed the normative necessities. Rosen proposes that normative\nnecessity is the appropriate modality for ethical supervenience. If he\nis correct about this, most of the arguments from supervenience\ndiscussed so far would fail, as they tend to require ethical\nsupervenience to have either metaphysical or conceptual strength.\n\nEven with this alternative clearly stated, the strong metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical may seem especially plausible. But with\nhis account of normative necessity in hand, Rosen can make two points:\n(i) when we consider possibilities that violate the strong\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical, we are considering very\ndistant possibilities, where our modal judgments may not be\nparticularly trustworthy, and (ii) our judgments of metaphysical\nimpossibility of these scenarios might be explained by implicit\nconfusion derived from the fact that while these scenarios may be\nmetaphysically possible, they are normatively impossible.\n\nBy rejecting strong metaphysical supervenience, Rosen must reject the\nSidgwickian explanatory idea suggested in\n Section 2:\n that ethical supervenience reflects a commitment to rejecting brute\nethical contingency. One worry about Rosen\u2019s strategy is that by\nembracing such contingency one permits an especially objectionable\nform of moral luck (Dreier, 2019). On Rosen\u2019s view, there may be\na world that is relevantly non-ethically identical to this one in\nwhich my counterpart is ethically quite different: in the\nextreme case, it raises the specter that the specific loving attitudes\nthat I bear towards my child might have been evil, or even\njust a matter of utter ethical indifference. But it is hard to believe\nthat I am lucky that the very attitudes that I possess count\nas commendable rather than awful. (See Lange 2018 for another\nimportant challenge to Rosen\u2019s argument).\n\nAnandi Hattiangadi (2018) offers a conceivability argument against the\nidea that the ethical supervenes with conceptual or metaphysical\nnecessity. The core idea is this. Mutually inconsistent ethical\nprinciples each appear to be perfectly conceivable. And in general,\nconceivability is a good guide to possibility. But if utilitarianism\nand Kantianism, say, are both true in some possible world otherwise\nlike ours, then the supervenience of the ethical fails.\n\nOne worry for Hattiangadi\u2019s argument is that there seems to be a\nstraightforward way to contextualize the relevant conceivability\njudgments. Consider an analogy. I cannot remember the atomic number of\nplutonium. So it is conceivable to me that plutonium atoms have any of\na fairly wide range of numbers of protons. But I do not think\nthat it is possible both that one plutonium atom has 100 protons, and\nthat some other possible plutonium atom has 110 protons. If any\nplutonium atom has 100 protons, they all do. (This stems from my\nempirically-derived belief that number of protons is essential to the\nnature of plutonium). Similarly, I can entertain the possibility that\nutilitarianism is true, or that it is false. But what is hard to wrap\none\u2019s head around is the idea that there might be worlds just\nlike this one in all base respects, which vary with respect to whether\nutilitarianism is true.\n",
