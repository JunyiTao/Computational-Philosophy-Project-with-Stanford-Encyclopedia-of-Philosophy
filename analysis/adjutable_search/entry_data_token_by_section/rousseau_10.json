    "main_text": "Education\n5. Education\n\nRousseau\u2019s ideas about education are mainly expounded in\nEmile. In that work, he advances the idea of \u201cnegative\neducation\u201d, which is a form of \u201cchild-centered\u201d\neducation. His essential idea is that education should be carried out,\nso far as possible, in harmony with the development of the\nchild\u2019s natural capacities by a process of apparently autonomous\ndiscovery. This is in contrast to a model of education where the\nteacher is a figure of authority who conveys knowledge and skills\naccording to a pre-determined curriculum. Rousseau depends here on his\nthesis of natural goodness, which he asserts at the beginning of the\nbook, and his educational scheme involves the protection and\ndevelopment of the child\u2019s natural goodness through various\nstages, along with the isolation of the child from the domineering\nwills of others. Up to adolescence at least, the educational program\ncomprises a sequence of manipulations of the environment by the tutor.\nThe child is not told what to do or think but is led to draw its own\nconclusions as a result of its own explorations, the context for which\nhas been carefully arranged. The first stage of the program starts in\ninfancy, where Rousseau\u2019s crucial concern is to avoid conveying\nthe idea that human relations are essentially ones of domination and\nsubordination, an idea that can too easily by fostered in the infant\nby the conjunction of its own dependence on parental care and its\npower to get attention by crying. Though the young child must be\nprotected from physical harm, Rousseau is keen that it becomes\naccustomed to the exercise of its bodily powers and he therefore\nadvises that the child be left as free as possible rather than being\nconfined or constrained.\n\nFrom the age of about twelve or so, the program moves on to the\nacquisition of abstract skills and concepts. This is not done with the\nuse of books or formal lessons, but rather through practical\nexperience. The third phase of education coincides with puberty and\nearly adulthood. The period of isolation comes to an end and the child\nstarts to take an interest in others (particularly the opposite sex),\nand in how he is regarded. At this stage the great danger is that\nexcessive amour propre will extend to exacting recognition\nfrom others, disregarding their worth, and demanding subordination.\nThe task of the tutor is to ensure that the pupil\u2019s relations\nwith others are first mediated through the passion of\npiti\u00e9 (compassion) so that through the idea of the\nsuffering others, of care, and of gratitude, the pupil finds a secure\nplace for the recognition of his own moral worth where his amour\npropre is established on a non-competitive basis. The final\nperiod of education involves the tutor changing from a manipulator of\nthe child\u2019s environment into the adult\u2019s trusted advisor.\nThe young and autonomous adult finds a spouse who can be another\nsource of secure and non-competitive recognition. This final phase\nalso involves instruction into the nature of the social world,\nincluding the doctrines of Rousseau\u2019s political philosophy.\n\nIn addition to Rousseau\u2019s theory of education for an individual,\nhe also addresses the topic of mass education for citizens, primarily\nin the Discourse on Political Economy and in\nConsiderations on the Government of Poland. There, his stress\nis on the formation of patriotic citizens, committed to the general\nwill and the law, and on education as being one of the primary\nresponsibilities of magistrates. He deplores class segregation in\neducation and argues for the desirability of common institutions for\nall, either free or at an affordable charge.\n",
