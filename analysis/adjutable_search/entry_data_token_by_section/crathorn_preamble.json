    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam Crathorn (fl. 1330s), like Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Robert\nHolkot (c. 1290\u20131349), belonged to the first generation of\nOxford philosophers after William of Ockham (c. 1285\u20131347), who\nsought to criticize and develop Ockham\u2019s philosophy. Crathorn is\nremembered for his theories of language and cognition, and for some\nanti-skeptical arguments strikingly similar to those found in\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations. The radical ontology of his\nworks is also noteworthy, though it has not yet been closely\nstudied.\n",
