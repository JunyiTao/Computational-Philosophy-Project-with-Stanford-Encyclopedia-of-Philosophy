    "main_text": "\n\nPolitical revolutions are transformative moments marked by profound,\nrapid change in the political order achieved through the use of force\nrather than through consensus or legal process. Moral responses to\nrevolutions are often ambivalent or deeply polarized. On the one hand,\nrevolutions promise to be powerful engines of moral progress, allowing\na community to abolish an oppressive social order and providing the\nopportunity to institute a better one. On the other hand, revolutions\nrisk unravelling the fabric of political community and devolving into\nbloody, prolonged conflicts that only manage to reinstate a new\noppressive regime. In this entry, we will clarify the concept of\nrevolution and then go on survey the complex moral issues surrounding\npolitical revolutions.\n\nSection 1 discusses conceptual issues, distinguishing between\ndifferent understandings of revolution and between violent and\nnonviolent revolution; it also distinguishes revolution from\nresistance, rebellion, and secession. Section 2 outlines in broad\nrelief some of the major historical views on the morality of\nrevolution. Section 3 applies the moral framework developed by\ncontemporary just war theory to examine complications facing the\njustification of resorting to revolutionary war (revolutionary jus\nad bellum). Section 4 examines the justification of the conduct\nof revolutionaries in armed conflict (revolutionary jus in\nbello), with emphasis on the way in which revolutionaries employ\nirregular tactics. Section 5 surveys some contemporary exchanges\nconcerning the justification of foreign intervention into\nrevolutionary war. The Conclusion suggests directions for further\nphilosophical work on revolution.\n",
