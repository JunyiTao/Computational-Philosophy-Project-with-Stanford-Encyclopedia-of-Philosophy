    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Literary Work of Art\n3.1 The Literary Work of Art\n\n\nBy far Ingarden\u2019s best-known and most influential work, especially\nin the English-speaking world, is The Literary Work of Art,\nwhich was written around 1926, and first published in German in 1931.\nIt is fundamentally a work in ontology, in Ingarden\u2019s sense (see\n\u00a72 above), laying out the essential features anything must have to\nbe counted as a literary work, what parts it must have and how they are\ninterrelated, and how such entities as literary works relate to other\nsorts of entities such as authors, copies of texts, readers, and ideal\nmeanings.\n\n\nAs with so much of Ingarden\u2019s philosophical work, he undertakes this\nstudy of the ontology of the literary work in part with the motive of\nutilizing its results to argue against transcendental idealism \u2014\nindeed he conceived of The Literary Work of Art as a\npreliminary study for The Controversy. Literary works and the\ncharacters and objects represented in them were to provide examples of\npurely intentional objects \u2014 objects owing their existence and essence\nto consciousness. Thus a detailed study of works of literature and\ntheir represented objects could serve to explicate the purely\nintentional mode of being, with a view to contrasting this with the\nreal mode of being and ultimately demonstrating that it is impossible\nto reduce the \u2018real world\u2019 to the status of a purely\nintentional creation. [Streit, vii-viii]. Nonetheless, this\nmotive remains largely behind the scenes of the detailed studies of\nlanguage and literature in The Literary Work of Art, which can\nbe (and largely has been) described and evaluated without reference to\nthese broader motives, as an independent contribution to aesthetics and\nliterary theory.\n\n\nThe work begins by attempting to determine the \u2018mode of\nexistence\u2019 of the literary work \u2014 essentially the same problem\nthat today goes under the heading of understanding the ontological\nstatus of works of literature, music, etc. In twelve concise pages, he\nprovides compelling reasons to reject both attempts to identify\nliterary works with \u201creal\u201d objects or events such as copies\nof texts or the psychological experiences of authors or readers, and\nattempts to identify them with platonistic \u201cideal\u201d objects\nsuch as ordered manifolds of sentences or meanings. Each such attempted\nidentification leads to various absurdities, e.g. the view literary\nworks are physical objects would lead us to say that such works differ\nby chemical composition; the view that they are experiences of the\nauthor would make them completely unknowable, while the view that they\nare experiences of readers would prevent us from postulating a single\nwork Hamlet known by many readers; and the view that they are\nideal objects would entail that literary works may never be created and\ncannot be changed, even by their authors.\n\n\nAs a result, works of literature cannot be classified in either of\nthe major categories of objects accepted by traditional metaphysics \u2014\nneither the categories of the real nor the ideal are suited for them.\nAny acceptable ontology of literature thus must accept entities of\nanother category. As Ingarden ultimately argues towards the close of\nthe text, the literary work is a \u201cpurely intentional\nformation,\u201d derived from the sentence-forming activities of its\nauthor(s), and founded on some public copy of these sentences, and also\ndepending for its existence and essence on a relation to certain ideal\nmeanings attached to the words of the text.\n\n\nWhile the question of the ontological status of the literary work\nforms the work\u2019s beginning, most of the details of the text are\ndedicated to drawing out an \u201cessential anatomy\u201d of the\nliterary work, determining its essential parts and their relations to\none another. Ingarden conceives of this task as preliminary to any questions\nof the values that works of literature may or may not have, as we will\nbe better able to see where values of different types can inhere once\nwe know what the different parts of the literary work are.\n\n\nAccording to Ingarden, every literary work is composed of four\nheterogeneous strata:\n\nWord sounds and phonetic formations of higher order (including the\ntypical rhythms and melodies associated with phrases, sentences and\nparagraphs of various kinds)\nMeaning units (formed by conjoining the sounds employed in a\nlanguage with ideal concepts; these also range from the individual\nmeanings of words to the higher-order meanings of phrases, sentences,\nparagraphs, etc.)\nSchematized aspects (these are the visual, auditory, or other\n\u2018aspects\u2019 via which the characters and places represented\nin the work may be \u2018quasi-sensorially\u2019 apprehended)\nRepresented entities (the objects, events, states of affairs, etc.\nrepresented in the literary work and forming its characters, plot,\netc.).\n\n\n\nEach of these strata has room for its own typical sorts of aesthetic\nvalue (or disvalue); thus we may distinguish the values of rhythm,\nalliteration, or mellifluousness at the level of word sounds, from the\nvalues in interesting (or jarring) juxtapositions of ideas and concepts\nat the level of meaning units, from the quasi-visual splendor of the\nscene presented, from the values of sympathetic or complex characters\nand intricate plots.\n\n\nThe values of a literary work, however, are not exhausted by the\nseparate values of its several strata, for the strata do not exist\nseparately, but rather form an \u2018organic unity\u2019. Among the\nstrata are various forms of mutual dependence and influence, and the\nharmonies or disharmonies among the strata (e.g. between the halting\nrhythms of a character\u2019s speech and his timid personality) may\ncontribute other aesthetic merits or demerits to the work. Most\nimportantly, in cooperation with the other strata, the stratum of\nrepresented objects may present \u201cmetaphysical qualities\u201d\nsuch as the tragic, the dreadful, the peaceful and so on, which\ncharacterize true works of art. The work of literature as a whole,\nthus, is a \u201cpolyphonic harmony,\u201d much like a piece of\npolyphonic music in which each singer\u2019s voice may lend aesthetic\nqualities of its own to the value of the whole, while the greatest\nvalues of the work as a whole may lie in the intricate interrelations\namong the values of all of the individual elements.\n\n\nA stratified theory like Ingarden\u2019s has considerable strengths. It\nprovides a framework within which we can offer detailed analyses of\nliterary works identifying their many sorts of value or disvalue,\nrather than simply passing judgment on the whole. As a result, many\napparent conflicts in judgments of taste may be resolved without\nembracing subjectivism, by noting that the individuals concerned may be\npassing judgment on different strata of the literary work. It also\nenables us to understand stylistic differences among authors and over\ntime as differences in which strata are emphasized and which\nde-emphasized, e.g. as many modernist works de-emphasize the\ntraditionally foregrounded stratum of represented objects in favor of\njuxtaposed images at the level of schematized aspects (e.g. Virginia\nWoolf\u2019s The Waves), or even background both of these to the\nrhythms and sound patterns at the level of phonetic formations (e.g.\nEdith Sitwell\u2019s nonsense poetry). Yet we can do so without seeing such\nchanges as forming a radical break or undermining the idea that these\nare all part of a continuous literary tradition.\n",
