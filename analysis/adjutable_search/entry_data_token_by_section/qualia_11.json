    "main_text": "Russellian Monism about Qualia\n12. Which Creatures Undergo States with Qualia?\n\nDo frogs have qualia? Or fish? What about honey bees? Somewhere down\nthe phylogenetic scale phenomenal consciousness ceases. But where? It\nis sometimes supposed that once we begin to reflect upon much simpler\nbeings than ourselves \u2014 snails, for example \u2014 we are left\nwith nothing physical or structural that we could plausibly take to\nhelp us determine whether they are phenomenally conscious (Papineau\n1994). There is really no way of our knowing if spiders are\nsubject to states with qualia, as they spin their webs, or if fish\nundergo any phenomenal experiences, as they swim about in the sea.\n\n\nRepresentationalism has the beginnings of an answer to the above\nquestions. If what it is for a state to have phenomenal character is\n(very roughly) that it be a state that (i) carries information about\ncertain features, internal or external, and (ii) is such that this\ninformation stands ready and available to make a direct difference to\nbeliefs and desires (or belief- and desire-like states), then\ncreatures that are incapable of reasoning, of changing their behavior\nin light of assessments they make, based upon information provided to\nthem by sensory stimulation of one sort or another, are not\nphenomenally conscious. Tropistic organisms, on this view, feel and\nexperience nothing. They have no qualia. They are full-fledged\nunconscious automata or zombies, rather as blindsight subjects are\nrestricted unconscious automata or partial zombies with respect to a\nrange of visual stimuli.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of plants. There are many different\nsorts of plant behavior. Some plants climb, others eat flies, still\nothers catapult out seeds. Many plants close their leaves at night.\nThe immediate cause of these activities is something internal to the\nplants. Seeds are ejected because of the hydration or dehydration of\nthe cell walls in seed pods. Leaves are closed because of water\nmovement in the stems and petioles of the leaves, itself induced by\nchanges in the temperature and light. These inner events or states are\nsurely not phenomenal. There is nothing it is like to be a Venus Fly\nTrap or a Morning-Glory.\n\nThe behavior of plants is inflexible. It is genetically determined\nand, therefore, not modifiable by learning. Natural selection has\nfavored the behavior, since historically it has been beneficial to the\nplant species. But it need not be now. If, for example, flies start to\ncarry on their wings some substance that sickens Venus Fly Traps for\nseveral days afterwards, this will not have any effect on the plant\nbehavior with respect to flies. Each Venus Fly Trap will continue to\nsnap at flies as long as it has the strength to do so.\n\nPlants do not learn from experience. They do not acquire beliefs and\nchange them in light of things that happen to them. Nor do they have\nany desires. To be sure, we sometimes speak as if they do. We say that\nthe wilting daffodils are just begging to be watered. But we recognize\nfull well that this is a harmless fa\u00e7on de parler. What we mean\nis that the daffodils need water. There is here no\ngoal-directed behavior, no purpose, nothing that is the result of any\nlearning, no desire for water.\n\nPlants, on the representational view, are not subject to any qualia.\nNothing that goes on inside them is poised to make a direct difference\nto what they believe or desire, since they have no beliefs or\ndesires.\n\nReasoning of the above sort can be used to make a case that even\nthough qualia do not extend to plants and paramecia, qualia are very\nwidely distributed in nature (see Tye 1997, 2000). Of course, such a\ncase requires decisions to be made about the attribution of beliefs\nand desires (or belief- and desire-like states) to much simpler\ncreatures. And such decisions are likely to be controversial in some\ncases. Moreover, representationalism itself is a very controversial\nposition. The general topic of the origins of qualia is not one on\nwhich philosophers have said a great deal. (For a general,\nwide-ranging discussion of this issue that is neutral on the nature of\nqualia, see Tye 2016.)\n",
