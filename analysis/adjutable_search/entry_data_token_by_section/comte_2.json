The Formative Years: The Collaboration with Saint-Simon and the Early Writings\n\nThe early writings remain the required starting point for everyone who\nwishes to understand the goal that Comte incessantly pursued. It is\nnot without reason that on the first page of the System Comte\napplied to himself Alfred de Vigny\u2019s words: \u2018What is a\ngreat life? A thought of youth, executed by mature age.\u2019 His\nformative years were dominated by his relationship with Saint-Simon.\nWhen meeting him in 1817, Comte, like his fellow students at the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, had just been dismissed by Louis XVIII and\nwas therefore looking for a job. He even thought of emigrating to the\nUnited States to teach at a school that Jefferson was planning to open\nand which was to be modeled on the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. The\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, whose faculty included the likes of Arago,\nLaplace, Cauchy, and Poisson, had been for Comte what the\nEvangelisches Stift in T\u00fcbingen had been for Hegel.\nThere, he got an education in science that was second to none in all\nof Europe; it left a permanent imprint on him. But he was equally a\ntypical representative of the generation of Tocqueville and Guizot\nthat saw itself confronted with the question of how to stop the\nRevolution after the collapse of the Empire. \u2018How,\u2019 as\nComte would put it in 1848, \u2018does one reorganize human life,\nirrespectively of God and king\u2019? (1851, v. 1, 127; E., v. 1,\n100) It is from this perspective that his profound hostility towards\nclassical political philosophy \u2014philosophy that we continue to\nrespect today\u2014 has to be understood. With its insistence on\nfreedom of conscience and on the sovereignty of the people\n(souverainet\u00e9 populaire), the revolutionary doctrine\nhad no other function than to destroy the Ancien\nR\u00e9gime (founded on papal authority and monarchy by divine\nright). But in that task it had now succeeded. The moment had come for\nreconstruction, and it was hard to see how these weapons could be of\nuse in such work.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is not surprising that the young Comte\nturned to Saint-Simon. The latter, taking advantage of the relative\nfreedom of the press granted by Louis XVIII, published more and more\npamphlets and magazines, and therefore needed a collaborator. Comte\ntook over three ideas from the complex thought of Saint-Simon:\n\nThe contrast between organic and critical periods in history, of\nwhich the Revolution had just provided an example.\nThe idea of industrial society. In 1817, under the influence,\nnotably, of B. Constant and J.-B. Say, Saint-Simon had turned himself\ninto an apostle of industry. As an attentive observer of the\nindustrial revolution that was going on before his eyes, he understood\nthat it would completely change all existing social relations.\nHeretofore, we had lived in military societies: man acted on man, and\npower belonged to the warrior class. Henceforth, trade would replace\nwar, and man would mainly concern himself with acting on nature. Comte\ndrew the quite mistaken conclusion that the era of wars was over (Aron\n1957).\nThe idea of spiritual power. This is Comte\u2019s most obvious\ndebt to Saint-Simon. The theme was present from the first work by\nSaint-Simon (Letters from an Inhabitant of Geneva to his\nContemporaries, 1803) to the last (The New Christianity,\n1825). It resulted from an observation and a conviction. Saint-Simon\nobserved the role of science in modern society: he suggested, for\nexample, that public funds be made available to finance scientific\nresearch. He was also convinced of the religious nature of social\ncohesion and, therefore, of the need for a priestly class in charge of\nmaintaining it. This belief led him to the idea of a science of social\norganization, linking these two components: religion would become an\napplication of science, permitting enlightened men to govern the\nignorant. So, instead of trying to destroy every form of religious\nlife, one should entrust to the learned the spiritual power left\nweakened by the decline of traditional religions. It is also within\nthis framework that the text he wrote in 1814 on the reorganization of\nEuropean society has to be understood: handling international\nrelations are one of the main attributes of spiritual power, as shown\nby the medieval papacy.\n\n\nComte quickly assimilated what Saint-Simon had to offer him. But Comte\naspired to free himself of a tutelage that weighed ever heavier on\nhim, as he found the unmethodical and fickle mind of the self-taught,\nphilanthropic aristocrat barely tolerable. The break occurred in 1824,\noccasioned by a shorter work of Comte that would prove to be\nfundamental. Aware of already possessing the main ideas of his own\nphilosophy, Comte accused his teacher of trying to appropriate his\nwork and furthermore, he pointed out that he had not contented himself\nwith giving a systematic form to borrowed concepts (Bourdeau 2019).\nThe Philosophical Considerations on the Sciences and the\nScientists (1825) contains the first and classical formulations\nof the two cornerstones of positivism: the law of the three stages,\nand the classification of the sciences. The Considerations on\nSpiritual Power that followed some months later presents\ndogmatism as the normal state of the human mind. It is not difficult\nto find behind that statement, which may seem outrageous to us, the\nanti-Cartesianism that Comte shares with Peirce and that brings their\nphilosophies closer to one another. As the mind spontaneously stays\nwith what seems true to it, the irritation of doubt ceases when belief\nis fixed; what is in need of justification, one might say, is not the\nbelief but the doubt. Thus the concept of positive faith is brought\nout, that is to say, the necessity of a social theory of belief and\nits correlate, the logical theory of authority (Bourdeau 2011).\n\nIn the year 1826 two major events take place. First, Comte\u2019s\nprogram was reshaped. The first System of 1822 was\nunfinished, and writing the remaining part was one of Comte\u2019s\npriorities. But in 1826 he postponed that project for an indeterminate\nperiod. To provide a more solid base for the social science and its\nresulting positive polity, he decided first to go through the whole of\npositive knowledge again and to begin a course on positive philosophy.\nIt should be kept in mind that the Course does not belong to\nComte\u2019s initial program and that it originally was meant as a\nparenthesis, or prelude, that was supposed to take a few years at\nmost. The second major event of 1826, the famous \u2018cerebral\ncrisis\u2019 which occurred immediately after the opening lecture of\nthe course forced Comte to stop his public lessons; but it also had\nlongstanding effects. Thus it is customary to say that Comte received\npublic acknowledgement only belatedly: in 1842, with the first letter\nfrom Mill, and in 1844, with the articles of Littr\u00e9 in Le\nNational. But that amounts to forgetting that in 1826 Comte was a\nwell-known personality in the intellectual circles of Paris. Guizot\nand Lamennais held him in high esteem. The Course\u2019s\nattendance list included prestigious names such as A. von Humboldt,\nArago, Broussais or Fourier. Mill, who had visited Saint-Simon in\n1820\u201321, was deeply impressed by the first System,\nwhich one of Comte\u2019s pupils had introduced him to in 1829 (Mill\n1963, v. 12, 34). Finally, even though Comte had broken with\nSaint-Simon, the general public saw him as one of the master\u2019s\nmost authoritative spokesmen. This earned him the somewhat peculiar\nanimosity of the Saint-Simonians: they, with few exceptions, had the\ndistinctive characteristic of never having personally known the one\nthey called \u2018the father\u2019, whereas Comte had been on\nintimate terms with him. However, the cerebral crisis made Comte\nunable to take advantage of the high regard he enjoyed: he disappeared\nfrom the public scene until 1844.\n",
