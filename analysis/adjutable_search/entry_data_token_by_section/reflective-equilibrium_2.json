    "main_text": "Judgments || The Confidence Constraint\n1.2 The Confidence Constraint\n\nRawls proposes that \u201cwe can discard those judgments made with\nhesitation, or in which we have little confidence\u201d (Rawls 1971:\n47). In other words, considered judgments are subject to a\nconfidence constraint. Relatedly, Rawls frequently refers to\nconsidered judgments as \u201cconvictions\u201d (e.g., Rawls 1971:\n19\u201321, 45, 48, 53, 246, 318\u2013320, 447, 520, 580). The\nconfidence constraint extends to revisions of judgments,\nwhich must be made \u201cwith conviction and confidence\u201d (Rawls\n1974: 8). A more modest version of the confidence constraint is a\ncompromise between the ideal of accounting for all judgments and\npractical limitations (Scanlon 2003: 144).\n\nAn alternative view suggests that, if, as Rawls supposes, we are\ntrying to describe our moral capacity, it may appear self-defeating to\nexclude some of our moral judgments from consideration. Our lack of\nconfidence in some judgments means they are likely to be rejected\nduring the reflective process but gives no reason to dismiss them out\nof hand (Raz 1982: 318\u2013319). Such a move may increase rather\nthan decrease the distortion of moral sensibilities that reflective\nequilibrium is supposed to address (Knight 2017: 47\u201348).\nConsider someone with certain far right commitments, but not so far\ngone that they don\u2019t recognize some appeal to such values as\nequality and liberty, though they have little confidence in them or a\nclear idea of their contours. It may seem peremptory to exclude the\nunconfident judgments supporting these values from consideration in\nreflective equilibrium, where they might have found principled\nsupport.\n",
