    "main_text": "Motivations\n1. Motivations\n There are many reasons for philosophical interest in nonhuman\nanimal (hereafter \u201canimal\u201d) consciousness:\n First, if philosophy often begins with questions about the place\nof humans in nature, one way humans have attempted to locate\nthemselves is by comparison and contrast with those things in nature\nmost similar to themselves, i.e., other animals.  At least in the\nWest, the traditional \u2014 and perhaps still intuitive to many\npeople \u2014 way of thinking about consciousness is as primarily an\ninnate endowment of humans, which other animals may or may not share\nin virtue of being sufficiently like us. Within the traditional\nBiblical cosmology, while all animals were said to have arisen through\ndivine intentional creation, humans were the only ones created in the\nlikeness of the deity, and thus enjoyed a special, privileged role in\nthe intended workings of the cosmos \u2014 including, for example,\naccess to an eternal afterlife not overpopulated with fleas, ants and\nsnails. (See Lewis, 2009 Ch 9 for an in-depth treatment of the problem\nof animal consciousness in relation to Christian theology.) However,\nwithin a modern biological worldview, while humans may be unique in\ncertain (perhaps quite important) respects, we are only one species of\nanimal among many \u2014 one tip of one branch of the phylogenetic\ntree of life, and enjoy no particular special status. \nFrom an evolutionary perspective, consciousness is a trait that\nsome animals have (at least humans have it). Salient questions\ninclude: Is it a late evolved, narrowly distributed trait, or an older\nmore broadly shared trait? And, did it evolve only once, or a number\nof times independently? From this view point, the question \u201cAre\n(non-human) animals conscious?\u201d is rather strange, because, for\nexample, it implicitly groups bats together with rabbits (as\n\u2018nonhuman\u2019 animals) in contrast to humans. In reality,\nrabbits are more closely related to humans than they are to bats\n(Nishihara et al. 2006), so framing the question this way embeds a\nfalse presupposition. Of course, it is consistent with an evolutionary\nperspective that humans are the only conscious animals. This would\nimply that consciousness was acquired through a recent evolutionary\nevent that occurred since the split of our ancestral lineage from that\nof our closest non-human relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos (see\nsection 6 for discussion of such hypotheses). But such a view requires\nsupport; though perhaps intuitive to some, its choice as a default\nposition is arbitrary.\n Second, there is a lot at stake morally in the question of whether\nanimals are conscious beings or \u201cmindless automata\u201d. (See\narticle on the Moral Status of Animals.) Many billions of animals are\nslaughtered every year for food, use in research, and other human\npurposes. Moreover, before their deaths, many \u2014 perhaps most\n\u2014 of these animals are subject to conditions of life that, if\nthey are in fact experienced by the animals in anything like the way a\nhuman would experience them, amount to cruelty. Arguments that\nnon-human animals are not conscious therefore effectively double as\napologetics for our treatment of animals. When the question of animal\nconsciousness is under consideration, our guilt or innocence as a\ncivilization for an enormous body of cruelty may hang in the\nbalance. However, some philosophers have argued that consciousness per\nse does not matter for the treatment of animals, and therefore either\nthat a) even if animals are not conscious, they may deserve moral\nconsideration, or b) even if animals are conscious, they may not\ndeserve moral consideration. (For more discussion of the ethical\nissues, see Singer 1990 [1975]; Regan 1983; Rollin 1989; Varner 1998,\n2012; Steiner 2008.)\nThird, while theories of consciousness are frequently developed\nwithout special regard to questions about animal consciousness, the\nplausibility of such theories has sometimes been assessed against the\nresults of their application to animal consciousness (and, similarly,\nto human infants). This raises questions about the relative epistemic\nweight of theoretical considerations (e.g. philosophical arguments for\na given theory of consciousness) against particular case judgments or\nintuitions about whether a given creature is conscious. For example,\nSearle (1998) argues that our intuitive, commonsense attributions of\nintentional and emotional states to dogs carries more epistemic weight\nthan philosophically motivated skeptical concerns. In contrast,\nCarruthers (1989) asserts that his own arguments that nonhuman animals\n(even dogs) lack consciousness are sufficiently weighty that we are\nmorally obligated to eradicate or ignore our sympathetic feelings\ntoward such creatures. Should our theories of consciousness be\nconstrained by our intuitive attributions of consciousness to animals\n(or, e.g., babies), or should the former override the latter?\n\n\n Fourth, the problem of determining whether animals are conscious\n stretches the limits of knowledge and scientific methodology (beyond\n the breaking point, according to some).\n\nThe so-called \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d that took place\nduring the latter half of the 20th century has led to many innovative\nexperiments by comparative psychologists and ethologists probing the\ncognitive capacities of animals.  The philosophical issues surrounding\nthe interpretation of experiments to investigate perception, learning,\ncategorization, memory, spatial cognition, numerosity, communication,\nlanguage, social cognition, theory of mind, causal reasoning, and\nmetacognition in animals are discussed in the entry\non animal cognition. Despite this\nwork on cognition, the topic of consciousness per se in animals has\nremained controversial, even taboo, among many scientists, while other\nscientists from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds\n(e.g. neuroscience, animal behavior, evolutionary biology) have\ndeveloped novel ways of approaching the subject (see Boly et al. 2013 for a review).  The 2012\n Cambridge Declaration on Animal Consciousness \nindicates that many scientists agree that \u201cthe weight of evidence\nindicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological\nsubstrates that generate consciousness.\u201d However, other scientists,\nincluding Marian Stamp Dawkins, who has been prominent in the science\nof animal welfare (Dawkins 1985, 1993), are not ready to endorse the\nclaim, writing that, \u201cThe mystery of consciousness remains. The\nexplanatory gap is as wide as ever and all the wanting in the world\nwill not take us across it\u201d (Dawkins 2012, pp. 171\u2013172).\n\n\nMany philosophers and scientists have either argued or assumed that\nconsciousness is inherently private, and hence that one\u2019s own\nexperience is unknowable to others. While language may allow humans to\ncross this supposed gap by communicating their experience to others,\nthis is allegedly not possible for other animals.  Despite the\ncontroversy in philosophical and scientific circles, it remains a\nmatter of common sense to most people that some animals do have\nconscious experiences. Most people, if asked why they think familiar\nanimals such as their pets are conscious, would point to similarities\nbetween the behavior of those animals and human behavior \u2014 for\nexample, animals seem to visibly express pleasure and displeasure and\na variety of emotions, their behavior seems to be motivated by seeking\nfood, comfort, social contact, etc., they seem aware of their\nsurroundings and able to learn from experience. Similarity arguments\nfor animal consciousness thus have roots in common sense\nobservations. But they may also be bolstered by scientific\ninvestigations of behavior and the comparative study of brain anatomy\nand physiology, as well as considerations of evolutionary continuity\nbetween species. Neurological similarities between humans and other\nanimals have been taken to suggest commonality of conscious\nexperience; all mammals share the same basic brain anatomy, and much\nis shared with vertebrates more generally. Even structurally different\nbrains may be neurodynamically similar in ways that enable inferences\nabout animal consciousness to be drawn (Seth et\nal. 2005).  \n\n\nAs well as generic arguments about the connections among\nconsciousness, neural activity, and behavior, a considerable amount of\nscientific research directed towards understanding particular\nconscious states uses animals as proxies for humans.\nThe reactions of many animals, particularly other mammals, to bodily\nevents that humans would report as painful are easily and\nautomatically recognized by most people as pain\nresponses. High-pitched vocalizations, fear responses, nursing of\ninjuries, and learned avoidance are among the responses to noxious\nstimuli that are all part of the common mammalian heritage, and\nsimilar responses are also observable in organisms from a wide range\nof taxonomic groups (see section 7.1 below).\n\nMuch of the research that is of direct relevance to the treatment of\nhuman pain, including on the efficacy of analgesics and anesthetics,\nis conducted on rats and other animals. The validity of this research\ndepends on the similar mechanisms\n involved[1]\n and to many it seems arbitrary to deny that injured rats, who respond\nwell to opiates for example, feel\n pain.[2] \nLikewise, much of the basic research that is of direct relevance to\nunderstanding human visual consciousness has been conducted on the\nvery similar visual systems of monkeys.  Monkeys whose primary visual\ncortex is damaged even show impairments analogous to those of human\nblindsight patients (Stoerig & Cowey 1997) suggesting that the\nvisual consciousness of intact monkeys is similar to that of intact\nhumans.  Scientific demonstrations that members of\nother species, even of other phyla, are susceptible to the same visual\nillusions as we are (e.g., Fujita et al. 1991) suggesting\nthat their visual experiences are similar.\nIt is often argued that the use of animals to model\nneuropsychiatric disorders presupposes convergence of emotional and\nother conscious states and further refinements of those models may\nstrengthen the argument for attributing such states to animals. \nAn interesting reversal of the modeling\nrelationship can be found in the work of Temple Grandin, Professor of\nAnimal Science at Colorado State University, who uses her experience\nas a so-called \u201chigh-functioning autistic\u201d as the basis\nfor her understanding of the nature of animal experience (Grandin\n1995, 2004).\n\n\nSuch similarity arguments are, of course, inherently limited in that\nit is always open to critics to exploit some disanalogy\nbetween animals and humans to argue that the similarities don\u2019t entail\nthe conclusion that both are sentient. Even when bolstered by\nevolutionary considerations of continuity between the species, the\narguments are vulnerable, for the mere fact that humans have a trait\ndoes not entail that our closest relatives must have that trait too.\nThere is no inconsistency with evolutionary continuity to maintain\nthat only humans have the capacity to learn to play chess. Likewise\nfor consciousness. Povinelli & Giambrone (2000) also argue that\nthe argument from analogy fails because superficial observation of\nquite similar behaviors even in closely related species does not\nguarantee that the underlying cognitive principles are the same, a\npoint that Povinelli believes is demonstrated by his research into how\nchimpanzees use cues to track visual attention (Povinelli 1996). \n\n\nPerhaps a combination of behavioral, physiological and morphological\nsimilarities with evolutionary theory amounts to a stronger overall\ncase[3].\n However, a convincing argument will\nlikely also require motivation in terms of a well developed theory of\nthe structure and function of consciousness as a cognitive process\n\u2014 a route that many recent participants in the debate on animal\nconsciousness have pursued (see section 6).\n\n",
