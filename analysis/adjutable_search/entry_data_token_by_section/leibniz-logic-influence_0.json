Introduction\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s impact on the emergence of modern logic, be it\nmathematical, algebraic, algorithmic or symbolic logic, is an important\ntopic for understanding the emergence and development of the logic\npredominant today (on Leibniz\u2019s influence and reception cf.\nHeinekamp (ed.) 1986; on his influence in logic cf. Peckhaus 1997).\nHowever, the question whether Leibniz had any influence at all, or\nwhether his ideas were rather not more than ingenious anticipations of\nlater developments, is still disputed. The significance of this problem\ncan be shown by referring to Louis Couturat, who claimed that in\nrespect to the logical calculus Leibniz already had all the principles\nof much more recent logical systems of the algebra of logic (George\nBoole, Ernst Schr\u00f6der) and was even more advanced in some points\n(Couturat 1901, 386). But did early \u201cmodern\u201d logicians like\nBoole, Schr\u00f6der, or Frege have any knowledge of Leibnizian logic,\ni.e., could Leibniz have had any influence on these pioneers of modern\nlogic?\n\n\nThere are different answers to these questions. Wolfgang Lenzen,\ne.g., wrote that Leibniz was the most significant logician between\nAristotle and Frege, but despite the enormous significance of his\nlogic, he played hardly any role in the history of logic (Lenzen 2004a,\n15; cf. also Lenzen 2004b). According to Lenzen, Leibniz\u2019s mature\nlogical theory was present in his Generales Inquisitiones de\nAnalysi Notionum et Veritatum, which was only published in\nCouturat\u2019s edition of Leibniz\u2019s minor writings and\nfragments (Leibniz 1903, 356\u2013399). Couturat had already referred\nto it in his book on Leibniz\u2019s logic which had appeared two years\nearlier (Couturat 1901). We find similar evaluations by William and\nMartha Kneale, who in The Development of Logic rank\nLeibniz among \u201cthe greatest of all logicians,\u201d but stress\n\u201cthat his work on logic had little influence for nearly 200 years\nafter he wrote it\u201d (Kneale/Kneale 1962, 320). In the\nKneales\u2019 opinion, Leibniz had rather become notorious for\nclaiming to have made great discoveries in logic while there was little\npublished evidence for this claim.\n\n\nFor years Leibniz had written copiously on his many projects, but in\nthe form of notes or memoranda, and most of what he had written\nremained unpublished in the library of Hanover, where he had served the\nElector as historian, scientific advisor and expert on international\nlaw. (Ibid., 321)\n\n\nHeinrich Scholz, a great admirer of Leibniz and author of the first\nhistory of modern logic (Scholz 1931), argues along the same lines. For\nhim, Leibniz is the creator of logistic, i.e., modern formal logic\nusing logical calculi (Scholz 1931, 54, n. 9). Scholz reports that\nLeibniz inspired 18th-century logicians in Germany, above all Johann\nHeinrich Lambert (1728\u20131777) and Gottfried Ploucquet\n(1716\u20131790). But then he stresses (ibid., 56) that the logical\ncalculi created in the middle of the 19th century by the English logician Augustus De Morgan and George Boole living in Ireland were completely independent of\nLeibniz and German 18th-century research on logic. These calculi were amplified by the German mathematician Ernst Schr\u00f6der\nin his monumental Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(Schr\u00f6der 1890\u20131905).\n\n\nIf this thesis of the independence of 19th-century algebra of logic\nfrom Leibniz is accepted, it is possible to connect the discovery of\nLeibniz, the logician, with the Leibniz renaissance in early 20th\ncentury. In addition to Couturat\u2019s book La logique de Leibniz\nd\u2019apr\u00e8s des documents in\u00e9dits (1901), with a\npresentation of Leibniz\u2019s logic in the spirit of the new logic,\nthe following landmark publications have to be mentioned: Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of\nLeibniz (1900), providing an axiomatic deductive reconstruction of\nLeibnizian metaphysics, and Ernst Cassirer\u2019s Leibniz\u2019\nSystem in seinen wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen (1902), focussing\non a Neo-Kantian interpretation of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy.\nUndoubtedly, Couturat\u2019s edition of Leibniz\u2019s Opuscules\net fragments in\u00e9dits de Leibniz (Leibniz 1903), taken from\nthe manuscripts in the Royal Library in Hanover and published\nin 1903, gave for the first time access to the wealth of\nLeibniz\u2019s different approaches to logic.\n\n\nOther authors assign Leibniz a key role in the development of modern\nlogic. Eric J. Aiton, e.g., wrote that the Leibnizian project of a\nuniversal characteristic and the logical calculi resulting from it,\n\u201cplayed a significant role in the history of logic\u201d (1985,\nix). Franz Schupp, starting from Couturat\u2019s evaluation quoted\nearlier, assumed \u201cthat the Leibnizian logic might be relevant for\nthe further development of modern logic, beyond the historically\ninteresting aspect of an \u2018ingenious anticipation\u2019\u201d\n(Schupp 1988, 42). Schupp wrote that every step in the development of\nmodern logic led to new insights into the Leibnizian logic, but\nsometimes dealing with Leibniz influenced the development itself.\n\n\nIt seems to be in accord with the second position that the pioneers\nof modern logic themselves referred to Leibniz. George Boole\u2019s\nwidow, Mary Everest Boole, e.g., wrote that her husband, having been\ninformed of Leibniz\u2019s anticipations of his own logic, felt\n\u201cas if Leibnitz had come and shaken hands with him across the\ncenturies\u201d\n(M. E. Boole 1905, quoted in Laita 1976, 243).\nWilliam Stanley Jevons, who was\nresponsible for the great public success of modern logic in Great\nBritain after Boole, claimed that \u201cLeibnitz\u2019 logical tracts\nare [\u2026] evidence of his wonderful sagacity\u201d (Jevons 1883\n[1874], xix). Ernst Schr\u00f6der thought that Leibniz\u2019s ideal of\na logical calculus had been brought to perfection by George Boole\n(Schr\u00f6der 1877, III). The special controversy between Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der and Gottlob Frege which was at the root of the later\ndistinction between two kinds of modern logic, the algebra of logic and\nthe Frege-style mathematical logic, was centered on the question how\nfar the Leibnizian heritage was present in the respective variations of\nlogic. In his Begriffsschrift, Frege had written that the idea of a\ngeneral characteristic, of a calculus philosophicus or\nratiocinator was too ambitious to be achieved by Leibniz\nalone. Frege\u2019s own Begriffsschrift provides the first\nsteps towards this goal, which can be found in the formula languages of\narithmetic and chemistry (Frege 1879, VI). In his review of\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift, Schr\u00f6der (Schr\u00f6der\n1880, 82) objected that the title \u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d\npromises too much. According to Schr\u00f6der, Frege\u2019s system is\nless of a \u2018general characteristic\u2019 and more of a\ncalculus ratiocinator, and its development would have been\nsignificant, had it not already been achieved by others (esp. by\nBoole). Frege replied (Frege 1883, 1) that he did not intend to present\nan abstract logic in formulae like Boole, but to express contents by\nwritten signs in a more precise and clear manner than it would be\npossible by words. Therefore the Begriffsschrift is not a mere\ncalculus ratiocinator, but a lingua characteristica\nin the Leibnizian sense, although he accepted that inferential\ncalculation (schlussfolgernde Rechnung) was a necessary\nconstituent of the Begriffsschrift.\n",
