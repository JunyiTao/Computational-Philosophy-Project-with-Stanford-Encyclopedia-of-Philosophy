    "main_text": "Motivating Naturalism || Agreement\n4.4 Agreement\n\n\nTraditional philosophy, a naturalist might say, leads to endless\ndisagreement. Science and mathematics, on the other hand, usually reach\nbroad agreement\u2014often consensus\u2014on questions within\ntheir domain. Hence scientific or mathematical standards are to be\npreferred to others. (Such arguments from disagreement and lack of\nconvergence in opinion have featured prominently in other areas of\nphilosophy, notably meta-ethics.)\n\n\nHowever, the moral that the naturalist wishes to draw from patterns of\nagreement and disagreement seems unwarranted. Agreement or disagreement\nin a community is a contingent matter. A totalitarian state could\nachieve community-wide agreement with chilling efficacy by imposing\nsome preferred set of standards on its subjects. In general, there are\ncountless non-epistemic reasons for agreement or disagreement. It is\ntherefore not agreement that matters, but rather the explanation of why\nagreement obtains.\n\n\nA more sophisticated version of this argument might therefore be\nbased on the tractability of disagreement rather than on its mere\npresence. Disagreement is rife in both philosophy and science, but only\nin the latter, it might be said, is disagreement tractable. At the very\nleast, progress can be made and perhaps agreement can in principle\nalways be reached. Actual patterns of agreement and disagreement might\nthen be cited as evidence for the respective tractability or\nintractability of debates umpired by, say, scientific and\nnon-scientific philosophical standards.\n\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to assess this more\nsophisticated version of the argument, which in one form or\nanother has recently garnered considerable attention outside the\nphilosophy of mathematics. However, note a couple of prima facie difficulties.\n\n\nIn order to abstract from the contingencies of our epistemic\nsituation, arguments about tractability usually proceed by considering\nhighly idealised subjects, in particular subjects whose factual, logical, etc.\nknowledge far exceeds ours. But the problem with such idealisations is\nthat they seem question-begging. For example, a theological\nanti-naturalist would maintain that factually highly-informed subjects will\nbe apprised of facts about supernatural reality. Our grip on\nidealised subjects and how disagreement between them is likely to\nresolve itself may therefore be too loose to draw any substantive morals from such\nthought experiments. Either that or such arguments are likely to be question-begging. \n\n\nSecond, we may grant that considerations of tractability reveal that\nscientific and mathematical standards are more truth-conducive in their\nrespective spheres. Yet that does not seem to provide a warrant for\nthinking that they will be successful in other spheres. (This is the\nsame point we made in connection with the argument from success.)\n",
