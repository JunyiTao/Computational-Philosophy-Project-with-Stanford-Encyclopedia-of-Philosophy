    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nBorn in 121 CE and educated extensively in rhetoric and philosophy,\nMarcus Aurelius succeeded his adoptive father Antoninus Pius as Emperor of Rome in 161 CE and reigned until his own death in 180. His reign was troubled by attacks from Germany, rebellions in\nnorthern Italy and Egypt, and an outburst of the plague; at least part\nof the work for which he is famous, the Meditations, was\nwritten during the last years of his military campaigns. Aside from the Meditations Marcus\u2019 extant works include\nsome edicts, official letters, and some private correspondence,\nincluding a lengthy correspondence with his rhetoric teacher and\nlifelong friend, Fronto.[1] The private correspondence began before\nMarcus was twenty and continued into his imperial years. It includes\nwhat seem to be rhetorical exercises (for example, pieces in praise of sleep, and \nsmoke and dust) written when Marcus was still in his\n20s, an exchange about the value or disvalue of rhetoric to\nphilosophy written soon after Marcus became Emperor, and throughout,\npersonal information, frequently concerning illnesses, births, and\ndeaths in his own family.\n\n\nMarcus\u2019 chief philosophical influence was Stoic: in Book\nI of the Meditations, he records his gratitude to his Stoic teacher and\nfriend Rusticus for giving him Epictetus to read, and in a letter to\nFronto written between 145 and 147, he reports reading the 3rd c. BCE Greek Stoic Aristo of Chios\nand finding intense joy in his teachings, growing ashamed of his own\nshortcomings, and realizing that he can never again argue opposite\nsides of the same question, as required by rhetorical practice.\nThe Stoic influence, however, does not prevent Marcus from approvingly\nquoting Epicurus on ethical matters (as Seneca also had); in addition to\nEpictetus and Epicurus, Marcus quotes liberally from such figures as\nAntisthenes, Chrysippus, Democritus, Euripides, Heraclitus, Homer, and\nPlato. From Book I of the Meditations we also learn that\nMarcus\u2019 political heroes included republican opponents of\nkingship: he thanks his adoptive brother Severus not only for\nexemplifying the love of justice and the vision of a constitution based\non equality before the law, but also for the knowledge of Brutus\n(assassin of Julius Caesar), Cato, Dion (probably of Prusa), (Publius) Thrasea, and Helvidius (i.14). Consonant\nwith this, he warns himself to see to it that he does not become\n\u2018Caesarified\u2019 (that is, act like a dictator, vi.30).\n",
