Quine\u2019s place in the history of philosophy\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, many scientifically-oriented philosophers\ntended to assume some form of Logical Empiricism. One important aspect\nof Quine\u2019s influence on the course of philosophy is that he\ncalled that view or nexus of views into question (see section 3,\nabove). Some of his criticisms are detailed and technical. His target,\nhowever, was not a technical detail but the fundamental idea of\nLogical Empiricism, that there is a distinction between analytic\ntruths and synthetic truths which can account for a priori\ntruth. After Quine\u2019s work of the early 1950s, philosophers, even\nthose who did not accept his detailed arguments could no longer take\nit for granted that some form of Logical Empiricism is correct. This\nwas a very major change among scientifically-oriented\nphilosophers.\n\nQuine\u2019s rejection of Logical Empiricism leads him to two\n(connected) views which have been extremely influential. First, he\nrejects the idea of a distinction between philosophy on the one hand\nand empirical science on the other hand. To the contrary: he sees\nphilosophy as essentially in the same line of work as science, but\nmostly concerned with more theoretical and abstract questions. This is\nan integral part of his naturalism. Second, his criticism of Carnap,\nand of the Principle of Tolerance in particular, opens the way for\nsomething that might be called metaphysics: for very general\nreflections on the nature of the world, based on the best scientific\nknowledge that we have and on claims about how that knowledge might be\norganized so as to maximize its objectivity and clarity.\n\nBoth of these Quinean views, his naturalism and his acceptance of\nsomething like metaphysics, correspond to very important developments\nwithin analytic philosophy over the past half-century. His influence\nhas surely played a significant role here. (In the case of\nmetaphysics, in particular, it is notable that two leading figures,\nSaul Kripke and David Lewis, were students of Quine\u2019s.) For the\nmost part, however, those Quinean doctrines have led to work to which\nQuine himself would be strongly opposed.\n\nIn the case of naturalism, many philosophers have welcomed the idea\nthat they are free to use concepts and results drawn from empirical\nscience. Fewer have accepted that philosophy should also be\nconstrained by scientific standards of clarity, of evidence, and of\nexplanatoriness. The result is that while views which claim to accept\nnaturalism are common, those which accept Quine\u2019s standards of\nwhat counts as reputable naturalistic philosophy are not.\n\nThe case of metaphysics is similar but perhaps more extreme. Quine\naccepts that the philosopher is in a position to make very general\nclaims about the world (that there are sets but not properties, for\nexample). In his hands, such claims are answerable to the idea of a\ntotal system of our scientific knowledge, regimented so as to maximize\nclarity and systematicity. Many philosophers have welcomed the freedom\nto speculate about the nature of the world but have not accepted\nQuine\u2019s constraints on the process. The result is a flourishing\nof metaphysics, often based on ordinary (unregimented) language or on\nthe alleged deliverances of \u2018intuition\u2019; much of this work\nwould be anathema to Quine. (See Rosen 2014.)\n\nOn the one hand, then, Quine\u2019s work has been extremely\ninfluential and has done much to shape the course of philosophy in the\nsecond-half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. On the\nother hand, much of the work directly or indirectly influenced by\nQuine is of a sort that he would have thought quite misguided.\n",
