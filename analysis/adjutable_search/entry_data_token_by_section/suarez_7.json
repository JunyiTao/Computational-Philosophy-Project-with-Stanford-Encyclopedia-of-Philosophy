    "main_text": "Moral Theory and Natural Law\n3. Moral Theory and Natural Law\n\nSu\u00e1rez thus entered deeply into the metaphysical debates of his\nday. He was hardly, however, therefore indifferent to other, more\npractical areas of philosophy and society. Along with his fellow\nscholastic theologians, Su\u00e1rez was deeply interested in moral\nand social goodness and cared greatly about the sphere of human\naction. Also like his fellow scholastics, he tended to preface his\ntreatment of the moral goodness and badness of human actions with a\ndiscussion on the nature of the morality of action as such. The\nmorality of human actions, he held, is that by virtue of which a human\naction can contract the species of goodness or badness (De\nbonitate et malitia actuum humanorum, disp. 1, proem, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia IV). To use an analogy: there is\nbad art and good art, but there are also properties which make an\nobject a work of art, that is, an object which can be specified as\ngood or bad qua work of art. For Su\u00e1rez, in\ndistinction to some present-day moral theorists, the nature of an act\ncannot be divorced from the mode of its production; neither, then, can\nits normative evaluation.\n\nSu\u00e1rez operated in a context where the two main competing views\nof the nature of morality were that: (1) the morality of the act\nconsists in its being in principle able to conform to the external\nstandards provided by reason; and (2) the morality of the act belongs\nto the act itself, quite apart from any external standards.\n\nSu\u00e1rez, against V\u00e1zquez (V\u00e1zquez 1608: I, 414, d.\n73 c. 9 n. 43), held the second view. For him, the morality of the act\nconsists in its dependence on volition as the productive impetus\nbehind the act and on reason as the guiding set of rules that the\nagent takes herself to be guided by in shaping the precise\ncharacteristics of the act (De bonitate, sect. 2, n. 15).\nSu\u00e1rez provides the parallel of the production of an artefact.\nAn artefact can be evaluated by the standards applying to artefacts\n(say, beauty or ugliness), because its producer took herself to be\nguided, in the act of production, by the rules of her art (De\nbonitate, sect. 2, n. 17). The mode of production defines the\nnature of the object. Thus, two objects that look identical may be\nsusceptible to different standards of judgment, because one might be\nan artefact (say, a carved stone) and the other not (say, a stone\nwhich fell from a cliff and broke, resulting in the same shape as the\ncarved stone).\n\nFor Su\u00e1rez, it was important to argue that the morality of\nhuman action belongs to the act itself. This he regarded as a\nnecessary precondition to arguing that the moral goodness or badness\nof actions can be ascertained regardless of the presence of commanding\nor prohibiting divine law. If acts are to have pre-positive moral\nproperties, they must also have a pre-positive aptitude to be morally\ngood or bad.\n\nOperating within this basic framework of morality, Su\u00e1rez\ndeveloped a theory of natural law that has attracted much attention\ndespite his consciously attempting to position himself midway between\ntwo radically opposed views about natural law. There was, on the one\nhand, extreme naturalism, which he attributed to Gregory of Rimini\n(DL II, 6.3). According to extreme naturalism, the moral law\ndoes not require an exercise of legislative will by God. The natural\ngoodness and badness of actions exhaustively generates all our moral\nobligations. Even if God had not have given us laws, or even, indeed,\nif God had not existed at all, on the version of extreme naturalism\nfavored by Gregory of Rimini, all the presently existing moral duties\nwould still apply.\n\nAt the other extreme was the voluntarism attributed by Su\u00e1rez\n(rightly or wrongly) to William of Ockham and to a lesser extent also\nto Duns Scotus (DL I, 6.4). According to this view, actions\nhave no intrinsic (pre-positive) goodness or badness (or, even if they\nhave some goodness and badness, this does not determine or constrain\nwhat we ought to do). Obligations come from divine commands resulting\nfrom the free exercise of God's will. Further, in this view, God is\nentirely free as to the content of the moral law. Should God command\nus to hate him, then this is what we ought to do.\n\nAs is characteristic of his general approach to his predecessors,\nSu\u00e1rez disagrees with both views without wholly disregarding\neither. He agrees that natural law, if it is genuine\n\u201claw\u201d, requires an act of imperium, a command by\nthe legislator expressing his will. Therefore, any obligation falling\nunder natural law derives its moral force from God's legislative act\n(DL I, 5.13). In Su\u00e1rez's terminology, natural law is\nnot \u201cindicative\u201d; it is not merely a way of telling us\nabout what is good and what is morally bad in itself. Rather it is\n\u201cpreceptive\u201d: it creates obligations that would otherwise\nnot exist.\n\nSo far, then, Su\u00e1rez's position agrees with voluntarism. He\nalso, however, believes that what is naturally good is necessarily\ncommanded by God and what is naturally bad is necessarily prohibited.\nTherefore, the content of natural law, unlike its binding\nforce, does not have a positive source. Rather, it is dictated by\ncreated nature itself, to which God's commands respond.\n\nInterpreters disagree on whether Su\u00e1rez leaves room for\npre-positive moral duties (that is, moral duties which do not draw\ntheir binding force from God's commands) and on whether, if this is in\nfact the case, such duties are compatible with his general account of\nnatural law. At the center of the debate is Su\u00e1rez's assertion\nthat the performance of an intrinsically bad action constitutes\nsinning and involves culpa (guilt/blame) regardless of a\nprohibition from above. According to John Finnis, this amounts to\npositing the existence of pre-positive obligations incompatible with\nSu\u00e1rez's view that all law involves the expression of the will\nof a superior (Finnis 1980: 46\u201349). Thomas Pink construes\nSu\u00e1rez's theory of natural law in a way that aims to avoid the\nincoherence produced by pre-positive obligations. On his construal,\nthe expression of a superior's will gives us additional\nreasons to perform an act that is already obligatory by reason of its\nintrinsic moral properties (Pink 2005: 42). \n\nStill, thus far Finnis's charge of incoherence remains a threat. After\nall, Su\u00e1rez does say that the force to oblige (vis\nobligandi) can only come from an act of will. A solution\nis provided by Terence Irwin. In his reading, what intrinsic moral\nproperties of actions generate are not obligations, but rather duties\n(debita) (Irwin 2012). Obligations, unlike duties, involve a\nsort of \u201cmoral motion\u201d. The idea is that obligations\nconstitute an act of imposing an obligation, an obliging.\nObliging is the tool the holder of legitimate power has in order to\nmove those under his command to do some actions and refrain from\nothers. As is clear from Su\u00e1rez's discussions on the influx of\ndivine grace, God's grace moves us morally (rather than physically) by\nmaking the performance of some good actions more attractive to reason\nthan they would otherwise be (De Gratia Dei seu de Deo\nSalvatore, III.41.3, in Su\u00e1rez, Opera omnia\nVIII). Intrinsic goodness does not involve an obliging because it is\nnot impelling us to do anything; unlike the presence of law or the\neffect of grace, intrinsic goodness is not a new influx that was not\nthere before. But this is not to say that intrinsic goodness does not\nexert a rational attraction on moral agents; it is simply that our\nnatural tendency to do what is good is not the result of any sort of\nmoving or pushing. In this reading, there is no contradiction between\nmaking room for the existence of pre-positive duties and insisting\nthat obligations only originate in law. The distinction between\nobligations and duties is not merely a verbal one, but points to the\ndifference between what in Aristotelian terms would be an efficient\nand final cause of motion.\n\nIt emerges, then, that Su\u00e1rez's theory of natural law is less\ncomprehensive than some have thought: it covers, qua lawful,\nonly those \u201coughts\u201d that result from the command of the\nsuperior.\n",
