    "main_text": "Epistemology of Mathematics || Grasping Mathematical Concepts\n2.1 Grasping Mathematical Concepts\n\nMost Muslim thinkers who have talked about the epistemology of\nmathematical concepts believe that these concepts are formed through\nsome cognitive mechanisms whose first input is the data we receive\nthrough our external senses. The details of such mechanisms are\nspelled out in different ways by different philosophers, depending on\ntheir general picture of human cognitive psychology. For instance,\nAvicenna puts forward a thought experiment showing that no\nmathematical concepts can be grasped in the absence of sense\nperception (Avicenna [MPh], chap. VII.3, sec. 1; Zarepour 2019: sec.\n5; 2021, sec. 3). This indicates that Avicenna endorses some sort of\nconcept empiricism about mathematics. On the literalist interpretation\nof Avicenna\u2019s ontology of mathematics, mathematical objects\nexist in the sensible world as non-sensible connotational attributes\n(ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) of physical objects. Like all other\nconnotational attributes, mathematical entities are perceived by the\nfaculty of estimation. For instance, it is the faculty of estimation\nwhich perceives two-ness when we see two books. In such an experience,\nthe sensible data collected by the external senses would be\ntransferred to the faculty of estimation through the mediation of the\nfaculty of common sense (\u1e25iss mushtarak). Estimation\nenables us to overlook all other characteristics of the experience we\nhave had and to perceive two-ness that is not directly accessible to\nour external senses.\n\nEven on the literalist account of the ontology of mathematics, there\nare still many mathematical entities with which mathematicians might\nengage but which do not exist in the extramental world (e.g., a\ncomplex and extraordinary geometrical shape with no counterpart in the\nsensible world). Avicenna believes that the faculty of imagination\n(mutakhayyila) can construct mental images of such objects by\nanalyzing, synthesizing, separating, and combining the images of\nsimpler items that have previously been perceived by and stored in our\ncognitive faculties (Zarepour 2021: sec. 3). But if we endorse the\nabstractionist construal of Avicenna\u2019s ontology of mathematics,\nthen all mathematical objects are mental constructions. There\nexists no mathematical object in the extramental world which could\ndirectly be perceived by the estimation. On this interpretation, the\nfaculty of estimation cooperates with the faculty of imagination to\nproduce idealized objects, none of which has a counterpart outside our\nminds. It is the mental acts conducted by these faculties which enable\nus to construct geometric shapes and numbers (Ardeshir 2008; Tahiri\n2016; 2018).\n\nIn any case, since estimation is a bodily faculty, it cannot engage\nwith fully immaterial things. So, it perceives mathematical entities\nas things associated with matter (though not with specific species of\nit). The objects of estimation are not intelligible universal\nconcepts. So, the cognitive process of grasping mathematical concepts\nmust be completed by adding the Active Intellect to our story\n(Zarepour 2021). On one reading of Avicenna\u2019s epistemology\n(Nuseibeh 1989; Davidson 1992: chap. 4; Goodman 1992 [2006]; Black\n2014), the act of the faculty of estimation prepares our soul to\nreceive the universal concepts that will be emanated by the\nActive Intellect. On another account of Avicenna\u2019s epistemology\n(Hasse 2001; Gutas 2012), the Active Intellect is merely a reservoir\nof intelligible concepts to which we find access because of the\npreparatory and ineliminable function of the internal faculties. In\nsum, the acquisition of mathematical concepts is a process that begins\nwith sense perception and ends with the function of the Active\nIntellect. And between these two stages, the operation of the internal\nfaculties in general and the faculties of estimation and imagination\nin particular is necessary and inescapable.\n\nVery similar, though much less sophisticated, pictures of the\nprocedure of grasping mathematical concepts are presented in the works\nof Avicenna\u2019s contemporary scientists. For example, Ibn\nal-Haytham talks about only two faculties: imagination\n(takhayyula) and distinction (tamy\u012bz).\nImagination is the faculty which constructs idealized mathematical\nobjects according to the impressions that are left to us through our\nsense perceptions. For instance, imagination enables us to abstract\ngeometrical magnitudes from the sensible bodies we see in the external\nworld. However, the transition from the images of mathematical objects\nto mathematical concepts is something that must be carried out by the\nfaculty of distinction. This faculty plays a twofold role. On the one\nhand, it contributes to analyzing, synthesizing, separating, and\ncombining previously perceived (or produced images). This role is\nassigned to mutakhayyila in Avicenna\u2019s psychology. On\nthe other hand, the faculty of distinction is a replacement of the\nActive Intellect. In Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s philosophy, the final step\nof the conceptualization is carried out by the faculty of distinction.\nIt has been argued that the Active Intellect and the divine light do\nnot play any significant role in Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s theory of\nknowledge (Ighbariah & Wagner 2018).\n\nDeveloping an account more or less similar to that of Avicenna,\nal-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b accepts that some mathematical entities like\nlines and points exist in the physical world but they cannot be\ngrasped by our external senses. Nevertheless, the data we receive\nthrough our sense experiences enable us to perceive these objects\nand/or to produce idealized constructions that do not exist in the\nextramental world (Samian 2011). However, he does not seem to have a\nclear picture of cognitive psychology in which the roles of different\nfaculties are explicitly distinguished. That is why he wavers between\ntwo pictures, in one of which estimation (wahm) is the first\nfaculty to apprehend mathematical objects, while in the other, this\nrole must be played by intellect (\u02bfaql). On the latter\nview, nothing below the level of the intellect can perceive\nmathematical objects. Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b\u2019s hesitation\nbetween the two rival views becomes more apparent especially when we\naccept that both the Persian and Arabic versions of Kit\u0101b\nal-tafh\u012bm are written by himself. For instance, in the\nArabic version, he claims that points cannot be conceived by any\nfaculty other than the intellect (al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b [Astro]:\n3). By contrast, in the Persian version, he attributes this role to\nestimation (al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b [Instr]: 7). He does not seem to\nconsider any clear boundary between the intelligible\n(ma\u02bfq\u016bl) and the estimative\n(mawh\u016bm).\n\nIn the context of the theories of nafs al-\u02beamr proposed\nby later Muslim thinkers, external senses, estimation, and intellect\nall cooperate with each other to give us a conception of mathematical\nentities as they are in nafs al-\u02beamr. However, the\nprocess through which we can have access to and know about the realm\nof nafs al-\u02beamr is by no means less mysterious than the\nrole of the Active Intellect in Avicenna\u2019s philosophy.\n",
