    "main_text": "The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture || Racist Cultures\n4.2 Racist Cultures\n\nSome argue that the structural racism of modern European societies\n(and European-based societies such as the United States) is deeply\nembedded in their cultures and languages in ways that are concealed by\ntheir espousal of classical liberalism\u2019s dominant concepts of\nindividualism, equality, and freedom (Goldberg 1993, pp. 6\u20137; see also\nMills 2017). It is liberalism that espouses neutrality and\ncolor-blindness as ideal norms for social interaction, leading to an\nunwillingness to engage with racial realities in social institutions\nand economic outcomes. David Theo Goldberg argues that liberal cultures\nare racist in taking difference to be a problem requiring assimilation,\nintegration, and \u201cnormalization\u201d in Foucault\u2019s sense\nof a comparative ranking that justifies forcible conformity. People of\ncolor and non-European immigrants who reject the color-blind ideal are\nseen as not yet assimilated into advanced, modern ways of life, and\nthus incapable of self-governance. Every articulation of anti-racist\nrage and rebellion can then be cast aside as based in ignorance. If\nthese groups knew how to work within liberal democratic institutions\nand educational systems, some believe, they would be faring better with\nno need to rebel. In a sense, then, the suffering of nonwhites is\nviewed as self-caused by their inferior cultures, leading to a\nhegemonic acceptance of social inequality. The liberal view, as opposed\nto the conservative view, is distinguished only in that it sees this\ndeficiency as remediable with assimilation.\n\nA key element of Goldberg\u2019s approach is to highlight the\nmalleability of racial and racist discourses: just as liberalism has\nmorphed into neo-liberalism, with its emphasis on self-maximizing\nstrategies, individual responsibility, and punitive attitudes toward\nthose who cannot effectively monetize their talents, so old-school\nbiological racism morphs into cultural racism: the problem is not\nnonwhite genes but nonwhite cultures. Against those who take race to\nsimply mean biology, Goldberg holds that the language of race can\ncontinue its noxious effects without any recourse to \u201cbiological\nreference\u201d (1993, 11). Goldberg proposes that the West is made up\nof racist cultures so deeply committed to racism that new forms emerge\nas soon as old ones lose their power. Cultures are inherently dynamic,\ncounseling against a metaphysically inclined pessimism, but the\ndynamism and plasticity of racism requires permanent vigilance.\n\nGoldberg and Cornel West have independently made use of the\nFoucauldian concepts such as \u201cfields of discourse\u201d and\n\u201cepistemes\u201d to suggest that racial ideas are reinforced by\nloose coherence relations without logical entailments or causal\ndeterminism (West 1982). Familiar ways of organizing and achieving\nknowledge\u2014such as classification tables\u2014resonate across quite\ndifferent disciplines and projects and help to guide, and control, the\nformulation of intelligible objects and problematics. Human\ndifferences, West suggests, were mapped in the 18th and 19th centuries\nvia small visual variations to resonate with the ways in which\nbotanists organized typologies of flora and fauna, as if such mapping\nconstituted knowledge.\n\nDespite their variety, racist cultures tend to portray racial\nidentities and racism as natural in a way that obscures their\nhistorical construction. Although the 19th century theories and\npractices in regard to race have been discredited and largely rejected,\nthe ways in which race is approached today in both the social and\nnatural sciences retain some continuity with these problematic\nhistories, with disturbing effects: \u201cThe scientific cloak of\nracial knowledge, its formal character and seeming universality,\nimparts authority and legitimation to it\u201d (Goldberg 1993,\n149).\n\nFoucault\u2019s focus was on the ways in which knowledge projects\nare framed, confining those so defined \u201cwithin the constraints of\nthe representational limits\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 152). Such projects\nhave typically assumed that the most important goals are uplift,\nassimilation, and integration with whites rather than extending\ndemocracy or reformulating justice (Shelby 2018). Knowledge projects\nare themselves conducted in ways that can exacerbate epistemic\ninjustice: \u201cThe Other, as object of study, may be employed but\nonly as informant, as representative translator of\nculture\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 150; see also Narayan 1997 and Bayruns\nGarcia 2019). Concepts in use today such as \u201cghettos,\u201d\n\u201cganglands,\u201d \u201cinner cities,\u201d\n\u201cunderclass,\u201d and \u201cpuppet governments\u201d operate\nin a similar manner as older concepts like \u201csavages,\u201d\n\u201cprimitives,\u201d and \u201cbarbarians\u201d to reify and\nnaturalize peoples, neighborhoods, and cultures (Goldberg 1993,\n152\u2013155).\n\nResonating effects between the new language and the old does more than\nsupport their plausibility, as Goldberg points out:\n\u201cnoncontroversial meanings [of terms such as \u2018inner\ncity\u2019 or \u2018underclass\u2019] offer to their racialized\nones the aura of respectability, just as their racial connotations\nspill over silently, unself-consciously, and so unproblematically into\ntheir racialized ones\u201d (1993, 155). New meanings for old terms\ncan emerge as needed by new contexts and new social projects, but with\npersistently problematic connotations. The concept of the\n\u201cprimitive\u201d was originally intended to refer to ancient\nsocial groups from which contemporary human societies are descended;\nonly later did it become a synonym for the racially other and the\nculturally \u201cbackward\u201d. In this case the meaning remained\nstable while the referent group shifted. Ancient social groups that\nwere nomadic, polygamous, and communal rather than individualist were\nthen tagged onto nonwhite groups that exist today, such as indigenous\ngroups in Africa and Latin America. \n",
