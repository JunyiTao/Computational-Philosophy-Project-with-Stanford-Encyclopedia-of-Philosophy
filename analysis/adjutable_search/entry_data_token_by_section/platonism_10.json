    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Fictional Objects\n4.7 Fictional Objects\n\nFinally, a number of philosophers (see, most notably, van Inwagen\n(1977), Wolterstorff (1980), and Zalta (1983, 1988)) think that\nfictional objects, or fictional characters, are best thought of as\nabstract objects. (Salmon (1998) and Thomasson (1999) also take\nfictional objects to be abstract, but their views are a bit different;\nthey maintain that abstract fictional objects are created by humans.)\nTo see why one might be drawn to this view, consider the following\nsentence:\n\n(G) Sherlock Holmes is a detective.\n\n\nNow, if this sentence actually appeared in one of the Holmes stories\nby Arthur Conan Doyle, then that token of it would not be true \u2014\nit would be a bit of fiction. But if you were telling a child about\nthese stories, and the child asked, \u201cWhat does Holmes do for a\nliving?\u201d, and you answered by uttering (G), then it seems\nplausible to suppose that what you have said is true. But if it is\ntrue, then it seems that its singular term, \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019, must refer to something. What it refers to, according\nto the view in question, is an abstract object, in particular, a\nfictional character. In short, present-day utterances of (G) are true\nstatements about a fictional character; but if Doyle had put (G) into\none his stories, it would not have been true, and its singular term\nwould not have referred to anything.\n\nThere is a worry about this view that can be put in the following way:\nif there is such a thing as Sherlock Holmes, then it has arms and\nlegs; but if Sherlock Holmes is an abstract object, as this view\nsupposes, then it does not have arms and legs (because abstract\nobjects are non-physical); therefore, it cannot be the case that\nSherlock Holmes exists and is an abstract object, for this leads to\ncontradiction. Various solutions to this problem have been proposed.\nFor instance, Zalta argues that in addition to exemplifying\ncertain properties, abstract objects also encode properties.\nThe fictional character Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of\nbeing a detective, being male, being English, having arms and legs,\nand so on. But it does not exemplify any of these properties. It\nexemplifies the properties of being abstract, being a fictional\ncharacter, having been thought of first by Arthur Conan Doyle, and so\non. Zalta maintains that in English, the copula \u2018is\u2019\n\u2014 as in \u2018a is F\u2019 \u2014 is\nambiguous; it can be read as ascribing either property exemplification\nor property encoding. When we say \u2018Sherlock Holmes is a\ndetective\u2019, we are saying that Holmes encodes the\nproperty of being a detective; and when we say \u2018Sherlock Holmes\nis a fictional character\u2019, we are saying that Holmes\nexemplifies the property of being a fictional character. (It\nshould be noted that Zalta employs the device of encoding with respect\nto all abstract objects \u2014 mathematical objects, logical objects,\nand so on \u2014 not just fictional objects. Also, Zalta points out\nthat his theory of encoding is based on a similar theory developed by\nErnst Mally (1912).)\n\nThose who endorse a platonistic view of fictional objects maintain\nthat there is no good paraphrase of sentences like (G), but one might\nquestion this. For instance, one might maintain that (G) can be\nparaphrased by a sentence like this:\n\n\u2018Sherlock Holmes is a detective\u2019 is\ntrue-in-the-Holmes-stories.\n\n\nIf we read (G) in this way, then it is not about Sherlock Holmes at\nall; rather, it is about the Sherlock Holmes stories. Thus, in order\nto believe (G), so interpreted, one would have to believe in the\nexistence of these stories. Now, one might try to take an\nanti-platonistic view of the nature of stories, but there are problems\nwith such views, and so we might end up with a platonistic view here\nanyway \u2014 a view that takes sentences like (G) to be about\nstories and stories to be abstract objects of some sort, e.g., ordered\nsets of\n propositions.[14]\n Which of these platonistic views is superior can be settled by\ndetermining which (if either) captures the correct interpretation of\nsentences like (G) \u2014 i.e., by determining whether ordinary\npeople who utter sentences like (G) are best interpreted as talking\nabout stories or fictional characters.\n\nIt should be noted that some people who take fictional characters to\nbe abstract objects (e.g., Thomasson 1999) would actually agree with\nthe idea that (G) should be read in the above way \u2014 i.e., as a\nclaim about the Sherlock Holmes stories and not about Sherlock Holmes\nhimself. Thomasson\u2019s main argument for believing in fictional\ncharacters is based not on sentences like (G) but rather on sentences\nlike the following:\n\n(H) Some 19th century heroines are better developed than any 18th\ncentury heroines.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how to paraphrase this as being about a story,\nor even a bunch of stories. But, of course, one could still endorse a\nfictionalist (i.e., an error-theoretic) view of sentences like (H). In\nother words, one could admit that (H) is a claim about fictional\ncharacters and then one could claim that since there are no such\nthings as fictional characters, (H) is simply not true, although of\ncourse it might be true-in-the-story-of-fictional-characters,\nwhere this just means that it would have been true if there had been a\nrealm of fictional characters of the sort that platonists believe in.\n(Brock (2002) endorses a fictionalist view of fictional characters\nthat's similar in spirit to the view alluded to here.) \n",
