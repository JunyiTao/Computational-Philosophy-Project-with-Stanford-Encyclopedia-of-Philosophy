    "main_text": "Emphasis upon the Individual\n4. Emphasis upon the Individual\n\n\nA very important feature of Ibn Ezra\u2019s philosophy is its focus upon\nthe salvation of the individual. His expressions mark a major shift in\nreligious attitude. Traditional rabbinic Judaism, especially as\nreflected in the liturgy, had been concerned above all with the\ncollective redemption of the Jewish people. Sophisticated circles in\nJudaeo-Arabic culture of al-Andalus had, for at least a century before\nIbn Ezra, focused their soteriology instead on the ultimate felicity\nof the individual. It is very probable that in this issue, as in so\nmany others, Ibn Ezra\u2019s role was that of the transmitter. The crisp\nformulations scattered throughout his biblical commentaries and\ntopical booklets were far more accessible to the Jews of Christian\nEurope than the writings of other Jewish Andalusians, and they were\npivotal in the spread of this key idea.\n\n\nThe focus upon the salvation of the individual comes out clearly in\nthe opening sections of Yesod Mora.  Ibn Ezra critically\nreviews the different motivations people have for gaining expertise in\nthe Law. Some do it for prestige, but this leads to social\nfriction.  Others study the Law in order to improve society. This is\ncommendable; however, this implies that in a just society, the Law\nwould be superfluous. We can carry Ibn Ezra\u2019s reasoning further: the\nLaw must have some ultimate justification that is invariant over any\nand every social or historical situation. With this in mind, we can\nsee the connection to the next point raised in the passage, which is\nthis: many laws of the Torah are rarely if ever applied. How, then,\nthe reader is led to wonder, can the Law be an end in itself for\nJewish life?  Moreover, Ibn Ezra asks, how many legal experts do we\nneed anyway?\n\n\nTwo conclusions follow from this series of arguments. First, Torah\nstudy, in the sense of mastery of all the fine points of the Law, can\nnot be the ultimate purpose of our existence. Second, the ultimate\npurpose does not lie in one\u2019s contribution to the community. Ibn Ezra\nis now ready to state what the goal of life is:\n\n\n\u201cThe person (ha-adam) must set himself aright. He must\nknow the commandments of God, Who created everything. He must try with\nall of his strength to understand [God\u2019s] works\u2014then he will\nknow his Creator\u2026and when he knows Him he will find favor in\nHis eyes.\u201d After citing some biblical prooftexts\u2014standard\nfare by then in the Arabic speaking communities for the view that\nknowledge is the true form of worship\u2014Ibn Ezra sums up: \u201cIt is\nfor this reason that man was created. Once one has rectified oneself,\nhe may set others aright, if this be possible\u201d (Cohen 2002,\n83\u201384).\n\n\nOn the face of it, then, Ibn Ezra conforms to the tradition that the\nTorah gives meaning to life. However, the Law is now just one of God\u2019s\nhandiworks, and not necessarily the most important of them. Ibn Ezra\nclearly subscribes to the view then current among philosophers that\nthe purpose and goal of human existence is to know God. This\nresponsibility devolves upon each individual; it is not a communal\nproject and, indeed, Ibn Ezra evinces no interest in the \u201cideal\ncity\u201d.  However, he merely states this goal; he has no theory of\nthe intellect, no refined or even coarse epistemology. He has in\neffect grossly devalued Torah study, but he has done this in a way\nthat is not abrasive. (In fact, there is a long-standing controversy\nas to how much \u201cTorah\u201d Ibn Ezra himself knew.) This is a\nclassic example of the way Ibn Ezra quietly if not elegantly\ninsinuates radical views into the tradition. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",
