    "main_text": "Back to the Harm Principle\n6. Conclusion\n\nLiberals tend to justify freedom generally, and free speech in\nparticular, for a variety of reasons. According to Mill, free speech\nfosters authenticity, genius, creativity, individuality and human\nflourishing. He tells us that if we ban speech the silenced opinion\nmay be true, or contain a portion of the truth, and that unchallenged\nopinions become mere prejudices and dead dogmas that are inherited\nrather than adopted. These are empirical claims that require evidence.\nIs it likely that we enhance the cause of truth by allowing hate\nspeech or violent and degrading forms of pornography? It is worth\npondering the relationship between speech and truth. If we had a graph\nwhere one axis is truth and the other is free speech, would we get one\nextra unit of truth for every extra unit of free speech? How can such\na thing even be measured? It is certainly questionable whether\narguments degenerate into prejudice if they are not constantly\nchallenged. Devil's advocates are often tedious rather than useful\ninterlocutors. Sometimes supporters of free speech, like its\ndetractors, have a tendency to make assertions without providing\ncompelling evidence to back them up. None of this is meant to suggest\nthat free speech is not vitally important: this is, in fact, precisely\nthe reason we need to find arguments in its favour. But regardless of\nhow good these arguments are, some limits will have to be placed on\nspeech. \n\nWe have found that the harm principle provides reasons\nfor limiting free speech when doing so prevents direct harm to rights.\nThis means that very few speech acts should be prohibited. It might be\npossible to broaden the scope of this principle, as Waldron attempts\nto do, to include things other than harmful rights violations.\nFeinberg's version of the offense principle has a wider reach than the\nharm principle, but it still recommends very limited intervention in\nthe realm of free speech. All forms of speech that are found to be\noffensive but easily avoidable should go unpunished. This means that\nmuch pornography and hate speech will escape censure.\n\nIf these arguments are acceptable, it seems reasonable to extend them\nto other forms of behavior. Public nudity, for example, does not cause\nserious harm and if it does offend some people it is at most a bit\nembarrassing, and is avoided by averting one's eyes. The same goes\nwith nudity, sex, and coarse language on television. Turning off the\ntelevision provides instant relief from the offense. Neither the harm\nor the offense principles as outlined by Mill and Feinberg support\ncriminalizing most drug use, nor the enforcement of seat belts, crash\nhelmets and the like.\n\nSome argue that speech can be limited for the sake of other liberal\nvalues, particularly the concern for democratic equality. This\nargument, unlike those based on harm and offense, has the potential to\nallow significant limits on pornography and hate speech. The claim is\nnot that speech should always lose out when it clashes with equality,\nbut it certainly should not be automatically privileged. To extend\nprohibitions on speech and other actions beyond this point requires an\nargument for a form of legal paternalism that suggests the state can\ndecide what is acceptable for the safety and moral instruction of\ncitizens, even if it means limiting actions that do not cause harm or\nunavoidable offense and which do not undermine democratic equality.\n\n\nIt has certainly been the practice of most societies, even\nliberal-democratic ones, to impose some paternalistic restrictions on\nbehavior and to limit speech that causes avoidable offense. Hence the\nfreedom of expression supported by the harm principle as outlined in\nChapter One of On Liberty and by Feinberg's offense principle\nhas yet to be realised. It is up to the reader to decide if such a\nsociety is an appealing possibility.\n",
