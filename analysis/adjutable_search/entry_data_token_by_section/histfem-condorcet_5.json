    "main_text": "The Rights of Women || A Bold Defense of Women\u2019s Rights\n4.2 A Bold Defense of Women\u2019s Rights\n\nIn contrast to his 1787 work, in which women\u2019s rights are part of a\nlarger consideration of the elements of a just constitution,\nCondorcet\u2019s 1790 essay Sur l\u2019admission des femmes au droits de la\ncit\u00e9 [On the Admission of Women to the Rights of\nCitizenship] stands as one of the most concise and potent defenses of\nwomen\u2019s rights in the entire history of feminist thought. It also\nneeds to be set within the context of the monumental events that began\nin 1789 and led up to the adoption by the newly elected national\nassembly of the Constitution of 1791. By the terms of the 1791\nConstitution of the new constitutional monarchy, as already briefly\nobserved, the population was divided between active and passive\ncitizens on the basis on the basis of wealth, thereby excluding the\nlarge majority of male citizens from full political participation.\nComplicated suffrage provisions restricted popular influence further.\nHowever, the new laws also categorized all women (without exception)\nas passive citizens, a departure from old r\u00e9gime legal practice\nwhereby women could sometimes vote and act as regents. In addition to\nbarring women from the voting process or from serving as magistrates\nor elected representatives, only men were granted the privilege of\nserving in the newly formed militias, an increasingly important\nfunction of republican citizenship during these same years. Gender\ndivisions would, if anything, become even more pronounced after 1792\nwhen the monarchy was abolished and France became a republic, the\ndivisions between active and passive male citizenship were removed,\nand universal male suffrage established but nothing was done to alter\nwomen\u2019s secondary political status before the law. Yet from the outset\nof the Revolution in 1789, in practice women were far from being\nwholly \u201cpassive\u201d. Many militated for rights and\nparticipated actively in the clubs and societies of the revolutionary\npublic sphere.\n\nCondorcet was not alone in recognizing the manifest contradiction\nbetween the principles of natural rights and reason, on the one hand,\nand the exclusion of women from full political rights, on the other.\nNor was he the only one to link the question of female citizenship to\nthe demand for rights by other groups like Jews, Protestants, and\nmulattos, whose political and civil rights had been curtailed under\nthe old r\u00e9gime, or even to the radical demand for slave\nemancipation. Some politically active women protested for improvements\nin women\u2019s condition, and even demanded woman\u2019s right to bear arms.\nThe Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des amis de la\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9 [Confederation of the Friends of Truth] was\nthe first club to admit women as regular members and the first to\nestablish a separate women\u2019s section. The club campaigned in support\nof divorce, and engaged in a heated debate over member Etta Palm\nd\u2019Aelder\u2019s speech calling on men to devote their full attention to the\nproblem of women\u2019s rights, insisting \u201cwe are your companions not\nyour slaves\u201d (Etta Palm d\u2019Aelders, Appel aux\nfran\u00e7oises sur la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des moeurs\net la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019influence des femmes dans un\ngourvernement libre [Appeal to the French concerning the\nRegeneration of Morals and the Necessity for Women\u2019s Influence in a\nFree Government], cited in Kates 1985, 123\u20134). Among the other\nissues taken up by Palm and her confederates in the women\u2019s section\nwere elimination of primogeniture, protection against wife beating, a\ncomprehensive divorce bill, and political equality for women. Palm\nconceived of a Parisian and nationwide system of affiliated clubs to\ncare for and educate children and clinics for indigent women. As early\nas October 1789, the playwright Olympe de Gouges proposed a reform\nprogram to the National Assembly that encompassed legal sexual\nequality, admission for women to all occupations, and the suppression\nof the dowry system through a state-provided alternative. In her 1791\nD\u00e9claration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne\n[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and Female Citizen], Gouges\nrejoices in the natural equality of all human beings and decries the\nhypocrisy of denying people on the basis of race and sex the inherent\nrights to which they are owed. Although always a minority position,\nstill other voices were raised inside and outside France on behalf of\nfull equality, perhaps most famously Mary Wollstonecraft in her\nequally eloquent 1792 treatise The Vindication of the Rights of\nWoman.\n\nCondorcet opens his 1790 essay with a powerful indictment of his\n\u201cmost enlightened\u201d compatriots, above all those\nphilosophers and legislators who speak and legislate on behalf of the\nprinciple of human rights, yet deny those rights to one-half of the\nhuman race:\n\nHabit can so familiarize men with violations of their natural rights\nthat those who have lost them neither think of protesting nor believe\nthey are unjustly treated. Some of these violations even escaped the\nnotice of the philosophers and legislators who enthusiastically\nestablished the rights common to all members of the human race, and\nmade these the sole basis of political institutions. Surely they were\nall violating the principle of equal rights by debarring women from\ncitizenship rights, and thereby calmly depriving half of the human\nrace of the right to participate in the formation of the laws. Could\nthere be any stronger evidence of the power of habit over enlightened\nmen, than the picture of them invoking the principle of equal rights\nfor three or four hundred men who had been deprived of equal rights by\nan absurd prejudice, and yet forgetting it with regard to 12 million\nwomen. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335)\n\n\nCondorcet argues that without the inclusion of women, the nation would\nhave no recourse to a \u201cfree constitution\u201d. Recognizing the\nshift that has occurred in France in grounding rights in individual\nproperty, he calls attention to the fact that \u201cthe elective\nassemblies of our bailiwicks gave to feudal rights that which they\nrefused to natural rights. It is to women that several of our noble\ndeputies owe the fact that they sit amongst the national\nrepresentatives\u201d. Indeed he advises that rather than depriving\nfemale feudal property owners of their former rights, would it not be\nbetter to extend to all female property owners and heads of households\nthe same rights that men have now achieved? \u201cWhy, if we consider\nit absurd to exercise citizenship rights by proxy, should we deprive\nwomen of this right, instead of giving them the freedom to exercise it\nin person?\u201d The irony, he recalls, is that before 1776 \u201ca\nwoman could rule France [as a regent?] and yet, before 1776 (when\nTurgot\u2019s abolition of the guilds were introduced), she could not\nbecome a dressmaker in Paris [without her husband\u2019s assistance]\u201d\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 339). Truly throwing down the gauntlet, he\ninsists that unless it can be proven that \u201cthe natural rights of\nwomen are not exactly the same as those of men\u201d, then the new\nnation is guilty of constituting itself on an \u201cact of\ntyranny\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337, 335).\n\nFollowing this pointed accusation, he proceeds to argue for women\u2019s\nrights in the manner already put forward in his 1787 discussion,\nalthough here he explicitly joins women\u2019s rights to the rights of\nreligious and racial minorities\u2014no doubt hoping that men of\nreason will join his cause, even if slave owners and Catholic\nextremists are likely to oppose it:\n\nThe rights of men stem exclusively from the fact that they are\nsentient beings, capable of acquiring moral ideas and of reasoning\nupon them. Since women have the same qualities, they necessarily also\nhave the same rights. Either no member of the human race has any true\nrights, or else they all have the same ones; and anyone who votes\nagainst the rights of another, whatever his religion, colour or sex,\nautomatically forfeits his own. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335)\n\n\nOnce again, however, Condorcet is forced to consider strongly held\nviews about the social implications of women\u2019s bodies. He argues that\nneither women\u2019s duties nor their bodies ought to disqualify them from\nparticipating in the public sphere. He begins with the trivial and\nmoves to more serious objections, first comparing the inconveniences\nof motherhood to such \u201cmonthly indispositions\u201d as gout and\nthe common cold. On a more serious note, he observes, \u201cpeople\nargue that, differences in education apart, men are still naturally\nmore intelligent than women, but this is far from being proven, and\nwould have to be before women could justly be deprived of a natural\nright\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335). Again he reprises his\nformer arguments regarding women\u2019s genius and the inappropriate link\nbetween genius and the legitimate exercise of rights: Even if the\ncharge of women\u2019s lack of demonstrated genius were true, which he\ndoubts, \u201cwe would hardly attempt to limit citizenship rights\nonly to men of genius\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 335). Granting\nthe existence of a small fraction of men possessing true genius, he\nstates, \u201cthis small class apart, both sexes have an equal share\nof inferior and superior minds\u201d, thus there is no more reason to\nexclude women from the exercise of rights than there would be to\nexclude the vast majority of men. He mobilizes the examples of Queen\nElizabeth of England, Marie Theresa of Austria, and the two Catherines\nof Russia as ample proof that \u201cwomen lack neither strength of\nmind nor the courage of their convictions\u201d. And in a playful\nparagraph he deliciously debunks the great evils done by a host of\nsupposedly great men, asking whether such women as Catherine Macaulay,\nMarie le Jars de Gournay, Marie-Anne de la Tremoille, princess of\nUrsins, Mme du Ch\u00e2telet, or Mme de Lambert would have undermined\nfreedom of conscience or the rights of citizens, attacked a free\nconstitution, or passed such \u201cabsurd and barbarous laws \u2026\n[as those] against protestants, thieving servants, smugglers and\nnegroes?\u201d In sum, he observes, \u201cMen have no real reason to\nbe so proud when they cast their eyes over the list of those who have\ngoverned them\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336).\n\nCondorcet rejects the claim that \u201cwomen have never based their conduct\non what is called reason,\u201d insisting that \u201cthey may never have behaved\naccording to the reason of men; but they do behave according to their\nown reason\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336). While allowing for the\npossibility that women may have their own reason, a different reason\nfrom that of men, still Condorcet meets his compatriot\u2019s strong\nobjections that women reason differently or perhaps do not reason at\nall by advocating raised educational standards, improved laws, and the\nequalization of the social circumstances endured by the sexes. Only\nwith these reforms, he insists, will women come to escape the pull of\nvanity and self-interest, to which they are doomed in the present, and\ncome to respond to the demands of justice and positive law. As for\nwhatever residual differences between the sexes might still remain,\nCondorcet finds in them a comprehensible logic:\n\n\nThe fact that they [women] base their conduct on different principles\nand set themselves different aims does not mean that they are\nirrational. It is as reasonable for a woman to concern herself with\nher facial charms as it was for Demosthenes to cultivate his voice and\ngestures. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 336\u20137)\n\n\nWhether it is a question of admirable or contemptible qualities,\nCondorcet does not blame women\u2019s nature but rather points to their\nupbringing, to which he attributes their ignorance and superstition.\nBecause women are blocked from exercising real power, they resort to\nusing illicit influence. If it is true that women are less egoistic\nand hardhearted, more gentle and sensitive than men, he credits this\nto their socialization as well as to their overly protected lives:\n\n\nThey have no experience of business, or of any matter which is decided\nby positive laws or rigorous principles of justice; the areas which\nconcern them and where they are active are precisely those which are\ngoverned by feelings and natural decency. It is quite unfair to\njustify continuing to refuse women the enjoyment of their natural\nrights on grounds which are plausible only precisely because they do\nnot enjoy those rights. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337)\n\n\nIn an insightful observation concerning the patriarchal arrangements\nof his day, Condorcet asserts: If it is true that women are unduly\ninfluenced by their husbands, on whom they are dependent, this cannot\nbe grounds for their exclusion \u201cbecause we could destroy this\ntyrannical civil law \u2026 [and] One injustice must never become a\nreason to commit another\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337).\n\nCondorcet looks to education and publicity to eliminate the secret\nsway that royal mistresses and some other old r\u00e9gime women had\nexercised. He argues that whatever influence women have, it is far\nmore of \u201ca threat if it acts in secret than if it acts in a\npublic debate\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337). By becoming\npublic, the undue influence of one person over another would\nnecessarily lose its sway. At the same time, he counsels that the same\narguments used to deprive women of their rights could easily be used\nagainst laborers\u2014\u201canyone who was obliged to work\nconstantly and could therefore neither become enlightened nor exercise\nhis reason. Before long, citizenship would be open only to men who had\ncompleted a course of public law \u2026\u201d Adopting what was\nfast-becoming the most damning slogan of republicans during the\nRevolution, he charges that \u201call aristocracies were\nformed or justified by this kind of pretext [my emphasis]\u201d\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 337). Certainly, he was not alone in leveling\nthe charge of aristocracy in relation to gender equality. For example,\nas early as 1789, a radical tract appeared, entitled Requ\u00eate\ndes Dames \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e Nationale [The Ladies\u2019\nRequest to the National Assembly], which protested the\n\u201cmasculine aristocracy\u201d being established by the Assembly,\nand proposed it be decreed that \u201call the privileges of the male\nsex are entirely and irrevocably abolished throughout France; [and\nthat] the feminine sex will always enjoy the same liberty, advantages,\nrights, and honors as does the masculine sex\u201d (A. Soboul, 1982;\ncited and translated in K. Offen 2000, 54\u201355). Similarly, Olympe\nde Gouges exclaimed:\n\n\nMan, are you capable of being just? It is a woman who poses the\nquestion; you will not deprive her of that right at least. Tell me,\nwhat gives you sovereign empire to oppress my sex? \u2026. Man alone\nhas raised his exceptional circumstances to a principle. Bizarre,\nblind, bloated with science and degenerated\u2014in a century of\nenlightenment and wisdom\u2014into the crassest ignorance, he wants\nto command as a despot a sex which is in full possession of its\nintellectual faculties; he pretends to enjoy the Revolution and to\nclaim his rights to equality in order to say nothing more about it.\n(Gouges 1791).\n\n\nFinally, then, Condorcet arrives at the most intransigent of\nobjections to women\u2019s freedom, those based on utility. What if by\ngaining rights women would be tempted to abandon their domestic\naffairs? What if female citizens would move beyond a relatively\npassive exercise of rights to assume the reigns of government?\nCondorcet insists that appeals to utility have been abused, serving\noften as mere pretexts of tyrants for denying \u201ca true\nright\u201d and resulting in such crimes as the enslavement of\nAfricans, the imprisonment of innocents at the Bastille, the\ncensorship of the press, and the exploitation of workers in trade and\nindustry. However, he also finds it necessary to go beyond merely\nanswering utilitarian objections to women\u2019s equality by assuaging\nmen\u2019s fears. As a result, and even if for only tactical reasons, he\nends up making a decisive concession to his opponents. So, he\nreassures men,\n\nthere is no need to fear that, just because women would be members of\nthe National Assembly, they would immediately abandon their children,\ntheir homes and their needlework. In fact, this would only make them\nbetter able to raise their children and to make men of them. It is\nnatural for a woman to nurse her children and for her to look after\nthem when they are young. Forced by this to stay at home and weaker\nthan men, it is also natural that she lead a more secluded, more\ndomestic life. Women therefore fall into the same category as men who\nneed to work for several hours a day. This may be a reason not to\nelect them, but it cannot form the basis of a legal exclusion.\nChivalry may lose out by this change, but domestic life would gain\nfrom this equality, as from all others.
