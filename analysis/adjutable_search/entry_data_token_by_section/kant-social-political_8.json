    "main_text": "Cosmopolitan Right\n10. Social Philosophy\n\n\u201cSocial philosophy,\u201d can be taken to mean the relationship\nof persons to institutions, and to each other via these institutions,\nthat are not part of the state. Family is a clear example of a social\ninstitution that transcends the individual but has at least some\nelements that are not controlled by the state. Other examples would be\neconomic institutions such as businesses and markets, religious\ninstitutions, social clubs and private associations created to advance\ninterests or for mere enjoyment, educational and university\ninstitutions, and social systems and classifications such as race and\ngender. It is worth noting a few particulars, if only as examples of\nthe range of this topic. Kant favored right-governed free markets that\nallowed people to choose and pursue their ends, but advocated the duty\nof citizens to support those in society who could not support\nthemselves, and even gave the state the power to arrange for this help\n(6:326). He offered a biological explanation of race in several essays\nand also, certainly into his \u201cCritical\u201d period, held that\nother races were inferior to Europeans, although he did late in his\ncareer insist that non-European peoples possessed full political\nrights. He supported a reform movement in education based on the\nprinciples presented by Rousseau in \u201cEmile\u201d. I will not\nprovide detailed treatment of Kant\u2019s views on these particular\nmatters (some of which are scant) but only focus on the nature of\nsocial philosophy for Kant.\n\nKant had no comprehensive social philosophy. One might be tempted to\nclaim that, in line with natural law theorists, Kant discusses natural\nrights related to some social institutions. One might read the first\nhalf of the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d as a social philosophy,\nsince this half on \u201cPrivate Right\u201d discusses the rights of\nindividuals relative to one another, in contrast to the second half on\n\u201cPublic Right\u201d that discusses the rights of individuals\nrelative to the state. Kant even offers an explanation of this\ndifference by claiming that the opposite of state of nature is not a\nsocial but the civil condition, that is, a state (6:306). The state of\nnature can include voluntary societies (Kant mentions domestic\nrelations in general) where there is no a priori obligation for\nindividuals to enter them. This approach to Kant, however, is subject\nto some doubt, since he explicitly links all forms of property to the\nobligation to enter the civil condition (see section 5 above), and his\ndiscussion of marriage and family comes in the form of property\nrelations akin to contract relations. It is thus not obvious how\nKant\u2019s explanations of these social institutions, which presuppose\nproperty relations, could apply to social philosophy independent of\nthe state. Thus even if some form of family or household or\nproperty-like institutions could exist outside the civil condition,\nKant does not discuss them.\n\nAnother approach to the issue of social philosophy in Kant is to view\nit in terms of moral philosophy properly speaking, that is, the\nobligations human beings have to act under the proper maxims, as\ndiscussed in the \u201cDoctrine of Virtue\u201d (see section 1\nabove). In the \u201cDoctrine of Virtue\u201d Kant talks about the\nobligation to develop friendships and to participate in social\nintercourse (6:469\u201374). In the Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason Kant discusses the development of an\n\u201cethical commonwealth\u201d in which human beings strengthen\none another\u2019s moral resolve through their participation in the\nmoral community of a church. He also holds that educational\ninstitutions, the subject of his book On Pedagogy, should be\ndesigned to provide for the development of morality in human beings,\nwho lack a natural disposition for the moral good. In these cases\nKant\u2019s social philosophy is treated as an arm of his theory of\nvirtue, not as a freestanding topic in its own right.\n\nA third approach to social philosophy comes through Kant\u2019s\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Kant had\nenvisioned anthropology as an empirical application of ethics, akin to\nempirical physics as a application of pure metaphysical principles of\nnature. Knowledge of the general characteristics of human being as\nwell as particular characteristics of genders, races, nationalities,\netc, can aid in determining one\u2019s precise duties toward\nparticular individuals. Further, this knowledge can aid moral agents\nin their own task of motivating themselves to morality. These promises\nof anthropology in its practical application are unfulfilled, however,\nin the details of Kant\u2019s text. He does little critical\nassessment of social prejudices or practices to screen out stereotypes\ndetrimental to moral development. His own personal views, considered\nsexist and racist universally today and even out of step with some of\nhis more progressive colleagues, pervade his direct discussions of\nthese social institutions.\n",
