    "main_text": "A New Law of Thought || The Paradox of Predication\n2.1 The Paradox of Predication\n\nIn her autobiography, Jones wrote of an early fascination with issues\nrelated to the nature and structure of content:\n\nThis unsettled question\u2014what is asserted when you make a\nstatement, and what is the proper form of statement?\u2014had\ndeeply interested me from the time when I was a student and puzzled\nover Mill\u2019s and Jevons\u2019 accounts of propositions. (Jones\n1922: 71)\n\n\nPart of what fascinated her concerned (what I\u2019ll call) the\nparadox of predication\u2014a paradox that Jones traced to\nPlato\u2019s Sophist. To understand Jones\u2019s main\ncontributions to philosophical logic, it is useful to review Hermann\nLotze\u2019s influential discussion, well known to Jones, of this\nparadox:\n\nThis absolute connection of two concepts S and P, in\nwhich the one is unconditionally the other, and yet both stand over\nagainst each other as different, is a relation quite impracticable in\nthought; by means of this copula, the simple \u2018is\u2019 of the\ncategorical judgment, two different contents cannot be connected at\nall; they must either fall entirely within one another, or they must\nremain entirely separate, and the impossible judgment,\n\u2018S is P\u2019, resolves itself into three\nothers, \u2018S is S\u2019, \u2018P is\nP\u2019, \u2018S is not P.\u2019 (Lotze\n1888, 79)\n\n\nTo predicate P of S is either to say of S\nwhat it is not, or it is to say of S what it is. That is, it\nis to say that S is not S (because it is\nP), or it is to say that it is S. We either get a\ncontradiction\u2014we say, in effect, that S is not\nS\u2014or an instance of the law of identity\u2014we say\nthat S is S. Neither option is satisfactory.\n\nFor Lotze, the paradox has an immediate upshot: that the \u2018is\u2019 of\npredication be expunged from logic. Grammatical appearances\nnotwithstanding, the basic form an assertion takes is that of an\nidentity statement or of its negation. This, however, renders him\nincapable of making sense of (what Jones called) \u201csignificant\nassertion\u201d. The content of an assertion, if it is not to be an\nabsurdity (A is not A), must be a triviality\n(A is A). (Lotze vaguely hints at a pragmatic\naccount of the apparent significance of what he counts as\ntrivialities, remarking that, perhaps, \u201cwhat we mean by\nthem will eventually justify itself.\u201d) As we shall see, Jones\ndoes not depart from Lotze\u2019s austere conception of logical form:\nan affirmative proposition S is P states an identity, and is\ntrue just in case the extension of S = the extension of\nP. However, she is able to graft a notion of intensional\ncontent onto Lotze\u2019s logical skeleton, thus avoiding his\nparadoxical conclusion that, despite appearances, all positive\nassertion is analyzed in terms of A is not A.\n\nThe debate surrounding this paradox was not marginal, but at the\ncenter of contemporary discussion. Although Jones\u2019s own solution\nfalls squarely within the framework of nineteenth century logic, she\nseems to be responding to worries that were shared by Russell and\nMoore. Indeed, Dreben and Floyd (1991), who provide a useful\ndiscussion of the historical context, argue that the paradox is\nimplicated in Russell and Moore\u2019s break with idealism.\n",
