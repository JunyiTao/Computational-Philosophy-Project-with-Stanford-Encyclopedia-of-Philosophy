    "main_text": "Objections || Democratic theory\n5.3 Democratic theory\n\nUnsurprisingly, democrats object to meritocratic politics. There are\nthree main classes of objection.\n\nFor epistemic democrats (e.g., Goodin & Spiekermann\n[2018] and Landemore [2012]), democracy is valuable and legitimate\nbecause of its ability to make correct (e.g., just) decisions. They\neither resist meritocrats\u2019 claims\n (\u00a73)\n about the ignorance and irrationality of the democratic voter or,\nmore commonly, reject the inference from individual dysfunction to\ncollective dysfunction. This is the most direct objection to\nmeritocracy given that nearly all arguments for meritocratic\ngovernance are epistemic in character.\n\nThe most commonly-adduced argument for the \u201cwisdom of the\n[democratic] crowd\u201d is Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\n(Condorcet 1785). In its simplest form, the theorem considers a group\nof voters choosing between two alternatives (e.g., a Democrat and a\nRepublican). Each voter has a probability of choosing the\n\u201ccorrect\u201d (e.g., more just) candidate. That probability is\nshared and >50%. Assuming votes are statistically independent and\nthe group uses \u201cone person, one vote\u201d, Condorcet\u2019s\ntheorem tells us that (i) the larger the group gets, the more likely\nit is to choose correctly and (ii) the probability that the group\nchooses correctly goes to 100% as the number of voters goes to\ninfinity.\n\nThe meritocrat may avail himself of three broad rejoinders here.\nFirst, he may deny the relevance of the model on the grounds that its\nassumptions are violated in the real world. (Statistical independence\nis particularly troublesome given the many ways voters interact.)\nSecond, he may concede that the collective performance of democracy is\ngood for Condorcetian reasons, but insist that meritocracy does\nbetter. For it too may enjoy benefits from aggregation. Third, he may\nreply that the theorem itself commends unequal political influence:\nWhen some citizens are more competent than others, \u201cone person,\none vote\u201d is (generally) suboptimal. The group does better if\nmore competent voters are given more influence (see, e.g., Nitzan\n& Paroush 1985).\n\nEpistemic democrats have drawn on other theoretical grounds. Perhaps\n\u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d (Hong & Page 2004):\nDemocracy effectively harnesses diversity within contemporary\nelectorates, and thereby does better, epistemically, than meritocracy\ndoes. Or perhaps while democratic voters do frequently err, as\nmeritocrats claim, those errors cancel out to allow an accurate\nminority to prevail\u2014the \u201cmiracle of aggregation\u201d\n(Surowiecki 2004).\n\nProcedural democrats take a different tact. For them, what\njustifies democracy and rules out meritocracy is adherence to certain\nmorally necessary procedures. For (pure) proceduralists, whether\nmeritocracy \u201ctracks the truth\u201d or makes decisions better\nthan democracy does is irrelevant (if indeed these notions make sense\nat all).\n\nIf, for example, some voting procedure\u2014like \u201cone person,\none vote\u201d\u2014is required by justice, and democracy embodies\nthis procedure while meritocracy rejects it, no further analysis is\nnecessary: Democracy is justified and meritocracy is not. Many\nrelational egalitarian arguments\n (\u00a75.2)\n are proceduralist, and other kinds of proceduralist theories have\nbeen developed (see, e.g., Habermas 1992 [1996] and Waldron 1999).\n\nFinally, Estlund (2008) has advanced an influential objection which is\na hybrid of the epistemic and proceduralist\napproaches\u2014epistemic proceduralism. Estlund argues\nagainst pure proceduralist approaches on the grounds that if\nprocedural fairness were all we cared about, democracy would be no\nbetter than simply flipping a coin. In both cases, all citizens have\nan equal chance of affecting an election (because, in the latter case,\nnone has any chance at all). So there must be an epistemic component\nto political justification.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that some meritocratic system might do\nbetter than democracy is insufficient to justify it. Our political\nsystem, Estlund argues, must be \u201cgenerally acceptable\u201d to\nall reasonable citizens (i.e., this is a public reason argument).\nAccording to Estlund, of all the generally acceptable systems,\ndemocracy does best.\n",
