    "main_text": "Quantum Information\n9. Quantum Information\nQuantum information is at present a very active field of research,\none in which quantum foundational issues continually arise. One reason\nfor current interest is the hope of building quantum computers that\nare capable, assuming they can be made to work properly, of carrying\nout certain information-processing tasks faster and more efficiently\nthan is possible using ordinary classical computers. To be sure, if\nthe entire world is quantum mechanical then our current\n\u201cclassical\u201d computers must in some real sense be quantum\ncomputers. So what is the difference? At least to a first\napproximation, classical computation is that kind where a single\nquasiclassical framework, section 6, suffices\nfor describing the carriers of information (e.g., on-off states of\ntransistors) and the way information is processed, whereas quantum\ncomputation is what cannot be so described. Further clarifying this\ndistinction is one of the tasks of quantum information theory.\nClassical information theory as developed by Shannon and his\nsuccessors employs standard (Kolmogorov) probability theory. The\nhistories approach to quantum mechanics also uses standard probability\ntheory, and thus it is plausible that as long as one sticks to a\nsingle quantum framework, both the mathematical structure and the\nintuition associated with classical information theory can be directly\ntranslated into the quantum domain. This is indeed the case, and such\na quantum framework is not limited to quasiclassical states; it can\nalso include microscopic quantum states.\nThis makes it possible for the histories approach to answer two\nquestions raised by J. S. Bell (1990) as\nobjections to using information theory to address foundational issues\nin quantum mechanics: \u201cWhose information? Information\nabout what?\u201d The answers in reverse order: information\nis always about quantum properties or, more generally,\nproperties at different times, thus histories. And it is\npossessed by someone who, like Alice\nin subsection 8.1, can build a reliable\npiece of apparatus and interpret the (macroscopic) outcome by applying\nconsistent quantum principles.\nNot all problems in quantum information can be simply and\nimmediately mapped in a useful way onto a single framework, and those\nthat cannot are what make quantum information an interesting, as well\nas a rather difficult, field of research. Note that the single\nframework rule forbids combining incompatible frameworks, but\nallows one to compare them or work out relationships that hold between\nresults in different frameworks. Therefore one can say that, at least\nin some general sense, problems at the frontiers of quantum\ninformation theory have to do with comparisons of incompatible\nframeworks. See the \n Further Reading supplement for additional discussions of these\nissues.\n\n\nIn summary, the histories approach provides a consistent conceptual\nframework for the full scope of quantum information theory, including\nclassical (Shannon) information as a special case.\n",
