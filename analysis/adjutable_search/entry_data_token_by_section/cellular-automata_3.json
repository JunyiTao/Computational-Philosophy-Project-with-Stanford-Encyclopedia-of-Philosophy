    "main_text": "Some Basic Notions and Results || Basic Definitions\n2.1 Basic Definitions\n\nWe are now taking a closer look at CA, focusing on models and results\nof philosophical interest. Although the variety of systems to be found\nin the CA literature is vast, one can generate virtually all CA by\ntuning the four parameters that define their structure: \n\nDiscrete n-dimensional lattice of cells: We can have\none-dimensional, two-dimensional, \u2026 , n-dimensional CA.\nThe atomic components of the lattice can be differently shaped: for\nexample, a 2D lattice can be composed of triangles, squares, or\nhexagons. Usually homogeneity is assumed: all cells are\nqualitatively identical.\nDiscrete states: At each discrete time step, each cell is\nin one and only one state, \\(\\sigma \\in \\Sigma, \\Sigma\\) being a set\nof finite cardinality \\(|\\Sigma| = k\\).\nLocal interactions: Each cell\u2019s behavior depends\nonly on what happens within its local neighborhood of cells\n(which may or may not include the cell itself). Lattices with the same\nbasic topology may have different definitions of neighborhood, as we\nwill see below. It is crucial, however, to note that \u201cactions at\na distance\u201d are not allowed.\nDiscrete dynamics: At each time step, each cell updates\nits current state according to a deterministic transition function\n\\(\\phi: \\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma\\) mapping neighborhood\nconfigurations (n-tuples of states of \\(\\Sigma\\)) to\n\\(\\Sigma\\). It is also usually, though not necessarily, assumed that\n(i) the update is synchronous, and (ii) \\(\\phi\\) takes as\ninput at time step t the neighborhood states at the immediately\nprevious time step \\(t - 1\\).\n\n\nOne can exhaustively describe, for instance, the automaton of our\nclassroom example: \n\n1-dimensional lattice of square cells on a line.\n\\(\\Sigma = {1, 0}\\) (1 = black or hat on, 0 = white or hat off),\nso \\(|\\Sigma| = 2\\).\nEach cell\u2019s neighborhood is composed by the two nearest\ncells. If we index the cells by the integers, so that \\(c_i\\) is cell\nnumber i, then the neighborhood of \\(c_i\\) is \\(N(c_i) =\n\\langle c_{i - 1}, c_{i + 1}\\rangle\\).\nThe transition rule \\(\\phi\\) is simple: At each time step\nt, a cell state is 1 if exactly one of the neighboring cells\nwas 1 at \\(t - 1, 0\\) otherwise.\n\n\nA rule for a CA can be expressed as a conditional instruction:\n\u201cIf the neighborhood is this-and-this, then turn to state\ns\u201d. One can write the general form of the rule for\none-dimensional CA:  \n\\[\\tag{Rule1D}\n\\sigma_i (t + 1) = \\phi(\\sigma_{i - r} (t), \\sigma_{i - r + 1} (t), \\ldots, \\sigma_{i + r - 1} (t), \\sigma_{i + r} (t))\n\\]\n\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma_{i}(t) \\in \\Sigma = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, k - 1\\}\\) is the\nstate of cell number i at time step t; r\nspecifies the range, that is, how many cells on any side\ncount as neighbors for a given cell; and \\(\\phi\\) is defined\nexplicitly by assigning values in \\(\\Sigma\\) to each of the \\(k^{2r+1}\n(2r + 1)\\)-tuples representing all the possible neighborhood\nconfigurations. For example, with \\(r = 1, \\Sigma = \\{1, 0\\}\\), a\npossible transition rule \\(\\phi\\) can be expressed as in\n Fig. 4\n (with 1 being represented as black, 0 as white):\n\n\n\n\nFig. 4\n\n\nFor a given cell, each triple at the top represents a possible\nneighborhood configuration at t, the cell at issue being the\none in the middle: for each configuration, the square at the bottom\nspecifies the cell\u2019s state at \\(t + 1\\). This is our classroom\nexample: you will have a black cell just in case precisely one of the\nneighbors was black. \n",
