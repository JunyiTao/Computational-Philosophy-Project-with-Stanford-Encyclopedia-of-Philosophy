    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || Elimination rules as basic\n3.1 Elimination rules as basic\n\nMost approaches to proof-theoretic semantics consider introduction\nrules as basic, meaning giving, or self-justifying, whereas the\nelimination inferences are justified as valid with respect to the\ngiven introduction rules. This conception has at least three roots:\nThe first is a verificationist theory of meaning according to which\nthe assertibility conditions of a sentence constitute its meaning. The\nsecond is the idea that we must distinguish between what gives the\nmeaning and what are the consequences of this meaning, as not all\ninferential knowledge can consist of applications of definitions. The\nthird one is the primacy of assertion over other speech acts such as\nassuming or denying, which is implicit in all approaches considered so\nfar.\n\nOne might investigate how far one gets by considering elimination\nrules rather than introduction rules as a basis of proof-theoretic\nsemantics. Some ideas towards a proof-theoretic semantics based on\nelimination rather than introduction rules have been sketched by\nDummett (1991, Ch. 13), albeit in a very rudimentary form. A more\nprecise definition of validity based on elimination inferences is due\nto Prawitz (1971; 2007; see also Schroeder-Heister 2015). Its\nessential idea is that a closed proof is considered valid, if the\nresult of applying an elimination rule to its end formula is a valid\nproof or reduces to one. For example, a closed proof of an implication\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is valid, if, for any given closed valid proof of\n\\(A\\), the result of applying modus ponens \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\to B$}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nto these two proofs is a valid proof of \\(B\\), or reduces to such a\nproof. This conception keeps two of the three basic ingredients of\nPrawitz-style proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 2.2.2):\n the role of proof reduction and the substitutional view of\nassumptions. Only the canonicity of proofs ending with introductions\nis turned into the canonicity of proofs ending with eliminations.\n",
