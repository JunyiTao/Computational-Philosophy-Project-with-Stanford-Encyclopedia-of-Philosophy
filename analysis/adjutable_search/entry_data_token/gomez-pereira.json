Life and Works\n\nG\u00f3mez Pereira\u2019s biography is largely unknown. Only a few\ndata have been extracted from the Prologues of his books and from some\nlegal documents discovered in his hometown Medina del Campo (Alonso\nCort\u00e9s 1914: 10; Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 95\u201396). He\nwas a prestigious doctor who practiced his profession in his own town,\nwhich at that time enjoyed great prosperity as a center of commerce.\nHis medical reputation may have gone beyond the limits of Medina del\nCampo since he was summoned by the court of Madrid to look after the\nhealth of the Infante, the future Charles II, son of Philip II. The\norigin of his family is uncertain (the surname \u201cPereira\u201d\nindicates that its origin was probably in Galicia or Portugal). It\nseems that his family was in trade and had a favorable position.\nBecause of this professional activity it has been suggested that\nG\u00f3mez Pereira came from a family of Jewish\n\u201cconversos\u201d (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 96\u201397;\nRodr\u00edguez Pardo 2008: 195\u2013199).\n\nThe young Pereira was sent to study Arts at the University of\nSalamanca, where a profound pedagogical renewal was just then under\nway (Mu\u00f1oz Delgado 1964: 75\u201389; Valverde 2019: ix). Among\nthe professors whose lectures he attended we must pay particular\nattention to Juan Mart\u00ednez Guijarro and Juan de Oria. The first\ncame from the University of Paris and developed at the University of\nSalamanca new teaching methods in the field of logic and natural\nphilosophy. Many years later, G\u00f3mez Pereira dedicated one of\nhis books to him as a sign of affection and admiration for the man who\nwas in charge of the education of young Philip II and became\nArchbishop of Toledo. Also, Juan de Oria \u2013 who was later\ncondemned by the Inquisition and spent his last years of life in\nseclusion \u2013 lectured on logic and natural philosophy. Oria\nprobably sparked Pereira\u2019s interest in the question of\nimmortality, since he had great acquaintance with the controversies\nwhich was occurring \u2013 especially at the universities of northern\nItaly during those years (Mu\u00f1oz Delgado 1987: vol. I,\n9\u201317; Valverde 2020: 242\u2013247).\n\nG\u00f3mez Pereira only wrote three books: the Antoniana\nMargarita, published in 1554, an Apologia that he\nredacted in 1555 to answer the objections raised against his first\nbook, and the Novae veraeque medicinae of 1558\n(Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 111\u2013114). As can be seen by the\ndates, the publication of his writings was concentrated in a few\nyears, probably at the end of his life. It is, then, likely that these\nwritings had many years of reflection, readings and experimentation\nprobably determined by his profession. The Antoniana\nMargarita, entitled so in honor of Pereira\u2019s parents, is\nhis best-known work. It is composed in three parts without any\ninternal division of chapters: the first part, which gives the title\nto the entire book, is the largest; the second is a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima III, and the third is a treatise\nDe immortalitate animorum. The discourse is arranged in a\nsequence of paragraphs whose content is sometimes announced by\nmarginal notes which are more numerous in the first part than in the\nother two. The prose is usually very dense and full of digressions,\nmany of which are so extensive that they seriously break the thread of\nthe main argument. The impression of disorder and lack of a previous\nexpository plan is certainly overwhelming, so that only the\ninteresting opening of the book, where Pereira introduces in media\nre the theme of animals\u2019 lack of sensory perception, can\nattract the interest of the reader. In his Apologia, Pereira\nsummarized and confirmed all the theses previously established in the\nAntoniana, and took the opportunity to clarify some points of\nhis own thought, as for example the nature of human soul as a simple\nsubstance that only conceptually can be divided into parts. Finally,\nthe Novae veraeque medicinae, probably published\nposthumously, were written following an empirical methodology that\naimed to discover the true causes and the effects of diseases and\naffections. For example, against the common opinion of his time and\nthe criteria of Greek and Arab medical treatises, Pereira explained\nfever as a mechanism devoted to restoring a lost equilibrium in the\nbody.\n2. Epistemology and Nominalism\n\nLike some other figures of his time, G\u00f3mez Pereira took great\ninterest in exposing the shortcomings and difficulties he encountered\nin scholastic natural philosophy. The Aristotelian scheme seemed to\nhim insufficient, so he directed severe criticism at it for being\nunclear or even contradictory in some essential respects, especially\nthose which had to do with the explanation of life and the\ncontroversial issue of the nature and origin of the soul.\n\nAbout his own vision of empirical method and scientific research, the\nPrologues of his books provide us with enlightening information. In\nhis Novae veraeque medicinae Pereira proclaims that the duty\nof a scientist is to use the instruments of logic and experience to\nreach the truth, without becoming entangled in the subtleties of\nlanguage and sterile sophistry. In this sense, Pereira denounces\nErasmus and his followers for having wasted the intelligence of many\nyoung people who could have devoted themselves to science (NVM: 1a).\nAlso, at the beginning of the Antoniana Pereira rejects the\nprinciple of authority if it is used to replace rational\ndemonstration. Against those who base their doctrines in Aristotle,\nPereira says: \n\n\nwriters of this kind would have had more respect for their readers if\nthey had demonstrated what they believed to be true by means of solid\nreasoning. (AM: I.193) \n\n\nAs we shall see, the epistemology formulated by Pereira in\nhis Antoniana was built on a deep criticism of the philosophy\nof Aristotle and scholastic realism.\n\nThe Antoniana begins by denouncing the incoherencies that\nPereira finds if we admit that animals and humans share sensory\nperception. These inconsistencies are based on an erroneous analysis\nof the process that leads from the images to the mental concept. In\nthis process two elements need to be present. First, we receive some\nspecies from the external objects through our own\nsense-organs. However, these species are not yet properly\nsensations; to get these last some animadversio is also\nnecessary: \n\n\nOnce our sensory organs have been fashioned, in accordance with what\nis due to happen, by a visual image or something corresponding to a\nvisual image, human beings should still not be called\n\u2018sentient\u2019 unless they turn the acuteness of their mind\nupon the object they want to recognise. (AM: I.273) \n\n\nFrom sensation thus configured, the mind which pays attention\nto those species builds, at a higher cognitive level, the\nnotio of the object (AM: I.275).\n\nNow, Pereira emphasized that all this is a process in which multiple\ninstances can be differentiated only conceptually; there is a unique\nsubject of this process: the entire soul, which first pays attention\nto an object and later constructs the notion of it. What is more, the\nattention of the soul is nothing other than the soul itself, which\nfocuses on one object rather than on any other and does it\nspontaneously. In other words, its own attention is not accidental,\nbut what Pereira himself called a mode of being: so, the act\nof knowing is not realiter anything other than the soul\nitself (AM: I.295). In this conception, the body does not participate\nin knowledge, nor is knowledge different from the soul\n(Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975: 28\u201329). It is likely that\nnominalism, during its ephemeral implantation in Spain in the first\nhalf of the sixteenth century, had a decisive influence on\nPereira\u2019s thought; he certainly aimed at contradicting the\nRealistic notion of St. Thomas about the soul, which assumed that the\nsoul\u2019s faculties are diversified by their acts and, in turn,\ntheir acts are diversified by their objects (Thomas Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae, I, q. 77, a. 3). Against this conception, the Spanish\nauthor affirmed that the soul is always equivalent to its acts, so he\nultimately criticized Aristotle for having turned to a group of\ndifferentiated faculties in his description of the cognitive process:\nsuch a plurality was unnecessary.\n\nAn example of this criticism can be found at the moment when the\nexistence of the common sense is rejected in the Antoniana\n(AM: I.371\u2013373). This is the faculty responsible for processing\nthe so-called common sensibles, that is, those common objects\nof perception which are co-incidental to the exclusive objects of each\nsense (i.e., motion, rest, number, figure etc.; see Aristotle, De\nAnima, III, 1\u20132). In opposition to Aristotle, Pereira\nargued that, if the common sense is an organic faculty, so that it\nperceives what has been previously perceived by the senses, it would\nmake the latter unnecessary and we should be obliged to conclude that\nnature has created many organs to do what it could with fewer, which\ngoes against its own principles. It is, therefore, better to maintain\nthat it is the soul itself, as an indivisible unity, which perceives,\njudges and differentiates all the sensibles: the soul is present, in\neffect, in all parts of the living body and is affected in a similar\nway by all the sense organs.\n\nFor Pereira there is no real difference between the sensory and\nintellectual faculties. Neither must they be understood as two\ndifferent accidents of one unique substance, i.e., the soul,\nbecause such a diversity would make impossible to explain how, if the\nobjects of both sense and intellect are different realiter,\nthey can converge on a single object: it would then be necessary to\nappeal for a third power or faculty which would analyze both objects\nand, finally, link them. In addition, the unity of the soul would be\nbroken, because it would be divisible according to the various objects\nit can perceive and understand; in this case one could not explain how\nit is possible that, since those different objects are processed by\ndifferent cognitive faculties, knowledge is always a simultaneous and\nindivisible achievement. Pereira emphasized that this is only because\nthe subject that reaches this knowledge is necessarily one and\nindivisible (AM: I.379\u2013381).\n\nSimilarly, because of the unity and indivisibility of the soul, the\nauthor rejected the existence of intelligible species. For\nhim, these species may not be extracted from\nphantasmata since these have a corporeal constitution, while\nintelligible species are immaterial by definition; but our\nintellect is unable to generate a spiritual substance from a material\none: God alone is endowed with such a power (AM: I.409). Almost a\ncentury after Pereira had formulated this argument, Descartes resorted\nto a very similar one to support his own rejection of intelligible\nspecies as well as of the possibility that ideas can be caused by\nbodies (see, for example, Descartes, Meditationes AT, p. 41;\nabout the historical precedents of Descartes\u2019 theory see Spruit\n1995, vol. II, pp. 379\u2013386: unfortunately, Spruit did not have\naccess to the Antoniana, so he could not introduce Pereira\namong the possible influences that Descartes received from earlier\nphilosophy). For the Spanish doctor it was then much more efficient to\nexplain the intellectual process on the basis of considering that all\ncognitive activity, whether sensory or intelligible, not only depends\non the soul but, in fact, identifies with it.\n\nA new question then emerges: what is the difference between sensory\nperception and understanding? Pereira\u2019s answer was that there\nare not diverse instances of knowledge but rather a unique process\nthat progressively reaches various stages of refinement. Basing\nhimself on the Preface of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics, he examined these various stages through which the\nuniversal concept would pass (AM: I.439\u2013441). This concept can\nbe confused or distinct: the confused concept is that which covers a\ncomplete genus without any distinction of the species\ncontained therein, while the distinct one is precisely that which\ndefines the designated object with all the categories that belong to\nit. There are then two forms of knowledge: one of them is less subtle\nbecause it rests upon the mere assertion of the existence of an\nobject, and the other is subtler because it distinguishes with clarity\nall the elements that are present in it. Given the nature of our own\ncognitive potentiality, it is always easier to have access to the\nfirst type of universal cognition; only through effort and exercising\nshall we be able to achieve a greater determination in our own\nunderstanding.\n\nTo illustrate this cognitive progression, Pereira explained how we can\nachieve the abstract notion of substance: \n\n\nIf I want to understand the substance of a square white wall, I turn\nmy mind away from thinking about whiteness, and quantity, and shape,\nand location, and when it was built, and all the other individual\ncircumstances connected with the wall, every one of which I had\nrecognised beforehand, either by means of my external senses, or\nconceived earlier abstractly in my imagination, and I draw forth\ncognition of something I have never perceived sensorily, namely, the\nsubject of these things. (AM: I.445) \n\n\nThis process is accomplished by us spontaneously. Pereira said that it\nis simply a quality that belongs to our soul by nature and allows us\nto extract species from genera. We do all this by ourselves and in\nourselves, since, as he repeatedly emphasized, the intellect, the act\nof thinking, and the object thought are the same, i.e., the unique and\nindivisible human soul (AM: I.455; see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975:\n28\u201330).\n\nPereira\u2019s nominalist position rests on this basis. The question\nof whether universals are or not substances is elucidated by\nexplaining the universal concept as a connotative term which exists\nonly in the sentences formulated by our own mind. The soul understands\nthat the singular elements that can constitute a genus or a species\nhave similar characteristics, and thus it regards them all as a unity\nand this unity as a universal concept. Applying this doctrine, Pereira\ndirected his criticism to certain metaphysical concepts that were\nmeaningless and unnecessary for him. Such is the case, for example, of\nthe scholastic difference between essence and existence. Against St.\nThomas, he affirmed that these two concepts are not different\nrealiter but only conceptually, and this because \n\n\u2026 aut essentia erit ens, et sic ens et essentia non\ndistinguentur, quod probare nisi sumus. Aut non erit ens, et sic non\nens intrasset entis compositionem, quod implicat. (AM: I.490)\n\nThat is:\n\n\u2026 either essence will be a being, and thus a being and essence\nwill not be different from one another, (which [we cannot] prove\nunless we exist) or it will not be a being, and thus a being would not\nhave entered the make-up of the thing it is embracing. (AM: I.491)\n\n\nNor did G\u00f3mez Pereira accept the concept of prime matter. The\nprocedure which Aristotle followed to conceive this concept was none\nother than analogy, because prime matter is not accessible to the\nsenses. It is something that remains as an immutable subject in the\ntransition from one form to another one; for instance, if a new form\nmust be induced during the process of generation, then the natural\ndispositions required for the formation of the new living being must\nbe precedent and remain during all this process; those dispositions,\ninaccessible to sensory perception, are prime matter, which lacks any\npositive nature. Hence Aristotle pointed out in Metaphysics\nVII that it is not a quid or a quantum, or any other\ngenre of predicates (see Metaphysica, VII, 3,\n1029a6\u201329). Against this theory, the author of the Antoniana\nMargarita argued that in the process of natural generation it is\nobserved not only that the material part of the compound disappears,\nbut also the formal one, so if the sentence ex nihilo nihil\nfieri is adopted by the Aristotelians for affirming the necessary\npermanence of matter, the same should be said with respect to the\nform, since neither the form nor matter can turn into nothing or be\ngenerated from nothing: this means then that also the form would exist\nin a temporal continuum (AM: I.549). In Pereira\u2019s opinion, this\nproblem can be easily solved if we consider that the elements are the\nbasic materials of nature. They can perfectly play the role of matter,\nand there is no problem in the fact that the elements are also subject\nto mutation and even annihilation, because, ultimately, they are under\nthe influence of qualities which are contrary to their own\nconsistency: so when these qualities have a strong presence in them,\nthis always leads to their destruction; but, on the contrary, whenever\nthe primary qualities appear in the right proportion, the same\nelements are generated again.\n3. Psychology\n3.1 Nature of the soul\n\nPereira\u2019s epistemology follows from a theory of the\nsoul whose basic premises are simplicity and indivisibility\n(Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975: 22). His own vision of the rational soul\nled him to object to the philosophy of Aristotle, as well as to give a\nresponse to the question of whether the human intellect can perform\nits own activity without the support of the body. Pereira\u2019s\nreply was a categorical yes: in fact, given his own epistemological\npremises, knowledge is possible only if it is identical with the\nsubstance of the soul itself. To demonstrate this assertion, the\nauthor addressed some issues that had been present in the debate about\nthe nature and destiny of the soul from the Middle Ages (see Nardi\n1958: 365\u2013442; Kristeller 1979: 181\u2013196; Valverde 2019:\n35\u201355).\n\nIn the first place, the problem of the soul\u2019s indivisibility had\naroused an important debate within Aristotelianism. Aristotle himself\nhad already denounced at the end of Book I of his De Anima\nthe absurd consequences of considering that the soul has parts\nunderstood as substantially different: if the soul is the principle\nthat unifies the body, it can in no way be divisible itself; if not,\nwe should have to find another superior principle and so on to\ninfinity. Notwithstanding this assess, there is no doubt that\nAristotle also spoke of the different functions exercised by the soul\nthrough its different faculties: thus, it was inevitable that the\nunity of the soul reappeared once again. This issue had been widely\ndiscussed since the Middle Ages but remained still debated among many\nRenaissance Aristotelians. The subtleties (distinctiones) in\nthe interpretation of the thought of Aristotle became increasingly\ncomplex, giving rise to an intricate tangle of arguments and\ncounter-arguments difficult to follow even for the experts (see Di\nNapoli 1963: 339 ff.; Schmitt 1983: 13\u201342; Bianchi 2003a:\n133\u2013172).\n\nLinked to this question was another topic also discussed among the\nAristotelians: are there several substantial forms in a single\ncompound? The different responses to this question had a particular\nimpact on the debate over the connection of the intellectual soul with\nthe body. Two main positions can be easily distinguished here: there\nwas a unitary position based on the thought of St. Thomas, for whom\nthe intellective soul is the only substantial form present in human\nbeings, having in itself the derived potentialities of the vegetative\nand sensitive souls; the position contrary to this had as a pattern\nthe philosophy of Averroes: in this case many \u2013 professed\nAverroists or not \u2013 admitted the existence of more than one\nsubstantial form in the same compound in order to explain the link\nbetween the human soul and the body, as can be seen in great figures\nof medieval and Renaissance Aristotelianism such as John of Jandun,\nNicole Oresme, Paul of Venice, Agostino Nifo and later Giacomo\nZabarella. Zabarella summarized this position by pointing out that the\nintellectual soul may in no way be attached directly to prime matter:\nits own complexity requires a high level of organization in the\nsubject matter so that it can serve as an appropriate instrument for\nthe powers that the human soul is capable of exercising. For this\nreason, our soul needs a preliminary compound with its own substantial\nform (Zabarella 1590 [2016: vol. II, pp. 897]; Park 1988:\n464\u2013484).\n\nIn this debate Pereira wanted to intervene formulating a discourse\nwhose principal aim was to resolve those difficulties which were\ninherent in the relation between the soul and the body. This discourse\nwas clearly linked to the theoretical assumptions of his time, but it\nhad in addition traits of certain originality which has gone alas\nlargely unnoticed. The author of the Antoniana Margarita put\nhis finger on the deficiencies of the Scholastic-Thomist philosophy\nwhen it was applied to demonstrate the immortal nature of the human\nsoul. In this sense, he clearly assumed that the criticism of the\nAlexandrist Aristotelians, and in particular of Pietro Pomponazzi, was\nessentially correct (Pine 1986: 124 ff.; Perrone 1999:\nxlvi\u2013lxvii). Pereira concluded that assuming that the rational\nsoul is potentially capable of exercising the activities related to\nvital functions implies recognizing that it is linked to the body.\nThus, given the premises established by Aristotle himself in his\nDe generatione animalium (II, 3), the origin of that soul\nmust be found in the same process of natural generation that gives\nrise to the living body, but this process is essentially material. For\nPereira, then, if we really want to save the immortality of the soul,\nwe must radically separate it from all activity that is related in one\nway or another to the body. He accepted the consequences of the\ndilemma that Pomponazzi had established in his De immortalitate\nanimae (1516): if the soul has the body as its own substratum\n(ut subiecto) or cannot operate without the support of the\nbody (ut obiecto), it is inseparable from it, being then\nperishable (see Pine 1986: 55\u2013123; Kessler 1988:\n500\u2013504). It can be said that, to a great extent,\nthe Antoniana Margarita was conceived to give a satisfactory\nanswer to this unavoidable syllogism (see Valverde 2017:\n541\u2013553). Pereira tried to show that the rational soul has\nnothing to do with the body because it is a simple and independent\nsubstance dissociated from all those vital functions that have the\nbody as their object or as their substrate: these functions belong\nthen to a psychic principles different from the intellect: \n\n\nIn their workings, external as well as internal, all forms except the\nrational soul make use of the ways their whole is arranged, as\ninstruments, and without these they could do nothing. (AM: I.739) \n\n\nThe forms of brute beasts use heat, cold, wetness, and dryness, to\nfeed and preserve the whole, of which they are intrinsic parts, but it\nlacks unity precisely because of its intimate connection with the\nparts of the body that perform the vital functions. Therefore, this\nsoul is drawn from the very power of properly organized matter.\n\nFor Pereira, the rational soul is completely different. Its\nindivisible nature is alien to the generative process that gives rise\nto a living body. Thus, in Pereira life and spirit are sharply\ndisconnected. This is the only way to demonstrate the immortality of\nthe soul. To achieve such a demonstration, he believed that, as\nprinciple of apprehension and knowledge, the soul has to comprehend in\nitself all the episodes included in this activity. What is more, the\nsubstance of the soul is always its own activity. Now, if this is so,\nthe question is why the soul is not continually thinking. G\u00f3mez\nPereira\u2019s answer was that attention is what determines\nboth the perception of objects which can be perceived sensorily and\nthe self-perception of the soul itself; the latter as well as the\nformer depend on the will of the soul: consequently, they are not\ncontinuous (AM: II.1071). If it were so, we could not perceive\nanything else. Moreover, the necessary condition for self-perception\nis some kind of \u201cawakening\u201d that the soul experiences from\nexternal objects: only after this excitement does the soul become\naware of itself, that is, of its own existence. The final conclusion\nof Pereira is then: \n\n\nIf this notion is going to precede, it will be able to serve no useful\npurpose other than recognition that there is a particular antecedent\nfrom which the soul may later elicit a consequence: namely, that it is\nself-aware. The reasoning will go as follows. I know that I know\nsomething: whatever knows, exists: therefore I exist (nosco\nme aliquid noscere, et quicquid noscit est, ergo ego sum). (AM:\nII.1075) \n\n\nOnce the soul has known its own affection, it is able to reflect on\nitself and discover itself as existing. This is a single process in\nwhich two moments must be distinguished: in the first act the soul\nknows the fact of being affected by something, whereas only in the\nsecond does it know itself as an independent entity, with autonomous\nexistence. Now, the immediacy with which the soul reaches the\nconsciousness of this existence shows that for G\u00f3mez Pereira\nthis is not a deductive development, but a pure intuitive act that has\na previous formal factor: the awareness of the affection is, in\neffect, \u201cquodam antecedens cognitum\u201d necessary to\nverify that the soul \u201cseipsam noscit\u201d.\n\nThe above expression \u201cnosco me aliquid noscere, et quicquid\nnoscit est, ergo ego sum\u201d is not the final sentence of\nthe Antoniana Margarita, since G\u00f3mez Pereira will\nformulate new arguments pro immortalitate, but it can be\nconsidered as the true culmination of all the discourse that the\nauthor has directed to prove the immortality of the soul. This\ndiscourse represents the central nerve of the work to which the other\ncontents, and especially the doctrine of animal insensitivity, are\nsecondary derivations. Many scholars have argued that animal\nautomatism represents the genuine motif of the Antoniana,\nprobably because of its originality, but we should not confuse\noriginality with logical priority.  Underneath the amalgam of contents\nand the diffuse and often disordered prose of the author of\nthe Antoniana, a well-structured reasoning was present, in\nwhich three stages can be distinguished (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975:\n22.): \n\nThe nature of the act of knowledge requires an indivisible\nprinciple, so that only the soul, the unique indivisible principle in\nman, knows; the body does not participate in sensory knowledge, not\neven as a tool; therefore, the soul, in its main functions (which are\ncognitive) enjoys complete independence and full operational\nself-sufficiency regardless of the body.\nThis operational independence logically founds the ontological\nindependence that allows the survival of the separated soul. Although\nPereira does not deny the \u201ccorporeal\u201d conditioning factors\nto which knowledge is subject, as evidenced by experience, he\nrecognizes that the soul is weighed down by the body in its cognitive\noperations, so the body restricts the original and absolute cognitive\nspontaneity of the soul. \nOnce the operating-ontological independence of the soul is\nasserted, and consequently its separate subsistence, the perpetuity of\nthis subsistence does not involve any difficulty, since in the soul,\nwhich is indivisible, there is no intrinsic principle of\ncorruption.\n\n3.2 The Body-soul compound\n\nThis conception adopted by Pereira to explain the integral unity of\nthe rational soul needed to be developed to explain the integral unity\nof the human being. Many of his statements, both in the\nAntoniana and in the Apologia, pointed out that the\nhuman being is not only the soul, but the conjunction of a body and a\nsoul (see, for example, AM: I.687, I.697, II.1077, II.1149). In fact,\nhe never abandoned the formal relationship that the rational soul has\nwith regard to the body (see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975: 41).  However,\nthe concept of form used by Pereira permitted him to speak of a\nplurality of forms in a single subject (as many Averroists defended:\nsee above). For him, the unity of a compound is not given by\nthe uniqueness of a substantial form, but by the hierarchy of\nseveral forms under a superior one that gives the compound its\nultimate denomination. In a human, who is the most complex being of\ncreation, there would be a compound of compounds. Therefore, the\nrational soul is not the only substantial form in him, although it is\nthe only human form since it crowns that hierarchy of forms\nand confers to the whole human being his nature and\ndenomination. Pereira defended what can be considered a\ndynamic hylomorphism which was surely built on his own\nbiological experience as a doctor. However, the body-soul union of\nwhich the Spanish physician spoke in his Antoniana can hardly\nbe considered substantial sensu stricto, mainly because in\nhis book there is no detailed explanation of the relation of the soul\nto the body, or of what kind of union there is between two natures so\ndifferent in themselves. For him it is a factum that in human\nbeings these two natures converge, but he failed to explain this\nquestion \u2013 probably for the sake of a coherence that was perhaps\nimpossible.\n\n\nIt is curious that many of his contemporaries tried to respond to the\nchallenge of proving the immortality of the soul by appealing to\ncoherence, precisely when the Alexandrists emphasized that the\ncoherence of Aristotle was placed in mortality: every substantial form\nis born and perishes with the compound to which it gives the\nessence. Pereira was then not original when he tried to respond to\nPomponazzi\u2019s mortalist thesis by resorting to an alternative\ncoherence based on the radical separation of body and mind. But, in\nthis attempt, he showed, probably as no one before, that the\nhylomorphic explanatory scheme applied to the nature of the human\nbeing led to an unavoidable crossroads: one path ended in an integral\nmaterialism, the other in a strict dualism. Those who chose this last\nroad, as Pereira undoubtedly did, had a peremptory question before\nthem: what is the body for? For Pereira the body was a datum of\nexperience whose negation would have been contrary to the principles\nupon which he wished to sustain his work, i.e., experience and logical\ncoherence. His response came through the allegory of an imprisoned man\n(AM: II.1067). The soul is like a man inside a reticular sheath. This\nman cannot know anything at all if he is not \u201cawakened\u201d by\nthe blows that fall on the surrounding sheath from outside. Such blows\nor affections produced by external realities are necessary for the man\nwrapped in such a sheath to awaken and know, but they are not enough\nto explain knowledge itself. Thus, for Pereira the body is a kind of\n\u201calarm clock\u201d of the soul. This corporeal affection is\nrequired pro statu isto (i.e., the state of union body-soul)\nas conditio sine qua non of human understanding. But it is no\nless true that for Pereira the soul outside this sheath-jail would be\npermanently awake and would possess a more perfect knowledge of itself\nas well as of the other objects. Unfortunately, Pereira did not\nexplain at any time why the soul has to be in such a deplorable state:\nforgetful of itself, and aware only when it is unpleasantly excited by\nexternal stimuli. The tone in which Pereira referred to the situation\nof the incarnated soul shows us the most pessimistic version of an\nanthropological dualism: the knowledge that the soul is capable of\nachieving in this life is only a pale reflection of the one it can\nreach in the other. If, as Pereira seems to think, the soul is\nessentially self-consciousness, this nature can be reached here only\nindirectly, and for a limited time. But Pereira told us nothing of the\nmetaphysical framework that would be needed to explain what universal\norder allows a reality of a higher nature to be restricted in this\nway. If the death of the compound involves the reunion of the soul\nwith its true condition (\u201ccorrupto carcere statim in totum\nexpergiscetur\u201d/\u201conce his prison was destroyed he\nwould be completely awake\u201d AM: II.1068/1069), why should it\nsuffer the unfortunate restrictions to which it is subjected in the\nbody?  Although he wanted to deal with the issue of the soul\u2019s\nimmortality from the point of view of natural reason, in the end it\nwas necessary to transcend the physical realm to give a full\nexplanation of the fact that two natures as different as the spirit\nand the body cohabit in human beings.\n4. Animal Mechanism\n\nThe beginning of the Antoniana is an extensive discussion\naimed at demonstrating that animals do not have the faculty of sensory\nperception. His argument is easy to sum up: if animals had the ability\nto perceive objects and were able to behave in one way or another\ndepending on this perception, then we should have to grant them not\nonly sensory perception, but also the faculty of reasoning. What is\nmore, it would be necessary to conclude that they have an indivisible\nand immortal soul, as humans do. Pereira himself recognized that such\na thesis could seem surprising, since it was generally accepted that\nbeasts had been endowed with the faculty of sensory perception (AM:\nI.191). The author was right to believe that to his contemporary\nreader a thesis that denies the existence of sensory perception in\nbeasts might seem not only a striking novelty, but also something\nwhich contradicted common experience and the principles of\nAristotelian philosophy. Without going into the controversial question\nof whether Aristotle accepted or not the existence of certain traces\nof intelligence in animal behavior (see Newmyer 2011: 6\u201310),\nthere is no doubt that he attributed the sensitive faculty, in\ndifferent degrees of complexity, to animals. In the De Anima,\nwithout going any further, Aristotle clearly said: \n\n\nnow all animals have one sense at least, viz. touch, and whatever has\na sense has the capacity for pleasure and pain and therefore has\npleasant and painful objects present to it, and wherever these are\npresent, there is desire, for desire is just appetition of what is\npleasant. (De Anima, II, 3, 414b3\u20135)\n\n\nBut, if the boundary between humans and animals is located at the\nlimit between sensory perception and the intellect, precisely because\nthis limit is far from being well-defined, it is difficult to\ndetermine with precision the ontological difference between men and\nanimals, to the extent that one can find some cases of true bestiality\namong humans: these cases are certainly rare, but not as rare as those\nmen who are capable of living according to virtue and science (see\nBianchi 2003b: 63\u2013100). This is the context that explains much\nof the content of the Antoniana. In the opinion of its\nauthor, those who recognize that any animal perceives what seems to it\ndesirable or harmful, and then acts accordingly initiating a movement\nin pursuit of it or escaping from it, are not only obliged to grant\nthem a sensory faculty with a discriminating power, but even\nrationality and thought (AM: I.199). Moreover, given that Aristotle\nalso distinguished an intellectual faculty devoted to apprehending\nsimple objects and another one which can deduce the complex from the\nsimple (so that one can built a true or false proposition from the\nconnection of terms), then if we concede the first power to animals,\nwe must also concede the second, since \n\n\nthose who maintain that brute beasts recognize the presence or absence\nof an enemy or a friend are forced to acknowledge that they are\nforming mental propositions. If this is not so, let them explain how\none recognises the existence of an enemy, and they will find no answer\nother than the formation of the foresaid mental propositions. (AM:\nI.203) \n\n\nFurthermore, if the animals are capable of knowing the world through\nsensory perception, nature would have been very cruel for making them\nsuffer all they suffer, for example, at the hands of men. And, given\nthat certain species of animals can pre-empt the arrival of cold\nwinter and shelter or run away from it, we must grant them also some\nfaculty of prediction; but, if they can predict the winter, they will\nalso be able to have knowledge of death and, just like human beings,\nthey will worry about the future of their souls (AM: 1.215).\n\nWe might also grant them the knowledge of universal concepts. As\nAristotle says, once the premises are established and known, it is\nnecessary to deduce from them a conclusion: for example, if beasts\nknow that this fire burns, and that this other also\nburns, and they run away from whatever fire they can perceive, they\nmust have formulated the proposition \u201call fire burns.\u201d In\nthis case, they have an indivisible soul, since only with an\nindivisible soul can one achieve the knowledge of any object as a\nwhole. For, if we accept that the animals have a divisible soul\n(quanta), they will never reach such global knowledge: an\nanimal would know through a part of it a part of its object, and\nthrough another, another part, and so it would be unable to reach a\nperfect identification of whatever could be in front of it (AM:\nI.227).\n\nTo avoid such undesirable consequences, which de facto put\nanimals in the same category as human beings, Pereira tried out an\nalternative explanation of animal behavior. This behavior and the\ndiversity of movements observed in animals is due to what he called\nsome occultae qualitates by which visual images\n(species) coming from outside, or certain affections that\noccur in the phantasmata that stay in the front of the brain\n(occiput) set the animal in motion by activating its nervous\nsystem (AM: I.253). In the case of human beings, who, like animals,\nare also exposed to these species and have inside their\nbrains the same phantasmata, there is a real mental activity\nwhich is able to generate their own movements through the knowledge of\nthe object.\n\nFor Pereira, there are three main types of movement in nature. The\nsimplest is movement of inorganic objects. It is ruled by the\nprinciples of perpetual and invariable motion. This movement is merely\na local one: for example, the attraction of metal to a magnet. The\nmost complex category is voluntary movement (i.e., the complete\nfreedom of movement of humans). At the medium level of complexity,\nPereira located what he called \u201cvital movement\u201d, which\ndescribes animal movements. Vital movement includes movement caused by\nmuscular and nervous organs in direct response to interior and\nexterior stimuli; this movement does not involve will nor any kind of\nspontaneous decision. Notwithstanding this, Pereira said that vital\nmovement does not consist of invariable movement. Instead, the\ncomplexity of movements that can be observed in animals is the result\nof the complexity of the stimuli or forces that can act on them. To\nclarify this, Pereira classified four different types of animal\nmovement: i) movements produced as a reaction to objects that are\npresent; ii) movements produced by objects that were present in the\npast time; iii) movements produced as consequence of some previous\ninstruction; iv) movements resulting from the so-called natural\ninstinct (AM: I.241). The central core of Pereira\u2019s theory\non animal behavior is found precisely in the explanation of these four\ntypes of movement (see S\u00e1nchez Vega 1954: 383\u2013387;\nBandr\u00e9s & Llavona 1992: 161; Rodr\u00edguez Pardo 2008:\n191).\n\n(i) The first type of movement is based on the reaction to objects\nthat are present. In this case, Pereira formulated an explanation that\nembraced a pioneering theory of reflex reaction which involved both\nperipherical stimuli and a central organ. The process as it was\ndescribed by him consisted of four phases. It starts with the object\nthat stimulates the sensory organs. This stimulation leads to\nreactions in the sensory organs which cause certain mechanical\nalteration called by Pereira species. The sense of touch\noccupies a special category into this explanation model, since in this\nsense the process is not activated by means of mechanical alterations\ncaused by distant object, but by direct physical contact between the\nobject and the organism, without the intervention of those\nspecies. The second phase consists of the transmission of the\nalteration in the sensory organ to the brain. This transmission of the\nspecies to the brain takes place without any resistance, so\nthat it spreads along the nerves at an enormous speed. The third phase\nis located in the brain and consists of the activation of the areas\nwhere the motor nerves originate (Pereira considered the connections\ncorresponding to each sensorial modality to have a specific location\nin the brain). And finally, the fourth and last phase consists of the\nactivation of the nerves which gives way to contraction and distention\nof the muscles that generates the movement of the different parts of\nthe animal (AM: I.243\u2013245).\n\nBut for Pereira it was evident that, before the same object, the\nbehavior of an animal could vary and even be contradictory. He\nexplained such a variety by resorting to a complex interaction of\nfactors that occur simultaneously. To illustrate this question the\nauthor described the case of an animal that on some occasions drinks\nas a reaction to the presence of water and on other occasions does\nnot, depending on the interaction between the species\nproduced by the water and the current internal state of thirst of the\nanimal (AM: II.877).\n\n(ii) Another type of movement is that produced by previously present\nobjects. To explain this type Pereira turned to internal senses, which\nhe defined as inner cognitive organic faculties. He said that, while\nthere are two internal senses in man, imagination and memory, in\nanimals only memory is present. Pereira then developed a mechanical\nway of processing information in animal memory which excluded mental\nactivity. According to him, when an object disappears it leaves a\nphantasma. These phantasmata or traces are stored in\na cell located in the posterior zone of the brain, remaining there in\na passive state. In the absence of the object, those\nphantasmata can be activated and move from the cell to the\nsynciput which is located in the anterior zone of the brain.\nThere they produce the same reactions provoked by the species\ncoming from present objects. The author said that the only difference\nbetween humans and animals with respect to the function of memory is\nthat man can voluntarily cause the movement of the memory traces to\nevoke a recall, whereas in animals this movement is due to purely\nmechanical stimuli which can come from internal or external origin\n(AM: I.251, I.253\u2013255, I.263\u2013265).\n\n(iii) Pereira\u2019s third type of movement is produced by training,\nwhich certain animals are capable of assimilating. His doctrine is\ndeveloped through the exposition of specific cases of animal training.\nFor example, Pereira considered the imitation of human language by\nbirds as a special type of reflex mechanism in which hearing organs of\nbirds receive voice waves which are transmitted to a soft area of the\nbrain where they are recorded. When the brain is activated after\nreceiving some stimuli, it causes a series of muscular movements in\nthe speech organs that finally reproduce the previously recorded\nsounds. In this case, hearing and speech are two sides of a single\nprocess. Another case that Pereira studied was that of birds which can\nemit words that have been spoken in the past. According to him, this\nis due to the animal memory wherein a voice is retrieved from the\ncorresponding trace or phantasma that is stored in the\nposterior area of the brain. When these traces are somehow activated,\nthey pass to the anterior zone and provoke the production of the same\nsounds that created them. But why should an animal emit some words and\nnot others? The explanation is found in the frequency with which a\ndetermined voice is presented to the animal: the trace of a frequently\nrepeated voice is more mobile than that of an infrequent one, and then\nmuch more susceptible to flowing in the direction of the anterior zone\n(AM: I.263). Another example of training in animals is found in\nmovements in answer to a master\u2019s voice. These movements consist\nof approach or escape reactions and the diversity of responses can be\nexplained by certain voices in the past which have been followed by\nthe offer of food whereas others have been produced by punishment. In\nthis case, Pereira explained how the activation of a master\u2019s\nvoice phantasma on the posterior area of an animal\u2019s\nbrain generates the mobilization of the phastasmata of past\nevents that were accompanied by such a voice. Here it is important to\nnote that reward and punishment have a primary role in Pereira\u2019s\nconcept of behavior modification, because they are effective not only\nin establishing new behaviors but also in favoring learning by\nimitation (AM: I.263\u2013265).\n\n(iv) The fourth and last type of movement in Pereira\u2019s theory is\ninstinctive movements. Pereira attributed these movements to what he\ncalled natural instinct. Among the examples he used is the\npersecution of the mouse by the cat. Pereira recognized that the\nperfection and complexity of these movements are such that, if they\nare not carefully examined, they could lead us to the conclusion that\nnot only do animals have sensations, but that they also possess\nthought and reason. However, mere appearances are not evidence or\nproof. For example, he described the astonishing action of semen\ndeposited by the male inside the vulva, and yet, semen does not have\nsensory perception. The same can be said of nutritional processes,\nwherein the relationships between different organs cause a selection\nof some materials and the rejection of others, and neither these\noperations are the result of a sensory process (AM:\nI.343\u2013345).\n\nIn sum, Pereira thought that all these movements might be explained by\nturning to two types of causes: specific causes and\ngeneric causes. The first ones consist of various actions of\nthe species on the receptive organs; that is to say,\nenvironmental stimulation. Generic causes are the functional interest.\nPereira placed these causes under the general term\n\u201cnature\u201d, which plays a role as a universal regulator (AM:\nI.349). This broad generic cause is responsible for animals having\norgans adequate to enable them to interact with their habitat. This\nalso explains the different bodies and types of animals and their\nvarying capacity to be trained. Nature is also responsible for the\nfact that some of an animal\u2019s external movements serve as signs.\nFor instance, a dog\u2019s bark or a lion\u2019s roar frightens us\nand warns us of possible attack. Pereira considered instinctive\nmovements to include those basic processes related to environmental\nadaption, especially the search for food, avoiding danger, etc. These\nmovements are the result of the interaction between natural tendencies\nin the animal and concrete environmental circumstances. In this way,\nPereira explained the perfect harmony between the beast and its\nphysical, animal, and human surroundings (see Bandr\u00e9 &\nLlavona 1992: 163\u2013164).\n5. Aftermath\n\nThe little attention that has been paid to the Antoniana\nMargarita by Spanish researchers (outside Spain this attention\nhas been non-existent) has been mainly focused on the impact of the\nwork especially in post-sixteenth century philosophy, just when its\nfortune was linked to the Cartesian philosophy as a possible precedent\nof the animal mechanism formulated by the French philosopher (see\nGonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 99\u2013125; Bandr\u00e9s & Llavona\n1993: 131\u2013137; Valverde 2019: 55\u201361). However, a closer\nlook allows us to verify that in the immediate context of sixteenth\ncentury Spanish philosophy the Antoniana had a certain\nimpact, negative rather than positive. G\u00f3mez Pereira himself\nintroduced in an early reprint of his work the first or at least one\nof the first reactions to his book. In this case, the reaction was\nsolicited directly by Pereira, because he asked his old teacher Miguel\nde Palacios, Professor of Theology at the University of Salamanca, for\na critical survey of his book. The Objectiones which Palacios\nwrote to please his pupil were included in the Antoniana\nMargarita and accompanied by an Apologia where Pereira\nsummarized and defended all the theses previously\nestablished. Palacios\u2019 attitude was that of a professor who\ncondescendingly reads the work of a good student, not that of a\ngenuine critic. In any case, these Objectiones failed to\nidentify the central message of the Antoniana, either because\nthe author did not read the work carefully or because he did read it\nbut did not understand his student\u2019s thought.  Palacios\u2019\nwork analyzed some questions which, even if they do not lack some\ninterest, do not address the core of the work, that is,\nPereira\u2019s intention of dissociating the soul and the body so as\nto formulate on this basis a demonstrative proof of the immortality of\nthe human soul. For, even if in the order of the text the thesis of\nanimals\u2019 lack of sensory perception is the first issue\naddressed, this was only one of the consequences drawn from the\nclaimed independence and unity of the human soul. In Palacios\u2019\nopinion, however, that was the only significant content of the book,\nso he was unable to build a systematic criticism of Pereira\u2019s\narguments.\n\nAnother notably adverse reaction to the Antoniana was\nthe Endec\u00e1logo contra Antoniana Margarita, written in\nCastilian by Francisco Sosa, a colleague of Pereira who lived in the\nsame city and probably met him. This work is a satiric fable in which\nthe animals bring a suit before Jupiter, as a judge, against Pereira\nbecause he has deprived them of genuine sensory perception and\nself-movement. Gonz\u00e1lez Vila emphasizes that the work, beyond\nits questionable literary quality and lack of philosophical depth,\nserves only to demonstrate that the Antoniana had some\npopular repercussion (see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 102).\n\nThese two books show that the immediate reception of Pereira\u2019s\nwork was adverse and probably disappointing for the author, who could\nfeel misunderstood and unjustly attacked. In any case, the echo of his\nwork vanished soon, as evidenced by the fact that during the next\ncentury the references to the Antoniana and to G\u00f3mez\nPereira himself were very few.\n\nThe second period dates from the moment when G\u00f3mez Pereira\nbecame the object of the attention of those who saw in him a precedent\nof the philosophy of Descartes. The great occasion for this ephemeral\nchange arose from the French philosopher Pierre Bayle. Before him,\nVossius had already spoken of Pereira as a precursor of animal\nmechanism (Vossius, De theologia gentili, 1641 [1700: vol. V,\np. 345]). But when Bayle\nincluded Pereira in his Dictionnaire (Bayle 1730: vol. III,\npp. 649\u2013656), he gave rise to a debate about the true\noriginality of Descartes before the unquestionable precedent contained\nin the Antoniana Margarita. Bayle did not discuss\nPereira\u2019s merit as the true author of a primitive version of\nanimal mechanism, but he thought that the real originality should\nnevertheless be attributed to Descartes, because his mechanism derived\nfrom the firm principles of its philosophy, while Pereira had only an\ningenious occurrence without the support of a true system of\nprinciples such as that of Descartes.\n\nFrom this moment on, the figure of Pereira acquired a relevance like\nnever before. Even if Bayle tried to show the unmethodical way in\nwhich the doctor of Medina del Campo expressed his doctrine of\nanimals\u2019 lack of sensory perception, the fact is that it did not\ntake the opponents of Descartes long to spread the suspicion that he\nhad plagiarized some of the contents of the Antoniana\nMargarita. This accusation was known to the extent that Adrien\nBaillet, the great biographer of the French philosopher, was obliged\nto claim that the doctrine of animal mechanism had already been\nconceived by the young Descartes before he had the opportunity to know\nof the existence of Pereira\u2019s book (Baillet 1691: vol. I, p. 51\nff.). However, it has been maintained that neither the chronological\nobservations of Baillet nor the denial expressed by Descartes himself\nof having read Pereira\u2019s work completely rules out the\npossibility that he could have read Pereira\u2019s book in the\nNetherlands, where it was probably more accessible than in France.\nThose chronological reasons of Baillet were not accepted by many\nothers, such as Huet, who openly stated that Pereira had clearly\nanticipated Descartes in the theory of animal automatism (Huet 1689\n[1734: 193 ff.]).\n\nOther references to the work of G\u00f3mez Pereira can be found\nduring the transition from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century,\nfor example, in the Portuguese Jewish physician Isaac Cardoso, who\nedited his Philosophia libera in 1673. Here Pereira is placed\non the same level as Vall\u00e9s and Gassendi as a modern atomist\nwho rejected the Aristotelian concept of prime matter. Even in Leibniz\nhimself we can find traces of Pereira: in two letters dated on 1711\nand 1713 he said he was looking for a copy of the Antoniana,\nand after having found it, he recognized that the thought of Descartes\nwas not too different from that of Pereira. Leibniz believed, however,\nthat the French philosopher had not read his work.\n\nThe question of Descartes\u2019 debt to G\u00f3mez Pereira will be\nfound again among the Enlightenment writers, as we can see in the\nDictionaries of Calmeto, Moreri, Brucker, etc. (see Bandr\u00e9s\n& Llavona 1993: 133\u2013134). In the Encyclopedia of\nDiderot and D\u2019Alembert, particularly in the article devoted to\nthe soul of beasts, we may read that Descartes was the first who dared\nto treat animals as mere machines, even if G\u00f3mez Pereira had\nsaid something similar before him, but he arrived at this concept by\npure chance. The Enlightenment authors echoed the opinion of Bayle in\npointing out that Pereira did not draw his doctrine from any\nprinciple, and therefore his name had scant relevance: he suffered the\nsaddest thing that can happen to an innovator, \u201cil ne fit\npoint de Secte\u201d (Bayle 1730: vol. III, pp. 651).\n\nOne unexpected effect of the presence of G\u00f3mez Pereira in the\nFrench erudite elite, even if in a pale way, was the recovery of his\nwork during the eighteenth century. But, unfortunately for our author\nagain, this recovery did not involve any serious and detailed study of\nhis thought (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 109). The unique perspective\nadopted to comment on and analyze the contents of the Antoniana\nMargarita was determined by the notion of their possible\ninfluence on Descartes; moreover, the Spanish writers generally\nfollowed the sentence of Bayle denying such an influence. One of the\nmost notable exceptions was the Jesuit Juan de Ulloa, who after\nrefuting mechanism and atomism, said that, in spite of everything, he\nwas proud of the fact that some of his countrymen, such as Pereira and\nVall\u00e9s, had guided such powerful minds as that of Descartes\n(Bandr\u00e9s & Llavona 1993: 134).\n\nThis growing interest in animal mechanism and specifically in the\nAntoniana Margarita was the cause of the second and final\nedition of the book in 1749, whose preface and permission generously\npraised G\u00f3mez Pereira, and lamented the fact that such an\ninnovator had fallen into total oblivion among the philosophers of his\nown land. Unfortunately, this new edition did not remedy the\nprevailing ignorance about him, as one can realize by reading the\ndifferent works of natural philosophy and the dictionaries produced in\nSpain at that time, where there are few references to our doctor and\nthey seem to come from indirect sources, not from a direct reading of\nthe text.\n\nThis same poverty of references to G\u00f3mez Pereira\u2019s\nphilosophy was also present during the nineteenth century, at least\nuntil the moment when, in the context of a debate on Spanish science\nwhich was stimulated by Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo and J. M. Guardia,\namong others, the figure of G\u00f3mez Pereira was recovered as an\nillustrious example of a true scientific tradition, or on the contrary\nas an exception in the most desolate desert.\n\nIn the case of Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, whose interest in the\nAntoniana came from his youth, G\u00f3mez Pereira was\nconsidered as an outstanding physician, a great scholar and a true\npioneer of Cartesianism not only from the point of view of animal\nmechanism, but also as the first author of the famous cogito ergo\nsum (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 113). Later the Cantabrian\nscholar dedicated a detailed monographic study to the\nAntoniana, which he first published independently in 1878 and\nlater as an appendix to his famous work La ciencia\nespa\u00f1ola (Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo 1887\u20131888: vol. II,\nAppendix). Against the interpretative tradition that was\nrooted in Pierre Bayle\u2019s opinion with respect to the thought of\nPereira, Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo argued that in the Antoniana\nthere is a complete philosophical system based on well-established\nprinciples. The image of Pereira drawn by Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo was\nthat of a great thinker (comparable to Vives), a sincere Catholic who\nwas able to reconcile independence with orthodoxy, and someone who\nrepresented the living proof of the freedom of Spanish scientists\nunder the Inquisition.\n\nAnother relevant vision of the Castilian doctor, contemporary with\nthat of Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, can be found in the doctor, science\nwriter and Humanist Jos\u00e9 M. Guardia, who was educated in France\n(in fact, the majority of his works were published in the famous\nRevue Philosophique de la France et de l\u2019Etranger).\nGuardia destined an extensive study to the figure of G\u00f3mez\nPereira, for whom he felt a special affinity as a free thinker in a\nremarkably hostile environment (Guardia 1889: 270\u2013291,\n382\u2013407, 607\u2013634). He tried to present him as a victim of\nthe Inquisition in Spain: Pereira\u2019s unquestionable materialism\nwas soon persecuted, and his works almost disappeared. But, in spite\nof everything, an heroic Pereira was able to exercise a scientific\nmethodology which helped him to overcome all the prejudices\naccumulated over the long history of the scholastic school. From this\nperspective, Guardia held that the third part of the\nAntoniana devoted, as we have seen, to the immortality of the\nsoul, was only a subterfuge to \u201ckeep up appearances\u201d. For\nhim the central thesis of the book is the animal mechanism, where it\nis necessary to place Pereira\u2019s great originality. With regard\nto the \u201cCartesian question\u201d Guardia emphasized that\nneither Descartes nor the Cartesians wanted to recognize how much\ntheir philosophy owed to this Spanish doctor. This debate on the\ninterpretation and the meaning of Pereira\u2019s thinking somehow\ndetermined his recovery among the small number of Spanish scholars who\nhave focused their attention on the figure of G\u00f3mez Pereira\nduring the twentieth century (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1977: 120 ff.).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary sources: G\u00f3mez Pereira", "Primary sources: other", "Secondary sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary sources: G\u00f3mez Pereira": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1554, <em>Antoniana Margarita, Opus nempe physicis, medicis, ac\ntheologis non minus utile, quam necessarium, per Gometium Pereiram,\nmedicum Methinae Duelli, quae Hispanorum lingua Medina de el Campo\nappellatur, nunc primum in lucem aeditum</em>.
