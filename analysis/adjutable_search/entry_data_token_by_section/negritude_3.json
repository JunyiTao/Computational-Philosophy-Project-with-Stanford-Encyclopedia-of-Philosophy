    "main_text": "The inescapable disappearance of Eurydice\n4. The inescapable disappearance of Eurydice\n\nBy writing Black Orpheus as an account of the ultimate\nmeaning of the black poetry gathered in the Anthology Sartre\ntransformed N\u00e9gritude into an illustration of his own\nphilosophical theses and durably set the terms in which the concept\nwas to be discussed from then on.\n\nOne important point made by Sartre was that N\u00e9gritude was first\nand foremost a black poetic appropriation of the French language.\nUnlike other nationalisms, he explained, which reclaimed the tongue of\nthe people against the imperialist imposition of the language by which\nthey were governed, black people had to use the language of domination\nimposed by French colonialism as cement for their shared\nN\u00e9gritude and as \u201cmiraculous\n weapons\u201d[3]\n against that same domination. In so doing they radically transformed\nit, manifesting through their poetry that there was nothing natural\nand unquestionable in the way in which the language would identify\nBeing with Good, Beautiful, Right and White. The simple song of a\nblack poet chanting in French the beauty of the naked blackness of the\nwoman he loved, Sartre wrote, would then appear to the ears of French\npeople a fundamental violence against their linguistic and indeed\nontological self assurance; in spite of the fact that the poem was not\neven meant for them, or rather because of that. In the poetry of\nN\u00e9gritude they would be struck by the discovery of their own\nlanguage as unfamiliar and hitherto unheard of, especially when that\npoetry makes the best of surrealist writing as it \u201csmashes [the\nwords] together, breaks their customary associations, and couples them\nby force\u201d (Sartre 1976, 26). But then again one knows that such\nan unsettling of language and indeed its \u201cauto\ndestruction\u201d is the \u201cprofound aim of French poetry\n\u2026 from Mallarm\u00e9 to the Surrealists\u201d (1976, 25).\nTherefore, Sartre concludes, N\u00e9gritude has achieved that goal:\nthe poets of N\u00e9gritude have taken to its end what surrealist\nwriters had been calling for.\n\nSo while he praised N\u00e9gritude as the revolutionary poetry of\nthe time, Sartre maintained the traditional Marxist view about the\nproletariat being the sole true revolutionary class and actor of\nhistory. Just as Eurydice was the creation of Orpheus\u2019 power of\nevocation, N\u00e9gritude was a creation of poetry, a \u201cMyth\ndolorous and full of hope\u201d and like \u201ca woman who is born\nto die\u201d (Sartre 1976, 63). History and its laws had already\ncondemned N\u00e9gritude to be just a Poem, indeed a swan song: the\nfuture of liberation was in the hand of the proletariat, the universal\nclass who was going to bring effective revolution and liberation from\nall oppressions. When all is said and done and N\u00e9gritude has\npermitted the blacks to \u201craise relentlessly the great negro cry\nuntil the foundations of the world shall tremble\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire\u2019s Les armes miraculeuses quoted by\nSartre as the last words of Black Orpheus), it will have to\nbe shed \u201cto the profit of the Revolution\u201d (1976, 65) by\nthe only true actor of history which is the proletariat. In other\nwords the \u201cbeing-in-the-world of the Negro\u201d as Sartre\ndefined N\u00e9gritude using Heideggerian language is\n\u201csubjective\u201d while class is \u201cobjective\u201d: the\nnotion of race is concrete and particular, Sartre writes, while that\nof class is universal and abstract; in the terminology of Karl Jaspers\nthe first resorts to \u201ccomprehension\u201d while the latter\nresorts to \u201cintellection\u201d (1976, 59).\n\nAgain, Sartre\u2019s preface was a real kiss of death as it played an\nimmense role in popularizing the N\u00e9gritude movement and\ncontributed to establishing Senghor\u2019s Anthology as its\nmanifesto, but at the same time dismissed its historical significance\nby emphasizing that its being was ultimately only poetic, without real\n substance.[4]\n And in fact, ironically, Black Orpheus contained and\nannounced most of the criticisms that would be directed at\nN\u00e9gritude afterwards. First the criticism which very quickly\ncame from certain Marxists who accused N\u00e9gritude of creating\nthe distraction of \u201crace\u201d where there should be only a\nfocus on objective social contradictions in the historic phase of the\nstruggle of the Proletariat to bring authentic liberation to the\noppressed workers in Europe and the dominated peoples in the\n world.[5]\n To that criticism some would add that by emphasizing the particular\nand the concrete of race over the objective and the universal of the\nstruggle against capitalism and imperialism, the \u201cfathers\u201d\nof N\u00e9gritude, Senghor more specifically (since he led his\ncountry to independence and became its president for twenty years),\nseemed to imply that some cultural recognition and reconciliation was\nall that was needed: they accused N\u00e9gritude of being, for that\nreason, an ideology for neocolonialism. Sartre\u2019s\n\u201cpreface\u201d also foreshadowed the accusation of being an\nunfounded essentialism promoting the notion that black people shared a\ncommon identity, partaking in some enduring African-ness that defines\nthem beyond differences in historical trajectories and circumstances,\npersonal or collective.\n\nThe paradox of Sartre\u2019s preface to the Anthology by\nSenghor is that in many respects the N\u00e9gritude movement had,\nafter Black Orpheus, to define itself against Sartre\u2019s\npositioning of its philosophical meaning. It did so (1) by insisting\nthat it was not a mere particularism defined as the\nantithesis to a white supremacist view (with black self\naffirmation using the figure of inversion that Sartre characterized as\nan anti-racist racism (1976, 59)), before some dialectical post-racial\nsynthesis; (2) by showing that there was something\nsubstantial (and not just poetic) in the reference to African values\nof civilization by which Senghor had defined N\u00e9gritude: that\nN\u00e9gritude was indeed an ontology, an epistemology, an\naesthetics and a politics.\n",
