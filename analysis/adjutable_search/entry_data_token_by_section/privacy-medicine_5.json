    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Accountability\n1.5 Accountability\n\nConfidentiality thrives as a legal duty and institutional practice,\ndespite the emergent trend towards voluntary openness about personal\nmedical information. The specifics of health and medical care have\nbecome acceptable topics of ordinary conversation outside the family\ncircle. In the U.S., public figures have taken the lead, speaking out\nabout their Covid-19, heart attacks, AIDS, erectile dysfunction,\ndementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, melanoma, prostate cancer and\nbreast cancer. Disclosures that would have been considered indelicate\nor stigmatizing thirty years ago are made freely today, whether to\nmake conversation, share a concern, educate the public, or endorse a\nnon-profit or pharmaceutical product.\n\nTo a noteworthy degree, openness is also compelled by morals and law.\nAccountability for personal life is a feature of modern life, and\nmedical accountability is a feature of modern life. Being accountable\nmeans being called upon to share information, explain, adjust behavior\nor submit to sanction. In the wake of COVID-19, SARS, Ebola and AIDS,\nnew levels of information accountability gained public acceptance.\nWorld-wide, people are coming to think of minor and major contagious\nillnesses as conditions giving rise to public accountability. The\naccountability that is called for includes information gathering and\nsharing as a condition of travel between cities and countries or\nentering workplaces and schools. International travelers are asked to\nreport symptoms of illness to officials. International visitors have\ntheir body temperatures scanned for fever automatically as they\nproceed to customs in some airports, workers are asked the same as a\ncondition of enter workplaces. Mandatory testing, reporting, contact\ntracing and the use of prescribed symptom-checking apps, are examples\nof health information accountability. Beyond accountability for health\ninformation, the COVID-19 pandemic has made people accountable for\nmask wearing, hand washing, self-isolation, social gathering and other\nbehaviors once considered purely personal. Decisions whether to\nvaccinate are also subject to moral and legal accountability, whether\nto prevent measles, COVID-19, or flu. \n\nMany people speak openly about health matters with strangers as a\ncondition of receiving and paying for health care. For example, a\nfamily needing the assistance of a regional mental health/mental\nretardation agency unavoidably places reams of sensitive information\nin the hands of government. (Bridges 2017) The same is true of a\nfamily which needs to apply for government benefits for aging or\ndisabled kin. The more disclosures a family must make, the wider the\ncircle of confidentiality and the lesser the medical privacy.\nQuestions of distributive justice are raised by mandatory disclosures\nto government made as a condition of access to care. Poor and disabled\npersons dependent upon medical assistance from government have\nsubstantially less informational privacy vis-\u00e0-vis\ngovernment than wealthy and healthy persons. The risks and burdens of\nstate knowledge of the individual are disproportionately borne by the\nleast well off segments of society.\n",
