    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Philosophy || The revised metaphysical view of Hegel\n2.4 The revised metaphysical view of Hegel\nNot surprisingly, the strong post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel\nhas been resisted by defenders of the more traditional approach, who\nhave argued against the plausibility of attempting to rehabilitate\nHegel\u2019s philosophy by divesting it of any purportedly\nunacceptable metaphysical claims (see, for example, Beiser 2005 and\nHorstmann 2006).  Proponents of the post-Kantian view, it is commonly\nsaid, are guilty of projecting onto Hegel views they\nwould like to find there rather than what is actually to be\nfound. However, the strong post-Kantian interpretation\nhas also been challenged by a somewhat different version of\nthe metaphysical reading by interpreters who, while recognizing the\ninfluence of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy of Hegel, emphasize\nHegel\u2019s critique of Kant and affirm the irreducible role played\nby a form of metaphysics in Hegel\u2019s philosophy.  Nevertheless,\nthey share the post-Kantians\u2019 attempts to separate Hegel\u2019s\nviews from the extravagant views traditionally ascribed\nto him and generally argue for the broad acceptability of\nHegel\u2019s views from the perspective of the present. Here one\ntends to find interpreters attributing to Hegel some type of\nconceptual realism, sometimes appealing to\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics for the legitimacy of\nmetaphysics conceived as inquiry into the fundamental\nfeatures or structures of the world\nitself. Among the interpreters advancing something like this\nrevised metaphysical view might be counted Stephen\nHoulgate (2005b), Robert\nStern (2002, 2009), Kenneth Westphal\n(2003), James Kreines\n(2006, 2008) and Christopher Yeomans (2012).\nOn a number of points, the proponents of the revised conceptual\nrealist metaphysical interpretation will agree with advocates of the\npost-Kantian non-metaphysical approach. First, they tend\nto agree in dismissing much of the extravagant\nmetaphysics traditionally ascribed to Hegel. Generally they\ndon\u2019t find in Hegel the type of classical teleological spirit\nmonism central to, say, Taylor\u2019s interpretation. Next, they\nstress the importance for Hegel of Kant\u2019s critique of\nmetaphysics. Both think that Hegel took Kant\u2019s critique\nseriously, and in turn subjected that critique itself to a\ntelling meta-critique, showing that Kant himself was not free\nfrom the sorts of ungrounded metaphysical assumptions he criticized in\nothers. However, while the post-Kantians interpret Hegel\u2019s\ncriticisms of Kant as suggesting that Hegel thereby realized or\ncompleted Kant\u2019s critical intention, creating a\nform of philosophizing purged of metaphysics, proponents of the\nrevised metaphysical interpretation typically see his criticism of\nKant as involving a rejection of Kant\u2019s anti-metaphysical\nattitude, and as reestablishing, on a new basis, a metaphysical\nprogram originally derived from Aristotle (e.g., Stern) or Spinoza\n(e.g., Houlgate).\nWhile it is for the most part clear what sets both post-Kantians\nand conceptual realists against the traditional view, it is still not\nclear which issues dividing them are substantive and which are\nultimately verbal. Brandom, for example, while often classed with the\npost-Kantians, also construes Hegel as a conceptual realist (Brandom\n2019), while Redding, appealing to the earlier work of J. N. Findlay,\nattempts to combine the post-Kantian approach with what he calls\nan actualist rather than a realist interpretation of Hegel\n(Redding 2017). In recent work, both Pippin (2019) and Pinkard (2014),\nthe major representatives of the post-Kantian position, have insisted\nthat their own interpretations are compatible with many of the\nAristotelian features of Hegel to which conceptual realists allude.\n\nIn relation to such debates it must be remembered that Kant himself\nwas not critical of metaphysics per se. His claim was that\nexisting (so-called dogmatic) metaphysics was in a state analogous to\nthat in which, say, physics had been in before the scientific\nrevolution of sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Rather than wanting\nto eliminate metaphysics, after the style, say, of Hume or the modern\nlogical positivists, Kant had wanted to put metaphysics itself on a\nsecure scientific basis analogous to what Galileo and Newton had\nachieved for physics. Thus the very idea of an\nHegelian metaphysics is in no way straightforwardly\nincompatible with the project of a post-Kantian\ncompletion of Kant\u2019s critical program. \n\n",
