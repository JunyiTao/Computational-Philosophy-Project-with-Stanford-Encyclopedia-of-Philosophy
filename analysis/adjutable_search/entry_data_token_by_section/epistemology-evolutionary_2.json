    "main_text": "History, Problems, and Issues || Ontogeny versus Phylogeny\n1.2 Ontogeny versus Phylogeny\n\nBiological development involves both ontogenetic and phylogenetic\nconsiderations. Thus, the development of specific traits, such as the\nopposable thumb in humans, can be viewed both from the point of view\nof the development of that trait in individual organisms (ontogeny)\nand the development of that trait in the human lineage (phylogeny).\nThe development of knowledge and knowing mechanisms exhibits a\nparallel distinction. We can consider the growth of an\nindividual\u2019s corpus of knowledge and epistemological norms or of\nan individual\u2019s brain (ontogeny), or the growth of human\nknowledge and establishment of epistemological norms across\ngenerations or the development of brains in the human lineage\n(phylogeny). The EEM/EET distinction cuts across this distinction\nsince we may be concerned either with the ontogenetic or phylogenetic\ndevelopment of, e.g., the brain or the ontogenetic or phylogenetic\ndevelopment of norms and knowledge corpora. One might expect that\nsince current orthodoxy maintains that biological processes of\nontogenesis proceed differently from the selectionist processes of\nphylogenesis, evolutionary epistemologies would reflect this\ndifference. Curiously enough, however, for the most part they do not.\nFor example, the theory of \u201cneural Darwinism\u201d as put forth\nby Edelman (1987) and Changeaux (1985) offers a selectionist account\nof the ontogenetic development of the neural structures of the brain.\nKarl Popper\u2019s conjectures and refutations model of the\ndevelopment of human knowledge is a well known example of a\nselectionist account which has been applied both to the ontogenetic\ngrowth of knowledge in individuals as well as the trans-generational\n(phylogenetic) evolution of scientific knowledge. B. F.\nSkinner\u2019s theory of operant conditioning, which deals with the\nontogenesis of individual behavior, is explicitly based upon the\nDarwinian selectionist model (Skinner 1981).\n",
