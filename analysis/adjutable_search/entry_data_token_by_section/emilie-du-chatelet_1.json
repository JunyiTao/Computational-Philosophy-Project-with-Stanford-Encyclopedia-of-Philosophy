    "main_text": "First Principles of Knowledge\n2. First Principles of Knowledge\n\n\nDescartes famously writes in the preface to the Principles\nthat \u201cthe whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other special sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics, and morals\u201d (AT\nVIIIa, 14; CSM 1, 186). Metaphysics is his starting point, but\nwhat Descartes means by metaphysics, and what falls under the\nrubric of metaphysics for him, is crucial to understanding his project,\nand for understanding Du Ch\u00e2telet's conceptual relation to\nhim. One of the central innovations Descartes makes in the field of\nmetaphysics is to include metaphysical claims about the mind of the\nknowing subject (Hatfield 1990, 11\u201317). This element of metaphysics\nleads Descartes very quickly into a discussion of first principles of\nknowledge, such as his belief that the knowing subject is capable of\nrationally intuiting further metaphysical principles because God has\nimplanted innate ideas about them within human souls.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's starting point\u2014her first chapter\nof the Foundations\u2014is also a consideration of first\nprinciples, but she starts immediately with first principles of\nknowledge, and hers are very different from Descartes'. Indeed,\nher first principles are distinctively Leibnizian and Wolffian, and\nnumber exactly two; they are the principle of contradiction (hereafter\nPC) and the principle of sufficient reason (hereafter PSR). In what\nfollows, we present some general ideas that are helpful to bear in\nmind when thinking about Du Ch\u00e2telet's use of the PC and\nPSR. We then draw some important conclusions regarding these principles\nas they are found in Wolff, noting points on which Wolff departs from\nLeibniz with regard to first principles of knowledge. And finally, we\nturn to a consideration of how Du Ch\u00e2telet employs these\nprinciples in her work.\n\n\nThere are a number of different ways of articulating the PC,\nincluding the\n following.[3]\n\nA is A, and cannot be ~A.\nFor any proposition P, it is not the case that P is\nboth true and false.\nFor any proposition P, P is either true or\nfalse.\nFor any proposition P, if P is false, then ~P\nis true.\nFor any proposition P, if P implies a contradiction,\nthen P is false.\nFor any proposition P, if P is or is reducible to an\nidentical proposition, then P is true.\n\n\n\n(1) equates the PC with the Principle of Identity. (3) through (5)\nbring together the Law of Non-Contradiction (hereafter LNC) and the Law\nof the Excluded Middle (hereafter LEM) within the PC. These versions of\nthe PC rely upon opposition based in contradictories. That is,\nP and ~P are mutually inconsistent and cannot be both true (LNC), and\nthey are mutually exhaustive (LEM). (6) relies upon the LNC only, and\nnot the LEM. This formulation of the PC, that is, relies upon\nopposition based in contraries. For example, \u201cP is\nhappy\u201d, and \u201cP is sad\u201d are contraries and thus\nmutually inconsistent and cannot both be true (LNC). But they are not\nmutually exhaustive, because they both can be false (and thus,\nthe LEM does not hold in these cases). The PC can be intended as a\nlogical, ontological or psychological principle. As a logical\nprinciple, the PC is about opposite assertions. As an ontological\nprinciple, the PC is about properties in a subject.\nAs a psychological principle, the PC is about what is possible and,\nespecially, impossible to believe. Finally, the PC can operate in\ndifferent realms. For example, it can operate in the realm of\nmodality, perhaps serving to pick out necessary truths.\nAlternatively, it can operate in the realm of standard areas of\nhuman inquiry, perhaps serving as the foundation of mathematics\n(but perhaps not in metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines).\n\n\nAs with the PC, there are different ways of articulating the PSR,\nincluding the\n following.[4]\n\nThere is nothing that is without a reason why it is, and is not\notherwise. (Also: For any fact or event that obtains or exists, there\nis some reason why it obtains or exists, and is not otherwise.)\nThere is no effect without a cause. (Also: any existing thing\nmust have something, either within its nature or outside of itself, as\nits cause.)\nFor any proposition P that is true, there is an explanation for\nits truth.\nIt is impossible to fail to account for something if you have\nenough information (even though humans often do not have\nenough information).\nThere are no brute facts.\n\n\n\nThe PSR embodies the position that everything is explainable and\nthus intelligible. The PSR can also be used to explain a number of\ndifferent things, including the coherence of a thing's\nessence, that essences have a cause, and the\nexistence of things. These points can also be captured by the\ndepiction of the PSR as the principle which accounts both for the\npossibility of things (i.e. due to the coherence of their\nessences), and for the actualization of essences (i.e. there\nis a cause of their actualization which thus brings them into\nexistence). Sometimes the PSR is taken to have a very wide\ndomain (e.g. all truths and all events), while sometimes the PSR is\ntaken to have a narrower domain. For example, the domain of the PSR is\nsometimes only events, but not truths, even while some truths (but not\nmathematical truths) can be translated into events. Or, as another\nexample, sometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be only the domain\nof contingent truths but not necessary truths.\nSometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be all truths,\nwith the sufficient reason for the truth of necessary truths being that\ntheir negation violates the PC. There are different ways of thinking of\nthe relation between the PC and the PSR, the two most prominent being,\nfirst, that the PC and the PSR are equally fundamental, and, second,\nthat only the PC is fundamental, with the PSR either playing a role of\nsecondary importance or being derived from or proven by the PC.\nFinally, as with the PC, the PSR can operate in different realms. For\nexample, it can operate in the realm of modality, perhaps\nserving to explain contingent truths. Alternatively, it can operate in\nthe realm of standard areas of human inquiry, perhaps serving\nas the foundation of metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines (but not mathematics).\n\n\nAs should be clear from the above, there is no single and settled\nversion of either the PC or the PSR, different thinkers employ them\ndifferently, and sometimes a single thinker employs them differently in\ndifferent periods of their thought or in different texts and contexts.\nIn what follows, we sketch one respectable interpretation of\nWolff's use of these principles\u2014together with notes on\nwhere he departs from Leibniz's (admittedly multi-faceted) use of\nthe principles\u2014at least in part because Wolff's approach\ndoes seem to be fairly close to Du Ch\u00e2telet's own.\n\n\nFor Wolff,[5] the\nPC is fundamental, and it is an innate first\nprinciple. Methodologically, Wolff starts with the psychological\nimpossibility of believing or judging that something both is and is\nnot. Wolff thus accepts version number 2 above of the PC, and he\nstarts with the first person awareness of one's psychological\ninability to not accept the PC so presented. This psychological\nawareness further reveals the logical impossibility of any proposition\nthat asserts that something is both true and false at the same time,\nand the logical impossibility of a proposition that asserts contraries\nfurther reveals the ontological fact that something cannot have\ncontrary properties.  The PC first and primary job, then, for Wolff is\nto divide impossible concepts and things\u2014concepts and things\nthat embody a contradiction\u2014from possible concepts and\nthings\u2014concepts and things that do not embody a\ncontradiction. Possible concepts for Wolff include both necessary\ntruths and contingent truths.  Thus, the fundamental and first job of\nthe PC for Wolff includes the work of dividing both necessary and\ncontingent truths from impossible truths. As result, in the realm of\nmodality, the PC serves to identify not only necessary truths, but\nalso contingent truths, pace Leibniz for whom, in the realm\nof modality, the PC serves to identify necessary truths. Once\nimpossible concepts and things are isolated from the rest, the PSR\nenters to further explain aspects of possible things.  It does so in\ntwo ways. First, the PSR acts as a \u201cprinciple of being\u201d in\nthe sense that there is a sufficient reason to explain the essence of\nany possible being; there is a sufficient reason why a being's essence\nis as it is. This role for the PSR is relevant in the case of both\nnecessary beings and contingent beings, and on this point, Wolff once\nagain divergences from Leibniz in that the latter often (though not\nalways) restricts the role of the PSR to that of providing an\nexplanation for why contingent beings, though not necessary beings,\nare as they are. For Leibniz (usually), the PC explains why necessary\nbeings (and truths) are as they are. Still, the divide between Wolff\nand Leibniz on this point may be narrower than it seems, because for\nWolff, the sufficient reason why a necessary being is as it is just is\nthat the PC establishes this. The second way in which the PSR enters\nthe picture to further explain aspects of possible things for Wolff is\nthat it acts as a \u201cprinciple of becoming\u201d. In this role,\nthe PSR gives the causes or grounds for why a possible being becomes\nactual as opposed to remaining possible but non-actual.\n\n\nWith this general background on our two great principles in place,\ntogether with how these principles operate in Wolff (sometimes in\ncontrast with how they operate in Leibniz),  we now turn to a\nconsideration of how these principles operate in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's opening chapter of the Foundations.\nWhile we cannot here do full justice to Du Ch\u00e2telet's\naccount of the first principles of knowledge, we  provide some essential\nbackground to these principles in order to set the stage for an\nevaluation of other central aspects of her natural philosophy as\npresented in the Foundations.\n\n\nAs with Leibniz and Wolff, Du Ch\u00e2telet's two primary first\nprinciples of knowledge are the PC\u2014\u2018the basic axiom upon\nwhich all truths are founded\u2019, which is consequently the\nfoundation of all certainty (\u00a74)\u2014and the PSR (\u00a78).\nThese two principles operate not by opening up a category of\nmetaphysical truths that are innate to our minds. Rather, they operate\nby giving universal (perhaps one would want to call these\ninnate)[6]\nprocedures for delineating what is possible from what is\nimpossible, and then for determining what is necessary and what is\nactual (as opposed to non-actual) from among the range of\npossibilities. Du Ch\u00e2telet's first use of the PC, then, is\ndecidedly Wolffian for its task is to separate the impossible from the\npossible.\n\n\nThe PC is foundational in all our thinking. At its most basic, this\nprinciple seems to be, for Du Ch\u00e2telet, the principle that: for\nany proposition P, if P implies a contradiction, then P is false (5\nabove): \u2018For, if one once granted that something may exist and\nnot exist at the same time, there would no longer be any\ntruth\u2026\u2019 (IP \u00a74). According to Du Ch\u00e2telet once\nthis principle as stated is acknowledged, one can divide claims into\nthe impossible and the possible: \u2018It follows from this\n[principle] that the impossible is that which implies contradiction,\nand the possible does not imply it at all\u2019 (IP \u00a75). The\npossibles include the possibilities from among which God created the\nworld.\n\n\nBut the PC does more work for Du Ch\u00e2telet than just separating\nout the possible from the impossible, and on this point, she leans more\ntoward Leibniz's use of this principle than toward Wolff's\nuse of it, for the PC secondarily divides the category of the possible\ninto truths that are necessary from those that are contingent. At this\nsecond stage, she seems to be employing a new conception of the PC. To\nshow this, we examine her way of distinguishing between necessary and\ncontingent truths. Necessary truths are \u2018truths which can only be\ndetermined in a single way, for this is what is meant by the term\nnecessary\u2019 (IP \u00a77). Immediately after this\n(admittedly odd) definition she contrasts necessary truths with\ncontingent truths, \u2018that is to say, when a thing can exist in\nvarious ways\u2019 (IP \u00a77), indicating that necessary truths are\nclaims about things that can exist in only one way. To use her own\nexamples to further clarify (IP \u00a78), geometrical truths are\nnecessary because, for example, a triangle (generally conceived) can\nexist in only one way, i.e., it is a figure whose three angles added\ntogether are equal to the sum of two right angles. We cannot conceive\nof it in any other way. Conversely, truths about the posture Du\nCh\u00e2telet finds herself in are contingent because she can exist in\nmany ways, i.e., standing, sitting, lying down and so forth. Implicit\nhere is a version of the PC which states that for any proposition P if\nP is or is reducible to an identical proposition, then P\nis necessarily true (6 above, with the modality of necessity\nadded). For \u2018triangle\u2019 and \u2018a figure whose three\nangles added together are equal to the sum of two right angles\u2019\ncan be reduced to an identity statement (triangles can exist only in\nthat one way) while \u2018Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019 and \u2018sitting\ndown\u2019 cannot be reduced to an identity statement (Du\nCh\u00e2telet can exist in many other\nways).[7] A\ncrucial lesson to be drawn from her approach just outlined is that she\ntakes the human's everyday experience\u2014including our\npsychological inability to imagine, for example, necessary geometrical\ntruths differently than how they are\u2014as telling us something\nmetaphysically true about the world itself. That is, like Wolff, she\nstarts with a psychological rendition of the PC, but draws ontological\nconclusions from this starting point.\n\n\nAccording to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the PSR is \u2018[t]he principle on\nwhich all contingent truths depend\u2026\u2019 (IP \u00a78). Given\nwhat follows, the most consistent way to interpret Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nclaim here is not to assume that the PSR picks out all\ncontingent truths, for this is clearly the work of the PC (when that\nlatter principle is used to identify necessary truths, with the\nleftovers therefore being contingent). Rather, Du Ch\u00e2telet seems\nquite clearly to mean that the PSR explains why the contingent truths\nthat actually obtain in the world do obtain. Thus, she seems\nto accept the second of Wolff's ways in which the PSR further explains\naspects of possible things: the PSR acts as a \u201cprinciple of\nbecoming\u201d. It also acts as a \u201cprinciple of being\u201d in\nso far as it explains essences, but it explains the essences of\ncontingent things, while the essences of necessary things are\nexplained by the PC for her (pace Wolff, but in keeping with\nLeibniz's usual approach). So, immediately after her definition of the\nPSR given above, she writes that:\n\n\nWhen asking someone to account for his actions, we persist with our\nown question until we obtain a reason that satisfies us, and in all\ncases we feel that we cannot force our mind to accept something without\na sufficient reason, that is to say, without a reason that makes us\nunderstand why the thing is what it is, rather than something\ncompletely different. (IP\u00a78, emphasis added)\n\n\nAccording to this interpretation of the PSR, it is the principle\nthat explains why some contingent truths actually obtain while others\ndo not (there is no sufficient reason for these others to obtain). The\nPSR is also the reason that led God to actualize this world from among the\nvarious possibilities (IP \u00a79); that is, to reiterate the\ninterpretation offered here, it is the principle that explains why our\ncontingent universe exists rather than any number of other such\npossible, but not necessary, universes. The PSR serves as (a) the principle of\nbecoming (b) of contingent beings only.\n\n\nDu Ch\u00e2telet indicates what the PSR requires of us as\ninvestigators of nature. In the closing sections of her chapter on the\nnature of body (\u00a7162\u20134), she makes clear that since full\nknowledge of contingent truths is too complex for humans to grasp\nthrough rational intuition (IP \u00a79), we need to turn to some other\nway of learning them. But because God is bound by the PSR, we cannot\nappeal directly to his will as the \u2018explanation\u2019 of these\ntruths, and so we must turn to proximate causes rather than the\nultimate cause for explanation. We must investigate nature in order to\ntry to discern causes of effects\u2014that is, in order to discern\nthe sufficient reason why effects obtain. Empirical observations that\nwe have of how bodies actually do operate in the actual world will\nlead the investigator to beliefs about features of bodies. These\nfeatures, however, are not taken to be certainly true as a result of\ntheir being supposedly known by introspection into our innate ideas\n(as they are for Descartes). It may be, therefore, that we are unable\nto know the sufficient reason for why actuals exist as they do exist,\nthough we surely know that there is a reason, for our\nexperience tells us that actual beings were chosen to exist rather\nthan not to exist.  But God knows the sufficient reason, and it is the\nreason why he actualized the beings that he did: \u201cWithout the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, one would no longer be able to say\nthat this universe, whose parts are so interconnected, could only be\nproduced by a supreme wisdom, for if there can be effects without\nsufficient reason, all might have been produced by accident, that is\nto say, by nothing\u201d (IP \u00a78, p. 129).\n\n\nTwo important aspects of Du Ch\u00e2telet's broader philosophy are\ncaptured by this passage just quoted. The first is that she takes the\nnatural world to be a whole whose parts are systematically\ninterconnected. This natural systematicity is crucial to her\nscientific method, it sets her apart from many of her French\nEnlightenment peers, but there are nonetheless important limits to her\nwillingness to call upon systematicity in her approach to\ninvestigations of the natural world.  We address these points in\n\u00a75 and \u00a76 below. The second important point implicit in the\nabove-cited passage is that she clearly sides with what we would now\ncall the intellectualist side of the voluntarist-intellectualist\ndebate. Crudely, the debate centers around whether God's will or God's\nintellect takes precedence in his actions with respect to the created\nworld, including the act of creation itself. A voluntarist would say\nthat God's will takes precedence, and God could will anything to be\nthe case. Whatever he wills just would be true and\ngood because he willed it. Thus, God could have willed 2+2=5\nto be true, and it would thereby be true. Conversely, an\nintellectualist would say that God's intellect takes precedence in his\nactions with respect to creation, including creation itself. He first\nunderstands what is true and good, and then he wills that certain\nthings should attain\nbecause his intellect understands the truth and goodness of\nthem (and his benevolence guides his choice). Earlier, Du\nCh\u00e2telet wavered on how to interpret the relation between God's\nwill and intellect, but by the time she wrote the\nFoundations, she had clearly settled for the intellectualist\nside, and the PSR guides God in his choices no less than it guides\nhumans. On this point, she is squarely in opposition to Voltaire who\nsuggests that we should not search for, in his words,\n\u201csufficient causes\u201d in nature for natural phenomena;\nrather we should bear in mind that the first cause of nature's\nactivities is to be referred to God's will and\n power.[8] \nIt is enough to appeal\nto this as the source of phenomena, and then leave it at that. Du\nCh\u00e2telet dissents from this approach, and not just because it\nmistakes, in her view, God's nature. Rather, it is an appeal we ought\nnot to make as scientists (IP \u00a7162), for it is an\nutterly unscientific approach to a natural problem, putting the cause\nof the phenomena wholly beyond our ability to investigate \n it.[9] \nWe return to this point in \u00a75 below.\n\n\nTwo further points are of particular importance in Du Ch\u00e2telet's\ndiscussion of first principle of knowledge. The first is her noting\nthat the term \u201cprinciple\u201d \u201chas been much\nabused\u201d, especially by \u201cthe Scholastics, who could\ndemonstrate nothing [and who] chose unintelligible words for their\nprinciples\u201d (IP \u00a71, p. 125). The PSR, she later tells us,\nbanishes these unintelligible principles such as \u201cplastic\nnatures, vegetative souls\u201d (IP \u00a710, p. 131). Without\ndetailing how the PSR might banish such other principles, we focus on\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's own conception of the sort of intelligible\nmetaphysical principle identified by the PSR, for she favors\nthe mechanical philosophy over, for example, plastic natures and\nvegetative souls. According to Du Ch\u00e2telet, one must explain how\na mechanism can produce a plant relying, for example, upon an\nexplanation of how each particle of matter is able to produce the\neffect that it does (IP \u00a710 and \u00a712, p. 131\u20132) through\nsimple motion. Accounting for natural change by appeal to bits of\nmatter interacting through lawful motion and contact\u2014but not by\nappeal to plastic natures and vegetative souls\u2014is consistent\nwith the PSR.\n\n\nThe second point of particular importance in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's discussion of first principles of knowledge is\nwhat may be taken as her moderate form of nativism, in contrast with\nDescartes' much stronger form. Du Ch\u00e2telet does not have the\nsort of first principles of knowledge, together with a commitment to\nvoluntarism, that lead to the doctrine of innate ideas, as we see in\nDescartes. That is, Descartes has been characterized as a voluntarist\nwho believes that God created the eternal truths through an act of\nwill; God did not understand, through an act of the intellect, that the\neternal truths just are true independently of any will, his own\nincluded. Fine details on Descartes' position with respect to the\nvoluntarist-intellectual debate aside, it is true that he does believe\nGod endowed all rational creatures with innate ideas of the eternal\ntruths such that we might all come to know their certain truth despite\nthe fact that they could have been otherwise. Du Ch\u00e2telet does\nnot endorse this kind of nativism. But it is true that, unlike Locke\nfor\n example,[10]\nshe does think there are some\nuniversally held principles such as the belief that something cannot be\nand not be at the same time (PC), and to this degree, she does seem\ncommitted to some sort of nativism. But because of her requirement that\none demonstrate a contradiction (in the case of the PC) or\nthat one demonstrate the reasons one has for one's\nactions (in the case of the PSR, e.g. IP \u00a78, p. 128\u20139) in\nemploying these universally-held first principles of knowledge, her\nnativism is of a different and weaker form than is Descartes'\nnativism. Hers describes innate rules of reasoning that (as we shall\nsee) can then be used to develop a metaphysics, while Descartes'\nnativism directly delivers robust metaphysical information about the\nworld. Once again, we see shall the impact of this characteristic of Du\nCh\u00e2telet's starting point upon her methodology as well as\nher understanding of the relation between physics and metaphysics.\n\n",
