    "main_text": "Implications of the Distinction || Sentence Meaning\n5.1 Sentence Meaning\nWhile much of the discussion about primary and secondary meaning is centered on words, there are significant implications for sentence meaning. Among those who accept the genuine compositionality of sentences, contra the spho\u1e6da theorists above, there are two theories of how words combine in context to convey a unified meaning which differ over the role of secondary meaning.\nOn the \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view (abhihit\u0101nv\u0101ya) accepted by Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, words convey their meanings, and then, in conjunction with three conditions, these meanings are related together through secondary meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101). The three conditions mentioned in section 4.3 are expectancy of connections (\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101), semantic fit (yogyat\u0101), and cognitive contiguity (\u0101satti or sannidhi). Expectancy of connections is defined either syntactically or in terms of a hearer\u2019s psychological state of desiring words to fit together. Semantic fit is the requirement that the sentence makes sense, prima facie, and contiguity is the requirement that words are uttered in a temporally adjacent sequence or that they are closely related in the hearer\u2019s mind. The view that the meaning of a sentence is due to the secondary signification of words is not necessarily connected to Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view that words denote universals, as V\u0101caspati, in his Drop of Truth (Tattvabindu), defends this position despite elsewhere subscribing to Ny\u0101ya theories of meaning. V\u0101caspati argues explicitly that indication is responsible for the relationship (anvaya) between word-meanings and argues that it is commensurate with a Naiy\u0101yika position (Sastri 2014; Phillips 2015).\nIn favor of this view, its defenders observe that there must be some common word-meaning among sentences such as \u201cBring the cow,\u201d \u201cSee the cow,\u201d \u201cBring the sheep,\u201d and \u201cSee the sheep\u201d in order for hearers to understand what is being communicated. What we learn as language-users, through trial and error and association of these various sentences with the world, is the invariable meaning of the words. Against this \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view, \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha and other Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara philosophers, as discussed earlier, argue that what is remembered on hearing an individual word does not constitute a genuine meaning without its being connected to the other words\u2014emphasizing the inferential element of meaning. Their view, the \u201cdesignation of meanings-as-connected\u201d (anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na), rejects the role of secondary meaning as a sentence-unifier.\nJayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, a Ny\u0101ya philosopher, takes up a third position, on which word-purport (t\u0101tparya) plays the unifying functional role. This sense of t\u0101tparya is different from later uses of the term to mean speaker intention. His theory of word-purport is accepted by Abhinavagupta who includes it in The Eye 1.4 among his list of functions (v\u1e5btti-s) of language: the primary, secondary, word-purport, and suggestion (Graheli 2016). For both Jayanta and Abhinavagupta, the idea that the secondary meaning function is also responsible for sentential unity was unacceptable. Abhinavagupta summarizes the four capacities and their characteristics as\n\nPrimary meaning (abhidh\u0101) \u2013 conveys the individual word-meanings in their ordinary sense, according to convention\nPurport (t\u0101tparya) \u2013 conveys the entire sentence meaning which would not otherwise be intelligible\nSecondary meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) \u2013 along with factors like blocking the ordinary sense, conveys another meaning\nSuggestion (dhvani) \u2013 along with the hearer\u2019s imaginative abilities, based on the first three powers, it suggests another meaning.\n\nThe crucial distinction between the \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view and the two others is whether the secondary meaning function has a role to play before the sentence meaning is understood. Abhinavagupta explicitly says that it is not possible to have an obstacle for primary meaning without first understanding the syntactical connections among words. Thus secondary meaning can only occur after the capacity of purport. He distinguishes between nonsensical but syntactically acceptable sentences such as \u201cThere are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger\u201d and phrases which are syntactically faulty, \u201cTen pomegranates, six pancakes\u201d (DL: 1.4b L, page 86).\nFinally, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da identifies a theory, most likely his own, which he calls \u201cthe combined view\u201d (Keating 2019). It takes secondary meaning to apply both before and after sentence meaning. His understanding of secondary meaning is broader than both \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha and Abhinavagupta, as it does not always replace the primary meaning. So it can play the role of purport and can also encompass the function of suggestion. Thus, where the division between primary and secondary meaning is made, and how secondary meaning is characterized has important consequences for all these views of sentence meaning.\n",
