The term \u201cxingbie\n\u6027\u522b\u201d (natural differences) or \u201cshehui\nxingbie \u793e\u6703\u6027\u522b\u201d (societally\nconstructed natural differences) now used to translate\n\u201cgender\u201d is a neologism introduced during the 1990s as a\nlocal, internal response to the importation of western feminist\ntheories (Spakowski 2011: 31\u201354; Dai 2019: ch. 12; S. Y. Chan\n2023). Whatever the concept of \u201cgender\u201d stands for in\ncontemporary feminist discourse, it does not have a clear, ready-made\nChinese counterpart in its linguistic memories, ancient or modern.\nPrior to the 1990s, the term \u201cn\u00fcxing\n\u5973\u6027\u201d (woman/female nature) is the closest\napproximation used to designate a sense of universal\n\u201cwomanhood\u201d or the \u201cfemale sex\u201d outside their\nkinship roles. And, just like the later variants of\n\u201cxingbie\u201d and \u201cshehui\nxingbie\u201d used to translate the concept of\n\u201cgender\u201d, \u201cn\u00fcxing\u201d is also a\nneologism constructed during the 1920s by the May Fourth Movement as\npart of their modernization project to mark the end of the indigenous\nrepresentation of \u201cwomen\u201d as fun\u00fc\n\u5a66\u5973 (married women and young maidens) (C. S. Chan 1988:\n19\u201339; Barlow 1989, 1994a,\n 1994b).[1]\n\nAccording to the earliest etymological dictionary, Discussing\nWriting and Explaining Characters (Shouwen jiezi), the\ncharacter n\u00fc \u5973 was defined synonymously as\nfu \u5a66 (married women). The overlapping of\nn\u00fc \u5973 and fu \u5a66 points to the\nprioritization of kinship roles in the process of genderization.\nGenerally speaking, n\u00fc refers to daughters or young\nmaidens, a life-stage before becoming fu. The synonymy of\nn\u00fc \u5973 and fu \u5a66 (as well as\nnan \u7537 and zhangfu \u4e08\u592b, i.e.,\nhusband) as defined by the Shouwen jiezi, hence, can be seen\nas a linguistic clue to the Chinese conception of nann\u00fc\n\u7537\u5973 (man/woman), who are essentially fufu\n\u592b\u5a66 (husband/wife) in waiting.\n\nThe concept of \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cgender\u201d as a\nkinship-neutral discursive category hence is absent in the Chinese\nintellectual traditions including Confucianism. The lack of an\nindigenous linguistic equivalent of \u201cgender\u201d or\n\u201cwomen\u201d, to some (as it is for the May Fourth thinkers in\nthe 1920s as well as for some contemporary feminists who seek to bring\nChinese women\u2019s movements into the fold of the global feminist\nmovements), serves as an indication of the conceptual inadequacy, if\nnot backwardness, of Chinese society to articulate gender and to\ncontribute to this very modern project of feminist\ndiscourse/movements. But, for others, the imposition of western\nconceptual paradigms distorts the subject matter at hand and\nconsequently misconstrues the roots of gender oppression as well as\nits possible solutions in the study of gender in Confucianism (Hall\n& Ames 1998: 79\u2013100; 2000: 75\u201396; Rosenlee 2006). This\nlinguistic trouble of \u201cgender\u201d serves to highlight the\nconceptual chasm in the inter-cultural discourse of\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d, which itself is also a much debated\ninexact translation of Ru \u5112 (Jensen 1997; Standaert\n1999; Barrett 2005; Csikszentmihalyi 2020; Richey 2023)\n",
