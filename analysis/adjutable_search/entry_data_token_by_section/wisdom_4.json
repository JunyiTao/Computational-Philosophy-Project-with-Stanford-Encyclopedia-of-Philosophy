    "main_text": "Hybrid Theory\n5.  Wisdom as Rationality\n\n\nThe final theory to be considered here is an attempt to capture all\nthat is good, while avoiding all the serious problems of the other\ntheories discussed thus far.  Perhaps wisdom is a deep and\ncomprehensive kind of rationality (Ryan, 2012).\n\nDeep Rationality Theory (DRT): \nS is wise iff \n\n\nS has a wide variety of epistemically justified beliefs\non a wide variety of valuable academic subjects.\nS has a wide variety of justified beliefs on how to live\nrationally (epistemically, morally, and practically).\nS is committed to living rationally.\nS has very few unjustified beliefs and is sensitive to\nher limitations.\n\n\nIn condition (1), DRT takes account of what is attractive about\nsome knowledge theories by requiring epistemically justified beliefs\nabout a wide variety of standard academic subjects.  Condition (2)\ntakes account of what is attractive about theories that require\nknowledge about how to live well. For example, having justified\nbeliefs about how to live in a practically rational way would include\nhaving a well-reasoned strategy for dealing with the practical aspects\nof life.  Having a rational plan does not require perfect success.  It\nrequires having good reasons behind one\u2019s actions, responding\nappropriately to, and learning from, one\u2019s mistakes, and having a\nrational plan for all sorts of situations and problems.  Having\njustified beliefs about how to live in a morally rational way would\nnot involve being a moral saint, but would require that one has good\nreasons supporting her beliefs about what is morally right and\nwrong, and about what one morally ought and ought not do in a wide\nvariety of circumstances.  Having justified beliefs about living in an\nemotionally rational way would involve, not dispassion, but having\njustified beliefs about what is, and what is not, an emotionally\nrational response to a situation.  For example, it is appropriate to\nfeel deeply sad when dealing with the loss of a loved one.  But,\nordinarily, feeling deeply sad or extremely angry is not an\nappropriate emotion to spilled milk.  A wise person would have\nrational beliefs about the emotional needs and behaviors of other\npeople.\nCondition (3) ensures that the wise person live a life that\nreflects what she or he is justified in believing is a rational way to\nlive. In condition (4), DRT respects epistemic humility.  Condition\n(4) requires that a wise person not believe things without epistemic\njustification.  The Deep Rationality Theory rules out all of the\nunwise poets, politicians, and craftsmen that were ruled out by\nSocrates.  Wise people do not think they know when they lack\nsufficient evidence.  Moreover, wise people are not epistemically\narrogant.\n\nThe Deep Rationality Theory does not require knowledge or perfection.\nBut it does require rationality, and it accommodates degrees of\nwisdom.  It is a promising theory of wisdom.\n",
