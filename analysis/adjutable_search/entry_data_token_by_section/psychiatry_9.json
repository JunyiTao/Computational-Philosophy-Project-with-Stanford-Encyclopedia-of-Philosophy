    "main_text": "Explanation || Cross-Cultural Issues\n3.5 Cross-Cultural Issues\n\n\nSuccessive editions of the DSM have been published in North America,\nand questions have always arisen about the applicability of its\ncategories outside the West. DSM-5 follows its predecessor in coping\nwith cross-cultural variety in two ways. First, some conditions, such\nas depression and anxiety, are treated as universal \u2013 found in\nevery culture, despite local differences in character. We may term\nthis the unificationist project. The DSM-IV-TR averred that major DSM\ncategories occur all around the world but with symptoms and courses\nthat are influenced by local cultural factors.  Second, DSM-IV-TR employed the concept of culture-bound syndromes, which were\ndefined as \u201crecurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant\nbehavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a\nparticular DSM-IV diagnostic category\u201d (p. 898). Culture-bound\nsyndromes occur in a limited number of specific societies or cultural\nareas.  They are local, often traditional, diagnostic categories that\nmake sense of patterns of thought and behaviour that are treated as\ndeviant or troubling in that context. \n\n\nIn theory, culture-bound syndromes are those folk illnesses in which\nalterations of behaviour and experience figure prominently, relative\nto local norms. Standard DSM diagnoses are not thought of in this way,\neven if they are culturally limited. Multiple Personality Disorder/\nDissociative Identity Disorder, for example, was widely diagnosed in\nthe USA in the 1980s, but seldom found elsewhere. That did not lead\npsychiatrists to treat it as a culture-bound syndrome, even though it\nseems to fit the definition. The assumption in mainstream psychiatry\nis that Western conditions are not culture-bound; they represent\nabnormalities in a universal human endowment. This is the case even\nfor conditions (such as some kinds of body dysmorphia) for which\nprevalence data only exists in a few western nations. \n\n\nDSM-5 has moved away from concept of a culture-bound syndrome and\nadopted that of \u201ccultural concepts of distress\u201d (p.758).\nThese are ways in which \u201ccultural groups experience, understand\nand communicate suffering, behavioural problems or troublesome\nthoughts and emotions\u201d. DSM-5 distinguishes three main types of\ncultural concepts: syndromes, idioms (ways of expressing distress),\nand local explanations. The last is particularly interesting: a\nstandard picture of mental illness in both non-Western and premodern\nsocieties represents it as explained by supernatural forces like ghost\npossession. But Edgerton (1966) reported that the East African tribes\nhe studied were divided over the explanation of psychosis. Some tribes\ndid understand it in terms of ghost possession, but others thought of\nit as having an organic cause (\u201cbrain worms\u201d). DSM-5 makes\nroom for such findings as part of the integration of local\nexplanations into a theory of mental illness.\n\n\nDSM-5 supplements this conceptual reform with a thorough overhaul of\nthe \u201cOutline for Cultural Formulation\u201d. This is an\ninterview outline introduced in DSM-IV-TR, in part in response to\npleas from cross-cultural psychiatrists dissatisfied with the old ways\n(e.g. Canino and Alegria 2008). It reflects an unprecedented\ninvestment in applying anthropology to psychiatry by the DSM-5\nCultural Issues Subgroup, who ran field trials of the new Cultural\nFormulation Interview (CFI) in 6 sites around the world (Aggarwal\n2013). The CFI is designed to assess both the cultural or ethnic\ngroups that the subject belongs to and the ways in which those groups\nunderstand the problem and affect the subject\u2019s experience of\nit. It comprises a series of questions designed to gather information\nfrom the point of view of the patient and his or her cultural peers,\nincluding specific questions that tell the patient not to repeat what\nthe doctor has told them but to express their problems as they see\nthem and describe which aspects of their identity are most important\nto them. It could be used with any subject anywhere, and the manual\nacknowledges that all mental illness, including the DSM diagnoses, is\nshaped by the surrounding culture. On the other hand, the CFI and its\nassociated conceptual material are poorly integrated into the DSM-5\n\u2013 many diagnoses pay no attention to cultural formulation at all\n\u2013 and the culture-bound syndromes do in fact survive. They have\nbeen renamed \u201cCultural Concepts of Distress\u201d but the\nappendix listing them survives, so one may wonder how thorough the\noverhaul has been.\n\n\nThe other approach to cultural variation, as mentioned, is to treat\ndifferent diagnoses as manifestations of the same underlying DSM\ncondition. The issue is how different a diagnosis needs to be before\nit stops being a form of a DSM condition and becomes a culture-bound\nsyndrome. It has been suggested that anxiety disorders, for example,\nshould have their \u201cworry domains\u201d expanded because people from other\ncultures may worry about things that Euro-Americans don\u2019t fret\nover (Lewis-Fernandez et al 2010). The assumption here is that anxiety\ndisorders are common enough in all human cultures to merit treating as\na universal, but that this can be missed if clinicians do not\nappreciate the different triggers, reactions and conceptions that\ndistinguish the anxiety disorders in different populations. We need to\nrecognise the greater variety of symptoms among sufferers from anxiety\nwho live in Western cultures but don\u2019t show the typical symptoms\nof a Westerner. Lewis-Fernandez and his team (2010) argue that a\nmajority of Latino sufferers from ataque de nervios would meet panic\ndisorder criteria, for example, if the DSM amended the requirement\nthat a panic attack lasts only a few minutes. Ataque de nervios was\nlisted as a culture-bound syndrome in DSM-IV-TR. Its symptoms commonly\ninclude a mix of classic panic attack symptoms like palpitations and\nsensations of bodily heat and loss of control. But it may also involve\nuncontrollable shouting and threats of violence, together with other\nsymptoms less often found in panic attacks, and it may last much\nloner. Lewis-Fernandez is interested in the idea that ataque de\nnervios can be assimilated to existing anxiety diagnoses provided we\ntake the variation in symptomatology more seriously.\n\n\nThis unificationist approach may be used to argue that the diagnostic\nentity itself is the same in all cases \u2013 some shared underlying\nprocess that adapts or responds to different cultural settings to\nproduce different behaviors. Some scholars argue that the underlying\nabnormality, even if it exists, is beside the point. Our response to\nthe condition should be determined by its expression, even if there is\nan underlying psychological kind. Kleinman argued that depression in\nthe West and in East Asia are different enough in their expression and\ncourse that they should be seen as different conditions (1987, 450):\n\u201cDepression experienced entirely as low back pain and depression\nexperienced entirely as guilt-ridden existential despair are such\nsubstantially different forms of illness behavior with different\nsymptoms, patterns of help-seeking, course and treatment responses\nthat though the disease in each instance may be the same, the illness\nrather than the disease is the determinant factor.\u201d \n\n\nHorwitz and Wakefield (2007, p. 199) opt for universality in response:\n\u201cwe agree with Kleinman\u2019s distinction between disease as a\nuniversal underlying dysfunction and illness as the culturally shaped\nexpression of a given dysfunction \u2026 [but] if there are indeed\nunderlying common dysfunctions, then treatment presumably depends in\nlarge part on the science of identifying and intervening in such\ndysfunctions irrespective of their cultural presentation.\u201d \n\n\nThe unificationist project is an empirical bet that is based on the\nassumption that human psychology is enough alike to treat at least\nsome culturally distinctive forms of mental disorder as expressions of\na shared human nature that is differently shaped by local culture. The\nappeal to culture bound syndromes is also a perfectly good bet,\nreflecting the idea that some forms of behaviour are entirely local\nand not assimilable to a universal model.  Both unificationism and\nrecognition of culture-bound syndromes could be pursued at the same\ntime. Given the boring but probably correct observation that people\naround the world are both alike and different, that may be the obvious\ncourse.  However, pursuit of these strategies should be freed from the\napparent assumption in DSM-5 that western minds are the blueprint for\nthe world. The western form of a condition may be unusual: the more we\nlook, the more it seems as though the cognitive aspects of depression\n\u2013 the complex psychology of self-blame and immiserating\nintrospection \u2013 may be distinctively Western. There may be\nconditions that DSM treats as universal but which in fact are\nculture-bound syndromes that only exist in NATO countries.\n",
