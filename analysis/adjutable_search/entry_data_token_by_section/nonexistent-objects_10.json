    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || The De-ontologization Strategy\n5.1 The De-ontologization Strategy\n\nTim Crane (see Crane 2012 and 2013) holds that all of the following\nclaims are true:\n\nWe can think and talk about nonexistent objects.\nNonexistent objects do not have any kind of being whatsoever.\nThe sentence \u201cThere are nonexistent objects\u201d is\ntrue.\nSome predications with non-referring singular terms in subject\npositions are true, e.g.: \u201cVulcan was a planet postulated by Le\nVerrier\u201d; \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous than any living\ndetective\u201d; \u201cPegasus is a mythical horse\u201d.\nContrary to what Meinongians think, nonexistent objects do not\nhave all of the properties they are characterized as having. For\ninstance, Pegasus is a not a horse; thus, \u201cPegasus is a\nhorse\u201d is not true (although \u201cPegasus is a mythical\nhorse\u201d is). Neither is the round square round.\n\n\nCrane can hold the conjunction of 1 and 2 because he interprets\naboutness in a non-relational way. He can hold the\nconjunction of 2 and 3 because he denies that \u201cthere are\u201d\nand its cognates (both in natural and formal languages) are\nontologically committing in any way. (For this reason, I call this the\nde-ontologization strategy.) He can hold the conjunction of 4 and 5\nbecause he endorses a positive free logic, i.e., the view that there\nmay be true as well as false sentences of the form \\(Fb\\), where\n\u201c\\(b\\)\u201d stands for a non-referring singular term.\n\nBy denying that Pegasus is a horse and the round square is round Crane\ncircumvents some of the above-mentioned problems of Meinongianism.\nHowever, his view raises another problem: Why is \u201cPegasus is a\nmythical horse\u201d true, while \u201cPegasus is a horse\u201d is\nnot? In general, why is it that certain predications with\nnon-referring singular terms are true and others are not? For,\naccording to the de-ontologization strategy, neither \u201cPegasus is\na mythical horse\u201d nor \u201cPegasus is a horse\u201d can be\nmade true by the referent of \u201cPegasus\u201d, because there is\nno such thing. Crane (2013) offers what he calls a\n\u201creductionist\u201d solution to this problem. That is,\naccording to Crane, sentences \u201cabout\u201d nonexistent objects\nare made true by something else, i.e., by something existent. For\ninstance, the sentence \u201cVulcan was a planet postulated by Le\nVerrier in 1859 to explain the perturbations in the orbit of\nMercury\u201d is made true by certain events in 1859, namely by\npostulation events; the sentence \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous\nthan Sir Ian Blair\u201d is made true by the fact that more people\nhave heard about Sherlock Holmes than about Sir Ian Blair (where to\nhave heard about Holmes is to have heard about the respective\nstories); the sentence \u201cPegasus is a mythical winged horse that\nsprung into being from the blood of Medusa\u201d is made true by a\nmyth which represents Pegasus as being such-and-such; the sentence\n\u201cSiegfried is one of the most unappealing heroes in all dramatic\nworks\u201d is made true by certain facts about the last two parts of\nWagner\u2019s Ring. As these examples already show, Crane\ndoes not give a uniform, systematic account of the truth of sentences\nabout fictitious objects, as he himself concedes. (See Crane 2013,\nSection 5.5.)\n\n\nFor another example of a reductionist solution, Frank Jackson holds\nthat one can assent to \u201cMr. Pickwick is Dickens\u2019 most\nfamous character\u201d without an ontological commitment to\nfictitious characters in general and Mr. Pickwick in particular. For,\naccording to Jackson\u2019s de-ontologization strategy, object\nlanguage sentences are ontologically neutral. Ontological commitment\ncomes in only at the meta-language level, for instance, if we would\nclaim that the name \u201cMr. Pickwick\u201d denotes Dickens\u2019s\nmost famous character or that the predicate \u201ca character in\nDickens\u201d applies to something. (See Jackson 1980.)\n\nA de-ontologization strategy with respect to fictitious characters is\nalso to be found in Crittenden 1973 and in Azzouni 2010.\n",
