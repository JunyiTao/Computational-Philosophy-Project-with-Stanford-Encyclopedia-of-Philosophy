    "main_text": "\n\nSocial norms, the informal rules that govern behavior in groups and\nsocieties, have been extensively studied in the social sciences.\nAnthropologists have described how social norms function in different\ncultures (Geertz 1973), sociologists have focused on their social\nfunctions and how they motivate people to act (Durkheim 1895 [1982],\n1950 [1957]; Parsons 1937; Parsons & Shils 1951; James Coleman\n1990; Hechter & Opp 2001), and economists have explored how\nadherence to norms influences market behavior (Akerlof 1976; Young\n1998a). More recently, also legal scholars have touted social norms as\nefficient alternatives to legal rules, as they may internalize\nnegative externalities and provide signaling mechanisms at little or\nno cost (Ellickson 1991; Posner 2000).\n\nWith a few exceptions, the social science literature conceives of\nnorms as exogenous variables. Since norms are mainly seen as\nconstraining behavior, some of the key differences between moral,\nsocial, and legal norms\u2014as well as differences between norms and\nconventions\u2014have been blurred. Much attention has instead been\npaid to the conditions under which norms will be obeyed. Because of\nthat, the issue of sanctions has been paramount in the social\nscience literature. Moreover, since social norms are seen as central\nto the production of social order or social coordination, research on\nnorms has been focused on the functions they perform. Yet\neven if a norm may fulfill important social functions (such as welfare\nmaximization or the elimination of externalities), it cannot be\nexplained solely on the basis of the functions it performs. The\nsimplistic functionalist perspective has been rejected on several\naccounts; in fact, even though a given norm can be conceived as a\nmeans to achieve some goal, this is usually not the reason why it\nemerged in the first place (Elster 1989a, 1989b). Moreover, although a\nparticular norm may persist (as opposed to emerge) because of some\npositive social function it fulfills, there are many others that are\ninefficient and even widely unpopular.\n\nPhilosophers have taken a different approach to norms. In the\nliterature on norms and conventions, both social constructs are seen\nas the endogenous product of individuals\u2019 interactions (Lewis\n1969; Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Vandershraaf 1995; Bicchieri 2006). Norms\nare represented as equilibria of games of strategy, and as such they\nare supported by a cluster of self-fulfilling expectations. Beliefs,\nexpectations, group knowledge and common knowledge have thus become\ncentral concepts in the development of a philosophical view of social\nnorms. Paying attention to the role played by expectations in\nsupporting social norms has helped differentiate between social norms,\nconventions, and descriptive norms: an important distinction often\noverlooked in the social science accounts, but crucial when we need to\ndiagnose the nature of a pattern of behavior in order to intervene on\nit.\n",
