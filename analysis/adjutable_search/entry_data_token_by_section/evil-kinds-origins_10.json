    "main_text": "Radical Evil: Four Conceptions || Radical Evil as Violation of the Moral Law\n7.1 Radical Evil as Violation of the Moral Law\n\nKant argues in Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone\n(1793) that free choices against the moral law are unintelligible in\nthe sense that they are irrational; our propensity to make\nthem is thus an inexplicable mystery at the \u201croot\u201d\n(radix) of our moral psychology. The post-Kantian idealist\nF.W. J. Schelling, picking up the refrain, rejects the Privation\nTheory of radical evil in favor of the view that it has its origin in\nthe positive, irrational decision to prefer self-advantage over the\nmoral law, though \u201cjust how the decision for good or evil comes\nto pass in the individual, that is still wrapped in total\ndarkness\u201d (Schelling 1809 [1936: 59]).\n\nOn the Kantian view of radical evil, then, there is a normative sense\nin which it is \u201cunintelligible\u201d: it is an\nirrational propensity and thus cannot be\n\u201cunderstood\u201d in the sense that it cannot be sanctioned by\nproper reason. Likewise, an immoral choice cannot be fully explained:\nfull explanations appeal to good reasons, and there are no good\nreasons for wrongdoing.\n\nThere is a broader sense of \u201cunderstand\u201d or\n\u201cexplain\u201d, however, in which such evil is no mystery at\nall: it is the most depressingly familiar thing in the world. Everyday\nimmoral agents presumably see what they are doing under the aspect of\nsome good or other\u2014good for their company, good for\ntheir bonuses, good for their reelection efforts\u2014even if they\nalso know that what they are doing is ultimately wrong. If we\ninterpret the war cry of Milton\u2019s Satan\u2014\u201cEvil be\nthou my good!\u201d (1667, Paradise Lost, Bk IV, line\n110)\u2014as implying that he is taking evil under the guise of the\ngood, then it is not absurd. But it is still not wholly\nintelligible, either.\n\nThe Kantian conception of radical evil, then, says that that the\nunintelligibility of wrongdoing does not prevent us from assigning\nblame, holding perpetrators responsible, and refusing to taint the\ninnocent. This explains why Jaspers found the conception so\nattractive:\n\n\nTo rank the will to happiness, which dominates among men\u2019s\nmotives, above the unconditioned law that shows itself in\nreason\u2014that is the root of evil, the\n\u201cpropensity\u201d which Kant calls \u201cradical evil\u201d.\n(Jaspers 1962: 321)\n\n7.2. Radical Evil as Choosing Evil for its own Sake\n\nSome philosophers, and more than a few novelists and screenwriters,\nfind the view that agents are always choosing under \u201cthe guise\nof the good\u201d as inadequate to the psychology of extreme\nmalevolence. It may have suited the melioristic conceptions of the\nEnlightenment, but the well-publicized, mechanized horrors of the\nrecent past allegedly demand a bleaker picture of perpetrator\npsychology. Serial killers, murderous dictators, torturers,\nderivatives traders: the idea is that at least some of these malign\nactors see their own actions as atrocious\u2014as making the\nworld worse rather than better on the whole (and sometimes worse for\nthemselves)\u2014and yet still choose to perform them. They are thus\nnot saying \u201cEvil be thou my good\u201d, at least on the\ninterpretation just offered. Rather, they are self-consciously\nmale-volent: they will the bad under the aspect of the\nbad. And yet they are not insane\u2014this is what makes their\nactions especially difficult for the rest of us to understand. This is\na second common way in which the term \u201cradical evil\u201d is\nused. (See Pauer-Studer and Velleman 2015 for a reading of Milton\naccording to which Satan\u2019s war cry is interpreted in this\nway.)\n\nAugustine reports in his Confessions that during the pears\nincident he took pleasure in\n\n\nthe theft and sin itself.\u2026 Behold, now, let me heart tell Thee\nwhat it was seeking there, that I should be gratuitously wanton,\nhaving no inducement to evil but the evil itself. It was foul, and I\nloved it \u2026 I loved my own error \u2013 not that for which I\nerred, but the error itself. (Confessions Bk 2, Chap. IV,\nparagraph 9 [1876: 30])\n\n\nIt is tempting to say that in \u201cloving the sin itself\u201d,\nAugustine was in some sense taking it to be good. But he at least\ngestures here at this second conception of radical evil: some acts can\nbe performed under the aspect of their own abject deformation and\nrottenness\u2014as ultimately bad even for the agent himself.\n\nAs we have seen, the Prussian philosopher who coined the term\n\u201cradical evil\u201d 1400 years later did not think\nthat it can involve choosing evil for its own sake. In fact, Kant\nargues that such a \u201cdiabolical\u201d conception of evil is\nincoherent or at least psychologically inapplicable to human beings.\nKant\u2019s skepticism, however, did not prevent Dostoyevsky from\ncomposing Notes from the Underground (1864) as an extended\nand somewhat plausible portrait of one man\u2019s effort to choose\nevil qua evil. And there are more recent accounts of people\nwho confess\u2014in private diaries or braggadocios\ndepositions\u2014that they did what they did because it was\nevil.\n\nIn this context, consider (if you can bear it) Stone 2009\u2019s\nportraits of the worst serial killers: although some perpetrators\nreport that they take what they are doing to be good\u2014ridding the\nworld of \u201cgarbage women\u201d, giving someone his \u201cjust\ndeserts\u201d, correctly following the orders of the voices in their\nhead, and so on\u2014others openly admit that what they are doing is\nbad, wrong, evil, despicable, and so on. In such cases, the\nperpetrators are not making a series of unsound inferences, or\nmistaking the bad for the good. Rather, they seem to be engaged in a\nself-conscious turning away from anything that could be regarded as\ngood by anyone. Radical evil on this conception is sometimes\ndescribed as a self-conscious turning away from being itself\n(Eagleton 2009: 16; L. Russell 2014: 23).\n\nIf Augustine\u2019s confessions about the pears\u2014or these more\nspectacular recent confessions\u2014are accurate, then there may be\n(contra Kant) a baffling diabolical state that some people\ncan fall into, and that the rest of us cannot entirely fathom. The\nunintelligibility here thus threatens to raise Jaspersian concerns\nabout exoticization and taint.\n7.3. Radical Evil as Repudiation of the Moral Law\n\nA third conception of \u201cradical evil\u201d takes the term to\nrefer to acts or practices (like slavery and genocide) that do not\nmerely violate rational principles but also constitute an effort to\nrepudiate moral rationality altogether, or at least to\ntranscend it. When we steal or lie, there is a sense in which we might\nbe failing to treat others with the respect that they deserve. And as\nwe have seen, Kant does not hesitate to view such irrational choices\nas stemming from our propensity to \u201cradical evil\u201d. But\nradical evil on this third conception is different: it involves an\nintentional refusal to acknowledge that some group of persons has\nany moral standing at all\u2014the kind of moral standing\nthat would prohibit us from instigating or complying with their\nhumiliation, degradation, or extinction.\n\nRadical evil of this sort, in other words, denies the universal\nscope\u2014and thus, perhaps, the very existence\u2014of the moral\nsphere altogether. It is anti-rational rather than merely\nirrational: this is what threatens to make it incomprehensible or\ninexplicable in a unique way. This is also presumably what the early\nArendt means when she says that radical evil involves making human\nbeings \u201csuperfluous\u201d.\n\nBy way of analogy: suppose that ordinary moral wrongdoing is like\nmaking a bad move in chess, or like cheating by moving one\u2019s\npieces in an illegal way when one\u2019s opponent isn\u2019t\nlooking. A radically evil act on the present conception, by contrast,\nwould be like crushing all of the opponent\u2019s pieces and upending\nthe table. The player who does the latter is no longer or perhaps\nnever was a player: she cannot explain her behavior by saying that she\nwas trying to win by making what turned out to be a bad move or a\ncheat. She cannot explain her behavior in terms of chess at\nall. Likewise, a radically evil act is supposed to transcend the terms\nof moral rationality.\n\nThe analogy extends only so far, however. That\u2019s because there\nare still some reasonable explanations left to our\nnon-player\u2014explanations external to the game:\n\n\nI was hungry, so I crushed all of your pieces and swept them off the\nboard in the hopes that you would suggest lunch.\n\n\nBy contrast, it is not obvious how there can be any credible\nreason given for doing something that constitutes a denial of\nreason altogether. That is why radical evil in the\nrepudiative sense threatens to be uniquely unintelligible and\ntroubling. If someone\u2014not a beast or a machine, but a human\nbeing\u2014acts in a way that entirely disclaims not just an\nawareness of moral authority but also the basic rules of moral reason\naltogether, he effectively places himself in an antelapsarian state,\nunburdened with the knowledge of good and evil. His act asserts that\nhe has transcended entirely the moral sphere\u2014that what he does\ncannot be wrong.\n\nCan human beings really perpetrate radical evil in this sense? Richard\nRamirez, the \u201cNight Stalker\u201d serial killer in 1980\u2019s\nLos Angeles, certainly took himself to be doing so. He repeatedly\nsnuck into people\u2019s houses to rape and kill them, sometimes\ncutting off body parts and taking them with him. After his fourteenth\nmurder, he was caught and then boasted to his captors:\n\n\nYou don\u2019t understand me\u2026 you are not capable of it. I am\nbeyond good and evil\u2026I love to kill people. I love to watch\nthem die. I would shoot them in the head and they would wiggle and\nsquirm\u2026 I love all that blood. (quoted in Stone 2009: 208).\n\n\nThis idea\u2014that a human being could do something that would\nenact his own transcendence of moral norms, make other\npersons superfluous, and establish his own status as somehow\n\u201cbeyond good and evil\u201d\u2014is what concerned Karl\nJaspers, and what he was hoping Arendt would resist. In her\nface-to-face confrontation with the quotidian, bureaucratic evil of\nAdolf Eichmann, she seems to have changed her mind (though see\nCesarani 2007 and Margalit 2019 for a portrait of Eichmann that\nresists her famous \u201cbanality thesis\u201d). But even if Arendt\nultimately repudiated the repudiative conception of radical evil,\nothers remain sympathetic to some version of it (e.g., Bernstein 2002\nand Motzkin 2019).\n7.4. Radical Evil as Systemic Evil: Human Beings Made Superfluous in Another Way\n\n\u201cSystemic\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d evil exists at the\nlevel of groups, networks, races, and collectives rather than merely\nat the level of individuals (see\n section 5).\n The fourth conception of \u201cradical evil\u201d applies the\nconcept to particularly rampant or entrenched evils of the systemic\nsort.\n\nAlthough Arendt\u2019s interest was in totalitarian state systems,\ncontemporary philosophers are equally interested in non-state but\nstill super-human systems: corporations, collectives, markets,\nartificial intelligences. These are now some of the most potent\nsources of value and disvalue at work in the world. As noted in\n section 5,\n the nature of systemic evil is empirical, but its origin is more\ndifficult to grasp. Corporations have boardrooms and executive suites,\nand are even treated as persons by some legal systems, but (as\ninvestigation after investigation indicates) it is hard to find the\nheart of their darkness when assigning responsibility. Still-powerful\nsystems of white supremacy are based in structures of which no\nindividual human mind was or is fully aware (Rothstein 2017).\nLikewise, markets, algorithms, blockchains, and various forms of\nartificial intelligence arise out of innumerable individual human\nefforts, but are also designed to make human beings\nsuperfluous in a literal and unprecedented way. Some of this is and\nwill be for the good\u2014there are already fewer back-broken menial\nlaborers in the fields or exhaust-guzzling toll collectors on the\nhighways. But some will surely be for the bad, and in ways that are\nnot foreseeable. Radical systemic evil\u2014especially in a\ntechnological age\u2014does not seem natural or spooky, but it does\nnot seem fully moral either.\n\nIn sum: although natural, moral, and spooky non-agential conceptions\nof the origins of evil were the focus of most traditional discussions\nof the origins of evil, it looks like some varieties of radical evil\nhave a different origin altogether\u2014one that is not entirely\nintelligible. This raises Jaspersian concerns: a world in which\n(non-Kantian) radical evils are widespread is one in which ascriptions\nof moral responsibility are increasingly difficult to make.",
