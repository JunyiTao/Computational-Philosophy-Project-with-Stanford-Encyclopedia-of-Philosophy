    "main_text": "Some Issues that Cut Across Several Themes || Natural Resources and Global Justice\n10.1 Natural Resources and Global Justice\n\nDiscussion of natural resources often figures prominently in several\ntopics of global justice. Some relevant questions include: Are\nnational communities entitled to the resources they find on their\nterritories? Should principles of global justice apply to our\narrangements for justly distributing natural resources? Charles Beitz\nwas an early proponent of a resource distribution principle, according\nto which natural resources should be allocated such that each society\nis able to provide adequately for its population (Beitz 1975). We saw\nin\n Section 2\n that Rawls believes that resources are not important to prosperity in\nthe ways many imagine. Rather, institutional resilience matters more.\nBy contrast, Thomas Pogge highlights the ways in which international\npractices concerning the distribution of resources create considerable\nobstacles for prosperity in developing countries. In short, these\npractices create incentives for the wrong kinds of people to take\npower through illegitimate means and to focus on retaining power at\nthe expense of other goals governments should have, such as trying to\nimprove the well-being of their citizens. We need to modify these\ninternational practices so they do not create such an unfavorable\nenvironment. In addition, Pogge proposes a Global Resources Dividend\nas one measure by which practices concerning natural resource\ndistribution would work in some small way to the benefit of the global\npoor. On this Global Resources Dividend proposal there would be a\nsmall tax on resource extraction, payable by the consumers of\nresources, and available for projects that would assist in helping\neveryone to be able to meet their basic needs with dignity (Pogge\n2008).\n\nLeif Wenar is also concerned with prevailing practices governing the\nsale of natural resources and their products (Wenar 2010, 2016). When\nconsumers in wealthy states buy goods from developing countries, this\nis often similar to consciously receiving stolen goods. Legitimate\nresource sales require general agreement from citizens. Evidence of\nagreement requires that: (i) owners must be informed about sales, (ii)\nowners must be able to express dissent freely should they have doubts\nabout sales, and (iii) owners should be able to stop resource sales\nwithout fearing grave consequences such as violence and intimidation.\nWenar aims to outlaw dispossession of citizens\u2019 resources by\npromoting various practices that would satisfy these conditions and\npromote clean trade (Wenar 2016).\n\nFor various reasons (including strategic ones) Thomas Pogge and Leif\nWenar do not directly challenge the right of nations to own resources\non their territories. Policy recommendations, are much more likely to\nbe effective if they can fit within the main structures of\ninternational conventions. However, other theorists do take up this\nissue including Hillel Steiner (2005), Tim Hayward (2005) and Mathias\nRisse (2005, 2012b). Steiner argues that all inhabitants of the world\nare entitled to an equal share in the value of all land and he\nadvocates for the \u201cGlobal Fund\u201d which aims to ensure that\nequal share entitlements can be secured. The Global Fund would\nconstitute a clearing house for payments and disbursements (Steiner\n2005).\n\nAppealing to accounts of ownership of resources, some philosophers\ndraw out important implications for diverse global justice debates.\nMathias Risse argues that we all, collectively, own the resources of\nthe earth and this has profound implications for a range of global\njustice issues, including immigration. When people are under-utilizing\ntheir \u201crightful shares\u201d of territory, they cannot complain\nwhen co-owners would like to occupy some of it. Some theorists\nconcerned with environmental issues also discuss our rights with\nrespect to natural resources. Some argue that we have equal rights to\naccess the earth\u2019s resources. Tim Hayward, for instance, argues\nthat we have equal rights to ecological space (Hayward 2005). This is\noften appealed to when there is a perception that we have exceeded our\nshare, such as in levels of carbon emissions and consumption more\ngenerally.\n\nAccounts according to which we have equal rights to resources, land,\necological space and so on, are often accused of suffering from an\nimportant common problem. It is difficult to defend a clear and\ncompelling account of the value of resources as these can vary\nconsiderably in different social, cultural and technological contexts.\nBut we need to be able to quantify resource values to some plausible\nextent, if we are to determine whether people are enjoying or\nexceeding their equal shares (Armstrong 2017).\n\nOthers defend territorial sovereignty for other reasons. Some, like\nCara Nine argue that collectives have a right to territory when they\n\u201cestablish legitimate, minimal conditions for justice within a\ngeographical region\u201d (Nine 2012, 2022). While Anna Stilz argues\nthat states allow people to associate in specific geographical\nlocations and realize economic, social, and cultural values free from\ninterference as long as they respect others\u2019 rights to associate\nas well (Stilz 2019). She defends collective self-determination that\nrepresents subjects\u2019 political will and ensures self-directed\nagency and non-alienation where this is compatible with global\njustice. Stilz maintains that actual states only have a legitimate\nright to territory if they have rightful occupancy, implement a system\nof basic justice, and represent the shared will of most inhabitants.\nBut, even when they do not, she thinks states can be justified in\nruling a territory if they are the only available way of providing\ndecent rule or changing their boundaries will jeopardize urgent\ninterests or come with high costs (Stilz 2019).\n\nOthers argue against territorial sovereignty or for reconceiving\nsovereignty in a way that encourages respect for human rights and can\nlimit our tendency towards war, coercion, inequality and collective\naction problems (Chatterjee 2011; Held 1995). Some maintain that all\nwho are affected by states\u2019 actions should have a say in their\nrules while others reject this conclusion. For discussion, see\nBuchanan and Keohane 2011.
