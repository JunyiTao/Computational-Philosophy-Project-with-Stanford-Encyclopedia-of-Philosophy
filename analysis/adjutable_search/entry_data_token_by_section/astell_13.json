{
    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue Theory\n4.3 Deontological Ethics\n\nGiven that Astell discusses duties to love God and neighbor,\nit is possible to read Astell as part of the deontological tradition.\nThis tradition focuses on moral agents insofar as they have duties\nthey must discharge. Such a reading may develop along the following\nlines.\n\nHumans have duties to God based on their relationship with God: the\nhuman originates in God and God communicates his\nperfections\u2014namely those of freedom and rationality\u2014to the\nhuman; thus humans have the duty to understand and obey God\u2019s\nwill, participate in the divine, contribute to the world\u2019s moral\nperfection, and bring glory to God.\n\nHumans also have duties to themselves and their fellows, namely to\ncultivate their own rational capacities and to help others do the\nsame. This discharge has social ramifications: a human with perfected\nrationality and freedom has the ability to engage properly in\nfriendships and marriages.\n\nIn this way, Astell\u2019s educational plans for the\n\u201cLadies\u201d can help these women develop rationality and\nfreedom such that they can properly discharge their duties to\nthemselves, their fellows, and God. (See Lascano 2016 for a reading\nalong these lines.)\n",
