    "main_text": "Moral Status of Children\n8. Moral Status of Children\n\nIt is uncontroversial to judge that what Mary Anne Warren terms\nparadigmatic humans have moral status (Warren 1992). Paradigmatic\nhumans are adults with relatively standard cognitive capacities for\nself-control, self-criticism, self-direction, and rational thought,\nand are capable of moral thought and action. However, the grounds for\nthis status are controversial, and different grounds for moral status\nhave direct implications for the moral status of children. Jan\nNarveson (1988), for instance, argues that children do not have moral\nstatus in their own right because only free rational beings, capable\nof entering into reciprocal relations with one another, have\nfundamental rights. While Narveson uses the language of rights in his\ndiscussion of moral status (people have direct moral duties only to\nrights holders on his account), moral status need not be discussed in\nthe language of rights. Many other philosophers recognize children as\nhaving moral status because of their potential to become paradigmatic\nhumans without committing to children having rights. For instance,\nAllen Wood writes: \u201cit would show contempt for rational nature\nto be indifferent to its potentiality in children.\u201d (Wood 1998,\n198)\n\nWhen children are judged to have moral status because of their\npotential to develop the capacities of paradigmatic adults (we might\ncall these paradigmatic children), this leaves questions about the\nmoral status of those children who are not expected to live to\nadulthood, and those children whose significant intellectual\ndisabilities compromise their ability to acquire the capacities of\nparadigmatic adults. There are then three common approaches that grant\nmoral status to non-paradigmatic children (and other non-paradigmatic\nhumans). The first approach deems moral consideration to track species\nmembership. On this approach all human children have moral status\nsimply because they are human (Kittay 2005). This approach has been\ncriticized as being inappropriately speciesist, especially by animal\nrights activists. The second approach gives moral status to children\nbecause of their capacity to fare well or badly, either on\nstraightforwardly utilitarian grounds or because they have subjective\nexperiences (Dombrowski 1997). It has been criticized by some for\nfailing to distinguish between capacities all or almost all human\nchildren have that are not also possessed by other creatures who feel\npleasure and pain. The third approach gives moral status to\nnon-paradigmatic children because of the interests others with moral\nstatus take in them (Sapontzis 1987), or the relationships they have\nwith them (Kittay 2005). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2018) offer a\nmore recent version of such an account by arguing that children who\nare human and raised in a person-rearing manner have moral status.\n\nSometimes the approaches may be combined. For instance, Warren writes\nthat young children and other non-paradigmatic humans have moral\nstatus for two sorts of reasons: \u201ctheir rights are based not\nonly on the value which they themselves place upon their lives and\nwell-being, but also on the value which other human beings place on\nthem.\u201d (1992. 197) In addition to these three most common\napproaches, Mullin (2011) develops a fourth: some non-paradigmatic\nchildren (and adults) have moral status not simply because others\nvalue them but because they are themselves capable of being active\nparticipants in morally valuable relationships with others. These\nrelationships express care for others beyond their serving as means\nfor one\u2019s own satisfaction. Approaches to moral status that\nemphasize children\u2019s capacity to care for others in morally\nvaluable relationships also raise interesting questions about\nchildren\u2019s moral responsibilities within those relationships\n(see Mullin 2010).\n\nFor more on this topic see the entry on the\n grounds of moral status.\n",
