    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Duplication and intrinsicness\n4.2 Duplication and intrinsicness\n\nOne theoretically important kind of similarity is\nduplication, or perfect intrinsic qualitative similarity: the\nrelation that would hold between two peas in a pod if it weren\u2019t\nfor all the microscopic differences in the arrangement of their\nmolecules, and perhaps holds in fact between certain pairs of hydrogen\natoms or spacetime points. Lewis\n (1986b)\n proposes essentially the following definition:\n\nDuplication\n\n\\(x\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) if and only if there is a bijective\nfunction \\(f\\) from the parts of \\(x\\) to the parts of \\(y\\), such\nthat for any any perfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\) and any\nsequence \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) of parts of \\(x\\), \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) just in case \\(f(x_1),\\ldots,f(x_n)\\) instantiate\n \\(R\\).[16]\n\n\nThose who deny that there are any perfectly natural properties (e.g.\non the grounds that for every property we can find a more natural one,\nor on the grounds that some magnitudes\n (\u00a73.5)\n are more natural than any properties) will presumably reject the\nright-to-left direction of\n Duplication,\n to avoid the absurd result that any two objects with equally many\nparts are duplicates. This need not, however, put paid to the program\nof defining duplication in terms of naturalness. For example, Langton\nand Lewis\n (1998)\n suggest a quite different definition in terms of \u2018more\nnatural\u2019: for details, see \u00a73.3 in the entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties.[17]\n\n\nOne worry about the left-to-right direction of\n Duplication\n is based on the fact that, under plausible assumptions, it entails\nthat duplicate objects must always have exactly the same perfectly\nnatural\n properties.[18]\n This is in tension with certain unorthodox views about perfect\nnaturalness, e.g. that specific location properties (e.g.\u00a0being\nhere) or vector properties (e.g.\u00a0moving in this\ndirection) are perfectly\n natural.[19]\n Proponents of such views might consider modifying\n Duplication\n to allow certain nontrivial permutations of perfectly natural\nproperties.\n\nDuplication is a useful relation to have a grip on. Lewis uses it in\ndefining several other things, such as determinism (a deterministic\nproposition is one that never divides possible worlds with duplicate\ninitial temporal segments; determinism is the proposition that the\nconjunction of the laws of nature is deterministic) and intrinsicness\n(a property is intrinsic just in case it never divides\nduplicates).\n\nNote that defining intrinsic properties as those that do not divide\nduplicates is hopeless unless it is combined with something like\nLewis\u2019s modal realism. Being a dog-owner is not\nintrinsic; but unless there are vast numbers of people, it is unlikely\nthat any dog-owner is a duplicate of a non-dog-owner. It will not help\nto define the intrinsic properties as those that could not\ndivide duplicates, since being a duplicate of a dog-owner is\nalso not intrinsic. A better idea is to replace the binary relation of\nduplication with a four-place relation between two objects and two\npossible worlds, in which case we can say that property \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic if and only if, whenever \\(x\\) as it is at \\(w\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) as it is at \\(w'\\), \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(w\\) just\nin case \\(y\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(w'\\).\n Duplication\n can be modified to turn it into an analysis of this four-place\nrelation:\n\nCross-world Duplication\n\n\\(x\\) as it is at \\(w\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) as it is at \\(w'\\) if\nand only if there is a one-to-one function \\(f\\) whose domain includes\neverything that is part of \\(x\\) at \\(w\\), and whose range includes\neverything that is part of \\(y\\) at \\(w'\\), such that for any sequence\n\\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) of objects that are parts of \\(x\\) at \\(w'\\) and\nperfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary relation \\(R\\), \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) at \\(w\\) if and only if \\(f(x_1),\\ldots,f(x_n)\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) at\n \\(w'\\).[20]\n\n\nOne objection to this package concerns non-qualitative\nproperties: properties like being identical to Obama and\nhaving Obama as a part are not counted as intrinsic.\nFrancescotti\n (1999),\n Eddon\n (2011),\n and others argue that this is\n wrong.[21]\n Another objection is that the analysis does not allow an intrinsic\nproperty to be necessarily coextensive with an extrinsic one. Those\nwho hold that there are distinct but necessarily extensive qualitative\nproperties may prefer a more discriminating account of intrinsicness\non which, for example, being spherical is intrinsic while\nbeing spherical and either a home-owner or not a home-owner\nis\n not.[22]\n\n",
