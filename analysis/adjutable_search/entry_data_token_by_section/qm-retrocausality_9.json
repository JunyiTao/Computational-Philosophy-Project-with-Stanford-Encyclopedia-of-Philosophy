    "main_text": "Motivation II: Time-Symmetry || Deriving Retrocausality from Time-Symmetry\n4.1 Deriving Retrocausality from Time-Symmetry\n\nThe laws of nature at the most fundamental level at which they are\ncurrently known are combined in the Standard Model of elementary\nparticle physics. These laws are CPT-invariant, i.e., they remain the\nsame under the combined operations of charge-reversal C\n(replacing all particles by their anti-particles), parity P\n(flipping the signs of all spatial coordinates), and time-reversal\nT. The asymmetries in time which are pervasive in our everyday\nlives are a consequence not of any temporal asymmetry in these laws\nbut, instead, of the boundary conditions of the universe, notably in\nits very early stages. It seems natural to assume that the\ntime-symmetry of the laws (modulo the combined operation of C\nand P) extends to causal dependences at the fundamental\n\u201contic\u201d level that underlies the empirical success of\nquantum theory. If so, there may be backward-in-time no less than\nforward-in-time causal influences at that ontic level.\n\nPrice (2012) turns these sketchy considerations into a rigorous\nargument. He shows that, when combined with two assumptions concerning\nquantum ontology, time-symmetry implies retrocausality (understood\nalong broadly interventionist lines). The ontological assumptions are\n(i) that at least some aspects of the quantum state \\(\\psi\\) are real\n(notably, in Price\u2019s example, there is a \u201cbeable\u201d\nencoding photon polarization angle), and (ii) that inputs and outputs\nof quantum experiments are discrete emission and detection\nevents. Moreover, it is important to Price\u2019s argument that\ndynamical time-symmetry (that the dynamical laws of the theory are\ntime-symmetric) be understood as implying that operational\ntime-symmetry (that the set of all possible combinations of\npreparation and measurement procedures in a theory, with associated\nprobabilities for outputs given inputs, is closed under interchange of\npreparation and measurement) translates into ontic time-symmetry\n(operational time-symmetry plus a suitable map between the ontic state\nspaces of the symmetric combinations). Given these conditions, any\nfoundational account that reproduces the empirical verdicts of quantum\ntheory must be retrocausal.\n\nLeifer and Pusey (2017) (see also Leifer 2017 in\n Other Internet Resources)\n strengthen Price\u2019s argument by showing that his assumption\nabout the reality of (aspects of) the quantum state \\(\\psi\\) can be\nrelaxed. As they demonstrate, if measurement outcomes depend only on a\nsystem\u2019s ontic state \\(\\lambda\\), i.e., if that state completely\nmediates any correlations between preparation procedures and\nmeasurement outcomes (\u201c\\(\\lambda\\)-mediation\u201d), this\nsuffices for operational time-symmetry to entail the existence of\nretrocausality. Foundational accounts which like Bohmian mechanics\n(Bohm 1952a,b) or GRW-theory (Ghirardi, Rimini, & Weber 1986)\navoid postulating retrocausality do so by violating time-symmetry in\nsome way. The GRW-theory does so by introducing explicitly\ntime-asymmetric dynamics. In Bohmian mechanics the dynamics is\ntime-symmetric, but the theory is applied in a time-asymmetric manner\nwhen assessing which quantum states are actually realized. Notably,\none assumes that the quantum states of a measured system and a\nmeasurement device connected to it are uncorrelated prior to\nmeasurement, whereas they are in general correlated after measurement\n(Leifer & Pusey 2017: \u00a7X.).\n",
