    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Reductive Color Physicalism\n2.2 Reductive Color Physicalism\n\nAnother common form of Color Objectivism is that colors are objective\n(mind-independent), properties of material bodies and light sources,\nwhose natures are \u201chidden\u201d from us, and require empirical\ninvestigation to discover. This theory is commonly known as\nPhysicalist Color Realism  but I shall use the title\nReductive Color Physicalism. (The properties that constitute\nthe colors, for Color Primitivism, are \u201cphysical\u201d in one\ngood sense of the term.)\n\nPerhaps the earliest defender of this second form of Color Objectivism\nwas Thomas Reid, the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher. More\nrecent examples are Armstrong 1969; Hilbert 1987; Matthen 1988;\nJackson 1996, 1998, 2007; Tye 2000; Byrne & Hilbert 2003; and\nMcLaughlin 2003. Reid thought that the folk did not think as\nphilosophers such as Hume and Descartes and others said that they did.\nReid wrote that:\n\n\nBy colour, all men who have not been tutored by modern philosophy\nunderstand, not a sensation of the mind, which can have no existence\nwhen it is not perceived, but a quality or modification of bodies,\nwhich continues to be the same whether it is seen or not. (Reid 1764:\nch. 6, sect. 4 [1970: 99])\n\n\nIt would seem that, so far, Reid is simply displaying the common sense\nfor which he is famous. More controversially, however, he goes on to\nsay that when we perceive the color of body, \n\n\nThat idea, which we have called the appearance of colour, suggests the\nconception and belief of some unknown quality in the body\nwhich occasions the idea, and it is to this quality and not\nthe idea, that we give the name of colour. (Reid 1764:\nch. 6, sect. 4 [1970: 100]) \n\n\nOn the face of it, this view of Reid seems counter-intuitive. Many of\n\u201cthose men not tutored by modern philosophy\u201d, have a lot to say\nabout colors, and would be surprised to be told that colors are\nunknown qualities. Red, for example, is the color used by many\nrevolutionary parties, good for annoying bulls, my favorite color, the\ncolor of my true love\u2019s lips, and so on. We can give paradigms\nof blue, red, yellow, turquoise, mauve, etc. We often say things such\nas \u201cthat is a better blue than this\u201d. One suspects that\nthey (the untutored) would be puzzled by the remark that red is some\nunknown quality (for more on this, see Hacker 1987: 186).\n\nReid\u2019s view may be extreme but it helps us appreciate the\nsignificance of the view of a contemporary color physicalist,\nMcLaughlin, who singles Reid out as anticipating his account of color.\nMcLaughlin explicitly endorses this view of Reid though, in fact, his\nposition is subtly different. He defends a functionalist analysis of\ncolor, according to which a color, say redness, is the occupant of a\ncertain functional role:\n\n\nRedness is that property which disposes its bearers to look red, to\nstandard visual perceivers in standard conditions of visual\nobservation, and which must (as a matter of nomological necessity) be\nheld by everything so disposed. (McLaughlin 2003: 479) \n\n\nMcLaughlin adds that this proposal is intended as providing a\nconceptual analysis:\n\n\nThe proposal is intended as a functional or topic neutral analysis of\nthe concept of redness. The role description \u201cthat property\nwhich \u2026\u201d is intended not only to fix the referent of the\nconcept, but also to express a condition that is necessary and\nsufficient for satisfying it. Thus, if the proposal is correct, then\nall it takes for a property to be redness is for it to fill the\nredness role. (McLaughlin 2003: 479)\n\n\nMcLaughlin\u2019s proposal is different, in a crucial respect, from\nReid\u2019s. It does not explicitly state that the property, which is\nthe occupant of the functional role, is a property\n\u201cunknown\u201d to the observer. His proposal is designed to be\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d. This means that colors could either be\nsome complex physical properties, that could only be discovered by\nscientific investigation, or they could be the sort of properties\ndescribed by Primitivists: sui generis, simple, intrinsic,\nqualitative, non-relational, non-reducible properties of physical\nbodies. McLaughlin argues that scientific investigation makes it\nhighly plausible that the occupant of the role is some complex\nphysical property\u2014that is, that Color Physicalism is\ntrue\u2014and that no good reason favors the Primitivist option.\n\nMcLaughlin\u2019s topic-neutral proposal is a proposal about our\nordinary understanding of color. Most Primitivists would accept this\ncondition as capturing, at best, only one element of that\nunderstanding. (Some would say that the proposal expresses a truth\nthat we can recognize, but it is not part of the ordinary\nunderstanding.) Other elements, they would contend, rule out the\ncomplex physical properties that McLaughlin indicates. A plausible\ncandidate for one of these elements is the doctrine of Revelation,\nitem (5) of the list that, as we saw, Johnston provides, in his\n\u201ccluster\u201d of core color beliefs.\n\nRevelation. The intrinsic nature of canary yellow is\nfully revealed by a standard visual experience as of a canary yellow\nthing.\n\n\nThis would explain the Primitivist account of the character of the\ncolors, as being revealed in our perceptual experience. McLaughlin\naddresses the status of Revelation in his argument. He thinks that\nthis doctrine, once we reflect on it, has little to recommend it. What\nappeal it has depends on the fact that it is easily confused with\nanother principle, which has some intuitive appeal (though it too is\nfalse). He does not have an explicit argument against the doctrine,\nalthough he draws a consequence that he thinks we would all find\nunwelcome:\n\n\nAll we have learned, and indeed, all we can ever hope to learn by\nscientific investigation will contribute not one whit to our knowledge\nof the nature of colors themselves. For Revelation entails that there\nis nothing more that we can learn about the nature of colors than what\nvisual experience teaches us. (McLaughlin 2003: 477.) \n\n\nHe thinks that there is a basic mistake behind the commitment to the\ndoctrine of Revelation: the failure to distinguish colors from what it\nis like to see them. Revelation, he concedes, is more plausible with\nrespect to the phenomenal character of color experiences\u2014the\nwhat-it-is-like aspect\u2014though, here, too, it is false.\n\nOne of the virtues of this form of Color Physicalism is that it offers\na plausible explanation for the phenomenon of color constancy, the\nfact that there is strong tendency for the same object to look to have\nthe same color in a wide variety of illuminations. Against this claim,\nhowever, it has been argued that other theories have the resources to\nexplain the phenomenon (to the extent that it occurs, for which there\nare certain limits\u2014see Hardin 1988, Cohen 2009, Chirimuuta\n2008.)\n\nAn initial problem is \u201cthe problem of multiple\nrealizations\u201d: there is a wide range of different types of\nbodies that have colors\u2014light sources, illuminants, surfaces\n(e.g., of apples, cars, cloths, paintings, \u2026), volumes (e.g.,\nwine, glass, atmospheres, \u2026), bodies that scatter light, bodies\nthat diffract light, films, and luminescent bodies. The causes of the\ncolors objects appear to have, are many and varied. For most\ntheorists, however, the most plausible physicalist candidates for the\ncolors are light-related properties, e.g., capacities to emit,\nreflect, absorb, transmit or scatter light to varying degrees. For\nphysical surfaces, the color is taken to be related to the\nobject\u2019s reflectance profile, i.e., the capacity to\ndifferentially reflect wavelengths from different regions of the\nincident illumination. It turns out, however, that, for each surface\ncolor, there is no single reflectance curve associated with that\ncolor, but many. The situation is similar, in the case of film colors\nor aperture colors. That is to say, for each color, there is a set of\nmetamers. (Two stimuli\u2014bodies, sources of light, etc.\u2014that\ndiffer in their physical characteristics, but are matched in\nappearance under a certain illumination, by the same observer, are\nmetamers for that observer, in that illumination. Two bodies that are\nmetamers in one illumination need not be metamers under a different\nillumination, or for a different observer.) \n\nThe favored response to this problem is to say, for example, that a\ngiven color, red, say, is not a specific color reflectance, but a type\nof reflectance, i.e., one that is a member of a certain group.\nHowever, there are still problems. Averill (1992, 2005), for example,\npresents some interesting arguments, which are based on plausible\nconjectures about how normal observers and standard conditions might\neasily enough change, with consequent metameric change. The color\nphysicalist seems to be committed to a very arbitrary grouping of\nreflectances into the various types.\n\nThis problem is related to one that Hardin (1988, 2004) and Cohen\n(2009) have drawn attention to. It has to do with the problem of\nidentifying, in a non-arbitrary way, normal conditions, and\nstandard observers. The objectivist account requires that we\nidentify the \u201creal\u201d color for object X as a certain\ncausal basis (e.g., the reflectance profile) for the way it appears,\nto normal observers and in standard conditions. The problem is that,\nas Hardin has persuasively pointed out, particularly, in Hardin 2004,\nthis cannot be done except in a highly arbitrary way. Not only is\nthere a minority of color perceivers who are anomalous (only slightly,\nbut appreciably so) with respect to normal observers, but there is a\nconsiderable statistical spread even within the group of normal\nobservers. For example, the reflectance profile for unique green will\ndiffer for different members of the \u201cnormal group\u201d. One\ncan decide, of course, on a standard and fix one reflectance profile\nas green, but the procedure is highly arbitrary. As we have seen,\nthere are few interesting causal powers associated with colors apart\nfrom the way objects affect perceivers. (This argument has led to a\nvigorous debate in the pages of Analysis, see Byrne &\nHilbert 2007b; Cohen, Hardin & McLaughlin 2006a,b; and Tye 2006a,b, 2007.)\n\nTo counter this problem, McLaughlin suggests that we extend a\nproposal, which Jackson and Pargetter (1987) made, originally to\novercome the problem of multiple realizations. They proposed\nrelativising the concept of color, to kinds of objects and\ncircumstances. McLaughlin\u2019s suggestion is that we could extend\nthe objectivist concept of color, by relativising it to individual\nobservers. \n\nAnother major objection to the physicalist (reductive) account\nconcerns whether the properties can satisfy the principle of\n\u201cUnity\u201d, as described by Johnston,\n (see section 2.2).\n This principle points to the fact that the various colors, it would\nseem, are the kinds of properties that fit together in characteristic\nways to form structured color arrays, with a distinctive 3-dimensional\ncharacter, built on attributes such as hue/saturation/brightness (or\nhue, chroma, lightness). The principle of Unity would seem to pose a\nserious problem for the Color Physicalist (see Hardin 1988; Thompson\n1995; Maund 1995, 2011). As McLaughlin concedes, the problem is \n\n\nthat no physical properties that are even remotely plausible\ncandidates for being the properties essentially participate in these\npatterns of relationships. (McLaughlin 2003: 487)\n\n\nHis solution to the problem is that the comparative claims, e.g.,\nabout red, orange and blue\u2014orange is more similar to red than to\nblue\u2014are true in virtue of a comparative fact about the visual\nexperiences in question. \n\n\nColors themselves participate in the similarity and difference\nrelationships derivatively\u2014in virtue of the participation of the\nvisual experiences that they dispose their bearers to produce.\n(McLaughlin 2003: 487) \n\n\nThe claim, here, is that what it is like to for something to look red\nis more similar to what it is like for something to look\norange than it is to what it is like for something to look\nblue. This solution, however, raises the question of what features of\nthe experience are relevant ones, i.e., are the features which stand\nin the relations of similarity and difference. There seem to be two\npossibilities: (i) they are features of the experiences themselves;\n(ii) they are features presented in experience or represented in them,\ni.e., they are features of regions of visual fields, or of sensa, or\nof material objects. There are some prima facie problems which ensue.\nAssuming the former possibility, then our color experiences involve\nmassive error. The judgments of similarity and difference are applied\nto the colors and not to our experiences. If the second possibility is\nadopted, i.e., it is held that there are certain features, presented\nin, or represented in, experience, then they stand in the relations of\nsimilarities and differences. These features are different from\nreflectances, so the color physicalist needs to say what they are.\n\nTye and Byrne and Hilbert have proposed a solution to this last\nproblem, one that depends on exploiting the opponent-processing model\nof color vision (see Supplement Color Science: Some Complexities.). It\nis to specify the relevant groups of spectral reflectances, associated\nwith each color, in terms of their capacity to produce suitable\nresponses of the visual system. The argument, by Byrne and Hilbert,\nproceeds in two steps: (1) it is argued that color experience are\ncharacterized as having a certain representational content: they\nrepresent objects as having what Byrne and Hilbert call\n\u201chue\u201d magnitudes; (2) the hue-magnitudes are explained in\nterms of being certain physical properties. As they argue, if we can\ngive the right account of how the magnitudes contribute to the\nrepresentational content, then we can explain the similarity relations\namong the hues and the binary/unique distinction, in terms of the\ncontent of color experience.\n\nThis proposal, in turn, has been subject to criticism from several\nauthors, e.g., Hardin 2003, Pautz 2006, Maund 2011, and Allen\n2015.\n",
