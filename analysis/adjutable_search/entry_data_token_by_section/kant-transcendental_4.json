    "main_text": "The Transcendental Deduction || Logical Forms of Judgment and the Categories\n1.4 Logical Forms of Judgment and the Categories\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a719\u201320, Kant contends that the vehicle that brings\nabout the synthesis at issue is judgment, and that this vehicle\nemploys certain forms of judgment, which are in turn intimately\nrelated to the twelve categories. By connecting synthesis to judgment\nin this way, and the forms of judgment to the categories, Kant aims to\nshow that we must employ the categories in the synthesis of our\nexperience of objects.\n\nIn \u00a719, Kant argues that there must be a certain way in which\neach of my representations is unified in the subject, and he\nidentifies this way with judgment: \u201cI find that a judgment is\nnothing but the manner in which given cognitions are brought to the\nobjective unity of apperception\u201d (B141). Judgment, Kant\nproposes, is objectively rather than subjectively valid, and hence\nexhibits the type of universality and necessity that characterizes\nobjective validity (B142). He then claims that without synthesis and\njudgment as its vehicle, an ordering of representations might reflect\nwhat appears to be the case, but it would not explain how we make\ndistinctions between objective valid phenomena (i.e., objects) and the\nsubjective states they induce (e.g, Allison 2015: 363\u201369; Sethi\n2020).\n\nIn \u00a720, Kant ties this notion of judgment to the twelve forms of\njudgment presented in the Metaphysical Deduction (A70/B95), and he\nthen connects these forms of judgment to the twelve categories\n(A76\u201383/B102\u20139). The claim has often been made that the\nlinks Kant specifies between synthesis and judgment, judgment and the\nforms of judgment, the forms of judgment and the categories are not\nsufficiently supported. Guyer, for example, argues that Kant has not\nadequately established the last of these connections, that although\nKant claims that the categories are simply the forms of judgment as\nthey are employed in the synthesis of representations in an intuition\n(A79/B104\u2013A80/B105, B143), he has failed to make this claim\nplausible (Guyer 1987: 94\u2013102). It is fair to say that these\nconcerns have merit. Kant\u2019s assertions about these ties remain\nmore obscure than the preceding part of the Transcendental Deduction,\nand it continues to be a serious challenge for interpreters to clarify\nand vindicate them.\n\nB\u00e9atrice Longuenesse (1998), in her interpretation of the\nMetaphysical Deduction, takes up this challenge. In her view, the\nfaculty at issue in the production and use of concepts, the\nunderstanding, is the power to judge (Verm\u00f6gen zu\nUrteilen), which is ultimately a disposition or a\nconatus to make judgments and to shape how we are affected so\nthat we can make them (Longuenesse 1998: 208, 394). The logical forms\nof judgment are in essence the forms of combination of concepts in\njudgments. One such form is the categorical, which is the form of\nsubject-predicate judgments; another is the hypothetical, the form of\nconditional judgments. Kant contends that the logical form of a\njudgment is what makes it capable of truth or falsity, for by means of\nsuch a form a judgment can constitute a relation of a subject\u2019s\nrepresentations to an objective feature of reality (Longuenesse 2000,\n93\u20134). For instance, by its categorical form, the judgment\n\u2018the boat is moving\u2019 can constitute the relation of my\nrepresentations of a boat and of motion to an objectively existing\nboat in motion, and as a result this judgment can be true or\nfalse.\n\nOne role of the logical forms of judgment is in the process of\nanalysis, by which the objects we intuit are subsumed under concepts.\nWhat results from this process is a judgment that expresses what Kant\ncalls an analytic unity \u2013 paradigmatically, the unity\nin the subsumption of several intuited objects under a single concept.\nBut a logical form of judgment can also function in a different role:\nin the synthesis of a manifold of an intuition. The result in this\ncase is a synthetic unity, the unity of a synthesized\nmultiplicity of representations in a single intuition. The\nunderstanding, as the power to judge, functions in each of these two\nroles; \u201cthe same function that gives unity to concepts in\njudgment, also gives unity to the mere synthesis of representations in\nintuition\u201d (A79/B104\u20135). In its synthetic role, the\nunderstanding adds content to the forms of judgment:\n\nThe same understanding, and indeed by means of the very same actions\nthrough which it brings the logical form of judgment into concepts by\nmeans of the analytical unity, also brings a transcendental content\ninto its representations by means of the synthetic unity of the\nmanifold in intuition in general. (A79/B105)\n\n\nThe addition of such transcendental content turns the form of judgment\ninto a category. This content is a feature of the forms of intuition,\nspace and time, which are called upon when the power to judge sets out\nto unify a manifold of intuition (B128\u20139). The categories\n\u2013 more precisely, the versions of the categories that are\nschematized for our way of cognizing (A137/B176ff) \u2013 are thus\ngenerated from the forms of judgment in the process of synthesizing\nintuitions by the addition of spatial and temporal content. For\nexample, generated from the categorical form of judgment by the\naddition of such content is the category of substance, and generated\nfrom the hypothetical form of judgment in this way is the category of\ncause. (For beings possessing the power of understanding but with\ndifferent forms of intuition, the categories would be schematized\ndifferently from ours.)\n",
