    "main_text": "The measurement problem || Comparison of approaches to the measurement problem\n4.5 Comparison of approaches to the measurement problem\n\nMost of the above approaches take it that the goal is to provide an\naccount of events in the world that recovers, at least in some\napproximation, something like our familiar world of ordinary objects\nbehaving classically. None of the mainstream approaches accord any\nspecial physical role to conscious observers. There have,\nhowever, been proposals in that direction (see the entry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness\n for discussion).\n\nAll of the above-mentioned approaches are consistent with observation.\nMere consistency, however, is not enough; the rules for connecting\nquantum theory with experimental results typically involve nontrivial\n(that is, not equal to zero or one) probabilities assigned to\nexperimental outcomes. These calculated probabilities are confronted\nwith empirical evidence in the form of statistical data from repeated\nexperiments. Extant hidden-variables theories reproduce the quantum\nprobabilities, and collapse theories have the intriguing feature of\nreproducing very close approximations to quantum probabilities for all\nexperiments that have been performed so far but departing from the\nquantum probabilities for other conceivable experiments. This permits,\nin principle, an empirical discrimination between such theories and\nno-collapse theories.\n\nA criticism that has been raised against Everettian theories is that\nit is not clear whether they can even make sense of statistical\ntesting of this kind, as it does not, in any straightforward way, make\nsense to talk of the probability of obtaining, say, a \u2018+\u201d\noutcome of a given experiment when it is certain that all possible\noutcomes will occur on some branch of the wavefunction. This has been\ncalled the \u201cEverettian evidential problem\u201d. It has been\nthe subject of much recent work on Everettian theories; see Saunders\n(2007) for an introduction and overview.\n\nIf one accepts that Everettians have a solution to the evidential\nproblem, then, among the major lines of approach, none is favored in a\nstraightforward way by the empirical evidence. There will not be space\nhere to give an in-depth overview of these ongoing discussions, but a\nfew considerations can be mentioned, to give the reader a flavor of\nthe discussions; see entries on particular approaches for more\ndetail.\n\nEverettians take, as a virtue of the approach, the fact that it does\nnot involve an extension or modification of the quantum formalism.\nBohmians claim, in favor of the Bohmian approach, that a theory on\nthese lines provides the most straightforward picture of events;\nontological issues are less clear-cut when it comes to Everettian\ntheories or collapse theories.\n\nAnother consideration is compatibility with relativistic causal\nstructure. See Myrvold (2021) for an overview of relavistic\nconstraints on approaches to the measurement problem.The de\nBroglie-Bohm theory requires a distinguished relation of distant\nsimultaneity for its formulation, and, it can be argued, this is an\nineliminable feature of any hidden-variables theory of this sort, that\nselects some observable to always have definite values (see Berndl\net al. 1996; Myrvold 2002, 2021). On the other hand, there\nare collapse models that are fully relativistic. On such models,\ncollapses are localized events. Though probabilities of collapses at\nspacelike separation from each other are not independent, this\nprobabilistic dependence does not require us to single one out as\nearlier and the other later. Thus, such theories do not require a\ndistinguished relation of distant simultaneity. There remains,\nhowever, some discussion of how to equip such theories with beables\n(or \u201celements of reality\u201d). See the entry on\n collapse theories\n and references therein; see also, for some recent contributions to\nthe discussion, Fleming (2016), Maudlin (2016), and Myrvold\n(2016).  In the case of Everettian theories, one must first think\nabout how to formulate the question of relativistic locality. Several\nauthors have approached this issue in somewhat different ways, with a\ncommon conclusion that Everettian quantum mechanics is, indeed, local.\n(See Vaidman 1994; Bacciagaluppi 2002; Chapter 8 of Wallace 2012; Tipler\n2014; Vaidman 2016; and Brown and Timpson 2016.)\n",
