    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Motion || The Dichotomy\n3.1 The Dichotomy\n\nThe first asserts the non-existence of motion on the ground that that\nwhich is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it\narrives at the goal. (Aristotle Physics, 239b11)\n\n\nThis paradox is known as the \u2018dichotomy\u2019 because it\ninvolves repeated division into two (like the second paradox of\nplurality). Like the other paradoxes of motion we have it from\nAristotle, who sought to refute it.\n\nSuppose a very fast runner\u2014such as mythical Atalanta\u2014needs\nto run for the bus. Clearly before she reaches the bus stop she must\nrun half-way, as Aristotle says. There\u2019s no problem there;\nsupposing a constant motion it will take her 1/2 the time to run\nhalf-way there and 1/2 the time to run the rest of the way. Now she\nmust also run half-way to the half-way point\u2014i.e., a 1/4 of the\ntotal distance\u2014before she reaches the half-way point, but again\nshe is left with a finite number of finite lengths to run, and plenty\nof time to do it. And before she reaches 1/4 of the way she must reach\n\\(1/2\\) of \\(1/4 = 1/8\\) of the way; and before that a 1/16; and so on. There\nis no problem at any finite point in this series, but what if the\nhalving is carried out infinitely many times? The resulting series\ncontains no first distance to run, for any possible first distance\ncould be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all.\nHowever it does contain a final distance, namely 1/2 of the way; and a\npenultimate distance, 1/4 of the way; and a third to last distance,\n1/8 of the way; and so on. Thus the series of distances that Atalanta\nis required to run is: \u2026, then 1/16 of the way, then 1/8 of the\nway, then 1/4 of the way, and finally 1/2 of the way (for now we are\nnot suggesting that she stops at the end of each segment and\nthen starts running at the beginning of the next\u2014we are thinking\nof her continuous run being composed of such parts). And now there is\na problem, for this description of her run has her travelling an\ninfinite number of finite distances, which, Zeno\nwould have us conclude, must take an infinite time, which is to say it\nis never completed. And since the argument does not depend on the\ndistance or who or what the mover is, it follows that no finite\ndistance can ever be traveled, which is to say that all motion is\nimpossible. (Note that the paradox could easily be generated in the\nother direction so that Atalanta must first run half way, then half\nthe remaining way, then half of that and so on, so that she must run\nthe following endless sequence of fractions of the total distance:\n1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8, then \u2026.)\n\nA couple of common responses are not adequate. One might\u2014as\nSimplicius ((a) On Aristotle\u2019s Physics, 1012.22) tells\nus Diogenes the Cynic did by silently standing and walking\u2014point\nout that it is a matter of the most common experience that things in\nfact do move, and that we know very well that Atalanta would have no\ntrouble reaching her bus stop. But this would not impress Zeno, who,\nas a paid up Parmenidean, held that many things are not as they\nappear: it may appear that Diogenes is walking or that Atalanta is\nrunning, but appearances can be deceptive and surely we have a logical\nproof that they are in fact not moving at all. Alternatively if one\ndoesn\u2019t accept that Zeno has given a proof that motion is\nillusory\u2014as we hopefully do not\u2014one then owes an account\nof what is wrong with his argument: he has given reasons why motion is\nimpossible, and so an adequate response must show why those reasons\nare not sufficient. And it won\u2019t do simply to point out that\nthere are some ways of cutting up Atalanta\u2019s run\u2014into just\ntwo halves, say\u2014in which there is no problem. For if you accept\nall of the steps in Zeno\u2019s argument then you must accept his\nconclusion (assuming that he has reasoned in a logically deductive\nway): it\u2019s not enough to show an unproblematic division, you\nmust also show why the given division is unproblematic.\n\nAnother response\u2014given by Aristotle himself\u2014is to point\nout that as we divide the distances run, we should also divide the\ntotal time taken: there is 1/2 the time for the final 1/2, a 1/4 of\nthe time for the previous 1/4, an 1/8 of the time for the 1/8 of the\nrun and so on. Thus each fractional distance has just the right\nfraction of the finite total time for Atalanta to complete it, and\nthus the distance can be completed in a finite time. Aristotle felt\nthat this reply should satisfy Zeno, however he also realized\n(Physics, 263a15) that it could not be the end of the matter.\nFor now we are saying that the time Atalanta takes to reach\nthe bus stop is composed of an infinite number of finite\npieces\u2014\u2026, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 of the total time\u2014and\nisn\u2019t that an infinite time?\n\nOf course, one could again claim that some infinite sums have finite\ntotals, and in particular that the sum of these pieces is \\(1 \\times\\)\nthe total time, which is of course finite (and again a complete\nsolution would demand a rigorous account of infinite summation, like\nCauchy\u2019s). However, Aristotle did not make such a move. Instead\nhe drew a sharp distinction between what he termed a\n\u2018continuous\u2019 line and a line divided into parts. Consider\na simple division of a line into two: on the one hand there is the\nundivided line, and on the other the line with a mid-point selected as\nthe boundary of the two halves. Aristotle claims that these are two\ndistinct things: and that the latter is only \u2018potentially\u2019\nderivable from the former. Next, Aristotle takes the common-sense view\nthat time is like a geometric line, and considers the time it takes to\ncomplete the run. We can again distinguish the two cases: there is the\ncontinuous interval from start to finish, and there is the interval\ndivided into Zeno\u2019s infinity of half-runs. The former is\n\u2018potentially infinite\u2019 in the sense that it could be\ndivided into the latter \u2018actual infinity\u2019. Here\u2019s\nthe crucial step: Aristotle thinks that since these intervals are\ngeometrically distinct they must be physically\ndistinct. But how could that be? He claims that the runner must do\nsomething at the end of each half-run to make it distinct from the\nnext: she must stop, making the run itself discontinuous. (It\u2019s\nnot clear why some other action wouldn\u2019t suffice to divide the\ninterval.) Then Aristotle\u2019s full answer to the paradox is that\nthe question of whether the infinite series of runs is possible or not\nis ambiguous: the potentially infinite series of halves in a\ncontinuous run is possible, while an actual infinity of discontinuous\nhalf runs is not\u2014Zeno does identify an impossibility, but it\ndoes not describe the usual way of running down tracks!\n\nIt is hard\u2014from our modern perspective perhaps\u2014to see how\nthis answer could be completely satisfactory. In the first place it\nassumes that a clear distinction can be drawn between potential and\nactual infinities, something that was never fully achieved. Second,\nsuppose that Zeno\u2019s problem turns on the claim that infinite\nsums of finite quantities are invariably infinite. Then\nAristotle\u2019s distinction will only help if he can explain why\npotentially infinite sums are in fact finite (couldn\u2019t we\npotentially add \\(1 + 1 + 1 +\\ldots\\), which does not have a finite\ntotal); or if he can give a reason why potentially infinite sums just\ndon\u2019t exist. Or perhaps Aristotle did not see infinite sums as\nthe problem, but rather whether completing an infinity of finite\nactions is metaphysically and conceptually and physically possible. We\nwill briefly discuss this issue\u2014of\n\u2018Supertasks\u2019\u2014below, but note that there is a\nwell-defined run in which the stages of Atalanta\u2019s run are\npunctuated by finite rests, arguably showing the possibility of\ncompleting an infinite series of finite tasks in a finite time\n(Huggett 2010, 21\u20132). Finally, the distinction between potential and\nactual infinities has played no role in mathematics since Cantor tamed\nthe transfinite numbers\u2014certainly the potential infinite has\nplayed no role in the modern mathematical solutions discussed\nhere.\n",
