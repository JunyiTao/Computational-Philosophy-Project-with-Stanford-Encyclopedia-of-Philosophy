Brentano and His Precursors on Existential Judgement\n\nWe have seen that Brentano heavily relies on the special case of\nexistential judgements in developing a general account of judgement\nand criticizes other views because they do not work for those cases.\nWhile Brentano\u2019s approach is original, he also draws on a range\nof sources. He finds in Aristotle, Aquinas and Kant anticipations of\nthe idea that existential judgements involve no predication (=\n claim 4).\n However, none of the named philosophers goes as far as Brentano and\ntakes all judgements to be existential. Hence, Brentano can indeed\nclaim that his own theory fills a gap in the history of ideas.\nLet\u2019s consider what Brentano took from his predecessors in\nhistorical order.\n\nIn Psychology (PES 212 fn, [II 54 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 246])\nBrentano says in a long footnote that Aristotle hinted at the right\nconception of existential judgement in Metaphysics and in\nDe Interpretatione. In Metaphysics Book IX (\u03b8)\n10 Aristotle is faced with a problem. He has told his readers that one\njudges truly if one separates in thought what is separated in reality\nand combines in thought what is combined in reality. For example, if\nPlato and foolishness are separated\u2014the former does not have the\nlatter\u2014one judges truly if one separates Plato and foolishness\nin thought, that is, judges that Plato is not foolish. But now\nAristotle goes on to tell us that there are incomposites that\nare not combined with anything. How can one make true or false\njudgements pertaining to such\n things?[10]\n\nAristotle introduces in response a further, different notion of truth\nand judgement. Judgements pertaining to incomposites are\n\u201ctouchings\u201d of or put us into \u201ccontact\u201d with\nthese things, a notion that Brentano renders as\n\u201cperception\u201d:\n\n\nIn fact, as truth is not the same in these cases, so also being is not\nthe same; but truth or falsity is as follows\u2014contact and\nassertion are truth (assertion not being affirmation), and ignorance\nis non-contact. (Metaphysics,\n 1051b21\u201325)[11]\n\n\nIn Brentano\u2019s eyes, Aristotle\u2019s \u201credefinition\u201d\nof judgement and truth is highly suggestive. It shows that the\nstrategy to explain judgement and truth in terms of combining and\nseparating runs into a problem. Aristotle\u2019s appeal to the idea\nof touching an object suggests a non-propositional form of\njudgement\u2014good from Brentano\u2019s perspective\u2014while the\npostulation of two different kinds of judgement, propositional as well\nas non-propositional, results in a non-uniform account of\njudgement\u2014bad from Brentano\u2019s perspective. We want a\nuniform account of judgement. But such an account may not be\navailable, as Brentano later came to see. In his theory of double\njudgement he accepts, like Aristotle did, the pattern of recognition\nof non-predicative judgement combined with postulating other kinds of\njudgement (see\n section 5).\n\nBrentano refers also with approval to the third chapter of De\nInterpretatione. There Aristotle says about the copula \u201cto\nbe\u201d or \u201cto be not\u201d that \u201cby itself it is\nnothing, but it additionally signifies some combination, which cannot\nbe thought of without the components.\u201d Brentano renders this\nas\n\n\nthe \u201cbeing\u201d of the copula does not in itself signify\nanything, as a name does, but simply completes the expression of a\njudgement.\n\n\nAs a correct reading of Aristotle this is dubious. Aristotle has the\ncopula signifying some combination. It is not merely\n\u201ccompleting\u201d the expression of a judgement, that is,\n\u201cto be\u201d is not only a syncategorematic expression. But we\ncan use Brentano\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle to shed further\nlight on his own positive view. He wants to say that the meaning of\n\u201cis\u201d is the same in the following sentences:\n\n(a)\nGod is almighty.\n(b)\nGod is.\n\n\nIn both sentences \u201cis\u201d has meaning or reference of its\nown. Hence, one cannot understand the judgement expressed by (b) as a\npredication of a property: \u201cis\u201d does not name the property\nof being.\n\nWhat does \u201cis\u201d then do in \u201cGod is\u201d? In his\nanswer of this question Brentano took inspiration from St. Thomas and\nKant:\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, St. Thomas came as close as Kant to the truth,\nremarkably enough by reflecting upon the same proposition, \u201cGod\nexists\u201d. According to him, the \u201cis\u201d is not a real\npredicate but merely a sign of affirmation (Summa Theologica,\nP. I, Q. 3, A. 4 ad 2). (PES 211 fn, [II 53 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn\n244])\n\n\nWhat is telling here is Brentano\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cmerely\u201d. It implies that one can use a sign for\naffirmation without using that very same sign also as a sign for\npredication. Following Brentano\u2019s own suggestion, we can make\nthis clear by introducing a simple formalism. Let us use the sign\n\u201c+\u201d as a sign for a mere affirmation (like a question mark\nis a mere sign for asking a question), and let us use\n\u201c+is\u201d as a sign that expresses both a judgement and a\npredication. Then we can symbolize the two judgements above as\nfollows:\n\n(a)\nGod (+is) almighty\n(b)\nGod\n (+)[12]\n\n\nThat is the inspiration that Brentano gets from St. Thomas. But,\nagain, there is something in St. Thomas that Brentano finds\n objectionable.[13]\n As Brentano notes, Aquinas wants to uphold Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof truth which requires that every judgement is a comparison between a\nrepresentation and its object. He does not admit that existential\njudgements simply do not fit this description.\n\nIt is important to note that \u201c+\u201d is a sign of affirmation\nand not a predicate. For example, Sundholm (2009: 274) argues that\nBrentano simply \u201crediscovered\u201d an idea of Bolzano.\nAccording to Sundholm, Bolzano takes \u201cA exists\u201d to express\nthe propositions that the idea [A] has an object; \u201cA does not\nexist\u201d expresses the negation of this property. The appearance\nthat Brentano recycles this view is dispelled when we notice that\n\u201c+\u201d does not express a presentation, but only determines\nin which mode a content is to be thought.\n\nLet us now turn to Kant. Brentano disagrees with Kant\u2019s\nepistemology on almost every single point. With respect to the nature\nof judgement, Brentano points out that Kant overlooks their essential\ncharacter by putting them together with presentations into a single\ncategory: acts of thinking. He also takes Kant to task for holding on\nto the mistaken view that a judgement always unifies several\nrepresentations (Critique of Pure Reason, A\n68\u20139/B93\u20134). Thus it may come as a surprise that there is\nalso a strong agreement between their views. Kant anticipates\nBrentano\u2019s claim that a \u201csingle mark [einzelnes Merkmal]\nwhich is the object of a presentation can be acknowledged or denied,\ntoo\u201d (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 230]; translation changed). The\ninsight can be found in Kant\u2019s seminal discussion of\nexistence:\n\n\nBeing is obviously not a real predicate, i.e., a concept of something\nthat could add to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing of\na thing or of certain determinations in themselves. (Critique of\nPure Reason, A 598)\n\n\nKant\u2019s slogan \u201cbeing is not a real predicate\u201d has\nbeen interpreted as saying that \u201cexists\u201d is no first-order\npredicate of objects, but a second-order predicate true of concepts.\nWhether this is the correct interpretation is not important for our\npurposes. Primed by Aquinas\u2019s remarks on \u201cto be\u201d,\nBrentano reads Kant\u2019s remark\n differently.[14]\n When I judge that God exists, I posit an omniscient being, but I do\nnot add something to the concept of an omniscient being. Instead of\nsaying \u201cexists\u201d is not a real predicate, Kant should have\nsaid that it is not a predicate at all, but a force-indicator: it has\npositing force.\n\nFrom Brentano\u2019s point of view, Kant commits the same mistake as\nSt. Thomas. He too tries to make existential judgements agree with the\ntraditional view that every judgement is a combination of\nrepresentations. To fit into Kant\u2019s category of synthetic\njudgement, the existential judgement that God exists must add\nsomething to the concept of God. \u201cThis is,\u201d remarks\nBrentano, \u201can unclear and contradictory semi-truth\u201d (PES\n211 [II 54; SVS 1, 234]; translation improved).\n\nKant may be forgiven his oversight, if one realizes how many logicians\nfollowed his path and found it equally incomprehensible to reach the\nposition that Brentano advocates. A telling example of such\nincomprehension is provided by John Stuart Mill in his letter to\nBrentano:\n\n\n1. I agree with you that Belief is the essential constituent in a\nDifferentia of judgment, and that the putting together of two ideas is\nmerely a prerequisite or antecedent condition.\n\n2. I cannot, however, think that one idea is a sufficient prerequisite\nfor a judgment. I cannot see how there can be Belief without both a\nsubject and a predicate. If you say that the idea of an elephant\nsuffices for belief in an elephant, belief in an elephant can only\nmean belief that there is such a thing as an elephant\u2014that an\nelephant exists: or, in other words, that under some circumstances,\nand in some place known or unknown, I should perceive by my senses a\nthing answering the definition of an elephant. Now this, which is the\ntruth really believed, is a fact, in two terms, not in one\n only.[15]\n (Mill 1872 [1972: 1928\u20139])\n\n\nThe one philosopher that came closest to Brentano\u2019s view on\njudgement was Johann Friedrich\n Herbart.[16]\n Herbart does not try to assimilate existential and so-called\n\u201csubjectless\u201d statements (\u201cIt rains\u201d) to\ncategorical one\u2019s of the form \u201cS is\n P\u201d.[17]\n And he takes \u201cis\u201d in \u201cGod is\u201d to be the sign\nof \u201cabsolute positing\u201d (unbedingte Aufstellung)\n(Herbart 1813: 49). While Brentano praises Herbart for holding this\nview, he does not pick up his terminology, expecting little insight\nfrom the associations it encourages.\n\nThese comparisons are not only historically instructive. They give us\na good sense of how radical Brentano\u2019s position really is. It is\nradical in its demand that a theory of judgement must accommodate and\nnot explain away existential judgements. And it is even more radical\nin its refusal to make existential judgements satisfy any version of\nthe view of judging as a combinatory or synthetic act, which would\nnicely fit with the correspondence theory of truth. In refusing to\ntake this step that most philosophers considered to be inevitable,\nBrentano put a heavy burden on a theory of judgement that tries to\ngive a uniform account of existential and subjectless judgements as\nwell as categorical judgements. Brentano thought that he can pull off\nthis trick by turning the traditional approach to this problem inside\nout: instead of trying to show that in fact all judgements are\ncategorical ones, he tries to show that all judgements are\nexistential. If all judgements are reducible to existential ones, no\njudgement applies a property or concept to an object. That may sound\nludicrous, but it is the only alternative left, unless one is willing\nto sacrifice the goal of giving a uniform account of judgement as a\ndistinct mental category.\n",
