    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Terminology\n2. Hume\u2019s Terminology\n\nHume regards the natural capacity of taste as fundamental to the human\nability to make moral and aesthetic judgments. Like his predecessors,\nHume sees an analogy between an \u201cinner sense\u201d for beauty\nand the sense of taste for food and drink. Natural, general laws guide\nboth. Both permit of education and refinement and thus better and\nworse responses. Both produce sentiments or feelings of approval and\ndisapproval. But only the \u201cmental\u201d taste, the exercise of\nwhich is involved in moral and aesthetic judgment, admits of\nrefinement through \u201cthe interposition\u201d of ideas (T, 275).\n\n\nHume\u2019s eighteenth-century terminology includes a pair of terms\nno longer in general use. In his basic nomenclature, \u201ctaste in\nmorals, eloquence, or beauty\u201d assigns either\n\u201capprobation\u201d or \u201cdisapprobation\u201d (or some\ncombination of both) to objects of taste (T, 547n). Approbation is\n\u201ca peculiar delight\u201d (T, 298) and a\n\u201cparticular kind of pleasure\u201d (T, 472). It feels\ndifferent from other pleasures. He variously characterizes approbation\nas a feeling of approval, liking, or affection. A beautiful object or\naction strikes us as amiable, agreeable, and desirable. Yet moral and\naesthetic responses are not identical, for \u201cthe satisfaction is\ndifferent, [which] keeps our sentiments concerning them from being\nconfounded\u201d (T, 472). Hume describes the feeling of\ndisapprobation as one of disapproving, disliking, and contempt. An\nugly object or vicious action feels odious, disagreeable, and\nundesirable.\n\nIn the eighteenth-century context of moral theory,\n\u201csentiment\u201d is a generic label for emotions. (Hume\u2019s\ntheory is sometimes identified as \u201csentimentalism,\u201d but\nthat term has unfortunate modern connotations\u2014though see the\nentry on\n moral sentimentalism.)\n In Hume\u2019s technical vocabulary, all emotions are impressions,\nnot ideas. The sentiments associated with beauty and ugliness are\nreflective impressions. They are not \u201cimpressions of the\nsenses.\u201d Instead, they are responses to sensory impressions (T,\n276).\n\nBeauty is a feeling of approbation, and an original, simple impression\nof the mind. Impressions are contrasted with ideas, which he\nalternatively calls \u201cthoughts.\u201d Ideas are\n\u201ccopies\u201d of impressions, and seldom have the force or\nclarity of the experiences they copy. For Hume, experiencing a\nparticular kind of approbation is a necessary condition for thinking\nabout the idea of beauty. An individual cannot construct the idea of\nbeauty out of other ideas, which is equivalent to saying that the idea\nderives from the proper sentiment of approbation (T, 469). In the\ncomplete absence of the operations of taste, thoughts about beauty\nwould not occur.\n\nTaste is the capacity to respond with approbation and disapprobation.\nBut how does taste relate to Hume\u2019s various remarks about\n\u201cperceptions\u201d and \u201cdiscernments\u201d of beauty, of\nour \u201cjudging\u201d a work, and of critics who \u201cgive\njudgment\u201d and who \u201cgive\u201d or \u201cpronounce\u201d\na \u201cverdict\u201d or \u201crecommendation\u201d (SOT, passim)?\nHume seems to equate perception of beauty with the experience of the\nsentiment. (This equation underlies the problem of whether all tastes\nare equal). Does he distinguish between the critic\u2019s experience\nof the sentiment and the judgment or verdict? If a verbal\npronouncement that an object is beautiful is nothing more than an\nexpression or report of the speaker\u2019s sentiment, then Hume faces\nthe difficulty that a critic\u2019s verdict is not really a\nrecommendation of the object. If your pronouncement that a piece of\nmusic is beautiful means no more than that you have felt a certain\npleasure upon hearing it, then your verdict expresses your pleasure\nwithout saying anything about the music\u2019s capacity to please\nothers. So although critics issue judgments of taste based on their\nown sentiments, a judgment of taste must involve something more than a\npleasing or displeasing sentiment.\u00a0\n\nHume observes that there is a difference between expressing\none\u2019s own sentiments and making a moral distinction. When\nsomeone speaks of another\u2019s behavior as \u201cvicious\nor odious or depraved, he then speaks another\nlanguage, and expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his\naudience to concur with him\u201d (EPM, 272). Moral and aesthetic\njudgment requires \u201csteady and general points\nof view\u201d (T, 581\u201382; see also SOT, 276), common to others\n(EPM, 272). Hume\u2019s various descriptions of this point of view\ninvite conflicting interpretations. However, it clearly requires the\ncritic to reflect upon the relationship between the sentiment and its\nobject.\n\nWhether we call them \u201caesthetic judgments\u201d or\n\u201cjudgments of taste,\u201d aesthetic verdicts are unlike\nordinary judgments about matters of fact. Matters of fact are relevant\nstates of affairs, which render complex ideas either true or false.\nThe same cannot be said about verdicts arising from the operations of\ntaste. Sentiment, and sentiment alone, determines that a particular\nobject is or is not beautiful.\n\nTruth is disputable; not taste: what exists in the nature of things is\nthe standard of our judgement; what each man feels within himself is\nthe standard of sentiment. Propositions in geometry may be proved,\nsystems in physics may be controverted; but the harmony of verse, the\ntenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must give immediate\npleasure (EPM, 171).\n\n\nWe do not infer that a sunset is beautiful and so deserving of\napprobation. We see the sunset, and the visual impressions please us.\nIf we have the proper point of view, we are justified in saying that\nthe sunset is beautiful. This verdict is more than a report or\nexpression of the sentiment, yet the sentiment is an irreplaceable\nelement of the judgment. A parallel claim is made of moral\ndiscrimination. \u201cPleasure and pain,\u201d he insists, are the\n\u201cessence\u201d of beauty and deformity (T, 299). But how does a\nliterary work \u201cgive immediate pleasure\u201d?\n\nOne of Hume\u2019s most puzzling claims is that taste is an\n\u201cimmediate\u201d response. In his extended treatment of the\npassions and emotions in the Treatise, Hume says that\n\u201cimmediate\u201d feelings are ones that do not involve the\n\u201cinterposition\u201d of ideas (T, 275). Some pleasures and\npains are \u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that they are\nimpressions that immediately accompany other impressions (e.g., the\nexperience of a very hot flame is accompanied by an experience of\npain). How does a literary work \u201cgive immediate pleasure\u201d?\nTaken literally, the Treatise appears to commit Hume to the\nview that literary works are beautiful independent of the\naudience\u2019s ability to assign ideas or meanings to the words. As\nnoted by James Grant (2014, p. 368), the Treatise sometimes\nposits a distinction between beauty, which is the quality of the\nobject that acts upon us, and the pleasure it arouses. But these\nproposals are not repeated in Hume\u2019s later writings and a\ncommitment to observer-independent beauty is certainly not\nHume\u2019s mature position. His official theory is that there is\n\u201cmental, as well as bodily taste\u201d (SOT, 274), and both\nmoral and aesthetic discrimination depend on mental taste. The\nrequisite sentiments are spontaneous products of the mind, but they\nare not uninformed responses.\n\nMental taste normally requires some intervening thought process. So\nthe pleasures and pains of aesthetic judgment are not immediate in\nbeing direct responses to other impressions.\n\nSome species of beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first\nappearance, command our affection and approbation; and where they fail\nof this effect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their\ninfluence, or adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in\nmany orders of beauty, particularly those of the finer arts, it is\nrequisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper\nsentiment; and a false relish may frequently be corrected by argument\nand reflection. There are just grounds to conclude, that moral beauty\npartakes much of this latter species, and demands the assistance of\nour intellectual faculties, in order to give it a suitable influence\non the human mind (EPM, 173).\n\n\nMental taste arises in response to ideas that arise in response to\nimpressions (e.g., viewing a photograph occasions thoughts about the\nplace pictured, leading to thoughts about experiences one had or might\nhave there, and the thoughts arising in this imaginative process are\npleasurable or painful). Hume regards this \u201cimmediacy\u201d of\ntaste as entirely compatible with the influence of intellectual and\nimaginative faculties.\n\nTaste is immediate and spontaneous, yet the application of \u201cgood\nsense\u201d and \u201creason\u201d improves it (SOT, 277). Taste is\nnot improved by reasoning from a priori normative principles. Moral\nand aesthetic discriminations \u201care not conclusions of\nreason\u201d (T, 457). Neither results from a mere \u201ccomparing\nof ideas\u201d (T, 463). However, taste can be influenced by\nconsultation of \u201cgeneral rules of art\u201d or\n\u201crules\u201d that \u201care founded only on experience and\nobservation\u201d (SOT, 270). For different views on the content of\nthese rules or principles, see Hester (1979), Dickie (1996, pp.\n126\u2013131), Shelley (2002), Dickie (2003), and Shelley (2004).\nMental taste involves reason in the sense of \u201csound\nunderstanding,\u201d which ultimately depends on imaginative\nassociations of ideas. So taste involves imaginative pleasure, as\nAddison proposed. This doctrine of imaginative pleasure has no special\nconnection with creativity or with the capacity to produce art.\n\nTo summarize Hume on taste, aesthetic and moral response is\n\u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that the feeling occurs\nspontaneously in anyone who makes customary imaginative associations.\nHume wants to emphasize that a critic does not infer the presence of\nbeauty. Yet he also acknowledges the relevance of sound understanding\nto taste. This combination of doctrines has implications for the\npractice of justifying judgments of taste, and becomes the focus of\nthe essay \u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d Knowing that a\nsonnet has the same form as a second, beautiful sonnet will not offer\nany reason to think that they are equally fine poems. Only a reading\nof the sonnet can support claims about its beauty. However,\nHume\u2019s theory should be interpreted with caution, against the\nbackdrop of his other claims about moral and aesthetic distinctions.\nThe general, natural principles of taste are supplemented by learned\nrules, so that knowledge of other sonnets contributes to a more\naccurate or refined evaluation of the merits and flaws of a particular\nsonnet. His subjectivism does not lead to relativism. Not every\nsentiment is equally good.\n",
