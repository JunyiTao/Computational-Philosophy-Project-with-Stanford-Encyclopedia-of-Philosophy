    "main_text": "A Paradigm Shift in Analytic Epistemology || The Basic Components: The Reliability of Mental Processes in Determining True vs. False Beliefs\n1.1 The Basic Components: The Reliability of Mental Processes in Determining True vs. False Beliefs\n\nThe key idea behind Goldman\u2019s reliabilist approach is that the\njustifiedness of a belief depends on the mental history of\nthe subject\u2019s belief. In particular, it depends on the\nreliability of the process(es) which cause the belief in\nquestion. Somewhat similar ideas (or segments thereof) have been\nadvanced by a number of predecessors, often focusing on knowledge\nrather than justification. Frank Ramsey (1931) wrote that a belief\nqualifies as knowledge if it is true, certain, and obtained\nby a reliable process. He did not, however, provide a detailed defense\nof this thesis. Peter Unger (1968) proposed that S knows that\np just in case \u201cit is not at all accidental\u201d that\nS is right about its being the case that p. David\nArmstrong (1973) offered an analysis of non-inferential knowledge that\nexplicitly used the term \u201creliable\u201d. He drew an analogy\nbetween a thermometer that reliably indicates the temperature and a\nbelief that reliably indicates the truth. All of these\nwriters seemed to endorse some variant of reliabilism,\nalthough typically there were minor or major differences from the\nversion we shall focus on here. For example, Armstrong promoted an\n\u201cindicator\u201d variant of reliabilism rather than a\n\u201cpsychological process\u201d variant. And Unger presented\n\u201cnon-accidentality\u201d rather than\n\u201ctruth-conduciveness\u201d as the central determinant of\njustifiedness. Clearly, however, there is a great deal of convergence\nin these views. So, contemporary defenders of epistemic reliabilism\nhave grounds for optimism that they are laboring in promising terrain.\nThe nitty-gritty details, however, still need additional work, as we\nshall see in the body of this entry. We turn now to some of the\nprincipal details of Goldman\u2019s form of reliabilism for\njustification (Goldman, 1979, 1986).\n\nGoldman began by proposing some desiderata on any account of\njustification. First, theories of justification should specify\nconditions for justified belief that do not invoke the concept of\njustification itself, or any other epistemically normative concepts\nsuch as reasonability or rationality. The aim is to provide a\n\u201creductive\u201d account of justification that does not appeal\nexplicitly or implicitly to any notions that entail justification or\nother members of that family. There is bite in this requirement. For\nexample, it might preclude an analysis of justified belief in terms of\n\u201cevidence\u201d, unless evidence can itself be characterized in\nnon-epistemic terms. What kinds of terms or properties, then, are\nappropriate for constructing an account of justification? Permissible\nconcepts or properties would include doxastic ones, such as belief,\ndisbelief, suspension of judgment, and any other purely psychological\nconcepts, such as ones that refer to perceptual experience or memory.\nGiven the assumption that truth and falsity are non-epistemic notions,\nthey would also be perfectly legitimate for use in analyzing\njustifiedness. Another admissible element in an account of\njustifiedness is the causal relation.\n\nProceeding under these constraints, Goldman was led to the\n\u201creliable process\u201d theory as follows. (Note that the main\nconcept to be tackled here is doxastic justifiedness rather\nthan propositional justifiedness. That is, it focuses on what\nit takes for a belief to be justified rather than what it\ntakes for someone to have grounds for forming such a belief.)\nFirst, examples were adduced to show that the justifiedness of\nparticular beliefs depends on how those beliefs are caused,\nor causally sustained, in the mind of the thinker. Suppose\nArthur justifiedly believes a conjunction of propositions, \\(q \\amp\nr\\), from which proposition \\(p\\) follows logically. Further suppose\nthat, soon after forming his belief in this conjunction, Arthur also\nforms a belief in \\(p\\). Does it follow from this that Arthur\u2019s\nbelief in \\(p\\) is justified? No. Although Arthur believes \\(q \\amp\nr\\), this conjunction may not have played any causal role in his\ncoming to believe \\(p\\). He may have formed his belief in \\(p\\) purely\nby wishful thinking. Perhaps he hoped \\(p\\) would be true,\nand therefore (somehow) came to believe it. Alternatively, suppose\nArthur employed confused reasoning that began with \\(q \\amp r\\), and\nserendipitously led to \\(p\\). In neither case is his resulting belief\nin \\(p\\) justified. This shows that a necessary condition for a belief\nto be justified is that it be produced or generated\nin a suitable way. Of course, this immediately raises the\nquestion: which kinds of belief-forming processes are suitable and\nwhich are defective or unsuitable?\n\nOne feature that is shared by wishful thinking and confused reasoning\nis doxastic unreliability. These belief-forming methods commonly\ngenerate beliefs that are false rather than true. By contrast, what\ntypes of belief-forming processes commonly confer justification? They\ninclude standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning,\nand introspection. What is shared by these processes? What they share\nis reliability: most of the beliefs they produce are true. (This\nformulation will be slightly refined later.) Thus, the central\nproposal made in \u201cWhat Is Justified Belief\u201d is that the\njustifiedness or unjustifiedness of a belief is determined by the\nreliability or unreliability of the process or processes that cause\nit. Reliability can here be understood either in a frequency\nsense (pertaining to what occurs in the actual world) or in a\npropensity sense (pertaining both to the actual-world and\nother possible worlds.). A belief earns the status of\n\u201cjustified\u201d if it is produced by a process (or series of\nprocesses) that has a high truth-ratio. Precisely how high a\ntruth-ratio must be in order to confer justifiedness is left vague,\njust as the concept of justification itself is vague. The truth-ratio\nthreshold need not be as high as 1.0, but it must surely be greater\n(presumably, quite a lot greater) than .50.\n\nA number of conclusions were drawn from these main points, and\nrefinements were added. One consequence was that process reliabilism\nis a historical type of theory. For example, a reliable inferential\nprocess confers justification on a new belief only if the input\nbeliefs (premises) were themselves justified. How could the\njustifiedness of these input beliefs have arisen? Presumably, their\njustifiedness arose because they were produced by earlier applications\nof reliable processes. Such a chain of processes must ultimately\noriginate from one or more reliable processes that themselves had no\ndoxastic inputs. Perceptual inputs are good candidates for such\nprocesses. So, on this approach, justifiedness is often a product of a\nhistory of personal cognitive processes. The historical framework of\nsuch a process theory contrasts sharply with more traditional\nepistemological frameworks, such as coherentism and (certain versions\nof) evidentialism. According to these more traditional theories,\ncausal and historical relations play no role in determining\njustifiedness. (Though see, e.g., Goldberg 2012 and Fleisher 2019 for\nviews that combine elements of coherentism and reliabilism; for views\nthat integrate evidentialism and reliabilism, see\n \u00a74.2\n below.) More generally, reliabilism marks an important break with\n\u201ccurrent time-slice\u201d approaches, according to which the\nepistemic status of a belief at time t depends entirely on the\nsubject\u2019s mental states at t.\n\nThese fundamental ideas were spelled out by Goldman in \u201cWhat Is\nJustified Belief?\u201d (1979), in a series of principles including\nbase-clause principles and recursive-clause principles. The initial\none was (1):\n\n(1)\nIf S\u2019s belief in p at t is a product of\na reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or set of processes),\nthen S\u2019s belief in p at t is\njustified.\n\n\nThis principle would fit cases of perceptually caused beliefs and\nother beliefs that make no use of prior doxastic states (as inputs).\nBut inference-generated beliefs require a different principle. When a\nnew belief results from an inference, its justificational status\ndepends not only on the properties of the inferential\nprocess, but also on whether the input beliefs themselves\nwere justified. To accommodate this, a slightly more complex principle\nwas introduced:\n\n(2)\nIf S\u2019s belief in p results from a\nconditionally reliable belief-dependent process, and if the\nbeliefs on which this process operated in generating S\u2019s\nbelief in P are themselves justified, then\nS\u2019s new belief in P is also\njustified.\n\n\nBy philosophical standards, these are not terribly complex principles.\nThus, process reliabilism is a comparatively simple and\nstraightforward theory. Such simplicity has usually been viewed as a\nvirtue of the approach. Of course, matters are more complicated than\nthe foregoing principles convey. We will survey some potential\ncomplications and refinements of this theory below.\n",
