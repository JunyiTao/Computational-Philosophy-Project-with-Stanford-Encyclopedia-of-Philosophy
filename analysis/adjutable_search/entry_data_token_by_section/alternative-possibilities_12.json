    "main_text": "Arguments against PAP || Compelled but Willing Action\n3.2 Compelled but Willing Action\n\nThe previous section tried to undermine PAP by arguing that our\npractices of praise and blame are neutral on whether we have\nalternatives. A more direct line of attack\u2014to explored in this\nand following sections\u2014tries to produce cases in which we\nproperly praise or blame agents even while knowing they lack\nalternatives.\n\nOne sort of example is from the Stoics (Inwood & Gerson 1988:\n134). Imagine a dog happily running behind a cart to which he is\nchained. The cart makes the dog\u2019s running inevitable\u2014he\ncannot do otherwise\u2014yet he nevertheless runs willingly. Whatever\nexactly the Stoics meant by this example (Sauv\u00e9 Meyer 1999;\nHankinson 2014), an opponent of PAP may be inspired to argue by\nanalogy that necessity or \u201cfate\u201d doesn\u2019t preclude\nresponsibility. Even if Kurt is fated to steal John\u2019s lunch,\nhe\u2019s still responsible for doing so if he acts willingly: even\nif fate \u201cpulls\u201d him along like the cart, he could be a\nhappy and contributing participant. Similarly, imagine a drug user\nwhose addiction compels him to take a drug, but who doesn\u2019t mind\nbeing addicted, and thus indulges willingly. The addict is responsible\nfor taking the drug, even if he couldn\u2019t do otherwise (Frankfurt\n1971; cf. Wallace 1994: 172\u20135; the irresistible addiction, while\nperhaps useful for making such conceptual points, appears not to match\nactual cases of addiction: see Levy 2006; Pickard 2015.)\n\nThat said, the power of such examples against PAP is limited, as they\ninvolve the sorts of compulsion usually thought to preclude\nresponsibility (cp. Lamb 1993). At best these are examples of\noverdetermination: responsibility-undermining factors are at work,\neven if the agent\u2019s own character and values play a (redundant)\nrole in producing the action. A kind of case to be considered next,\nhowever, may be more effective.\n",
