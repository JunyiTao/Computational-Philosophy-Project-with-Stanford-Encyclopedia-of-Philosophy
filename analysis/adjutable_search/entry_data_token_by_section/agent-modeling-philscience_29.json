    "main_text": "Epistemology of Agent-Based Modeling || The \u201cfamily of models perspective\u201d\n6. Conclusion and Outlook\n\nThis entry has provided an overview of applications of agent-based\nmodeling to issues studied by philosophers of science. Since such\napplications are primarily concerned with social aspects of scientific\ninquiry, ABMs in philosophy of science are mainly developed within the\nsubfield of formal social epistemology of science. While agent-based\nmodeling has experienced rapid growth in this domain, it remains to\nstand the test of time. In particular, foundational issues concerning\nthe epistemic status of abstract models and their methodological\nunderpinnings (for instance, the KISS vs. the KIDS approach, see\n footnote 14)\n remain open. Having said that, theoretical achievements made with the\nexisting models have been remarkable and they provide a firm ground\nfor further growth of agent-based modeling as a philosophical\nmethod.\n\nOne avenue that has received relatively little attention is the\ncombination of agent-based modeling and empirical methods. Although\nearly philosophical discussions on ABMs emphasized the fruitful\ncombination of experimental and computational methods (see, e.g.,\nHartmann, Lisciandra, & Machery 2013), this area has not been\nexplored extensively, leaving ample opportunities for future research.\nFor instance, highly idealized ABMs can benefit from validation in\nterms of experimental studies (as exemplified by Mohseni et al. 2021).\nMoreover, qualitative research, such as ethnographic studies of\nscientific communities, can help to empirically inform assumptions\nused to build models (see, e.g., Ghorbani, Dijkema, & Schrauwen\n2015).\n\nAnother emerging line of inquiry comes from the recent developments in\nartificial intelligence. In particular, big data and machine-learning\nmodels can be a fruitful way of generating input for ABMs, such as the\nbehavior of agents (see, e.g., Kavak, Padilla, Lynch, & Diallo\n2018; Zhang, Valencia, & Chang 2023). For instance, natural\nlanguage processing technology has been used to represent agents who\nexpress their arguments in terms of natural language (Betz 2022). Such\nenhancements provide novel opportunities for highly idealized models:\nfrom their robustness analyses in which certain assumptions are\nde-idealized to the exploration of novel questions and phenomena.\n",
