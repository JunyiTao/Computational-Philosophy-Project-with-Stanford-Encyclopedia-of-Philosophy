    "main_text": "Objections || 3 New Objections to Convergence\n7. Applied Issues\n\nTheorists often use public justification to address important applied\nquestions. Applied questions concern religion in liberal democracies,\nreligious exemptions, feminism, marriage policy, environmental issues,\nhealthy eating policies, and even public reason and Confucianism.\nApplied issues are the order of the day in much of the literature.\n\nOn the religion in politics literature, see the entry on\n religion and political theory.\n Also, see literature reviews in March 2013, Vallier 2014, and Bailey\nand Gentile 2014. While many public reason liberals have moved away\nfrom a restraint-based approach to religion in public life (Gaus and\nVallier 2009, Laborde 2017, newer work defends such principles (Watson\nand Hartley 2018). Some even focus public reason on discourse, setting\npublic justification aside (Leland 2019). Still other theorists have\nfocused on developing principles of restraint appropriate for managing\npartisanship and the conduct of political parties (Bonotti 2017).\n\nWe have seen the rapid expansion of the literature on public reason\nand religious exemptions, brought into clear focus in Cecile\nLaborde\u2019s (2017) work. (Also see Bespalov 2019.) Some of the\nexemption literature extends into medical exemptions. See McConnell\nand Card 2019.\n\nPublic reason and feminism discussions are now voluminous. (Okin 1994,\nRawls 2002, Nussbaum 2003, Baehr 2008, Hartley and Watson 2009,\nHartley and Watson 2010, Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014, and Watson\nand Hartley 2018).\n\nTo explore public justification and marriage policy, see Brake 2010,\nMacedo 2015, Chambers 2017, and Toop 2019.\n\nPublic reason methods have also been applied to environmental issues\n(Shahar forthcoming; Nielsen and Hauge-Helgestad 2021), as well as\nhealthy eating policy (Bonotti and Barnhill 2019).\n\nWe are also seeing the beginnings of a discussion about the\nintersection of public reason and the Confucian religion (Kim 2019;\nD\u2019Ambrosio 2019).\n\nWe have also seen the introduction of new formal methods into public\nreason, such as social choice theory (Kogelmann 2017, 2019; Chung\n2020), agent-based modeling (Muldoon 2019, Gaus 2021), and fixed-point\ntheorems (Schaefer 2022).\n",
