    "main_text": "Early Phenomenology || Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Psychology\n2.1 Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Psychology\n\nStein developed her philosophy of psychology in the\nBeitr\u00e4ge around the time she was also editing\nHusserl\u2019s Ideas II and it neatly ties in with the\nlatter\u2019s aim of developing a transcendental phenomenological\naccount of the human person. The systematic connection between the two\nmain parts of Stein\u2019s Beitr\u00e4ge (\u201cPsychic\nCausality\u201d and \u201cIndividual and Community\u201d) lies in\nthe overarching project of the work to carve out the ontological place\nof the human person in relation to both the natural and the spiritual\nworlds, the latter of which is constituted by social and communal\nrelations (1922: 3[1], 110[129]).\n\nThree issues sit at the center of Stein\u2019s philosophy of mind and\npsychology: \n\nthe connections between conscious experiences, (the stream of)\nconsciousness and the mental and psychic domain; \nthe motivational laws of the mental, conative and volitional\ndomain, and \nthe \u201cintertwinement\u201d (Ineinandergreifen) of\ndifferent forms of causality and motivation. \n\n\nAll three issues cluster around Stein\u2019s multilayered account of\ncausality and her original conception of so-called \u201cpsychic\ncausality\u201d. The notion of psychic causality is introduced\nagainst the background of the traditional determinism/indeterminism\ndebate, and aims to present an alternative to both a\nreduction of the psyche to physical nature and a complete\nseparation of the former from the latter (1922: 5[2]).\n\nAccording to Stein, nothing in the emergence of an experiential phase\nis determined. It does not make any phenomenological sense to inquire\ninto determining causes here; experiences simply \u201cflow\nalong\u201d in a \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d and constitute\n\u201can undivided and indivisible continuum\u201d (1922: 11[9]).\nWhat constitutes their (diachronic and experiential) unity is the\n\u201coriginally generating\u201d or \u201cultimately\nconstituting\u201d (urspr\u00fcnglich zeugend,\nletzt-konstituierend) stream itself (1922: 12[10]). This, in\nturn, is unified by the irreducible experiential fact that all\nexperiences \u201cemanate from one I\u201d (1922:\n15[13]).\n\nSo far, then, natural causality seems to have no place in the\nexperiential life of subject. However, as Stein already claims in her\nEmpathy-book (1917: 66\u201368[49\u201351]) and elaborates\nthroughout the Beitr\u00e4ge, a different form of causality\nis at work on the experiential level. The causally efficacious\nexperiential states in the psychic life of individuals are so-called\n\u201clife-feelings\u201d (Lebensgef\u00fchle) and a\nsubject\u2019s \u201clife-power\u201d (Lebenskraft; a term\nthat originates in Hermann Lotze (1843), but that we also find in\nTheodor Lipps (1883), from whom Stein probably takes the term).\nLife-feelings are, broadly speaking, best understood as the affective\ndispositions of a psychophysical organism that bring about certain\ncognitive, conative or affective states. They determine the very way a\nsubject is aware of and experiences these states. They also determine\none\u2019s own bodily awareness, i.e., one\u2019s \u201cbodily\nattunement\u201d (leibliche Befinden; 1917: 87[70]). Stein\ncharacterizes life-feelings as the \u201cmomentary state\n(Beschaffenheit) of the I\u2014its life-disposition\n(Lebenszust\u00e4ndlichkeit)\u201d (1922: 22[22]). If this\ndisposition is sedimented, it becomes a subject\u2019s life-power\n(ibid.; see\n sect. 2.2;\n see Betschart 2009). Typical examples of life-feelings are weariness,\nfreshness, vigor, and irritability. Such psychic-bodily dispositions\n\u201ceffectuate\u201d (wirkend) experiential changes in\n\u201cone\u2019s feeling disposed (Sichbefinden)\u201d and\nin turn \u201cinfluence the whole course of the co-occurring\nexperiences\u201d. If I feel weary, \u201ceverything that emerges in\nvarious fields of sensation will be affected by it\u201d, colors will\nappear colorless, sounds toneless, etc. (1922: 16[15]; see also 1922:\n65[75]; 75[86]).\n\nIn order to account for these effects, Stein introduces the notion of\n\u201ccausality of the experiential domain\u201d.\n\u201cExperiential causality\u201d\n(Erlebniskausalit\u00e4t) is different from \u201cmechanical\ncausality\u201d but may still be viewed as an \u201canalogon of\ncausality in the realm of physical nature\u201d (1922:\n16\u201317[15]. According to Stein\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic\ndescription compared to the classical Humean conceptions, there is a\ntripartite chain of events in mechanistic causation: \n\n a \u201ccausing\u201d (verursachendes; e.g., the\nmovement of a ball) and\n a \u201ccaused event\u201d (verursachtes Geschehen),\nor the effect (e.g., another ball moving), and \n a sort of mediating \u201cevent\u201d that is the proper\n\u201ccause\u201d (Ursache). \n\n\nThus, in mechanistic causation, two events are interconnected by a\nthird, whereas in experiential causation, there are only two\noccurrences, jointly causing experiential change. Here, the two\nexperiences causally interconnected are both subject to\n\u201cchange\u201d, and jointly effectuate a \u201cchange in the\nwhole course of the simultaneous experience\u201d (1922: 16[15]).\n\u201cThe life-feeling corresponds to the causing event\u201d, while\n\u201cthe course of the rest of the experience corresponds to the\ncaused event\u201d (1922: 17[15]). But the event, referred to as\n\u201cthe cause\u201d of the experiential change, \u201cis not\ninserted between causing and caused event\u201d. It is not\nindependent from the experiential change, but rather an intrinsic\nmoment of it. Accordingly, it is impossible for a subject to have\ncertain life-feelings that have no effect on the course of her\nexperiences. But what mechanistic and experiential causation share is\nthat there cannot be causally contradicting events or outright\nincoherent requisite outcomes of the causal process. For example, \n\n\njust as it is inconceivable that a ball that\u2019s flung down rises\nup as a result of the pitch, it is inconceivable that weariness\n\u201cenlivens\u201d the stream of consciousness. (1922:\n17[15\u201316])\n\n\nStein distinguishes three aspects of experiences and asks whether and\nhow they are subject to psychic-causal influences: \n\n\n(1) a content that is taken up into consciousness (e.g., a\ncolor datum or enjoyment); (2) the experience (Erleben) of\nthat content, its being-taken-up (Aufgenommenwerden) into\nconsciousness (the having of the sensation, the feeling of enjoyment);\n(3) the consciousness of that experiencing, which\u2014in a higher or\nlower degree\u2014always accompanies it and because of which the\nexperiencing itself is also called consciousness. (1922:\n18[16\u201317]) \n\n\nImportantly, she argues that all these dimensions are subject to the\npsychic-causal influence of one\u2019s life-feelings and psychic\ndispositions (1922: 19[19]). For instance, \n\n\nwith mounting freshness, the awareness of the experiencing increases\nand so do the clarity, discriminateness, and, we might well say, the\n\u201cliveliness\u201d of the contents. (ibid.)\n\n\nThe psyche, then, is characterized by an \u201cincessant occurring\n(Geschehen)\u201d and \u201cincessant effecting\u201d\n(Wirken; 1922: 27[29]). Indeed, Stein puts forth the\n\u201cgeneral law of causality\u201d, according to which\n\u201call psychic occurrences are caused (kausal\nbedingt)\u201d (1922: 29[32]). Causality plays an ontologically\nconstitutive role. There is \u201cno psychic reality without\ncausality\u201d (ibid.); everything that enters the psychic domain\n\u201cowes its existence\u201d and is regulated by life-power, and\nlife-power alone (1922: 27[29]).\n\nBut where does this leave us with regard to individuals being\ndetermined by psychic powers? Stein cautions us that with the\nlaws of psychic causation \u201cnothing whatsoever is yet\ndecided\u201d about the issue of determinism (1922: 29\u201330[32]).\nStein concludes that we have only \u201cprobabilistic\ninferences\u201d and \u201cvague\u201d laws here (1922: 33[36], see\nalso 80\u201381[92\u201393], 98\u201399[114\u2013115]). Notice,\nhowever, that it doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that the relation\nbetween psychic causes and their effects cannot be\n\u201cexactly predicted\u201d or \u201cdetermined\u201d\nthat there are no \u201cintuitively evident (einsichtige)\ncorrelations\u201d to be discovered (1922: 33[36]). Quite the\ncontrary, and it is precisely the task of the\nphenomenological psychologist to explore these. Herein also\nlies the originality of Stein\u2019s conception of the laws of\npsychic causality vis-\u00e0-vis both Humean causality,\nwhere the issue is the temporal separateness and ontological\nindependence of cause and effect, and the conception of\n\u201cvague\u201d nomological correlations that non-exact empirical\nand social sciences deal with, which for Stein are exemplified by\n\u201cdescriptive natural sciences and folk-psychology\u201d\n(ibid.). Compared to both these traditional conceptions of causality,\nthe distinctive feature of a phenomenological psychological\nexplanation of the causal laws of the psychic domain is that\nwe can in fact \u201cinfer from perceptually given [psychic]\nfacts\u201d of a given individual her future ones. Importantly,\nhowever, such inferences have only \u201cempirical validity\u201d,\nthey are always \u201cdefeasible or corrigible\u201d by the\nexperience of the respective subject (1922:\n33\u201334[36\u201337]).\n\nMoreover, Stein points to another consideration that speaks against\npsychic determinism. After all, whether or not a \u201cgiven state is\nexactly determined by the series of preceding ones and can be\nmeasured\u201d depends on whether there is something \u201cother\nthan merely causal factors\u201d at play (1922: 30[32]).\nIndeed, a large part of Beitr\u00e4ge is devoted to exploring\nthese other factors and their interplay with the psychic and spiritual\nstates of individuals. Specifically, \u201cthe life of the psyche\n[is] the result of the interplay of different types of powers\u201d\n(1922: 99[115]). Roughly, these are: (1) sensate and (2) spiritual\nlife-powers, (3) the various motivational and non-motivational powers\nresulting from drives, strivings, impulses, inclinations, intentions,\nas well as cognitive, evaluative and volitional \u201cstances\u201d\n(Stellungnahmen), (4) the will-power of autonomous\nindividuals, and (5) the motivational forces of the spiritual domain\nand the laws of reason. Let us summarize their different roles and\nfunctions vis-\u00e0-vis the constitution and the determination of\npsychic and mental life.\n\nStein distinguishes \u201cspiritual\u201d (geistige) from\n\u201csensate\u201d (sinnliche) life-power (1922:\n69\u201376[79\u201387]). Sensate life-power \u201croots the psyche\nin nature\u201d (1922: 99[115]), namely through the psyche\u2019s\n\u201centrenchment\u201d in the lived body (Leiblichkeit);\nand by virtue of the lived body\u2019s dependence on what Stein calls\nPhysis, a dependence established by the sensate dimension,\nsensate life-power grounds the psyche also in \u201cmaterial\nnature\u201d (1922: 70[81]). Sensate life-power \n\n\ntransforms the reception of sensory data or to different capacities\nfor the reception of sensory data, as well as into sensual drives and\ntheir activities. (1922: 99[115]) \n\n\nNotice that the psychic and sensate dimension of the body at stake\nhere is partly determined by psychic causality and life-power and, at\nthe same time, is \u201cexperienced as bodily-lived states\u201d\n(als leibliche Zust\u00e4nde erlebt). In this respect,\nStein\u2019s conception of the sensate dimension of bodily feelings\ncuts across the traditional phenomenological distinction between the\nlived or felt body (Leib), on the one hand, and the material\nbody under a third-personal, physical description\n(K\u00f6rper), on the other (see on Stein\u2019s\nLeib/K\u00f6per-distinction esp. 1917:\n56\u201365[40\u201348]). While sensate life-power, then, grounds the\npsyche in the lived body as well as the material body and nature,\nspiritual life-power, \u201cmakes the psyche accessible to the world\nof objects\u201d. It derives its powers from the \u201cworld of\nvalues\u201d as well as from the spiritual power of other individuals\nand the \u201cspirit of god\u201d (1922: 99[115]). It concerns all\nthe dispositions and capabilities of the subject that are required for\nengaging in cognitive and creative processes, with different sorts of\nvalues, as well as with other persons and their values (1922:\n70\u201375[81\u201386]). Spiritual and sensate life-powers, in turn,\nare interwoven through psychic causality.\n\nPsychic states and dispositions vary with regard to their\ndetermined/indeterminate and motivational nature. Stein identifies\nnumerous complex factors that affect the nature of a psychic state or\ndisposition, such as its teleological nature or purposefulness\n(zielgerichtet), whether it is triggered by rational motives\nor pure sensory stimuli, or how the subject actively relates to it and\nregulates its influences (1922: 53\u201356[61\u201365];\n60\u201364[68\u201374]; 78\u201380[90\u201392]). Strivings, for\ninstance, are subject to psychic causation and affective or evaluative\n\u201cstances of the ego\u201d (e.g., delighting over the\npleasantness of an alluring journey) but also to the forces of the\nvolitional domain (1922: 55[62]). The volitional domain is itself\ncomplex, incorporating efforts (Sichbem\u00fchen), intentions\n(Vorsatz), volitional acts (Willensakt), volitional\nstances (Willensstellungnahme), and the actual initiation of\nan action (Einleiten der Handlung; 1922:\n48\u201353[55\u201360]; 61\u201364[70\u201374];\n76\u201380[87\u201392]). Volitions require, as all other\nexperiential acts, a certain amount of life-power, and accordingly sap\nthe life-power of individuals (1922: 76[87]; 80[92]). Intentions, on\nthe other hand, mediate between volitional stances and actions (1922:\n76[88]). As such, intentions derive their force from their own\nspontaneous impulses (1922: 78[90]); they constitute the \u201cfree\nmoment\u201d in human psychology.\n\nMotivation is the \u201cenacting\u201d of an experience\n\u201cdue to (auf Grund) the other, for the\nsake of the other\u201d (1922: 36[41]). It is the\n\u201cfundamental lawfulness of spiritual life\u201d (1922: 35[39]),\nand \u201csubjects the psyche to the rule of reasons\u201d (1922:\n100[116]; see also 1917: 122\u2013123[117]). Importantly, motivation is\nessentially an egoic activity, whereas psychic causality\nworks on the pre-egoic level of \u201cpure passivity\u201d (1922:\n35[39]). As Stein aptly puts it: \n\n\nThe \u201cfulcrum\u201d by which motives are put into play is always\nthe I. It performs one act, because it has performed another.\n(1922: 36[41]) \n\n\nOn the one hand, there is a \u201cradical\u201d,\n\u201cunbridgeable\u201d difference between motives and causes\n(1922: 41[47]), as we don\u2019t find any motives in non-biological\nphysical nature; on the other hand, the life of the psyche is infused\nwith various causal processes, and psychic causality and motivation\nvariously intersect. Stein elaborates this \u201cintermeshing of\ncausality and motivation\u201d on the level of sensate and spiritual\nlife-power, and in the perceptual, affective, sensual, and volition\ndomain (1922: 64\u201380[74\u201392]; see also 1917:\n66\u201368[49\u201351]). In order to see this, consider\nStein\u2019s intriguing thought-experiment of a purely spiritual\nbeing, lacking a \u201clife-sphere\u201d: a being moved only by\n\u201cintellectual motives\u201d would be not so much inconceivable\nas literally driveless (1922: 75[87]). It might still grasp certain\nvalues in emotions (see below,\n sect. 2.2)\n and these might rationally motivate further evaluative or emotive\nacts; but ultimately such a being would not have the necessary\ninitiative required to enact those motives or act upon those values.\nMoreover, normally we have distinct, often conflicting, motives, which\nare intermeshed with a sedimented history of evaluative reactions to\nthem. A purely spiritual being could not integrate those motives so as\nto arrive at any conclusive decision and would ultimately lack\nagency.\n\nTo summarize, we can best understand Stein\u2019s theory of\nautonomous personal agency, and indeed her overall analysis of\npersons, if we appreciate one of the leitmotifs running through her\nwhole early phenomenological work: the view that experiences can be\nmore or less \u201cclose\u201d to their very anchoring, namely their\negoic or personal core. The idea is that experiential states of\nwhatever sort (including beliefs, emotions, volitions, cognitive\nstates, etc.) can impact the self. In turn, their initiation\nand their course are impacted more or less by egoic activity,\ndepending on how much spontaneous engagement and control the I exerts,\nor is able to exert, on them (see\n sect. 2.2).\n",
