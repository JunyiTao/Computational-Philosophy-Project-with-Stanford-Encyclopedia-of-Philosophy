Information-Theoretic Accounts of Measurement\n\nInformation-theoretic accounts of measurement are based on an analogy\nbetween measuring systems and communication systems. In a simple\ncommunication system, a message (input) is encoded into a signal at\nthe transmitter\u2019s end, sent to the receiver\u2019s end, and\nthen decoded back (output). The accuracy of the transmission depends\non features of the communication system as well as on features of the\nenvironment, i.e., the level of background noise. Similarly, measuring\ninstruments can be thought of as \u201cinformation machines\u201d\n(Finkelstein 1977) that interact with an object in a given state\n(input), encode that state into an internal signal, and convert that\nsignal into a reading (output). The accuracy of a measurement\nsimilarly depends on the instrument as well as on the level of noise\nin its environment. Conceived as a special sort of information\ntransmission, measurement becomes analyzable in terms of the\nconceptual apparatus of information theory (Hartley 1928; Shannon\n1948; Shannon and Weaver 1949). For example, the information that\nreading \\(y_i\\) conveys about the occurrence of a state \\(x_k\\) of the\nobject can be quantified as \\(\\log \\left[\\frac{p(x_k \\mid\ny_i)}{p(x_k)}\\right]\\), namely as a function of the decrease of\nuncertainty about the object\u2019s state (Finkelstein 1975: 222; for\nalternative formulations see Brillouin 1962: Ch. 15; Kirpatovskii\n1974; and Mari 1999: 185).\n\nLudwik Finkelstein (1975, 1977) and Luca Mari (1999) suggested the\npossibility of a synthesis between Shannon-Weaver information theory\nand measurement theory. As they argue, both theories centrally appeal\nto the idea of mapping: information theory concerns the mapping\nbetween symbols in the input and output messages, while measurement\ntheory concerns the mapping between objects and numbers. If\nmeasurement is taken to be analogous to symbol-manipulation, then\nShannon-Weaver theory could provide a formalization of the syntax of\nmeasurement while measurement theory could provide a formalization of\nits semantics. Nonetheless, Mari (1999: 185) also warns that the\nanalogy between communication and measurement systems is limited.\nWhereas a sender\u2019s message can be known with arbitrary precision\nindependently of its transmission, the state of an object cannot be\nknown with arbitrary precision independently of its measurement.\n\nInformation-theoretic accounts of measurement were originally\ndeveloped by metrologists \u2014 experts in physical measurement and\nstandardization \u2014 with little involvement from philosophers.\nIndependently of developments in metrology, Bas van Fraassen (2008:\n141\u2013185) has recently proposed a conception of measurement in\nwhich information plays a key role. He views measurement as composed\nof two levels: on the physical level, the measuring apparatus\ninteracts with an object and produces a reading, e.g., a pointer\n position.[16]\n On the abstract level, background theory represents the\nobject\u2019s possible states on a parameter space. Measurement\nlocates an object on a sub-region of this abstract parameter space,\nthereby reducing the range of possible states (2008: 164 and 172).\nThis reduction of possibilities amounts to the collection of\ninformation about the measured object. Van Fraassen\u2019s analysis\nof measurement differs from information-theoretic accounts developed\nin metrology in its explicit appeal to background theory, and in the\nfact that it does not invoke the symbolic conception of information\ndeveloped by Shannon and Weaver.\n",
