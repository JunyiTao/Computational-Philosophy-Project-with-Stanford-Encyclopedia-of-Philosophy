    "main_text": "How to Atone || Moral Reformation and Transformation\n2.4 Moral Reformation and Transformation\n\nAs noted above, repentance entails a resolution to amend one\u2019s\nways regarding the wrong action in view. This implies more than just\nresolving to never again do that kind of wrong action to that person\nin those kinds of circumstances. One must resolve against performing\nwrong actions of a more general sort. My resolving not to lie to you\nabout using our money to make spontaneous personal purchases is not\nenough. I must resolve not to lie about how I use money more\ngenerally, and I must resolve not to lie to anyone (or maybe anyone\nwho has a significant interest in knowing about my money usage). To\ncarry out this resolution, I must also examine why I am inclined to\nlie about how I use money and then begin to transform my motivations\nand how I respond to them. And I must do all of this not just because\nI do not want to be caught, or to get you off my case, but because I\nsee how lying about how I use money wrongs you and others. In short,\nrepentance requires that I resolve to be morally reformed or\ntransformed.\n\nSince a resolution to reform (as I shall here abbreviate it) is a part\nof repentance and repentance atones, resolutions to reform contribute\nto atonement. But both the resolution to reform and the reform itself\nalso atone separate from being a necessary ingredient of repentance.\nReform regarding the wrong action in view constitutes moral respect\nfor the victim. It demonstrates that the wrongdoer has taken seriously\nhis wronging of the victim and repudiates that wronging by\ntransforming his life so that he will not (or he is less likely to)\nwrong the victim or others in this sort of way again. Reform also, for\nsimilar reasons, can serve to withdraw the insult of the victim.\nReform also enables reconciliation. Part of what blocks reconciliation\nis the victim\u2019s fear of being wronged again. Since reform atones\nin these ways, and resolving to reform puts one on the path to reform\n(and can itself partially withdraw insult and reduce fear of future\nwrong), resolving to reform also atones.\n\nExperience shows that moral reformation and transformation often\nrequires struggle and time, and we often fall short of the change we\ndesire. Perhaps in part for this reason, in many cases we seem not to\nrequire moral transformation in order to reconcile with someone who\nhas wronged us. When the harm isn\u2019t very great, when the threat\nof future harm from the wrongdoer isn\u2019t very great (or when we\ncan easily be more vigilant to prevent or avoid the harm), and when we\nknow that ordinary human limitations and temptations explain the\nwrong, in practice we seem content to reconcile even if the wrongdoer\nhasn\u2019t morally reformed and even may be unlikely to reform.\nGenuine repentance displayed to us is often sufficient. Coming to\nrepent can itself be a difficult journey for many people; sometimes it\nmay be the best we can hope for from a wrongdoer, and sufficient to\nreconcile some sort of relationship.\n",
