    "main_text": "Non-individuality and self-identity\n5. Non-individuality and self-identity\n\n\nLet us recall Weyl\u2019s statement that one can\u2019t ask alibis\nof electrons.  Dalla Chiara and Toraldo di Francia refer to quantum\nphysics as \u2018the land of anonymity\u2019, in the sense that, on\nthis view, the objects cannot be uniquely labelled (1993 and 1995). They ask,\nthen, how can we talk about what happens in such a land? Their\nsuggestion is that quantum objects can be regarded as\n\u2018intensional-like entities\u2019, where the intensions are\nrepresented by conjunctions of intrinsic properties. The extension of\nthe natural kind, \u2018electron\u2019, say, is then given by the\ncollection of indistinguishable elements, or a\n\u2018quaset\u2019. The theory of such quasets then gives the possibility of a\nsemantics for quantum objects without alibis (ibid.).\n\n\nAlternatively, but relatedly, non-individuality can be understood in\nterms of the denial of self-identity. This suggestion can be found most\nprominently in the philosophical reflections of Born,\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Hesse and Post (Born 1943; Schr\u00f6dinger 1952;\nHesse 1963; Post 1963). It is immediately and clearly problematic,\nhowever: how can we have objects that are not identical to themselves? Such\nself-identity seems bound up with the very notion of objecthood in the\nsense that it is an essential part of what it is to be that object (thus it has been suggested that non-individuality might be better understood in terms of the loss of patio-temporal trajectories in quantum physics; see Arenhart, Bueno and Krause 2019). This\nintuition is summed up in the Quinean slogan, \u2018no entity without\nidentity\u2019 (Quine 1969), with all its attendant consequences\nregarding reference etc.\n\n\nHowever, Barcan Marcus has offered an alternative perspective,\ninsisting on \u2018No identity without entity.\u2019 (Marcus 1993)\nand arguing that although \u2018\u2026 all terms may\n\u201crefer\u201d to objects\u2026 not all objects are things,\nwhere a thing is at least that about which it is appropriate to assert\nthe identity relation.\u2019 (ibid., p. 25) Object-reference\nthen becomes a wider notion than thing-reference. Within such a\nframework, we can then begin to get a formal grip on the notion of\nobjects which are not self-identical through so-called\n\u2018Schr\u00f6dinger logics\u2019, introduced by da Costa (da\nCosta and Krause 1994) These are many-sorted logics in which the\nexpression x = y is not a well-formed formula in\ngeneral; it is where x and y are one sort of term, but\nnot for the other sort corresponding to quantum objects. A semantics\nfor such logics can be given in terms of \u2018quasi-sets\u2019 (da\nCosta and Krause 1997). The motivation behind such developments is the\nidea that collections of quantum objects cannot be considered as sets\nin the usual Cantorian sense of \u2018\u2026 collections into a\nwhole of definite, distinct objects of our intuition or of our\nthought.\u2019 (Cantor 1955, p. 85). Quasi-set theory incorporates\ntwo kinds of basic posits or \u2018Urelemente\u2019: m-atoms, whose\nintended interpretation are the quantal objects and M-atoms, which\nstand for the \u2018everyday\u2019 objects, and which fall within\nthe remit of classical set theory with Ur-elements. Quasi-sets are\nthen the collections obtained by applying the usual Zermelo-Fraenkel\nframework plus Ur-element ZFU-like axioms to a basic domain composed\nof m-atoms, M-atoms and aggregates of them (Krause 1992; for a\ncomparison of qua-set theory with quasi-set theory, see Dalla Chiara,\nGiuntini and Krause 1998).\n\n\nThese developments supply the beginnings of a categorial framework for\nquantum \u2018non- individuality\u2019 which, it is claimed, helps\nto articulate this notion and, bluntly, make it philosophically\nrespectable (extensive details are given in French and Krause 2006;\nsee also Arenhart 2012; Domenach and Holik 2007; Domenach, Holik and\nKrause, 2008; Krause 2010). Crucially, within\nthis formal framework, a sense of countability is retained in that\ncollections of quantum entities possess a (kind of) cardinality but\nnot an ordinality, so we can, in effect, say how many objects there\nare, even though we cannot place them in numerical order.  Critical\ndiscussions of both these formal details and of the basis for\nattributing \u2018non-individuality\u2019 to quantum objects can be\nfound in Bueno et. al. 2011 and Sant\u2019 Anna 2019. Much of this criticism has proceeded on\nthe basis of insisting that we do not need to adopt such an apparently\nradical approach. Thus advocates of \u2018weak discernibility\u2019, discussed\nabove, have argued that this notion yields an appropriately naturalist sense\nof individuality, suitable for quantum physics, whereas Dorato and\nMorganti (2013) insist, as already noted, that one can retain\ncountability, and individuality, as primitive notions and that this is\nto be preferred over any shift to non-individuality (for a response to\nthe latter and defence of the above formal framework, see Arenhart and\nKrause 2014). Jantzen on the other hand, has argued that identity and cardinality are tied together as a \u2018matter of meaning\u2019 rather than metaphysics and that, consequently, talk of entities without identity is either meaningless or, in fact, talk about something else altogether (Jantzen 2019). Likewise Bueno has insisted that identity is too fundamental to be given up so readily and suggests that we can infer\nthe non-individuality of quantum particles directly from their\nindistinguishability with identity itself understood as a \u2018useful idealization\u2019 that simplifies our conceptual framework and allows us to predict the behaviour of the relevant objects \u2013 in this case quantal entities (Bueno 2014; for responses see Arenhart 2017a and Krause and Arenhart 2019). \n\nBoth the framework of quasi-set theory and the underlying metaphysics\nhave been extended into the foundations of Quantum Field Theory, where\nit has been argued, one has non-individual \u2018quanta\u2019\n(Teller 1995). A form of quasi-set theory may provide one way of\nformally capturing this notion (French and Krause 2006; for concerns about such a move see Sant\u2019 Anna 2019). It has also\nbeen suggested that this offers a way of understanding the sense in\nwhich quantum objects may be regarded as vague (French and Krause\n2003), although it has been questioned whether vagueness is the\nappropriate notion here (Darby 2010) and also whether quasi-set theory\noffers the most perspicuous way of capturing this sense (Smith\n2008).  Finally, for those who are leery of quasi-sets and their attendant formal apparatus, there is also the option of returning to Weyl\u2019s original insight, which underpins the quote above, and appropriating his idea of an \u2018aggregate\u2019. If this is interpreted non-set-theoretically as an equivalence relation, where the relevant elements are understood as simply objects that have certain properties in common, one can continue to maintain that such objects do not have well-defined identity conditions (Bueno 2019). Indeed, there may be a variety of such frameworks, both formal and metaphysical, in terms of which non-individuality may be understood (Arenhart 2017b). \n",
