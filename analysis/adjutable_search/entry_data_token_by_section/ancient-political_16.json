    "main_text": "Hellenistic Philosophies and Politics || Persisting and New Schools\n5.1 Persisting and New Schools\n\nIn addition to the major movements of Epicureanism and Stoicism\ntreated separately below, other schools also persisted and arose in\nthis period. Those persisting included the Platonic Academy\n(transformed in a skeptical direction) and the Aristotelian Lyceum\n(the Peripatetic School). Newcomers, albeit tracing themselves to\ntheir own understanding of the figure of Socrates, included the Cynics\nand the Pyrrhonist skeptics, and we focus on these latter two\nhere.\n\nThe Cynics took their name from the Greek for \u201cdog,\u201d\nreferring to the animal-like life indifferent to social conventions\nwhich they pursued, carrying out all their bodily functions in full\npublic view. While this generally led them to advocate what might be\nconsidered more an anti-politics than a politics, a provocative\nstatement by their founder Diogenes of Sinope (c.404\u2013323 BCE)\n\u2013 answering a query about his birthplace by asserting himself to\nbe a \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, VI. 63)\n\u2013 would resonate with later Stoics and others developing a\npolitical philosophy that has become known as cosmopolitanism (see the\nentry on\n cosmopolitanism).\n Diogenes\u2019 indifference to political power was also reflected in\nhis reported reply to the visiting world-conqueror Alexander the\nGreat, asking him to request a boon: all the Cynic wanted was for the\nemperor to step out of his light (Diogenes Laertius, VI. 38). In a\nlineage stretching from Diogenes to his follower Crates, who became\nthe teacher of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, we can see the\nCynic-Stoic kinship especially in the early Stoics\u2019 rejection of\nmany conventional political and moral opinions. Yet the Cynics also\nmanifested some parallels with the Epicureans and even with the\nskeptics.\n\nOne branch of ancient skepticism had its roots in Plato\u2019s\nAcademy, which from the time of Arcesilaus\u2019 headship in the\nmid-260s BCE turned in a skeptical direction, arguing that there was\nno clear criterion of truth and so philosophers can only suspend\njudgment. While that was an \u201cAcademic\u201d position within\nphilosophical debate, a possible forebear (Pyrrho) had in the fourth\ncentury BCE putatively demonstrated the tranquility of mind which such\na position could bring, by living a life seemingly without any\ninvestment in the truth of his beliefs (though the question of how,\nand how far, Pyrrho was guided by appearances would perplex later\nfollowers). (See the entry on\n Pyrrho.)\n From the first century BCE, a radical movement of\n\u201cPyrrhonist\u201d skepticism was developed outside the Academy\nby Aenesidemus, followed about a century later by Agrippa, in a\nmovement summed up for posterity in the second-century CE work of\nSextus Empiricius (Outlines of Pyrrhonism) which would have a\nconsiderable influence on early modern philosophy. Meanwhile the\nmilder \u201cAcademic\u201d skepticism, allowing the inquirer to\nincline to one side or another though not to invest in full belief,\nhad significant influence on first-century BCE figures such as Cicero.\n(See the entry on\n ancient skepticism.)\n",
