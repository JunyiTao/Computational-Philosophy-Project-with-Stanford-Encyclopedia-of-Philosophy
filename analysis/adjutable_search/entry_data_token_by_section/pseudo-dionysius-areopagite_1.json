Reading Dionysius\u2019 Works\n\nReading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons: partly\nbecause his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign to our\nown English-speaking practices; partly because almost every word he\nemploys resonates with the whole history of ancient thought, from the\nChristian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly, Gregory of Nyssa and\nthe Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, Iamblichus, and\nProclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon the Jewish and\nChristian scriptures (which Dionysius calls \u201cdivine\noracles\u201d); partly, again, because the order in which we are to\nread his works is unclear and because Dionysius mentions at least\nseven works that have been lost. So we are unsure how to read him\nsince so much seems doubtful or potentially fictitious. This picture\nis further complicated by the titles subdividing portions of his\nworks, which appear, because of terminology peculiar to them, to have\nbeen inserted by a later hand or hands.\n\nThe surviving writings are four treatises and ten letters. The four\ntreatises are: 1) On the divine names (DN) (Peri\ntheion onomaton, in Greek; De Divinis Nominibus, in\nLatin), the longest work of thirteen chapters that deals with\naffirmative or kataphatic theology, namely, the names attributed to\nGod the creator in scripture and also in pagan texts, but also\nexploring the limits of language and therefore also involving negative\nor apophatic theology. 2) On the celestial hierarchy\n(CH) (Peri tes ouranias hierarchias, in Greek;\nDe coelesti hierarchia, in Latin), a work that examines how\nthe nine choirs of angels (in scripture) are to be understood in\nlifting us up to God. 3) On the ecclesiastical hierarchy\n(EH) (Peri tes ekklestiastikes hierarchias, in\nGreek; De ecclesiastica hierarchia, in Latin) that examines\nthe various orders and liturgy of the church as relating us to God\nthrough a divinely appointed but human hierarchy. And 4) On\nMystical theology (MT) (Peri mustikes\ntheologias, in Greek; De mystica theologia, in Latin), a\nbrief but powerful work that deals with negative or apophatic theology\nand in which theology becomes explicitly \u201cmystical\u201d for\nthe first time in history (By mystical here we do not mean an\nextraordinary or private experience of transcending one\u2019s self\nin the modern sense of the term, but simply \u201chidden\u201d. On\nthis see Bouyer, 1949; Vanneste, 1959; McGinn 1994). There follow ten\nletters that provide helpful comments upon topics in the above four\ntreatises, especially letter 9 on what Dionysius calls symbolic\ntheology of which works 2) and 3) above (CH; EH)\nform a substantial part. The ten letters appear to be arranged in a\nroughly hierarchical order, letters 1\u20134 being addressed to a\nmonk (a certain Gaius, also the name of one or more of St.\nPaul\u2019s companions), letter 5 to a deacon, letter 6 to a priest,\nand letters 7 and 9 to hierarchs or bishops. Letter 8 disrupts this\norder since it is addressed to a monk charged with disrupting the\nhierarchical order itself!\n\nWhat order of the works are we to adopt? In the French translation of\nM. de Gandillac and the English translation of C. Luibheid and P.\nRorem (see bibliography), the order is DN, MT,\nCH and EH. In the manuscripts of the Areopagitic\ncorpus, the order is CH, EH, DN,\nMT, followed by the Letters. Dionysius himself provides an\nexplanatory outline that favors the order of Luibheid and Rorem, and\nthat gives a systematic organization to his body of work, including\nboth the treatises we presently possess and also the treatises which\neither no longer exist or, more likely, were never written. His\noutline is especially valuable for two of these latter\ntreatises\u2014the Theological Representations and the\nSymbolic Theology\u2014since the order in which he claims to\nhave written them reveals both the relative worth of their contents\nand the sequence in which the reader should proceed. It thus helps the\nreader to divine the nature of their content, and to put them in their\nproper place with the remaining two works written by Dionysius on the\nforms of theology. The first three\u2014the Theological\nRepresentations, On the Divine Names, and the\nSymbolic Theology\u2014discuss ever more divided and\nsensuous forms of theology. The fourth theological work, the\nMystical Theology, reverses the sequence and restores the\nreader to the divine unity:\n\nIn the earlier books my argument traveled downward from the most\nexalted to the humblest categories, taking in on this downward path an\never-increasing number of ideas which multiplied with every stage of\nthe descent. But my argument now rises from what is below up to the\ntranscendent, and the more it climbs, the more language falters, and\nwhen it has passed up and beyond the ascent, it will turn silent\ncompletely, since it will finally be at one with him who is\nundescribable (MT 1033 C).\n\n\nIn this article we shall adopt a variant of this last order both\nbecause Dionysius himself seems to have favored it and because it\nclarifies the systematic structure of the theological works. \n",
