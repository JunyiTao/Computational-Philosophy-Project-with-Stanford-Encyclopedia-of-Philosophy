The Three Truths: Emptiness, Provisional Positing and the Center (\u7a7a\u5047\u4e2d kong, jia, zhong)\n\nThese analogies, homely and somewhat goofy as they are, may\nstart to give some sense of the intuitions that\nundergird Tiantai\u2019s architectonic philosophical system,\nwhich may help orient us as we move into the actual technical\narguments and commitments developed there. This is especially\nimportant in the Tiantai case, as the conclusions to which its\ntheoretical edifice lead will initialy strike many if not\nmost readers as wildly outlandish and counterintuitive; some attention\nto these everyday experiences\u2014coming upon something in the\nworld, having some tentative grasp of what it is but with a built-in\nincompletion clause pointed toward the future, finding out more about\nit, reinterpreting and recalibrating our understanding\naccordingly, adjusting our foregroundings and backgroundings, and\nso on\u2014may help to spur some reflections on the\nconcepts normally brought to bear in interpreting\nthese experiences. It also helps us understand the Tiantai\nclaim that its most shocking stipuations are nothing special, not\nthe bizarro-world privileges of some remote ontological plane,\nbut are rather inescapable entailments of everyday experience of\nall sentient beings\u2014for this process of things appearing one way and\nturning out another is almost a definition of \u201cexperience\u201d as\nsuch. Nevertheless, analogies are never perfect,\nalways partially mirroring the structure they are intended to\nexplicate but never doing so completely, and we must not\nallow the attractive accessibility of such examples to mislead us\ninto resting content with only a loose sense of the logical\nentailments of this sort of thinking. For a more rigorous grasp\nof the reasoning on which so many of\nthe outrageous epistemological, ontological and\nsoteriological claims of this school rest, we must approach the\nmeaning of \u201cneither-same-nor-different\u201d more systemtaically.\n",
