    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes || Metaphysics\n4.5 Metaphysics\n\nThroughout his commentaries and epitomes, Lef\u00e8vre often briefly\nobserves that the findings of a particular discipline have\nmetaphysical implications, but then leaves this line of thought aside,\ntypically saying \u201cenough about this, at this point\u201d\n(de hac adhuc satis est). These implications are meant to be\ntreated in metaphysics or theology. (Like many Christian philosophers\nafter Boethius, Lef\u00e8vre often identifies theology and\nmetaphysics; Oosterhoff 2019a.) In this sense, then, Lef\u00e8vre\nbelongs to a natural theological tradition which sees the\nphilosophical arts as studying the traces of the divine in the natural\nworld, and then as steps leading upward to divine matters, as he put\nit in his side-by-side edition of the medieval and humanist\ntranslations of Euclid\u2019s geometry (1517a: a2r).\n\nSuch a reconstructive project could especially be open to creative,\nsynthetic impulses. Rice (1970) brilliantly captured\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s project by suggesting that what Ficino had done\nfor Plato, Lef\u00e8vre intended to do for Aristotle. Drawing on a\nlong-standing medieval topos that Plato was the closest of ancient\nphilosophers to Christian truth, Ficino had interpreted him as broadly\nin line with Christian teaching, all the while drawing on the natural\nphilosophy, medicine, and mathematics of his day to present him as a\nhealer of souls (Celenza 2007: 86). Early in his work on Aristotle,\nLef\u00e8vre similarly presented Aristotle as all things in all\ndisciplines, even theology:\n\n\nin his logical works he was most subtle and rational, in the\nPhysics a worldly philosopher, in the Ethics\nentirely prudent and active, in the Politics a lawyer, and in\nthe Metaphysics a priest and theologian. (Fuit namque in\nlogicis rationalis subtilissimus, in physicis mundanus philosophus, in\nethicis totus prudens et activus, in polyticis iurisconsultus, in\nmetaphysicis sacerdos atque theologus, Letter to Germain de\nGanay, In Aristotelis Ethica Nicomachea introductio, 1494b:\na2r; Rice 1970: 138)\n\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s Aristotle, like Ficino\u2019s Plato, knew\nsomething of the Christian God. In his introduction to the\nMetaphysics (1494a: d1v), he suggested that Aristotle had\nprayed to the ens entium, begging for mercy. This emphasis on\nthe coherence of Aristotle\u2019s works throughout the arts cycle and\nhis agreement with Christianity sustained the scholarship of\nLef\u00e8vre and his students for decades.\n\nIt also meant that Lef\u00e8vre could find in Aristotle the basis\nfor the concord of all knowledge. He thus held together two\npotentially divergent approaches: his editorial efforts to\n\u201cpurify\u201d Aristotle accompanied his efforts to find a pious\nmetaphysical framework for philosophy, including elements that clearly\nbelonged to Neoplatonic traditions. At first, Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s\nencyclopedic projects extended to the Neoplatonic texts revived by\nFicino and Bessarion, among others. In 1494, as mentioned above, he\npublished Ficino\u2019s important translation of the writings\nattributed to Hermes Trismegistus, along with his own short\nargumenta. Around the same time, he published De magia\nnaturali, which drew on Ficino\u2019s medical cosmology in the\nThree Books on Life, as well as Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola\u2019s cabbalistic interests. But by 1505 his optimism\nabout the fruitfulness of this esoteric approach had lessened. As\nPantin (1988) has shown, Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s 1505 edition of the\nHermetic corpus includes, among its additions, more cautions against\nunorthodox readings than the previous edition, just as he would do the\nnext year when recompiling Plato\u2019s Laws and\nRepublic in his Hecatonomiae.\n\nIn 1514 he produced a major edition of Nicholas of Cusa, arguably the\nmost original philosopher of the fifteenth century\u2014and one\ncertainly influenced by Plato. But Lef\u00e8vre had his own take on\nthe history of Platonic philosophy, which allowed him to see Nicholas\nand the twelfth-century Victorines, among others, as representatives\nof a distinctively Christian form of philosophy (Oosterhoff\n2019a and 2019b). He defended a longstanding tradition, particularly\nstrong in France (where Dionysius the Areopagite was regarded not only\nas St Paul\u2019s Athenian convert, but also as the original\nbishop-martyr who had brought Christianity to France). He explained\nthe similarities between Dionysius and late ancient Platonists such as\nIamblichus and Proclus as thefts on the part of the pagan\nphilosophers. To Lef\u00e8vre, Dionysius stood for a Pauline and\nfundamentally Christian form of insight, beyond both positive and\nnegative theology. Later Platonists had drawn on this tradition for\ntheir most profound teachings, while suppressing their source. In his\nedition of Dionsyius\u2019s Divine Names, Lef\u00e8vre\nadduced Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s \u201cscientie divine\nignorantie\u201d (\u201cscience of divine ignorance\u201d) as\na faithful reading of Dionysius, suggesting that Dionysius was the\nsource of Nicholas\u2019s recognition that both positive and negative\nstatements about God fall short, since finite words cannot capture an\ninfinite reality (1499: 58v\u201361r). Therefore, in\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s eyes, Nicholas of Cusa was a modern\nrepresentative of this authentic Christian philosophy (Meier-Oeser\n1989: 36\u201361).\n",
