    "main_text": "Disability and Well-Being\n1. Disability and Well-Being\n\nThe relationship between disability and well-being is important both\ntheoretically and practically. How philosophers, social scientists,\npolicy makers, and lay people understand that relationship matters for\nthe theories of welfare and flourishing we construct, the judgments\nabout our lives we make on a regular basis, and the social and health\npolicies we adopt.\n\nAssumptions about well-being, tacit as well as explicit, pervade our\nthinking about disability. Decisions about abortion after a\n\u201cpositive\u201d prenatal test result are often based on the\nparents\u2019 judgment about the child\u2019s expected quality of\nlife. Decisions about life-sustaining treatment for severely disabled\ninfants and critically ill adults are often made on the same basis,\nalthough what counts now as an acceptable quality of life may differ\nfrom what is considered acceptable when contemplating the futures of\nfetuses and newborns. Judgments of well-being also figure in\nallocation decisions, where scarce resources may be diverted away from\npersons who, because of certain disabilities, are deemed to have poor\nprospects for an acceptable quality of life, and toward persons with\n\u201cbetter\u201d prospects. The examples could be multiplied, and\nthey are not confined to health-related matters.\n\nDisability is often initially encountered as an atypical mental or\nphysical condition whose impact on well-being is mediated by the\nphysical and social environments. For example, an individual is\ndeciding whether to undertake expensive and risky surgery to restore\nfunctioning lost in an accident; a couple is deciding whether to\ncontinue a pregnancy with a fetus diagnosed with a genetically-based\nhealth condition; a legislature is deciding how much money to allocate\nto competing injury-prevention programs. All these decision makers\nfirst confront disability as a biological phenomenon\u2014a sudden or\ngradual loss of functioning; a genetic condition with various health\neffects; a range of vehicular, recreational, household, and workplace\ninjuries. Their concern is with the effect of disability, encountered\nthis way, on lives they care about or are charged with protecting:\ntheir own, their future children\u2019s, or their\nconstituents\u2019.\n\nAs these examples suggest, the fact that\ndisability-related disadvantages often reflect contingent features of the\nsocial environment may have different relevance for different decisions\nand decision makers. Parents deliberating about whether to have a\nchild with a severe disability may need to treat as\n\u201cgiven\u201d the adverse effects on well-being of social stigma\nor inadequate educational resources. It is far less clear that\nlegislators would be justified in treating as \u201cgiven\u201d the\nreduction in well-being associated with these social conditions, given\nthat they are in a position to modify those conditions, by, for\nexample, prioritizing funding for inclusive education.\n",
