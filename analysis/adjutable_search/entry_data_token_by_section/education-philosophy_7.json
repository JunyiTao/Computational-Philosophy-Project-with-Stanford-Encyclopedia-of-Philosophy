    "main_text": "Areas of Contemporary Activity || Philosophical Disputes Concerning Empirical Education Research\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAs stressed earlier, it is impossible to do justice to the whole field of\nphilosophy of education in a single encyclopedia entry. Different\ncountries around the world have their own intellectual traditions and\ntheir own ways of institutionalizing philosophy of education in the\nacademic universe, and no discussion of any of this appears in the\npresent essay. But even in the Anglo-American world there is such a\ndiversity of approaches that any author attempting to produce a\nsynoptic account will quickly run into the borders of his or her\ncompetence. Clearly this has happened in the present case. \n\nFortunately, in the last thirty years or so resources have become\navailable that significantly alleviate these problems. There has been\na flood of encyclopedia entries, both on the field as a whole and also\non many specific topics not well-covered in the present essay (see, as\na sample, Burbules 1994; Chambliss 1996b; Curren 1998, 2018; Phillips\n1985, 2010; Siegel 2007; Smeyers 1994), two\n\u201cEncyclopedias\u201d (Chambliss 1996a; Phillips 2014), a\n\u201cGuide\u201d (Blake, Smeyers, Smith, & Standish 2003), a\n\u201cCompanion\u201d (Curren 2003), two \u201cHandbooks\u201d\n(Siegel 2009; Bailey, Barrow, Carr, & McCarthy 2010), a\ncomprehensive anthology (Curren 2007), a dictionary of key concepts in\nthe field (Winch & Gingell 1999), and a good textbook or two (Carr\n2003; Noddings 2015). In addition there are numerous volumes both of\nreprinted selections and of specially commissioned essays on specific\ntopics, some of which were given short shrift here (for another\nsampling see A. Rorty 1998, Stone 1994), and several international\njournals, including Theory and Research in Education,\nJournal of Philosophy of Education, Educational\nTheory, Studies in Philosophy and Education, and\nEducational Philosophy and Theory. Thus there is more than\nenough material available to keep the interested reader busy.\n",
