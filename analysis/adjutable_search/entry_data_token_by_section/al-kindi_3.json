    "main_text": "Influences on al-Kindi || Contemporary influences\n2.2 Contemporary influences\n\n\nTwo examples of this engagement, to be discussed in more detail in\nthe next section, are al-Kindi\u2019s treatment of divine attributes,\nand his views on creation. As we will see al-Kindi held an austere view\non the question of attributes, on the basis that predication invariably\nimplies multiplicity, whereas God is unrestrictedly one. This has been\ncompared (Ivry 1974, Adamson 2003) to the position of the\nMu\u2018tazilites, who were the main contemporary theologians of the\nninth century. Mu\u2018tazilite influence may also be present in\nal-Kindi\u2019s theory that creation is a \u201cbringing to be of\nbeing from non-being,\u201d and especially in his denial that creation\ncan be eternal. (This may be related to the Mu\u2018tazilite claim\nthat the Koran is created and not eternal; see Adamson 2007, ch.4.)\n\n\nAl-Kindi uses philosophy to defend and explicate Islam in several\nworks. He wrote a short treatise attacking the Christian doctrine of\nthe Trinity, using concepts drawn from the Isagoge of Porphyry\n(al-Kindi\u2019s refutation was the subject of a counter-refutation by\nthe tenth century Christian philosopher, Yahya ibn \u2018Adi; see\nP\u00e9rier 1920). While this is the only extant work that engages in\ntheological controversy, we know from the Fihrist that he\nwrote other treatises on similar themes. The extant corpus also\ncontains passages in which al-Kindi expounds the meaning of passages\nfrom the Koran. Most striking, perhaps, is his discussion of creation\nex nihilo in the midst of On the Quantity of\nAristotle\u2019s Books. This passage is a commentary on Koran\n36: 79\u201382. Al-Kindi mentions the same Koranic passage, and discusses the\nspecial nature of prophetic knowledge, in a meteorological work\nentitled On Why the Higher Atmosphere is Cold (see Abu Rida\n1953, 92\u201393). The cosmological work On the Prostration of the\nOutermost Sphere, meanwhile, is entirely devoted to explaining the\nKoranic verse \u201cthe stars and the trees prostrate\nthemselves\u201d (55: 6) in terms of al-Kindi\u2019s account of\nheavenly influence on the sublunary world. Al-Kindi\u2019s remarks\nhere show his interest in the contemporary disciplines of grammar and\nKoranic exegesis.\n\n\nA desire to integrate Greek ideas into his own culture is shown in a\ndifferent way by On Definitions, a list of technical\nphilosophical terms with definitions (see Abu Rida 1950, 165\u201379;\nalso Allard 1972, Klein-Franke 1982). This work is ascribed to\nal-Kindi, and though its authenticity has been doubted it is almost\ncertainly at least a production of al-Kindi\u2019s circle. Most of the\ndefined terms correspond to Greek technical terms, and thus build up\nan Arabic philosophical terminology which is intended to be equivalent\nto that of the Greeks. It is striking that, so early in the Arabic\nphilosophical tradition, there was already a perceived need for a\nnovel technical language for communicating philosophical ideas in a\ndifferent setting (and of course for translating Greek into\nArabic). Some, though certainly not all, of the terms listed in On\nDefinitions will indeed become standard in the later\nphilosophical tradition.\n",
