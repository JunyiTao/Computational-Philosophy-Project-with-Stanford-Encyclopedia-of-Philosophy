Russell\u2019s Work in Analytic Philosophy\n\nIn much the same way that Russell used logic in an attempt to clarify\nissues in the foundations of mathematics, he also used logic in an\nattempt to clarify issues in philosophy. As one of the founders of\nanalytic philosophy, Russell made significant contributions to a wide\nvariety of areas, including\n metaphysics,\n epistemology,\n ethics\n and political theory. His advances in logic and metaphysics also had\nsignificant influence on Rudolf Carnap and the\n Vienna Circle.\n \n\nAccording to Russell, it is the philosopher\u2019s job to discover a\nlogically ideal language \u2013 a language capable of describing the\nworld in such a way that we will not be misled by the accidental,\nimprecise surface structure of natural language. As Russell writes,\n\u201cOrdinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what\nphysics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not\nsufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say\nas little as the physicist means to say\u201d (1931, 82). Just as\natomic facts (the association of properties and relations with\nindividuals) combine to form molecular facts in the world itself, such\na language will allow for the description of such combinations using\nlogical connectives such as \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d In\naddition to the existence of atomic and molecular facts, Russell also\nheld that general facts (facts about \u201call\u201d of something)\nare needed to complete our picture of the world. Famously, he\nvacillated on whether negative facts are also required (1918, 1919).\n\n\nThe reason Russell believes many ordinarily accepted statements are\nopen to doubt is that they appear to refer to entities that may be\nknown only through inference. Thus, underlying Russell\u2019s various\nprojects was not only his use of logical analysis, but also his\nlong-standing aim of discovering whether, and to what extent,\nknowledge is possible. \u201cThere is one great question,\u201d he\nwrites in 1911. \u201cCan human beings know anything, and if\nso, what and how? This question is really the most essentially\nphilosophical of all questions\u201d (quoted in Slater 1994, 67).\n\nMotivating this question was the traditional problem of the external\nworld. If our knowledge of the external world comes through inferences\nto the best explanation, and if such inferences are always fallible,\nwhat guarantee do we have that our beliefs are true?\nRussell\u2019s response to this question was partly metaphysical and\npartly epistemological. On the metaphysical side, Russell developed\nhis famous theory of\n logical atomism,\n in which the world is said to consist of a complex of logical atoms\n(such as \u201clittle patches of colour\u201d) and their properties\nand relations. (The theory was crucial for influencing\n Wittgenstein\u2019s theory\n of the same name.) Together these atoms and their properties form the\nfacts which, in turn, combine to form logically complex objects. What\nwe normally take to be inferred entities (for example, enduring\nphysical objects) are then understood as\n logical constructions\n formed from the immediately given entities of sensation, viz.,\n\u201csensibilia.\u201d\n\nOn the epistemological side, Russell argues that it is also important\nto show how each questionable entity may be reduced to, or defined in\nterms of, another entity (or entities) whose existence is more\ncertain. For example, on this view, an ordinary physical object that\nnormally might be thought to be known only through inference may be\ndefined instead \n\nas a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by\ncontinuity and by certain causal laws. \u2026 More generally, a\n\u2018thing\u2019 will be defined as a certain series of aspects,\nnamely those which would commonly be said to be of the thing.\nTo say that a certain aspect is an aspect of a certain thing\nwill merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially,\nare the thing. (1914a, 106\u2013107)\n\n\nThe reason we are able to do this, says Russell, is that \n\nour world is not wholly a matter of inference. There are things that\nwe know without asking the opinion of men of science. If you are too\nhot or too cold, you can be perfectly aware of this fact without\nasking the physicist what heat and cold consist of. \u2026 We may\ngive the name \u2018data\u2019 to all the things of which we are\naware without inference. (1959, 23)\n\n\nWe can then use these data (or \u201csensibilia\u201d or\n \u201csense data\u201d)\n with which we are directly acquainted to construct the relevant\nobjects of knowledge. Similarly, numbers may be reduced to collections\nof classes; points and instants may be reduced to ordered classes of\nvolumes and events; and classes themselves may be reduced to\npropositional functions. \n\nIt is with these kinds of examples in mind that Russell suggests we\nadopt what he calls \u201cthe supreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophizing,\u201d namely the principle that \u201cWhenever\npossible, logical constructions,\u201d or as he also sometimes puts\nit, \u201clogical fictions,\u201d are \u201cto be substituted for\ninferred entities\u201d (1914c, 155; cf. 1914a, 107, and 1924, 326).\nAnything that resists construction in this sense may be said to be an\nontological atom. Such objects are atomic, both in the sense that they\nfail to be composed of individual, substantial parts, and in the sense\nthat they exist independently of one another. Their corresponding\npropositions are also atomic, both in the sense that they contain no\nother propositions as parts, and in the sense that the members of any\npair of true atomic propositions will be logically independent of one\nanother. Russell believes that formal logic, if carefully developed,\nwill mirror precisely, not only the various relations between all such\npropositions, but their various internal structures as well. \n\nIt is in this context that Russell also introduces his famous\ndistinction between two kinds of knowledge of truths: that which is\ndirect, intuitive, certain and infallible, and that which is indirect,\nderivative, uncertain and open to error (1905, 41f; 1911, 1912, and\n1914b). To be justified, every indirect knowledge claim must be\ncapable of being derived from more fundamental, direct or intuitive\nknowledge claims. The kinds of truths that are capable of being known\ndirectly include truths about immediate facts of sensation and truths\nof logic. Examples are discussed in The Problems of\nPhilosophy (1912a) where Russell states that propositions with\nthe highest degree of self-evidence (what he here calls\n\u201cintuitive knowledge\u201d) include \u201cthose which merely\nstate what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and\narithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical\npropositions\u201d (1912a, 109).\n\nEventually, Russell supplemented this distinction between direct and\nindirect knowledge of truths with his equally famous distinction\nbetween knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. As\nRussell explains, \u201cI say that I am acquainted with an object\nwhen I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am\ndirectly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive\nrelation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\njudgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation\u201d (1911,\n209). Later, he clarifies this point by adding that acquaintance\ninvolves, not knowledge of truths, but knowledge of things (1912a,\n44). Thus, while intuitive knowledge and derivative knowledge both\ninvolve knowledge of propositions (or truths), knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description both involve knowledge of\nthings (or objects). This distinction is slightly complicated by the\nfact that, even though knowledge by description is in part based upon\nknowledge of truths, it is still knowledge of things, and not of\ntruths. (I am grateful to Russell Wahl for reminding me of this\npoint.) Since it is things with which we have direct acquaintance that\nare the least questionable members of our ontology, it is these\nobjects upon which Russell ultimately bases his epistemology.\n\nAlso relevant was Russell\u2019s reliance upon his so-called\nregressive method (Irvine 1989, Mayo-Wilson 2011) and his eventual\nabandoning of foundationalism in favour of a more recognizably\ncoherentist approach to knowledge (Irvine 2004). As Russell puts it,\neven in logic and mathematics\n\nWe tend to believe the premises because we can see that their\nconsequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because\nwe know the premises to be true. But the inferring of premises from\nconsequences is the essence of induction; thus the method in\ninvestigating the principles of mathematics is really an inductive\nmethod, and is substantially the same as the method of discovering\ngeneral laws in any other science. (1907, 273\u2013274)\n\n\nRussell\u2019s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology are also\nunified by his views concerning the centrality of scientific\nknowledge and the importance of there being an underlying methodology\ncommon to philosophy and science. In the case of philosophy, this\nmethodology expresses itself through Russell\u2019s use of logical\nanalysis (Hager 1994, Irvine 2004). In fact, Russell often claims that\nhe has more confidence in his methodology than in any particular\nphilosophical conclusion.\n\nThis broad conception of philosophy arose in part from Russell\u2019s\nidealist origins (Hylton 1990a, Griffin 1991). This is so, even though\nRussell tells us that his one, true revolution in philosophy came as a\nresult of his break from idealism. Russell saw that the idealist\ndoctrine of internal relations led to a series of contradictions\nregarding asymmetrical (and other) relations necessary for\nmathematics. As he reports, \n\nIt was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both\nKant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his\nfootsteps. \u2026 [Our rebellion centred upon] the doctrine that\nfact is in general independent of experience. Although we were in\nagreement, I think that we differed as to what most interested us in\nour new philosophy. I think that Moore was most concerned with the\nrejection of idealism, while I was most interested in the rejection of\nmonism. (1959, 54)\n\n\nThe two ideas were closely connected through the so-called doctrine of\ninternal relations. In contrast to this doctrine, Russell proposed his\nown new doctrine of external relations: \n\nThe doctrine of internal relations held that every relation between\ntwo terms expresses, primarily, intrinsic properties of the two terms\nand, in ultimate analysis, a property of the whole which the two\ncompose. With some relations this view is plausible. Take, for\nexample, love or hate. If A loves B, this relation exemplifies itself\nand may be said to consist in certain states of mind of A. Even an\natheist must admit that a man can love God. It follows that love of\nGod is a state of the man who feels it, and not properly a relational\nfact. But the relations that interested me were of a more abstract\nsort. Suppose that A and B are events, and A is earlier than B. I do\nnot think that this implies anything in A in virtue of which,\nindependently of B, it must have a character which we inaccurately\nexpress by mentioning B. Leibniz gives an extreme example. He says\nthat, if a man living in Europe has a wife in India and the wife dies\nwithout his knowing it, the man undergoes an intrinsic change at the\nmoment of her death. (1959, 54)\n\n\nThis is the type of doctrine Russell opposed, especially with respect\nto the asymmetrical relations necessary for mathematics. For example,\nconsider two numbers, one of which is found earlier than the other in\na given series: \n\nIf A is earlier than B, then B is not earlier than A. If you try to\nexpress the relation of A to B by means of adjectives of A and B, you\nwill have to make the attempt by means of dates. You may say that the\ndate of A is a property of A and the date of B is a property of B, but\nthat will not help you because you will have to go on to say that the\ndate of A is earlier than the date of B, so that you will have found\nno escape from the relation. If you adopt the plan of regarding the\nrelation as a property of the whole composed of A and B, you are in a\nstill worse predicament, for in that whole A and B have no order and\ntherefore you cannot distinguish between \u201cA is earlier than\nB\u201d and \u201cB is earlier than A.\u201d As asymmetrical\nrelations are essential in most parts of mathematics, this doctrine\nwas important. (1959, 54\u201355)\n\n\nThus, by the end of 1898 Russell had abandoned the idealism that he\nhad been encouraged to adopt as a student at Cambridge, along with his\noriginal Kantian methodology. In its place he adopted a new,\npluralistic\n realism.\n As a result, he soon became famous as an advocate of \u201cthe new\nrealism\u201d and of his \u201cnew philosophy of logic,\u201d\nemphasizing as he did the importance of modern logic for philosophical\nanalysis. The underlying themes of this revolution included\nRussell\u2019s belief in pluralism, his emphasis on anti-psychologism\nand his belief in the importance of science. Each of these themes\nremained central to his philosophy for the remainder of his life\n(Hager 1994, Weitz 1944).\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to these topics\ninclude Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription (1911), The Problems of Philosophy (1912a),\n\u201cOur Knowledge of the External World\u201d (1914a), On the\nNature of Acquaintance (1914b, published more completely in\nCollected Papers, Vol. 7), \u201cThe Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d (1918, 1919), \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d (1924),\nThe Analysis of Mind (1921), The Analysis of Matter\n(1927a), Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948), and\nTheory of Knowledge (CP, Vol. 7).\n",
