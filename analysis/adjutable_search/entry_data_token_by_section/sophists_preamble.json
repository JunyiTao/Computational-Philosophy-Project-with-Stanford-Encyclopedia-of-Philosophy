    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe Greek word sophist\u0113s, formed from the\nnoun sophia, \u2018wisdom\u2019 or \u2018learning\u2019,\nhas the general sense \u2018one who exercises wisdom or\nlearning\u2019. As sophia could designate specific types of\nexpertise as well as general sagacity in the conduct of life and the\nhigher kinds of insight associated with seers and poets, the word\noriginally meant \u2018sage\u2019 or \u2018expert\u2019. In the\ncourse of the fifth century BCE the term, while retaining its original\nunspecific sense, came in addition to be applied specifically to a new\ntype of intellectuals, professional educators who toured the Greek\nworld offering instruction in a wide range of subjects, with particular\nemphasis on skill in public speaking and the successful conduct of\nlife. The emergence of this new profession, which was an extension to\nnew areas of the tradition of the itinerant rhapsode (reciter of poems,\nespecially of Homer), was a response to various social, economic,\npolitical and cultural developments of the period. The increasing\nwealth and intellectual sophistication of Greek cities, especially\nAthens, created a demand for higher education beyond the traditional\nbasic grounding in literacy, arithmetic, music and physical training.\nTo some extent this involved the popularization of Ionian speculation\nabout the physical world (see Presocratic Philosophy), which was\nextended into areas such as history, geography and the origins of\ncivilization. The increase in participatory democracy, especially in\nAthens, led to a demand for success in political and forensic oratory,\nand hence to the development of specialized techniques of persuasion\nand argument. Finally, the period saw the flourishing of a challenging,\nrationalistic climate of thought on questions including those of\nmorality, religion and political conduct, to which the sophists both\nresponded and contributed. It is important to emphasize the\nindividualistic character of the sophistic profession; its\npractitioners belonged to no organization, shared no common body of\nbeliefs and founded no schools, either in the sense of academic\ninstitutions or in that of bodies of individuals committed to the\npromulgation of specific doctrines. In what follows we shall illustrate\nthe diversity of sophistic activities, while considering the extent to\nwhich we can nevertheless identify common themes and attitudes.\n",
