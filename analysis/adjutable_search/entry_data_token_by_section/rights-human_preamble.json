    "main_text": "\n\nHuman rights are norms that aspire to protect all people everywhere\nfrom severe political, legal, and social abuses. Examples of human\nrights are the right to freedom of religion, the right to a fair trial\nwhen charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured, and the right\nto education.\n\nThe philosophy of human rights addresses questions about the\nexistence, content, nature, universality, justification, and legal\nstatus of human rights. The strong claims often made on behalf of\nhuman rights (for example, that they are universal, inalienable, or\nexist independently of legal enactment as justified moral norms) have\nfrequently provoked skeptical doubts and countering philosophical\ndefenses (on these critiques see Lacrois and Pranchere 2016, Mutua\n2008, and Waldron 1988). Reflection on these doubts and the responses\nthat can be made to them has become a sub-field of political and legal\nphilosophy with a very substantial literature (see the\n Bibliography\n below).\n\nThis entry addresses the concept of human rights, the existence and\ngrounds of human rights, the question of which rights are human\nrights, and relativism about human rights.\n",
