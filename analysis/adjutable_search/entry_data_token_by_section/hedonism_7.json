    "main_text": "Ethical Hedonism || Other Arguments Against Ethical Hedonism\n3. Concluding Remarks\n\n\nThe critical discussion of Section 2 above has supplemented the\nSection 1 consideration of psychological hedonism, by examining\narguments both for and against ethical hedonism. On one influential\nview that John Rawls attributes to Henry Sidgwick, justification in\nethics ideally proceeds against \u201cstandards of reasoned\njustification\u2026 carefully formulated\u201d, and\n\u201csatisfactory justification of any particular moral conception\nmust proceed from a full knowledge and systematic comparison of the\nmore significant conceptions in the philosophical tradition\u201d\n(editor's \u2018Foreword\u2019 to Sidgwick). This entry has not\nattempted any such systematic comparative examination of psychological\nhedonism or ethical hedonism against its main rivals.\n\n\nBoth psychological hedonism and ethical hedonism remain worthy of\nserious philosophical attention. Each also has broader philosophical\nsignificance, especially but not only in utilitarian and egoist\ntraditions of ethical thought, and in empiricist and scientific\nnaturalist philosophical traditions.\n",
