    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || Atomism Versus Holism\n3.2 Atomism Versus Holism\n\nAni believes that salmon are fish; not knowing that whales are\nmammals, she also believes that whales are fish. Sanjay, like Ani,\nbelieves that salmon are fish, but he denies that whales are fish. Do\nAni and Sanjay share exactly the same belief about\nsalmon\u2014namely, that they are fish\u2014or is the content of\ntheir belief somehow subtly different in virtue of their different\nattitude toward whales? With certain caveats, the atomist\nwill say the former, the holist the latter. In general, the\natomist holds that the content of one\u2019s beliefs does not depend\nin any general way on one\u2019s related beliefs (though it may\ndepend on the contents of a few specially related beliefs such as\ndefinitions) and thus, consequently, that people who sincerely and\ncomprehendingly accept the same sentence normally have exactly the\nsame belief. Holism is the contrary view that the content of every\nbelief depends to a large degree on a broad range of one\u2019s\nrelated beliefs, and consequently that two people will rarely believe\nexactly the same thing.\n\nHolism may be defended by a slippery-slope argument. It seems that we\ncan imagine Sanjay\u2019s and Ani\u2019s beliefs about the nature of\nfish and the members of the class of fish slowly diverging. At some\npoint, it will seem plainly correct to say that even though they may\nboth say \u201csalmon are fish\u201d, they are not expressing the\nsame belief by that sentence. As an extreme case, we might imagine Ani\nto be so benighted as to hold that to be a \u201cfish\u201d is\nneither more nor less than to be an Earthly animal in regular contact\nwith Martians, and that only salmon, whales, leopards, and banana\nslugs are in such contact. But if we deny, in the extreme case, that\nAni and Sanjay share the same belief, expressed by the sentence\n\u201csalmon are fish\u201d, it seems artificial to draw a sharp\nline anywhere in the progression of divergence, on one side of which\nthey share exactly the same belief about salmon and on the other side\nof which they have divergent beliefs. One is thus led to the\nconclusion that similarity in belief is a matter of degree, and it may\nthen be difficult to avoid accepting that even a relatively small\ndivergence in surrounding beliefs may be sufficient to generate subtle\ndifferences between two beliefs expressed in the same words. Similar\nslippery slope arguments can be constructed that emphasize gradual\nbelief change in concept acquisition (\u201cLeibniz was a\nmetaphysician\u201d agreed to before and after learning philosophy)\nor gradual change in surrounding theory or in the meaning of a term\n(\u201celectrons have orbits\u201d as uttered by Niels Bohr in 1913\nand as uttered by Richard Feynman in 1980). (This argument is similar\nin some ways to Stalnaker\u2019s argument for a possible-worlds\nanalysis of the propositional contents of belief\u2014see \u00a73.1,\nabove\u2014and indeed Stalnaker takes himself, there, to be committed\nto holism.)\n\nDispositional and interpretational approaches to belief tend to be\nholist. On these views, recall, to believe is to be disposed to\nexhibit patterns of behavior interpretable or classifiable by means of\nvarious belief attributions (see \u00a71.2 and \u00a71.3 above). It is\nplausible to suppose that a subject\u2019s match to the relevant\npatterns will generally be a matter of degree. There may be few actual\ncases in which two subjects exactly match in their behavioral patterns\nregarding P, even if it gets matters approximately right to\nattribute to each of them the belief that P. Since behavioral\ndispositions are interlaced in a complex way, divergence in any of a\nvariety of attitudes related to P may be sufficient to ensure\ndivergence in the patterns relevant to P itself. As\nAni\u2019s associated beliefs grow stranger, her overall behavioral\npattern, or dispositional structure, begins to look less and less like\none that we would associate with believing that salmon are fish.\n\nIt is sometimes objected to holism that, intuitively, both Shakespeare\nand contemporary physicians believe that blood is red, while on the\nholist view it is hard to see how their beliefs could even be similar,\ngiven that they have so many different surrounding beliefs about both\nblood and redness. Although in principle a holist could respond to\nthis objection by describing what sort of differences in surrounding\nbelief create only minor divergences and what differences create major\nones, there have been no influential attempts at such a project.\n\nHolism appears to be incompatible with a certain variety of\nrepresentationalism about belief. If beliefs, or the representations\nunderlying them, are stored symbols in the mind, somewhat like\nsentences on a chalkboard or objects in a box (to use standard\nFodorian metaphors), then it is natural to suppose that those beliefs\ncan, in principle, exist independently of each other. Whether one\nbelieves P depends on whether a representation with the\ncontent \u201cP\u201d is present in the right sort of way\nin the mind, which would not seem to be directly affected by whether\nQ or not-Q, or R or not-R, is also\nrepresented. If there is, in addition, an innate language of thought\nof the sort advocated by Fodor and others, then the basic terms of\nthat language may also be exactly the same from person to person. If a\nview of this sort about the mind can be sufficiently well supported,\nholism would have to be rejected. Conversely, if holism is plausible,\nit cuts against the more atomistic forms of representationalism.\n\nFodor and Lepore (1992) contains an excellent if dated review and\ncritique of arguments for holism. The foremost defenders of holism are\nprobably Quine (1951) and Davidson (1984).\n",
