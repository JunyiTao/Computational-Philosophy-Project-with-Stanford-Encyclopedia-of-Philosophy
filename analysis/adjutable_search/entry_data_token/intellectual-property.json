As different legal\nsystems matured in protecting intellectual works, there was a\nrefinement of what was being protected within different areas. Over\nthe same period several strands of moral justification for\nintellectual property were offered: namely, personality-based,\nutilitarian, and Lockean.

History of Intellectual Property\n\nOne of the first known references to intellectual property protection\ndates from 500 B.C.E., when chefs in the Greek colony of Sybaris were\ngranted year-long monopolies for creating particular culinary\ndelights. There are at least three other notable references to\nintellectual property in ancient times\u2014these cases are cited in\nBruce Bugbee\u2019s formidable work The Genesis of American\nPatent and Copyright Law (Bugbee 1967). In the first case,\nVitruvius (257\u2013180 B.C.E.) is said to have revealed intellectual\nproperty theft during a literary contest in Alexandria. While serving\nas judge in the contest, Vitruvius exposed the false poets who were\nthen tried, convicted, and disgraced for stealing the words and\nphrases of others.\n\nThe second and third cases also come from Roman times (first century\nC.E.). Although there is no known Roman law protecting intellectual\nproperty, Roman jurists did discuss the different ownership interests\nassociated with an intellectual work and how the work was\ncodified\u2014e.g., the ownership of a painting and the ownership of\na table upon which the painting appears. There is also reference to\nliterary piracy by the Roman epigrammatist Martial. In this case,\nFidentinus is caught reciting the works of Martial without citing the\nsource.\n\nThese examples are generally thought to be atypical; as far as we\nknow, there were no institutions or conventions of intellectual\nproperty protection in Ancient Greece or Rome. From Roman times to the\nbirth of the Florentine Republic, however, there were many franchises,\nprivileges, and royal favors granted surrounding the rights to\nintellectual works. Bugbee distinguishes between franchises or royal\nfavors and systems of intellectual property in the following way:\nfranchises and royal favors restrict access to intellectual works\nalready in the public domain, thus these decrees take something from\nthe people. An inventor, on the other hand, deprives the public of\nnothing that existed prior to the act of invention (Bugbee 1967). One\nof the first statutes that protected authors\u2019 rights was issued\nby the Republic of Florence on June 19, 1421, to Filippo Brunelleschi,\na famous architect. This statute not only recognized the rights of\nauthors and inventors to the products of their intellectual efforts;\nit built in an incentive mechanism that became a prominent feature of\nAnglo-American intellectual property protection. For several reasons,\nincluding Guild influence, the Florentine patent statute of 1421\nissued only the single patent to Brunelleschi. The basis of the first\nlasting patent institution of intellectual property protection is\nfound in a 1474 statute of the Venetian Republic. This statute\nappeared 150 years before England\u2019s Statute of Monopolies;\nmoreover, the system was sophisticated. The rights of inventors were\nrecognized, an incentive mechanism was included, compensation for\ninfringement was established, and a term limit on inventors\u2019\nrights was imposed.\n\nAmerican institutions of intellectual property protection are based on\nthe English system that began with the Statute of Monopolies (1624)\nand the Statute of Anne (1710). The Statute of Monopolies granted\nfourteen-year monopolies to authors and inventors and ended the\npractice of granting rights to \u201cnon-original/new\u201d ideas or\nworks already in the public domain. In contrast to patent institutions\nin Europe, literary works remained largely unprotected until the\narrival of Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press in the fifteenth\ncentury. Even then there were few true copyrights granted\u2014most\nwere grants, privileges, and monopolies.\n\nThe Statute of Anne (1710) is considered by scholars to be the first\nstatute of modern copyright. The statute begins:\n\n\u201cWhereas printers, booksellers, and other persons have lately\nfrequently taken the liberty of printing, reprinting, and publishing\nbooks without the consent of the authors and proprietors \u2026 to\ntheir very great detriment, and too often to the ruin of them and\ntheir families: for preventing therefore such practices for the\nfuture, and for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write\nuse books, be it enacted \u2026\u201d (Great Britain, Statute\nof Anne, 1710)\n\n\nThe law gave protection to the author by granting fourteen-year\ncopyrights, with a fourteen-year renewal possible if the author was\nstill alive.\n\nIn the landmark English case Miller v. Taylor (1769), the\ninherent rights of authors to control what they produce, independent\nof statute or law, was affirmed. While this case was later overruled\nin Donaldson v. Becket (1774), the practice of recognizing\nthe rights of authors had begun. Over the following decades other\nEuropean countries, including Belgium, Holland, Italy, and\nSwitzerland, followed the example set by England (Bugbee 1967).\nVarious international treaties like the Berne Convention treaty and\nthe Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS 1994)\nagreement have expanded the geographic scope of intellectual property\nprotection to include most of the globe.\n2. The Domain of Intellectual Property\n\nAt the most practical level, the subject matter of intellectual\nproperty is largely codified in Anglo-American copyright, patent, and\ntrade secret law, as well as in the moral rights granted to authors\nand inventors within the continental European doctrine. Although these\nsystems of property encompass much of what is thought to count as\nintellectual property, they do not map out the entire landscape. Even\nso, Anglo-American systems of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, along with certain continental doctrines, provide a rich\nstarting point for understanding intellectual property (Moore 1998a).\nWe will take them up in turn.\n2.1 Copyright\n\nThe domain of copyright protection is original works of authorship\nfixed in any tangible medium of expression (17 U.S.C. \u00a7102\n(1988)). Works that may be copyrighted include literary, musical,\nartistic, photographic, architectural, and cinematographic works;\nmaps; and computer software. First, for something to be protected, it\nmust be fixed in a permanent or tangible medium of expression.\n For example, an expression could be chiseled into stone,\nprinted in a book, or saved on a hard drive. Second, the work\nmust be \u201coriginal\u201d\u2014the work must be the\nauthor\u2019s own production; it cannot be the result of copying\n(Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239\n(1903)). Third, copyright does not extend to short phrases, titles, or\nnames as these to do not contain the minimum amount of authorship\nrequired by copyright. A fourth requirement that limits the\ndomain of what can be copyrighted is that the expression must be\n\u201cnon-utilitarian\u201d or \u201cnon-functional\u201d in\nnature. Utilitarian products, or products that are useful for work,\nfall, if they fall anywhere, within the domain of patents. Finally,\nrights only extend over the actual concrete expression and the\nderivatives of the expression\u2014not to the abstract ideas\nthemselves. For example, Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, as\nexpressed in various articles and publications, is not protected under\ncopyright law. Someone else may read these publications and express\nthe theory in her own words and even receive a copyright for her\nparticular expression. Some may find this troubling, but such rights\nare outside the domain of copyright law. The individual who copies\nabstract theories or ideas and expresses them in her own words may be\nguilty of plagiarism, but she cannot be held liable for copyright\ninfringement.\n\nThere are five exclusive rights that copyright owners enjoy, and three\nmajor restrictions on the bundle. The five rights are: the right to\nreproduce the work, the right to adapt it or derive other works from\nit, the right to distribute copies of the work, the right to display\nthe work publicly, and the right to perform it publicly. Under U.S.\ncopyright law, each of these rights may be individually parsed out and\nsold separately by the copyright owner. All five rights lapse after\nthe lifetime of the author plus 70 years\u2014or in the case of works\nfor hire, the term is set at 95 years from publication or 120 years\nfrom creation, whichever comes first. Aside from limited duration (17\nU.S.C. \u00a7302), the rules of fair use (17 U.S.C. \u00a7107) and\nfirst sale (17 U.S.C. \u00a7109(a)) also restrict the rights of\ncopyright owners. Although the notion of \u201cfair use\u201d is\nnotoriously hard to spell out, it is a generally recognized principle\nof Anglo-American copyright law that allows anyone to make limited use\nof another\u2019s copyrighted work for such purposes as criticism,\ncomment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. For\nexample, fair use would cover a student using short quotes of\ncopyrighted material for academic purposes. The \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d rule prevents a copyright holder who has sold copies of a\nprotected work from later interfering with the subsequent sale of\nthose copies. For example, a copyright holder could not place, as a\ncondition of sale, that the work in question never be given to a\nlibrary or thrift shop. In short, the owners of copies can do\nwhat they like with their property, short of violating the copyrights\nmentioned above.\n\nAdditionally, copyright does not preclude independent creation (unlike\npatents). For example, if Smith creates a short poem and\nJones independently creates the exact same poem. Both could\nobtain copyrights to their original expressions.\n2.2 The Creative Commons, Copyleft, and Licensing\n\nAs a modern workaround for the first sale rule, many online content\nproviders, rather than selling a copy of a work, simply offer\nlicensing agreements (through click-wrap, shrink-wrap, etc.) that\nallow only specific uses of protected content. These approaches to\nprotecting intellectual works are relatively new and seemingly build\nupon the copyright systems already in place. For example, by using\nlicensing agreements to guarantee different levels of downstream\naccess, the Creative Commons and Copyleft models seek to expand the\ncommons of thought and expression (Stallman 1997; Lessig 2004). An\nowner may allow others to build upon a protected work provided that\nthe \u201cnew\u201d work is similarly accessible or usable. Note\nthat the moral bindingness of these contracts/agreements presuppose\nprior entitlements (hinting at the moral justifications offered\nbelow). For example, if neither party to a Copyleft license owns or\nhas legitimate title to the intellectual work in question, then the\nresulting agreement/license will not be binding. Thus, Creative\nCommons and Copyleft models are actually built upon ownership or\nentitlement claims to intellectual works.\n2.3 Patents\n\nThe domain or subject matter of patent law is the invention and\ndiscovery of new and useful processes, machines, articles of\nmanufacture, or compositions of matter. There are three types of\npatents recognized by US patent law: utility patents, design patents,\nand plant patents. Utility patents protect any new, useful, and\nnonobvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of\nmatter, as well as any new and useful improvement thereof. Design\npatents protect any new, original, and ornamental design for an\narticle of manufacture. Finally, the subject matter of a plant patent\nis any new variety of plant that is asexually propagated (e.g. rose\nbushes grown by cutting pieces of the stem). Patent protection is the\nstrongest form of intellectual property protection, in that a\ntwenty-year exclusive monopoly is granted to the owner over any\nexpression or implementation of the protected work (35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7101 (1988) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7154(a)(2)).\n\nAs with copyright, there are restrictions on the domain of patent\nprotection. The U.S. Patent Act requires usefulness, novelty, and\nnon-obviousness of the subject matter. The usefulness requirement is\ntypically deemed satisfied if the invention can accomplish at least\none of its intended purposes. Needless to say, given the expense of\nobtaining a patent, most machines, articles of manufacture, and\nprocesses are useful in this minimal sense.\n\nA more robust requirement on the subject matter of a patent is that\nthe invention defined in the claim for patent protection must be new\nor novel. There are several categories or events, all defined by\nstatute, that can anticipate and invalidate a claim of a patent (35\nU.S.C. \u00a7101 (1988)). In general, the novelty requirement\ninvalidates patent claims if the invention was publicly known before\nthe patent applicant invented it. For example, someone could not\nobtain a patent on the production of stained glass by mixing potash\nand sand, heating the mixture to 3000 Fahrenheit, and then adding\ndifferent metallic oxide powders to produce different colors, even if\nthe inventor in this case independently came up with this process.\n \n\nIn addition to utility and novelty, the third restriction on\npatentability is non-obviousness. United States patent law requires\nthat the invention not be obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the\nrelevant art at the time the invention was made. A hypothetical\nindividual is constructed and the question is asked, \u201cWould this\ninvention be obvious to an expert in the relevant field?\u201d If it\nwould be obvious to this imaginary individual then the patent claim\nfails the test (35 U.S.C. \u00a7103).\n\nIn return for public disclosure and the ensuing dissemination of\ninformation, the patent holder is granted the right to make, use,\nsell, and authorize others to sell the patented item (35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7154 (1984 and Supp. 1989)). The bundle of rights conferred by a\npatent excludes others from making, using, or selling the invention\nregardless of independent creation. Like copyright, patent rights\nlapse after a given period of time\u201420 years for utility and\nplant patents, 14 for design patents. But unlike copyright protection,\nduring their period of applicability these rights preclude others who\nindependently invent the same process or machine from being able to\npatent or market their invention.  \n2.4 Trade Secret\n\nThe subject matter of trade secret law is almost unlimited in terms of\nthe content or subject matter that may be protected and typically\nrelies on private measures, rather than state action, to preserve\nexclusivity. \u201cA trade secret is any information that can be used\nin the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is\nsufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential\neconomic advantage over others\u201d (U.S. Legal Code, The\nRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, 1995, \u00a739). The secret\nmay be a formula for a chemical compound; a process of manufacturing,\ntreating, or preserving materials; a pattern for a machine or other\ndevice; or a list of customers. Trade secrets are not registered\nwith a government agency.\n\nThe two major restrictions on the domain of trade secrets are the\nrequirements of secrecy and competitive advantage. An intellectual\nwork is not a secret if it is generally known within the industry,\npublished in trade journals, reference books, etc., or readily\ncopyable from products on the market.\n\nAlthough trade secret rights have no built-in expiration, they are\nextremely limited in one important respect. Owners of trade secrets\nhave exclusive rights to make use of the secret only as long as the\nsecret is maintained. If the secret is made public by the owner, then\ntrade secret protection lapses and anyone can make use of it.\nMoreover, owners\u2019 rights do not exclude independent invention or\ndiscovery. Within the secrecy requirement, owners of trade secrets\nenjoy management rights and are protected from misappropriation. This\nlatter protection is probably the most important right granted, given\nthe proliferation of industrial espionage and employee theft of\nintellectual works. If a trade secret is misappropriated and made\npublic, courts may impose injunctive relief and damages. For example,\nif someone misappropriates a trade secret and publishes it on a\nwebsite, courts may require deletion and payment of fines.\n2.5 Trademark\n\nThe domain or subject matter of trademark is, generally speaking, the\ngood will or good name of a company. A trademark is any word, name,\nsymbol, or device, or any combination thereof, adopted by a\nmanufacturer or merchant to identify her goods and distinguish them\nfrom goods produced by others (15 U.S.C. \u00a71127 (1988)).\n Some marks identify services rather than products.\n\nA major restriction on what can count as a trademark is whether or not\nthe symbol is used in everyday language. In this respect, owners of\ntrademarks do not want their symbols to become too widely used because\nonce this occurs, the trademark lapses. An example of this restriction\neliminating a word from trademark protection is\n\u201caspirin\u201d\u2014as the word became a part of the common\nculture, rights to exclusively use the trademark lapsed.\n\nOwnership of a trademark confers upon the property holder the right to\nuse a particular mark or symbol and the right to exclude others from\nusing the same (or similar) mark or symbol. The duration of these\nrights is limited only in cases where the mark or symbol ceases to\nrepresent a company or interest, or becomes entrenched as part of the\ncommon language or culture.\n2.6 Protecting Mere Ideas\n\nOutside of the regimes of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, there is a substantial set of case law that allows\nindividuals to protect mere ideas as personal property. This system of\nproperty is typically called the \u201claw of ideas\u201d (Nimmer\n1954, Epstein 1992). A highly publicized case in this area is\nBuchwald v. Paramount Pictures (13 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1497 (Cal.\nSuper. Ct. 1990)), concerning the Eddie Murphy movie Coming to\nAmerica. Buchwald approached Paramount Pictures with a movie idea\nand it was agreed that if a movie was made following Buchwald\u2019s\npremise he would receive compensation. Buchwald did not fix his idea,\nfor example by writing it down, and thus copyright infringement did\nnot apply. After several years of false starts and negotiations\nParamount notified Buchwald that the movie based on his idea was not\ngoing to be produced. Shortly after this notification, Coming to\nAmerica was released and credit was given to Eddie Murphy. Even\nthough the movie supposedly lost money, Buchwald sued and received\ncompensation.\n\nThe law of ideas is typically applied in cases where individuals\nproduce ideas and submit them to corporations expecting to be\ncompensated. In certain cases, when these ideas are used by the\ncorporation (or anyone) without authorization, compensation may be\nrequired. Before concluding that an author has property rights to her\nidea(s), courts require the idea(s) to be novel or original\n(Murray v. National Broadcasting, 844 U.S. F2d 988 (Second\nCir. 1988)) and concrete (Hamilton Nat\u2019l Bank v. Belt\n(D.C. Cir. 1953)). Compensation is offered only in cases of\nmisappropriation (Sellers v. American Broadcasting Co. (11th\nCir. 1982)).\n2.7 Droits Morals: Continental Systems of Intellectual Property\n\nArticle 6bis of the Berne Convention articulates the notion\nof \u201cmoral rights\u201d that are included in continental\nEuropean intellectual property law. The doctrine protects the personal\nrights of creators, as distinguished from their economic rights, and\nis generally known in France as \u201cdroits morals\u201d or\n\u201cmoral rights.\u201d These moral rights consist of the right to\ncreate and to publish a work in any form desired, the creator\u2019s\nright to claim the authorship of his work, the right to prevent any\ndeformation, mutilation or other modification thereof, the right to\nwithdraw and destroy the work, the prohibition against excessive\ncriticism, and the prohibition against all other injuries to the\ncreator\u2019s personality (Roeder 1940).\n3. Justifications and Critiques\n\nArguments for intellectual property rights have generally taken one of\nthree forms (Hughes 1988; Moore 2008). Personality theorists maintain\nthat intellectual property is an extension of individual personality.\nUtilitarians ground intellectual property rights in social progress\nand incentives to innovate. Lockeans argue that rights are justified\nin relation to labor and merit. To this we add a recent fourth strand\nof justification (Moore 2018). This more recent justification analyzes\ncontent creation and access as a form of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\nOn grounds of prudence and self-interest, we each have reason to adopt\nand promote institutions that protect intellectual works. While each\nof these strands of justification has its weaknesses, there are also\nstrengths unique to each.\n3.1 Personality-Based Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nRather than focusing on incentives and consequences or labor and merit\n(see utilitarian and Lockean arguments below), the personality\ntheorist argues that intellectual property is an extension of\nindividual personality. Personality theorists such as Hegel maintain\nthat individuals have moral claims to their own talents, feelings,\ncharacter traits, and experiences. We are self-owners in this sense.\nControl over physical and intellectual objects is essential for\nself-actualization\u2014by expanding our selves outward beyond our\nown minds and mixing these selves with tangible and intangible items,\nwe both define ourselves and obtain control over our goals and\nprojects. For Hegel, the external actualization of the human will\nrequires property (Hegel 1821). Property rights are important in two\nways according to this view. First, by controlling and manipulating\nobjects, both tangible and intangible, our will takes form in the\nworld and we obtain a measure of freedom. Individuals may use their\nphysical and intellectual property rights, for example, to shield\ntheir private lives from public scrutiny and to facilitate life-long\nproject pursuit. Second, in some cases our personality becomes fused\nwith an object\u2014thus moral claims to control feelings, character\ntraits, and experiences may be expanded to intangible works (Humboldt\n1792; Kohler 1969).\n\nThe right of divulgation, when and if an intellectual work is placed\nbefore the public, is grounded in justified possession or prior\nentitlements over the work in question and the wrongness of compelling\nspeech.  A central wrong-making feature of violating the\nrights of attribution and integrity is that, in the typical case, a\nkind of misrepresentation or fraud occurs. For example, when\nSmith changes a painting by Jones without notice, there is a\nmisrepresentation being offered. As with attribution and\nintegrity, the right of withdraw could be protected by contracts\nthat determine the downstream uses of intellectual works.\n3.1.1 Problems for Personality-Based Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nThere are at least four problems with this view (Hughes 1988; Palmer\n2005; Schroeder 2006). First, it is not clear that we own our\nfeelings, character traits, and experiences. While it is true that we\nhave possession of these things or that they are a part of each of us,\nan argument is needed to establish the relevant moral claims.\n\nSecond, even if it could be established that individuals own or have\nmoral claims to their personality, it does not automatically follow\nthat such claims are expanded when personalities become infused in\ntangible or intangible works. Rather than establishing property claims\nto such works, perhaps we should view this as an abandonment of\npersonality\u2014similar to the sloughing off of hair and skin cells.\nMoreover, misrepresenting an intellectual work (assuming there are no\nmoral rights to these expressions) might change the perception of an\nauthor\u2019s personality, but it would not in fact change their\npersonality.\n\nThird, assuming that moral claims to personality could be expanded to\ntangible or intangible items, we would still need an argument\njustifying property rights. Personality-based moral claims may warrant\nnothing more than use rights or prohibitions against alteration.\nFinally, there are many intellectual innovations in which there is no\nevidence of a creator\u2019s personality\u2014a list of customers or\na new safety-pin design, for instance (Hughes 1988). Given these\nchallenges, personality-based theories may not provide a strong moral\nfoundation for legal systems of intellectual property.\n3.1.2 The Personality Theorist\u2019s Rejoinder\n\nEven if we acknowledge the force of these objections, there does seem\nto be something intuitively appealing about personality-based theories\nof intellectual property rights. Suppose, for example, that Mr. Friday\nbuys a painting at a garage sale\u2014a long-lost Crusoe original.\nFriday takes the painting home and alters the painting with a marker,\ndrawing horns and mustaches on the figures in the painting. The\nadditions are so clever and fit so nicely into the painting that\nFriday hangs it in a window on a busy street. There are at least two\nethical worries to consider in this case. First, the alterations by\nFriday may cause unjustified economic damage to Crusoe. Second, and\nindependent of the economic considerations, Friday\u2019s actions may\ndamage Crusoe\u2019s reputation. The integrity of the painting has\nbeen violated without the consent of the author, perhaps causing\nlong-term damage to his reputation and community standing. If these\nclaims are sensible, then it appears that we are acknowledging\npersonality-based moral \u201cstrings\u201d attaching to certain\nintellectual works. By producing intellectual works, authors and\ninventors put themselves on display, so-to-speak, and incur certain\nrisks. Intellectual property rights afford authors and inventors a\nmeasure of control over this risk. To put the point a different way,\nit is the moral claims that attach to personality, reputation, and the\nphysical embodiments of these individual goods that justify legal\nrules covering damage to reputation and certain sorts of economic\nlosses.\n\nThere is also the issue of compelled speech. Friday, in this\nexample, is misrepresenting Crusoe and compelling him to discuss\nthe changes, integrity, and original intent of the intellectual\nwork. Instances of plagiarism and forgery are also example of\nmisrepresentation and fraud.\n\nMoreover, personality-based theories of intellectual property often\nappeal to other moral considerations. Hegel\u2019s personality-based\njustification of intellectual property rights included an\nincentive-based component as well\u2014he asserts that protecting the\nsciences promotes them, benefiting society (Hegel 1821). Perhaps the\nbest way to protect these intuitively attractive personality-based\nclaims to intangible works is to adopt a more comprehensive system\ndesigned to promote progress and social utility.\n3.2 The Utilitarian Incentives-Based Argument for Intellectual Property\n\nIn terms of \u201cjustification,\u201d modern Anglo-American systems\nof intellectual property are typically modeled as incentive-based and\nutilitarian (Oppenheim 1951; Machlup 1962; Boonin 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Mackaay 1990; Coskery 1993; Palmer 1997; Moore 2001, Lemley\n2015). On this view, a necessary condition for promoting the creation\nof valuable intellectual works is granting limited rights of ownership\nto authors and inventors. Absent certain guarantees, authors and\ninventors might not engage in producing intellectual property.\nAlthough success is not ensured by granting these rights, failure is\ninevitable if those who incur no investment costs can seize and\nreproduce the intellectual effort of others. Adopting systems of\nprotection like copyright, patent, and trade secret yields an optimal\namount of intellectual works being produced, and a corresponding\noptimal amount of social utility. Coupled with the theoretical claim\nthat society ought to maximize social utility, we arrive at a simple\nyet powerful argument for the protection of intellectual property\nrights.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the issue of whether intellectual property\nprotection does, or does not, sufficiently promote human happiness or\nwell-being is an empirical question. Whether or not, for example,\nintellectual property protection provides an incentive that elicits\nsome optimal output of content creation can be settled only by looking\nto the empirical evidence. Likewise, whether or not intellectual\nproperty protection has the effect of hindering innovation and\ninhibiting the production of novel valuable content can be settled\nonly by empirical analysis. The difficulties involved in obtaining\nsuch evidence suggest that the empirical question will remain debated\nfor some time. Complicating the task is the fact that the efficacy or\nlack thereof of intellectual protection in promoting well-being seems\nto vary from one industry to the next (Lemley 2015).\n\nOn the positive side there are numerous authors who claim that the\nempirical evidence is now squarely in favor of intellectual property\nprotection. The tragedy of a \u2018no-protection rule\u2019 is\nsecrecy, restricted markets, and lost opportunities (Miners &\nStaff 1990; Mossoff 2015; O\u2019Connor 2016). William Fisher\nnotes:\n\nPotential innovators will know that, once they reveal their\nbreakthroughs to the world, other people will be able to take\nadvantage of them for free. Consequently, the innovators will be\nunable to recoup the costs of their innovations (the costs of the\neducation they underwent to prepare them to make the innovations, the\noutlay for research and development, their opportunity costs, etc.).\nAware of this risk, potential innovators will devote their energies to\nother, more lucrative activities, and society at large will suffer.\n(Fisher 2001)\n\n\nRobert J. Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin note that over the long run\nthe world\u2019s growth rate is largely:\n\ndriven by discoveries in the technologically leading economies.\nFollowers converge at least part way toward the leaders because\ncopying is cheaper than innovation over some range. As the pool of\nuncopied ideas diminishes, the cost of imitation tends to\nincrease\u2026the consequence from the absence of intellectual\nproperty rights across economies\u2026[is] the leading places tend\nto have insufficient incentive to invent, and the follower places tend\nto have excessive incentive to copy. (Barro & Sala-I-Martin 1997)\n\n\nProfessor Petra Moser makes the following observation:\n\nIn countries without patent laws, inventors depend entirely on\nsecrecy, lead-time, and other alternatives to patents in protecting\ntheir intellectual property. As a result, investments in research and\ndevelopment may be most attractive in industries in which secrecy can\neffectively guarantee exclusive rights long enough to allow inventors\nto recoup their investments. (Moser 2013)\n\n\nWhile much of the economic literature in this area focuses on patents,\nsimilar points can be made with respect to copyright. With the ease of\ncopying and distribution afforded by modern digital networks, content\ncreators would seem to be at a serious disadvantage compared to\ncopiers. Without copyright there would be nothing to stop copiers\nfrom simply copying movies, books, articles, and music and selling,\ntrading, or allowing others to make free copies. Michael Smith\nand Rahul Telang, argue that piracy harms both producers and consumers\nby undermining the income streams of producers, resulting in less\ncontent being created (Smith & Telang 2016). Sean\nO\u2019Connor notes, \u201cit should be clear that no one would\ninvest without some appropriation mechanism that would provide them\nwith a favorable return on their investment through the monetization\nof the commercialized goods or services. If they cannot see a way to\nget such a return, they will not make the\ninvestment\u201d (O\u2019Connor 2015).\n3.2.2 Problems for the Utilitarian Incentives-Based Argument\n\nOn the negative side there are many who argue that \u201cthe jury is\nout\u201d or that systems of IP protection actually hinder innovative\nactivity (Machlup 1958; Schiff 1971; Palmer 1990; Boldrin & Levine\n2007). On patent protection, Fritz Machlup (1958) wrote \u201cNo\neconomist, on the basis of present knowledge, could possibly state\nwith certainty that the patent system, as it now operates, confers a\nnet benefit or a net loss upon society\u201d (Machlup 1958).\nNevertheless, Machlup went on to argue that such considerations do not\nyield the conclusion that we should abolish patent protection.\nProfessors Michele Boldrin and David Levine argue that a \u2018first\nmover advantage,\u2019 coupled with secrecy and add-on services, is\nsufficient as an incentive for creation and discovery (Boldrin &\nLevine 2007). Tom Palmer made a similar point seventeen years earlier,\narguing that intellectual works should be protected via technological\nfences and contracts, along with bundling in other products and\nservices (Palmer 1990).\n\nGiven that the utilitarian argument rests on providing incentives,\nwhat is needed to critique it are cases that illustrate better ways,\nor equally good ways, of stimulating production without granting\nprivate property rights to authors and inventors. It would be better\nto establish equally powerful incentives for the production of\nintellectual property that did not also require initial restricted use\nguaranteed by rights (Polanyi 1943; Machlup 1962; Hettinger 1989;\nWaldron 1993; Moore 2003; Wright 1998).\n\nOne alternative to granting intellectual property rights to inventors\nas incentive is government support of intellectual labor (Hettinger\n1989; Calandrillo 1998). This could take the form of government-funded\nresearch projects, with the results immediately becoming public\nproperty. The question becomes: can government support of intellectual\nlabor provide enough incentive to authors and inventors so that an\nequal or greater amount of intellectual products are created compared\nto what is produced by conferring limited property rights? Better\nresults may also be had if fewer intellectual works of higher quality\nwere distributed to more people.\n\nUnlike a government-supported system of intellectual property rights,\nreward models may be able to avoid the problems of allowing monopoly\ncontrol and restricting access, and at the same time provide\nincentives to innovate (Shavell and Van Ypersele 2001). In this model,\ninnovators would still burn the midnight oil chasing that pot of gold,\nand governments would not have to decide which projects to fund or\ndetermine the amount of the rewards before the works\u2019\n\u201csocial value\u201d was known. Funds necessary to pay the\nrewards could be drawn from taxes or collecting percentages of the\nprofits of these innovations. Reward models may also avoid the\ndisadvantages of monopoly pricing, and obstructions to further\nadaptation and innovation.\n\nTrade secret protection appears to be the most troubling from a\nutilitarian incentives-based perspective (Hettinger 1989). Given that\nno disclosure is necessary for trade secret protection, promoting\ntrade secrets through incentives yields no reciprocal long-term social\nbenefit. Trade secret protection allows authors and inventors the\nright to slow the dissemination of protected information\nindefinitely\u2014a trade secret necessarily requires secrecy.\n3.2.3 The Utilitarian Rejoinder\n\nThe utilitarian who defends the incentives argument may well agree\nwith many of these criticisms and still maintain that intellectual\nproperty rights, in some form, are justified\u2014the current system\nof protection is better than government support of intellectual\nproperty creation, reward models, or nothing at all. Additionally,\nmost of the worries surrounding the incentive-based approach appear to\nfocus on problems of implementation. We could tinker with our system\nof intellectual property, cutting back on some legal protections and\nstrengthening others (Coskery 1993; Moore 2008). Perhaps we could\ninclude more personality-based restrictions on what can be done with\nan intangible work after the first sale, limit the term of copyrights,\npatents, and trade secrets to something more reasonable, and find ways\nto embrace technologies that promote access while protecting\nincentives to innovate. The utilitarian might also remind us of the\ncosts of changing our system of intellectual property. The \u2018jury\nmay be out\u2019 so-to-speak regarding the economic advantages of legal\nprotections for intellectual works, but the social and economic costs\nof radically changing these institutions at this point would be overly\nburdensome.\n3.3 Lockean Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nA different strategy for justifying intellectual property rights\nbegins with the claim that individuals are entitled to control the\nfruits of their labor (Locke 1690; Hettinger 1989; Becker 1993; Gordon\n1993; Moore 1998b; Hughes 1988; Palmer 2005; Himma 2005a, 2006, 2008,\n2013; Merges 2011). In general, the intuition is that the person who\nclears unowned land, cultivates crops, builds a house, or creates a\nnew invention obtains property rights by engaging in these activities.\nLaboring, producing, thinking, and persevering are voluntary, and\nindividuals who engage in these activities are entitled to what they\nproduce. Subject to certain restrictions, rights are generated when\nindividuals mix their labor with an unowned object. Restrictions or\nlimits on acquisition include a labor requirement, a non-waste\nrequirement, and the \u201cenough and as good\u201d proviso (Locke\n1690). Labor, for Locke, is best understood as metaphor for productive\nactivities needed to sustain and promote human flourishing (Mossoff\n2012). The non-waste requirement invalidates a property claim if the\nappropriator takes more than she can consume or use without spoilage.\nUnlike the labor metaphor, spoilage for Locke means rotting or the\ndestruction of an existing good useful for sustaining human life.\nFinally, the \u201cenough and as good\u201d proviso is best\nillustrated by an example Locke gives. When someone takes a drink of\nwater from a river it is as if he takes nothing at all. His fellows\nare, all things considered, unaffected by this acquisition.\n\nConsider a more formal version of Locke\u2019s famous argument.\nIndividuals own their own bodies and labor\u2014i.e., they are\nself-owners. When an individual labors on an unowned object, her labor\nbecomes infused in the object and for the most part, the labor and the\nobject cannot be separated. It follows that once a person\u2019s\nlabor is joined with an unowned object, assuming that individuals\nexclusively own their body and labor, rights to control are generated.\nThe idea is that there is an expansion of rights: we each own our\nlabor and when that labor is mixed with objects in the commons, our\nrights are expanded to include these goods.\n\nIn terms of intellectual property, the act of creation or discovery\ntypically takes time, effort, and skill. Intellectual works\ndon\u2019t spoil like apples, so there are no\n\u201cnon-waste\u201d concerns. Moreover, the creation or discovery\nseemingly leaves \u201cenough and as good.\u201d Creating a poem,\nfor example, and holding it as a secret does not preclude others from\ncreating their own poems.\n3.3.1 Objections to Locke\n\nLocke\u2019s argument is not without difficulties. Jeremy Waldron\n(1983) argued that the idea of mixing one\u2019s labor is\nincoherent\u2014actions cannot be mixed with objects. P. J. Proudhon\n(1840) argued that if labor was important, the second labor on an\nobject should ground a property right in an object as reliably as the\nfirst labor. Nozick (1974) asked why labor mixing generated property\nrights rather than a loss of labor. Waldron (1983) and Perry (1978)\nhave argued that mixing one\u2019s labor with an unowned object\nshould yield more limited rights than rights of full ownership.\nFinally, if the skills, tools, and inventions used in laboring are\nsocial products, then perhaps individual claims to title have been\nundermined (Grant 1987; Hettinger 1989).\n3.3.2 The Lockean Rejoinder\n\nAmong defenders of Lockean-based arguments for private property, these\nchallenges have not gone unnoticed (Spooner 1855; Schmidtz 1990; Mack\n1990; Simmons 1992; Child 1990; Moore 2001; Mossoff 2012; Claeys\n2017). Rather than rehearsing the points and counterpoints, consider a\nmodified version of the Lockean argument\u2014one that does not so\neasily fall prey to the objections mentioned above.\n\nAfter weeks of effort and numerous failures, suppose Ginger comes up\nwith an excellent new recipe for spicy noodles\u2014a recipe that she\nkeeps in her mind and does not write down. Would anyone argue that\nGinger does not have at least some minimal moral claim to control the\nrecipe? Suppose that Fred samples some of Ginger\u2019s noodles and\ndesires to purchase the recipe. Is there anything morally suspicious\nwith an agreement between them that grants Fred a limited right to use\nGinger\u2019s recipe provided that Fred does not disclose the\nprocess? Alas, Fred didn\u2019t have to agree to the terms and, no\nmatter how tasty the noodles, he could eat something else or create\nhis own recipe. Arguably, part of the moral weightiness of the\nagreement between Ginger and Fred relies on the fact that Ginger holds\nlegitimate title to the recipe. A slightly different way to put\nthis Lockean argument for intellectual property rights is:\n\n\nStep One: The Generation of Prima Facie Claims to Control\n\u2013 Suppose Ginger creates a new intellectual work \u2013\ncreation, effort, etc., yield her prima facie claims to control\n(similar to student desert for a grade).\n\nStep Two: Locke\u2019s Proviso \u2013 If the acquisition of\nan intellectual object makes no one (else) worse off in terms of their\nlevel of well-being compared to how they were immediately before the\nacquisition, then the taking is permitted.\n\nStep Three: From Prima Facie Claims to Property Rights\n\u2013 When are prima facie claims to control an intellectual work\nundefeated? Answer: when the proviso is satisfied. Alas, no one\nelse has been worsened \u2013 who could complain?\n\nConclusion: So long as no harm is done \u2013 the proviso is\nsatisfied \u2013 the prima facie claims that labor and effort may\ngenerate turn into property claims (Moore 2012).\n\n\nIn small communities it may even be possible to contract with all of\none\u2019s fellows securing all or some of the bundle of full\nownership. In this sort of example, every single member of the\ncommunity would be directly part of the agreement. Ginger says to her\npeers, \u201cif you want access to my recipe, then you will have to\nagree to my right to enjoy income\u201d and they reply \u201cbut\nsuch rights can\u2019t be indefinite \u2026 we as a community\nwon\u2019t be on the hook for defending this agreement\nindefinitely.\u201d In the ensuing give-and-take an agreement is\nhammered out. It is important to note that the moral bindingness of\nsuch an agreement is crucially dependent on the initial set of\nentitlement claims generated by labor, desert, and non-worsening. If\nGinger, in this case, was not the author of the recipe \u2014 suppose\nshe took it from someone else \u2014 it is not at all clear that the\nresulting contract would be morally or legally binding.\n\nMoving from small communities to larger ones a more general form of\nagreement between authors, inventors, and society can be considered.\nIf intellectual works are to be held as anything other than trade\nsecrets, walled off with narrow contracts like non-disclosure\nagreements or non-competition arrangements, there must be a way of\nsecuring access. Society may purchase access by offering limited\nrights to authors and inventors. Moreover, if some society does not\noffer this sort of protection, then innovators would likely employ\ntheir talents in other areas or simply move to a society where such\nagreements are recognized.\n3.4 Intellectual Property and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nA major concern and limitation on the traditional justifications for\nintellectual property already discussed is that many scholars reject\nthe starting assumptions needed to generate the desired moral claims.\nFor example, non-utilitarians will dismiss the theoretical foundations\nof utilitarianism. Non-Lockeans will reject Locke\u2019s commitment\nto self-ownership, natural rights, and individual flourishing.\nBuilding off of the positive economic analysis mentioned in the\nutilitarian justification for IP discussed above, Moore (2018) offers\na different sort of argument based on individual prudence and self\ninterest. Note that this argument, while concerned with consequences,\nis not focused on maximizing human well-being or flourishing.\n\nConsider the following case. Imagine that we have two intellectual\nproperty creators, Beren and L\u00fathien, and two possible outcomes\nfor each. In a single-play prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, each player\ncan copy an intellectual creation of the other, or not. Assume as well\nthat the intellectual works created by Beren and L\u00fathien are\nvaluable, interesting, or desired. The best case for either player is\none where their own intellectual creation is not copied and yet they\nget to copy the work of the other player. This is \u2018best\u2019\nfor the player who copies and \u2018worst\u2019 for the player who\ndoesn\u2019t because, (1) the player who copies gets to enjoy or\nconsume more content compared to the other player, (2) the player who\ncopies still has the option or possibility of obtaining benefit by\nselling, trading, or bartering with the other player, while the\nnon-copier does not enjoy these possibilities \u2014 this provides a\nway to recoup research and development costs, and (3) via selling,\ntrading, or bartering the copier may obtain a positional advantage and\nmore capital for future exchanges compared to the non-copier. Simply\nput, the copier obtains more content and retains more opportunities to\nsell, barter, or exchange compared to the non-copier. If Beren and\nL\u00fathien both refrain from copying each other, then each will\navoid the worst outcome in terms of recouping investment costs and\nbeing at a positional disadvantage. Both will also retain the option\nof buying or bartering for the non-copied content the other enjoys.\nThis payoff is \u2018okay,\u2019 better than \u2018worst\u2019 but\nnot as good as \u2018best.\u2019 If both Beren and L\u00fathien\ncopy each other, then both will get extra content to enjoy and will\nnot be put at a positional disadvantage, but each will be denied the\npossibility of recouping research and development costs. The other\nplayer will not buy or barter for content he already possesses. These\npayoffs mirror a prisoner\u2019s dilemma game (Axelrod 198,\n1984, Skyrms 1990, Binmore 2015, Holt, Johnson\nand Schmidtz 2015).\n\nIn modeling content creation, access, and copying as an iterated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma between numerous individuals, the problem\nbecomes even more salient. It will be individually rational to copy\nthe intellectual efforts and creations of others. This will suppress\ninnovation and lead to a sub-optimal result. Based solely on rational\nself-interest and prudence, Moore argues we should adopt institutions\nthat promote innovation and allow inventors the capacity to recoup\nresearch and development costs. If copying becomes too widespread or\nif enforcement mechanisms fail, then we will likely spiral toward the\ncollectively sub-optimal result of suppressing innovation. We see\nsimilar results of an intellectual property prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nplayed out between nations. Through the use of sanctions against\ncopying the intellectual efforts of others, we give ourselves\ncompelling reasons to pursue a collectively superior outcome.\n4. General Critiques of Intellectual Property\n\nPutting aside the strands of argument that seek to justify moral\nclaims to intangible works and the rather focused problems with these\nviews, there are several general critiques of the rights to control\nintellectual property to consider.\n4.1 Information is Not Property\n\nCritics argue that information is not the kind of thing that can be\nowned or possessed and is not something that can be property, as that\nnotion is typically defined. Information objects, such as numbers and\npropositions are abstract objects, which cannot causally interact with\nmaterial objects, and hence cannot be owned or possessed. The idea,\nfor example, that one could, in the relevant sense, possess and hence\nown the novel expressed by the book A Tale of Two Cities\nmakes as little sense as the idea that one could possess and hence own\nthe entity denoted by the symbol \u201c2.\u201d Whatever concepts\nmight properly be applied to abstract objects, on this view, the\nconcept of property, according to these theorists, does not. As a\nconceptual matter, the term \u201cintellectual property,\u201d at\nbest, applies to nothing and, at worst, is incoherent.\n\nThis analysis is vulnerable to at least two objections. First, it is\nnot clear that ownership, as a conceptual matter, requires physical\npossession. One can argue that the essence of ownership consists in a\npower \u2014 the power to exclude others from certain behaviors\ninvolving the relevant entity \u2014 and not in physical control or\npossession of the entity. Second, the claim that information objects\ncannot be property does not imply that it is illegitimate to grant to\nauthors or content-creators a legal right to exclude others from\nappropriating those objects without their consent. That some entity E\nis not \u201cproperty\u201d implies only that it should not be\nlegally protected qua property; it does not imply that E should not be\nprotected in very similar ways. It might be that such legal rights\nshould be called something other than \u201cintellectual property\nrights,\u201d but these rights could be called something else, such\nas, for example, \u201cintellectual content rights.\u201d\n4.2 Information is Non-Rivalrous\n\nMany have argued that the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual works\ngrounds a prima facie case against rights to restrict access. Since\nintellectual works are not typically consumed by their use and can be\nused by many individuals concurrently (making a copy does not deprive\nanyone of their possessions), we have a strong case against moral and\nlegal intellectual property rights (Kuflik 1989; Hettinger 1989;\nBarlow 1997). One reason for the widespread pirating of intellectual\nworks is that many people think restricting access to these works is\nunjustified. Consider a more formal version of this argument:\n\nP1.\nIf a tangible or intangible work can be used and consumed by many\nindividuals concurrently (is non-rivalrous), then maximal access and\nuse should be permitted.\nP2.\nIntellectual works falling under the domains of copyright, patent,\nand trade secret protection are non-rivalrous.\nC3.\nIt follows that there is an immediate prima facie case\nagainst intellectual property rights, or for\nallowing maximal access to intellectual works.\n\n\nThe weak point in this argument is the first premise (Moore 2012;\nHimma, 2005b). Consider sensitive personal information. Moore argues\nthat it false to claim that just because this information can be used\nand consumed by many individuals concurrently, a prima facie moral\nclaim to maximal access is established. This argument applies as well\nto snuff films, obscene pornography, information related to national\nsecurity, personal financial information, and private thoughts; each\nare non-rivalrous, but this fact does not by itself generate prima\nfacie moral claims for maximal access and use. Moreover, it is not\nclear that unauthorized copying does no harm to the owner even in\ncases where the copier would not have purchased a copy legitimately\n(and thus is not denying the owner economic compensation they would\notherwise receive). Unauthorized copying creates un-consented to risks\nthat owners must shoulder.\n\nHimma points out that, by itself, the claim that consumption of\ninformation is non-rivalrous does not imply that we have a right of\nany kind to those objects. While this certainly provides a reason\nagainst thinking protection of intellectual property is morally\njustified, it does not tell us anything about whether we have a right\nof some sort because it does not contain any information about morally\nrelevant properties of human beings\u2014and the justification of\ngeneral rights-claims necessarily rests on attributions of value that\nimplicitly respond to interests of beings with the appropriate level\nof moral standing\u2014in our case, our status as persons (Himma\n2005b).\n4.3 Information Wants to be Free\n\nBarlow (1997) argues that information is entitled to moral\nconsideration in virtue of being alive. On his view, information is a\nform of life with a claim to be free that is grounded in interests and\n\u201cwants\u201d of its own. As he puts the point, information\nobjects \u201care life forms in every respect but a basis in the\ncarbon atom. They self-reproduce, they interact with their\nsurroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.\u201d\nFurther, these living information objects have some sort of interest\nin being made available to everyone free of charge.\n\nBarlow\u2019s argument can be challenged on a couple of grounds.\nFirst, Himma (2005b) argues that it is simply implausible to think of\nabstract objects as having wants \u2014 or even interests. The\nconcept of desire is such that only conscious beings are capable of\nhaving desires; although a conscious being can have subconscious\ndesires, non-sentient entitles are no more accurately characterized as\nhaving desires than as having hopes. Second, even if information\nobjects had wants or interests, Barlow gives no reason for thinking\nthat they have a desire to, or interest in being made freely available\nto all. Certainly, the claim that being made freely available to all\nsomehow benefits information objects needs an argument if for no other\nreason than that it is counterintuitive.\n4.4 The Free Speech Argument against Intellectual Property\n\nAccording to some, promoting intellectual property rights is\ninconsistent with our commitment to freedom of thought and speech\n(Nimmer 1970; Hettinger 1989; Waldron 1993). Closely associated with\nthis argument is the position that individuals have a right to\nknowledge and intellectual property institutions interfere with this\nbasic right. Hettinger argues that intellectual property\n\u201crestricts methods of acquiring ideas (as do trade secrets), it\nrestricts the use of ideas (as do patents), and it restricts the\nexpression of ideas (as do copyrights)\u2014restrictions undesirable\nfor a number of reasons\u201d (Hettinger 1989). Hettinger singles out\ntrade secrets as the most troublesome because, unlike patents and\ncopyrights, they do not require disclosure.\n\nThree sorts of replies have been offered to this kind of worry (Himma\n2006; Moore 2012). While we focus on the free speech argument against\nintellectual property, right to know arguments fall prey to similar\nobjections. The first objection notes that it is the incentives found\nin providing limited protection that fosters the creation and\ndissemination of information\u2014a system of intellectual property\nprotection may cause restricted access in the short run, but overall,\nthe commons of thought and expression is enhanced. Simply put,\nin the long run we get more to talk about, consume, and\nenjoy because of the incentives afforded by copyrights and\npatents.\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that free speech is so presumptively\nweighty that it nearly always trumps other values. Shouting at someone\nover a bullhorn all day is not something we would countenance as\nprotected free speech. Hate speech, obscene expressions, sexual\nharassment, and broadcasting private medical information about others\nare each examples of speech that we are willing to limit for various\nreasons\u2014perhaps intellectual property rights can be viewed in\nthis light.\n\nFinally, consider the contentious, yet established, idea/expression\nrule of copyright. Copyright only applies to fixed expressions, not to\nthe ideas that may make up a fixed expression. For example, someone\nmay read Darwin\u2019s original writings on evolution, express these\nideas in her own words, and obtain a copyright in the new expression.\nThis individual may be guilty of plagiarism, but so long as her\nexpressions are not copied from Darwin\u2019s original or\nsubstantially similar to the original, she can obtain a copyright.\nCopyrights and patents require disclosure and thus the ideas that make\nup these intellectual works may be discussed and analyzed.\n4.4 The Social Nature of Information Argument\n\nAccording to this view, information is a social product and enforcing\naccess restrictions unduly benefits authors and inventors. Individuals\nare raised in societies that endow them with knowledge which these\nindividuals then use to create intellectual works of all kinds. On\nthis view the building blocks of intellectual\nworks\u2014knowledge\u2014is a social product. Individuals should\nnot have exclusive and perpetual ownership of the works that they\ncreate because these works are built upon the shared knowledge of\nsociety. Allowing rights to intellectual works would be similar to\ngranting ownership to the individual who placed the last brick in a\npublic works dam. The dam is a social product, built up by the efforts\nof hundreds, and knowledge, upon which all intellectual works are\nbuilt, is built up in a similar fashion (Proudhon 1840; Grant 1987;\nShapiro 1991; Simmons 1992, Boyle 1997).\n\nBeyond challenging whether the notion of \u201csociety\u201d\nemployed in this view is clear enough to carry the weight that the\nargument demands, critics have questioned the view that societies can\nbe owed something or that they can own or\ndeserve something (Spooner 1855; Nozick 1974; Moore\n2012). Lysander Spooner writes:\n\n\u201cWhat rights society has, in ideas, which they did not\nproduce, and have never purchased, it would probably be very difficult\nto define; and equally difficult to explain how society\nbecame possessed of those rights. It certainly requires something more\nthan assertion, to prove that by simply coming to a knowledge of\ncertain ideas\u2014the products of individual labor\u2014society\nacquires any valid title to them, or, consequently, any\nrights in them\u201d (Spooner 1855).\n\n\nThe problem of how individuals acquire property rights (personality,\nutilitarian, Lockean, etc.) now applies to how societies obtain these\nrights. \n\nMoore charges that defenders of the social nature argument against\nintellectual property fail to see that it may prove too much.\n\nBut like the defender of the first cause argument for the existence of\nGod who rides the principle of sufficient causation to a certain point\nand then conveniently abandons it (every event or object needs a\nsufficient cause and nothing is self-caused except God) the\nproponent of the \u201cshared culture\u201d view is guilty of a\nsimilar trick. \u201cShared culture\u201d or the social nature of\nintellectual property view is sufficient for undermining intellectual\nproperty rights or robust control of intellectual works, but\nconveniently not strong enough to undermine student desert for a\ngrade, criminal punishment, or other sorts of moral evaluation (Moore\n2012).\n\n\nFinally, even if a defender of this view can justify societal\nownership of general pools of knowledge and information, it could be\nargued that we have already paid for the use of this collective wisdom\nwhen we pay for education and the like.\n4.6 The Cost of Publishing Digital Information\n\nCoy (2007) argues is that, in a competitive market, the cost of\ninformation should properly reflect the cost of making it available to\nusers. On this line of analysis, while the cost of making publishing\ninformation in traditional material media like books might be\nsufficiently high to justify charging users a price for it, the cost\n(per user) of making information available on digital media approaches\nzero as the number of users grow larger. For example, there might be\nsome fixed cost involved in making information available on a website,\nbut no additional cost is required beyond that to make that content\navailable to any number of users; the more users appropriating the\ninformation, the lower the cost of making it available to any\nparticular user. Thus, the argument concludes, it would be unfair to\ncharge users a fee for appropriating any piece of (digital)\ninformation; information should be free (or nearly free) so as to\nreflect its dissemination costs.\n\nThere are two problems with this argument. First, if one accepts the\nlegitimacy of free enterprise, as appears to be presupposed by the\nabove argument, then what is a fair price will be determined by the\nvoluntary interactions of buyers and sellers in a competitive market:\nthe fair price is that which is set by the contractual transactions of\nfree, prudentially-rational buyers and sellers. If buyers in a\ncompetitive market are willing to pay a price for digital information\nthat is significantly higher than the seller\u2019s marginal cost,\nthen that price can be presumed fair. Second, the argument overlooks\nthe fact that the fixed costs associated with producing and\ndistributing intellectual content can be quite high. For example, the\nDisney Company spent more than $100 million in making the film\nWest Side Story in 2021. If one assumes that a fair price is\nsuch as to allow the producer to recover the fixed development costs\nassociated with producing and distributing intellectual content, this\nwould entail that it is fair for content producers to charge a price\nthat is sufficiently above the marginal costs to allow them to recover\nthese fixed costs.\n4.7 The Liberty Objection to Intellectual Property\n\nWhen an individual owns a physical item her rights exclude others from\ninterfering with her control of it.  But intellectual\nproperty rights sweep across the entire domain of human\naction, restricting individual liberty even in the privacy of\none\u2019s own home. \u201cHow can the artist, copyright or\npatent holder determine what I can do with my stuff?\u201d Many\nhave attacked the notion of intellectual property on the grounds that\nit violates individual liberty rights (Palmer 1990). Tom Palmer\nargues,\n\n\nLiberty and intellectual property seem to be at odds, for while\nproperty in tangible objects limits actions only with respect to\nparticular goods, property in ideal objects restricts an entire range\nof actions unlimited by place or time, involving legitimately owned\nproperty (VCRs, tape recorders, typewriters, the human voice, and\nmore) by all but those privileged to receive monopoly grants from the\nstate (Palmer 1990).\n\n\nThere are at least two replies to this sort of worry. First, the\nproblem may be addressed by adopting specific legal rules. For\nexample, current Anglo-American institutions of intellectual property\nhave built in provisions that limit the rights of authors and\ninventors. These limitations, for example \u201cfair use\u201d\n(17 U.S.C. \u00a7107) and \u201cfirst sale\u201d (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7109(a)) allow individuals to use a patented or copyrighted\nwork for personal use, non-profit, or educational purposes. Under\ncurrent law it is permissible to make back-up copies of computer\ngames or to copy a chapter of a book from the library. Perhaps\nthese kinds of limitations could be built into the bargain between\nsociety and those who create intellectual works.\n\nA second reply is that rights of all sorts restrict what\nindividuals can do with their bodies and property. Restricting\nindividual liberty is no more a feature of intellectual\nproperty than of other sorts of rights. Physical property\nrights to a car, for example, prohibit all of humanity from\nswinging a bat and damaging the car in question. Even in the\nprivacy of your own home it is not legally permissible to punch\nsomeone in the face, destroy a\nvisitor\u2019s personal property, or engage in risky activities\nthat threaten one\u2019s neighbors. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": [" ", " ", "Axelrod, Robert, 1981, <em>The Emergence of Cooperation Among\nEgoists</em>,\n<em>American Political Science Review</em> 75\n(1981): 306\u201318\n<br/>\n\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1984, <em>The Evolution of\nCooperation</em>, New York, Basic Books.
