    "main_text": "Epistemic Utility Arguments for Precise Credences || Epistemic utility arguments for Probabilism\n5.2 Epistemic utility arguments for Probabilism\n\nFollowing the structure of epistemic utility arguments described in\n Section 2,\n the arguments for Probabilism have three components: an account of\nepistemic utility, which specifies a range of legitimate measures of\nthat quantity; a decision-theoretic norm; and a mathematical theorem\nthat derives the epistemic norm from the decision-theoretic norm when\nthe options are credence functions and utility is epistemic\nutility.\n\n\nProbabilism Rationality requires that your credence\nfunction at any given time is probabilistic.\n\n\nProbabilism is one of a handful of norms that characterize the\nBayesian view in credal epistemology. The epistemic utility arguments\nin its favor appeal to a slight weakening of the Dominance norm to\nwhich we appealed above. We say that one option strongly\ndominates another if it is better at all possible states of the\nworld, and we say it weakly dominates if it is at least as\ngood at all states of the world and better at some.\n\n\nUndominated Dominance If one option is strongly\ndominated by another that isn\u2019t itself even weakly dominated,\nthen rationality requires that you should not adopt the first.\n\n\nAs before, we also appeal to a mathematical theorem to derive\nProbabilism from the account of epistemic utility and the\ndecision-theoretic norm. The strongest theorem in the area is\nthis:\n\n\nDominance Theorem for Probabilism (de Finetti 1974; Savage\n1971; Predd, et al. 2009; Pettigrew 2022; Nielsen 2022)\nSuppose our epistemic utility function is continuous and strictly\nproper. Then\n\n Every non-probabilistic credence function defined on a particular\nagenda is strongly dominated by a probabilistic credence function\ndefined on that agenda.\n No probabilistic credence function defined on a particular agenda\nis even weakly dominated by any credence function defined on that\nagenda.\n\n\n\nSee the\n supplementary materials\nfor a sketch of how the proof of (i) follows from the Dominance\nTheorem for Convex Hulls.\n\nSo, we have the following argument for Probabilism:\n\n\nContinuity\n +\n Strict Propriety (for epistemic utility functions)\n\nUndominated Dominance\n\nTherefore,\n\nProbabilism\n\n\nWe now turn to objections to this argument.\n5.2.1 The Different Dominators Objection\n\nMany of the existing characterizations of the legitimate epistemic\nutility functions characterize a family of such measures; they do not\nnarrow the field to a single epistemic utility function. But, for all\nthat the\n Dominance Theorem for Probabilism\n tells us, it may well be that, for a given non-probabilistic credence\nfunction, different epistemic utility functions in such a family give\ndifferent sets of credence functions that dominate it. Thus, an agent\nwith a non-probabilistic credence function might be faced with a range\nof alternative credence functions, each of which dominates theirs\nrelative to a different legitimate epistemic utility function.\nMoreover, it may be that any credence function that dominates their\ncredence function relative to one epistemic utility function does not\ndominate it relative to another; indeed, it may be that any credence\nfunction that dominates theirs relative to the first risks very high\nepistemic disutility at some world relative to the second, and\nvice versa. In this situation, it is plausible that the agent\nis rationally permitted to stick with her non-probabilistic credence\nfunction. This objection was originally raised by Aaron Bronfman in\nunpublished work, and it has been discussed by H\u00e1jek (2008) and\nPettigrew (2010, 2013b)\n5.2.2 Evidence and Accuracy\n\nAccording to\n Undominated Dominance,\n a dominated option is only ruled irrational in virtue of being\ndominated if at least one of the options that dominate it is not\nitself dominated. But there may be other features that a credence\nfunction might have besides itself being dominated such that being\ndominated by that credence function does not entail irrationality.\nKenny Easwaran and Branden Fitelson (2012) suggest such a feature.\nSuppose that your credence function is non-probabilistic, but it\nmatches the evidence that you have: that is, the credence it assigns\nto a proposition matches the extent to which your evidence supports\nthat proposition. And suppose that none of the credence functions that\ndominate your credence function have that feature. Then, we might say,\nthe fact that your credence function is dominated does not rule it\nirrational. For instance, suppose that a trick coin is about to be\ntossed. Your evidence tells you that the chance of it landing heads is\n0.7. Your credence that it will lands heads is 0.7 and your credence\nthat it will land tails is 0.6. Then you might think that your\ncredences match your evidence, because you have evidence only about it\nlanding heads and your credence that it will land heads equals the\nknown chance that it will land heads. However, it turns out that all\nof the credence functions that dominate your credence function fail to\nmatch this evidence, when epistemic utility is measured by the\n Brier score:\n that is, they assign credence other than 0.7 to the coin landing\nheads. Pettigrew (2014a) and Joyce (2018) respond to this objection on\nbehalf of the dominance argument for Probabilism.\n5.2.3 Dominance and Act-State Dependence\n\nThe final objection to the argument begins with the following sort of\ncase (Greaves 2013; Caie 2013; Campbell-Moore 2015):\n\n\nThwarted Accuracy Suppose I can read your mind. You\nhave opinions only about two propositions, \\(X\\) and \\(\\neg X\\). And\nsuppose that I have control over the truth of \\(X\\) and \\(\\neg X\\). I\ndecide to do the following. First, define the non-probabilistic\ncredence function \\(C^\\dag(X) = 0.8\\) and \\(C^\\dag(\\neg X) = 0.1\\).\nThen:\n\nIf your credence function is \\(C^\\dag\\), I will make \\(X\\) true\n(and thereby make your credence function very accurate);\nIf your credence function is not \\(C^\\dag\\) and your credence in\n\\(X\\) is greater than 0.5, I will make \\(X\\) false (and thereby make\nyour credence function rather inaccurate);\nIf your credence function is not \\(C^\\dag\\) and your credence in\n\\(X\\) is at most 0.5, I will make \\(X\\) true (and thereby make your\ncredence function rather inaccurate).\n\n\n\nNow \\(C^\\dag\\) is not probabilistic, so there are credence functions\nthat are more accurate than \\(C^\\dag\\) whether \\(X\\) is true or false.\nHowever, because of the way I will manipulate the world in response to\nyour credences about it, if you adopt anything other than \\(C^\\dag\\),\nyou\u2019ll end up less accurate. In such a case, it seems\nrationality doesn\u2019t require us to have probabilistic credences.\nThe culprit here is\n Undominated Dominance.\n It is only plausible in cases in which the options between which the\nagent is choosing will not influence the way the world is if they are\nadopted. Such situations are sometimes called situations of\nact-state independence.\n\nThere are three responses available here: the first is to bite the\nbullet, accept the restriction to\n Undominated Dominance,\n and therefore accept a restriction on the cases in which Probabilism\nholds; the second is to argue that the practical case and the\nepistemic case are different, with different decision-theoretic\nprinciples applying to each; the third, of course, is to abandon the\naccuracy argument for Probabilism. Joyce (2018) and Pettigrew (2018a)\nargue for the first response. They advocate different\ndecision-theoretic principles to replace\n Undominated Dominance\n in the epistemic case: Joyce advocates standard causal decision\ntheory together with a Ratifiability condition (Jeffrey 1983);\nPettigrew omits the ratifiability condition. But they both agree that\nthese principles will agree with\n Undominated Dominance\n in cases of act-state independence; and they agree with the verdict\nthat \\(C^\\dag\\) is the only credence function that isn\u2019t ruled\nout as irrational in Thwarted Accuracy. Konek and Levinstein (2019)\nargue for the second response, claiming that, since doxastic states\nand actions have different directions of fit, different\ndecision-theoretic principles will govern them; and Kurt Sylvan (2020)\ncan be read as arguing for the same conclusion on the basis of his\nclaim that, while accuracy is the fundamental source of value for\nepistemic states like credences, it is a value to which the\nappropriate response is respect, not promotion. They\nhold that\n Undominated Dominance\n is the correct principle when the options are credence functions,\neven though it is not the correct principle when the options are\nactions. Caie (2013) and Berker (2013a,b), on the other hand, argue\nfor the third option.\n5.2.4 Epistemic expansions\n\nThe\n Dominance Theorem for Probabilism\n states: for epistemic utility functions of a particular sort, every\nnon-probabilistic credence function defined on a particular agenda is\ndominated by an alternative probabilistic credence function,\ndefined on that same agenda, that is itself not dominated by\na further alternative defined again on the same agenda. But\nyou might think that this is still not sufficient to establish\n Probabilism.\n After all, while the dominating credence function is not itself\ndominated by an alternative credence function defined on the same\nagenda, it might be dominated by an alternative credence function\ndefined on a different agenda. For instance, take the\nnon-probabilistic credence function \\(C^*\\) defined on \\(\\mathcal{F} =\n\\{X, \\neg X\\}\\), where \\(C^*(X) = 0.6 = C^*(\\neg X)\\). Relative to the\nBrier score, it is dominated by \\(C'(X) = 0.5 = C'(\\neg X)\\). But\n\\(C'\\) is Brier dominated by \\(C^\\dag\\) defined on \\(\\mathcal{F}^\\dag\n= \\{X\\}\\), where \\(C^\\dag(X) = 0.5\\).\n\nA natural reaction to this is to define the epistemic utility of a\ncredence function to be the average epistemic utility of the credences\nit assigns, rather than the total epistemic utility. For instance,\njust as the Brier score is the total quadratic score of the credences\nit assigns, we can define the average Brier score of a\ncredence function to be the average quadratic score of the credences\nit assigns. Now, relative to the average Brier score, \\(C^*\\) is\nindeed dominated by \\(C'\\) and \\(C'\\) is not dominated by \\(C^\\dag\\).\nBut \\(C'\\) is dominated by \\(C^+\\) defined on \\(\\mathcal{F}^+ =\n\\{\\top\\}\\), where \\(C^+(\\top) = 1\\). Jennifer Carr (2015) initiated\nthe investigation into how epistemic utility arguments for Probabilism\nmight work when we start to compare credence functions defined on\ndifferent agendas. She notes the analogy with population axiology in\nethics (see entry on\n the repugnant conclusion).\n Pettigrew (2018b) takes this analogy further, proving an\nimpossibility result analogous to those prevalent in that part of\nethics, and Brian Talbot (2022) presses the objection based on this\nproblem further.\n5.2.5 Infinite probability spaces\n\nIn the final two parts of this section, we ask what happens to the\nargument for\n Probabilism\n when (i) we allow for infinite agendas and (ii) we allow the logic of\nthe propositions in those agendas to be non-classical.\n\nWe have assumed throughout that the set of propositions on which an\nagent\u2019s credence function is defined is finite. What happens\nwhen we lift this restriction? The first problem is that we need to\nsay how to measure the epistemic utility of a credence function\ndefined over an infinite set of propositions. Then, having done that,\nwe need to say which such credence functions are dominated relative to\nthese measures, and which aren\u2019t.\n\nSean Walsh has described an extension of the Brier score to the case\nin which the set of propositions to which we assign credences is\ncountably infinite; and he has shown that non-probabilistic credence\nfunctions on such sets are dominated relative to that measure, while\nprobabilistic ones are not. (For a description of Walsh\u2019s\nunpublished work, see Kelley 2019). Mikayla Kelley (2019) has then\ngone considerably further and generalized Walsh\u2019s results\nsignificantly by describing a wide range of possible epistemic utility\nfunctions and characterizing the undominated credence functions\ndefined on sets of propositions of different varieties; and Michael\nNielsen (2023) has generalized them in a different direction.\n5.2.6 Non-classical logic\n\nIn all of the arguments we\u2019ve surveyed above, we have assumed\nthat classical logic governs the propositions to which our agent\nassigns credences. This secures\n Probabilism,\n which demands, among other things, that an agent assign maximal\ncredence to every classical tautology. But what happens if we drop\nthis assumption? What if, instead, the propositions are governed by a\nthree-valued logic, such as strong Kleene logic or the Logic of\nParadox (see entry on\n many-valued logic)?\n In a series of papers, Robbie Williams (2012a,b, 2018) has built on\nmathematical results by Jeff Paris (2001) and Jean-Yves Jaffray (1989)\nto understand what norms of credence the epistemic utility arguments\nestablish in this case. I\u2019ll give a single example here to\nillustrate.\n\nStrong Kleene logic has three truth values: True, False, and Neither.\nOur first question is this: what is the ideal credence in a\nproposition that is neither true nor false? Williams argues that it\nshould be zero. And then he shows that, if the epistemic utility of a\ncredence at a world is its proximity to the ideal credence at that\nworld, and we measure the distance of one credence to another as the\nsquare of the difference between them, as we do to generate the\nquadratic scoring rule in the classical case, then the credence\nfunctions that are not dominated are precisely those that satisfy the\nnorm of Generalized Probabilism:\n\n\nGeneralized Probabilism Suppose \\(\\models\\) is the\nlogical consequence relation of the correct logic. Rationality\nrequires that your credence function \\(C\\) at a given time should be a\ngeneralized probability function for that logic. That is:\n\n If \\(\\bot \\models\\), then \\(C(\\bot) = 0\\).\n If \\(\\models \\top\\), then \\(C(\\top) = 1\\).\n If \\(X \\models Y\\), then \\(C(X)\\leq C(Y)\\).\n\\(C(X \\vee Y) = C(X) + C(Y) - C(X \\wedge Y)\\).\n\n\n\nNote that, if \\(\\models\\) is classical, then Generalized Probabilism\nis equivalent to Probabilism.\n\nWilliams (2018) also considers the case in which you are uncertain\nwhich logic governs the propositions you consider, and Pettigrew\n(2021) draws on a suggestion by Ian Hacking (1967) in a different\ncontext to explore the case in which you know that the logic is\nclassical, but you don\u2019t know all the logical facts.\n",
