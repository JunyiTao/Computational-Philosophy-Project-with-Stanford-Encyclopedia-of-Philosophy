    "main_text": "The Debate About the Comprehensiveness of Liberalism || The Metaphysics of Liberalism\n3.4 The Metaphysics of Liberalism\n\nThroughout the last century, liberalism has been beset by\ncontroversies between, on the one hand, those broadly identified as\n\u2018individualists\u2019 and, on the other,\n\u2018collectivists\u2019, \u2018communitarians\u2019 or\n\u2018organicists\u2019 (for skepticism about this, though, see\nBird, 1999). These vague and sweeping designations have been applied\nto a wide array of disputes; we focus here on controversies concerning\n(i) the nature of society; (ii) the nature of the self.\n\nLiberalism is, of course, usually associated with individualist\nanalyses of society. \u2018Human beings in society\u2019, Mill\nclaimed, \u2018have no properties but those which are derived from,\nand which may be resolved into, the laws of the nature of individual\nmen\u2019 (1963, Vol. 8: 879; see also Bentham: 1970 [1823]: chap. I,\nsec. 4). Herbert Spencer agreed: \u201cthe properties of the mass are\ndependent upon the attributes of its component parts\u201d (1995\n[1851]: 1). In the last years of the nineteenth century this\nindividualist view was increasingly subject to attack, especially by\nthose who were influenced by idealist philosophy. D. G. Ritche,\ncriticizing Spencer\u2019s individualist liberalism, denies that\nsociety is simply a \u2018heap\u2019 of individuals, insisting that\nit is more akin to an organism, with a complex internal life (1896:\n13). Liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and Dewey refused to adopt\nradically collectivist views such as those advocated by Bernard\nBosanquet (2001), but they too rejected the radical individualism of\nBentham, Mill and Spencer. Throughout most of the first half of the\ntwentieth century such \u2018organic\u2019 analyses of society held\nsway in liberal theory, even in economics (see A.F Mummery and J. A.\nHobson, 1956: 106; J.M. Keynes, 1972: 275).\n\nDuring and after the Second World War the idea that liberalism was\nbased on inherently individualist analysis of humans-in-society arose\nagain. Karl Popper\u2019s The Open Society and its Enemies\n(1945) presented a sustained critique of Hegelian and Marxist theory\nand its collectivist and historicist, and to Popper, inherently\nilliberal, understanding of society. The reemergence of economic\nanalysis in liberal theory brought to the fore a thoroughgoing\nmethodological individualism. Writing in the early 1960s, James\nBuchanan and Gordon Tullock adamantly defended the\n\u2018individualistic postulate\u2019 against all forms of\n\u2018organicism\u2019: \u201cThis [organicist] approach or theory\nof the collectivity\u2026.is essentially opposed to the Western\nphilosophical tradition in which the human individual is the primary\nphilosophical entity\u201d (1965: 11\u201312). Human beings,\ninsisted Buchanan and Tullock, are the only real choosers and\ndecision-makers, and their preferences determine both public and\nprivate actions. The renascent individualism of late-twentieth century\nliberalism was closely bound up with the induction of Hobbes as a\nmember of the liberal pantheon. Hobbes\u2019s relentlessly\nindividualistic account of society, and the manner in which his\nanalysis of the state of nature lent itself to game-theoretical\nmodeling, yielded a highly individualist, formal analysis of the\nliberal state and liberal morality.\n\nOf course, as is widely known, we have recently witnessed a renewed\ninterest in collectivist analyses of liberal society \u2014though the\nterm \u2018collectivist\u2019 is abjured in favor of\n\u2018communitarian\u2019. Writing in 1985, Amy Gutmann observed\nthat \u201cwe are witnessing a revival of communitarian criticisms of\nliberal political theory. Like the critics of the 1960s, those of the\n1980s fault liberalism for being mistakenly and irreparably\nindividualistic\u201d (1985: 308). Starting with Michael\nSandel\u2019s (1982) famous criticism of Rawls, a number of critics\ncharge that liberalism is necessarily premised on an abstract\nconception of individual selves as pure choosers, whose commitments,\nvalues and concerns are possessions of the self, but never constitute\nthe self. Although the \u2018liberal-communitarian\u2019 debate\nultimately involved wide-ranging moral, political and sociological\ndisputes about the nature of communities, and the rights and\nresponsibilities of their members, the heart of the debate was about\nthe nature of liberal selves. For Sandel the flaw at the heart of\nRawls\u2019s liberalism is its implausibly abstract theory of the\nself, the pure autonomous chooser. Rawls, he charges, ultimately\nassumes that it makes sense to identify us with a pure capacity for\nchoice, and that such pure choosers might reject any or all of their\nattachments and values and yet retain their identity.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s onwards various liberals sought to show how\nliberalism may consistently advocate a theory of the self which finds\nroom for cultural membership and other non-chosen attachments and\ncommitments which at least partially constitute the self (Kymlicka,\n1989). Much of liberal theory has became focused on the issue as to\nhow we can be social creatures, members of cultures and raised in\nvarious traditions, while also being autonomous choosers who employ\nour liberty to construct lives of our own.\n",
