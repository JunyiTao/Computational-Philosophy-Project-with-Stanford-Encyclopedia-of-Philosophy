    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy || The International Basic Structure and the Principles of the Law of Peoples\n5.1 The International Basic Structure and the Principles of the Law of Peoples\n\nMuch of Rawls\u2019s presentation of the law of peoples parallels the\npresentations of political liberalism and justice as fairness. As a\nliberal society has a basic structure of institutions so, Rawls says,\nthere is an international basic structure (LP, 33, 62, 114,\n115, 122, 123). While Rawls does not say that the international basic\nstructure has a pervasive impact on the life chances of individuals,\nthe rules of this basic structure are coercively enforced (for\nexample, Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was coercively\nreversed by a coalition of other countries). The principles that\nshould regulate this international basic structure thus require\njustification. The justification of these principles must accommodate\nthe fact that there is even more pluralism in worldviews among\ncontemporary societies than there is within a single liberal\nsociety.\n\nRawls puts forward eight principles for ordering the international\nbasic structure:\n\nPeoples are free and independent, and their freedom and\nindependence are to be respected by other peoples.\nPeoples are to observe treaties and undertakings.\nPeoples are equal and are parties to the agreements that bind\nthem.\nPeoples are to observe the duty of nonintervention (except to\naddress grave violations of human rights).\nPeoples have a right of self-defense, but no right to instigate\nwar for reasons other than self-defense.\nPeoples are to honor human rights.\nPeoples are to observe certain specified restrictions in the\nconduct of war.\nPeoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under\nunfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent\npolitical and social regime (LP, 37).\n\n\nAll of these principles, with the exception of the last one, are\nfamiliar from contemporary international law (though Rawls\u2019s\nlist of human rights for principles 4 and 6 is shorter than the list\nin international law). Rawls also leaves room for his law of peoples\nto accommodate various organizations that may help societies to\nincrease their political and economic coordination, such as idealized\nversions of a United Nations, a World Trade Organization, and a World\nBank.\n",
