    "main_text": "Modesty and Humility || Varieties and Distinctions\n1.1 Varieties and Distinctions\n\n\nPhilosophical work on modesty and humility brackets several senses\nof these terms. Philosophical accounts typically do not aim, for\nexample, to capture uses of \u2018modest\u2019 that apply to objects\nas when we say \u201cHe lives in a modest house\u201d or \u201cShe\nhas a modest income\u201d. The sexual sense of modesty, involving\ndress and behavior that presents a non-sexual image, is typically also\nbracketed (see Driver 1989, Statman 1992, Bommarito 2013), though some\naccounts aim to capture this use of the term as well; see Schueler\n(1997, 482), McMullin (2010, 785\u2013786), and Wilson (2014, 79).\n\n\nThere is disagreement about both terms and concepts. Many theorists\ntreat the terms \u2018modesty\u2019 and \u2018humility\u2019 as\ninterchangeable. Hare (1996), Schueler (1997), Hurka (2001), Raterman\n(2006), Garcia (2006), Kellenberger (2010), and Um (forthcoming), to\nname just a few, all treat the terms as referring to more or less the\nsame phenomenon. Others take the different terms to refer to very\ndifferent concepts. There is some historical precedent for this;\nAquinas, for example, considers both modesty and humility to be types\nof temperance (see Summa Theologica 2.2 Q.160 and Foley 2004).\n\n\nAmong those who do draw a distinction between the concepts, there is\nlittle agreement about what exactly the difference is. For some, the\ndifference is between public and private domains. Statman (1992,\n438n45) claims that modesty has an external domain while humility does\nnot and Sinha (2012, 265) says that modesty is public while humility is\nprivate. For others, they have different epistemic requirements:\nBen-Ze\u2019ev (1993, 240) and Nuyen (1998, 101) claim that humility\ninvolves underrating oneself, while modesty does not. Driver (1998,\n378f5), however, claims the opposite making modesty involve underrating\nand humility not. This article will take both terms to refer to a\ngeneral response to one\u2019s own goodness or achievements and will\nuse the term that the author under consideration uses when discussing\nparticular views.\n",
