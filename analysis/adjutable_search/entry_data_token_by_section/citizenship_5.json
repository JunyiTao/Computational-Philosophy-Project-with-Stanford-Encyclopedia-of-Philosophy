    "main_text": "The challenge of globalisation\n3. The challenge of globalisation\n\nFor the better part of the last century, conceptions of citizenship,\ndespite many differences, have had one thing in common: the idea that\nthe necessary framework for citizenship is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. The legal status of citizen is essentially the formal\nexpression of membership in a polity that has definite territorial\nboundaries within which citizens enjoy equal rights and exercise their\npolitical agency. In other words, citizenship, both as a legal status\nand as an activity, is thought to presuppose the existence of a\nterritorially bounded political community, which extends over time and\nis the focus of a common identity. In the last thirty years, this\npremise has come under scrutiny. A host of phenomena, loosely\nassociated under the heading \u2018globalisation\u2019, have\nencouraged this critical awakening: exploding transnational economic\nexchange, competition and communication as well as high levels of\nmigration, of cultural and social interactions have shown how porous\nthose borders have become and led people to contest the relevance and\nlegitimacy of state sovereignty.\n\nThree questions are particularly salient. First, the intensification\nof migratory movements from poorer to richer countries in the context\nof growing inequalities between North and South has led some authors\nto contest the state\u2019s moral right to choose its members by\nselectively closing its borders. Second, what R. Baub\u00f6ck calls\nthe \u201cmismatch between citizenship and the territorial scope of\nlegitimate authority\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 31) has prompted a\ngrowing questioning of the acceptability of the different rights\naccorded to citizens and non-citizens living within the same state.\nDoes contesting the tight association between the territorial state,\ncitizenship, and rights risks weakening the very institutional\nframework that makes citizenship a meaningful practice? This question\nraises a third set of issues as it assumes that the democratic\nnation-state is the only institutional context in which citizenship\ncan thrive. This is contested by those who claim that citizenship can\nbe exercised in a multiplicity of \u2018sites\u2019 both below and\nabove the nation-state.\n",
