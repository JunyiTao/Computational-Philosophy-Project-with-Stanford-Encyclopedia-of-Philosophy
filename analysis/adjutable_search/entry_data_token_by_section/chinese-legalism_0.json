    "main_text": "Defining the fa Tradition\n1. Defining the fa Tradition\n\nThe fa tradition is best known in European languages as the\n\u201cSchool of Law\u201d or \u201cLegalist school.\u201d As Paul\nR. Goldin (2011) had demonstrated, this designation suffers from two\nproblems. First, the term fa does not necessarily mean\n\u201claw.\u201d Whereas this translation is surely correct in many\ncontexts (Lau and L\u00fcdke, forthcoming), fa can as often\nrefer to \u201cstandards,\u201d \u201cmodels,\u201d\n\u201cnorms,\u201d \u201cmethods,\u201d and the like; sometimes it\nrefers to the entirety of political institutions. The\n\u201cLegalist\u201d label is problematic because it inadvertently\nfocuses the studies of the fa tradition on a single issue of\nits relation to the Western concept of the \u201crule of law.\u201d\nWhereas this angle of discussion has certain merits, as was\ndemonstrated in China starting with Liang Qichao\n\u6881\u5553\u8d85 (1873\u20131929) (see Liang [1906] 2003), it\nbecomes counterproductive when the richness and complexity of the\nfa thought is subordinated to a single point, which was not\nnecessarily of primary importance for fa thinkers.\n\nThe second problem of the designation \u201cSchool of Law\u201d (or\n\u201cSchool of fa\u201d; in Chinese fajia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6) is the term \u201cschool\u201d or\n\u201cscholastic lineage\u201d (jia \u5bb6). This term is\nmisleading because it implies a self-aware and organized intellectual\ncurrent of fa adherents on a par with the followers of\n Confucius\n \u5b54\u5b50 (551\u2013479 BCE) or\n Mozi\n \u58a8\u5b50 (ca. 460\u2013390 BCE). In contrast to their case,\nhowever, the fajia label was designated primarily as a\nbibliographic category under which intellectually related texts were\ncatalogized in the imperial libraries. As such this designation is\nheuristically useful, but its usefulness fades once it is used as a\nmajor analytical tool. Heated debates about whether or not a certain\nthinker belongs to fajia, as occurred in the 1970s in China\n(Chen Chuang 2019) and outside it (Creel 1974: 137\u2013162), are of\nlittle scholarly value, because no early thinker identified himself as\na member of the \u201cSchool of fa\u201d in the first\nplace.\n\nThe weaknesses of the \u201cLegalist\u201d or \u201cSchool of\nLaw\u201d label were well known to Western scholars who tried to find\na better translation for fajia, e.g. \u201cRealists\u201d\n(Waley 1939). Recently, this designation was defended and elaborated\nby Kai Vogelsang (2016), who noted the appropriateness to\nfajia of Hans Morgenthau\u2019s definition of\n political realism\n as an approach that \u201csets politics as an autonomous sphere of\naction and understanding apart from other spheres, such as economics,\nethics, aesthetics, or religion\u201d (Morgenthau 1978: 5). This\ndesignation has its merits, but it may be problematic because,\npace Morgenthau and Vogelsang\u2019s intention, it may\ninadvertently create an impression that the opponents of\nfajia were mere idealists, which was not the case. A more\nneutral designation, adopted in Pines (forthcoming A) is the fa\ntradition, which will be employed in this article aside from the cases\nin which the texts specifically speak of fajia.\n\nThe grouping of several thinkers as belonging to the common\nintellectual tradition (the would be fajia) can be traced to\nHan Fei \u97d3\u975e (d. 233 BCE), who is often considered the\nmost significant representative of this intellectual current. In\nchapter 43, \u201cDefining the standards\u201d of Han Feizi\n\u97d3\u975e\u5b50, the thinker presents himself as a\nsynthesizer and improver of the ideas of two of his predecessors,\nShang Yang \u5546\u9785 (d. 338 BCE) and Shen Buhai\n\u7533\u4e0d\u5bb3 (d. 337 BCE). Pairing Shen Buhai and Shang\nYang, and adding Han Fei himself to them became common from the early\nHan dynasty (see, e.g. Huainanzi 6: 230; 11:423; 20: 833).\nThe historian Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (ca. 145\u201390\nBCE) identified these three thinkers as adherents of the teaching of\n\u201cperformance and title\u201d (xingming\n\u5211\u540d) (Shiji 62: 2146; 68: 2227), the term which\nremained a secondary designation of the fa tradition thereafter (Creel\n1974: 140; and see 4.2 below). The fourth thinker commonly associated\nwith fajia\u2014Shen Dao \u614e\u5230 (fourth century\nBCE)\u2014also figures prominently in Han Feizi, where a whole\nchapter (40, \u201cObjection to positional power\u201d) is dedicated\nto the defense and improvement of Shen\u2019s ideas (Pines 2020a).\nThese four thinkers (or, more precisely, the texts associated with\nthem) form the core of the fa tradition.\n\nThe term fajia was coined by Sima Qian\u2019s father, Sima\nTan \u53f8\u99ac\u8ac7 (d. 110 BCE) in his essay \u201cOn the\nEssentials of the Six Schools of Thought.\u201d Sima Tan noted that\nfajia were \u201cstrict and have little kindness,\u201d and\nthat they \u201cneither distinguish between kin and stranger, nor\ndifferentiate between noble and base: everything is determined by the\nstandard (or law, fa).\u201d Sima Tan criticized the\nfajia approach as \u201ca one-time policy that could not be\nconstantly applied,\u201d but also hailed these thinkers for\n\u201chonoring rulers and derogating subjects, and clearly\ndistinguishing offices so that no one can overstep [his\nresponsibilities]\u201d (Shiji 130: 3289\u20133291; for\ntranslations cf. Smith 2003: 141; Goldin 2011: 89). A century later\nthe bibliographical category of fajia was created. The Han\nlibrarian Liu Xiang \u5289\u5411 (79\u20138 BCE) applied this\ndesignation to ten texts in the Han imperial library (Hanshu 30:\n1735). Thenceforth this term remained a major category of book\ncatalogues well into the end of China\u2019s imperial era.\n",
