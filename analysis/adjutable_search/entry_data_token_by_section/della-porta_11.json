    "main_text": "Repetition, Evolution and Adaptation of Ideas in different contexts\n12. Repetition, Evolution and Adaptation of Ideas in different contexts\n\nPorta recycled and gradually expanded many of his ideas and\ninstructions in different works over long periods of time, to appear\nfrequently in enlarged or amplified versions. Thus, some topics\nevolved into separate treatises; at other times, Porta attempted to\nreformulate his ideas to suit ecclesiastical regulations. This was\nprominently the case with Porta\u2019s ideas on physiognomy discussed\nabove. In other instances, Porta sought to adapt his ideas to the\nemerging scholarly standards of the new science of his day. A case in\npoint is his treatment of powers of diverse siphons to lift water or\nto separate different fluids (for instance water from wine) from each\nother. What seems to have been originally intended as a party gag in\nthe first version of the Magia naturalis (where Porta probably\nplagiarized from a chapter in Girolamo Cardano\u2019s De\nsubtilitate), migrated to the enlarged version of the Magia, to become\neventually a key topic in I tre libri spiritali. Here, amidst boasting\nthat he could build structures that would be capable of lifting water\nup to the highest mountains, Porta ties his claims about the powers of\nsiphons to a discussion on the impossibility of the vacuum. Finally he\ndiscusses similar experimental devices in the De aeris transmutations.\nThey were eagerly copied and amplified by the Jesuit Gaspar Schott,\nwhereas Francis Bacon significantly developed them into new\ndirections.
