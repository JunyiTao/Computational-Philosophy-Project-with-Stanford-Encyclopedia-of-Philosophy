    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || Arguments for Properties\n1.2 Arguments for Properties\n\nProperties are typically invoked to explain phenomena of philosophical\ninterest. The most traditional task for which properties have been\nappealed to is to provide a solution to the so-called \u201cone over\nmany problem\u201d via a corresponding \u201cone over many\nargument\u201d. This traces back at least to Socrates and Plato\n(e.g., Phaedo, 100 c-d) and keeps being rehearsed (Russell\n1912: ch. 9; Butchvarov 1966; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 7; Loux 1998:\nch.1). The problem is that certain things are many, they are\nnumerically different, and yet they are somehow one: they appear to be\nsimilar, in a way that suggests a uniform classification, their being\ngrouped together into a single class. For example, some objects have\nthe same shape, certain others have the same color, and still others\nthe same weight. Hence, the argument goes, something is needed to\nexplain this phenomenon and properties fill the bill: the objects in\nthe first group, say, all have the property spherical, those\nin the second red, and those in the third weighing 200\ngrams.\n\nRelatedly, properties have been called for to explain our use of\ngeneral terms. How is it, e.g., that we apply \u201cspherical\u201d\nto those balls over there and refuse to do it for the nearby bench? It\ndoes not seem to be due to an arbitrary decision concerning where, or\nwhere not, to stick a certain label. It seems rather the case that the\nrecognition of a certain property in some objects but not in others\nelicits the need for a label, \u201cspherical\u201d, which is then\nused for objects having that property and not for others. Properties\nare thus invoked as meanings of general terms and\npredicates\u00a0(Plato,\u00a0Phaedo, 78e; Russell 1912: ch.\n9). In contrast with this, Quine (1948; 1953 [1980: 11, 21, 131] )\ninfluentially argued that the use of general terms and predicates in\nitself does not involve an ontological commitment to entities\ncorresponding to them, since it is by deploying singular terms that we\npurport to refer to something (see also Sellars 1960). However, as\nnoted, predicates can be nominalized and thus occur as singular terms.\nHence, even if one agrees with Quine, nominalized predicates still\nsuggest the existence of properties as their referents, at least to\nthe extent that the use of nominalized predicates cannot be\nparaphrased away (Loux 2006: 25\u201334; entry on\n platonism in metaphysics, \u00a74).\n\nAfter Quine (1948), quantificational idiom is the landmark of\nontological commitment. We can thus press the point even more by\nnoting that we make claims and construct arguments that appear to\ninvolve quantification over properties, with quantifiers reaching (i)\nover predicate positions, or even (ii) over both subject and predicate\npositions (Casta\u00f1eda\n 1976).[2]\n As regards (i), consider: this apple is red; this tomato is red;\nhence, there is something that this apple is and this tomato also is.\nAs for (ii), consider: wisdom is more important than beauty; Mary is\nwise and Elisabeth is beautiful; hence, there is something that Mary\nis which is more important than something that Elisabeth is.\n\nQuantification over properties seems ubiquitous not just in ordinary\ndiscourse but in science as well. For example, the inverse square law\nfor dynamics and the reduction of temperature to mean molecular energy\ncan be taken to involve quantification over properties such as masses,\ndistances and temperatures: the former tells us that the attraction\nforce between any two bodies depends on such bodies\u2019 having\ncertain masses and being at a certain distance, and the latter informs\nus that the fact that a sample of gas has a given temperature depends\non its having such and such mean kinetic energy.\n\nSwoyer (1999: \u00a73.2) considers these points within a long list of\narguments that have been, or can be, put forward to motivate an\nontological commitment to properties. He touches on topics such as\na priori knowledge, change, causation, measurement, laws of\nnature, intensional logic, natural language semantics, numbers (we\nshall cover some of this territory in\n \u00a75\n and\n \u00a76).\n\nDespite all this, whether, and in what sense, properties should be\nadmitted in one\u2019s ontology appears to be a perennial issue,\ntraditionally shaped as a controversy about the existence of\nuniversals.\n",
