    "main_text": "War Crime Tribunals || Historical Background\n2.1 Historical Background\n\n\nThe 20th century's most famous and probably most\nsignificant war crime trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany after the\nend of World War\n II.[7]\n Between 1945\u20131949 the United States\nand its allies held a series of 13 trials.  The first, and most famous\nof these, involved the prosecution of senior surviving Nazi officials\nincluding Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Julius Streicher,\nRudolf Hess and Albert Speer. Defendants in the other 12 trials, which\ntook place between 1946\u20131949, included doctors, jurists,\nindustrialists, and other key stake holders in the Nazi state.\n Initially, it was not clear that the allies would put their\ndefeated enemies on trial at all. The creation of the first Nuremberg\nTribunal was preceded by a long debate, especially fierce in the\nUnited States.  Hard liners, represented most vocally by American\nSecretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., advocated the summary\nexecution or forced removal of the entire Nazi chain of command and\nthe destruction of Germany's industrial capacities. On the other hand,\nLegalists, led by Secretary of War Henry Stimson, insisted on\naffording the Nazis fair trials that would honor American procedural\nprotections. The United States fought the war in defense of political\nfreedom, the Legalists insisted. Such freedom depends on upholding the\nideals of the rule of law. These ideals, in turn, require the\nindividualization of guilt and giving defendants a fair chance to\nanswer the charges against them.  Germany, Stimson warned, must not be\npunished en-masse; such collective punishment would only serve to\nincrease resentment and may well plant the seeds for another\nwar. Instead, the careful and fair employment of the courts would\nallow the Germans to \u201cinternalize\u201d their guilt. As Stimson\nput it:\n \u2026punishment is for the purpose of prevention\nand not for vengeance. An element in prevention is to secure in the\nperson punished the conviction of guilt\u201d (for a summary of this\ndebate see Bass 2002: 152\u2013161).\n\n\nOn November 21, 1945 Robert H. Jackson, Chief of Counsel for the\nUnited States at Nuremberg, began the case for the prosecution with\nthe following, now iconic words:\n The privilege of opening the first trial in history\nfor crimes against the peace of the world imposes a grave\nresponsibility. The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have\nbeen so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that\ncivilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot\nsurvive their being repeated. That four great nations, flushed with\nvictory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and\nvoluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is\none of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to\nReason. (Jackson 1945)\n\n\nThe prosecution team at Nuremberg had originally planned to\nconcentrate on charges of aggressive war rather than on Germany's\nwholesale destruction of Europe's Jews. Much of the initial legal work\nrevolved around the creation of a jurisprudence of conspiracy that\nwould allow the conviction of the entire Nazi leadership. But the\nliberation of the Dachau and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, and\nthe horrific evidence discovered there, left the allies with little\nchoice but to incorporate charges of crimes against humanity into\ntheir trial strategy (Bass 2002: 180).\n The defendants' complaints about \u201cvictors' justice\u201d\nand the retroactivity of the charges not withstanding (more on this to\nfollow), the Nuremberg trials still stand out as \u201clegalism's\ngreatest moment of glory\u201d (Bass 2002: 203). In spite of intense\npolitical pressure by Stalin, Churchill, and powerful figures inside\nthe United States to dispense with trials all together, and in spite\nof the unprecedented nature and magnitude of the crimes, the judges at\nNuremberg presided over a remarkably cool and orderly procedure. For\nthe first time in history, senior political leaders were indicted and\ntried for \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d\n\n\nThe tribunals also established important principles of international\njustice, such as the responsibility of heads of state, the rejection\nof the infamous \u201cI was just following orders\u201d excuse, the\nweakening of retroactivity as a defense against crimes of mass\natrocity, and the right of war criminals to a fair\n trial.[8]\n In addition to these\nimportant legal achievements, Nuremberg also established the trial as\nan invaluable instrument for creating a credible, lasting historical\nrecord of human rights abuses.\n\n\nThe Nuremberg trials were succeeded, in the spring of 1946, by the\nMilitary Tribunal for the Far East, held in Tokyo. Twenty-eight\nmembers of Japan's military and political leadership, including former\nPrime Ministers, War and Navy Secretaries, generals, diplomats, and\nsome economic luminaries were indicted for crimes against the peace.\nTwenty-five of the defendants were convicted. Seven were executed, and\nthe remaining 18 received prison sentences ranging between 7 years and\na life sentence.\n\n\nThe Tokyo proceedings never achieved the prominence of the Nuremberg\ntribunals. Explanations for their relative obscurity include the\nunavailability of some of the trial records, the fact that the\nperpetrators were not household names in the west, and the allies'\nembarrassment about disagreements between the judges on using the\ndeath sentence, and on the fairness of the proceedings (for more\ndetail see Futamura 2008 and Totani 2008).\n In spite of the ambitious standards of accountability for mass\natrocity set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, the actual practice of\ninternational criminal justice went into a prolonged lull once the\nCold War began. The sharp ideological differences between the\nsuperpowers made the cosmopolitan ideals underlying such trials less\npersuasive.  Concerned that war crime prosecutions would become one\nmore arena for political conflict, neither the Americans nor the\nRussians pursued them. The lull ended with the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion and the end of the Cold War, and the first significant war\ntribunals thereafter were established by the United Nations in the\n1990s\u2014the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia at The Hague (ICTY), in 1993, and the ad hoc International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania (ICTR), in 1995.\n The ICTY got off to a rocky start. Tribunal president Theodor\nMeron described it as \u201clittle more than an ideal\u201d at its\ninception in 1993. The trial, a symbolic \u201cexpression of\noutrage\u201d, served more as a salve for international guilt than\ninstrument of international justice. Financial resources were\ninitially so meager that the court could not afford to pay more than a\nfew months worth of rent and salaries (Bass 2002: Ch. 6). But in\nrecent years, the tribunal has come into its own. While the historic\ntrial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 could not be completed because of the\ndefendant's death, the ICTY indicted the first President of Republika\nSrpska (Bosnia and Herzogovina), Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, in July 2008. He is\ncurrently conducting his defense. Additionally, Ratko Mladi\u0107, the\nmilitary mastermind of the siege Sarajevo and the massacre of\nSrebenica, was arrested in northern Serbia on 26 May 2011 and is\ncurrently on trial in the Hague. Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107, another former\nPresident of Republika Srpska, was convicted of war crimes in\n2002.\n The final trial for the ICTY has recently commenced. Goran Had\u017ei\u0107,\nwho went from warehouse worker to rebel Serbian president, was\narrested in northern Serbia on July 20, 2011 after seven years as a\nfugitive. He has pled not guilty to \u201cinvolvement in the murder\nof hundreds of Croats\u201d as well as large scale expulsions. He is\nthe last of the 161 suspects indicted by ICTY to face trial. Had\u017ei\u0107,\nKarad\u017ei\u0107, and Mladi\u0107 were all arrested in Serbia after years on the\nrun from international justice. The impending terminus of the court's\nactivities underscores the transitory nature of such ad hoc war crimes\ntribunals.The court's annual budget is now upwards of $310 million and\nit employs more than 1,100 people from 82 countries. The ICTY has\nconvicted 64, acquitted 13, sent 13 for trial in domestic courts, and\nwithdrawn indictments against 36, including 16 who died after being\ncharged. Eighteen suspects are currently being tried, while 17 are\nappealing their convictions.\n\n\nThe tribunal often faced, and to some extent still faces, accusations\nof inefficacy. Ad hoc tribunals lack their own coercive power and rely\non the support of individual nation-states. Little progress was\ninitially made in the 1990s towards the capture of important war\ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was not then in a truly\ntransitional state such as found in Germany or Japan at the end of\nWWII, as the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who had\nsupported the Bosnian Serb commanders, remained in power. There was,\nas in other regions in which war crimes have occurred, hostility to\noutside monitoring and extranational justice. This was also seen to a\nlesser extent in Croatia. However, national (or domestic) justice\nproved itself to be overwhelmingly corrupt, biased, incompetent, and\ninadequate.\n\n\nOnly after Milo\u0161evi\u0107's fall from power did the new Serbian government\nbecome more amenable to cooperating with demands for international\njustice. The rebel Serbian leaders did and still do retain the\nsympathies of much of the Serbian population. External pressure points\nproved to be effective, as Serbia's government responded positively to\na carrot and stick approach known as the policy of\nconditionality. Serbia's European Union (EU) membership application\nwas blocked until Serbia complied and arrested the trio of Mladi\u0107,\nKarad\u017ei\u0107, and Had\u017ei\u0107. The principle behind conditionality does not\ndiffer significantly from the rationale behind sanctions regimes, such\nas those employed against apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia, and\n(currently) Iran.\n\nThe ICTR, located in Arusha, Tanzania, can also boast substantial\nachievements. The court has issued the first ever genocide conviction\nby an international tribunal, as well as the first conviction in which\nrape was considered a crime of war. Given the massive domestic\nprosecution of g\u00e9nocidaires by the Rwandan authorities, the\nICTR has primarily focused on the indictment of \u201cbig\nfish\u201d\u2014senior level suspects involved in the design and\nplanning of the genocide. These indictments have resulted in genocide\nconvictions of Rwanda's former Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, and\nquite a few cabinet members.\n\n\nIn addition to securing significant convictions and setting legal\nprecedents for the practice of international humanitarian law, the\nICTY and ICTR were also successful in creating detailed records of\natrocities. In this, both tribunals continued the legacy of the\nNuremberg Tribunals, which, as mentioned earlier, aimed not merely at\nthe conviction of the guilty but also at reliably documenting the\nhorrors for\n posterity.[9]\n\n\n\nA complaint consistently made against the ICTY and the ICTR has been\nthat these tribunals do not operate on the sites where the crimes\nbeing investigated took place. This fact, so the criticism goes,\ncreates a disconnect between the people who suffered throughout the\nwar and the process in which their suffering is addressed. The attempt\nto address such criticisms has resulted in the creation of a rather\ninnovative form of international justice\u2014the Internationalized\nor Hybrid Courts. These bodies, which have been operating in Bosnia\nHerzegovina (since 2005), Kosovo (since 2000), Cambodia (since 2003),\nSierra Leone (since 2002), East Timor (between 1999\u20132005), and\nLebanon (since 2007), employ both international and local jurists and\nadjudicate on the basis of a mixture of national and\n international\nlaw.[10]\n Unlike\nthe Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals none of the ad hoc tribunals such as\nthe ITCY and ITCR are empowered to impose the death penalty, though no\ncentralized prison exists to house those convicted.\n\n\nAmong the criticisms levied against the tribunals is their alleged\nWestern bias. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which in April of\n2012 convicted former Liberian leader Charles Taylor of aiding and\nabetting war crimes, was funded almost exclusively by the United\nStates, United Kingdom, Canada, and the Netherlands. The international\ncourts and the human rights which they embody are Western liberal\nconcepts with far less resonance in other parts of the world. Some\nhave questioned the tribunals are too focused on Africa, as all\npending cases currently are Africa-related. The Africa Union has\naccused the ICC of being an Euro-American neo-colonial enterprise,\nthough this may be taken with a certain pinch of salt, as many of the\nleaders within the African Union have good reason to believe that they\nmay one day be called to the defendant's docket.\n\n\nPerhaps the most significant development in international criminal\njustice since the Nuremberg trials has been the establishment, by the\nRome treaty in 1998, of the permanent International Criminal Court\n(ICC) in The Hague. By 2011, 114 nations had ratified the Rome\nStatute.  The court has jurisdiction over serious crimes (genocide,\ncrimes against humanity, aggression) committed after July 1, 2002\n(when the statute took effect), by a national of one of the states\nthat are party to the Rome treaty. It also has jurisdiction over\ncrimes committed on the territory of such state parties, or when the\nUN Security Council refers a specific case to it. The UN Security\nCouncil is authorized not only to refer cases to the court but also to\nask its prosecutor to suspend proceedings. Nevertheless, Security\nCouncil members Russia, China, and the United States have not ratified\nthe statute. This position is shared by several other major countries\nsuch as India, Indonesia, and Israel. Within the next several years,\ntribunals for Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Lebanon,\nand Cambodia will close, leaving the ICC as the sole institution of\ninternational criminal justice.\n\n\nImportantly, the court's authority is residuary: it acts only if\nmember nations cannot or will not.\n\n\nMost of the cases before the ICC involve ongoing conflicts. This has\nrequired the establishment of field offices in order to assist in\ninvestigations and the collection of evidence, as well as to conduct\noutreach operations to local populations. While there are immense\npractical difficulties in gathering evidence and enforcing arrest\nwarrants in active war zones, senior ICC officials have claimed that\ntheir real time involvement has increased deterrence.\n [11]\n\n\n\nSo far the ICC has taken up cases of war crimes committed in Uganda,\nthe Congo, and the Central African Republic. All three countries have\nreferred these cases themselves. In addition, the UN Security Council\nhas referred the case of Sudan, which is not a party to the Rome\ntreaty. After conducting an investigation into the referral, the\ncourt's prosecutor has recently issued an indictment against Sudan's\nPresident, Omar\n al-Bashir.[12]\n A decade after the courts creation, 22\narrest warrants have been issued, and five suspects currently are in\ncustody. Recently (as of July 2012), the United States has started to\napply pressure on President Paul Kagame of Rwanda to end his\nassistance to rebel factions in Congo renowned for their egregious war\ncrimes. The United States indicated that there might be a reduction in\nmilitary aid to Rwanda, but also that Kagame personally may face\nindictment and (ultimately) prosecution at the ICC.\n\n\nOne of the most innovative features of the ICC is the fact that it\ngives a significant role to victims in its proceedings. Victims can\nsend information directly to the court's prosecutor, they can request\nthe opening of a preliminary investigation, they can appear before the\ncourt's pre-trial chamber when it deliberates on whether to open a\nfull blown investigation into a case, and, most significantly, they\ncan ask to present their position during the trial itself. Article 68\n(3) of the ICC Statute reads:\n where the personal interests of the victims are\naffected, the Court shall permit their views and concerns to be\npresented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be\nappropriate by the Court and in a manner which is not prejudicial to\nor inconsistent with the rights of the accused to a fair and impartial\ntrial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal\nrepresentatives of the victims where the Court considers it\nappropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.\n(see Other Internet Resources for link to the full\ntext of the Rome Statute)\n\n  The exact jurisprudence regulating victims' involvement is still\n  being developed.  Yet, it is already clear that the Rome statute\n  gives them a far greater role in the international criminal process\n  than they have had under traditional tribunals.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the United States played a major role in the\nnegotiations surrounding the creation of the ICC, the U.S. initially\nvoted against the Rome Statute in 1998, before eventually signing in\nDecember\n 2000.[13]\n President George W. Bush revoked the\nUnited States' signature to the Rome Statute, citing concerns that the\ncourt could be used for political prosecution of American citizens,\nparticularly American service members who were serving abroad. The\nU.S. Congress passed several bills during the Bush Administration\ndesigned to shield American citizens from prosecution by the ICC. The\nUnited States has also threatened to cut off foreign aid to countries\nthat have failed to sign Bilateral Immunity Agreements with the\nU.S.\n\n\nAlthough the Obama administration has been much less hostile towards\nthe ICC, going so far as to co-sponsor a UN Security Council\nresolution which called for the ICC to investigate alleged crimes\nagainst humanity committed by Muammar Gadaffi, the United States has\nyet to join the\n ICC.[14]\n The United States continues to make\nimmunity for U.S. citizens a prerequisite to their ascension to the\nICC. \n",
