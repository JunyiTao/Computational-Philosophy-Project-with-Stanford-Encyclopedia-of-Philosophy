    "preamble": "\n\nMany philosophers maintain there is a significant difference between\nprimary and secondary qualities but disagree about its foundation. It\nmay be plausible that we perceive things as having a small number of\nbasic qualities which are determinates or degrees of the following:\nsize, figure, extension, duration, motion, position, color, taste,\nodor, sound, heat, coldness, and tactual qualities such as hardness,\nsoftness, roughness and smoothness. The first six (to which solidity\nand number are sometimes added) are called \u201cprimary\u201d;\nroughly speaking, they are said to be real objective properties of\nobjects and to be distinctly known. The remaining, called\n\u201csecondary\u201d, are said to be in some\nway\u2014metaphysically, epistemically,\nlinguistically\u2014derivative, less than fully real, or otherwise\nmetaphysically feeble; or misleading, subjective, ambiguous, or\notherwise not perspicuous. The lists map the extension of the division\nand the doctrine explains its basis.\n\nThe distinction presupposes that things we perceive by our senses are\nmind-independent material objects, or substances, which possess\nqualities and quantities, have relations, and take part in events.\nBases for the distinction come from the age-old attempt to learn what\nthere is in the natural world, manage it for our purposes, and attain\ntheoretical explanatory knowledge about it. They are located in the\nmaterial and structural aspects of the universe, the psychology of\nsense perception, and their intersection. John Locke\u2019s famous\ndistinction has notably different variants in the seventeenth century\nand all of them are disputed. Other versions are advanced and debated\nthrough the eighteenth century. Although the distinction ceases to be\nof much interest during the heyday of idealism, it attracts attention\nduring the mid to late twentieth century. More recently, questions\nabout color that can be traced to the seventeenth century have come to\nthe fore. (See M. Wilson 1992 on the early modern inheritance of\ntwentieth century debates. See also the entries on\n color,\n auditory perception, and\n touch.)\n\nInstead of trying to establish a canonical doctrine of primary and\nsecondary qualities, it is better to recognize the close temporal and\nconceptual connection between seventeenth century variants of the\ndistinction and the innovative non-Aristotelian theories of matter and\nsense perception inspired by Kepler\u2019s amendments to the\nCopernican astronomy. This article considers the seventeenth and\neighteenth century versions which have most influenced recent analytic\nphilosophy. There are two reasons for this restriction. First, the\nhistorical debates are nuanced and subject to several interpretations;\ncomparison helps to focus the questions they are meant to answer.\nSecond, more recent work on particular secondary qualities is heavily\ninfluenced by diverse philosophical movements and changing views of\nthe relation between philosophy and the sciences which cannot be\nadequately considered here (see Ross 2015). This entry uses the\nfollowing notational conventions: \u201cPQ\u201d stands for\n\u201cprimary quality\u201d; \u201cSQ\u201d, for \u201csecondary\nquality\u201d; additional designations are formed in obvious ways.\nThe name of one PQ or SQ is often used to indicate all qualities of\nthe same type, e.g., \u201cred, etc\u201d. indicates red and the\nother SQs.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Ancient Antecedents\n\nIt is not uncommon for historians to say seventeenth century advocates\nof the distinction of P/SQs take it from the ancient Greek atomists,\nLeucippus and Democritus. Evidence of this comes from fragments of\nDemocritus\u2019 works, such as:\n\n\nBy convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by\nconvention cold, by convention colours; but in reality atoms and void.\n(Taylor 1999: 9)\n\n\nC. C. W. Taylor (1999: 175\u20139) is among scholars who hold that\nthis corresponds to the modern distinction of P/SQs, but the\nattribution is problematic. It is true, that the properties of atoms\nare sharply divided from things that are by convention, including some\nSQs, but the problem is that the range of things by convention is\nunspecified in the fragments. Other scholars cite ancient testimony to\nthe effect that it is meant to include everything apprehended by sense\nperception (Lee 2011: 21\u20138; Pasnau 2007). If so, the ancient\ndistinction does not map onto a division between SQs and PQs that are\nsensible. Because the textual context of the fragments is now unknown\nand ancient testimony about it is conflicting, a definitive\ninterpretation is unlikely (Pasnau 2007).\n\nThe Atomists\u2019 theory is, however, in the spirit of an important\nstrain of the seventeenth century division of qualities. The ancients\nhold that reality is grasped solely by intellect. They accept two of\nParmenides\u2019 intelligibility constraints on change\u2014that one\nthing cannot come from many things and many cannot come from one; they\naim to construct a metaphysical system in which change under these\nconstraints is possible and the experience of non-conforming change is\nexplained (Taylor 1999: 160\u20134). Anaxagoras and Empedocles share\na strategy for explaining a sort of change under these constraints:\nbasic things, conceived either as the four elements or as stuffs and\nqualities, do not begin or cease to exist strictly speaking; but\nstates or relations of substances, conceived as either mixtures or\nseparations, have a qualified, or relative, being. Leucippus and\nDemocritus take a somewhat similar line: atoms moving in the void\nalways exist; they are indivisible, and never fuse along a common\nboundary, but bitter, sweet and the like are aggregates of atoms that\ncome to be by convention, or relatively (Taylor 1999: 160\u2013175).\nAtoms and the void are an a priori solution to a problem of\nintelligibility. Some later advocates of the P/SQ distinction, e.g.,\nGalileo and Descartes, hold that intellect provides a priori\nknowledge of the essences of things. But although variants of the\nlater distinction offer to explain the potentiality inherent in matter\nand the means by which change is regulated, the issues are not\npresented as a Parmenidian challenge to intelligibility. The target is\nrather the Aristotelian view that matter is potentiality and the\nbifurcated theory of accidental and substantial change. The influence\nof Parmenides on metaphysics in the modern era is complex, but\nadvocates of the doctrine of P/SQs as a group show little of it beyond\nadherence to ex nihilo nihil fit. Although atomism is\nprevalent in the early seventeenth century, it is often coupled with\nthe Aristotelian theory of elements (Kargon 1964). LoLordo (2011)\nargues that Gassendi\u2019s adaptation of Epicurean atomism makes no\ndistinction between PQs and SQs.\n2. Galileo Galilei\n2.1 The first known argument for a version of the P/SQ distinction\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the doctrine of qualities is first\nstated by Galileo Galilei. A paradigm-destroying natural philosopher\nfor whom \u201cthe book of nature is written in the language of\nmathematics\u201d (Galileo 1623 [2008: 179\u201383]; Crombie 1972).\nGalileo argues for the distinction in a section of The\nAssayer (1623). Having been asked to explain why he thinks it may\nbe possible that motion is the cause of heat, he produces a\nnon-technical sample of his distinctive method of answering questions\nthat arise in natural philosophy. The general method relies on\nintellect, thought experiments, hypotheses about things that are\nquantifiable, and sense perception of measurements that may testify to\ntheir reality (Crombie 1972: 72\u20134, 81\u20137; Piccolino and\nWade 2008, passim)). The argument goes as follows. We cannot\nconceive a corporeal substance without a determinate figure, size,\nposition, motion/rest, and number; nor can we imagine bodies separated\nfrom any of these attributes. Galileo calls them \u201cprimary\naffections\u201d of matter. By contrast, it is not necessary to\nconceive that a body have a color, taste, aroma, or make a sound; if\nwe lacked senses, intellect and imagination might never think of\nthem.\n\n\nThus, from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to\ninhere [these things] are nothing but empty names, rather they inhere\nonly in the sensitive body \u2026 [I]f one removes the animal, then\nall these qualities are \u2026 annihilated. (Galileo 1623 [2008:\n185])\n\n\nPrimary affections are essential to bodies; taste, smells, etc. are\ninessential to bodies and sensory faculties are essential to tastes,\nand the rest; so in the absence of sensory systems, there are no\ntastes, and the like.\n\nThe argument is elaborated by means of a thought experiment. Suppose\nyou run a hand over a marble statue and over the body of a human\nbeing. The hand does nothing but touch and move over the two bodies,\nbut when the animate body is touched, it feels sensations which vary\ndepending on where it is touched; e.g., a tickling sensation occurs\nwhen the hand makes contact with the sole of a foot or pit of an arm.\nThe argument continues: \u201cThe sensation is entirely ours and not\nat all in the hand \u2026 [I]t would be a great error\u201d to say\nthe hand has a property in addition to motion and touching, namely,\n\u201cthe power to tickle\u201d. Thr arumgent continues: a tickle\nsensation is entirely within the being who feels it; tickles plainly\nhave no reality unless they are felt; so if the sentient being is\nremoved, the tickle is nothing but an empty name; so it is possible\nthat tastes, etc. \u201chave a similar and no greater reality\u201d\n(Galileo 1623 [2008: 185\u20136]).\n2.2 A hypothesis about the corporeal causes of tastes, etc.\n\nThe basic hypothesis is that bodies need nothing other than\ndeterminate sizes, figures, etc. in order to arouse tastes, etc. in\nbeings that have sensitive organs. Without ears, tongues, and skin\naround armpits, there are no sounds, tastes, or tickles but only\nvarious shapes, motions,\n etc.[1]\n In particular, some bodies are constantly divided into tiny\nparticles; some of them rise, enter the nasal passages and start a\nprocess that ends with odors; others fall onto the surface of the\ntongue, mix with saliva and eventually produce tastes; tiny vibrations\nthat pervade the air make contact with the ear drums which connect\nwith other organs that produce sounds; finally, there is a particular\nsort of igneous particle found in fire which moves through pores of\nthe body and makes us warm. Many observations are brought in support\nof these hypotheses (Galileo 1623 [2003: 188\u20139]). Thought\nexperiments establish the possibility of this account. Two features of\nthe hypothesis are particularly important. First, it sketches a\nprogram of explanation for natural philosophy in which the distinction\nof PQs and SQs has an essential part (Crombie 1972: 80\u20137).\nSecond, it entails that SQs are not in bodies that cause them but\ninternal to sentient bodies\u2014effects of the mechanical affections\nof insensient bodies on the sensory organs of living bodies. Piccolino\nand Wade (2008: 1218\u201319, 1319\u201321) portray Galileo as\nadvocating the sort of explanatory program urged later by Hermann\nHelmholtz and presently pursued in neuro-psychology. (On\nHelmholtz\u2019 version of the P/SQ distinction, see Hatfield\n2011.)\n2.3 A non-Aristotelian account of the cognitive function of the senses\n\nThe mistake of supposing tastes, etc. are qualities that inhere in\ninanimate bodies is charged not to our senses, but to the use of\nlanguage. It seems we give names to the primary affections which we\nknow to exist in bodies and we give names to the sensations of our SQs\nas well. This makes us believe the names of the latter apply to bodies\njust as the names of the former do. According to Galileo, the names of\nSQs signify nothing when used in this way. This poses a challenge to\nthe traditional Aristotelian scholastic theory of sense perception.\nAccording to Aristotle, the nature of sentient beings assures that\nthey acquire perceptual knowledge in an environment such as ours. Some\ncare is called for, but no special effort is generally needed. On\nGalileo\u2019s theory, many sense perceptions are caused by\ninsensible particles whose properties are by no means easy to know.\nWhen a fire makes us warm, it is easy to feel the warmth but the rapid\nmotion of particles that causes it has to be discovered by rigorous-s\nuse of an effective method of natural philosophical inquiry.\n\nGalileo objects specifically to two principles of a contemporary\nversion of the Aristotelian stance: that mathematics is only\naccidentally applicable to material things and the doctrine of proper\nand common sensibles. A proper sensible is an object that is directly\nperceived by only one sense\u2014color, by sight alone; sound, by\nhearing, etc. The faculty and its proper object are said to be fitted\nto each other so that use of that faculty seldom results in\nmisperception of the quality special to it. By contrast, the common\nsensibles\u2014size. figure, motion/rest\u2014are directly perceived\nby more than one sense; as a result, we are supposedly more liable to\nmistakes about them. Galileo\u2019s objection reconceives the\ncondition that makes perception of a body veridical or deceptive.\n(Crombie 1972: 74\u20139; Piccolino & Wade 2008: 1312\u201315)\nHe argues that the appearance of a body corresponds to the properties\nof the body that are its cause;. It is not up to . philosophy to say\nhow various apearances are related to the affections of the objects we\nperceive; rather it requires the technical methods of natural\nphilosophy. For example, to avoid being deceived by the broken visual\nappearance of an oar half in water, we need to find the physical cause\nof the appearance. This will show that the visual appearance is\ncorrect. According to Galileo\u2019s epistemology, we should assume\nappearances do not exhibit the properties of their causes but rather\nsomething from which we may be able to figure them out.\n3. Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n3.1 Roots of the distinction\n\nDescartes formulates no distinction of P/SQs but familiar doctrines to\nwhich he is committed point to one. He maintains that his mechanist\ntheory of matter and motion can explain everything in the corporeal\nworld (CSM 1.285; AT\n 8.323).[2]\n He holds that bodies and minds are substances each of which can exist\nindependently of the other (CSM 2.54; AT 7.78). According to him,\nknowledge of continuous extension, and the sizes, figures, positions,\nand local motions of its parts, is innate in the human intellect, or\nmind (CSM 2.44; AT 7.63). By contrast, we know SQs only with aid of\nthe body (CSM 1.217; AT 8.33\u20134). The Cartesian P/SQ distinction\nimplicit in these doctrines has three roots:\n\nthe theory of ideas which is central to Descartes\u2019\nepistemology and psychology,\nthe unity of a finite substance in general,\nthe composite unity of a human being. Brief explanations\nfollow.\n\n3.1.1 Ideas\n\nIn Meditations an idea is said to be a mental act that is\n\u201clike an image\u201d (CSM 2.25; AT 7.37). Most scholars take\nthis to mean that ideas are presentational and intentional: we are\nacquainted with them and they direct thought to something else (M.\nWilson 1978: 102\u2013103; 1992: 69\u201383;). To apprehend anything\nat all (actual or possible) is to have an idea of it (CSM\n2.2.25\u201326; AT 7.37). Meditations explicates\nintentionality in terms of objective being: the idea of the sun is the\nsun \u201cexisting in the intellect in the way its objects are\nnormally there\u201d (CSM 2.75 and 27\u20138; AT 7.103 and 40; CSM\n1.198, note 1). As Descartes also puts it, ideas represent things\n(e.g., CSM 2.28; AT 7.40): an idea represents an object that is\nF just in case it represents the object as F (CSM\n2.145\u20136, 163; AT 7.207, 234). The representation may be sensory\nor intellectual (CSM 2.126, 127\u20138; AT 7.179, 181): its cognitive\nvalue may range from clear and distinct to confused or obscure (e.g.,\nCSM 2.29\u201330; AT 7.43; CSM 1.207, 317; AT 8.22\u20133,\n33\u201334).\n3.1.2 The substance-quality (mode) relation\n\nDescartes argues, in general: if a particular quality or affection\nexists, it must subsist or reside in a substance that makes it exist\n(CSM 2.114; AT 7.61; CSM 1.210; AT 8.25). The substance must have the\ncapacity to enable this particular quality to exist and any other\nquality in a range in which this one is included (CSM 2.124; AT 7.76)\nThe range is determined by its principal attribute, or essence: all\nqualities (or modes) of a substance are referred to its essence and\nunintelligible without it (CSM 1.210; AT 7.25; CSM 2.54; AT 7.78). So\nthe essence of a substance and all the qualities that do or can exist\nin it have reciprocal relations of conceptual dependence (Bolton 2013:\n65\u20136). Scholars characterize the relation in several\nways\u2014as that between an occult quality and its known effects\n(Malebranche 1674\u201375 [1980: 622]), the atomic structure of gold\nand its sensible and laboratory properties (Rozemond 1998: 92; Beck\n1965: 118\u201322), an absolute and its limits (Downing 2011:\n122\u201325). But Secada (2000: 190\u201394) cites a letter in which\nDescartes speaks of the relation as an instance of the more general\nrelation between two concrete things one of which is determined by the\nother (To Mersenne for Hobbes, 21 April 1641, CSM 3.178\u20139; AT\n3.355) Secada (also Bolton 2013) concludes the relation should be\nunderstood as that between a highest order determinable and its\ndeterminates.\n3.1.3 The union of mind and body\n\nIn addition to unities of nature (substances), Descartes recognizes\n\u201cunities of composition\u201d, for instance, the flesh and\nbones of the same animal-machine (CSM 2.285, 157; AT 7.423, 222).\nOther examples are a mouse, a human body and a human being. Such\nthings are ens per se: although they have parts that can\nexist outside them, the parts are then regarded as incomplete. So the\nmind/body unity is robust enough to tag a mind separated from its body\nas incomplete (To Regius, December 1641; CSM 3.200; AT 3.461). Brown\nand Normore (2019: 52\u201360) contend that things with this status\nhave a nature of the type Descartes calls \u201ctrue and\nimmutable\u201d (hereafter \u201cTIN\u201d). Anything with a TIN\nhas ground in reality indicated by its being the subject of\ndemonstrable truths; corporeal nature, geometrical entities and God\nare mentioned in Meditation 5 (CSM 2.44\u20135; AT\n7.63\u20135) and it is said to be true of Cartesian animals\n(Conversation with Burman, 16 April 1648; CSM 3.143\u20134; AT\n5.160). The bi-conditional test for things with a TIN is having a\nproperty that arises from the conjunction of all its ingredients (CSM\n2.84; AT 7.118; Brown & Normore 2019: 55\u201360). That is, the\ncomposite possesses some property that does not already belong to one\nof its parts, as in the case of Pegasus. For instance, a triangle\ninscribed in a square has a property the triangle does not have on its\nown, namely, having an area half that of the square that superscribes\nit (CSM 2.83\u20134; AT 7.117\u201318). Descartes maintains that the\nunion of mind and body has a TIN which would, if known, account for a\nhuman being\u2019s having appetites, emotions, and sensations of\ncolors, etc. (CSM 1.208\u20139; AT 8.23).\n3.2 Issues\n\nFour issues about Descartes\u2019 P/SQ distinction are prominent in\nrecent secondary literature:\n\nHow he purports to show that SQs as we sense them do not inhere in\nbodies\nThe metaphysical status of SQs\nWhether ideas of SQs are mere (non-intentional) presentations or\nalso intentional and if the latter, whether their content is internal\nor external\nHow the intellect affects sense perception of PQs by comparison\nwith SQs.\n\n3.2.1 An argument that bodies do not resemble SQs as we perceive them\n\nScholars have difficulty finding an argument purporting to show that\nheat, etc. as we sense it does not inhere in bodies. Some suggest that\nhis best argument is the intelligibility, simplicity, and explanatory\nadequacy of his mechanist theory (CSM 1.284\u201386, 288; AT\n7.121\u2013123, 326). But it is conclusive only in conjunction with\nthe norm expressed by Ockham\u2019s razor. (Downing 2011:\n113\u201314). Another problem is that Descartes writes that his\nmechanist physics explains the nature of light, heat, etc. because he\npresupposes that they are \u201conly in our senses\u2026 and not in\nthe objects we perceive by sense\u201d (Letter to Chanut,26 Feb 1649;\nCSM 3.369; AT 5.291\u20132). It is doubtful Descartes would advance\nthe explanatory adequacy argument unless he had an independent\nargument for the presupposition (for a different analysis, see Downing\n2011: 114).\n\nIt might seem Meditations offers such an argument. It states\nthat our most common mistake about ideas in general consists in\njudging that they resemble things outside us (CSM 2.26; AT 7.37). Some\nscholars take this to be an attack on Aristotelian realism, but the\nargument is elusive. The problem is that the context indicates that\nassuming resemblance is an epistemic mistake but not necessarily a\nfactual one (e.g., CSM 2.57; AT 7.82\u20133). That is, making the\nassumption is assenting to something we have no reason to think is\ntrue; but it may nevertheless be true. Perceptual realism about SQs\ntacitly goes by the board, but the opponent in view is the epistemic\nstance of those who formed the habit of implicitly relying on their\nsenses as children and never reflected on its value for acquiring true\nbeliefs. (For this interpretation of Descartes\u2019 method of doubt,\nsee Patterson 2007.)\n\nLisa Downing (2011: 115\u201317) argues that the first part of\nPrinciples of Philosophy (hereafter Principles),\narticles 66\u201371 provides basis for an a priori argument\nwhich Descartes could have had in mind but never stated. The articles\nexplain what we clearly and distinctly perceive about color, what we\nmight mistakenly judge about it, and what we can judge about its\nrelation to bodies without error. According to Principles\n1.71, sensations of heat, color, etc. \u201cdo not represent anything\nlocated outside our thought\u201d (CSM 1.219; AT 8.35) Based on this,\nDowning (2011: 118\u201328) constructs a valid argument to show ideas\nof SQs as we sense them cannot exit in a substance with the principle\nattribute extension. But she argues, it requires the principle\nattribute of a body to be absolute geometrical extension and modes to\nbe its limits. She finds this too restrictive to be tenable because it\nexcludes modes such as force and inertia and it is a model of the\nattribute-mode relation that cannot be applied to substances with the\nprincipal attribute thought.\n3.2.2 The metaphysical status of SQs\n\nA few scholars maintain that heat, e.g., is nothing other than a\nsensation on the strength of Principles 1.70\u201371 (Vinci\n1998: 199\u2013200; MacKenzie 1990: 114\u201316). However, the\nscientific writings offer mechanist accounts of light and color as\nspecific sorts of motions of insensible particles and suggest other\nSQs, too, are micro physical configurations (e.g., Optics,\nCSM 1.153, 155\u20136; AT 8.84\u20135, 88). Cottingham (1990:\n237\u201338) among others cites a text that may seem to identify\nsensible qualities with causal dispositions (CSM 1.285; AT\n 8.323),[3]\n but Wolf-Devine (1993: 46\u20138) convincingly argues that the\npassage refers to mechanist microstructures. Other commentators\nmaintain that Descartes either vacillates between mental and physical\nviews of color or has an inconsistent theory (M. Wilson 1992: 228,\n234; Wolf-Devine 1993: 46\u20138). However several more charitable\ninterpretations accommodate both. According to Atherton (2004),\nDescartes\u2019 opposition to certain scholastic doctrines motivates\na bifurcated theory of color consisting of a mechanist physiological\naccount paired with a mentalist psychological account of sense\nperception. She finds nothing that unites the parts of an essentially\ndualist theory of perception. According to Nolan (2011a), Descartes is\na nominalist about SQs: they are abstractions from experience that\nhave no de re counterparts. They are names we use to refer to\nboth certain ideas and certain bodily modes. However, it seems the\nstatus of SQs should be understood as that of entities that emerge in\nthe mind-body union in an environment such as ours (see Alanen 2005:\n147\u2013164; also Brown & Normore [2019: 185\u20136] who argue\nthat the union is a subject of predicates without mentioning SQs).\nThis view of SQs is explicit in Principles, Part I (CSM\n1.208\u201309; AT 8.22\u201323).\n3.2.3 The intentionality of ideas of SQs\n\nDescartes repeatedly says we mistakenly suppose the things represented\nby ideas of SQs resemble the ideas. Is it possible for ideas to\nrepresent things and yet be misleading about what they are? The issue\ncomes to a head in remarks about \u201cmaterially false\u201d ideas\nin Mediation 3. This is a non-judgmental sort of falsity\n\u201cthat occurs in ideas when they represent non-things as\nthings\u201d; for instance, ideas of heat and cold do not enable us\nto know whether one is the privation of the other, both are privative,\nor both are positive. Because there cannot be an idea that is not\nintentional, or of something, the idea that represents it as something\npositive should be called false (CSM 2.30; AT.7, 43\u201344). Arnauld\nobjects that on Descartes\u2019 theory, X cannot exist\nobjectively in the mind as something other than it is; were the idea\nof X materially false, it would not be an idea of X\n(CSM 2.145\u201346; AT 7.206\u201307). Three points in\nDescartes\u2019 reply are reasonably clear. First, material falsity\ndoes not have to do with the relation between an idea and its object\nbut with the mental operation that makes the object appear in a manner\nthat does not enable us to tell whether its object is privative or\npositive (CSM 2.162\u20133; AT 7.232). Second, ideas of SQs are\nconfused and obscure; they involve sensations which are often wrongly\ntaken to be the objects the ideas represent. Third, Descartes agrees\nwith Arnauld: the idea of cold, e.g., cannot represent cold as\nsomething it is not (CSM 2.164; AT 7.234; for a different\ninterpretation, see M. Wilson 1978: 114\u201316). The upshot is that\nideas of color etc. are confused. They provide opportunity for error\nbut are not erroneous representations (Hatfield 2011: 143\u2013148).\nScholars disagree about how to interpret these texts in an internally\nconsistent way. There are two basic positions:\n\nColors, etc. are non-intentional sensations;\nIdeas of color, etc. are intentional but confused or obscure.\n\nSQs are non-intentional sensations\n\nSeveral scholars urge that in Descartes\u2019 considered opinion, SQs\nare sensations without representative content (M. Wilson 1978:\n114\u201316; Vinci 1998: 196\u201398, 199\u2013200; MacKenzie\n1990). This is based on Principles 1.68 and 70, which say\nthat colors, etc, are clearly known when they are regarded merely as\nsensations and we make no error if we judge there is something in\nbodies whose nature we do not know which causes the sensations in us.\nBut these texts would mark a change of mind if they implied these\nideas represent nothing but what we clearly know. The scholars\nmentioned in the next section are among those who are not persuaded\nthat Descartes abandons the view of ideas of SQs in\nMeditation 3 and the exchange with Arnauld.\nIdeas of SQs are intentional and confused\n\nThere are two things advocates of this view have to explain: what the\nintentional objects of these ideas are and what is the source of the\nconfusion that stops short of misrepresentation. The literature offers\nseveral carefully developed accounts but brief descriptions will have\nto suffice here.\n\nSQ ideas do not intrinsically or presentationally represent\nmodifications of bodies but some texts imply they extrinsically\nrepresent things in our environment such as their causes (M. Wilson\n1990 [1999]; Schmaltz 1992). See De Rosa (2010: 69\u201393) for\ncritical discussion.\nSimmons (2001) maintains ideas of SQs have teleo-semantic content.\nThey represent things in the external world that are beneficial or\nharmful to the perceiver. This is critically discussed by Detlefsen\n(2013a) and De Rosa (2010).\nDe Rosa (2010: 117\u201361) argues that the idea of color has two\ncomponents: a manifest phenomenal presentation caused by interaction\nbetween parts of the body and the mind, and a latent clear and\ndistinct idea of the external corporeal cause of the idea. The idea\nmisrepresents the entity it represents because the representative\naspect is latent. See Paul and Morrison (2014) for critical\ndiscussion.\nLilli Alanen (2003: 147\u2013164) offers a comprehensive, complex\nand subtle account of materially false ideas. Two features of this\ninterpretation broadly considered can be mentioned here. Sensory ideas\nin general represent elements and events comprised in the mind/body\nunion and do so by virtue of the complex relation that unites the mind\nand body. To this extent, they are intrinsically representative and\nineliminably confused because the union is unintelligible to us. In\naddition, sensory ideas are signs of the external objects that cause\nthem, informing us of their existence, changes, and effects on us. In\nthis capacity, they have extrinsic content which is, again,\nincomprehensible to us. A second point is that sensory ideas comprise\nsensations and unnoticed judgments which accrue to them in childhood;\nsome of these judgments ascribe qualities to objects they do not have.\nIn this respect, ideas of SQs, and perhaps some PQs, are materially\nfalse.\nGary Hatfield (2013: 138\u2013148) offers another comprehensive\nand subtle account. Here we can sketch three points. Ideas of colors,\netc. are intrinsically representational; they represent by virtue of a\nsimilitude that is not phenomenally recognizable but understood with\nthe aid of metaphysics and natural philosophy. They manifestly\nrepresent external objects as having colors, being red, e.g., and they\nobscurely represent micro-structural modes of bodies. So they accord\nwith the account of material falsity in the Fourth Replies, i.e., they\ngive opportunity for false belief and still represent their objects as\nthey are. This comports well with relevant texts but the supposed\nsimilitude between SQs as we perceive them and configurations of\ninsensible particles in motion may strain credulity.\n\n3.3 Intellect\u2019s involvement in sense perception of PQs by comparison with SQs\n\nA related issue is whether intellect is involved in perceptual\nknowledge of PQs but not in perception of SQs, There are two main\npositions:\n\nSense perception of secondary qualities involves only the sensory\nfaculties whereas perception of PQs deploys knowledge provided by\nintellect (M. Wilson 1993 [1999: 26\u201340]; Maull 1980: 31 and\n33);\nBoth intellect and the perceptual faculty have important parts in\nproducing perception of PQs and SQs (Simmons 2003; Ort\u00edn Nadal\n2019).\n\n3.3.1 Perceptual knowledge is bifurcated\n\nAdvocates of the first position point to several texts:\n\nthe proof that in general, sensory ideas are caused by a substance\nthat has all the qualities we clearly and distinctly perceive to exist\nin corporeal substance; clear and distinct perception is intellectual\n(CSM 2.55; AT 7.80; CSM 1.223; AT 8.40\u201341);\nthe pragmatic non-theoretical purpose of sense perception (CSM\n2.57; AT 7.82\u20133; CSM 1.224;AT 8.42);\nthe theory that we see distance by a natural geometry\n(Optics, CSM 1.170; AT 6.137\u201380);\nthe doctrine that we know PQs and SQs of objects in quite\ndifferent ways: \u201cour knowledge of what it is for an object to\nhave a shape is more clear than our knowledge of what it is for it be\ncoloured\u201d (CSM 1.18\u20139; AT 8.34).\n\n\nIn opposition, critics note that most of these passages concern\nfeatures of sense perception in general and the one exception is a\npassage that does not apply to sensory knowledge at all.\n\nPerception of the particular figures of particular things is less\ncertain than our knowledge that figures, etc. exist in the causes of\nour sensory ideas in general (CSM 2.27, 55, 57; AT 7.39, 80, 83); we\nmake mistakes about the size and distance of the sun.\nSense perception in general has a pragmatic purpose (CSM 2.57; AT\n7.82\u20133).\nOur initial visual ideas of distance are, like our initial ideas\nof all sensible qualities, direct effects of motions in and around the\npineal gland (Optics, CSM 1.167; AT 6.130; Hatfield\n2015).\nThe greater clarity of our knowledge of PQs is not manifested by\nsense perception but by reflection on what we know a priori\nabout the nature of corporeal substance and its modes (Ort\u00edn\nNadal 2019: 1129\u201331).\n\n3.3.2 Perceptual knowledge is unified\n\nIn support of the second position, Simmons (2003) constructs an\nargument based on the three grades of sensory response defined in\nSixth Replies (CSM 2.294\u201396; AT 7.437\u201339) and\nphysiological and psychological accounts,in Optics and\nTreatise on Man, of the operations that form experience in\nearly childhood. In brief: the first grade of sensory involvement\nstarts with impingement of particles on the organs of sense and\nincludes all their physiological effects; the second grade comprises\nthe immediate effects produced in the mind as a result of its union\nwith a body provided with sensory organs; the third grade, which is\nthe first to involve intellect, comprises all the \u201cjudgments\nabout things outside us we are accustomed to making in\nchildhood\u201d (CSM 2.295; AT 7.437). Simmons argues that the early\nscientific works ascribe two sorts of judgments to\nintellect\u2014those that falsely project resemblance and those that\nconstruct the appearances of sensible things. She finds that the\nlatter are associative cognitive acts that connect sensations of\nqualities with images drawn from memory (Simmons 2003: 554; on images\nand the intellect, see Letter to Mersenne, July 1641, CSM 3.186; AT\n3.395). The model of clear and distinct perception promoted in\nDescartes\u2019 later philosophical works hardly fits the\nconstruction of images and ill-considered judgments that engage the\nintellect of a young child (on the diversity of intellectual\noperations, see Simmons (2003: 565\u201375,\n 77\u20138).[4]\n The upshot is that sense perception of the world features PQs and SQs\nand its purpose is practical rather than scientific (CSM 2.57\u20138;\nAT 7.83; CSM 1.223\u20134; AT 8.41\u201342.) Once we attain clear\nand distinct a priori perception of the essence and\nproperties of bodies, we are unable to conceive how a body could\nresemble a sensory presentation of color, etc.\n\nAccording to Ort\u00edn Nadal (2019: 1129\u20131132), the\nfundamental difference between qualities of the two types is not that\nideas of SQs provide more material for error; in perception, specific\nideas of both sorts can misrepresent particular physical causes. They\ndiffer with regard to the mistakes we can make about their causes. To\njudge that a body resembles the sensation of a color is to error about\nthe nature of matter, whereas to make an error about the determinate\nPQ of a particular object is still to know that it has the\ndeterminable quality it comes under.\n4. Robert Boyle\n\nRobert Boyle\u2019s variant belongs more to philosophy of science\nthan theory of perception. It is integral to the corpuscular theory\n(hereafter \u201cCT\u201d), the mechanist natural philosophy he\npromotes. He is an avid experimentalist and prolific author of works\non ethics, theology, natural religion, and both alchemical and\nmechanist natural philosophy (Stewart 1991: xi\u2013xii,\nxv\u2013xvi; Anstey 2000: 9). Boyle strongly opposes any intrusion of\nmetaphysical and logical entities in natural philosophy (Boyle 1666\n[1991: 3, 8, 22, 28]; Stewart 1991: xiii). The targets are\nSuarez\u2019s real qualities and scholastic accidental and\nsubstantial forms. The former, as Boyle understands them, are entities\nthat naturally inhere in material substance but have independent\ncausal powers (see Boyle 1666 [1991: 21\u20132]). Boyle avoids\ncontroversial metaphysical doctrines that divide mechanists, such as\nEpicurean atomism, innate motion, Cartesian essences and the endless\nactual separation of parts of bodies (1666 [1991: 7\u20138]).\nAccording to CT, observable bodies are composed of very small\nrelatively stable corpuscles, composed of minima naturales\nwith tightly cohering parts rarely separated in nature (Anstey 2000:\n10\u201311, 43\u20134).\n\nBoyle\u2019s best known work in natural philosophy is The Origin\nof Forms and Qualities According to the Corpuscular Philosophy\n(1666) (hereafter \u201cOFQ\u201d). A large part of OFQ is devoted\nto reports of experiments intended to show the superiority of CT over\nits scholastic and chemical competitors (OFQ [1991: 18]; also Boyle\n1674). According to the theoretical part, matter is one extended\nimpenetrable substance to which motion in accord with contingent laws\nis added by God. Local motion, the \u201cgrand agent\u201d of\nnatural change (OFQ [1991: 19]), divides matter into parts, each\nmodified by a determinate size, shape, and local motion. The\ncorresponding determinable modifications are inseparable from every\npart of matter, and designated \u201cprimary\u201d because they are\nsimple, primitive, and sufficient to derive all qualities (OFQ [1991:\n97]). Texture, a fourth primary modification, is the configuration,\ni.e., mutual orientation and order, of the corpuscular parts of a body\n(OFQ [1991: 30]). Texture is composed of the primary affections of\nmany insensible particles which jointly form a novel modification that\nnone of the particles has by itself, much as TINs do for Descartes.\nAll four primary affections are intrinsic properties. Boyle calls them\n\u201cmechanical affections\u201d (hereafter \u201cMAs\u201d)\nbecause, he says, the operations of machines are commonly explained by\nthem (OFQ [1991: 18\u201321]). The stated aim of OFQ is\n\n\nto make it probable by experiment \u2026 that almost all sorts of\nqualities \u2026 may be produced \u2026 by corporeal agents\n\u2026 that work [only] by virtue of motion, size, figure, and\ncontrivance of their own parts. (OFQ [1991: 17])\n\n\nQualities are entities of a different type: causal capacities and, for\nthe most part, relations between two bodies (OFQ [1991: 13,\n23\u201330]). The terms \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d\nare treated as synonyms. The quality-making relation is not fully\nexplicit. A relation of congruence, or fit, between the MAs of the two\nbodies is often mentioned; spatial temporal co-incidence is implicit;\nconnections with other things in the environs are suggested\n(O\u2019Toole 1974; Kaufman 2006: 166\u2013173). The relational\ntheory is motivated by arguments of two sorts (OFQ [1991:\n23\u201330]). One is illustrated by the legend that the first lock\nwas forged without a key; Boyle argues that when a piece of metal of a\ncertain size and shape was subsequently made, the lock acquired the\npower to be worked; so the power to be worked and the power to work\nare relations between the key and the lock; but in the bodies\nthemselves there is nothing distinct from their sizes, figures,\nmotions and those of their parts. The second is an argument from\nparsimony. If every new quality a body acquired added something to the\nbody itself, it would contain a vast number distinct entities that\nserve no physical purpose.\n\nAnstey (2000: 52) maintains that qualities have a reductive structure:\nMAs are not powers and qualities, which are powers, are reduced to\ntheir respective MAs. The quality is, then, explained by its\nconstituents: the congruent mechanical affections of a pair of bodies\nexplain what happens when one is duly applied to the other in terms\nthat are intelligible and familiar from our understanding of machines.\nBoyle repeatedly claims that in the bodies that constitute qualities,\nthere is nothing distinct from their MAs, but often remarks that\nqualities derive from or depend upon the MAs of bodies. Anstey is one\nof several scholars who find a tension between these two claims. The\nworry is that \u201cnothing distinct from\u201d expresses\nontological reduction; that the dependence in view is asymmetric; and\na thing cannot have an asymmetric relation to itself.\n\nThe tension is at the center of one of the two main scholarly\ndisagreements about Boyle\u2019s theory of qualities. The other\nquestions whether he consistently adheres to the relational theory or\nretreats to a monadic notion of dispositive qualities in some\npassages.\n4.1 Are qualities reduced to mechanical affections of bodies or dependent on them?\n\nThis is usually discussed in connection with qualities of the sort\nBoyle calls \u201csensible\u201d. These are our SQs\u2014in fact,\non two occasions, Boyle refers to them as \u201csecondary\nqualities\u201d. Sensible qualities are present in bodies that\noperate on human beings so as to cause the sort of ideas on account of\nwhich we ascribe colors, etc. to bodies. Names given to the various\nideas of SQs are also used to designate the corresponding qualities,\nso \u201ccolor\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, etc. can be used to stand\nfor qualities in the scope of corpuscularian explanation (OFQ [1991:\n24, 30\u20134, 51\u20132]). Boyle is a Cartesian mind-body dualist.\nAlthough he discusses perception in several texts, he has no well\ndeveloped account (see Anstey 2000: 68\u201385). OFQ sticks to the\nphysical project announced at the start.\n\nScholars have taken five basic positions on this question.\n\nPeter Alexander (1974: 229\u2013238; 1985: 73\u201385) argues\nthat qualities that are sensible are textures, but colors, green,\nblue, etc. are nothing but mind-dependent sensations. But textual\nevidence of this is compromised by the ambiguity of names of SQs\n(Anstey 2000).\nMackie (1976: 14\u201315) suggests SQs are dispositions based on\nthe intrinsic MAs of the bodies to which the qualities belong, The\nmain problem is that the texts do not clearly articulate the\ndistinction between a disposition and its basis in things that are so\ndisposed. Boyle\u2019s terminology is unstable across different\nworks, and less than precise (Stewart 1991: xiv), and the texts focus\non the horizontal two-place relation between bodies (or bodies and\nperceivers) that form a quality without saying much about the vertical\npresumably three-place relation between a quality and two sets of\nMAs.\nAccording to Anstey (2000: 105\u201307), Boyle\u2019s natural\nphilosophical work shows a deep interest in framing hypotheses about\nthe corpuscular constitutions of specific qualities, i.e., physical\nreductions of qualities deemed possible, but his work also exhibits a\ndeep investment in the CT which states that MAs are basic and\nqualities are dependent entities which are explained by them. Anstey\nconcludes these commitments are inconsistent and irreconcilable.\nKeating (1993) argues that Boyle\u2019s strong inclination toward\nthe reduction of qualities to MAs pushes him to say that colors, etc.\nare mind-dependent sensations.\nO\u2019Toole (1974: 307\u201313; followed by Kaufman (2006:\n190\u20131)) argues that for Boyle, qualities are relational\nproperties of bodies rather than intrinsic to any one body. He notes\nthat the texts taken to say the SQs of a pair of bodies are identical\nto their MAs actually say that in each body there is nothing but its\nMAs while saying the quality is a relation over and above that We\nmentioned congruance and spatial and temporal co-existence; means of\napplying one body to the other are also suggested.\n\n4.2 The \u201cdispositive sense\u201d of having a sensible quality\n\nSensible qualities pose a particular problem, one that is said to be\nthe \u201cchiefest difficulty\u201d for CT: \u201cit seems evident\nthat [colors, odors, and the like] have an absolute being\nirrelative to us\u201d (OFQ [1991: 32]). Two reasons are given:\n\nsnow would be white and a glowing coal would be hot if there were\nno sentient beings and\nthe heat of the coal would still melt ice and warm wax if sentient\nbeings were taken away.\n\n\nBoyle does not deny that the objection has some basis in fact but\ncontends it is consistent with CT (OFQ [1991: 32\u201337]). That is,\nthe absolute, non-relational, nature of colors, etc. seems evident for\nmisguided reasons that Boyle traces to Suarezian metaphysical\nassumptions. With regard to (b), his long response makes the point\nthat it is not heat but the insensible corpuscular constitutions of\nbodies that are hot that have the power to melt ice according to CT.\nThe response to (a) is a matter of controversy. It specifies a\n\u201cfavorable sense\u201d in which it can be said that bodies\nwould have sensible qualities if there were no sentient beings; but,\nBoyle contends, it does not suffice to establish that SQs are\nabsolute.\n\nAs Boyle explains it, the dispositive sense is conveyed by this: If\nthere were no perceivers, snow, which is actually cold, would in\nvirtue of its corpuscular constitution, be such that if it were\napplied to the tactual sensory organs of an animal, it would produce\n\u201csuch a quality (sic)\u201d, whereas a body, which does not\nactually have a SQ, would not produce such a quality. This is to be\n\u201cdispositively\u201d cold, or \u201cfit\u201d to be cold, but\nactually to be endowed only with certain MAs (OFQ [1991: 31]). Why\nwould the lack of competent perceivers prevent snow\u2019s being cold\ngiven that snow need not be perceived in order to be cold?\n\nAnstey (2000: 103) takes this to be a retreat from the relational\ntheory. Curley (1972: 448\u201350) finds Boyle ambiguous and\nmistaken. Stewart (1991: xiv) holds that instability in Boyle\u2019s\nuse of terms precludes a definitive interpretation. However, Kaufman\n(2006) argues that the dispositive sense is consistent with the\nrelational theory and as Boyle says, part of his defense of it. As\nKaufman sees it, the theory of qualities is a consequence of\nBoyle\u2019s method in natural philosophy, especially his commitment\nto reasoning from nothing but observational data and antipathy to\na priori argumentation. It is possible here to give only a\nrough sketch of two important points of this interesting, detailed,\nand complicated interpretation.\n\nFirst, Kaufman (2006: 175\u201385) notes that if a body that has MAs\nin virtue of which it is dispositively cold is not actually cold, then\nit might seem that the relational account of qualities is expendable.\nOne reason is that from the fact that a body is dispositively cold and\nthe tenets of any adequate mechanist theory, we can predict and\nexplain what the body would do if it were applied to the tactual organ\nof a perceiver; so it might seem that CT can do without relational\nqualities. According to Kaufman, this is not right. This is said to be\nbecause by Boyle\u2019s empiricist lights, we have no way of knowing\nwhat would happen if snow and the right sort of perceiver were to come\ntogether except by observing the event. The point is that we cannot\nattribute dispositive coldness to a body unless such bodies have, or\nonce had, the relational quality cold.\n\nSecond, as Kaufman (2006: 186\u201390) describes it, Boyle maintains\nthat the MAs of snow in the actual world are de re identical\nto the MAs of snow in a world without perceivers, but Boyle wants to\nsay snow is cold in the actual world and only fit to be cold in the\nperceiverless world. This is problematic because it seems there is no\nrespect in which they could be different. Kaufman suggests a solution\nalong the following line. Because CT states that a body gains or\nlooses a quality if its relatum begins or ceases to exist and Boyle\nrecognizes a difference between a body\u2019s having a quality and\nsomeone\u2019s knowing that it does, he maintains that a body has a\ndispositive quality in virtue of how someone thinks of its MAs. That\nis, under the condition that animals are, or are assumed to be, absent\nfrom the world, a corpuscularian may reasonably think of the MAs of\nsnow as being fit to manifest cold were they to operate on a competent\nperceiver. That marks the difference between the MAs of snow in a\nperceiverless world and in the actual world, yet in the latter snow is\nnot cold. On this interpretation, dispositive qualities are beings of\nreason with a foundation in things (Kaufman 2006: 190).\n5. John Locke\n5.1 Locke\u2019s argument for the distinction of P/SQs\n\nAlthough Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n(1689\u201390) (hereafter Essay or E, cited by Book,\nChapter, and Section number) contains the canonical distinction, it is\nan inquiry into the origin, limits and sufficiency of human cognition.\nIt is not meant to contribute to theoretical natural philosophy, but\nto expose abuses of language that hamper it (E [1975: 9\u201310]).\nLocke\u2019s attitude toward CT is mixed: he points to its failure to\naccount for the cohesion of the parts of matter and communication of\nmotion (E 2.23.26, 28) but holds it up as the hypothesis that\n\u201cgoes farthest in an intelligible Explanation of the Qualities\nof Bodies\u201d, (E 2.23; 4.3.12\u201313).\n\nThat PQs and SQs are placed in the same category, that of things that\nsubsist in substance, reflects Locke\u2019s interest in what we know\nby means of the senses. For him, substance and quality are inseparble.\nSo if we know that qualities exist, we can rightly infer there is a\nsubstance in which they inhere, and we know qualities exist because we\nreceive ideas of sensation caused by substances. Ideas of sensation\nare one of two sorts of ideas which are the simple elements of all our\nthoughts and can only be acquired in experience according to Locke.\nEssay, book 2, chapter 8, which exposits and defends the\ndistinction of PQs and SQs, comes immediately after five chapters that\ndefine and classify simple ideas. The sixth breaks down the relation\nbetween simple ideas of sensation and qualities in order to show that\nmost of the former do not resemble the later.\n\nThe argument of Essay 2.8 can be divided into seven\nstages.\n\nFirst, sections 1\u20136 urge that privations, e.g., rest and\ndarkness act as causes just as their positive opposites do.\n\nSecond, sections 7\u20138 distinguish qualities and ideas:\n\n\nWhatsoever the Mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of\nPerception, Thought, or Understanding, that I call Idea; and\nthe Power to produce any Idea in our mind, I call Quality of\nthe Subject wherein that power is. (E 2.8.8)\n\n\nA snowball has powers to produce ideas of white, cold, and round; the\nmind possesses the ideas. The point is that ideas are intentional and\nontologically distinct from the qualities. Yet Locke says he will\nsometimes speak of ideas as in the subjects but should be understood\nto mean qualities of the subjects that cause the ideas in us. This is\nsaid elsewhere to comply with ordinary ways of speaking (E 2.32.2).\nLocke apparently sees little harm in indulging this once it is\nunderstood that it cannot be correct. This is one of several ordinary\nbut inexact uses of language that play a role in Locke\u2019s theory\nof qualities; on civil and philosophical uses of language, see\nEssay 3.9.3.\n\nThird, sections 9\u201310 introduce the distinction of primary\nqualities, secondary qualities, and a sub-species of the latter. There\nis a criterion by which PQs are selected: inseparability from bodies\nin whatever state they may be\u2014in perception, conception, all\nalterations bodies undergo, and in an imaginary act of repeatedly\ndividing a sensible particle into insensible parts. Secondary\nqualities are characterized as\n\n\nnothing in the Objects themselves, but Powers to produce various\nSensations in us by their primary Qualities, i.e., by the Bulk,\nFigure, Texture and Motion of their insensible parts. (E 2.8.10)\n\n\nThe sub-species includes attributes such as the sun\u2019s power to\nmelt wax and thereby give it the power to cause ideas of warmth.\nAccording to Locke, these attributes are commonly regarded as powers\nbut are \u201cas much real Qualities in the Subject, as those which I\nto comply with the common way of speaking, call Qualities,\nbut for distinction, secondary Qualities,\u201d (E 2.8.10; E\n2.31.2) Recall that Boyle uses the traditional term \u201csensible\nqualties\u201d to signify warmth, color, etc. So SQs are designated\nby the term \u201cquality\u201d but are wrongly supposed to be\nqualities. More on this in stage seven.\n\nFourth, sections 12\u201314 declare it is \u201cmanifestly by\nimpulse\u201d that ideas are caused in minds (E 2.8.11). A\nlittle reflection is taken to show that when we perceive a body,\nmotions of insensible particles convey motions to parts of our bodies\nthat ultimately result in sensory ideas. If it is true that bodies\nacton our sense only by impulse, this is a reason to accept the\ncharacterization of SQs in Essay 2.8.10.\n\nFifth, sections 15\u201321 state and defend what is commonly called\nthe \u201cResemblance Thesis\u201d (hereafter \u201cRT\u201d). It\nhas a positive and a negative part: ideas of primary qualities\nresemble features of the bodies that cause them\u2014\u201ctheir\nPatterns do really exist in the Bodies themselves\u201d\u2014but\n\u201cthere is nothing like the ideas [of SQs] in the bodies\nthemselves\u201d (E 2.8.15). This is presented as an evident\nconsequence of the claims in sections 8 through 14. The sections that\nfollow argue directly for the positive and negative assertions.\n\nThe negative claim is supported by at least two lines of thought. The\nfirst ascribes the common belief in the resemblance of SQs and their\nideas to a misguided metaphysical theory implicit in a common way of\nspeaking: \u201cFlame is denominated Hot and Light\n\u2026 from the ideas [it produces] in us\u201d (E 2.8.16). But,\nLocke argues, fire causes ideas of both heat and pain and we have no\nmore reason to think heat resembles something in the fire than that\npain does (E 2.8.16). Many scholars take the remark about use of\nlanguage to say we give the same names to sensations and the qualities\nthat cause them (e.g., Ayers 1991: 63\u20134), but although this\nmight account for the assumption that ideas are in substances, which\nLocke indulges, it hardly explains belief in idea-quality resemblance.\nJacovides (2007b) convincingly argues that the usage to which Locke\nrefers is paronymous, i.e., the name of one thing is given to\nsomething which has a certain relation to the one but with a change of\nending. Locke speaks of the names of general ideas of kinds of things\nin this way; e.g., we are denominated \u201chuman\u201d from the\nabstract idea, humanity (E 3.8.1). In Essay 2.8, ideas\nproduced by SQs are almost always given names of abstract ideas:\n\u201csweetness\u201d, \u201cwarmth\u201d, etc. Jacovides suggests\nLocke\u2019s point is that the paronymous use of names of ideas of\nSQs may convey that there is something in objects that gives them\ntheir colors, etc. The second argument against resemblance questions\nwhy warmth, etc. is supposed to resemble something in bodies but pain\nis not (E 2.8.16).\n\nIn support of the positive resemblance between PQs and ideas of them,\nLocke appeals to practical action: it is by being moved from\nA to B that a body causes the idea of its motion\nfrom A to B. so the idea represents motion \u201cas\nit really is\u201d in the body (E 2.8.18); \u201cA Circle or Square\nare the same whether in Idea or Existence.\u201d (E 2.8.18)\nQuick as this argument is, it is taken to show that motion and figure\n\u201care really in bodies whether we take notice of them or\nno.\u201d (E 2.8.18) The following sections 19 through 21 propose\nthought experiments regarding the color of porphyry in the presence\nand absence of light, the taste of an almond before and after a\npounding, and a bowl of water in which one person has placed both\nhands one of which has been in ice water and the other in hot water.\nCurley (1972) decisively argues that none of this is meant to show\nthat appearances of SQs\u2014unlike PQs\u2014are perceiver relative\nunreliable bases on which to judge the properties of things we\nperceive. But scholars have had difficulty seeing what the examples\nare intended to show: whether to substantiate the resemblance thesis,\nthe corpuscular theory, or the reality of qualities and non reality of\npowers. For different views, see, e.g., Alexander (1985:\n124\u201329), Atherton (1992), Lowe (2005: 51\u20132), Rickless\n(2014: 88\u201393), McCann (2011: 175\u20136). Robert Wilson (2004:\n204\u201306); on the color of porphyry, Stuart (2003) and Jacovides\n(2007b: 641\u20132).\n\nSeventh, sections 22\u20136 stress that PQs are real qualities\nwhereas SQs are imputed qualities. Two things are said to mark PQs as\nreal:\n\nmind-independence: PQs are in bodies whether they are perceived or\nnot (E 2.8.23); bodies would have them if there were no sensible\nbeings (E 2.31.2) and\nthe dependence of SQs on PQs of insensible particles (E\n2.8.23).\n\n\nThe vast secondary literature on this doctrine raises a large number\nof debatable questions. The following issues are considered here\nbecause they are particularly important for understanding what is\ndistinctive about Locke\u2019s version of the P/SQ distinction:\n\nWhether SQs are a sort of quality or a sort of power\nThe epistemic basis of the criteria of PQs\nThe metaphysical status of SQs\nWhat it is for the idea of a PQ to resemble a PQ of a body\naccording to Locke.\n\n5.2 Issues\n5.2.1 Are SQs qualities or powers?\n\nEssay 2.8 speaks of qualities, real qualities, imputed\nqualities, powers, and mere powers. Which difference coincides with\nthe distinction of P/SQs? Locke\u2019s report of what he calls\n\u201cquality\u201d in the subject, unlike the report of what he\ncalls \u201cidea in the mind\u201d, is often taken to be a\ndefinition (Curley 1972: 443; Rickless 2014: 84; Jacovides 2007a:\n110\u201311; Stuart 2013: 34\u20139). Accordingly, Curley (1972:\n443\u201345) argues roughly as follows. For Locke, all qualities are\npowers to cause ideas by definition, but SQs are such powers and only\nimputed to be qualities. So SQs are not consistently said to be\nqualities; but they are consistently said to be powers. He concludes\nthat there are, for Locke, two sorts of powers and the famous\ndistinction is based on RT. One problem is that RT is presented as a\nconsequence of the P/SQ distinction, not the source of it (R. Wilson\n2015: 200; Rickless 2014: 88).\n\nJacovides (2007a: 111\u201312; also Mackie 1976: 14\u20135) holds\nthat qualities are defined as powers and argues that this is\nconsistent with saying that SQs are powers and not qualities because\nLocke\u2019s notion of power is ambiguous as shown by this:\n\npower is an ability to do something which neither causes nor\nexplains its manifestations, e.g., the ability to digest does not\ndigest (E 2.21.20)\npower is \u201cthe source from which action proceeds\u201d, and\n\u201cwhen they [sc. powers of substances] are exerted into act, they\nare called \u2018causes\u2019\u201d (E 2.22.11).\n\n\nBut these texts contain only one notion of power: (a) argues that\npowers are not exerted by powers, but by substances\u2014the will\ndoesn\u2019t will; (b) identifies substances that exert their powers\nwith causes.\n\nWe can suggest a different solution. Locke\u2019s remarks about what\nhe calls \u201cidea\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d in E 2.8.8 are\nnot definitions by his lights; see E 3.3.15\u20137 on real and\nnominal essence. They are more like sufficient conditions for being\ndesignated by the terms \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cquality.\u201d\nBeing a power is sufficient for being designated by\n\u201cquality,\u201d as shown by color, etc., but it is not\nnecessary, as shown by the PQs of insensible particles which are not\npowers to cause ideas, but constituents of such powers. McCann (2011:\n59\u201367) argues that the PQs found in the microstructures of\nbodies are the causes of both ideas of SQs and ideas of the PQs of\nsensible bodies. He urges a divsion of types of PQs based on a\ndivision of labor\u2014insensible PQ are primary PQs whereas PQs of\ngross bodies are secondary PQs. For other solutions to the present\nissue, see Rickless (2014: 85), Stuart (2013: 34\u20139), R. Wilson\n(2015: 207\u20138).\n5.2.2 Epistemic basis of the criteria for PQs\n\nThe view that Locke argues for the distinction of P/SQs, at least in\npart, from the truth or adequacy of the CT (held by Alexander 1985:\n111\u201330; Mackie 1976: 17\u20138) is met with two objections:\nLocke\u2019s main interest in Essay Book 2 is in ideas\n(Atherton 1992) and Locke endorses neither the truth nor adequacy of\nCT (Ayers 2011: 136\u20137; Downing 1998; McCann 2011:\n179\u201385).\n\nRobert Wilson (2015) argues that there are four inseparability\ncriteria for primary qualities; two pertain only to sensible bodies\nand the others form a transdictive inference, i.e., an inductive\ninference from what is true of all sensible bodies to what is true of\ninsensible ones (on transdictive arguments, see R. Wilson 2002).\nStuart (2013: 46\u201352) objects that limiting two modes of\ninseparability to sensible bodies lacks textual support. Stuart\nmaintains that the criteria for PQs are the same as those for ideas\nincluded in the general abstract idea of body. But Jacovides (2007a:\n115) points out that Locke\u2019s account of this idea includes only\nextension, solidity, and capacity to communicate motion, not the full\nroster of Locke\u2019s PQs (see E 2.23.22).\n\nMichael Ayers (2011: 138\u201342) suggests Locke\u2019s distinction\nof qualities can be seen not as a consequence of the virtues of CT but\nas a source of its perspicuity. On this reading, the argument of\nEssay 2.8 is a pre-theoretical philosophical reflection on\nthe variety of affections bodies are observed to have and the\nintelligible mechanical interactions among observable solid rigid\nbodies.\n\nDowning (2007: 354\u201359) argues that the inseparability criteria\nare part of a corpuscularian argument for the distinction of qualities\nwhich accords with our natural understanding of physics. Locke does\nnot endorse the adequacy or truth of CT but, she contends, he regards\nit as an imperfect example of an ideal demonstrative physics which\nwould deduce all operations of bodies from their real essences, or\ninternal constitutions (see E 3.3.15; 4.6.11). She suggests\nEssay 2.8.8 through 14 makes an argument that relies on the\nimplicit ideal (see E 3.3.17). (See Ayers 1981, also Downing 1998)\n\nMcCann (2011) objects that Downing\u2019s account accords undue\nepistemic weight to the natural line of thought in Essay 2.8.\nHe maintains Locke\u2019s reasoning is non-theoretical and unable to\njustify assent. Its force is limited to showing how \u201cordinary\nfolks have to think\u201d about the qualities ordinarily ascribed to\nbodies (McCann 2011: 184\u20136). The discussion has weight enough to\novertop the common views about the resemblance of ideas of SQs to\ntheir causes, which is all Locke intends it to do (McCann 2011: 175,\n171\u20132).\n5.2.3 Metaphysical status of SQs and powers in general\n\nAccording to Curley (1972), Alexander (1974: 168\u2013171), and\nothers, SQs are textures. Alexander also maintains that colors, etc.\nare not SQs but ideas in minds. But the explicit account of SQs in\nEssay 2.8.10, repeated in E 2.8.23, 24; 2.21.73, stands\nagainst both of these interpretations. Passages that make an analogy\nbetween warmth, etc. and pain suggest secondary qualities are\nsubjective sensations (e.g., 2.8.17; also 2.8.21), but Robert Wilson\n(2015: 199) rightly objects that the sub-species, which includes the\nsun\u2019s power to melt wax and thereby give it the power to cause\nideas of liquidity, shows SQs to be powers to affect bodies as well as\nminds.\n\nGeorge Berkeley\u2019s Principles of Human Knowledge (1710)\n(hereafter \u201cPHK\u201d) and Three Dialogues between Hylas\nand Philonous (1713) (hereafter \u201cTD\u201d) have encouraged\nthis interpretation of Locke\u2019s doctrine of SQs. According to\nBerkeley, the philosophers\u2019 doctrine of P/SQs states that\nextension, size, motion, etc. inhere in mind-independent material\nsubstance and cause ideas that resemble them, whereas colors, tastes,\netc. are ideas that cannot resemble anything without a mind. In his\nview, philosophers are right about SQs and wrong about the status of\nPQs. He opposes the doctrine because it promotes a form of\nmaterialism. The distinction figures in his idealist, anti-materialist\nargumentation as a philosophically reputable means by which the\nadmitted mind dependence of SQs can be used to leverage that of PQs.\nOne tactic is to claim that arguments supposed to show that color,\netc. cannot exist without a mind can be used against PQs, too, where\nthe arguments in question are his own perceiver relativity\nconsiderations (TD [2008: 167\u201370]; PHK [2008: 88]). This is\npaired with the contention that we cannot abstract the idea of a PQ\nfrom all ideas of SQs, e.g., the sensory idea of a figure cannot be\nseparated from all other visual or tactual qualityies. Either both\nexist in the mind or neither does (PHK [2008: 70\u20131, 86]; TD\n[2008: 115\u20136]) Many subsequent philosophers wrongly assume that\nBerkeley\u2019s report of the philosophers\u2019 distinction applies\nto Locke\u2019s doctrine of qualities (see Stroud 1980; M. Wilson\n1982 [1999]])\n\nMost recent scholars hold that Essay 2.8.10 states what\ncolors. etc. are according to Locke: causal capacities with intrinsic\nor causal ground in the PQs of insensible particles. Mark Johnston\ndevelops this in terms of a sophisticated account of a dispositional\nproperty understood as a \u201cconstituted disposition\u201d:\n\u201ca higher order property of having the properties which,\noddities aside, would cause the manifestations of the disposition in\ncircumstances C.\u201d (Johnston 1992: 230\u201334) This comports\nwith the structure of a SQ according to Essay 2.9\u201310,\nbut the text says nothing about conditions or circumstances of\nmanifestation (see discussion of Essay 2.30.2 below in this\nsub-section).\n\nScholars also disagree about the metaphysical status of powers that\nderive from the micro-structures of observable bodies. Are they\nentities that exist in, say, an almond even though they depend on its\nbasic constituents and presuppose co-existence of a competent\nperceiver? Or is there nothing in the almond but the real qualities of\nit and its parts?\n\nJacovides (2007b) argues for the leaner alternative. He maintains that\nfor Locke, the explanatory entities are PQs, bodies, ideas, and minds.\nBecause they constitute the facts that determine the truth or falsity\nof our assertions about SQs, we have no need of ideas that track their\nderivatives (Jacovides 2007b: 630). As he sees it, the doctrine that\nSQs are powers is not about what is in the world but Locke\u2019s\nsolution to a semantic problem: a way we can speak that makes\nassertions about SQs true and certain and forestalls the mistaken\nsuggestions of the paronymous use of SQ terms (Jacovides 2007b:\n641).\n\nWithout objecting to this account of the semantics of names of SQs, we\ncan add that the doctrine of SQs solves an epistemic problem arising\nfrom Locke\u2019s thesis that the limited knowledge we have is\nsufficient for our needs (E 1.5). The solution to this problem is in\npart about the world. Jacovides overlooks Locke\u2019s semantic\ntheory of simple ideas of sensation in general and its function in his\nepistemology. The key texts are Essay 2.30.1\u20132,\n2.31.1\u20132. and 4.4.4. In outline, God sustains steady causal\nconnections among the different internal constitutions of bodies, the\nconstitutions of the bodies of perceivers, and all the simple ideas of\nsensation that enter their minds. With this foundation in place, the\nfact, as Locke has it, that we are aware that simple ideas of\nsensation come from without us enables these ideas to be, and be taken\nto be, reliable signs of things that are founded in reality (E 2.30.2,\n31.2; 4.4.4); for a defense of the natural sign interpretation of\nsimple ideas of sensation, see Ayers 1991: 60\u201364. Ideas of SQs,\nin particular, are not ideas of micro-constitutions; they do not\ninform us of the nature of what they represent. They are ideas of\npowers that stand in for the causal foundations that underwrite sense\nperception; see Ayers 1997 on the place-holder function of this idea\nof power. We cannot have perceptual knowledge of the nature of the\nfoundations. But because ideas of SQs track collections of PQ of\ninsensible particles on which the ideas depend, we have the cogntiive\nability to distinguish different objects we have to do with, discern\ntheir qualities, and take them for our needs (E 2.30.3; 4.4.4).\n5.2.4 Resemblance of ideas of PQs and qualities of bodies\n\nLocke\u2019s RT has spawned confusion on at least two points of\ndoctrine:\n\nHow resemblance between an idea of sensation and a quality\nexisting in actual things is to be understood;\nWhy RT is important, or what Locke intends to convey by asserting\nit.\n\nHow is \u201cresemblance\u201d to be understood?\n\nAyers (2011: 151\u201357) observes that Locke has more than one\naccount of what ideas are. According to a Cartesian view, ideas are\nintentional mental acts by which their objects are presented and\nrepresented to the mind (e.g., Essay 1.1.8; 4.1.2)). On this\nview, it is not difficult to understand what it is for an idea to\nresemble, or not to resemble, its object: it presents the object as\nhaving a feature that resembles (does not resemble) a feature the\nobject has. But Essay 2.8 introduces a different notion of\nideas: simple ideas of sensation are effects of the operations of\nbodies on our sensory organs. They are non-intentional sensations akin\nto raw pains. They acquire a representative function in virtue of\ntheir contingent causal connections to the constitutions of bodies\naround us. In Ayer\u2019s view, this makes the claim that ideas of\nPQs resemble qualities existing in bodies \u201cproblematic, if not\nabsurd\u201d (Ayers 2011: 154). Here it seems \u201cresembles\u201d\nmust mean \u201cshares a property with\u201d, not \u201cdepicts a\nthing as having a property it has\u201d. Problems with the former\ninclude that essentially mind-dependent ideas cannot be like anything\nthat can exist without a mind, as Berkeley says. Also, how can we know\nwhat the qualities of bodies are like in themselves given that we know\nthe qualities only by means of the ideas they cause in us? Also, it is\ndifficult to understand how an idea can share with a body the quality\nbeing 10 feet long, or moving away from the perceiver at 20 miles per\nhour, or being solid, and so on. Most scholars are resigned to saying\nor tacitly allowing that if simple ideas are taken to be\nnon-intentional qualia, the positive resemblance thesis is deeply\nproblematic.\n\nBut Jacovides (1999), undertakes to defend the literal interpretation\nof the positive RT. His defense is limited in two ways: it applies\nonly to visual ideas that are products of experience and metnions only\nrespects of resemblance that Locke and his contemporaries would have\nfound acceptable, such as the image of a tri image of a square and a\nsquare. Two broad problems can be mentioned:\n\nLocke appears to assert that all ideas of PQs\u2014tactual as\nwell as visual\u2014resemble qualities of their causes and\non this interpretation, the resemblance might be far from exact;\nbut the texts speak of \u201cperfect resemblances\u201d and mirror\nimages (E 2.8.16).\n\nWhy does Locke want to establish RT?\n\nMore central to Locke\u2019s distinction of P/SQs is the question why\nidea-quality resemblance and non-resemblance are important in\nLocke\u2019s view. RT is said to be a consequence of the argument\nthat establishes the P/SQ distinction in Essay\n2.8\u201314\u2014what does the further thesis do for Locke? In\nsections 16\u201319, the resemblance/non resemblance dichotomy and\nthe real/imputed quality dichotomies coincide (Rickless 2014:\n88\u201390). E. J. Lowe (2005: 51\u20132) suggests that in denying\nresemblance in the case of ideas of SQs, Locke \u201cexpresses the\nview that the ideas mislead us into taking a dispositional property to\nbe a real non-dispositional quality\u201d. But although we do\ncommonly make this mistake according to Locke, the fault is not with\nwhat ideas represent but our tendency to conflate ideas and\nqualities.\n\nMcCann (1994: 64), among others, suggests that Locke\u2019s purpose\nin denying that ideas of SQs resemble bodies is to discredit the\nscholastic theory that we perceive qualities of objects by receiving\nresemblances of them which are emitted by the objects. One objection\nis that Locke wholly repudiates this scholastic theory, so this fails\nto account for the positive part of RT.\n\nJacovides (2007a: 108\u2013110) suggests that epistemic concerns\nmotivate Locke\u2019s adherence to both parts of RT. As he sees it,\nLocke is worried that because ideas are the immediate objects of our\nknowledge, they may not represent external objects. So he thinks we\nshould have a presumption against assuming that ideas of sensation\nresemble things without us. The pain analogy provides a reason in\nsupport of this presumption. However, Jacovides maintains, Locke\nthinks it is overcome in the case of PQs because they play a part in\nCT which is our most intelligible account of how things happen in the\nworld. There is some truth to this general description, but it has no\nclear connection with Locke\u2019s interest in RT. The presumption is\nnot explicitly stated, as far as I know, and the epistemic worry about\nideas is stated only in Essay 4.4 where RT is not\nmentioned.\n\nThe arguments addressed to RT turn out to show that a quality is real\njust in case it resembles the idea of it. Essay 2.8, sections\n17 and 18 explicitly state that PQs are real qualities, i.e. qualities\nthat are in a body whether it is perceived or not, and SQs are not\nreal qualities; the point is reiterated in sections 22 and 23.\nRickless takes the emphasis on reality and non-reality to show that\nfor Locke, the most fundamental difference between PQs and SQs is that\nthe former are real qualities of bodies and the latter are not in the\nstrictest sense. We can suggest that although this may be the basic\ndifference from the perpective of natural philosophy, Locke\u2019s\ninterest in the P/SQ distinction derives from his more fundamentl\ninterest in the relation between perception and reality (see E 2.8.7,\n.22), From Locke\u2019s perpective, the basic difference is at the\nlevel of sorts of ideas of sensation and the difference has to do with\nhow they represent the real qualities present in bodies perceived by\nthe senses.\n6. Thomas Reid\n\nThomas Reid, known for his theory of perception and an epistemic\ntheory he calls \u201ccommon sense\u201d, urges a version of the\ndistinction of qualities in two of his main philosophical works:\nAn Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common\nSense (1764) and Essays on the Intellectual Powers of\nMan (1785). Both use an empirical method to investigate basic\nfaculties of the human mind such as perception, conception, and\njudgment. Qualities of bodies are identified as the objects of\nperception. Among them, Reid finds the foundation of a division\naligned with the standard lists of PQs and SQs presented as a\ndifference in how we know them. Some scholars maintain his doctrine of\nP/SQs is entirely epistemic (Lehrer 1978; McKitrick 2002), but others\ncontend it depends on a metaphysical distinction (Van Cleve 2015:\n110\u201312).\n\nReid is also known for his extended critique and unrelenting\nrepudiation of the way of ideas. He finds it in the whole of\nphilosophy from Democritus to Berkeley and Hume. Characterizing it as\nthe view that there is a single sort of mind-dependent entity that we\nmust immediately apprehend in order to apprehend anything else, he\ncontends it precludes all cognition of things outside the mind (Reid\n1785 [2002: 27\u201332, 199\u2013200]; Nichols 2003; Van Cleve 2015:\n57\u201398). In his view, it is the source of most false and mistaken\nphilosophical accounts of perception (Reid 1785 [2002: 249,\n261\u20135]).\n\nReid\u2019s concept of sensation is a main instrument of his\nopposition to the theory of ideas. He holds sensations to be\nnon-intentional objects of consciousness which have potential to be\nconceived; they are what they are felt to be and felt to be what they\nare (Reid 1785 [2002: 36\u20138, 193\u20134]). Perceptions, by\ncontrast, are cognitive. An episode of perception breaks down to an\nact of conceiving an external object and an act of believing in its\npresent existence. Sensations are, then, wholly extrinsic to\nperceptions. But with one exception, perception of all sorts of\nobjects is attended by a simultaneous sensation which is the effect of\nthe object operating on sensory organs of the perceiver (Reid 1785\n[2002:\n 193\u20134])[5]\n\nTwo terms are used for the mind\u2019s shift from a non-intentional\nsensation to a perception. The sensation is a \u201csign\u201d to\nthe mind of the presence of the quality that causes it, in particular,\na natural sign grounded in the constitution of our nature (Reid 1785\n[2002: 119]). The sensation \u201csuggests\u201d a certain\nconception and firm belief; the one is \u201cnaturally and\nnecessarily annexed\u201d to the others. The transition is\nnon-inferential, not due to habit, experience, or education. It\nfollows, according to Reid, that the conjunction of acts is a\nconsequence of the naturally inexplicable constitution of human nature\n(Reid 1764 [1997: 7\u20138, 40\u201344]; 1785 [2002:\n96\u2013101]).\n\nThat sensations and perceptions of the qualities that cause them are\ndistinct mental acts is, like the theory of ideas, a point on which\nphilosophical theories of perception founder as Reid sees it (e.g.,\nReid 1785 [2002:199\u2013200]). His empirical evidence shows that\nsensations and the corresponding qualities have the same names in\nvirtually all human languages: \u201csmell of a rose\u201d is\nambiguous as between an aromatic feeling and a quality possessed by a\nkind of flower. The quality and the sensation are generally confounded\nby imagination as if they were the same operation (Reid 1764 [1997:\n43]; 1785 [2002: 193\u201399]). This is benign for ordinary purposes,\naccording to Reid, but a thorn in the side of philosophers. It\nobscures a difference among the various qualities perceived by sense\nthat Reid\u2019s decisive division of sensation and perception brings\nto light.\n\nAccording to Reid, when experiencing the smell of a rose, you have a\npleasing sensation and directly perceive the quality of a body that\ncauses it. The sensation is felt; the external cause is conceived and\nfirmly believed to exist. By contrast, an experience of hardness or\nsoftness involves faint and uninteresting sensations that serve just\nas signs to which the mind immediately responds by conceiving and\nbelieving in the bodily qualities they stand for. Pressing a hand on\nthe top of a table, you have a sensation which is typically unnoticed\nand you notice a property of the table, a cohesion of its parts\nsufficiently firm to resist any change of its shape. Tactual\nperception of figure is similar: when you press your hand around the\nsurface of a ball, you feel the figure; although the feeling can be\nnoticed with attention and practice, it is usually disregarded (Reid\n1785 [2002: 193\u20137]; 1764 [1997: 55\u20137]).\n\nThe contrast provides the foundation of Reid\u2019s distinction\nbetween qualities listed as primary and secondary. The senses give us\n\u201ca direct and a distinct\u201d notion of the primary qualities\nand inform us \u201cwhat they are in themselves\u201d, but\n\u201conly a relative and obscure\u201d notion of the SQs, one that\ntells us \u201conly that they \u2026 produce in us a certain\nsensation\u201d and \u201cleave us in the dark\u201d about\n\u201cwhat they are in themselves\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002:\n200\u2013203]; 1764 [1997: 61\u20132]). By a \u201cdistinct\nnotion\u201d, Reid means one that provides clear and distinct\nunderstanding of its object. Our notion of hardness is said to inform\nus perfectly of what that quality is; \u201cit is manifest to\nsense\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002: 203]). By a \u201cdirect\nnotion\u201d, he means one that is not relative. A relative notion of\na thing, \u201cis, strictly speaking, no notion of the thing at all,\nbut only of some relation which it bears to something else\u201d\n(Reid 1785 [2002: 200\u201303]). For instance,\n\n\nThat smell in the rose is an unknown quality \u2026 which is the\ncause \u2026 of a sensation which I know well\u2026The same\nreasoning will apply to every secondary quality. (Reid 1785 [2002:\n202])\n\n\nTwo of Reid\u2019s reflections on this contrast are especially\nimportant. First, there are no disputes about the natures of the\nprimary qualities because the are exhibited to sense. Primary\nqualities are investigated by the a priori methods of the\nmathematical sciences. Reid attributes this to the distinctness of our\nconcepts of them and the knowledge of their natures the concepts\nprovide. They are subjects of conceptual necessary truths. But because\nsecondary qualities are obscure to sense, they are an appropriate\nsubject of the sort of formal inquiry conducted in natural philosophy.\nTheir natures are not known directly by the senses but may be\ndiscovered by observation, reasoning, and deft use of hypotheses;\ne.g., we know vibrations cause sounds and reflected light causes\nsensations of colors (on the proper method of natural philosophical\ninquiry (see Reid 1785 [2002: 267\u201375]).\n\nThe second reflection concerns the \u201ccapitol part\u201d\nsensations bear in the \u201cnotion we form of the [object\nperceived]\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002: 204]). Unlike the easily forgotten\nsensations that accompany perception of PQs, many sensations caused by\nSQs have a salience that makes us attend to them and form concepts of\nthem. They are not just signs of the qualities when we perceive them:\n\u201cthe thought of a secondary quality always carries us back to\nthe sensation it produces\u201d, This is because although each\nperception is conjoined with a sensation proper to it (Reid 1785\n[2002: 199]), relative notions specify every object as an unknown\ncause. We have only their known effects by which to reflect on them\nand mark them as different from each other. This has been called the\n\u201ccapitol part\u201d thesis. In effect, post-perceptual\napprehension of SQs is mediated by conception of the sensation that is\nits sign\u2014apparently, a mediation Reid considers innocuous (see\nReid 1785 [2002: 134]; for different views about what that might be,\nsee Nichols 2007: ch. 10; Copenhaver 2004; Buras 2011; Van Cleve 2015:\n297\u2013300). The implications of this for the meanings of SQ terms\nis disputed by scholars.\n\nTwo main issues are debated in the literature on Reid\u2019s P/SQ\ndistinction:\n\nWhether SQs as known by our senses are dispositions or causal\nbases of them;\nWhether or not the capitol part thesis commits Reid to the view\nthat sensations are semantic constituents of the meanings of SQ terms\n(Lehrer 1989: 27).\n\n6.1 Are SQs dispositions or causal bases?\n\nSome texts suggest that secondary qualities as known by the senses are\ndispositions, notably:\n\n\n[color] is a certain power \u2026 in bodies that in fair daylight\nexhibits to the eye an appearance which is very familiar to us\nalthough it hath no name. (Reid 1765 [1997: 87])\n\n\nBut there are more texts that identify SQs with the unknown causes of\nfamiliar sensations, such as:\n\n\nThe qualities in bodies we call heat and cold are\nunknown. They are only conceived by us, as unknown causes or occasions\nof the sensations which we give the same names. (Reid 1765 [1997: 54;\nespecially 86]; 1785 [2002: 202\u201304], among others)\n\n\nNowadays it is generally accepted that a disposition and the cause of\nits manifestations are distinct; it is not possible that they be the\nsame thing.\n\nWolterstorff offers this argument:\n\n\nif green were a disposition in things to cause certain sensations\nunder certain conditions and not the physical basis of that\ndisposition, we would know what it was. (Wolterstorff 2000: 112)\n\n\nThis might well be based on a paragraph in Essays on the\nIntellectuaI Powers of Man (Reid 1785 [2002: 203\u201304]). It\nstates that feeling informs us that the fire is hot but not what heat\nis in the fire; it notes that this may seem to be a contradiction but\nsays it ought to be accepted. It allows that if we had no notion of\nheat we could not understand the assertion that fire is hot, and\nconcludes \u201cwe have a notion, but it is a relative notion. We\nknow they are the causes of certain known effects\u201d (Reid 1785\n[2002: 203\u201304]). This might naturally be understood to invoke\nthe obscurity of relational specifications of qualities to dispel the\nseeming contradiction.\n\nVan Cleve (2015: 105\u2013110) dismisses Wolterstorff\u2019s\nargument on the ground that there is an equally good counter argument\nas follows. It is an epistemic principle that you know X is\nF only if you know what it is to be F; Reid thinks we know of\nmany things that they are green; so, we must know what it is to be\ngreen. Someone might object that Reid adheres to a different epistemic\nprinciple in the passage we just discussed. In a note citing this\ntext, Van Cleve admits Reid\u2019s position is unclear but takes the\nlast part of the passage to say the relative notion enables us to know\nwhat it is to be green, namely, to manifest certain sensations. In his\nopinion, Reid favors this view of SQs. Reading the passage this way\nrenders the contradiction irrelevant but leaves the many texts that\nwould seem to identify SQs with the unknown causes of known effects\nout of account. As Nichols (2007: 6.4) puts it, the dispositional\ninterpretation makes nonsense of Reid\u2019s frequent claims that he\ndoes not know what SQs are. Nichols finds evidence of the causal basis\ntheory in Reid\u2019s use of SQ terms in talking about the causes of\nSQ sensations and concludes that all relevant texts considered, we\nshould take him to accept a physical microstructural account of SQs\n(Nichols 2006: 6.6).\n\nVan Cleve elaborates on the dispositional interpretation in two ways.\nFirst, noting that Reid is drawn to the view that SQs are unknown\ncauses, he suggests that although it was not available to Reid, a\nsecond order dispositional account might accommodate the conflicting\ntexts: to have a SQ is to have a property P such that\nP would cause certain sensations in circumstances C\n(Van Cleve 2016: 109). Second, he notes that if SQs are dispositions\nmanifested by human responses, they are relational properties, whereas\nPQs seem to be intrinsic. He argues that the latter is borne out under\na test of intrinsicality along lines proposed by G.E. Moore (Winkler\n2016: 225\u201331 challenges this; Van Cleve 2016: 240\u201344 is\nhis response). From this, Van Cleve concludes that Reid\u2019s P/SQ\ndistinction rests on a metaphysical foundation (Van Cleve 2016:\n110\u201312).\n6.2 The capitol parts thesis and the semantics of SQ terms\n\nThis is an issue on which more recent scholars tend to disagree with\nsome earlier ones. The capitol part thesis states that we cannot\nreflect on or distinguish among SQs without conceiving the sensations\nthat signify them. This suggests a close conceptual connection between\nqualities and their proper sensations. Lehrer (1989: 27) maintains it\ncommits Reid to a view on which the meaning of, say, \u201cX\nis red\u201d essentially contains concepts of sensations of red. If\nReid holds that SQs are dispositions manifested by sensations. he is\ncommitted to this semantic claim. But the present question is whether\nor not the capitol part thesis commits him to the semantic claim.\n\nThe thesis about post-perceptual conception of a SQ entails two claims\nthat are directly relevant: that we cannot form the concept of a SQ\nwithout at the same time forming the concept of the sensation it\ncauses and that we cannot have the concept of a SQ unless we have\nexperienced the quality. The need for experience is often taken to\nsupport the view that PQs and SQs differ in respect of how their\nmeanings are specified: in particular, it is said that\n\u201cX is red\u201d means that X manifests\nsensations of red under certain circumstances, whereas the meaning of\n\u201cX is solid\u201d can be specified without reference to\nsensations of solidity. But recent scholars argue that the semantic\nclaim about SQ terms is not entailed by the capitol part remark. They\npoint to reasons for a person\u2019s needing to have the concept of\nthe sensation caused by a quality in order to have the concept of that\nquality\u2014the capitol part thesis\u2014that are independent of\nthe truth or falsity of the semantic claim. Van Cleve points to the\nuse Kripke might make of the perception of SQs to fix the reference of\n\u201cred\u201d in its rigid use, i.e., use as a name for just those\nqualities that cause a certain sort of sensation in the actual world.\nNichols (2006: 6.4) offers a different reason for a similar\nconclusion. But although recent scholars agree about this, they\ndisagree over how Reid intended the capitol part thesis to be\nunderstood.\n\nVan Cleve reports his belief that Reid meant it to entail that SQs are\ndispositions which cannot be conceived unless conceived as manifesting\ncertain sensations. SQs are, then, essentially phenomenal or human\nresponse dependent (Van Cleve 2016: 107\u20139). No argument is\noffered other than the one purporting to show that Reid can be read as\nurging a dispositional theory of SQs (see above). There seems to be no\nconsensus on the interpretative issue.\n",
