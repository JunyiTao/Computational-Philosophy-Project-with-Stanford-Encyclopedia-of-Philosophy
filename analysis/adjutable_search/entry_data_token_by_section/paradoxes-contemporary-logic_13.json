Paradoxes: between metamathematics and type-free foundations (1930\u20131945)\n\nWith the work of G\u00f6del and Tarski, paradoxical arguments were\nreshaped into fixed point results, while the semantic conception of\ntruth, the formalization of semantics and the arithmetization of\nsyntax yielded firm grounds for systematic metamathematical\ninvestigations. In addition, an effort was made to elaborate new grand\nlogics as a reaction to the logic of Principia Mathematica.\nConceptually, the notions of (self-applicable)\nfunction-in-intension/operation and property/ predicate were accepted\nas primitive, and the very mechanism of definition/combination of\nconcepts was studied. This line of thought gave impulse to the\nelaboration of syntactical methods within combinatory logic and to the\nrise of recursion theory. The diagnosis of the paradoxes was further\nenriched by a subtler analysis of purely logical features of\nparadoxical reasoning: this is especially true for negation and the\ncrucial role of contraction and duplication properties built into the\nlaws of standard implication. Three valued logic was applied to\nna\u00efve comprehension.\n",
