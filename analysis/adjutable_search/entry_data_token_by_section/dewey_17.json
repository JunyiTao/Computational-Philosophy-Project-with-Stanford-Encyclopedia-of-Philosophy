    "main_text": "Inquiry and Knowledge || The Organic Roots of Instrumentalism\n4.1 The Organic Roots of Instrumentalism\n\nThe interactional, organic model Dewey developed in his psychology\ninformed his theories of learning and knowledge. Given this new\necological framework, a range of traditional epistemological proposals\nand puzzles (premised on metaphysical divisions such as\nappearance/reality, mind/world) lost credibility. \u201cSo far as the\nquestion of the relation of the self to known objects is\nconcerned\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cknowing is but one special case\nof the agent-patient, of the behaver-enjoyer-sufferer situation\u201d\n(\u201cBrief Studies in Realism\u201d, MW6: 120). As we have already\nseen in psychology, Dewey\u2019s wholesale repudiation of the\ntradition\u2019s basic metaphysical framework required extensive\nreconstructions in every other area; one popular name for\nDewey\u2019s reconstruction of epistemology (or \u201ctheory of\ninquiry\u201d, as Dewey preferred to call it) was\n \u201cinstrumentalism\u201d.[22]\n\nAs did his earlier psychological functionalism, instrumentalism\nutilized a Darwinian starting point to criticize and dissolve\nentrenched divisions between, for example, realism/idealism,\nscience/religion, and empiricism/rationalism. Seen from this\nstandpoint, change and transformation are natural features of the\nactual world, and knowledge and logic are ways to adapt, survive, and\nthrive. The vitality of the world in which we reason, its dynamic and\nbiological basis, is more informative about knowledge and truth than\nthe paradigms of physics or mathematics, historically celebrated by\nphilosophy. While instrumentalism acknowledges sensation\u2019s\ncontributions, it also insists upon the constructive power of\n reasoning.[23]\n\nEarly statements of instrumentalism (and definitive breaks by Dewey\nwith Hegelian logic) may be seen in \u201cSome Stages of Logical\nThought\u201d (Dewey 1900 [1916], MW1); that essay follows Peirce\n (entry on Peirce section on pragmatism, pragmaticism, and the scientific method],[24]\n especially the well known 1877\u201378 articles championing the\nlarger framework of scientific thinking, namely the\n\u201cdoubt-inquiry process\u201d (MW1: 173; see also Peirce 1877,\n1878). This account is developed in Studies in Logical Theory\n(Dewey 1903b, MW2), by Dewey and his collaborators at Chicago. In the\nwork, Dewey acknowledges a \u201cpreeminent obligation\u201d to\n James (Perry 1935: 308\u2013309).[25]\n\nStudies criticizes transcendentalist logic extensively,\nconcluding that logic should not assume either thought or\nreality\u2019s existence in general but should rest content\nwith the function or use of ideas in experience: \n\n\nThe test of validity of [an] idea is its functional or instrumental\nuse in effecting the transition from a relatively conflicting\nexperience to a relatively integrated one. (Studies, MW2:\n359) \n\n\nThus, instrumentalism abandons all psycho-physical dualisms and all\ncorrespondentist theories of knowing. Dewey wrote, \n\n\nIn the logical process the datum is not just external existence, and\nthe idea mere psychical existence. Both are modes of\nexistence\u2014one of given existence, the other of\npossible, of inferred existence\u2026.In other words, datum\nand ideatum are divisions of labor, cooperative instrumentalities, for\neconomical dealing with the problem of the maintenance of the\nintegrity of experience. (Studies, MW2: 339\u2013340)\n\n",
