For example,\nan angel is indivisible, in some way analogous to a geometric point,\nbut we need to say angels move, and motion is continuous, like a\ngeometric line. Can a discrete point \u201cmove\u201d and by doing\nso trace out a continuous line? Aristotle argued strenuously that\nnothing indivisible can possibly move absolutely smoothly. But\ntheology requires us to assert that an angel exists in discrete place,\nthen subsequently and successively in another discrete place, even\nthough we cannot say that some of its \u201cparts\u201d were always\nheading to the new place because as an indivisible it has no parts.\nBut then any angelic motion we might be imagining is not absolutely\nsmooth, but rather jumpy. If angels are indivisible then angelic\nmotion must be \u201cgappy\u201d, and Aristotle teaches us that this\nis not motion at all.\n\nChatton wrote about indivisibles and continua chiefly in the context\nof angelic motion, although he sometimes touched on related issues of\nminima naturalia, condensation and rarefaction, and questions\nof whether a will can sin in an instant. Other indivisibilists in his\ntime used indivisibles to treat problems of celestial motion. All\nthese governing contexts are fundamentally physical. Chatton would\ndiscuss mathematical issues as required, especially in the face of\ncritique, but he advocated for belief in indivisibles in physical\ncontexts for theological reasons; since he thought that theology\nneeded recourse to real physics involving indivisibles, for him the\nconcept had to be defended and rehabilitated if possible. Opposing him\nin this were not only many of his contemporaries, but also the\nauthority of Aristotle.\n",
