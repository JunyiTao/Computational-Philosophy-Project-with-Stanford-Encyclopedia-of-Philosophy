Power as Resource: Liberal Feminist Approaches\n\nThose who conceptualize power as a resource understand it as a\npositive social good that is currently unequally distributed. For\nfeminists who understand power in this way, the goal is to\nredistribute this resource so that women will have power equal to men.\nImplicit in this view is the assumption that power is, as Iris Marion\nYoung puts it, \u201ca kind of stuff that can be possessed by\nindividuals in greater or lesser amounts\u201d (Young 1990, 31).\n\nThe conception of power as a resource is arguably implicit in the work\nof some liberal feminists (Mill 1970, Okin 1989). For example, in\nJustice, Gender, and the Family, Susan Moller Okin argues\nthat the modern gender-structured family unjustly distributes the\nbenefits and burdens of familial life amongst husbands and wives. Okin\nincludes power on her list of the benefits, which she calls\n\u201ccritical social goods.\u201d As she puts it, \u201cwhen we\nlook seriously at the distribution between husbands and wives of such\ncritical social goods as work (paid and unpaid), power, prestige,\nself-esteem, opportunities for self-development, and both physical and\neconomic security, we find socially constructed inequalities between\nthem, right down the list\u201d (Okin, 1989, 136). Here, Okin seems\nto presuppose that power is a resource that is unequally and unjustly\ndistributed between men and women; hence, one of the goals of feminism\nwould be to redistribute this resource in more equitable ways.\n\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t discuss Okin\u2019s work explicitly, Young\noffers a compelling critique of this view, which she calls the\ndistributive model of power. First, Young maintains that it is wrong\nto think of power as a kind of stuff that can be possessed; on her\nview, power is a relation, not a thing that can be distributed or\nredistributed. Second, she claims that the distributive model tends to\npresuppose a dyadic, atomistic understanding of power; as a result, it\nfails to illuminate the broader social, institutional and structural\ncontexts that shape individual relations of power. According to Young,\nthis makes the distributive model unhelpful for understanding the\nstructural features of domination. Third, the distributive model\nconceives of power statically, as a pattern of distribution, whereas\nYoung, following Foucault (1980), claims that power exists only in\naction, and thus must be understood dynamically, as existing in\nongoing processes or interactions. Finally, Young argues that the\ndistributive model of power tends to view domination as the\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few. According to Young,\nalthough this model might be appropriate for some forms of domination,\nit is not appropriate for the forms that domination takes in\ncontemporary industrial societies such as the United States (Young\n1990a, 31\u201333). On her view, in contemporary industrial\nsocieties, power is \u201cwidely dispersed and diffused\u201d and\nyet it is nonetheless true that \u201csocial relations are tightly\ndefined by domination and oppression\u201d (Young 1990a,\n32\u201333).\n",
