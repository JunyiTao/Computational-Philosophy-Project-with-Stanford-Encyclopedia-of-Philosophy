    "main_text": "Proof Theory: A New Subject || Hilbert\u2019s Ansatz and Results\n1.1 Hilbert\u2019s Ansatz and Results \n\nThe proof is given in section II of Ackermann\u2019s paper entitled,\ntellingly, The consistency proof before the addition of the\ntransfinite axioms. Ackermann uses a logical calculus in\naxiomatic form that is taken over from Hilbert\u2019s lectures and is\ndiscussed below in\n section 2.\n Here we just note that it involves two logical rules, namely, modus\nponens and substitution (for individual, function and statement\nvariables) in axioms. The non-logical axioms concern identity, zero\nand successor, and recursion equations that define primitive recursive\nfunctions. The first step in the argument turns the linear proof into\na tree, so that any formula occurrence is used at most once as a\npremise of an inference (Aufl\u00f6sung in Beweisf\u00e4den);\nthis is done in preparation for the second step, namely, the\nelimination of all necessarily free variables (Ausschaltung der\nVariablen); in the third step, the numerical value of the closed\nterms is computed (Reduktion der Funktionale). The resulting\nsyntactic configurations, a Beweisfigur, contains now only\nnumerical formulae that are built up from equations or\ninequations between numerals and Boolean connectives; these formulae\ncan be effectively determined to be true or false. By induction on the\n\u201cBeweisfigur\u201d one shows that all its component\nformulae are true; thus, a formula like \\(0\\ne 0\\) is not provable.\nThe induction principle can be directly incorporated into these\nconsiderations when it is formulated as a rule for quantifier-free\nstatements. That was not done in Ackermann\u2019s discussion of the\nproof, but had been achieved already by Hilbert and Bernays in their\n1922/23 lectures.\n\nThese proof theoretic considerations are striking and important as\nthey involve for the first time genuine transformations of formal\nderivations. Nevertheless, they are preliminary as they concern a\nquantifier-free theory that is a part of finitist mathematics\nand need not be secured by a consistency proof. What has to\nbe secured is \u201ctransfinite logic\u201d with its \u201cideal\nelements\u201d, as Hilbert put it later. The strategy was direct and\nstarted to emerge already in 1921. First, introduce functional terms\nby the transfinite\n axiom[5]\n \n\n\\[A(a) \\to A(\\varepsilon x\\ldot A(x))\\]\n\n\nand define quantifiers by  \n\n  \\[\n  \\exists x A(x) \\leftrightarrow A(\\varepsilon x\\ldot A(x))\n  \\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\n\\forall x A(x) \\leftrightarrow A(\\varepsilon x\\ldot \\neg A(x)).\n\\]\n\n\nUsing the epsilon terms, quantifiers can now be eliminated from proofs\nin quantificational logic, thus transforming them into quantifier-free\nones. Finally, the given derivation allows one, so it was conjectured,\nto determine numerical values for the epsilon terms. In his Leipzig\ntalk of September 1922, published in 1923, Hilbert discussed this\nAnsatz for eliminating quantifiers and reducing the\ntransfinite case to that of the quantifier-free theory. He presented\nthe actual execution of this strategic plan only \u201cfor the\nsimplest case\u201d (in Hilbert 1923: 1143\u20131144). However, the\ntalk was crucial in the development of proof theory and the finitist\nprogram: \u201cWith the structure of proof theory, presented to us in\nthe Leipzig talk, the principled form of its conception had been\nreached\u201d. That is how Bernays characterizes its achievement in\nhis essay on Hilbert\u2019s investigations of the foundations of\narithmetic (1935: 204)\n\nAckermann continued in section III of his 1925 at the very spot where\nHilbert and Bernays had left off. His paper, submitted to\nMathematische Annalen in March of 1924, and the corrective\nwork he did in 1925 led to the conviction that the consistency of\nelementary arithmetic had been established. The corrective work had\nbeen done to address difficulties von Neumann had pointed out, but was\nnot published by Ackermann; it was only presented in the second volume\nof Hilbert and Bernays 1939 (pp.\n 93\u2013130).[6]\n Von Neumann\u2019s own proof theoretic investigations, submitted to\nMathematische Zeitschrift in July 1925, were published under\nthe title Zur Hilbertschen Beweistheorie in 1927.\nHilbert\u2019s 1928 Bologna Lecture prominently took\nAckermann\u2019s and von Neumann\u2019s work as having established\nthe consistency of elementary arithmetic, the proof making use only of\nfinitist principles. Let F be a theory containing exclusively\nsuch principles, like primitive recursive arithmetic\nPRA; the principles of PRA consist\nof the Peano axioms for zero and successor, the defining equations for\nall primitive recursive functions (defined in\n note 3),\n and quantifier-free induction. Now the significance of a consistency\nproof in F can be articulated as follows:\n\n\nTheorem 1.1 Let T be a theory that\ncontains a modicum of arithmetic and let A be a\n\\(\\Pi^0_1\\)-statement, i.e., one of the form \\(\\forall\nx_1\\ldots\\forall x_n\\,P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) with quantifiers ranging\nover naturals and P a primitive recursive predicate, i.e., a\npredicate with a primitive recursive characteristic function. If\nF proves the consistency of T and T proves\nA, then F proves A.\n\n\nThis theorem can be expressed and proved in PRA and\nensures that a T-proof of a \u201creal\u201d, finitistically\nmeaningful statement A leads to a finitistically valid statement.\nThis point is made clear in Hilbert\u2019s 1927-Hamburg lecture\n(Hilbert 1927). There he takes A to be the Fermat proposition\nand argues that if we had a proof of A in a theory containing\n\u201cideal\u201d elements, a finistist consistency proof for that\ntheory would allow us to transform that proof into a finitist one.\n\nThe belief that Ackermann and von Neumann had established the\nconsistency of elementary arithmetic was expressed as late as December\n1930 by Hilbert in his third Hamburg talk (Hilbert 1931a) and by Bernays in April 1931\nin a letter to G\u00f6del (see G\u00f6del 2003: 98\u2013103). Bernays\nasserts there that he has \u201crepeatedly considered\n[Ackermann\u2019s modified proof] and viewed it as correct\u201d. He\ncontinues, referring to G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results,\n\n\nOn the basis of your results one must now conclude, however, that that\nproof cannot be formalized within the system Z [of elementary\nnumber theory]; this must in fact hold true even if the system is\nrestricted so that, of the recursive definitions, only those for\naddition and multiplication are retained. On the other hand, I\ndon\u2019t see at which place in Ackermann\u2019s proof the\nformalization within Z should become impossible, \u2026\n\n\nAt the end of his letter, Bernays mentions that Herbrand misunderstood\nhim in a recent conversation on which Herbrand had reported in a\nletter to G\u00f6del with a copy to Bernays. Not only had Herbrand\nmisunderstood Bernays, but Bernays had also misunderstood Herbrand as\nto the extent of the latter\u2019s consistency result that was to be\npublished a few months later as Herbrand 1931. Bernays understood\nHerbrand as having claimed that he had established the consistency of\nfull first-order arithmetic: Herbrand\u2019s system is indeed a\nfirst-order theory with a rich collection of finitist functions, but\nit uses the induction principle only for quantifier-free\n formulae.[7]\n G\u00f6del asserted in December 1933 that this theorem of\nHerbrand\u2019s was even then the strongest result that had been\nobtained in the pursuit of Hilbert\u2019s finitist program, and he\nformulated the result in a beautiful informal way as follows:\n\n\nIf we take a theory, which is constructive in the sense that each\nexistence assertion made in the axioms is covered by a construction,\nand if we add to this theory the non-constructive notion of existence\nand all the logical rules concerning it, e.g., the law of the excluded\nmiddle, we shall never get into any contradiction. (G\u00f6del 1933:\n52)\n\n\nG\u00f6del himself had been much more ambitious in early 1930; his\ngoal was then to prove the consistency of analysis! According to Wang\n(1981: 654), his idea was \u201cto prove the consistency of analysis\nby number theory, where one can assume the truth of number theory, not\nonly the consistency\u201d. The plan for establishing the consistency\nof analysis relative to number theory did not work out, instead\nG\u00f6del found that sufficiently strong formal theories like\nPrincipia Mathematica and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory are\n(syntactically) incomplete.\n",
