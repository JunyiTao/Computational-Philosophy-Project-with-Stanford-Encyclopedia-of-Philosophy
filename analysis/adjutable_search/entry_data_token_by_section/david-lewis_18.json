    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience || Paradox in Paradise?\n6.2 Paradox in Paradise?\n\nChapter 2 deals with several objections to modal realism. Some of\nthese objections claim that modal realism leads to paradox. Other\nobjections claim that it undermines our ordinary practice. We will\nlook at two examples of each.\n\nPeter Forrest and D. M. Armstrong (1984) argue that modal realism\nleads to problems given the principle of recombination. An\nunrestricted principle of recombination says that for any things that\ncould exist, there is a world in which there is a duplicate of all of\nthem. Forrest and Armstrong apply the principle by taking the things\nto be the different possible worlds. A world containing a duplicate of\nall the worlds would, they show, be bigger than any world. But by the\nprinciple it would also be a world. Contradiction. Lewis\u2019 reply\nis to deny the unrestricted version of the principle. He insists that\nthere is independent reason to qualify the principle to those things\nwhose size and shape permits them to be fit into a single world.\nWithout an unrestricted principle of recombination, there is no way to\ncreate the large world that\u2019s at the heart of Forrest and\nArmstrong\u2019s paradox.\n\nDavid Kaplan argued that there could be no cardinality of the worlds.\nKaplan did not publish this argument, so Lewis replies to the version\npresented by Martin Davies (1981: 262). On Lewis\u2019s theory, every\nset of worlds is a proposition. For any proposition, says Kaplan, that\nproposition might be the only proposition being thought by a person at\nlocation l at time t. So for each proposition, there\nis a world where it (alone) is thought by a person at location\nl at time t. That means there is a one-one\ncorrespondence between the sets of worlds and a subset of the worlds.\nContradiction. Lewis\u2019s reply is to deny that every proposition\ncan be thought. He claims that functionalism about belief, plus the\nrequirement that beliefs latch onto relatively natural properties,\nmean that most propositions cannot be thought, and this blocks the\nparadox.\n\nPeter Forrest (1982) argues that modal realism leads to inductive\nscepticism. According to modal realism, there are other thinkers very\nmuch like us who are deceived by their surroundings. Given this, we\nshould doubt our inductive inferences. Lewis\u2019s reply is that\nmodal realism does not make inductive challenges any worse than they\nwere before. It is common ground that inductive inference is fallible.\nThat is, it is common ground that these inferences could fail.\nThinking of the possibilities of failure as concrete individuals might\nfocus the mind on them, and hence make us less confident, but does not\nseem to change the inference\u2019s justificatory status.\nLewis\u2019s argument seems hard to dispute here. Given the mutually\nagreed upon fact that the inference could fail, it\u2019s hard to see\nwhat epistemological cost is incurred by agreeing that it does fail\nfor someone kind of like the inferrer in a distant possible world.\n\nRobert Adams (1974) argues that modal realism leads to surprising\nresults in moral philosophy. The modal realist says that the way\nthings are, in the broadest possible sense, is not a contingent\nmatter, since we can\u2019t change the nature of the pluriverse.\nHence we cannot do anything about it. So if moral requirements flow\nfrom a requirement to improve the way things are, in this broadest\npossible sense, then there are no moral requirements. Lewis rejects\nthe antecedent of this conditional as something that only an extreme\nutilitarian could accept. What is crucial about morality is that\nwe not do evil. Even if their actions won\u2019t make a\ndifference to the nature of the pluriverse, a virtuous agent will not\nwant to, for instance, cause suffering. By rejecting the view that in\nour moral deliberations we should care about everyone, possible and\nactual, equally, Lewis avoids the problem.\n",
