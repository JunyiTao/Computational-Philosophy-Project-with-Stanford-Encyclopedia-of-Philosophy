The Study of Scientific Change\n\nThe idea that science is a collective enterprise of researchers in\nsuccessive generations is characteristic of the Modern Age (Nisbet\n1980). Classical empiricists (Francis Bacon) and rationalists\n(Ren\u00e9 Descartes) of the seventeenth century urged that the use\nof proper methods of inquiry guarantees the discovery and\njustification of new truths. This cumulative view of scientific\nprogress was an important ingredient in the optimism of the eighteenth\ncentury Enlightenment, and it was incorporated in the 1830s in Auguste\nComte\u2019s program of positivism: by accumulating empirically\ncertified truths science also promotes progress in society. Other\ninfluential trends in the nineteenth century were the Romantic vision\nof organic growth in culture, Hegel\u2019s dynamic account of\nhistorical change, and the theory of evolution. They all inspired\nepistemological views (e.g., among Marxists and pragmatists) which\nregarded human knowledge as a process. Philosopher-scientists with an\ninterest in the history of science (William Whewell, Charles Peirce,\nErnst Mach, Pierre Duhem) gave interesting analyses of some aspects of\nscientific change.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, analytic philosophers of science\nstarted to apply modern logic to the study of science. Their main\nfocus was the structure of scientific theories and patterns of\ninference (Suppe 1977). This \u201csynchronic\u201d investigation of\nthe \u201cfinished products\u201d of scientific activities was\nquestioned by philosophers who wished to pay serious attention to the\n\u201cdiachronic\u201d study of scientific change. Among these\ncontributions one can mention N.R. Hanson\u2019s Patterns of\nDiscovery (1958), Karl Popper\u2019s The Logic of Scientific\nDiscovery (1959) and Conjectures and Refutations (1963),\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962), Paul Feyerabend\u2019s incommensurability thesis (Feyerabend\n1962), Imre Lakatos\u2019 methodology of scientific research\nprogrammes (Lakatos and Musgrave 1970), and Larry Laudan\u2019s\nProgress and Its Problems (1977). Darwinist models of\nevolutionary epistemology were advocated by Popper\u2019s\nObjective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach (1972) and\nStephen Toulmin\u2019s Human Understanding (1972). These\nworks challenged the received view about the development of scientific\nknowledge and rationality. Popper\u2019s falsificationism,\nKuhn\u2019s account of scientific revolutions, and Feyerabend\u2019s\nthesis of meaning variance shared the view that science does not grow\nsimply by accumulating new established truths upon old ones. Except\nperhaps during periods of Kuhnian normal science, theory change is not\ncumulative or continuous: the earlier results of science will be\nrejected, replaced, and reinterpreted by new theories and conceptual\nframeworks. Popper and Kuhn differed, however, in their definitions of\nprogress: the former appealed to the idea that successive theories may\napproach towards the truth, while the latter characterized progress in\nterms of the problem-solving capacity of theories. \n\nSince the mid-1970s, a great number of philosophical works have been\npublished on the topics of change, development, and progress in\nscience (Harr\u00e9 1975; Stegm\u00fcller 1976; Howson 1976; Rescher\n1978; Radnitzky and Andersson 1978, 1979; Niiniluoto and Tuomela 1979;\nDilworth 1981; Smith 1981; Hacking 1981; Sch\u00e4fer 1983; Niiniluoto\n1984; Laudan 1984a; Rescher 1984; Pitt 1985; Radnitzky and Bartley\n1987; Callebaut and Pinxten 1987; Balzer et al. 1987; Hull 1988;\nGavroglu et al. 1989; Kitcher 1993; Pera 1994; Chang 2004; Maxwell\n2017). These studies have also led to many important novelties being\nadded to the toolbox of philosophers of science. One of them is the\nsystematic study of inter-theory relations, such as reduction (Balzer\net al. 1984; Pearce 1987; Balzer 2000; Jonkisz 2000; Hoyningen-Huene\nand Sankey 2001), correspondence (Krajewski 1977; Nowak 1980; Pearce\nand Rantala 1984; Nowakowa and Nowak 2000; Rantala 2002), and belief\nrevision (G\u00e4rdenfors, 1988; Aliseda, 2006). Another was the\nrecognition that, besides individual statements and theories, there is\nalso a need to consider temporally developing units of scientific\nactivity and achievement: Kuhn\u2019s paradigm-directed normal\nscience, Lakatos\u2019 research programme, Laudan\u2019s research\ntradition, Wolfgang Stegm\u00fcller\u2019s (1976) dynamic theory\nevolution, Philip Kitcher\u2019s (1993) consensus practice. A new\ntool that is employed in many defenses of realist views of scientific\nprogress (Niiniluoto 1980, 2014; Aronson, Harr\u00e9, and Way 1994;\nKuipers 2000, 2019) is the notion of truthlikeness or verisimilitude\n(Popper 1963, 1970).\n\nLively interest about the development of science promoted close\nco-operation between historians and philosophers of science. For\nexample, case studies of historical examples (e.g., the replacement of\nNewton\u2019s classical mechanics by quantum theory and theory of\nrelativity) have inspired many philosophical treatments of scientific\nrevolutions. Historical case studies were important for philosophers\nwho started to study scientific discovery (Hanson 1958; Nickles 1980).\nHistorically oriented philosophers have shown how instruments and\nmeasurements have promoted the progress of physics and chemistry\n(Chang 2004). Experimental psychologists have argued that the strive\nfor broad and simple explanations shapes learning and inference\n(Lombrozo 2016). Further interesting material for philosophical\ndiscussions about scientific progress is provided by quantitative\napproaches in the study of the growth of scientific publications (de\nSolla Price 1963; Rescher 1978) and science indicators (Elkana et\nal. 1978). Sociologists of science have studied the dynamic\ninteraction between the scientific community and other social\ninstitutions. With their influence, philosophers have analyzed the\nrole social and cultural values in the development of science (Longino\n2002). One of the favorite topics of sociologists has been the\nemergence of new scientific specialties (Mulkay 1975; Niiniluoto\n1995b). Sociologists are also concerned with the pragmatic problem of\nprogress: what is the best way of organizing research activities in\norder to promote scientific advance. In this way, models of scientific\nchange turn out to be relevant to issues of science policy (B\u00f6hme\n1977; Sch\u00e4fer 1983).\n",
