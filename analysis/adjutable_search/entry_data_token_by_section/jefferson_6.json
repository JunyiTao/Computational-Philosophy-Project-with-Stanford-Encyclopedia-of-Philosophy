    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The \u201cNatural Aristoi\u201d\n4.2 The \u201cNatural Aristoi\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s republicanism was both democratic and meritocratic.\nIt was democratic in that it aimed roughly to have no person\ndisadvantaged at the start of life. That would be the same for Blacks,\nwho were the equals of all others in moral sensibility\u2014hence,\ntheir desert of equal rights and equal opportunities. Democratic\nrepublicanism demanded recognition of moral equality and equality of\nopportunity. Yet Jefferson realized that each person\u2019s dreams,\nintelligence, and talents varied greatly. Thus, Jeffersonian\nrepublicanism was also meritocratic in that all persons were allowed\nto do with their life what they saw fit to do with it, so long as in\ndoing so they did not disallow others the opportunity of doing what\nthey saw fit to do. The most talented and virtuous, he assumed, would\nnaturally strive to exercise fully their talents and virtue through\npolitics and science.\n\nJefferson recognized two classes of people: laborers and learned (TJ\nto Peter Carr, 7 Sept. 1814). His distinction, however, was not\ndetermined by birth or wealth, as it was by most others of his day,\nbut by merit. To John Adams (28 Oct. 1813), Jefferson writes:\n\n\nThere is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are\nvirtue and talents.\n\n\nHe adds,\n\n\nThere is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth,\nwithout either virtue or talents; for with these it would belong to\nthe first class.\n\n\nWhat Jefferson claimed here was that the traditional, centuries-old\nclass distinction, founded on birth or wealth, was in effect\npolitically obsolete. What made men \u201cbest\u201d was talent\n(i.e., skill, ambition, and genius) and virtue.\n\nJefferson then tells Adams that the natural aristoi comprise\n\u201cthe most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the\ntrust, and government of society.\u201d He adds that that government\nis best which allows for \u201ca pure selection of these natural\naristoi into the offices of government.\u201d Through\n\u201cinstruction, trust, and government,\u201d the natural\naristoi will be not only political officials, but also\nteachers, trustees, and practitioners or patrons of\n science.[23]\n\nTo ensure that political offices will be held by the natural\naristoi, there must be, inter alia, public access to\ngeneral education and free presses for dissemination of information to\nthe citizenry. With the citizenry generally educated, one has,\nJefferson continues to Adams, merely \u201cto leave to the citizens\nthe free election and separation of the aristoi from the\npseudo-aristoi,\u201d and \u201cin general they will elect\nthe real good and\n wise.\u201d[24]\n That is much preferable to the centuries-old method of allowing the\nwealthy and wellborn to govern at the expense of the people.\n",
