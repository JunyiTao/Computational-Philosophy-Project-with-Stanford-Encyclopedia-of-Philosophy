    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Eternity of the world\n3.3 Eternity of the world\n\n\nThese two points bring us to a more extensive use of Philoponus by\nal-Kindi, in the latter\u2019s well-known argument that the world is\nnot eternal (for which see Davidson 1969 and 1987, and Staley 1987).\nMost Greek philosophers followed Aristotle in holding that the world is\neternal, meaning not only that it will never cease to exist, but that\nit has always existed. This was the doctrine of Aristotle and the\nStoics, and also of orthodox Neoplatonists, who interpreted\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus as likewise committed to the past\neternity of the world. Philoponus was an exception to this rule. In a\nwork rebutting the Neoplatonist Proclus\u2019 arguments in favor of\nthe world\u2019s eternity, he argued at great length that\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus rightly envisions a world with a\nbeginning in time. And in another work directed against Aristotle,\nPhiloponus tried to undermine the arguments of the De Caelo\nand Physics by which Aristotle had shown that the world is\neternal.\n\n\nIn section two of On First Philosophy, and several other\nshort works that repeat the same arguments found in this section,\nal-Kindi follows arguments that derive from Philoponus. (Exactly which\ntext or texts by Philoponus he used is unclear, but it would seem that\nhe at least knew parts of Against Aristotle.) Interestingly,\nal-Kindi completely ignores a major aspect of Philoponus\u2019\npolemic: in the De Caelo, Aristotle had argued that the\nheavens must be eternal, because they have perfect, circular motion and\nare therefore not made out of any of the corruptible four elements of\nour lower world. Whereas Philoponus attacks this cosmology with a\nlengthy and detailed refutation, al-Kindi simply accepts that the\nheavens are made out of an ungenerable and indestructible fifth element\n\u2013 but blithely adds that they are nonetheless originally brought\ninto being by God with a beginning in time. (For this see the treatise\nThat the Nature of the Celestial Sphere is Different from the\nNatures of the Four Elements, edited at Abu Rida 1953, 40\u20136.)\n\n\nWhen al-Kindi comes to argue explicitly against the eternity of the\nworld, he uses Philoponus\u2019 strategy of using Aristotle against\nhimself. Aristotle famously held that there can be no such thing as an\nactual infinite. Thus, for instance, the body of the world cannot be\ninfinitely large. Because the cosmos is finite in spatial magnitude,\nargues al-Kindi, nothing predicated of the body of the cosmos can be\ninfinite. Since time is one of the things predicated of this body, time\nmust be finite; therefore the world is not eternal.\n\n\nThis argument seems to be a poor one. Even if Aristotle admits that\nnothing infinite can be predicated of a finite body, he will want to\nsay that al-Kindi\u2019s argument fails to take full account of the\ndistinction between actual and merely potential\ninfinities. An actual infinity is an infinity which is simultaneously\npresent in its entirety \u2013 for example, an infinitely large body,\nor in general any set with an infinite number of members existing at\nthe same time. A potential infinity is when a finite magnitude can be\nextended or multiplied indefinitely. For example, Aristotle thinks\nthat any finite magnitude of space or time is potentially infinite, in\nthat it can in principle be divided into as many parts as one wishes,\nwith smaller divisions still possible. The body of the cosmos, as\nal-Kindi admits himself, is also potentially infinite, in the sense\nthat there is nothing conceptually impossible about increasing its\nsize indefinitely. Notice, though, that in either case the actual\nresult of such a process will be finite: any determinate addition to\nthe size of a body will still yield a body of finite size. Likewise,\nno matter how finely I divide a body, any particular act of division\nwill yield a finite number of parts.\n\n\nNow, Aristotle believes that the eternity of the world commits him\nonly to a potential infinity. This is because saying that the\nworld has always existed does not imply that any infinity is\npresently actual. Rather, it implies only that \u201cthe\nworld has already existed for N years\u201d will be true for\nany value of N. One can, so to speak, go as far as one wishes into the\npast, positing increasingly large (but still finite) periods of past\ntime, just as one can divide a body as finely as one wishes. And it is\nfar from clear that this sort of potential infinity is\ninapplicable to a finite magnitude. Does al-Kindi have any response to\nthis?\n\n\nHe does, though his response comes only at the end of his treatment\nof the world\u2019s eternity. The response, found also in Philoponus,\nis that even to reach the present moment, an actually infinite number\nof moments must already have elapsed. In other words, there is\ncurrently an actually infinite number of moments (or years, or\nwhatever) that have elapsed \u201csince the world began.\u201d And,\nas Aristotle himself says, the infinite cannot be traversed. Whether\nthis argument is successful is unclear. It seems to presuppose that we\nselect an infinitely distant point in past time, and then reckon the\nnumber of years that have elapsed since then. But Aristotle will\npresumably want to block the initial move of selecting an infinitely\ndistant point in past time, insisting that any particular\npoint we choose in the past will be removed from the present by a\nmerely finite number of years.\n",
