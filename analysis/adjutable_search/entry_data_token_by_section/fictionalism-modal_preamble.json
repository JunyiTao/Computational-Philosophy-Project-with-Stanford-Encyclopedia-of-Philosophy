    "main_text": "\n\nQuestions about necessity (or what has to be, or what cannot be\notherwise) and possibility (or what can be, or what could be\notherwise) are questions about modality.\nFictionalism is an approach to theoretical matters in a given\narea which treats the claims in that area as being in some sense\nanalogous to fictional claims: claims we do not literally accept at\nface value, but which we nevertheless think serve some useful\nfunction. However, despite its name, \u201cModal Fictionalism\u201d\nin its usual manifestations is not primarily fictionalism about claims\nof necessity and possibility, but rather a fictionalist approach to\nclaims about possible worlds. (For instance, modal fictionalism is not\nnormally fictionalist about the claim that \u201cit is possible that\nthere be a species of tail-less kangaroo\u201d, but rather about the\nclaim that \u201cthere is a possible world in which there is a\nspecies of tail-less kangaroo\u201d.) The practice of taking possible\nworlds to be merely convenient fictions, or of treating talk about\npossible worlds as being useful without being literally correct, is\nquite common in philosophical circles. It is only recently, however,\nthat philosophers have seriously examined the implications of taking\npossible worlds to be merely fictional objects, like Sherlock Holmes\nor a frictionless surface. \n\nTheories employing possible worlds terminology have been found to be\nvery useful in philosophy, e.g. when engaging in thought experiments;\ndistinguishing various claims in metaphysics, or in the philosophy of\nlanguage, mind, knowledge or ethics; and in areas other than\nphilosophy, like linguistics, modal logic, and probability theory.\nMany have found the status of these worlds and their contents to be\npuzzling, to say the least. What are they? Where, if anywhere, are\nthey supposed to be? How are we supposed to discover facts about them?\nIsn\u2019t it extravagant to believe that just because a situation is\npossible, it must in some sense exist? Modal fictionalists take\ntheories committed to the existence of possible worlds, merely\nhypothetical situations, non-actual but possible objects etc. to be\nstrictly and literally false, and so they avoid the problems of\nbelieving in possible worlds. Nevertheless, they claim, they can enjoy\nthe benefits of using these seemingly problematic theories.\n\nModal fictionalism should be of interest to those concerned with the\nmetaphysics of modality, since theories committed to the literal\nexistence of possible worlds (and, even more worryingly, the literal\nexistence of merely possible objects \u2018contained\u2019 in these\nworlds) come at a cost, both to economy and to many people\u2019s\nintuitions. But it is, or should be, of wider interest as well, since\nit is one of the most discussed applications of a fictionalist\ntreatment of abstract objects, along with mathematical fictionalism.\nLessons learned in the case of modal fictionalism can hopefully be\napplied to other areas in which we may wish to evade literal\ntheoretical commitments. Modal fictionalism continues to be an active\ntopic of research and debate, and as well as dozens of papers\nsupporting or criticising modal fictionalism, there is even a\npublished monograph on the topic (Warzoszczak\n 2014).\n\nI shall begin by discussing the motivation for modal fictionalism, and\ndistinguishing some of its varieties. Next, I shall discuss what\nconnection there might be between \u201cfictionalism\u201d and\ntreatments of paradigmatic fictions. I shall then discuss the debate\nabout the \u201cBrock/Rosen objection\u201d and a problem raised by\nBob Hale, both of which turn on technical problems concerning modal\nclaims about the status of the modal fiction. Finally, in section 4,\nother concerns about modal fictionalism will be discussed.\n",
