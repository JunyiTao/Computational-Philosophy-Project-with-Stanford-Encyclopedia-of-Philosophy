Here\u2019s\nan argument to the conclusion that backwards time travel simply will\nnot occur. If backwards time travel is ever going to occur,\nwe would already have seen the time travellers\u2014but we have seen\nnone such.[34]\nThe argument is a weak \n one.[35]\n For a start, it is perhaps not beyond\nreasonable doubt that time travellers have indeed visited the\n Earth[36]\u2014but\n even granting that they have\nnot, this is still compatible with the future actuality of backwards\ntime travel. First, it may be that time travel is very expensive,\ndifficult or dangerous\u2014or for some other reason quite\nrare\u2014and that by the time it is available, our present period of\nhistory is insufficiently high on the list of interesting\ndestinations. Second, it may be\u2014and indeed existing proposals in\nthe physics literature have this feature\u2014that backwards time\ntravel works by creating a CTC that lies entirely in the future: in\nthis case, backwards time travel becomes possible after the creation\nof the CTC, but travel to a time earlier than the time at which the\nCTC is created is not\n possible.[37]\n",
