    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts || Freedom and autonomy\n2.2 Freedom and autonomy\n\nContract law is based on the model (or idealization) of\n\u201cvoluntary exchange \u2026 between autonomous\nindividuals\u201d (Radin 2007: 196). Contracts are enforced on the\nassumption that parties possess the capacities necessary for informed\nand voluntary choice (R2: \u00a715), while fraud, duress, and various\nforms of pressure in bargaining represent grounds for recission (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7164, 175, 177). A preliminary question is why the law\nshould be so concerned with freedom and autonomy in contractual\nexchange. As previously discussed, the rearrangement of private\nproperty might be justified on grounds of efficiency or general\nwelfare (see\n \u00a71.3).\n The law\u2019s guiding principle could be hypothetical or reasonable\nconsent\u2014what parties would or should consent to\u2014rather\nthan actual consent. The importance of actual consent seems clear\nenough where exchange impinges on domains over which persons retain\nspecial sovereignty, including their own body and mind (Mill 1859;\nHill 1991; Enoch 2017). But not every contractual exchange impinges on\nbodily or mental integrity, and the importance of actual consent to\ncontracts at large is therefore not obvious.\n\nVoluntariness might be important to contracts for a number of reasons.\nA law of involuntary or forced exchange would risk people\u2019s\nwelfare, not just their autonomy. The parties\u2019 consent better\ntracks exchange efficiency than a court\u2019s judgment. Apart from\nwelfare concerns, if contractual obligation is grounded in promissory\nmorality (see\n \u00a71.1),\n then promissory principles constrain the law of contracts, including\nthose that condition an agent\u2019s responsibility on a promise\nhaving been made freely (Hurd 1996). The choice condition avoids\nunfairly holding individuals to duties that they lacked a reasonable\nopportunity to avoid incurring (cf. Scanlon 1998, Watson 1996).\n\nSince voluntariness in contract likely serves several distinct\nnormative functions, its analysis presents a challenge. What powers\nmust an agent exercise over her contractual affairs for her\nobligations to count as voluntarily undertaken? The law deems agents\nincapable of contracting if they lack either (1) the ability to\nunderstand the nature of a transaction and be responsive to reasons\nfor and against agreeing to it (see R2: \u00a715 and Buckareff and\nKasper-Buckareff 2014; on reasons-responsiveness as a general\ncriterion for moral responsibility, see Fischer and Ravizza 1998), or\n(2) the ability to exercise a degree of control over their choices.\nBix (2010) suggests that the common law follows Aristotle in treating\nan agent\u2019s knowledge and capacity to respond to her reasons, and\nnot just her capacity to act on desires she identifies with, as\nconstitutive of her freedom to contract. In addition to general\nincapacity, the common law recognizes specific threats to contractual\nfreedom, including lack of material information due to fraud or\nnon-disclosure, intoxication, duress, and, to a lesser extent,\ncognitive biases when preyed upon within a relationship of trust (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7 16, 161\u2013163, 173\u2013175). The precise content of\nthese rules is controversial. For instance, there is no legal\nrequirement that parties disclose all relevant information in the\ngeneric commercial transaction (F. Miller & Wertheimer 2010), and\nthe line separating permissible from impermissible information\nasymmetries is deeply contested (Kronman 1978; Craswell 2006).\n\nThe concept of duress is similarly fraught. The law distinguishes\n\u201cphysical duress\u201d, which bypasses the coercee\u2019s\nrational control over her actions, from duress via \u201cwrongful\nthreats\u201d which operates through the will of the coercee (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7 174-5; cf. Nozick 1969). A threat is considered wrongful\nwhen the threatened consequence leaves the coercee with \u201cno\nreasonable alternatives\u201d to compliance. The law does not give\ndetailed guidance on the baseline of \u201creasonable\nalternatives\u201d against which the wrongfulness of a threat might\nbe measured. The question of the baseline has attracted significant\ncommentary in the philosophical literature on coercion. Nozick (1969:\n446) offers a characterization in terms of the \u201cnormal or\nnatural or expected course of events\u201d. Others have analyzed the\nbaseline in explicitly normative terms, as a set of options that\npersons ought to have as a matter of right (Wertheimer 1987; cf.\nBerman 2002). While the paradigmatic threat (\u201cyour money or your\nlife\u201d) makes the coercee worse off relative to her baseline\nregardless of compliance, threats in commercial exchange are often\nmore subtle. An offeror might threaten to worsen the offeree\u2019s\nsituation if she refuses an offer, even if its acceptance would be\nbaseline-improving. To illustrate, if workers refuse to work under the\nterms of an existing contract unless the employer consents to a\nmodification, the employer may be under duress even if the proposed\nmodification is mutually beneficial.\n\nA precise account of when an agent lacks \u201creasonable\nalternatives\u201d might help distinguish wrongful threats from\npermissible offers, given that offers, like threats, aim to influence\nbehavior, and might be experienced by the offeree as leaving her no\noption but to accept. Several theorists have argued that\nbaseline-improving offers can be coercive. On David Zimmerman\u2019s\n(1981) view, an offer is coercive if its acceptance locks the offeree\ninto a life situation that prevents her from seeking better\nalternatives than what the offeror proposes. Joan McGregor (1988)\nsuggests shifting focus from baseline improvement to whether the\nofferor exercises power over the offeree within a relationship of\ndependence. On McGregor\u2019s analysis, an offeror exercises power\nwhen she has control over a considerable harm that might fall on the\nofferee (see also O\u2019Neill 1991; Pettit 1996). While the analysis\nmay not quite fit the law\u2019s concept of duress, it is arguably\nimplicit in the common law\u2019s unconscionability doctrine, which\npolices one-sided contracts between parties with unequal bargaining\npower. For a more detailed discussion of the distinction between\noffers and threats, see the entry on\n coercion.\n\nIn addition to threats and exploitative offers, agents may be subject\nto influences in the bargaining process that impair their ability to\ndecide rationally or based on their considered and robust desires (on\nconceptions of freedom that identify some but not all of the\nagent\u2019s desires with her will, see, e.g., Frankfurt 1973 [1988],\nYaffe 2007). A seller might take advantage of a buyer\u2019s\ninnumeracy or cognitive biases in eliciting her consent. While the law\nrecognizes a category of \u201cundue influence\u201d as grounds for\nrecission, the doctrine\u2019s application, in addition to being\nundertheorized, is usually limited to cases involving a special\nrelationship of trust. It is widely acknowledged, however, that\nrationality failures can be exploited within exchange relationships,\nand the potential for exploitation is often the basis for regulatory\nintervention. A comprehensive analysis of freedom in contract should\ntherefore clarify what forms of persuasion count as instances of\nwrongful control, a question that accounts of duress and uninformed\nconsent do not necessarily address.\n",
