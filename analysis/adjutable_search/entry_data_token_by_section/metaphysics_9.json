Many contemporary social metaphysicians investigate\nthe ontological natures of socially constructed groups, entities, and\ninstitutions. Key questions include: what, exactly, are corporations,\nrestaurants, and sports teams? What is the nature of money? What are\nthe natures of social categories, like woman, Black,\nlesbian, and disabled? What is the relationship\nbetween individuals and macro-level social objects? What does it mean\nto say that something is \u201csocially constructed,\u201d and what\nis the difference between the social and the natural in the first\nplace?\n\nRitchie (2013, 2015, 2020a and 2020b) draws a distinction between\n\u201cType 1\u201d social groups like corporations and institutions,\nwhich are organized and structured, and \u201cType 2\u201d social\ngroups, like Blacks and women, which are less structured social kinds.\nEpstein (2019) argues against these sorts of course-grained\nclassifications, preferring to classify them according to their\ninter-level metaphysical relationships. Ruben (1985) denies that\nsocial groups and other macro-level social entities can be reduced to\nindividuals. Korman (2020) takes up the question of the nature of\nestablishments like restaurants in further detail, suggesting that\nthey are neither material objects nor constituted by the buildings\nthat they occupy. Uzquiano (2004) questions the persistence conditions\nof social groups like the Supreme Court, and ultimately argues that\nthey are similar to the persistence conditions for artifacts. Drawing\non this idea, Richardson (2022) holds that social groups are concrete\nmaterial particulars, since two different social groups can have\nexactly the same members. \n\nOther metaphysicians examine the ontological status of money, and\nespecially the status of virtual currency like bitcoin. Passinsky\n(2020) distinguishes between descriptive and normative approaches to\nexploring the topic, and argues in favor of the latter. In contrast,\nWarmke (2021) takes a descriptive approach, suggesting that bitcoin is\na fictional substance in a collectively co-authored story.\n\nThere has also been a recent surge of interest in the metaphysics of\nrace and gender. Haslanger (2000) famously holds that (roughly)\nx is a woman if one is oppressed on the basis of her\nwomanhood. Haslanger\u2019s approach is ameliorative, taking into\naccount what sorts of concepts of gender and race might be most useful\nin theorizing. Friendly to this approach, \u00c1sta (2018) proposes\na conferralist account of social categories, according to which social\ncategories are externally conferred on individuals in specific\ncontexts. Others have taken on the topic of the natures of more\nspecific sorts of social categories: Bernstein (2020) suggests that\nintersectional social categories like Black woman are to be\nviewed as explanatorily unified and prior to the individual\nconstituents like Black and woman. Jorba and\nRod\u00f3 de Z\u00e1rate (2019) propose a framework of properties\nand emergent experience to account for intersectionality.\n\nDembroff (2016) takes up the puzzle of sexual orientation, arguing for\n\u201cBidimensional Dispositionalism.\u201d According to that view,\na person\u2019s sexual orientation is grounded in a person\u2019s\ndispositions to engage in sexual behaviors under the ordinary\nconditions for these dispositions. A person\u2019s dispositions\ninclude sexes and genders of persons that one is disposed to sexually\nengage with under those conditions. Andler (2021) draws a distinction\nbetween sexual orientation and sexual identity, arguing that the\nlatter is a more suitable and more explanatorily powerful category for\ncapturing the relevant phenomenon.\n\nThere is even a burgeoning meta-metaphysics of the social world,\nexamining whether the central questions of social metaphysics are\nsubstantive. Barnes (2017) and Mikkola (2017) challenge Sider\u2019s\n(2012) conception of a substantive question in metaphysics, on the\ngrounds that it does not accommodate substantive questions in the\nmetaphysics of gender. Richardson (forthcoming) disagrees. And while\nsocial metaphysics is often taken to contrast with so-called\n\u201cfundamental\u201d metaphysics (as in McKitrick (2018)),\nseveral philosophers have recently pointed out that elements of the\nsocial world might be fundamental, including Mason and Ritchie (2020)\nand Bernstein (2021). Social metaphysics can be viewed as a\ncounterexample to the thesis that metaphysics is the study of\nfundamental reality, as suggested in Bennett (2017). Passinsky (2021)\nholds that Finean metaphysics is a good framework for feminist\nmetaphysics. Others such as Hacking (1999) and D\u00edaz-Le\u00f3n\n(2015) investigate what it is for something to be socially\nconstructed.
