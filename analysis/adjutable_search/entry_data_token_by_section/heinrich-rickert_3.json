    "main_text": "The philosophy of values and the philosophy of history\n4. The philosophy of values and the philosophy of history\n\nFundamental progress in the cultural sciences with respect to\ntheir objectivity, their universality, and their arrangement in a\ncoherent system, is dependent on progress in the development of an\nobjective and systematically articulated concept of culture, i.e., on\nthe approach to a knowledge of value based on a system of valid\nvalues.\n(Rickert 1962, 139\u2013140)\n\n\n\nWhile Rickert does not believe that significant progress in the\nhistorical sciences of culture can be expected from the development of\npsychology, he believes that a philosophy of history grounded\nin an unconditionally valid system of values (Rickert 1924a, 118) would\nbe of paramount importance. If philosophy were able to identify and\njustify a formal set of values common to all cultures and historical\nconstellations, then the historical sciences could employ such a formal\nset of values to orient their inquiries. In order to do this, however,\nphilosophy cannot simply rely on empirical generalizations. Given the\nmultiplicity of cultures and the complexity of human history, it would\nbe impossible to adopt a generalizing procedure in order to identify a\nrobust set of values common to all. \u201cRather, it would be\nappropriate to reflect (completely independently of the multiplicity of\nthe historical material) on that which holds valid by necessity, that\nis, the formal presupposition of each value-judgment claiming more than\nindividual validity. Only when such timelessly valid formal values are\nfound will it be possible to relate them to the plenitude of\nempirically detectable values actually developed in history\u201d\n(Rickert 1924a, 118). Rickert underscores in various places that such\nsystem, however, should be understood as completely \u201copen\u201d\n(Rickert 1913, 297; Rickert 1921b, 348\u2013355; see Bohlken 2002, 124).\nThis means that it is intended to provide merely the \u201cmost\nencompassing framework in which all meaningful cultural life plays\nitself out\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 225). The areas of values identified\nin the system can be filled with the most diverse concrete historical\nvalues.\n\n\nRickert\u2019s first attempt to articulate a timelessly valid\nsystem of values can be found in his paper On the System of\nValues (Rickert 1913). The position developed here was eventually\nrecast and schematized visually in the first (and only) volume of his\nSystem of Philosophy (Rickert 1921b). Rickert begins his\ninquiry by describing different kinds of goods, that is,\nconcrete objects related to values. His intent is to read off the\nobjectively valid values from concrete classes of goods. The human\ncreation of goods related to values follows a general impulse towards\n\u201ccompletion\u201d (Vollendung), which can be best\ndescribed as the attainment of a certain goal. Moreover, each\nrealization of values in a good can be understood as the work on a\ncertain \u2018content\u2019, which receives a value-related form.\nSuch content can be interpreted as a whole consisting of\nparts. Starting from these abstract distinctions, Rickert\nidentifies three domains of goods, that of the \u201cuncompletable\n(unendlich) totality\u201d, that of \u201cfully completed\n(voll-endlich) particularity\u201d and that which synthesizes\nthe two in a \u201cfully completed totality\u201d (Rickert 1913,\n302). To each of these domains of goods Rickert assigns a temporal\ndimension, such that the goods of un-ending totality are goods of the\nfuture, those of fully completed particularity are goods of the present\nand those of fully completed totality are goods of eternity. A further\noverarching distinction, however, cuts across these three domains of\ngoods, thus giving as a result six domains: the distinction\nbetween contemplation and activity, whose parallel categories\nof objects are \u201cthing\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d. After\nfleshing out this general scheme Rickert fills in the six domains with\nactual values and the corresponding cultural activities according to\nthe following schema (Rickert 1921b, annex):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoods: asocial matters (Sachen)\nSubjective Comportment: monistic contemplation\nForm: encompassing\n\nStages of completeness\n\nGoods: social persons\nSubjective Comportment:  pluralistic activity\nForm: pervading\n\n\n\n\nDomain of Logic (1)\nValue: truth\nGood: science\nSubjective Comportment: judgment\nWorldview: intellectualism\n\n\nFIRST STAGE\nUn-completable totality\nGoods of the future\n\n\nDomain of Ethics (4)\nValue: morality (Sittlichkeit)\nGood: community of free people\nSubjective Comportment: autonomous action\nWorldview: moralism (Moralismus)\n\n\n\n\nDomain of Aesthetics (2)\nValue: beauty\nGood: art\nSubjective Comportment: intuition (anschauen)\nWorldview: aestheticism\n\n\nSECOND STAGE\nFully completed particularity\nGoods of the present\n\n\nDomain of Erotics (5)\nValue: happiness (Gl\u00fcck)\nGood: loving community\nSubjective Comportment: inclination\u2014devotion (Hingabe)\nWorldview: eudaemonism\n\n\n\n\nSystem of Philosophy (8)\nComprehensive theory of worldviews\n\n\nINTERMEDIATE STAGE\nImmanent syntheses\n\n\nLove between man and woman (7)\nWorldview: eroticism\n\n\n\n\nDomain of Mystics (3)\nValue: impersonal sanctity\nGood: the All-One (world-mystery)\nSubjective Comportment: solitude (Abgeschiedenheit) (divinization)\nWorldview: Mysticism\n\n\nTHIRD STAGE\nFully completed totality\nGoods of eternity\n(Transcendent syntheses)\n\n\nDomain of the Philosophy of Religion (6)\nValue: personal sanctity\nGood: the world of god (G\u00f6tterwelt)\nSubjective comportment:  piety\nWorldview: Theism\u2014Polytheism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following points are distinctive of Rickert\u2019s approach to\nvalues as presented in the above table:\n\n\n(1) Note that Rickert distinguishes the way in which values\nrelate to their materials in the spheres of contemplation and in the\nsphere of practice. In his language, the value of truth\n\u2018encompasses\u2019 scientific theories and likewise the value of\nbeauty encompasses works of art. This means that the value is\nexperienced as something essentially \u2018beyond\u2019 the\nparticular theory or artwork at issue. On the contrary, in the sphere\nof practice values \u2018pervade\u2019 their materials, that is to\nsay they structure them \u2018from within\u2019, as it were.\n \n\n(2) Rickert prides himself on having \u2018discovered\u2019 and\ndefended the autonomy of the fifth domain of values, which he labels\n\u2018erotics\u2019 (Rickert 1913, 313\u2013319). Erotics is the\nsphere of practical life in which subjects cultivate specific values\nattaching to their relationships to particular people or groups of\npeople. According to Rickert in the philosophical tradition this\nautonomous domain has been unduly overshadowed by the domain of\nethics, which constantly tried to impose its distinctive values on\nerotics (Rickert 1921b, 406). However, for Rickert our practical life\nwould be unbearable if it were dedicated exclusively to the pursuit of\nethical values and the utopian ideal of a community of free subjects\n(that is, Kant\u2019s kingdom of ends). We need a particular sphere of\nrelationships in which the practical thrust of our social life finds\nfull realization in the present. The values characterizing these\nspheres, such as family, homeland, religious community, etc. need to\nbe respected and studied as a class of values in its own right.\n\n\n(3) Rickert assigns an important role to religion in the\ntotality of cultural life (see Crowe 2010). He points out an inevitable\ntension between the pursuit of goods of totality in domains (1) and\n(4), which are ultimately unattainable in our earthly life, and the\npursuit of goods of particularity in (2) and (5), which are fully\nattainable but inevitably finite. Religion opens up the space for\n\u2018transcendent syntheses\u2019, in which this tension is overcome\nthrough the pursuit of goods of eternity. These, in Rickert\u2019s\nview, do justice to both our human desire for infinity and our human\nneed for actually experienced fulfillment. Mysticism thus offers a\ntranscendent synthesis between the sense of fulfillment characterizing\naesthetic contemplation and the unending process of scientific\ntheorein via conceptual knowledge. Similarly, the religious\ndevotion to a divinity experienced as \u2018dwelling among us\u2019\n(in both polytheistic and monotheistic religions) promises a\ntranscendent synthesis between the values of ethics and those of\nerotics.\n\n\n(4) For Rickert, however, the transcendent syntheses promised\nby religion are prefigured, as it were, in two earthly kinds of\nsyntheses, that is, the love between man and woman in the sphere of\npractice and the production of a philosophical system oriented towards\na comprehensive worldview-theory in the sphere of contemplation. As for\nthe love between man and woman, Rickert\u2019s view rests on the\ndubious assumption that women are \u201cessentially\u201d more\noriented toward the realization of goods of the present, while men are\n\u201cessentially\u201d more oriented toward the realization of goods\nof the future (Rickert 1921b, 403). Since no meaningful existence can\nbe devoted exclusively to one type of goods (the goods of the\nfuture being ultimately unattainable and the goods of the present being\nultimately too narrow), Rickert argues that the \u201cpersonal\nunion\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 402) between man and woman amounts to a\nmutual completion and a synthesis of the two domains of values.\nNeedless to say, to a contemporary reader this view sounds extremely\nantiquated and even sexist. However, it has to be interpreted in the\ncontext of Rickert\u2019s time. In his eyes, insisting on the mutual\ncompletion and irreducibility of the values traditionally associated\nwith masculinity and those traditionally associated with feminineness\n(Rickert 1921b, 403) was a way to defend the equal value of men and\nwomen in the whole of cultural life. Philosophy as a worldview-theory\nbased on the system of values, in turn, can provide a comprehensive\npicture of the world in which all contemplative and practical activity\ntakes place. To the extent that it strives towards a comprehensive\nsystem, however, philosophy tends to exceed the sphere of theoretical\ngoods (Rickert 1921b, 408). Instead of partaking in the indefinitely\nopen work of the specialized sciences philosophy attempts to survey the\ntotality of cultural life and to systematically determine its\nunderlying value-related structure. In each successfully articulated\nphilosophical system we then find a completed cultural good,\nwhich differs from the characteristic open-endedness of theories in the\nspecialized sciences. The philosopher thus occupies the middle ground\nbetween the scientist moving indefinitely forward in her specialized\ninvestigations and the artist striving to produce a complete\nartwork. Philosophy, then, can then be considered an immanent synthesis\nbetween the unending totality characterizing the goods of science and\nthe particularity characterizing the goods of art.\n",
