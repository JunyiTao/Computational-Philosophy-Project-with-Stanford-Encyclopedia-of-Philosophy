Realism and Anti-Realism in Meta-Ontology\n\nDebates in meta-ontology (analytic ontology) over the last twenty\nyears have sparked renewed interest in realism. They have also seen a\nmarked shift in how realism, i.e. ontological realism, is understood.\n\u201cThe central question of metaontology\u201d, Theodore Sider, a\nprominent ontological realist, contends, \u201cis that of whether\nthere are many equally good quantifier meanings, or whether there is a\nsingle best quantifier meaning.\u201d [Sider 2009, p.397]. Where\nSider argues for a single best quantifier meaning, Eli Hirsch believes\nthere are a multiplicity of possible quantifier meanings that are\nequally good, a thesis he calls Quantifier Variance. This\nmeaning-theoretic focus is something\n new.[10]\n\n\nIt is no surprise, then, to find that the positions marked out as\n\u2018realist\u2019 and \u2018anti-realist\u2019 by those engaged\nin ontological disputes do not always coincide with realism and\nanti-realism as we have explained these metaphysical\n views.[11]\n\nA more significant division is between metaontologists who accept a\nrobust conception of ontology, and deflationists about\nontology who don\u2019t. Sider defends robust ontology [Sider 2009,\n385\u2013386]:\n\n\u201contological deflationists\u201d\u2026 have said \u2026 when some\nparticles are arranged tablewise, there is no\n\u201csubstantive\u201d question of whether there also exists a\ntable composed of those particles. There are simply different \u2014\nand equally good \u2014 ways to talk. I, on the other hand, accept a\nvery strong realism about ontology. I think that questions about the\nexistence of composite objects are substantive, just as substantive as\nthe question of whether there are extra-terrestrials.\n\n\nNeo-Carnapians such as Putnam, Eli Hirsch, David Chalmers, Amie\nThomasson, and Huw Price are ontological deflationists who embrace\nconceptual pluralism about ontological matters. Hirsch, however,\nthinks conceptual pluralism is perfectly consistent with realism\n[Hirsch, E. 2002]. Matti Eklund understands Hirsch to mean that he\nconsiders the world to be an amorphous lump [Eklund, M., 2008] (citing\nMichael Dummett), a \u2018lump\u2019 that alternative and equally\nfeasible conceptual schemes serve to make intelligible. For Sider, in\ncontrast, rejecting an intrinsic structure to the world is to reject\n realism.[12]\n\n\nCompeting views about temporal persistence do not seem to be semantic\nin nature. While Perdurantists believe that things persist through\ntime by virtue of having temporal parts that perdure,\nEndurantists reject the notion of temporal parts as incoherent\n\u2014things persist by enduring: they are wholly present\nwhenever they exist. As observed in the entry on\n temporal parts:\n\nThis looks like a straightforward ontological disagreement, a dispute\nabout what exists.\n\n\nEli Hirsch is not convinced, however:\n\nI claim that the dispute between Endurantists and Perdurantists is\nverbal \u2026 each party ought to agree the other party speaks a truth in\nhis own language. [Hirsch 2011, 229]\n\n\nHow can this be? Endurantists think perdurantists are guilty of\nspatializing time when they talk about temporal parts; perdurantists\nthink enduring objects cannot explain change. How can there be a\nrapprochement of the sort Hirsch has in mind?\n\nHirsch\u2019s novel and intriguing idea is that what makes the\nendurantist/perdurantist temporal parts debate and the\nnihilist/universalist mereological debate merely verbal ones is the\nfact that the protagonists in these debates mean different things by\ntheir quantifiers, in particular their existential quantifiers, in\ntheir ontological assertions. While both protagonists speak a common\nlanguage, here English, in which certain ontological claims such as\n\u2018there are tables\u2019 happen to come out true, this is a\nsuperficial socio-linguistic fact about English that might not have\nbeen so: we and they could just as easily have spoken English* (an\nontological nihilist language) in which the sentence \u2018there are\ntables\u2019 came out false. Protagonists in these ontological\ndisputes are, unwittingly, engaged in a \u2018merely verbal\u2019\ndebate and are thus talking past each\n other.[13]\n\n\nHow does the deflationist tell that an ontological dispute is a\n\u2018merely verbal\u2019 one? Hirsch thinks that when we interpret\nthe words of another, we assign truth-conditions to their sentences by\nmatching those sentences with sets of possible worlds, guided by the\nmetasemantic maxim that the speaker\u2019s assertion of those\nsentences should come out true. The maxim applies to ontological\ndisputes such as the Ernie/Maxi dispute about mereology \u2014 there\nare possible languages in which both speakers\u2019 assertions come\nout true. Hirsch contends: \u201cspeakers of either language should\nallow that speakers of the other language assert sentences that have\nthe same characters (DK: functions from contexts of utterance to\ntruth-conditions) and the same truth-values as they themselves\nassert.\u201d [Hirsch 2009, p.242]. \n\nIn this way Ernie should attribute the same set of possible worlds\n(intensions) to Maxi\u2019s sentence \u2018There are seven objects\nin your bag\u2019 as he associates with his own sentence \u2018There\nare three objects in my bag\u2019 and Ernie should interpret Maxi as\nuttering a truth in so doing. Ernie and Maxi are asserting the very\nsame proposition but are using different words to express it. They\nare, as a result, simply talking past each other. \n\nHirsch\u2019s doctrine of quantifier variance QV dominates current\nmetaontological debate. Some have questioned whether interpreters on\none side of an ontological dispute can admit that the language of\nthose on the other side is possible. For to do so each interpreter\nmust be able to provide a Tarskian semantics for the other\u2019s\nlanguage. But an Endurantist won\u2019t be able to do this for the\nPerdurantist\u2019s sentence such as \u2018Alicet is a\ntemporal part of Alice\u2019 since the predicate \u2018is a temporal\npart of\u2019 has an empty extension in the Endurantist\u2019s\nlanguage [Hawthorne 2006; Eklund 2009]. Others suspect QV is an\ninternally unstable position: how can an Endurantist speaking her\nlanguage E allow that a sentence like \u2018Alicet is a\ntemporal part of Alice\u2019 is a true sentence of the\nPerdurantist\u2019s language P without admitting that there are\ntemporal parts [e.g. Hale and Wright 2009; Dorr 2014]? Warren 2015\nprovides a convincing QV response to this \u2018Collapse\u2019\nargument. An important resource, containing papers by some of the\nauthors cited, is the collection of essays anthologised in Chalmers et\nal 2009 [For background on mereology see the entry\n mereology\n and for discussion of whether there are composite objects, see the\nentry\n material constitution\n and the entry\n ordinary objects].\n \n\nThe meaning-theoretic focus on Quantifier Variance in metaontology\nrepresents a fascinating development. The implications for ontological\nrealism are as yet undecided.\n",
