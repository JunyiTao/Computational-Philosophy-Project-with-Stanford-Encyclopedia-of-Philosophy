    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nRawls was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a\nprominent lawyer, his mother was a chapter president of the League of\nWomen Voters. Rawls studied at Princeton and Cornell, where he was\ninfluenced by Wittgenstein\u2019s student Norman Malcolm; and at\nOxford, where he worked with H. L. A. Hart, Isaiah Berlin, and Stuart\nHampshire. His first professorial appointments were at Cornell and\nMIT. In 1962 Rawls joined the faculty at Harvard, where he taught for\nmore than thirty years.\n\nRawls\u2019s adult life was a scholarly one: its major events\noccurred within his writings. The exceptions were two wars. As a\ncollege student, Rawls wrote an intensely religious senior thesis\n(BI) and had considered studying for the priesthood. Yet\nRawls lost his Christian faith as an infantryman in World War II on\nseeing the capriciousness of death in combat and learning of the\nhorrors of the Holocaust. Then in the 1960s, Rawls spoke out against\nthe draft for the Vietnam war because it discriminated against black\nand poor Americans. The Vietnam conflict impelled Rawls to analyze the\ndefects in the American political system that led it to prosecute so\nruthlessly what he saw as an unjust war, and to consider how citizens\ncould conscientiously resist their government\u2019s aggressive\npolicies.\n\nRawls\u2019s most discussed work is his theory of a just liberal\nsociety, called justice as fairness. Rawls first set out\njustice as fairness in systematic detail in his 1971 book, A\nTheory of Justice. Rawls continued to rework justice as fairness\nthroughout his life, restating the theory in Political\nLiberalism (1993), The Law of Peoples (1999), and\nJustice as Fairness (2001).\n\nThis entry reflects Rawls\u2019s final statement of his views on\njustice as fairness, as well as on political liberalism and on the law\nof peoples. Some recent scholarship on Rawls\u2019s work can be found\nin\n Further Reading\n below.\n",
