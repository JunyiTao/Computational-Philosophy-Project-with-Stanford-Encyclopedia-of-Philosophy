    "main_text": "Psychology || Associationism, Introspectionism, and Physiological Psychology\n2.1 Associationism, Introspectionism, and Physiological Psychology\n\nDewey entered the field of psychology while it was dominated by\nintrospectionism (arising from associationism, a.k.a.,\n\u201cmentalism\u201d) and the newer physiological psychology\n(imported from Germany). Earlier British empiricists, such as John\nLocke and David Hume, accounted for intelligent behavior with (1)\ninternally inspected (\u201cintrospected\u201d) entities, including\nperceptual experiences (e.g., \u201cimpressions\u201d), and (2)\nthoughts or ideas (e.g., \u201cimages\u201d). These accrue toward\nintelligence by way of an elaborate process of associative learning.\nDiscovery-by-introspection was indispensable for many empiricists, and\nfor many physiological and experimental psychologists (e.g., Wundt) as\nwell.\n\nDewey was deeply influenced by his graduate school study of\nphysiological psychology with G. Stanley Hall; classes included\ntheoretical, physiological, and experimental psychology; he conducted\nlaboratory experiments on attention. Unlike introspectionism,\nHall\u2019s methods incorporated strict experimental controls, and\nthis biology-based approach promised Dewey an organic and holistic\nmodel of experience capable of overcoming the subjectivist dualisms\nplaguing the older, associationist\n models.[2]\n However, Dewey still found physiological psychology retaining an\natomized and mechanistic view of experience based on \u201csense\ndata\u201d. From his Hegelian perspective, this psychology could\nnever account for the wider world of lived meanings, the\nsocio-cultural environment. In other words, \u201corganism\u201d\nentailed \u201cenvironment\u201d, and \u201cenvironment\u201d\nentailed \u201cculture\u201d. A rigorously empirical psychology\ncould not merely study \u201cthe\u201d mind, but had to forge\nconnections with other\n sciences.[3]\n",
