    "main_text": "Arguments For Internalism\n7. Arguments For Internalism\n\nOne line of argument that can be offered in favor of accessibility\ninternalism, though one that has seldom found explicit expression in\nthe literature, trades on the idea that one is justified in believing\np only if one has justified the belief that\np. (Leite 2003 discusses the connection between being\njustified and justifying.) Justifying a belief, of course, is an\nactivity in which one adduces evidence or reasons in favor of the\nbelief, and when one is engaged in this activity one is actively aware\nof the evidence or reasons brought forward. Of course, if one actually\nis aware of these bits of evidence or reasons, then certainly one can\nbe aware of them. These items of evidence or reasons offered in the\nact of justifying, we may say, are the justifiers for the belief in\nquestion. Hence, if being justified implies having\njustified, then being justified implies that one can be aware of the\njustifiers. So, we might conclude, the mere fact that there are\njustified beliefs implies accessibility internalism.\n\nThere are, however, two important problems with this argument. First,\nthe major premise of the argument seems false. A very large percentage\nof one's of justified beliefs were never justified in the manner\nenvisioned. We need only recall the example of rapid acquisition of\nmany perceptual beliefs, all of them justified. But none were\njustified by any activity engaged in by the cognizer, either at the\nmoment of acquisition or at any later time. Moreover, second, even if\neach justified belief was at some time justified, this fact implies\nonly that there was some time at which the cognizer could be aware by\nreflection of the relevant justifiers. It hardly follows that the\ncognizer can be reflectively aware of these justifiers at any time she\ncares to try, and it is this sort of accessibility that internalism\nrequires. If accessibility internalism were merely the thesis that for\neach justified belief p, there is some time at which the\ncognizer can be aware of the essential justifiers for the belief that\np, then accessibility externalism would become the thesis\nthat there is never a time at which the cognizer can be\nreflectively aware of the relevant justifiers. Yet the externalist\nposition is the much more modest point that there are some cases of\njustified belief where the cognizer is unable to be reflectively aware\nof the essential justifiers. Defense of accessibility internalism on\nthe grounds that being justified implies having actually justified\nwould make externalism into far too strong a thesis.\n\nAnother possible argument for accessibility internalism trades on\nbeing able to justify one's belief. The idea is that one is justified\nin believing p only if one can justify the belief that\np. If one were to actually engage in justifying this belief,\nthen at that time one would be aware of the justifiers. So, if one can\njustify the belief that p, it is reasonable to think that one\ncan be reflectively aware of the justifiers for p.\n\nHere, again, we would have to contend with the examples of young\ncognizers who certainly have justified beliefs but are in no position\nintellectually to justify those beliefs. They simply lack the\ncognitive wherewithal to engage in that sort of activity, but this\nfact does not prevent them from having beliefs that are justified.\nThus, the core idea in this argument for internalism is false. There\nis also another problem, even if the core idea could be sustained. Any\nactivity of actually justifying a belief is context and audience\nsensitive. What one would say by way of justifying the belief that\np in a context of one sort, made up of an audience of highly\nsophisticated cognizers, is apt to be quite different from what one\nwould say in a different context and to an audience of quite\nna\u00efve cognizers. For this reason, it is difficult to say which if\nany of the things one would offer in an activity of justifying would\nactually constitute the set of justifiers for the given belief. What\none would identify as justifiers in such activities would be subject\nto such variability, that it is hard to see how we could select any\nsub-set of such items and safely maintain that they are the\njustifiers.\n\nThe last two arguments, making use of the idea, first, that being\njustified implies having justified, and then second, that being\njustified implies being able to justify, may be taken to show a key\nway that defenders of accessibility internalism may conceive of\njustified belief or knowledge. The paradigm they may have in mind is\nthat being justified in believing that p is a state one\nachieves by working things out, reasoning through some sequence of\nevidentiary steps and then drawing a conclusion that counts as the\njustified belief. When one engages in reasoning of this type one is\naware of the steps through which one reasons and, inter alia,\nalso aware of the justifiers that serve to support one's conclusion.\nFollowing this line of thought, it is perhaps natural to think that\none can recapitulate at a later time the reasoning one went through\nenroute to one's justified belief. If this is so, then surely one can\njustify one's belief, and thus be reflectively aware of the justifiers\nfor that belief.\n\nIt cannot be denied that one often arrives at beliefs, including\njustified ones, in just this fashion. It should also be clear,\nhowever, that a great many beliefs, including many justified ones, are\nnot acquired or sustained in this manner. We need only remind\nourselves of how much knowledge and justified belief is gotten from\nperceptual experience and we then realize that a great many items of\nknowledge and justified belief are not arrived at via reasoning,\nhowever generously we construe that operation.\n",
