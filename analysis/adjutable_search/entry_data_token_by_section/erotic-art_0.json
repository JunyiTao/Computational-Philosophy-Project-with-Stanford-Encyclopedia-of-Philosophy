    "main_text": "What is Erotic Art? || A Definition of Erotic Art\n1.1 A Definition of Erotic Art\n\nIn Sex and Reason, Richard Posner proposes to use the word\n\u201cerotic\u201d to describe\n\n\npresentations and representations that are, or at least are taken by\nsome viewers to be, in some sense \u201cabout\u201d sexual activity.\n(Posner 1994: 351)\n\n\nThis characterization needs some narrowing down if one wants to arrive\nat a definition that captures the extension of what we ordinarily\nthink counts as erotic art. For one thing, an extensionally adequate\ndefinition should exclude scientific-behavioral studies or medical\nillustrations of sexual activity (which tend to be neither erotic nor\nartistic in nature). Furthermore, it\u2019s not the case, simply\nbecause some viewers take a painting or a sculpture to be about sexual\nactivity, that we are ipso facto dealing with an erotic\nrepresentation. Someone who is unfamiliar with the story of the\nChristian Bible might take a crucifixion painting to be a depiction of\na sado-masochistic act, but that would be insufficient grounds to\ncall, say, Tintoretto\u2019s Crucifixion\n(1565) a work of erotic art.\n\nPeter Webb\u2019s definition of erotic art as\n\n\nart on a sexual theme related specifically to emotions rather than\nmerely actions, and sexual depictions which are justifiable on\naesthetic grounds (Webb 1975: 2)\n\n\nis already closer to the mark. But even though Webb\u2019s emphasis\non emotions is understandable from an etymological point of\nview\u2014the term \u201cerotic\u201d derives from the Greek word\n\u201ceros\u201d meaning love or passion\u2014he does not succeed\nin spelling out the necessary or sufficient conditions for erotic art.\nMan Ray\u2019s photograph The Prayer\n(1930) shows only the hands, feet, and buttocks of a woman; it\nis not a sexual depiction in the strict sense and there is no show of\nemotions. Still, it is widely considered to be an erotic masterpiece.\nConversely, Ian McEwan\u2019s novella On Chesil\nBeach, set in the early 1960s and telling the story of a\nwedding night that goes horribly wrong, does qualify as \u201cart on\na sexual theme related specifically to emotions\u201d and yet it\nwould be misleading to label it as erotic literature.\n\nInstead of claiming that erotic art is about sexual feelings\nor desires, one could say that erotic art elicits sexual\nfeelings or desires. But this characterization would also be too\nbroad. A pious Madonna and Child painting may elicit sexual feelings\nor desires in some people, but that in and of itself does not make it\nerotic art. The intention to be sexually stimulating appears\ncrucial, as Jerrold Levinson acknowledges in his definition of erotic\nart as\n\n\nart which aims to engage viewers sexually through explicit sexual\ncontent, and that succeeds, to some extent, in doing so. (Levinson\n2006: 252)\n\n\nBut does erotic art need to be explicit? Take Nobuyoshi Araki\u2019s\nfamous close-up photograph of a woman\u2019s eye, sometimes entitled\nThe Look. The artist has tilted the\npicture 90 degrees to make it suggestive of female genitalia, thereby\nsoliciting sensuous feelings and associations in spectators. It is\nhighly erotic, though it has no explicit sexual content.\n\nA more adequate definition, and one that will be adhered to in this\narticle, is the following: erotic art is art that is made with the\nintention to stimulate its target audience sexually, and that succeeds\nto some extent in doing so. This raises the further question what\nsexual stimulation precisely entails. According to Guy Sircello (1979:\n119) it is the inducing of sexual feelings where the latter might be\n(1) feelings in our sexual parts, or (2) feelings in other erogenous\nparts\u2014typically generated by or generating feelings in sexual\nparts. However, a kick below the belt will give a man certain feelings\nin his sexual parts, but not of the sort that erotic art is supposed\nto bring about. So, an important qualification is needed. Sexual\nstimulation is probably best understood as the inducing of sexual\nfeelings, desires and imaginings, that would generally be regarded as\npleasant in themselves. Alternatively, one could adopt\nMatthew Kieran\u2019s nutshell definition of erotic art as art which\n\u201cessentially aims at eliciting sexual thoughts, feelings and\nassociations found to be arousing\u201d (2001: 32).\n",
