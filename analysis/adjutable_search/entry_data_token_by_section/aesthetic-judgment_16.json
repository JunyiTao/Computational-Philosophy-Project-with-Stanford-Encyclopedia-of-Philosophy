    "main_text": "The Notion of the Aesthetic || A Hierarchical Proposal\n4.3 A Hierarchical Proposal\n\nOne strategy is the following: begin with the account of what it is to\nbe a judgment of taste, or of beauty and ugliness, that was outlined\nin part 1, and then use that to elucidate a broader notion of an\naesthetic judgment. To recall, it was argued that Kant was right, with\nqualifications, to think that the crucial thing about the judgment of\ntaste is that it has what he calls \u201csubjective\nuniversality\u201d; judgments of taste are those that are (a) based\non responses of pleasure or displeasure, and (b) claim universal\nvalidity, where that can be minimally interpreted as a normative\naspiration. The present strategy is to use this Kantian account in\norder to ground a wider category of the aesthetic, which includes\njudgments of taste along with judgments of daintiness, dumpiness,\ndelicacy, elegance, and the rest.\n\nLet us call judgments of taste, or judgments of beauty and ugliness,\n\u201cverdictive aesthetic judgments\u201d, and let us call the\nother aesthetic judgments (of daintiness, dumpiness, elegance,\ndelicacy, etc.) \u201csubstantive aesthetic judgments\u201d. The\nidea is that these substantive judgments are aesthetic in virtue of\nsome special close relation to verdictive judgments of taste, which\nare subjectively universal. We can assume that judgments of beauty and\nugliness coincide with judgments of aesthetic merit and demerit.\nHowever, even if beauty were taken to be a substantive aesthetic\nnotion, like elegance, delicacy or daintiness, there would remain some\nother overarching notion of aesthetic merit or excellence, and we\ncould take that notion as central.\n\nOn this approach, judgments of daintiness, dumpiness, delicacy and\nelegance stand in some special and intimate relation to judgments of\nbeauty and ugliness (or aesthetic merit and demerit), and it is only\nin virtue of this intimate relation that we can think of all these\njudgments as belonging to the same category. This is a hierarchical\nrather than an egalitarian conception of aesthetic notions\n\nNow, what exactly is this special intimate relation between verdictive\nand substantive aesthetic judgments? One suggestion is this: first,\nsubstantive judgments describe ways of being beautiful or\nugly (Burton 1992, Zangwill 1995). It is part of what it\nis for a thing to be elegant, delicate or dainty that it is\nbeautiful in a particular way. And second, it is part of the\nmeaning of substantive aesthetic judgments that they imply\nverdictive aesthetic judgments. This is the hierarchical proposal.\n\nRemark: this claim need not be one about all words like\n\u201cdainty\u201d and \u201cdelicate\u201d, but it is about the\nparticular substantive judgments that we linguistically\nexpress in such words on particular occasions. Both Beardsley and\nSibley seem to have made the mistake of casting these issues at the\nlinguistic level rather than at the level of thought; they focused not\non aesthetic words instead of aesthetic judgments and responses.\nSibley did say in footnote 1 of Sibley 1959 that he was concerned with\n\u201cuses\u201d of aesthetic words, but he and everyone else\nignored that qualification.\n\nLet us now see how this hierarchical proposal works. Consider an\nabstract pattern of curving lines, which is elegant. It might be\nnecessary that that pattern is beautiful. This is because the\nbeauty depends on or is determined by that specific\npattern. But it is not part of what it is to be that pattern\nthat it is beautiful. That is, the pattern is necessarily beautiful\nbut it is not essentially beautiful. (On the general distinction\nbetween necessity and essence, see Fine 1994.) Furthermore, we can\nthink of that pattern without thinking of it as beautiful.\n\nBy contrast, it is both necessary and essential that\nsomething that is elegant is beautiful. And this is reflected in our\nconcepts and judgments. We can think of the pattern without thereby\nthinking of it as beautiful, but to think of the pattern as elegant is\nto think of it as beautiful, at least in certain respects. Hence\nelegance is an aesthetic concept.\n\nThe hierarchical proposal thus seems to characterize a non-arbitrary\nand useful notion of the aesthetic. If so, the contemporary broad\nnotion of the aesthetic can be vindicated.\n\nTo see how this works, consider representational properties. Are they\naesthetic properties? Suppose that a painting represents a tree and is\na beautiful representation of a tree. It is not merely beautiful\nand a tree representation but beautiful as a tree\nrepresentation (Zangwill 1999). Of course, that the painting\nrepresents a tree is \u201crelevant\u201d to whether it is beautiful\nbecause it is part of what its beauty depends on. But being beautiful\nis not part of what it is to be a representation of a tree or even\nthat representation of a tree. Moreover, to think that the painting\nrepresents a tree is not thereby to think that it is beautiful. Being\nbeautiful is not an essential property of the representation, and\nthinking of the representation does not mean thinking of it as\nbeautiful, even though it may be necessary that it is beautiful. Hence\nrepresentational properties are not aesthetic properties.\n\nThe proposal faces a challenge, however. Jerrold Levinson has argued\nthat not all substantive properties have evaluative valence (Levinson\n2001). One of his examples is of \u201cstarkly grim\u201d. Being\nstarkly grim seems not always to be a way of being beautiful or ugly.\nThe defender of hierarchy could reply that it is specific uses of\nthese words, in context, that pick out features that have evaluative\nvalences. If so, the particular instance of stark grimness might be a\nvaluable aspect of a thing however it is with other instances of stark\ngrimness. But it might be replied that particular instances of stark\ngrimness may be value-neutral? The issue is a difficult one, and I\nleave the issue here.\n\nIf the hierarchical suggestion fails, then we lack one way of\nvindicating the modern broad notion of the aesthetic. Maybe there are\nother ways to give unity to the notion of the aesthetic. However, it\nis not clear that there is another feasible way in the literature.\nLevinson thinks of aesthetic properties as a certain kind of\nappearance properties. We might note that this will immediately rule\nout the aesthetic properties of abstract objects by fiat. More\nimportantly, there remains the question of what kind of appearance\nproperties aesthetic properties are. Even if we are happy with\nindefinite boundaries of the aesthetic, we need some sense of what the\nsub-class is, and its relation to pleasure and beauty. (We might\ncompare the difficulties in characterizing a notion of the aesthetic\nwith the difficulties characterizing a notion of logic.)\n",
