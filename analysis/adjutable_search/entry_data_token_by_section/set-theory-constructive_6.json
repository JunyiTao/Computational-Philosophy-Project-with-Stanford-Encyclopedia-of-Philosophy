    "main_text": "Constructive Choice Principles\n4. Constructive Choice Principles\n\n\nWhen discussing the role of classical set theory as a foundation for\nmathematics, one usually considers the theory ZFC, that is, the axiom\nsystem ZF plus the axiom of choice (AC). One might therefore wonder\nwhat is the status of the axiom of choice in intuitionistic\nsettings. The question is particularly significant because at its\nfirst appearance the axiom of choice was often seen as controversial\nand highly non-constructive. In constructive contexts, however, one\nwitnesses a peculiar phenomenon. The usual form of the axiom of choice\nis validated by theories of types such as Martin-L\u00f6f type theory,\nwhere the Curry-Howard correspondence holds\n(See Section 3.4\n of the entry on\n Constructive mathematics). \nOn the other hand, the assumption of the axiom of\nchoice gives rise to instances of the excluded middle\nin extensional contexts, where a form of separation is also\navailable. This is the case, for example, of constructive and\nintuitionistic ZF. (For the proof, see the supplementary document\non Set-theoretic Principles Incompatible with Intuitionistic Logic.) \nA proof of the\nincompatibility of AC with extensional set theories based on\nintuitionistic logic seems to have first appeared in (Diaconescu 1975)\nin a categorical context. Goodman and Myhill give an argument for set\ntheories based on intuitionistic logic (Goodman and Myhill 1978). \n\n\nAlthough the axiom of choice is incompatible with both constructive\nand intuitionistic ZF, other choice principles may be added to the\nbasic systems without producing the same undesirable results. For\nexample one could add the principle of countable choice\n(AC\\(_0)\\) or that of dependent choice (DC). In fact, \nboth have been often\nemployed in the constructive mathematical practice. \n(For their exact formulation see the supplementary document on \nAxioms of CZF and IZF.)\n\nIn (Aczel 1978) the author also considered a choice principle called the Presentation\nAxiom, which asserts that every set is the\nsurjective image of a so-called base. A base is a set,\nsay \\(B\\), such that every relation with domain \\(B\\)\nextends a function with domain \\(B\\).\n\nThe compatibility of all these forms of choice with constructive set\ntheory has been proved by Aczel by extending his\ninterpretation of CZF in Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (Aczel\n1982). Rathjen (2006) has also considered various constructive choice\nprinciples and their mutual relations.\n\n\nA final remark: although constructive and intuitionistic set theories\nare compatible with the principles of choice just mentioned, the set\ntheories are often defined without any choice principles. This has\nthe aim of allowing for a \u201cpluralistic\u201d foundational\napproach. In particular, one would like to obtain a foundational\ntheory compatible with those contexts (e.g. categorical models\nof set theory) in which even these weaker principles of choice may not be\nvalidated. For similar ideas in the context of constructive type\ntheory, see (Maietti and Sambin 2005, Maietti 2009). We wish also to mention here\nRichman\u2019s appeal for a constructive mathematics which makes no\nuse of choice principles (Richman 2000; 2001).\n",
