    "main_text": "\n\n\nA visionary thinker and prolific author, Moses Maimonides\n(1135/8-1204) writes on topics ranging from physics to Jewish Law,\ntheology to politics, psychology to Biblical exegesis, and from\nphilosophy to medicine. Rich and complex in their own right,\nMaimonides' writings must, however, be understood within their\n12th-13th century Islamicate context, revealing, as they do, the\nimprint of earlier Greek and Islamic philosophical traditions. In this\nentry, we will uncover some of the Islamic philosophical and\ntheological underpinnings of Maimonides' work with a focus on\nthe Theology of Aristotle, and the writings of al-Farabi\n(ca. 870-950), Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037), al-Ghazali (1058-1111),\nand Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198).\n\n\nA few preliminary caveats and reminders:\n\n\n(a) It is not possible to cover every aspect of Maimonides' Islamic\nphilosophical heritage (even if we restrict ourselves to the\naforementioned text traditions) in a format of this sort; one might\ncertainly speak of other Islamic writers whose works arguably\ninfluenced Maimonides. To best do justice to this topic, I will\nproceed in what follows by selecting instructive and representative\nbits of primary text from Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed\n(henceforth, Guide), and comparing them with ideas from the\naforementioned texts. In this way, readers will be helped to see a\nselection of continuities in philosophical tradition between five\nimportant Islamic text traditions and Maimonides. By proceeding in\nthis way, I additionally hope to have supplied readers with\nappropriate Arabic philosophical resource materials for further\nstudy. It might be noted too that given my current goal of\nfacilitating as much active engagement on the part of as wide a range\nof readers as possible, I have limited the cited Arabic texts in this\nstudy to those that are currently available in English\ntranslation.\n\n\n(b) While I end with a selected bibliography of secondary readings,\nreaders ought to be aware in particular of Shlomo Pines' \u201cTranslator's\nIntroduction\u201d to his English translation of the Guide, a well-known\nand commonly cited essay in which he addresses the Greek and Islamic\nsources at play in Maimonides'\n thought.[1]\n While a classic resource, Pines\u2019 essay is\nsubject to scholarly debate (e.g. as we will see below, pace Pines,\nmore scholars are finding the direct influence of Averroes and\nal-Ghazali in Maimonides\u2019 Guide).\n\n\n(c) Finally, it ought also be noted in way of introduction that\nMaimonides' philosophy is, as we will see, deeply imbued with\nNeoplatonic metaphysical notions such as \u201cemanation\u201d (or \u201coverflow\u201d)\nand divine transcendence. While I will talk about these notions and\ntheir occurrence in Maimonides and in his Islamic philosophical\ncontext, and while I will try to give a basic sense of how these ideas\nwork, any attempt to fully explain these Plotinian metaphysical ideas\nfalls outside the scope of the current entry. In this respect, readers\nare invited to consult primary and secondary sources on Plotinus and\nNeoplatonic metaphysics in Greek, Jewish, and Islamic sources. \n",
