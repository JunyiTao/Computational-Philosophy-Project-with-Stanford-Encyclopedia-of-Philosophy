    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics || Bildung\n4.2 Bildung\n\nBildung is another characteristic romantic value that each\nindividual should develop in herself. While literally meaning\n\u201cformation\u201d, Bildung is best understood as a mode\nof ethical and cultural cultivation, or self-realization that allows\nthe individual to mature into independence and responsibility.\n\u201cConcerning Bildung, we speak not of external culture,\nbut the development of independence\u201d (F. Schlegel, TPL\nII: 148). Bildung is a particularly modern value,\nformed at least in part as a challenge to what the romantics regarded\nas the rift between sensibility and reason in modern life. To achieve\nBildung, each individual has to constitute herself as a\nunified whole that coordinates a balance between sensibility and\nreason: \u201cThe end of humanity is\u2026to achieve harmony in\nknowing, doing and enjoying\u201d (F. Schlegel, On the Study of\nGreek Poetry, in KA I, 627).\n\nThe artwork is a good model for such an ideal insofar as it is,\naccording to the romantics, an organic and harmonious whole of diverse\nand even conflicting parts:\n\n\nPoetry\u2026must be a harmonious mood of our mind\u2026where\neverything finds its proper aspect\u2026. Everything in a truly\npoetic book seems so natural\u2014and yet so marvelous. We\nthink it could not be otherwise\u2026and we feel the\ninfinite\u2026sensations of a plurality in agreement. (Novalis, Last\nFragments: #3)\n\n\nThis is why \u201cEvery human being who is cultivated and who\ncultivates himself\u201d, namely, the person who achieves\nBildung, \u201ccontains a novel within himself\u201d (F.\nSchlegel, AF: #78).\n\nAesthetic judgment is also a harmony of reason and sensibility. On\nthis issue too, the romantics were inspired by Kant\u2019s\naesthetics, according to which aesthetic judgment consists in the free\nplay between the understanding, imagination and pleasure. Approaching\nthe world, ourselves and one another aesthetically, then, is\napproaching it with a harmony of \u201cknowing, doing, and\nenjoying\u201d. And achieving this harmony constitutes a genuine\nmoral being: a balanced rational, sensible and affective person. For\nthat reason, it is not surprising to find Coleridge, the critic,\naiming to establish \u201cthe close and reciprocal connections of\nJust Taste with pure Morality\u201d (Lecture I, CLL).\n\nRomantic Bildung was a political ideal as much as it was an\nethical one. It was needed, not only for the sake of independent\nindividual responsibility, but also for the possibility of a genuine\nnon-revolutionary republic:\n\n\nThere is no greater need of the age than the need for a spiritual\ncounterweight to the Revolution and to the despotism which the\nRevolution exercises over people\u2026. Where can we seek and find\nsuch a counterweight? The answer isn\u2019t hard: unquestionably in\nourselves\u2026the center of humanity lies there. (F. Schlegel,\nIdeas: #41)\n\n\nThe French revolution had shown the romantics both the value of a\nrepublic based on liberty, equality and fraternity, but also the\ndangers of anarchism and strife that revolutions carry with them. The\nproper path to a republic, they thought, is not through a\nrevolutionary act, but through proper education. Art does not only\noffer a model for a harmonious, cultivated soul, but is also the best\nmedium through which to achieve the moral education that\nleads to this harmony and, on its basis, to the best republic.\nAttending to art (as well as producing it) is a form of\nself-cultivation because the spirit of art allows human beings to\ntranscend baseness (a particular danger given modern instrumentalism\nand materialism), and to develop their humanity. \n\nAs we now turn to see, the romantics regarded art also as a\nparticularly effective medium for uniting people, no matter their\ndifferences, and so took it to be a great spur for united, social and\npolitical action.\n",
