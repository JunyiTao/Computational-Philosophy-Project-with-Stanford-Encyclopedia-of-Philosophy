    "main_text": "Individualism and Anti-Individualism || Anti-Individualism\n4.2 Anti-Individualism\n\nContrasting the Good and Bad cases\nhas motivated some Testimonial Reliabilists to endorse one version of\nAnti-Individualism. The core idea here is that insofar as testimonial\njustification should be understood in terms of the cognitive processes\nimplicated in the production of the hearer\u2019s belief that\np, the relevant processes must include both (a) the processes\ninvolved in the production of the speaker\u2019s testimony and (b)\nthe processes involved in the hearer\u2019s consumption of what the\nspeaker said. For instance, the cognitive processes internal to Wilma\nwere the highly reliable in both Good and\nBad, e.g., in both cases she was equally good at\nmonitoring for signs that Barney was being insincere. However, the\nprocesses internal to Barney that were implicated in his utterance\nthat p were reliable in Good (i.e., Barney\nspoke from knowledge) but unreliable in Bad (i.e.,\nBarney uttered that p in an attempt to be deceptive). Thus, by\ngiving an account of testimonial justification that requires both the\nspeaker and hearer to be reliable producers and consumers of testimony\nrespectively, Testimonial Reliabilists who endorse this\nAnti-Individualistic approach can explain why Wilma\u2019s belief\nseems better off in Good than it is in\nBad. (Goldberg [2010a] defends Anti-Individualism on\nthese grounds, and Graham (2000b) and Lackey (2008) also defend\nAnti-Individualistic views by requiring that in order for a hearer to\nacquire testimonial justification, not only does the hearer need to be\na reliable consumer of testimony, the speaker needs to be a reliable\ntestifier as well. Finally, Kallestrup and Pritchard (2012), Gerken\n(2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos (forthcoming) have recently\ndefended versions of Anti-Individualism according to which the\ntestifiers in the hearer\u2019s local environment need to be reliable\nin order for the hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge from the\nparticular speaker in question).\n\nTo see a second and importantly different version of\nAnti-Individualism, recall the Inheritance View from\n Section 3.1.2.\n On this view, when a hearer acquires testimonial justification for\nbelieving p, this is because they literally inherit the\njustification that the speaker has for believing p. Thus,\nproponents of the Inheritance View are Anti-Individualists in the\nfollowing sense: they maintain that whether or not a hearer acquires\ntestimonial justification for believing p crucially depends on\nfeatures having to do with the speaker, i.e., whether the speaker has\nany justification for the hearer to inherit.\n\nWhether or not either of these Anti-Individualistic approaches will\nultimately succeed is a topic of current debate.\n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that while we have been focusing\non testimonial justification, similar debates between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists can be had about testimonial\nknowledge. While many epistemologists endorse Individualism\n(Anti-Individualism) about both justification and knowledge, one need\nnot do so. For instance, Audi (1997) endorses Reductionism about\njustification and the Transmission View about knowledge. On this\npicture, then, Individualism is true with respect to justification\nbecause whether or not a hearer acquires testimonial justification\ndepends solely on the inferences that they make. However,\nAnti-Individualism is true with respect to knowledge because in order\nfor a hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge that p, the\nspeaker must also know that p. Keeping these distinctions in\nmind further illustrates how the debate between Individualists and\nAnti-Individualists cuts across so many of the other debates we have\nseen above.\n",
