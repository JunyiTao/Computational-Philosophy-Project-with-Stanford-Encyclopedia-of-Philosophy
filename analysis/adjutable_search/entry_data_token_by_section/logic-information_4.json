Information as Correlation: Situation Theory\n\nThe correlational take on information looks at how the existence of\nsystematic connections between the parts of a structured\ninformation environment permits that one part may carry\ninformation about another. For example: the pattern of pixels\nthat appear on the screen of a computer gives information (not\nnecessarily complete) about the sequence of keys that were\npressed by the person who is typing a document, and even a partial\nsnapshot of the clear starred sky your friend is looking at now will\ngive you information about his possible locations on Earth at\nthis moment. The focus on structured environments and the aboutness of\ninformation goes hand in hand with a third main topic of the\ninformation-as correlation approach, namely the situatedness of\ninformation, that is, its dependence on the particular setting on\nwhich an informational signal occurs. Take the starry sky as an\nexample again: the same pattern of stars, at different moments in time\nand locations in space will in general convey different information\nabout the location of your friend.\n\nHistorically, the first paradigmatic setting of correlated information\nwas Shannon\u2019s work on communication (1948), which we already\nmentioned in the last section. Shannon considered a communication\nsystem formed by two information sites, a source and a receiver,\nconnected via a noisy channel. He gave conclusive and extremely useful\nanswers to questions having to do with the construction of\ncommunication codes that help maximising the effectiveness of\ncommunication (in terms of bits of information that can be\ntransmitted) while minimizing the possibility of errors caused by\nchannel noise. As we previously said, Shannon\u2019s concern was\npurely quantitative. The logical approach to information as\ncorrelation builds on Shannon\u2019s ideas, but is concerned with\nqualitative aspects of information flow, like the ones we highlighted\nbefore: what information about a\n\u2018remote\u2019 site (remote in terms of space, time,\nperspective, etc.) can be drawn out of information that is directly\navailable at a \u2018proximal\u2019 site?\n\nSituation theory (Barwise and Perry 1983; Devlin 1991) is the\nmajor logical framework so far that has made these ideas its starting\npoint for an analysis of information. Its origin and some of its\ncentral insights can be found in the project of naturalization of mind\nand the possibility of knowledge initiated by Fred Dretske (1981),\nwhich soon influenced the inception of situation semantics in the\ncontext of natural language (see Kratzer 2011).\n\nTechnically, there are two kinds of developments in situation\ntheory:\n\nSet-theoretic and model-theoretic frameworks based on detailed\nontologies, suitable for modelling informational phenomena in concrete\napplications.\nA mathematical theory of information flow as enabled by lawful\nchannels that connect parts of a whole. This theory takes a\nmore abstract view on information as correlation, which is applicable\n(in principle) to all sorts of systems that can be decomposed into\ninterrelated parts.\n\n\nThe next three subsections survey some of the basic notions from this\ntradition: the basic sites of information in situation theory (called\nsituations), the basic notion of information flow based on\ncorrelations between situations, and the mathematical theory of\nclassifications and channels mentioned in (b).\n",
