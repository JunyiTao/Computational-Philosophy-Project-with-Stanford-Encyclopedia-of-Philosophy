Some\ntake the lesson of the Manipulation Argument to be that no\ncompatibilist account of sourcehood or self-determination is\nsatisfactory. True sourcehood\u2014the kind of sourcehood that can\nactually ground an agent\u2019s freedom and\nresponsibility\u2014requires, so it is argued, that one\u2019s\naction not be causally determined by factors beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nLibertarians, while united in endorsing this negative condition on\nsourcehood, are deeply divided concerning which further positive\nconditions may be required. It is important to note that while\nlibertarians are united in insisting that compatibilist accounts of\nsourcehood are insufficient, they are not committed to thinking that\nthe conditions of freedom spelled out in terms either of\nreasons-responsiveness or of identification are not necessary. For\nexample, Stump (1988, 1996, 2010) builds a sophisticated libertarian\nmodel of free will out of resources originally developed within\nFrankfurt\u2019s identification model (see also Ekstrom 1993, 2000;\nFranklin 2014) and nearly all libertarians agree that exercises of\nfree will require agents to be reasons-responsive (e.g., Kane 1996; Clarke 2003, chs. 8\u20139; Franklin 2018, ch.\n2). Moreover, while this section focuses on libertarian accounts of\nsourcehood, we remind readers that most (if not all) libertarians\nthink that the freedom to do otherwise is also necessary for free will\nand moral responsibility.\n\nThere are three main libertarian options for understanding sourcehood\nor self-determination: non-causal libertarianism (Ginet 1990, 2008;\nMcCann 1998; Lowe 2008; Goetz 2009; Pink 2017; Palmer 2021),\nevent-causal libertarianism (Wiggins 1973; Kane 1996, 1999, 2011,\n2016; Mele 1995, chs. 11\u201312; 2006, chs. 4\u20135; 2017; Ekstrom\n2000, 2019; Clarke 2003, chs. 2\u20136; Franklin 2018), and\nagent-causal libertarianism (Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966, 1976;\nTaylor 1966; O\u2019Connor 2000; Clarke 1993; 1996;\n2003, chs. 8\u201310; Griffith 2010; Steward 2012). Non-causal\nlibertarians contend that exercises of the power of self-determination\nneed not (or perhaps even cannot) be caused or causally structured.\nAccording to this view, we control our volition or choice simply in\nvirtue of its being ours\u2014its occurring in us. We do not exert a\nspecial kind of causality in bringing it about; instead, it is an\nintrinsically active event, intrinsically something we do.\nWhile there may be causal influences upon our choice, there need not\nbe, and any such causal influence is wholly irrelevant to\nunderstanding why it occurs. Reasons provide an autonomous, non-causal\nform of explanation. Provided our choice is not wholly determined by\nprior factors, it is free and under our control simply in virtue of\nbeing ours. Non-causal views have failed to garner wide support among\nlibertarians since, for many, self-determination seems to be\nan essentially causal notion (cf. Mele 2000 and Clarke 2003, ch. 2). This dispute hinges on the necessary\nconditions on the concept of causal power, and relatedly on whether\npower simpliciter admits causal and non-causal variants. For\ndiscussion, see O\u2019Connor (2021).\n\nMost libertarians endorse an event-causal or agent-causal account of\nsourcehood. Both these accounts maintain that exercises of the power\nof self-determination consist partly in the agent\u2019s bringing\nabout her choice or action, but they disagree on how to analyze an\nagent\u2019s bringing about her choice. While event-causal\nlibertarianism admits of different species, at the heart of this view\nis the idea that self-determining an action requires, at minimum, that\nthe agent cause the action and that an agent\u2019s causing his\naction is wholly reducible to mental states and other events\ninvolving the agent nondeviantly causing his action. Consider an\nagent\u2019s raising his hand. According to the event-causal model at\nits most basic level, an agent\u2019s raising his hand consists in\nthe agent\u2019s causing his hand to rise and his causing his hand to\nrise consists in apt mental states and events involving the\nagent\u2014such as the agent\u2019s desire to ask a question and his\nbelief that he can ask a question by raising his\nhand\u2014nondeviantly causing his hand to rise. (The\nnondeviance clause is required since it seems possible that an event\nbe brought about by one\u2019s desires and beliefs and yet not be\nself-determined, or even an action for that matter, due to the unusual\ncausal path leading from the desires and beliefs to action. Imagine a\nwould-be accomplice of an assassin believes that his dropping his\ncigarette is the signal for the assassin to shoot his intended victim\nand he desires to drop his cigarette and yet this belief and desire so\nunnerve him that he accidentally drops his cigarette. While the event\nof dropping the cigarette is caused by a relevant desire and belief it\ndoes not seem to be self-determined and perhaps is not even an action\n[cf. Davidson 1973].) To fully spell out this account, event-causal\nlibertarians must specify which mental states and events are apt (cf.\nBrand 1979)\u2014which mental states and events are the springs of\nself-determined actions\u2014and what nondeviance consists in (cf.\nBishop 1989). (We note that this has proven very difficult, enough so\nthat some take the problem to spell doom for event-causal theories of\naction. Such philosophers [e.g., Taylor 1966 and Sehon 2005] take\nagential power to be conceptually and/or ontologically primitive and\nunderstand reasons explanations of action in irreducibly teleological\nterms. See Stout 2010 for a brisk survey of discussions of this\ntopic.) For ease, in what follows we will assume that apt mental\nstates are an agent\u2019s reasons that favor the action.\n\nEvent-causal libertarians, of course, contend that self-determination\nrequires more than nondeviant causation by agents\u2019 reasons: for\nit is possible that agents\u2019 actions in deterministic worlds are\nnondeviantly caused by apt mental states and events.\nSelf-determination requires nondeterministic causation, in a\nnondeviant way, by an agent\u2019s reasons. While historically many\nhave thought that nondeterministic causation is impossible (Hobbes\n1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Hume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]), with the\nadvent of quantum physics and, from a very different direction, an\ninfluential essay by G.E.M. Anscombe (1971), it is now widely\nassumed that nondeterministic (or probabilistic) causation is\npossible. There are two importantly different ways to understand\nnondeterministic causation: as the causation of probability or as the\nprobability of causation. Under\nthe causation of probability model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\)\ncauses (or causally contributes to) the objective probability of the\noutcome\u2019s occurring rather than the outcome itself. On this\naccount, \\(S\\)\u2019s reasons do not cause his decision but there\nbeing a certain antecedent objective probability of its occurring, and\nthe decision itself is uncaused. On the competing probability of\ncausation model, a nondeterministic cause \\(C\\) causes the outcome of\na nondeterministic process. Given that \\(C\\) is a nondeterministic\ncause of the outcome, it was possible given the exact same past and\nlaws of nature that \\(C\\) not cause the outcome (perhaps because it\nwas possible that some other event cause some other outcome)\u2014the\nprobability of this causal transaction\u2019s occurring was less than\n\\(1\\). Given that event-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determined actions, and thus free actions, must be caused, they\nare committed to the probability of causation model of\nnondeterministic causation (cf. Franklin 2018, 25\u201326). (We note\nthat Balaguer [2010] is skeptical of the above distinction, and it is\nthus unclear whether he should best be classified as a non-causal or\nevent-causal libertarian, though see Balaguer [2014] for evidence that\nit is best to treat him as a non-causalist.) Consequently, according\nto event-causal libertarians, when an agent \\(S\\) self-determines his\nchoice \\(\\phi\\), then \\(S\\)\u2019s reasons \\(r_1\\)\nnondeterministically cause (in a nondeviant way) \\(\\phi\\), and it was\npossible, given the past and laws, that \\(r_1\\) not have caused\n\\(\\phi\\), but rather some of \\(S\\)\u2019s other reasons \\(r_2\\)\nnondeterministically caused (in a nondeviant way) a different action\n\\(\\psi\\).\n\nAgent-causal libertarians contend that the event-causal picture fails\nto capture self-determination, for it fails to accord the agent with a\npower to settle what she does. Pereboom offers a forceful\nstatement of this worry:\n\n\nOn an event-causal libertarian picture, the relevant causal conditions\nantecedent to the decision, i.e., the occurrence of certain\nagent-involving events, do not settle whether the decision will occur,\nbut only render the occurrence of the decision about \\(50\\%\\)\nprobable. In fact, because no occurrence of antecedent events settles\nwhether the decision will occur, and only antecedent events are\ncausally relevant, nothing settles whether the decision will\noccur. (Pereboom 2014, 32; cf. Watson 1987, 1996; Clarke 2003 [ch. 8], 2011; Griffith 2010; Shabo 2011, 2013;\nSteward 2012 [ch. 3]; and Schlosser 2014); and for critical\nassessment, see Clarke 2019.\n\n\nOn the event-causal picture, the agent\u2019s causal contribution to\nher actions is exhausted by the causal contribution of her reasons,\nand yet her reasons leave open which decisions she will make, and this\nseems insufficient for self-determination.\n\nBut what more must be added? Agent-causal libertarians maintain that\nself-determination requires that the agent herself play a\ncausal role over and above the causal role played by her reasons. Some\nagent-causal libertarians deny that an agent\u2019s reasons play any\ndirect causal role in bringing about an agent\u2019s self-determined\nactions (Chisholm 1966; O\u2019Connor 2000, ch. 5), whereas\nothers allow or even require that self-determined actions be caused in\npart by the agent\u2019s reasons (Clarke 2003, ch. 9; Steward 2012,\nch. 3). But all agent-causal libertarians insist that exercises of the\npower of self-determination do not reduce to nondeterministic\ncausation by apt mental states: agent-causation does not reduce to\nevent-causation.\n\nAgent-causal libertarianism seems to capture an aspect of\nself-determination that neither the above compatibilists accounts nor\nevent-causal libertarian accounts capture. (Some compatibilists even\naccept this and try to incorporate agent-causation into a\ncompatibilist understanding of free will. See Markosian 1999, 2012;\nNelkin 2011.) These accounts reduce the causal role of the self to\nstates and events to which the agent is not identical (even if he is\nidentified with them). But how can self-determination of my\nactions wholly reduce to determination of my actions by things\nother than the self? Richard Taylor nicely expresses this\nintuition: \u201cIf I believe that something not identical to myself\nwas the cause of my behavior\u2014some event wholly external to\nmyself, for instance, or even one internal to myself, such as a nerve\nimpulse, volition, or whatnot\u2014then I cannot regard the behavior\nas being an act of mine, unless I further believed that I was the\ncause of that external or internal event\u201d (1974, 55; cf.\nFranklin 2016).\n\nDespite its powerful intuitive pull for some, many have argued that\nagent-causal libertarianism is obscure or even incoherent. The stock\nobjection used to be that the very idea of\nagent-causation\u2014causation by agents that is not reducible to\ncausation by mental states and events involving the agent\u2014is\nincoherent, but this objection has become less common due to\npioneering work by Chisholm (1966, 1976), Taylor (1974),\nO\u2019Connor (2000, 2011), Clarke (2003), and Steward 2012, ch. 8). More common objections now concern, first, how to understand the\nrelationship between agent-causation and an agent\u2019s reasons (or\nmotivations in general), and, second, the empirical adequacy of\nagent-causal libertarianism. With respect to the first worry, it is\nwidely assumed that the only (or at least best) way to understand\nreasons-explanation and motivational influence is within a causal\naccount of reasons, where reasons cause our actions (Davidson 1963;\nMele 1992). If agent-causal libertarians accept that self-determined\nactions, in addition to being agent-caused, must also be caused by\nagents\u2019 reasons that favored those actions, then agent-causal\nlibertarians need to explain how to integrate these causes (for a\ndetailed attempt to do just this, see Clarke 2003, ch. 8). Given that\nthese two causes seem distinct, is it not possible that the agent\ncause his decision to \\(\\phi\\) and yet the agent\u2019s reasons\nsimultaneously cause an incompatible decision to \\(\\psi\\)? If\nagent-causal libertarians side-step this difficult question by denying\nthat reasons cause action, then they must explain how reasons can\nexplain and motivate action without causing it; and this has turned\nout to be no easy task. (For more general attempts to\nunderstand reasons-explanation and motivation within a non-causal\nframework see Schueler 1995, 2003; Sehon 2005). For further discussion\nsee the entry on\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will.\n\nFinally, we note that some recent philosophers have questioned the\npresumed difference between event- and agent-causation by arguing that\nall causation is object or substance causation. They argue\nthat the dominant tendency to understand \u2018garden variety\u2019\ncausal transactions in the world as relations between events is an\nunfortunate legacy of David Hume\u2019s rejection of substance and\ncausation as basic metaphysical categories. On the competing\nmetaphysical picture of the world, the event or state of an\nobject\u2019s having some property such as mass is its having a\ncausal power, which in suitable circumstances it exercises to bring\nabout a characteristic effect. Applied to human agents in an account\nof free will, the account suggests a picture on which an agent\u2019s\nhaving desires, beliefs, and intentions are rational powers to will\nparticular courses of action, and where the agent\u2019s willing is\nnot determined in any one direction, she wills freely. An advantage\nfor the agent-causalist who embraces this broader metaphysics is\n\u2018ideological\u2019 parsimony. For different developments and\ndefenses of this approach, see Lowe (2008), Swinburne (2013), and O\u2019Connor (2021); and for reason\nto doubt that a substance-causal metaphysics helps to allay skepticism\nconcerning free will, see Clarke and Reed (2015).\n",
