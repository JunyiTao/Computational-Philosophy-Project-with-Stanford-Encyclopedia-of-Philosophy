Extended typelogical grammars\nThe strategy of combining resource-sensitivity at the level of\nderivational semantics with non-linear lexical meaning assignments is\nnot a general solution for the expressive limitations of the syntactic\ncalculi originally conceived by Lambek. A type of problem that\nnecessitates extensions of the derivational machinery itself has to do\nwith the inability of (N)L to\nestablish discontinuous dependencies between grammatical\nresources in a satisfactory way.  Such dependencies manifest\nthemselves in two situations.\nExtraction.  These are phenomena which generative grammar\nrefers to as \u2018overt displacement\u2019, as we find it\nin wh \u2018movement\u2019 constructions.  Compare\nthe wh phrases \u2018what \u2014 annoys Mary\u2019 versus\n\u2018what Mary put \u2014 there\u2019, as they would occur in a\ncontext \u2018I know what annoys Mary\u2019 or \u2018I know what\nMary put there\u2019.  The dash marks the spot where a noun phrase\nwould fit in a normal declarative sentence: \u2018this record annoys\nMary\u2019, \u2018Mary put the record there\u2019.  Assigning the\ntype wh/(np\\s) to \u2018what\u2019, we\ncan derive wh for the first example, with a np\nhypothesis in the left-peripheral subject position.  If this\nhypothesis (the \u2018gap\u2019) occurs internally, as in\nthe second example, it is unreachable for (N)L: one\ncannot derive np\\s for \u2018Mary \u2014 put\nthere\u2019 (nor s/np, for that matter, which would\nrequire a right-peripheral gap).\nInfixation. Typical examples would be cases of non-local\nsemantic construal, as in \u2018Alice knows someone is\ncheating\u2019, with a wide-scope reading for \u2018someone\u2019:\n\u2018there is a particular person x such that Alice\nthinks x is cheating\u2019. The quantifier phrase\n\u2018someone\u2019 occupies the structural position where in fact\nthe np-type hypothesis is needed, and realizes its semantic\neffect at some higher sentential level. With a type-assignment\ns/(np\\s) for \u2018someone\u2019, there\nis no derivation producing the non-local reading. In generative\ngrammar, one would call the non-local construal an instance of\n\u2018covert\u2019 movement.\nThe extensions of the basic calculus\nto be discussed in the sections below represent the strategies that\nare being pursued to find principled solutions to these problems of\ndiscontinuous dependencies.\n",
