The Modal Characterization of the Essential/Accidental Property Distinction\n\nAccording to the basic modal characterization of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties, which is the\ncharacterization given at the outset,\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\), whereas\n\\(P\\) is an accidental property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) but it is possible that\n\\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nPutting this into the language of possible worlds that\nphilosophers often adopt,\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) in all possible worlds, whereas\n\\(P\\) is an accidental property of an object \\(o\\) just in\ncase \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) but there is a possible world in which\n\\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nAlthough the basic idea behind the modal characterization is clear\nenough from these statements, a moment\u2019s reflection reveals a\nlittle bit of trouble. Many properties (some philosophers would say\nall properties) are such that in order for an object to\npossess them, that object must exist. According to the basic modal\ncharacterization, any such property, if possessed by a contingently\nexisting object, will be counted as an accidental property of\nthat object. But this seems wrong. Consider the property of being a\ndog. It is plausible (and for present purposes we assume it is true)\nthat an object must exist in order to possess this property. Now\nconsider a particular dog named \u2018Emma\u2019, who in fact exists\nbut who might not have existed. There is a possible world in which\nEmma does not exist. And in this world (given our assumption) Emma is\nnot a dog, since Emma does not exist there. So, according to the basic\nmodal characterization, being a dog is an accidental property\nof Emma. But however we characterize the distinction between essential\nand accidental properties, the characterization should not by itself\nrule out the intuitively compelling claim that Emma is\nessentially a dog. So the basic modal characterization seems\nflawed.\n\nIn response to this point, it is tempting to turn to a variant of the\nbasic modal characterization, the existence-conditioned modal\ncharacterization, according to which\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) and it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) if\n\\(o\\) exists, whereas \\(P\\) is an accidental\nproperty of an object \\(o\\) just in case \\(o\\) has\n\\(P\\) but it is possible that \\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\) and yet\nexists.\n\n\nBut this formulation too is less than satisfactory. A widely noted\nproblem for this way of drawing the distinction is that it makes\nexistence into an essential property of each object, since no object\ncould lack existence and yet exist. Thus, this characterization of the\nessential/accidental property distinction effectively rules out a\ntheist\u2019s claim that only God has existence as an essential\nproperty. But a good characterization of the distinction should not\nrule on a substantive matter in this way.\n\nArguably neither of these problems is devastating. Those who favor the\nbasic characterization can say that typically when someone claims, for\nexample, that Emma is essentially a dog, what is really meant is not\nthat Emma has essentially the property of being a dog, but\ninstead that Emma has essentially the property of being a dog if\nexistent. Existence will be treated specially on this approach:\nthe claim that an object has existence as an essential property will\nnot be taken as the claim that the object has as an essential property\nthe property of being existent if existent; instead the claim\nwill be taken at face value. Those who favor the existence-conditioned\ncharacterization can say that when someone says that only God has\nexistence as an essential property, what is really meant is that only\nGod has existence as a necessary property, where a necessary\nproperty of an object is a property that the object possesses in all\npossible worlds. (According to the basic modal characterization, an\nessential property is the same as a necessary property.) Both\napproaches may be faulted for making a special case of the property of\nexistence. But that is not perhaps such a great fault, given that\nexistence does seem to be a special case and that it is treated\nspecially in other areas of philosophy as well. (It is perhaps worth\npointing out that according to many philosophers\u2014Kant, Russell,\nand Frege to name three\u2014existence is not a property at all. If\nthis is right, then existence is indeed a very special case.) In what\nfollows, we shall not be concerned with the details arising from the\nneed for some sort of existence condition\u2014either in the\nstatement of the definition of an essential property (as on the\nexistence-conditioned modal characterization) or in the properties\nthat are taken to be essential (as on the basic modal\ncharacterization). There are other ways of explaining the distinction\nbetween essential and accidental properties of objects in modal terms\n(to be discussed in \u00a72), but what we have called the basic\nmodal characterization and the existence-conditioned modal\ncharacterization are the standard ways. Together, usually\nindiscriminately, these amount to what we call the modal\ncharacterization.\n\nThe central notion involved in any modal characterization of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties is that of\nmetaphysical necessity/possibility. But, since there are a\nnumber of notions that correspond to the many ways that we use the\nwords \u2018necessity\u2019 and \u2018possibility\u2019, it is\nhelpful to contrast the relevant notion of necessity/possibility with\nsome other notions with which it might be confused.\n\nIf one claims that something is possible, it is sometimes natural to\ntake this to mean that one does not know it to be false. For example,\nsuppose that you ask someone whether Socrates ever went to Sparta and\nshe answers that it is possible. It is natural to understand her as\nsaying that she does not know that Socrates did not go to Sparta.\nThus, the possibility that is expressed here is a kind of\nepistemic possibility (in particular, one according to which\n\\(p\\) is epistemically possible for an agent \\(X\\) just in\ncase not-\\(p\\) is not known by \\(X)\\). This notion of\nepistemic possibility is clearly distinct from the notion of\nmetaphysical possibility, since there are cases of epistemic\npossibilities that are not metaphysical possibilities. Of\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture (that every even number greater than two\nis the sum of two primes) and its denial, each is epistemically\npossible but one (we know not which) is not metaphysically possible.\nAnd there are cases of metaphysical possibilities that are not\nepistemic possibilities. That there are only two planets in our solar\nsystem is metaphysically possible but not epistemically possible for\nmost of us, given that most of us know that there are not only two\nplanets in our solar system. (This is not to deny that there may be\nsome notions of epistemic possibility\u2014for example, maximally\ncomplete ways the universe can coherently be conceived to\nbe\u2014for which it is at least plausible to suppose that every\nmetaphysical possibility is also an epistemic possibility. Even if\nthis is so, the notions of metaphysical possibility and epistemic\npossibility are distinct.)\n\nIn addition to various notions of epistemic possibility, philosophers\nhave been concerned with three particular notions of possibility that\nare generally regarded as non-epistemic: logical possibility,\nmetaphysical possibility, and physical possibility.\nOn one common view, the physical possibilities are a subset of the\nmetaphysical possibilities, which in turn are a subset of the logical\npossibilities. (But see Fine (2002) for an opposing view.) Here are a\ncouple of examples of things that are logically possible but neither\nmetaphysically nor physically possible: the Eiffel Tower\u2019s being\nred all over and green all over at the same time; the Eiffel\nTower\u2019s being red but not\n extended.[1]\n Here is an example of something that is logically and metaphysically\npossible but not physically possible: the Eiffel Tower\u2019s\ntraveling faster than the speed of light. The Eiffel Tower\u2019s\nbeing both red and not red at the same time is possible in none of the\nsenses while its traveling faster than a speeding bullet is possible\nin all of them.\n\nTo supplement these examples, it would be nice to give\ncharacterizations of the three notions that are free from controversy.\nThat is easier said than done. Nonetheless, we offer some\ncharacterizations that are relatively uncontroversial. Metaphysical\npossibility is often taken as a primitive notion that figures into the\nidea of a physical possibility: a proposition is physically possible\nif and only if it is metaphysically compossible with the laws of\nphysics. (Other nomological possibilities, such as chemical or\nbiological possibility, can be understood similarly.) Assuming that\nthe notion of a\n logical truth\n is understood, then the logical necessities are simply the logical\ntruths, so that the logical possibilities are those things whose\nnegations are not logical truths.\n\nWe end this overview of the modal characterization of the\nessential/accidental property distinction by mentioning a notion that\nis close to, but different from, that of an essential property. It is\neasy to confuse the notion of an essential property\u2014a property\nthat a thing could not lack\u2014with the notion of a\nproperty that a thing could not lose, so it is worth taking a\nminute to reflect on the difference. Of course, any property that a\nperson could not lack is one that that person could not lose, since by\nlosing a property the person comes to lack it. Still, the\n\u201creverse\u201d does not hold. There are properties that a\nperson could not lose\u2014like the property of having spent\nChristmas 2007 in Tennessee\u2014that are nevertheless not essential\nto that person.\n",
