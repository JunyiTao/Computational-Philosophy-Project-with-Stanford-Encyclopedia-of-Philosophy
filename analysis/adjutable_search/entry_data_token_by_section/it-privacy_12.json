    "main_text": "How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns? || Design methods\n3.1 Design methods\n\nValue sensitive design provides a \u201ctheoretically grounded\napproach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in\na principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design\nprocess\u201d (Friedman et al. 2006). It provides a set of rules and\nguidelines for designing a system with a certain value in mind. One\nsuch value can be \u2018privacy\u2019, and value sensitive design\ncan thus be used as a method to design privacy-friendly IT systems\n(Van den Hoven et al. 2015).  The \u2018privacy by design\u2019\napproach as advocated by Cavoukian (2009) and others can be regarded\nas one of the value sensitive design approaches that specifically\nfocuses on privacy (Warnier et al. 2015). More recently, approaches\nsuch as \u201cprivacy engineering\u201d (Ceross & Simpson 2018)\nextend the privacy by design approach by aiming to provide a more\npractical, deployable set of methods by which to achieve system-wide\nprivacy.\n\nThe privacy by design approach provides high-level guidelines in the\nform of principles for designing privacy-preserving systems.\nThese principles have at their core that \u201cdata protection needs\nto be viewed in proactive rather than reactive terms, making privacy\nby design preventive and not simply remedial\u201d (Cavoukian 2010).\nPrivacy by design\u2019s main point is that data protection should be\ncentral in all phases of product life cycles, from initial design to\noperational use and disposal (see Colesky et al. 2016) for a critical\nanalysis of the privacy by design approach). The Privacy Impact\nAssessment approach proposed by Clarke (2009) makes a similar point.\nIt proposes \u201ca systematic process for evaluating the potential\neffects on privacy of a project, initiative or proposed system or\nscheme\u201d (Clarke 2009). Note that these approaches should not\nonly be seen as auditing approaches, but rather as a means to make\nprivacy awareness and compliance an integral part of the\norganizational and engineering culture.\n\nThere are also several industry guidelines that can be used to design\nprivacy preserving IT systems. The Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard (see PCI DSS v3.2, 2018, in the Other Internet Resources),\nfor example, gives very clear guidelines for privacy and security\nsensitive systems design in the domain of the credit card industry and\nits partners (retailers, banks). Various International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) standards (Hone & Eloff 2002) also serve\nas a source of best practices and guidelines, especially with respect\nto information security, for the design of privacy friendly systems.\nFurthermore, the principles that are formed by the EU Data Protection\nDirective, which are themselves based on the Fair Information\nPractices (Gellman 2014) from the early 70s \u2013 transparency,\npurpose, proportionality, access, transfer \u2013 are technologically\nneutral and as such can also be considered as high level \u2018design\nprinciples\u2019. Systems that are designed with these rules and\nguidelines in mind should thus \u2013 in principle \u2013 be in\ncompliance with EU privacy laws and respect the privacy of its\nusers.\n\nThe rules and principles described above give high-level guidance for\ndesigning privacy-preserving systems, but this does not mean that if\nthese methodologies are followed the resulting IT system will\n(automatically) be privacy friendly. Some design principles are rather\nvague and abstract. What does it mean to make a transparent design or\nto design for proportionality? The principles need to be interpreted\nand placed in a context when designing a specific system. But\ndifferent people will interpret the principles differently, which will\nlead to different design choices, with different effects on privacy.\nThere is also a difference between the design and the implementation\nof a computer system. During the implementation phase software bugs\nare introduced, some of which can be exploited to break the system and\nextract private information. How to implement bug-free computer\nsystems remains an open research question (Hoare 2003). In addition,\nimplementation is another phase wherein choices and interpretations\nare made: system designs can be implemented in infinitely many ways.\nMoreover, it is very hard to verify \u2013 for anything beyond\nnon-trivial systems \u2013 whether an implementation meets its\ndesign/specification (Loeckx, Sieber, & Stansifer 1985). This is\neven more difficult for non-functional requirements such as\n\u2018being privacy preserving\u2019 or security properties in\ngeneral. \n\nSome specific solutions to privacy problems aim at increasing the\nlevel of awareness and consent of the user. These solutions can be\nseen as an attempt to apply the notion of informed consent to privacy\nissues with technology (Custers et al. 2018). This is connected to the\nidea that privacy settings and policies should be explainable to users\n(Pieters 2011). For example, the Privacy Coach supports customers in\nmaking privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags (Broenink et\nal. 2010). However, users have only a limited capability of dealing\nwith such choices, and providing too many choices may easily lead to\nthe problem of moral overload (van den Hoven, Lokhorst, & Van de\nPoel 2012). A technical solution is support for automatic matching of\na privacy policy set by the user against policies issued by web sites\nor apps.\n",
