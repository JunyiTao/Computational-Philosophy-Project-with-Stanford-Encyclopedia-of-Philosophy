    "main_text": "Henry of Ghent\n6. Henry of Ghent\n\n\nAlthough in a sense Thomas Aquinas defends a version of divine\nillumination, he in another sense clearly weakens the theory by giving\nit the status of an innate gift rather than ongoing patronage. In\nmaking for the agent intellect a central place in his theory of\ncognition, Aquinas has less room for illumination. As the thirteenth\ncentury progressed, philosophers and theologians were increasingly\nwilling to make this tradeoff. While the Aristotelian theory of\ncognition waxed, the Augustinian theory of divine illumination waned.\nTo combine the two seemed, in the words of \u00c9tienne Gilson\n(1930), \u201cunproductive and even, in a sense, contradictory.\u201d \n\n\nIt is this seemingly contradictory task that Henry of Ghent\n(c.1217\u20131293) took upon himself in the years immediately after\nAquinas\u2019s death. When Peter John Olivi remarked that he would accept\nthe theory of illumination because it \u201cbelongs to men who are highly\nvenerable\u201d (sec. 4 above), he would have had in mind among others\nHenry of Ghent, who would indeed become known as the \u201cVenerable\nDoctor\u201d (Doctor solemnis). Ghent was neither Dominican nor\nFranciscan, but a so-called \u201csecular\u201d master at the University of\nParis. His project was to defend an Aristotelian theory of cognition\nwhile at the same time reviving divine illumination in its traditional\nAugustinian form. To those, like Aquinas, who were arguing for the\nself-sufficiency of the human cognitive powers, Ghent replies,\nthis is true for natural things, as regards knowing what is\ntrue of the thing\u2026. Pure truth, however, or any truth that must be\ncognized supernaturally, or perhaps any truth at all, cannot be known\nwithout God himself doing the teaching (Summa 1.7 ad 1).\n\n\nOn Ghent\u2019s terminology, to know what is true of a thing is\nsimply to have a veridical impression of it: to represent a thing as it\nis. To grasp the truth of a thing, in contrast, is to grasp\nits nature. Only this latter sort of cognition counts as knowledge in\nthe strict sense, because only here are we getting at the unchanging\nreality of the material world.\nFor there is no knowledge of things insofar as they are\nexternal in effect, but insofar as their nature and quiddity is grasped\nby the mind (Summa 2.2 ad 1).\n\n\nFor knowledge of this kind, divine illumination is necessary. \n\n\nGhent\u2019s argument is interestingly different from that of Augustine and\nhis Franciscan followers. Whereas they had dismissed the physical\nworld as too changeable to be a fit subject for human knowledge, Ghent\nbelieves that pure truth and certain knowledge can be had of the\nphysical world, provided we manage to grasp the real essences of\nthings. Since we cannot do so on our own, we need divine illumination\nto go beyond sensory appearances, to have genuine insight into the\nnature of reality. At its most basic level, Ghent is offering a\ncritique of the agent intellect. Although he accepts the doctrine of\nagent intellect, he refuses to give that faculty the kind of efficacy\nthat it has for Aquinas and other medieval Aristotelians. Not\nsurprisingly, Ghent proposes reviving the earlier thirteenth-century\ntradition of referring to God himself as a kind of agent intellect\n(Quodlibet 9.15). The way Ghent would synthesize Augustine\nand Aristotle, in this area, is by identifying those aspects of\nAristotle that are incomplete and supplementing them with the\nnecessary Augustinian illumination. (This is a summary of the account\nin Pasnau 1995. All of Henry\u2019s important initial article from\nhis Summa on the possibility of knowledge is now available in\na translation from Roland Teske.)\n",
