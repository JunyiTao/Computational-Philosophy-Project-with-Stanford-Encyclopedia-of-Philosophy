    "main_text": "Critical Assessments\n5. Critical Assessments\n\nPragmatic theories of truth have faced several objections since first\nbeing proposed. Some of these objections can be rather narrow,\nchallenging a specific pragmatic account but not pragmatic theories in\ngeneral (this is the case with objections raised by other pragmatic\naccounts). This section will look at more general objections: either\nobjections that are especially common and persistent, or objections\nthat pose a challenge to the basic assumptions underlying pragmatic\ntheories more broadly.\n",
