    "main_text": "\n\nIn its broadest definition, \u201ccivic education\u201d means all\nthe processes that affect people\u2019s beliefs, commitments,\ncapabilities, and actions as members or prospective members of\ncommunities. Civic education need not be intentional or deliberate;\ninstitutions and communities transmit values and norms without meaning\nto. It may not be beneficial: sometimes people are civically educated\nin ways that disempower them or impart harmful values and goals. It is\ncertainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and\nyouth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just some\nof the institutions involved in civic education, understood as a\nlifelong\n process.[1]\n A rightly famous example is Tocqueville\u2019s often quoted\nobservation that local political engagement is a form of civic\neducation: \u201cTown meetings are to liberty what primary schools\nare to science; they bring it within the people\u2019s reach, they\nteach men how to use and how to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase \u201ccivic\neducation\u201d investigates deliberate programs of instruction\nwithin schools or colleges, in contrast to paideia (see\nbelow) and other forms of citizen preparation that involve a whole\nculture and last a lifetime. There are several good reasons for the\nemphasis on schools. First, empirical evidence shows that civic habits\nand values are relatively easily to influence and change while people\nare still young, so schooling can be effective when other efforts to\neducate citizens would fail (Sherrod, Flanagan, and Youniss, 2002).\nAnother reason is that schools in many countries have an explicit\nmission to educate students for citizenship. As Amy Gutmann points\nout, school-based education is our most deliberate form of human\ninstruction (1987, 15). Defining the purposes and methods of civic\neducation in schools is a worthy topic of public debate. Nevertheless,\nit is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education\ntakes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than\nschools.\n\nWhether defined narrowly or broadly, civic education raises empirical\nquestions: What causes people to develop durable habits, values,\nknowledge, and skills relevant to their membership in communities? Are\npeople affected differently if they vary by age, social or cultural\nbackground, and starting assumptions? For example, does a high school\ncivics course have lasting effects on various kinds of students, and\nwhat would make it more effective? \n\nFrom the 1960s until the 1980s, empirical questions concerning civic\neducation were relatively neglected, mainly because of a prevailing\nassumption that intentional programs would not have significant\nand durable effects, given the more powerful influences of social\nclass and ideology (Cook, 1985). Since then, many research studies and\nprogram evaluations have found substantial effects, and most social\nscientists who study the topic now believe that educational practices,\nsuch as discussion of controversial issues, hands-on action, and\nreflection, can influence students (Sherrod, Torney-Purta &\nFlanagan, 2010).\n\nThe philosophical questions have been less explored, but they are\nessential. For example:\n\n\n\nWho has the full rights and obligations of a citizen? This question is\nespecially contested with regard to children, immigrant aliens, and\nindividuals who have been convicted of felonies. \n\n\nIn what communities ought we see ourselves as citizens? The\nnation-state is not the only candidate; some people see themselves as\ncitizens of local geographical communities, organizations, movements,\nloosely-defined groups, or even the world as a whole.\n\n\nWhat responsibilities does a citizen of each kind of community have?\nDo all members of each community have the same responsibilities, or\nought there be significant differences, for example, between elders\nand children, or between leaders and other members?\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between a good regime and good citizenship?\nAristotle held that there were several acceptable types of regimes,\nand each needed different kinds of citizens. That makes the question\nof good citizenship relative to the regime-type. But other theorists\nhave argued for particular combinations of regime and citizen\ncompetence. For example, classical liberals endorsed regimes that\nwould make relatively modest demands on citizens, both because they\nwere skeptical that people could rise to higher demands and because\nthey wanted to safeguard individual liberty against the state. Civic\nrepublicans have seen a certain kind of citizenship--highly active and\ndeliberative--as constitutive of a good life, and therefore recommend\na republican regime because it permits good citizenship.\n\n\nWho may decide what constitutes good citizenship? If we consider, for\nexample, students enrolled in public schools in the United States,\nshould the decision about what values, habits, and capabilities they\nshould learn belong to their parents, their teachers, the children\nthemselves, the local community, the local or state government, or the\nnation-state? We may reach different conclusions when thinking about\n5-year-olds and adult college students. As Sheldon Wolin warned:\n\u201c\u2026[T]he inherent danger\u2026is that the identity given\nto the collectivity by those who exercise power will reflect the needs\nof power rather than the political possibilities of a complex\ncollectivity\u201d (1989, 13). For some regimes\u2014fascist or\ncommunist, for example\u2014this is not perceived as a danger at all\nbut, instead, the very purpose of their forms of civic education. In\ndemocracies, the question is more complex because public institutions\nmay have to teach people to be good democratic citizens, but they can\ndecide to do so in ways that reinforce the power of the state and\nreduce freedom.\n\n\nWhat means of civic education are ethically appropriate? It\nmight, for example, be effective to punish students who fail to\nmemorize patriotic statements, or to pay students for community\nservice, but the ethics of those approaches would be controversial. An\neducator might engage students in open discussions of current events\nbecause of a commitment to treating them as autonomous agents,\nregardless of the consequences. As with other topics, the proper\nrelationship between means and ends is contested.\n\n\nThese questions are rarely treated together as part of comprehensive\ntheories of civic education; instead, they arise in passing in works\nabout politics or education. Some of these questions have never been\nmuch explored by professional philosophers, but they arise frequently\nin public debates about citizenship.\n",
