    "main_text": "Introduction: Goals and methods of computational linguistics || Goals of computational linguistics\n1.1 Goals of computational linguistics\n\nThe theoretical goals of computational linguistics include the\nformulation of grammatical and semantic frameworks for characterizing\nlanguages in ways enabling computationally tractable implementations of\nsyntactic and semantic analysis; the discovery of processing techniques\nand learning principles that exploit both the structural and\ndistributional (statistical) properties of language; and the\ndevelopment of cognitively and neuroscientifically plausible\ncomputational models of how language processing and learning might\noccur in the brain.\nThe practical goals of the field are broad and varied. Some of the most\nprominent are: efficient text retrieval on some desired topic;\neffective machine translation (MT); question answering (QA), ranging\nfrom simple factual questions to ones requiring inference and\ndescriptive or discursive answers (perhaps with justifications); text\nsummarization; analysis of texts or spoken language for topic,\nsentiment, or other psychological attributes; dialogue agents for\naccomplishing particular tasks (purchases, technical trouble shooting,\ntrip planning, schedule maintenance, medical advising, etc.); and\nultimately, creation of computational systems with human-like\ncompetency in dialogue, in acquiring language, and in gaining knowledge\nfrom text.\n",
