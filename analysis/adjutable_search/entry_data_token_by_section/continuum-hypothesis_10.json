    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || Is There a Way Out?\n4.4 Is There a Way Out?\nThere appear to be four ways that the advocate of the generic\nmultiverse might resist the above criticism. \n First, one could maintain that the \u03a9 Conjecture is just as\nproblematic as CH and hence like CH it is to be regarded as\nindeterminate according to the generic-multiverse conception of\ntruth. The difficulty with this approach is the following: \n\nTheorem 4.8\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then, for any complete\nBoolean algebra \ud835\udd39, \n\nV \u22a7 \u03a9-conjecture\niff V\ud835\udd39 \u22a7 \u03a9-conjecture.\n\nThus, in contrast to CH, the \u03a9 Conjecture cannot be shown to\nbe independent of ZFC + \u201cThere is a proper class of Woodin\ncardinals\u201d via set forcing. In terms of the generic multiverse\nconception of truth, we can put the point this way: While the\ngeneric-multiverse conception of truth deems CH to be indeterminate,\nit does not deem the \u03a9 Conjecture to be\nindeterminate. So the above response is not available to the advocate\nof the generic-multiverse conception of truth. The advocate of that\nconception already deems the \u03a9 Conjecture to be\ndeterminate. \n Second, one could grant that the \u03a9 Conjecture is determinate\nbut maintain that it is false. There are ways in which one might do\nthis but that does not undercut the above argument. The reason is the\nfollowing: To begin with there is a closely related\n\u03a32-statement that one can substitute for the \u03a9\nConjecture in the above arguments. This is the statement that the\n\u03a9 Conjecture is (non-trivially) \u03a9-satisfiable, that is,\nthe statement: There exists an ordinal \u03b1 and a universe V\u2032 of\nthe multiverse such that \nV\u2032\u03b1 \u22a7 ZFC + \u201cThere is a\nproper class of Woodin cardinals\u201d\n and \nV\u2032\u03b1 \u22a7 \u201cThe \u03a9\nConjecture\u201d.\n This \u03a32-statement is invariant under set forcing\nand hence is one adherents to the generic multiverse view of truth\nmust deem determinate. Moreover, the key arguments above go through\nwith this \u03a32-statement instead of the \u03a9\nConjecture. The person taking this second line of response would thus\nalso have to maintain that this statement is false. But there is\nsubstantial evidence that this statement is true. The reason\nis that there is no known example of a \u03a32-statement\nthat is invariant under set forcing relative to large cardinal axioms\nand which cannot be settled by large cardinal axioms. (Such a\nstatement would be a candidate for an absolutely undecidable\nstatement.) So it is reasonable to expect that this statement is\nresolved by large cardinal axioms. However, recent advances in inner\nmodel theory\u2014in particular, those in Woodin (2010)\u2014provide\nevidence that no large cardinal axiom can refute this\nstatement. Putting everything together: It is very likely that this\nstatement is in fact true ; so this line of response is not\npromising. \n Third, one could reject either the Truth Constraint or the\nDefinability Constraint. The trouble is that if one rejects the Truth\nConstraint then on this view (assuming the \u03a9 Conjecture)\n\u03a02 truth in set theory is reducible in the sense of\nTuring reducibility to truth in H(\u03b40) (or,\nassuming the Strong \u03a9 Conjecture, H(c+)). And\nif one rejects the Definability Constraint then on this view (assuming\nthe \u03a9 Conjecture) \u03a02 truth in set theory is\nreducible in the sense of definability to truth in\nH(\u03b40) (or, assuming the Strong \u03a9 Conjecture,\nH(c+)). On either view, the reduction is in tension\nwith the acceptance of non-pluralism regarding the background theory\nZFC + \u201cThere is a proper class of Woodin cardinals\u201d. \n Fourth, one could embrace the criticism, reject the generic\nmultiverse conception of truth, and admit that there are some\nstatements about\nH(\u03b4+0)\n(or H(c+), granting, in addition, the\nAD+ Conjecture) that are true simpliciter but not true in\nthe sense of the generic-multiverse, and yet nevertheless continue to\nmaintain that CH is indeterminate. The difficulty is that any such\nsentence \u03c6 is qualitatively just like CH in that it can be forced\nto hold and forced to fail. The challenge for the advocate of this\napproach is to modify the generic-multiverse conception of truth in\nsuch a way that it counts \u03c6 as determinate and yet counts CH as\nindeterminate. \n In summary: There is evidence that the only way out is the fourth\nway out and this places the burden back on the pluralist\u2014the\npluralist must come up with a modified version of the generic\nmultiverse. \nFurther Reading: For more on the connection between\n\u03a9-logic and the generic multiverse and the above criticism of\nthe generic multiverse see Woodin (2011a). For the bearing of recent\nresults in inner model theory on the status of the \u03a9 Conjecture\nsee Woodin (2010). \n5. The Local Case Revisited\nLet us now turn to a second way in which one might resist the local\ncase for the failure of CH. This involves a parallel case for CH. In\nSection 5.1 we will review the main features of the case for \u00acCH\nin order to compare it with the parallel case for CH. In Section 5.2\nwe will present the parallel case for CH. In Section 5.3 we will\nassess the comparison. \n",
