The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions\n\n\u201cAs far back as evidence can be found\u2014and virtually\nwithout exception\u2014young adults seem to have been less attached\nto civic life than their parents and\n grandparents.\u201d[2]\n That is not evidence of decline--although it is often read as\nsuch--but rather indicates that becoming a citizen is a developmental\nprocess. It must be taught and learned. Most if not all societies\nrecognize a need to educate youth to be \u201ccivic-minded\u201d;\nthat is, to think and care about the welfare of the community (the\ncommonweal or civitas) and not simply about their own\nindividual well-being. Sometimes, civic education is also intended to\nmake all citizens, or at least prospective leaders, effective\nas citizens or to reduce disparities in political power by giving\neveryone the knowledge, confidence, and skills they need to\nparticipate. This section briefly introduces several conceptions of\ncivic education that have been influential in the history of the\n West.[3]\n\n",
