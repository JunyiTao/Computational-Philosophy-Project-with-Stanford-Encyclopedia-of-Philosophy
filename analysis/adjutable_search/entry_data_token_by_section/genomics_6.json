Beyond Sequencing\n\nThe post-HGP phase is marked by a flourishing of different projects,\nclosely connected in their origins to the HGP, but going beyond it in\nmany different ways. This section discusses two such post-HGP\nprojects, namely the International HapMap project and a new field of\nresearch called \u2018metagenomics\u2019.  These examples indicate\nsome important directions in which the postgenomic era is heading and\nidentify some, though certainly not all, of the key characteristics\nand issues that mark this new period.\n",
