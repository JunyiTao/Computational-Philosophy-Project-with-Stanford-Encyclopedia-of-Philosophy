    "main_text": "Related themes || Methodological questions in economics\n5.2 Business ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nBusiness ethics and discussions of corporate social responsibility are\nconcerned with the behavior of individuals and especially corporations\nin markets (see Marcoux 2008). The scope of such approaches depends to\nsome degree on the legal and cultural framework in which corporations\noperate. Arguably, the increased interest in these topics in the last\ndecades also has to do with the unwillingness or inability of states\nto regulate the behavior of firms more strongly (cf. also Smucker\n2006). One might therefore think that such measures are only\ninsufficient solutions for problems that states fail to solve. As\nsuch, however, they play a particularly important role for\ninternational markets, because the regulatory problems at a global\nlevel are unlikely to be overcome soon. Initiatives such as the UN\nGlobal Compact aim at introducing basic moral standards into\nglobal markets.\n\nHistorically, conceptions of \u201cdoing business\u201d have long\nbeen accompanied by ideas about certain moral norms, often captured in\nterms of the \u201chonor\u201d of the merchant (cf. e.g., Smith 1978\n[1762/66], 538f.). Even Friedman, in his famous article in which he\nclaims that \u201cThe Social Responsibility of Business is to\nIncrease its Profits\u201d, holds that business people should do this\n\u201cwhile conforming to the basic rules of society, both those\nembodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom\u201d\n(1970, emphasis added). As Heath argues, in pursuing profits firms\nhave a responsibility not to exploit market failures such as\ninformation asymmetries, which serves both ethics and efficiency\n(2014; for a critical discussion see e.g., Moriarty 2020). An\nimportant question that connects the topics of business ethics and\ncorporate social responsibility to the normative evaluation of markets\nis whether markets reward or punish ethical behavior, i.e. whether\nbusiness ethics is a cost or a strategic advantage for companies (cf.\ne.g., Porter/Kramer 2006 for how the latter might be achieved). This\ndepends on their institutional embedding, but also on the\nconsumers\u2019 \u201cethics of consumption\u201d, which is an\nimportant new field of research on markets (see e.g., Crocker/Linden\n1998; Schwarz 2010). The basic idea is that if consumers express not\nonly their self-interested, but also their moral choices in\nmarkets, markets can become instruments for making societies more just\nand economies more sustainable. At the same time, consumer-driven\nstrategies such as ethically motivated boycotts may need to fulfil\ncertain criteria in order not to undermine democratic legitimacy\n(Hussain 2012, Berkey 2021 and the literature quoted there). In many\nsocieties, these are ongoing processes, and it remains to be seen how\neffective they can be in steering the global economy onto a more just\nand more sustainable path.\n",
