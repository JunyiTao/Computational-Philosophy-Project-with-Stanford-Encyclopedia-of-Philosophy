    "main_text": "Dao and Virtue\n7. Naturalness and Nonaction\n\n\nThe Laozi makes use of the concept of ziran,\nliterally what is \u201cself (zi) so (ran),\u201d\nto describe the workings of Dao. As an abstract\nconcept, ziran gives no specific information, except to say\nthat Dao is not derived from or \u201cmodeled\u201d (fa)\nafter anything (ch. 25). However, since \u201cheaven and\nearth\u201d\u2014interpreted as nature in most modern\nstudies\u2014are said to be born of Dao and come to be in virtue of\ntheir de, the Laozi is in effect saying that the\nways of nature reflect the function of Dao.\n\n\nIn a cosmological reading, this suggests an understanding of nature as\ngoverned by the operation of qi energies in an ideal yin-yang\nsystem characterized by harmony and fecundity. As interpreted by Wang\nBi, the Laozi means more generally that there are\n\u201cprinciples\u201d (li) inherent in nature.\n\n\nHuman beings are, in turn, born of heaven and earth and so are\n\u201cmodeled\u201d after them, either in terms of\ntheir qi-constitution or in the sense that they are governed\nalso by the same basic principles. Usually translated as\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d or \u201cspontaneity,\u201d ziran\nthus builds on the concept of de in suggesting not only that\nthe power of Dao finds expression in nature, but also at the practical\nlevel a mode of being and way of action in accordance with the ways of\nnature.\n\n\nNature in the Daoist sense, it is important to note, need not exclude\nthe spiritual and the social. The existence of gods and spirits, which\ncan be understood also as being constituted by qi energies,\nwas hardly questioned in early China. The Laozi makes clear\nthat they, too, stem from Dao and form a part of the order of\nziran (e.g., chs. 39, 60).\n\n \nFurther, nature encompasses not only natural phenomena but also\nsociopolitical institutions. The king clearly occupies a central place\nin the realm of Dao (chs. 16, 25); the family also should be regarded\nas a \u201cnatural\u201d institution (chs. 18, 54). As an ethical\nconcept, ziran thus extends beyond the personal to the\nsociopolitical level. It is worth mentioning that ziran\nremains an influential idea today, especially in conceptions of love,\nbeauty, and one\u2019s attitude toward life and death in Chinese\nthinking.\n\n\nThe concept of wuwei, \u201cnonaction,\u201d serves to\nexplain naturalness in practice. Like \u201cnonbeing,\u201d\n\u201cnonaction\u201d is awkward, and some translators prefer\n\u201cnon-assertive action,\u201d \u201cnon-coercive action\u201d\nor \u201ceffortless action\u201d; but it identifies wuwei\nas a technical term. For this reason, I prefer\n\u201cnonaction,\u201d or better still, retaining wuwei in\nits transliterated form and explaining what it means in\nthe Laozi.\n\nWuwei does not mean total inaction. Later Daoists often\nemphasize the close connection between wuwei and techniques\nof spiritual cultivation\u2014the practice of \u201csitting in\nforgetfulness\u201d (zuowang) and \u201cfasting of the\nmind\u201d (xinzhai) discussed in the Zhuangzi are\nsingled out as prime examples in this regard. In the Laozi,\nwhile meditation and other forms of spiritual practice may be\nenvisaged, the concept of wuwei seems to be used more broadly\nas a contrast against any form of action characterized by self-serving\ndesire (e.g., chs. 3, 37).\n\n\nIt is useful to recall the late Zhou context, where disorder marched\non every front. The Laozi, one assumes, is not indifferent to\nthe forces of disintegration tearing the country asunder, although the\nremedy it proposes is subject to interpretation. The problems of\npolitical decline are traced to excessive desire, a violation\nof ziran. Naturalness encompasses basic human needs, of\ncourse, but these are to be distinguished from desire that fuels and\ninflates self-gratification, which knows no end. Nonaction entails at\nthe personal level simplicity and quietude, which naturally follow\nfrom having few desires. At the political level, the Laozi\ncondemns aggressive measures such as war (ch. 30), cruel punishment\n(ch. 74), and heavy taxation (ch. 75), which reflect but the ruler\u2019s\nown desire for wealth and power. If the ruler could rid himself of\ndesire, the Laozi boldly declares, the world would be at\npeace of its own accord (chs. 37, 57).\n\n\nIn this sense, the Laozi describes the ideal sage-ruler as\nsomeone who understands and follows ziran (e.g., chs. 2, 17,\n64). In this same sense, it also opposes the Confucian program of\nbenevolent intervention, which as the Laozi understands it,\naddresses at best the symptoms but not the root cause of the\ndisease. The Confucian project is in fact symptomatic of the decline\nof the rule of Dao. Conscious efforts at cultivating moral virtues\nonly accentuate the loss of natural goodness, which in its original\nstate would have been entirely commonplace and would not have\nwarranted distinction or special attention (chs. 18, 38). Worse,\nConfucian ethics assumes that learning and moral self-cultivation can\nbring about personal and social improvement. From the Daoist\nperspective, artificial effort to \u201cchange\u201d people,\n\u201cimprove\u201d things or to \u201ccorrect\u201d the order\nof ziran only perpetuates a false sense of self that\nalienates human beings from their inherent \u201cvirtue.\u201d\n\n\nThe concept of nonaction is exceedingly rich. It brings into play a\ncutting discernment that value distinctions are ideological, that\nhuman striving and competitive strife spring from the same\nsource. Nonaction entails also a critique of language and conventional\nknowledge, which to the Daoist sage has become impregnated with\nideological contaminants.\n\n\nThe use of paradoxes in the Laozi especially heightens this\npoint. For example, the person of Dao is depicted as\n\u201cwitless\u201d or \u201cdumb,\u201d whereas people driven by\ndesire appear intelligent and can scheme with cunning (ch. 20). The\nway of learning, as one would normally understand it,\n\u201cincreases\u201d the store of knowledge and adds value to goods\nand services; in contrast, questioning the very meaning of such\nknowledge and value, the Laozi describes the pursuit of Dao\nas constantly \u201cdecreasing\u201d or chipping away at the\nartifice built by desire (ch. 48).\n\n\nDriving home the same point, to cite but one more example,\nthe Laozi states, \u201cThe highest virtue is not virtuous;\ntherefore it has virtue\u201d (ch. 38). In other words, those who\nfully realize \u201cvirtue\u201d in the Daoist sense do not act in\nthe way that men and women of conventional morality typically act or\nare expected to act. Paradoxes of this kind function as a powerful\nrhetorical device, which forces the readers, so to speak, to move out\nof their \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d to wake up from their dogmatic\nslumber, and to take note of the proposed higher truth of Dao (see\nalso, e.g., chs. 41, 45, 56). In this context, one can also understand\nsome of the provocative statements in the Laozi telling the\nruler, for example, to keep the people in a state of\n\u201cignorance\u201d (ch. 65).\n\n\nSome scholars would object that this interpretation misses the\nreligious import of the Daodejing, while others would\nquestion whether it is too eager to defend the philosophical coherence\nof the classic. Perhaps the Laozi in chapter 65 of the\ncurrent text did mean to tell the ruler literally to keep the people\nignorant or stupid for better control, which as a piece of political\nadvice is not exactly extraordinary. The remarks offered here take\nnonaction as central to the Daoist view of life, recognizing that the\nconcept of wuwei does not only initiate a critique of value\nbut also points to a higher mode of knowledge, action, and being.\n\n\nAt the critical level, the Laozi emphasizes the relativity of\nknowledge and value. Things appear big or small, for example, only in\nrelation to other things; knowledge and ignorance are meaningful only\nin relation to each other. Good and bad, being and nonbeing, and other\nopposites should be understood in the same light (ch. 2).\n\n\nDistinctions as such are not necessarily problematic; for example, an\nobject can be described as rare or difficult to find as compared with\nother objects. Problems arise, however, when objects that are rare are\ndeemed more valuable than commonplace objects, when \u201cbig\u201d\nis deemed superior to \u201csmall,\u201d or in general terms when\ndistinctions become a basis for value discrimination. When certain\nthings or features (e.g., precious stones, reputation, being slim,\nskin color) are regarded as \u201cbeautiful\u201d or\n\u201cworthy\u201d\u2014i.e., desirable\u2014other things will\ninevitably be deemed \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cunworthy,\u201d\nwith serious social, economic, and political consequences (ch. 3).\n\n\nThe recognition of the relativity of value does not end in a kind of\nmoral relativism or ethical paralysis. The deconstruction of\nconventional beliefs and values opens the door to deeper reflection on\nthe order of ziran. The Laozi also does not appear\nto be advocating the obliteration of all distinctions, and by\nextension civilization as a whole, in a state of mystical oneness. For\nexample, while there is some concern that technology may bring a false\nsense of progress, the antidote does not lie in a deliberate rejection\nof technology but rather in a life of natural simplicity and\ncontentment that stems from having few desires (ch. 80).\n\n\nIn this way, the apparent conceptual inconsistency in\nthe Laozi can be resolved. On the one hand, there is little\nreason to equate, for example, \u201chardness\u201d with strength\nand assign a higher value to it over \u201csoftness.\u201d However,\nonce such value discrimination is shown to be arbitrary,\nthe Laozi can make use of qualities such as softness,\nweakness or yieldingness (e.g., ch. 78) to intimate the Daoist way of\nlife as grounded in nonaction. In this same way, the Laozi\ncan therefore also speak of Daoist virtue as the \u201chighest\ngood\u201d (ch. 8) and \u201chighest virtue\u201d\n(ch. 38). Wuwei ultimately derives its meaning\nfrom wu, which as an ethical orientation privileges\n\u201cnot having\u201d over the constant strivings of the mundane\nworld. This constitutes a radical critique of a world given to the\npursuit of wealth and power. More important, in being\n\u201cempty,\u201d the person of Dao is shown to be\n\u201cfull\u201d; without desire, he or she is able to rediscover\nthe riches of ziran and finds fulfillment.\n\n\nThe critique of value demonstrates the way in which desire\n(yu) perverts the mind\u2014xin, literally,\n\u201cheart,\u201d but understood as the seat of both cognition and\naffectivity\u2014and colors our judgment and experience of\nreality. Desire is a complex concept. Fundamentally, it depicts the\nmovement of the mind as it is drawn to things it finds agreeable\n(e.g., pleasure) or away from things it dislikes (e.g.,\npain). Phenomenologically, the mind is always in motion. Calmness or\ntranquility of mind does not mean the cessation of all cognitive or\naffective movement. Rather, from this perspective, it is the act of\ndesiring that transgresses the order of nature, resulting in a\nplethora of desires pulling the mind in different directions, that is\nseen to be at the heart of the problem. Nonaction contrasts sharply,\naccording to the Laozi, with the way people typically act in\na world in which the rule of Dao no longer prevails, with profit\nmotives, calculated steps, expectations, longings, regrets, and other\nexpressions of desire. Put differently, nonaction would be\n\u201cnormal\u201d action in the pristine order of nature, in which\nthe mind is at peace, free from the incessant stirring of desire.\n\n\nAs a philosophical concept, wuwei intimates a mode of being\nthat governs existential engagement at all levels, transforming the\nway in which we think, feel, and experience the world. It does not\nstipulate what one ought to do or ought not to do in particular\ncases. Terms such as quietude, emptiness, and simplicity favored by\nthe Laozi describe a general ethical orientation rather than\nspecific practices. Although in following wuwei there are\nthings that a person of Dao naturally would not do (e.g., wage a war\nof aggression), and there is a sense in which doing less may be more\nproductive than self-conscious over-exertion,\nphilosophically wuwei is not about not doing certain things\n(thus, military engagement is not ruled out entirely\u2014e.g., see\nchs. 67, 68, 69) but suggests a reorientation of perception and value\nthat ideally would bring an end to the dominance of desire and a\nreturn to the order of ziran.\n\n\nAgain, nonaction need not exclude spiritual practice\u2014ethics and\nspirituality generally form an integral whole in the Daoist\nframe\u2014rather, the point is that once realized, the\ntransformative power of nonaction would ensure not only personal\nfulfillment but also sociopolitical order. This seems to weigh against\na strictly mystical reading of the Laozi, if mysticism is\nunderstood to entail a kind of personal union with the Dao\ntranscending all political interests. The concept of\n\u201cvirtue,\u201d whether interpreted in terms of authenticity or\nthe purity and fullness of qi-energy, depicts a pristine\nnatural and sociopolitical order in which naturalness and nonaction\nare the norm. The ethics of wuwei rests on this insight.\n\n\nTo elaborate, wuwei as an ethical-spiritual ideal entails\nthat the man of Dao, the sage, would be free from the disquieting\nmovement of desire. This would naturally find expression in a mode of\nbeing and action characterized by not doing certain things (e.g.,\nbinge drinking) or doing less of certain things (e.g., consumption of\nalcohol). This is different from the argument that wuwei\nprescribes not doing or doing less of certain things, if such\nprescription requires deliberate effort. As a guide to recovering or\nattaining that ideal, there may be room for the ruler to impose\nconditions that would lead to a diminishing of desire-driven action;\nbut this is not quite ideal wuwei. Similarly, although it may\nbe said that nonaction points to a state of mind in which one does\neverything that one does, it is on the understanding that in that\nideal state certain actions simply would not occur as a matter of\ncourse, as the mind would not be aroused and move in their\ndirection. For example, to argue that there is a qualitatively\ndifferent wuwei way of stealing or gambling would not be\nmeaningful in the world of the Laozi, because such action\nwould not arise in the ideal realm of naturalness.\n\n\nTo elaborate further, consider the ideal ethical situation in the\ncosmological reading of the Laozi as represented by the\nHeshanggong commentary. The dispensation of qi gives rise to\na pristine hierarchical order in which those who are blessed with a\nperfect qi endowment, the rare sages, would govern the\nmajority. It can be assumed that the sages are naturally predisposed\nto quietude, whereas the common people are driven by desire in varying\ndegree. Indeed, at one point, the Laozi seems to distinguish\nthree different grades of human beings (ch. 41), which on this view\nwould be the result of their unequal qi endowment. The role\nof the sage-ruler, then, would be to guide the people to abide by\nsimplicity through personal charisma and example, and also by means of\npolicies designed to cultivate an environment in which desire would\nnot run rampant. In the absence of a true sage-ruler,\nthe Laozi is saying, according to this interpretation, those\nin power should emulate the Daoist sage, cultivate their\ninternal qi energies, and bring about peace and harmony\nthrough naturalness and nonaction.\n\n\nAn ontological reading can accommodate the theory that heaven and\nearth and the \u201cten thousand things\u201d are all constituted\nby qi. The decisive difference is that on this account, human\nbeings all share the same essential nature, as distinguished from\ntheir qi-constituted capacities. For example, some people may\nbe better endowed and therefore could live to a ripe old age, while\nothers with a poorer endowment may die prematurely; but this does not\ndetract from the fundamental assertion that they share the same\ninherent de, which defines their nature.\n\n\nSages are not a different kind of being, god-like, with a radically\ndifferent nature; rather, they are individuals who manage to realize\ntheir authentic de to the full. Unlike the cosmological\ninterpretation which essentially traces \u201csagehood\u201d to a\nspecial inborn sage-nature, the idea of an authentic ontological core\nassures the possibility of attaining sagehood. Being one with Dao does\nnot describe any mystical union with a divine source or sacred power,\nbut reflects a mode of being that accords with the assumed original\nnature marked by natural goodness and the absence of excessive\ndesire. Because the world is in a state of decline, the Laozi\ntherefore speaks of a \u201creturn\u201d to Dao, to naturalness and\nnonaction.\n\n\nRegardless of the position one takes, in this general interpretive\nframework a number of symbols which both delight and puzzle readers of\nthe Laozi can be highlighted. Suggestive of its creativity\nand nurturance, Dao is likened to a mother (e.g., chs. 1, 25). This\ncomplements the paradigm of the feminine (e.g., chs. 6, 28), whose\n\u201cvirtue\u201d is seen to yield fecundity and to find expression\nin yieldingness and non-contention. The infant (e.g., chs. 52, 55)\nserves as a fitting symbol on two counts. First, it brings out the\nrelationship between Dao and world; second, the kind of innocence and\nwholesome spontaneity represented by the infant exemplifies the\npristine fullness of de in the ideal Daoist world.\n\n\nNatural symbols such as water (e.g., chs. 8, 78) further reinforce the\nsense of yielding and deep strength that characterizes nonaction. The\nlow-lying and fertile valley (e.g., chs. 28, 39) accentuates both the\ncreative fecundity of Dao and the gentle nurturance of its\npower. Carefully crafted and ornately decorated objects are treasured\nby the world, and as such can be used as a powerful symbol for it. In\ncontrast, the utterly simple, unaffected, and seemingly\nvalueless pu, a plain uncarved block of wood, brings into\nsharp relief the integrity of Daoist virtue and of the person who\nembodies it (e.g., chs. 28, 32). Finally, one may mention the notion\nof reversal (e.g., chs. 40, 65), which suggests not only the need to\n\u201creturn\u201d to Dao, but also that the Daoist way of life\nwould inevitably appear the very opposite of \u201cnormal\u201d\nexistence, and that it involves a complete revaluation of values.\n\n\nIn sum, any interpretation of the current Laozi as a whole\nmust take into account (a) the \u201cnothingness\u201d of Dao and\n(b) the way in which wuwei and ziran provide a guide\nto the good life.\n\n\nWith respect to the latter, it is true that in many chapters the text\nseems to be addressing the ruler or the ruling elite, explaining to\nthem the ideal government of the Daoist sage. This is not surprising\ngiven the Zhou context and given that the production of written\ndocuments and the access to them were generally the preserve of the\nruling class in ancient China. However, this need not restrict\ninterpretation to politics in the narrow sense of statecraft or\npolitical strategies. In the light of the emphasis on\nziran and wuwei, there is sufficient evidence that\nthe Laozi views politics in a larger ethical-spiritual\ncontext, in which the flourishing of sociopolitical order is rooted in\nself-cultivation.\n\n\nIn the final analysis, naturalness and nonaction are seen to reflect\nthe function of the nameless and formless Dao. As such, Daoist ethical\nideals are anchored in a non-empirical, idealized view of\nnature. Specifically, the ethics of the Laozi rests on the\nunderstanding that de is inherent in nature, or better, the\nDaoist world. It is on this basis that the concept of de is\nraised to a higher level than \u201cvirtues\u201d in the sense of\nmoral attainments. Perhaps for this reason, the Laozi did not\nresort to the language of \u201chuman nature\u201d (xing)\ncommonly employed in early Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nThe understanding of de, however, is dependent on that of\nDao, which in turn hinges on the interpretation of wu as\neither original substance or nonbeing. Both readings are plausible and\nare within the semantic range of the Laozi. Whereas the\nformer subscribes to the prevalent qi theory that underlies\nmuch of Chinese philosophy and on that basis provides an integrated\nview of the cosmos, self-cultivation and government, the latter\nfocuses on the fundamental unity of being characterized by natural\nsimplicity and quietude that ideally should define the ethical course\nfor both the individual and society.\n\n\nThe Laozi should be recognized as a seminal work. It is\nprofoundly insightful; but it is the task of the interpreter to work\nout the full implications of its often provocative insight. It seems\nreasonable to assume that while the Laozi has something new\nto offer, it nonetheless shares certain background ideas and\nassumptions with other early Chinese philosophical texts. As such, the\ncosmological interpretation should be given due\nconsideration. However, in bringing into view the nothingness of Dao\nand the order of ziran, the Laozi invites reflection\non the very core of being beyond any cosmological assumptions. While\nthe production of meaning is context dependent, new horizons do emerge\nfrom great works of philosophy. The two lines of interpretation\noutlined here have different ethical implications regarding the nature\nof the ideal sage, but neither can be said to have transgressed the\nhermeneutic boundaries of the Daodejing. The suggestion that\nthey both arise from the Laozi is not a matter of\nequivocation but an acknowledgement of its hermeneutical depth (for a\ngood set of essays incorporating the latest scholarship on\nthe Laozi, see Liu 2015).\n\n\nThe power of the Daodejing does not lie in a clearly laid out\nset of doctrines, but in its seminal insights. The concept\nof qi may be culture specific, and the prospects of realizing\nuniversal Daoist order may seem remote, but the recognition of the\nfundamental problem of desire should still give us pause. The ills of\ndiscrimination, exploitation and intellectual hubris, so deeply\nembedded in language and value systems, remain as serious today as\nthey were in early China. The healing power of nonaction still strikes\na chord and commands continuing reflection and engagement. Although in\nworking out these insights differences will no doubt arise, they unite\nall interpreters of the Laozi and draw new generations of\nreaders into the mystery of Dao and (its) virtue.\n",
