    "main_text": "The Variety of Hyperintensional Phenomena || Hyperintensionality in the Non-Representational World\n1.2 Hyperintensionality in the Non-Representational World\n\nHyperintensionality was initially tied to representation: Cresswell\n(1975) discussed a semantics for a formal language where substitution\nof logical equivalents fails in intentional contexts (he mentioned\n\u201csays that\u201d, \u201cknows that\u201d, \u201cbelieves\nthat\u201d, \u201cdeduces that\u201d: 1975: 37). Other cases\ndiscussed above might contribute to the impression that our language\ncontains hyperintensional expressions just because of phenomena\ninvolving representation.\n\nHowever, various philosophers have employed hyperintensional resources\nto theorize about aspects of the world beyond representation.\nFamously, Fine (1994) argues that work on the essences of\nthings must play a central role in metaphysics and essence talk must\nbe hyperintensional. In the construction \u201c\\(x\\) is essentially\n\\(F\\)\u201d, we cannot be guaranteed to preserve truth by\nsubstituting necessarily equivalent predicates. Socrates is (suppose)\nessentially human, but not essentially (human and a member of a set),\nalthough necessarily someone is human if and only if they are human\nand a member of a set. Fine extends this to talk of real definition\ngenerally: it is the real definition of 2 that it is the successor of\n1, but not the real definition of 2 that it is \\(10-8\\), even though\n\u201cthe successor of 1\u201d and \u201c\\(10-8\\)\u201d\nnecessarily have the same extension. (These examples are not in Fine\n1994, but we take it he would endorse them given his discussion on pp.\n4\u20135 and p 14.) Dunn (1990b) also argues that one needs\nhyperintensional resources (in his case, from relevant logic) to\ncapture essentialist claims.\n\nNolan (2014) argues for the need to provide hyperintensional accounts\nof a range of non-representational aspects of reality. As well as a\ntheory of essences, theories of counterfactuals, explanation,\nmetaphysical grounding, of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties, of dispositions, are all plausibly\nhyperintensional. Nolan also mentions the analysis of causation, laws\nof nature, objective confirmation, objective chance, and objective\nethics. Other recent proposals in metaphysics that have employed\nhyperintensional resources include work on truthmakers, omissions,\nmetaphysical dependence, and the distinction between qualitative and\nnon-qualitative properties. Almost any area of metaphysics where\nnecessity or counterfactuals have played a role is a candidate for\nhyperintensional approaches. We now give a flavor of hyperintensional\ntheories of some of these topics.\n\nThe hyperintensionality of counterfactuals has been discussed above.\nDoes their truth depend in the right kind of way on facts beyond our\nrepresentational abilities? Nolan (2014: 156) argues that it sometimes\ndoes. Regular platonic solids come in only a handful of sizes (the\nmost sides one can have, in three-dimensional space, is 20.) Still,\nthis seems true:\n\n\nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have more sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron.\n\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n\nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have fewer sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron\n\n\nseems false. The truth value of these is not just settled by whether\nthe antecedent is necessary. They seem to be about pieces of steel and\nhow they relate to each other. Which blocks of steel have which shapes\nis not just about us and our representations. It would not be even if\nsteel could take shapes that it in fact cannot.\n\nExplanation is plausibly hyperintensional: \u201cexplains\u201d can\nbe flanked by expressions that cannot be substituted with necessary\nequivalents salva veritate. One pure mathematical truth can\nexplain another, but not every mathematical truth explains every\nother, even if every pure mathematical truth is a necessary truth\n(Baron, Colyvan, & Ripley 2020). Schneider (2011) argues that\nsometimes logical equivalents can explain each other, making a case\nthat \u201cbecause\u201d is hyperintensional. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is\ntrue because \\(A\\) is true, but not vice versa. If the correctness of\nexplanations turns out to depend also on how the world is, rather than\nonly on what suits our explanatory practices, these cases may be due\nto hyperintensional explanatory connections in the world. (How best to\nunderstand explanations, of course, remains a contentious\nphilosophical question.)\n\nMetaphysical grounding is widely regarded as hyperintensional.\nSometimes a more fundamental fact necessarily leads to a less\nfundamental fact that it grounds, but the two are merely modally\ninseparable. A widely discussed example is the grounding of the\nexistence of a set in the existence of its members. On one view,\n{Socrates, Plato} automatically exists if Socrates and Plato both\nexist, but it exists only in possible worlds where Socrates and Plato\nboth exist. So the fact that Socrates and Plato both exist grounds the\nfact that {Socrates, Plato} exists (see Dunn 1990b; Fine 1994). But\nthat {Socrates, Plato} exists is not supposed to ground the fact that\nSocrates and Plato both exist, even though necessarily one obtains\nonly if the other does. On an attractive account, many complex logical\ntruths are grounded in simpler ones. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is grounded in\n\\(A, (A \\land A)\\), is grounded in \\(A\\), and many other logical\nequivalents of \\(A\\) are grounded in \\(A\\), though they are not the\nsame proposition as \\(A\\). And as before, while \\((A \\land A)\\) is\ngrounded in \\(A, A\\) is not grounded in \\((A \\land A)\\) (see\nPoggiolesi 2018, 2020 for a formal logic of grounding).\n\nWhether grounding is indeed hyperintensional may depend on how\ngrounding claims are best understood. Where \u201c\u2026\ngrounds\u2026\u201d is a sentential operator, the cases discussed\nhad best be captured hyperintensionally. \u201c(Socrates and Plato\nboth exist) grounds (The set {Socrates, Plato} exists)\u201d, for\nexample. Things may work differently if we take \u201c\u2026\ngrounds\u2026\u201d as a two-place predicate applying to facts or\noccurrences: \u201cThe fact that Socrates and Plato both exist\ngrounds the fact that {Socrates, Plato} exists\u201d expresses a\nrelation between two objects, and we might be able to preserve the\ntruth of this statement by substitution of any other ways of referring\nto each of those objects. One complication is that one might take\nthese expressions picking out facts to themselves have constituents\ndesignating propositions: \u201cthe fact that Socrates and Plato both\nexist\u201d may have the logical form the fact that A, where\nthat \\(A\\) is the proposition that Socrates and Plato exist.\nInterpreted that way, the expression is functioning hyperintensionally\nafter all, since the necessarily equivalent proposition that\n{Socrates, Plato} exists cannot be substituted into that expression\nwithout changing the truth-value of the relevant grounding claims.\nFinally, one could take the primary way of expressing grounding\nrelations to be by talking about objects in general, e.g., about\nSocrates and Plato grounding the set {Socrates, Plato} (Schaffer\n2009). On this third approach it is natural to think that any other\nways of designating those objects could be substituted salva\nveritate so that the grounding-between-objects predicate is\nextensional; though see Jenkins (2011) for a hyperintensional\nobject-theoretic grounding approach that does not allow this\nsubstitution salva veritate.\n\nMany grounding theorists have taken the sentential operator approach\nas primary: see Fine (2001: 15\u201316), Schneider (2011:\n446\u20137). Those that do not fall on different sides of the\nquestion of whether expressing the full range of grounding claims\nrequires hyperintensional resources. See Duncan, Miller, and Norton\n(2017) for a discussion of which styles of grounding claims are best\ntreated as hyperintensional.\n\nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties features in\nmany metaphysical theories, and it appears to be\nrepresentation-independent: presumably, if mass is intrinsic it would\nremain such whatever we said or did. One idea behind the distinction\nis that a property had intrinsically is had only in virtue of an\nobject\u2019s own nature, while extrinsic properties are partly a\nmatter of how the object stands to other objects. Some have argued\nthat necessarily coextensive properties can differ in whether they are\nintrinsic or extrinsic (Dunn 1990a; Eddon 2011; Bader 2013; Marshall\n2015; Hoffmann-Kloss 2015). Being an instance of Barak\u2019s\nactual favorite property is plausibly extrinsic, but having a\nmass may well be intrinsic, even if mass is Barak\u2019s\nfavorite property, and even though, given it is actually his favorite\nproperty, anything in any possible world has the first property iff it\nhas the second. The above-named philosophers disagree on how to\ncharacterize the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, but they share the\nview that it has to be hyperintensional.\n\nJenkins and Nolan (2012) argue that disposition ascriptions are\nhyperintensional. Heidi the gifted mathematician may be disposed to\nfind the proof of a given conjecture, on condition that it has one.\nThis disposition of Heidi\u2019s can be known in advance of knowing\nwhether the conjecture has a proof. (\u201cGive this to Heidi: if\nthere\u2019s a proof to be found, she\u2019ll find it\u201d.)\nSuppose the conjecture is in fact false, though the mathematical\ncommunity does not yet know that. Then the condition of the\ndisposition ascription is impossible. Still, we cannot substitute any\nimpossibility in the disposition ascription. It is plausibly false\nthat Heidi is disposed to find the proof of that conjecture, on the\ncondition that she was always both identical to the number 7 and\ninnumerate, for example.\n\nWe use necessarily false conditions in disposition ascriptions outside\ntalk about agents, too. Working with a model where the number of prey\nkilled is a function of the number of predators, the model might say\nadding half a fox to a closed ecosystem, or adding \\(1/\\pi\\) foxes to\nan ecosystem, produces a certain fraction of additional rabbits\nkilled. But it is impossible to have, e.g., \\(7+1/\\pi\\) foxes. Still,\nwhat the ecosystem is disposed to do on the condition \\(7+1/\\pi\\)\nfoxes are added and it is idealized in various ways is very\ndifferent from what it is disposed to do with \\(105+1/\\pi\\) foxes and\nthe same idealization.\n\nOne way to specify probabilities is with propositional complements:\nthe probability that it will rain tomorrow, or that this coin will\ncome up heads 10 times in a row. Take claims such as \u201c\\(\\rP(B) =\n0.6\\)\u201d, where the proposition that \\(B\\) is, e.g., that this\n(biased) coin will come up heads 10 times in a row. \\(\\rP\\) will be\nhyperintensional if we cannot guarantee that we preserve truth value\nby substitution of necessarily equivalent propositions.\n\nIf we use \\(\\rP\\) to represent the (degrees of) beliefs of an\nagent\u2014even a logically idealized one\u2014we might want to\nallow different probability assignments to necessarily equivalent\npropositions: with all her exhaustive knowledge of pure arithmetic and\nlogic, the agent might still be uncertain on whether water =\nH2O before investigating, in spite of certainty on the\nself-identity of water. If the hyperintensional probability function\nrepresented objective chance or frequency, however,\nhyperintensionality may also be tied to how the world is. Nolan\n(2016a) and Salmon (2019) have both recently argued that objective\nchance ascriptions are hyperintensional.\n\nPlausibly, \u201cought\u201d is hyperintensional: perhaps you ought\nto call your sister, but it is not the case that you ought to call\nyour sister and be self-identical even though it is impossible to call\nyour sister without calling your sister and being self-identical, and\nvice versa. (Perhaps you promised to call: but unless you are a\nphilosopher you probably did not promise to be self-identical.) Some\nof these obligations might be dependent on our representational\npractices. But perhaps there are obligations of objective morality as\nwell. Perhaps your moral obligation to not callously cause suffering\nis like this. If there are objective obligations, they might be best\nconstrued as hyperintensional: the Moral Law may enjoin you to avoid\ncallously inflicting suffering, but it may be silent about whether you\nought to avoid inflicting callous suffering while being\nself-identical. See Faroldi (2019) for a recent hyperintensional\ntreatment of \u201cought\u201d.\n\nTruthmakers theorists have been looking for a relationship between\ntrue propositions and the aspects of the world that make those\npropositions true. Theories of this relation often make truthmaking\nhyperintensional: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) may be necessarily equivalent, yet\nthe worldly bit that makes \\(A\\) true is distinct from the one that\nmakes \\(B\\) true. As Restall (1996a) points out, this seems to follow\nif one also endorses the Disjunction Thesis: something is a truthmaker\nfor (\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)) iff it is a truthmaker for \\(A\\) or a\ntruthmaker for \\(B\\). Independently of the Disjunction Thesis, a\ntruthmaker for one necessary truth may plausibly not be a truthmaker\nfor all others: \u201cThere are infinitely many prime numbers\u201d\nshould have as truthmaker something to do with numbers. \u201cAnyone\nwho eats and drinks at least eats\u201d seems to not have anything to\ndo with numbers. See MacBride (2013 [2020], the SEP entry on\n truthmakers, section 1)\n for some accounts of truthmaking where necessarily equivalent\npropositions need not have the same truthmaker.\n\nSome occurrences are impossible, but may still have explanatory and\neven causal consequences. It may be impossible to prove a given\nmathematical conjecture: the conjecture might have a counterexample\nthat nobody has yet noticed. Still, the fact that the conjecture is\nnot proved may have various effects: if you have bet that you will\nprove it by a certain time you will lose the bet; if your tenure case\nin the mathematics department turns on whether you managed to prove\nthe conjecture, you will miss out on tenure. Bernstein (2016) gives a\ntheory of omissions of impossible outcomes, and argues that they play\nan explanatory and causal role.\n\nHoffmann-Kolss (2015) argues that a number of classifications of\nproperties needed for metaphysics are hyperintensional. The\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction is one example, discussed above.\nHoffman-Kolss also argues the qualitative/non-qualitative distinction\nis hyperintensional (the distinction between properties that do not\nrequire a relationship to a particular and those that do\u2014e.g.,\nbeing square vs. being John\u2019s neighbor: see\nalso Hoffman-Kolss 2019). The dispositional/categorical distinction is\narguably hyperintensional (Hoffmann-Kolss 2015: 341\u2013342, 346).\n(One philosophically controversial example may illustrate: on some\ntheories, there is a necessarily-existing God that is necessarily the\nonly omnipotent being. Still, we might think being omnipotent\nis dispositional, concerning the powers of that being, while being\nGod is categorical (2015: 346).) The distinction between\nperfectly natural properties that best carve at the joints, and the\nothers, is, too (2015: 345). Hoffman-Kolss\u2019s example here is to\ncontrast the (supposedly) perfectly natural property of being an\nelectron with the infinitely disjunctive identity property of\nbeing \\(e_1\\) or being \\(e_2\\) or\u2026 and so on\nfor all possible electrons \\(e\\). If electronhood is essential to the\nobjects that have it, something is an electron if and only if it is\none of \\(e_1\\), \\(e_2\\), etc., but Hoffman-Kolss argues this latter\ncondition is not a perfectly natural one.\n\nAny item on this list might be controversial. You might think that\ncounterfactual conditionals, for example, communicate more about how\nwe explain or predict the world than anything about the world as it\nis. Or that what explains what is more a matter of the representations\nwe make of the world, than of the world itself. One could try to\nexplain away grounding\u2019s putative hyperintensionality in terms\nof our cognitive structures, as Thompson (2016) suggests. Thompson and\nByrne (2019) offer a general \u201cconceptualist\u201d alternative\nto taking any of the cases we discussed as requiring\nnon-representational phenomena to be characterized in hyperintensional\nterms: an explanation of our use of hyperintensional language to\ncapture these phenomena comes from an account of what it is to\ndescribe and explain in these areas (2019: 157). Still, if a need to\nrecognize hyperintensional distinctions flows from more than facts\nabout how we represent the world, hyperintensionality will be of\ninterest well beyond philosophy of mind and language.\n",
