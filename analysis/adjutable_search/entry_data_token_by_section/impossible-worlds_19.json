    "main_text": "Objections to Impossible Worlds || The Semantics of Negation\n6.4 The Semantics of Negation\n\nThe standard semantic clause for negation has it that \\(\\neg A\\) is\ntrue if and only if \\(A\\) is not true. So there could not be worlds at\nwhich both or neither of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true, unless we\nrevise the semantics of negation. Stalnaker (1996) argues that\nnegation is such a basic operator, whose semantics is \u2018learned\nin a first logic class\u2019 that it had better be left alone.\n\nTo this, the impossible world theorist can reply that it is in fact\nthe case that \\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is not true; for\nthis concerns truth simpliciter, that is, truth at the actual\nworld. She may also agree that the same holds for any possible world.\nBut it is precisely impossible worlds that we are talking\nabout here; how negation works at any possible world need not be\naffected by the fact that, at some impossible world or other, some\nsentence can hold together with its negation: this is one of the\nthings that makes them impossible, after all.\n",
