Introduction: Epistemology of Experiment\n\nEpistemology of experiment is a branch of philosophy of science\nfocusing on the diverse roles that experiment plays in science, its\nvarious connections to theory, to the understanding and functions of\nexperimental apparatus, and to the structure and culture of the\nscientific community in the laboratory setting. The epistemological\nanalysis of experiments ranges from highly abstract philosophical\narguments with only indirect connection to actual practice, to\nanalysis immersed in reflective case studies. For a long time\nexperiments in physics have been the leading edge of experimental\nscience, pioneering experimental techniques, methods and innovative\nsettings. This is why much of epistemology of experiment has focused\non physics.\n\nThe 17th century witnessed the first philosophical reflections on the\nnature of experimentation. This should not be surprising given that\nexperiment was emerging as a central scientific tool at the time. The\naim of these reflections was to uncover why nature reveals its hidden\naspects to us when we force experimental methods upon it.\n\nSome natural philosophers believed that scientific knowledge was\nlittle more than the proper application of observational and\nexperimental techniques on natural phenomena. Francis Bacon went so\nfar as to claim that it was possible to perform what he called a\ncrucial experiment (experimentum crucis), an ideal experiment of sorts\nthat can determine alone which of two rival hypotheses is correct. And\neven some of the giants of modern science such as Newton subscribed to\nthe view that scientific theories are directly induced from\nexperimental results and observations without the help of untested\nhypotheses. It is little wonder, then, that many natural philosophers\nthought that experimental techniques and their proper application\nshould be a primary object of philosophical study of science.\n\nYet not everybody agreed. Hobbes, for instance pointed out that human\nreason preceded experimental techniques and their application. He\nthought that human reasoning reveals to us the natural law, and\ncriticized Boyle\u2019s optimism regarding experimental\nmethod\u2019s ability to reveal it (Shapin and Schaffer 1984).\nDoesn\u2019t human reason guide experimenter\u2019s actions, in the\nway it leads us to choose data and samples, and the way it allows us\nto interpret them, after all? If so, we should focus on the\nphilosophical study of reason and theoretical scientific reasoning\nrather than on the study of experimental techniques and their\napplications.\n\nThis vigorous early debate in many ways anticipated the main points of\ndisagreement in debates to come. Yet the philosophical interest in\nexperimentation almost completely lost its steam at the end of the\n19th century and did not recover until fairly late in the 20th\ncentury.\n\nDuring that period philosophers turned much of their attention to the\nstudy of the logical structure of scientific theories and its\nconnection to evidence. The tenets of logical positivism influenced\nthis area of investigation \u2014 as well as philosophy more\ngenerally \u2014 at the time. One of these tenets stated that\nobservational and theoretical propositions in science are separable.\nMy readings of the gradation on the scale of a mercury thermometer can\nbe separated from rather complicated theoretical statements concerning\nheat transfer and the theoretical concept of temperature.\n\nIn fact, not only can one separate theory and observation, but the\nformer is considered justified only in light of its correspondence\nwith the latter. The theory of heat transfer is confirmed by\npropositions originating in the kind of readings I perform on my\nmercury thermometer. Thus, observational propositions are simply a\nresult of an experiment or a set of observations a scientist performs\nin order to confirm or refute a theory.\n\nThomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend vigorously criticized this view. They\nargued that observations and experimental results are already part of\na theoretical framework and thus cannot confirm a theory\nindependently. Nor there is a theory-neutral language for capturing\nobservations. Even a simple reading of a mercury thermometer\ninevitably depends on a theoretically-charged concept of temperature.\nIn short, the evidence is always theory-laden.\n\nYet neither the proponents of logical positivism nor their critics\never attempted to explain the nature of experimentation that produces\nall-important observational statements. And the reason for this was\nvery simple: they didn\u2019t think that there was anything\ninteresting to explain. Their views on the relationship between theory\nand evidence were diametrically opposed, but they all found only the\nfinal product of experimentation, namely observational statements,\nphilosophically interesting. As a result, the experimental process\nitself was set aside in their philosophical study of science. This has\ngradually changed only with the advent of New Experimentalism, with\nIan Hacking\u2019s work at its forefront.\n2. Experimental Results\n2.1 Learning From Experiment\n2.1.1 Representing and Intervening\n\nIt has been more than three decades since Ian Hacking asked,\n\u201cDo we see through a microscope?\u201d (Hacking 1981).\nHacking\u2019s question really asked how do we come to believe in an\nexperimental result obtained with a complex experimental apparatus?\nHow do we distinguish between a valid\n result[2]\n and an artifact created by that apparatus? If experiment is to play\nall of the important roles in science mentioned above and to provide\nthe evidential basis for scientific knowledge, then we must have good\nreasons to believe in those results. Hacking provided an extended\nanswer in the second half of Representing and Intervening\n(1983). He pointed out that even though an experimental apparatus is\nladen with, at the very least, the theory of the apparatus,\nobservations remain robust despite changes in the theory of the\napparatus or in the theory of the phenomenon. His illustration was the\nsustained belief in microscope images despite the major change in the\ntheory of the microscope when Abbe pointed out the importance of\ndiffraction in its operation. One reason Hacking gave for this is that\nin making such observations the experimenters intervened\u2014they\nmanipulated the object under observation. Thus, in looking at a cell\nthrough a microscope, one might inject fluid into the cell or stain\nthe specimen. One expects the cell to change shape or color when this\nis done. Observing the predicted effect strengthens our belief in both\nthe proper operation of the microscope and in the observation. This is\ntrue in general. Observing the predicted effect of an intervention\nstrengthens our belief in both the proper operation of the\nexperimental apparatus and in the observations made with it.\n\nHacking also discussed the strengthening of one\u2019s belief in an\nobservation by independent confirmation. The fact that the same\npattern of dots\u2014dense bodies in cells\u2014is seen with\n\u201cdifferent\u201d microscopes, (e.g. ordinary, polarizing,\nphase-contrast, fluorescence, interference, electron, acoustic etc.)\nargues for the validity of the observation. One might question whether\n\u201cdifferent\u201d is a theory-laden term. After all, it is our\ntheory of light and of the microscope that allows us to consider these\nmicroscopes as different from each other. Nevertheless, the argument\nholds. Hacking correctly argues that it would be a preposterous\ncoincidence if the same pattern of dots were produced in two totally\ndifferent kinds of physical systems. Different apparatuses have\ndifferent backgrounds and systematic errors, making the coincidence,\nif it is an artifact, most unlikely. If it is a correct result, and\nthe instruments are working properly, the coincidence of results is\nunderstandable.\n2.1.2 Experimental Strategies\n\nHacking\u2019s answer is correct as far as it goes. It is, however,\nincomplete. What happens when one can perform the experiment with only\none type of apparatus, such as an electron microscope or a radio\ntelescope, or when intervention is either impossible or extremely\ndifficult? Other strategies are needed to validate the\n observation.[3]\n These may include:\n\nExperimental checks and calibration, in which the experimental\napparatus reproduces known phenomena. For example, if we wish to argue\nthat the spectrum of a substance obtained with a new type of\nspectrometer is correct, we might check that this new spectrometer\ncould reproduce the known Balmer series in hydrogen. If we correctly\nobserve the Balmer Series then we strengthen our belief that the\nspectrometer is working properly. This also strengthens our belief in\nthe results obtained with that spectrometer. If the check fails then\nwe have good reason to question the results obtained with that\napparatus.\nReproducing artifacts that are known in advance to be present. An\nexample of this comes from experiments to measure the infrared spectra\nof organic molecules (Randall et al. 1949). It was not always possible\nto prepare a pure sample of such material. Sometimes the experimenters\nhad to place the substance in an oil paste or in solution. In such\ncases, one expects to observe the spectrum of the oil or the solvent,\nsuperimposed on that of the substance. One can then compare the\ncomposite spectrum with the known spectrum of the oil or the solvent.\nObservation then of this artifact gives confidence in other\nmeasurements made with the spectrometer.\nElimination of plausible sources of error and alternative\nexplanations of the result (the Sherlock Holmes\n strategy).[4]\n Thus, when scientists claimed to have observed electric discharges in\nthe rings of Saturn, they argued for their result by showing that it\ncould not have been caused by defects in the telemetry, interaction\nwith the environment of Saturn, lightning, or dust. The only remaining\nexplanation of their result was that it was due to electric discharges\nin the rings\u2014there was no other plausible explanation of the\nobservation. (In addition, the same result was observed by both\nVoyager 1 and Voyager 2. This provided independent confirmation.\nOften, several epistemological strategies are used in the same\nexperiment.)\nUsing the results themselves to argue for their validity. Consider\nthe problem of Galileo\u2019s telescopic observations of the moons of\nJupiter. Although one might very well believe that his primitive,\nearly telescope might have produced spurious spots of light, it is\nextremely implausible that the telescope would create images that they\nwould appear to be a eclipses and other phenomena consistent with the\nmotions of a small planetary system. It would have been even more\nimplausible to believe that the created spots would satisfy\nKepler\u2019s Third Law (\\(\\bfrac{R^3}{T^2} = \\) constant). A similar\nargument was used by Robert Millikan to support his observation of the\nquantization of electric charge and his measurement of the charge of\nthe electron. Millikan remarked, \u201cThe total number of changes\nwhich we have observed would be between one and two thousand, and\nin not one single instance has there been any change which did not\nrepresent the advent upon the drop of one definite invariable quantity\nof electricity or a very small multiple of that quantity\u201d\n(Millikan 1911, p. 360). In both of these cases one is arguing that\nthere was no plausible malfunction of the apparatus, or background,\nthat would explain the observations.\nUsing an independently well-corroborated theory of the phenomena\nto explain the results. This was illustrated in the discovery of the\n\\(\\ce{W^{\\pm}}\\), the charged intermediate vector boson required by\nthe Weinberg-Salam unified theory of electroweak interactions.\nAlthough these experiments used very complex apparatuses and used\nother epistemological strategies (for details see Franklin 1986, pp.\n170\u201372). I believe that the agreement of the observations with\nthe theoretical predictions of the particle properties helped to\nvalidate the experimental results. In this case the particle\ncandidates were observed in events that contained an electron with\nhigh transverse momentum and in which there were no particle jets,\njust as predicted by the theory. In addition, the measured particle\nmass of \\(81\\pm 5\\) GeV/c2 and \\(80^{+10}_{-6}\\)\nGeV/c2, found in the two experiments (note the independent\nconfirmation also), was in good agreement with the theoretical\nprediction of \\(82\\pm 2.4\\) GeV/c2. It was very improbable\nthat any background effect, which might mimic the presence of the\nparticle, would be in agreement with theory.\nUsing an apparatus based on a well-corroborated theory. In this\ncase the support for the theory inspires confidence in the apparatus\nbased on that theory. This is the case with the electron microscope\nand the radio telescope, whose operations are based on a\nwell-supported theories, although other strategies are also used to\nvalidate the observations made with these instruments.\nUsing statistical arguments. An interesting example of this arose\nin the 1960s when the search for new particles and resonances occupied\na substantial fraction of the time and effort of those physicists\nworking in experimental high-energy physics. The usual technique was\nto plot the number of events observed as a function of the invariant\nmass of the final-state particles and to look for bumps above a smooth\nbackground. The usual informal criterion for the presence of a new\nparticle was that it resulted in a three standard-deviation effect\nabove the background, a result that had a probability of 0.27% of\noccurring in a single bin. This criterion was later changed to four\nstandard deviations, which had a probability of 0.0064% when it was\npointed out that the number of graphs plotted each year by high-energy\nphysicists made it rather probable, on statistical grounds, that a\nthree standard-deviation effect would be observed.\n\n\nThese strategies along with Hacking\u2019s intervention and\nindependent confirmation constitute an epistemology of experiment.\nThey provide us with good reasons for belief in experimental results,\nThey do not, however, guarantee that the results are correct. There\nare many experiments in which these strategies are applied, but whose\nresults are later shown to be incorrect (examples will be presented\nbelow). Experiment is fallible. Neither are these strategies exclusive\nor exhaustive. No single one of them, or fixed combination of them,\nguarantees the validity of an experimental result. Physicists use as\nmany of the strategies as they can conveniently apply in any given\nexperiment.\n2.1.3 Complexity of Experimental Practice\n\nIn How Experiments End (1987), Peter Galison extended the\ndiscussion of experiment to more complex situations. In his histories\nof the measurements of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, the\ndiscovery of the muon, and the discovery of weak neutral currents, he\nconsidered a series of experiments measuring a single quantity, a set\nof different experiments culminating in a discovery, and two high-\nenergy physics experiments performed by large groups with complex\nexperimental apparatus.\n\nGalison\u2019s view is that experiments end when the experimenters\nbelieve that they have a result that will stand up in court\u2014a\nresult that I believe includes the use of the epistemological\nstrategies discussed earlier. Thus, David Cline, one of the weak\nneutral-current experimenters remarked, \u201cAt present I\ndon\u2019t see how to make these effects [the weak neutral current\nevent candidates] go away\u201d (Galison, 1987, p. 235).\n\nGalison emphasizes that, within a large experimental group, different\nmembers of the group may find different pieces of evidence most\nconvincing. Thus, in the Gargamelle weak neutral current experiment,\nseveral group members found the single photograph of a\nneutrino-electron scattering event particularly important, whereas for\nothers the difference in spatial distribution between the observed\nneutral current candidates and the neutron background was decisive.\nGalison attributes this, in large part, to differences in experimental\ntraditions, in which scientists develop skill in using certain types\nof instruments or apparatus. In particle physics, for example, there\nis the tradition of visual detectors, such as the cloud chamber or the\nbubble chamber, in contrast to the electronic tradition of Geiger and\nscintillation counters and spark chambers. Scientists within the\nvisual tradition tend to prefer \u201cgolden events\u201d that\nclearly demonstrate the phenomenon in question, whereas those in the\nelectronic tradition tend to find statistical arguments more\npersuasive and important than individual events. (For further\ndiscussion of this issue see Galison 1997).\n\nGalison points out that major changes in theory and in experimental\npractice and instruments do not necessarily occur at the same time.\nThis persistence of experimental results provides continuity across\nthese conceptual changes. Thus, the experiments on the gyromagnetic\nratio spanned classical electromagnetism, Bohr\u2019s old quantum\ntheory, and the new quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Schrodinger.\nRobert Ackermann has offered a similar view in his discussion of\nscientific instruments.\n\nThe advantages of a scientific instrument are that it cannot change\ntheories. Instruments embody theories, to be sure, or we\nwouldn\u2019t have any grasp of the significance of their\noperation\u2026.Instruments create an invariant relationship between\ntheir operations and the world, at least when we abstract from the\nexpertise involved in their correct use. When our theories change, we\nmay conceive of the significance of the instrument and the world with\nwhich it is interacting differently, and the datum of an instrument\nmay change in significance, but the datum can nonetheless stay the\nsame, and will typically be expected to do so. An instrument reads 2\nwhen exposed to some phenomenon. After a change in\n theory,[5]\n it will continue to show the same reading, even though we may take\nthe reading to be no longer important, or to tell us something other\nthan what we thought originally (Ackermann 1985, p. 33).\n\n\nGalison also discusses other aspects of the interaction between\nexperiment and theory. Theory may influence what is considered to be a\nreal effect, demanding explanation, and what is considered background.\nIn his discussion of the discovery of the muon, he argues that the\ncalculation of Oppenheimer and Carlson, which showed that showers were\nto be expected in the passage of electrons through matter, left the\npenetrating particles, later shown to be muons, as the unexplained\nphenomenon. Prior to their work, physicists thought the showering\nparticles were the problem, whereas the penetrating particles seemed\nto be understood.\n\nThe role of theory as an \u201cenabling theory,\u201d (i.e., one\nthat allows calculation or estimation of the size of the expected\neffect and also the size of expected backgrounds) is also discussed by\nGalison. (See also (Franklin 1995) and the discussion of the\nStern-Gerlach experiment below). Such a theory can help to determine\nwhether an experiment is feasible. Galison also emphasizes that\nelimination of background that might simulate or mask an effect is\ncentral to the experimental enterprise, and not a peripheral activity.\nIn the case of the weak neutral current experiments, the existence of\nthe currents depended crucially on showing that the event candidates\ncould not all be due to neutron\n background.[6]\n\nThere is also a danger that the design of an experiment may preclude\nobservation of a phenomenon. Galison points out that the original\ndesign of one of the neutral current experiments, which included a\nmuon trigger, would not have allowed the observation of neutral\ncurrents. In its original form the experiment was designed to observe\ncharged currents, which produce a high energy muon. Neutral currents\ndo not. Therefore, having a muon trigger precluded their observation.\nOnly after the theoretical importance of the search for neutral\ncurrents was emphasized to the experimenters was the trigger changed.\nChanging the design did not, of course, guarantee that neutral\ncurrents would be observed.\n\nGalison also shows that the theoretical presuppositions of the\nexperimenters may enter into the decision to end an experiment and\nreport the result. Einstein and de Haas ended their search for\nsystematic errors when their value for the gyromagnetic ratio of the\nelectron, \\(g = 1\\), agreed with their theoretical model of orbiting\nelectrons. This effect of presuppositions might cause one to be\nskeptical of both experimental results and their role in theory\nevaluation. Galison\u2019s history shows, however, that, in this\ncase, the importance of the measurement led to many repetitions of the\nmeasurement. This resulted in an agreed-upon result that disagreed\nwith theoretical expectations.\n\nGalison has eventually modified his views. In Image and\nLogic, an extended study of instrumentation in 20th-century\nhigh-energy physics, Galison (1997) has extended his argument that\nthere are two distinct experimental traditions within that\nfield\u2014the visual (or image) tradition and the electronic (or\nlogic) tradition. The image tradition uses detectors such as cloud\nchambers or bubble chambers, which provide detailed and extensive\ninformation about each individual event. The electronic detectors used\nby the logic tradition, such as geiger counters, scintillation\ncounters, and spark chambers, provide less detailed information about\nindividual events, but detect more events. Galison\u2019s view is\nthat experimenters working in these two traditions form distinct\nepistemic and linguistic groups that rely on different forms of\nargument. The visual tradition emphasizes the single\n\u201cgolden\u201d event. \u201cOn the image side resides a\ndeep-seated commitment to the \u2018golden event\u2019: the single\npicture of such clarity and distinctness that it commands\nacceptance.\u201d (Galison, 1997, p. 22) \u201cThe golden event was\nthe exemplar of the image tradition: an individual instance so\ncomplete and well defined, so \u2018manifestly\u2019 free of\ndistortion and background that no further data had to be\ninvolved\u201d (p. 23). Because the individual events provided in the\nlogic detectors contained less detailed information than the pictures\nof the visual tradition, statistical arguments based on large numbers\nof events were required.\n\nKent Staley (1999) disagrees. He argues that the two traditions are\nnot as distinct as Galison believes:\n\nI show that discoveries in both traditions have employed the same\nstatistical [I would add \u201cand/or probabilistic\u201d] form of\nargument, even when basing discovery claims on single, golden events.\nWhere Galison sees an epistemic divide between two communities that\ncan only be bridged by creole- or pidgin-like\n\u2018interlanguage,\u2019 there is in fact a shared commitment to a\nstatistical form of experimental argument. (p. 96).\n\n\nStaley believes that although there is certainly epistemic continuity\nwithin a given tradition, there is also a continuity between the\ntraditions. This does not, I believe, mean that the shared commitment\ncomprises all of the arguments offered in any particular instance, but\nrather that the same methods are often used by both communities.\nGalison does not deny that statistical methods are used in the image\ntradition, but he thinks that they are relatively unimportant.\n\u201cWhile statistics could certainly be used within the image\ntradition, it was by no means necessary for most applications\u201d\n(Galison, 1997, p. 451). In contrast, Galison believes that arguments\nin the logic tradition \u201cwere inherently and inalienably\nstatistical. Estimation of probable errors and the statistical excess\nover background is not a side issue in these detectors\u2014it is\ncentral to the possibility of any demonstration at all\u201d (p.\n451).\n\nAlthough a detailed discussion of the disagreement between Staley and\nGalison would take us too far from the subject of this essay, they\nboth agree that arguments are offered for the correctness of\nexperimental results. Their disagreement concerns the nature of those\narguments. (For further discussion see Franklin, (2002), pp.\n9\u201317).\n2.2 The Case Against Learning From Experiment\n2.2.1 The Experimenters\u2019 Regress\n\nH. Collins, A. Pickering, and others, have raised objections to the\nview that experimental results are accepted on the basis of\nepistemological arguments. They point out that \u201ca sufficiently\ndetermined critic can always find a reason to dispute any alleged\n\u2018result\u2019\u201d (MacKenzie 1989, p. 412). Harry Collins,\nfor example, is well known for his skepticism concerning both\nexperimental results and evidence. He develops an argument that he\ncalls the \u201cexperimenters\u2019 regress\u201d (Collins 1985,\nchapter 4, pp. 79\u2013111): What scientists take to be a correct\nresult is one obtained with a good, that is, properly functioning,\nexperimental apparatus. But a good experimental apparatus is simply\none that gives correct results. Collins claims that there are no\nformal criteria that one can apply to decide whether or not an\nexperimental apparatus is working properly. In particular, he argues\nthat calibrating an experimental apparatus by using a surrogate signal\ncannot provide an independent reason for considering the apparatus to\nbe reliable.\n\nIn Collins\u2019 view the regress is eventually broken by negotiation\nwithin the appropriate scientific community, a process driven by\nfactors such as the career, social, and cognitive interests of the\nscientists, and the perceived utility for future work, but one that is\nnot decided by what we might call epistemological criteria, or\nreasoned judgment. Thus, Collins concludes that his regress raises\nserious questions concerning both experimental evidence and its use in\nthe evaluation of scientific hypotheses and theories. Indeed, if no\nway out of the regress can be found, then he has a point.\n\nCollins strongest candidate for an example of the experimenters\u2019\nregress is presented in his history of the early attempts to detect\ngravitational radiation, or gravity waves. (For more detailed\ndiscussion of this episode see (Collins 1985; 1994; Franklin 1994;\n1997a) In this case, the physics community was forced to compare J.\nWeber\u2019s claims that he had observed gravity waves with the\nreports from six other experiments that failed to detect them. On the\none hand, Collins argues that the decision between these conflicting\nexperimental results could not be made on epistemological or\nmethodological grounds\u2014he claims that the six negative\nexperiments could not legitimately be regarded as\n replications[7]\n and hence become less impressive. On the other hand, Weber\u2019s\napparatus, precisely because the experiments used a new type of\napparatus to try to detect a hitherto unobserved\n phenomenon,[8]\n could not be subjected to standard calibration techniques.\n\nThe results presented by Weber\u2019s critics were not only more\nnumerous, but they had also been carefully cross-checked. The groups\nhad exchanged both data and analysis programs and confirmed their\nresults. The critics had also investigated whether or not their\nanalysis procedure, the use of a linear algorithm, could account for\ntheir failure to observe Weber\u2019s reported results. They had used\nWeber\u2019s preferred procedure, a nonlinear algorithm, to analyze\ntheir own data, and still found no sign of an effect. They had also\ncalibrated their experimental apparatuses by inserting acoustic pulses\nof known energy and finding that they could detect a signal. Weber, on\nthe other hand, as well as his critics using his analysis procedure,\ncould not detect such calibration pulses.\n\nThere were, in addition, several other serious questions raised about\nWeber\u2019s analysis procedures. These included an admitted\nprogramming error that generated spurious coincidences between\nWeber\u2019s two detectors, possible selection bias by Weber,\nWeber\u2019s report of coincidences between two detectors when the\ndata had been taken four hours apart, and whether or not Weber\u2019s\nexperimental apparatus could produce the narrow coincidences\nclaimed.\n\nIt seems clear that the critics\u2019 results were far more credible\nthan Weber\u2019s. They had checked their results by independent\nconfirmation, which included the sharing of data and analysis\nprograms. They had also eliminated a plausible source of error, that\nof the pulses being longer than expected, by analyzing their results\nusing the nonlinear algorithm and by explicitly searching for such\nlong\n pulses.[9]\n They had also calibrated their apparatuses by injecting pulses of\nknown energy and observing the output.\n\nContrary to Collins, I believe that the scientific community made a\nreasoned judgment and rejected Weber\u2019s results and accepted\nthose of his critics. Although no formal rules were applied (e.g. if\nyou make four errors, rather than three, your results lack\ncredibility; or if there are five, but not six, conflicting results,\nyour work is still credible) the procedure was reasonable.\n\nPickering has argued that the reasons for accepting results are the\nfuture utility of such results for both theoretical and experimental\npractice and the agreement of such results with the existing community\ncommitments. In discussing the discovery of weak neutral currents,\nPickering states,\n\nQuite simply, particle physicists accepted the existence of the\nneutral current because they could see how to ply their trade more\nprofitably in a world in which the neutral current was real. (1984b,\np. 87)\n\n\nScientific communities tend to reject data that conflict with group\ncommitments and, obversely, to adjust their experimental techniques to\ntune in on phenomena consistent with those commitments. (1981, p.\n236)\n\n\nThe emphasis on future utility and existing commitments is clear.\nThese two criteria do not necessarily agree. For example, there are\nepisodes in the history of science in which more opportunity for\nfuture work is provided by the overthrow of existing theory. (See, for\nexample, the history of the overthrow of parity conservation and of CP\nsymmetry discussed below and in Franklin 1986, Ch. 1, 3.)\n2.2.2 Communal Opportunism and Plastic Resources\n\nPickering offered a different view of experimental results in late\n1980s. In his view the material procedure (including the experimental\napparatus itself along with setting it up, running it, and monitoring\nits operation), the theoretical model of that apparatus, and the\ntheoretical model of the phenomena under investigation are all plastic\nresources that the investigator brings into relations of mutual\nsupport. (Pickering 1987; Pickering 1989). He says:\n\nAchieving such relations of mutual support is, I suggest, the defining\ncharacteristic of the successful experiment. (1987, p. 199)\n\n\nHe uses Morpurgo\u2019s search for free quarks, or fractional charges\nof \\(\\tfrac{1}{3} e\\) or \\(\\tfrac{2}{3} e\\), where \\(e\\) is the charge\nof the electron. (See also Gooding 1992.) Morpurgo used a modern\nMillikan-type apparatus and initially found a continuous distribution\nof charge values. Following some tinkering with the apparatus,\nMorpurgo found that if he separated the capacitor plates he obtained\nonly integral values of charge. \u201cAfter some theoretical\nanalysis, Morpurgo concluded that he now had his apparatus working\nproperly, and reported his failure to find any evidence for fractional\ncharges\u201d (Pickering 1987, p. 197).\n\nPickering goes on to note that Morpurgo did not tinker with the two\ncompeting theories of the phenomena then on offer, those of integral\nand fractional charge:\n\nThe initial source of doubt about the adequacy of the early stages of\nthe experiment was precisely the fact that their\nfindings\u2014continuously distributed charges\u2014were consonant\nwith neither of the phenomenal models which Morpurgo was prepared to\ncountenance. And what motivated the search for a new instrumental\nmodel was Morpurgo\u2019s eventual success in producing findings in\naccordance with one of the phenomenal models he was willing to accept\n\n\nThe conclusion of Morpurgo\u2019s first series of experiments, then,\nand the production of the observation report which they sustained, was\nmarked by bringing into relations of mutual support of the three\nelements I have discussed: the material form of the apparatus and the\ntwo conceptual models, one instrumental and the other phenomenal.\nAchieving such relations of mutual support is, I suggest, the defining\ncharacteristic of the successful experiment. (p. 199)\n\n\nPickering has made several important and valid points concerning\nexperiment. Most importantly, he has emphasized that an experimental\napparatus is initially rarely capable of producing a valid\nexperimental results and that some adjustment, or tinkering, is\nrequired before it does. He has also recognized that both the theory\nof the apparatus and the theory of the phenomena can enter into the\nproduction of a valid experimental result. What one may question,\nhowever, is the emphasis he places on these theoretical components.\nFrom Millikan onwards, experiments had strongly supported the\nexistence of a fundamental unit of charge and charge quantization. The\nfailure of Morpurgo\u2019s apparatus to produce measurements of\nintegral charge indicated that it was not operating properly and that\nhis theoretical understanding of it was faulty. It was the failure to\nproduce measurements in agreement with what was already known (i.e.,\nthe failure of an important experimental check) that caused doubts\nabout Morpurgo\u2019s measurements. This was true regardless of the\ntheoretical models available, or those that Morpurgo was willing to\naccept. It was only when Morpurgo\u2019s apparatus could reproduce\nknown measurements that it could be trusted and used to search for\nfractional charge. To be sure, Pickering has allowed a role for the\nnatural world in the production of the experimental result, but it\ndoes not seem to be decisive.\n2.2.3 Critical Responses\n\nAckermann has offered a modification of Pickering\u2019s view. He\nsuggests that the experimental apparatus itself is a less plastic\nresource then either the theoretical model of the apparatus or that of\nthe phenomenon.\n\nTo repeat, changes in \\(A\\) [the apparatus] can often be seen (in real\ntime, without waiting for accommodation by \\(B\\) [the theoretical\nmodel of the apparatus]) as improvements, whereas\n\u2018improvements\u2019 in \\(B\\) don\u2019t begin to count unless\n\\(A\\) is actually altered and realizes the improvements conjectured.\nIt\u2019s conceivable that this small asymmetry can account,\nultimately, for large scale directions of scientific progress and for\nthe objectivity and rationality of those directions. (Ackermann 1991,\np. 456)\n\n\nHacking (1992) has also offered a more complex version of\nPickering\u2019s later view. He suggests that the results of mature\nlaboratory science achieve stability and are self-vindicating when the\nelements of laboratory science are brought into mutual consistency and\nsupport. These are (1) ideas: questions, background knowledge,\nsystematic theory, topical hypotheses, and modeling of the apparatus;\n(2) things: target, source of modification, detectors, tools, and data\ngenerators; and (3) marks and the manipulation of marks: data, data\nassessment, data reduction, data analysis, and interpretation.\n\nStable laboratory science arises when theories and laboratory\nequipment evolve in such a way that they match each other and are\nmutually self-vindicating. (1992, p. 56)\n\n\nWe invent devices that produce data and isolate or create phenomena,\nand a network of different levels of theory is true to these\nphenomena. Conversely we may in the end count them only as phenomena\nonly when the data can be interpreted by theory. (pp. 57\u20138)\n\n\nOne might ask whether such mutual adjustment between theory and\nexperimental results can always be achieved? What happens when an\nexperimental result is produced by an apparatus on which several of\nthe epistemological strategies, discussed earlier, have been\nsuccessfully applied, and the result is in disagreement with our\ntheory of the phenomenon? Accepted theories can be refuted. Several\nexamples will be presented below.\n\nHacking himself worries about what happens when a laboratory science\nthat is true to the phenomena generated in the laboratory, thanks to\nmutual adjustment and self-vindication, is successfully applied to the\nworld outside the laboratory. Does this argue for the truth of the\nscience. In Hacking\u2019s view it does not. If laboratory science\ndoes produce happy effects in the \u201cuntamed world,\u2026 it is\nnot the truth of anything that causes or explains the happy\neffects\u201d (1992, p. 60).\n2.2.4 The Dance of Agency\n\nPickering offered yet another, a somewhat revised account of science.\n\u201cMy basic image of science is a performative one, in which the\nperformances the doings of human and material agency come to the fore.\nScientists are human agents in a field of material agency which they\nstruggle to capture in machines (Pickering, 1995, p. 21).\u201d He\nthen discusses the complex interaction between human and material\nagency, which I interpret as the interaction between experimenters,\ntheir apparatus, and the natural world.\n\nThe dance of agency, seen asymmetrically from the human end, thus\ntakes the form of a dialectic of resistance and\naccommodations, where resistance denotes the failure to achieve\nan intended capture of agency in practice, and accommodation an active\nhuman strategy of response to resistance, which can include revisions\nto goals and intentions as well as to the material form of the machine\nin question and to the human frame of gestures and social relations\nthat surround it (p. 22).\u201c\n\n\nPickering\u2019s idea of resistance is illustrated by\nMorpurgo\u2019s observation of continuous, rather than integral or\nfractional, electrical charge, which did not agree with his\nexpectations. Morpurgo\u2019s accommodation consisted of changing his\nexperimental apparatus by using a larger separation between his\nplates, and also by modifying his theoretical account of the\napparatus. That being done, integral charges were observed and the\nresult stabilized by the mutual agreement of the apparatus, the theory\nof the apparatus, and the theory of the phenomenon. Pickering notes\nthat \u201dthe outcomes depend on how the world is (p. 182).\u201c\n\u201dIn this way, then, how the material world is leaks\ninto and infects our representations of it in a nontrivial and\nconsequential fashion. My analysis thus displays an intimate and\nresponsive engagement between scientific knowledge and the material\nworld that is integral to scientific practice (p. 183).\u201c\n\nNevertheless there is something confusing about Pickering\u2019s\ninvocation of the natural world. Although Pickering acknowledges the\nimportance of the natural world, his use of the term\n\u201dinfects\u201c seems to indicate that he isn\u2019t entirely\nhappy with this. Nor does the natural world seem to have much\nefficacy. It never seems to be decisive in any of Pickering\u2019s\ncase studies. Recall that he argued that physicists accepted the\nexistence of weak neutral currents because \u201dthey could ply their\ntrade more profitably in a world in which the neutral current was\nreal.\u201c In his account, Morpurgo\u2019s observation of\ncontinuous charge is important only because it disagrees with his\ntheoretical models of the phenomenon. The fact that it disagreed with\nnumerous previous observations of integral charge doesn\u2019t seem\nto matter. This is further illustrated by Pickering\u2019s discussion\nof the conflict between Morpurgo and Fairbank. As we have seen,\nMorpurgo reported that he did not observe fractional electrical\ncharges. On the other hand, in the late 1970s and early 1980s,\nFairbank and his collaborators published a series of papers in which\nthey claimed to have observed fractional charges (See, for example,\nLaRue, Phillips et al. 1981 ). Faced with this discord Pickering\nconcludes,\n\nIn Chapter 3, I traced out Morpurgo\u2019s route to his findings in\nterms of the particular vectors of cultural extension that he pursued,\nthe particular resistances and accommodations thus precipitated, and\nthe particular interactive stabilizations he achieved. The same could\nbe done, I am sure, in respect of Fairbank. And these tracings are all\nthat needs to said about their divergence. It just happened that the\ncontingencies of resistance and accommodation worked out differently\nin the two instances. Differences like these are, I think, continually\nbubbling up in practice, without any special causes behind them (pp.\n211\u2013212).\n\n\nThe natural world seems to have disappeared from Pickering\u2019s\naccount. There is a real question here as to whether or not fractional\ncharges exist in nature. The conclusions reached by Fairbank and by\nMorpurgo about their existence cannot both be correct. It seems\ninsufficient to merely state, as Pickering does, that Fairbank and\nMorpurgo achieved their individual stabilizations and to leave the\nconflict unresolved. (Pickering does comment that one could follow the\nsubsequent history and see how the conflict was resolved, and he does\ngive some brief statements about it, but its resolution is not\nimportant for him). At the very least one should consider the actions\nof the scientific community. Scientific knowledge is not determined\nindividually, but communally. Pickering seems to acknowledge this.\n\u201dOne might, therefore, want to set up a metric and say that\nitems of scientific knowledge are more or less objective depending on\nthe extent to which they are threaded into the rest of scientific\nculture, socially stabilized over time, and so on. I can see nothing\nwrong with thinking this way\u2026. (p. 196).\u201c The fact that\nFairbank believed in the existence of fractional electrical charges,\nor that Weber strongly believed that he had observed gravity waves,\ndoes not make them right. These are questions about the natural world\nthat can be resolved. Either fractional charges and gravity waves\nexist or they don\u2019t, or to be more cautious we might say that we\nhave good reasons to support our claims about their existence, or we\ndo not.\n\nAnother issue neglected by Pickering is the question of whether a\nparticular mutual adjustment of theory, of the apparatus or the\nphenomenon, and the experimental apparatus and evidence is justified.\nPickering seems to believe that any such adjustment that provides\nstabilization, either for an individual or for the community, is\nacceptable. Others disagree. They note that experimenters sometimes\nexclude data and engage in selective analysis procedures in producing\nexperimental results. These practices are, at the very least,\nquestionable as is the use of the results produced by such practices\nin science. There are, in fact, procedures in the normal practice of\nscience that provide safeguards against them. (For details see\nFranklin, 2002, Section 1).\n\nThe difference in attitudes toward the resolution of discord is one of\nthe important distinctions between Pickering\u2019s and\nFranklin\u2019s view of science. Franklin remarks that it is\ninsufficient simply to say that the resolution is socially stabilized.\nThe important question is how that resolution was achieved and what\nwere the reasons offered for that resolution. If we are faced with\ndiscordant experimental results and both experimenters have offered\nreasonable arguments for their correctness, then clearly more work is\nneeded. It seems reasonable, in such cases, for the physics community\nto search for an error in one, or both, of the experiments.\n\nPickering discusses yet another difference between his view and that\nof Franklin. Pickering sees traditional philosophy of science as\nregarding objectivity \u201das stemming from a peculiar kind of\nmental hygiene or policing of thought. This police function relates\nspecifically to theory choice in science, which,\u2026 is usually\ndiscussed in terms of the rational rules or methods responsible for\nclosure in theoretical debate (p. 197).\u201c He goes on to remark\nthat,\n\nThe most action in recent methodological thought has centered on\nattempts like Allan Franklin\u2019s to extend the methodological\napproach to experiments by setting up a set of rules for their proper\nperformance. Franklin thus seeks to extend classical discussions of\nobjectivity to the empirical base of science (a topic hitherto\nneglected in the philosophical tradition but one that, of course the\nmangle [Pickering\u2019s view] also addresses). For an argument\nbetween myself and Franklin on the same lines as that laid out below,\nsee (Franklin 1990, Chapter 8; Franklin 1991); and (Pickering 1991);\nand for commentaries related to that debate, (Ackermann 1991) and\n(Lynch 1991) (p. 197).\u201d\n\n\nFor further discussion see Franklin 1993b. Although\nFranklin\u2019s epistemology of experiment is designed to offer good\nreasons for belief in experimental results, they are not a set of\nrules. Franklin regards them as a set of strategies, from which\nphysicists choose, in order to argue for the correctness of their\nresults. As noted above, the strategies offered are neither exclusive\nor exhaustive.\n\nThere is another point of disagreement between Pickering and Franklin.\nPickering claims to be dealing with the practice of science, and yet\nhe excludes certain practices from his discussions. One scientific\npractice is the application of the epistemological strategies outlined\nabove to argue for the correctness of an experimental results. In\nfact, one of the essential features of an experimental paper is the\npresentation of such arguments. Writing such papers, a performative\nact, is also a scientific practice and it would seem reasonable to\nexamine both the structure and content of those papers.\n2.2.5 Hacking\u2019s \u2018The Social Construction of What\u2019?\n\nIan Hacking (1999, chapter 3) provided an incisive and interesting\ndiscussion of the issues that divide the constructivists (Collins,\nPickering, etc.) from the rationalists (Stuewer, Franklin, Buchwald,\netc.). He sets out three sticking points between the two views: 1)\ncontingency, 2) nominalism, and 3) external explanations of\nstability.\n\nContingency is the idea that science is not predetermined, that it\ncould have developed in any one of several successful ways. This is\nthe view adopted by constructivists. Hacking illustrates this with\nPickering\u2019s account of high-energy physics during the 1970s\nduring which the quark model came to dominate. (See Pickering\n1984a).\n\nThe constructionist maintains a contingency thesis. In the case of\nphysics, (a) physics theoretical, experimental, material) could have\ndeveloped in, for example, a nonquarky way, and, by the detailed\nstandards that would have evolved with this alternative physics, could\nhave been as successful as recent physics has been by its detailed\nstandards. Moreover, (b) there is no sense in which this imagined\nphysics would be equivalent to present physics. The physicist denies\nthat. (Hacking 1999, pp. 78\u201379).\n\n\nTo sum up Pickering\u2019s doctrine: there could have been a research\nprogram as successful (\u201cprogressive\u201d) as that of\nhigh-energy physics in the 1970s, but with different theories,\nphenomenology, schematic descriptions of apparatus, and apparatus, and\nwith a different, and progressive, series of robust fits between these\ningredients. Moreover and this is something badly in need of\nclarification the \u201cdifferent\u201d physics would not have been\nequivalent to present physics. Not logically incompatible with, just\ndifferent.\n\nThe constructionist about (the idea) of quarks thus claims that the\nupshot of this process of accommodation and resistance is not fully\npredetermined. Laboratory work requires that we get a robust fit\nbetween apparatus, beliefs about the apparatus, interpretations and\nanalyses of data, and theories. Before a robust fit has been\nachieved, it is not determined what that fit will be. Not determined\nby how the world is, not determined by technology now in existence,\nnot determined by the social practices of scientists, not determined\nby interests or networks, not determined by genius, not determined by\nanything (pp. 72\u201373, emphasis added).\n\n\nMuch depends here on what Hacking means by \u201cdetermined.\u201d\nIf he means entailed then one must agree with him. It is doubtful that\nthe world, or more properly, what we can learn about it, entails a\nunique theory. If not, as seems more plausible, he means that the way\nthe world is places no restrictions on that successful science, then\nthe rationalists disagree strongly. They want to argue that the way\nthe world is restricts the kinds of theories that will fit the\nphenomena, the kinds of apparatus we can build, and the results we can\nobtain with such apparatuses. To think otherwise seems silly. Consider\na homey example. It seems highly unlikely that someone can come up\nwith a successful theory in which objects whose density is greater\nthan that of air fall upwards. This is not a caricature of the view\nHacking describes. Describing Pickering\u2019s view, he states,\n\u201cPhysics did not need to take a route that involved\nMaxwell\u2019s Equations, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, or the\npresent values of the velocity of light (p. 70).\u201d Although one\nmay have some sympathy for this view as regards Maxwell\u2019s\nEquations or the Second Law of Thermodynamics, one may not agree about\nthe value of the speed of light. That is determined by the way the\nworld is. Any successful theory of light must give that value for its\nspeed.\n\nAt the other extreme are the \u201cinevitablists,\u201d among whom\nHacking classifies most scientists. He cites Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel\nPrize winner, \u201cAny intelligent alien anywhere would have come\nupon the same logical system as we have to explain the structure of\nprotons and the nature of supernovae (Glashow 1992, p. 28).\u201d\n\nAnother difference between Pickering and Franklin on contingency\nconcerns the question of not whether an alternative is possible, but\nrather whether there are reasons why that alternative should be\npursued. Pickering seems to identify can with\nought.\n\nIn the late 1970s there was a disagreement between the results of\nlow-energy experiments on atomic parity violation (the violation of\nleft-right symmetry) performed at the University of Washington and at\nOxford University and the result of a high-energy experiment on the\nscattering of polarized electrons from deuterium (the SLAC E122\nexperiment). The atomic-parity violation experiments failed to observe\nthe parity-violating effects predicted by the Weinberg- Salam (W-S)\nunified theory of electroweak interactions, whereas the SLAC\nexperiment observed the predicted effect. These early atomic physics\nresults were quite uncertain in themselves and that uncertainty was\nincreased by positive results obtained in similar experiments at\nBerkeley and Novosibirsk. At the time the theory had other evidential\nsupport, but was not universally accepted. Pickering and Franklin are\nin agreement that the W-S theory was accepted on the basis of the SLAC\nE122 result. They differ dramatically in their discussions of the\nexperiments. Their difference on contingency concerns a particular\ntheoretical alternative that was proposed at the time to explain the\ndiscrepancy between the experimental results.\n\nPickering asked why a theorist might not have attempted to find a\nvariant of electroweak gauge theory that might have reconciled the\nWashington-Oxford atomic parity results with the positive E122 result.\n(What such a theorist was supposed to do with the supportive atomic\nparity results later provided by experiments at Berkeley and at\nNovosibirsk is never mentioned). \u201cBut though it is true that\nE122 analysed their data in a way that displayed the improbability\n[the probability of the fit to the hybrid model was 6 \u00d7\n10\u22124] of a particular class of variant gauge\ntheories, the so-called \u2018hybrid models,\u2019 I do not believe\nthat it would have been impossible to devise yet more variants\u201d\n(Pickering 1991, p. 462). Pickering notes that open-ended recipes for\nconstructing such variants had been written down as early as 1972 (p.\n467). It would have been possible to do so, but one may ask whether or\nnot a scientist might have wished to do so. If the scientist agreed\nwith Franklin\u2019s view that the SLAC E122 experiment provided\nconsiderable evidential weight in support of the W-S theory and that a\nset of conflicting and uncertain results from atomic parity-violation\nexperiments gave an equivocal answer on that support, what reason\nwould they have had to invent an alternative?\n\nThis is not to suggest that scientists do not, or should not, engage\nin speculation, but rather that there was no necessity to do so in\nthis case. Theorists often do propose alternatives to existing,\nwell-confirmed theories.\n\nConstructivist case studies always seem to result in the support of\nexisting, accepted theory (Pickering 1984a; 1984b; 1991; Collins 1985;\nCollins and Pinch 1993). One criticism implied in such cases is that\nalternatives are not considered, that the hypothesis space of\nacceptable alternatives is either very small or empty. One may\nseriously question this. Thus, when the experiment of Christenson\net al. (1964) detected \\(\\ce{K2^0}\\) decay into two pions,\nwhich seemed to show that CP symmetry (combined particle-antiparticle\nand space inversion symmetry) was violated, no fewer than 10\nalternatives were offered. These included (1) the cosmological model\nresulting from the local dysymmetry of matter and antimatter, (2)\nexternal fields, (3) the decay of the \\(\\ce{K2^0}\\) into a\n\\(\\ce{K1^0}\\) with the subsequent decay of the \\(\\ce{K1^0}\\)into two\npions, which was allowed by the symmetry, (4) the emission of another\nneutral particle, \u201cthe paritino,\u201d in the \\(\\ce{K2^0}\\)\ndecay, similar to the emission of the neutrino in beta decay, (5) that\none of the pions emitted in the decay was in fact a\n\u201cspion,\u201d a pion with spin one rather than zero, (6) that\nthe decay was due to another neutral particle, the L, produced\ncoherently with the \\(\\ce{K^0}\\), (7) the existence of a\n\u201cshadow\u201d universe, which interacted with out universe only\nthrough the weak interactions, and that the decay seen was the decay\nof the \u201cshadow \\(\\ce{K2^0}\\),\u201d (8) the failure of the\nexponential decay law, 9) the failure of the principle of\nsuperposition in quantum mechanics, and 10) that the decay pions were\nnot bosons.\n\nAs one can see, the limits placed on alternatives were not very\nstringent. By the end of 1967, all of the alternatives had been tested\nand found wanting, leaving CP symmetry unprotected. Here the differing\njudgments of the scientific community about what was worth proposing\nand pursuing led to a wide variety of alternatives being tested.\n\nHacking\u2019s second sticking point is nominalism, or name-ism. He\nnotes that in its most extreme form nominalism denies that there is\nanything in common or peculiar to objects selected by a name, such as\n\u201cDouglas fir\u201d other than that they are called Douglas fir.\nOpponents contend that good names, or good accounts of nature, tell us\nsomething correct about the world. This is related to the\nrealism-antirealism debate concerning the status of unobservable\nentities that has plagued philosophers for millennia. For example Bas\nvan Fraassen (1980), an antirealist, holds that we have no grounds for\nbelief in unobservable entities such as the electron and that\naccepting theories about the electron means only that we believe that\nthe things the theory says about observables is true. A realist claims\nthat electrons really exist and that as, for example, Wilfred Sellars\nremarked, \u201cto have good reason for holding a theory is ipso\nfacto to have good reason for holding that the entities\npostulated by the theory exist (Sellars 1962, p. 97).\u201d In\nHacking\u2019s view a scientific nominalist is more radical than an\nantirealist and is just as skeptical about fir trees as they are about\nelectrons. A nominalist further believes that the structures we\nconceive of are properties of our representations of the world and not\nof the world itself. Hacking refers to opponents of that view as\ninherent structuralists.\n\nHacking also remarks that this point is related to the question of\n\u201cscientific facts.\u201d Thus, constructivists Latour and\nWoolgar originally entitled their book Laboratory Life: The Social\nConstruction of Scientific Facts (1979). Andrew Pickering\nentitled his history of the quark model Constructing Quarks\n(Pickering 1984a). Physicists argue that this demeans their work.\nSteven Weinberg, a realist and a physicist, criticized\nPickering\u2019s title by noting that no mountaineer would ever name\na book Constructing Everest. For Weinberg, quarks and Mount\nEverest have the same ontological status. They are both facts about\nthe world. Hacking argues that constructivists do not, despite\nappearances, believe that facts do not exist, or that there is no such\nthing as reality. He cites Latour and Woolgar \u201cthat\n\u2018out-there-ness\u2019 is a consequence of scientific\nwork rather than its cause (Latour and Woolgar 1986, p. 180).\u201d\nHacking reasonably concludes that,\n\nLatour and Woolgar were surely right. We should not explain\nwhy some people believe that \\(p\\) by saying that \\(p\\) is true, or\ncorresponds to a fact, or the facts. For example: someone believes\nthat the universe began with what for brevity we call a big bang. A\nhost of reasons now supports this belief. But after you have listed\nall the reasons, you should not add, as if it were an additional\nreason for believing in the big bang, \u2018and it is true that the\nuniverse began with a big bang.\u2019 Or \u2018and it is a\nfact.\u2019This observation has nothing peculiarly to do with social\nconstruction. It could equally have been advanced by an old-fashioned\nphilosopher of language. It is a remark about the grammar of the verb\n\u2018to explain\u2019 (Hacking 1999, pp. 80\u201381).\n\n\nOne might add, however, that the reasons Hacking cites as supporting\nthat belief are given to us by valid experimental evidence and not by\nthe social and personal interests of scientists. Latour and Woolgar\nmight not agree. Franklin argues that we have good reasons to believe\nin facts, and in the entities involved in our theories, always\nremembering, of course, that science is fallible.\n\nHacking\u2019s third sticking point is the external explanations of\nstability.\n\nThe constructionist holds that explanations for the stability of\nscientific belief involve, at least in part, elements that are\nexternal to the content of science. These elements typically include\nsocial factors, interests, networks, or however they be described.\nOpponents hold that whatever be the context of discovery, the\nexplanation of stability is internal to the science itself (Hacking\n1999, p. 92).\n\n\nRationalists think that most science proceeds as it does in the light\nof good reasons produced by research. Some bodies of knowledge become\nstable because of the wealth of good theoretical and experimental\nreasons that can be adduced for them. Constructivists think that the\nreasons are not decisive for the course of science. Nelson (1994)\nconcludes that this issue will never be decided. Rationalists, at\nleast retrospectively, can always adduce reasons that satisfy them.\nConstructivists, with equal ingenuity, can always find to their own\nsatisfaction an openness where the upshot of research is settled by\nsomething other than reason. Something external. That is one way of\nsaying we have found an irresoluble \u201csticking point\u201d (pp.\n91\u201392)\n\n\nThus, there is a rather severe disagreement on the reasons for the\nacceptance of experimental results. For some, like Staley, Galison and\nFranklin, it is because of epistemological arguments. For others, like\nPickering, the reasons are utility for future practice and agreement\nwith existing theoretical commitments. Although the history of science\nshows that the overthrow of a well-accepted theory leads to an\nenormous amount of theoretical and experimental work, proponents of\nthis view seem to accept it as unproblematical that it is always\nagreement with existing theory that has more future utility. Hacking\nand Pickering also suggest that experimental results are accepted on\nthe basis of the mutual adjustment of elements which includes the\ntheory of the phenomenon.\n\nNevertheless, everyone seems to agree that a consensus does arise on\nexperimental results.\n2.3 Measuring, Calibrating, Predicting\n\nWe have encountered (Section 2.2.1) Franklin\u2019s definition of\ncalibration as the use of a surrogate signal that has been established\nindependently of the apparatus being calibrated, or as the\nreproduction of independently (on an independent apparatus) well\nestablished phenomena. He used this account in order to argue against\nCollins\u2019s view of the viciousness of the experimenter\u2019s\nregress. Yet other accounts of calibration explaining the process of\nmeasurement evoke similar worries.\n\nE. Tal defines calibration as \u201cthe activity of establishing a\ncorrelation between indications of a measuring instrument and quantity\nvalues associated with a measurement standard\u201d (Tal 2017a, 243).\nMere \u201cinstrument indications\u201d (Tal 2017a) become\n\u201cmeasurement outcomes\u201d when interpreted in a larger\ncontext of theoretical background and calibration of the measuring\ninstrument. Yet Boyd (2021, 43) worries that this leaves the\nmeasurement open to the vicious regress akin to the\nexperimenter\u2019s regress H. Collins has argued for (see Section\n2.2.1), since the experimenters  do not \u201chave access to\ntrue values of the measurand [i.e., whatever is measured] to use as\nstandards of calibration\u201d.\n\nThe regress may be blocked by comparisons across measuring outcomes\nperformed in differently modeled measurements, i.e. across different\nmeasurement contexts (the context being constituted by intricacies of\nthe operational and theoretical background of apparata). (Tal 2017a,\n239) These different contexts are idealized and then compared in order\nto establish whether they cohere to the predictions concerning the\nmeasurand. Thus, calibration is \u201cthe activity of modeling\ndifferent processes and testing the consequences of such models for\nmutual compatibility\u201d (Tal 2017a, 246). An act of calibration is\neffectively the comparison of idealized models across measuring\nprocesses, where an act of measurement becomes justified by the\nmodels\u2019 mutual coherence.\n\nBoyd (2021, 46) states that idealizations of measurement processes\ncannot provide the foundation for objective measurement since\nidealizations strip the context of its key details. In fact, the\nmeasurement has an epistemic utility by virtue of the\ncontext-sensitive details. The measurement outcomes gain epistemic\nvalue only as \u201cenriched evidence\u201d, i.e., in the wider\nempirical and theoretical context.\n\nMoreover, Tal\u2019s view conflates prediction and calibration (Boyd\n2021, 48) taking us back to the viciousness of the\nexperimenter\u2019s regress. Thus, \u201cCalibration was supposed to\ndisrupt the regress because an instrument could be judged to be\nworking correctly in virtue of something other than success at its\nprincipal aim\u201d (Boyd 2021, 48). Calibration has to provide a\npoint outside the web of cohering predictions if it is to break the\nregress, e.g. by the subtle processing of instrument indications.\n\nProgressive coherentism\u2019s attempted way out of the vicious\nregress, as proposed by Hasok Chang (2004, 2007), points to a\nhistorical trajectory of the development of measuring procedures and\ncalibration. The web of cohering measuring process is dynamic: it\nunfolds in time as a spiral. And the measurement process that\ninitially aims at prediction eventually becomes a result used for\ncalibrating processes. Yet, such spiraling progress may be just an\nelaborate dynamic coherence web of Collins\u2019 type where\ninter-subjective agreement is the foundation, if other non-empirical\nvirtues such as \u201ccreative achievement\u201d play as important\nrole as the empirical ones as claimed by Chang (2007). If so,\ncalibration does not offer an independent leverage to the measurement\noutcomes after all.\n\nPerovi\u0107 (2017) analyzes in-situ calibration procedures in the\nLarge Hadron Collider pointing out that calibration serves as an\nepistemic leverage of Franklin\u2019s type during the commissioning\nphase of the experimental apparatus. But various calibration\nprocedures continue all along and gradually feed into the measurement\nitself during the entire measurement process. Boyd (2021) further\nexplores commissioning procedures and the gradual transition from\n\u201cengineering data\u201c to \u201cscience data\u201d, where\ncriteria of prediction significantly change. The apparatus initially\nrelies on the existing well-known data but then coherence with other\napparata that Tal insists on becomes increasingly less significant in\njustifying the measurement outcomes.\n2.4 Big Science Physics: Theory-ladenness in High Energy Physics\n\nAuthors like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend put forward the view that\nevidence does not confirm or refute a scientific theory since it is\nladen by it. Evidence is not a set of observational sentences\nautonomous from theoretical ones, as logical positivists believed.\nEach new theory or a theoretical paradigm, as Kuhn labeled larger\ntheoretical frameworks, produces, as it were, evidence anew.\n\nThus, theoretical concepts infect the entire experimental process from\nthe stage of design and preparation to the production and analysis of\ndata. A simple example that is supposed to convincingly illustrate\nthis view are measurements of temperature with a mercury thermometer\none uses in order to test whether objects expand when their\ntemperature increases. Note that in such a case one tests the\nhypothesis by relying on the very assumption that the expansion of\nmercury indicates increase in temperature.\n\nThere may be a fairly simple way out of the vicious circle in which\ntheory and experiment are caught in this particular case of\ntheory-ladenness. It may suffice to calibrate the mercury thermometer\nwith a constant volume gas thermometer, for example, where its use\ndoes not rely on the tested hypothesis but on the proportionality of\nthe pressure of the gas and its absolute temperature (Franklin et al.\n1989).\n\nAlthough most experiments are far more complex than this toy example,\none could certainly approach the view that experimental results are\ntheory-laden on a case-by-case basis. Yet there may be a more general\nproblem with the view.\n\nBogen and Woodward (1988) argued that debate on the relationship\nbetween theory and observation overlooks a key ingredient in the\nproduction of experimental evidence, namely the experimental\nphenomena. The experimentalists distill experimental phenomena from\nraw experimental data (e.g. electronic or digital tracks in particle\ncolliders) using various tools of statistical analysis. Thus,\nidentification of an experimental phenomenon as significant (e.g. a\npeak at a particular energy of colliding beams) is free of the theory\nthat the experiment may be designed to test (e.g. the prediction of a\nparticular particle). Only when significant phenomenon has been\nidentified can a stage of data analysis begin in which the phenomenon\nis deemed to either support or refute a theory. Thus, the\ntheory-ladenness of evidence thesis fails at least in some experiments\nin physics.\n\nThe authors substantiate their argument in part through an analysis of\nexperiments that led to a breakthrough discovery of weak neutral\ncurrents. It is a type of force produced by so-called bosons \u2014\nshort-lived particles responsible for energy transfer between other\nparticles such as hadrons and leptons. The relevant peaks were\nrecognized as significant via statistical analysis of data, and later\non interpreted as evidence for the existence of the bosons.\n\nThis view and the case study have been challenged by Schindler (2011).\nHe argues that the tested theory was critical in the assessment of the\nreliability of data in the experiments with weak neutral currents. He\nalso points out that, on occasion, experimental data can even be\nignored if they are deemed irrelevant from a theoretical perspective\nthat physicists find particularly compelling. This was the case in\nexperiments with so-called zebra pattern magnetic anomalies on the\nocean floor. The readings of new apparatuses used to scan the ocean\nfloor produced intriguing signals. Yet the researchers could not\ninterpret these signals meaningfully or satisfyingly distinguish them\nfrom noise unless they relied on some theoretical account of both the\nstructure of the ocean floor and the earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nKaraca (2013) points out that a crude theory-observation distinction\nis particularly unhelpful in understanding high-energy physics\nexperiments. It fails to capture the complexity of relevant\ntheoretical structures and their relation to experimental data.\nTheoretical structures can be composed of background, model, and\nphenomenological theories. Background theories are very general\ntheories (e.g. quantum field theory or quantum electrodynamics) that\ndefine the general properties of physical particles and their\ninteractions. Models are specific instances of background theories\nthat define particular particles and their properties. While\nphenomenological theories develop testable predictions based on these\nmodels.\n\nNow, each of these theoretical segments stands in a different\nrelationship to experimental data\u2014the experiments can be laden\nby a different segment to a different extent. This requires a nuanced\ncategorization of theory-ladeness, from weak to strong.\n\nThus, an experimental apparatus can be designed to test a very\nspecific theoretical model. UA1 and UA2 detectors at CERN\u2019s\nSuper Proton Synchrotron were designed to detect particles only in a\nvery specific energy regime in which W and Z bosons of the Standard\nModel were expected to exist.\n\nIn contrast, exploratory experiments approach phenomena without\nrelying on a particular theoretical model. Thus, sometimes a\ntheoretical framework for an experiment consists of phenomenological\ntheory alone. Karaca argues that experiments with deep-inelastic\nelectron-proton scattering in the late 1960s and early 1970s are\nexample of such weakly theory-laden experiments. The application of\nmerely phenomenological parameters in the experiment resulted in the\nvery important discovery of the composite rather than point-like\nstructure of hadrons (protons and neutrons), or the so-called scaling\nlaw. And this eventually led to a successful theoretical model of the\ncomposition of hadrons, namely quantum chromodynamics, or the\nquark-model of strong interactions.\n3. The Roles of Experiment\n3.1 A Life of Its Own\n\nAlthough experiment often takes its importance from its relation to\ntheory, Hacking pointed out that it often has a life of its own,\nindependent of theory. He notes the pristine observations of Carolyn\nHerschel\u2019s discovery of comets, William Herschel\u2019s work on\n\u201cradiant heat,\u201d and Davy\u2019s observation of the gas\nemitted by algae and the flaring of a taper in that gas. In none of\nthese cases did the experimenter have any theory of the phenomenon\nunder investigation. One may also note the nineteenth century\nmeasurements of atomic spectra and the work on the masses and\nproperties on elementary particles during the 1960s. Both of these\nsequences were conducted without any guidance from theory.\n\nIn deciding what experimental investigation to pursue, scientists may\nvery well be influenced by the equipment available and their own\nability to use that equipment (McKinney 1992). Thus, when the\nMann-O\u2019Neill collaboration was doing high energy physics\nexperiments at the Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator during the late\n1960s, the sequence of experiments was (1) measurement of the\n\\(\\ce{K+}\\) decay rates, (2) measurement of the \\(\\ce{K+_{e 3}}\\)\nbranching ratio and decay spectrum, (3) measurement of the \\(\\ce{K+_{e\n2}}\\) branching ratio, and (4) measurement of the form factor in\n\\(\\ce{K+_{e 3}}\\) decay. These experiments were performed with\nbasically the same experimental apparatus, but with relatively minor\nmodifications for each particular experiment. By the end of the\nsequence the experimenters had become quite expert in the use of the\napparatus and knowledgeable about the backgrounds and experimental\nproblems. This allowed the group to successfully perform the\ntechnically more difficult experiments later in the sequence. We might\nrefer to this as \u201cinstrumental loyalty\u201d and the\n\u201crecycling of expertise\u201d (Franklin 1997b). This meshes\nnicely with Galison\u2019s view of experimental traditions.\nScientists, both theorists and experimentalists, tend to pursue\nexperiments and problems in which their training and expertise can be\nused.\n\nHacking also remarks on the \u201cnoteworthy observations\u201d on\nIceland Spar by Bartholin, on diffraction by Hooke and Grimaldi, and\non the dispersion of light by Newton. \u201cNow of course Bartholin,\nGrimaldi, Hooke, and Newton were not mindless empiricists without an\n\u2018idea\u2019 in their heads. They saw what they saw because they\nwere curious, inquisitive, reflective people. They were attempting to\nform theories. But in all these cases it is clear that the\nobservations preceded any formulation of theory\u201d (Hacking 1983,\np. 156). In all of these cases we may say that these were observations\nwaiting for, or perhaps even calling for, a theory. The discovery of\nany unexpected phenomenon calls for a theoretical explanation.\n3.2 Confirmation and Refutation\n\nNevertheless several of the important roles of experiment involve its\nrelation to theory. Experiment may confirm a theory, refute a theory,\nor give hints to the mathematical structure of a theory.\n3.2.1 A Crucial Experiment: The Discovery of Parity Nonconservation\n\nLet us consider first an episode in which the relation between theory\nand experiment was clear and straightforward. This was a\n\u201ccrucial\u201d experiment, one that decided unequivocally\nbetween two competing theories, or classes of theory. The episode was\nthat of the discovery that parity, mirror-reflection symmetry or\nleft-right symmetry, is not conserved in the weak interactions. (For\ndetails of this episode see Franklin (1986, Ch. 1) and\n Appendix 1).\n Experiments showed that in the beta decay of nuclei the number of\nelectrons emitted in the same direction as the nuclear spin was\ndifferent from the number emitted opposite to the spin direction. This\nwas a clear demonstration of parity violation in the weak\ninteractions.\n3.2.2 A Persuasive Experiment: The Discovery of CP Violation\n\nAfter the discovery of parity and charge conjugation nonconservation,\nand following a suggestion by Landau, physicists considered CP\n(combined parity and particle-antiparticle symmetry), which was still\nconserved in the experiments, as the appropriate symmetry. One\nconsequence of this scheme, if CP were conserved, was that the\n\\(\\ce{K1^0}\\) meson could decay into two pions, whereas the\n\\(\\ce{K2^0}\\) meson could\n not.[10]\n Thus, observation of the decay of \\(\\ce{K2^0}\\) into two pions would\nindicate CP violation. The decay was observed by a group at Princeton\nUniversity. Although several alternative explanations were offered,\nexperiments eliminated each of the alternatives leaving only CP\nviolation as an explanation of the experimental result. (For details\nof this episode see Franklin (1986, Ch. 3) and\n Appendix 2.)\n3.2.3 Confirmation After 70 Years: The Discovery of Bose-Einstein Condensation\n\nIn both of the episodes discussed previously, those of parity\nnonconservation and of CP violation, we saw a decision between two\ncompeting classes of theories. This episode, the discovery of\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC), illustrates the confirmation of a\nspecific theoretical prediction 70 years after the theoretical\nprediction was first made. Bose (1924) and Einstein (1924; 1925)\npredicted that a gas of noninteracting bosonic atoms will, below a\ncertain temperature, suddenly develop a macroscopic population in the\nlowest energy quantum\n state.[11]\n (For details of this episode see\n Appendix 3.)\n3.3 Complications\n\nIn the three episodes discussed in the previous section, the relation\nbetween experiment and theory was clear. The experiments gave\nunequivocal results and there was no ambiguity about what theory was\npredicting. None of the conclusions reached has since been questioned.\nParity and CP symmetry are violated in the weak interactions and\nBose-Einstein condensation is an accepted phenomenon. In the practice\nof science things are often more complex. Experimental results may be\nin conflict, or may even be incorrect. Theoretical calculations may\nalso be in error or a correct theory may be incorrectly applied. There\nare even cases in which both experiment and theory are wrong. As noted\nearlier, science is fallible. In this section I will discuss several\nepisodes which illustrate these complexities.\n3.3.1 The Fall of the Fifth Force\n\nThe episode of the fifth force is the case of a refutation of an\nhypothesis, but only after a disagreement between experimental results\nwas resolved. The \u201cFifth Force\u201d was a proposed\nmodification of Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. The\ninitial experiments gave conflicting results: one supported the\nexistence of the Fifth Force whereas the other argued against it.\nAfter numerous repetitions of the experiment, the discord was resolved\nand a consensus reached that the Fifth Force did not exist. (For\ndetails of this episode see\n Appendix 4.)\n3.3.2 Right Experiment, Wrong Theory: The Stern-Gerlach Experiment\n\nThe Stern-Gerlach experiment was regarded as crucial at the time it\nwas performed, but, in fact,\n wasn\u2019t.[12]\n In the view of the physics community it decided the issue between two\ntheories, refuting one and supporting the other. In the light of later\nwork, however, the refutation stood, but the confirmation was\nquestionable. In fact, the experimental result posed problems for the\ntheory it had seemingly confirmed. A new theory was proposed and\nalthough the Stern-Gerlach result initially also posed problems for\nthe new theory, after a modification of that new theory, the result\nconfirmed it. In a sense, it was crucial after all. It just took some\ntime.\n\nThe Stern-Gerlach experiment provides evidence for the existence of\nelectron spin. These experimental results were first published in\n1922, although the idea of electron spin wasn\u2019t proposed by\nGoudsmit and Uhlenbeck until 1925 (1925; 1926). One might say that\nelectron spin was discovered before it was invented. (For details of\nthis episode see\n Appendix 5).\n3.3.3 Sometimes Refutation Doesn\u2019t Work: The Double-Scattering of Electrons\n\nIn the last section we saw some of the difficulty inherent in\nexperiment-theory comparison. One is sometimes faced with the question\nof whether the experimental apparatus satisfies the conditions\nrequired by theory, or conversely, whether the appropriate theory is\nbeing compared to the experimental result. A case in point is the\nhistory of experiments on the double-scattering of electrons by heavy\nnuclei (Mott scattering) during the 1930s and the relation of these\nresults to Dirac\u2019s theory of the electron, an episode in which\nthe question of whether or not the experiment satisfied the conditions\nof the theoretical calculation was central. Initially, experiments\ndisagreed with Mott\u2019s calculation, casting doubt on the\nunderlying Dirac theory. After more than a decade of work, both\nexperimental and theoretical, it was realized that there was a\nbackground effect in the experiments that masked the predicted effect.\nWhen the background was eliminated experiment and theory agreed.\n (Appendix 6)\n3.3.4 The Failure to Detect Anomalies\n\nEver vaster amounts of data have been produced by particle colliders\nas they have grown from room-size apparata, to tens of kilometers long\nmega-labs. Vast numbers of background interactions that are well\nunderstood and theoretically uninteresting occur in the detector.\nThese have to be combed in order to identify interactions of potential\ninterest. This is especially true of hadron (proton-proton) colliders\nlike the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the Higgs boson was\ndiscovered. Protons that collide in the LHC and similar hadron\ncolliders are composed of more elementary particles, collectively\nlabeled partons. Partons mutually interact, exponentially increasing\nthe number of background interactions. In fact, a minuscule number of\ninteractions are selected from the overwhelming number that occur in\nthe detector. (In contrast, lepton collisions, such as collisions of\nelectrons and positrons, produce much lower backgrounds, since leptons\nare not composed of more elementary particles.)\n\nThus, a successful search for new elementary particles critically\ndepends on successfully crafting selection criteria and techniques at\nthe stage of data collection and at the stage of data analysis. But\ngradual development and changes in data selection procedures in the\ncolliders raises an important epistemological concern. The main reason\nfor this concern is nicely anticipated by the following question,\nwhich was posed by one of the most prominent experimentalists in\nparticle physics: \u201cWhat is the extent to which we are negating\nthe discovery potential of very-high-energy proton machines by the\nnecessity of rejecting, a priori, the events we cannot afford to\nrecord?\u201d (Panofsky 1994, 133). In other words, how does one\ndecide which interactions to detect and analyze in a multitude, in\norder to minimize the possibility of throwing out novel and unexplored\nones?\n\nOne way of searching through vast amounts of data that are already in,\ni.e. those that the detector has already delivered, is to look for\noccurrences that remain robust under varying conditions of detection.\nPhysicists employ the technique of data cuts in such analysis. They\ncut out data that may be unreliable\u2014when, for instance, a data\nset may be an artefact rather than a genuine particle interaction the\nexperimenters expect. E.g. a colliding beam may interact with the\nwalls of the detector and not with the other colliding beam, while\nproducing a signal identical to the signal the experimenters expected\nthe beam-beam interaction to produce. Thus, if under various data cuts\na result remains stable, then it is increasingly likely to be correct\nand to represent the genuine phenomenon the physicists think it\nrepresents. The robustness of the result under various data cuts\nminimizes the possibility that the detected phenomenon only mimics the\ngenuine one (Franklin 2013, 224\u20135).\n\nAt the data-acquisition stage, however, this strategy does not seem\napplicable. As Panofsky suggests, one does not know with certainty\nwhich of the vast number of the events in the detector may be of\ninterest.\n\nYet, Karaca\n (2011)[13]\n argues that a form of robustness is in play even at the acquisition\nstage. This experimental approach amalgamates theoretical expectations\nand empirical results, as the example of the hypothesis of specific\nheavy particles is supposed to illustrate.\n\nAlong with the Standard Model of particle physics, a number of\nalternative models have been proposed. Their predictions of how\nelementary particles should behave often differ substantially. Yet in\ncontrast to the Standard Model, they all share the hypothesis that\nthere exist heavy particles that decay into particles with high\ntransverse momentum.\n\nPhysicists apply a robustness analysis in testing this hypothesis, the\nargument goes. First, they check whether the apparatus can detect\nknown particles similar to those predicted. Second, guided by the\nhypothesis, they establish various trigger algorithms. (The trigger\nalgorithms, or \u201cthe triggers\u201d, determine at what exact\npoint in time and under which conditions a detector should record\ninteractions. They are necessary because the frequency and the number\nof interactions far exceed the limited recording capacity.) And,\nfinally, they observe whether any results remain stable across the\ntriggers.\n\nYet even in this theoretical-empirical form of robustness, as Franklin\n(2013, 225) points out, \u201cthere is an underlying assumption that\nany new physics will resemble known physics\u201d\u2014usually a\ntheory of the day. And one way around this problem is for physicists\nto produce as many alternative models as possible, including those\nthat may even seem implausible at the time.\n\nPerovic (2011) suggests that such a potential failure, namely to spot\npotentially relevant events occurring in the detector, may be also a\nconsequence of the gradual automation of the detection process.\n\nThe early days of experimentation in particle physics, around WWII,\nsaw the direct involvement of the experimenters in the process.\nExperimental particle physics was a decentralized discipline where\nexperimenters running individual labs had full control over the\ntriggers and analysis. The experimenters could also control the goals\nand the design of experiments. Fixed target accelerators, where the\nbeam hits the detector instead of another beam, produced a number of\nparticle interactions that was manageable for such labs. The chance of\nmissing an anomalous event not predicted by the current theory was not\na major concern in such an environment.\n\nYet such labs could process a comparatively small amount of data. This\nhas gradually become an obstacle, with the advent of hadron colliders.\nThey work at ever-higher energies and produce an ever-vaster number of\nbackground interactions. That is why the experimental process has\nbecome increasingly automated and much more indirect. Trained\ntechnicians instead of experimenters themselves at some point started\nto scan the recordings. Eventually, these human scanners were replaced\nby computers, and a full automation of detection in hadron colliders\nhas enabled the processing of vast number of interactions. This was\nthe first significant change in the transition from small individual\nlabs to mega-labs.\n\nThe second significant change concerned the organization and goals of\nthe labs. The mega-detectors and the amounts of data they produced\nrequired exponentially more staff and scientists. This in turn led to\neven more centralized and hierarchical labs and even longer periods of\ndesign and performance of the experiments. As a result, focusing on\nconfirming existing dominant hypotheses rather than on exploratory\nparticle searches was the least risky way of achieving results that\nwould justify unprecedented investments.\n\nNow, an indirect detection process combined with mostly confirmatory\ngoals is conducive to overlooking of unexpected interactions. As such,\nit may impede potentially crucial theoretical advances stemming from\nmissed interactions.\n\nThis possibility that physicists such as Panofsky have acknowledged is\nnot a mere speculation. In fact, the use of semi-automated, rather\nthan fully-automated regimes of detection turned out to be essential\nfor a number of surprising discoveries that led to theoretical\nbreakthroughs.\n\nPerovic (2011) analyzes several such cases, most notably the discovery\nof the J/psi particle that provided the first substantial piece of\nevidence for the existence of the charmed quark. In the experiments,\nphysicists were able to perform exploratory detection and visual\nanalysis of practically individual interactions due to low number of\nbackground interactions in the linear electron-positron collider. And\nthey could afford to do this in an energy range that the existing\ntheory did not recognize as significant, which led to them making the\ndiscovery. None of this could have been done in the fully automated\ndetecting regime of hadron colliders that are indispensable when\ndealing with an environment that contains huge numbers of background\ninteractions.\n\nAnd in some cases, such as the Fermilab experiments that aimed to\ndiscover weak neutral currents, an automated and confirmatory regime\nof data analysis contributed to the failure to detect particles that\nwere readily produced in the apparatus.\n3.3.5 The \u2018Look Elsewhere\u2019 Effect: Discovering the Higgs Boson\n\nThe complexity of the discovery process in particle physics does not\nend with concerns about what exact data should be chosen out of the\nsea of interactions. The so-called look-elsewhere effect results in a\ntantalizing dilemma at the stage of data analysis.\n\nSuppose that our theory tells us that we will find a particle in an\nenergy range. And suppose we find a significant signal in a section of\nthat very range. Perhaps we should keep looking elsewhere within the\nrange to make sure it is not another particle altogether we have\ndiscovered. It may be a particle that left other undetected traces in\nthe range that our theory does not predict, along with the trace we\nfound. The question is to what extent we should look elsewhere before\nwe reach a satisfying level of certainty that it is the predicted\nparticle we have discovered.\n\nPhysicists faced such a dilemma during the search for the Higgs boson\nat the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Dawid 2015).\n\nThe Higgs boson is a particle responsible for the mass of other\nparticles. It is a scalar field that \u201cpulls back\u201d moving\nand interacting particles. This pull, which we call mass, is different\nfor different particles. It is predicted by the Standard Model,\nwhereas alternative models predict somewhat similar Higgs-like\nparticles.\n\nA prediction based on the Standard Model tells us with high\nprobability that we will find the Higgs particle in a particular\nrange. Yet a simple and an inevitable fact of finding it in a\nparticular section of that range may prompt us to doubt whether we\nhave truly found the exact particle our theory predicted. Our initial\nexcitement may vanish when we realize that we are much more likely to\nfind a particle of any sort\u2014not just the predicted\nparticle\u2014within the entire range than in a particular section of\nthat range. Thus, the probability of finding the Higgs anywhere within\na given energy range (consisting of eighty energy \u2018bins\u2019)\nis much higher than the probability of finding it at a particular\nenergy scale within that range (i.e. in any individual bin). In fact,\nthe likelihood of us finding it in a particular bin of the range is\nabout hundred times lower.\n\nIn other words, the fact that we will inevitably find the particle in\na particular bin, not only in a particular range, decreases the\ncertainty that it was the Higgs we found. Given this fact alone we\nshould keep looking elsewhere for other possible traces in the range\nonce we find a significant signal in a bin. We should not proclaim the\ndiscovery of a particle predicted by the Standard Model (or any model\nfor that matter) too soon. But for how long should we keep looking\nelsewhere? And what level of certainty do we need to achieve before we\nproclaim discovery?\n\nThe answer boils down to the weight one gives the theory and its\npredictions. This is the reason the experimentalists and theoreticians\nhad divergent views on the criterion for determining the precise point\nat which they could justifiably state \u2018Our data indicate that we\nhave discovered the Higgs boson\u2019. Theoreticians were confident\nthat a finding within the range (any of eighty bins) that was of\nstandard reliability (of three or four sigma), coupled with the\ntheoretical expectations that Higgs would be found, would be\nsufficient. In contrast, experimentalists argued that at no point of\ndata analysis should the pertinence of the look-elsewhere effect be\nreduced, and the search proclaimed successful, with the help of the\ntheoretical expectations concerning Higgs. One needs to be as careful\nin combing the range as one practically may. As a result, the\nexperimentalists\u2019 preferred value of sigmas for announcing the\ndiscovery was five. This is a standard under which very few findings\nhave turned out to be a fluctuation in the past.\n\nDawid argues that a question of an appropriate statistical analysis of\ndata is at the heart of the dispute. The reasoning of the\nexperimentalists relied on a frequentist approach that does not\nspecify the probability of the tested hypothesis. It actually isolates\nstatistical analysis of data from the prior probabilities. The\ntheoreticians, however, relied on Bayesian analysis. It starts with\nprior probabilities of initial assumptions and ends with the\nassessment of the probability of tested hypothesis based on the\ncollected evidence. The question remains whether the\nexperimentalists\u2019 reasoning was fully justified. The prior\nexpectations that the theoreticians had included in their analysis had\nalready been empirically corroborated by previous experiments after\nall.\n3.4 Other Roles\n3.4.1 Evidence for a New Entity: J.J. Thomson and the Electron\n\nExperiment can also provide us with evidence for the existence of the\nentities involved in our theories. J.J. Thomson\u2019s experiments on\ncathode rays provided grounds for belief in the existence of\nelectrons. (For details of this episode see\n Appendix 7).\n3.4.2 The Articulation of Theory: Weak Interactions\n\nExperiment can also help to articulate a theory. Experiments on beta\ndecay during from the 1930s to the 1950s determined the precise\nmathematical form of Fermi\u2019s theory of beta decay. (For details\nof this episode see\n Appendix 8.)\n4. Experiment and Observation\n\nThe distinction between observation and experiment is relatively\nlittle discussed in philosophical literature, despite its continuous\nrelevance to the scientific community and beyond in understanding\nspecific traits and segments of the scientific process and the\nknowledge it produces.\n\nDaston and her coauthors (Daston 2011; Daston and Lunbeck 2011; Daston\nand Galison 2007) have convincingly demonstrated that the distinction\nhas played a role in delineating various features of scientific\npractice. It has helped scientists articulate their reflections on\ntheir own practice.\n\nObservation is philosophically a loaded term, yet the epistemic status\nof scientific observation has evolved gradually with the advance of\nscientific techniques of inquiry and the scientific communities\npursuing them. Daston succinctly summarizes this evolution in the\nfollowing passage:\n\nCharacteristic of the emergent epistemic genre of the observations\nwas, first, an emphasis on singular events, witnessed first hand\n(autopsia) by a named author (in contrast to the accumulation of\nanonymous data over centuries described by Cicero and Pliny as typical\nof observationes); second, a deliberate effort to separate observation\nfrom conjecture (in contrast to the medieval Scholastic connection of\nobservation with the conjectural sciences, such as astrology); and\nthird, the creation of virtual communities of observers dispersed over\ntime and space, who communicated and pooled their observations in\nletters and publications (in contrast to passing them down from father\nto son or teacher to student as rare and precious treasures). (2011,\n81)\n\n\nObservation gradually became juxtaposed to other, more complex modes\nof inquiry such as experiment, \u201cwhose meaning shifted from the\nbroad and heterogeneous sense of experimentum as recipe, trial, or\njust common experience to a concertedly artificial manipulation, often\nusing special instruments and designed to probe hidden causes\u201d\n(Daston 2011, 82).\n\nIn the 17th century, observation and experiment were seen as \u201can\ninseparable pair\u201d (Daston 2011, 82) and by the 19th century they\nwere understood to be essentially opposed, with the observer\nincreasingly seen as passive and thus epistemically inferior to the\nexperimenter. In fact, already Leibniz anticipated this view stating\nthat \u201c[t]here are certain experiments that would be better\ncalled observations, in which one considers rather than produces the\nwork\u201d (Daston 2011, 86). This aspect of the distinction has been\na mainstay of understanding scientific practice ever since.\n\nShapere (1982) pointed out that the usage of the notion of observation\nis embedded in scientific practice, including testing and\njustification of scientific theories. Neutrinos arriving from the Sun\nare said to be observed in the detector but are also said to be an\nobservation of the Sun\u2019s core. Yet, the background knowledge\nprovides the foundation for a meaningful distinction. One the one hand\nthere are weakly interacting neutrinos leaving the Sun\u2019s core\nand entering detector practically interrupted. This may be justifiably\nqualified as \u201cdirect observation\u201d of the Sun\u2019s core.\nOn the other hand, there is a rather indirect observation of the core\nvia detection of light-photons that travel for billions of years from\nthe Sun\u2019s core through the plasma to the electromagnetic\ndetectors.\n\nThere are currently two prominent and opposed views of the\nexperiment-observation distinction. Ian Hacking has characterized it\nas well-defined, while avoiding the claim that observation and\nexperiment are opposites (Hacking 1983, 173). According to him, the\nnotions signify different things in scientific practice. The\nexperiment is a thorough manipulation that creates a new phenomenon,\nand observation of the phenomenon is its outcome. If scientists can\nmanipulate a domain of nature to such an extent that they can create a\nnew phenomenon in a lab, a phenomenon that normally cannot be observed\nin nature, then they have truly observed the phenomenon (Hacking 1989,\n1992).\n\nMeanwhile, other authors concur that \u201cthe familiar distinction\nbetween observation and experiment \u2026 [is] an artefact of the\ndisembodied, reconstructed character of retrospective accounts\u201d\n(Gooding 1992, 68). The distinction \u201ccollapses\u201d when we\nare faced with actual scientific practice as a process, and\n\u201cHacking\u2019s observation versus experiment framework does\nnot survive intact when put to the test in a range of cases of\nscientific experimentation\u201d (Malik 2017, 85). First, the uses of\nthe distinction cannot be compared across scientific fields. And\nsecond, as Gooding (1992) suggests, observation is a process too, not\nsimply a static result of manipulation. Thus, both observation and\nexperiment are seen as concurrent processes blended together in\nscientific practice.\n\nMalik (2017, 86) states that these arguments are the reason why\n\u201cvery few [authors] use Hacking\u2019s nomenclature of\nobservation/experiment\u201d and goes so far to conclude that\n\u201cto (try to) distinguish between observation and experiment is\nfutile.\u201d There is no point delineating the two except perhaps in\ncertain narrow domains; e.g., Hacking\u2019s notion of the experiment\nbased on creating phenomena might be useful within a narrow domain of\nparticle physics. (See also Chang 2011.) He advocates avoiding the\ndistinction altogether and opting for \u201cthe terminology [that]\nunderlines this sense of continuousness\u201d (Malik 2017, 88)\ninstead. If we want to analyze scientific practice, the argument goes,\nwe should leave behind the idea of the distinction as fundamental and\nturn to the characterization and analysis of various \u201cepistemic\nactivities\u201d instead, e.g., along the lines suggested by Chang\n(2011).\n\nA rather obvious danger of this approach is an over-emphasis on the\ncontinuousness of the notions of observation and experiment that\nresults in inadvertent equivocation. And this, in turn, results in\nsidelining the distinction and its subtleties in the analysis of the\nscientific practice, despite their crucial role in articulating and\ndeveloping that practice since the 17th century. It is possible\nthat these two notions form a continuum spreading along the axes of\nmanipulability and accessibility of both target phenomena and\nobservational conditions, and that the key points on such continuum\ndefine various evolving practices. Thus, each scientific practice may\nbe located on the continuum, with the location defining both its\nepistemic properties and the epistemic (as well as ethical)\nobligations that underlie it at a given time. (Perovi\u0107 2021)\n\nOn the one hand, the extent of the manipulation of phenomena and\nresearch conditions ranges from bodily manipulations  (e.g.\nfinding a convenient location to observe a planet with the naked eye)\nto the production of new phenomena in an elaborate apparatus like LHC\nat CERN, where the label \u201cexperiment\u201d aims to delineate a\nsubstantial threshold of manipulation. On the other hand, depending on\nthe background knowledge and aims of the research, observational\naccessibility ranges from mere detection of a potentially interesting\nphenomenon (e.g. a metal detector detects something in the ground),\nall the way to direct observation of the phenomenon\u2019s properties\n(e.g., the microscopic analysis of a metal object).\n5. Some Comparisons With Experiment in Biology\n5.1 Epistemological Strategies and the Peppered Moth Experiment\n\nOne comment that has been made concerning the philosophy of experiment\nis that all of the examples are taken from physics and are therefore\nlimited. In this section arguments will be presented that these\ndiscussions also apply to biology.\n\nAlthough all of the illustrations of the epistemology of experiment\ncome from physics, David Rudge (1998; 2001) has shown that they are\nalso used in biology. His example is Kettlewell\u2019s (1955; 1956;\n1958) evolutionary biology experiments on the Peppered Moth,\nBiston betularia. The typical form of the moth has a\npale speckled appearance and there are two darker forms, f.\ncarbonaria, which is nearly black, and f. insularia,\nwhich is intermediate in color. The typical form of the moth\nwas most prevalent in the British Isles and Europe until the middle of\nthe nineteenth century. At that time things began to change.\nIncreasing industrial pollution had both darkened the surfaces of\ntrees and rocks and had also killed the lichen cover of the forests\ndownwind of pollution sources. Coincident with these changes,\nnaturalists had found that rare, darker forms of several moth species,\nin particular the Peppered Moth, had become common in areas downwind\nof pollution sources.\n\nKettlewell attempted to test a selectionist explanation of this\nphenomenon. E.B. Ford (1937; 1940) had suggested a two-part\nexplanation of this effect: 1) darker moths had a superior physiology\nand 2) the spread of the melanic gene was confined to industrial areas\nbecause the darker color made carbonaria more conspicuous to\navian predators in rural areas and less conspicuous in polluted areas.\nKettlewell believed that Ford had established the superior viability\nof darker moths and he wanted to test the hypothesis that the darker\nform of the moth was less conspicuous to predators in industrial\nareas.\n\nKettlewell\u2019s investigations consisted of three parts. In the\nfirst part he used human observers to investigate whether his proposed\nscoring method would be accurate in assessing the relative\nconspicuousness of different types of moths against different\nbackgrounds. The tests showed that moths on \u201ccorrect\u201d\nbackgrounds, typical on lichen covered backgrounds and dark\nmoths on soot-blackened backgrounds were almost always judged\ninconspicuous, whereas moths on \u201cincorrect\u201d backgrounds\nwere judged conspicuous.\n\nThe second step involved releasing birds into a cage containing all\nthree types of moth and both soot-blackened and lichen covered pieces\nof bark as resting places. After some difficulties (see Rudge 1998 for\ndetails), Kettlewell found that birds prey on moths in an order of\nconspicuousness similar to that gauged by human observers.\n\nThe third step was to investigate whether birds preferentially prey on\nconspicuous moths in the wild. Kettlewell used a\nmark-release-recapture experiment in both a polluted environment\n(Birmingham) and later in an unpolluted wood. He released 630 marked\nmale moths of all three types in an area near Birmingham, which\ncontained predators and natural boundaries. He then recaptured the\nmoths using two different types of trap, each containing virgin\nfemales of all three types to guard against the possibility of\npheromone differences.\n\nKettlewell found that carbonaria was twice as likely to\nsurvive in soot-darkened environments (27.5 percent) as was\ntypical (12.7 percent). He worried, however, that his results\nmight be an artifact of his experimental procedures. Perhaps the traps\nused were more attractive to one type of moth, that one form of moth\nwas more likely to migrate, or that one type of moth just lived\nlonger. He eliminated the first alternative by showing that the\nrecapture rates were the same for both types of trap. The use of\nnatural boundaries and traps placed beyond those boundaries eliminated\nthe second, and previous experiments had shown no differences in\nlongevity. Further experiments in polluted environments confirmed that\ncarbonaria was twice as likely to survive as\ntypical. An experiment in an unpolluted environment showed\nthat typical was three times as likely to survive as\ncarbonaria. Kettlewell concluded that such selection was the\ncause of the prevalence of carbonaria in polluted\nenvironments.\n\nRudge also demonstrates that the strategies used by Kettlewell are\nthose described above in the epistemology of experiment. His examples\nare given in Table 1. (For more details see Rudge 1998).\n\n\n\n\n \nEpistemological strategies\nExamples from Kettlewell \n\n1.\nExperimental checks and calibration in which the apparatus\nreproduces known phenomena.\nUse of the scoring experiment to verify that the proposed\nscoring methods would be feasible and objective. \n\n2.\nReproducing artifacts that are known in advance to be\npresent.\nAnalysis of recapture figures for endemic betularia\npopulations. \n\n3.\nElimination of plausible sources of background and alternative\nexplanations of the result.\nUse of natural barriers to minimize migration. \n\n4.\nUsing the results themselves to argue for their validity.\nFilming the birds preying on the moths. \n\n5.\nUsing an independently well-corroborated theory of the\nphenomenon to explain the results.\nUse of Ford\u2019s theory of the spread of industrial\nmelanism. \n\n6.\nUsing an apparatus based on a well- corroborated theory.\nUse of Fisher, Ford, and Shepard techniques.

Examples of epistemological\nstrategies used by experimentalists in evolutionary biology, from\nH.B.D. Kettlewell\u2019s (1955, 1956, 1958) investigations of\nindustrial melanism. (See Rudge 1998).\n\n5.2 The Meselson-Stahl Experiment: \u201cThe Most Beautiful Experiment in Biology\u201d\n\nThe roles that experiment plays in physics are also those it plays in\nbiology. In the previous section we have seen that Kettlewell\u2019s\nexperiments both test and confirm a theory. I discussed earlier a set\nof crucial experiments that decided between two competing classes of\ntheories, those that conserved parity and those that did not. In this\nsection I will discuss an experiment that decided among three\ncompeting mechanisms for the replication of DNA, the molecule now\nbelieved to be responsible for heredity. This is another crucial\nexperiment. It strongly supported one proposed mechanism and argued\nagainst the other two. (For details of this episode see Holmes\n2001.)\n\nIn 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson proposed a three-dimensional\nstructure for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Watson and Crick 1953a).\nTheir proposed structure consisted of two polynucleotide chains\nhelically wound about a common axis. This was the famous \u201cDouble\nHelix\u201d. The chains were bound together by combinations of four\nnitrogen bases \u2014 adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.\nBecause of structural requirements only the base pairs adenine-thymine\nand cytosine-guanine are allowed. Each chain is thus complementary to\nthe other. If there is an adenine base at a location in one chain\nthere is a thymine base at the same location on the other chain, and\nvice versa. The same applies to cytosine and guanine. The order of the\nbases along a chain is not, however, restricted in any way, and it is\nthe precise sequence of bases that carries the genetic\ninformation.\n\nThe significance of the proposed structure was not lost on Watson and\nCrick when they made their suggestion. They remarked, \u201cIt has\nnot escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated\nimmediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic\nmaterial.\u201d\n\nIf DNA was to play this crucial role in genetics, then there must be a\nmechanism for the replication of the molecule. Within a short period\nof time following the Watson-Crick suggestion, three different\nmechanisms for the replication of the DNA molecule were proposed\n(Delbruck and Stent 1957). These are illustrated in Figure A. The\nfirst, proposed by Gunther Stent and known as conservative\nreplication, suggested that each of the two strands of the parent DNA\nmolecule is replicated in new material. This yields a first generation\nwhich consists of the original parent DNA molecule and one\nnewly-synthesized DNA molecule. The second generation will consist of\nthe parental DNA and three new DNAs.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Possible mechanisms for DNA\nreplication. (Left) Conservative replication. Each of the two strands\nof the parent DNA is replicated to yield the unchanged parent DNA and\none newly synthesized DNA. The second generation consists of one\nparent DNA and three new DNAs. (Center) Semiconservative replication.\nEach first generation DNA molecule contains one strand of the parent\nDNA and one newly synthesized strand. The second generation consists\nof two hybrid DNAs and two new DNAs. (Right) Dispersive replication.\nThe parent chains break at intervals, and the parental segments\ncombine with new segments to form the daughter chains. The darker\nsegments are parental DNA and the lighter segments are newly\nsynthesized DNA. From Lehninger (1975).\n\n\nThe second proposed mechanism, known as semiconservative replication\nis when each strand of the parental DNA acts as a template for a\nsecond newly-synthesized complementary strand, which then combines\nwith the original strand to form a DNA molecule. This was proposed by\nWatson and Crick (1953b). The first generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules, each of which contains one strand of parental DNA and one\nnewly synthesized strand. The second generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules and two totally new DNAs. The third mechanism, proposed by\nMax Delbruck, was dispersive replication, in which the parental DNA\nchains break at intervals and the parental segments combine with new\nsegments to form the daughter strands.\n\nIn this section the experiment performed by Matthew Meselson and\nFranklin Stahl, which has been called \u201cthe most beautiful\nexperiment in biology\u201d, and which was designed to answer the\nquestion of the correct DNA replication mechanism will be discussed\n(Meselson and Stahl 1958). Meselson and Stahl described their proposed\nmethod. \u201cWe anticipated that a label which imparts to the DNA\nmolecule an increased density might permit an analysis of this\ndistribution by sedimentation techniques. To this end a method was\ndeveloped for the detection of small density differences among\nmacromolecules. By use of this method, we have observed the\ndistribution of the heavy nitrogen isotope \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) among\nmolecules of DNA following the transfer of a uniformly\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\)-labeled, exponentially growing bacterial population to\na growth medium containing the ordinary nitrogen isotope\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\)\u201d (Meselson and Stahl 1958, pp.\n671\u2013672).\n\n\n\nFigure B: Schematic representation of\nthe Meselson-Stahl experiment. From Watson (1965).\n\n\nThe experiment is described schematically in Figure B. Meselson and\nStahl placed a sample of DNA in a solution of cesium chloride. As the\nsample is rotated at high speed the denser material travels further\naway from the axis of rotation than does the less dense material. This\nresults in a solution of cesium chloride that has increasing density\nas one goes further away from the axis of rotation. The DNA reaches\nequilibrium at the position where its density equals that of the\nsolution. Meselson and Stahl grew E. coli bacteria in a\nmedium that contained ammonium chloride \\((\\ce{NH4Cl})\\) as the sole\nsource of nitrogen. They did this for media that contained either\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\), ordinary nitrogen, or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\), a heavier\nisotope. By destroying the cell membranes they could obtain samples of\nDNA which contained either \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\). They\nfirst showed that they could indeed separate the two different mass\nmolecules of DNA by centrifugation (Figure C). The separation of the\ntwo types of DNA is clear in both the photograph obtained by absorbing\nultraviolet light and in the graph showing the intensity of the\nsignal, obtained with a densitometer. In addition, the separation\nbetween the two peaks suggested that they would be able to distinguish\nan intermediate band composed of hybrid DNA from the heavy and light\nbands. These early results argued both that the experimental apparatus\nwas working properly and that all of the results obtained were\ncorrect. It is difficult to imagine either an apparatus malfunction or\na source of experimental background that could reproduce those\nresults. This is similar, although certainly not identical, to\nGalileo\u2019s observation of the moons of Jupiter or to\nMillikan\u2019s measurement of the charge of the electron. In both of\nthose episodes it was the results themselves that argued for their\ncorrectness.\n\n\n\nFigure C: The separation of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA from \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA by centrifugation. The\nband on the left is \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA and that on the right is from\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA. From Meselson and Stahl (1958).\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl then produced a sample of E coli bacteria\ncontaining only \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) by growing it in a medium containing\nonly ammonium chloride with \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) \\((\\ce{^{15}NH4Cl})\\) for\nfourteen generations. They then abruptly changed the medium to\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) by adding a tenfold excess of \\(\\ce{^{14}NH_4Cl}\\).\nSamples were taken just before the addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and at\nintervals afterward for several generations. The cell membranes were\nbroken to release the DNA into the solution and the samples were\ncentrifuged and ultraviolet absorption photographs taken. In addition,\nthe photographs were scanned with a recording densitometer. The\nresults are shown in Figure D, showing both the photographs and the\ndensitometer traces. The figure shows that one starts only with heavy\n(fully-labeled) DNA. As time proceeds one sees more and more\nhalf-labeled DNA, until at one generation time only half-labeled DNA\nis present. \u201cSubsequently only half labeled DNA and completely\nunlabeled DNA are found. When two generation times have elapsed after\nthe addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) half-labeled and unlabeled DNA are\npresent in equal amounts\u201d (p. 676). (This is exactly what the\nsemiconservative replication mechanism predicts). By four generations\nthe sample consists almost entirely of unlabeled DNA. A test of the\nconclusion that the DNA in the intermediate density band was half\nlabeled was provided by examination of a sample containing equal\namounts of generations 0 and 1.9. If the semiconservative mechanism is\ncorrect then Generation 1.9 should have approximately equal amounts of\nunlabeled and half-labeled DNA, whereas Generation 0 contains only\nfully-labeled DNA. As one can see, there are three clear density bands\nand Meselson and Stahl found that the intermediate band was centered\nat \\((50 \\pm 2)\\) percent of the difference between the\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) bands, shown in the bottom\nphotograph (Generations 0 and 4.1). This is precisely what one would\nexpect if that DNA were half labeled.\n\n\n\nFigure D: (Left) Ultraviolet absorption\nphotographs showing DNA bands from centrifugation of DNA from E.\nColi sampled at various times after the addition of an excess of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) substrates to a growing \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) culture.\n(Right) Densitometer traces of the photographs. The initial sample is\nall heavy (\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA). As time proceeds a second\nintermediate band begins to appear until at one generation all of the\nsample is of intermediate mass (Hybrid DNA). At longer times a band of\nlight DNA appears, until at 4.1 generations the sample is almost all\nlighter DNA. This is exactly what is predicted by the Watson-Crick\nsemiconservative mechanism. From Meselson and Stahl (1958)\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl stated their results as follows, \u201cThe\nnitrogen of DNA is divided equally between two subunits which remain\nintact through many generations\u2026. Following replication, each\ndaughter molecule has received one parental subunit\u201d (p.\n676).\n\nMeselson and Stahl also noted the implications of their work for\ndeciding among the proposed mechanisms for DNA replication. In a\nsection labeled \u201cThe Watson-Crick Model\u201d they noted that,\n\u201cThis [the structure of the DNA molecule] suggested to Watson\nand Crick a definite and structurally plausible hypothesis for the\nduplication of the DNA molecule. According to this idea, the two\nchains separate, exposing the hydrogen-bonding sites of the bases.\nThen, in accord with base-pairing restrictions, each chain serves as a\ntemplate for the synthesis of its complement. Accordingly, each\ndaughter molecule contains one of the parental chains paired with a\nnewly synthesized chain\u2026. The results of the present experiment\nare in exact accord with the expectations of the Watson-Crick model\nfor DNA replication\u201d (pp. 677\u2013678).\n\nIt also showed that the dispersive replication mechanism proposed by\nDelbruck, which had smaller subunits, was incorrect. \u201cSince the\napparent molecular weight of the subunits so obtained is found to be\nclose to half that of the intact molecule, it may be further concluded\nthat the subunits of the DNA molecule which are conserved at\nduplication are single, continuous structures. The scheme for DNA\nduplication proposed by Delbruck is thereby ruled out\u201d (p. 681).\nLater work by John Cairns and others showed that the subunits of DNA\nwere the entire single polynucleotide chains of the Watson-Crick model\nof DNA structure.\n\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment is a crucial experiment in biology. It\ndecided between three proposed mechanisms for the replication of DNA.\nIt supported the Watson-Crick semiconservative mechanism and\neliminated the conservative and dispersive mechanisms. It played a\nsimilar role in biology to that of the experiments that demonstrated\nthe nonconservation of parity did in physics. Thus, we have seen\nevidence that experiment plays similar roles in both biology and\nphysics and also that the same epistemological strategies are used in\nboth disciplines.\n6. Computer Simulations and Experimentation\n\nOne interesting recent development in science, and thus in the\nphilosophy of science, has been the increasing use of, and importance\nof, computer simulations. In some fields, such as high-energy physics,\nsimulations are an essential part of all experiments. It is fair to\nsay that without computer simulations these experiments would be\nimpossible. There has been a considerable literature in the philosophy\nof science discussing whether computer simulations are experiments,\ntheory, or some new kind of hybrid method of doing science. But, as\nEric Winsberg remarked, \u201cWe have in other words, rejected the\noverly conservative intuition that computer simulation is nothing but\nboring and straightforward theory application. But we have avoided\nembracing the opposite, overly grandiose intuition that simulation is\na radically new kind of knowledge production, \u201don a par\u201c\nwith experimentation. In fact, we have seen that soberly locating\nsimulation \u201don the methodological map\u201c is not a simple\nmatter (Winsberg 2010, p. 136).\u201d\n\nGiven the importance of computer simulations in science it is\nessential that we have good reasons to believe their results. Eric\nWinsberg (2010), Wendy Parker (2008) and others have shown that\nscientists use strategies quite similar to those discussed in Section\n1.1.1, to argue for the correctness of computer simulations.\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry varying views on the nature of experimental results have\nbeen presented. Some argue that the acceptance of experimental results\nis based on epistemological arguments, whereas others base acceptance\non future utility, social interests, or agreement with existing\ncommunity commitments. Everyone agrees , however, that for whatever\nreasons, a consensus is reached on experimental results. These results\nthen play many important roles in physics and we have examined several\nof these roles, although certainly not all of them. We have seen\nexperiment deciding between two competing theories, calling for a new\ntheory, confirming a theory, refuting a theory, providing evidence\nthat determined the mathematical form of a theory, and providing\nevidence for the existence of an elementary particle involved in an\naccepted theory. We have also seen that experiment has a life of its\nown, independent of theory. If, as I believe, epistemological\nprocedures provide grounds for reasonable belief in experimental\nresults, then experiment can legitimately play the roles I have\ndiscussed and can provide the basis for scientific knowledge.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Principal Works", "Other Suggested Reading"], "cat_ref_text": {"Principal Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ackermann, R., 1985. <em>Data, Instruments and Theory</em>,\nPrinceton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1991. \u201cAllan Franklin, Right or\nWrong\u201d, <em>PSA 1990</em> (Volume 2), A.
