    "main_text": "Areas of Contemporary Activity || Social Epistemology, Virtue Epistemology, and the Epistemology of Education\n3.3 Social Epistemology, Virtue Epistemology, and the Epistemology of Education\n\nRelated to the issues concerning the aims and functions of education\nand schooling rehearsed above are those involving the specifically\nepistemic aims of education and attendant issues treated by\nsocial and virtue epistemologists. (The papers collected in Kotzee\n2013 and Baehr 2016 highlight the current and growing interactions\namong social epistemologists, virtue epistemologists, and philosophers\nof education.)\n\nThere is, first, a lively debate concerning putative epistemic aims.\nAlvin Goldman argues that truth (or knowledge understood in\nthe \u201cweak\u201d sense of true belief) is the fundamental\nepistemic aim of education (Goldman 1999). Others, including the\nmajority of historically significant philosophers of education, hold\nthat critical thinking or rationality and rational\nbelief (or knowledge in the \u201cstrong\u201d sense that\nincludes justification) is the basic epistemic educational aim (Bailin\n& Siegel 2003; Scheffler 1965, 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988, 1997,\n2005, 2017). Catherine Z. Elgin (1999a,b) and Duncan Pritchard (2013,\n2016; Carter & Pritchard 2017) have independently urged that\nunderstanding is the basic aim. Pritchard\u2019s view\ncombines understanding with intellectual virtue; Jason Baehr\n(2011) systematically defends the fostering of the intellectual\nvirtues as the fundamental epistemic aim of education. This cluster of\nviews continues to engender ongoing discussion and debate. (Its\ncomplex literature is collected in Carter and Kotzee 2015, summarized\nin Siegel 2018, and helpfully analyzed in Watson 2016.)\n\nA further controversy concerns the places of testimony and\ntrust in the classroom: In what circumstances if any ought\nstudents to trust their teachers\u2019 pronouncements, and why? Here\nthe epistemology of education is informed by social epistemology,\nspecifically the epistemology of testimony; the familiar\nreductionism/anti-reductionism controversy there is applicable to\nstudents and teachers. Anti-reductionists, who regard testimony as a\nbasic source of justification, may with equanimity approve of\nstudents\u2019 taking their teachers\u2019 word at face value and\nbelieving what they say; reductionists may balk. Does teacher\ntestimony itself constitute good reason for student belief? \n\nThe correct answer here seems clearly enough to be \u201cit\ndepends\u201d. For very young children who have yet to acquire or\ndevelop the ability to subject teacher declarations to critical\nscrutiny, there seems to be little alternative to accepting what their\nteachers tell them. For older and more cognitively sophisticated\nstudents there seem to be more options: they can assess them for\nplausibility, compare them with other opinions, assess the\nteachers\u2019 proffered reasons, subject them to independent\nevaluation, etc. Regarding \u201cthe teacher says that\np\u201d as itself a good reason to believe it appears\nmoreover to contravene the widely shared conviction that an important\neducational aim is helping students to become able to evaluate\ncandidate beliefs for themselves and believe accordingly. That said,\nall sides agree that sometimes believers, including students, have\ngood reasons simply to trust what others tell them. There is thus more\nwork to do here by both social epistemologists and philosophers of\neducation (for further discussion see Goldberg 2013; Siegel 2005,\n2018).\n\nA further cluster of questions, of long-standing interest to\nphilosophers of education, concerns indoctrination: How if at\nall does it differ from legitimate teaching? Is it inevitable, and if\nso is it not always necessarily bad? First, what is it? As we saw\nearlier, extant analyses focus on the aims or\nintentions of the indoctrinator, the methods\nemployed, or the content transmitted. If the indoctrination\nis successful, all have the result that students/victims either\ndon\u2019t, won\u2019t, or can\u2019t subject the indoctrinated\nmaterial to proper epistemic evaluation. In this way it produces both\nbelief that is evidentially unsupported or contravened and uncritical\ndispositions to believe. It might seem obvious that indoctrination, so\nunderstood, is educationally undesirable. But it equally seems that\nvery young children, at least, have no alternative but to believe\nsans evidence; they have yet to acquire the dispositions to\nseek and evaluate evidence, or the abilities to recognize evidence or\nevaluate it. Thus we seem driven to the views that indoctrination is\nboth unavoidable and yet bad and to be avoided. It is not obvious how\nthis conundrum is best handled. One option is to distinguish between\nacceptable and unacceptable indoctrination. Another is to distinguish\nbetween indoctrination (which is always bad) and non-indoctrinating\nbelief inculcation, the latter being such that students are taught\nsome things without reasons (the alphabet, the numbers, how to read\nand count, etc.), but in such a way that critical evaluation of all\nsuch material (and everything else) is prized and fostered (Siegel\n1988: ch. 5). In the end the distinctions required by the two options\nmight be extensionally equivalent (Siegel 2018).\n\nEducation, it is generally granted, fosters belief: in the\ntypical propositional case, Smith teaches Jones that p, and\nif all goes well Jones learns it and comes to believe it. Education\nalso has the task of fostering open-mindedness and an\nappreciation of our fallibility: All the theorists mentioned\nthus far, especially those in the critical thinking and intellectual\nvirtue camps, urge their importance. But these two might seem at odds.\nIf Jones (fully) believes that p, can she also be open-minded\nabout it? Can she believe, for example, that earthquakes are caused by\nthe movements of tectonic plates, while also believing that perhaps\nthey aren\u2019t? This cluster of italicized notions requires careful\nhandling; it is helpfully discussed by Jonathan Adler (2002, 2003),\nwho recommends regarding the latter two as meta-attitudes concerning\none\u2019s first-order beliefs rather than lessened degrees of belief\nor commitments to those beliefs.\n\nOther traditional epistemological worries that impinge upon the\nepistemology of education concern (a) absolutism,\npluralism and relativism with respect to knowledge,\ntruth and justification as these relate to what is taught, (b) the\ncharacter and status of group epistemologies and the\nprospects for understanding such epistemic goods\n\u201cuniversalistically\u201d in the face of\n\u201cparticularist\u201d challenges, (c) the relation between\n\u201cknowledge-how\u201d and \u201cknowledge-that\u201d and their\nrespective places in the curriculum, (d) concerns raised by\nmulticulturalism and the inclusion/exclusion of marginalized\nperspectives in curriculum content and the classroom, and (e) further\nissues concerning teaching and learning.
