    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Hume spent his childhood at Ninewells, his\nfamily\u2019s modest estate in the border lowlands. He came from a\n\u201cgood family\u201d (MOL 2)\u2014socially well connected but\nnot wealthy. His father died just after David\u2019s second birthday,\nleaving him and his elder brother and sister in\n\n\nthe care of our Mother, a woman of singular Merit, who, though young\nand handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of\nher Children. (MOL 3)\n\n\nKatherine Falconer Hume realized that David was uncommonly precocious,\nso when his older brother went up to Edinburgh University, Hume went\nwith him, although he was only 10 or 11. There he studied Latin and\nGreek, read widely in history and literature, ancient and modern\nphilosophy, and also did some mathematics and natural\nphilosophy\u2014what we now call natural science.\n\nThe education David received, both at home and at the university,\naimed at training pupils to a life of virtue regulated by stern\nScottish Calvinist strictures. Prayers and sermons were prominent\naspects of his home and university life. At some point, Hume read\nThe Whole Duty of Man, a widely circulated Anglican\ndevotional tract that details our duties to God, our fellow human\nbeings, and ourselves.\n\nHume\u2019s family thought him suited for a legal career, but he\nfound the law \u201cnauseous\u201d, preferring to read classical\ntexts, especially Cicero. He decided to become a \u201cScholar and\nPhilosopher\u201d, and followed a rigorous program of reading and\nreflection for three years until \u201cthere seem\u2019d to be\nopen\u2019d up to me a new Scene of Thought\u201d (HL 3.2). The\nintensity of developing his philosophical vision precipitated a\npsychological crisis in the isolated scholar.\n\nThe crisis eventually passed, and Hume remained intent on articulating\nhis \u201cnew Scene of Thought\u201d. As a second son, his\ninheritance was meager, so he moved to France, where he could live\ncheaply, and finally settled in La Fl\u00e8che, a sleepy village in\nAnjou best known for its Jesuit college where Descartes and Mersenne\nhad studied a century before. Here he read French and other\ncontinental authors, especially Malebranche, Dubos, and Bayle, and\noccasionally baited the Jesuits with arguments attacking their\nbeliefs. By this time, Hume had not only rejected the religious\nbeliefs with which he was raised, but was also opposed to organized\nreligion in general, an opposition that remained constant throughout\nhis life. In 1734, when he was only 23, he began writing A\nTreatise of Human Nature.\n\nHume returned to England in 1737 to ready the Treatise for\nthe press. To curry favor with Joseph Butler (1692\u20131752), he\n\u201ccastrated\u201d his manuscript, deleting his controversial\ndiscussion of miracles, along with other \u201cnobler parts\u201d\n(HL 6.2). Book I, \u201cOf the Understanding\u201d, and Book II,\n\u201cOf the Passions\u201d, appeared anonymously in 1739. The next\nyear saw the publication of Book III, \u201cOf Morals\u201d, as well\nas his anonymous \u201cAbstract\u201d of Books I and II.\n\nThe Treatise was no literary sensation, but it didn\u2019t\nfall \u201cdeadborn from the press\u201d (MOL 6), as Hume\ndisappointedly described its reception. Despite his surgical\ndeletions, it attracted enough of \u201ca Murmour among the\nZealots\u201d (MOL 6) to fuel his lifelong reputation as an atheist\nand a sceptic. When he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical\n(\u201cMental\u201d) Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1745, his reputation\nprovoked vocal and ultimately successful opposition. Six years later,\nhe stood for the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, only to be turned down\nagain. Hume never held an academic post.\n\nIn 1745, he accepted a position as a young nobleman\u2019s tutor,\nonly to discover that his charge was insane. A year later he became\nsecretary to his cousin, Lieutenant General James St Clair, eventually\naccompanying him on an extended diplomatic mission in Austria and\nItaly.\n\nIn 1748, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding appeared,\ncovering the central ideas of Book I of the Treatise and his\ndiscussion of liberty and necessity from Book II. He also included\nmaterial he had excised from the Treatise. In 1751, he\npublished An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, a\n\u201crecasting\u201d of Book III of the Treatise, which he\ndescribed as \u201cincomparably the best\u201d of all his work (MOL\n10). More essays, the Political Discourses, appeared in 1752,\nand Hume\u2019s correspondence reveals that a draft of the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion was also underway at\nthis time.\n\nAn offer to serve as Librarian to the Edinburgh Faculty of Advocates\ngave Hume the opportunity to begin another project, a History of\nEngland, using the law library\u2019s excellent resources.\nPublished in six volumes between 1754 and 1762, his History\nwas a bestseller well into the next century, giving him the financial\nindependence he had long sought. But even as a librarian, Hume\u2019s\nreputation as an atheist and sceptic dogged him. One of his orders for\n\u201cindecent Books\u201d prompted an unsuccessful move for his\ndismissal and excommunication from the Kirk. Friends and publishers\npersuaded him to suppress some of his more controversial writings on\nreligion during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1763, Hume accepted a position as private secretary to the British\nAmbassador to France. During his three-year stay in Paris, he became\nSecretary to the Embassy, and eventually its charg\u00e9\nd\u2019affaires. He became the rage of the Parisian salons,\nenjoying the conversation and company of famous European\nintellectuals. He was known for his love of good food and wine, as\nwell as his enjoyment of the attentions and affections of women.\n\nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1769. He built a house in\nEdinburgh\u2019s New Town, and spent his autumnal years quietly and\ncomfortably, dining and conversing with friends, not all of whom were\n\u201cstudious and literary\u201d, for he also found that his\n\u201ccompany was not unacceptable to the young and careless\u201d\n(MOL 21). He spent considerable time revising his works for new\neditions of his Essays and Treatises, which contained his\ncollected Essays, the two Enquiries, A\nDissertation on the Passions, and The Natural History of\nReligion, but\u2014significantly\u2014not A Treatise of\nHuman Nature.\n\nIn 1775, Hume was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before his death\nin 1776, he arranged for the posthumous publication of his most\ncontroversial work, the Dialogues concerning Natural\nReligion, and composed a brief autobiography, \u201cMy Own\nLife\u201d. Although there was much curiosity about how \u201cthe\ngreat infidel\u201d would face his death, his friends agreed that he\nprepared himself with the same peaceful cheer that characterized his\nlife.\n",
