    "main_text": "Essence and Existence || The Composition of Essence and Existence\n3.3 The Composition of Essence and Existence\n\nIf distinguishing between two areas of being\u2014i.e., existence,\nwhich can be either mental or real, and the proper existence of the\nthing, i.e., its essence, quiddity, thingness (see\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 5 and VI, 2)\u2014can be read as\nlogical, its value is ontological, since the composition which is\nrecognized in things concerns their being. Indeed, not only must the\nconceptual constituents that define the being of something be\ndistinguished from the affirmation of its existence (as in\ngnoseology), but also the very essence of something must be\nmetaphysically distinguished from its existence. Essence is not, so to\nspeak, \u201contologically neutral\u201d. The essence or thingness\nof which Avicenna speaks is not simply the essence of the thing\nconsidered as such, regardless of its existence, but the thingness and\nhence the thing that, considered as such and regardless of its\nexistence, reveals exactly the character or modality that its own\nexistence has. If the analysis of a thing, i.e., of its quiddity or\nproper existence, does not inform me of its existence (by knowing what\na thing is, I do not necessarily know if it is), this is\nbecause a thing is in itself only possible: it can be either existent\nor non-existent, and since it is in itself possibly existent,\nit is in itself non-existent. On the contrary, if the\nanalysis of a thing\u2014i.e., of its quiddity or proper\nexistence\u2014were to inform me positively of its existence (by\nknowing what a thing is, I also know that it is), this would\nbe because a thing is in itself necessarily existent and therefore in\nitself existent (Lizzini 2003). Paradoxically, however, in the latter\ncase, the \u201cthing\u201d in question is only necessary existence,\nit has no quiddity (or no quiddity beyond its existence) and is not,\nproperly speaking, a \u201cthing\u201d (Bertolacci 2012a): in this\ncase, in fact, what is revealed is the existence of the Necessary\nPrinciple, which is pure existence on condition of not and\ncan therefore be conceived beyond essence and thingness.\n\nThe core of the distinction is that what is necessarily existent is\npurely existence (but not undetermined common existence) and is indeed\nthe Necessarily Existent Principle. Conversely, everything that does\nnot exist necessarily and therefore has a possible relation to\nexistence is something that is possible, so that in order to\nexist it always and necessarily refers to a cause that makes it exist:\na cause that justifies the fact that instead of being possible\n(mumkin) and therefore not already assigned to existence, the\nthing is qualified as existent. Non-determination to existence leads\nto non-existence (\u02bfadam, lays, laysa) and this is in\nfact what pertains to the thing in itself. Existence\u2014or more\nprecisely a determination of its relation to existence\u2014pertains\nto the thing because of something else (the cause). In this respect,\nnon-determination coincides with possibility, whereas determination\ncoincides with necessity per aliud. In ontology, the logical\nnotions of the possible and the necessary become the duo of what is\n\u201cnecessary in itself\u201d and what is \u201cnecessary by\nvirtue of another\u201d (Na\u01e7\u0101t: 547\u2013549;\nLizzini 2011: 116\u2013132).\n\nThe distinction between (or relation or composition of) quiddity and\nexistence is a fundamental issue of Avicenna\u2019s ontology. This\nholds too for the modal concepts that connote it in as much that\nquiddity could be said to refer to possibility, whereas existence\nwould be necessity. Although problematic (especially as regards mental\nexistence), it allows Avicenna to give an account of the so-called\n\u201contological difference\u201d between the uncaused Principle\nand the caused world: the First Principle is absolutely necessary and\nsimply coincides with, or more exactly, is Its own existence:\n\u201cthat is\u201d expresses a primary attribute of the Principle\n(all others are relations, either positive or negative:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 367, 13\u201315; cf. 4, 343,\n13\u2013344, 5; 5, 354, 12\u201314), whereas in everything else\nthere is a duality. In every thing the distinction between\nwhat the thing is and the fact that it is is\ninevitable. Existence can consequently be said to be external to\nessence, so that an existing thing, whose essence or quiddity is\npossible, can be said to be composed of essence and\nexistence. Conversely, in that which is in itself necessary there is\nno need for such a composition (there is no essence: no being\nsomething, but only being). Necessity is an affirmation or more\nprecisely a confirmation of existence (ta\u02beakkud\nal-wu\u01e7\u016bd: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 36,\n4\u20135). The idea of a distinction/composition thus has a precise\ntheological function: not only does it distinguish everything from the\nNecessary Principle (everything except the Principle is\ntwofold: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 47,\n18\u201319); it also reveals the divine creative act: everything\nexcept the Principle receives (or obtains) existence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 342, 10;\nTa\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 175, 10\u2013176, 7). The\ndistinction also explains the derivation of celestial souls and bodies\nfrom supernal intelligences: in this respect emanation is nothing but\nthe exposition of the dialectic between necessary existence and\npossible essence, which together constitute the intelligences\u2019\nbeing. This same distinction between a possible essence and its\nnecessary existence can, finally, explain any causal relationship: a\ncause is ultimately nothing but that which allows the transition from\nthe possible to the necessary, or that which makes possibility incline\ntowards necessity. Certainly, a cause may, in its turn, be possible\nand so refer to a further cause, but every causal chain leads back to\nthe First Cause, which is in Itself necessary and one\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1\u20133).\n",
