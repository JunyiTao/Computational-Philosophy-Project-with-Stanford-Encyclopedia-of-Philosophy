Definition and Preliminary Exposition\n\nDeclarative sentences seem to take truth-values, for we say things\nlike\n\n(1)\n \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d is true.\n\n\nBut sentences are apparently not the only bearers of truth-values: for\nwe also seem to allow that what such sentences express, or mean, may\nbe true or false, saying such things as\n\n(2)\n \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d means that Socrates is\n wise,[1]\n\n\nand\n\n (3)\n That Socrates is wise is true\n\n\nor\n\n (4)\n It is true that Socrates is wise.\n\n\nIf, provisionally, we call the things that declarative sentences\nexpress, or mean, their contents\u2014again provisionally,\nthese will be such things as that Socrates is wise\u2014then\nthe identity theory of truth, in its most general form, states that\n(cf. Baldwin 1991: 35):\n\n (5)\n A declarative sentence\u2019s content is true just if that\ncontent is (identical with) a fact.\n\n\nA fact is here to be thought of as, very generally, a way things\nare, or a way the world is. On this approach, the\nidentity theory secures an intimate connection between language (what\nlanguage expresses) and world. Of course there would in principle be\ntheoretical room for a view that identified not the content of, say,\nthe true declarative sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d\u2014let\nus assume from now on that this sentence is true\u2014with the fact\nthat Socrates is wise, but rather that sentence itself. But\nthis is not a version of the theory that anyone has ever advanced, nor\ndoes it appear that it would be plausible to do so (see Candlish\n1999b: 200\u20132; K\u00fcnne 2003: 6). The early Wittgenstein does\nregard sentences as being themselves facts, but they are not identical\nwith the facts that make them true.\n\nAlternatively, and using a different locution, one might say that, to\ncontinue with the same example,\n\n (6)\n That Socrates is wise is true just if that Socrates\nis wise is the case.\n\n\nThe idea here is that (6) makes a connection between language and\nreality: on the left-hand side we have something expressed by a piece\nof language, and on the right-hand side we allude to a bit of reality.\nNow (6) might look truistic, and that status has indeed been claimed\nfor the identity theory, at least in one of its manifestations. John\nMcDowell has argued that what he calls true \u201cthinkables\u201d\nare identical with facts (1996: 27\u20138, 179\u201380). Thinkables\nare things like that Socrates is wise regarded as possible\nobjects of thought. For we can think that Socrates is wise;\nand it can also be the case that Socrates is wise. So the\nidea is that what we can think can also be (identical with) what is\nthe case. That identity, McDowell claims, is truistic. On this\napproach, one might prefer one\u2019s identity theory to take the\nform (cf. Hornsby 1997: 2):\n\n(7)\n All true thinkables are (identical with) facts.\n\n\nOn this approach the identity theory explicitly aims to secure an\nintimate connection between mind (what we think) and world.\n\nA point which has perhaps been obscured in the literature on this\ntopic, but which should be noticed, is that (7) asserts a relation of\nsubordination: it says that true thinkables are a (proper or improper)\nsubset of facts; it implicitly allows that there might be facts that\nare not identical with true thinkables. So (7) is not to be confounded\nwith its converse,\n\n(8)\n All facts are (identical with) true thinkables,\n\n\nwhich asserts the opposite subordination, and says that facts are a\n(proper or improper) subset of true thinkables, implicitly allowing,\nthis time, that there might be true thinkables that are not identical\nwith facts. (8) is therefore distinct from (7), and if (7) is\ncontroversial, (8) is equally or more so, but for reasons that are at\nleast in part different. (8) denies the existence of facts that cannot\nbe grasped in thought. But many philosophers hold it to be evident\nthat there are, or at least could be, such facts\u2014perhaps certain\nfacts involving indefinable real numbers, for example, or in some\nother way going beyond the powers of human thought. So (8) could be\nfalse; its status remains to be established; it can hardly be regarded\nas truistic. Accordingly, one might expect that an identity theorist\nwho wished to affirm (7), and certainly anyone who wanted to say that\n(7) (or (6)) was truistic, would\u2014at least qua identity\ntheorist\u2014steer clear of (8), and leave its status sub\njudice. In fact, however, a good number of identity theorists,\nboth historical and contemporary, incorporate (8) as well as\u2014or\neven instead of\u2014(7) into their statement of the theory. Richard\nCartwright, who published the first modern discussion of the theory in\n1987, wrote that if one were formulating the theory, it would say\n\u201cthat every true proposition is a fact and every fact a true\nproposition\u201d (1987: 74). McDowell states that\n\n\ntrue thinkables already belong just as much to the world as to minds\n[i.e., (7)], and things that are the case already belong just as much\nto minds as to the world [i.e., (8)]. It should not even seem that we\nneed to choose a direction in which to read the claim of identity.\n(2005: 84)\n\n\nJennifer Hornsby takes the theory to state that true thinkables and\nfacts coincide (1997: 2, 9, 17, 20)\u2014they are the same\nset\u2014so that she in effect identifies that theory with the\nconjunction of (7) and (8), as also, in effect, does Julian Dodd\n(2008a: passim). Now, (8) is certainly an interesting thesis\nthat merits much more consideration than it has hitherto received (at\nleast in the recent philosophical literature), and, as indicated, some\nexpositions of the identity theory have as much invested in (8) as in\n(5) or (7): on this point see further\n \u00a72\n below. Nevertheless, it will make for clarity of discussion if we\nassociate the identity theory of truth, more narrowly, with something\nalong the lines of (5) or (7), and omit (8) from this particular\n discussion.[2]\n That will be the policy here.\n\nWhether or not (6) is truistic, both (5) and (7) involve technical or\nsemi-technical vocabulary; moreover, they have been advanced as moves\nin a technical debate, namely one concerning the viability of the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. For these reasons it seems difficult\nto regard them as truisms (see Dodd 2008a: 179). What (5) and (7)\nmean, and which of them one will prefer as one\u2019s statement of\nthe identity theory of truth, if one is favorably disposed to that\ntheory\u2014one may of course be happy with both\u2014will depend,\namong other things, on what exactly one thinks about the nature of\nsuch entities as that Socrates is wise. In order to get clear\non this point, discussion of the identity theory has naturally been\nconducted in the context of the Fregean semantical hierarchy, which\ndistinguishes between levels of language, sense, and reference. Frege\nrecognized what he called \u201cthoughts\u201d (Gedanken)\nat the level of sense corresponding to (presented by) declarative\nsentences at the level of language. McDowell\u2019s thinkables are\nmeant to be Fregean thoughts: the change of terminology is intended to\nstress the fact that these entities are not thoughts in the sense of\ndated and perhaps spatially located individual occurrences (thinking\nevents), but are abstract contents that are at least in principle\navailable to be grasped by different thinkers at different times and\nplaces. So a Fregean identity theory of truth would regard both such\nentities as that Socrates is wise and, correlatively, facts\nas sense-level entities: this kind of identity theory will then state\nthat true such entities are identical with facts. This approach will\nnaturally favor (7) as its expression of the identity theory.\n\nBy contrast with Frege, Russell abjured the level of sense and (at\nleast around 1903\u20134) recognized what, following Moore, he called\n\u201cpropositions\u201d as worldly entities composed of objects and\nproperties. A modern Russellian approach might adopt these\npropositions\u2014or something like them: the details of\nRussell\u2019s own conception are quite vague\u2014as the referents\nof declarative sentences, and identity theorists who followed this\nline might prefer to take a particular reading of (5) as their slogan.\nSo these Russellians would affirm something along the lines of:\n\n(9)\n All true Russellian propositions are identical with facts (at the\nlevel of reference),\n\n\nby contrast with the Fregean\n\n(10)\n All true Fregean thoughts are identical with facts (at the level\nof sense).\n\n\nThis way of formulating the relevant identity claims has the advantage\nof suggesting that it would, at least in principle, be open to a\ntheorist to combine (9) and (10) in a hybrid position that (i)\ndeparted from Russell and followed Frege by admitting both a\nlevel of Fregean sense and one of reference, and also, having\nadmitted both levels to the semantic hierarchy, (ii) both\nlocated Fregean thoughts at the level of sense and located\nRussellian propositions at the level of reference. Sense being mode of\npresentation of reference, the idea would be that declarative\nsentences refer, via Fregean thoughts, to Russellian\npropositions (for this disposition, see Gaskin 2006: 203\u201320;\n2008: 56\u2013127). So someone adopting this hybrid approach would\naffirm both (9) and (10). Of course, the facts mentioned in (9) would\nbe categorially different from the facts mentioned in (10),\nand one might choose to avoid confusion by distinguishing them\nterminologically, and perhaps also by privileging one set of facts,\nontologically, over the other. If one wanted to follow this\nprivileging strategy, one might say, for instance, that only\nreference-level facts were genuine facts, the relata\nof the identity relation at the level of sense being merely\nfact-like entities, not bona fide facts. That would\nbe to give the combination of (9) and (10) a Russellian spin.\nAlternatively, someone who took the hybrid line might prefer to give\nit a Fregean spin, saying that the entities with which true Fregean\nthoughts were identical were the genuine facts, and that the\ncorresponding entities at the level of reference that true Russellian\npropositions were identical with were not facts as such, but fact-like\ncorrelates of the genuine facts. Without more detail, of course, these\nprivileging strategies leave the status of the entities they are\ntreating as merely fact-like unclear; and, as far as the\nFregean version of the identity theory goes, commentators who identify\nfacts with sense-level Fregean thoughts usually, as we shall see,\nrepudiate reference-level Russellian propositions altogether, rather\nthan merely downgrading their ontological status, and so affirm (10)\nbut reject (9). We shall return to these issues in\n \u00a74\n below.\n",
