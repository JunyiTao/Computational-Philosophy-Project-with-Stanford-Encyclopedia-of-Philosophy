    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nMurdoch\u2019s family was middle class (her father was a civil\nservant) and Irish Protestant (an identity that remained important to\nMurdoch throughout her life). They moved to London from Ireland when\nMurdoch was very young. Murdoch attended Oxford University,\noverlapping with three other women\u2014Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa\nFoot, and Mary Midgley\u2014at a time (1938\u20131942) when many\nmale students were away at war. Foot, Murdoch, and Midgley all became\nprominent and influential moral philosophers, and Anscombe a prominent\nphilosopher of action and a student, friend, translator and\ninterpreter of Wittgenstein.\n\nThe four (now being referred to as the \u201cWartime Quartet\u201d\n[MacCumhaill & Wiseman 2022; Lipscomb 2021]) stayed in\ntouch after the war, and Murdoch did so with each of them\nindividually. All four pushed back against various aspects of the\nmale-dominated Oxford orthodoxy of linguistic and analytic philosophy\n(e.g., the fact/value dichotomy, the severing of ethics from an\nunderstanding of human nature, the neglect of virtue and vice), though\ntheir own philosophies differed significantly from one another.\n\nOver her lifetime Murdoch developed an entirely distinctive position\nin moral philosophy, as well as philosophy of art and religion (both\nof which she saw as important for morality). She was engaged with the\nAnglo-American moral philosophy of that period and its historical\nantecedents (such as Hobbes and Hume) but was equally engaged\nthroughout her life with traditional and some then-current\n\u201cContinental\u201d philosophy\u2014especially Schopenhauer,\nHegel, Heidegger (on whom she wrote a book, to be published in the\nnear future), Sartre, Adorno, Buber, and Derrida; with Christian\nthinkers St. Paul, St. Augustine, Anselm, Eckhart, Julian of Norwich;\nand with Hindu and especially Buddhist thought. Her views were also\nstrongly influenced by Plato, Kant, Simone Weil, and Wittgenstein, and\nshe declared herself in 1968 to be \u201ca kind of Platonist\u201d\n(Rose 1968).\n",
