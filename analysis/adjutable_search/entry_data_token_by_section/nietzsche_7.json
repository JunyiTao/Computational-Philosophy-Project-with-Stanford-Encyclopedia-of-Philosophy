    "main_text": "Key Doctrines\n6. Key Doctrines\n\nThis entry has focused on broad themes pursued throughout\nNietzsche\u2019s writing, but most philosophically sophisticated\ncommentary on his work has been devoted to the explication of certain\ncore doctrinal commitments, which Nietzsche seems to rely upon\nthroughout, but which he does not develop systematically in his\npublished works in the way typical for philosophers. Some of these\ndoctrines, like the idea of the eternal recurrence of the same, are\ndescribed as \u201cfundamental\u201d by Nietzsche himself\n(EH III, Z, 1), but are formulated in surprisingly\ncryptic or metaphorical ways\u2014and discussed, or even mentioned at\nall, much more rarely than one would expect given the importance\nNietzsche placed on them. Others are alluded to more frequently, but\nraise theoretical questions that would normally call for careful\nphilosophical development that is largely absent in Nietzsche\u2019s\nbooks. Commentators have therefore expended considerable effort\nworking out rational reconstructions of these doctrines. This section\noffers brief explanations of three of the most important: the will to\npower, the eternal recurrence, and perspectivism.\n",
