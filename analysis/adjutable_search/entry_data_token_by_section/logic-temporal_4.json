Technically, the two types of\ntemporal ontologies are closely related, and they are reducible to\neach other: on the one hand, time intervals can be defined by pairs of\ntime instants (beginning and end); on the other hand, a time instant\ncan be construed as a degenerate interval, viz. as a point-interval\nwhose beginning and end points coincide.\n\nStill, the technical reductions do not resolve the semantic question\nwhether sentences are to be evaluated with respect to instants or with\nrespect to intervals, and one may argue that both instants and\nintervals are needed as mutually complementary. Two-sorted\npoint-interval models were studied in e.g. Balbiani et al. (2011), and\nmore complex models of time have been investigated as well, including\nmodels of time granularity (Euzenat and Montanari 2005), which allow\nfor different resolution levels of temporal intervals (e.g. minutes,\nhours, days, years, etc.), metric and layered temporal models\n(Montanari 1996), etc.\n\nHere we discuss both instant-based and interval-based temporal logics.\nFor further discussion on the ontological primacy of instants versus\nintervals in temporal logics, see Hamblin (1972); Kamp (1979);\nHumberstone (1979); Galton (1996); as well as van Benthem (1983) for a\ndetailed comparative exploration of both approaches. A more\nphilosophical and historical overview is provided in e.g.\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995; 2006); Dyke and Bardon (2013);\nand Meyer (2013).\n",
