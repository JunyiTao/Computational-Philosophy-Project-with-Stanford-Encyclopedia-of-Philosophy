Epistemic Issues II: Strategies for Explaining Cell Activities Mechanistically\n\nHistorically prominent philosophers of science such as Popper and\nReichenbach rejected inquiries into how scientific theories are\ndiscovered as not philosophical (see the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Beginning with Hanson (1958), though, discovery has attracted the\ninterest of many philosophers of science. Investigations into\ndiscovery in cell biology (and related fields such as biochemistry,\nmolecular biology, and neuroscience) inspired Bechtel and Richardson\n(1993 [2010]) to argue that the goal in these fields was not to\nconstruct nomological explanation (Hempel 1965) but rather to identify\nthe mechanism responsible for a phenomenon and determine how it\nworked. Examples from cell biology have also figured prominently in\naccounts of mechanistic explanation by Machamer, Darden, and Craver\n(2000), Craver and Darden (2013), Bechtel (2006), and others (see\nGlennan & Illari, 2018, for a compendium of contemporary accounts\nof mechanisms and mechanistic explanation, and the entry\n mechanisms in science).\n The concept mechanism figures both in discussion of\nontological issues and epistemic issues, but the two uses can be\ndistinguished in the manner proposed by G. Allen (2005). In this\nsection we are concerned with what he called \u201coperative or\nexplanatory mechanism\u201d (2005: 261; the thesis that for\nexplanatory purposes components of cells should be conceived to\nfunction as if they were machines);\n Section 3\n concerned \u201cphilosophical mechanism\u201d (2005: 261; the\nontological thesis that organisms are or are constituted by\nmachines).\n\nOne of the central objectives of many philosophers of science focused\non mechanistic explanations is to characterize reasoning strategies or\nheuristics that scientists use to develop mechanistic explanations\n(Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]; Craver & Darden 2013; Gross\n2018). We discuss reasoning strategies that figure in different phases\nof developing mechanistic explanations in cell biology: delineating\nphenomena and situating them in responsible mechanisms, identifying\nand characterizing the components of mechanisms (a reductionistic\nphase), and determining the organization within mechanisms and between\nmechanisms and their contexts (a more holistic phase).\n",
