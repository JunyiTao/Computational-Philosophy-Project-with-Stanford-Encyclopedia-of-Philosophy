    "preamble": "\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775\u20131854) is, along\nwith J.G. Fichte and G.W.F. Hegel, one of the three most influential\nthinkers in the tradition of \u2018German Idealism\u2019. Although\nhe is often regarded as a philosophical Proteus who changed his\nconception so radically and so often that it is hard to attribute one\nclear philosophical conception to him, Schelling was in fact often an\nimpressively rigorous logical thinker. In the era during which\nSchelling was writing, so much was changing in philosophy that a\nstable, fixed point of view was as likely to lead to a failure to\ngrasp important new developments as it was to lead to a defensible\nphilosophical system. Schelling\u2019s continuing importance today\nrelates mainly to three aspects of his work. The first is his\nNaturphilosophie, which, although many of its empirical\nclaims are now indefensible, opens up the possibility of a modern\nhermeneutic view of nature that does not restrict nature\u2019s\nsignificance to what can be established about it in scientific terms.\nThe second is his anti-Cartesian account of subjectivity, which\nprefigures some of the most influential ideas of thinkers like\nNietzsche, Heidegger, and Jacques Lacan, in showing how the thinking\nsubject cannot be fully transparent to itself. The third is his later\ncritique of Hegelian Idealism, which influenced Kierkegaard, Marx,\nNietzsche, Heidegger, and others, and aspects of which are echoed by\nthinkers like T.W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. Schelling\u2019s focus\non humankind\u2019s relationship to nature has gained particular\nrelevance as the seriousness of the climate emergency has become fully\napparent in recent years.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Career\n\nSchelling was born in Leonberg near Stuttgart on 27 January 1775. He\nattended a Protestant seminary in T\u00fcbingen from 1790 to 1795,\nwhere he was close friends with both Hegel and the poet and\nphilosopher Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. He moved to Leipzig in 1797,\nthen to Jena, where he came into contact with the early Romantic\nthinkers, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis, and, via Goethe\u2019s\ninfluence, took up his first professorship from 1798 to 1803. From\n1803 to 1806 he lived in W\u00fcrzburg, whence he left for Munich,\nwhere he mainly lived from 1806 onwards, with an interruption from\n1820 to 1827, when he lived in Erlangen. He moved to Berlin in 1841 to\ntake up what had, until Hegel\u2019s death in 1831, been\nHegel\u2019s chair of philosophy. Although his lectures in Berlin\nwere initially attended by such luminaries as Kierkegaard, Engels,\nBakunin, Ranke, Burkhardt, and Alexander von Humboldt, he soon came to\nbe largely ignored by most of the leading thinkers of the day. It is\nclear, however, that his philosophical thought still influenced many\nwho rejected him on mainly political grounds. He died on 20 August\n1854 in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland. Schelling\u2019s influence on many\ndirections in modern philosophy has been seriously underestimated in\nthe English-speaking world, though sustained new attention to his work\nin recent years has increasingly brought him into contemporary debates\nabout naturalism, freedom, aesthetics, epistemology, and ontology.\n2. Transcendental Philosophy and Naturphilosophie\n\nThe significance of the work of the early Schelling (1795\u20131800)\nlies in its attempts to give a new account of nature which, while\ntaking account of the fact that Kant had irrevocably changed the\nstatus of nature in modern philosophy, avoids some of the consequences\nof Kant\u2019s theory that were seen as problematic by Kant\u2019s\ncontemporaries and successors. For the Kant of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1781, 1787) nature is largely seen in the\n\u2018formal\u2019 sense, as that which is subject to necessary\nlaws. These laws are accessible to us, Kant argues, because cognition\ndepends on the subject bringing forms of thought, the categories, to\nbear on what it perceives. The problem this leads to is how the\nsubject could fit into a nature conceived of in deterministic terms,\ngiven that the subject\u2019s ability to know is dependent upon its\n\u2018spontaneous\u2019 self-caused ability to judge in terms of the\ncategories. Kant\u2019s response to this dilemma is to split the\n\u2018sensuous\u2019 realm of nature as law-bound appearance from\nthe \u2018intelligible\u2019 realm of the subject\u2019s cognitive\nand ethical self-determination. However, if the subject is part of\nnature there would seem to be no way of explaining how a nature which\nwe can only know as deterministic can give rise to a subject\nwhich seems to transcend determinism in its knowing and in its\nself-determined actions. Kant himself sought to bridge the realms of\nnecessity and spontaneity in the Critique of Judgement\n(1790), by suggesting that nature itself could be seen in more than\nformal terms: it also produces self-determining organisms and gives\nrise to disinterested aesthetic pleasure in the subject that\ncontemplates its forms. The essential problems remained, however, that\n(1) Kant gave no account of the genesis of the subject that transcends\nits status as a piece of determined nature, and (2) such an account\nwould have to be able to bridge the divide between nature and\nfreedom.\n\nThe tensions in Schelling\u2019s philosophy of this period, which set\nthe agenda for most of his subsequent work, derive, then, from the\nneed to overcome the perceived lack in Kant\u2019s philosophy of a\nsubstantial account of how nature and freedom come to co-exist. Two\nways out of Kantian dualism immediately suggested themselves to\nthinkers in the 1780s and 90s. On the one hand, Kant\u2019s arguments\nabout the division between appearances and things in themselves, which\ngave rise to the problem of how something \u2018in itself\u2019\ncould give rise to appearances for the subject, might be overcome by\nrejecting the notion of the thing in itself altogether. If what we\nknow of the object is the product of the spontaneity of the I, an\nIdealist could argue that the whole of the world\u2019s\nintelligibility is therefore the result of the activity of the\nsubject, and that a new account of subjectivity is required which\nwould achieve what Kant had failed to achieve. On the other hand, the\nfact that nature gives rise to self-determining subjectivity would\nseem to suggest that a monist account of a nature which was more than\na concatenation of laws, and was in some sense inherently\n\u2018subjective\u2019, would offer a different way of accounting\nfor what Kant\u2019s conception did not provide. Schelling seeks\nanswers to the Kantian problems in terms that relate to both these\nconceptions. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the conceptions are\nin one sense potentially identical: if the essence of nature is that\nit produces the subjectivity which enables it to understand itself,\nnature itself could be construed as a kind of\n\u2018super-subject\u2019. The main thinkers whose work is regarded\nas exemplifying these alternatives are J.G. Fichte, and Spinoza.\n\nThe source of Schelling\u2019s concern with Spinoza is the\n\u2018Pantheism controversy\u2019, which brought Spinoza\u2019s\nmonism into the mainstream of German philosophy. In 1783 the writer\nand philosopher F.H. Jacobi became involved in an influential dispute\nwith the Berlin Enlightenment philosopher Moses Mendelssohn over the\nclaim that G.E. Lessing had admitted to being a Spinozist, an\nadmission which at that time was tantamount to the admission of\natheism, with all the dangerous political and other consequences that\nentailed. In his On the Doctrine of Spinoza in Letters to Herr\nMoses Mendelssohn, (1785, second edition 1789), which was\ninfluenced by his reading of Kant\u2019s first Critique,\nJacobi revealed a problem which would recur in differing ways\nthroughout Schelling\u2019s work. Jacobi\u2019s interpretation of\nSpinozism was concerned with the relationship between the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019 and the \u2018conditioned\u2019, between\nGod as the ground of which the laws of nature are the consequent, and\nthe linked chains of the deterministic laws of nature. Cognitive\nexplanation relies, as Kant claimed, upon finding a thing\u2019s\n\u2018condition\u2019. Jacobi\u2019s question is how finding a\nthing\u2019s condition can finally ground its explanation, given that\neach explanation leads to a regress in which each condition depends\nupon another condition ad infinitum. Any philosophical system\nthat would ground the explanation of a part of nature thus\n\u201cnecessarily ends by having to discover conditions of\nthe unconditioned\u201d (Scholz, ed., 1916, p. 51). For\nJacobi this led to the need for a theological leap of faith, as the\nworld\u2019s intelligibility otherwise threatened to become a mere\nillusion, in which nothing would be finally grounded at all. In the\n1787 Introduction to the first Critique Kant maintains this\nproblem of cognitive grounding can be overcome by acknowledging that,\nwhile reason must postulate the \u201cunconditioned (\u2026) in all\nthings in themselves for everything conditioned, so that the series of\nconditions should thus become complete\u201d (Kant, Critique of\nPure Reason B, p. XX), by restricting knowledge to appearances,\nrather than assuming it to be of \u201cthings in themselves\u201d,\nthe contradiction of seeking conditions of the unconditioned can be\navoided. As we have already seen, though, this gives rise precisely to\nthe problem of how a subject which is not conditioned like the nature\nit comes to know can emerge as the ground of knowledge from\ndeterministic nature.\n\nThe condition of the knowledge of appearances for Kant is the\n\u2018transcendental subject\u2019, but what sort of\n\u2018condition\u2019 is the transcendental subject? The perception\nthat Kant has no proper answer to this problem initially unites\nSchelling and Fichte. Fichte insists in the\nWissenschaftslehre (1794) that the unconditioned status of\nthe I has to be established if Kant\u2019s system is to legitimate\nitself. He asserts that \u201cIt is (\u2026) the ground of\nexplanation of all facts of empirical consciousness that before all\npositing in the I the I itself must previously be posited\u201d\n(Fichte 1971, p. 95), thereby giving the I the founding role which he\nthought Kant had failed adequately to explicate. Fichte does this by\nextending the consequences of Kant\u2019s claim that the cognitive\nactivity of the I, via which it can reflect upon itself,\ncannot be understood as part of the causal world of appearances, and\nmust therefore be part of the noumenal realm, the realm of the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. For Fichte the very existence of\nphilosophy depends upon the free act of the I which initiates the\nreflection on its own activity by the I.\n\nSchelling takes up the issues raised by Jacobi and Fichte in two texts\nof 1795: Of the I as Principle of Philosophy or on the\nUnconditional in Human Knowledge, and Philosophical Letters\non Dogmatism and Criticism. In a move which prefigures aspects of\nHeidegger\u2019s questioning of the notion of being, he reinterprets\nKant\u2019s question as to the condition of possibility of synthetic\njudgements a priori as a question about why there is a realm of\njudgements, a manifest world requiring syntheses by the subject for\nknowledge to be produced, at all. In Of the I, Schelling puts\nKant\u2019s question in Fichtean terms: \u201chow is it that the\nabsolute I goes out of itself and opposes a Not-I to itself?\u201d\n(S\u00e4mmtliche Werke [SW], I/1, p. 175).\nHe maintains that the condition of knowledge, the\n\u2018positing\u2019 by the I of that which is opposed to it, must\nhave a different status from the determined realm which it posits:\n\u201cnothing can be posited by itself as a thing, i.e. an\nabsolute/unconditioned thing (unbedingtes Ding) is a\ncontradiction\u201d (ibid., p. 116). However, his key worry\nabout Fichte\u2019s position already becomes apparent in the\nPhilosophical Letters, where he drops the Fichtean\nterminology: \u201cHow is it that I step at all out of the\nabsolute and move towards something opposed (auf ein\nEntgegengesetztes)?\u201d (ibid., p. 294). The problem\nSchelling confronts was identified by his friend H\u00f6lderlin, in\nthe light of Jacobi\u2019s formulation of the problem of the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. Fichte wished to understand the absolute\nas an I in order to avoid the problem of nature \u2018in\nitself\u2019 which creates Kantian dualism. For something to be an I,\nthough, it must be conscious of an other, and thus in a relationship\nto that other. The overall structure of the relationship could not,\ntherefore, be described from only one side of that relationship.\nH\u00f6lderlin argued that one has to understand the structure of the\nrelationship of subject to object in consciousness as grounded in\n\u2018a whole of which subject and object are the parts\u2019, which\nhe termed \u2018being\u2019. This idea will be vital to Schelling at\nvarious times in his philosophy.\n\nIn the 1790s, then, Schelling is seeking a way of coming to terms with\nthe ground of the subject\u2019s relationship to the object world.\nHis aim is to avoid the fatalist consequences of Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem by taking on key aspects of Kant\u2019s and Fichte\u2019s\ntranscendental philosophy, and yet not to fall into the trap\nH\u00f6lderlin identified in Fichte\u2019s conception of an absolute\nI. In his Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature), which\nemerges in 1797 and develops in the succeeding years, and in the\nSystem of Transcendental Idealism of 1800, Schelling wavers\nbetween a Spinozist and a Fichtean approach to the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. In the Naturphilosophie the\nKantian division between nature as appearance and nature in itself is\nseen as resulting from the fact that the nature theorised in cognitive\njudgements is objectified in opposition to the knowing subject. This\nobjectification, the result of the natural sciences\u2019 search for\nfixed laws, fails to account for the living dynamic forces in nature,\nincluding those in our own organism, with which Kant himself became\nconcerned in the third Critique and other late work, and\nwhich had played a role in Leibniz\u2019s account of nature. Nature\nin itself is thought of by Schelling as a \u2018productivity\u2019:\n\u201cAs the object [qua \u2018conditioned\ncondition\u2019] is never absolute/unconditioned (unbedingt)\nthen something per se non-objective must be posited in nature; this\nabsolutely non-objective postulate is precisely the original\nproductivity of nature\u201d (SW I/3, p. 284). The Kantian dualism\nbetween things in themselves and appearances is a result of the fact\nthat the productivity can never appear as itself and can only appear\nin the form of \u2018products\u2019, which are the productivity\n\u2018inhibiting\u2019 itself. The products are never complete in\nthemselves: they are like the eddies in a stream, which temporarily\nkeep their shape via the resistance of the movement of the fluid to\nitself that creates them, despite the changing material flowing\nthrough them.\n\nSchelling next tries to use the insights of transcendental philosophy,\nwhile still avoiding Kant\u2019s dualism, to explain our knowledge of\nnature. The vital point is that things in themselves and\n\u2018representations\u2019 cannot be absolutely different because\nwe know a world which exists independently of our will, which can yet\nbe affected by our will:\n\none can push as many transitory materials as one wants, which become\nfiner and finer, between mind and matter, but sometime the point must\ncome where mind and matter are One, or where the great leap that we so\nlong wished to avoid becomes inevitable. (SW I/2, p. 53)\n\n\nThe Naturphilosophie includes ourselves within nature, as\npart of an interrelated whole, which is structured in an ascending\nseries of \u2018potentials\u2019 that contain a polar opposition\nwithin themselves. The model is a magnet, whose opposing poles are\ninseparable from each other, even though they are opposites. As\nproductivity nature cannot be conceived of as an object, since it is\nthe subject of all possible real \u2018predicates\u2019, of the\n\u2018eddies\u2019 of which transient, objective nature consists.\nHowever, nature\u2019s \u2018inhibiting\u2019 itself in order to\nbecome something determinate means that the \u2018principle of all\nexplanation of nature\u2019 is \u2018universal duality\u2019, an\ninherent difference of subject and object which prevents nature ever\nfinally reaching stasis (SW I/3, p. 277). At the same time this\ndifference of subject and object must be grounded in an identity which\nlinks them together, otherwise all the problems of dualism would just\nreappear. In a decisive move for German Idealism, Schelling parallels\nthe idea of nature as the producing subject with the spontaneity of\nthe thinking subject, which is the condition of the syntheses required\nfor the constitution of objectivity. The problem for Schelling lies in\nexplicating how these two \u2018subjects\u2019 relate to each\nother.\n\nIn the System of Transcendental Idealism Schelling goes back\nto Fichtean terminology, though he will soon abandon most of it. He\nendeavours to explain the emergence of the thinking subject from\nnature in terms of an \u2018absolute I\u2019 coming retrospectively\nto know itself in a \u2018history of self-consciousness\u2019 that\nforms the material of the system. The System recounts the\nhistory of which the transcendental subject is the result. A version\nof the model Schelling establishes will be adopted by Hegel in the\nPhenomenology of Mind. Schelling presents the process in\nterms of the initially undivided I splitting itself in order to\narticulate itself in the syntheses, the \u2018products\u2019, which\nconstitute the world of knowable nature. The founding stages of this\nprocess, which bring the world of material nature into being, are\n\u2018unconscious\u2019. These stages then lead to organic nature,\nand thence to consciousness and self-consciousness. Schelling claims,\nin the wake of Fichte, that the resistance of the noumenal realm to\ntheoretical knowledge results from the fact that \u201cthe\n[practical] act [of the absolute I] via which all limitation is\nposited, as condition of all consciousness, does not itself come to\nconsciousness\u201d (SW I/3, p. 409). He prophetically attempts to\narticulate a theory which comes to terms with the idea that thought is\ndriven by forces which are not finally transparent to it, of the kind\nlater to become familiar in psychoanalysis. How, though, does one gain\naccess by thought to what cannot be an object of consciousness? This\naccess is crucial to the whole project because without it there can be\nno understanding of why the move from determined nature to the freedom\nof self-determining thinking takes place at all.\n\nSchelling adopts the idea from the early Romantic thinkers Friedrich\nSchlegel and Novalis, whom he knew in Jena at this time, that art is\nthe route to an understanding of what cannot appear as an object of\nknowledge. Philosophy cannot represent nature in itself because access\nto the unconscious must be via what appears to consciousness in the\nrealm of theoretical knowledge. The work of art is evidently an\nempirical, appearing object like any other, but if it is not more than\nwhat it is qua determinable object it cannot be a work of\nart, because this requires both the free judgement of the subject and\nthe object\u2019s conveying of something beyond its objective nature.\nAlthough the System\u2019s own very existence depends upon\nthe transition from theoretical to practical philosophy, which\nrequires the breaking-off of Jacobi\u2019s chain of\n\u2018conditions\u2019 by something unconditioned, Schelling is\nconcerned to understand how the highest insight must be into reality\nas a product of the interrelation of both the \u2018conscious\u2019\nand the \u2018unconscious\u2019. Reality is not, therefore,\nessentially captured by a re-presentation of the objective by the\nsubjective. Whereas in the System nature begins unconsciously\nand ends in conscious philosophical and scientific knowledge, in the\nart work: \u201cthe I is conscious according to the production,\nunconscious with regard to the product\u201d (SW I/3, p. 613). The\nproduct cannot be understood via the intentions of its producer, as\nthis would mean that it became a \u2018conditioned\u2019 object,\nsomething produced in terms of a pre-existing rule, and would\ntherefore lack what makes mere craft into art. Art is, then,\n\u201cthe only true and eternal organ and document of philosophy,\nwhich always and continuously documents what philosophy cannot\nrepresent externally\u201d (ibid., p. 627). The particular\nsciences can only follow the chain of conditions, via the principle of\nsufficient reason, and must determine any object via its place in that\nchain, a process which has no necessary end. The art object, on the\nother hand, manifests what cannot be understood in terms of its\nknowable conditions, because an account of the materials of which it\nis made or of its status as object in the world does not constitute it\nas art. Art shows what cannot be said. Philosophy cannot positively\nrepresent the absolute because \u2018conscious\u2019 thinking\noperates from the position where the \u2018absolute identity\u2019\nof the subjective and the objective has always already been lost in\nthe emergence of consciousness.\n\nAlthough Schelling\u2019s early work did not fully satisfy either\nhimself, or anybody else, it manages to address, in a cogent and\nilluminating fashion, many topics which affect subsequent philosophy.\nThe model presented in the System impresses not least\nbecause, at the same time as establishing the notion of the history of\nself-consciousness that would be decisive for Hegel, it offers, in a\nmanner which goes beyond its sources in Fichte, a model of the\nrelationship between the subject and its conceptually inaccessible\nmotivating forces which would affect thinkers from Schopenhauer, to\nNietzsche, to Freud, and beyond.\n3. Identity Philosophy\n\nAlthough the period of Schelling\u2019s \u2018identity\nphilosophy\u2019 is usually dated from the 1801 Presentation of\nMy System of Philosophy until sometime before the 1809 On the\nEssence of Human Freedom, the project of that philosophy can be\nsaid to be carried on in differing ways throughout his work. The\nidentity philosophy derives from Schelling\u2019s conviction that the\nself-conscious I must be seen as a result, rather than as the\noriginating act it is in Fichte, and thus that the I cannot be seen as\nthe generative matrix of the whole system. This takes him more in the\ndirection of Spinoza, but the problem is still that of articulating\nthe relationship between the I and the world of nature, without either\nreverting to Kantian dualism or failing to explain how a purely\nobjective nature could give rise to subjectivity.\n\nSchelling\u2019s mature identity philosophy, which is contained in\nthe System of the Whole of Philosophy and of Naturphilosophie in\nParticular, written in W\u00fcrzburg in 1804, and in other texts\nbetween 1804 and 1807, breaks with the model of truth as\ncorrespondence. It does so because:\n\nIt is clear that in every explanation of the truth as a correspondence\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) of subjectivity and objectivity in\nknowledge, both, subject and object, are already presupposed as\nseparate, for only what is different can agree, what is not different\nis in itself one. (SW I/6, p. 138)\n\n\nThe crucial problem is how to explain the link between the\nsubject and object world that makes judgements possible, and this\ncannot be achieved in terms of how a subject can have thoughts which\ncorrespond to an object essentially separate from it. For there to be\njudgements at all what is split and then synthesised in the judgement\nmust, Schelling contends, in some way already be the same. This has\noften been understood as leading Schelling to a philosophy in which,\nas Hegel puts it in the Phenomenology, the absolute is the\n\u2018night in which all cows are black\u2019, because it swallows\nall differentiated knowledge in the assertion that everything is\nultimately the same, namely an absolute which excludes all relativity\nfrom itself and thus becomes inarticulable. This is not a valid\ninterpretation of Schelling\u2019s argument. In an early version of\nthe identity philosophy he had said the following:\n\nFor most people see in the essence of the Absolute nothing but pure\nnight and cannot recognise anything in it; it shrinks before them into\na mere negation of difference, and is for them something purely\nprivative, whence they cleverly make it into the end of their\nphilosophy (\u2026) I want to show here (\u2026) how that night of\nthe Absolute can be turned into day for knowledge (SW I/4, p. 403).\n\n\nIn order to try to get over the problem in monism of how the One is\nalso the many, Schelling, following the idea outlined above from\nH\u00f6lderlin, introduces a notion of \u2018transitive\u2019 being,\nwhich links mind and matter as predicates of itself. Schelling\nexplains this \u2018transitivity\u2019 via the metaphor of the\nearth:\n\nyou recognise its [the earth\u2019s] true essence only in the link by\nwhich it eternally posits its unity as the multiplicity of its things\nand again posits this multiplicity as its unity. You also do not\nimagine that, apart from this infinity of things which are in it,\nthere is another earth which is the unity of these things, rather\nthe same which is the multiplicity is also unity, and\nwhat the unity is, is also the multiplicity, and this\nnecessary and indissoluble One of unity and multiplicity in it is what\nyou call its existence (\u2026) Existence is the link of a being\n(Wesen) as One, with itself as a multiplicity. (SW I/7, p.\n56)\n\n\n\u2018Absolute identity\u2019 is, then, the link of the two\naspects of being, which, on the one hand, is the universe,\nand, on the other, is the changing multiplicity which the\nknowable universe also is. Schelling insists now that \u201cThe\nI think, I am, is, since Descartes, the basic\nmistake of all knowledge; thinking is not my thinking, and being is\nnot my being, for everything is only of God or the totality\u201d (SW\nI/7, p. 148), so the I is \u2018affirmed\u2019 as a predicate of the\nbeing by which it is preceded. In consequence he already begins to\nmove away, albeit inconsistently, from the German Idealist model in\nwhich the intelligibility of being is regarded as a result of its\nhaving an essentially mind-like structure.\n\nSchelling is led to this view by his understanding of the changing and\nrelative status of theoretical knowledge. It is the inherent\nincompleteness of all finite determinations which reveals the nature\nof the absolute. His description of time makes clear what he means:\n\u201ctime is itself nothing but the totality appearing in\nopposition to the particular life of things\u201d, so that the\ntotality \u201cposits or intuits itself, by not positing, not\nintuiting the particular\u201d (SW I/6, p. 220). The particular is\ndetermined in judgements, but the truth of claims about the totality\ncannot be proven because judgements are necessarily conditioned,\nwhereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the\nparticular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be\naware of that relativity, and this ground must have a\ndifferent status from the knowable world of finite particulars. At the\nsame time, if the ground were wholly different from the world of\nrelative particulars the problems of dualism would recur. As such the\nabsolute is the finite, but we do not know this in\nthe manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of\n\u2018absolute identity\u2019, therefore, the evident relativity of\nparticular knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no\nreason to claim that a revised judgement is predicated of the same\nworld as the preceding \u2014 now false \u2014 judgement.\n\nSchelling summarises his theory of identity as follows:\n\nfor being, actual, real being is precisely self-disclosure/revelation\n(Selbstoffenbarung). If it is to be as One then it must\ndisclose/reveal itself in itself; but it does not disclose/reveal\nitself in itself if it is not an other in itself, and is in\nthis other the One for itself, thus if it is not absolutely the living\nlink of itself and an other. (SW I/7, p. 54)\n\n\nThe link between the \u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018ideal\u2019\ncannot be regarded as a causal link. Although there cannot be mental\nevents without physical events, the former cannot be reduced to being\nthe causal results of the latter: \u201cFor real and ideal are only\ndifferent views of one and the same substance\u201d (SW I/6, p. 501).\nSchelling wavers at this time between a \u2018reflexive\u2019\nposition of the kind which Hegel will soon try to articulate, in\nwhich, in Schelling\u2019s terms, \u201cthe sameness of the\nsubjective and the objective is made the same as itself, knows itself,\nand is the subject and object of itself\u201d (SW I/6, p. 173), in\nthe \u2018identity of identity and difference\u2019, and the sense\nthat this position cannot finally circumscribe the structure of the\nabsolute. The structure of reflection, where each aspect reflects\nitself and then is reflected in the other, upon which this account of\nthe identity of subject and object relies, must be grounded in a being\nwhich carries it:\n\nreflection (\u2026) only knows the universal and the particular as\ntwo relative negations, the universal as relative negation of the\nparticular, which is, as such, without reality, the particular, on the\nother hand, as a relative negation of the universal. (\u2026)\nsomething independent of the concept must be added to posit the\nsubstance as such. (SW I/6, p. 185)\n\n\nWithout this independent basis subject and object would merely be, as\nSchelling thinks they are in Fichte, relative negations of each other,\nleading to a circle \u201cinside which a nothing gains reality by the\nrelation to another nothing\u201d (SW I/4, p. 358). Schelling\nprophetically distinguishes between the cognitive \u2014 reflexive\n\u2014 ground of finite knowledge and the real \u2014 non-reflexive\n\u2014 ground that sustains the movement of negation from one finite\ndetermination to another. As a two-sided relationship reflection alone\nalways entails the problem that the subject and the object in a case\nof reflection can only be known to be the same via that which\ncannot appear in the reflection. If I am to recognise myself\nas myself in a mirror, rather than see a random object in the\nworld, I must already be familiar with myself before\nthe reflection, in a way which is not part of the reflection. This\nmeans a complete system based on reflection is impossible, because, in\norder for the system to be grounded, it must presuppose as external to\nitself what it claims is part of itself. Schelling will, in his\nphilosophy from the 1820s onwards, raise versions of this objection\nagainst Hegel\u2019s system.\n\nSchelling\u2019s own dissatisfaction with his early versions of\nidentity theory derives from his rejection of Spinozism. Spinoza\nregards the move from God to the world of \u2018conditions\u2019 as\na logical consequence of the nature of God. Schelling becomes\nconvinced that such a theory gives no reason why the absolute, the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019, should manifest itself in a world of\nnegative \u2018conditions\u2019 at all. Schelling is therefore\nconfronted with explaining why there is a transition from the absolute\nto the finite world, a finite world which he comes to see increasingly\nin terms of the suffering and tragedy it has to involve. In\nPhilosophy and Religion, of 1804, he claims, like Jacobi,\nthat there is no way of mediating between conditioned and\nunconditioned, and already makes the distinction between\n\u2018negative\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 philosophy, which\nwill form the heart of his late work. Explicating the structure of the\nfinite world leads to \u201cnegative philosophy, but much has already\nbeen gained by the fact that the negative, the realm of nothingness,\nhas been separated by a sharp limit from the realm of reality and of\nwhat alone is positive\u201d (SW I/6, p. 43). The question which\ncomes to concern Schelling is how philosophy can come to terms with a\nground which cannot be regarded as the rational explanation of the\nfinite world, because the finite world involves so much that makes no\nrational sense.\n4. The \u2018Ages of the World\u2019\n\nSchelling\u2019s work from his middle period (1809\u20131827) is\nusually referred to as the philosophy of the Ages of the\nWorld (WA = Weltalter), after the title\nof the unfinished work of that name he worked on in the period\n1809\u20131827. The work characteristic of this period begins with\nthe 1809 On the Essence of Human Freedom (FS\n= Freiheitsschrift) (written in Stuttgart). The WA philosophy\nis an attempt to explain the emergence of an intelligible world at the\nsame time as coming to terms with mind\u2019s inextricable relation\nto matter. The initial concern is to avoid Spinoza\u2019s fatalism,\nwhich he thinks renders the human freedom to do good and evil\nincomprehensible. Schelling\u2019s crucial objection is to the idea\nthat evil should be understood as merely another form of negativity\nwhich can be comprehended by insight into the inherent lack in all\nfinite parts of a totality, rather than as a positive fact relating to\nthe nature of human freedom. He now sees the fundamental\ncontradictions of the Naturphilosophie in terms of the\nrelationship of the intelligibility of nature and ourselves to a\nground without which there could be no intelligibility, but which is\nnot the explicable cause of intelligibility. In an attempt to get to\ngrips with the problem of the ground of the finite world Schelling\nintroduces a Kant-derived conception of \u2018willing\u2019 in the\nFS which will be influential for Schopenhauer\u2019s conception of\nthe Will: \u201cIn the last and highest instance there is no other\nbeing but willing. Willing is primal being, and all the predicates of\nprimal being only fit willing: groundlessness, eternity, being\nindependent of time, self-affirmation\u201d (SW I/7, p. 350).\nSchelling now establishes a more conflictual version of the structure\nof the identity philosophy. The \u2018ground\u2019 is\n\u2018groundless\u2019 \u2014 in the sense of\n\u2018uncaused\u2019 \u2014 and it must be understood in terms of\nfreedom if a Spinozist determinism is to be avoided. This means there\ncannot be an explanation of why there is the finite world, because\nthat would entail taking the ground as a cause and thus rendering\nfreedom non-existent.\n\nAt the same time Schelling insists there must be that against which\nfreedom can be manifest \u2014 a being which is not free and is\ntherefore necessitated \u2014 for it to be meaningful freedom at all.\nThe theory is based on the antagonisms between opposing forces which\nconstitute the \u2018ages of the world\u2019, the past, present, and\nfuture. He argues that the world whose origins the WA wishes to\nunderstand must entail the same conflicting forces which\nstill act, though not necessarily in the same form, in this\nworld, of which the mind is an aspect: \u201cPoured from the source\nof things and the same as the source, the human soul has a\nco-knowledge/con-science (Mitwissenschaft) of creation\u201d\n(WA, p. 4). Schelling suggests that there are two principles in us:\n\u201can unconscious, dark principle and a conscious\nprinciple\u201d, which must yet in some way be identical. The same\nstructure applies to what Schelling means by \u2018God\u2019. At\nthis point his account of the ground is not consistent, but this\ninconsistency points to the essential issue Schelling is trying to\nunderstand, namely whether philosophy can give a rational account of\nthe fact of the manifest world. As that which makes the world\nintelligible, God relates to the ground in such a way that the\n\u2018real\u2019, which takes the form of material nature, is\n\u2018in God\u2019 but \u201cis not God seen absolutely, i.e.\ninsofar as He exists; for it is only the ground of His existence, it\nis nature in God; an essence which is inseparable from God,\nbut different from Him\u201d (SW I/7, p. 358). The point is that God\nwould be just be some kind of inarticulable, static One if there were\nnot that which He transcends: without opposition, Schelling argues,\nthere is no life and no sense of development, which are the highest\naspects of reality. The aim of the move away from Spinoza is to avoid\nthe sense of a world complete in itself which would render freedom\nillusory because freedom\u2019s goal would already be determined as\nthe goal of the totality. Schelling starts to confront the idea that\nthe rational reconciliation of freedom and necessity that had been\nsought by Kant in the acknowledgement of the necessity of the law, and\nwhich was the aim of German Idealism\u2019s attempt to reconcile mind\nand nature, might be intrinsically unattainable.\n\nWolfram Hogrebe has claimed that the WA philosophy is an ontological\ntheory of predication. Being, as initially One and enclosed within\nitself, is not manifest, and has no reason to be manifest. Hogrebe\nterms this \u2018pronominal being\u2019. The same being\nmust also, given that there is now a manifest world, be\n\u2018predicative being\u2019, which \u201cflows out, spreads,\ngives itself\u201d (SW I/8, p. 210\u2013211). The contradiction\nbetween the two kinds of being is only apparent. Schelling maintains,\nin line with the identity philosophy, that the \u201cproperly\nunderstood law of contradiction really only says that the same cannot\nbe as the same something and also the opposite thereof, but\nthis does not prevent the same, which is A, being able, as an other,\nto be not A\u201d (SW I/8, p. 213\u20134). One aspect of being, the\ndark force, which he sometimes terms \u2018gravity\u2019, is\ncontractive, the other expansive, which he terms \u2018light\u2019.\nDynamic processes are the result of the interchange between these\nultimately identical forces. If they were wholly separate there would\neither be no manifest universe, because contraction would dominate, or\nthe universe would dissipate at infinite speed because expansion would\ndominate. The result would be the same: there would not be a world. If\nsomething is to be as something it must both be, in the\npositive sense in which everything else is, which makes it\nindeterminately positive, pronominal, and it must have a relationship\nto what it is not, in order to be determinate, which brings it into\nthe realm of predication by taking it beyond itself. In the WA the One\ncomes into contradiction with itself and the two forces constantly vie\nwith each other. Differences must, however, be grounded in unity, as\notherwise they could not be manifest at all as differences.\nThe ground is now increasingly regarded as the source of the\ntransitory nature of everything particular, and less and less as the\nsource of tranquil insight into how we can be reconciled to finite\nexistence. The mood of the WA is summed up in Schelling\u2019s\nreference to the \u201cveil of melancholy which is spread over the\nwhole of nature, the deep indestructible melancholy of all life\u201d\n(SW I/7, p. 399). The source of this melancholy is that everything\nfinite must \u2018go to ground\u2019 and that we are aware\nof this. Awareness thus both makes sense of things and yet is also\nwhat is underpinned by a negativity it must constantly seek to come to\nterms with.\n\nThe abandonment of his residual Spinozism leads Schelling to a growing\nconcern with the tensions which result from contradictions that are\nalso embodied in human beings. The ages of the world are constituted\nby the development of forms and structures in the material and the\nmental world. This development depends upon the expanding\nforce\u2019s interaction with the contracting force\u2019s slowing\nof any expansion, which allows transient but determinate forms to\ndevelop. This process also gives rise to language, which Schelling\nregards as the model for the development of the whole world because it\nmanifests how expansion and the release of tension can lead to\nintelligibility, rather than mere dissipation:\n\nIt seems universal that every creature which cannot contain itself or\ndraw itself together in its own fullness, draws itself together\noutside itself, whence e.g. the elevated miracle of the formation of\nthe word in the mouth belongs, which is a true creation of the full\ninside when it can no longer remain in itself. (WA I, p. 56\u20137)\n\n\nLanguage as \u2018contracted\u2019 material signifier, and\n\u2018expanding\u2019 ideal meaning repeats the basic structure of\nthe WA, and Schelling insists that, like the material world without\nthe \u2018ideal\u2019 capacity for expansion, language can become\n\u2018congealed\u2019. This interaction between what is contained in\nitself and what draws something beyond itself is also what gives rise\nto consciousness, and thus to an inherent tension within\nconsciousness, which can only be itself by its relation to an other.\nHegel uses a related model of subjectivity, but Schelling will come to\nreject Hegel\u2019s model for its failure to confront the ultimately\nirresolvable tension in all subjectivity. Schelling\u2019s later\nphilosophy will present a subject whose origin prevents it from ever\nachieving the \u2018self-presence\u2019 that Hegel tries to\nexplicate by setting out the complete structure of\n\u2018self-reflection\u2019 in the other. Schelling\u2019s WA\nphilosophy is never completed: its Idealist aim of systematically\nunifying subject and object by comprehending the real development of\nhistory from the very origins of being founders on problems concerning\nthe relationship between philosophical system and historical\ncontingency which do not admit of solutions. Furthermore, the\nstructures he develops lead him to ideas which take him beyond\nIdealism and make him one of the crucial precursors of existential and\nother non-Idealist forms of modern philosophy.\n5. Positive and Negative Philosophy, and the Critique of Hegel\n\nSchelling has often been understood as providing the transitional\n\u2018objective idealist\u2019 link between Fichte and Hegel. By\nregarding Hegel\u2019s system as the culmination of German Idealism\nthis interpretation fails to do justice to Schelling\u2019s real\nphilosophical ambitions. Many of these insights, particularly in the\nlater philosophy (1827\u20131854), directly and indirectly influenced\nthe ideas of thinkers, like Feuerbach, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,\nHeidegger, and Adorno, who were critical of Hegel\u2019s claim to\narticulate a complete philosophical system.\n\nThe differences between Hegel and Schelling derive from their\nrespective approaches to understanding the absolute. For Hegel the\nabsolute is the result of the self-cancellation of everything\nfinite, whose mode of being is precisely to change into something\ndifferent. Philosophy can therefore articulate the nature of the\nabsolute by an account of how finite determinations are always\ntranscended. This takes the form of the \u2018negation of the\nnegation\u2019, in a system whose end comprehends its beginning. For\nHegel the result becomes known when the beginning negates itself as\nbeing \u2018in itself\u2019 to becomes being \u2018for\nitself\u2019 at the end of the system, thus in a process in which it\nreflects itself to itself by becoming other to itself. Schelling\nalready becomes publicly critical of Hegel while working on a later\nversion of the WA philosophy in Erlangen in the 1820s, but makes his\ncriticisms fully public in lectures given in Munich in the 1830s, and\nin the 1840s and 1850s as professor in Berlin. The aim of the Idealist\nsystems was for thought to reflect what it is not \u2014 being\n\u2014 as really itself, even as it appears not to be itself, thereby\navoiding Kant\u2019s dualism. The issue between Schelling and Hegel\nis whether the grounding of reason by itself is not in fact a sort of\nphilosophical narcissism, in which reason admires its reflection in\nbeing without being able fully to articulate its relationship to that\nreflection. Like Hegel, Schelling argues that it is not the particular\nmanifestation of knowledge which tells me the truth about the world,\nbut rather the necessity of moving from one piece of knowledge to the\nnext. However, a logical reconstruction of the process of knowledge\ncan, for Schelling, only be a reflection of thought by itself. The\nreal process cannot be described in philosophy, because the cognitive\nground of knowledge and the real ground, although they are inseparable\nfrom each other, cannot be shown to reflect each other.\n\nDieter Henrich characterises Hegel\u2019s conception of the absolute\nas follows: \u201cThe absolute is the finite to the extent to which\nthe finite is nothing at all but negative relation to itself\u201d\n(Henrich 1982, p. 82). Hegel\u2019s system depends upon showing how\neach particular way of conceiving of the world has an internal\ncontradiction. This necessarily leads thought to more comprehensive\nways of grasping the world, until the point where there can be no more\ncomprehensive way because there is no longer any contradiction to give\nrise to it. The very fact of the finite limitations of empirical\nthought therefore becomes what gives rise to the infinite, which, in\nHegel\u2019s terms, is thought that is bounded by itself and by\nnothing else.\n\nSchelling accepts such a conception, to which he substantially\ncontributed in his early philosophy, as the way to construct a\n\u2018negative\u2019 system of philosophy, because it explains the\nlogic of change, once there is a world to be explained. The conception\ndoes not, though, explain why there is a developing world at all, but\nmerely reconstructs in thought the necessary structure of development\non the basis of necessities in thought. Schelling\u2019s own attempt\nat explaining the world\u2019s ontological and historical facticity\nwill lead him to a \u2018philosophical theology\u2019 which traces\nthe development of mythology and then of Christian revelation in his\nPhilosophy of Mythology and Philosophy of\nRevelation, which, like all his substantial works after 1811, are\nnot published in his lifetime. The failure of his philosophical\ntheology does not, though, necessarily invalidate his philosophical\narguments against Hegel. His alternative to the \u201ccommon mistake\nof every philosophy that has existed up to now\u201d \u2014 the\n\u201cmerely logical relationship of God to the world\u201d\n(System der Weltalter, p. 57) \u2014 Schelling terms\n\u2018positive philosophy\u2019. The \u2018merely logical\nrelationship\u2019 entails a reflexivity, in which the world\nnecessarily follows from the nature of God, and God and the world are\ntherefore the \u2018other of themselves\u2019. Hegel\u2019s system\ntries to obviate the facticity of the world by understanding reason as\nthe world\u2019s immanent self-articulation. Schelling, in contrast,\ninsists that human reason cannot explain its own existence,\nand therefore cannot encompass itself and its other within a system of\nphilosophy. We cannot, he maintains, make sense of the manifest world\nby beginning with reason, but must instead begin with the contingency\nof being and try to make sense of it with the reason which is only one\naspect of it and which cannot be explained in terms of its being a\nrepresentation of the true nature of being.\n\nSchelling contends that the identity of thought and being cannot be\narticulated within thought, because thought must\npresuppose that they are identical in a way which thought, as\none side of a relation, cannot comprehend. By redefining the\n\u2018concept\u2019 in such a way that it is always already both\nsubject and object, Hegel aims to avoid any presuppositions on either\nthe subject or the object side, allowing the system to complete itself\nas the \u2018self-determination of the concept\u2019. Schelling\npresents the basic alternative as follows:\n\nFor either the concept would have to go first, and being would have to\nbe the consequence of the concept, which would mean it was no longer\nabsolute being; or the concept is the consequence of being, then we\nmust begin with being without the concept. (SW II/3, p. 164)\n\n\nHegel attempts to merge concept and being by making being part of a\nstructure of self-reflection, rather than the basis of the\ninterrelation between subject and object. In Schelling\u2019s terms,\nHegel therefore invalidly assumes that \u2018essence\u2019, what we\nknow of things, which is one side of the relationship between being\nand essence, can articulate its identity with the other side in the\n\u2018concept\u2019, because the other side is revealed as being\n\u2018nothing\u2019 until it has entered into a relationship which\nmakes it determinate as a knowable moment of the whole process. For\nHegel, on the other hand, Schelling has to invoke being as something\nimmediate: this means it must be wholly opaque, and so is equivalent\nto nothing.\n\nThe problem which Hegel does not overcome is that the identity of\nessence and being cannot be known, because, as Schelling\nclaims of his concept of being, \u201cexisting is not here the\nconsequence of the concept or of essence, but rather existence is here\nitself the concept and itself the essence\u201d (SW II/3, p. 167).\nThe problem of reflection cannot be overcome in Hegel\u2019s manner:\nidentifying one\u2019s reflection in a mirror as oneself (understood\nnow as a metaphor for essence) entails, as we saw above, a prior\nnon-reflexive moment if one is to know that the reflection is\noneself, rather than a random reflected object. How far Schelling\nmoves from any reflexive version of identity philosophy is evident in\nthe following from the Introduction to the Philosophy of\nRevelation or Foundation of the Positive Philosophy of\n1842\u20133:\n\nour self-consciousness is not at all the consciousness of that nature\nwhich has passed through everything, it is precisely just our\nconsciousness (\u2026) for the consciousness of man is not = the\nconsciousness of nature (\u2026) Far from man and his activity\nmaking the world comprehensible, man himself is that which is most\nincomprehensible. (SW II/3, p. 5\u20137)\n\n\nSchelling refuses to allow that reason can confirm its status via its\nreflection in being:\n\nwhat we call the world, which is so completely contingent\nboth as a whole and in its parts, cannot possibly be the impression of\nsomething which has arisen by the necessity of reason\n(\u2026) it contains a preponderant mass of\nunreason. (Grundlegung der positiven Philosophie, p.\n99)\n\n\nThe contemporary ramifications of the debate between Schelling and\nHegel have been given new significance by the continuing elaboration\nof \u2018non-metaphysical\u2019 readings of Hegel by Robert Pippin\nand others. If Hegel is really the philosopher who insists that\nlegitimation can only be in terms of the account we can give of how we\ncame to adopt the forms of legitimation of our society, there being no\nextra-mundane perspective on these forms, how far is he from\nSchelling\u2019s moves against rationalist metaphysics in his later\nphilosophy? The difference between Hegel and Schelling seems here to\nlie above all in Schelling\u2019s insistence that one cannot reduce\nthe ways in which we face up to the terrors and irrationality of\nexistence to what can be achieved by a philosophical system that makes\nsense of negativity by showing it has a rational basis. His attention\nto art and the unconscious in his early philosophy already suggests\nthis direction in his later thinking.\n\nSchelling is one of the first philosophers seriously to begin the\ncritique of the model of metaphysics based on the idea of true\nrepresentation, a critique which can be seen as one of the key aspects\nof modern philosophy from Heidegger to the later Wittgenstein and\nbeyond. He is, at the same time, unlike some of his successors,\ncommitted to an account of human reason which does not assume that\nreason\u2019s incapacity to ground itself should lead to an\nabandonment of rationality or the reduction to reason to the exercise\nof power, in the manner of Nietzsche. This is one of the respects in\nwhich Schelling has again become part of contemporary philosophical\ndebate, where the need to seek means of legitimation which do not rely\non the notion of a rationality inherent in the world remains a major\nchallenge. Above all, Schelling\u2019s account of mind and world,\nparticularly his insistence on the need not to limit our conception of\nnature to what can be objectified by scientific methods, is, in the\nlight of the ecological crisis, proving to be more durable than his\nreception might until recently have suggested. The question Schelling\nstill poses is how the capacity for expanding human knowledge and\ncontrol of nature can be reconciled with sustainable ways of\ninhabiting that nature.\n6. The Schelling Revival\n\nPhilosophical responses to Schelling in the German-speaking world\nduring the post-War era form a fairly continuous tradition, with\nperhaps the main innovations being Frank 1975 and Schulz 1975, which\nshift some of the focus of research towards his late philosophy and\nthe critique of Hegel. In the English-speaking world, in contrast, a\nwider reception of Schelling only really got underway in the 1990s.\nThis was manifested in a considerable increase in the number of books\nand articles on, and translations of Schelling, and in the foundation\nof the American Schelling Society. The decisive shift here was the\nclaim that, rather than being, as he largely had been in Anglophone\nphilosophy, a stage on the path from Kant, via Fichte, to Hegel,\nSchelling actually opens up aspects of modern philosophy which are\nindependent of Hegelianism, and can challenge Hegel\u2019s systematic\nphilosophy (Bowie 1993). As Bowie showed, Schelling can therefore be\nbrought into productive connection with a range of philosophers, like\nHeidegger, Derrida, and others who have been influential in debates\nabout the nature and aims of modern philosophy. The ensuing reception\nof Schelling was given a boost by Zizek (1997), which shows how\nSchelling\u2019s philosophy relates closely to aspects of Lacan that\nform the focus of Zizek\u2019s previous work on Hegel. Since then the\ngrowing Schelling reception has taken divergent paths, which reflect\nthe perennially contested nature of Schelling interpretation. This\nreception involves some paradigmatic differences, of the kind that\nensue from conflicting ways of approaching texts from the history of\nphilosophy, from historicist reconstruction, to using the texts to\nquestion prevailing contemporary positions in philosophy in the way\nthe Anglophone reception of Hegel by Brandom, McDowell, Pippin, and\nothers has done. These differing approaches have offered new\nperspectives on the theological and other sources of Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy, detailed historical and philosophical analysis of the\nfiner detail of work from differing periods, Schelling\u2019s role in\nthe genesis of psychoanalysis (see, particularly, Ffytche (2012),\nwhich gives an exemplary historical, philosophical, and psychological\naccount of the issue), and competing claims as to what constitutes the\nessence of Schellingian philosophy.\n\nThe bibliography below gives an indication of the basic content of\nsome of the books that have appeared as part of the Schelling revival.\nThe tensions between the approaches in these books both point to key\nissues in the understanding of Schelling\u2019s philosophy, and\ninvolve difficulties that are inseparable from engagement with the\nhistory of philosophy. The attempt to interpret philosophy from the\npast demands an adequate reconstruction of the way philosophical\nissues were constituted in the era of the philosopher in question, on\nthe assumption that philosophy, in various ways, is constituted\ndialogically. Schelling\u2019s relationship to Kant and Fichte\nsuggests what is at issue here, and raises the further issue that how\nKant and Fichte themselves are interpreted repeats the same problem.\nAt the same time, if Schelling is to be seen as contributing to our\ncontemporary philosophical understanding, such contextual\nreconstruction can get in the way of interpretations which build\ncritically on his work with a view to using it to illuminate the\npresent. Examples of such issues are examined below in relation to\nsome characteristic recent contributions to the Schelling\nliterature.\n\nSome of Schelling\u2019s most important philosophical concerns relate\nto the modern understanding of nature, which is, of course, dominated\nby unparalleled advances in the natural sciences. One of the reasons\nSchelling came to be neglected was in part because his conception of\nnature in the Naturphilosophie was seen as being overtaken by\nthose sciences. The revival of interest in Schelling relates not least\nto the realisation that what is now seen in terms of the ecological\ncrisis can be interpreted in ways which suggest the kind of\nalternative conception of humankind\u2019s relationship to nature\nparadigmatically present in Schelling\u2019s objection to Fichte:\n\u2018in the last analysis what is the essence of his whole opinion\nof nature? It is this: that nature should be used [\u2026] and that\nit is there for nothing more than to be used; his principle, according\nto which he looks at nature, is the economic teleological\nprinciple\u2019 (SW I/7 p. 17). Jason Wirth argues that the\nindustrialised world\u2019s likely leading to the sixth Great\nExtinction event \u2018opens a space to appreciate the radicality of\nSchelling\u2019s ethical and ontological efforts to respond to the\npositivism and anthropocentrism at the heart of the ecological\ncrisis\u2019 (Wirth 2015: xv). He does so on the assumption that\n\u2018the basic case for Schelling\u2019s intrinsic interest and\ncontemporary relevance has been made (xi), so that we can move beyond\n\u2018explication\u2019 to \u2018develop the fundamental issues at\nstake in his thought\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nThe danger here is that such development can lead to wide-ranging\nclaims for Schelling that don\u2019t always take adequate account of\nother approaches to the issues. How far is Schelling\u2019s\n\u2018retrieval of the question of nature\u2019 (6) dependent on\nprecisely those aspects of his Naturphilosophie which came to\nbe widely rejected, and how can that philosophy be interpreted so that\nthe reasons for that rejection are overcome? Whether it can be\njustified by metaphysical argument or not, seeing nature in\nKant\u2019s \u2018formal\u2019 sense as a \u2018system of\nnecessary laws\u2019 is a plausible way of characterising one key\nassumption on which the investigations of the modern sciences are\nbased. If that were all that is to be said about nature, there would\nbe no point in trying to revive Schelling\u2019s undoubtedly fruitful\nviews on nature as a \u2018productivity\u2019, but neither can\nSchelling\u2019s conception be used as a wholesale alternative that\nsomehow obviates the \u2018formal\u2019 sense of nature.\n\nWirth maintains \u2018Schelling\u2019s nature from the perspective\nof its own living or wild ground \u2013 is no longer\nsurrounding us as a place in which are located. We are the\nearth\u2019s bio-regions\u2019 (22). Hamilton Grant (2005) can be\nseen as seeking to cash in such a claim: \u2018it is an argument of\nthis book, as it was of Schelling\u2019s, that metaphysics cannot be\npursued in isolation from physics. To do so entails the reconstruction\nnot only of Schelling\u2019s naturephilosophy, therefore, but the\nrepairing of the context from which it begins\u2019 (2005: 8).\nHamilton Grant provides a wealth of instructive historical detail from\nthat context, but then infers from it that \u2018the enemy in all\nthis is all post-Cartesian European philosophy\u2019s elimination of\nthe concept, even the existence, of nature, a deficiency common\nequally to Kant and the postkantians\u2019 (viii). It seems, though,\nhard to square this kind of totalising claim with aspects, especially\nof the early Marx and the Frankfurt School, for example, who were\ndirectly and indirectly influenced by Schelling.\n\nAny analysis of the issues here must take account of their relation to\nthe effects of political economy on how nature comes to be understood,\notherwise the philosophical perspective can actually obscure key\naspects of the issue of nature in modernity. There are evidently\nimportant issues here, and both Wirth and Hamilton Grant offer\ninteresting philosophical and historical perspectives on aspects of\nthem, but they do so at the risk of making claims that rely on a\nlimited, exclusively philosophical perspective: \u2018the present\nwork asserts firstly that Schellingianism is resurgent every time\nphilosophy reaches beyond the Kant-inspired critique of\nmetaphysics, its subjectivist-epistemological transcendentalism, and\nits isolation of physics from metaphysics\u2019 (5), and this\nentails \u2018the systematic undoing of the critical\nrevolution\u2019 (6). It perhaps makes more sense, however, to\nsuggest that a resurgence of \u2018Schellingianism\u2019, in the\nsense of radical questioning of humankind\u2019s relationship both to\ninternal and external nature, comes about when the concrete forms of\nthat relationship, as they do in the contemporary ecological crisis,\nresult in real historical breakdown. Whether a metaphysical account\nbuilding on Schelling\u2019s idea of nature as productivity rather\nthan product, or on the primacy of being before reflection can do more\nthan add to an already existing concrete historical\nrevelation of the blindness of certain influential forms of philosophy\nto alternative views of nature depends on how one now sees the tasks\nof philosophy in the face of that breakdown.\n\nFurther difficulties in the reception of Schelling relate to claims\nabout what the real core of his philosophy is, and these are\ncompounded by the fact that he changed the emphasis, if not\nnecessarily the underlying core, of his philosophy quite radically\nthroughout his career. It might be argued that, rather than seeking to\nlocate Schelling in a framework that is supposed to constitute the\nessence of his philosophy, one should use his explorations of nature,\nfreedom, language, theology, existence, etc., where they are most\nfruitful in relation to both historical and contemporary issues.\nWhistler (2013) and Matthews (2011) both make claims regarding the\ncore of Schelling\u2019s thinking, and thereby, while offering much\nscholarly and historical insight, and detailed attempts to explicate\nsome of Schelling\u2019s more intractable texts, can also obscure\nsome dimensions of that thinking. Both Whistler and Matthews attend\nalmost exclusively to Schelling\u2019s earlier\nNaturphilosophie and identity-philosophy.\n\nWhistler claims his \u2018book is, [\u2026], an attempt to\nreconstruct Schelling\u2019s philosophy of the time, the\nIdentita\u0308tssystem, by means of a focus on the role the\nsymbol plays therein\u2019 (Whistler 2012: vi). The book\u2019s\nvalue lies in its cogent and extensive reconstruction and\ninterpretation of some of the detail of that system, which has not\nbeen attempted before in English. However, this leads to claims like\nthe following, that in the Identita\u0308tssystem: \u2018an\nabsolute system is engendered which has no concern for reference or\nfor the integrity of particular scientific pursuits\u2019 (vii). This\nclaim depends not least on an admittedly sophisticated account of a\nsmall part of Schelling\u2019s Philosophy of Art on the\nnature of language as \u2018symbol\u2019 in a specific sense, which\nsees language as \u2018producing\u2019 its object, rather than as a\nform of representation of a pre-existing world. Language is here\nessentially performative, as in such things as promises, vows, etc.:\n\u2018Referential language talks about reality more or less\naccurately; productive language is reality more or less\nintensely\u2019 (208), so that \u2018Meaning is performed in and as\nbeing; it is thus wholly immanent to, and ultimately identical with,\nbeing\u2019 (201). The ultimate aim of this is to arrive at a new\nkind of theology: \u2018In short, theology must be poietic, not\nreferential \u2014 produce God, not refer to him (210).\n\nThere is much to be said for seeing language, in Charles\nTaylor\u2019s terms, as both \u2018constitutive\u2019\n(poietic), and \u2018designative\u2019 (referential), as the\ntradition from Hamann to Heidegger suggests. It is, though, hard to\nmake sense of a conception that seems so cavalier about how language\nis also changed by scientific activity that can invalidate previous\nways of talking about things. It is noticeable that such problems\narise when the goal of a Schelling interpretation is essentially\ntheological. Moreover, concentrating mainly on the early Schelling\nomits other dimensions of his view of language that can either\ncomplement or contradict what ensues from the ideas of the identity\nphilosophy. The later Schelling, for example, asserts: \u2018One is\nalmost tempted to say: language itself is only faded mythology, in it\nis preserved in only abstract and formal differences what mythology\npreserves in still living and concrete differences\u2019 (SW II/1 p.\n52). This sustains the idea of poiesis, but opens up different issues\nwith regard to language\u2019s relation to philosophy and\ntheology.\n\nMatthews also concentrates on the earlier Schelling from a perspective\nwhere theology plays a major role, revealing informative connections\nof the young Schelling\u2019s philosophy to Pietists such as\nFriedrich Christoph Oetinger and Phillip Matth\u00e4us Hahn, and\noffering discussions of how Schelling moves away from Kant. However,\nthe dangers of a theological interpretation of Schelling are already\napparent in Matthews\u2019 agenda: \u2018The speculative thesis of\nthis work is that there exists in the work of Schelling a possible\nschema for a new configuration of unity and freedom capable of\novercoming the destructive void of contemporary philosophy\u2019\n(Matthews 2011: 27). This supposedly new configuration involves:\n\u2018the realization of nature in its sacred status as the deity\nexternalized, the spirit of the divine made flesh\u2019 (30). What is\nat issue is supposed to be manifest in the experience of art that\ntranscends the \u2018static categories of the understanding\u2019\n(22): \u2018it is precisely this experience, this sublime realization\nof the oneness of our natures, which overcomes our alienation and\nredeems us, making us whole again with our nature\u2019 (34). These\nrather grandiose claims may have made some sense during the period of\nthe early Schelling, but invocation of \u2018a telos that requires\nhumans to act and order their lives so as to best express the harmony\nof the universe\u2019 (69) seems to ignore the subsequent\ndevelopments of modernity in science and technology, which manifests\nanything but the \u2018harmony of the universe\u2019.\n\nUsing theologically based interpretation of philosophy from the past\nwhile seeking to circumvent the political, social, and scientific\nexperience of the modern era too easily suggests avoidance rather than\nconfrontation of the contradictions of that era. Such an approach can\nreally only invoke Schelling if one keeps to his early work, and it is\nnotable that Matthews\u2019s does not mention the effects of Jacobi\nand the early Romantics even on the early Schelling\u2019s project,\nwhich make it hard to think of Schelling solely in terms of a\ntheological harmony. The claim that the early Schelling involves the\nidea that \u2018our way of thinking does, in this regard, actually\nmanifest the structure of nature\u2019 (183) also ignores\nSchelling\u2019s later existential claims, like the following:\n\u2018our self-consciousness is not at all the consciousness of that\nnature which has passed through everything, it is precisely just\nour consciousness \u2026 for the consciousness of man is\nnot = the consciousness of nature\u2026. Far from man and his\nactivity making the world comprehensible, man himself is that which is\nmost incomprehensible (SW II/3 pp. 5\u20137). If even Schelling\nhimself comes to question a theologically directed harmonisation of\nhumankind\u2019s relationship to the world, it seems questionable to\nconstruct an account of Schelling based wholly on the idea of such\nharmonisation.\n\nMcGrath (2021) also takes a predominantly theological approach, but\nthis time in an extensive and informative examination of\nSchelling\u2019s late philosophy: \u2018What is ultimately at stake\nin the Schelling\u2013Hegel dispute, then \u2013 and this is still\nnot sufficiently recognised by the new generation of scholars of\nGerman idealism \u2013 is the philosophical interpretation of\nChristianity, or as I will put it in this work, the interpretation of\nthe end of Christianity\u2019 (McGrath 2021: 6). The essential\ntension in philosophical interpretation of Schelling McGrath points to\nis suggested when he cites Markus Gabriel\u2019s deflationary\nunderstanding of \u2018God\u2019 in Schelling: \u2018For Schelling,\nit is crucial to note that \u201cGod\u201d refers to nothing more or\nless than the incessant and polymorphous becoming of intelligibility.\nGod is sense, the almost trivial fact that the ways we access the\nworld (our sense-making practices, which generate fields of sense)\nbelong to the world itself\u2019 (Gabriel 2015: 82). McGrath, in\ncontrast, talks in terms of: \u2018An absolute future when pantheism\nwill be real, when God will actually be everything, without\nany diminishment of the reality of individual things, the eventfulness\nof time or the freedom of the human being \u2013 this is the\nmaster-thought of the late Schelling\u2019 (McGrath 2021: 65).\n\nThere can be no philosophical argument that could substantiate such a\nvision, and this suggests where the philosophy/theology division\nbecomes decisive in Schelling interpretation. McGrath has to rely on\nfaith: \u2018By a theology of revelation I mean a theology which\nassumes, not blind fidelity to authoritatively pronounced\npropositions, but an ordinary intellect \u201cillumined\u201d by\nfaith\u2019 (11). This leads, rather as it does in Matthews, to some\nfairly grandiose claims: \u2018I mean to outline, elaborate and\nevaluate the logical, moral and existential arguments Schelling offers\nus for assuming revelation as an explanation for nature, the human\nsituation and history\u2019 (14), and \u2018Schelling is proposing\nthat the New Testament should be taken as offering us knowledge of\nultimate things, knowledge that can and should be appropriated by\nphilosophy in a post-Kantian register\u2019 (30). One\u2019s\nresponse to this will depend very much on one\u2019s relationship to\ntheology, but interpretations like the following can make one wary of\ntrying to actualise Schelling\u2019s philosophy from a theological\nperspective: \u2018Justice and a flourishing human civilisation will\nonly be achieved via a universal experience of the redeeming God\n\u2013 this is the social-political upshot of the Philosophy of\nRevelation\u2019 (240). The undeniable virtues of McGrath\u2019s\nbook lie in the wealth of detailed exploration of Schelling\u2019s\nlater texts, in his investigation of the distinction between negative\nand positive philosophy and its relationship to the critique of Hegel,\nand in his clarification of the idea of a \u2018philosophical\nreligion\u2019 that is to be achieved via positive philosophy:\n\u2018positive philosophy is the experience of the\neventfulness of history, the disclosure, which can only be empirical,\nof meaningful history\u2019 (50\u20131).\n\nWhat the recent philosophical and theological takes on Schelling can\nbe said to share is their insistence on his widening the scope of\n\u2018meaning\u2019 beyond a semantic view, to include all the ways\nin which the world is disclosed to us. Gabriel focuses on the\nPhilosophy of Mythology, and he sets himself an essentially\nphilosophical agenda in which it is read as a \u2018combination of\nthree approaches, an ontotheological, an anthropological, and one\nbased on the history of self-consciousness\u2019 (Gabriel 2006: 6),\nsuch that \u2018One can see in Schelling\u2019s thinking the attempt\nto shift the anthropological component of cognition into the centre of\nthe founding of metaphysics\u2019 (23). His \u2018concept of the\nhistory of religion as the history of self-consciousness is\nconstitutive for the whole of the Philosophy of Mythology\u2019 (52).\nWhereas modern natural scientific understanding sees meaning in terms\nof semantic relations between language and a world of physical\nobjects: \u2018Mythological consciousness [\u2026] does not\nexclusively inhabit a world of meaning, but rather a\nworld of meaningfulness\u2019 (31). Schelling therefore, in\na manner that is echoed in certain respects by Heidegger, \u2018seeks\nto oppose modern [scientistic] consciousness via the proof that it\narose from mythological consciousness\u2019 (31).\n\nAs such, what differentiates Schelling\u2019s \u2018history of\nself-consciousness\u2019 from Hegel\u2019s is that from his early\nphilosophy onwards \u2018the last thing for Schelling is always the\nadmission that self-consciousness comes up against a ground that\nprecedes it which it has itself not posited\u2019 (472\u20133). In\nthe System of Transcendental Idealism this is what leads to\nart being the culmination of the system, and, in the late philosophy,\nreligion as \u2018the reference (re-ligio) of consciousness to a\nbeing that is not posited by itself\u2019 (473). Although\nSchelling\u2019s late philosophy seeks to sustain the idea of a\npositive philosophy as \u2018a never completable proof of God\u2019\n(474), what remains most significant for contemporary understanding\nthat no longer thinks in theological terms is that \u2018our\nexistence is always accompanied by an ineliminable contingency or\nfacticity which corresponds to the fact that the world itself\nis groundless, even though its contents are necessarily connected to\neach other\u2019 (475\u20136). One way of seeing this, as suggested\nby Bowie (2022), is to focus on the enduring ways in which, as the\nearly Schelling and the early Romantics proposed, aesthetic questions\ncan show limitations in modern philosophy whose predominant focus is\nepistemological.\n\nSchelling was for a long time seen as a figure of the past. The\ncontributors to the Schelling revival all in some respects seek to\nrevive him for contemporary philosophy, which, as we have seen, can\nlead to perhaps rather grandiose claims. Such approaches do, though,\noffer challenges to some dominant ways of doing philosophy, but can at\ntimes risk excluding Schelling from more mainstream debate. Frank, as\nhas Gabriel both in the book just discussed and in other work, has\nshown that it is possible to interpret Schelling in ways which\ndirectly affect almost any approach to philosophy, be it\nEuropean/Continental, or analytic. Frank has recently done so by\nconsidering Schelling\u2019s explications, which he returns to in\nvarious ways throughout his career, of the \u2018identity of nature\nand spirit/mind [Geist]\u2019 (Frank 2018: X). His\nconclusion is that \u2018Schelling has shown the way out of a\nthousands of years old spiritualistic philosophy of the subject that\nis hostile to nature, and brought nature to the same level as\nspirit/mind\u2019 (269). This might also sound suspiciously\ngrandiose, but Frank both refers in detail to contextual historical\nsources that have been largely forgotten or neglected, and presents\nlogical and metaphysical reasons for taking Schelling\u2019s\nexplorations of identity seriously with respect to contemporary\ndebates concerning physicalism, reductive naturalism, and the\nlike.\n\nThe core idea here is that the very philosophical difficulties still\nencountered with respect to notions of \u2018identity\u2019 may\nactually themselves be an indication of something important,\nespecially with respect to the relationship between mind and nature.\nOne sense of identity leads, as Leibniz suggested, to the idea that\nthings are only ever strictly identical with themselves, which\nprecludes saying anything that differentiates a thing as something at\nall; the other sense of identity raises the problem that if things are\nto be identified \u2013 knowledge being otherwise impossible \u2013\nthey must differ from themselves in some sense, which seems\nparadoxical. Schelling therefore thinks that \u2018both sameness\n(\u2018Einfachheit\u2019) and difference \u2013 thus something like\nself-differentiation \u2013 have to be assumed in the thought of\nidentity\u2019 (109).\n\nFrank traces the history of the notion of \u2018reduplicative\nidentity\u2019 and its adoption by Schelling to explicate what makes\nthis idea plausible. This leads to the following: \u2018For identity\nis after all a symmetrical relationship [\u2026] For this reason it\nis meaningless to call an identity theory more\n\u201cidealist/mentalist\u201d than \u201cmaterialist\u201d. It is\nneither of the two and both at once, as Schelling so neatly puts\nit\u2019 (224). The basic position is summed up as follows:\n\n\u2018Spirit/mind and nature are One\u2019 is understood as: There\nis an X, and this X is on the one hand A (spirit/mind), and on the\nother B (nature). B as B is not \u2018the same\u2019\n(\u2018einerlei\u2019) as A; and A as A is not the same as\nB. The identity of the two rests on their\nbeing-equally-sustained-in-being by X (or absolute being) (211).\n\n\nIn the terms of contemporary philosophical debate: \u2018Types of\nmental and types of neuronal states are not in themselves \u2013 or\nnot metaphysically \u2013 different (namely not to the extent which\nthey are sustained by X. They are only different from a conceptual (or\nepistemological) perspective\u2019 (232). In such a relation of\nidentity \u2018two different but equally rigid designations\u2019\nare involved, \u2018each of which could be sufficient to adequately\ndetermine the object and which both apply to the same thing (X)\u2019\n(252\u20133). Identity of nature and spirit therefore \u2018appears\n(as opposed to logical freedom from contradiction) to include in it a\nkind of difference\u2019 (251).\n\nThis position can be seen as avoiding both the kind of questionable\nbracketing of modern natural science seen in some of the\nmetaphysical/theological accounts considered above, and the kind of\nreductive physicalism and scientism that plays too much of a role in\ncertain parts of neuroscience-oriented analytical philosophy. A\nSchellingian account of identity resists any attempt to reduce the\nways in which meaning arises in the world, such reductions being\ncharacteristic of philosophy which sees cognitive control as its major\nconcern. Axel Hutter suggests one implication of this when he talks of\nhow Schelling reveals\n\nthe decisive state of affairs for modern history, that the modern\nimpulse for emancipation has turned into its opposite in being carried\nout concretely in history. Modern thought falls prey, after it has\nemancipated itself from external attachment to the authority of\nrevelation, which it does completely justifiably, to another power:\nthe \u2018nature\u2019 of its cognitive capacity, which it now obeys\nmore blindly than it previously obeyed external authorities (Hutter\n1996: 300).\n\n\nIn this sense, Schelling can be seen as inaugurating the idea of a\n\u2018dialectic of Enlightenment\u2019. The freedom that Schelling\nsees as inseparable from philosophy is the potential to see that\nwholesale focus on cognitive certainty can, for all the benefits it\nmay offer, become precisely what we need to emancipate ourselves from,\nbecause we make sense of the world in many ways which cannot be\nreduced to cognition. Reason must therefore incorporate a sense of its\nown fallibility and historicity, because it involves what Schelling\nterms the \u2018dark ground which must nevertheless be the ground of\ncognition\u2019 (SW I.7: 413). We don\u2019t always deal with needs\nand impulses, or with the meanings we gain from involvement in the\nnatural world, just by knowing about the needs and about why something\nappears beautiful, overwhelming, senseless, etc. Instead we may act\nexpressively, seeking sense in ways which cognitive command of the\nworld cannot provide. How much the revival of Schellingian concerns\nmight affect a world in which human relations to nature are evidently\nin crisis remains to be seen.\n",
