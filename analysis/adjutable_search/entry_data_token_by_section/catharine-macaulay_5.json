    "main_text": "The History in Letters and Macaulay as a critic of Burke\n3. The History in Letters and Macaulay as a critic of Burke\n\nHer criticism of contemporary politics is the subject of A History\nof England, from the Revolution to the present time, in a series of\nletters to the Reverend Doctor Wilson in which she argues that,\nfar from having been an advance in English constitutional\narrangements, the Revolution of 1688 was a missed opportunity.\nAlthough\n\n\n\u2026 the power of the Crown was acknowledged to flow from no other\nfountain than of a contract with the people \u2026 the new monarch\nretained the old regal power over parliaments in its full extent; he\nwas left at liberty to convoke, adjourn, or dissolve them at his\npleasure; he was able to influence elections, and oppress\ncorporations; he possessed the right of chusing his own council, of\nnominating all the great officers of the state, the household, the\narmy, the navy, and the church; the absolute command over the militia\nwas reserved to the crown; and so totally void of improvement was the\nRevolution system, that the reliques of the star chamber was retained\nin the office of the Attorney-General, who in the case of libels has\nthe power of lodging a vexatious, and even false information, without\nbeing subjected to the penalty of cost or damage. (Macaulay 1778,\n4\u20135)\n\n\nThe argument developed in this history is that without appropriate\nconstraints on the power of the crown, parliament had inevitably\nbecome a tool of court policy. In the second volume of her\neight-volume history, she had given an extended account of Wentworth\u2019s\nmanipulation of the Irish parliament, during Charles I\u2019s reign,\ncommenting that it showed \u201cthat parliaments are noxious things\nwhen they become the dupes of ministers\u201d (Macaulay\n1763\u201383, 2.184\u20135). The relevance of this reflection for\ncontemporary politics would not have been lost on her readers, and she\nhad anticipated the argument developed in A History of England,\nfrom the Revolution to the present time in her first response to\nBurke.\n",
