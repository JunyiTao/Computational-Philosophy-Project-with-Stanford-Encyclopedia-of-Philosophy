    "main_text": "Historical Background || Leibniz\u2019 Mill\n2.1 Leibniz\u2019 Mill\n\nSearle\u2019s argument has four important antecedents. The first of\nthese is an argument set out by the philosopher and mathematician\nGottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716). This argument, often known as\n\u201cLeibniz\u2019 Mill\u201d, appears as section 17 of\nLeibniz\u2019 Monadology. Like Searle\u2019s argument,\nLeibniz\u2019 argument takes the form of a thought experiment.\nLeibniz asks us to imagine a physical system, a machine, that behaves\nin such a way that it supposedly thinks and has experiences\n(\u201cperception\u201d).\n\n17. Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which\ndepends upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to\nsay, by means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a\nmachine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it\nmight be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same\nproportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill. That being\nso, we should, on examining its interior, find only parts which work\none upon another, and never anything by which to explain a perception.\nThus it is in a simple substance, and not in a compound or in a\nmachine, that perception must be sought for. [Robert Latta\ntranslation]\n\n\nNotice that Leibniz\u2019s strategy here is to contrast the overt\nbehavior of the machine, which might appear to be the product of\nconscious thought, with the way the machine operates internally. He\npoints out that these internal mechanical operations are just parts\nmoving from point to point, hence there is nothing that is conscious\nor that can explain thinking, feeling or perceiving. For Leibniz\nphysical states are not sufficient for, nor constitutive of, mental\nstates.\n",
