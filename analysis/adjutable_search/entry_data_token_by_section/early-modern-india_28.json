    "main_text": "Meaning, Understanding and Testimony || The Language Processing Mechanism\n9.1 The Language Processing Mechanism\n\nJust as perception and inference are described, in the\npram\u0101\u1e47a system, as knowledge-yielding faculties,\nso too is language. This leads the Ny\u0101ya to formulate a\ndescription of the mechanism by which a competent language-user is\nable to decode noise-utterances and derive language-based knowledge.\nThe description The Manual of Reason gives of this\n\u2018language processing mechanism\u2019 is as follows (TS 67, 68).\nThe input to the process is the hearer\u2019s auditory perception of\na spoken utterance qua uninterpreted noise, and this is identified as\nthe \u2018special\u2019 instrument cause (kara\u1e47a).\nFor example, hearing the noise-string\n\n[*]\n\u201cThe\u201d \u201ccat\u201d \u201cis\u201d\n      \u201con\u201d \u201cthe\u201d \u201cmat\u201d.\n\n\nThe \u2018operative condition\u2019 (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) is\nthe hearer\u2019s (tacit) knowledge of the meaning\n(\u015bakti-j\u00f1\u0101na) of each of the words in the\nutterance. This is what marks off a person who understands the\nlanguage in question from one who does not (but who may, nevertheless\nhear the words spoken, without having the capacity to interpret them).\nFor example, knowledge that\n\n[M1]\n\u201cthe cat\u201d means the cat,\n[M2]\n\u201cthe mat\u201d means the mat, and\n[M3]\n\u201cis on\u201d means the substratum-superstratum relation.\n\n\nThe output of the process, i.e. the effect of the combined causal\nfactors, is the hearer\u2019s forming a belief, for example belief\nthat\n\n[P]\nThe cat is on the mat.\n\n\nJust as, in the case of perception, a number of auxiliary causal\nfactors, such as there being adequate lighting, the perceiver\u2019s\nsense-faculty being in good condition, the perceiver paying attention,\netc., so here too. Ny\u0101ya isolates four such factors for special\nattention, namely: spatio-temporal \u2018contiguity\u2019\n(sannidhi) of the uttered words; the speaker\u2019s\nintention (t\u0101tparya); \u2018syntactic expectancy\u2019\n(\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101); and \u2018semantic\nfitness\u2019 (yogyat\u0101) (cf. TS 67). The first is\nself-explanatory: if the words in the utterance are uttered one at a\ntime over a long period of time, or mixed in with the words of a\ndistinct utterance, it will be impossible form a proper auditory\nperception of the utterance. The second, \u2018speaker\u2019s\nintention\u2019 is appealed to when the sentence contains an\nambiguous word\u2014disambiguation proceeds via consideration of the\nspeaker\u2019s intended meaning. The Manual of Reason\ndefines \u2018syntactic expectancy\u2019 as \u2018the inability of\none word to produce, without another word, an awareness of the\nrelation between them\u2019, and it cites, as an example of an\nutterance which fails to possess such expectancy, the sentence\n\u201chorse man elephant\u201d. Clearly the idea is at least that\nthe utterance must be grammatically correct. More than that, there is\na suggestion that it is in virtue of the syntactical rules that the\nunarticulated semantic relations between the words are expressed. What\nmakes it the case that someone who understands the utterance\n\u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d grasps a united proposition, and\nnot just a list of items [the cat, the on-relation, the mat]? The idea\nhere, perhaps, is that (knowledge of) the syntactical rules generates\nan awareness of the connecting relations between each of these\nitems.\n\n\u2018Semantic fitness\u2019 (yogyat\u0101) is an\nintriguing concept. The Manual of Reason defines it as\n\u2018the absence of incompatibility among what is signified by the\nwords\u2019, and illustrates its definition by contrasting the\nsentence \u201cHe sprinkles the field with water\u201d with\n\u201cHe sprinkles the field with fire\u201d. The idea is that the\nactivity of sprinkling is \u2018compatible with\u2019 (i.e. can only\nbe done with) a liquid like water, and not with a substance like fire.\nIt would be like saying \u201cCathood is on the mat\u201d or perhaps\nChomsky\u2019s \u201cColourless green ideas sleep furiously\u201d.\nSuch sentences, though grammatically correct, do not make sense. This\ncausal factor, then, is that an utterance is intelligible only if the\nproposition expressed is ontologically possible, by the light of a\npreconceived ontological system, such as the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nsystem of categories. Some Naiy\u0101yikas, however, impose a more\ndemanding requirement, that to be \u2018semantically fit\u2019 the\nutterance must be true, i.e. that \u2018fit\u2019 =\n\u2018true\u2019, not merely \u2018possible\u2019, and\nconsequently that an utterance is intelligible only if it is true! In\neffect, they identify \u2018semantic fitness\u2019 with the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 or \u2018causal factor leading to\ntruth\u2019, in the language-processing mechanism. We will return to\nthis dispute a little later.\n",
