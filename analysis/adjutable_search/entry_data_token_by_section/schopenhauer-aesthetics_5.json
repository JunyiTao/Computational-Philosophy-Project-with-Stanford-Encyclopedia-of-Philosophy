Natural objects, especially flora, accommodate\nthemselves most easily to the experience of the beautiful.  \n\n\nHowever, objects can be resistant to aesthetic contemplation in two\nmain ways: either they may be stimulating to the bodily appetites or\nthey may be hostile in some way to the human will to life.\n",
