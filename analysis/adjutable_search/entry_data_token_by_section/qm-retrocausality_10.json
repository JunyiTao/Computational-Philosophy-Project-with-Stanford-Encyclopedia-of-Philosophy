    "main_text": "Motivation II: Time-Symmetry || The Action Duality Principle\n4.2 The Action Duality Principle\n\nThe more advanced relativistic quantum theories that underlie modern\nparticle physics are typically formulated in the Lagrangian, path\nintegral-based, formalism, where information about the symmetries and\ninteractions of the theory are encoded in the action, S.\nWharton, Miller, and Price (2011) use this formalism as a foundation\nto suggest that action symmetries must be reflected as ontological\nsymmetries. In particular, Wharton et al. claim that for any two\nexperimental arrangements related by a spacetime transformation (say,\nreflection in time) that leaves the action unchanged, the ontologies\nmust also remain unchanged across the same spacetime transformation.\nThis principle, referred to by Wharton et al. as action\nduality, imposes non-trivial constraints on realist accounts.\n\nNotably, Evans, Price, & Wharton (2013) argue that there is such\nan action symmetry between a pair of entangled photons passing through\nseparate polarizers and a single photon passing sequentially through\ntwo polarizers. Thus, if action duality is well-founded, the action\nsymmetry should be reflected in identical ontologies for the\naction-dual experiments. Short of rejecting action duality, this\nimplies one of two things: either the usual causal explanation for the\nbehavior of the single photon must be reflected in a causal\nexplanation for the typically-quantum behavior of the pair of\nentangled photons, and so there must be retrocausality at the level of\nthe ontic state \\(\\lambda\\), or the nonlocality ascribed to the\ntypically-quantum behavior of the pair of entangled photons must be\nsimilarly ascribed to the behavior of the single photon, and so\nnonlocality is even more dramatically widespread than usually assumed,\nand indeed is not unique to entangled bipartite quantum systems. In so\nfar as there is a strong case for the behavior of a single photon\npassing sequentially through two polarizers having a perfectly good\ncausal explanation based on spatiotemporally localized properties, the\nargument of Evans et al. is that this amounts to an equally strong\ncase for retrocausality in quantum theory.\n",
