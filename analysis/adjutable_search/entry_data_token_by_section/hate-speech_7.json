Counteracting Hate Speech\n\nOn the presumption that hate speech is harmful\u2014both particularly\nharmful for the members of targeted groups, and also generally harmful\nto democracy\u2014the natural question that follows is: what should\nwe do about it? This question, however, rests on several\nsub-questions\u2014some empirical, some conceptual\u2014that\nthemselves admit of rich dispute. For example, depending on how one\nconceives of the value and point of free expression\u2014to better\nseek the truth, to respect autonomy, to ensure democracy,\netc.\u2014different answers to the hate speech question will seem\nmore worthwhile than others. The same consideration applies to\nempirical matters as well, which are often difficult to properly\nassess in the absence of uncontroversial data. This means that\nrelatively straightforward empirical questions\u2014does genocidal\nspeech pave the way to actual genocidal violence; do governments abuse\nhate speech regulation to punish political rivals and disfavored\nminorities; and others\u2014rarely receive unanimous agreement.\nDespite these challenges, many theorists have addressed the question\nof how to counteract hate speech, and what form that response ought to\ntake.\n\nWe can divide the most common answers into three broad categories: (1)\nlegally restrict it in some form, as a justified exception to free\nexpression; (2) permit it on the basis of free expression, holding\nthat the harms of censorship outweigh the harms of hate speech; or (3)\npermit it, but take explicit measures to undo the harm of hate\nspeech.\n",
