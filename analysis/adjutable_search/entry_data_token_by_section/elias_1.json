    "main_text": "Extant Writings\n2. Extant Writings\n\nThree works attributed to Elias have been published: a commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge, a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (both in Commentaria in Aristotelem\nGraeca Vol 18) and a third, highly truncated work on\nAristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics (see Westerink 1961). The\nauthor of these works may have been a pupil of Olympiodorus, and in\nthat case it is quite possible that the commentary on the\nIsagoge was composed in the form of a transcript of\nOlympiodorus\u2019 lectures.\n\nIn the tradition of Neoplatonic philosophical training,\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge and Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories were part of the standard curriculum for\nbeginners, a practice that was well established by the 5th and 6th\ncenturies. Like Ammonius Hermeiou before him, Elias prefaces the\nlectures on the Isagoge with a very general\n\u2018Introduction\u2019 to philosophy, a text that belongs to the\ngenre of protreptic or exhortational philosophical literature.\nElias\u2019exhortation to philosophy consists of 12 lectures designed\nto serve a triple purpose: 1. to outline and define the scope of\nphilosophy, 2. to justify the various topics of the lectures the\nstudents are about to hear, and 3. to motivate them in a general way\nto pursue a course in philosophy.\n\nTo some extent, Elias\u2019 introduction to philosophy brings out the\nindividual character and temperament of the author. He comes across as\na very lively lecturer who dazzled his students with quotations and\nallusions of many kinds. For example, in his 12 introductory lectures,\nPlato is mentioned 22 times; there are 15 quotations from Homer as\nwell as numerous scattered references to Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus,\nMarinus, Hierocles, Pythagoras, Archilochus, Theognis, Herodotus,\nCallimachus, Demosthenes, Sophocles, Euripides, Menander, Galen and an\nunnamed Stoic. Moreover, Elias repeatedly emphasizes the\nPlatonic-Neoplatonic conviction that the purpose of philosophy is the\ntransformation or assimilation of a human being to the godhead, a\ngenuinely Platonic ideal explicitly stated in the Theaetetus,\n176A-B. Given that by the late 6th century a professor in Alexandria,\nor anywhere else in the Eastern empire, would address a predominantly,\nif not exclusively, Christian audience, these remarks give one pause,\nespecially if one believes that they stem from an author who, if the\nattribution to \u201cElias\u201d can be trusted, himself subscribed\nto Christianity. For a Christian, of course, drawing near the godhead\nwould not be the result of reading and embracing Platonic philosophy\nbut of divine grace that depended on faith.\n\nIn his preface to Aristotle\u2019s Categories, Elias gives a\nconcise and admirable summary of the qualities an ideal commentator\nought to have (CAG 18.1, pp. 122f. as quoted by Wilson 1983,\n47):\n\nThe commentator should be both commentator and scholar at the same\ntime. It is the task of the commentator to unravel obscurities in the\ntext; it is the task of the scholar to judge what is true and what is\nfalse, or what is sterile and what is productive. He must not\nassimilate himself to the authors he expounds, like actors on the\nstage who put on different masks because they are imitating different\ncharacters. When expounding Aristotle he must not become an\nAristotelian and say there has never been so great a philosopher; when\nexpounding Plato he must not become a Platonist and say that there has\nnever been a philosopher to match Plato. He must not force the text at\nall costs and say that the ancient author whom he is expounding is\ncorrect in every respect; instead he must repeat to himself at all\ntimes \u2018the author is a dear friend, but so also is truth, and\nwhen both stand before me truth is the better friend\u2019. He must\nnot sympathise with a philosophical school, as happened to Iamblichus,\nwho out of sympathy for Plato is condescending in his attitude to\nAristotle and will not contradict Plato in regard to the theory of\nideas. He must not be hostile to a philosophical school like Alexander\n(of Aphrodisias). The latter, being hostile to the immortality of the\nintellectual part of the soul, attempts to twist in every way the\nremarks of Aristotle in his third book on the immortality of the soul\nwhich prove that it is immortal. The commentator must know the whole\nof Aristotle in order that, having first proved that Aristotle is\nconsistent with himself, he may expound Aristotle\u2019s works by\nmeans of Aristotle\u2019s works. He must know the whole of Plato, in\norder to prove that Plato is consistent with himself and make the\nworks of Aristotle an introduction to those of Plato.\n\n",
