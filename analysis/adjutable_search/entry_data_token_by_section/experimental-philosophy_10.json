On this view, there are certain\nproperties that differentiate work in philosophy from work in other\ndisciplines. Research in experimental philosophy lacks these\nproperties and is therefore best understood as falling outside the\nphilosophical tradition entirely. Note that this last objection is not\nconcerned with the question as to whether experimental philosophy has\nany value but rather with the question as to whether it should be\nconsidered part of a particular discipline. As one recent paper puts\nit, \n\n\n\u2026 what is at issue is not whether there is room for such\nempirical study, but whether there is room for it now as a branch of\nphilosophy. (Sorell forthcoming: 6)\n\n\nIn actual practice, debate over this objection has tended to focus on\nquestions in the history of philosophy. Clearly, numerous philosophers\nfrom Aristotle through Nietzsche were deeply concerned with empirical\nquestions about human nature, so it might seem that the default view,\nat least in the absence of any counterarguments, should be that work\non these issues can indeed count as philosophy. The key question,\nthen, is whether there are any legitimate counterarguments.\n\nOne possible argument would be that although the people we now regard\nas philosophers did work on these issues, this aspect of their work\nshould not be regarded as falling within the discipline of philosophy.\nAnthony Appiah questions this gambit:\n\n\nYou would have a difficult time explaining to most of the canonical\nphilosophers that this part of the work was echt\nphilosophy and that part of their work was not. Trying to\nseparate out the \u201cmetaphysical\u201d from the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d elements in this corpus is like trying to\npeel a raspberry. (Appiah 2008: 13)\n\n\nAccording to this response, there is a well-established practice\nwithin the history of philosophy of exploring empirical and\npsychological questions, and it is actually the idea of carefully\nseparating the psychological from the philosophical that should be\nregarded as a departure from philosophical tradition.\n\nMore recent work on these issues has been concerned especially with\nthe early modern period. It has been noted that some of the most\nprominent philosophers in this period actually conducted experimental\nstudies (Sytsma & Livengood 2015), and some explicitly referred to\nthemselves as \u2018experimental philosophers\u2019 (Anstey &\nVanzo 2016). Though contemporary experimental philosophy obviously\ndiffers in certain respects from these historical antecedents, one\nmight argue that the work of contemporary experimental philosophers is\nbest understood as a continuation of this broad historical\ntradition.\n\nOn the other side, it has been argued that this historical continuity\npicture fails to take account of a change in the use of the word\n\u2018philosophy\u2019 (Sorell forthcoming). In the Renaissance,\nphysics was referred to as \u2018philosophy,\u2019 but we would not\nsay that all research in contemporary physics belongs in the\ndiscipline of philosophy. Similarly, even if work on the psychology of\nmoral judgment was historically classified as philosophy, one might\nthink that it should not be regarded today as falling into the\ndiscipline of philosophy but rather into a distinct discipline.\n\nCertainly, partisans on both sides of this debate should agree that\nthe boundaries of a discipline can change over time, but this point\ncuts both ways. Just as the boundaries of a discipline may have\nchanged in the past, they can change in the future. It will therefore\nbe interesting to see how the boundaries of the discipline of\nphilosophy evolve over the course of the next few decades and how this\nevolution impacts the status of experimental philosophy.\n",
