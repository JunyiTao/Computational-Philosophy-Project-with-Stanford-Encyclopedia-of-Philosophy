    "main_text": "Other Model-theoretic Games || Games on the tree of two successor functions\n7.3 Games on the tree of two successor functions\n\nImagine a tree that has been built up in levels. At the bottom level\nthere is a single root node, but a left branch and a right branch come\nup from it. At the next level up there are two nodes, one on each\nbranch, and from each of these nodes a left branch and a right branch\ngrow up. So on the next level up there are four nodes, and again the\ntree branches into left and right at each of these nodes. Continued to\ninfinity, this tree is called the tree of two successor\nfunctions (namely left successor and right successor). Taking the\nnodes as elements and introducing two function symbols for left and\nright successor, we have a structure. A powerful theorem of Michael\nRabin states that there is an algorithm which will tell us, for every\nmonadic second-order sentence \\(\\phi\\) in the language appropriate for\nthis structure, whether or not \\(\\phi\\) is true in the structure.\n(\u2019Monadic second-order\u2019 means that the logic is like\nfirst-order, except that we can also quantify over sets of\nelements\u2014but not over binary relations on elements, for\nexample.)\n\nRabin\u2019s theorem has any number of useful consequences. For\nexample Dov Gabbay used it to prove the decidability of some modal\nlogics. But Rabin\u2019s proof, using automata, was notoriously\ndifficult to follow. Yuri Gurevich and Leo Harrington, and\nindependently Andrei Muchnik, found much simpler proofs in which the\nautomaton is a player in a game.\n\nThis result of Rabin is one of several influential resuls that connect\ngames with automata. Another example is the parity games\nwhich are used for verifying properties of modal systems. See for\nexample Stirling (2001) Chapter 6; Bradfield and Stirling (2006)\ndiscuss parity games for the modal \\(\\mu\\)-calculus. \n8. Games of dialogue, communication and proof\n\nSeveral medieval texts describe a form of debate called\nobligationes. There were two disputants, Opponens and\nRespondens. At the beginning of a session, the disputants would agree\non a \u2018positum\u2019, typically a false statement. The job of\nRespondens was to give rational answers to questions from Opponens,\nassuming the truth of the positum; above all he had to avoid\ncontradicting himself unnecessarily. The job of Opponens was to try to\nforce Respondens into contradictions. So we broadly know the answer to\nthe Dawkins question, but we don\u2019t know the game rules! The\nmedieval textbooks do describe several rules that the disputants\nshould follow. But these rules are not stipulated rules of the game;\nthey are guidelines which the textbooks derive from principles of\nsound reasoning with the aid of examples. (Paul of Venice justifies\none rule by the practice of \u2018great logicians, philosophers,\ngeometers and theologians\u2019.) In particular it was open to a\nteacher of obligationes to discover new rules. This open-endedness\nimplies that obligationes are not logical games in our sense.\n\nNot everybody agrees with the previous sentence. For example Catarina\nDutilh Novaes (2007, 6) makes a detailed defence of the view that\nobligationes present \u201ca remarkable case of conceptual similarity\nbetween a medieval and a modern theoretical framework\u201d. But\nwhatever view we take on this question, these debates have inspired\none important line of modern research in logical games.\n\nImagine \\(\\exists\\) taking an oral examination in proof theory. The\nexaminer gives her a sentence and invites her to start proving it. If\nthe sentence has the form \n\n\\[\n\\phi \\vee \\psi\n\\]\n\n\nthen she is entitled to choose one of the sentences and say \u2018OK,\nI\u2019ll prove this one\u2019. (In fact if the examiner is an\nintuitionist, he may insist that she choose one of the sentences to\nprove.) On the other hand if the sentence is \n\n\\[\n\\phi \\wedge \\psi\n\\]\n\n\nthen the examiner, being an examiner, might well choose one of the\nconjuncts himself and invite her to prove that one. If she knows how\nto prove the conjunction then she certainly knows how to prove the\nconjunct.\n\nThe case of \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi\\) is a little subtler. She will\nprobably want to start by assuming \\(\\phi\\) in order to deduce\n\\(\\psi\\); but there is some risk of confusion because the sentences\nthat she has written down so far are all of them things to be proved,\nand \\(\\phi\\) is not a thing to be proved. The examiner can help her by\nsaying \u2018I\u2019ll assume \\(\\phi\\), and let\u2019s see if you\ncan get to \\(\\psi\\) from there\u2019. At this point there is a chance\nthat she sees a way of getting to \\(\\psi\\) by deducing a contradiction\nfrom \\(\\phi\\); so she may turn the tables on the examiner and invite\nhim to show that his assumption is consistent, with a view to proving\nthat it isn\u2019t. The symmetry is not perfect: he was asking her to\nshow that a sentence is true everywhere, while she is inviting him to\nshow that a sentence is true somewhere. Nevertheless we can see a sort\nof duality.\n\nIdeas of this kind lie behind the dialectical games of Paul Lorenzen.\nHe showed that with a certain amount of pushing and shoving, one can\nwrite rules for the game which have the property that \\(\\exists\\) has\na winning strategy if and only if the sentence that she is presented\nwith at the beginning is a theorem of intuitionistic logic. In a\ngesture towards medieval debates, he called \\(\\exists\\) the Proponent\nand the other player the Opponent. Almost as in the medieval\nobligationes, the Opponent wins by driving the Proponent to a point\nwhere the only moves available to her are blatant\nself-contradictions.\n\nLorenzen claimed that his games provided justifications for both\nintuitionist and classical logic (or in his words, made them\n\u2018gerechtfertigt\u2019, Lorenzen (1961,196)). Unfortunately any\n\u2018justification\u2019 involves a convincing answer to the\nDawkins question, and this Lorenzen never provided. For example he\nspoke of moves as \u2018attacks\u2019, even when (like the\nexaminer\u2019s choice at \\(\\phi \\wedge \\psi\\) above) they look more\nlike help than hostility. \n\nThe entry\n dialogical logic\n gives a fuller account of Lorenzen\u2019s games and a number of more\nrecent variants. In its present form (January 2013) it sidesteps\nLorenzen\u2019s claims about justifying logics. Instead it describes\nthe games as providing semantics for the logics (a point that Lorenzen\nwould surely have agreed with), and adds that for understanding the\ndifferences between logics it can be helpful to compare their\nsemantics. \n\nFrom this point of view, Lorenzen\u2019s games stand as an important\nparadigm of what recent proof theorists have called semantics of\nproofs. A semantics of proofs gives a \u2018meaning\u2019 not\njust to the notion of being provable, but to each separate step in a\nproof. It answers the question \u2018What do we achieve by making\nthis particular move in the proof?\u2019 During the 1990s a number of\nworkers at the logical end of computer science looked for games that\nwould stand to\n linear logic\n and some other proof systems in the same way as Lorenzen\u2019s\ngames stood to intuitionist logic. Andreas Blass, and then later\nSamson Abramsky and colleagues, gave games that corresponded to parts\nof linear logic, but at the time of writing we don\u2019t yet have a\nperfect correspondence between game and logic. This example is\nparticularly interesting because the answer to the Dawkins question\nshould give an intuitive interpretation of the laws of linear logic, a\nthing that this logic has badly needed. The games of Abramsky et al.\ntell a story about two interacting systems. But while he began with\ngames in which the players politely take turns, Abramsky later allowed\nthe players to act \u2018in a distributed, asynchronous\nfashion\u2019, taking notice of each other only when they choose to.\nThese games are no longer in the normal format of logical games, and\ntheir real-life interpretation raises a host of new questions.\n\nGiorgi Japaridze has proposed a \u2018computability logic\u2019 for\nstudying computation. Its syntax is first-order logic with some extra\nitems reminiscent of linear logic. Its semantics is in terms of\nsemantic games with some unusual features. For example it is not\nalways determined which player makes the next move. The notion of\nstrategy functions is no longer adequate for describing the players;\ninstead Japaridze describes ways of reading the second player (player\n\\(\\exists\\) in our notation) as a kind of computing machine. Further\ninformation is on his website.\n\nAnother group of games of the same general family as Lorenzen\u2019s\nare the proof games of Pavel Pudlak 2000. Here the Opponent (called\nProver) is in the role of an attorney in a court of law, who knows\nthat the Proponent (called Adversary) is guilty of some offence.\nProponent will insist he is innocent, and is prepared to tell lies to\ndefend himself. Opponent\u2019s aim is to force Proponent to\ncontradict something that Proponent is on record as having said\nearlier; but Opponent keeps the record and (as in the pebble games\nabove) he sometimes has to drop items from the record for lack of\nspace or memory. The important question is not whether Opponent has a\nwinning strategy (it\u2019s assumed from the outset that he has one),\nbut how much memory he needs for his record. These games are a useful\ndevice for showing upper and lower bounds on the lengths of proofs in\nvarious proof systems.\n\nAnother kind of logical game that allows lies is Ulam\u2019s Game\nwith Lies. Here one player thinks of a number in some given range. The\nsecond player\u2019s aim is to find out what that number is, by\nasking the first player yes/no questions; but the first player is\nallowed to tell some fixed number of lies in his answers. As in\nPudlak\u2019s games, there is certainly a winning strategy for the\nsecond player, but the question is how hard this player has to work in\norder to win. The measure this time is not space or memory but time:\nhow many questions does he have to ask? Cignoli et al. 2000 Chapter 5\nrelate this game to many-valued logic.\n\nTo return for a moment to Lorenzen: he failed to distinguish between\ndifferent stances that a person might take in an argument: stating,\nassuming, conceding, querying, attacking, committing oneself. Whether\nit is really possible to define all these notions without presupposing\nsome logic is a moot point. But never mind that; a refinement of\nLorenzen\u2019s games along these lines could serve as an approach to\ninformal logic, and especially to the research that aims to\nsystematise the possible structures of sound informal argument. On\nthis front see Walton and Krabbe 1995. The papers in Bench-Capon and\nDunne 2007 are also relevant. ",
