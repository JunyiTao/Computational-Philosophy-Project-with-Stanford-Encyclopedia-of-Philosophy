    "main_text": "Extended Simples || Against Extended Simples #2: from Qualitative Variation\n5.5 Against Extended Simples #2: from Qualitative Variation\n\nA second argument against extended simples arises from problems about\nsimples whose intrinsic properties vary across space or spacetime:\n\n(12)\nIf it is possible for there to be an extended simple, then it is\npossible for there to be an extended simple that exhibits intrinsic\nqualitative variation across spacetime\u2014e.g. an extended simple\nthat is white in one region and grey in another. (Colors are just\nplaceholders; presumably more realistic examples are available.)\n(13)\nNecessarily, for any x, if x varies across spacetime\nwith respect to its intrinsic properties, then there are incompatible\nintrinsic properties F and G and parts\nx1 and x2 of x such that\nx1 instantiates F and x2\ninstantiates G.\n(14)\nNecessarily, for any x, if there are incompatible intrinsic\nproperties F and G and parts x1 and\nx2 of x such that x1\ninstantiates F and x2 instantiates G,\nthen x is not simple.\nTherefore\n(15)\nIt is not possible for there to be an extended simple.\n\n\nThe argument is valid and (14) is clearly true. If x has a part\nthat instantiates F and a part that instantiates G,\nthen, provided that these properties are incompatible, the parts in\nquestion are not identical. So x has at least two parts. So at\nleast one of them must be a proper part of x, in which\ncase x is not simple.\n\nOne might resist the argument by denying (12) and saying that a simple\ncan be extended but only if it is qualitatively homogeneous across\nspacetime. (Spencer 2010 denies the possibility of heterogeneous\nextended simples. Jaeger 2014 responds; Spencer 2014 replies.) But\nmost friends of extended simples grant (12) and reject (13). This can\nbe done in at least four ways.\n5.6.1 The relativizing approach\n\nThe relativizing approach says that if a simple, o, is white in\none region and grey in another, then o bears the being white at\nrelation to the first region and the being grey at relation to the\nsecond; it need not have a part that instantiates the property\nwhiteness or a part that instantiates the property greyness.\nAlternatively, one might treat instantiation as a three-place\nrelation, and say that o instantiates the property whiteness at\none region and instantiates the property greyness at another.\n\nBoth versions of this approach are based on theories of persistence\nand change that attempt to reconcile eternalism and the B-theory of\ntime with endurantism, the view that objects are wholly present at\nmultiple times and do not have temporal parts (for more on\nendurantism, see\n section 6.3).\n Accordingly, the standard criticisms of the relevant theories of\npersistence and change (on which see Haslanger 2003) would seem to\napply equally to the relativizing approach to the problem of\nqualitative variation for extended simples. The main criticism is\nthat, by appealing to relations to regions, the relativizing approach\nmakes an object's color distribution (or whatever) a dyadic relation\nor an extrinsic property, when it is in fact (says the critic) an\nintrinsic property, involving only the object, its parts, and the\nintrinsic properties of these things.\n5.6.2 The stuff-theoretic approach\n\nMarkosian (1998, 2004a, 2015) distinguishes between things (e.g.,\nmaterial objects) and stuff (e.g., matter). Stuff, according to\nMarkosian, comes in portions, but no portion of stuff is a thing. Both\nthings and portions of stuff can have parts, but any part of a thing\nis itself a thing, and any part of a portion of stuff is itself a\nportion of stuff. Crucially, each thing is constituted by a\nportion of stuff. With this framework in place, Markosian offers the\nfollowing account. There can be extended simple things, but there\ncannot be extended simple portions of stuff. When an extended simple,\no, is white in region rw and grey in\nregion rg, this isn't because o itself\nhas a part that is exactly located at rw and\ninstantiates whiteness and another part that is exactly located at\nrg and instantiates greyness; rather, it's\nbecause the portion of stuff that constitutes o has such parts.\nThis preserves the simplicity of the extended thing. It may also avoid\nthe complaint, facing the relativizing approach, that it makes the\ncolor distribution of an extended simple an extrinsic matter. The\nrelation between a thing and the portion of stuff that constitutes it\nis apparently more intimate than the relation between a thing and the\nregion at which it is exactly located. Moreover, the stuff-theoretic\napproach, unlike the relativizing approach, holds that when an\nextended object is white in one region and grey in another, the\nmonadic, intrinsic properties whiteness and greyness (not merely the\ndyadic relations being white at and being\ngrey at) are both instantiated. However, some\nmay doubt that a complex entity could constitute a simple one.\n5.6.3 Distributional properties\n\nParsons (2000) proposes that if a simple is white in one region and\ngrey in another, then it has a fundamental, intrinsic,\ndistributional property. Some distributional properties, such\nas being black all over, are uniform.\nOthers, such as being polka-dotted are\nnon-uniform. When a simple has a non-uniform distributional\nproperty, this fact is not grounded in its having parts, configured in\na certain way, that each have simpler, uniform properties. Nor is it\ngrounded in the simple's standing in incompatible relations (being\nwhite at and being grey at)\nto different spacetime regions. Rather, it is an ungrounded fact about\nthe simple. This apparently avoids the worries about extrinsicness\nthat face the relativizing approach, and it makes no appeal to\nMarkosian's unorthodox notion of constitution.\n\nAs McDaniel (2009) notes, however, Parsons is apparently forced to\ntreat facts of the form x is F at r as\nunanalyzed and ungrounded, which one might take to be a drawback. In\nFigure 5, the objects o1 and o2\npresumably have the same maximally determinate distributional color\nproperty: roughly, being grey in one half and white in\nthe other.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nCall this property P. Further, object\no1 is grey at region r1g.\nWhat grounds this fact? Not the fact that o1 has\nP. After all, o2 also has P, but it is\nnot grey at r1g. Not the fact that\no1 has P and is exactly located at\nr1. For it is possible that there be a thing that\nhas P and is exactly located at r1g\nbut is not grey at r1g: this is the case,\ne.g., in the possible world that results from deleting\no1 and putting o2 in its place\n(without rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise). Thus, in addition\nto his basic distributional properties, Parsons is apparently forced\nto treat relations to regions (e.g., being grey\nat) as being basic as well.\n\nThe relativizing approach has no such problem: it treats relations to\nregions as basic and analyzes distributional properties in terms of\nthem. The stuff-theoretic approach avoids the problem too. It analyzes\nfacts of the form x is F at y as: either\nx or the portion of stuff that constitutes x has a part\nthat is exactly located at y and is F.\n5.6.4 Tropes\n\nMcDaniel (2009) attempts to avoid all the above problems by appeal to\na theory of tropes developed by Ehring (1997a,b). The idea is that a\nsimple can be grey in one region and white in another region by\ninstantiating a greyness trope that is exactly located at the first\nregion and instantiating a whiteness trope that is exactly located at\nthe second region. This permits an analysis of facts of the form\nx is F at y as x instantiates\nan F-ness trope that is exactly located at y; it\nmakes no appeal to stuff or portions of stuff; and, since it invokes\nmonadic color tropes, it (arguably) refrains from treating\nthe facts about a simple's color distribution as being fundamentally\nrelational and extrinsic.\n\nFor further arguments against extended simples, see Section 2.2 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments.\n",
