    "main_text": "Types of Computer Simulations || Agent-based simulations\n2.2 Agent-based simulations\n\n\nAgent-based simulations are most common in the social and behavioral\nsciences, though we also find them in such disciplines as artificial\nlife, epidemiology, ecology, and any discipline in which the networked\ninteraction of many individuals is being studied. \nAgent-based simulations are similar to particle-based simulations in\nthat they represent the behavior of n-many discrete individuals. \nBut unlike equation-particle-based simulations, there are no global\ndifferential equations that govern the motions of the\nindividuals. Rather, in agent-based simulations, the behavior of\nthe individuals is dictated by their own local rules\n\n\nTo give one example: a famous and groundbreaking agent-based\nsimulation was Thomas Schelling\u2019s (1971) model of\n\u201csegregation.\u201d The agents in his simulation\nwere individuals who \u201clived\u201d on a chessboard. \nThe individuals were divided into two groups in the society (e.g. two\ndifferent races, boys and girls, smokers and non-smokers, etc.) \nEach square on the board represented a house, with at most one person\nper house. An individual is happy if he/she has a certain percent\nof neighbors of his/her own group. Happy agents stay where they are,\nunhappy agents move to free locations. Schelling found that the board\nquickly evolved into a strongly segregated location pattern if the\nagents\u2019 \u201chappiness rules\u201d were specified so that\nsegregation was heavily favored. Surprisingly, however, he also found\nthat initially integrated boards tipped into full segregation even if\nthe agents\u2019 happiness rules expressed only a mild preference for having\nneighbors of their own type.\n",
