    "main_text": "Hallmarks of Japanese Philosophical Analysis || Internal Relations\n2.1 Internal Relations\n\nWhen Japanese thinkers assume two items are related (whether the items\nbe physical entities, ideas, persons, social structures, etc.), they\ncommonly begin by examining how the items internally overlap (how they\ninterrelate) rather than by looking for something additional\n(a third item whether it be another thing, idea, force, or whatever)\nthat externally connects or bonds them. The simple\ndiagrams below indicate the chief difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFigure 1: External Relation \n\n\nFigure 2: Internal Relation \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows a and b as discrete entities in an\nexternal relation represented by the extrinsic linking agency of\nR. Figure 2, by contrast, shows a and b as\ninternally related entities such that R denotes what they\nshare, what intrinsically conjoins them. In the case of the external\nrelation, if the relation dissolves (or is omitted from the analysis),\na and b each retains its own integrity without loss.\nOnly the context of their connection disappears. In the case of an\ninternal relation, on the other hand, if the relation dissolves (or is\nomitted from the analysis), a loses part of itself, as does\nb. For instance, as a legal arrangement, marriage is an\nexternal, contractual relation into which two individuals enter.\nShould that arrangement end, each of the pair returns to his or her\noriginally discrete individuality and attendant rights. As a loving\narrangement, however, marriage is an internal relation in which two\npeople share part of themselves and should the love connection\ndissolve, each person loses part of what one had formerly been, the\npart that had been invested in the other. As Emily Dickinson (1884)\nwrote after losing a beloved friend, she became a\n\u201ccrescent\u201d of her former self. (See the entry on\n relations\n for further discussion of the external/internal distinction.)\n\nWhen Japanese philosophers emphasize engaged over detached knowing,\ntheir treatment of standard philosophical themes assumes distinctive\nnuances. One example will illustrate. Because of its roots in praxis,\nJapanese philosophy approaches mind-body issues differently from how\nthey have typically been addressed in the West, especially the modern\nWest. As the postwar philosopher, Yuasa Yasuo (1925\u20132005)\nanalyzes in detail (Yuasa 1987), the preference in modern Western\nphilosophy has been to think about the mind and body as discrete (that\nis, as external to each other) and the issue then becomes\nwhat connects the two. If no third external connection can be\nfound, the only obvious alternative is to eliminate the dualism by\nreducing one of the polarities to the other, for example, by making\nthe mind an epiphenomenon of the body. Yuasa found such formulations\nof the mind-body problem alien to the Japanese philosophical\ntradition, both ancient and modern.\n\nJapanese philosophers have customarily taken the view that the body\nand mind may be distinguished, but they have assumed from the outset\nthat their relation is internal rather than external. That is, the\nmind and body cannot be completely separated without violating their\nessential character or function. If we envision body and mind as a\nsingle complex of two intersecting circles (call it bodymind\nto capture the sense of the Japanese compound term shinjin),\nthen without the somatic conjunction, the mind is not fully the mind\nand without the mental conjunction, the body is not fully the body.\nAccordingly, Yuasa argues, Japanese philosophers have throughout\nhistory typically searched not for what constant connects the\ndiscrete mind and discrete body, but instead, how the\nbodymind functions such that the interrelationship between the somatic\nand mental aspects may increase. That is, the focus has been\nhow disciplined study and praxis enables the two circles to\noverlap increasingly in the direction of unity.\n\nThat approach implies that the bodymind relationship is a changing\ninternal relationship rather than a fixed external one. In learning to\nplay the piano, for example, Yuasa says the novice has \u201cthe mind\nlead the body\u201d to memorize the keys, but as the pianist becomes\nproficient, \u201cthe body leads the mind\u201d so that it seems the\n\u201cfingers know where the keys are\u201d without the intrusion of\nconscious thinking, leaving the mind to concentrate more fully on the\nmusic itself. As the two circles more fully merge, the bodymind\nbecomes capable of holistic function. That unification enables further\ncreativity and insight\u2014the point when the music, the mind, and\nthe fingers touching the keyboard become a single act. That pathway to\nincreasing bodymind unity explains how praxis and discipline are\nprerequisite to free expression. Yuasa explains how this integrative\nbodymind phenomenon is treated in various Western as well as Eastern\ntheories including neurology, the psychology of conditioned response,\npsychosomatic medicine, depth psychology, phenomenologies of the body,\nIndian Ayurvedic medicine, kundalini yogic praxis, Japanese theories\nof artistry, and East Asian models of ki (qi in\nChinese) within medicine and the martial arts.\n\nYuasa concludes that philosophy would be well served by leaving the\nrarefied pure and distinct abstractions of Cartesian metaphysics and\nits theory of the substantially discrete body and mind. By focusing\ninstead on the dynamics of bodymind as a single fluid system, the\ndualism inherent in the classic Western mind-body problem would\ndissolve into an engaged study of the Way of bodymind: its\ncultivation, transformation, and its links to praxis, performance,\nholistic health, and creative expression. Yuasa\u2019s philosophy\nexemplifies how contemporary Japanese thinkers may constructively\nengage Western thought while drawing on strands of their own premodern\ntraditions. As we have seen, his analysis shows how a relation (in\nthis case that between mind and body) that is commonly assumed to be\nexternal in modern Western philosophy is understood quite differently\nwhen it is assumed to be internal. This difference is typical not only\nof Yuasa, but also more generally of Japanese philosophizing at\nlarge.\n\nConsider also how highlighting internal relations would affect ethical\nproblems involving self and other (whether the \u201cother\u201d is\nanother person, a group, a thing, the natural world, etc.). Most\nJapanese philosophers tend to pose the fundamental question not in\nterms of what principles or calculus of consequential considerations\ndefine the ideal relation spanning the two. Instead their analyses\nmore commonly begin from a consideration of what the self and other\nintrinsically share such that there is an original relationship at\nall: What is the common ground giving rise to the relationship? That\nis, ethics is not about making relations but about discovering\ninterrelations.\n\nSimilarly, in aesthetics the general modus operandi for the Japanese\nphilosopher is not to explain art as establishing extrinsic contexts\nor criteria that connect artist, medium, creative intention, audience,\nand the work of art (whether the work be poetry, painting, or a\ndramatic or musical performance). Instead the Japanese philosopher\ndelves immediately into the in medias res of the work of art\nas the presentation of a single interresponsive field (often called\nkokoro) out of which that whole cluster of aesthetic\ncomponents takes form. (See the entry on\n Japanese Aesthetics.)\n\nTo take one final example, in his ethico-political philosophy, Watsuji\nTetsur\u014d (1889\u20131960) explicitly rejected as a starting point\nthe social contract theory of the modern West (Watsuji 1996). As a way\nof theorizing the meaning and purpose of the state, a social contract\nis conceived as an external relation made by discrete, independent\nindividuals. Watsuji\u2019s critique was that even a thought\nexperiment should begin with an understanding of human existence based\nin fact. Human being originates not as an individual, but as a fetus\ninterdependent with its mother and once born, the baby is fully\ndependent on its mother. Only subsequently does it develop\nindividuality and independence, but even then it is in transition to\nbecoming a socialized human being. To understand ethics and politics,\nWatsuji argues, even a thought experiment must recognize the inherent\nrelations intrinsic to, and constitutive of, human being in that\nongoing process, what he called a dialectic of interpersonal\nbetweenness or being in the \u201cmidst of the interpersonal\u201d\n(hito to hito no aidagara) that precedes the polarization\ninto either individual or collective.
