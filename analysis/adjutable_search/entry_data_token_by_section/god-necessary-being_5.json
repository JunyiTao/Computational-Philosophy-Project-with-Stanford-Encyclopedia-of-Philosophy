    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects I: Views on Which Necessarily Existing Abstracta Are All Grounded in God || Theistic Mentalism (without Divine Simplicity)\n3.3 Theistic Mentalism (without Divine Simplicity)\n\nOne sort of theistic mentalism is the view that necessarily existing\nabstract objects are divine mental states, and that God isn\u2019t\n simple.[10]\n On this view, God is distinct from his mental states, and abstracta\nare identical with these mental states. One proponent of this view is\nWelty (2014). He says\n\n\nI maintain that [abstract objects] are constitutively\ndependent on God, for they are constituted by the divine ideas, which\ninhere in the divine mind and have no existence outside\nit\u2026[Abstract objects] are necessarily existing, uncreated\ndivine ideas that are distinct from God and dependent on God. (2014:\n81)\n\n\nWhy might someone adopt theistic mentalism? One could make the\nfollowing sort of case. Thoughts (e.g., sentences in the language of\nthought) are capable of representing the world as being a particular\nway. Propositions are capable of representing the world as being a\nparticular way. Why do we need both of these sorts of intentional\nentities? We can simply identify propositions and thoughts, and we get\na simpler ontology.\n\nOf course, there is a problem here. If the thoughts we speak of here\nare human thoughts, there are continuum-many true propositions, and\nfinitely many human thoughts. Also, there are propositions true in\nworlds where there are no human thoughts. So we can\u2019t identify\npropositions and human thoughts. But we don\u2019t have this problem\nwith divine thoughts. God, we may grant, exists necessarily. And God\nhas sufficiently many mental states to stand in for true propositions\n(see Plantinga 1980, 1982).\n\nIf we identify propositions with divine thoughts, we have enough of\nthem in all possible situations. And one has one fewer kind of thing\nif one admits only thoughts (divine and otherwise) rather than\nthoughts and propositions. But there are reasons to think\nthere are both thoughts and propositions and that the two\nshouldn\u2019t be identified, even if one identifies propositions and\ndivine thoughts. The most straightforward reason is that thoughts are\na different kind of entity from propositions. The former are concrete,\nand the latter abstract. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting the\nconceptual role propositions play. They are the sorts of things that\ncan be affirmed, doubted, believed, and questioned. They can be true\nand false, necessary and possible. It is said by some that they are\nsets of possible worlds; and by others that they are composite\nentities, made up of properties and relations, and perhaps concrete\nindividuals. It\u2019s not at all clear that thoughts, especially\ndivine thoughts, satisfy any of these conceptual roles.\n\nWe also should ask about other necessarily existing abstracta. What\nsorts of mental entities are they? Do they relate to one another, as\nconcrete mental tokens, in the right sort of way such that they mirror\nthe ways that Platonic states of affairs, propositions, properties,\nrelations, and numbers relate to each other? \n\nWhat these considerations suggest is that theistic mentalism may\nactually be a sort of nominalism about abstract objects, in the way\nthat Plantinga (2003: ch. 10) says Lewis\u2019 (1986) conception of\npossible worlds is a sort of nominalism about possible worlds. At\nbest, we have concrete things that play the roles of necessarily\nexisting abstract objects. (And the theistic mentalist has a great deal\nmore work in specifying concrete divine mental particulars such that\nwe have all the requisite role-players among the various sorts of\nnecessarily existing abstract objects. It is presumably not enough to\nsay that propositions are divine thoughts and leave it at that.)\n\nLet us return to the initial motivation for theistic mentalism: There\nare two sorts of intentional objects (propositions and thoughts), and\nit would be a simpler metaphysic to identify tokens of the two sorts.\nTo assess this, we must ask if the tokens of the two sorts are enough\nlike each other to be identified. That is, simplicity isn\u2019t the\nonly consideration relevant here. After all, Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysic (necessarily there is one object that is exactly as it is\nin the actual world) is maximally simple, yet has few proponents\nwithin western philosophy. Furthermore, if we are able to explain the\nintentionality of one of these sorts of entities by its relation to\nthe other, it will seem less mysterious that we have two classes of\nintentional entities. That is precisely what many want to say about\nthe intentionality of thoughts vis-\u00e0-vis that of propositions:\nThoughts derive their intentionality by standing in the right sort of\nrelation to propositions. So, the reason why my thought is a thought\nthat grass is green is because it has the propositional content\nthat grass is green. The proposition that grass is\ngreen has its intentionality intrinsically.\n",
