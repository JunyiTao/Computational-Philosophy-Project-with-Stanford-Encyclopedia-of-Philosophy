    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || The Other Worlds Strategy\n5.3 The Other Worlds Strategy\n\nThe other worlds strategy has been proposed by Graham Priest (2005)\nand Francesco Berto (2008). Priest calls his theory noneism;\nBerto names it modal Meinongianism. The term\n\u201cnoneism\u201d has been coined by Richard Routley, and Priest\nnot only takes over the name but also essential features of\nRoutley\u2019s theory (among other things the assumption that basic\nprinciples of standard logics, like the principle of contradiction, do\nnot hold without restriction\u2014without, of course, accepting that\neverything is true).\n\nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject both the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy and the dual copula strategy. Instead,\nthey assume merely possible and even impossible worlds. All worlds\n(possible as well as impossible ones) share the same domain of\ndiscourse. But not all objects of the domain exist in all worlds.\nThus, Pegasus does not exist in the actual world, but it exists in a\nvariety of merely possible worlds (namely in those which are such as\nrepresented by the Greek mythology).\n\nAccording to the other worlds strategy, nonexistent objects literally\nhave the properties through which they are\n\u201ccharacterized\u201d\u2014but they have these properties not\nin the actual world but only in those worlds \u201cwhich realize the\nway the objects are represented as being in the appropriate cognitive\nstate [\u2026].\u201d (Priest 2011b, 249, footnote 35) Suppose you\nimagine a winged horse. In this case, in your imagination, you have an\nintentional object that is represented as being winged and a horse.\nThus, the intentional object of your present intentional state is a\nnonexistent winged horse, which is, however, in the actual world\nneither winged nor a horse. In some worlds, however, this object\n\\(is\\) winged and a horse \u2013 namely in those worlds which\nrealize the way the object is represented in your\n imagination.[24]\n\nThe other worlds strategy provides the following solution to the\nparadox of contradiction: The round square exists only in impossible\nworlds. In impossible worlds, however, the principle of contradiction\ndoes not hold. Therefore, the round square\u2019s being both round\nand not round does not infringe the laws of logic which hold in those\nworlds in which the round square exists.\n\nIn the actual world, however, the round square is neither round nor\nsquare, since roundness and squareness are \u201cexistence-entailing\nproperties\u201d, i.e., \u201c\\(b\\) is round/square\u201d\nentails \u201c\\(b\\) exists\u201d. Therefore, even if in the\nactual world (and in all other possible worlds) the law of\ncontradiction holds, the round square does not infringe this law,\nsince in these worlds the round square is neither round nor not\nround.\n\nIn the light of this theory, it is easy to explain why nobody has ever\nseen the round square or a golden mountain and why the round square is\nobviously not located in space: since the round square is neither\nround nor square in the actual world, there is no reason to assume\nthat it occupies space or is accessible to the senses. Similar\nconsiderations hold for the golden mountain.\n\nIt is worth noting that the postulation of existence-entailing\nproperties is an implicit rejection of Meinong\u2019s principle of\nindependence, which is one of the cornerstones of Meinongian object\ntheory.\n\nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction because they find it \u201cdifficult\nto avoid the feeling that the class [of nuclear predicates] has been\ngerrymandered simply to avoid problems\u201d (Priest 2005, 83).\n\nBut Priest\u2019s proposal has difficulties of its\n own.[25]\n To mention some of them: First, Priest does not give a principled\ncharacterization of which properties are existence-entailing and which\nare not (which looks quite similar to the problem with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction which Priest points out in the above\nquotation). Second, it remains unclear which properties nonexistent\nobjects have in the actual world (apart from logical properties like\nbeing self-identical and intentional properties like being thought of\nby\n Priest).[26]\n Furthermore, Priest\u2019s noneism raises difficult questions about\ncross-world identity and the ontological status of non-actual worlds.\nThe ontological status of non-actual worlds is far from obvious: they\nmay be taken to be concrete objects (structured sets of physical\nobjects) or abstract objects (sets of sentences, propositions, or\nstates of affairs). (For an elaborate survey of various conceptions of\nnon-actual worlds see the entry on\n possible worlds, i.e., Menzel\n 2014.)[27]\n Apart from this, it is doubtful whether Priest\u2019s theory\nprovides an adequate account of fictitious objects. Among other\nthings, it does not do justice to the widespread intuition that\nfictitious objects are created by the authors of the stories\nto which they\n belong.[28]\n",
