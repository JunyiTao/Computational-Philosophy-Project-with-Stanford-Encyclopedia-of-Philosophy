    "main_text": "Voluntary Action, Moral Responsibility, and What is \u201cUp to Us\u201d || Aristotle on character formation\n2.2 Aristotle on character formation\n\nAlthough Aristotle says that voluntary actions are subject to praise\nand blame, he does not simply identify morally responsible actions\nwith voluntary ones. Small children and animals can engage in\nvoluntary behavior, moving themselves around, using the information\nthey have about their environment, in order to get what they want.\nWhat distinguishes adult humans from small children and other animals\nis our possession of practical reason, which allows us to deliberate\nabout what to do in order to best achieve what we believe to be good\nand then to make choices on the basis of that deliberation\n(NE 3.2\u20134). Only creatures who can make these sorts of\ndeliberative choices are capable of virtue or vice, and only such\ncreatures are accountable for what they do.\n\nFurthermore, our capacity for deliberative choice allows us to shape\nour own characters, and Aristotle thinks that we need to be able to do\nso in order to be responsible for the actions that flow from those\ncharacters. In NE 3.5, Aristotle considers an argument\nagainst our responsibility for our actions that proceeds from\npsychological determinism. It goes as follows: let us suppose that a\ncareless person exceeds the speed limit because they did not notice\nthe sign posting the limit. Aristotle says that the law rightly\npunishes such cases of ignorant wrongdoing, because the person is\nresponsible for his own negligent ignorance, just as in the case of\nthe ignorant drunkard. But, the objection goes, some people just are\ncareless; they\u2019re simply the sort of people who aren\u2019t\ngoing to take care (NE 3.5 1114a3\u20134). So it\u2019s not up to\nthem not to be careless. More generally, people do what they do\nbecause they believe it gets them what is good. But what seems good to\na person is not under their control; instead, it is determined by\ntheir character (NE 3.5 1114a30\u20131114b12). If I choose to\npoison my mother, it\u2019s because I believe that doing so will be\ngood for me. But I did not choose to believe that wealth is so\nincredibly important for my well-being, and the interests of others\nand considerations of justice so negligible, that getting lots of\nmoney through undetected murder would be good for me. As Plato says in\nhis dialogue the Timaeus, nobody is willingly evil. Instead,\nthrough some combination of poor natural endowments and poor\neducation, neither of which the evil person had under their control,\nthey become vicious. So they are not to blame for their vice; rather,\nthose who nurtured them are to blame (Tim. 86d-87a).\n\nAristotle agrees that what seems good to us is determined by our\ncharacter, and that we aim at what we believe is good. There are cases\nof akrasia, or \u201cweakness of will\u201d, where a\nperson\u2019s beliefs about what is good and their desires conflict,\nand they do what they believe is bad in order to gratify their desires\n(NE 7.3). But when a person\u2019s beliefs and desires are\nin harmony\u2014as in the case of a thoroughly virtuous or vicious\nperson\u2014their actions will follow from their beliefs about and\ndesires for what seems to be good, plus their beliefs about what means\nwill achieve that apparent good. So in the case of the vicious and\nwilling murderer, while he may be able to refrain from\nmurder, he will not do so, given who he is. He will not\nchoose to go against what his beliefs and desires have set before him\nas good. For Aristotle, choice is the final step of a process of\ndeliberation, in which we work through the possible means to achieve\nour end, until we hit upon the one that we think will work best to get\nus what we wish to achieve, whereupon we choose that means and act\n(NE 3.3).\n\nBut Aristotle thinks that this does not absolve the vicious person of\nresponsibility for their actions, because they are responsible for\nmaking themselves into the person they currently are through their\npast actions. Virtue is a state of character developed through\npractice in a way analogous to how we gain craft knowledge or other\npractical skills: I become courageous by acting courageously, just as\na person becomes a good carpenter by practicing making cabinets or a\ngood basketball player by working on their free throws (NE\n2.1). But vice is also developed through a person\u2019s repeated\nactions; it\u2019s by cheating that a person makes themselves unjust\nand by engaging in drinking bouts that they become dissolute drunkards\n(NE 3.5 1114a4\u20137). Aristotle admits that some people are\nincorrigibly bad, because they have firmly fixed bad characters, and\nhence they cannot now control what appears good to them. But at one\ntime, they had the ability to change their character, and hence they\nare responsible for what now seems good to them. Aristotle compares\nsuch a person to an incurably sick person, who made themself ill\nthrough their dissolute living and their refusal to listen to their\ndoctor\u2019s orders. The sick person is responsible for their\nsickness, even though there is nothing they can do about it now; so\ntoo with the thoroughly vicious person (NE 3.5\n1114a12\u201322).\n\nIt might seem that Aristotle\u2019s response implies a vicious\nregress. My present action is caused by my present character plus my\nother psychological states, such as my beliefs. In order to be\nresponsible for this action, I must be responsible for the state of\ncharacter that in part causes it. Aristotle responds that my past\nvoluntary actions caused my present character, and so I am responsible\nfor it. But if I must be responsible for these actions in order to be\nresponsible for the character state that they cause, we ask in turn\nwhether I am responsible for the character states that caused these\nactions, and so on and so forth, until we are drawn back to factors of\nheredity and environment which I am not responsible for. In response\nto this problem, some scholars have proposed that Aristotle believes that some\ncharacter-forming actions are not caused by my past states of\ncharacter (Kane (2014), who attributes such a view to Aristotle and\nuses it as inspiration for his own view), or that he believes there\nare some breaks or \u201cfresh starts\u201d in the causal process\nleading to my present character, so that it cannot be drawn back to\npast factors that were not in my power (Furley 1967; Bobzien 2000).\nBut it is difficult to see how positing causal breaks would help make\nthe process of character formation more under the control of a person,\nand in any case, Aristotle apparently is not aware of this supposed\nproblem with his response. Instead, he seems to think that, as long as\nwe need to refer to a person\u2019s past actions in order to explain\nhow they came to be the sort of person they are, this suffices for\nshowing that they helped form their own character and it is was up to\nthem who they became.\n",
