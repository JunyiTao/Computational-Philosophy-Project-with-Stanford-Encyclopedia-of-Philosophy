    "main_text": "Epistemological Arguments\n4. Epistemological Arguments\n\nParticularists and generalists typically share a commitment to moral\nknowledge. This common ground is not strictly entailed by either view.\nFor example, proponents of Hare\u2019s universal prescriptivism will\ninsist that moral thought is principled even if, in their rejection of\nthe truth-aptness of moral language, they deny that there is moral\nknowledge. On the other side, a fictionalist might reject moral\nknowledge while insisting that the moral fiction is itself devoid of\nprincipled structure, just as the particularist insists. Nevertheless,\nboth generalists and particularists do in fact typically see moral\nthought and judgment as achieving (sometimes) significant success and\nin this context the shared commitment to moral knowledge is not\nsurprising.\n\nParticularists and generalists often treat moral knowledge as being on\na par with other types of commonly accepted knowledge. Just as we can\nknow that our internet connection is running slow, that the milk is on\nthe verge of going stale, or that our friend is annoyed by the story\njust told at his expense, so too we can know that it would be wrong\nrefuse directions to the person who is lost, that our co-worker was\ncourageous to criticize her supervisor, and that the American justice\nsystem treats many people unfairly. Because the commitment to moral\nknowledge is a shared one, many of the arguments both for and against\nparticularism have sought to use it for dialectical leverage. The\nquestions at stake include whether particularism or generalism best\nexplains our capacity to achieve moral knowledge and whether\nparticularism or generalism best models the person who has and uses\nmoral knowledge.\n\nSome moral knowledge, it is agreed, involves the transmission or\nextension of other moral knowledge already achieved. If Solomon tells\nme the treaty is unjust, I may know this by relying on his testimony.\nIf every member of the Diogenes Society whom I have met is honest,\nthen I may know that Walter, who is also a member, is honest. Here, I\nrely on an induction from my other moral knowledge. While highly\ninteresting, these types of knowledge are typically regarded as\nderivative (Zangwill 2006) and are therefore set aside in arguments\nover moral particularism. The question is what explains our most basic\nmoral knowledge. How strong an assumption can be made about our moral\nknowledge while remaining on ground common to both generalists and\nparticularists? Obviously, particularists will not grant that we have\nknowledge of moral principles, and the point of surest agreement is\nthat we sometimes know the moral status of a particular case, e.g.,\nthat this act was wrong. However, most arguments both for and against\nparticularism deploy somewhat stronger assumptions.\n\nFirst, one may make a stronger assumption about the objects of moral\nknowledge. Of special interest is the possibility that we can know\ngeneral truths about morality even while such general truths fall\nshort of counting as moral principles. For example, while\nparticularists will deny that there is any exceptionless moral\nprinciple to the effect that pain is bad, many sympathetic to\nparticularism would agree that, as a general matter, pain is bad and\nthat we can know this. On a deflationary reading, one might treat the\nclaim that pain is bad as a useful heuristic, a reminder that pain has\noften been bad in the past and may well be so in the future (Dancy\n1993). Alternatively, that pain is bad might capture an interesting\nmetaphysical fact about pain; its default status is the status of\nbeing bad. We can understand default status in terms of an explanatory\nasymmetry. When pain is not bad there must be something that explains\nwhy it is not, but when pain is bad there needn\u2019t be any further\nexplanation of what makes pain bad (Dancy 1993, 2004). Finally, one\nmight try to invest such generalizations with real explanatory power\nwhile insisting they remain exception laden. That pain is bad is a\nkind of defeasible generalization, where this amounts the claim that\npain is bad in a privileged set of worlds (Little 2000; Lance and\nLittle 2004; for critical discussion of each of these possibilities,\nsee Stangl 2006).\n\nSecond, one may make a stronger assumption about the scope of moral\nknowledge, at least for some people. Some people, one may assume, are\n(or become) especially good at acquiring moral knowledge; they have a\nmeasure of practical wisdom or expertise. Their knowledge thus readily\nextends not just to their actual circumstances but to a broad array of\nnovel circumstances as they arise. In so far as this is so, we should\nlike to have a good explanation not only of how humans acquire\nspecific knowledge but also of how they develop over time into more\ncompetent moral knowers (Bakhurst 2005, 2013).\n\nTwo models of moral knowledge predominate in defences of\nparticularism: a perceptual model and a skill based model. According\nto the perceptual model successful moral judgment is properly\nanalogous to sense perception even if it is not, literally, a form of\nsense perception (McDowell 1979, 1985; McNaughton 1988). Moral\njudgment on this view depends upon a range of sensibilities, developed\nthrough experience and acculturation. Once developed, however, one can\njust \u201csee\u201d, for example, that a certain response is\nmerited by a situation. As John McDowell puts it,\n\n\nOccasion by occasion, one knows what to do, if one does, not by\napplying universal principles, but by being a certain kind of person:\none who sees situations in a certain distinctive way. (McDowell 1979:\n350)\n\n\nSince sensibilities may be more or less refined, the perceptual model\nappears to fit well with the idea that there are both moral novices\nand experts. Whatever further account is to be given of these\nsensibilities, the resulting knowledge is not dependent upon any\ndeduction from general moral principles, at least not one\ntransparently and readily available to the knower. Generalists have\nobserved that similar perceptual metaphors seem equally apt in domains\nthat admit of principles (McKeever and Ridge 2006: ch 4). For example,\none might just \u201csee\u201d that a sentence is ungrammatical even\nif grammaticality is rule-governed. Furthermore, some who develop and\ndefend a perceptual model are not led by it to particularism (Audi\n2013). So the perceptual model of moral knowledge seems not to\nestablish particularism, but it was likely never meant to. Instead,\nthe perceptual model is intended to offer more indirect support. If\nour moral experts reliably achieve moral knowledge without\nself-consciously adverting to moral principles, then the generalist\ninherits at least some burden to explain why principles should be a\ncenterpiece of moral theorizing.\n\nTwo related constraints confront the development of the perceptual\nmodel and may threaten the particularism the model is taken to\nsupport. The first is that the model must extend to prospective and\nhypothetical cases. Particularists and generalists typically agree\nthat we sometimes have knowledge that if we were to perform an action\n(say maintain a confidence) in our actual circumstances, that action\nwould be right. This seems essential if moral knowledge is to precede\nand guide virtuous conduct. Similarly, if slightly more\ncontroversially, we sometimes have knowledge that a certain course of\nconduct would be right in some hypothetical circumstance. While one\nmight try to account for such cases by appeal to inductive reasoning\nfrom past actual cases, this is not, in fact, how proponents of the\nperceptual model have proceeded. The second constraint arises from the\nfact that moral properties are grounded in other properties. For\nexample, it barely makes sense to say that an action\u2019s wrongness\nis a brute fact about it; if wrong an action must be wrong on account\nof some otherwise specifiable features it has. While this\n\u201cbecause constraint\u201d admits of various explications, the\nbasic idea is common ground and widely thought to be a priori\n(Zangwill 2006).\n\nGeneralists argue that, once spelled out, the perceptual model is not\nthe a posteriori epistemology it might first have seemed but\ninstead commits us to a priori intuitions relating moral\nfeatures to their grounds. Particularists may grant that basic moral\nknowledge is a priori knowledge of \u201cwhat is a moral\nreason for what\u201d (Dancy 2004: 141) while maintaining that the\nobject of knowledge remains particularized and does not implicate\nprinciples. One challenge for the particularist is that \u201cwhat is\na reason for what\u201d in a particular case is contingent, and so\nthe particularist risks being committed to a priori knowledge\nof contingent truths. In his defense of particularism, Dancy has been\nwilling to embrace this apparent consequence (Dancy 2004; for\ncriticism, see McKeever and Ridge 2006). Other particularists have\nsought to avoid the implication (Leibovitz 2014).\n\nParticularists sometimes pursue a somewhat different model of moral\nknowledge, one that likens the practically wise agent to a person who\nhas a developed skill. Just how different this model is from the\nperceptual one must depend upon how each is spelled out. But whereas\nthe perceptual model directs our attention first to how the virtuous\nperson understands her situation, the skill model draws attention to\nthe knower as agent, someone who classifies actions, agents, and\nstates of affairs as falling under moral categories, who reasons to\nmoral conclusions, and ultimately puts their knowledge into outward\naction. How might this skill be understood and, relatedly, how much of\nan account of it does the particularist owe? Some particularists\n(sometimes) demur. For example, Dancy described the virtuous agent as\nsomeone possessed of a \u201ccontentless ability\u201d to discern\nwhat matters when it matters (Dancy 1993: 50). But many sympathetic to\nparticularism would want to say more (Garfield 2000; Leibovitz 2014).\nOne might liken the skill of the virtuous person to a behavioral\nability, such as the ability to ride a bicycle. While this analogy\ncould prove apt, it risks underrating the extent to which the virtuous\nperson\u2019s action is rich with judgment and reasoning and is not\nsimply a sequence of successful performance.\n\nOne way to develop the skill model is to urge that the skill of the\nvirtuous person is akin to the skill of the person with conceptual\ncompetence and then rely on Wittgensteinian rule-following\nconsiderations to urge that conceptual competence cannot be fully\nunderstood in terms of rules or principles. This approach lends itself\nto a form of particularism that is less hostile to principles. The\nclaim is not that there are no principles but that practical wisdom\ncannot be fully reduced to principles (McDowell 1979). A\nperhaps similar strategy can be pursued by focusing on principles of\nreasoning and urging that valid principles of reasoning cannot be\ntreated simply as objects of propositional knowledge akin to premises\n(Carroll 1895; Thomas 2011). One seeming consequence of these\nstrategies is that particularism it not something distinctive of\nmorality and other cognate domains. Particularism would be true\neverywhere we apply concepts or everywhere we reason. Some might\nwelcome such global particularism, but we would have lost what for\nsome was initially attractive\u2014that particularism seemed to\nidentify something distinctive (even if not unique) about morality. A\nsecond worry is that particularism may no longer pose the threat to\ntraditional moral theory that is sometimes supposed. If the\ncategorical imperative were shown to have the same status as modus\nponens, Kantians could sleep easily.\n\nAnother way to develop the skill model could urge that the skill in\nquestion is the skill of applying (or reasoning with) generalizations\nof a certain kind. Here the claim may be that moral principles (or\ngeneralizations) require judgment to apply, or are defeasible, or come\nwith implicit ceteris paribus clauses. This commits the\nparticularist to principles of a kind, while also allowing both that\nmorality is importantly distinctive and that some traditional moral\ntheorists have erred by seeking a sort of principle that is not to be\nfound. This path leads to interesting intermediate positions that are\ncertainly more friendly to principles than Dancy\u2019s particularism\nwhile at the same time concerned to emphasize the limitations of\nprinciples. For example, Richard Holton (2002) suggests that sound\nmoral principles are conditionals containing an implicit\n\u201cthat\u201ds it\u2019 clause. The dictum that lying is wrong\nis then more perspicuously expressed as the claim that if an action\namounts to lying and \u201cthat\u201ds it\u2019 then the action is\nwrong. In this context, \u201cthat\u2019s it\u201d expresses the\nidea that no other moral principle, given the facts at hand,\nsupersedes the principle that lying is wrong.\n\nA different but similar idea is developed by Mark Lance and Margaret\nLittle, who advance a model of true but defeasible moral\ngeneralizations. Here, the claim that lying is morally wrong is\nelaborated as the claim that lying is wrong under privileged or normal\nconditions. Conditions might fail to be privileged for any number of\nreasons\u2014perhaps because the murderer is at the door looking for\nyour helpful information or, less dramatically, we might be playing a\ngame in which deception is part of the fun. As this last possibility\nsuggests, Lance and Little\u2019s proposal seems more expansive than\nHolton\u2019s in so far as they allow that a moral generalization\nmight fail to govern a situation not only in the case that it is\nsuperseded by other moral principles but because the circumstances\nmight be such that the point of the moral generalization is simply\nlost. (See Little 2000 and Lance and Little 2004. For discussion of\nthe skill needed to apply generalizations see Garfield 2000 and Thomas\n2011. For discussion of reasoning with defaults see Horty 2007.) Many\nof Lance and Little\u2019s most effective examples are of generics\nlike \u201ctigers have stripes.\u201d More recently, Ravi Thakral\nhas argued that moral principles just are applications of\ngenerics (Thakral forthcoming). His work draws heavily on recent work\nin the philosophy of language and philosophy of mind on how generics\nwork. Thakral shows the explanatory power of this framework by\nemphasizing how some generics admit of far more qualification than\nothers. For example, compare \u2018mosquitos have wings\u2019 with\n\u2018mosquitos carry West Nile virus\u2019. Thakral makes good use\nof this range of generics to argue that a moral principle like\n\u2018pleasure is good\u2019 might on his model admit of far fewer\nexceptions than \u2018stealing is wrong\u2019. In a limiting case a\nmoral principle on this approach may even be exceptionless, with\n\u2018torturing babies just for fun\u2019 being like the generic\n\u2018in chess, bishops move diagonally\u2019. Thakral also provides\nsome very interesting discussion of how this bears on reasoning with\nprinciples, as well as the role of moral principles in explanation, in\nmoral knowledge and in teaching morality to children.\n\nOne interesting question for this approach is whether the skill part\nof the equation can be further explicated in terms of principles, even\nif these further principles are grasped only implicitly. This issue\nhas received significant attention from philosophers outside the\nparticularism debate who are interested in the question whether\nknowledge-how can be reduced to knowledge-that (Ryle 1946; Stanley\n2011). Perhaps surprisingly, the literature on particularism has not\n(to our knowledge) drawn significantly from that debate.\n\nSome generalists, agreeing with particularists that moral knowledge\npresupposes a sensitivity to the moral landscape and skill in\ndeploying what appear to be ceteris paribus laden principles,\nargue that such sensitivity and skill is possible only if the\nlandscape itself is sufficiently patterned (McKeever and Ridge 2006)\nThis argument is supposed to allow for holism about reasons, and so\nthe relevant patterning consists in there being a finite number of\nconsiderations that can function as reasons, and that these can be\naffected by a finite number of enablers and defeaters operating in\nregular, \u201cprincipled\u201d ways. Particular pieces of moral\nknowledge, on this argument, presuppose only \u201cdefault moral\nprinciples\u201d which specify a feature which ground reasons,\nceteris paribus. A full array of exceptionless principles,\nthe argument continues, are presupposed by practical wisdom,\ncharacterized as including a capacity for reliably acquiring moral\nknowledge in a full range of novel circumstances.\n\nSome resist this argument in its entirety on grounds that we can\nregularly gain knowledge in other areas without recourse to principles\n(Schroeder 2009). Some charge that the second stage of the argument\ndepends on overly strong assumptions about the extent of practical\nwisdom (Schroeder 2009), and that more modest forms of practical\nwisdom can be explained without recourse to exceptionless principles.\nSome argue that a proper account of hedged moral principles is enough\n(V\u00e4yrynen 2009); others prefer to see moral wisdom as a skill\nwhich, while wide ranging, can fail in utterly novel circumstances\n(Leibowitz 2014). Still others have worried that the argument relies\non inflated assumptions about what is required for justification and\nknowledge, for example that the knower must be in a position to\naffirmatively rule out any possible defeaters (Thomas 2011).\n\nA recurring charge against generalism is that it assumes an outmoded\ndeductive-nomological (D-N) account of successful explanation.\nAccording to that account, any successful explanation must take a\ndeductive structure in which a covering law is identified that,\ntogether with empirical information, could yield a conclusion\nexpressing the phenomenon to be explained. For many reasons, the D-N\nmodel is now widely thought to be misguided.\n\nOn behalf of the generalist, one might make two points. First, it is\nnot clear that a generalist argument from practical wisdom needs to\nassume that all successful explanations must conform to the\nD-N model. The argument draws upon claims about the person of (highly\nideal) practical wisdom and asks how best to explain her reliability.\nSecond, while the argument does insist that we must credit the\nvirtuous agent with at least an implicit grasp of a principle, it is\nless clear that the argument must treat this principle as functioning\nas the major premise in a deduction. Likewise, we might credit an\nagent with grasping modus ponens to explain her logical success\nwithout thereby assuming that she uses modus ponens as a premise.\n",
