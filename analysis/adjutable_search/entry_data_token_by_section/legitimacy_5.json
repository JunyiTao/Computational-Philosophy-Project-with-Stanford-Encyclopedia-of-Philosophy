    "main_text": "Sources of Political Legitimacy\n3. Sources of Political Legitimacy\n\nInsofar as legitimacy, understood normatively, determines which\npolitical institutions and which decisions made within them are\njustified or acceptable, and, in some cases, what kind of obligations\npeople who are governed by these institutions incur, there is the\nquestion of what makes political institutions and political decisions\nlegitimate. As we\u2019ll see, this question has both a normative and\na meta-normative dimension (see Peter 2023 for more on this\ndistinction). This section briefly reviews different accounts that\nhave been given of the sources of legitimacy.\n",
