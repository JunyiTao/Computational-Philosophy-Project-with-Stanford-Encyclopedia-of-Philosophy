    "main_text": "The Allocation of Organs\n3. The Allocation of Organs\n\nThe scarcity of organs creates an allocation problem. A great deal has\nbeen written in philosophy on the principles of the allocation of\nscarce resources, although not much on the allocation of organs\nspecifically (see the entries on\n distributive justice;\n equality;\n justice and access to health care).\n Unsurprisingly, many of the principles cited in official\ntransplantation allocation documents are familiar (see\n Other Internet Resources:\n TSANZ 2014; NHSBT 2013). These principles include allocating to those\nwho would benefit the most (a proxy for utility), to those who are the\nsickest (a proxy for helping the worst off), to those whose medical\ncondition will deteriorate the soonest (urgency), and to those who\nhave been waiting the longest (often linked to equity). Official\ndocuments also stress principles of non-discrimination, which are\ntaken to exclude allocating according to judgments of social worth, as\nwell as race, sex, religion etc. In practice, the principles conflict;\nthe person waiting the longest may not be the one who would gain the\nmost from a transplant, for example. So official allocation protocols\nalso have to say how the conflict between principles should be\nresolved. (For a philosophical discussion of the principles and their\napplication to organ allocation see Kamm 1993.)\n\nThis entry does not provide a full account of allocation principles\nfor organs. Rather, it aims to do three specific things. First, it\nexplains some of the features of allocation of organs that need to be\ntaken into account when applying basic principles. This section draws\nto the attention of philosophers the real-world complexity of applying\nabstract principles of allocation. Second, it discusses the problems\nof responsibility for condition and social value. These problems are\nboth ethically interesting and, while not unique to organ allocation,\nare more poignant than for other scarce resources because they often\ncannot be avoided just by making more money available. Third, it\ndescribes some transplantation-specific cases of the interaction\nbetween allocation rules and the number of organs retrieved for\ntransplantation. These cases raise doubts about the coherence of some\nactually existing allocation practices.\n",
