    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cAfrican Sage Philosophy\u201d is the name now commonly given\nto the body of thought produced by persons considered wise in African\ncommunities, and more specifically refers to those who seek a rational\nfoundation for ideas and concepts used to describe and view the world\nby critically examining the justification of those ideas and concepts.\nThe expression acquired its currency from a project conducted by the\nlate Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka (1944\u20131995), whose\nprimary aim was to establish, with evidence, that critical reflection\nupon themes of fundamental importance has always been the concern of a\nselect few in African societies. These themes involve questions\nregarding the nature of the supreme being, the concept of the person,\nthe meaning of freedom, equality, death and the belief in the\nafterlife. The evidence that Oruka collected regarding the rational\nelaboration of such themes by indigenous sages is contained in\ndialogues, many of which appear in his classic text, Sage\nPhilosophy: Indigenous Thinkers and Modern Debate on African\nPhilosophy (1990). \n",
