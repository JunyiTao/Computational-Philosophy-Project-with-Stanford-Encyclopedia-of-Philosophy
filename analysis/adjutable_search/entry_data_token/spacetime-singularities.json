It is a topic of\nongoing physical and philosophical research to clarify both the nature\nand significance of such pathologies. When it is the fundamental\ngeometry that breaks down, spacetime singularities are often viewed as\nan end, or \u201cedge\u201d, of spacetime itself. Numerous\ndifficulties, however, arise when one tries to make this notion more\nprecise. Breakdowns in other physical structures pose other problems,\njust as difficult. Our current theory of spacetime, general\nrelativity, not only allows for singularities, but tells us that they\nare unavoidable in some real-world circumstances. Thus we apparently\nneed to understand the ontology of singularities if we are to grasp\nthe nature of space and time in the actual universe. The possibility\nof singularities also carries potentially important implications for\nthe issues of physical determinism and the scope of physical laws.\n\n\nBlack holes are regions of spacetime from which nothing, not even\nlight, can escape. A typical black hole is the result of the\ngravitational force becoming so strong that one would have to travel\nfaster than light to escape its pull. Such black holes generically\ncontain a spacetime singularity at their center; thus we cannot fully\nunderstand a black hole without also understanding the nature of\nsingularities. Black holes, however, raise several additional\nconceptual problems and questions on their own. When quantum effects\nare taken into account, black holes, although they are nothing more\nthan regions of spacetime, appear to become thermodynamical entities,\nwith a temperature and an entropy. This seems to point to a deep and\nhitherto unsuspected connection among our three most fundamental\ntheories, general relativity, quantum field theory and thermodynamics.\nIt is far from clear, however, what it may mean to attribute\nthermodynamical properties to black holes. At the same time, some of\nthese thermodynamical properties of black holes now seem amenable to\ndirect testing in terrestrial laboratories by observing the behavior\nof \u201canalogue\u201d systems composed of ordinary material. This\nall raises problems about inter-theory relations, in particular about\nrelations between the \u201csame\u201d quantity as it appears in\ndifferent theories. It also bears on the meaning and status of the\nSecond Law of thermodynamics, with possible implications for\ncharacterizing a cosmological arrow of time. \n\nFinally, the evolution of black holes is apparently in conflict with\nstandard quantum evolution, for such evolution rules out the sort of\nincrease in entropy that seems to be required when black holes are\npresent. Indeed, as purely gravitational entities with striking\nquantum properties, what we know about black holes lies at the heart\nof and guides many attempts to formulate a theory of quantum gravity.\nThis has led to a debate over what seemingly fundamental physical\nprinciples are likely to be preserved in, or violated by, a full\nquantum theory of gravity. \n\nBecause so few philosophers have worked on these issues, many\nquestions and problems of great possible interest have not been\ninvestigated philosophically at all; others have had only the barest\nstarts made on them; consequently, several sections discussed in this\narticle merely raise questions and point to problems that deserve\nphilosophical attention. The field is wide open for expansive and\nintensive exploration. \n\nAll the technical material required to delve more deeply into the\nsubject of this entry can be found in any of a number of excellent\nclassic and recent sources, including: Hawking and Ellis (1973);\nGeroch and Horowitz (1979); Wald (1984, 1994); Brout et\nal (1995); Malament (2007, 2012); and Manchak (2013).

Spacetime Singularities\n\nGeneral relativity, Einstein's theory of space, time, and gravity,\nallows for the existence of singularities. Everyone agrees on this.\nWhen it comes to the question of how, precisely, singularities are to\nbe defined, however, there is widespread disagreement. Singularities\nin some way signal a breakdown of the geometry of spacetime itself,\nbut this presents an obvious difficulty in referring to a singularity\nas a \u201cthing\u201d that resides at some location in\nspacetime: without a well-behaved geometry, there can be no location.\nFor this reason, some philosophers and physicists have suggested that\nwe should not speak of \u201csingularities\u201d at all, but rather\nof \u201csingular spacetimes\u201d. In this entry, the two\nformulations will generally be treated as equivalent, but the\ndistinction will be highlighted when it becomes significant. \n\nSingularities are often conceived of metaphorically as akin to a tear\nin the fabric of spacetime. The most common attempts to define\nsingularities center on one of two core ideas that this image readily\nsuggests. The first is that a spacetime has a singularity if it\ncontains an incomplete path, one that cannot be continued\nindefinitely, but draws up short, as it were, with no possibility of\nextension. (\u201cWhere is the path supposed to go after it runs into\nthe tear? Where did it come from when it emerged from the\ntear?\u201d) The second is that a spacetime is singular just in case\nthere are points \u201cmissing from it\u201d. (\u201cWhere are the\nspacetime points that should be where the tear is?\u201d) \n\nAnother common thought, often adverted to in discussion of the two\nprimary notions, is that singular structure, whether in the form of\nmissing points or incomplete paths, must be related to pathological\nbehavior of some sort in the singular spacetime's curvature, that is,\nthe fundamental deformation of spacetime that manifests itself as\n\u201cthe gravitational field\u201d. For example, some measure of\nthe intensity of the curvature (\u201cthe strength of the\ngravitational field\u201d) may increase without bound as one\ntraverses the incomplete path. \n\nIn recent years it was realized that there is another kind of singular\nbehavior that spacetimes may manifest, distinct conceptually and\nphysically from the idea that singularities come in the form of\nincomplete curves or missing points. These are known as \u2018sudden\nsingularities\u2019, and are particularly important in cosmological\ncontexts. Besides their intrinsic interest, they also call into\nquestion much of the standard, traditional conceptions and claims made\nabout singular structure in general relativity. \n\nFinally, there is considerable disagreement over the significance of\nsingularities. Many eminent physicists believe that general\nrelativity's prediction of singular structure signals a serious\ndeficiency in the theory: singularities are an indication that the\ndescription offered by general relativity is breaking down. Others\nbelieve that singularities represent an exciting new possibility for\nphysicists to explore in astrophysics and cosmology, holding out the\npromise of physical phenomena differing so radically from any that we\nhave yet experienced as to signal, in our attempt to observe, quantify\nand understand them, a profound advance in our comprehension of the\nphysical world. \n\nEach of these issues will be considered in turn below. \n\nThe history of singular structure in general relativity is\nfascinating, with debate over it dating back to the earliest days of\nthe theory, but discussion of it is beyond the scope of this article;\nthe interested reader should consult Earman (1999), Earman and\nEisenstaedt (1999), Senovilla and Garfinkle (2015), and references\ntherein. \n1.1. Path Incompleteness\n\nWhile there are competing definitions of spacetime singularities, the\nmost central and widely accepted criterion rests on the possibility\nthat some spacetimes contain incomplete, inextendible paths. Indeed,\nthe rival definitions (in terms of missing points or curvature\npathology), as we will see, rely on the notion of path incompleteness.\n\n\nA path in spacetime is a continuous chain of events through space and\ntime. If I snap my fingers continually, without pause, then the\ncollection of snaps forms a path. The paths used in the most important\nsingularity theorems represent possible trajectories of particles and\nobservers. Such paths are known as world-lines; they consist of the\ncontinuous sequence of events instantiated by an object's existence at\neach instant of its lifetime. That the paths be incomplete and\ninextendible means, roughly speaking, that, after a finite amount of\ntime, a particle or observer following that path would \u201crun out\nof world\u201d, as it were\u2014it would hurtle into the tear in the\nfabric of spacetime and vanish. (See\n Figure 1.)\n Alternatively, a particle or observer could leap out of the tear to\nfollow such a path. While there is no logical or physical\ncontradiction in any of this, it appears on the face of it physically\nsuspect for an observer or a particle to be allowed to pop in or out\nof existence right in the middle of spacetime, so to speak\u2014if\nthat does not suffice for concluding that the spacetime is singular,\nit is difficult to imagine what else would. At the same time as this\ncriterion for singularities was first proposed, the ground-breaking\nwork predicting the existence of such pathological paths (Penrose\n1965, 1968; Hawking 1965, 1966a, 1966b, 1966c, 1966d; Geroch 1966,\n1967, 1968b, 1970; Hawking and Penrose 1970) produced no consensus on\nwhat ought to count as a necessary condition for singular structure\naccording to this criterion, and thus no consensus on a fixed\ndefinition for it. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: a tear in spacetime \n\n\nIn this context, an incomplete path in spacetime is one that is both\ninextendible and of finite proper length, which means that any\nparticle or observer traversing the path would experience only a\nfinite interval of existence that in principle cannot be continued any\nlonger. For this criterion to do the work we want it to, however, we\nwill need to limit the class of spacetimes under discussion.\nSpecifically, we shall be concerned with spacetimes that are maximally\nextended (or just \u2018maximal\u2019, for short). In effect, this\ncondition says that one's representation of spacetime is \u201cas big\nas it possibly can be\u201d. There is, from the mathematical point of\nview, no way to treat the spacetime as being a proper subset of a\nlarger, more extensive spacetime. (See\n figure 2.)\n \n\n\n\nFigure 2: a non-maximal spacetime \n\n\nIf there is an incomplete path in a spacetime, goes the thinking\nbehind the requirement, then perhaps the path is incomplete only\nbecause one has not made one's model of spacetime big enough. If one\nwere to extend the spacetime manifold maximally, then perhaps the\npreviously incomplete path could be extended into the new portions of\nthe larger spacetime, indicating that no physical pathology underlay\nthe incompleteness of the path. The inadequacy would merely have\nresided in the incomplete physical model we had been using to\nrepresent spacetime. \n\nAn example of a non-maximally extended spacetime can be easily had,\nalong with a sense of why they intuitively seem in some way or other\ndeficient. For the moment, imagine spacetime is only two-dimensional,\nand flat, like an endless sheet of paper. Now, excise from somewhere\non this plane a closed set shaped like Ingrid Bergman. Any path that\nhad passed through one of the points in the removed set is now\nincomplete. \n\nIn this case, the maximal extension of the resulting spacetime is\nobvious, and does indeed fix the problem of all such incomplete paths:\nre-incorporate the previously excised set. (See\n Figure 3.)\n The seemingly artificial and contrived nature of such examples, along\nwith the ease of rectifying them, seems to militate in favor of\nrequiring spacetimes to be maximal. Also, inextendibility is sometimes\nargued for on the grounds that there is no known physical process that\ncould cause spacetime to draw up short, as it were, and not continue\non as it could have, were it to have an extension (Clarke 1975; Ellis\nand Schmidt 1977). \n\n\n\nFigure 3: a non-maximal spacetime made\nmaximal by filling its holes \n\n\nIn recent important work, Manchak has questioned the need and even the\nreasonableness of requiring spacetimes to be maximal (i.e.,\ninextendible), pointing out problems with the condition's epistemic\nstatus (Manchak 2011), its conceptual cogency (Manchak 2016a), and its\nmetaphysical character (Manchak 2016b). Because inextendibility is the\nmost common assumption made in the physics literature when singular\nstructure is discussed, however, we will continue to assume it for the\npurposes of this discussion, Manchak's interesting arguments\nnotwithstanding. (Manchak's arguments will be discussed further in\n section 4\n below.) \n\nOnce we have established that we are interested in maximal spacetimes,\nthe next issue is what sort of path incompleteness is relevant for\nsingularities. Here we find a good deal of controversy. Criteria of\nincompleteness typically look at how some parameter naturally\nassociated with the path (such as its proper length) grows. One\ngenerally also places further restrictions on the paths that one\nconsiders\u2014for example, one may rule out paths that could be\ntraversed only by particles undergoing unbounded acceleration in a\nfinite period of time. A spacetime, then, is said to be\nsingular if it possesses a path such that the specified\nparameter associated with that path cannot increase without bound as\none traverses the entirety of the maximally extended path. The idea is\nthat the parameter at issue will serve as a marker for some manifestly\nphysical property, such as the time experienced by a particle or\nobserver, and so, if the value of that parameter remains finite along\nthe whole path, then we have run out of path in a finite amount of\ntime, as it were. We have hit an edge or a \u201ctear\u201d in\nspacetime. \n\nFor a path that is everywhere timelike, i.e., that does not\ninvolve speeds at or above that of light, it is natural to take as the\nparameter the proper time a particle or observer would experience\nalong the path, that is, the time measured along the path by a natural\nclock, such as one based on the vibrational frequency of an atom.\n(There are also natural choices that one can make for spacelike paths,\ne.g., those that consist of points at a single\n\u201ctime\u201d, and for null paths, those followed by light\nsignals; however, because the spacelike and null cases add yet another\nlevel of technical complexity, we shall not discuss them here.) The\nphysical interpretation of this sort of incompleteness for timelike\npaths is more or less straightforward: a timelike path incomplete with\nrespect to proper time in the future direction would represent the\npossible trajectory of a massive body that would never age beyond a\ncertain point in its existence. (An analogous statement can be made,\nmutatis mutandis, if the path were incomplete in the past\ndirection.) \n\nWe cannot, however, simply stipulate that a maximal spacetime is\nsingular just in case it contains paths of finite proper time that\ncannot be extended. Such a criterion would imply that even the flat\nspacetime described by special relativity is singular, which is surely\nunacceptable. This would follow because, even in flat spacetime, there\nare timelike paths with unbounded acceleration that have only a finite\nproper time and are also inextendible. \n\nThe most obvious option is to define a spacetime as singular if and\nonly if it contains incomplete, inextendible timelike geodesics,\ni.e., paths representing the possible trajectories of\ninertial observers, those in free-fall. This criterion, however, seems\ntoo permissive, in that it would count as non-singular some spacetimes\nwhose geometry seems otherwise pathological. For example, Geroch\n(1968c) describes a spacetime that is geodesically complete and yet\npossesses an incomplete timelike path of bounded total\nacceleration\u2014that is to say, an inextendible path in spacetime\ntraversable by a rocket with a finite amount of fuel, along which an\nobserver could experience only a finite amount of proper time. Surely\nthe intrepid astronaut in such a rocket, who would never age beyond a\ncertain point, but who also would never necessarily die or cease to\nexist, would have just cause to complain that something was singular\nabout this spacetime. \n\nWhen deciding whether a spacetime is singular, therefore, we want a\ndefinition that is not restricted to geodesics. We need, however, some\nway of overcoming the fact that non-singular spacetimes include\ninextendible paths of finite proper length that are not prima\nfacie pathological (e.g., flat spacetimes with\ninextendible paths of unbounded total acceleration). The most widely\naccepted solution to this problem makes use of a slightly different,\ntechnically complex notion of length, known as \u2018generalized\naffine length\u2019 (Schmidt\n 1971).[1]\n Unlike proper time, this generalized affine length depends on some\narbitrary choices. (Roughly speaking, the length will vary depending\non the coordinates one chooses to compute it; see\n note 1.)\n If the length is infinite for one such choice, however, it will be\ninfinite for all other choices. Thus the question of whether a path\nhas a finite or infinite generalized affine length is a well-defined\nquestion, and that is all we will need. \n\nThe definition that has won the most widespread\nacceptance\u2014leading Earman (1995, p. 36) to dub this the\nsemiofficial definition of singularities\u2014is the\nfollowing: \n\nA spacetime is singular if and only if it is maximal and\ncontains an inextendible path of finite generalized affine length.\n\n\nTo say that a spacetime is singular then is to say that there is at\nleast one maximally extended path that has a bounded (generalized\naffine) length. To put it another way, a spacetime is nonsingular when\nit is complete in the sense that the only reason any given path might\nnot be extendible is that it's already infinitely long (in this\ntechnical sense). \n\nThe chief problem facing this definition of singularities is that the\nphysical significance of generalized affine length is opaque, and thus\nit is unclear what the physical relevance of singularities, defined in\nthis way, might be. It does nothing, for example, to clarify the\nphysical status of the spacetime described by Geroch (geodesically\ncomplete but containing incomplete paths of bounded total\nacceleration), which it classifies as non-singular, as the\ncurve at issue indeed has infinite generalized affine length, even\nthough it has only a finite total proper time (to the future). The new\ncriterion does nothing more than sweep the troubling aspects of such\nexamples under the rug. It does not explain why we ought not to take\nsuch prima facie puzzling and troubling examples as\nphysically pathological; it merely declares by fiat that they are not.\n\n\nRecently, Manchak (2014a) proposed a condition spacetimes may satisfy,\nmanifestly relevant to the issue of what characterizes singular\nbehavior, which he calls \u2018effective completeness\u2019. The\nidea is to try to give what may be thought of as a quasi-local\ncharacterization of path\n incompleteness.[2]\n Manchak (2014a, p. 1071) describes the intended physical significance\nas follows: \u201cIf a space-time fails to be effectively complete,\nthen there is a freely falling observer who never records some\nparticular watch reading but who \u2018could have\u2019 in the sense\nthat nothing in her vicinity precludes it.\u201d This condition has\nthe pleasant property of being logically intermediate between the\ncondition of geodesic incompleteness for spacetime, on the one hand,\ngenerally conceded to be too strong to capture the general idea of\nsingular behavior (because of examples such that of Geroch 1968c,\ndiscussed above), and, on the other hand, the condition of being\nextendible, generally conceded to be too weak, for effective\ncompleteness is implied by geodesic completeness and in turn implies\ninextendibility. While this new condition appears promising as a clear\nand useful characterization of singular structure (in the sense of\npath incompleteness), and does so in a way that avoids the problems of\nphysical opacity plaguing the semi-official definition, it is too new\nand unexplored for definitive judgments to be made about it. One wants\nto know, among other things, whether it can be used to prove novel\ntheorems with the same physical depth and reach as the standard\nsingularity theorems (Penrose 1965, 1968; Hawking 1965, 1966a, 1966b,\n1966c, 1966d; Geroch 1966, 1967, 1968b, 1970; Hawking and Penrose\n1970), and whether it can shed real light on the philosophical issues\ndiscussed below in\n section 2.\n \n\nSo where does all this leave us? The consensus seems to be that, while\nit is easy in specific examples to conclude that incomplete paths of\nvarious sorts represent singular structure, no entirely satisfactory,\nstrict definition of singular structure in their terms has yet been\nformulated (Joshi 2014). As we will see in\n section 1.4\n below, moreover, spacetimes can evince entirely different kinds of\nbehavior that manifestly are singular in an important sense, and yet\nwhich are independent of path incompleteness. For a philosopher, the\nissues offer deep and rich veins for those contemplating, among other\nmatters, the role of explanatory power in the determination of the\nadequacy of physical theories, the role of metaphysics and intuition\nin the same, questions about the nature of the existence attributable\nto physical entities in spacetime and to spacetime itself, and the\nstatus of mathematical models of physical systems in the determination\nof our understanding of those systems as opposed to the mere\nrepresentation of our knowledge of them. All of these issues will be\ntouched upon in the following. \n1.2. Boundary Constructions\n\nWe have seen that one runs into difficulties if one tries to define\nsingularities as \u201cthings\u201d that have locations, and how\nsome of those difficulties can be avoided by defining singular\nspacetimes using the idea of incomplete paths. It would be desirable\nfor many reasons, however, to have a characterization of a spacetime\nsingularity in general relativity as, in some sense or other, a\nspatiotemporal \u201cplace\u201d. If one had a precise\ncharacterization of a singularity based on points that are missing\nfrom spacetime, one might then be able to analyze the structure of the\nspacetime \u201clocally at the singularity\u201d, instead of taking\ntroublesome, perhaps ill-defined, limits along incomplete paths. Many\ndiscussions of singular structure in relativistic spacetimes,\ntherefore, are premised on the idea that a singularity represents a\npoint or set of points that in some sense or other is missing from the\nspacetime manifold, that spacetime has a \u201chole\u201d or\n\u201ctear\u201d in it that we could fill in, or patch, by attaching\na boundary to it. \n\nIn trying to determine whether an ordinary web of cloth has a hole in\nit, for example, one would naturally rely on the fact that the web\nexists in space and time. In this case one can point to a hole in the\ncloth by specifying points of space at a particular moment of time not\ncurrently occupied by any of the cloth, but which would complete the\ncloth were they so occupied. When trying to conceive of a singular\nspacetime, however, one does not have the luxury of imagining it\nembedded in a larger space with respect to which one can say there are\npoints missing from it. In any event, the demand that the spacetime be\nmaximal rules out the possibility of embedding the spacetime manifold\nin any larger spacetime manifold of any ordinary sort. It would seem,\nthen, that making precise the idea that a singularity is a marker of\nmissing points ought to involve some idea of intrinsic structural\nincompleteness in the spacetime manifold rather than extrinsic\nincompleteness with respect to an external structure. \n\nThe most obvious route, especially in light of the previous\ndiscussion, and the one most often followed, is to define a spacetime\nto have points missing from it if and only if it contains incomplete,\ninextendible paths, and then try to use these incomplete paths to\nconstruct in some fashion or other new, properly situated points for\nthe spacetime, the addition of which will make the previously\ninextendible paths extendible. These constructed points would then be\nour candidate singularities. Missing points on this view would\ncorrespond to a boundary for a singular spacetime\u2014actual points\nof a (non-standard) extended spacetime at which paths incomplete in\nthe original spacetime would terminate. (We will, therefore, alternate\nbetween speaking of missing points and speaking of\nboundary points, with no difference of sense intended.) The\ngoal then is to construct this extended space using the incomplete\npaths as one's guide. \n\nNow, in trivial examples of spacetimes with missing points such as the\none offered before, flat spacetime with a closed set in the shape of\nIngrid Bergman excised from it, one does not need any technical\nmachinery to add the missing points back in. One can do it by hand.\nMany spacetimes with incomplete paths, however, do not allow missing\npoints to be attached in any obvious way by hand, as that example\ndoes. For this program to be viable, which is to say, in order to give\nsubstance to the idea that there really are points that in some sense\nought to have been included in the spacetime in the first place, we\nrequire a physically natural completion procedure that can be applied\nto incomplete paths in arbitrary spacetimes. There are several\nproposals for such a construction (Hawking 1966c, Geroch 1968a,\nSchmidt\n 1971).[3]\n\n\nSeveral problems with this kind of program make themselves felt\nimmediately. Consider, for example, a spacetime representing the final\nstate of the complete gravitational collapse of a spherically\nsymmetric body resulting in a black hole. (See\n section 3\n below for a description of black holes in general, and\n Figure 4\n for a representation of a body collapsing to form a black hole.) In\nthis spacetime, any timelike path entering the black hole will\nnecessarily be extendible for only a finite amount of proper\ntime\u2014it then \u201cruns into the singularity\u201d at the\ncenter of the black hole. In its usual presentation, however, there\nare no obvious points missing from the spacetime at all. By any\nstandard measure, as a manifold in its own right it is as complete as\nthe Cartesian plane, excepting only the existence of incomplete\ncurves, no class of which indicates by itself a place in the manifold\nat which to add a point so as to make the paths in the class complete.\nLikewise, in our own spacetime every inextendible, past-directed\ntimelike path is incomplete (and our spacetime is singular): they all\nrun into the Big Bang. Insofar as there is no moment of time at which\nthe Big Bang occurred (no moment of time at which time began, so to\nspeak), there is no point to serve as the past endpoint of such a\npath. We can speak of the cosmic epoch, the time after the big bang.\nThat makes it easy to imagine that cosmic time zero is some initial\nevent. That, however, is an illusion of our labeling. Cosmic time\n\u201czero\u201d is a label attached to no event. If instead we had\nlabeled epochs with the logarithm of cosmic time, then the imaginary\nmoment of the big bang would be assigned the label of minus infinity\nand its fictional character would be easier to accept. (One can make\nthe point a little more precise: the global structure of our universe,\nas modeled by our best cosmological theories, is essentially the same\nas a well known mathematical space, either \u211d4 or\n\ud835\udd4a3 x \u211d, which are both complete and\ninextendible as manifolds independent of any spacetime metrical\nstructure, in every reasonable sense of those terms.) \n\nEven more troublesome examples are given by topologically compact\nregions of spacetimes containing incomplete, inextendible paths, as in\na simple example due to Misner (1967). In a sense that can be made\nprecise, compact sets, from a topological point of view,\n\u201ccontain every point they could possibly be expected to\ncontain\u201d, one manifestation of which is that a compact manifold\ncannot be embedded as an open submanifold of any other manifold, a\nnecessary pre-requisite for attaching a boundary to a singular\nspacetime. It is not only with regard to the attachment of a boundary,\nhowever, that compact sets already contain all points they possibly\ncould: every sequence of points in a compact set has a subsequence\nthat converges to a point in the set. Non-convergence of sequences is\nthe standard way that one probes geometrical spaces for\n\u201cmissing\u201d points that one can add in by hand, as it were,\nto complete the space; thus, compact sets, in this natural sense,\ncannot have any missing points. \n\nPerhaps the most serious problem facing all the proposals for\nattaching boundary points to singular spacetimes, however, is that the\nboundaries necessarily end up having physically pathological\nproperties (Geroch et al. 1982): in a sense one can make\nprecise, the boundary points end up being arbitrarily\n\u201cnear\u201d to every point in the interior of the spacetime.\nAttaching boundary points to our own universe, therefore, to make the\nBig Bang into a real \u201cplace\u201d, ends up making the Big Bang\narbitrarily close to every neuron in my brain. Far from making\ntractable the idea of localizing singular structure in a physically\nfruitful way, then, all the proposals only seem to end up making the\nproblems worse. \n\nThe reaction to the problems faced by these boundary constructions is\nvaried, to say the least, ranging from blithe acceptance of the\npathology (Clarke 1993), to the attitude that there is no satisfying\nboundary construction currently available while leaving open the\npossibility of better ones in the future (Wald 1984), to not even\nmentioning the possibility of boundary constructions when discussing\nsingular structure (Joshi 1993, 2007b, 2014), to rejection of the need\nfor such constructions at all (Geroch et al. 1982; Curiel\n1999). \n\nNonetheless, many eminent physicists seem convinced that general\nrelativity stands in need of such a construction, and have exerted\nextraordinary efforts in trying to devise one. This fact raises\nseveral philosophical problems. Though physicists sometimes offer as\nstrong motivation the possibility of gaining the ability to analyze\nsingular phenomena locally in a mathematically well-defined manner,\nthey more often speak in terms that strongly suggest they suffer a\nmetaphysical itch that can be scratched only by the sharp point of a\nlocalizable, spatiotemporal entity serving as the locus of their\ntheorizing. Even were such a construction forthcoming, however, what\nsort of physical and theoretical status could accrue to these missing\npoints? They would not be idealizations of a physical system in any\nordinary sense of the term, since they would not represent a\nsimplified model of a system formed by ignoring various of its\nphysical features, as, for example, one may idealize the modeling of a\nfluid by ignoring its viscosity. Neither would they seem necessarily\nto be only convenient mathematical fictions, as, for example, are the\nphysically impossible dynamical evolutions of a system one integrates\nover in the variational derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations. To\nthe contrary, as we have remarked, many physicists and philosophers\nseem eager to find such a construction for the purpose of bestowing\nsubstantive and clear ontic status on singular structure. What sorts\nof theoretical entities, then, could they be, and how could they serve\nin physical theory? \n\nWhile the point of this project may seem at bottom identical to the\npath-incompleteness account discussed in\n section 1.1,\n insofar as singular structure will be defined by the presence of\nincomplete, inextendible paths, there is a crucial conceptual and\nlogical difference between the two. Here, the existence of the\nincomplete path does not constitute the singular structure, but rather\nserves only as a marker for the presence of singular structure in the\nsense of missing points: the incomplete path is incomplete because it\n\u201cruns into a hole\u201d in the spacetime that, were it filled,\nwould allow the path to be continued; this hole is the singular\nstructure, and the points constructed to fill it constitute its locus.\nIndeed, every known boundary construction relies on the existence of\nincomplete paths to \u201cprobe\u201d the spacetime, as it were,\nlooking for \u201cplaces\u201d where boundary points should be\nappended to the spacetime; the characterization of singular structure\nby incomplete paths seems, therefore, logically, perhaps even\nconceptually, prior to that by boundary points, at least, again, for\nall known constructions of boundary points. \n\nCurrently, there seems to be even less consensus on how (and whether)\none should define singular structure based on the idea of missing\npoints than there is regarding definitions based on path\nincompleteness. Moreover, this project also faces even more technical\nand philosophical problems. For these reasons, path incompleteness is\ngenerally considered the default definition of singularities. For the\nremainder of this article, therefore, singular structure will be\nassumed to be characterized by incomplete, inextendible paths, with\nthe exception of the discussion of\n section 1.4\n below. \n\nThere is, however, one special case in which it seems a boundary can\nbe placed on singular spacetimes in such a way as to localize the\nsingularity in a physically meaningful way: for so-called conformal\nsingularities. Their properties are discussed at the end of\n section 1.3,\n and their physical and philosophical significance explored in more\ndetail in\n section 7.\n \n1.3. Curvature Pathology\n\nWhile path incompleteness seems to capture an important aspect of the\nintuitive picture of singular structure, it completely ignores another\nseemingly integral aspect of it: curvature pathology. If there are\nincomplete paths in a spacetime, it seems that there should be a\nreason that the path cannot go further. The most obvious candidate\nexplanation of this sort is that something going wrong with the\ndynamical structure of the geometry of spacetime, which is to say,\nwith the curvature of the spacetime. This suggestion is bolstered by\nthe fact that local measures of curvature do in fact blow up as one\napproaches the singularity of a standard black hole or the Big Bang\nsingularity. There is, however, one problem with this line of thought:\nno species of curvature pathology we know how to define is either\nnecessary or sufficient for the existence of incomplete paths. (For a\ndiscussion of foundational problems attendant on attempts to define\nsingularities based on curvature pathology, see Curiel 1999; for a\nrecent survey of technical issues, see Joshi 2014.) \n\nTo make the notion of curvature pathology more precise, we will use\nthe manifestly physical idea of tidal force. Tidal force is generated\nby the difference in intensity of the gravitational field at\nneighboring points of spacetime. For example, when you stand, your\nhead is farther from the center of the Earth than your feet, so it\nfeels a (practically negligible) smaller pull downward than your feet.\n\n Tidal forces are a physical manifestation of spacetime curvature, and\none gets direct observational access to curvature by measuring the\nresultant relative difference in accelerations of neighboring test\nbodies. For our purposes, it is important that in regions of extreme\ncurvature tidal forces can grow without bound. \n\nIt is perhaps surprising that the state of motion of an object as it\ntraverses an incomplete path (e.g., whether it is\naccelerating or spinning) can be decisive in determining its physical\nresponse to curvature pathology. Whether an object is spinning or not,\nfor example, or accelerating slightly in the direction of motion, may\ndetermine whether the object gets crushed to zero volume along such a\npath or whether it survives (roughly) intact all the way along it, as\nshown by examples offered by Ellis and Schmidt (1977). Indeed, the\neffect of the observer's state of motion on his or her experience of\ntidal forces can be even more pronounced than this. There are examples\nof spacetimes in which an observer cruising along a certain kind of\npath would experience unbounded tidal forces and so be torn apart,\nwhile another observer, in a certain technical sense approaching the\nsame limiting point as the first observer, accelerating and\ndecelerating in just the proper way, would experience a perfectly\nwell-behaved tidal force, though she would approach as near as she\nlikes to the other fellow who is in the midst of being ripped to\n shreds.[4]\n\n\nThings can get stranger still. There are examples of incomplete\ngeodesics contained entirely within a well-defined, bounded region of\na spacetime, each having as its limiting point an honest-to-goodness\npoint of spacetime, such that an observer freely falling along such a\npath would be torn apart by unbounded tidal forces; it can easily be\narranged in such cases, however, that a separate observer, who\nactually travels through the limiting point, will experience perfectly\nwell-behaved tidal\n forces.[5]\n Here we have an example of an observer being ripped apart by\nunbounded tidal forces right in the middle of spacetime, as it were,\nwhile other observers cruising peacefully by could reach out to touch\nhim or her in solace during the final throes of agony. This example\nalso provides a nice illustration of the inevitable difficulties\nattendant on attempts to localize singular structure in the senses\ndiscussed in\n section 1.2.\n \n\nIt would seem, then, that curvature pathology as characterized based\non the behavior of tidal forces is not in any physical sense a\nwell-defined property of a region of spacetime simpliciter.\nWhen we consider the physical manifestations of the curvature of\nspacetime, the motion of the device that we use to probe a region (as\nwell as the nature of the device) becomes crucially important for the\nquestion of whether pathological behavior manifests itself. This fact\nraises questions about the nature of quantitative measures of\nproperties of entities in general relativity, and what ought to count\nas observable, in the sense of reflecting the underlying physical\nstructure of spacetime. Because apparently pathological phenomena may\noccur or not depending on the types of measurements one is performing,\nit seems that purely geometrical pathology does not necessarily\nreflect anything about the state of spacetime itself, or at least not\nin any localizable way. What then does it reflect, if anything? Much\nwork remains to be done by both physicists and by philosophers in this\narea, i.e., the determination of the nature of physical\nquantities in general relativity and what ought to count as an\nobservable with intrinsic physical significance. See Bertotti (1962),\nBergmann (1977), Rovelli (1991, 2001 in\n Other Internet Resources, henceforth OIR,\n 2002), Curiel (1999) and Manchak (2009a) for discussion of many\ndifferent topics in this area, approached from several different\nperspectives. \n\nThere is, however, one form of curvature pathology associated with a\nparticular form of an apparently important class of singularities that\nrecently has been clearly characterized and analyzed, that associated\nwith so-called conformal singularities, also sometimes called\nisotropic singularities (Goode and Wainright 1985; Newman 1993a,\n1993b; Tod 2002). The curvature pathology of this class of\nsingularities can be precisely pinpointed: it occurs solely in the\nconformal part of the curvature; thus, what is singular in one\nspacetime will not necessarily be so in a conformally equivalent\n spacetime.[6]\n This property allows for a boundary to be attached to the singular\nspacetime in a way that seems to be physically meaningful (Newman\n1993a, 1993b; Tod 2002). Many physicists hold that, in a sense that\ncan be made precise, all \u201cpurely gravitational degrees of\nfreedom\u201d in general relativity are encoded in the conformal\nstructure (Penrose 1979; Gomes et al. 2011). These\nproperties, along with the fact that the Big Bang singularity almost\ncertainly seems to be of this form, make conformal singularities\nparticularly important for the understanding and investigation of many\nissues of physical and philosophical interest in contemporary\ncosmology, as discussed below in\n section 7.\n \n1.4. Non-Standard Singularities\n\nIn 2004, it was discovered that general relativity admits even more\nkinds of singularities than those known before, so-called\n\u2018sudden singularities\u2019 (Barrow 2004a, 2004b). The\ncharacterization of this kind of singularity has, so far, been\nconfined to the context of cosmological models, including essentially\nall spacetimes whose matter content consists of homogeneous perfect\nfluids and a very wide class of spacetimes consisting of inhomogeneous\nfluids. The dynamics of those cosmological models is largely governed\nby the behavior of the cosmological expansion factor, a measure of the\nrelative sizes of local regions of space (not spacetime) at different\ncosmological times. In an expanding spacetime, such as the one we\nbelieve ourselves to live in, the expansion factor continually\nincreases, having \u201cstarted from zero at the Big Bang\u201d. If\nthe universe's expansion stops, and the net gravitational effect on\ncosmological scales results in the universe's collapsing in on itself,\nthis would be marked by a continual decrease in the expansion factor,\neventuating in a Big Crunch singularity as the expansion factor\nasymptotically approached zero. The remaining dynamics of these\ncosmological models is encoded in the behavior of the Hubble\nparameter, a natural measure of the rate of change of the expansion\nfactor. A sudden singularity, then, is defined by the divergence of a\ntime derivative of the expansion factor or the Hubble parameter,\nthough the factor or parameter itself remains finite. \n\nBecause important physical quantities, such as spatial pressure of the\ncosmological fluid, are proportional to such time derivatives, the\nphysical interpretation of sudden singularities is often, in at least\none sense, perspicuous: depending on the time derivative that\ndiverges, a sudden singularity can mark the divergence of a physically\nimportant quantity such as pressure, within a finite interval of\nproper time (Catto\u00ebn and Visser 2005; Cotsakis and Klaoudatou\n2005; Fern\u00e1ndez-Jambrina 2014; Jim\u00e9nez et\nal. 2016). In such cases, it may happen that the mass-density\nof the fluid itself, the expansion factor and its first derivative,\nand even the Hubble parameter and its first derivative, all remain\nfinite: only the pressure (and so the second derivative of the\nexpansion factor) diverges. Because the physical significance of\nquantities such as pressure is thought to be unambiguous, this feature\nof sudden singularities stands in marked contrast to the problems of\nphysical interpretation that plague the standard type of singularity,\ndiscussed in\n section 1.3.\n \n\nOf most interest, however, is the way that sudden singularities may\ndiffer in an even more fundamental way from standard singularities:\nthere need be no path-incompleteness associated with them\n(Fern\u00e1ndez-Jambrina and Lazkoz 2004, 2007). In effect, although\nthe values of some physically important quantities diverge, the metric\nitself remains well defined, allowing curves \u201crunning\ninto\u201d the pathological point to continue through it. Indeed,\npoint particles passing through the sudden singularity would not even\nnotice the pathology, as only tidal forces may diverge (and not even\nall sudden singularities involve divergence of those): point\nparticles, having no extension, cannot experience tidal force. If one\nwants to count sudden singularities as true singularities\u2014and\nthere seems every reason to do so\u2014then this would put the nail\nin the coffin for the idea that singularities always can or should be\nassociated with \u201cmissing\n points\u201d.[7]\n\n\nAlthough the discovery of sudden singularities has reinvigorated the\nstudy of singular spacetimes in the physics community (Cotsakis 2007),\nthey remain so far almost entirely unexamined by the philosophy\ncommunity. Nonetheless, they raise questions of manifest philosophical\ninterest and import. The fact that they are such radically different\nstructures from all other previously known kinds of singularity, for\nexample, raises methodological questions about how to understand the\nmeaning of terms in physical theories when those terms refer to\nstructurally quite different but obviously still intimately related\nphenomena\u2014the reasons for thinking of them as singularities are\ncompelling, even though they violate essentially every standard\ncondition known for characterizing singularities. \n\nAnother unusual kind of singularity characterized only recently\ncharacterized deserves mention here, because of its possible\nimportance in cosmology. The physical processes that seem to eventuate\nin most known kinds of singular structure involve the unlimited\nclumping together of matter, as in collapse singularities associated\nwith black holes, and the Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities of\nstandard cosmological models. A big rip, contrarily, occurs\nwhen the expansion of matter increasingly accelerates without bound in\na finite amount of proper time (Caldwell 2002; Caldwell et\nal. 2003; Chimento and Lazkov 2004; Dabrowski 2006;\nFern\u00e1ndez-Jambrina 2014). Rather than the volume of spacetime\nshrinking to zero, its volume increases without bound\u2014spacetime\nliterally tears itself apart, not even fundamental particles being\nable to maintain their structural unity and integrity (Chimento and\nLazkoz 2004; Fern\u00e1ndez-Jambrina 2014). Again, standard concepts\nand arguments about singularities characterized as incomplete paths do\nnot seem easily applicable here. Although big rips do have incomplete\npaths associated with them as well as curvature pathology, they are of\nsuch radically different kinds as to prima facie warrant\nseparate analysis. \n\nRecent work, codified by Harada et al. (2018), shows just how\ndifferent such cosmological singularities can be. For homogeneous\ncosmological models filled with perfect fluids with a linear equation\nof state\u2014the standard cosmological model\u2014certain values of\nthe barotropic index yield past, future, or past and future big rips\nthat are such that every timelike geodesic runs into them, but every\nnull geodesic avoids them. (See\n note 7\n for an explanation of the barotropic index.) In other words, any body\ntraveling more slowly than light will run into the singularity, but\nevery light ray will escape to infinity. This is not a situation that\nlends itself to easy and perspicuous physical interpretation. \n2. The Significance of Singularities\n\nWhen considering the implications of spacetime singularities, it is\nimportant to note that we have good reasons to believe that the\nspacetime of our universe is singular. In the late 1960s, Penrose,\nGeroch, and Hawking proved several singularity theorems, using path\nincompleteness as a criterion (Penrose 1965, 1968; Hawking 1965,\n1966b, 1966c, 1966d; Geroch 1966, 1967, 1968b, 1970; Hawking and\nPenrose 1970). These theorems showed that if certain physically\nreasonable premises were satisfied, then in certain circumstances\nsingularities could not be avoided. Notable among these conditions is\nthe positive energy condition, which captures the idea that energy is\nnever negative. These theorems indicate that our universe began with\nan initial singularity, the Big Bang, approximately 14 billion years\nago. They also indicate that in certain circumstances (discussed\nbelow) collapsing matter will form a black hole with a central\nsingularity. According to our best current cosmological theories,\nmoreover, two of the likeliest scenarios for the end of the universe\nis either a global collapse of everything into a Big Crunch\nsingularity, or the complete and utter diremption of everything, down\nto the smallest fundamental particles, in a Big Rip singularity. (See\nJoshi 2014 for a recent survey of singularities in general, and Berger\n2014 for a recent survey of the different kinds of singularities that\ncan occur in cosmological models.) \n\nShould these results lead us to believe that singularities are real?\nMany physicists and philosophers resist this conclusion. Some argue\nthat singularities are too repugnant to be real. Others argue that the\nsingular behavior at the center of black holes and at the beginning\n(and possibly the end) of time indicates the limit of the domain of\napplicability of general relativity. Some are inclined to take general\nrelativity at its word, however, and simply accept its prediction of\nsingularities as a surprising but perfectly consistent account of the\npossible features of the geometry of our world. (See Curiel 1999 and\nEarman 1995, 1996 for discussion and comparison of these opposing\npoints of view.) In this section, we review these and related problems\nand the possible responses to them. \n2.1. Definitions and Existence of Singularities\n\nLet us summarize the results of\n section 1:\n there is no commonly accepted, strict definition of singularity;\nthere is no physically reasonable characterization of missing points;\nthere is no necessary connection between singular structure, at least\nas characterized by the presence of incomplete paths, and the presence\nof curvature pathology; and there is no necessary connection between\nother kinds of physical pathology (such as divergence of pressure) and\npath incompleteness. \n\nWhat conclusions should be drawn from this state of affairs? There\nseem to be two basic kinds of response, illustrated by the views of of\nClarke (1993) and Earman (1995) on the one hand, and those of Geroch\net al. (1982) and Curiel (1999) on the other. The former\nholds that the mettle of physics and philosophy demands that we find a\nprecise, rigorous and univocal definition of singularity. On this\nview, the host of philosophical and physical questions surrounding\ngeneral relativity's prediction of singular structure would best be\naddressed with such a definition in hand, so as better to frame and\nanswer these questions with precision, and thus perhaps find other,\neven better questions to pose and attempt to answer. The latter view\nis perhaps best summarized by a remark of Geroch et al.\n(1982): \u201cThe purpose of a construction [of \u2018singular\npoints\u2019], after all, is merely to clarify the discussion of\nvarious physical issues involving singular space-times: general\nrelativity as it stands is fully viable with no precise notion of\n\u2018singular points\u2019.\u201d On this view, the specific\nphysics under investigation in any particular situation should dictate\nwhich definition of singularity to use in that situation if, indeed,\nany at all. \n\nIn sum, the question becomes the following: is there a need for a\nsingle, blanket definition of singularity or does the urge for one\nbetray only an old Aristotelian, essentialist prejudice? This question\nhas obvious connections to the broader question of natural kinds in\nscience. One sees debates similar to those canvassed above when one\ntries to find, for example, a strict definition of biological species.\nClearly, part of the motivation for searching for a single\nexceptionless definition is the impression that there is some real\nfeature of the world (or at least of our spacetime models) that we can\nhope to capture precisely. Further, we might hope that our attempts to\nfind a rigorous and exceptionless definition will help us to better\nunderstand the feature itself. Nonetheless, it is not clear why we\nshould not be happy with a variety of types of singular structure,\ntaking the permissive attitude that none should be considered the\n\u201cright\u201d definition of singularities, but each has its\nappropriate use in context. \n\nEven without an accepted, strict definition of singularity for\nrelativistic spacetimes, the question can be posed: what would it mean\nto ascribe existence to singular structure under any of the available\nopen possibilities? It is not far-fetched to think that answers to\nthis question may bear on the larger question of the existence of\nspacetime points in general (Curiel 1999, 2016; Lam 2007). (See the\nentries\n The Hole Argument\n and\n Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion\n for discussions of the question of the existence of spacetime\nitself.) \n\nIt would be difficult to argue that an incomplete path in a maximal\nrelativistic spacetime does not exist in at least some sense of the\nterm. It is not hard to convince oneself, however, that the\nincompleteness of the path does not exist at any particular\npoint of the spacetime in the same way, say, as this glass of beer\nexists at this point of spacetime. If there were a point on the\nmanifold where the incompleteness of the path could be localized,\nsurely that would be the point at which the incomplete path\nterminated. But if there were such a point, then the path could be\nextended by having it pass through that point. It is perhaps this fact\nthat lies behind much of the urgency surrounding the attempt to define\nsingular structure as missing points. \n\nThe demand that singular structure be localized at a particular place\nbespeaks an old Aristotelian substantivalism that invokes the maxim,\n\u201cTo exist is to exist in space and time\u201d (Earman 1995, p.\n28). Aristotelian substantivalism here refers to the idea\ncontained in Aristotle's contention that everything that exists is a\nsubstance and that all substances can be qualified by the Aristotelian\ncategories, two of which are location in time and location in space.\nSuch a criterion, however, may be inappropriate for features and\nproperties of spacetime itself. Indeed, one need not consider anything\nso outr\u00e9 as incomplete, inextendible paths in order to\nproduce examples of entities that seem undeniably to exist in some\nsense of the term or other, and yet which cannot have any even vaguely\ndetermined location in time and space predicated of them. Several\nessential features of a relativistic spacetime, singular or not,\ncannot be localized in the way that an Aristotelian substantivalist\nwould demand. For example, the Euclidean (or non-Euclidean) nature of\na space is not something with a precise location. (See Butterfield\n2006 for discussion of these issues.) Likewise, various spacetime\ngeometrical structures (such as the metric, the affine structure, the\ntopology, etc.) cannot be localized in the way that the Aristotelian\nwould demand, whether that demand be for localization at a point,\nlocalization in a precisely determinate region, or even just\nlocalization in a vaguely demarcated region. The existential status of\nsuch entities vis-\u00e0-vis more traditionally considered\nobjects is an open and largely ignored issue (Curiel 1999, 2016;\nButterfield 2006). Because of the way the issue of singular structure\nin relativistic spacetimes ramifies into almost every major open\nquestion in relativistic physics today, both physical and\nphilosophical, it provides a peculiarly rich and attractive focus for\nthese sorts of questions. \n\nAn interesting point of comparison, in this regard, would be the\nnature of singularities in other theories of gravity besides general\nrelativity. Weatherall's (2014) characterization of singularities in\ngeometrized Newtonian gravitational theory, therefore, and his proof\nthat the theory accommodates their prediction, may serve as a possible\ntesting ground for ideas and arguments on these issues. \n\nMany of these questions, in the end, turn upon the issue of what\nconstitutes \u201cphysically reasonable\u201d spacetime structure.\nGeneral relativity admits spacetimes exhibiting a vast and variegated\nmenagerie of structures and behaviors, even over and above\nsingularities, that most physicists and philosophers would consider,\nin some sense or other, not reasonable possibilities for physical\nmanifestation in the actual world. But what is to count as\n\u201creasonable\u201d here: who is to decide, and on what basis\n(Curiel 1999)? Manchak (2011) has argued that there cannot be purely\nempirical grounds for ruling out the seemingly unpalatable structures,\nfor there always exist spacetimes that are, in a precise sense,\nobservationally indistinguishable from our own (Malament 1977; Manchak\n2009a) that have essentially any set of properties one may stipulate.\nNorton (2011) argues that this constitutes a necessary failure of\ninductive reasoning in cosmology, no matter what one's account of\ninduction. Butterfield (2012) discusses the relation of Manchak's\nresults to standard philosophical arguments about under-determination\nof theory by data. \n\nThe philosopher of science interested in the definition and status of\ntheoretical terms in scientific theories has at hand here a rich\npossible case-study, enlivened by the opportunity to watch eminent\nscientists engaged in fierce, ongoing debate over the definition of a\nterm\u2014indeed, over the feasibility of and even need for defining\nit\u2014that lies at the center of attempts to unify our most\nfundamental physical theories, general relativity and quantum field\ntheory. \n2.2. The Breakdown of General Relativity?\n\nAt the heart of all of our conceptions of a spacetime singularity is\nthe notion of some sort of failure: a path that disappears, points\nthat are torn out, spacetime curvature or some other physical quantity\nsuch as pressure whose behavior becomes pathological. Perhaps the\nfailure, though, lies not in the spacetime of the actual world (or of\nany physically possible world), but rather in our theoretical\ndescription of the spacetime. That is, perhaps we should not think\nthat general relativity is accurately describing the world when it\nposits singular structure\u2014it is the theory that breaks down, not\nthe physical structure of the world. \n\nIndeed, in most scientific arenas, singular behavior is viewed as an\nindication that the theory being used is deficient, at least in the\nsense that it is not adequate for modeling systems in the regime where\nsuch behavior is predicted (Berry 1992). It is therefore common to\nclaim that general relativity, in predicting that spacetime is\nsingular, is predicting its own demise, and that classical\ndescriptions of space and time break down at black hole singularities\nand the Big Bang, and all the rest (Hawking and Ellis 1973; Hawking\nand Penrose 1996). Such a view denies that singularities are real\nfeatures of the actual world, and rather asserts that they are merely\nartifacts of our current, inevitably limited, physical theories,\nmarking the regime where the representational capacities of the theory\nat issue breaks down. This attitude is widely adopted with regard to\nmany important cases, e.g., the divergence of the Newtonian\ngravitational potential for point particles, the singularities in the\nequations of motion of classical electromagnetism for point electrons,\nthe singular caustics in geometrical optics, and so on. No one\nseriously believes that singular behavior in such models in those\nclassical theories represents truly singular behavior in the physical\nworld. We should, the thought goes, treat singularities in general\nrelativity in the same way. \n\nOne of the most common arguments that incomplete paths and non-maximal\nspacetimes are physically unacceptable, and perhaps the most\ninteresting one, coming as it does from physicists rather than from\nphilosophers, invokes something very like the Principle of Sufficient\nReason: if whatever creative force responsible for spacetime could\nhave continued on to create more of it, what possible reason could\nthere have been for it to have stopped at any particular point\n(Penrose 1969; Geroch\n 1970)?[8]\n An opponent of this view could respond that it implicitly relies on a\ncertain picture of physics that may not sit comfortably with general\nrelativity, that of the dynamical evolution of a system. An advocate\nof this viewpoint would argue that, from a point of view natural for\ngeneral relativity, spacetime does not evolve at all. It just sits\nthere, once and for all, as it were, a so-called block universe\n(Putnam 1967; the entries\n Time Machines,\n Time Travel and\n Being and Becoming in Modern Physics).\n If it happens to sit there non-maximally, well, so be it. This kind\nof response, however, has problems of its own, such as with the\nrepresentation of our subjective experience, which seems inextricably\ntied up with ideas of evolution and change. Those sorts of problem,\nhowever, do not seem peculiar to this dispute, but arise from the\ncharacter of general relativity itself: \u201cdynamical\nevolution\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d are subtle and problematic\nconcepts in the theory no matter what viewpoint one takes (Stein 1968,\n1970, 1991). \n\nOne can produce other metaphysical arguments against the view that\nspacetime must be maximal. To demand maximality may lead to Buridan's\nAss problems, for it can happen that global extensions exist in which\none of a given set of incomplete curves is extendible, but no global\nextension exists in which every curve in the set is\nextendible (Ellis and Schmidt 1977). Also, there may exist several\nphysically quite different global extensions: the spacetime covered by\nthe usual Schwarzschild coordinates outside the Schwarzschild radius,\nfor instance, can be extended analytically to Kruskal-Schwarzschild\nspacetime with a spacetime \u201ctunnel\u201d or\n\u201cbridge\u201d to an otherwise disconnected part of the universe\n(Hawking and Ellis 1973, sec. 5.5), or it can be extended to a\nsolution representing the interior of a massive spherical body. It is,\nin any event, difficult to know what to make of the invocation of such\novertly metaphysical considerations in arguments in this most hard of\nall hard sciences. See Curiel (1999) and Earman (1996) for critical\nsurvey of such arguments, and Doboszewski (2017) for a recent\ncomprehensive survey of all these issues, including discussion of the\nmost recent technical results. \n\nA common hope is that when quantum effects are taken into account in\nthe vicinity of such extreme conditions of curvature where\nsingularities are predicted by the classical theory, the singular\nnature of the spacetime geometry will be suppressed, leaving only well\nbehaved spacetime structure. Advocates of various programs of quantum\ngravity also argue that in such a complete, full theory, singularities\nof the kinds discussed here will not appear. Recent important work by\nWall (2013a, 2013b) shows that these hopes face serious problems. We\npick up these issues below, in\n section 5.4.4\n and\n section 6.3\n respectively, for it is in those contexts that many of the explicit\ndebates play out over the limits of general relativity. \n\nIn any event, it is well to keep in mind that, even if singularities\nare observed one day, and we are able to detect regularity in their\nbehavior of a sort that lends itself to formulation as physical law,\nit seems likely that this law will not be a consequence of general\nrelativity but will rather go beyond its bounds in radical ways, for,\nas we have seen, general relativity by itself does not have any\nmechanism for constraining the possible behavior that singular\nstructure of various types may manifest. It is perhaps just this\npossibility that excites a frisson of pleasure in those of the\nlibertine persuasion at the same time as it makes the prudish shudder\nwith revulsion. \n\nFor a philosopher, the issues mooted here offer deep and rich veins\nfor those contemplating, among other matters: the role of explanatory\npower in the assessment of physical theories; the interplay among\nobservation, mathematical models, physical intuition and metaphysical\npredilection in the genesis of scientific knowledge; questions about\nthe nature of the existence attributable to physical entities in\nspacetime and to spacetime itself; and the role of mathematical models\nof physical systems in our understanding of those systems, as opposed\nto their role in the mere representation of our knowledge of them.\n\n3. Black Holes\n3.1. Standard Definition and Properties\n\nThe simplest picture of a black hole is that of a system whose gravity\nis so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Systems\nof this type are already possible in the familiar Newtonian theory of\ngravity. The escape velocity of a body is the velocity at which an\nobject would have to begin to travel to escape the gravitational pull\nof the body and continue flying out to infinity, without further\nacceleration. Because the escape velocity is measured from the surface\nof an object, it becomes higher if a body contracts and becomes more\ndense. (Under such contraction, the mass of the body remains the same,\nbut its surface gets closer to its center of mass; thus the\ngravitational force at the surface increases.) If the object were to\nbecome sufficiently dense, the escape velocity could therefore exceed\nthe speed of light, and light itself would be unable to escape. \n\nThis much of the argument makes no appeal to relativistic physics, and\nthe possibility of such Newtonian black holes was noted in the late\n18th Century by Michell (1784) and Laplace (1796, part ii,\np. 305). These Newtonian\nobjects, however, do not precipitate the same sense of crisis as do\nrelativistic black holes. Although light emitted at the surface of the\ncollapsed body cannot escape, a rocket with powerful enough motors\nfiring could still push itself free. It just needs to keep firing its\nrocket engines so that the thrust is equal to or slightly greater than\nthe gravitational force. Since in Newtonian physics there is no upper\nbound on possible velocities, moreover, one could escape simply by\nbeing fired off at an initial velocity greater than that of light.\n\n\nTaking relativistic considerations into account, however, we find that\nblack holes are far more exotic entities. Given the usual\nunderstanding that relativity theory rules out any physical process\npropagating faster than light, we conclude that not only is light\nunable to escape from such a body: nothing would be able to\nescape this gravitational force. That includes the powerful rocket\nthat could escape a Newtonian black hole. Further, once the body has\ncollapsed down to the point where its escape velocity is the speed of\nlight, no physical force whatsoever could prevent the body from\ncontinuing to collapse further, for that would be equivalent to\naccelerating something to speeds beyond that of light. Thus once this\ncritical point of collapse is reached, the body will get ever smaller,\nmore and more dense, without limit. It has formed a relativistic black\nhole. Here is where the intimate connection between black holes and\nsingularities appears, for general relativity predicts that, under\nphysically reasonable and generic conditions, a spacetime singularity\nwill form from the collapsing matter once the critical point of\nblack-hole formation is reached (Penrose 1965; Schoen and Yau 1983;\nWald 1984). \n\nFor any given body, this critical stage of unavoidable collapse occurs\nwhen the object has collapsed to within its so-called Schwarzschild\nradius, which is proportional to the mass of the body. Our sun has a\nSchwarzschild radius of approximately three kilometers; the Earth's\nSchwarzschild radius is a little less than a centimeter; the\nSchwarzschild radius of your body is about 10-27\ncm\u2014ten times smaller than a neutrino and 1010 times\nsmaller than the scale characteristic of quark interactions. This\nmeans that if you could collapse all the Earth's matter down to a\nsphere the size of a pea, it would form a black hole. \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that one does not need an extremely high\ndensity of matter to form a black hole if one has enough mass. If all\nthe stars in the Milky Way gradually aggregate towards the galactic\ncenter while keeping their proportionate distances from each other,\nthey will all fall within their joint Schwarzschild radius and so form\na black hole long before they are forced to collide. Or if one has a\ncouple hundred million solar masses of water at its standard density\n(1 gm/cm3)\u2014so occupying in total a region of about\n1027 cubic kilometers, the approximate size of the smallest\nsphere containing the orbit of Uranus\u2014it will be contained\nwithin its Schwarzschild radius. (In this case, of course, the water\nwould indeed eventually collapse on itself to arbitrarily high\ndensities.) Some supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies\nare thought to be even more massive than the example of the water, at\nseveral billion solar masses, though in these cases the initial\ndensity of the matter thought to have formed the black holes was\nextraordinarily high. \n\nAccording to the standard definition (Hawking and Ellis 1973; Wald\n1984), the event horizon of a black hole is the surface formed by the\npoints of no return. That is, it is the boundary of the collection of\nall events in the spacetime closest to the singularity at which a\nlight signal can still escape to the external universe. Everything\nincluding and inside the event horizon is the black hole itself. (See\n section 3.4\n for a discussion of different ways to define a black hole, and the\nproblems these competing definitions raise.) For a standard\n(uncharged, non-rotating) black hole, the event horizon lies at the\nSchwarzschild radius. A flash of light that originates at an event\ninside the black hole will not be able to escape, but will instead end\nup in the central singularity of the black hole. A light flash\noriginating at an event outside of the event horizon will escape\n(unless it is initially pointed towards the black hole), but it will\nbe red-shifted strongly to the extent that it started near the\nhorizon. An outgoing beam of light that originates at an event on the\nevent horizon itself, by definition, remains on the event horizon\nuntil the temporal end of the universe. \n\nGeneral relativity tells us that clocks running at different locations\nin a gravitational field will, in a sense that can be made precise,\ngenerally not agree with one another. In the case of a black hole,\nthis manifests itself in the following way. Imagine someone falls into\na black hole, and, while falling, she flashes a light signal to us\nevery time her watch hand ticks. Observing from a safe distance\noutside the black hole, we would find the times between the arrival of\nsuccessive light signals to grow larger without limit, because it\ntakes longer for the light to escape the black hole's gravitational\npotential well the closer to the event horizon the light is emitted.\n(This is the red-shifting of light close to the event horizon.) That\nis, it would appear to us that time were slowing down for the falling\nperson as she approached the event horizon. The ticking of her watch\n(and every other process as well) would seem to go ever more slowly as\nshe approached ever more closely to the event horizon. We would never\nactually see the light signals she emits when she crosses the event\nhorizon; instead, she would seem to be eternally \u201cfrozen\u201d\njust above the horizon. (This talk of seeing the person is somewhat\nmisleading, because the light coming from the person would rapidly\nbecome severely red-shifted, and soon would not be practically\ndetectable.) \n\nFrom the perspective of the infalling person, however, nothing unusual\nhappens at the event horizon. She would experience no slowing of\nclocks, nor see any evidence that she is passing through the event\nhorizon of a black hole. Her passing the event horizon is simply the\nlast moment in her history at which a light signal she emits would be\nable to escape from the black hole. The concept of an event horizon is\na global one that depends on the overall structure of the\nspacetime, and in particular on how processes physically evolve into\nthe indefinite future. Locally there is nothing noteworthy about the\npoints on the event horizon. In particular, locating the event horizon\nby any combination of strictly local measurements is impossible in\nprinciple, no matter how ingeniously the instruments are arranged\nand precisely the measurements made. The presence of an event horizon\nin this global sense is a strictly unverifiable hypothesis. One need\nnot be a verificationist about scientific knowledge to be troubled by\nthis state of affairs (Curiel 2019). Indeed, the global nature of the\nevent horizon manifests in an even more striking way: they are\n\u201cprescient\u201d, in the sense that where the event horizon\nhorizon is located today depends on what I will throw in the black\nhole tomorrow. How should a good empiricist feel about all of this?\n\n\nThe global and geometrical nature of black holes also raises\ninteresting questions about the sense in which one may or should think\nof them as physical objects or systems (Curiel 2019). A black hole is\nsimply a geometrically characterized surface in spacetime, with no\nordinary matter at the event horizon, and no other local feature that\nwould allow one to detect it. The same questions as with singularities\n (section 2.1),\n therefore, force themselves on us here: in what sense, if any, should\nwe attribute existence to black holes, in so far as, considered\nlocally, they are an undistinguished region of spacetime whose\nphysically important properties manifest only as global structure?\n\n\nBecause of the peculiar nature of black holes as physical systems, the\nattempt to observe them also raises interesting epistemic problems\nabout, inter alia, under-determination of theoretical models\nby data, the way that theoretical assumptions play ineliminable roles\nin the interpretation of data, and what it means at all to\n\u201cobserve\u201d a physical system that is, in principle, able to\nemit no signal directly. Eckart et al. (2017) provides a\ncomprehensive survey of the issues; see also Collmar et al.\n(1998) for the record of a round-table discussion on these questions\nby a group of eminent theoreticians and observational astronomers. In\nlight of the recent epoch-making detection by LIGO of gravitational\nwaves with a signature indicating they were generated by a binary\nblack-hole system coalescing (Abbott et al. 2016), these\nissues become even more urgent for philosophers to explore. \n3.2. The Most Perfect Objects in the Cosmos\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of relativistic black holes is\nthat they are purely gravitational entities: all the standard\nblack-hole spacetime models (Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m,\nKerr, Kerr-Newman) contain no matter whatsoever. They are vacuum\nsolutions to the Einstein field equations, which just means a solution\nin which the matter density is everywhere zero. (Of course, one can\nalso consider a black hole with matter present, as standard\nastrophysical models do for the supermassive black holes that are\nbelieved to live at the center of most galaxies, which are thought to\nbe surrounded by strong magnetic fields and accretion disks of\nsuper-heated matter.) In pre-relativistic physics we think of gravity\nas a force produced by the mass associated with some matter. In the\ncontext of general relativity, however, we do away with gravitational\nforce, and instead postulate a curved spacetime geometry that produces\nall the effects we standardly attribute to gravity. One of the most\ncharacteristic features of general relativity that sets it apart from\nNewtonian gravitational theory is that it admits the possibility of\nsuch curvature (\u201cgravitational effects\u201d) in the absence of\nmatter, such as at the boundary of a black hole. Thus a black hole is\nnot a thing in spacetime; it is instead a feature of\nspacetime itself. \n\nA careful definition of a relativistic black hole will therefore rely\nonly on the geometrical features of spacetime. We will need to be a\nlittle more precise about what it means to be \u201ca region from\nwhich nothing, not even light, can escape\u201d. First, there will\nhave to be someplace to escape to if our definition is to\nmake sense. The most common method of making this idea precise and\nrigorous employs the notion of escaping to infinity. The idea is that\nif a particle or light ray cannot travel arbitrarily far from a\ndefinite, bounded region in the interior of spacetime but must remain\nalways in the region, then that region is one of no escape, and is\nthus a black hole. The boundary of the region is the event horizon.\nOnce a physical entity crosses the event horizon into the black hole,\nit never crosses it again. \n\nSecond, we will need a clear notion of the kind of geometry that\nallows for escape, or makes such escape impossible. For this, we need\nthe notion of the causal structure of spacetime. At any event in the\nspacetime, the possible trajectories of all light signals form a cone\n(or, more precisely, the four-dimensional analogue of the boundary of\na cone). Since light travels at the fastest speed allowed in the\nspacetime, these cones map out the boundaries of the propagation of\npossible causal processes in the spacetime. If an occurrence at an\nevent A is able to causally affect another occurrence at event\nB, there must be a continuous trajectory in spacetime from\nevent A to event B such that the trajectory lies in or\non the light cones of every event along it. (For more discussion, see\nthe Supplementary Document:\n Light Cones and Causal Structure.)\n \n\nFigure 4\n is a spacetime diagram of a sphere of matter collapsing to form a\nblack hole. The curvature of the spacetime is represented by the\ntilting of the light cones away from 45 degrees. Notice that the light\ncones tilt inwards more and more as one approaches the center of the\nblack hole. The jagged line running vertically up the center of the\ndiagram depicts the central singularity inside the black hole. As we\nemphasized in Section 1, this is not actually part of the spacetime,\nbut might be thought of as the \u201cplace\u201d where the structure\nof spacetime breaks down. Thus, one should not imagine the possibility\nof traveling through the singularity; this would be as nonsensical as\nsomething's leaving the diagram (i.e., the spacetime)\naltogether. \n\n\n\nFigure 4: a spacetime diagram of black\nhole formation \n\n\nWhat makes this a black hole spacetime is the fact that it contains a\nregion from which it is impossible to exit while traveling at or below\nthe speed of light. This region is marked off by the events at which\nthe outside edge of the forward light cone points straight upward. As\none moves inward from these events, the light cone tilts so much that\none is always forced to move inward toward the central singularity.\nThis set of points of no return is, of course, the event horizon; and\nthe spacetime region inside it is the black hole. In this region, one\ninevitably moves towards the singularity; the impossibility of\navoiding the singularity is just the impossibility of preventing\nourselves from moving forward in time. (Again, see\n section 3.4\n for a discussion of other ways to define a black hole.) \n\nNotice that, as represented in\n Figure 4, the matter of the collapsing\n star eventually disappears into the black hole singularity. All the\n details of the matter are then completely lost; all that is left is\n the geometrical properties of the black hole. Astonishingly, those\n properties can be identified with a small, fixed set of physical\n quantities. Indeed, the remarkable No-Hair Theorems (Israel 1967,\n 1968; Carter 1971, 1973, 1997 [Other Internet Resources]; Robinson\n 1975; Mazur 1982; Heusler 1996; Chru\u015bciel et al. 2012)\n make rigorous the idea that a black hole in equilibrium is entirely\n characterized by just three numbers, viz., its mass, its\n angular momentum, and its electric\n charge.[9] This\n has the remarkable consequence that no matter what the particulars\n may be of any body that collapses to form a black hole\u2014it may\n be as intricate, complicated and Rococo as one likes, composed of the\n most exotic materials\u2014the final result after the system has\n settled down to equilibrium will be identical in every respect to a\n black hole that formed from the collapse of any other body\n having the same total mass, angular momentum and electric charge\n (Carter 1997 [Other Internet Resources]). Because of this extremity\n of simplicity, Chandrasekhar (1983, Prologue,\n p. xxiii) called black\n holes \u201cthe most perfect macroscopic objects \u2026 in the\n universe.\u201d (The fact that their physical state is entirely\n characterized by only three numbers plays an important role in the\n ascription of thermodynamical properties to black holes, discussed in\n 5.2\n below.) \n\nRemarkably, not only are black holes in and of themselves objects of\nthe utmost simplicity. They enforce simplicity on all else in the\nuniverse as well, no matter how far away from themselves. In a sense\nthat can be made precise, one of the most basic structures of the\nspacetime manifold itself, its topology, is as simple as possible\neverywhere outside a well behaved black\n hole.[10]\n This is known as the Topological Censorship Theorem (Friedman et\nal. 1983; Chru\u015bciel and Wald 1994; Galloway 1995). As its\nname suggests, it bears on the larger question of the Cosmic\nCensorship Hypothesis (Galloway and Woolgar 1997), discussed in\n section 4\n below. In itself, though, it raises fascinating questions about the\nrelation of topological to metrical structure in a spacetime,\nquestions almost completely unexplored by philosophers. (See Geroch\nand Horowitz 1979 for a long list of conceptual and technical problems\nand questions about this relation.) For a philosopher interested in\nthe nature of spacetime, however, the way that its different\nstructures relate to and constrain each other must be of fundamental\nimportance. \n3.3. Quasi-Local Black Holes\n\nFor the reasons discussed in\n section 3.1,\n the standard definition of a black hole, based on the idea of a\nglobal event horizon, has limited application to the modeling of real\nastrophysical systems (except in so far as one can idealize them as\nessentially isolated). In an attempt to rectify this situation,\nHayward (1994b) offered a generalized definition of a black hole, not\nrequiring any of the special global structures that the traditional\ndefinition relies on. Hayward defines a black hole based on what he\ncalls a trapping horizon. This is, roughly speaking, a surface on\nwhich all inward-directed light rays are converging, and to which all\noutward-directed light rays are tangent. This definition tries to\ncapture the idea that a black hole is a surface at which the\ngravitational intensity is such that not even light can escape: any\nlight ray incident on the surface the smallest bit inward will get\nsucked in; otherwise, light rays can be only tangent to the surface.\nThe surface does not admit incident light rays traveling away from its\ninterior. This definition has the virtue that the boundary of the\nblack hole now has clear, local physical significance in principle: an\nobserver could determine when she crossed it by making only local\nmeasurements. (More precisely, a team of synchronized observers, whose\ncombined instrumental reach encompasses the entire surface at a given\nmoment of time, could jointly make this determination, with enough\nbackground knowledge of the spacetime geometry outside the boundary.)\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of Hayward's definition is\nthat a black hole would not necessarily be a region of no escape: in\nsome black holes so defined, an observer entering the trapped region\ncould later escape it (Hayward 1994a, in OIR).\n \n\nAshtekar et al. (1999, 2000) offer a different, related\ngeneralization of the idea of a black hole, based on what they call\nisolated horizons. This definition is somewhat more restrictive than\nHayward's in so far as, as the name suggests, it requires that no\nstress-energy cross such a horizon. Subsequent work by Ashtekar and\nKrishnan (2003), Ashtekar (2007) and Hayward (2006, in OIR,\n 2009) clarified the relationship between the two, showing that the\nisolated horizon can be considered, in a sense, a special case of the\ntrapping horizon. (See Hayward 2013 for a recent comprehensive review,\nand Faraoni 2013 for one with special attention to its relevance to\ncosmology.) For lack of a better term, we shall call black holes\ndefined by trapping or isolated horizons \u201cquasi-local black\nholes\u201d. (\u2018Local\u2019 because they are not global objects\nin the sense that black holes as tradionally defined are, and\n\u2018quasi\u2019 because they still can extend arbitrarily far\nthroughout spacetime.) \n\nThe status of these competing definitions of a quasi-local black hole\nand of the differences among them, and what their respective virtues\nand demerits may be, appear to be open questions, though both Hayward\nand Ashtekar et al., in the works just cited, go some way\ntowards answering some of them by using their respective definitions\nto prove generalizations of the so-called laws of black hole mechanics\n (section 5.1\n below). Hayward also demonstrates that analogues to some of the\nclassical singularity theorems hold for his definition as well. Still,\nmany questions remain open. To take one example, it is not clear\nwhether or not the new definitions coincide with the traditional\ndefinition in those spacetimes in which the traditional definition can\nbe formulated, or whether collateral conditions must be met for the\ntwo to coincide. It is also not clear whether the analogues to the\nclassical No Hair Theorems hold using the new definitions or even what\nthose analogues may be. \n\nPerhaps the most fascinating feature of quasi-local black holes is the\nfact that, in a sense that can be made precise, they are\n\u201cclairvoyant\u201d: they are aware of and respond to changes in\nthe geometry in spacetime regions that they cannot be in causal\ncontact with (Bengtsson and Senovilla 2011). Indeed, they can\nencompass regions whose entire causal past is flat! This subject\nexemplifies the exuberant weirdness that causal structure in general\nrelativity can manifest. \n3.4. Different Definitions of Black Holes\n\nBesides the standard definition of a black hole based on the presence\nof a global event horizon, and the quasi-local definitions just\ndiscussed, there is an enormous and greatly variegated menagerie of\ndifferent definitions and conceptions of a black hole that physicists\nin different fields (and sometimes those in the same field) use in\ntheir day to day work, none agreeing with the standard or quasi-local\ndefinitions, many of them manifestly inconsistent with each other\n(Curiel 2019). However one views this situation, it is clear, as a\nbrute fact about the practice of physics today, that there is no\nsingle definition of \u201cblack hole\u201d that will serve all\ninvestigative purposes in all fields in which black holes are objects\nof study.\n Table 1\n lists the core concepts most commonly used in definitions and\ncharacterizations of black holes across several different fields of\nphysics, sketched with only the broadest and crudest of brushes. It\nshould be kept in mind that many investigators in each of these fields\ndo not use, or even accept as reasonable, what is given in the table.\n\n\n\n\nField\nCore Concepts \n\nastrophysics\n\n\ncompact object\nregion of no escape\nengine for enormous power output\n \n\nclassical relativity\n\n\ncausal boundary of the past of future null infinity (event\nhorizon)\napparent horizon\nquasi-local horizon\n \n\nmathematical relativity\n\n\napparent horizon\nsingularity\n \n\nsemi-classical relativity \n\n\nsame as classical relativity\nthermodynamical system of maximal entropy\n \n\nquantum gravity\n\n\nparticular excitation of quantum field\nensemble or mixed state of maximal entropy\nno good definition to be had\n \n\nanalogue gravity\n\n\nregion of no escape for finite time, or for low energy modes\n \n\n\nTable 1: core concepts in different\ndefinitions of black holes common to different fields \n\n\nWhat seems to be the most common practice today is, during the course\nof an investigation, to fix a list of important, characteristic\nproperties of and phenomena associated with black holes required for\none's purposes in the context of interest, and then to determine which\nof the known definitions imply the members of that list. If no known\ndefinition implies the list, one either attempts to construct a new\ndefinition that does (and is satisfactory in other ways), or else one\nconcludes that there is an internal inconsistency in one's list, which\nmay already be of great interest to learn. Examining the way the idea\nof black holes are used across physics\u2014in astrophysics,\ncosmology, classical general relativity, semi-classical gravity,\nparticle physics, various programs in quantum gravity, fluid\nmechanics, condensed matter, and analogue gravity\u2014yields a list\nof potentially characteristic properties and phenomena some subset of\nwhich may plausibly be required or wanted in a characterization of a\nblack hole in a given investigative context (Curiel 2019): \n\n possesses a horizon that satisfies the four laws of black hole\nmechanics; \n possesses a locally determinable horizon; \n possesses a horizon that is, in a suitable sense, vacuum; \n is vacuum with a suitable set of symmetries; \n defines a region of no escape, in some suitable sense, for some\nminimum period of time; \n defines a region of no escape for all time; \n is embedded in an asymptotically flat spacetime; \n is embedded in a topologically simple spacetime; \n encompasses a singularity; \n satisfies the No-Hair Theorem; \n is the result of evolution from initial data satisfying an\nappropriate Hadamard condition (stability of evolution); \n allows one to predict that final, stable states upon settling\ndown to equilibrium after a perturbation correspond, in some relevant\nsense, to the classical stationary black hole solutions\n(Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, Kerr, Kerr-Newman); \n agrees with the classical stationary black hole solutions when\nevaluated in those spacetimes; \n allows one to derive the existence of Hawking radiation from some\nset of independent principles of interest (see\n section 6.1);\n \n allows one to calculate in an appropriate limit, from some set of\nindependent principles of interest, an entropy that accords with the\nBekenstein entropy (i.e., is proportional to the area of a\nrelevant horizon, with corrections of the order of\n&hbar;\u2014see\n section 5.2\n and\n section 5.3);\n \n possesses an entropy that is, in some relevant sense, maximal;\n\n has a lower-bound on possible mass; \n is relativistically compact. \n\n\nThis list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are many other such\nproperties and phenomena that might be needed for a given purpose. It\nis already clear from this partial list, however, that no single\ndefinition can accommodate all of them. It is also clear from\nexamining the literature, moreover, that, even within the same\ncommunities, different workers will choose different subsets of these\nproperties for different purposes in their thinking about black holes.\n\n\nAs in the case of singularities, these alternative definitions of\nblack holes raise philosophical questions about the relations among\nthe different definitions that attempt to capture different aspects\nof, intuitively speaking, the \u201csame kind\u201d of physical\nobject. One can, for instance, view the standard definition of a black\nhole, with its global event horizon, as an extreme idealization of an\nisolated system (one with no neighboring systems at all), and the\ndefinitions based on isolated or trapping horizons as trying to\ncapture a more general, less idealized representation of an isolated\nsystem, one that has neighboring systems at a finite remove, or a\nrepresentation of a system that may be non-trivially interacting with\nother systems. For the looser, less precise definitions used by\nastrophysicists, for example, and some of the gestures at definitions\nproposed in some programs of quantum gravity, however, it is difficult\nto know how even to begin to compare them to the precise global and\nquasi-local ones. It is simply not clear that the same type of\nphysical system is being characterized. \n\nThis situation provides a fascinating case study, from both a physical\nand a philosophical point of view, for questions about the nature of\nidealization and de-idealization, and the definition of theoretical\nentities more generally. On what grounds, e.g., could one\nascertain the relative merits of each type of definition on its own,\nand each as proposed for a particular sort of investigation, in the\nabsence of empirical data? In what sense do the different definitions\ncharacterize the \u201csame\u201d type of physical system, if they\ndo so at all? Is there a need to settle on a single canonical\ndefinition of a black hole? What would be gained or lost with or\nwithout one? The situation is closely analogous to that of the lack of\na canonical definition of a singularity, except it is even more\nextreme here: the different definitions of singularities used by\ndifferent physicists are (almost always) not actually\ninconsistent with each other. \n\nFor the remainder of this encyclopedia entry, unless explicitly stated\notherwise, when we speak of a black hole it should be understood that\nwe mean one as determined by the standard definition of a global event\nhorizon, because this is the one most often used in current\nfoundational work. \n4. Naked Singularities, the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis, and Indeterminism\n\nWhile spacetime singularities in general are frequently viewed with\nsuspicion, physicists often offer the reassurance that, even if they\nare real, we expect most of them to be hidden away behind the event\nhorizons of black holes. Such singularities therefore could not affect\nus unless we were actually to jump into the black hole. A naked\nsingularity, on the other hand, is one that is not hidden behind an\nevent horizon. Such singularities appear much more threatening because\nthey are uncontained, freely accessible to the rest of spacetime. \n\nThe heart of the worry is that singular structure seems to signify so\nprofound a breakdown in the fundamental structure of spacetime that it\ncould wreak havoc on any region of the universe that it were visible\nto. Because the structures that break down in singular spacetimes are\nin general required for the formulation of our known physical laws,\nand of initial-value problems for individual physical systems in\nparticular, one such fear is that determinism would collapse entirely\nwherever the singular breakdown were causally visible. In Earman's\n(1995, pp. 65\u20136) evocative conceit, nothing would seem to stop\nthe singularity from disgorging any manner of unpleasant jetsam, from\nTVs showing Nixon's Checkers Speech to old lost socks, in a way\ncompletely undetermined by the state of spacetime in any region\nwhatsoever. As a result, there could be no reasonable expectation of\ndeterminism, nor even just predictability, for any region in causal\ncontact with what it spews out. \n\nOne form that such a naked singularity could take is that of a\nwhite hole, which is a time-reversed black hole. Imagine\ntaking a film of a black hole forming from the collapse of a massive\nobject, say, a star, with light, dust, rockets, astronauts and old\nsocks falling into it during its subsequent evolution. Now imagine\nthat film being run backwards. This is the picture of a white hole:\none starts with a naked singularity, out of which might appear people,\nrockets, socks\u2014anything at all\u2014with eventually a star\nbursting forth. Absolutely nothing in the causal past of such a white\nhole would determine what would pop out of it, since, as follows from\nthe No Hair Theorems\n (section 3.2),\n items that fall into a black hole leave no trace on the future\noutside of it. (This description should feel familiar to the canny\nreader: it is the same as the way that increase of entropy in ordinary\nthermodynamics as embodied in the Second Law makes retrodiction\nimpossible; the relationship of black holes to thermodynamics is\ndiscussed in\n section 5.)\n Because the field equations of general relativity do not pick out a\npreferred direction of time, if the formation of a black hole is\nallowed by the laws of spacetime and gravity, then those laws also\npermit white holes. \n\nRoger Penrose (1969, 1973) famously suggested that although naked\nsingularities are compatible with general relativity, in physically\nrealistic situations they will never form; that is, any process that\nresults in a singularity will safely ensconce that singularity behind\nan event horizon. This conjecture, known as the Cosmic Censorship\nHypothesis, has met with some success and popularity; however, it also\nfaces several difficulties. As in our previous discussions of\nsingularities and black holes, there are questions about how exactly\nto formulate the hypothesis, and, once formulated, about whether or\nnot it holds in general relativity as a whole, or at least in some\nphysically reasonable subset of spacetimes\u2014where, again,\n\u201cphysically reasonable\u201d will likely be a vague and\ncontroversial notion. \n\nPenrose's original formulation relied on black holes: a suitably\ngeneric singularity will always be contained in a black hole (and so\ncausally invisible outside the black hole). As the counter-examples to\nvarious ways of articulating the hypothesis based on this idea have\naccumulated over the years, however, it has gradually been abandoned\n(Geroch and Horowitz 1979; Krolak 1986; Penrose 1998; Joshi et\nal. 2002; Joshi 2003, 2007a; Joshi and Malafarina 2011a, 2011b).\nMore recent approaches either begin with an attempt to provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for cosmic censorship itself,\nyielding an indirect characterization of a naked singularity as any\nphenomenon violating those conditions, or else they begin with an\nattempt to provide a characterization of a naked singularity without\nreference to black holes and so conclude with a definite statement of\ncosmic censorship as the absence of such phenomena (Geroch and\nHorowitz 1979). The variety of proposals made using both approaches is\ntoo great to canvass here; the interested reader is referred to\nRingstr\u00f6m (2010) for a review of the current state of the art for\nstandard black holes, Nielsen (2012) for cosmic censorship regarding\nHayward's quasi-local black holes\n (section 3.3),\n Ringstr\u00f6m (2010) for a review of the bearing of the\ninitial-value problem in general relativity on cosmic censorship, and\nto Earman (1995, ch. 3) and Curiel (1999) for philosophical discussion\nof many of the earlier proposals. Manchak (2011) gives reasons for\nthinking that the question of providing a completely satisfactory\nformulation of the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis may never be settled,\non the grounds that the idea of what counts as \u201cphysically\nreasonable\u201d is not an empirically determinable question. Still,\nthe possibility may remain open that there be several different,\ninequivalent formulations of the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis, each\nhaving its own advantages and problems, none \u201ccanonical\u201d\nin a definitive sense, as may be the case for definitions of\nsingularities and black holes themselves. \n\nThere is another area of investigation intimately related to issues of\nCosmic Censorship in general, and issues of determinism in general\nrelativity in particular: whether or not spacetime is\n\u201chole-free\u201d. This has been the subject of recent\nphilosophical work, primarily by Manchak (2009b, 2014a, 2016a). Geroch\n(1977) originally proposed the idea of a generic \u201chole\u201d in\nspacetime in trying to capture in as general terms as possible the\nidea that spacetime has no obstruction of any kind that would prevent\nit from \u201cevolving as far into the future as it reasonably\ncould\u201d. (Recall the discussion of maximality and extendibility\nin\n section 1.1.)\n Although Geroch's definition had powerful conceptual appeal, in the\nevent it has proven untenable: Krasnikov (2009) showed that, according\nto it, even Minkowski spacetime fails to be hole-free. Manchak (2009b)\nshowed how an emendation of Geroch's definition could fix the problem.\nHe then showed that, under the assumption of global hyperbolicity (a\nstrong condition of causal well-behavedness for a spacetime), one gets\na nice hierarchy of conditions relating to determinism: geodesic\ncompleteness implies effective completeness (Manchak's own condition),\nwhich implies inextendibility, which implies hole-freeness (Manchak\n2014a; see\n section 1.1\n for the definitions of these conditions). In related work, Manchak\n(2014b) showed that, in a sense one can make precise, it should be\neasier to construct a machine that would result in spacetime's having\nsuch a hole than one that would result in time-travel. In short,\ncreating the possibility for indeterminism seems easier in the theory\nthan the possibility for causal paradox! \n\nManchak (2016a) also recently introduced a new kind of pathology a\nspacetime can have, an \u201cepistemic hole\u201d: roughly speaking,\na spacetime has an epistemic hole if two observers in initially\nidentical epistemic states can evolve in such a way that what one can\nlearn can only ever be, in principle, a proper subset of what the\nother can learn. Manchak shows that, if a spacetime has no epistemic\nholes then (under mild conditions on the niceness of the causal\nstructure) the spacetime has no naked singularities as standardly\nconstrued. The condition differs also in its modal character from\nother such hole-freeness conditions, for it makes significantly weaker\nand more conceptually and technically tractable modal claims. \n\nIssues of determinism, from an epistemic perspective, are intimately\nbound up with the possibility of reliable prediction. (See the entry\n Causal Determinism.)\n The general issue of predictability itself in general relativity,\neven apart from the specific problems that singular structure may\nraise, is fascinating, philosophically rich, and very much unsettled.\nOne can make a prima facie strong argument, for example, that\nprediction is possible in general relativity only in spacetimes that\npossess singularities (Hogarth 1997; Manchak 2013)! See\nGeroch (1977), Glymour (1977), Malament (1977), and Manchak (2008,\n2013) for discussion of these and many other related issues. \n\nHere again, as with almost all the issues discussed up to this point\nin this entry regarding singularities and black holes, is an example\nof a sizable subculture in physics working on matters that have no\nclearly or even unambiguously defined physical parameters to inform\nthe investigations and no empirical evidence to guide or even just\nconstrain them, the parameters of the debate imposed by and large by\nthe intuitions of a handful of leading researchers. From sociological,\nphysical, and philosophical vantage points, one may well wonder, then,\nwhy so many physicists continue to work on it, and what sort of\ninvestigation they are engaged in. Perhaps nowhere else in general\nrelativity, or even in physics, can one observe such a delicate\ninterplay of, on the one hand, technical results, definitions and\ncriteria, and, on the other hand, conceptual puzzles and even\nincoherence, largely driven by the inchoate intuitions of physicists.\nNot everyone views the situation with excitement or even equanimity,\nhowever: see Curiel (1999) for a somewhat skeptical discussion of the\nwhole endeavor. \n5. Black Holes and Thermodynamics\n\nThe challenge of uniting quantum theory and general relativity in a\nsuccessful theory of quantum gravity has arguably been the greatest\nchallenge facing theoretical physics for the past eighty years. One\navenue that has seemed particularly promising is the attempt to apply\nquantum theory to black holes. This is in part because, as purely\ngravitational entities, black holes present an apparently simple but\nphysically important case for the study of the quantization of\ngravity. Further, because the gravitational force grows without bound\nas one nears a standard black-hole singularity, one would expect\nquantum gravitational effects (which should come into play at\nextremely high energies) to manifest themselves in the interior of\nblack holes. \n\nIn the event, studies of quantum mechanical systems in black hole\nspacetimes have revealed several surprises that threaten to overturn\nthe views of space, time, and matter that general relativity and\nquantum field theory each on their own suggests or relies on. Since\nthe ground-breaking work of Wheeler, Penrose, Bekenstein, Hawking and\nothers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it has become increasingly\nclear that there are profound connections among general relativity,\nquantum field theory, and thermodynamics. This area of intersection\nhas become one of the most active and fruitful in all of theoretical\nphysics, bringing together workers from a variety of fields such as\ncosmology, general relativity, quantum field theory, particle physics,\nfluid dynamics, condensed matter, and quantum gravity, providing\nbridges that now closely connect disciplines once seen as largely\nindependent. \n\nIn particular, a remarkable parallel between the laws of black holes\nand the laws of thermodynamics indicates that gravity and\nthermodynamics may be linked in a fundamental (and previously\nunimagined) way. This linkage strongly suggests, among many things,\nthat our fundamental ideas of entropy and the nature of the Second Law\nof thermodynamics must be reconsidered, and that the standard form of\nquantum evolution itself may need to be modified. While these\nsuggestions are speculative, they nevertheless touch on deep issues in\nthe foundations of physics. Indeed, because the central subject matter\nof all these diverse areas of research lies beyond the reach of\ncurrent experimentation and observation, they are all speculative in a\nway unusual even in theoretical physics. In their investigation,\ntherefore, physical questions of a technically sophisticated nature\nare inextricable from subtle philosophical considerations spanning\nontology, epistemology, and methodology, again in a way unusual even\nin theoretical physics. \n\nBecause this is a particularly long and dense section of the article,\nwe begin with an outline of it.\n Section 5.1\n states the laws of black holes in classical general relativity, and\nexpounds the formal analogy they stand in with the laws of ordinary\nthermodynamics.\n Section 5.2\n briefly describes how taking account of quantum effects in the\nneighborhood of a black hole leads to the prediction of Hawking\nradiation and the subsequent conclusion that the analogy with the laws\nof ordinary thermodynamics is more than just formal, but represents a\ntrue and intimate physical connection.\n Section 5.3\n discusses the puzzles that arise when trying to understand the\nattribution of a physical entropy to a black hole.\n Section 5.4\n consists of several subsections, each examining a different puzzling\naspect of the so-called Generalized Second Law: the hypothesis that\nthe total entropy of the universe, that of ordinary matter plus that\nof black holes, never decreases. We conclude in\n Section 5.5\n with a brief account of attempts to extend the attribution of a\nphysical entropy to gravitational systems more general than just black\nholes. \n5.1. The Classical Laws of Black Holes\n\nSuppose one observes a quiescent black hole at a given moment,\nignoring any possible quantum effects. As discussed above in\n section 3.2,\n there are three physical quantities of dynamical interest the black\nhole possesses that are, more or less, amenable to measurement, and\nthat completely characterize the physical state of the black hole: its\nmass, its angular momentum, and its electric charge. These quantities,\nlike those of systems in classical mechanics, stand in definite\nrelation to each other as the black hole dynamically evolves, which is\nto say, they satisfy a set of equations characterizing their\n behavior.[11]\n\n\nZeroth Law\nThe surface gravity of a stationary black hole is constant over\nits entire surface.\nFirst Law\nA change in the total mass of the black hole is determined in a\nfixed way by changes in its area, angular momentum, and electric\ncharge, so that the total quantity is conserved.\nSecond Law (The Area Theorem)\nThe total surface area of a black hole never decreases.\nThird Law\nNo physical process can reduce the surface gravity of a black hole\nto zero.\n\n\n(A black hole is stationary if, roughly speaking, it does not\nchange over time; more precisely, it is stationary if its event\nhorizon is generated by an asymptotically timelike Killing field.)\n\n\nOn the face of it, the Zeroth, First and Third Laws are\nstraightforward to understand. The Second Law, however, is not so\n\u201cobvious\u201d as it may at first glance appear. It may seem\nthat, because nothing can escape from a black hole once it has\nentered, black holes can only grow larger or, at least, stay the same\nsize if nothing further falls in. This assumes, however, that\nincreased mass always yields increased surface area as opposed to some\nother measure of spatial extent. Surprising as it may sound, it is\nindeed the case that, although nothing that enters a black hole can\nescape, it is still possible to extract energy (i.e., mass)\nfrom a spinning black hole, by means of what is known as the Penrose\nprocess (Penrose and Floyd 1971). It is therefore not obvious that one\ncould not shrink a black hole by extracting enough mass-energy or\nangular momentum from it. It also seems to be at least possible that a\nblack hole could shrink by radiating mass-energy away as gravitational\nradiation, or that the remnant of two colliding black holes could have\na smaller surface area than the sum of the original two. \n\nIt is most surprising, therefore, to learn that the Second Law is a\ndeep, rigorous theorem that follows only from the fundamental\nmathematics of relativistic spacetimes (Hawking 1971), and does not\ndepend in any essential way on the particulars of relativistic\ndynamics as encapsulated in the Einstein field equation (Curiel\n2017). This is in strict opposition to the Second Law in classical\nthermodynamics, which stands as a more or less phenomenological\nprinciple derived by empirical generalization, perhaps justified in\nsome sense by a \u201creduction\u201d to statistical mechanics, with\nthe temporal asymmetry of entropy non-decrease argued to hold based on\nthe likelihood of initial states in conjunction with the forms of\ndynamical evolution \u201cphysically permissible\u201d for matter\nfields. (See the entry\n Philosophy of Statistical Mechanics.)\n \n\nFor those who know classical thermodynamics, the formal analogy\nbetween its laws and the laws of black hole as stated should be\nobvious. (For exposition and discussion of the laws of classical\nthermodynamics, see, e.g.: Fermi 1937 for a less technical,\nmore physically intuitive approach; Fowler and Guggenheim 1939 for a\nmore technical and rigorous one; and Uffink 2007 for a more\nhistorically and philosophically oriented one.) One formulation of the\nZeroth Law of thermodynamics states that a body in thermal equilibrium\nhas constant temperature throughout. The First Law is a statement of\nthe conservation of energy. It has as a consequence that any change in\nthe total energy of a body is compensated for and measured by changes\nin its associated physical quantities, such as entropy, temperature,\nangular momentum and electric charge. The Second Law states that\nentropy never decreases. The Third Law, on one formulation, states\nthat it is impossible to reduce the temperature of a system to zero by\nany physical process. Accordingly, if in the laws for black holes one\ntakes \u2018stationary\u2019 to stand for \u2018thermal\nequilibrium\u2019, \u2018surface gravity\u2019 to stand for\n\u2018temperature\u2019, \u2018mass\u2019 to stand for\n\u2018energy\u2019, and \u2018area\u2019 to stand for\n\u2018entropy\u2019, then the formal analogy is perfect. \n\nIndeed, relativistically mass just is energy, so at least the\nFirst Law seems already to be more than just formal analogy. Also, the\nfact that the state of a stationary black hole is entirely\ncharacterized by only a few parameters, completely independent of the\nnature and configuration of any micro-structures that may underlie it\n(e.g., those of whatever collapsed to form the thing),\nalready makes it sound more than just a little thermodynamical in\ncharacter. (Recall the discussion of the No Hair Theorems in\n section 3.2\n above.) Still, although the analogy is extremely suggestive in\ntoto, to take it seriously would require one to assign a non-zero\ntemperature to a black hole, which, at the time Bardeen, Carter and\nHawking first formulated and proved the laws in 1973, almost everyone\nagreed was absurd. All hot bodies emit thermal radiation (like the\nheat given off from a stove, or the visible light emitted by a burning\npiece of charcoal); according to general relativity, however, a black\nhole ought to be a perfect sink for energy, mass, and radiation,\ninsofar as it absorbs everything (including light), and emits nothing\n(including light). So it seems the only temperature one might be able\nto assign it would be absolute zero. (See\n section 5.4.2\n below for more detailed arguments to this effect.) \n\nIn the early 1970s, nonetheless, Bekenstein (1972, 1973, 1974) argued\nthat the Second Law of thermodynamics requires one to assign a finite\nentropy to a black hole. His worry was that one could collapse any\namount of highly entropic matter into a black hole\u2014which, as we\nhave emphasized, is an extremely simple object\u2014leaving no trace\nof the original disorder associated with the high entropy of the\noriginal matter. This seems to violate the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, which asserts that the entropy (disorder) of a closed\nsystem\u2014such as the exterior of an event horizon\u2014can never\ndecrease. Adding mass to a black hole, however, will increase its\nsize, which led Bekenstein to suggest that the area of a black hole is\na measure of its entropy. This conjecture received support in 1971\nwhen Hawking proved that the surface area of a black hole, like the\nentropy of a closed system, can never decrease (Hawking 1971). Still,\nessentially no one took Bekenstein's proposals seriously at first,\nbecause all black holes manifestly have temperature absolute zero, as\nmentioned above, if it is even meaningful to ascribe temperatures to\nthem in the first\n place.[12]\n\n\nThus it seems that the analogy between black holes and thermodynamical\nobjects, when treated in the purely classical theory of general\nrelativity, is merely a formal one, without real physical\nsignificance. \n5.2. Black Hole Thermodynamics\n\nThe \u201cobvious fact\u201d that the temperature of a black hole\ncan be, at best, only absolute zero was shown to be illusory when\nHawking (1974, 1975) demonstrated that black holes are not completely\nblack after all. His analysis of the behavior of quantum fields in\nblack-hole spacetimes revealed that black holes will emit radiation\nwith a characteristically thermal spectrum: a black hole generates\nheat at a temperature that is inversely proportional to its mass and\ndirectly proportional to its surface gravity. It glows like a lump of\nsmoldering coal even though light should not be able to escape from\nit! The temperature of this Hawking radiation is extremely low for\nstellar- and galactic-scale black holes, but for very, very small\nblack holes the temperatures would be high. (The Hawking temperature\nof the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius\nA*, having a mass of approximately 4 million solar masses,\nis approximately 10-14 Kelvin; for a black hole to be room\ntemperature, it would have to have a mass of about 1018\nkg\u2014about 1000 times the mass of Mt. Everest\u2014and so be\nabout 10-7 m across, the size of a virus.) This means that\na very, very small black hole should rapidly evaporate away, as all of\nits mass-energy is emitted in high-temperature Hawking radiation.\nThus, when quantum effects are taken into account, black holes will\nnot satisfy the Area Theorem, the second of the classical laws of\nblack hole, as their areas shrink while they evaporate. (Hayward\net al. 2009 discuss the status of deriving a\n\u201clocal\u201d flux of Hawking radiation for quasi-local black\nholes; Nielsen 2009 discusses this along with the status of attempts\nto prove the laws of black holes for quasi-local black holes.) \n\nThese results\u2014now referred to collectively as the Hawking\neffect\u2014were taken to establish that the parallel between the\nlaws of black hole and the laws of thermodynamics was not a mere\nformal fluke: it seems they really are getting at the same deep\nphysics. The Hawking effect establishes that the surface gravity of a\nblack hole can, indeed must, be interpreted as a physical temperature.\n(The surface gravity, therefore, is often referred to as the\n\u2018Hawking temperature\u2019.) Connecting the two sets of laws\nalso requires linking the surface area of a black hole with entropy,\nas Bekenstein had earlier suggested: the entropy of a black hole is\nproportional to the area of its event horizon, which is itself\nproportional to the square of its mass. (The area, therefore, is often\nreferred to as the \u2018Bekenstein entropy\u2019.) Furthermore,\nmass in black hole mechanics is mirrored by energy in thermodynamics,\nand we know from relativity theory that mass and energy are identical,\nso the black hole's mass is its thermodynamical energy. The\noverwhelming consensus in the physics community today, therefore, is\nthat black holes truly are thermodynamical objects, and the laws of\nblack hole mechanics just are the laws of ordinary thermodynamics\nextended into a new regime, to cover a new type of physical system.\n\n\nWe will return to discuss Hawking radiation in more detail in\n section 6.1\n below, but for now we note that this all raises deep questions about\ninter-theoretic relations that philosophers have not yet come to grips\nwith: although it seems undeniable, what does it mean to say that a\npurely gravitational system is also \u201ca thermodynamical\n object\u201d?[13]\n How can the concepts and relations of one theory be translated so as\nto be applicable in the context of a radically different one? (See the\nentries\n Scientific Unity\n and\n Intertheory Relations in Physics.)\n \n\nAlthough it is still orthodoxy today in the physics community that\nthere is no consistent theory of thermodynamics for purely classical\nblack holes (Unruh and Wald 1982; Wald 1999, 2001), i.e.,\nwhen quantum effects are not taken into account, primarily because it\nseems that they must be assigned a temperature of absolute zero, if\nany at all. Curiel (2017a, Other Internet Resources)\n has recently argued that this is not so. He argues, to the contrary,\nthat there is a consistent way of treating purely classical black\nholes as real thermodynamical systems, that they should be assigned a\ntemperature proportional to their surface gravity, and, in fact, that\nnot to do so leads to the same kinds of inconsistencies as occur if\none does not do so for black holes emitting Hawking radiation. \n\nIn a recent article, Dougherty and Callender (2019) challenge the\northodoxy from the opposite direction. They argue that we should be\nfar more skeptical of the idea that the laws of black holes are more\nthan just formal analogy, and that, indeed, there are strong reasons\nto think that they are not physically the laws of thermodynamics\nextended into a new domain. Their main argument is that the Zeroth Law\nof black holes cannot do the work that the standard formulation of the\nZeroth Law does in classical thermodynamics. In classical\nthermodynamics, the standard formulation of the Zeroth Law is\ntransitivity of equilibrium: two bodies each in equilibrium with a\nthird will be in equilibrium with each other. They point out that this\ntransitivity of equilibrium underlies many of the most important\nconstructions and structures in classical thermodynamics, which mere\nconstancy of temperature (surface gravity) for a single system in\nequilibrium does not suffice for. Curiel (2018), however, recently\nproposed a strengthened version of the Zeroth Law for black holes,\nbased on a characterization of transitivity of equilibrium among them,\nin an attempt to address this challenge. It suffers from several\nproblems, however, most importantly the fact that it relies on a\nnotion of \u201capproximate symmetry\u201d in general relativity\nthat is not well defined. This is an area of active dispute. \n\nWallace (2018, 2019) provides a more comprehensive exposition and\ndefense of the claim that black holes truly are thermodynamical\nobjects, attacking the problem from several different directions, and\noffers specific rejoinders to several of the other arguments made by\nDougherty and Callender (2019). \n5.3. What Is Black Hole Entropy?\n\nThe most initially plausible and promising way to explain what the\nentropy of a black hole measures, and why a black hole has such a\nproperty in the first place, is to point to the Hawking radiation it\nemits, and in particular the well defined temperature the radiation\nhas. (For exposition and discussion of the standard relations between\ntemperature and entropy in classical thermodynamics, see,\ne.g.: Fermi 1936 for a less technical, more physically\nintuitive approach; Fowler and Guggenheim 1939 for a more technical\nand rigorous one; and Uffink 2007 for a more historically and\nphilosophically oriented one.) Indeed, it is not uncommon to see such\n\u201cexplanations\u201d, not only in popular accounts but even in\nserious research papers. There are, however, many technical and\nconceptual reasons why such an explanation is not viable (Visser\n1998b, 2003), summed up in the slogan that Hawking radiation is a\nstrictly kinematical effect, whereas black hole entropy is a dynamical\nphenomenon. (This fact is discussed in more detail in\n section 8\n below.) What, then, is the origin and nature of the entropy we\nattribute to a black hole? \n\nIn classical thermodynamics, that a system possesses entropy is often\nattributed to the fact that in practice we are never able to give it a\n\u201ccomplete\u201d description (Jaynes 1967). When describing a\ncloud of gas, we do not specify values for the position and velocity\nof every molecule in it; we rather describe it using quantities, such\nas pressure and temperature, constructed as statistical measures over\nunderlying, more finely grained quantities, such as the momentum and\nenergy of the individual molecules. On one common construal, then, the\nentropy of the gas measures the incompleteness, as it were, of the\ngross description. (See the entry\n Philosophy of Statistical Mechanics.)\n In the attempt to take seriously the idea that a black hole has a\ntrue physical entropy, it is therefore natural to attempt to construct\nsuch a statistical origin for it. The tools of classical general\nrelativity cannot provide such a construction, for it allows no way to\ndescribe a black hole as a system whose physical attributes arise as\ngross statistical measures over underlying, more finely grained\nquantities. Not even the tools of quantum field theory on curved\nspacetime can provide it, for they still treat the black hole as an\nentity defined entirely in terms of the classical geometry of the\nspacetime (Wald 1994). Any such statistical accounting, therefore,\nmust come from a theory that attributes to the classical geometry\nitself a description based on an underlying, perhaps discrete\ncollection of microstates, themselves describing the fine-grained\ndynamics of \u201centities\u201d, presumably quantum in nature,\nunderlying the classical spacetime description of the black hole. Note\nthat any program aimed at \u201ccounting black-hole\nmicrostates\u201d need not accept a subjectivist interpretation of\nentropy \u00e0 la Jaynes. In any event, on any view of the\nnature of entropy, there arises a closely related problem,\nviz., to locate \u201cwhere\u201d black-hole entropy\nresides: inside, on, or outside the event horizon? See Jacobson et\nal. (2005) for a thoughtful dialogue among three eminent\nphysicists with different point of views on the matter. \n\nExplaining what these microstates are that are counted by the\nBekenstein entropy has been a challenge that has been eagerly pursued\nby quantum gravity researchers. In 1996, superstring theorists were\nable to give an account of how M-theory (an extension of\nsuperstring theory) generates the number of string-states underlying a\ncertain class of classical black holes, and this number matched that\ngiven by the Bekenstein entropy (Strominger and Vafa 1996). At the\nsame time, a counting of black-hole states using loop quantum gravity\nalso recovered the Bekenstein entropy (Rovelli 1996). It is\nphilosophically noteworthy that this is treated as a significant\nsuccess for these programs (i.e., it is presented as a reason\nfor thinking that these programs are on the right track), even though\nno quantum effect in the vicinity of a black hole, much less Hawking\nradiation itself, has ever been experimentally observed. (Sadly, we\nhave no black holes in terrestrial laboratories, and those we do have\ngood reason to think we indirectly observe are too far away for\nanything like these effects to be remotely detectable, given their\nminuscule temperatures.) It is also the case that all known\nderivations held only for a very special class of black holes\n(\u201cextremal\u201d ones), which everyone agrees are unphysical.\nThere are no convincing derivations for more general, physically\nrelevant black holes. \n\nNonetheless, the derivation of the Bekenstein entropy by the counting\nof \u201cmicrostates\u201d has become something of a sine qua\nnon for programs of quantum gravity, even if only for the special\ncase of extremal black holes: if one cannot do it from something like\nthe first principles of one's program, no one will take you seriously.\nThis is noteworthy because it poses a prima facie problem for\ntraditional accounts of scientific method, and underscores the\ndifficulties faced by fundamental physics today, that in many\nimportant areas it cannot make contact with empirical data at all. How\ndid a theoretically predicted phenomenon, derived by combining\nseemingly incompatible theories in a novel way so as to extend their\nreach into regimes that we have no way of testing in the foreseeable\nfuture, become the most important touchstone for testing novel ideas\nin theoretical physics? Can it play that role? Philosophers have not\nyet started to grapple seriously with these issues. \n\nIn a thoughtful survey, Sorkin (2005) concisely and insightfully\ncharacterizes in ten theses what seems to be a popular view on the\nnature of black-hole entropy when studied as an essentially quantum\nphenomenon, which is distilled into the essential parts for our\npurposes as follows. The entropy: \n\n derives from degrees of freedom associated only with the geometry\nof the event horizon, not degrees of freedom associated with matter or\nspacetime geometry inside or outside the black hole; \n is finite because the fundamental structure of spacetime is\ndiscrete; \n is \u201cobjective\u201d because there is a distinguished\ncoarse-graining based on the fact that the horizon itself has a\ndistinguished geometry; \n and obeys the Second Law of thermodynamics because the effective\ndynamics of stuff outside the black hole does not obey the rules for\nstandard quantum evolution. \n\n\nThese theses concisely capture how radically different black-hole\nentropy is from ordinary thermodynamical entropy. The first, as is\nalready obvious from the Second Law of black hole mechanics,\nunderscores the fact that black-hole entropy is proportional to the\nsurface area of the system, not to the bulk volume as for ordinary\nthermodynamical systems. The second articulates the fact that the\nunderlying entities whose statistics are conjectured to give rise to\nthe entropy are the constituents of perhaps the most fundamental\nstructure in contemporary physics, spacetime itself, not high-level,\nderivative entities such as atoms, which are not fundamental in our\ndeepest theory of matter, quantum field theory. The third emphasizes\nthe fact that, contrary to the way that there is no\n\u201cnatural\u201d coarse-graining of underlying micro-degrees of\nfreedom in the statistical mechanics of ordinary matter, there is a\nunique natural one here, intimately related to the fact that the\ngeometry of the event horizon is unique, and the Planck scale provides\na measure of units of area thought by many to be physically privileged\n(albeit in a sense never made entirely clear). The fourth states that\nthe Second Law of black hole thermodynamics, generalized to include\ncontributions from both black holes and ordinary matter (as discussed\nin\n section 5.4\n below), is not a phenomenologically derived empirical generalization,\nas is the Second Law for ordinary matter; rather, it follows directly\nfrom the most fundamental dynamical principle, quantum evolution, in\nconjunction with the basic geometry of spacetimes in general\nrelativity. (This will be discussed further in\n section 6.2\n below.) This is of a piece with the fact that the Second Law for\nblack holes in the classical regime is a theorem of pure differential\ngeometry\n (section 5.1).\n \n\nIn so far as one takes Bekenstein entropy seriously as a true\nthermodynamical entropy, then, these differences strongly suggest that\nthe extension of entropy to black holes should modify and enrich our\nunderstanding not only of entropy as a physical quantity, but\ntemperature and heat as well, all in ways perhaps similar to what that\nof the extension of those classical quantities to electromagnetic\nfields did at the end of the 19th century (Curiel 2017a, \nOther Internet Resources).\n This raises immediate questions concerning the traditional\nphilosophical problems of inter-theoretic relations among physical\nquantities and physical principles as formulated in different\ntheories, and in particular problems of emergence, reduction, the\nreferential stability of physical concepts, and their possible\nincommensurability across theories. One could not ask for a more novel\ncase study to perhaps enliven these traditional debates. (See the\nentries\n Scientific Unity,\n Scientific Reduction, and\n Intertheory Relations in Physics.)\n \n\nDougherty and Callender (2019) have challenged orthodoxy here, as\nwell, by arguing that the many ways in which the area of a black hole\ndoes not behave like classical entropy strongly suggests that we\nshould be skeptical of treating it as such. Curiel (2017b, Other\nInternet Resources) attempts to rebut them using exactly the idea that\nany extension of a known physical quantity into a new regime will\ninevitably lead to modifications of the concept itself, and\nemendations in the relations it may enter into with other physical\nquantities. Thus, we should expect that black-hole entropy will not\nbehave like ordinary entropy, and it is exactly those differences that\nmay yield physical and philosophical insight into old puzzles. \n5.4. The Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics\n\nIn the context of thermodynamic systems containing black holes, one\ncan easily construct apparent violations of both the ordinary laws of\nthermodynamics and the laws of black holes if one applies these laws\nindependently of each other. So, for example, if a black hole emits\nradiation through the Hawking effect, then it will lose mass\u2014in\napparent violation of the classical Second Law of black hole\nmechanics. Likewise, as Bekenstein argued, we could violate the\nordinary Second Law of thermodynamics simply by dumping matter with\nhigh entropy into a black hole: for then the outside of the black\nhole, a causally isolated system, spontaneously decreases in entropy.\nThe price of dropping matter into the black hole, however, is that its\nevent horizon will increase in size. Likewise, the price of allowing\nthe event horizon to shrink by giving off Hawking radiation is that\nthe entropy of external matter fields will increase. This suggests\nthat we should formulate a combination of the two laws that stipulates\nthat the sum of a black hole's area and the entropy of external\nsystems can never decrease. This is the Generalized Second Law of\nthermodynamics (Bekenstein 1972, 1973, 1974). \n\nThe Second Law of ordinary thermodynamics has a long, distinguished,\nand contentious history in the Twentieth Century debates about the\nphilosophical foundations of physics, ramifying into virtually every\nimportant topic in the philosophy of physics in particular, and into\nmany important topics in philosophy of science in general, including:\nthe relation between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics; the\nMeasurement Problem of quantum mechanics, and the status and meaning\nof theories of quantum information and computation; the definition of\nvarious arrows of time and the relations among them; the so-called\nPast Hypothesis in cosmology; determinism; causation; prediction\nversus retrodiction; the nature of reasoning based on idealization and\napproximation; emergence and reduction; and problems with theory\nconfirmation. \n\nThat black holes and other purely gravitational and geometrical\nsystems possess an entropy naturally leads to the idea that the Second\nLaw of thermodynamics ought to be modified in order to accommodate that\nfact. It is an almost completely unexplored issue how this Generalized\nSecond Law itself may require modifications to the traditional\nquestions about the Second Law, and possibly lead to new insights\nabout them. Thus the postulation of the Generalized Second Law and its\nbroad acceptance by the physics community raises many interesting\npuzzles and questions. \n\nIn the remainder of this section, we will review the issues raised by\nthe Generalized Second Law that bear on those puzzles and questions,\nnamely that: contrary to the case in classical thermodynamics, the\nGeneralized Second Law admits not only of proof, but of many kinds of\nproof\n (Section 5.4.1);\n several different physically plausible mechanisms have been proposed\nthat seem to violate the Generalized Second Law\n (Section 5.4.2)\n under relatively benign conditions; the Generalized Second Law seems\nto allow for the possibility of formulating and proving the existence\nof a universal bound on the amount of entropy any physical system can\nhave, along with a related constellation of ideas known as\n\u2018holography\u2019\n (Section 5.4.3);\n and, contrary to the Second Law of classical thermodynamics, the\nGeneralized Second Law seems to imply novel and deep propositions of\ninterest in their own right\n (Section 5.4.4).\n The possible connection of the Generalized Second Law to the arrow of\ntime is discussed in\n Section 7\n below. \n5.4.1. A Dizzying Variety of Proofs\n\nThe ordinary Second Law of thermodynamics is, at bottom, an empirical\ngeneralization based on observation of the behavior of ordinary\nmaterial systems, albeit one with confirmation and thus entrenchment\nmore profound than probably any other single principle in all of\nphysics. One of the most remarkable features of the Generalized Second\nLaw, by contrast, is that it seems to admit of proof in ways much more\nmathematically rigorous than does the ordinary Second Law (such as,\ne.g., the proof of Flanagan et al. 2000, in the\ncontext of classical general relativity and theories of matter, and a\nnumber of proofs in different contexts given in and discussed by Wall\n2009). That already raises interesting philosophical questions about\nthe relations between what seems prima facie to be the\n\u201csame\u201d fundamental principle as formulated, evaluated and\ninterpreted in different physical theories. \n\nAt least as interesting, from both a physical and a philosophical\npoint of view, is the fact that the Generalized Second Law in fact\nadmits a wide variety of different ways of being proven (Wall 2009).\nSome of those ways are more mathematically rigorous than others, some\nmore physically perspicuous and intuitive, some more general, and\nalmost all have their respective validity in different regimes than\nthe others, using different types of physical systems, different\napproximations and idealizations, and different physical and\nmathematical starting points. \u201cProofs\u201d have been given,\nfor example, in the classical, hydrodynamic, semiclassical, and full\nquantum gravity regimes of black holes. \n\nAlthough the results of all those proofs are called by the same\nname\u2014the Generalized Second Law\u2014they seem prima\nfacie to be different physical principles, just because of the\nextreme differences in the assumptions and content of their respective\nproofs. Here is just a sample of some of the many questions and issues\none must take a stand on in order to formulate a version of the\nGeneralized Second Law and attempt to prove it. \n\n Black holes have different physically significant horizons apart\nfrom the event horizon (e.g., the so-called apparent\nhorizon)\u2014which horizon should one attribute entropy to? \n For statistical proofs, should one use the Gibbs or the Boltzmann\nentropy? \n What physical underpinning of black-hole entropy should one use\n(quantum entanglement entropy, quantum \u201catoms\u201d of\nspacetime, etc.)? \n Should one assume an entropy bound? (See\n Section 5.4.3\n below.) \n If the approximation or representation one uses to model the area\nof the chosen horizon admits quantum fluctuations, should one use the\naverage area, or some other way of massaging it so that it has\nsomething like a well defined classical area? \n What definition of \u201cquasi-stationary\u201d should one use?\n\n What definition of \u201cadabiatic\u201d should one use? \n\n\nThe dizzying variety of proofs on offer, which can be roughly\nclassified by how each answers these (and other related) questions,\nthus prompts the question: what is the relation among all the\ndifferent principles actually derived by each proof? Do they represent\nthe same physical principle as it manifests itself in different\nregimes, and as it is viewed from different perspectives? Again, the\nanswer one gives to this question will depend sensitively on,\ninter alia, one's views on inter-theoretic relations. Indeed,\nbecause different answers to these questions can lead to\n\u201cproofs\u201d that have, respectively, contradictory\nassumptions, one may well worry that the derived principle, if it is\nto be the same in all cases, will turn out to be a tautology! \n\nEven putting aside the contradictory assumptions used in different\nderivations, one should, in any event, note that one cannot try to\njustify the multifariousness of proofs by using an argument based on\nsomething like consilience, for it will not be consilience in anything\nlike the standard form. (See the entry on\n Scientific Discovery.)\n This is not a case in which the same equations or relations or model,\nor values of quantities, are being derived for a given phenomenon\nbased on studies of different types of interactions among different\ntypes of physical systems, as in the classic case of Perrin's\ncalculation of Avogadro's number. This is rather a case in which\ndifferent physical assumptions are made about the very same class of\nphysical systems and interactions among them, and calculations and\narguments made in very different physical and mathematical frameworks,\nwith no clear relation among them. \n5.4.2. Possible Violations\n\nWhen Bekenstein first proposed that a black hole should possess\nentropy, and that it should be proportional to its area, difficulties\nthat appeared insurmountable immediately appeared. In a colloquium\ngiven at Princeton at 1970, Geroch proposed a mechanism that seemed to\nshow that, if one could attribute a temperature to a black hole at\nall, it should be absolute zero; an immediate consequence of the\nworking of the mechanism showed that to do otherwise would seem to\nallow arbitrarily large violations of what was to become known as the\nGeneralized Second\n Law.[14]\n Far away from a black hole, prepare an essentially massless box to be\nfull of energetic radiation with a high entropy; then the mass of the\nradiation will be attracted by the black hole's gravitational force.\nOne can use this weight to drive an engine to produce energy\n(e.g., to produce friction from the raising of a\ncounter-weight) while slowly lowering the box towards the event\nhorizon of the black hole. This process extracts energy, but not\nentropy, from the radiation in the box. One can then arrange for all\nthe mass-energy of the radiation to have been exhausted when the box\nreaches the event horizon. If one then opens the box to let the\nradiation fall into the black hole, the size of the event horizon will\nnot increase (because the mass-energy of the black hole does not\nincrease), but the thermodynamic entropy outside the black hole has\ndecreased. Thus we seem to have violated the Generalized Second Law.\nMany ways to try to defuse the problem have been mooted in the\nliterature, from entropy bounds (discussed below in\n section 5.4.3)\n to the attribution of an effective buoyancy to the object being\nlowered due to its immersion in radiation generated by its\nacceleration (Unruh and Wald 1982), a consequence of the so-called\nUnruh effect (for an account of which, see\n note 16).\n None of them is completely satisfying. \n\nThe question of whether we should be troubled by this possible\nviolation of the Generalized Second Law touches on several issues in\nthe foundations of physics. The status of the ordinary Second Law is\nitself a thorny philosophical puzzle, quite apart from the issue of\nblack holes. Many physicists and philosophers deny that the ordinary\nSecond Law holds universally, so one might question whether we should\ninsist on its validity in the presence of black holes. On the other\nhand, the Second Law clearly captures some significant\nfeature of our world, and the analogy between black holes and\nthermodynamics seems too rich to be thrown out without a fight.\nIndeed, the Generalized Second Law is the only known physical law that\nunites the fields of general relativity, quantum mechanics, and\nthermodynamics. As such, it seems currently to be the most promising\nwindow we have into the most fundamental structures of the physical\nworld (for discussion of which, see\n section 6.3\n below). \n5.4.3. Entropy Bounds and the Holographic Principle\n\nIn response to the apparent violation of the Generalized Second Law\nconsequent on Geroch's proposed process, Bekenstein postulated a limit\nto how much entropy can be contained in a given region of spacetime in\norder to try to avoid such seeming violations, the limit being given\nby the entropy of a black hole whose horizon would encompass the\nregion. Current physics imposes no such limit, so Bekenstein (1981)\npostulated that the limit would be enforced by the underlying theory\nof quantum gravity that, it is hoped, black hole thermodynamics\nprovides our best current insight into. There is, moreover, a further,\nrelated reason that one might think that black hole thermodynamics\nimplies a fundamental upper bound on the amount of entropy that can be\ncontained in a given spacetime region. Suppose that there were more\nentropy in some region of spacetime than the Bekenstein entropy of a\nblack hole of the same size. Then one could collapse that entropic\nmatter into a black hole, which obviously could not be larger than the\nsize of the original region (or the matter would have already\ncollapsed to form a black hole). But this would violate the\nGeneralized Second Law, for the Bekenstein entropy of the resulting\nblack hole would be less than that of the matter that formed it. Thus\nthe Generalized Second Law itself appears to imply a fundamental limit\non how much entropy a region can contain (Bekenstein 1983; Bousso\n1999a, 2006). If this is right, it seems to be a deep insight into the\nfundamental structure of the world, and in particular it should\nprovide an important clue to the nature of an adequate theory of\nquantum gravity. \n\nArguments along these lines led \u2019t Hooft (1993, in\n OIR)\n to postulate the Holographic Principle (though the name is due to\nSusskind 1995). This principle claims that the number of fundamental\ndegrees of freedom in any spherical spatial region is given by the\nBekenstein entropy of a black hole of the same size as that region.\nThe Holographic Principle is notable not only because it postulates a\nwell-defined, finite number of degrees of freedom for any region, but\nalso because this number grows in proportion to the area surrounding\nthe region, not the volume. This flies in the face of the standard\npicture of the dynamics of all other known types of physical systems,\nwhether particles or fields. According to that picture, the entropy is\nmeasured by the number of possible ways something can be, and that\nnumber of ways increases as the volume of any spatial region. To the\ncontrary, if the Holographic Principle is correct then one spatial\ndimension of any physical system can, in a sense, be viewed as\nsuperfluous: the fundamental \u201cphysical story\u201d of a spatial\nregion is actually a story that can be told merely about the boundary\nof the region (Luminet 2016). \n\nStill, there are reasons to be skeptical of the validity of the\nproposed universal entropy bounds, and the corresponding Holographic\nPrinciple. Unruh and Wald (1982), in response to Bekenstein's\npostulated entropy bound, argued convincingly that there is a less\nad hoc way to save the Generalized Second Law, namely by\nexploiting the Unruh effect (for an explanation of which, see\n note 16).[15]\n Flanagan et al. (2000), moreover, have offered strong\narguments that the validity of the Generalized Second Law is\nindependent of Bousso's proposed entropy bound (widely thought to be\nsuperior to Bekenstein's original one), thus removing much of the\nprimary historical and conceptual motivation for the Holographic\nPrinciple. \n\nAgain, all these questions are of great interest in their own right in\nphysics, but there is strong reason to believe that their analysis may\nshed new light on several ongoing philosophical discussions about the\nnature of spacetime, with which they have obvious direct connections,\nespecially concerning the dimensionality of space and spacetime, and\nthe substantivalism-versus-relationalism debate. The interested reader\nshould see de Haro et al. (2015) for a discussion of the\nrelation of holography to gauge/gravity dualities in general, and a\nreview of the philosophical issues that raises, and Castellani (2016)\nfor philosophical discussion of the ontological issues raised by these\ndualities. \n5.4.4. Possible Consequences of the Generalized Second Law\n\nThe ordinary Second Law has profound philosophical implications. It\nis, however, rarely if ever used to prove other physical principles or\nresults of real depth, all of its important consequences being more or\nless immediate. Once again, the Generalized Second Law stands in\ncontrast to the ordinary Law, for, as has recently been realized, it\ncan be used to prove several physical results of deep interest, over\nand above heuristically motivating the Holographic Principle. \n\nIn a tour de force of physical argument, Wall (2013a, 2013b)\nshowed that assumption of the Generalized Second Law rules out\ntraversable wormholes, other forms of faster-than-light travel between\ndistant regions, negative masses for physical systems, and closed\ntimelike curves. (See the Encyclopedia entries\n Time Machines\n and\n Time Travel,\n and Visser 1996.) Furthermore, if the Generalized Second Law is to be\nsatisfied, then it is impossible for \u201cbaby universes\u201d that\neventually become causally independent of the mother universe to form.\nSuch baby universes and their eventual independence, however,\nconstitute the fundamental mechanism for currently popular\n\u201cmultiverse\u201d scenarios in cosmology. \n\nIn the same work, Wall also shows that the Generalized Second Law has\na striking positive conclusion: a \u201cquantum singularity\ntheorem\u201d, which shows that, even when quantum effects are taken\ninto account, spacetime will still be geodesically incomplete inside\nblack holes and to the past in cosmological models (like the currently\nmost well supported ones, which start with a Big Bang singularity).\nThis flies directly in the face of the pious hopes of most physicists\nthat quantum effects, and in particular the hoped-for theory of\nquantum gravity, will efface singularities from spacetime. (See,\ne.g., Ashtekar and Bojowald 2006, Ashtekar et al.\n2006, and Kiefer 2010 for typical sentiments along these lines, along\nwith typical arguments forwarded to support them, in the context of\ncanonical quantum gravity, and Roiban 2006 and Das 2007 for the same\nin the context of string theory; it is noteworthy that Roiban also\ndiscusses known cases where it appears that string theory does\nnot necessarily efface singularities.) \n\nAnother striking positive consequence of the Generalized Second Law is\nthat it allows one to derive energy conditions in the context of\ngeneral relativity. An energy condition is, crudely speaking, a\nrelation one demands the properties of matter to satisfy in order to\ntry to capture the idea that \u201cmass-energy should be\npositive\u201d. Energy conditions play a central and fundamental role\nin general relativity, since they are needed as assumptions in\nessentially every deep, major result proven in the last 60 years,\nespecially those pertaining to singularities and black holes (Curiel\n2017). One thing that makes them unusual is the fact that, uniquely\namong the central and fundamental tenets of general relativity, they\nthemselves do not admit of derivation or proof based on other such\nprinciples. At least, no such derivations or proofs were known until\nvery recently, when Wall (2010) argued that the Generalized Second Law\nimplies one. There are several problematic aspects to Wall's argument\n(Curiel 2017), but the mere fact that he was able to produce a\nprima facie decent one at all is remarkable, showing that the\nGeneralized Second Law may be a very deep physical principle indeed.\nOne, however, may contrarily conclude that the argument shows rather\nthat the Generalized Second Law is a contingent matter, depending\nsensitively on the kinds of matter fields that actually exist\u2014if\nmatter fields were such as to violate the energy condition Wall argued\nfor, then his argument would show that the Generalized Second Law is\nnot valid. \n\nFinally, Bousso et al. (2016) showed that a form of the\nGeneralized Second Law applicable to generalized horizons strongly\nsuggests that causal geodesics in the regime where quantum field\ntheory effects become important will focus and converge on each even\nwhen the standard energy conditions are violated. This is significant\nbecause it is propositions about the focusing properties of geodesics\nthat lie at the heart of all the standard singularity theorems and\nmost other results about horizons of all kinds, and all of the\npropositions that show focusing assume a standard energy condition. If\nthis conjecture is correct, it would provide further strong evidence\nthat quantum effects may not remove singularities from generic\nspacetimes. \n5.5. General Gravitational Entropy\n\nThat black holes, purely gravitational objects, possess a physical\nentropy strongly suggests that the gravitational field itself in\ngeneral may possess entropy, as Penrose (1979) hypothesized. Indeed,\nthere are a number of reasons to suspect that the thermodynamical\ncharacter of gravity should extend to gravitational systems and\nstructures beyond just those provided by black holes. Because\ngravitational \u201ccharge\u201d (i.e., mass-energy) comes\nwith only one sign (as opposed, e.g., to electromagnetic\ncharge, which can be of either positive or negative sign), bits of\nmatter tend to accelerate towards each other, other things being\nequal. This already suggests that gravity has a built-in\nthermodynamical character, since it provides an objective, invariant\nmeasure of a direction for time: it is characteristic of future\ntime-flow that bits of matter tend to accelerate towards each other,\nand so become more inhomogeneous in the aggregate. (See\n section 7\n for discussion of the possible relation of gravitational entropy to\nan arrow of time.) \n\nSince the work of Gibbons and Hawking (1977), Bekenstein (1981),\nSmolin (1984), Bousso (1999a), Jacobson and Parentani (2003), and\nPadmanabhan (2005), among others, it has been known that an entropy\nand a temperature can be attributed to spacetime horizons more general\nthan just the event horizon of a black hole. From another direction,\nthe attractiveness of Penrose's Conformal Curvature Hypothesis\n(Penrose 1979), discussed below in\n section 7,\n along with subsequent work attempting to make the Hypothesis precise,\nall suggest that certain types of cosmological singularities, such as\nthe Big Bang, should themselves be attributed an entropy. This has led\nin recent years to several interesting proposals for a completely\ngeneral measure of gravitational entropy, such as that of Clifton\net al. (2013). Indeed, Anastopoulos and Savvido (2012) have\neven attempted to attribute entropy directly to non-cosmological\nsingularities, those associated with collapse phenomena. Pav\u00f3n\nand Zimdahl (2012), in a similar spirit, attempt to provide a\nthermodynamical analysis of future cosmological singularities and so\ncharacterize them by their thermodynamical properties. \n\nThese facts raise several fundamental puzzles about the nature of\nentropy as a physical quantity and the relations among the different\ntheories that involve it. How can such a quantity, which hitherto has\nbeen attributed only to material systems such as fluids and Maxwell\nfields, be attributed to simple regions of spacetime itself? How does\ngeneral gravitational entropy relate to more standard forms of\nentropy, and how may the nature of general gravitational entropy\nitself inform our understanding of the standard forms? Does it shed\nnew light on traditional general philosophical topics of interest,\nsuch as questions about reduction and emergence of thermodynamics to\nand from statistical mechanics? \n6. Black Holes and Quantum Theory\n\nAs discussed already in\n Section 5.2\n and\n Section 5.3,\n it is the addition of quantum field theory to general relativity that\ndefinitively settles the issue of the thermodynamical character of\nblack holes. There are, however, many other fascinating phenomena that\narise when one adds quantum field theory to the mix of black holes and\nsingularities, and general relativity in general, than just that, and\na concomitant broadening and deepening of the philosophical issues and\npuzzles that confront us. \n\nIn\n Section 6.1,\n we discuss the Hawking effect (the predicted emission by black holes\nof thermal radiation) and its associated problems and puzzles in\ndetail. One puzzle in particular that seems to follow the prediction\nof the Hawking effect has exercised physicists and philosophers the\nmost, the so-called Information Loss Paradox: the evaporation of black\nholes by the emission of Hawking radiation seems to lead in the end to\na violation of one of the most fundamental tenets of quantum\nmechanics. We discuss that in\n Section 6.2.\n We conclude in\n Section 6.3\n with an examination of the claims that black hole thermodynamics\nprovides the best evidence to guide us in the search for a theory of\nquantum gravity. \n6.1. Hawking Radiation\n\nIn light of the notorious difficulty of constructing a theory that\nincorporates and marries quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity\u2014a theory of quantum gravity\u2014it may come as a\nsurprise to learn that there is a consistent, rigorous theory of\nquantum fields posed on the background of a classical relativistic\nspacetime. (Wald 1994 is a standard text on the subject; Jacobson\n[2003, in\n OIR]\n gives a less rigorous overview, discussing possible relations to\nproposed theories of quantum gravity; Wald [2006b, in\n OIR]\n gives a synoptic history of the technical aspects of the entire\nsubject, and an exposition of the advances in the field subsequent to\nthe publication of Wald 1994; and Hollands and Wald 2015 provides a\ntechnically sophisticated overview of the most recent results.)\nQuantum field theory on curved spacetime, however, differs from\nstandard quantum field theory (set on the flat Minkowski spacetime of\nspecial relativity) in one profound respect, that difference ramifying\ninto every part of the theory: a generic relativistic spacetime has no\ngroup of symmetries comparable to the Poincar\u00e9 Group for\nspecial relativity. There is correspondingly no distinguished vacuum\nstate and no natural notion of a particle. This means, for instance,\nthat one cannot employ many familiar and useful techniques from\nstandard quantum field theory, and one must take care in the use of\nmost of the others. \n\nOne expects that such a framework would find its most natural\napplication in the treatment of problems in which, in some sense or\nother, the curvature of spacetime is well above the Planck length, in\nso far as there are some theoretical grounds for suspecting that in\nthis regime one can safely ignore any quantum properties of the\nspacetime geometry itself. (Hence, the framework is often called\n\u2018the semi-classical approximation\u2019 or\n\u2018semi-classical gravity\u2019.) In this vein, its most popular\nand successful applications have been to problems involving particle\ncreation in the early universe and in the vicinity of black holes.\nNow, according to general relativity a black hole ought to be a\nperfect sink for energy, mass and radiation, in so far as it absorbs\neverything (including light), and emits nothing (including light). It\nwas therefore more than shocking when Hawking (1974, 1975) predicted\nthat, when quantum effects are taken into account, a black hole ought\nto behave rather like a perfect black body, in the sense of ordinary\nstatistical thermodynamics: a stationary black hole should emit\nthermal radiation with the Planckian power spectrum characteristic of\na perfect blackbody at a fixed temperature. It glows like a lump of\nsmoldering coal even though light should not be able to escape from\n it![16]\n\n\nAs with the Generalized Second Law, one of the most fascinating\naspects of Hawking radiation from a foundational point of view is the\nmultiplicity and multifariousness of the derivations known for it.\nThey also differ radically among themselves with regard to the\nmathematical rigor of the framework they adopt and the mathematical\ncharacter of the structures they assume, and almost all are valid in\ndifferent regimes than the others, using different types of physical\nsystems and different approximations and idealizations, basing their\narguments on different physical principles, with varying degrees of\nphysical perspecuity and intuitiveness. In consequence, these\ndifferent derivations seem to suggest different physical\ninterpretations of Hawking radiation itself, both for its origin and\nfor its character (Brout et al. 1995). It is thus not even\nclear, at a foundational level, what the physical content of the\nprediction of Hawking radiation is. Indeed, as in the case of the\nGeneralized Second Law, some of the derivations of Hawking radiation\nmake assumptions that seem to contradict some of the assumptions of\nother derivations\u2014but if A implies B and\nnot-A implies B, then B must be a tautology.\nSince this is an unappealing attitude to take towards Hawking\nradiation, some other way must be found to reconcile the contrary\nderivations. Again, standard consilience cannot be invoked here, for\nthe same reasons as discussed at the end of\n section 5.4.1\n for different proofs of the Generalized Second Law. \n\nBecause the interpretation of quantum field theory itself, even in the\nflat spacetime of special relativity, is already so contested, fraught\nwith problems, and just poorly understood in general (see the\nEncyclopedia entry\n Quantum Field Theory),\n one may think that there is even less of a chance here to get a grip\non such issues. Contrarily, one may also think that the very fact that\nthe phenomena are so different here than in ordinary quantum field\ntheory may suggest or afford us new avenues of approach to the\ntraditional problems that have so long frustrated us. \n6.2. Information Loss Paradox\n\nThe existence of Hawking radiation has a remarkable consequence: as\nHawking (1976) pointed out and Unruh (1976) elaborated, the fact that\na black hole radiates implies that it loses mass-energy, and so will\nshrink, in seeming violation of the Area Theorem. (The Area Theorem is\nnot in fact violated; rather, one of its assumptions is,\nviz., that locally energy is always strictly positive.)\nBecause there is no limit to this process except that imposed by the\ntotal initial mass of the black hole itself, eventually the black hole\nwill radiate itself entirely away\u2014it evaporates. This prediction\nclearly bears on the issue of cosmic censorship: if the end-state of\nthe evaporation leaves the previously hidden singularity open for the\nrest of the universe to see, all the potential problems raised in\n section 4\n can arise. \n\nThere is, however, a seemingly even deeper problem posed by the\npossibility of black-hole evaporation, one that raises doubts about\nthe possibility of describing black holes using any standard\nformulation of quantum theory. According to standard quantum theory,\nthe entropy of a closed system never changes; this is captured\nformally by the nature of the evolution of a quantum system, by the\ntechnical property of unitarity. Unitary evolution guarantees that the\ninitial conditions, together with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (the\nequation governing the temporal evolution of quantum systems), will\nfix the future state of the system. Likewise, a reverse application of\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation will take us from the later state back\nto the original initial state. In other words, the states at each time\ncontain enough information to fix the states at all other times, given\nthe unitarity of dynamical evolution for quantum systems. Thus there\nis a sense in which the completeness of the state is\nmaintained by the standard time evolution in quantum theory. (See the\nentry\n Quantum Theory.)\n \n\nIt is usual to characterize this feature by the claim that quantum\nevolution \u201cpreserves information\u201d. If one begins with a\nsystem in a precisely known quantum state, then quantum theory\nguarantees that the details about that system will evolve in such a\nway that one can infer the precise state of the system at some later\ntime, and vice versa. This quantum preservation of details implies\nthat if we burn a chair, for example, it would in principle be\npossible to perform a complete set of measurements on all the outgoing\nradiation, the smoke, and the ashes, and reconstruct exactly what the\nchair looked like. If we were instead to throw the chair into a black\nhole, however, then orthodoxy holds that as a consequence of the No\nHair Theorems (discussed in\n section 3.2\n above) it would be physically impossible for the details about the\nchair ever to escape to the outside universe. This might not be a\nproblem if the black hole continued to exist for all time, since one\ncould then assume the information encoded in the chair still existed\nbehind the event horizon, preserved by the unitary evolution in that\nregion. The existence of Hawking radiation, however, tells us that the\nblack hole is giving off energy, and thus it will shrink down and\npresumably will eventually disappear altogether, along with whatever\nstuff had fallen past the event horizon before that. At that point,\nthe details about the chair will be irrevocably lost; thus such\nevolution cannot be described by the standard laws of quantum theory.\nThis is the Information Loss Paradox of quantum black holes\n(Hawking\n 1976).[17]\n Although the paradox is usually formulated in terms of\n\u201cinformation\u201d, the issues is often put here as being the\nmaintenance of correlations between different systems, as this is a\nphysically more perspicuous notion that lies at the bottom of the\nparadox, and is much less problematic than the notoriously vexed and\nnebulous concept of \u201cinformation\u201d. \n\nThe attitude that individual physicists adopt towards this problem is\nstrongly influenced by their intuitions about which theory, general\nrelativity or quantum theory, will have to be modified to achieve a\nconsistent theory of quantum gravity. Spacetime physicists tend to\nview non-standard quantum evolution as a fairly natural consequence of\nsingular spacetimes: one would not expect all the details of systems\nat earlier times to be available at later times if they were lost in a\nsingularity. Hawking (1976), for example, argued that the paradox\nshows that the full theory of quantum gravity will be a theory that\ndoes not obey the standard dynamical principles of quantum theory, and\nhe began working to develop such a theory very soon after first\npromulgating the paradox. (He has since abandoned this position.)\nUnruh and Wald (2017) develop an extended review and defense of this\nposition. Particle physicists (such as superstring theorists),\nhowever, tend to view black holes as being just another state of a\nquantum field. If two particles were to collide at extremely high\nenergies, they would form a very small black hole. This tiny black\nhole would have a very high Hawking temperature, and thus it would\nvery quickly give off many high-energy particles and disappear.\n(Recall, as discussed in\n section 5.2\n above, that Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the mass\nof black hole.) Such a process would look very much like a standard\nhigh-energy scattering experiment: two particles collide and their\nmass-energy is then converted into showers of outgoing particles. The\nfact that all known scattering processes obey the standard dynamical\nprinciples of quantum theory, and above all unitarity, then, seems to\ngive us some reason to expect that black hole formation and\nevaporation should also do so.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe reactions to the puzzle are legion. (A helpful overview of earlier\nstages of this debate can be found in Belot et al. 1999.) It\nis useful to classify them as belonging to one of six broad groupings:\n\n\n the argument for information loss is valid, and black hole\nevaporation violates the standard principle of quantum evolution;\n\n the quantum correlations between physical systems that fall into\nthe black hole and those that remain outside are not lost but are\nrather stored in a \u201cremnant\u201d of the black hole, which\nfails to evaporate entirely; \n the correlations are not lost, but come out (slowly) as\nnon-thermal correlations in the Hawking radiation itself; \n the correlations are not lost, for one reason or another, but\nonly appear to be lost depending on the state of the observer; \n the conclusion of the argument for information loss is an\nartifact of the invalidity of the semi-classical approximation at\nrelevant periods and scales of the evaporation, and a full,\nnon-perturbative calculation will show that the correlations are not\nin fact lost; \n the semi-classical calculation is valid, but its result does not\nbear on the issue of the nature of the fundamental equations of\nevolution; one should remain agnostic about whether or not\ncorrelations are lost. \n\n\nIn particular, today there are four main ways of trying to address the\nproblem that have a fair amount of support in different segments of\nthe physics community: \n\n acceptance of the loss of unitarity (the first response); \n black hole complementarity, an instance of the fourth kind of\nresponse; \n firewalls, an instance of the fifth; \n Hawking radiation's deviation from perfect thermality, an\ninstance of the third. \n\n\nWe will briefly sketch each of them, along with their pros and cons.\nChakraborty and Lochan (2017), Bryan and Medved (2017), Marolf (2017),\nand Unruh and Wald (2017) provide recent reviews of the most popular\napproaches, with Marolf's emphasizing possible approaches that save\nunitarity, and Unruh and Wald's emphasizing ones that violate it. (See\nMathur 2009 and Chen et al. 2015 for recent discussions of\napproaches based on remnants, which we will not cover here.) \n\nThe arguments that we should accept the calculations that predict\nfailure of unitarity at face value are straightforward (Unruh and Wald\n2017). The calculations represent a regime (the semi-classical one) in\nwhich we have good theoretical grounds for trusting our theoretical\nmachinery, and nothing is required that deviates from standard\napplications of quantum field theory and general relativity,\nrespectively. Even though there is failure of unitarity, there is no\nviolation of conservation of probability\u2014all quantum\nprobabilities sum to 1 over the course of the entire\nevolution\u2014and there is no other manifest form of indeterminism\npresent. Nor is there any violation of energy conservation attendant\non the failure of unitarity, as some have alleged must happen. Unitary\nevolution, moreover, is arguably not a fundamental tenet of\nquantum theory: so long as probability is conserved, one can calculate\nwith confidence. Indeed, there are examples of just such non-unitary,\nbut probability-conserving and energy-conserving evolution in standard\napplications of ordinary quantum theory, with no need for anything as\nhigh-falutin' as quantum field theory on curved spacetime and black\nhole thermodynamics (Unruh 2012). \n\nThe conclusion, however\u2014that what many still take to be one of\nthe most fundamental principles of quantum theory is violated\u2014is\ntoo distasteful for many physicists to swallow, especially those\ntrained in the tradition of particle physics, where unitarity is taken\nto be inviolate. The sanguine acceptance of the loss of unitarity\nseems to come mostly from the trust the physicists in question have in\ngeneral relativity. This raises the question why general relativity\nought to be trusted enough in this regime to conclude that unitarity\nwill fail in any deeper quantum theory, but not trusted enough when it\ncomes to the prediction of singularities\n (section 2.2)\u2014on\n what grounds do they pick and choose when and when not to trust it?\nThis question becomes especially piquant when one considers that loss\nof unitarity is, on its face, an extraordinarily strong constraint to\nplace on any proposed theory of quantum gravity, especially when it\ncomes from a calculation made in the context of a merely effective and\nnot a fundamental theory, and when it is exactly that still unknown\nfundamental theory that is supposed to efface singularities. In any\nevent, Manchak and Weatherall (2018) have recently argued that, even\nif one does accept loss of unitarity\u2014what seems to be a\nstraightforward conclusion of the standard calculations\u2014the\nstate of affairs is still justly called paradoxical. \n\nThe idea of black-hole complementarity, initiated by Susskind et\nal. (1993), tries to resolve the paradox by pointing out that the\nself-description of the experience of an astronaut falling into a\nblack hole will differ from the description made by an external\nobserver, and then playing the contrary descriptions off each other in\na dialectical fashion. It has been the subject of philosophical\ncontroversy because it includes apparently incompatible claims, and\nthen tries to reconcile them by appeal to a form of so-called quantum\ncomplementarity, or (so charge the critics) simple-minded\nverificationism (Belot et al. 1999). An outside observer will\nnever see the infalling astronaut pass through the event horizon.\nInstead, she will seem to hover just above the horizon for all time\n(as discussed in\n section 3.1\n above). But all the while, the black hole will also be giving off\nheat, shrinking, and getting ever hotter. The black hole\ncomplementarian therefore suggests that an outside observer should\nconclude that the infalling astronaut gets burned up before she\ncrosses the event horizon, with the result that all the details about\nher state will be returned in the outgoing radiation, just as would be\nthe case if she and her belongings were incinerated in a more\nconventional manner; thus the information (and standard quantum\nevolution) is saved. \n\nThis suggestion, however, flies in the face of the fact that for an\ninfalling observer, nothing out of the ordinary would be experienced\nat the event horizon (as discussed in\n section 3.1\n above). Indeed, in general she could not even know that she was\npassing through an event horizon at all, unless classical general\nrelativity were very wrong in regimes where we expect no quantum\neffects to show themselves. This obviously contradicts the suggestion\nthat she might be burned up as she passes through the horizon. The\nblack hole complementarian tries to resolve this contradiction by\nagreeing that the infalling observer will notice nothing\nremarkable at the horizon, but then suggests that the account of the\ninfalling astronaut should be considered to be complementary to the\naccount of the external observer, rather in the same way that position\nand momentum are complementary descriptions of quantum particles\n(Susskind et al. 1993). The fact that the infalling observer\ncannot communicate to the external world that she survived her passage\nthrough the event horizon is supposed to imply that there is no\ngenuine contradiction here. This solution to the information\nloss paradox has been criticized for making an illegitimate appeal to\nverificationism (Belot et al. 1999). Bokulich (2005), to the\ncontrary, argues that the most fruitful way of viewing black hole\ncomplementarity is as a novel suggestion for how a non-local theory of\nquantum gravity will recover the local behavior of quantum field\ntheory while accommodating the novel physics of black holes. \n\nAlmheiri et al. (2013) have recently claimed that black hole\ncomplementarity is not viable on different, more physically oriented\ngrounds. They argue that the following three statements, assumed by\nblack-hole complementarity, cannot all be true: (i) Hawking radiation\nis in a pure state; (ii) the information carried by the radiation is\nemitted from the region near the horizon, with low energy effective\nfield theory (i.e., the standard semi-classical\napproximation) valid beyond some microscopic distance from the\nhorizon; and (iii) the infalling observer encounters nothing unusual\nat the horizon. Based on powerful grounds for believing the first two\npropositions, they conclude that the appropriate response to the\nparadox is to posit that there is a \u201cfirewall\u201d at the\nevent horizon: the flux of Hawking radiation from the black hole\nbecomes in general so intense that highly accelerated infalling bodies\nare themselves incinerated as soon as they enter the black hole. This\nproposal is too recent for any consensus to have been reached about\nits viability; vigorous debate about it is ongoing. \n\nPerhaps the physically most conservative\u2014and correlatively the\nphilosophically least thrilling\u2014proposal is to deny the implicit\nassumption that during black-hole evaporation the deviations of\nHawking radiation from exact thermality are negligible. Thus the\nproblem prima facie does not ever arise, because all the\nquantum information does manage to escape in those non-thermal\ncorrelations. This proposal faces the serious challenge of showing\nthat such non-thermal corrections are rich and large enough to carry\naway all possible information encoded in all possible bodies falling\ninto black holes. Hawking et al. (2016) argue, in this vein,\nthat black holes do indeed have hair, violating the No Hair theorems,\nwhich makes possible the maintenance of correlations between early and\nlate time Hawking radiation in such a way as to preserve information.\nDvali (2015) argues that exact thermality of Hawking radiation, in\nconjunction with other well established results about black hole\nthermodynamics and quantum field theory on curved spacetime, imply\nthat the black-hole entropy would be infinite; thus, he concludes,\nthere must be large deviations from thermality. Any such\nargument, note, will have to conclude that the deviations from perfect\nthermality are large\u2014otherwise there would be no hope of\nencoding enough information to record recovery data about every\nphysical system that fell into the black hole before evaporation.\nAgain, the particular arguments in favor of this sort of proposal are\ntoo recent for real consensus one way or another to have been\nachieved. \n\nThe evaporation of black holes has another startling consequence that\nraises far-reaching philosophical and physical problems for our\ncurrent picture of quantum field theory and particle physics: it\nimplies that baryon and lepton number need not be conserved. Suppose a\nneutron star composed of \u223c1057 baryons collapses to\nform a black hole. After evaporation, the resultant baryon number is\nessentially zero, since it is overwhelmingly likely that the black\nhole will radiate particles of baryon number zero. (The radiation is\nnot energetic enough to produce baryons, until, perhaps, the very late\nstages of the evaporation.) This issue seems not to have agitated\nresearchers in either the particle physics or the general relativity\ncommunity so much as the idea of non-standard quantum evolution even\nthough conservation of baryons and leptons are surely principles as\nwell entrenched as that of the unitarity of quantum\n evolution.[18]\n One could perhaps argue that they are even more entrenched, since our\nempirical evidence for the conservation principles is simple and\nimmediate in a way that our evidence for standard evolution is not:\none simply counts particles before and after an observed\ninteraction\u2014interpretational questions arising from the\nMeasurement Problem in quantum theory and a possible\n\u201ccollapse\u201d of the wave function do not bear on it. (See\nthe entry\n Quantum Mechanics.)\n \n\nOkon and Sudarsky (2017) have in fact recently argued that there is an\nintimate connection between the Information Loss Paradox and the\nMeasurement Problem in quantum mechanics. Their arguments raise\nfurther questions about the Information Loss Paradox. Why are\nphysicists so exercised by the possible violation of unitarity\nseemingly entailed by black-hole evaporation, when almost all of those\nself-same physicists do not worry at all about the Measurement Problem\nof quantum mechanics, and the seeming violations of unitarity that\nhappen every time a measurement is performed? One possible explanation\nis perhaps best described as \u201csociological\u201d: most\ntheoreticians, as the ones involved in this debate, never model\nexperiments, and so do not face the Measurement Problem directly in\ntheir work. Thus it is generally not an issue that is at the forefront\nof their thought. Along the same lines, many theoreticians in this\narea also work in cosmology, in which one considers the \u201cwave\nfunction of the universe\u201d, an object that seems not to admit of\nexternal observers making measurements on it, and so the issue of\ncollapse does not arise in their work. Perhaps a more intriguing\nexplanation, one not discussed by Okon and Sudarsky, is that the\nInformation Loss Paradox provides an explicit physical mechanism for\nviolations of unitarity. It is perhaps easier to dismiss seeming\nviolations of unitarity during measurements as an artifact of our lack\nof understanding of quantum mechanics, not as a reflection of what\nhappens in the world. One cannot dismiss the possible violation of\nunitarity in the Information Loss Paradox with such equanimity: it\nappears to be an integral, explicit part of a model of the behavior of\na physically possible system, with an articulated mechanism for\nbringing it about. \n\nRecently, Wallace (2020) has introduced philosophers to another\npuzzle, intimately related to information loss in the context of\nblack-hole evaporation. For lack of a better term, and so as to\ndistinguish it from the standard problem, we call this\n\u2018Page-time paradox\u2019, as it was first formulated by Page\n(1993), and turns on calculation of a distinguished time in the\nevolution of an evaporating black hole, the so-called Page time, that\ntime at which half of the black hole's original entropy has been\nradiated away. Page showed that there is a manifest inconsistency\nbetween a treatment of black hole evaporation that is wholly\nformulated in the terms of statistical mechanics, and the standard\nsemi-classical treatment used in derivations of Hawking radiation.\nWallace argues forcefully that this puzzle is incontrovertibly\nparadoxical, completely divorced from the issue of whether or not\nunitarity fails, and raises deep philosophical problems of its own.\n\n\nIn sum, the debate over the Information Loss Paradox highlights the\nconceptual importance of the relationship between different effective\ntheories. At root, the debate is over where and how our effective\nphysical theories will break down: where can they be trusted, and\nwhere must they be replaced by a more adequate theory? This has\nobvious connections to the issue of how we are to interpret the\nontology of merely effective physical descriptions, and how we are to\nunderstand the problems of emergence and reduction they raise. (See,\ne.g., Williams 2017 for an interesting survey of such issues\nin the context of quantum field theory on flat spacetime.) The\nInformation Loss Paradox ramifies into questions of ontology in other\nways as well. When matter forms a black hole, it is transformed into a\npurely gravitational entity. When a black hole evaporates, spacetime\ncurvature is transformed into ordinary matter. Thus black holes appear\nto be crucial for our understanding of the relationship between matter\nand spacetime, and so provide an important arena for investigating the\nontology of spacetime, of material systems, and of the relations\nbetween them. \n6.3. A Path to Quantum Gravity?\n\nBlack hole thermodynamics and results concerning quantum fields in the\npresence of strong gravitational fields more generally are without a\ndoubt the most widely accepted, most deeply trusted set of conclusions\nin theoretical physics in which our current best, deepest\ntheories\u2014general relativity and quantum field theory\u2014work\ntogether in seemingly fruitful harmony. Indeed, that black holes\npossess a physical temperature and entropy, and correlatively that\nthere is a hitherto unsuspected and profound connection among gravity,\nquantum field theory and thermodynamics, is now as widely accepted an\nidea in theoretical physics as an idea with no direct empirical\nsubstantiation can be. As such, the study of black hole thermodynamics\nprima facie holds out the most promise for guidance in our\nsearch for a deeper theory of quantum gravity, in which the two would\nbe intimately combined in a unified account of all known physical\nphenomena, from the behavior of quarks at the scale of\n10-17 cm, to the cosmological structure of superclusters of\ngalaxies at the scale of 1032 cm. (See the entry\n Quantum Gravity.)\n What is not widely shared is the vision of the path that this\nguidance purportedly shows us. \n\nI list only a small sample of the many foundational and philosophical\nissues that arise here. A full discussion is beyond the scope of this\narticle. \n\n Given the apparent need for an underlying statistical mechanics\nto ground the thermodynamical behavior of black holes, does that imply\nthat spacetime itself at the most fundamental levels must have a\ndiscrete structure? (See, e.g., Sorkin 2005 and Oriti 2014.)\n\n If so, in what sense does classical, continuous spacetime\nstructure \u201cemerge\u201d from that underlying discrete\nstructure? (See, e.g., Oriti 2014 and W\u00fcthrich 2017.)\n\n Does the thermodynamical character of gravity suggest that the\nEinstein field equation of general relativity ought to be considered\nitself only an effective equation of state (e.g., Jacobson\n1995), and so therefore not itself an appropriate candidate to serve\nas the basis for an attempt to \u201cquantize\u201d gravity? \n If so, can gravity itself be derived as a purely thermodynamical\nphenomenon (e.g., Padmanabhan 2015 and Jacobson 2016)? \n How can a set of theoretical models derived by extending two\nseemingly mutually inconsistent theories into regimes far beyond our\nexperimental reach, based on nothing but our intuitions about which\nfundamental physical principles to hold on to and which to let go,\nprovide evidence for anything? \n\n\nWallace (2019) provides an overview of the relation of black hole\nthermodynamics to a few programs in quantum gravity, especially those\nrelated to string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence, and\nassociated foundational problems. \n7. Cosmology and the Arrow of Time\n\nThe Second Law of thermodynamics has long been connected to the\nseeming asymmetry of the arrow of time, that time seems to flow, so to\nspeak, in only one direction for all systems no matter how different\nin kind they are and no matter how spatiotemporally separated. Indeed,\none of the fundamental problems is that different types of system seem\nprima facie to give rise to independent arrows of time,\ne.g., thermodynamical, electromagnetic, cosmological, and so\non, with no a priori reason why they should all point in the\nsame direction. (See Zeh 2014 for a thorough recent review; see also\nthe Encyclopaedia entry\n Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time.)\n The Generalized Second Law and the corresponding idea of general\ngravitational entropy\n (section 5.5)\n introduces a new possible arrow of time, the gravitational. \n\nThere is a peculiar and intimate relation between the Second Law of\nordinary thermodynamics and time. That physical systems always seem to\nchange in such a way that entropy never decreases picks out a\nprivileged direction in time, as it were. At the present moment, there\nare two \u201cdirections\u201d in time one may consider: that\npointing to the future, and that to the past. The Second Law says,\nroughly speaking, that order never spontaneously increases toward the\nfuture. Looking back towards the past, however, that is exactly how it\nmay appear to us: if one thinks of the ordinary change of physical\nsystems as running backwards in time, then it will exactly appear as\nthough order is spontaneously increasing. \n\nThat fact is already on its own remarkable: all other known\nfundamental principles and laws of physics are time-symmetric (putting\naside the minuscule violations of time-reversal symmetry manifested by\nthe weak nuclear force). That means that if a given sequence of\nchanges of a physical system governed by those principles and laws is\nallowed, then the same sequence in reversed order is also allowed as a\nphysical possibility. If a tea cup drops to the floor and smashes into\nlittle bits, then the reverse process is also possible: the smashed\nbits can spontaneously leap up into the air towards each other and\nre-assemble into an undamaged tea cup. If an antenna can absorb a\ngiven type of radio wave, it can also emit that same wave. And so on.\nThat is not what we see in physical systems governed by thermodynamics\nand the Second Law. An ice cube in a glass of warm water spontaneously\nmelts, and the water cools a bit. We never see a cool glass of water\nspontaneously warm while an ice cube forms in the middle of it. This\nis even more mysterious when one considers the fact that we know that\nthe water and ice are, at a deeper level of description, really just a\ncollection of an enormous number of molecules and atoms themselves\nmoving around, bouncing off each other, and connected\ntogether\u2014and, to the best of our knowledge, the principles and\nlaws governing the changes in that collection of molecules\nare time symmetric. Why is it that the laws governing the\nmicro-structure of water and ice are time symmetric, but, when one\nlooks at the water and ice in the aggregate, ignoring the fine details\nof the micro-structure, the governing principle becomes time\nasymmetric? That is one of the deepest and most hotly debated\nquestions in the foundations of physics. \n\nThis all raises a second question: if entropy tends only to increase,\nand so order in the universe continually degrades, where did all the\norder around us come from in the first place? Life, for instance,\nseems like an extraordinarily highly structured phenomenon. Living\norganisms are much more highly structured than the air and earth and\nwater surrounding us, and certainly more so than the food we consume\nto build and replenish our highly structured bodies. The same holds\ntrue of planets themselves, stars, galaxies, and clusters and\nsuperclusters of galaxies\u2014they all are prima facie much\nmore highly ordered and structured than the homogeneous and highly\nrarefied plenum of interstellar dust surrounding them, and the vast\nreaches of empty space itself. How did such highly structured physical\nsystems evolve in the first place? Are they all not manifestly a\nviolation of the Second Law? (See Schr\u00f6dinger 1944 for the\nlocus classicus of discussion of these issues.) \n\nIndeed, the problem for physical systems on the cosmological scale\n(planetary systems and larger) is made even more urgent by what we\nknow about conditions in the very early universe, very soon after the\nBig Bang, that we think obtained at the start of the cosmos. We have\nstrong evidence that the very early universe consisted of a highly\nhomogeneous, extremely hot and condensed gaseous soup of fundamental\nparticles. According to ordinary thermodynamics, however, that is a\nstate of extremely high entropy. That such a physical system evolved\ninto ordered structures such as stars and galaxies\u2014prima\nfacie a state of much lower entropy for the same matter and\nenergy now redistributed\u2014seems on the face of it to be a massive\nviolation of the Second Law. \n\nOne might with some justice ask: well, so what? Entrenched scientific\ntheories and principles get overthrown all the time. The caloric\ntheory of heat got overthrown by thermodynamics and the theory of\nmolecular kinetics. Classical Newtonian mechanics got overthrown by\nquantum mechanics. Newtonian gravitational theory got overthrown by\ngeneral relativity. Now the evidence from cosmology tells us that the\nSecond Law is just one more in a long line of principles that have not\npassed the test of confrontation with empirical data. That response,\nhowever, does not do justice to the profound faith that physicists\nhave in the Second Law. When Einstein was once asked what he thought\nphysics would look like a century from then, he famously said he\nthought nothing currently believed would still be held as fundamental,\nexcept only the Second Law. Everything else\u2014quantum theory,\ngeneral relativity\u2014could go, but he could not imagine the Second\nLaw being overthrown. Contemporary physicists feel the same\n way.[19]\n They love the Second Law. There must be, they demand, a way to\nreconcile the universality of the Second Law with its seeming\nviolation in the way the universe has evolved on cosmological scales.\n\n\nWhat does all this have to do with black holes? At first glance,\nnothing. On deeper reflection, however, quite a lot. Hawking's Area\nTheorem, that black holes never decrease in size and can only\nincrease, is time asymmetric in the same way as the behavior of\nordinary physical systems governed by the Second Law. This, recall,\nwas the basis for the postulation of the Generalized Second Law, based\non the idea that black holes themselves possess entropy, itself one of\nthe motivating reasons that have led physicists to hypothesize that\nthe gravitational field in general, not just black holes, possess an\nintrinsic entropy\n (section 5.5),\n as Penrose (1979) hypothesized. Indeed Penrose did far more than just\nargue that the gravitational field itself possesses a generalized\nentropy. He also proposed what has come to be known as the Conformal\nCurvature Hypothesis, which states that the gravitational and\ncosmological arrows of time are driven, if not determined, by this\ngeneralized gravitational entropy. \n\nThe existence of such a general gravitational entropy may provide a\nkey to answering the question about the development of stars,\ngalaxies, and other large-scale structure in the universe, as well as\nthe puzzle about the fact that the very early universe seems prima\nfacie to have been already a state of very high\n entropy.[20]\n Just as the thermodynamical behavior of ordinary matter picks out a\npreferred direction in time, the idea goes, so does the way gravity\ntends to shape the evolution of matter on cosmological scales, and,\nmoreover, it picks out the very same direction in time. If\none could show that the extremely homogeneous conditions of the very\nearly universe was a state of low gravitational entropy, and\nthat the current inhomogeneous clumping of matter into stars,\ngalaxies, etc., is a state of high gravitational entropy, and\nthat the difference in gravitational entropy is enough to\ncounterbalance the decrease in the entropy of ordinary matter as the\nuniverse evolved from homogeneity to clumpiness, then one would have\nsaved the Second Law by replacing it with the Generalized Second Law.\nAnd that is exactly what many physicists today think is the solution\nto our problem: how to reconcile the appearance of an early state of\nthe universe of high entropy with the demanded universal validity of\nthe Second Law. \n\nAs remarked above, Penrose (1979) started this suite of ideas when he\nproposed the Conformal Curvature Hypothesis: that an entropy should be\nattributed to the gravitational field proportional to some measure of\n\u201cpurely gravitational\u201d degrees of freedom, with a low\nentropy attibuted to homogeneous and isotropic gravitational fields.\nSome work in subsequent decades has been done, primarily based on\nGoode and Wainwright (1985) and Newman (1993a, 1993b), to try to\ngeneralize Penrose's proposal and make it rigorous. Almost all this\nwork has focused on the behavior of conformal singularities\n(characterized at the end of\n section 1.3)\n which are, in a natural sense, \u201cearly\u201d cosmological\nsingularities, such as the Big Bang, and on the behavior of various\nmeasures of gravitational degrees of freedom moving to the future away\nfrom such singularities. (There has been some work, such as Rudjord\net al. 2008, attempting to link the Conformal Curvature\nHypothesis directly to black-hole entropy.) The idea is that the\ninitial cosmological singularity, in accord with Penrose's Conformal\nCurvature Hypothesis, had extraordinarily low entropy, thus\ncompensating the high entropy of the homogeneous ordinary matter\npresent then, making the early universe a state of low total entropy.\nAs the universe develops over time, and matter clumps into individual\nsystem (stars, galaxies, clusters and super clusters of galaxies,\netc.), the entropy of ordinary matter seems to drop, but,\nagain, that is more than compensated for by the enormous increase in\ngravitational entropy, thus saving the Generalized Second Law. \n\nThis is all in accord with the so-called Past Hypothesis\u2014the\nneed to postulate that the universe must have started in an extremely\nspecial, low-entropy state\u2014if one admits the existence of\ngeneralized gravitational entropy. It has long been held by many\nphysicists and philosophers that the Past Hypothesis is the only way\nto preserve the validity of the Second Law of thermodynamics over\ncosmological scales (Albert 2000). Many philosophers and physicists\nhave balked at the Past Hypothesis, however, claiming it is\nexplanatorily vacuous or that it itself raises further difficult\nquestions, such as why the universe should have started in such a\n\u201cspecial and unlikely\u201d state at all. (See Albert 2000,\nEarman 2006, Callender 2010, and Wallace 2010 for discussion of many\nof these issues, from competing perspectives.) Penrose (1979) put\nforward the intriguing possibility that his Conformal Curvature\nHypothesis itself could point to an answer to all these questions: the\nseemingly required \u201cspecialness\u201d of the state of the early\nuniverse may have a dynamical explanation in a more fundamental theory\nof quantum gravity. As intriguing as that possibility may be, it by no\nmeans has universal support. Wald (2006a), for example, gives\ncompelling arguments against the possibility that the low entropy of\nthe early state of the universe could have a dynamical origin. \n8. Analogue Black Holes and Hawking Radiation\n\nThe Hawking temperature of a macroscopic black hole is unimaginably\nsmall. For the black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Sagittarius\nA*), approximately 4 million solar masses, it is\napproximately 10-14 Kelvin. Even a black hole of one solar\nmass would have a temperature of only about 60 billionths of a Kelvin.\nDirect experimental verification of its existence therefore seems\nbeyond the realm of the imaginable, at least for macroscopic black\nholes. (If nothing else, it would be utterly swamped just by the\nordinary cosmic microwave background radiation, itself approximately\n2.7 Kelvin, a raging inferno in comparison.) \n\nIn 1981, Unruh pointed out that a direct analogue of Hawking radiation\nshould occur in the most mundane and ordinary of physical systems,\nflowing water (under particular conditions). The physical basis for\nhis idea is almost ridiculously simple: if water is flowing past a\nboundary more rapidly than its speed of sound, than an effective event\nhorizon forms, for any disturbances in the water, which will propagate\nwith the speed of sound, will necessarily be \u201ctrapped\u201d\nbehind the boundary. He then argued that the scattering of water\nwavelets at the boundary will occur with a thermalized spectrum, in\nexact accord with Hawking radiation (Unruh 1981, 2008). Since then,\nanalogue models for Hawking radiation in a wide variety of fluid,\nsolid-state, optical and quantum systems have been found. (See\nBarcel\u00f3 et al. 2011, Robertson 2012, Jacobson 2013,\nand Faccio et al. 2013 for recent reviews.) \n\nThe remarkable fact that is of most interest to us is that, because\nUnruh's arguments relied only on simple physical properties of\nno-escape boundaries and the low-energy behavior of thermalized\nradiation caused by scattering of fields off of such boundaries, Unruh\nconcluded that these so-called \u201cdumb holes\u201d (dumb because\nsilent) could serve as experimentally viable proxies for testing the\nexistence of Hawking radiation for black holes (Leonhardt and Philbin\n2008). In particular, the validity of the analogue models is argued\nfor on the grounds that the essential features of Hawking radiation\nare due solely to a few simple, formal kinematical conditions\nsatisfied by a wide range of kinds of physical systems (Visser 1998a,\n2013; Unruh and Sch\u00fctzhold 2005; Unruh 2014). In particular, the\nmanifestation of radiation-like behavior formally analogous to true\nHawking radiation from a black hole has nothing to do with any\nspecific, dynamical features of general relativity. Therefore, the\nthought goes, to detect the analogue of Hawking radiation in any of\nthese systems provides indirect but strong confirmational support for\nthe existence of actual Hawking radiation. There are, moreover, now\nseveral claims to have experimentally detected analogue Hawking\nradiation: Belgiorno et al. (2010) based on ultrashort laser\npulse filaments, i.e., intense laser pulses in a transparent\nKerr medium (those with a third-order optical nonlinearity);\nWeinfurtner et al. (2011) based on obstructed supersonic\nfluid flow; Steinhauer (2014) based on a \u201cblack-hole\nlaser\u201d composed of phonons in an Einstein-Bose condensate; and\nthe list goes on. So, has Hawking radiation been experimentally\nconfirmed, even if only indirectly? \n\nUntil recently, little philosophical work has been done on these\nanalogue black holes. Dardashti et al. (2017) argue that such\nanalogue models of event horizons and Hawking radiation can provide\npowerful confirmatory support for the existence of Hawking radiation\naround actual black holes. Indeed, they argue that these particular\nkinds of analogue model and the concomitant support they purport to\nprovide are novel, both in the sense of being of a sort not\ninvestigated before in the philosophical literature and in the sense\nof representing an innovation in actual scientific practice. (See the\nEncyclopaedia entry\n Analogy and Analogical Reasoning.)\n They base their claim on the fact that these are not only theoretical\nmodels, but that they can be\u2014and are\u2014implemented as actual\nexperiments, and thus constitute not merely analogical reasoning, but\nexperimentally controlled physical simulation. If one accepts a\ncertain kind of universality argument (Unruh and Sch\u00fctzhold\n2005), they claim, then it is this latter characteristic that lends\nthe analogue models the possibility of strong confirmatory support of\nactual Hawking radiation; and to the contrary, without acceptance of\nthat universality argument\u2014if the models were based merely on\nstandard analogical theoretical reasoning\u2014no confirmatory\nsupport at all would be had. \n\nGryb et al. (2018) compare the kinds of universality argument\nseemingly needed in this case to the more standard, familiar form of\nsuch arguments made in the context of renormalization group methods.\nThey conclude that all available universality arguments made to\nsupport taking analogue experiments to confirm the existence of\nHawking radiation are wanting in at least one of six categories that\nthey collectively deem necessary for such arguments to work\n(robustness, physical plausibility, degree of universality, empirical\nsupport, and integration of robustness and universality), with failure\nof integration being the most serious problem. \n\nThere is room, moreover, for yet more skepticism here. The arguments\nare prima facie strong that the analogue of Hawking radiation\nshould manifest in a wide range of systems, as a purely kinematical\neffect following directly from a few simple kinematical principles\nthat all those systems satisfy (Unruh 2014). Nonetheless, true\ngravitational black holes are radically different from all the\nproposed analogue systems, in a variety of extensive and deep ways, as\nis general relativity as a physical theory from all the theories\ngoverning those other types of systems. As the debate and dissension\ndiscussed in\n section 6.1\n illustrates, the fundamental physics of Hawking radiation may not be\nwell enough understood to have confidence that some confounding\nphysical factor cannot be present in purely gravitational systems that\nis not present in any of the analogue systems, a factor that would\nblock production of Hawking radiation by true black holes. In other\nwords, there seems prima facie little reason to have faith\nthat the universality condition holds, except on the basis of purely\ntheoretical arguments pertaining to systems we have no empirical\nexperience of nor access to whatsoever. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Bibliography: Philosophy", "Bibliography: Physics", "Bibliography: Philosophy Reference", "Bibliography: Physics Reference"], "cat_ref_text": {"Bibliography: Philosophy": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Albert, David Z., 2000, <em>Time and Chance</em>, Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press", "Belot, Gordon, John Earman, and Laura Ruetsche, 1999, \u201cThe\nHawking Information Loss Paradox: The Anatomy of Controversy\u201d,\n<em>British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</em>, 50(2):\n189\u2013229. doi:10.1093/bjps/50.2.189", "Bokulich, Peter, 2005, \u201cDoes Black Hole Complementarity\nAnswer Hawking\u2019s Information Loss Paradox?\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 72(5): 1336\u20131349.\ndoi:10.1086/508972", "Butterfield, Jeremy, 2006, \u201cAgainst\n\u2018Pointillisme\u2019 in Geometry\u201d, in Friedrich Stadler\nand Michael St\u00f6ltzner 2006, <em>Time and History: Proceedings of\nthe 28.
