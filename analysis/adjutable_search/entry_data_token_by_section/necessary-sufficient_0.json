Philosophy and Conditions\n\nAn ambition of twentieth-century philosophy was to analyse and refine\nthe definitions of significant terms\u2014and the concepts expressed\nby them\u2014in the hope of casting light on the tricky problems of,\nfor example, truth, morality, knowledge and existence that lay beyond\nthe reach of scientific resolution. Central to this goal was\nspecifying at least in part the conditions to be met for correct\napplication of terms, or under which certain phenomena could truly be\nsaid to be present. Even now, philosophy\u2019s unique contribution\nto interdisciplinary studies of consciousness, the evolution of\nintelligence, the meaning of altruism, the nature of moral obligation,\nthe scope of justice, the concept of pain, the theory of perception\nand so on still relies on its capacity to bring high degrees of\nconceptual exactness and rigour to discussions in these areas.\n\nIf memory is a capacity for tracking our own past experiences and\nwitnessings then a necessary condition for Penelope\nremembering giving a lecture is that it occurred in the past.\nContrariwise, that Penelope now remembers the lecture is\nsufficient for inferring that it was given in the past. In a\nwell-known attempt to use the terminology of necessary and sufficient\nconditions to illuminate what it is for one thing to be cause of\nanother thing, J. L. Mackie proposes that causes are at a minimum INUS\nconditions, that is, \u201cInsufficient but Necessary parts of a\ncondition which is itself Unnecessary but Sufficient\u201d for their\neffects (Mackie 1965). A schema like Mackie\u2019s became the\nfoundation for the \u201csufficient cause model\u201d of disease in\nepidemiology (see Rothman 1976) and continues to have influence on\nmedical thinking about disease causation, as well as on definitions of\ncausation in psychology and law (VanderWeele 2017).\n\nWhat, then, is a necessary (or a sufficient) condition? This article\ndescribes the difficulties in providing complete precision in\nanswering this question. Although the notion of sufficient condition\ncan be used in defining what a necessary condition is (and vice\nversa), there appears to be no straightforward way to give a\ncomprehensive and unambiguous account of the meaning of the term\n\u201cnecessary (or sufficient) condition\u201d itself. \n",
