    "main_text": "Theory of the Historical World || Theory of Relations: Self and Other, One and Many\n4.2 Theory of Relations: Self and Other, One and Many\nSelf and Other\n\n\nWe can shift the focus from the action of the individual historical\nbody to the interaction between distinct individuals, with\nthe world as the mediating space of mutual formation. In fact, Nishida\nmaintains that the individual, precisely as distinct, entails a plurality of\ninterrelated individuals.  The relation between \u201cI and\nThou\u201d was the first part that Nishida considered, although he\ncontinued to intertwine that relation with an internal relation in\nself-awareness.  Where his previous analysis of individual\nself-awareness described it as a self-reflection of the universal of\nself-awareness, his description now incorporated the dimension of\nrecognition. My recognition of you as not me makes me who I am, and\nyour recognition of me as not-you makes you who you are. Each is a\nrelative other to the self.\n\n\nThat Hegelian analysis is incomplete,\nhowever, without the recognition of the absolute other in the self\u2019s\ninterior. This other, recalling Nishida\u2019s notion of absolute, does not\nexclude the self; rather it constitutes self-identity as continually\nnegating what it has been. My personal self-awareness arises not when\nI recognize my identity through memory, for example, nor simply when I\nencounter an other I; rather it arises in experiencing the\ngroundlessness of my own existence, in recognizing what is absolutely\nother to a substantial self-same self. Recognizing the absolute other\nwithin constitutes not simply a reflexive self-awareness but a\nself-awakening, a realizing of the \u201ctrue self.\u201d\n\n\nNishida\u2019s term for self-awareness is jikaku, which can also be translated as self-awakening, a Buddhist\nreading he undoubtedly intends.\nNishida allows for the Buddhist view that there is actually no self to\nawaken by referring to the self-awakening of absolute nothingness; its\nawakening is the awakening of the \u201ctrue self.\u201d Absolute\nnothingness in action, as it were, entails a negation (of a\nsubstantial, self-same self) and an affirmation (of the true self). In\nthe manner of self-negation, I am one with you while not being the\nsame as you. Not only between us does a \u201ccontinuity of absolute\ndiscontinuities\u201d obtain, but also within each of us, insofar as\nour identity is in continual formation. In the end, then, Nishida\ndenies the substantiality of the self, and he re-visions both  the radical\nalterity of other persons and the transcendence of an absolute other,\nin the guise of God for example, as we shall see.\nOne and Many\n\n Eventually Nishida saw that the \u201cI-You\u201d relation does\nnot exhaust the discontinuous continuity of our being. We must also\ntake into account the third party, the relative\nother, \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d who forms at least an implicit reference to every\n\u201cI-you\u201d interaction. Nishida seems intent not so much on\nexplaining alterity, however, as preserving interdependent\nindividuality, which of course still requires difference. He has in\nmind the individuation of all phenomena but begins with the prototype\nof individuality, the self-aware human person, who is more concretely\nan individual than other single living beings, not to speak of\nindividuated atoms or particles at the most abstract level. What\ndetermines individuality at the most concrete level is the one\nhistorical world that functions dialectically as the place or medium\nof interaction among innumerable individuals.  The world is one yet\nmany; individuals are many yet one in their mutual\ndetermination. (Nishida uses the Buddhist connective soku to\nindicate the relation between one and many and to emphasize their\ninherent reversibility. Soku translates roughly as \u201cand at the same time\u201d: \u201cone and at the same time many\u201d, \u201cmany and at the same time one.\u201d Otherwise, however, his terminology in this part of his\nphilosophy is often more Hegelian than Buddhist.)\n\n\nNishida\u2019s own formulations once again make\nuse of the pattern of an undifferentiated whole differentiating or\ndetermining itself, in this case as distinct individuals. Although the topological account of a self-determining or immanently determining historical world seems to invoke more spatial than temporal notions, the description of this topos as the space wherein individuals interact and mutually determine one another is meant to accommodate the temporal dimension as well.  The world is formed in conjunction with the individual embodied selves who interact in it; like Einstein\u2019s space-time, it is not independent of the things \u201cin\u201d it and does not preexist them. But for Nishida the realization or awareness of individual selves entails the realization or awareness of the world as well. As mentioned earlier, the world too is \u201cself-aware\u201d (jikaku-teki) not only in the sense of being self-reflexive but also in the sense of realizing and recognizing itself via its individual selves who are its \u201cfocal points.\u201d  Here we see another instance of Nishida\u2019s way of universalizing first-person experience. In the discussions of the one and the\nmany, however, Nishida relatively neglected the notion of\nself-awakening\u2013\u2013the other, Buddhist-tinged reading of jikaku\nthat is such an important part of the I-You relation.\n",
