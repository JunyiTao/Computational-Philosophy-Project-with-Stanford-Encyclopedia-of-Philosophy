    "main_text": "Problematic Anaphora\n2. Problematic Anaphora\n\nSignificant interest in anaphoric pronouns grew out of the realization\nthat there are anaphoric pronouns that cannot be understood as having\ntheir references fixed by their antecedents (as in\n (3)\n and\n (11)\n above) nor as being variables bound by their quantifier antecedents\n(as in\n (2)\n and\n (12)\n above). The three sorts of examples of this discussed here have\nfigured prominently in the literature on anaphora.\n\nFirst, there is discourse anaphora: cases in which an\nanaphoric pronoun has an antecedent in another sentence, where that\nantecedent at least appears to be a\n quantifier.[4]\n Examples include:\n\n(13)\n An\nanthropologist discovered the skeleton called \u201cLucy\u201d. He\nnamed the skeleton after a Beatle\u2019s song.\n\n\n(14)\n Few\nprofessors came to the party. They had a good time.\n\n\nThere are at least two reasons for thinking that the pronouns in (13)\nand (14) are not variables bound by their quantifier antecedents. Both\nreasons are discussed by Evans (1977). The first is that such a\ntreatment clearly yields the wrong truth conditions for examples like\n(14). If \u201cthey\u201d is a bound variable in (14), the two\nsentences should be equivalent to\n\n(14a)\n Few\nprofessors : x (x came to the party and x had a\ngood time)\n\n\n(Or, more colloquially, \u201cFew professors are such that they both\ncame to the party and had a good time.\u201d) This is clearly\nincorrect, since the sentences of (14) entail that few professors\nattended the party (i.e., the first sentence entails this), whereas\n(14a) could be true if many professors\n attended.[5]\n\nThe second reason for thinking pronouns in cases of discourse anaphora\naren\u2019t bound variables is that it seems committed to the claim\nthat the following anomalous sentences aren\u2019t anomalous:\n\n*15.\n John\nbought no sheep and Harry vaccinated them.\n*16.\n Every professor came to the party. He had a great time.\n\n\nIf the (apparent) quantifiers in\n (13)\n and\n (14)\n can bind variables in sentences after those in which they occur, why\ncan\u2019t the quantifiers in (15) and (16)? If this could happen,\n(15) and (16) should be fine and should together be equivalent to,\nrespectively:\n\n(15a)\n No\nsheep were both bought by John and vaccinated by Harry.\n(16a)\n Every professor came to the party and had a great time.\n\n\nBut they are not. Thus, pronouns in discourse anaphora are not\nvariables (syntactically) bound by their quantifier\n antecedents.[6]\n\nFurthermore, there are cases of (plural) anaphora in which the\ndenotation of \u201cthey\u201d is derived in a more indirect way\nfrom the antecedent, as in (17), an example of complement\nanaphora:\n\n(17)\n Few\nstudents came to the party. They were busy studying.\n\n\nUnlike in (14), where \u201cthey\u201d picks out the professors who\ncame to the party, in (17), \u201cthey\u201d picks out the students\nwho didn\u2019t come to the party. (For more about\ncomplement anaphora, see Nouwen (2003a), for complement anaphora in the\npsycholinguistics literature, see Sanford & Moxey (1993).)\n\nNor are these like example\n (3),\n in which the pronoun simply refers to the same thing as the\nantecedent. Indefinite descriptions like \u201can\nanthropologist\u201d are commonly thought to be quantifiers, and\nexpressions like \u201cfew professors\u201d are certainly\nquantifiers, not referring expressions. On most theories of indefinite\ndescriptions, the first sentence of\n (13)\n is true just in case there is at least one anthropologist who\ndiscovered the skeleton called \u201cLucy\u201d; its truth does not\ndepend on any particular anthropologist. Thus there is no referential\nantecedent in the first sentence for the pronoun in the second\nsentence to be co-referential with.\n\nA further problem with thinking of these pronouns as referential can\nbe seen by considering a slightly more complex example:\n\n(18)\n A man\nbroke into Sarah\u2019s apartment. Scott believes he came in the\nwindow.\n\n\nThe crucial point is that the second sentence has a reading on which\nit attributes to Scott a general belief instead of a belief about a\nparticular person. This reading would be true, for example, if Scott\nbelieved that some man broke into Sarah\u2019s apartment by coming in\nthe window, but had no idea about who might have broken in. This is\n(prima facie) evidence that the pronoun in the second\nsentence is not a referring expression, because if it were, the second\nsentence of (18) would only have a reading on which it attributes to\nScott a belief about the particular person the pronoun refers to. But\nthis is\n incorrect.[7]\n (On the other hand, for a treatment of such de dicto\nreadings while maintaining that the pronoun is a referring expression,\nsee Elbourne 2005: 99\u2013106.)\n\nThus, with pronouns in discourse anaphora, we have examples of\npronouns that can neither be understood as picking up their referents\nfrom their antecedents nor as being variables bound by their\nantecedents. Discourse anaphora provides further interesting examples\nto philosophers and linguists when the antecedents are under the scope\nof quantifiers, modals, or negation. For example, the pronouns in\n(19), (20), and (22) are infelicitous, but those in (21) and (23) are\nfelicitous. This is something further that an account of discourse\nanaphora needs to\n explain.[8]\n\n(19)\n Bryan\ndidn\u2019t buy a bottle of wine. #It is a pinot noir.\n(20)\n Bryan might buy a bottle of wine. #It is a pinot noir.\n(21)\n Bryan might buy a bottle of wine. It would be a pinot noir. (This\nan example of modal subordination. For an introduction to\nmodal subordination see Roberts (1987, 1989, 1996).)\n(22)\n Bryan bought a bottle of wine at every store in the\nneighborhood. #It was a pinot noir.\n(23)\n Bryan bought a bottle of wine at every store in the\nneighborhood. It was always a pinot noir. (This is an example\nof quantificational subordination. For more on\nquantificational subordination see Brasoveanu 2006.)\n\n\nA second sort of anaphoric pronoun that cannot be understood as a\nreferring expression or as a bound variable is in fact a special case\nof discourse anaphora. However, it deserves separate mention because\nit has generated so much interest. Consider the following discourse,\nwhich we shall call a Geach Discourse, adapted from the\nanalogous conjunction in Geach 1967:\n\n(24)\n Hob\nthinks a witch blighted Bob\u2019s mare. Nob wonders whether she\nkilled Cob\u2019s sow.\n\n\nThere is a reading of this discourse on which both sentences in it are\ntrue even if there are no witches, so that \u201ca witch\u201d in\nthe first sentence must take narrow scope with respect to \u201cHob\nthinks\u201d. But then the scope of \u201ca witch\u201d cannot\nextend to the second sentence to bind the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d,\nsince the \u201cscope\u201d of \u201cHob thinks\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t extend to the second sentence. Hence on the reading in\nquestion, which we shall call the Geach Reading, the pronoun\n\u201cshe\u201d is not a bound variable. Further, since there are no\nwitches, and \u201cshe\u201d is anaphoric on \u201ca witch\u201d,\n\u201cshe\u201d in the second sentence must in some sense being used\nto \u201ctalk about\u201d a non-existent witch. Thus, it apparently\ncannot be a referring term either, since its alleged referent\ndoesn\u2019t exist. So here again we have an anaphoric pronoun that\ncannot be understood as a referring expression nor as a bound\nvariable. Examples of this sort are sometimes referred to\n(misleadingly, in our view) as instances of intentional\nidentity.\n\nThe third sort of case in which an anaphoric pronoun cannot be\nunderstood as a referring expression nor as a bound variable is that\nof \u201cdonkey\n anaphora\u201d.[9]\n Here there are two varieties, which are called conditional\nand relative clause donkey sentences, respectively:\n\n(25)\n If Sarah\nowns a donkey, she beats it.\n(26)\n Every woman who owns a donkey beats it.\n\n\nOn the readings we are concerned with, neither (25) nor (26) is\ntalking about any particular donkey, and so the pronoun\n\u201cit\u201d cannot be a term referring to a particular donkey.\nFurther, in the case of (25), all independent evidence available\nsuggests that a quantifier can\u2019t take wide scope over a\nconditional and bind variables in its consequent (*\u201cIf John owns\nevery donkeyi, he beats iti\u201d). This\nsuggests that the (apparent) quantifier \u201ca donkey\u201d in (25)\ncannot bind the pronoun in the consequent. In addition, even if\n\u201ca donkey\u201d could magically do this in (25), assuming it is\nan existential quantifier, we still wouldn\u2019t get the intuitive\ntruth conditions of (25), which require that Sarah beats\nevery donkey she owns. Similarly, the independent evidence\navailable suggests that quantifiers can\u2019t scope out of relative\nclauses (*\u201cA man who owns every donkeyi beats\niti\u201d), and so again the pronoun in (26) is not within\nthe scope of its quantifier antecedent and so is not bound by it.\nThus, the pronouns in both conditional and relative clause donkey\nsentences can be neither understood as referring expressions nor as\nbound variables.\n\nSo now we have three cases of anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions nor as bound variables: 1)\npronouns in discourse anaphora; 2) pronouns in Geach discourses and 3)\npronouns in (conditional and relative clause) donkey sentences.\nLet\u2019s call these cases of problematic anaphora. The\nrecent interest in anaphora is largely an interest in finding a\nsemantic theory for problematic anaphora. In the next section, we\noutline the main theories that have arisen to fill this void.\n",
