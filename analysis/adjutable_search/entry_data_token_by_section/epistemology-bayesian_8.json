    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || Objections to Conditionalization\n1.8 Objections to Conditionalization\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization requires one to react to new\nevidence by conditionalizing on it. So this principle, when construed\nliterally, appears to be silent on the case in which one receives\nno new evidence. That is, it seems to be too weak to require\nthat one shouldn\u2019t arbitrarily change credences when there is no\nnew evidence. To remedy this, the Principle of Conditionalization is\nusually understood such that the case of no new evidence is identified\nwith the limiting case in which one acquires a logical truth as\ntrivial new evidence, which rules out no possibilities. In that case,\nconditionalization on the trivial new evidence lowers no credences,\nand thus rescales credences only by a factor of 1\u2014no credence\nchange at all\u2014as desired. Once the Principle of\nConditionalization is construed that way, it is no longer too weak,\nbut then the worry is that it becomes too strong. Consider the\nfollowing case, which Earman (1992) adapts from Glymour (1980):\n\n\nExample (Mercury). It is 1915. Einstein has\njust developed a new theory, General Relativity. He assesses the new\ntheory with respect to some old data that have been known for at least\nfifty years: the anomalous rate of the advance of Mercury\u2019s\nperihelion (which is the point on Mercury\u2019s orbit that is\nclosest to the Sun). After some derivations and calculations, Einstein\nsoon recognizes that his new theory entails the old data about the\nadvance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion, while the Newtonian theory does\nnot. Now, Einstein increases his credence in his new theory, and\nrightly so.\n\n\n\nNote that, during his derivation and calculation, Einstein does not\nperform any experiment or collect any new astronomical data, so the\nbody of his evidence seems to remain unchanged, only consisting of the\nold data. Despite gaining no new evidence, Einstein changes (in fact,\nraises) his credence in the new theory, and rightly so\u2014against\nthe usual construal of the Principle of Conditionalization. Therefore,\nthere is a dilemma for that principle: when construed literally, it is\ntoo weak to prohibit arbitrary credence change; when construed in the\nusual way, it is too strong to accommodate Einstein\u2019s credence\nchange in the Mercury Case. This problem is Earman\u2019s problem\nof old evidence.\n\nThe problem of old evidence is sometimes presented in a different\nway\u2014in Glymour\u2019s (1980) way\u2014whose target of attack\nis not the Principle of Conditionalization but this:\n\n\nBayesian Confirmation Theory (A Simple\nVersion). Evidence E confirms hypothesis H for a\nperson at a time if and only if, at that time, her credence in\nH would be raised if she were to conditionalize on E\n(whether or not she actually does that).\n\n\n\nIf E is an old piece of evidence that a person had received\nbefore, this person\u2019s credence in E is currently 1. So,\nconditionalization on E at the present time would involve\ndropping no credence, followed by rescaling credences with a factor of\n1\u2014so there is no credence change at all. Then, by the Bayesian\naccount of confirmation stated above, old evidence E must fail\nto confirm new theory H. But that result seems to be wrong\nbecause the old data about the advance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion\nconfirmed Einstein\u2019s new theory; this is Glymour\u2019s\nproblem of old evidence, construed as a challenge to a Bayesian\naccount of confirmation. But, if Earman (1992) is right, the Mercury\nCase challenges not just Bayesian confirmation theory, but actually\ncuts deeper, all the way to one of the two core Bayesian\nnorms\u2014namely, the Principle of Conditionalization\u2014as\nsuggested by Earman\u2019s problem of old evidence. For attempted\nsolutions to Earman\u2019s old evidence problem (about\nconditionalization), see\n section 5.1\n below. For more on Glymour\u2019s old evidence problem (about\nconfirmation), see\n section 3.5 of the entry on confirmation.\n\nThe above is just the beginning of a series of problems for the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization, which will be discussed after this\ntutorial, in\n section 5.\n But here is a rough sketch: The problem of old evidence arises when a\nnew theory is developed to accommodate some old evidence. When the\nfocus is shifted from old evidence to new theory, we shall discover\nanother problem, no less thorny. Also note that the problem of old\nevidence results from a kind of inflexibility in conditionalization:\nno credence change is permitted without new evidence. Additional\nproblems have been directed at other kinds of inflexibility in\nconditionalization, such as the preservation of fully certain\ncredences. In response, some Bayesians defend the Principle of\nConditionalization by trying to develop it into better versions, as\nyou will see in\n section 5.\n\n\n",
