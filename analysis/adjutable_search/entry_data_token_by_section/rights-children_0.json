    "main_text": "Children and Rights\n1. Children and Rights\n\nIn the background of any consideration of children and rights are two\nmatters: what counts as a child, and what is to be understood as\ncapacity. The latter arises inasmuch as the question of whether\nchildren have rights and, if so, which ones normally turns on whether\nthey have the relevant capacity.\n\nWhat counts as a child and how we should understand\n\u2018childhood\u2019 are interesting philosophical questions. They\nare considered at length in Part I of Archard (2015). (See also the\nentry on\n childhood.)\n We may usefully distinguish a concept from a conception of the child\nas follows: \u2018to have a concept of \u201cchildhood\u201d is to\nrecognise that children differ interestingly from adults; to have a\nconception of childhood is to have a view of what those interesting\ndifferences are\u2019 (Archard 2015, 32). Having made this distinction we should recognise that conceptions of childhood vary across time and\ncultures. Moreover, conceptions of childhood may beg normative\nquestions of why children have a different moral status to adults. In\nwhat follows a child is understood simply as a human being at a\ncertain chronological stage of development. For instance, Article 1 of\nthe United Nations Convention defines a child as any human being below\nthe age of eighteen years \u2018unless,\u2019 it adds, \u2018under\nthe law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier\u2019\n(United Nations 1989; Archard and Tobin 2019).\n\nThe concept of capacity is relevant to questions both of which theory\nof rights is correct as well as to which rights children might have.\nOther terms such as \u2018competence\u2019 and \u2018ability\u2019\nare often used as if they were equivalent to \u2018capacity\u2019.\nHowever, it is important to be clear how \u2018capacity\u2019 is\nused (Cowden 2012). Here it is used as a dispositional concept.\nSomeone has the capacity to do X if they could do X given the\nopportunity and in the appropriate circumstances. It is to be\ndistinguished from an occurrent ability or competence to do X. Thus, a\nmature rational adult has the capacity to make autonomous choices, but\nmay be temporarily unable to choose autonomously because, for\ninstance, on this occasion their mind is disturbed, or their will is\noverborne. The notion of a child\u2019s capacity should not be\nunderstood as meaning that they have it inasmuch as they would be able\nas an adult to do certain things. Nevertheless, the distinct claim \u2013\nthat allowing a child at some age to exercise a given right would\nencourage the acquisition of the qualifying capacity that is otherwise\nlacked \u2013 should be acknowledged and given due weight.\n\nOn the question of whether children have rights and which ones, some\nthink it obvious that children do have rights and believe that the\nonly interesting question is whether children possess all and only\nthose rights which adults possess. Others are sceptical believing that\ngiven the nature both of rights and of children it is wrong to think\nof children as right-holders.\n\nFully and properly to address this issue it is necessary first to be\nclearer about the language of rights and to distinguish several\ndifferent questions. First, we can inquire as to what it is for\nsomeone to have a right, or, put another way, we can ask what being a\nright-holder consists in.We\ncan ask a second question, namely what must be true for there to be\nrights. That is, we can try to specify what have been called the\n\u2018existence conditions for rights\u2019 (Sumner 1987,\n10\u201311). Third, we can ask what the different kinds of rights\nare. Finally, we can ask what the moral significance of having a right\nis, or what weight rights have. With regard to any acknowledged right\nwe can identify it by means of its content (what is it a right to?)\nand its scope (who has it and against whom do they have it?), as well\nas its weight relative to other rights and to other moral\nconsiderations. Not all of these questions are relevant when we want\nto focus on the particular issue of whether or not children have\nrights, and, if so, which ones. However, the first question raised\nabove is especially salient. In response, there are two competing\ntheories whose respective virtues and vices have been extensively\ndebated. In one camp is the will or choice theory (Hart 1973; Sumner\n1987; Steiner 1994); in the opposing camp is the welfare or interest\ntheory (MacCormick 1982; Raz 1984; Kramer 1998). The first theory sees\na right as the protected exercise of choice. In particular to have a\nright is to have the power to enforce or waive the duty of which the\nright is the correlative. The second theory sees a right as the\nprotection of an interest of sufficient importance to impose on others\ncertain duties whose discharge allows the right-holder to enjoy the\ninterest in question. It is natural to think that each theory is more\nappropriate for certain kinds of rights. The will theory fits rights\nactively to do things (to speak, to associate with others) whereas the\ninterest theory fits rights passively to enjoy or not to suffer things\n(to receive health care, not to be tortured). However, the distinction\nbetween the theories of what it is to have a right is not, and does\nnot coincide with the distinction between different kinds of rights,\neven if there are important relations between the two\ndistinctions.\n\nIn this present context one alleged defect of the will theory is its\nexclusion of some humans from the category of right-holders. This is\nbecause whilst all humans, and perhaps many classes of non-humans such\nas animals, have interests that ought to be protected, not all humans\nhave the capacity to exercise choice. Children\u2014along with the\nseverely mentally disabled and the comatose\u2014cannot thus, on the\nwill theory, be the holders of rights. For at least one prominent\ndefender of the interest theory, the fact that children evidently do\nhave rights is sufficient to display the falsity of the will theory,\nthus making children a \u2018test-case\u2019 for the latter\n(MacCormick 1982). Of course, someone who is convinced of the\ncorrectness of the will theory might readily concede that the theory\nentails the denial of rights to children but see no reason to abandon\nthe theory. For her, the entailment is not, \u2018Children have\nrights. Therefore, the will theory is false\u2019. It is, \u2018The\nwill theory is true. Therefore, children cannot have\nrights\u2019.\n\nThe following seven\nstatements set out the arguments for the conclusions of the two\ncompeting theories of rights. 1 \u2013 4 sets out the argument for\nthe negative conclusion of the will theory, and 5 \u2013 7 set out the\nargument for the positive conclusion of the interest theory:\n\nRights are protected choices.\nOnly those capable of exercising choices\ncan be right-holders.\nChildren are incapable of exercising\nchoice.\nChildren are not right-holders.\nAdults have duties to protect the\nimportant interests of children.\nRights and duties are correlative.\nChildren are right-holders.\n\n\n(6) states an important view held by many that for each and every\nright there is a correlative duty. To say that I have a right to\nsomething is to say that someone else has a duty to me in respect of\nthat thing. There may of course be some kinds of duties which do not\ncorrelate with any rights. Indeed, some critics of children\u2019s\nrights will concede that adults have duties to protect important\ninterests of children but deny that these interests correlate with\nrights held by children. (7) is thus true only insofar as the duties\nadults have in respect of children are such that they do correlate\nwith rights held by children.\n\n(3) is obviously a contestable, and contested, claim. But insofar as\nchildren cannot exercise choice and are required to do so on the will\ntheory if they are to have rights, then it follows that they cannot\nhave rights.\n\nThe upshot of setting the two theories out in this fashion is as\nfollows: either children have rights, in which case the will theory\ncannot be true; or they do not, in which case that theory could be\ntrue.\n\nHowever, a will theorist who did not want to deny that children have\nrights might resist affirming (2). This could be done by accepting\nthat children are themselves incapable of exercising choice but\nallowing that children might have representatives or proxies, such as\nmost obviously their parents or guardians, who could exercise the\nchoices on behalf of the children. The representatives would choose\nfor the children as the children would choose if they were capable of\nchoosing for themselves. This proxy exercise of choice would take\nplace only during the period when the children were incapable of\nexercising choice and in acknowledgment of the fact that the children\nwill eventually be capable of exercising their own choices. The will\ntheory\u2019s most prominent defender (Hart 1973, 184 n.86) makes\njust such a modification of the will theory in respect of\nchildren.\n\nNow such a modification must meet a number of challenges. First, how\nshould the representatives be selected? Should those empowered to act\nas representatives be those who are most likely to choose as the\nchildren would choose if capable, or are there are other independent\ngrounds on which they are selected\u2014such as, most obviously, that\nthey are the child\u2019s parents? Second, if we think of such\nrepresentation as a trust whose beneficiaries are children and whose\ntrustees are the adults choosing for children, are the terms of the\ntrust sufficiently clear and determinate? Is it, for instance,\nperspicuous and evident what a child would choose if capable of\nchoosing? Note that the criterion is not what is in the best interests\nof the child for, consistent with the will theory, we must appeal to\nchoices rather than interests. It is sometimes difficult to say what\nsome adult who cannot currently choose\u2014because she is, for\ninstance, temporarily comatose\u2014would choose if able. It is\nimpossibly hard in the case of someone, a child, who is for the period\nof childhood simply incapable of making any choices. Third, how is the\ntrust to be enforced and by whom? The representative may be presumed\nto have a duty to choose as the child would choose if able. If rights\nare correlative with duties then someone other than the representative\nand the child must be in a position to enforce or waive this duty.\nCould this be the state or its representative?\n\nIf the will theory can meet these formidable challenges, it can accord\nrights to children who are not then a straightforward\n\u2018test-case\u2019 for determining which theory of rights is\ncorrect. Moreover, the will theorist can make two further points.\nFirst, she might accept (6)\u2014that rights and duties are\ncorrelative\u2014but deny or at least significantly modify\n(5)\u2014that adults have duties to protect the important interests\nof children. She could say that the duties that are rightly specified\nunder (5) are not the duties that correlate with rights. This is just\nto say, as all rights theorists will repeatedly say, that rights do\nnot exhaust the moral domain. What we are obligated to do because\nothers have rights against us is not everything we must morally do.\n(6) asserts that for each and every right there is a correlate duty.\nIt is not the eminently disputable claim that for each and every duty\nthere is a correlate right. So, we should, as adults, ensure that the\ninterests of children are protected and promoted. It would not follow\nthat in consequence they have rights against us.\n\nSecond a will theorist might accept (5) and (6) as they stand but say\nthat the rights which correlate with these duties are possessed not by\nthe children but by adults who are in the best position to protect the\nchildren. Thus, even if the duties adults have in respect of children\ndo correlate with rights it does not follow that the rights in\nquestion are held by those whose interests they protect. Indeed, it\nmight be argued that it does not matter whether the rights are\npossessed by those whose interests they protect. Hillel Steiner thus\nasks rhetorically, Does it really matter whether the rights that\ncorrelate with adult duties to children are held by the children or by\nthose who would act as best they could for the children? (Steiner\n1998, 261).\n\nThis review of the will and interest theories has simply examined the\nissue of whether the denial of children\u2019s rights can be thought\nof as a test case for the probity of the will theory. There may of\ncourse be other considerations that tell against the will theory and\nin favour of the interest theory; or the converse.\n",
