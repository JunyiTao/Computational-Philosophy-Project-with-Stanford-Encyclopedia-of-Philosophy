    "main_text": "History of sortal from 1690\u20131959 || Is identity strongly sortal relative?\n3.3 Is identity strongly sortal relative?\n\nOne of the novel claims in Geach\u2019s Reference and\nGenerality was that identity is relative in the strong sense that\nfor two sortal expressions F and G, b and\nc might be the same F, but not the same G. Geach\nused the expression \u201csubstantival\u201d to characterize the\nkinds of term F and G are. His\n\u201csubstantival\u201d coincides in many cases with sortals as\nunderstood by others, but cannot be entirely the same since he cites\n\u201cgold\u201d as an example of a substantival, in fact:\n\n\nwe can speak of the same gold as being first a statue and then a great\nnumber of coins, but \u201cHow many golds?\u201d does not make\nsense. Thus \u201cgold\u201d is a substantival term, though we\ncannot use it for counting. (1962: 64)\n\n\nOne of the examples he gives is that b might be the same river\nas c, but not the same water. Or, if some bronze is made into\nfirst one statue, then a different one, then the two statues are not\nthe same statue but are the same bronze.\n\nQuine (1964) and others were critical of Geach\u2019s solution to\nthese puzzles and defended the view that there is only one unqualified\nsense of identity. In each of the problem cases, his strategy was to\ntry to show that one of the statements of the form \u201csame G\nas\u201d is not a true identity statement. So in the river example,\nQuine would deny that the water is identical to the river and thus the\ntwo statements are about different objects. Almost all of\nGeach\u2019s examples can with some plausibility be treated by\ndistinguishing more carefully between objects of reference or\ndistinguishing constitution from identity. Thus one might say that the\nbronze at different times constitutes the two statues but is not\nidentical with them. Whether constitution really is or isn\u2019t\nidentity is a matter of continuing debate; for articulations of the\ntwo sides see Johnston (1992), Noonan (1993), Baker (2007, chap.3), and the entry on material constitution. For\nlater stages in the debate between Quine and Geach, see the entry on identity .\n\nSometimes it appears that identity is relative, when in fact ambiguity\nof reference is present. We might say that George and I took the same\nbus, meaning that we both took a bus on route #56. Or you might say of\nthe same events that we took different buses, because I took the #56\nat 10:25 and George took one at 12:30. But these are not conflicting\nidentity statements about the same things. The first concerns sameness\nof bus routes, while the second concerns time specific instances of\nthe route. \n\nOne example that does not readily lend itself to these approaches is\nthe problem of the Christian Trinity. According to this doctrine, God\nthe Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three persons but one God or\none substance. Thus they provide an alleged example where b and c are\ndistinct persons but the same substance. We will not enter the debate,\nwhich is been conducted for over a millennium, as to whether this\ndoctrine is coherent, but refer the reader to a modern discussion in\nCartwright 1987. It is certainly accurate to say that all of\nGeach\u2019s examples are contested. For details on how the problematic character of such examples can be systematically dispelled, see, for instance, Wiggins (2001, chap. 2).\n",
