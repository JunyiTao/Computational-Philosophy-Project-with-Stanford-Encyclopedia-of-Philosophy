    "main_text": "Other Conditions on Choice in the Original Position || The Stability Requirement\n5.3 The Stability Requirement\n\nRawls says, \u201cAn important feature of a conception of justice is\nthat it should generate its own support. Its principles should be such\nthat when they are embodied in the basic structure of society, people\ntend to acquire the corresponding sense of justice and develop a\ndesire to act in accordance with its principles. In this case a\nconception of justice is stable\u201d (TJ, 138/119). The parties in\nthe original position are to take into account the \u201crelative\nstability\u201d of a conception of justice and the society that\ninstitutes it. The stability of a just society does not mean that it\nmust be unchanging. It means rather that in the face of inevitable\nchange members of a society should be able to maintain their\nallegiance to principles of justice and the institutions they support.\nWhen disruptions to society do occur (via economic crises, war,\nnatural catastrophes, etc.) and/or society departs from justice,\ncitizens\u2019 commitments to principles of justice are sufficiently\nrobust that just institutions are eventually restored. The role of the\nstability requirement for Rawls is twofold: first, to test whether\npotential principles of justice are compatible with human natural\npropensities, or our moral psychology and general facts about social\nand economic institutions; and second, to determine whether acting on\nand from principles of justice are conducive and even essential to\nrealizing the human good.\n\nTo be stable principles of justice should be realizable in a\nfeasible and enduring social world, the ideal of which Rawls\ncalls a \u201cwell-ordered society.\u201d (See below, \u00a76.3.)\nThey need to be practicably possible given the limitations of the\nhuman condition. Moreover, this feasible social world must be one that\ncan endure over time, not by just any means, but by gaining the\nwilling support of people who live in it. People should knowingly want\nto uphold and maintain society\u2019s just institutions not just\nbecause they benefit from them, but on grounds of their sense of\njustice. In choosing principles of justice, the parties in the\noriginal position must take into account their \u201crelative\nstability\u201d (TJ \u00a776). They have to consider the degree to\nwhich a conception (in comparison with other conceptions) describes an\nachievable and sustainable system of social cooperation, and whether\nthe institutions and demands of such a society will attract\npeople\u2019s willing compliance and generally engage their sense of\njustice.\n\nFor example, suppose principles of justice were to impose a duty to\npractice impartial benevolence towards all people, and thus a duty to\nshow no greater concern for the welfare of ourselves and loved ones\nthan we do towards billions of others. This principle demands too much\nof human nature and would not be sustainable or even\nfeasible\u2014people simply would reject its onerous demands. But\nRawls\u2019s stability requirement implies more than just\n\u2018ought implies can.\u2019 It says that principles of justice\nand the scheme of social cooperation they describe should evince\n\u201cstability for the right reasons\u201d ((as Rawls later says in\nPL xli, 143f., 459f.,). Recall here the higher-order interests of the\nparties in development and exercise of their capacities for justice. A\njust society should be able to endure not simply as a modus\nvivendi, or compromise among conflicting interests; nor simply\nendure by promoting the majority of peoples\u2019 interests and/or\ncoercive enforcement of its provisions. Stability \u201cfor the right\nreasons,\u201d as conceived in Theory, requires that people\nsupport society for moral reasons of justice. Society\u2019s\nbasic principles must respond to reasonable persons\u2019 capacities\nfor justice and engage their sense of justice. Rawls regards our moral\ncapacities for justice as an integral part of our nature as sociable\nbeings. He believes that one role of a conception of justice is to\naccommodate human capacities for sociability, the capacities for\njustice that enable us to be cooperative social beings. So not only\nshould a conception of justice advance human interests, but it should\nalso answer to our moral psychology by enabling us to knowingly and\nwillingly exercise our moral capacities and sensibilities, which are\namong the moral powers to be reasonable. This is one way that\nRawls\u2019s conception of justice is \u201cideal-based\u201d (CP\n400\u2013401 n.): it is based in an ideal of human beings as free and\nequal moral persons and an ideal of their social relations as\ngenerally acceptable and justifiable to all reasonable persons\nwhatever their circumstances (the ideal of a well-ordered\nsociety).\n\nThis relates to the second ground for the stability condition, which\ncan only be mentioned here: it is that the correct principles of\njustice should be compatible with, and even integral to realizing the\nhuman good. It speaks strongly in favor of a conception of\njustice that it is compatible with and promotes the human good. First,\nif a conception of justice requires of many reasonable people that\nthey change their conscientious philosophical or religious convictions\nfor the sake of satisfying a majority\u2019s beliefs, or abandon\ntheir pursuit of the important interests that constitute their plan of\nlife, this conception could not gain their willing support and would\nnot be stable over sustained periods of time. Moreover, Rawls contends\nthat a conception of justice should enable citizens to fully exercise\nand adequately develop their moral powers, including their capacities\nfor justice. It must then engage their sense of justice in such a way\nthat they do not regard justice as a burden but should come to\nexperience that acting on and from principles of justice is worth\ndoing for its own sake. For Rawls, it speaks strongly in favor of a\nconception of justice that acting for the sake of its principles is\nexperienced as an activity that is good in itself (as Rawls contends\nin Theory of Justice); or at least that willing compliance\nwith requirements of justice is an essential part of the reasonable\ncomprehensive philosophical, religious, or moral doctrines that\nreasonable persons affirm (as Rawls contends later in Political\nLiberalism). For then justice and the full and informed exercise\nof the sense of justice are for reasonable and rational persons\nessential goods, preconditions for their living a good life, as that\nis defined by their rational conception of the good.\n",
