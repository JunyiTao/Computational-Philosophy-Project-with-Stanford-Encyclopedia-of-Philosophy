    "main_text": "Ethics || The Telos\n4.1 The Telos\n\nWhat, then, is the Stoic account of the end? How do they describe the\nkind of activity in which human happiness consists?\n\n\nZeno represented the end as: \u2018living in agreement\u2019. This\nis living in accordance with one concordant reason, since those who\nlive in conflict are unhappy... Cleanthes, [Zeno\u2019s] first\nsuccessor, added \u2018with nature\u2019, and represented it as\nfollows: \u2018the end is living in agreement with nature\u2019.\n(Stobaeus, 63B)\n\n\nAlthough our Stoic sources record a number of further descriptions of\nthe telos, some of which we will consider below, the\nformulation attributed in this passage to Cleanthes (and elsewhere to\nZeno himself, see Diogenes Laertius 63C) \u2013 \u201cliving in\nagreement with nature\u201d \u2013 offers a convenient entry-point\ninto the Stoic ethical system.\n\nOne feature of the happy life brought out by Zeno\u2019s shorter\nformulation \u2013 \u201cliving in agreement\u201d \u2013 is\nagreement with oneself. The flourishing human being is free\nof both internal psychological division and vacillation in her\npractical commitments and priorities, such that she enjoys \u201ca\ngood flow of life\u201d (Stobaeus, 63A). In characterizing the\nflourishing life as one which adheres to \u201cone concordant\nreason\u201d (Stobaeus, 63B), i.e. one coherent practical outlook\nthat is never at odds with itself or discordant over time, Zeno\nrespects what is arguably a basic intuition about human happiness\n(Cooper 2012; cf. Aristotle, Nic. Eth. 1.4,\n1095a22\u201326).\n\nWith the longer formulation, the Stoics underscore their commitment to\na bolder thesis, that, in living with agreement with herself, the\nhappy agent is also living in agreement with nature and so with the\ncosmos as a whole:\n\n\nTherefore, living in agreement with nature comes to be the end, which\nis in accordance with the nature of oneself and that of the whole,\nengaging in no activity wont to be forbidden by the universal law,\nwhich is the right reason pervading everything and identical to Zeus,\nwho is this director of the administration of existing things.\n(Diogenes Laertius, 63C)\n\n\nAs we saw above\n (2.7)\n in the context of Stoic physics \u2013 i.e. the study of nature\n\u2013 God or Zeus is identified with the active principle of the\nuniverse, the corporeal mind present everywhere within it, structuring\nand shaping the underlying matter according to an all-encompassing,\nperfectly rational plan. For a human being to live \u201cin\nagreement\u201d (homologoumen\u00f4s) with cosmic nature\ntherefore requires attuning her own reason (logos) with that\nof the whole, by thinking the same thoughts about her situation and\ncircumstances as does Zeus in governing the portion of the world she\noccupies (Cooper 2012). In this way, the flourishing agent lives in\nconformity \u201cwith the will of the administrator as the\nwhole\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\n",
