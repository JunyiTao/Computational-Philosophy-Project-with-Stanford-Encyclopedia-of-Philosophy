    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Mental and linguistic content\n4.7 Mental and linguistic content\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive of the roles naturalness plays for Lewis\nis the theory of mental and linguistic content. This role is sometimes\ngestured at by saying that natural properties are \u201creference\nmagnets\u201d (an expression borrowed from Hodes\n 1984):\n the more natural a property it is, the easier it is for thinkers to\nend up referring to it (or expressing it or thinking about it).\nReference to natural properties is something that happens \u201cby\ndefault\u201d; the less natural a property is, the more specific and\nfinely-tuned the conditions required to refer to it.\n\nThe most widely-discussed way of fleshing out this picture takes the\nform of a theory of linguistic meaning which Lewis\n (1983, 1984) presents as a sort\nof toy theory, not really true but close enough to the truth for certain dialectical purposes.\n This theory takes the form of an account of what it is for an\ninterpretation function to be admissible\n(\u201ccorrect\u201d, \u201cintended\u201d) for a given\npopulation. An interpretation function is a mapping from linguistic\nexpressions to semantic values of appropriate kinds (e.g. mapping\npredicates to properties and sentences to propositions, or to\nfunctions from contexts to propositions). According to the account, an\ninterpretation function is admissible for a population just in case it\nachieves the best overall balance of \u201cuse\u201d and\n\u201celigibility\u201d. An interpretation function\u2019s\n\u201cuse\u201d (or \u201ccharity\u201d) score is higher the more it maps sentences that\nmembers of that population are strongly and stably disposed to assert to true\npropositions. An interpretation function\u2019s\n\u201celigibility\u201d score is higher the more natural the\nsemantic values it assigns to words (and the simpler its rules for\nassigning semantic values to complex expressions). Sometimes there\nwill be ties for first place, so that multiple interpretation\nfunctions will be admissible for a population. In such cases\u2014and\nperhaps also in cases of near-ties\u2014the population\u2019s\nlanguage contains semantic\n indeterminacy.[48]\n\n\nLewis\u2019s reason for focusing on this toy theory involves a debate\nwith Putnam\n (1980).\n Putnam had argued that the only admissible interpretations of a\npopulation in possession of an \u201cempirically ideal\u201d theory\nare interpretations under which that theory is true (see entry\n challenges to metaphysical realism,\n \u00a73.5). As Lewis reconstructs Putnam\u2019s argument, his\npremise is a theory similar to the toy theory except that\n\u201cuse\u201d is the only admissibility-determining factor. Lewis\noffers the use-plus-eligibility theory as a minimal fix, and as an illustration of the\nway in which the concept of naturalness can be a helpful resource in\nformulating reductive theories of content which avoid strange\n consequences.[49]\n\nLewis\u2019s actual theory of content is more complex, and has to be\nreconstructed from several sources. It has three stages, in each of\nwhich naturalness plays some role. The first is an account of what it\nis for a person to have certain beliefs and desires, or to be more\nexact, a certain credence function (mapping properties to real numbers\nin the unit interval) and valuation function (mapping maximally\nspecific properties to real\n numbers).[50]\n The second is an account of what it is for a certain\n\u201cLanguage\u201d (function from sentences to propositions) to be\n\u201cused by\u201d (admissible for) a given population. The third\nstage extends the second stage to interpretation-functions that map\narbitrary expressions (not just sentences) to semantic values of the\nappropriate type. At each stage, the resources employed include those\nanalysed at the previous stage.\n\nLewis\n (1983)\n presents the following account of the first stage: for \\(C\\) and\n\\(V\\) to be, respectively, the prior credence and value function of a\ncertain agent \\(a\\) is for \\(C\\) to be a function from properties to\nreal numbers in the unit interval, and \\(V\\) to be a function from\nmaximally specific properties to real numbers, which together achieve\nan optimal balance of fit\u2014being such that \\(a\\) is\ndisposed, given evidence \\(E\\), to perform some action with a maximal\nexpected value of \\(V\\) in \\(C(\\bullet\\mid E)\\)\u2014and certain\nother desiderata. One of these other desiderata (and the only one\nLewis mentions) is eligibility: \u201cthe properties the subject\nsupposedly believes or desires or intends himself to have\u201d\nshould not be too severely unnatural (1992: 375). A difficulty with\nthis formulation is that it is not obvious how to extract \u201cthe\nproperties the subject supposedly believes or desires or intends\nhimself to have\u201d from a given \\(C\\) and \\(V\\). After all, any\n\\(C\\) that obeys the axioms of the probability calculus will have to\nassign values close to 1 to properties expressed by arbitrarily long\nformulae (Dorr and Hawthorne\n 2013,\n 28; Schwarz\n 2014,\n 25). Also, insofar as \u201cfit\u201d is just a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s behavioural dispositions, the account requires\nrevision in the light of the anti-behaviourist views expressed in\nLewis\u2019s other writings on the philosophy of mind, for example\nLewis\n 1980.[51]\n\n\nAt the second stage (sentence-level linguistic meaning), Lewis\n (1969;\n 1975) had developed an analysis on which a Language is used\nby a population just in case certain conventions prevail in\nthat population, for example a convention not to utter a sentence\nunless one believes the proposition to which it is mapped by that\nLanguage; semantic indeterminacy arises when the conventions are less than fully specific. Claims about conventions were in turn analysed in terms of\npatterns of credences and preferences among the members of the\npopulation. At the third stage (subsentential meaning), Lewis\n (1975)\n proposed that an interpretation function (or \u201cgrammar\u201d)\nis admissible for a population just in case it is a \u201cbest\u201d\ninterpretation whose restriction to sentences is a Language the\npopulation uses. This paper suggests that the relevant notion of\n\u201cbestness\u201d may be lacking in clarity and objectivity, and\nthat there will typically be many different best grammars, with the\nresult that semantic indeterminacy at the subsentential level is\npervasive. After embracing naturalness in Lewis\n 1983,\n Lewis would presumably have cashed out the \u201cbestness\u201d\nrelevant for the third stage in naturalness-theoretic terms, and\nconsequently been less pessimistic about this part of the program, although\nhe never spells this out explicitly.\nLewis (1992)\n also modifies his account of the second stage, appealing to\nnaturalness to address a worry raised by Hawthorne\n (1990).\n The worry was that the original theory would assign incorrect\ninterpretations to certain sentences where\u2014e.g. because they are\ntoo long\u2014hearing someone assert them would not tend to increase\nhearers\u2019 confidence in the proposition that is in fact the\ncorrect interpretation. The fix gives some admissibility-constituting\nweight to eligibility (naturalness), to allow for extrapolation from\nthe core cases covered by the convention-constituting pattern of\ncredences and preferences.[52]\n\nThe final package at stages two and three is thus structurally similar\nto the toy \u201ccharity plus eligibility\u201d theory, in that admissibility of an interpretation for a\npopulation is a matter of achieving the best overall score on several\nfactors, one of which is eligibility; the key difference is that the\nother factor is a matter not of mapping sentences people are disposed to accept to\ntruths, but rather of mapping all sentences, accepted or not, to propositions for which the\nappropriate conventions prevail. The final package also plausibly yields\nmany of the characteristic predictions of the toy theory, e.g. that we should \nexpect widespread semantic indeterminacy in domains where no\ncandidate meaning is much more natural than the rest (see, e.g., Sider 2001).[53]\n  On the other hand, some prominent\nobjections to the toy theory do not carry over to the final package.\nFor example, Hawthorne\n (2007),\n picking up on a case due to Williams\n (2007a),\n points out that the toy theory entails that it would be very easy for\nan Earth-bound population to end up speaking a language all of whose\nnames denote things on some distant planet, since if the planet was a\nsufficiently good match for Earth as we take it to be, such an\ninterpretation could do better on the score of charity than an\nEarth-centric one, without any sacrifice in eligibility. But in the\nfinal package, the shifted interpretation can easily be rejected on\nthe grounds that we do not use the Language it determines, since we do\nnot have, or expect one another to have, specific beliefs about how\nthings are on distant planets. This is true in turn because some\nrelations we bear to \\(\\langle C,V\\rangle\\) pairs where \\(C\\) is\nopinionated about how things are nearby and \\(V\\) cares about such\nthings are more natural than any relations we bear to pairs that are\nunopinionated and indifferent about nearby matters but opinionated and\nconcerned about distant planets.\n\nThe rich body of theory just described has been highly\ncontroversial, both in detail and in its overall\n architecture.[54]\n However, the general thought that more natural properties are,\nceteris paribus, easier to refer to than less natural properties can\nbe considered separately from any program for analysing the notions of\nmental or linguistic content. Looking for a relatively noncommittal\nthesis in this vicinity, Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n suggest cashing out \u2018easy to refer to\u2019 in terms of a\nphysical measure over nomic possibilities, of the sort that features\nin sciences like statistical mechanics (for more details see Dorr and\nHawthorne\n 2014).\n The thought is that ceteris paribus, the more natural a property is,\nthe greater the measure of the set of nomically possible worlds where\nit is referred to (or where it is determinately referred to, or\nthought about, or something like that). For example: if there are\nintelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, there is a far greater\nchance that they have a word that means triangle than that\nthey have a word that means three-to-five sided figure none of\nwhose sides is more than one and half times as long as any other.\nThis generalization is not tied up with any general theory of mental\nor linguistic content, although it does rest on the assumption that\nmental and semantic facts nomically supervene on physical\n facts.[55]\n\n",
